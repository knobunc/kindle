00:00|midnight|"Plus, Jemima’s idea of being a seriously good dinner party hostess is inviting lots of rich friends over, decorating the whole flat with twiggy things, getting caterers to cook loads of yummy food and telling everyone she made it herself, then sending her flatmates (me and Lissy) out to the cinema for the night and looking affronted when they dare creep back in at midnight and make themselves a hot chocolate."|"Can You Keep a Secret_"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap > 00:00"|"just after twelve"|"I arrive at the house just after twelve, to find Mum in the kitchen with my cousin Kerry. She and her husband, Nev, have moved out, too, to a village about five minutes’ drive from Stanning St. John, so they see one another all the time."|"Can You Keep a Secret_"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"“And then he came back at six o’clock . . . and said my brushwork was careless!” Her voice rises in woe. “It wasn’t careless! I only smudged one bit, and that’s because the stupid ladder wasn’t long enough.”"|"Can You Keep a Secret_"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 05:30"|five-thirty|"On the dot of five-thirty, I stop typing mid-sentence, close my computer down, and grab my coat. I’m not waiting around for him to reappear. I all but run down the stairs, and only begin to relax when I’m safely on the other side of the big glass doors."|"Can You Keep a Secret_"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 10:00"|"Ten o’clock"|"“All right. Anyway, where the hell have you been? I want you to do tea and coffee at the departmental meeting. Ten o’clock.”"|"Can You Keep a Secret_"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 03:00"|three|"“Did you go to work today?” inquires Lissy.
“Of course I did.” Jemima gives her a scathing look. “Till three.”
“How on earth do you get away with it?”"|"Can You Keep a Secret_"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"By eleven o’clock the next morning, I still haven’t managed to put a game plan together. I think I’d kind of pictured doing it behind a potted plant somewhere. But now that I actually look at them, potted plants are tiny. And all frondy. There’s no way Connor and I would be able to hide behind one, let alone risk any . . . movement."|"Can You Keep a Secret_"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"I really couldn’t cope with any more of . . . of him. If I can just keep my head down and avoid him until five o’clock and then run out the door, then everything will be fine. Life will be back to normal and I will stop feeling like my radar’s been skewed by some invisible magnetic force."|"Can You Keep a Secret_"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"~ 03:00"|"about three in the morning"|"I lie in bed on Saturday night, unable to sleep. Then, at about three in the morning, I find myself replaying that final meeting with Jack over and over in my mind. I even start composing light, friendly postcards to send him in America. Hope you had a good trip back . . . It was great to meet you . . ."|"Can You Keep a Secret_"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 08:00"|"Eight o’clock"|"“I’ll come and pick you up. If you e-mail me your address. Eight o’clock?”"|"Can You Keep a Secret_"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"I frown at my reflection in my mirror and tweak out another eyebrow hair. It’s seven o’clock, I’ve had my bath, and now I’m sitting in my robe, putting on my makeup."|"Can You Keep a Secret_"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap < 08:00"|"almost eight o’clock"|"“Don’t say that!” I exclaim, feeling a clutch of nerves. I look at my watch. It’s almost eight o’clock."|"Can You Keep a Secret_"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 08:00"|"Eight o’clock"|"“OK.” I try to sound noncommittal, but as I meet his eye, I find myself smiling, too. “Tomorrow.”
“Eight o’clock again?”
“Eight o’clock. And leave the car behind,” I add firmly. “We’ll do things my way.”"|"Can You Keep a Secret_"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 08:00"|"Eight o’clock"|"“Eight o’clock. And leave the car behind,” I add firmly. “We’ll do things my way.”"|"Can You Keep a Secret_"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 07:54"|"six minutes to eight"|"“Um, yes. With Lissy.” I glance at my watch. It’s six minutes to eight. “So anyway, I’ll see you soon. You know, around the office . . .”"|"Can You Keep a Secret_"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 07:57"|"Three minutes to eight"|"“I don’t believe this,” says Connor, shaking his head, and, to my dismay, descends heavily down onto the garden wall. I glance at my watch. Three minutes to eight. Shit!"|"Can You Keep a Secret_"|"Sophie Kinsella"
07:00|"seven A.M."|"“ ‘Monday, seven A.M.’ ” he reads aloud. “ ‘Brisk jog around block. Forty sit-ups. Lunch time: yoga class. Evening: Pilates tape. Sixty sit-ups.’ ” He takes a sip of whisky. “Very impressive. You do all this?”"|"Can You Keep a Secret_"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 08:50"|eight-fifty|"“That’ll be eight-fifty,” comes the cabbie’s voice from the front, and I give a startled jump. We’re in Clerkenwell. I’d almost forgotten what we were doing."|"Can You Keep a Secret_"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"Just then the taxi swings sharply around a corner, and I’m thrown up against Jack. Without my intending to, my brain immediately catalogs that his shirt is crisp, that his body feels hard and muscular, that he’s got the faintest five o’clock shadow, that the skin of his neck is completely different from Connor’s, that I have the strongest urge to reach up and touch him . . ."|"Can You Keep a Secret_"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 09:15"|nine-fifteen|"I glance at my watch and am shocked to see that it’s nine-fifteen. We’ve spent over an hour faffing about and we haven’t even had a drink. And it’s all my fault."|"Can You Keep a Secret_"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap ~ 05:00"|"about five o’clock"|"This is not entirely true. Yesterday evening at about five o’clock, Cyril sent around an urgent e-mail to everyone in the company, reading: A REMINDER: AT THE CFD, COSTUMES ARE COMPULSORY FOR ALL PANTHER EMPLOYEES."|"Can You Keep a Secret_"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"“Right,” I say, my heart pounding. “OK.”
“Say . . . one o’clock?”
“One o’clock it is.”"|"Can You Keep a Secret_"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"“Say . . . one o’clock?”
“One o’clock it is.”
He saunters off, holding his glass, and I stand staring after him, dripping an ice cube onto the grass."|"Can You Keep a Secret_"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"I glance at my watch and feel a fresh spasm of fright. It’s one o’clock. On the dot."|"Can You Keep a Secret_"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"“The table’s not booked until seven!” says Kerry. “How about under that tree?”"|"Can You Keep a Secret_"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 01:10"|"ten past one"|"I try to smile, but my face won’t quite do it. It’s ten past one. Jack will be waiting. What can I do?"|"Can You Keep a Secret_"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 00:00"|twelve|"“OK, folks,” says Paul, coming out of his office. “Jack Harper has done an interview on Business Watch, and it’s being broadcast at twelve. A television is being set up in the conference room; anyone who would like to can go along and watch there. But we need one person to stay behind and man the phones.” His gaze falls on me."|"Can You Keep a Secret_"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 08:30"|eight-thirty|"The next morning I wake up sick with dread. I feel exactly like a five-year-old who doesn’t want to go to school. A five-year-old with a severe hangover, that is.
“I can’t go,” I say as eight-thirty arrives. “I can’t face them.”
“Yes, you can!” says Lissy, doing up my jacket buttons. “It’ll be fine. Just keep your chin up.”"|"Can You Keep a Secret_"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 09:45"|"quarter to ten"|"“So perhaps, Emma, you’d like to take your parents out for . . . shall we call it an early lunch?”
I look up at the clock. It’s a quarter to ten.
“Thanks, Paul,” I say gratefully."|"Can You Keep a Secret_"|"Sophie Kinsella"
21:40|"nine-forty P.M."|"“Interview with Emma Corrigan. Friday, fifteenth July, nine-forty P.M.” I look up, and stiffen in fresh horror. Mick has produced a small tape recorder and is holding it toward me."|"Can You Keep a Secret_"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 02:00"|two|"What? I peer again and feel a crash of disappointment. I am such a stupid moron. It’s not Jack. It’s not one figure; it’s two. It’s Connor and what must be his new girlfriend—and they’re kissing."|"Can You Keep a Secret_"|"Sophie Kinsella"
