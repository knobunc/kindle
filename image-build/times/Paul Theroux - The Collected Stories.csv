The church bell in the village signaled eight; the Rameaus did not come back. At nine she grew restive. It was less dark outside with stars and the moon in ragged clouds like a watch crystal.

Mrs Etterick was brisk and silent, keeping four steps ahead of Gina, who was unusually talkative for this early hour. Passing the sweet shops on the hill, Gina remarked that they might buy their chocolate oranges on the way back; at the Granada, Gina said they’d have to see the Disney film – perhaps tomorrow; and there were Christmas trees stacked at the flower shop: Gina fell behind, choosing one. Mrs Etterick had not paused, or replied, and Gina had toiled on clumsy feet to catch up with her. The daughter was big, but had the stumbling round-shouldered gait of a small child. Her eyes were hooded slits in her fat solemn face and her arms swung uselessly in her sleeves."|"The Collected Stories"|"Paul Theroux"

It was a converted farmhouse at the end of a close lane, set amid crumbling farm buildings, a roofless barn, broken sheds, and fences with no gates. They were met at the front door by a woman of about thirty with a white, suspicious face."|"The Collected Stories"|"Paul Theroux"

He watched an interminable darts game, he made himself ill on cider, and briefly he wondered if the whole affair might not be the blunder Shelley feared it was. But the critic’s rules were not the poet’s, and what the poet called ruthlessness the critic might give another name. Bloodworth sympathized with Ralph, the oddjob man; he saw the similarity in his tasks and the critic’s: they received orders from the man whose poetry had earned him privileges, and stood at the margins of the poet’s world, listening for a shout, waiting for a poem. But what critic had marched forward and snatched a poem from under the poet’s nose? None had dared – until now. Bloodworth saw himself on the frontier of criticism, where there was danger, and not the usual tact required, but elaborate deceits and stratagems, odd ways of doing odd jobs. He went to bed with these thoughts, though Shelley woke him throughout the night with her coughing."|"The Collected Stories"|"Paul Theroux"

This time there were no preliminaries; only romance required them, and this was no romance. Harper was glad of that, and glad too that he was not particularly attracted to Claire. Since his marriage – and he was happy with his wife – he had not been attracted to any other woman. It did not make him calm; indeed, it worried him, because he knew that if he did fall for another woman it would matter and he would have to leave home. They skipped the bar, ate quickly, then hurried to the hotel and went to bed, hardly speaking."|"The Collected Stories"|"Paul Theroux"
05:00|"five A.M."|"14 Nov. Better. It happened in this way. Two burly secret policemen in shiny boots and well-cared-for truncheons beat at my door at five A.M. and told me to get dressed. I offered them buns. They refused saying, ‘This is not a social call, Comrade Faust. We are here on Party business.’ I asked one to pass me my new felt boots. ‘You won’t be doing much walking where you’re going,’ he said, and with that he kicked them out of my reach. As it turns out they would have come in quite handy. It is true I am in a small cell and do not walk much; but my feet are cold and I miss those boots. I hope Madam Zloty found them when she came to tidy up and had the good sense to pass them on to the chauffeur. The dopes will probably sell them, in which case I have the feeling the boots will eventually end up here: there seems to be quite a bit of black marketeering in this prison. Last night a voice whispered through the high window, ‘Cigarettes, chewing gum, razor blades.’ A small boy’s voice, but I thought of Marushka with her little tray and her pathetic bunny costume and how she was so grateful when I befriended her. I mocked her crucifix and taught her to love the Party. If only she could see what the Party has done to me! And yet … and yet I find it hard to believe that the committee knows of this. Surely this is a trick. They are testing me. I make no observation except the following: it is said that the Marquis de Sade wrote Justine in prison on a roll of toilet paper. This strikes me as incredible. Mine is already coming to bits under the flint of my stubby pencil, and I am hardly past square one."|"The Collected Stories"|"Paul Theroux"

I saw her disappear around the corner; I lingered at the school and then went in. Some students, long-haired girls with green book bags and bulging portfolios were clomping down a wooden, spiral staircase. They paused at a bulletin board, read, and passed by me. I had a look at the bulletin board myself: a tea was announced (‘Pourer, B. Yardley’), a lecture at a museum, a summer school in Vermont. Dorothy’s name was given twice, as organizer of a dance at the Biltmore for the Spring Weekend (‘Single, $3.50’) and as chairman of a lecture on Mondrian. The lecture was in a week’s time, the dance in mid-May. Savoring the pure pleasure of expectation, I decided on the dance."|"The Collected Stories"|"Paul Theroux"

In the afternoons it was as if everyone was on leave but couldn’t afford to go to Nairobi or Mombasa, as if everyone had decided to while away his time at the local bars. At the end of the month no one was paid because the ministry was short-staffed. Some of us ran out of money. The bar owners said they were earning less and less: it was no longer possible for people to drink in bars after dark. They would only have been making the same amount as before, they said, if all the people started drinking in the middle of the morning and kept it up all day. The drinking crowd was a relatively small one, and there were no casual drinkers. Most people in the city stayed at home. They were afraid to stay out after five or so.

00:00|Midnight|"There is a curious tree, native to Malaysia, called ‘The Midnight Horror.’ We had several in Ayer Hitam, one in an overgrown part of the Botanical Gardens, the other in the front garden of William Ladysmith’s house. His house was huge, nearly as grand as mine, but I was the American Consul and Ladysmith was an English teacher on a short contract. I assumed it was the tree that had brought the value of his house down. The house itself had been built before the war – one of those great breezy places, a masterpiece of colonial carpentry, with cement walls two feet thick and window blinds the size of sails on a Chinese junk. It was said that it had been the center of operations during the occupation. All this history diminished by a tree! In fact, no local person would go near the house; the Chinese members of the staff at Ladysmith’s school chose to live in that row of low warrens near the bus depot."|"The Collected Stories"|"Paul Theroux"

Below the entry for Oroxylum indicum it read, ‘Botanically, it is the sole representative of its kind; aesthetically, it is monstrous … The corolla begins to open about 10 P.M., when the tumid, wrinkled lips part and the harsh odour escapes from them. By midnight, the lurid mouth gapes widely and is filled with stink … The flowers are pollinated by bats which are attracted by the smell and, holding to the fleshy corolla with the claws on their wings, thrust their noses into its throat; scratches, as of bats, can be seen on the fallen leaves the next morning …’"|"The Collected Stories"|"Paul Theroux"

I was walking up the gravel drive when I heard the most ungodly shriek – frightening in its intensity and full of alarm. I did not recognize it as Ladysmith’s – indeed, it scarcely sounded human. But it was coming from his room. It was so loud and changed in pitch with such suddenness it might easily have been two or three people screaming, or a dozen doomed cats. The Midnight Horror tree was in full bloom and filled the night with stink."|"The Collected Stories"|"Paul Theroux"

Later, with a cast-off racket, he began playing in the early morning, before anyone was up. Evans had seen him in one of these six o’clock matches and, impressed by Raziah’s speed and backhand, taught him to serve and showed him the fine points of the game. He inspired in him the psychic alertness and confidence that makes tennis champions. Evans, unmarried, had used his bachelor’s idleness as a charitable pledge and gave this energy and optimism to Raziah, who became his pet and student and finally his partner. And Evans promised that he would, one of these years, put Raziah up for membership if he proved himself; he had so far withheld club membership from the Malay, although the boy had beaten him a number of times."|"The Collected Stories"|"Paul Theroux"

Bizarre: but the monsoon is like that, brining a dark twilight at noon. The bamboos started cracking against each other, the banana leaves turned over and twisted in the wind, the grass parted and flattened – pale green undersides were whipped horizontal. And there was that muffled announcement of a tropical storm, the distant weeping of rain on leaves. I looked up and saw it approaching, the gray skirt of the storm being drawn towards us. The Malays began running again with their corpse, but they had not gone thirty yards when the deluge was upon us, making a deafening crackle on the road and gulping in the nearby ditches."|"The Collected Stories"|"Paul Theroux"

Silence and the meaningless chirp of birds, the scraw of lizards behind the pictures on the wall.

One of them took my shawl and put it over his head and did a Wagner bit. And there was this Italian – just a hanger-on, he wasn’t a diplomat. He suggested they all go to a restaurant. It’s two in the morning, everyone’s eaten, and he wants to go to a restaurant! There was a sort of general move to the door – they’re all yelling and laughing.

In a sense, we were meeting for the first time. Their party manner was gone, and although they were tired – it was well past midnight – they seemed intense, all business. This impression was heightened by the fact that Debbie Horton, Everett’s wife, had disappeared upstairs in the last hour of the party. Neither Miss Duboys nor I was married, and none of the others’ wives were present. We had all come to the reception alone."|"The Collected Stories"|"Paul Theroux"

London is kind to lovers – it offers them privacy and quiet nights and spectacles. Albert Bridge was alight. In the daytime it is a classic bridge, but at night all its thousands of yellow light bulbs and its freshly painted curves give it the look of a circus midway suspended in the sky.

Waiting there, I thought that he might not turn up at all, just to teach me a lesson. But he came with an excuse and an apology. He had been telexing an urgent cable. Only he had clearance to work with classified material after hours, and the duty officer – Yorty, a newcomer – had no idea how to use a telex machine. So Hogle had worked late. As an ex-Army man he understood many of the military cables, and he had security clearance, and he was willing; I knew from his file that he didn’t make mistakes. His obedience had never been questioned – that is, until Horton spotted the earring.

I crept toward the vaults, the flat-topped granite huts with iron doors or sealed with stone blocks. They were unmarked; they were sadly neglected and overgrown with high bushes.

It was such a classic item, it had the look of a Chinese cliché, even to the predictable pagodas. It had been so carefully repainted, it looked like a copy – it was too perfect, too bright, not a crack or a peel mark anywhere – and every figure on it was primly arranged in a pattern of curves. The pattern was old and slightly irregular, but the surface design had been scoured of its subtlety with the fresh paint, and there was not an interesting shadow on it anywhere. You scrutinized it because it was famous, and then you were disappointed because you had scrutinized it.
