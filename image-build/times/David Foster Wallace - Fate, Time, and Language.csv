Again, it does no good here to appeal to any particular analyses of causation, or to the fact, if it is one, that causes only “work” forwards and not backwards, for our problem has been formulated without any reference to causation. It may be, for all we know, that causal relations have an unalterable direction (which is an unclear claim in itself), but it is very certain that the relations of necessity and sufficiency between events or states of affairs have not, and it is in terms of these that our data have been described."|"Fate, Time, and Language"|"David Foster Wallace"

(Tuesday, July 8, 1964)’ is true,” it follows that the cup is large, that it is brown, that it is on the table, and that all of these things characterize the cup at 10 A.M. What does not follow is that the truth that the large brown cup is on the table at 10 A.M. is itself large or brown or on the table or temporally located at 10 A.M. As we in fact use our language, it makes no more sense to attribute a time to truth than it does to ascribe to it a size, a color, or a place. Once again we find that Taylor and Cahn are engaged in a radical revision of ordinary language, one which seems to make no sense and to which they have given no sense."|"Fate, Time, and Language"|"David Foster Wallace"
12:00|noon|"Probably the most important and influential twentieth-century work on the problem of future contingents has been done by Jan Łukasiewicz and Richard Taylor. Łukasiewicz, according to Susan Haack, regarded the problem as the primary motivation for his pioneering work in the metatheory of many-valued logics.2 His 1930 “Many-Valued Systems of Propositional Logic” includes this concise characterization of a standard form of the problem and its potential implications for logical theory:I can assume without contradiction that my presence in Warsaw at a certain moment of next year, e.g. at noon on 21 December, is at the present time determined neither positively nor negatively. Hence it is possible, but not necessary, that I shall be present in  Warsaw at the given time. On this assumption the proposition ‘I shall be in Warsaw at noon on 21 December of next year,’ can at the present time be neither true nor false. For if it were true now, my future presence in Warsaw would have to be necessary, which is contradictory to the assumption. If it were false now, on the other hand, my future presence in Warsaw would be impossible, which is also contradictory to the assumption. Therefore the proposition considered is at the moment neither true nor false and must possess a third value, different from ‘0’ or falsity and ‘1’ or truth. This value we can designated by ‘½.’ It represents ‘the possible’ and joins ‘the true’ and ‘the false’ as a third value.3"|"Fate, Time, and Language"|"David Foster Wallace"
"ap 03:50"|3:50|"But there is a further distinction to be drawn, that between two at least potentially different types of physical modality. There seems to be a difference between what is just physically possible in general and what is physically possible for a given agent to do in a given set of circumstances. The former might be termed physical possibility simpliciter. It concerns what is and is not consistent with the laws of nature per se. (It is physically impossible simpliciter to travel faster than the speed of light. It is physically necessary simpliciter that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.) The latter type of modality, on the other hand, might be termed situational physical modality. It concerns the modal character of events, actions, and states of affairs, taking into account not only general and unchanging physical laws, but also the situations and circumstances that can affect what is possible and necessary at certain places at certain times. For instance, exactly three weeks ago it was situationally physically possible for me, at3:50pm, to lay both hands on the front wall of Amherst College’s Johnson Chapel. Today it is not now possible for me to lay both hands on the Chapel at 3:50, because it is now 3:49.30, and I am not even in Massachusetts. It is, of course, physically possible simpliciter for a human being to lay hands on our Chapel, and this fact never changes, so long as there are hands and a Johnson Chapel. Any constraints on the physical possibility of touching the chapel would have to be situational constraints."|"Fate, Time, and Language"|"David Foster Wallace"

I hold that, given that an actual feature of the situation that obtains at time tn is Smith’s failure-to-board-at-tn, there is no situation-at-tn, physically compatible with this actual situation, in which Smith boards at tn, since this would have as a consequence the fact that it is physically possible at tn that Smith both does and does not board at tn, which is clearly absurd."|"Fate, Time, and Language"|"David Foster Wallace"
"ap 03:30"|3:30|"T and L, however, explicitly reject this J-type analysis of the reformulated Smith problem. They prefer to treat Smith’s boarding-at-t n as an event somehow physically-compatible-at-tn with the actual situation-at-tn in which Smith does not board-at-tn, while treating only the causal consequence of this boarding-event as physically incompatible with the actual situation. This strikes me as both confused and ad hoc. T and L justify their rejection of system J’s solution in the following way: “The crux of the matter is that Smith’s not ... (boarding at 3:30:19.96) ... does not count as a condition that prevents Smith from ... (boarding at 3:30:19.96) ..., because if it did it would follow that no one can ever do anything he does not do, which is surely false.”46"|"Fate, Time, and Language"|"David Foster Wallace"
"ap 03:30"|3:30|"This claim seems very strange when read alongside Taylor’s own position in “Fatalism.” And under this essay’s analysis of physical possibility the claim is in fact not true. Under this essay’s analysis, it is quite possible at t1 that any number of things happen at t2, all but one of which will not actually happen at t2. My analysis yields only  the conclusion that, at t2, it is not physically possible for something both to happen-at-t2 and not-happen-at t2. Given the actual situation that obtains at, say, 3:30:19.95, it is at this time both physically possible that Smith boards at 3:30:19.96 and physically possible that Smith does not board at 3:30:19.96, because neither event-at-3:30:19.96 is physically incompatible with the actual situation-at-3:30:19.95. Given, though, that an explicit feature of the actual situation-at -3:30:19.96 is Smith not boarding at 3:30:19.96, I hold that there is no compatible situation-at-3:30:19.96 in which he boards. It is not at all the case that Smith “can never do anything he does not do,” but only that Smith cannot possibly both do and not do something at the same time. This fact seems to me completely and obviously true, and it’s also captured beautifully by this essay’s proposed system for properly understanding terms like “can.” I thus firmly believe that the system J is able to offer a far more satisfactory solution to T and L’s own Smith problem than the authors themselves come up with."|"Fate, Time, and Language"|"David Foster Wallace"
09:59|"9:59 A.M."|"This is all pretty standard. But Wallace wondered, What do I mean, while sitting, for instance, at my desk in Brooklyn at 9:59 A.M., when I say, “It is impossible for me to touch the Eiffel Tower at 10 A.M.”? Obviously, I don’t mean that the act described is logically impossible (it’s perfectly easy to conceive). But I also don’t quite mean that the act described violates the laws of nature (touching the Eiffel Tower at 10 A.M. is a perfectly ordinary physical act). What I mean is something like: Given the prevailing circumstances now, it is physically impossible for me to touch the Eiffel Tower at  10 A.M. Wallace dubbed this kind of modality “situational physical modality.” Unlike logical modality and plain-old physical modality, situational physical modality, he observed, is not eternal and unchanging but rather highly sensitive to details of time and place (as the Eiffel Tower example illustrates). This was a critical distinction, Wallace contended, for the notions of necessity and possibility with which the Taylor argument is concerned are those of situational physical modality. Whether it was possible for me to have fired my handgun is a question the fatalist considers by taking into account certain specific physical and temporal circumstances (such as whether we are measuring its temperature before or after the matter of the gun’s firing)."|"Fate, Time, and Language"|"David Foster Wallace"
