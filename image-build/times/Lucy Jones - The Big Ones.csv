"> 12:00"|"A little after noon"|"The next day, August 24, the lives of everyone in Campagnia were turned on end. A little after noon, Vesuvius exploded violently, sending a column of gas and ash high into the sky. Both Plinys observed this from across the Bay of Naples. The Younger wrote, “I cannot give you a more exact description of its appearance than by comparing it to a pine tree; for it shot up to a great height in the form of a tall trunk, which spread out at the top as though into branches.”"|"The Big Ones"|"Lucy Jones"
09:00|"nine a.m."|"All Saints’ is a holy day of obligation, meaning all practicing Catholics are required to go to Mass. All the churches—and there were many in Lisbon—were running multiple services through the morning to accommodate worshippers. The servants probably went to earlier services so they could be back at work, preparing the feasts to celebrate the day. The gentry and nobility would likely have been at the nine a.m. service. A notable exception was the royal family—their preference for horses and the hunt led them to go to the early service so they could head to their country estate to enjoy the holiday. Those in the churches would have been squeezed into crowded pews, making a quick escape impossible. And, to further complicate matters, the large churches had multiple side chapels, every one of them with their own altar, every altar supporting lit candles."|"The Big Ones"|"Lucy Jones"
09:40|"9:40 a.m."|"The shaking began at 9:40 a.m. With such a large earthquake, the rupture had to move down a long fault, which means the shaking likely lasted for three to five minutes. It began with a light level of shaking that grew in intensity. The Reverend Charles Davy, an English clergyman who was living in Lisbon, later described it:"|"The Big Ones"|"Lucy Jones"
11:58|"11:58 a.m."|"On September 1, 1923, at 11:58 a.m., an earthquake began that, in every sense, shook the foundation of Japanese society. A subhorizontal fault lying under Tokyo and Yokohama began to move. The rock above the fault surface, an area about forty miles wide and eighty miles long, jolted to the south. Unlike an earthquake on a vertical fault, every location situated above the fault area was literally on the earthquake. Yokohama sat atop the fault, with Tokyo just beyond it. So all the four million people of these two cities received some of the strongest shaking the earth can produce."|"The Big Ones"|"Lucy Jones"
12:00|noon|"Many of those people had returned to their homes for the noon meal and were cooking over open-flame stoves. The stoves toppled and fires started, just as Imamura had predicted sixteen years earlier. Imamura himself was at his office at the University of Tokyo. As his building shuddered and roof tiles cascaded down, he did as all seismologists would in the same situation—he pulled out his watch and timed the arrivals of different types of shaking. Later analysis has shown that the earth produced energy for about forty seconds, as the fault break that had begun at the western edge of the fault worked its way east. The seismic waves would have bounced around with a sort of echoing effect, causing shaking in Tokyo for even longer. And that was before the aftershocks began. In great earthquakes of this size, it feels like the shaking goes on forever."|"The Big Ones"|"Lucy Jones"
03:42|"3:42 a.m."|"A friend of my family was from Tangshan originally but was living in Hong Kong in 1976. Her extended family, including her mother and five brothers, remained in the city. They lived in some of the new apartment buildings, ten stories tall. The day before the earthquake, her mother had fallen ill, so she went to an infirmary on the first floor of their building. Her illness made her restless. She was awake when the shaking began at 3:42 a.m. She ran to the door to escape, but it was jammed, so she scrambled out a window. From outside, she watched as all ten stories collapsed, killing almost her entire family. Two elementary-school-age granddaughters woke as the earthquake caused their building to collapse, their seventh-floor apartment plummeting to the ground. The rubble trapped them in their bed, but they had been taught in school how to protect their heads and create air space around them as debris settled. They suffered broken bones but miraculously were dug out alive after two days. Every other member of their family who was in Tangshan that night was dead."|"The Big Ones"|"Lucy Jones"
"< 08:00"|"just before 8 a.m."|"The 2004 magnitude 9.1 earthquake itself, for all its movement, did not affect as many people as its size might suggest. The fault largely ran under the ocean and sparsely inhabited islands. The earthquake began just before 8 a.m. the day after Christmas. Aceh Province, at the north end of the island of Sumatra, was at the southern end of the earthquake rupture, and its proximity to the fault meant it suffered some of the worst effects. Many buildings in the province of Aceh and its capital, Banda Aceh, were badly damaged from the shaking. Tsunami waves arrived soon after the mainshock ended, even as aftershocks continued. Along the western coast of Aceh, wave height was fifty to one hundred feet. The number of dead is uncertain, because many people were washed out to sea, their bodies never recovered. We know that the total number of dead or missing in Indonesia was more than two hundred thousand, three times as many as in any other country, and most were from Aceh Province. The first floors of most buildings in Banda Aceh, a city with almost three hundred thousand residents, were flooded, and 10 percent of the population perished. Leupeung, a town of ten thousand also on the west coast of Aceh, was completely obliterated; only a few hundred survived."|"The Big Ones"|"Lucy Jones"
13:00|thirteen|"The tsunami continued its inexorable progression across the Indian Ocean, taking lives in India, Malaysia, the Maldives, and Myanmar. It reached the east coast of Africa, killing people in Yemen, Seychelles, South Africa, and Kenya. The waves spilled out of the Indian Ocean into both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, their continued movement recorded for the next few days on monitoring instruments of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In total, it struck thirteen countries, causing damage to infrastructure and buildings in five more. Forty-seven others lost citizens who were traveling abroad, many of them vacationers in Thailand. In this respect, it was not only a massive physical event with a devastating human toll; the Sumatran tsunami was the world’s first truly global disaster."|"The Big Ones"|"Lucy Jones"
20:40|"twenty of twenty-one"|"The mobilization of federal resources to support recovery provided a great new vista for corruption. Billions of dollars poured into New Orleans, falling into cracks between the fighting city, state, and national governments. The public outcry against FEMA helped ensure that funds streamed in, but much of it got diverted. Mayor Nagin left office in 2010, but he was convicted in 2014 on twenty of twenty-one bribery and tax evasion charges. He has the dubious distinction of being the first New Orleans mayor to be convicted of corruption. The state of Louisiana suffered from corruption as well. A program administered by the state called A Road Home, intended to help people rebuild and return to New Orleans, received $1 billion in federal money. An investigation in 2013 found that 70 percent of this money, or $700 million, was unaccounted for."|"The Big Ones"|"Lucy Jones"
03:32|"3:32 a.m."|"The three were together in the master bed several hours later, at 3:32 a.m. on April 6, when the big one hit, a magnitude 6.3 earthquake that tore L’Aquila asunder. While such a magnitude may seem small next to the earthquakes of the Pacific Rim, shaking directly atop a fault with an earthquake this size can be extreme. Essentially every building sustained damage—twenty thousand were destroyed altogether. The historic center, which had been rebuilt after the 1703 earthquake, was mostly destroyed. (It has remained off-limits in the years since, deemed too dangerous to enter.) Even more modern buildings, those erected in the boom after World War II, were mostly designed before the institution of seismic codes, and many suffered from substandard materials and construction. Dormitories at the University of L’Aquila collapsed, killing students. More than sixty thousand people were made homeless by the earthquake. The government set up refugee centers with tents that housed forty thousand of them. (The Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi did little to soothe sensibilities when he suggested that citizens should be grateful that the government was financing their stay, that they should treat it like a holiday at the beach.)"|"The Big Ones"|"Lucy Jones"
14:46|"2:46 p.m."|"At 2:46 p.m., as the kimono lay on Maki’s bed, the shaking began. A massive earthquake threw her to the floor. She braced herself, waiting for the shaking to stop. And waiting. Shaking so strong it was impossible to stand persisted for over a minute."|"The Big Ones"|"Lucy Jones"
15:41|"3:41 p.m."|"The first surge of the tsunami hit Fukushima almost an hour after the earthquake, at 3:41 p.m., with a second, even larger surge eight minutes later. The seawater pumps, whose engines had been sealed a decade prior, could withstand the waves, even at the massive scale they were experiencing. It was in the backup generators that the vulnerability lay. They were at too low a level and were completely inundated by the forty-foot-plus waves. As a consequence, the cooling systems failed for three of the six reactors on the site. Without effective cooling, the reactors overheated. Pressure built and nuclear fuel melted. It was only a matter of time before reactors began to explode."|"The Big Ones"|"Lucy Jones"
