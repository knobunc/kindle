02:30|vigils|"To Malone the sense of latent mystery in existence was always present. 
In youth  he had felt the hidden beauty and ecstasy of things, and had 
been a poet; but  poverty and sorrow and exile had turned his gaze in 
darker directions, and he  had thrilled at the imputations of evil in 
the world around. Daily life had fur  him come to be a phantasmagoria 
of macabre shadow-studies; now glittering and  leering with concealed 
rottenness as in Beardsley's best manner, now hinting  terrors behind 
the commonest shapes and objects as in the subtler and less  obvious 
work of Gustave Dor . He would often regard it as merciful that most 
 persons of high Intelligence jeer at the inmost mysteries; for, he 
argued, if  superior minds were ever placed in fullest contact with the 
secrets preserved by  ancient and lowly cults, the resultant 
abnormalities would soon not only wreck  the world, but threaten the 
very integrity of the universe. All this reflection  was no doubt 
morbid, but keen logic and a deep sense of humour ably offset it. 

      Malone was satisfied to let his notions remain as half-spied and 
forbidden  visions to be lightly played with; and hysteria came only 
when duty flung him  into a hell of revelation too sudden and insidious 
to escape. 

      He had for some time been detailed to the Butler Street station in 
Brooklyn when  the Red Hook matter came to his notice. Red Hook is a 
maze of hybrid squalor  near the ancient waterfront opposite Governor's 
Island, with dirty highways  climbing the hill from the wharves to that 
higher ground where the decayed  lengths of Clinton and Court Streets 
lead off toward the Borough Hall. Its  houses are mostly of brick, 
dating from the first quarter to the middle of the  nineteenth century, 
and some of the obscurer alleys and byways have that  alluring antique 
flavour which conventional reading leads us to call  'Dickensian'. The 
population is a hopeless tangle and enigma; Syrian, Spanish,  Italian, 
and Negro elements impinging upon one another, and fragments of 
 Scandinavian and American belts lying not far distant.. It is a babel 
of sound  and filth, and sends out strange cries to answer the lapping 
oily waves at its  grimy piers and the monstrous organ litanies of the 
harbour whistles. Here long  ago a brighter picture dwelt, with 
clear-eyed mariners on the lower streets and  homes of taste and 
substance where the larger houses line the hill. One can  trace the 
relics of this former happiness in the trim shapes of the buildings, 
 the occasional graceful churches, and the evidences of original art 
and  background in bits of detail here and there—a worn flight of 
steps, a battered  doorway, a wormy pair of decorative columns or 
pilasters, or a fragment of once  green space with bent and rusted iron 
railing. The houses are generally in solid  blocks, and now and then a 
many-windowed cupola arises to tell of days when the  households of 
captains and ship-owners watched the sea. 

      From this tangle of material and spiritual putrescence the 
blasphemies of an  hundred dialects assail the sky. Hordes of prowlers 
reel shouting and singing  along the lanes and thoroughfares, 
occasional furtive hands suddenly extinguish  lights and pull down 
curtains, and swarthy, sin-pitted faces disappear from  windows when 
visitors pick their way through. Policemen despair of order or  reform, 
and seek rather to erect barriers protecting the outside world from the 
 contagion. The clang of the patrol is answered by a kind of spectral 
silence,  and such prisoners as are taken are never communicative. 
Visible offences are as  varied as the local dialects, and run the 
gamut from the smuggling of rum and  prohibited aliens through diverse 
stages of lawlessness and obscure vice to  murder and mutilation in 
their most abhorrent guises. That these visible affairs  are not more 
frequent is not to the neighbourhood's credit, unless the power of 
 concealment be an art demanding credit. More people enter Red Hook 
than leave it —or at least, than leave it by the landward side—and 
those who are not  loquacious are the likeliest to leave. 

      Malone found in this state of things a faint stench of secrets more 
terrible  than any of the sins denounced by citizens and bemoaned by 
priests and  philanthropists. He was conscious, as one who united 
imagination with scientific  knowledge, that modern people under 
lawless conditions tend uncannily to repeat  the darkest instinctive 
patterns of primitive half-ape savagery in their daily  life and ritual 
observances; and he had often viewed with an anthropologist's  shudder 
the chanting, cursing processions of blear-eyed and pockmarked young 
men  which wound their way along in the dark small hours of morning. 
One saw groups  of these youths incessantly; sometimes in leering 
vigils on street corners,  sometimes in doorways playing eerily on 
cheap instruments of music, sometimes in  stupefied dozes or indecent 
dialogues around cafeteria tables near Borough Hall,  and sometimes in 
whispering converse around dingy taxicabs drawn up at the high  stoops 
of crumbling and closely shuttered old houses. They chilled and 
 fascinated him more than he dared confess to his associates on the 
force, for he  seemed to see in them some monstrous thread of secret 
continuity; some fiendish,  cryptical, and ancient pattern utterly 
beyond and below the sordid mass of facts  and habits and haunts listed 
with such conscientious technical care by the  police. They must be, he 
felt inwardly, the heirs of some shocking and  primordial tradition; 
the sharers of debased and broken scraps from cults and  ceremonies 
older than mankind. Their coherence and definiteness suggested it,  and 
it shewed in the singular suspicion of order which lurked beneath their 
 squalid disorder. He had not read in vain such treatises as Miss 
Murray's  Witch-Cult in Western Europe; and knew that up to recent 
years there had  certainly survived among peasants and furtive folk a 
frightful and clandestine  system of assemblies and orgies descended 
from dark religions antedating the  Aryan world, and appearing in 
popular legends as Black Masses and Witches'

 Sabbaths. That these hellish vestiges of old Turanian-Asiatic 
magic and  fertility cults were even now wholly dead he could not for a 
moment suppose, and  he frequently wondered how much older and how much 
blacker than the very worst  of the muttered tales some of them might 
really be."|"The Horror at Red Hook"|"H. P. Lovecraft"
"~ 12:00"|"about high noon"|"Then came the June wedding and the great sensation. Flatbush was gay 
for the  hour about high noon, and pennanted motors thronged the 
streets near the old  Dutch church where an awning stretched from door 
to highway. No local event ever  surpassed the Suydam-Gerritsen 
nuptials in tone and scale, and the party which  escorted bride and 
groom to the Cunard Pier was, if not exactly the smartest, at  least a 
solid page from the Social Register. At five o'clock adieux were waved, 
 and the ponderous liner edged away from the long pier, slowly turned 
its nose  seaward, discarded its tug, and headed for the widening water 
spaces that led to  old world wonders. By night the outer harbour was 
cleared, and late passengers  watched the stars twinkling above an 
unpolluted ocean. 

      Whether the tramp steamer or the scream was first to gain 
attention, no one can  say. Probably they were simultaneous, but it is 
of no use to calculate. The  scream came from the Suydam stateroom, and 
the sailor who broke down the door  could perhaps have told frightful 
things if he had not forthwith gone completely  mad—as it is, he 
shrieked more loudly than the first victims, and thereafter  ran 
simpering about the vessel till caught and put in irons. The ship's 
doctor  who entered the stateroom and turned on the lights a moment 
later did not go  mad, but told nobody what he saw till afterward, when 
he corresponded with  Malone in Chepachet. It was murder—
strangulation—but one need not say that  the claw-mark on Mrs. 
Suydam's throat could not have come from her husband's or  any other 
human hand, or that upon the white wall there flickered for an instant 
 in hateful red a legend which, later copied from memory, seems to have 
been  nothing less than the fearsome Chaldee letters of the word 
'LILITH'. One need  not mention these things because they vanished so 
quickly—as for Suydam, one  could at least bar others from the room 
until one knew what to think oneself. 

      The doctor has distinctly assured Malone that he did not see IT. 
The open  porthole, just before he turned on the lights, was clouded 
for a second with a  certain phosphorescence, and for a moment there 
seemed to echo in the night  outside the suggestion of a faint and 
hellish tittering; but no real outline met  the eye. As proof, the 
doctor points to his continued sanity. 

      Then the tramp steamer claimed all attention. A boat put off, and a 
horde of  swart, insolent ruffians in officers' dress swarmed aboard 
the temporarily  halted Cunarder. They wanted Suydam or his body—they 
had known of his trip,  and for certain reasons were sure he would die. 
The captain's deck was almost a  pandemonium; for at the instant, 
between the doctor's report from the stateroom  and the demands of the 
men from the tramp, not even the wisest and gravest  seaman could think 
what to do. Suddenly the leader of the visiting mariners, an  Arab with 
a hatefully negroid mouth, pulled forth a dirty, crumpled paper and 
 handed it to the captain. It was signed by Robert Suydam, and bore the 
following  odd message. 

      In case of sudden or unexplained accident or death on my part, 
please deliver  me or my body unquestioningly into the hands of the 
bearer and his associates. 

      Everything, for me, and perhaps for you, depends on absolute 
compliance. 

      Explanations can come later—do not fail me now. 

     —ROBERT SUYDAM

      Captain and doctor looked at each other, and the latter whispered 
something to  the former. Finally they nodded rather helplessly and led 
the way to the Suydam  stateroom. The doctor directed the captain's 
glance away as he unlocked the door  and admitted the strange seamen, 
nor did he breathe easily till they filed out  with their burden after 
an unaccountably long period of preparation. It was  wrapped in bedding 
from the berths, and the doctor was glad that the outlines  were not 
very revealing. Somehow the men got the thing over the side and away to 
 their tramp steamer without uncovering it. The Cunarder started again, 
and the  doctor and a ship's undertaker sought out the Suydam 
stateroorn to perform what  last services they could. Once more the 
physician was forced to reticence and  even to mendacity, for a hellish 
thing had happened. When the undertaker asked  him why he had drained 
off all of Mrs. Suydam's blood, he neglected to affirm  that he had not 
done so; nor did he point to the vacant bottle-spaces on the  rack, or 
to the odour in the sink which shewed the hasty disposition of the 
 bottles' original contents. The pockets of those men—if men they 
were—had  bulged damnably when they left the ship. Two hours later, 
and the world knew by  radio all that it ought to know of the horrible 
affair."|"The Horror at Red Hook"|"H. P. Lovecraft"

"< 00:00"|"just about 
midnight"|"That same June evening, without having heard a word from the sea, 
Malone was  desperately busy among the alleys of Red Hook. A sudden 
stir seemed to permeate  the place, and as if apprised by 'grapevine 
telegraph' of something singular,  the denizens clustered expectantly 
around the dance-hall church and the houses  in Parker Place. Three 
children had just disappeared—blue-eyed Norwegians from  the streets 
toward Gowanus—and there were rumours of a mob forming among the 
 sturdy Vikings of that section. Malone had for weeks been urging his 
colleagues  to attempt a general cleanup; and at last, moved by 
conditions more obvious to  their common sense than the conjectures of 
a Dublin dreamer, they had agreed  upon a final stroke. The unrest and 
menace of this evening had been the deciding  factor, and just about 
midnight a raiding party recruited from three stations  descended upon 
Parker Place and its environs. Doors were battered in, stragglers 
 arrested, and candlelighted rooms forced to disgorge unbelievable 
throngs of  mixed foreigners in figured robes, mitres, and other 
inexplicable devices. Much  was lost in the melee, for objects were 
thrown hastily down unexpected shafts,  and betraying odours deadened 
by the sudden kindling of pungent incense. But  spattered blood was 
everywhere, and Malone shuddered whenever he saw a brazier  or altar 
from which the smoke was still rising. 

      He wanted to be in several places at once, and decided on Suydam's 
basement flat  only after a messenger had reported the complete 
emptiness of the dilapidated  dance-hall church. The flat, he thought, 
must hold some due to a cult of which  the occult scholar had so 
obviously become the centre and leader; and it was  with real 
expectancy that he ransacked the musty rooms, noted their vaguely 
 charnel odour, and examined the curious books, instruments, gold 
ingots, and  glass-stoppered bottles scattered carelessly here and 
there. Once a lean,  black-and-white cat edged between his feet and 
tripped him, overturning at the  same time a beaker half full of a red 
liquid. The shock was severe, and to this  day Malone is not certain of 
what he saw; but in dreams he still pictures that  cat as it scuttled 
away with certain monstrous alterations and peculiarities. 

      Then came the locked cellar door, and the search for something to 
break it down. 

      A heavy stool stood near, and its tough seat was more than enough 
for the  antique panels. A crack formed and enlarged, and the whole 
door gave way—but  from the other side; whence poured a howling 
tumult of ice-cold wind with all  the stenches of the bottomless pit, 
and whence reached a sucking force not of  earth or heaven, which, 
coiling sentiently about the paralysed detective,  dragged him through 
the aperture and down unmeasured spaces filled with whispers  and 
wails, and gusts of mocking laughter. 

      Of course it was a dream. All the specialists have told him so, and 
he has  nothing to prove the contrary. Indeed, he would rather have it 
thus; for then  the sight of old brick slums and dark foreign faces 
would not eat so deeply into  his soul. But at the time it was all 
horribly real, and nothing can ever efface  the memory of those nighted 
crypts, those titan arcades, and those half-formed  shapes of hell that 
strode gigantically in silence holding half-eaten things  whose still 
surviving portions screamed for mercy or laughed with madness. 

      Odours of incense and corruption joined in sickening concert, and 
the black air  was alive with the cloudy, semi-visible bulk of 
shapeless elemental things with  eyes. Somewhere dark sticky water was 
lapping at onyx piers, and once the  shivery tinkle of raucous little 
bells pealed out to greet the insane titter of  a naked phosphorescent 
thing which swam into sight, scrambled ashore, and  climbed up to squat 
leeringly on a carved golden pedestal in the background. 

      Avenues of limitless night seemed to radiate in every direction, 
till one might  fancy that here lay the root of a contagion destined to 
sicken and swallow  cities, and engulf nations in the foetor of hybrid 
pestilence. Here cosmic sin  had entered, and festered by unhallowed 
rites had commenced the grinning march  of death that was to rot us all 
to fungous abnormalities too hideous for the  grave's holding. Satan 
here held his Babylonish court, and in the blood of  stainless 
childhood the leprous limbs of phosphorescent Lilith were laved. 

      Incubi and succubae howled praise to Hecate, and headless 
moon-calves bleated to  the Magna Mater. Goats leaped to the sound of 
thin accursed flutes, and  gypans  chased endlessly after misshapen 
fauns over rocks twisted like swollen toads. 

      Moloch and Ashtaroth were not absent; for in this quintessence of 
all damnation  the bounds of consciousness were let down, and man's 
fancy lay open to vistas of  every realm of horror and every forbidden 
dimension that evil had power to  mould. The world and Nature were 
helpless against such assaults from unsealed  wells of night, nor could 
any sign or prayer check the Walpurgis-riot of horror  which had come 
when a sage with the hateful key had stumbled on a horde with the 
 locked and brimming coffer of transmitted daemon-lore. 

      Suddenly a ray of physical light shot through these phantasms, and 
Malone heard  the sound of oars amidst the blasphemies of things that 
should be dead. A boat  with a lantern in its prow darted into sight, 
made fast to an iron ring in the  slimy stone pier, and vomited forth 
several dark men bearing a long burden  swathed in bedding. They took 
it to the naked phosphorescent thing on the carved  golden pedestal, 
and the thing tittered and pawed at the bedding. Then they  unswathed 
it, and propped upright before the pedestal the gangrenous corpse of a 
 corpulent old man with stubbly beard and unkempt white hair. The 
phosphorescent  thing tittered again, and the men produced bottles from 
their pockets and  anointed its feet with red, whilst they afterward 
gave the bottles to the thing  to drink from. 

      All at once, from an arcaded avenue leading endlessly away, there 
came the  daemoniac rattle and wheeze of a blasphemous organ, choking 
and rumbling out the  mockeries of hell in a cracked, sardonic bass. In 
an instant every moving entity  was electrified; and forming at once 
into a ceremonial procession, the nightmare  horde slithered away in 
quest of the sound—goat, satyr, and  gypan, incubus,  succubus and 
lemur, twisted toad and shapeless elemental, dog-faced howler and 
 silent strutter in darkness—all led by the abominable naked 
phosphorescent  thing that had squatted on the carved golden throne, 
and that now strode  insolently bearing in its arms the glassy-eyed 
corpse of the corpulent old man. 

      The strange dark men danced in the rear, and the whole column 
skipped and leaped  with Dionysiac fury. Malone staggered after them a 
few steps, delirious and  hazy, and doubtful of his place in this or in 
any world. Then he turned,  faltered, and sank down on the cold damp 
stone, gasping and shivering as the  daemon organ croaked on, and the 
howling and drumming and tinkling of the mad  procession grew fainter 
and fainter. 

      Vaguely he was conscious of chanted horrors and shocking croakings 
afar off. Now  and then a wail or whine of ceremonial devotion would 
float to him through the  black arcade, whilst eventually there rose 
the dreadful Greek incantation whose  text he had read above the pulpit 
of that dance-hall church. 

      'O friend and companion of night, thou who rejoicest in the 
baying of dogs  (here a hideous howl bust forth) and spilt blood (here 
nameless sounds vied  with morbid shriekings) who wanderest in the 
midst of shades among the tombs,  (here a whistling sigh occurred) who 
longest for blood and bringest terror to  mortals, (short, sharp cries 
from myriad throats) Gorgo, (repeated as  response) Mormo, (repeated 
with ecstasy) thousand-faced moon, (sighs and flute  notes) look 
favourably on our sacrifices!'

      As the chant closed, a general shout went up, and hissing sounds 
nearly drowned  the croaking of the cracked bass organ. Then a gasp as 
from many throats, and a  babel of barked and bleated words—'Lilith, 
Great Lilith, behold the  Bridegroom!' More cries, a clamour of 
rioting, and the sharp, clicking footfalls  of a running figure. The 
footfalls approached, and Malone raised himself to his  elbow to look. 

      The luminosity of the crypt, lately diminished, had now slightly 
increased; and  in that devil-light there appeared the fleeing form of 
that which should not  flee or feel or breathe—the glassy-eyed, 
gangrenous corpse of the corpulent  old man, now needing no support, 
but animated by some infernal sorcery of the  rite just closed. After 
it raced the naked, tittering, phosphorescent thing that  belonged on 
the carven pedestal, and still farther behind panted the dark men,  and 
all the dread crew of sentient loathsomenesses. The corpse was gaining 
on  its pursuers, and seemed bent on a definite object, straining with 
every rotting  muscle toward the carved golden pedestal, whose 
necromantic importance was  evidently so great. Another moment and it 
had reached its goal, whilst the  trailing throng laboured on with more 
frantic speed. But they were too late, for  in one final spurt of 
strength which ripped tendon from tendon and sent its  noisome bulk 
floundering to the floor in a state of jellyish dissolution, the 
 staring corpse which had been Robert Suydam achieved its object and 
its triumph. 

      The push had been tremendous, but the force had held out; and as 
the pusher  collapsed to a muddy blotch of corruption the pedestal he 
had pushed tottered,  tipped, and finally careened from its onyx base 
into the thick waters below,  sending up a parting gleam of carven gold 
as it sank heavily to undreamable  gulfs of lower Tartarus. In that 
instant, too, the whole scene of horror faded  to nothingness before 
Malone's eyes; and he fainted amidst a thunderous crash  which seemed 
to blot out all the evil universe. 

      VII  Malone's dream, experienced in full before he knew of Suydam's 
death and  transfer at sea, was curiously supplemented by some odd 
realities of the case;  though that is no reason why anyone should 
believe it. The three old houses in  Parker Place, doubtless long 
rotten with decay in its most insidious form,  collapsed without 
visible cause while half the raiders and most of the prisoners  were 
inside; and of both the greater number were instantly killed. Only in 
the  basements and cellars was there much saving of life, and Malone 
was lucky to  have been deep below the house of Robert Suydam. For he 
really was there, as no  one is disposed to deny. They found him 
unconscious by the edge of a night-black  pool, with a grotesquely 
horrible jumble of decay and bone, identifiable through  dental work as 
the body of Suydam, a few feet away. The case was plain, for it  was 
hither that the smugglers' underground canal led; and the men who took 
 Suydam from the ship had brought him home. They themselves were never 
found, or  at least never identified; and the ship's doctor is not yet 
satisfied with the  simple certitudes of the police. 

      Suydam was evidently a leader in extensive man-smuggling 
operations, for the  canal to his house was but one of several 
subterranean channels and tunnels in  the neighbourhood. There was a 
tunnel from this house to a crypt beneath the  dance-hall church; a 
crypt accessible from the church only through a narrow  secret passage 
in the north wall, and in whose chambers some singular and  terrible 
things were discovered. The croaking organ was there, as well as a vast 
 arched chapel with wooden benches and a strangely figured altar. The 
walls were  lined with small cells, in seventeen of which—hideous to 
relate—solitary  prisoners in a state of complete idiocy were found 
chained, including four  mothers with infants of disturbingly strange 
appearance. These infants died soon  after exposure to the light; a 
circumstance which the doctors thought rather  merciful. Nobody but 
Malone, among those who inspected them, remembered the  sombre question 
of old Delrio: 'An sint unquam daemones incubi et succubae, et  an 
ex tali congressu proles nasci queat?'

 Before the canals were filled up they were thoroughly dredged, and 
yielded forth  a sensational array of sawed and split bones of all 
sizes. The kidnapping  epidemic, very clearly, had been traced home; 
though only two of the surviving  prisoners could by any legal thread 
be connected with it. These men are now in  prison, since they failed 
of conviction as accessories in the actual murders. 

      The carved golden pedestal or throne so often mentioned by Malone 
as of primary  occult importance was never brought to light, though at 
one place under the  Suydam house the canal was observed to sink into a 
well too deep for dredging. 

      It was choked up at the mouth and cemented over when the cellars of 
the new  houses were made, but Malone often speculates on what lies 
beneath. The police,  satisfied that they had shattered a dangerous 
gang of maniacs and man-smugglers,  turned over to the Federal 
authorities the unconvicted Kurds, who befure their  deportation were 
conclusively found to belong to the Yezidi clan of  devil-worshippers. 
The tramp ship and its crew remain an elusive mystery. though  cynical 
detectives are once more ready to combat its smugging and rum-running 
 ventures. Malone thinks these detectives shew a sadly limited 
perspective in  their lack of wonder at the myriad unexplainable 
details, and the suggestive  obscurity of the whole case; though he is 
just as critical of the newspapers,  which saw only a morbid sensation 
and gloated over a minor sadist cult which  they might have proclaimed 
a horror from the universe's very heart. But he is  content to rest 
silent in Chepachet, calming his nervous system and praying that  time 
may gradually transfer his terrible experience from the realm of 
present  reality to that of picturesque and semi-mythical remoteness. 

      Robert Suydam sleeps beside his bride in Greenwood Cemetery. No 
funeral was held  over the strangely released bones, and relatives are 
grateful for the swift  oblivion which overtook the case as a whole. 
The scholar's connexion with the  Red Hook horrors, indeed, was never 
emblazoned by legal proof; since his death  forestalled the inquiry he 
would otherwise have faced. His own end is not much  mentioned, and the 
Suydams hope that posterity may recall him only as a gentle  recluse 
who dabbled in harmless magic and folklore. 

      As for Red Hook—it is always the same. Suydam came and went; a 
terror gathered  and faded; but the evil spirit of darkness and squalor 
broods on amongst the  mongrels in the old brick houses, and prowling 
bands still parade on unknown  errands past windows where lights and 
twisted faces unaccountably appear and  disappear. Age-old horror is a 
hydra with a thousand heads, and the cults of  darkness are rooted in 
blasphemies deeper than the well of Democritus, The soul  of the beast 
is omnipresent and triumphant, and Red Hook's legions of  blear-eyed, 
pockmarked youths still chant and curse and howl as they file from 
 abyss to abyss, none knows whence or whither, pushed on by blind laws 
of biology  which they may never understand. As of old, more people 
enter Red Hook than  leave it on the landward side, and there are 
already rumours of new canals  running underground to certain centres 
of traffic in liquor and less mentionable  things. 

      The dance-hall church is now mostly a dance-hall, and queer faces 
have appeared  at night at the windows. Lately a policeman expressed 
the belief that the  filled-up crypt has been dug out again, and for no 
simply explainable purpose. 

      Who are we to combat poisons older than history and mankind? Apes 
danced in Asia  to those horrors, and the cancer lurks secure and 
spreading where furtiveness  hides in rows of decaying brick. 

      Malone does not shudder without cause—for only the other day an 
officer  overheard a swarthy squinting hag teaching a small child some 
whispered patois  in the shadow of an areaway. He listened, and thought 
it very strange when he  heard her repeat over and over again,

      'O friend and companion of night, thou who rejoicest 
in the baying of dogs and  spilt blood, who wanderest in the midst of 
shades among the tombs, who longest  for blood and bringest terror to 
mortals, Gorgo, Mormo, thousand-faced moon,  look favourably on our 
sacrifices!'"|"The Horror at Red Hook"|"H. P. Lovecraft"
