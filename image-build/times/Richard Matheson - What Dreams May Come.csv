"ap 06:53"|"six fifty-three"|"I looked at my clock-radio, leaning close to see the hands and numbers. It was six fifty-three. I looked out through the glass door. It wasn’t dark outside. Misty but not dark. Yet how could it be morning if the house was empty? At this time, they should all be in their beds."|"What Dreams May Come"|"Richard Matheson"
23:56|"four to midnight"|"“In Santa Monica, 1949,” I said. “I’d come to California from Brooklyn. I was working at Douglas Aircraft from four to midnight. After I finished writing every morning, I went to the beach for an hour or two."|"What Dreams May Come"|"Richard Matheson"
15:07|"3:07 p.m."|"“Thank you for our children. Thank you for providing the clean and lovely vessel of your body for the creation of their physical lives. Do you know I still remember the exact moment each of them was born? Louise at 3:07 p.m. on January 22, 1951, Richard at 7:02 a.m. on October 14, 1953, Marie at 9:04 p.m. on July 5, 1956 and Ian at 8:07 a.m. on February 25, 1959. Thank you for the joy I felt at seeing each of them for the first time—and for the joys that each has brought to my life. Thank you for teaching me to be considerate of them and respect their separate identities. Thank you for being such a fine example to our daughters and sons, showing them what’s possible in a wife and mother."|"What Dreams May Come"|"Richard Matheson"

"ap 00:30"|"half of one"|"Similar, I say. It couldn’t be the same. I knew that she would live now, not die. Still, our separation was equally distressing to me. I couldn’t tell you, Robert, what the higher ramifications are of being soul mates. I can tell you this however. As long as you are separated from your own, that long are you troubled. No matter what the circumstances, no matter how exquisite the environment in which you find yourself.
To be half of one can only be a torment when the other half is gone.
