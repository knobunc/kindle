That event took place at 8:32 p.m. on March 2, 1933, and now you’re standing at the same place, so the difference is “0 avenues, 0 streets, 0 height, 83.9 years.” But Kong’s log shows a much briefer amount of time, due to the distortions of time that took place over the immense distances he traveled in his high-speed journey."|"Einstein's Greatest Mistake"|"David Bodanis"

If Einstein was right, the sun was already distorting the space overhead—like the rock on our taut trampoline—so that light from the stars in the distant Hyades cluster would bank hard as it took that curve. The starlight would have been traveling for trillions of miles by that point.

With the achievement of a lifetime lying in scattered notes on his desk (“It was almost three o’clock in the morning . . . I was far too excited to sleep”), he hiked down to the southernmost tip of Heligoland, climbed a rock jutting into the sea, and—as Einstein and his friends had on the mountain near Bern twenty years before—rested there to watch the sun rise over the North Sea stretching before him. Strict causality had triumphed in the West for hundreds of years. Now, limiting himself to external measurements just as he thought Einstein had—presuming it was not our job to speculate on what went on “inside”—he had a different breakthrough. Heisenberg’s work is considered the birth of the new quantum mechanics."|"Einstein's Greatest Mistake"|"David Bodanis"

Sommerfeld tried to switch the topic, raising theoretical questions where Heisenberg’s knowledge of mathematics would let him do well. Wien waited till they were done and then returned to his polite questions: Could Mr. Heisenberg perhaps now tell him how a radio circuit worked? Heisenberg tried to figure it out but then got lost, for these were details he’d never studied. Then Wien asked how an oscilloscope worked. Finally, Wien asked: Could Heisenberg even tell him how an ordinary microscope worked?"|"Einstein's Greatest Mistake"|"David Bodanis"

You do well in this midnight hour to commit to the flames the evil spirit of the past!” Goebbels’s photographers were standing by, ready to capture the images that would be shown across the country: the joy before flames, the exultation in the crowds.
