20:07|twenty-seven|"His mother glared at him as he shuffled warily into the living room. She was lying facedown on the couch, her bathrobe tied loosely around her. Sylvia Stevens wasn’t an old woman, but she carried herself that way, always ill in the morning, groaning as she moved. At twenty-seven she felt as if she’d seen it all. Married early, kid soon after. She hated every minute of it, and it showed in the premature crow’s-feet growing around her young eyes. She reached over for her glass and pulled it to her lips without looking. Dry as a bone. She sighed deeply, frustrated by this latest tragedy, reaching for the orange juice she had at the ready."|"Dreams and Shadows"|"C. Robert Cargill"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"“And where are you tearing off to this morning?” she asked, barely paying attention.
“Mommy, it’s two o’clock.”
“That may be,” she said, pouring half a glass of juice, “but where are you going?”"|"Dreams and Shadows"|"C. Robert Cargill"
"ap > 05:00"|"after five"|"“Okay, now I don’t want you home till after five, you hear me? Mommy needs her quiet time alone.” Sylvia picked up the bottle of vodka next to the juice, filling the other half of the glass with it. Colby nodded. “Now you be careful out there. I don’t want you coming home early bleeding from your head, okay? Be safe.”"|"Dreams and Shadows"|"C. Robert Cargill"
"ap 03:45"|3:45|"Colby lifted the plastic face on his watch, checking the time. It read 3:45. “What’ll I get?”"|"Dreams and Shadows"|"C. Robert Cargill"
"ap 03:47"|3:47|"Arriving at the ROAD CLOSED sign, Colby stopped dead in his tracks. The man’s car was still in the driveway. Colby’s watch read 3:47. Crap. He wished that the man would hurry up, finish helping Mommy with her headache and leave so he could go home. But he wouldn’t get his wish until tomorrow, and the more he thought about it, the more he realized that this would be a rather silly and wasted wish. He would wait, no matter how long an eternity that hour and thirteen minutes might be."|"Dreams and Shadows"|"C. Robert Cargill"

He would wait, because when Mommy said five o’clock, she meant it.

06:00|"six a.m."|"No manner of exhaustion can keep a child asleep much later than six a.m. on Christmas Day. Colby awoke at 4:35. Today he was promised anything he wanted. Anything in the world. And while it would be nice to say that Colby had pondered, even for a moment, the starving children in Africa, the plight of those ravaged by disease the world over, or even the homeless guy who slept off a twelve-pack of the cheap stuff on the corner behind the convenience store—he did not. Colby thought about toys. Lots and lots of toys."|"Dreams and Shadows"|"C. Robert Cargill"

"ap 10:53"|10:53|"“Okay,” he said, smiling. Then out the door, around the corner, and off into the magical kingdom beyond the ROAD CLOSED sign. Crap, 10:53. Four hours."|"Dreams and Shadows"|"C. Robert Cargill"
"ap < 03:45"|"toward three forty-five"|"The hours passed at a glacial pace, as if each second were made almost twice as long by the anticipation, and as Colby entered the final stretch toward three forty-five, his stomach tightened up, his bladder tingling—a nervous, almost sick feeling filling it—while his feet tapped uncontrollably. He spent the last seven minutes staring intently at his watch, each minute seeming longer than the one before it. As the final four changed into a five, he shot to his feet, looking around with wild, excited eyes. But there was nothing to see. No one slipping out of the bushes or from behind a tree. He waited a bit more. “Hello?” he called out. “Yashar?”"|"Dreams and Shadows"|"C. Robert Cargill"
"ap 03:47"|3:47|"Nothing.
3:47.
“What a gyp!”"|"Dreams and Shadows"|"C. Robert Cargill"
"ap 05:00"|five|"UPSTAIRS, IN COLBY’S bedroom, Yashar gazed at the various pennants and posters adorning the wall, clearly placed there by a father wishing his son would grow up liking the same things he did. Nothing on the walls spoke of Colby at all—excepting perhaps that his parents didn’t really know him that well. Colby tiptoed across the creaky wooden floor, trying not to disturb his mother, still asleep on the couch in the living room below. Yashar took a few steps, pacing toward the window. “Shhh,” Colby warned. “Mommy said not to be back until five, and if she wakes up there’s gonna be trouble.”"|"Dreams and Shadows"|"C. Robert Cargill"
"ap 07:30"|"seven thirty"|"Yashar looked back over his shoulder at Colby. “Half a bottle of Stoli in her stomach says she doesn’t wake up until seven thirty.”"|"Dreams and Shadows"|"C. Robert Cargill"
00:00|midnight|"She looked up over her shoulder, nodding into the forest behind her. They were not alone. Three more riders perched atop their flickering midnight steeds, leaning casually forward, each goat’s fur ruffling in the wind. They gave one another knowing looks, then let their skeletal, rotting jaws flap loose an infernal scream before heaving forth, blades held high."|"Dreams and Shadows"|"C. Robert Cargill"
14:00|"two in the afternoon"|"It was two in the afternoon on a rather warm and delightful Tuesday—nestled perfectly in the bosom of spring—that the boy Colby and the boy Ewan first set eyes on each other. There was no preamble to their meeting, no warning or alarm. Both boys darted around a tree, stopping dead in their tracks, their eyes locking immediately."|"Dreams and Shadows"|"C. Robert Cargill"
"ap 01:00"|one|"“He’s normal.”
“No, he’s a fairy. Got done turned into one the night of the Tithe.”
“But he never fully changed.”"|"Dreams and Shadows"|"C. Robert Cargill"
00:00|midnight|"There it was, draped over a chair, drying in the midnight air. He wobbled to his feet, his knees buckling, just strong enough to stand him up and stumble him across the room. His fingers swept the chair, snatched the cap off with the sharpened end of a fingernail. Ewan breathed a sigh of relief as he slipped it on, but it proved to be little comfort. Something was wrong. His cap was almost dry, only the tiniest bit of dampness remaining."|"Dreams and Shadows"|"C. Robert Cargill"
12:00|noon|"Meinrad stepped close to Colby, looming over him. “You are henceforth banned from the Limestone Kingdom. All rights of safe travel are revoked. You have until noon to gather your things and make your way out of Austin.” He poked a rocky, moss-covered finger into Colby’s chest. “There needed to be only one death today. You should not have interfered.”"|"Dreams and Shadows"|"C. Robert Cargill"
