12:00|midday|"The elven camp was around and in an elf elm, of course; everyone knows elves will reside nowhere else. When danger threatened, the women and children retreated to the heights, while the warriors ringed the base of the tree. At the moment, most of them were down, for they were setting up for their midday meal. The smells were good, but I was still digesting pies and wasn't really hungry. That was just as well, for their portions were small."|"Crewel Lye"|"Piers Anthony"
12:00|noon|"By noon we reached the crest. Not the peak; there was no point in going right over that, as we weren't interested in height, just in getting past. We headed for the lowest notch in the ridge that ran from peak to peak in this range. Wind cut through it with extra effort, stirring up powdered snow; I was reminded of the snow-birds' snow and shuddered, but I knew it wasn't that. I would be glad when we got down to good old-fashioned garden-variety tangle trees and hypnogourds again!"|"Crewel Lye"|"Piers Anthony"
12:00|midday|"We made it to the top of the slope by midday, to our immense relief. There was a nice green plain loaded with tall grass and dotted with fruit and nut trees. Here we could relax and fill up, as we so desperately needed to."|"Crewel Lye"|"Piers Anthony"
00:00|midnight|"Threnody got a gray dress from her closet and donned it and her slippers. She stood before a mirror and brushed out her hair. She had lustrous black tresses, matching her midnight eyes. I had been partial to fair women, but now I realized that the dusky ones could be every bit as appealing, physically. ""All right, I'm ready,"" she informed me."|"Crewel Lye"|"Piers Anthony"
12:00|noon|"At noon we came to a pleasant grove of ances-trees. Each had a solid base that soon split into two major branches, and these split into four, and thence to eight, until at the fringe there were so many little branches that the eye lost track. The bark was corrugated and thus resembled printed words; sometimes I wished I could read, so that I could contemplate my own family tree."|"Crewel Lye"|"Piers Anthony"
"~ 12:00"|"Around noon"|"Around noon a shadow descended. I looked up and saw a great bird circling. It was a roc and it looked hungry--and the dollarpede was about the right size for a snack. ""Get under cover!"" I cried, needing no special intelligence to recognize danger like this."|"Crewel Lye"|"Piers Anthony"
