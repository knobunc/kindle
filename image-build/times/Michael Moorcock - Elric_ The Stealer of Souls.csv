00:00|Midnight|"“Midnight is long past,” growled one of the other armoured men who gathered around the blaze. “Are you still sure he’ll come?”"|"Elric_ The Stealer of Souls"|"Michael Moorcock"
"ap 01:00"|one|"Three soldiers entered the room in a bunch. Elric struck at one and sheared off half his face. The man screamed horribly."|"Elric_ The Stealer of Souls"|"Michael Moorcock"
00:00|midnight|"ABOVE THE ROLLING Earth great clouds tumbled down and bolts of lightning charged groundwards to slash the midnight black, split trees in twain and sear through roofs that cracked and broke."|"Elric_ The Stealer of Souls"|"Michael Moorcock"
12:00|Noon|"Noon was approaching, with a hint of weird disturbances in the bright-clouded sky, when they saw a long line of people coming towards them. They flattened themselves behind a small rise and peered cautiously over it as the party drew nearer. These were no enemy soldiers, but gaunt women and starving children, men who staggered in rags, and a few battered riders, obviously the remnants of some defeated band of partisans who had held out against Jagreen Lern."|"Elric_ The Stealer of Souls"|"Michael Moorcock"
12:00|noon|"“Soon after dawn we shall meet the Southern fleet,” Jagreen Lern smiled, “and by noon what is left of it will float as bloody driftwood behind us as we press on to establish our reign over those nations who so foolishly relied on their seapower as defense.”"|"Elric_ The Stealer of Souls"|"Michael Moorcock"
12:00|noon|"Kargan let out his breath and rose from the table. “There’s no more to discuss,” he said. “I’ll to bed. We must be ready to sail with the noon tide tomorrow.”"|"Elric_ The Stealer of Souls"|"Michael Moorcock"
"ap 01:00"|one|"Another tentacle dropped towards him, seeking to curl around the shield and seize him. Then another followed it and another. Elric hacked at one, severed its sensitive tip, saw another touch the shield, recoil and shrivel and then avoided the third in order to run round the deck and ascend, as swiftly as he could, the ladder leading to the deck above. Here he saw Jagreen Lern, his eyes wide. The Theocrat was clad in his familiar scarlet armour. On his arm was his buckler and in the same hand an axe, while his right hand held a broadsword. He glanced down at these weapons, obviously aware of their inadequacy against Elric’s."|"Elric_ The Stealer of Souls"|"Michael Moorcock"
"ap 01:00"|one|"With great effort he drew his sword as the first lance struck his shield and the rider passed, grinning, sensing Elric’s weakness. Others came on both sides. Weakly, he slashed at one and Stormbringer suddenly took control to make his aim true. The rider’s arm was pierced and he was locked to the blade as it fed, greedily, upon his lifestuff. Immediately, Elric felt some slight return of strength and realized that between them dragon and sword were helping him gain the energy he needed. But the blade kept the most part to itself. There was a reason for this, as Elric found out at once, for the sword continued to direct his arm. Several more riders were slain in this manner and Elric grinned as he felt the vitality flowing back into his body. His vision cleared, his reactions became normal, his spirits rose. Now he carried the attack to the rest of the division, Flamefang moving over the ground with a speed belying his bulk. The warriors scattered and fled back to rejoin the main force, but Elric no longer cared, he had the souls of a dozen of them and it was enough. “Now up, Flamefang! Rise and let us seek out more powerful enemies!”"|"Elric_ The Stealer of Souls"|"Michael Moorcock"
00:00|midnight|"There are dark battlefields where bloody men come screaming out of the night, black-cowled midnight horrors with fixed grins, ghastly wailing winged women running amok with their wings clipped, doom-laden seas where black, rat-infested warships fill the air with fireballs."|"Elric_ The Stealer of Souls"|"Michael Moorcock"
