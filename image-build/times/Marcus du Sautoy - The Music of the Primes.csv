The security of RSA depends on our inability to answer basic questions about prime numbers. Mathematicians know enough about the primes to build these Internet codes, but not enough to break them. We can understand one half of the equation but not the other. The more we demystify the primes, however, the less secure these Internet codes are becoming. These numbers are the keys to the locks that protect the world’s electronic secrets. This is why companies such as AT&T and Hewlett-Packard are ploughing money into endeavours to understand the subtleties of prime numbers and the Riemann Hypothesis. The insights gained could help to break these prime number codes, and all companies with an Internet presence want to be the first to know when their codes become insecure. And this is the reason why number theory and business have become such strange bedfellows. Business and security agencies are keeping a watchful eye on the blackboards of the pure mathematicians."|"The Music of the Primes"|"Marcus du Sautoy"

In 1997 Wiles picked up 75,000 Deutschmarks for his proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem, thanks to a prize offered in 1908 by Paul Wolfskehl. The story of the Wolfskehl Prize is what had brought Fermat to Wiles’s attention at the impressionable age of ten. Clay believes that if he can do the same for the Riemann Hypothesis, it will be a million dollars well spent. More recently, two publishing houses, Faber & Faber in the UK and Bloomsbury in the USA, offered a million dollars for a proof of Goldbach’s Conjecture as a publicity stunt to launch their publication of Apostolos Doxiadis’s novel Uncle Petros and Goldbach’s Conjecture. To earn the money you had to explain why every even number can be written as the sum of two prime numbers. However, the publishers didn’t give you much time to crack it. The solution had to be submitted before midnight on March 15, 2002, and was bizarrely open only to US and UK residents."|"The Music of the Primes"|"Marcus du Sautoy"

This was an idea, rather than a physical machine, that unleashed the possibility of doing arithmetic with numbers that had previously been considered too unwieldy. The clock calculator works on exactly the same principle as a conventional clock. If your clock says it’s 9 o’clock, and you add 4 hours, the hour hand moves round to 1 o’clock. Gauss’s clock calculator would therefore return the answer 1 rather than 13.

He introduced the idea of doing clock arithmetic, sometimes called modular arithmetic, with any number of hours on the clock face. So, for example, if you enter 11 into a clock calculator divided into 4 hours, the answer is 3 o’clock since 11 leaves remainder 3 on division by 4. Gauss’s account of this new sort of arithmetic revolutionised mathematics at the turn of the nineteenth century. Just as the telescope had allowed astronomers to see new worlds, the development of the clock calculator helped mathematicians to discover in the universe of numbers new patterns which had been hidden from view for generations. Even today, Gauss’s clocks are central to the security of the Internet, which utilises calculators whose clock faces bear more hours than there are atoms in the observable universe."|"The Music of the Primes"|"Marcus du Sautoy"

For all but their last year they remain in the ground feeding on the sap of tree roots. Then, in their last year, they metamorphose from nymphs into fully formed adults and emerge en masse from the ground. It is an extraordinary event as, every 17 years, Magicicada septendecim takes over the forest in a single night. They sing loudly, mate, eat, lay eggs, then die six weeks later.

03:41|"341 hours"|"Gauss’s schoolroom episode encapsulates the movement from guess via proof to theorem. Gauss had produced a formula which he predicted would produce any number you wanted on the list of triangular numbers. How could he guarantee that it would work every time? He certainly couldn’t test every number on the list to see whether his formula gave the correct answer, since the list is infinitely long. Instead, he resorted to the powerful weapon of mathematical proof. His method of combining two triangles to make a rectangle guaranteed, without the need for an infinite number of calculations, that the formula would always work. In contrast, the seventeenth-century prime number test based on 2 was finally thrown out of the mathematical court in 1819. The test works correctly for all numbers up to 340, but then declares that 341 is prime. This is where the test fails, since 341 = 11 × 31. This exception wasn’t discovered until Gauss’s clock calculator with 341 hours on the clock face could be used to simplify the analysis of a number like 2, which on a conventional calculator stretches to over a hundred digits."|"The Music of the Primes"|"Marcus du Sautoy"

As the French mathematician André Weil expressed it, ‘Rigour is to the mathematician what morality is to men.’ Part of the reason is that evidence is often quite hard to assess in mathematics. More than any other part of mathematics, the primes take a long time to reveal their true colours. Even Gauss was taken in by overwhelming data in support of a hunch he had about prime numbers, but theoretical analysis later revealed that he had been duped. This is why a proof is essential: first appearances can be deceptive.

Mathematics is a pyramid where each generation builds on the achievements of the last without fear of any collapse. This durability is what is so addictive about being a mathematician. For no science other than mathematics can we say that what the ancient Greeks established in their subject holds true today. We may scoff now at the Greeks’ belief that matter was made from fire, air, water and earth. Will future generations look back on the list of 109 atoms that make up Mendeleev’s Periodic Table of elements with as much disdain as we view the Greek model of the chemical world?

"~ 07:30"|"about prime"|"The middle part of Euclid’s Elements deals with the properties of numbers, and it is here that we find what many regard as the first truly brilliant piece of mathematical reasoning. In Proposition 20, Euclid explains a simple but fundamental truth about prime numbers: there are infinitely many of them. He begins with the fact that every number can be built by multiplying prime numbers together. On top of this he constructs his next proof. If these prime numbers are the building blocks of all numbers, is it possible, he asks himself, for there to be only a finite number of these building blocks? The Periodic Table of the chemical elements was constructed by Mendeleev, and in its present form it classifies 109 different atoms from which we can build all matter. Could the same be true for prime numbers?

But as Cambridge don Hardy liked to say, ‘Every fool can ask questions about prime numbers that the wisest man cannot answer.’ The Twin Primes Conjecture, for example, asks whether there are infinitely many primes p such that the number p + 2 is also prime. An example of such a pair is 1,000,037 and 1,000,039. (Note that this is the closest that two primes numbers can be, since N and N + 1 cannot both be prime – except when N = 2 – because at least one of these numbers is divisible by 2.) Might Sacks’s autistic-savant twins have had an extra facility for finding these twin primes? Euclid proved two millennia ago that there are infinitely many primes, but no one knows whether there might be some number beyond which there are no longer such close primes.

He had discovered that even if n was prime, it still annoyingly didn’t guarantee that his number 2 − 1 would be prime. He could calculate 2 − 1 by hand and get 2,047, which is 23 × 89. Generations of mathematicians marvelled at Mersenne’s ability to assert that a number as large as 2 − 1 was prime. This number has 77 digits.

He writes that many of the zeros appear on this straight line, and that it is ‘very likely’ that all of them do.

Although this had been known on the Continent since Riemann’s time, in England the connection between the zeta function and the primes was still unappreciated. Littlewood was thrilled by what he thought was a new link and in September 1907 he wrote it up for his dissertation in support of a research fellowship at Trinity.

Before Landau’s book, the story of Riemann and the primes was largely unknown in the broader mathematical community. As Hardy acknowledged in his obituary of Landau (jointly written with Hans Heilbronn), ‘The book transformed the subject, hitherto the hunting ground of a few adventurous heroes, into one of the most fruitful fields in the last thirty years.’ It would be Landau’s book that would in 1914 inspire Hardy to prove that infinitely many zeros sat on Riemann’s critical line.

At first he had experienced the frustration that most people feel when they try to tame this wild sequence of numbers. But Ramanujan knew how fundamental the primes were to mathematics and did not give up on his belief that there should be some mathematical formula which would explain them. He still innocently believed that all mathematics and its patterns could be expressed precisely by the power of equations and formulas. As Littlewood later explained, ‘How great a mathematician might Ramanujan have been 100 or 150 years ago; what would have happened if he had come into touch with Euler at the right moment? … But the great day of formulae seems to be over.’ Ramanujan, however, had not been subjected to the nineteenth- and twentieth-century shift induced by Riemann.
