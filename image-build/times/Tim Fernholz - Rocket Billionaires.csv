20:04|2004|"Never one to miss an opportunity for the limelight, Branson began drumming up business for Virgin Galactic with gusto. He sold tickets to space for $250,000 a seat, which he bought for himself and his family and then hawked to celebrities like Tom Hanks, Angelina Jolie, and Stephen Hawking. The first flights were expected to begin in 2007 from a new “spaceport” in New Mexico. Given the relative speed with which the Ansari X Prize had been won—less than eight years of work between announcement and achievement—commercializing the design seemed like a fairly trivial engineering problem. It was 2004, and the space age that Americans had been promised for decades finally seemed within grasp."|"Rocket Billionaires"|"Tim Fernholz"
06:00|"6:00 a.m."|"In one test cycle, the team ran out of liquid oxygen—half of the critical propellant needed to light the engine. A combination of a broken storage valve, unexpected high temperatures, and poor planning left them with nothing to do except charter more planes to fly to Hawaii for tanks of LOX. Another anecdote, relayed in a blog post written by Musk’s brother, Kimbal, during a visit to the “rocket island,” underlines the SpaceX team’s Herculean efforts. The electronic circuits that powered the Falcon 1’s computer systems were acting up, and the engineers decided to replace them. The rocket was pulled down and the circuit boards were removed and given to an avionics engineer, Bulent Altan, who flew back to California overnight. That same day—a Sunday—a SpaceX intern was dispatched by plane from California to Minnesota to pick up new components from a supplier. Altan and the intern met at SpaceX headquarters on Monday morning, assembled the circuits, tested them, and packed them up. Altan then flew back to Kwaj, landing at 6:00 a.m. to begin installing the new components and reconstructing the rocket. The total turnaround time for this mission, according to the younger Musk, was eighty hours."|"Rocket Billionaires"|"Tim Fernholz"

I go, ‘I have no idea what that means,’ and I’m working in the same area,” chief launch engineer Koenigsmann lamented. There were pitched battles over documentation, which for SpaceX meant dynamic electronic records, and for NASA copious redundant printouts. Sometimes it was simply about getting counterparts on the phone. “For other contractors or government organizations, you have to consider that there’s no way to call them after Friday at 3:00 p.m.,” Koenigsmann said. “There’s a lot going on here on Friday at 7:00 p.m. at SpaceX.”"|"Rocket Billionaires"|"Tim Fernholz"

02:00|"2 a.m."|"SpaceX had experimented with different techniques for loading propellant into the Falcon 9 throughout 2016. This led to launches being scrubbed at the last minute when pressures or temperatures were outside nominal levels. It was another shared challenge faced by rocket companies pushing the edges of performance: the technicians behind the computer-controlled plumbing that precisely fueled the Falcon 9 were distant cousins of the X Prize–winning flight engineers who awoke at 2 a.m. to slosh SpaceShipOne’s nitrous oxide around in a tank until it reached the correct temperature. Trial and error eventually left SpaceX with a process that, it seemed, could reliably load the superchilled propellant."|"Rocket Billionaires"|"Tim Fernholz"
00:00|"24.5 hours"|"For Mars advocates like Musk, the moon is insufficient for the broader goal of settling the solar system. It might be a nice place for an outpost, but you couldn’t call it home. “We could conceivably go to our moon, but I think it is challenging to become multiplanetary on the moon,” Musk said in 2016. “It is much smaller than a planet. It does not have any atmosphere. It is not as resource-rich as Mars. It has got a 28-day day, whereas the Mars day is 24.5 hours.”"|"Rocket Billionaires"|"Tim Fernholz"
"< 18:30"|"Just before 6:30 in the evening"|"As the operations team proceeded through the preflight checklist, everything seemed fine. No fast fires broke out during propellant loading. There were no last-minute pressure fluctuations or stuck valves to complicate the countdown. Just before 6:30 in the evening, with the sun setting behind it, Falcon 9’s flight computers took control and the rocket ignited. It pushed up through the atmosphere, producing the familiar tearing sound of rocket flight, as if the sky were being ripped open. Over a minute into flight, going more than a thousand miles per hour and still accelerating, the rocket passed through “max Q,” the moment when the thickness of the atmosphere put the highest stress on the rocket. If a strut were to tear loose or some other vital machinery were to give way, it would be now."|"Rocket Billionaires"|"Tim Fernholz"
