"ap 00:55"|"five to one"|"Holden surprised himself by laughing. “I’ve never seen Amos pick a fight he didn’t plan to win. I’m not sure what he had in mind, but even at five to one my money would be on him.”"|"Cibola Burn"|"James S. A. Corey"
"ap 03:00"|three|"“This isn’t two biomes coming together. It’s three. This… whatever it is? It doesn’t have any of the chemical or structural commonalities that you’d expect to see.”"|"Cibola Burn"|"James S. A. Corey"
"> 12:00"|"past midday"|"Holden noticed that a subtle darkening of the sky had begun. The sun was still high. It was barely past midday and into the early afternoon. But the sunlight was shifting toward red and the world was darkening along with it, as though a beautiful sunset were starting about five hours early. Something about the change sent a shiver up his spine."|"Cibola Burn"|"James S. A. Corey"
"ap 01:00"|one|"“Yeah,” Amos said, frowning down at one, “but, you know, gross. One of those things climbs into my sleeping bag, I’m gonna be pissed.”"|"Cibola Burn"|"James S. A. Corey"
12:00|noon|"The sky was the iron gray of an overcast noon. The rain had tapered off to a faint drizzle just heavy enough to keep his hair and clothes soaked and send rivulets of water down his spine. The wet ground sucked at his boot heels with each step. The air smelled of ozone and mud."|"Cibola Burn"|"James S. A. Corey"
12:00|noon|"Tick tick tick, hot like the sun on a dark shirt at noon. Burning without burning."|"Cibola Burn"|"James S. A. Corey"
"ap 04:00"|four|"At four, the displays on the consoles began to shift color, mapping the two ships, the tether lines, the engines in psychedelic false color. Basia was muttering under his breath, and it sounded like prayer. Naomi reached one."|"Cibola Burn"|"James S. A. Corey"
"ap 03:15"|"three hours and fifteen minutes"|"Basia gasped. Havelock turned, but it took a few seconds to see what the Belter was reacting to. The countdown timer – the death timer – had changed. The Barbapiccola was slated to burn in three hours and fifteen minutes. Four hours and forty-three minutes. Six hours and six minutes. It was working. As Havelock watched, the life span of everyone on the ship below him ballooned out. Havelock felt like shouting. It was working. It had no right at all to have worked, and it was working."|"Cibola Burn"|"James S. A. Corey"
"ap 04:43"|"Four hours and forty-three minutes"|"Basia gasped. Havelock turned, but it took a few seconds to see what the Belter was reacting to. The countdown timer – the death timer – had changed. The Barbapiccola was slated to burn in three hours and fifteen minutes. Four hours and forty-three minutes. Six hours and six minutes. It was working.

17:10|"seventeen hours and ten minutes"|"“That’s the shuttle.”
The death timer showed seventeen hours and ten minutes.
“The shuttle you turned into a fucking torpedo?” Basia asked. His voice was surprisingly calm."|"Cibola Burn"|"James S. A. Corey"
20:18|"Twenty hours and eighteen minutes"|"“PDCs are online, XO,” Alex said. “All I’ve got to do is put a little battery power to ’em, set ’em to automatic, and point defense can slag that thing before it comes close.”
Twenty hours and eighteen minutes.
“Power to the PDCs,” Naomi said. “Watch the tethers.”"|"Cibola Burn"|"James S. A. Corey"
12:00|noon|"In answer, all of the glowing sections of the robot intensified until the tunnel was as bright as noon. The reason for the material transfer cart’s stoppage became apparent. A couple dozen meters ahead, the metal tunnel was blown apart and filled with rocks and debris."|"Cibola Burn"|"James S. A. Corey"
00:00|midnight|"It was still the small hours of the morning – the long stretch between midnight and dawn – when they came to the structure. At first it was only a glittering in the darkness, like a bit of starfield. For a time, she thought it might be a break in the clouds. But the closer they came, the more obvious it became that it was something else."|"Cibola Burn"|"James S. A. Corey"
"ap 04:00"|Four|"“Sure, yes. Triangulation. I totally understand that,” Elvi said. “So. Four now.”"|"Cibola Burn"|"James S. A. Corey"
"ap 03:00"|three|"“Make it three,” Amos said, dragging himself into the room. “I got a ton of shit to fix because you guys let someone use my girl for target practice.”"|"Cibola Burn"|"James S. A. Corey"
