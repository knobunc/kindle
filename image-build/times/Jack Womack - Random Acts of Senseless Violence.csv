12:00|noon|"At noon I met Iz across the street who was already there. It was just as hot today as yesterday. Iz was wearing a halter and tight jeans that made her look fatter than she really is. ‘Where’s Jude and Weezie?’ I asked. ‘They partied bigtime last night and sleep like they dead’ Iz said. ‘Can’t hang waiting on them daylong I got to do right with my time. You eat?’ I shook my head. ‘Come on then not Chinese though I don’t want to eat cats’ she said and pulled a ten dollar bill from her pants pocket. It was quite a struggle. We walked around the corner on 125th Street and went to a Spanish restaurant. Iz ordered rice and beans at the counter and got two Cokes out of the machine. We sat in a booth away from the window brushing all the crumbs from the seats. A cockroach crawled over the table-top and Iz squashed it with her thumb and wiped it on her jeans."|"Random Acts of Senseless Violence"|"Jack Womack"
"ap < 10:00"|"almost ten"|"On local TV tonight they didn’t say anything about the riots right up the street. They interviewed a radio guy who said the homeless should be killed and the newswoman said really killed? and the radio guy said really killed. Then it showed the dog show. On the national news they talked about containing disturbances and they showed machine guns in front of the Capitol and the White House. There’s probably a lot going on that they’re not saying anything about. I didn’t say anything to Mama or Boob about how there was a riot going on just uptown because it would just get them all tizzied. Daddy didn’t get home until almost ten tonight. He said that it took an hour for the cashiers to get the drawers balanced because they kept giggling and losing count. Then he had to walk home because the buses weren’t running and the subway broke down because of problems they weren’t explaining. He was worn out and went right to bed. Just like I predicted Anne I don’t think he’s getting any writing done at all."|"Random Acts of Senseless Violence"|"Jack Womack"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"Iz waved when they saw me. ‘Girl you crazy what are you doing up here?’ Iz asked. ‘I wanted to see if I could find you’ I said. ‘You found.’ ‘What’s going on?’ I asked. ‘Invasion’ Weezie said. ‘Greenasses comin to slam us sinful Harlemites’ Jude said looking out at me from beneath her baseball cap. ‘Are the riots worse?’ I asked. I looked north but I didn’t see as much smoke as there usually is over Long Island lately. ‘No they just want to stick in the fear and twist it’ said Jude. ‘Curfew tonight at seven up here’ Weezie said. ‘You’re going to stay in?’ ‘We better’ said Iz. ‘Wait see how often and where and who they be shootin’ Weezie said. ‘What are you doing now?’ I asked. ‘Running Esther to Mickey’s feed her’ Jude said. ‘Esther say hello to Lola’ said Iz. Esther wasn’t as young as I thought but I’m sure she’s not any older than me Anne. She was wearing baggy gym shorts and a big shirt but she still looked like she swallowed a basketball. She’s as dark as Iz and has a little baby face except for a scar on one cheek. ‘We on fetus patrol for Esther make sure it pop out all right’ Iz said. ‘Come with us.’"|"Random Acts of Senseless Violence"|"Jack Womack"

Cool?’ Jude asked. ‘Sure.’ It made me feel important somehow that Jude was inviting me to come out. Important’s not the right word but you know what I mean. ‘Preacher gets drymouth by two’ Iz said. ‘Once we done holy rolling I run home change and fastfoot it over.’ Jude nodded."|"Random Acts of Senseless Violence"|"Jack Womack"

I didn’t feel right taking them from Esther because she seemed so hungry and pregnant besides but the way Weezie said it I thought I better have a couple. Then Weezie and Esther and Iz talked about boys they knew at school and the stupid things they’d done. I didn’t pay much attention and I don’t think Jude did either. She was looking out the window for a while at the people going by and I started looking too. After a minute or so I saw she was looking at me and I smiled. She smiled too. Jude’s lost her top teeth on both sides but the ones she has in front are as big and white as Iz’s. It made me feel good when she smiled at me, Anne. Right now’s the first time I’ve been thinking about those stupid girls at school and that’s only because they seem even stupider in comparison to Jude and Iz. It was six thirty when we finished eating. The Army went wherever they were going. ‘I call you’ Jude said and then the girls walked back uptown."|"Random Acts of Senseless Violence"|"Jack Womack"

The local news had gone off so we switched the TV over to CNN. The style show was on though so they didn’t say anything till seven when it was time for the national news. ‘Chrissie’s right’ Mama kept saying and shaking her head. ‘No she’s not’ I said because I knew how much Chrissie had upset her this morning. ‘She is my angel she’d be sitting there all smug and happy like a fat frog if she were here saying look see I’m right as always’ Mama said. ‘She’s not though and she’s not right either’ I said. ‘I’m afraid she is my angel oh she is’ Mama said so I didn’t say anything else.

I didn’t do anything to them but I didn’t do anything to Weez or Jude either and look at how they acted. Now I don’t even want to be around them because of the way Weez acts. I still feel Weezie’s spit on my face and I know I always will. It scares me Anne because when I think about what she did I get so mad I can’t even think. That’s not good because one thing I’ve always prided myself on is that it used to be I can think when everybody else is going crazy. It’s getting harder and harder though.

After I got home from school yesterday I packed an overnight bag and had a snack of bologna sandwiches. Friday at last! I was supposed to meet Iz at six at the corner and was ready by four thirty. Boob was taking a bath and Mama was in the kitchen proofreading a manuscript while the chicken they were having for dinner was in the oven baking. Daddy was off work yesterday and sitting in the front room looking through a picture book of Europe. Would you like to look at the places we’ve been with me? he asked when he saw me. ‘Sure’ I said and sat down next to him. He was looking at a picture of Berlin.

Iz had just finished eating her sandwich when her mother said ‘Isabel come in here I want to talk to you.’ Iz rolled her eyes and told me to just sit and wait till she came back. I heard them shut a door but if they didn’t want me to know they were arguing it didn’t do any good. I could hear them yelling but I couldn’t hear what they were saying. After five minutes or so I heard the door open and a minute later Iz came back in the kitchen with my bag and a plastic bag she’d stuffed some clothes into. ‘Lola we going’ she said looking at the clock on the wall. ‘What’s wrong?’ ‘Six thirty curfew soon come on’ Iz said handing me my bag. I stood up and followed her through the living room. ‘Don’t you be stomping out of here like this’ her mother was saying from her bedroom. ‘We stay at Jude’s then. I tell you it’s not right’ Iz shouted back. ‘Jesus God child they’ll shoot you on the street it’s not safe’ her mother said. ‘I know’ said Iz pulling me out by the arm. ‘Isabel’ her mother said but Iz slammed the door behind her."|"Random Acts of Senseless Violence"|"Jack Womack"

For a while this morning I sat at my desk finishing reading Tess and Boob came over and hugged me. ‘What’s that for?’ I asked her but she didn’t say anything and wouldn’t let go. ‘Answer me Boob’ I said. ‘When are we going home?’ she asked. ‘We are home Boob.’ ‘When are we really going home?’ ‘What did I just say Boob?’ She let go and curled up on the bed grabbing her My L’il Fetus which now has no arms and only half of one leg. ‘What’s wrong Boob please tell me’ I said. ‘Nothing’ she said."|"Random Acts of Senseless Violence"|"Jack Womack"

Mama said Daddy told her that Mister Mossbacher grabbed him by the shirt and screamed at him in the store for five minutes in front of everybody and all the customers Anne and told him he was going to have to work six days every week until he quit. He also said that if Daddy quit before then he’d have to pay Mister Mossbacher the overtime salary he’d have to give other people who had to fill in for him. Daddy can’t do that of course so he has to stay another whole month working till one in the morning and hearing Mister Mossbacher scream constant. That’s so unfair Anne but there’s nothing Daddy can do. If there’s anyone I hate as much as I hate Weez it’s Mister Mossbacher."|"Random Acts of Senseless Violence"|"Jack Womack"

Boob was already tucked and Daddy didn’t home it until one thanks to deadhead Mister Mossbacher. We opened the sofa bed and put fresh sheets and pillows on the mattress which is lumpy but better than Jude’s. It wasn’t as hot as it’s been but we took off our clothes anyway. Mama left the hall light on so Daddy wouldn’t have to radar when he homed in so it was dark in the living room but light enough we could see each other’s faces when we talked and kissed. Anne it was so nice just lying in bed with Iz holding and petting each other like kittens. If I closed my eyes it was like I was touching myself but I wasn’t I was touching Iz which is a weird feeling but good.

Iz sat up holding the sheet in front of her. ‘Who plugged you in last night?’ Boob asked looking at Iz. Iz’s hair was sticking up in places and some of her dreads were bent. We all started laughing. ‘Now go away Boob’ I said and she did. I was glad she was acting like her old self again. Me and Iz put our shirts on under the covers and then we got up and Mama fixed breakfast for us before she went home.

Outside it’s been dark daylong the past two the smoke heavies so. Cars and buses keep their lights on at noon. Boob and Mama cough constant and spit black sometimes. We keep the windows shut when we can but it’s so hot we have to open them come night. The heat made Daddy’s computer crash.

They’d banked and brought us two big bags of groceries including bologna and cheese and bread and milk and toilet tissue and much more. ‘You be hostin us we got to supply’ Jude said unpacking the groceries.

Then I shoved back going over under aiming sideways. The copters started buzzing and strafing and there was nowhere they didn’t aim even shooting out the glass in the buildings. Everybody pressed so my feet lost their boots. I was thoughtless Anne there was nothing doable but haul and fly whoever I stomped getting out and I did. I punched back when I got punched and kicked and cursed and finally sidewalked myself. I came out on the west side by the Bible Society building which was all shot up and started eyeing round for Iz and Jude. The cops started north clubbing handy heads and shouting through their bullhorns yelling go to your homes go to your homes while they swung. I sided myself against the building watching blueboys beat and maim and marchers drop and tumble. It nervestrings me now rethinking it Anne but just then I froze myself unable to move I was so hopped. Soon I thought I was safed cause Broadway started emptying mostly. Hundreds must have headed parkways but there were plenty more still lying there. The street wasn’t seeable because of the bodies shot and stomped flat. The copters kept swooping down shooting and the blueboys kept swinging and then Army trucks and hummers brought up the rear aiming north. Some Army boys packed bazookas and flamethrowers and I couldn’t believe they used them but I spec they did. Every siren citywide must have been awail. Then I saw a stupefying thing Anne. Through the midst of everything a limo drove through aiming uptown. It passed broad as day on Broadway like nada troubled bumping over the streeted bodies like potholes.

Anyway we were ready to go at nine o’clock yesterday morning but VanMan didn’t show. Daddy called twice from the lobby and got VanMan’s machine both times. We disconnected our phone in the apartment so we could transfer the number and so the new guy moving in could get his own phone. Anyway VanMan finally showed up at eleven thirty. I could hardly keep from laughing out loud when I first saw him and Boob was giggling so hard she couldn’t stop. He was this ugly old hippie Anne and he was wearing a Grateful Dead T-shirt. Our doorman wouldn’t have ever let him even sleep in the gutter in front of our building because he was too bummy. Daddy said he was late and VanMan said he’d hit a bad flow."|"Random Acts of Senseless Violence"|"Jack Womack"
"ap 09:30"|"Nine thirty"|"Great start to the week LIE. Boob and I left this morning at eight right after Daddy. We wanted to try to get to school before nine. When do you think we got there? Nine thirty. Everything went wrong of course."|"Random Acts of Senseless Violence"|"Jack Womack"
"ap 05:00"|five|"We went back to her apartment. Katherine’s parents weren’t home yet so we sat in the living room and listened to tapes on the good player. At five she started getting nervy and said we better stop because they’d be home soon and she didn’t want them to catch us. ‘Catch us what?’ I asked. ‘Doing anything in here’ Katherine said. Well as it turned out her mother didn’t get home until almost six. She fixed us Lean Cuisines in the microwave. We hadn’t eaten dinner because we were still full of pizza. I had chicken cacciatore and Katherine had chicken amandine. They were awful but I’ve had worse."|"Random Acts of Senseless Violence"|"Jack Womack"
"ap > 10:00"|"after ten"|"I got distracted popping a zit on my chin in the mirror and fiddled at the mirror for five minutes. After I washed my face I sat down to pee. I was putting in a new tampoon to be on the safe side when I saw the toilet paper wasn’t in the lock hole anymore! Oh Anne it wasn’t on the floor either. I stood up and went to the door and opened it but nobody was in the hall. It was dark and all the lights were out except in the bathroom and the living room down the hall. I heard Katherine groaning like she was having a bad dream. I almost went into her room to see if she was all right since I knew her door didn’t lock. Then I got more scared and didn’t. I ran back to the living room and pulled the blanket over me. It was too psycho but it was after ten and too late for me to go home unless I took a taxi and I didn’t have taxi money. It was quiet the rest of the night but it didn’t help me get to sleep. Finally I passed out but I don’t know when, it was late."|"Random Acts of Senseless Violence"|"Jack Womack"
12:00|noon|"Daddy had to work today I discovered because one of the other managers was fired. He has to go to work tomorrow at noon too. Mister Mossbacher is making out a new schedule for him Mama says. She didn’t look very happy about it and she didn’t say anything else about it."|"Random Acts of Senseless Violence"|"Jack Womack"
"ap 07:48"|"twelve to eight"|"Mister Mossbacher told Daddy his new schedule. He’ll be working weekends during the day twelve to eight and during the week from four to midnight. He’s off on Tuesdays and Fridays. Daddy says it should work out fine because he’ll be able to get more writing done but I don’t think he believes it. I know I don’t. Mama didn’t seem happy about it but she didn’t say anything. What could she say?"|"Random Acts of Senseless Violence"|"Jack Womack"

"ap 11:00"|eleven|"Usually you get short shrift from me during the week Anne but not tonight. I have to write and tell you what happened today because I feel like I’m ready to explode if I don’t. I hope Daddy gets home soon but it’s only eleven and with his new schedule he won’t even finish working for another hour."|"Random Acts of Senseless Violence"|"Jack Womack"
"ap 04:30"|"four thirty"|"We got to Excelsior at four thirty. It’s a big store but it was packed like Christmas. Before we could go in we had to stand in line with everybody else while the guards looked in everybody’s bags and purses. People were complaining and whining. One man was yelling at the guards and they just looked at him like he was crazy. Finally we got inside and we found Daddy at the information counter where he and another fellow were surrounded by shouting customers. Eventually he got somebody to replace him at the counter and he came out with the book Mama wanted. ‘Oh Michael dearest thank you can we take it right up to the cash register?’ Mama asked but Daddy said no he had to take it back to Mister Mossbacher to have the employee purchase forms he’d filled out signed or otherwise he couldn’t get her the discount. So we followed Daddy down the aisle toward the back of the store."|"Random Acts of Senseless Violence"|"Jack Womack"
00:00|midnight|"Anyway that’s what happened and why I haven’t had a chance to write before now. Daddy’s still not home. Even though Excelsior closes at midnight he has to be there for another hour until they finish waxing the floor and then it’s another half hour before he gets home even if the subway shows up on time, which it hardly ever does that late."|"Random Acts of Senseless Violence"|"Jack Womack"
"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"Even before noon it was ninety degrees today and so humid that everything was dripping like a sponge. Everything smelled like rotten garbage too like it always does in New York every summer. If I’m not in New York I love summer but I hate it when I am. When it’s humid like it always is the back of my neck is always wet and I have to wash my hair twice a day sometimes just because otherwise it feels like I’m wearing bacon on my head it gets so greasy."|"Random Acts of Senseless Violence"|"Jack Womack"
"ap 11:30"|"eleven thirty"|"After Daddy left for work at eleven thirty I went outside. Mama had new manuscripts to proofread and Boob was watching cartoons. We all slept until ten since it’s the weekend and it’s so hard to get out of bed when you don’t have to especially when it’s this hot. I didn’t want to be miserable so I just wore sandals and a muscle T and an old pair of cutoff jeans. ‘Sweetie where are you going?’ Mama asked me. ‘Just out’ I said. ‘Bad boys will be whistling at you my angel you look like such a little cookie’ she said. ‘I’m not a cookie it’s hot out’ I said. ‘Be careful sweetie don’t fall prey’ Mama said. ‘I won’t’ I said."|"Random Acts of Senseless Violence"|"Jack Womack"
12:00|noontime|"At 110th Street they headed down into the subway. ‘We gotta go to the bank’ Jude said. ‘Meeting folks downtown.’ ‘You around tomorrow?’ Iz asked me. I nodded. ‘Be outside the Chinese place cross Broadway noontime’ she said. ‘Okay’ I said and then she ran after Jude and Weezie. I walked further downtown and then came back along Riverside because I didn’t want to see those boys if they were still hanging out on Broadway. I wanted to go to a movie or a museum or something but where’s the money so there wasn’t anything to do except walk around. Riverside Park always looks so scary not like Central Park at all. There were police cars parked along the street at 116th and there were police all over the place. I didn’t know what had happened but I was glad it didn’t happen to me."|"Random Acts of Senseless Violence"|"Jack Womack"
