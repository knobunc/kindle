Nurse O’Halloran tells my grandmother, Pray to St. Jude, patron saint of desperate cases.  St. Jude, patron of desperate cases, help me. I’m desperate. She grunts and pushes and the infant’s head appears, only the head, my mother, and it’s the stroke of midnight, the New Year. Limerick City erupts with whistles, horns, sirens, brass bands, people calling and singing, Happy New Year. Should auld acquaintance be forgot, and church bells all over ring out the Angelus and Nurse O’Halloran weeps for the waste of a dress, that child still in there and me in me finery. Will you come out, child, will you? Grandma gives a great push and the child is in the world, a lovely girl with black curly hair and sad blue eyes."|"Angela's Ashes"|"Frank McCourt"

12:00|noon|"A man on a bicycle stopped and wanted to know why Dad was beating that mattress. Mother o’ God, he said, I never heard such a cure for fleas. Do you know that if a man could jump like a flea one lep would take him halfway to the moon? The thing to do is this, when you go back inside with that mattress stick it on the bed upside down and that will confuse the little buggers. They won’t know where they are and they’ll be biting the mattress or each other,
 which is the best cure of all. After they bite the human being they have the frenzy, you know, for there are other fleas around them that also bit the human being and the smell of the blood is too much for them and they go out of their minds. They’re a right bloody torment an’ I should know for didn’t I grow up in Limerick, down in the Irishtown, an’ the fleas there were so plentiful an’ forward they’d sit on the toe of your boot an’ discuss Ireland’s woeful history with you. It is said there were no fleas in ancient Ireland, that they were brought in be the English to drive us out of our wits entirely, an’ I wouldn’t put it past the English. An’ isn’t it a very curious thing that St. Patrick drove the snakes out of Ireland an’ the English brought in the fleas. For centuries Ireland was a lovely peaceful place, snakes gone, not a flea to be found. You could stroll the four green fields of Ireland without fear of snakes an’ have a good night’s sleep with no fleas to bother you. Them snakes were doin’ no harm, they wouldn’t bother you unless you cornered them an’ they lived off other creatures that move under bushes an’ such places, whereas the flea sucks the blood from you mornin’ noon an’ night for that’s his nature an’ he can’t help himself. I hear for a fact that places that have snakes galore have no fleas. Arizona, for instance. You’re forever hearing about the snakes of Arizona but when did you ever hear of fleas in Arizona? Good luck to you. I have to be careful standin’ here for if one of them gets on my clothes I might as well invite his whole family home. They multiply faster than Hindus."|"Angela's Ashes"|"Frank McCourt"

"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"When he’s not looking for work Dad goes for long walks, miles into the country. He asks farmers if they need any help, that he grew up on a farm and can do anything. If they hire him he goes to work right away with his cap on and his collar and tie. He works so hard and long the farmers have to tell him to stop. They wonder how a man can work through a long hot day with no thought of food or drink. Dad smiles. He never brings home the money he earns on farms. That money seems to be different from the dole, which is supposed to be brought home. He takes the farm money to the pub and drinks it. If he’s not home when the Angelus rings at six o’clock Mam knows he had a day of work. She hopes he might think of his family and pass the pub even once, but he never does. She hopes he might bring home something from the farm, potatoes, cabbage, turnips, carrots, but he’ll never bring home anything because he’d never stoop so low as to ask a farmer for anything. Mam says ’tis all right for her to be begging at the St.Vincent de Paul Society for a docket for food but he can’t stick a few spuds in his pocket. He says it’s different for a man. You have to keep the dignity. Wear your collar and tie, keep up the appearance, and never ask for anything. Mam says, I hope it keeps fine for you. When the farm money is gone he rolls home singing and crying over Ireland and his dead children, mostly about Ireland. If he sings Roddy McCorley, it means he had only the price of a pint or two. If he sings Kevin Barry, it means he had a good day, that he is now falling down drunk and ready to get us out of bed, line us up and make us promise to die for Ireland, unless Mam tells him leave us alone or she’ll brain him with the poker."|"Angela's Ashes"|"Frank McCourt"

Mam tells Bridey Hannon that Dad can’t be like that and won’t be like that. She says he’s a right bloody fool the way he goes to pubs and stands pints to other men while his own children are home with their bellies stuck to their backbones for the want of a decent dinner. He’ll brag to the world he did his bit for Ireland when it was neither popular nor profitable, that he’ll gladly die for Ireland when the call comes, that he regrets he has only one life to give for his poor misfortunate country and if anyone disagrees they’re invited to step outside and settle this for once and for all. Oh, no, says Mam, they won’t disagree and they won’t step outside, that bunch of tinkers and knackers and begrudgers that hang around the pubs. They tell him he’s a grand man, even if he’s from the North, and ’twould be an honor to accept a pint from such a patriot. Mam tells Bridey, I don’t know under God what I’m going to do.

In our house we have a fireplace in Ireland downstairs and a fireplace in Italy upstairs and no sign of a damper. Then you go to your aunt’s house and you’re supposed to know all about dampers. There’s no use telling her this is the first time you ever lit a fire in a range. She’ll just give you another thump on the skull and send you flying. It’s hard to know why grown people get so angry over little things like dampers. When I’m a man I won’t go around thumping small children over dampers or anything else.

He’s paid from eight in the morning till half five in the evening though he has to get the horse ready well before eight and settle him for the night well after half five. He’s up and down on that float all day hoisting bags of coal and turf, desperate to keep the bandages in place on his legs so the dirt won’t get into the open sores. The bandages are forever sticking and have to be ripped away and when he comes home she washes the sores with warm water and soap, covers them with ointment and wraps them in clean bandages. They can’t afford new bandages every day so she keeps washing the old ones over and over till they’re gray. Mam says Mr. Hannon should see the doctor and Mrs. Hannon says, Sure, he seen the doctor a dozen times and the doctor says he has to stay off them legs. That’s all. Stay off them legs. Sure how can he stay off them legs? He has to work. What would we live on if he didn’t work?"|"Angela's Ashes"|"Frank McCourt"

Mr. Hannon takes his pipe from his mouth and tells me this is the best morning of all, Saturday, half day. We’ll start at eight and be finished by the time the Angelus rings at twelve."|"Angela's Ashes"|"Frank McCourt"

12:00|noon|"The legs are getting so bad he has to get up an hour earlier in the morning to get the stiffness out, to put on another dressing. It’s still dark one Saturday morning when Mrs. Hannon knocks at our door and asks me if I’d go to a neighbor and borrow their handcart to take on the float for Mr. Hannon will never be able to carry the bags today and maybe I’d just roll them on the handcart for him. He won’t be able to carry me on his bicycle so I can meet him at the yard with the handcart. The neighbor says, Anything for Mr. Hannon, God bless him. I wait at the gate of the coal yard and watch him cycle toward me, slower than ever. He’s so stiff he can hardly get off the bike and he says, You’re a great man, Frankie. He lets me get the horse ready though I still have trouble getting on the harness. He lets me handle the float out of the yard and into the frosty streets and I wish I could drive forever and never go home. Mr. Hannon shows me how to pull the bags to the edge of the float and drop them on the ground so that I can pull them on to the handcart and push them to the houses. He tells me how to lift and push the bags without straining myself and we have the sixteen bags delivered by noon."|"Angela's Ashes"|"Frank McCourt"
"< 00:00"|"near midnight"|"Now it’s near midnight and cold on the empty platform. A man in a railway cap asks us if we’d like to wait in a warm place. Mam says, Thank you very much, and laughs when he leads us to the end of the platform where we have to climb a ladder to the signal tower. It takes her a while because she’s heavy and she keeps saying, Oh, God, oh, God."|"Angela's Ashes"|"Frank McCourt"
"~ 16:30"|vespers|"When the play finishes she lets me fiddle with the knob on the radio and I roam the dial for distant sounds on the shortwave band, strange whispering and hissing, the whoosh of the ocean coming and going and the Morse Code dit dit dit dot. I hear mandolins, guitars, Spanish bagpipes, the drums of Africa, boatmen wailing on the Nile. I see sailors on watch sipping mugs of hot cocoa. I see cathedrals, skyscrapers, cottages. I see Bedouins in the Sahara and the French Foreign Legion, cowboys on the American prairie. I see goats skipping along the rocky coast of Greece where the shepherds are blind because they married their mothers by mistake. I see people chatting in cafés, sipping wine, strolling on boulevards and avenues. I see night women in doorways, monks chanting vespers, and here is the great boom of Big Ben, This is the BBC Overseas Service and here is the news. Mrs. Purcell says, Leave that on, Frankie, so we’ll know the state of the world."|"Angela's Ashes"|"Frank McCourt"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"Grandma tells Mam she’s going home. She’s tired and drenched and she’s not twenty-five anymore. She says there’s no need to be taking beds or furniture with all the stuff that’s up in Laman Griffin’s. We put Alphie in the pram and pile around him the pot, the pan, the kettle, the jam jars and mugs, the Pope, two bolsters and the coats from the beds. We drape the coats over our heads and push the pram through the streets. Mam tells us be quiet going up the lane or the neighbors will know we got the eviction and there will be shame. The pram has a bockety wheel which tilts it and makes it go in different directions. We try to keep it straight and we’re having a great time because it must be after midnight and surely Mam won’t make us go to school tomorrow. We’re moving so far from Leamy’s School now maybe we’ll never have to go again. Once we get away from the lane Alphie bangs on the pot with the spoon and Michael sings a song he heard in a film with Al Jolson, Swanee, how I love ya, how I love ya, my dear ol’ Swanee. He makes us laugh the way he tries to sing in a deep voice like Al Jolson. Mam says she’s glad it’s late and there’s no one on the streets to see our shame."|"Angela's Ashes"|"Frank McCourt"
13:00|"one in the afternoon"|"Laman Griffin comes home at six every night but Friday, has his tea and goes to bed till next morning. Saturdays he goes to bed at one in the afternoon and stays there till Monday morning. He pulls the kitchen table over to the wall under the loft, climbs up on a chair, pulls the chair up to the table, climbs up on the chair again, catches a leg of the bed, pulls himself up. If he’s too drunk on Fridays he makes me climb up for his pillow and blankets and sleeps on the kitchen floor by the fire or falls into bed with me and my brothers and snores and farts all night. When we first moved in he complained over how he gave up his room downstairs for the loft and he’s worn out climbing up and down to go to the lavatory in the backyard. He calls down, Bring the table, the chair, I’m coming down, and we have to clear off the table and pull it to the wall. He’s fed up, he’s finished with the climbing, he’s going to use his mother’s lovely chamber pot. He lies in bed all day reading books from the library, smoking Gold Flake cigarettes and throwing Mam a few shillings to send one of us to the shop so that he can have scones with his tea or a nice bit of ham and sliced tomato. Then he calls to Mam, Angela, this chamber pot is full,and she drags chair and table to climb for the chamber pot,empty it in the lavatory outside, rinse it and climb back to the loft. Her face gets tight and she says, Is there anything else your lordship would like this day?"|"Angela's Ashes"|"Frank McCourt"
"ap 05:00"|five|"I have to look decent for my job so I take off all my clothes and stand naked in the backyard washing them under the tap with a bar of carbolic soap. I hang them on Grandma’s clothesline, shirt, gansey, pants, stockings, and pray to God it won’t rain, pray they’ll be dry for tomorrow, which is the start of my life. I can’t go anywhere in my pelt so I stay in bed all day reading old newspapers, getting excited with the girls in the  News of the World  and thanking God for the drying sun. The Abbot comes home at five and makes tea downstairs and even though I’m hungry I know he’ll grumble if I ask him for anything. He knows the one thing that worries me is he might go to Aunt Aggie and complain I’m staying in Grandma’s house and sleeping in her bed and if Aunt Aggie hears that she’ll come over and throw me into the street."|"Angela's Ashes"|"Frank McCourt"
"ap 08:30"|"half-past eight"|"It’s hard to sleep when you know the next day you’re fourteen and starting your first job as a man. The Abbot wakes at dawn moaning. Would I ever make him some tay and if I do I can have a big cut of bread from the half loaf in his pocket which he was keeping there out of the way of the odd rat and if I look in Grandma’s gramophone where she used to keep the records I’ll find a jar of jam. He can’t read, he can’t write, but he knows where to hide the jam. I bring The Abbot his tea and bread and make some for myself. I put on my damp clothes and get into the bed hoping that if I stay there the clothes will dry from my own heat before I go to work. Mam always says it’s the damp clothes that give you the consumption and an early grave. The Abbot is sitting up telling me he has a terrible pain in his head from a dream where I was wearing his poor mother’s black dress and she flying around screaming, Sin, sin, ’tis a sin. He finishes his tea and falls into a snore sleep and I wait for his clock to say half-past eight, time to get up and be at the post office at nine even if the clothes are still damp on my skin."|"Angela's Ashes"|"Frank McCourt"
12:00|noon|"Mrs. O’Connell knows I like the country telegrams and if a day is sunny she gives me a batch of ten that will keep me away all morning and I don’t have to return till after the dinner hour at noon. There are fine autumn days when the Shannon sparkles and the fields are green and glinting with silver morning dew. Smoke blows across fields and there’s the sweet smell of turf fires. Cows and sheep graze in the fields and I wonder if these are the beasts the priest was talking about. I wouldn’t be surprised because there’s no end to the bulls climbing on cows, rams on sheep, stallions on mares, and they all have such big things it makes me break out in a sweat to look at them and I feel sorry for all the female creatures in the world who have to suffer like that though I wouldn’t mind being a bull myself because they can do what they like and it’s never a sin for an animal. I wouldn’t mind going at myself here but you never know when a farmer might come along the road driving cows and sheep to a fair or to another field raising his stick and bidding you, Good day, young fella, grand morning, thank God and His Blessed Mother. A farmer that religious might be offended if he saw you breaking the Sixth Commandment forninst his field. Horses like to stick their heads over fences and hedges to see what’s passing by and I stop and talk to them because they have big eyes and long noses that show how intelligent they are. Sometimes two birds will be singing to each other across a field and I have to stop and listen to them and if I stay long enough more birds will join till every tree and bush is alive with birdsong. If there’s a stream gurgling under a bridge on the road, birds singing and cows mooing and lambs baaing, that’s better than any band in a film. The smell of dinner bacon and cabbage wafting from a farmhouse makes me so weak with the hunger I climb into a field and stuff myself with blackberries for half an hour. I stick my face into the stream and drink icy water that’s better than the lemonade in any fish and chip shop."|"Angela's Ashes"|"Frank McCourt"
12:00|noon|"Gerry is making a last delivery at Easons kiosk at the railway station at noon on Saturday and that’s handy because I can meet him there to get the bicycle and he can meet Rose off the train.We stand at the gate waiting and he tells me he hasn’t seen Rose in a year. She’s over there working in a pub in Bristol and he doesn’t like that one bit because the English are forever pawing the Irish girls, hands up under the skirts and worse, and the Irish girls are afraid to say anything for fear of losing their jobs. Everyone knows Irish girls keep themselves pure especially Limerick girls known the world over for their purity who have a man to come back to like Gerry Halvey himself. He’ll be able to tell if she was true to him by her walk. If a girl comes back after a year with a certain class of a walk that’s different from the one she went away with then you know she was up to no good with the Englishmen dirty horny bastards that they are."|"Angela's Ashes"|"Frank McCourt"
