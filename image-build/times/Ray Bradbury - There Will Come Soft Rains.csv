It was raining outside. The weather box on the front door sang quietly: “Rain, rain, go away; rubbers, raincoats for today …” And the rain tapped on the empty house, echoing."|"There Will Come Soft Rains"|"Ray Bradbury"

An aluminum wedge scraped them into the sink, where hot water whirled them down a metal throat which digested and flushed them away to the distant sea. The dirty dishes were dropped into a hot washer and emerged twinkling dry."|"There Will Come Soft Rains"|"Ray Bradbury"

Nine-fifteen, sang the clock, time to clean.
Out of warrens in the wall, tiny robot mice darted. The rooms were acrawl with the small cleaning animals, all rubber and metal. They thudded against chairs, whirling their mustached runners, kneading the rug nap, sucking gently at hidden dust. Then, like mysterious invaders, they popped into their burrows. Their pink electric eyes faded. The house was clean."|"There Will Come Soft Rains"|"Ray Bradbury"

The water pelted windowpanes running down the charred west side where the house had been burned evenly free of its white paint. The entire west face of the house was black, save for five places.

Bridge tables sprouted from patio walls. Playing cards fluttered onto pads in a shower of pips. Martinis manifested on an oaken bench with egg-salad sandwiches. Music played."|"There Will Come Soft Rains"|"Ray Bradbury"
