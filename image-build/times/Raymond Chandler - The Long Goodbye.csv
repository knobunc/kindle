"ap 09:30"|nine-thirty|"The phone rang at nine-thirty and the voice that spoke was one I had heard before."|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"It was five o’clock of a wet March evening when he walked into my down-at-heels brain emporium. He looked changed. Older, very sober and severe and beautifully calm. He looked like a guy who had learned to roll with a punch. He wore an oyster-white raincoat and gloves and no hat and his white hair was as smooth as a bird’s breast."|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 08:15"|eight-fifteen|"“We have dinner at eight-fifteen,” he said. “Only millionaires can afford it. Only millionaires’ servants will stand for it nowadays. Lots of lovely people coming.”"|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap ~ 05:00"|"around five o’clock"|"From then on it got to be a sort of habit with him to drop in around five o’clock. We didn’t always go to the same bar, but oftener to Victor’s than anywhere else. It may have had some association for him that I didn’t know about. He never drank too much, and that surprised him."|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap > 04:00"|"just after four o’clock"|"The last time we had a drink in a bar was in May and it was earlier than usual, just after four o’clock. He looked tired and thinner but he looked around with a slow smile of pleasure."|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
05:00|"five o’clock in the morning"|"I didn’t see him again for a month. When I did it was five o’clock in the morning and just beginning to get light. The persistent ringing of the doorbell yanked me out of bed. I plowed down the hall and across the living room and opened up. He stood there looking as if he hadn’t slept for a week. He had a light topcoat on with the collar turned up and he seemed to be shivering. A dark felt hat was pulled down over his eyes."|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 10:15"|ten-fifteen|"“You’re driving me to Tijuana to get a plane at ten-fifteen,” he said. “I have a passport and visa and I’m all set except for transportation. For certain reasons I can’t take a train or a bus or a plane from L.A. Would five hundred bucks be a reasonable taxi fare?”"|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 10:15"|Ten-fifteen|"“What the hell’s the matter with me sleeping such a lovely morning away? Ten-fifteen, huh? Well, there’s plenty of time. Let’s go out to the kitchen and I’ll brew some coffee.”"|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
12:00|noon|"“Listen,” he said, “it will be noon or even later before anybody knocks at the door. The help knows better than to disturb her when she sleeps late. But by about noon her maid would knock and go in. She wouldn’t be in her room.”"|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"“Listen,” he said, “it will be noon or even later before anybody knocks at the door. The help knows better than to disturb her when she sleeps late. But by about noon her maid would knock and go in. She wouldn’t be in her room.”"|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 10:15"|ten-fifteen|"“She’s quite a dish,” I said. I looked at my watch. “Just why does it have to be the ten-fifteen at Tijuana?”"|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"It was two o’clock when I got back and they were waiting for me in a dark sedan with no police tags, no red light, only the double antenna, and not only police cars have those. I was halfway up the steps before they came out of it and yelled at me, the usual couple in the usual suits, with the usual stony leisure of movement, as if the world was waiting hushed and silent for them to tell it what to do."|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
22:00|"ten P.M."|"“In here, mister, a dick license don’t mean any more than a calling card. Now let’s have your statement, verbal at first. We’ll take it down later. Make it complete. Let’s have, say, a full account of your movements since ten P.M. last night. I mean full. This office is investigating a murder and the prime suspect is missing. You connect with him. Guy catches his wife cheating and beats her head to raw flesh and bone and bloodsoaked hair. Our old friend the bronze statuette. Not original but it works. You think any goddam private eye is going to quote law at me over this, mister, you got a hell of a tough time coming your way. There ain’t a police force in the country could do its job with a law book. You got information and I want it. You could of said no and I could of not believed you. But you didn’t even say no. You’re not dummying up on me, my friend. Not six cents worth. Let’s go.”"|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
21:00|"nine P.M."|"Although it was still daylight the lights were on in the ceiling. Inside the steel door of the cell block was a basket of steel bars around the Judas window. The lights were controlled from outside the steel door. They went out at nine P.M. Nobody came through the door or said anything. You might be in the middle of a sentence in a newspaper or magazine. Without any sound of a click or any warning—darkness, And there you were until the summer dawn with nothing to do but sleep if you could, smoke if you had anything to smoke, and think if you had anything to think about that didn’t make you feel worse than not thinking at all."|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 10:14"|Ten-fourteen|"“Ten-fourteen.” He stood in the doorway and looked over the cell. One blanket was spread on the lower bunk, one was folded for a pillow. There were a couple of used paper towels in the trash bucket and a small wad of toilet paper on the edge of the washbasin. He nodded approval. “Anything personal in here?”"|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
10:00|"ten A.M."|"“That’s right,” he said coolly. “I know the law. I know police work. I’m offering you a chance to clear yourself. If you don’t want it, that’s jake with me too. I can arraign you tomorrow morning at ten A.M. and have you set for a preliminary hearing. You may get bail, although I’ll fight it, but if you do, it will be stiff. It’ll cost you plenty. That’s one way we can do it.”"|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 08:50"|Eight-fifty|"“What’s the most you ever made on a single job?”
“Eight-fifty.”
“Jesus, how cheap can a guy get?”"|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
11:00|"eleven A.M."|"Late afternoon of the third day the telephone rang and I was talking to a man who said his name was Howard Spencer, that he was a representative of a New York publishing house in California on a brief business trip, that he had a problem he would like to discuss with me and would I meet him in the bar of the Ritz-Beverly Hotel at eleven A.M. the next morning."|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
03:00|"three A.M."|"But not to sleep. At three A.M. I was walking the floor and listening to Khachaturyan working in a tractor factory. He called it a violin concerto. I called it a loose fan belt and the hell with it."|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"At eleven o’clock I was sitting in the third booth on the right-hand side as you go in from the dining-room annex. I had my back against the wall and I could see anyone who came in or went out. It was a clear morning, no smog, no high fog even, and the sun dazzled the surface of the swimming pool which began just outside the plateglass wall of the bar and stretched to the far end of the dining room. A girl in a white sharkskin suit and a luscious figure was climbing the ladder to the high board. I watched the band of white that showed between the tan of her thighs and the suit. I watched it carnally. Then she was out of sight, cut off by the deep overhang of the roof. A moment later I saw her Bash down in a one and a half. Spray came high enough to catch the sun and make rainbows that were almost as pretty as the girl. Then she came up the ladder and unstrapped her white helmet and shook her bleach job loose. She wobbled her bottom over to a small white table and sat down beside a lumberjack in white drill pants and dark glasses and a tan so evenly dark that he couldn’t have been anything but the hired man around the pool. He reached over and patted her thigh. She opened a mouth like a firebucket and laughed. That terminated my interest in her. I couldn’t hear the laugh but the hole in her face when she unzippered her teeth was all I needed."|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"I looked at my watch and this high-powered publisher man was already twenty minutes late. I would wait half an hour and then I would leave. It never pays to let the customer make all the rules. If he can push you around, he will assume other people can too, and that is not what he hires you for. And right now I didn’t need the work badly enough to let some fathead from back east use me for a horse-holder, some executive character in a paneled office on the eighty-fifth floor, with a row of pushbuttons and an intercom and a secretary in a Hattie Carnegie Career Girl’s Special and a pair of those big beautiful promising eyes. This was the kind of operator who would tell you to be there at nine sharp and if you weren’t sitting quietly with a pleased smile on your pan when he floated in two hours later on a double Gibson, he would have a paroxysm of outraged executive ability which would necessitate five weeks at Acapulco before he got back the hop on his high hard one."|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap ~ 02:00"|"About two o’clock"|"“One I found on his desk,” she said. “It was very late, or rather early in the morning. I knew he had been drinking and I knew he hadn’t come upstairs. About two o’clock I went down to see if he was all right—or comparatively all right, passed out on the floor or the couch or something. He was gone. The other paper was in the wastebasket or rather caught on the edge, so that it hadn’t fallen in.”"|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 10:50"|"ten minutes to eleven"|"It was ten minutes to eleven on a Thursday night when Wade called me up. His voice was thick, almost gurgling, but I recognized it somehow. And I could hear short hard rapid breathing over the telephone."|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
"> 01:00"|"After one A.M."|"“I called you?” He grinned slowly. “Always available, aren’t you, fella? What time is it?”
“After one A.M.”
“Where’s Eileen?”"|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 06:29"|"a minute short of six-thirty"|"A shaft of sunlight tickled one of my ankles. I opened my eyes and saw the crown of a tree moving gently against a hazed blue sky. I rolled over and leather touched my cheek. An axe split my head. I sat up. There was a rug over me. I threw that off and got my feet on the floor. I scowled at a clock. The clock said a minute short of six-thirty."|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"It was about noon when the telephone rang and the voice said: “This is Linda Loring. I called your office and your phone service told me to try your home. I’d like to see you.”"|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
12:00|noon|"The stretch of broken-paved road from the highway to the curve of the hill was dancing in the noon heat and the scrub that dotted the parched land on both sides of it was flour-white with granite dust by this time. The weedy smell was almost nauseating. A thin hot acrid breeze was blowing. I had my coat off and my sleeves rolled up, but the door was too hot to rest an arm on. A tethered horse dozed wearily under a clump of live oaks. A brown Mexican sat on the ground and ate something out of a newspaper. A tumbleweed rolled lazily across the road and came to rest against a piece of granite outcrop, and a lizard that had been there an instant before disappeared without seeming to move at all."|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap < 04:00"|"almost four o’clock"|"I wheeled the tea wagon out to the kitchen, which was blue and white and large and airy and empty. I was still hungry. I ate another sandwich and drank what was left of the beer, then poured a cup of coffee and drank that. The beer was flat but the coffee was still hot. Then I went back to the patio. It was quite a long time before the speedboat came tearing down the lake again. It was almost four o’clock when I heard its distant roar swell into an ear-splitting howl of noise. There ought to be a law. Probably was and the guy in the speedboat didn’t give a damn. He enjoyed making a nuisance of himself, like other people I was meeting. I walked down to the edge of the lake."|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o'clock"|"I drove home, bought myself a couple of cold drinks, went out to dinner, came back, opened the windows and my shirt and waited for something to happen. I waited a long time. It was nine o'clock when Bernie Ohls called up and told me to come in and not stop on the way to pick any flowers."|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 10:50"|"ten minutes to eleven"|"“It was ten minutes to eleven when he called me at home. It was long past two o’clock when I went into the study for the last time that night. Call it the rest of the night if you like.”"|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap > 02:00"|"past two o’clock"|"“It was ten minutes to eleven when he called me at home. It was long past two o’clock when I went into the study for the last time that night. Call it the rest of the night if you like.”"|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"Ohls shook his head. Hernandez looked at me and said: “Come back in the morning and sign your statement. We’ll have it typed out by then. We ought to have a P.M. report by ten o’clock, preliminary anyway. Anything you don’t like about this setup, Marlowe?”"|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
00:00|midnight|"As I left the stand I saw Candy. He had a bright malicious grin on his face—I had no idea why—and as usual he was dressed just a little too well, in a cocoa brown gabardine suit with a white nylon shirt and a midnight blue bow tie. On the witness stand he was quiet and made a good impression. Yes, the boss had been pretty drunk lateIy a lot of times. Yes, he had helped put him to bed the night the gun went off upstairs. Yes, the boss had demanded whiskey before he, Candy, left on the last day, but he had refused to get it. No, he didn’t know anything about Mr. Wade’s literary work, but he knew the boss had been discouraged. He kept throwing it away and then getting it out of the wastebasket again. No, he had never heard Mr. Wade quarreling with anyone. And so on. The coroner milked him but it was thin stuff. Somebody had done a good coaching job on Candy."|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 05:40"|five-forty|"George Peters called me at five-forty. We exchanged pleasantries and condolences."|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"“Good work, kid. I always knew you would come through in the clutch. See you about seven o’clockin the bar at Romanoff’s. Tell the head thief you’re waiting for Colonel Carne. He’ll clear a space around you so you don’t get elbowed by any riffraff like screenwriters or television actors.”
“See you at seven,” I said.
We hung up and I went back to the chess board. But The Sphynx didn’t seem to interest me any more. In a little while Peters called me back and said it was all right with Carne provided the name of their agency was not connected with my problems. Peters said he would get a night letter off to London at once."|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
06:00|"six o’clock in the morning"|"I put the phone down and went into the bathroom and hit myself in the face with some cold water. Outside the window something went snip, snip, snip. I looked out vaguely and saw a brown expressionless face. It was the once-a-week Jap gardener I called Hardhearted Harry. He was trimming the tecoma—the way a Japanese gardner trims your tecoma. You ask him four times and he says, “next week,” and then he comes by at six o’clock in the morning and trims it outside your bedroom window."|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"“Mr. Spencer checked out last evening. He took the eight o’clock plane to New York.”"|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap ~ 04:00"|"around four o’clock"|"“Mr. Morgan doesn’t come in until around four o’clock. You might try the press room at the City Hall.”"|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 03:30"|three-thirty|"At three-thirty or so Lonnie Morgan came in to see me. He was the same long thin wiry piece of tired and expressionless humanity as he had been the night he drove me home from the jailhouse. He shook hands listlessly and rooted in a crumpled pack of cigarettes."|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap > 06:00"|"just past six"|"He went away and came back with the drink. I pecked at it to make it last, because I didn’t feel like getting a glow on. Either I would get really stiff or stay sober. After a while I had another of the same. It was just past six when the kid with the papers came into the bar. One of the barkeeps yelled at him to beat it, but he managed one quick round of the customers before a waiter got hold of him and threw him out. I was one of the customers. I opened up the Journal and glanced at page 1A. They had made it. It was all there. They had reversed the photostat by making it black on white and by reducing it in size they had fitted it into the top half of the page. There was a short brusque editorial on another page. There was a half column by Lonnie Morgan with a by-line, on still another page."|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"Lonnie Morgan called me up about noon and asked me how I liked it. I told him I didn’t think it would do Springer any harm."|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
"~ 14:00"|"About two in the afternoon"|"About two in the afternoon Linda Loring called me. “No names, please,” she said. “I’ve just flown in from that big lake up north. Somebody up there is boiling over something that was in the Journal last night. My almost ex-husband got it right between the eyes. The poor man was weeping when I left. He flew up to report.”"|"The Long Goodbye"|"Raymond Chandler"
