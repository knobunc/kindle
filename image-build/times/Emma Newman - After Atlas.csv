Casales secured a standard room and the Diamond Suite for a two-week stay with the option to extend. He shared the suite with Klein and the room was for Buckingham. Apparently he didn’t know how long he was staying, because no date was set for the return flights. For five of those eight days the victim was in London, and the other two at the hotel. We don’t know what Casales was doing in London yet, for obvious reasons.

After stashing the larger of his two cases—now in the possession of the manhunt team—behind a set of bins in an alleyway, he wandered up and down the high street as if looking for something. At seven a.m. an old-fashioned corner shop opened, once the province of paper newsprint and magazines. Now it’s a hub for package deliveries ordered via the Internet and a local-information board for those incapable of accessing the Internet.

The arson specialist notes that the fire was started at about eight a.m., which is unusual—most arsonists like the cover of darkness—and even though it was a gloomy winter morning, there was still far more risk of being seen than most serial arsonists would like. The report states that no suspects were detected on any of the local public cams on the streets around the warehouse, but when I dig deeper I can’t find any evidence of the footage being pulled together for review.

Even if he went straight to the crim-org, it’s unlikely he would have been chipped and online much before five p.m. that evening.
