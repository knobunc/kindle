"~ 00:00"|"about midnight"|"Do you know what I really miss about Britain now that I live in America? I miss coming in from the pub about midnight in a blurry frame of mind and watching Open University on TV."|"I'm a Stranger Here Myself"|"Bill Bryson"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"The reason that Open University lectures traditionally are so popular with postpub crowds is not because they are interesting, which patently they are not, but because for a long time they were the only thing on British TV after midnight."|"I'm a Stranger Here Myself"|"Bill Bryson"
"~ 00:00"|"about midnight"|"If I were to come in about midnight now mostly what I would find on the TV would be Peter Graves standing in a trenchcoat talking about unsolved mysteries, the Weather Channel, the fourth hour of an I Love Lucy extravaganza, at least three channels showing old M*         A*         S*         H episodes, and a small selection of movies on the premium movie channels mainly involving nubile actresses disporting in the altogether. All of which is diverting enough in its way, I grant you, but it doesn’t begin to compare with the hypnotic fascination of Open University after six pints of beer. I am quite serious about this."|"I'm a Stranger Here Myself"|"Bill Bryson"
03:00|"3 A.M."|"At the center of it all is the L.L. Bean store, which is huge. It is open twenty-four hours a day, 365 days a year. You can buy a kayak there at 3 A.M. if you want. People apparently do. My brain is beginning to hurt again."|"I'm a Stranger Here Myself"|"Bill Bryson"
"> 20:00"|"after 8 P.M."|"Some years ago when I was in Stockholm and had nothing better to do one evening (it was after 8 P.M., long after all the locals had turned in for the night), I passed the hours before bedtime thumbing through the local phone directory and tallying various names. I had heard that there were only a handful of surnames in Sweden, and this was essentially so. I counted over two thousand each for Eriksson, Svensson, Nilsson, and Larsson. Most of the rest of the book was taken up with Jonssons, Johanssens, and other similar variants. Indeed, there were so few names (or perhaps the Swedes were so cosmically dull) that many people used the same name twice. There were 212 people in Stockholm named Erik Eriksson, 117 named Sven Svensson, 126 named Nils Nilsson, and 259 named Lars Larsson. I wrote these figures down on a piece of paper and have been wondering all these years when I would ever find a use for it."|"I'm a Stranger Here Myself"|"Bill Bryson"

(He converses as if he has heard that someday he will be billed for it.) Above all, like all New Englanders, he is an early riser. Boy, do New Englanders like to get up early. We have some English friends who moved here a few years ago. Soon after arriving the woman called the dentist for an appointment and was told to come at 6:30 the following day. She showed up the next evening to find the dentist’s office in darkness. They had meant 6:30 A.M., of course. If Walt were told to come for a dental appointment at that hour I am positive he would ask if they had anything a little earlier."|"I'm a Stranger Here Myself"|"Bill Bryson"

"ap < 07:00"|"a few minutes before seven"|"Anyway, the other day he arrived at our house a few minutes before seven and apologized for being late because the traffic through Norwich had been “fierce.” What was interesting about this was not the notion that traffic in Norwich could ever be fierce but that he pronounced it “Norritch,” like the English city. This surprised me because everyone in Norwich and for miles around pronounces it “Nor-wich” (i.e., with the “w” sounded, as in “sandwich”)."|"I'm a Stranger Here Myself"|"Bill Bryson"
"~ 00:00"|"about midnight"|"The next day I tacked the loose corner of screen back into place, but to show my appreciation I put a handful of dried cat food on the step, and about midnight the skunk came and ate it. After that, for two summers, I put a little food out regularly and the skunk always came to collect it. This year it hasn’t been back. There has been a rabies epidemic among small mammals that has seriously reduced the populations of skunks, raccoons, and even squirrels. Apparently this happens every fifteen years or so as part of a natural cycle."|"I'm a Stranger Here Myself"|"Bill Bryson"
00:00|midnight|"“No, it will be great. We’ll get sand in our hair. We’ll get sand in our shoes. We’ll get sand in our sandwiches and then in our mouths. We’ll get sunburned and windburned. And when we get tired of sitting, we can have a dip in water so cold it actually hurts. At the end of the day, we’ll set off at the same time as thirty-seven thousand other people and get in such a traffic jam that we won’t get home till midnight. I can make trenchant observations about your driving skills, and the children can pass the time in back sticking each other with sharp objects. It will be such fun.”"|"I'm a Stranger Here Myself"|"Bill Bryson"

Now what do you suppose he’s doing way up here?” Then he would look around hopefully to see if anyone wanted to elaborate or offer speculation, but no one ever did. He could go on like that all day, and sometimes did."|"I'm a Stranger Here Myself"|"Bill Bryson"
00:00|midnight|"You will have read about the millennium bug. You know then that at the stroke of midnight on January 1, 2000, all the computers in the world will for some reason go through a thought process something like this: “Well, here we are in a new year that ends in ’00. I expect it’s 1900. But wait—if it’s 1900, computers haven’t been invented yet. Therefore I don’t exist. Guess I had better shut myself down and wipe my memory clean.” The estimated cost to put this right is $200 trillion gazillion or some such preposterous sum. A computer, you see, can calculate pi to twenty thousand places but can’t work out that time always moves forward. Programmers, meanwhile, can write eighty thousand lines of complex code but fail to note that every hundred years you get a new century. It’s a disastrous combination."|"I'm a Stranger Here Myself"|"Bill Bryson"

"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"Of course, on book tours it’s not all lounging around in swank hotel rooms, watching TV, and eating melted ice cream. You also have to give interviews—lots and lots of them, more than you can imagine, often from before dawn until after midnight—and do a positively ludicrous amount of traveling in between. Because there are so many authors out there pushing their books—as many as two hundred at busy periods, I was told—and only so many radio and TV programs to appear on, you tend to be dispatched to wherever there is an available slot. In one five-day period, I flew from San Francisco to Atlanta to Chicago to Boston and back to San Francisco. I once flew from Denver to Colorado Springs in order to do a thirty-second interview that—I swear—went approximately like this:"|"I'm a Stranger Here Myself"|"Bill Bryson"
"~ 22:00"|"about 10 P.M."|"And so we drove over the river to our venerable drive-in. Almost at once I began to remember why drive-ins went into such a precipitate decline. To begin with, it is not remotely comfortable to sit in a car to watch a movie. If you are in the driver’s seat, you have a steering wheel in your lap the whole time. If you are in the back, you can’t really see at all. Unless you had the foresight to clean the windshield before you set off, you will be watching the picture through a smear of squashed bugs and road dirt. The sound quality from the little speakers is always appalling and tinny and makes every character sound as if he is speaking from the inside of a gym locker. In a place like New England, the evenings invariably turn cool, so you shut the car windows to keep warm and then spend the rest of the evening wiping condensation from the inside of the windshield with the back of your arm. Often it rains. Above all, daylight saving time means that it isn’t dark enough to see the movies until about 10 P.M."|"I'm a Stranger Here Myself"|"Bill Bryson"

00:00|midnight|"So I have come up with an ingenious alternative diet. I call it the Fool-Your-Body-Twenty-Hours-a-Day Diet. The idea is that for twenty hours in each twenty-four you ruthlessly starve yourself, but at four selected intervals during the day—for convenience we’ll call them breakfast, lunch, dinner, and midnight snack—you feed your body something like an 18-ounce sirloin steak with a baked potato and extra sour cream, or a large bowl of double chocolate fudge ice cream, so that it doesn’t realize that you are actually starving it. Brilliant, eh?"|"I'm a Stranger Here Myself"|"Bill Bryson"
02:30|"2:30 A.M."|"You begin to wonder who watches it all. One of our channels is a twenty-four-hour cartoon network. That there are people out there who wish to watch cartoons through the night is remarkable enough, but what is truly astounding to me is that the channel carries commercials. What could you possibly sell to people who voluntarily watch Deputy Dawg at 2:30 A.M.? Bibs?"|"I'm a Stranger Here Myself"|"Bill Bryson"
21:30|"9:30 P.M."|"But perhaps the most mind-numbing feature is that the same programs are shown over and over at the same times each night. Tonight at 9:30 P.M. on Channel 20 we can watch The Munsters. Last night at 9:30 P.M. on Channel 20 it was The Munsters. Tomorrow night at 9:30 P.M. on Channel 20 it will be—did you guess correctly?—The Munsters. Each Munsters showing is preceded by an episode of Happy Days and followed by an episode of The Mary Tyler Moore Show. It has been like this for years, as far as I can tell, and will stay like this forever."|"I'm a Stranger Here Myself"|"Bill Bryson"
05:45|"5:45 A.M."|"After twenty years in England this copious abundance was, as you might imagine, almost intoxicating. Lately, however, I have come to suspect that perhaps you can get too much choice. I found myself edging around to this view recently when I was at the airport in Portland, Oregon, standing in a line of about fifteen people at a coffee stand. It was 5:45 A.M., not my best time of day, and I had just twenty minutes till my flight was to be called, but I really, really needed to get some caffeine into my system. You know how it is."|"I'm a Stranger Here Myself"|"Bill Bryson"
