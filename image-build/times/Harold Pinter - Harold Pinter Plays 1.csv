"ap 02:06"|"two hours and six minutes"|"I mean, my job, for instance. I have to see that all the gates are locked outside the building and that all the patients’ doors are locked inside the building. It gives me exercise, I’ll say that. It takes me two hours and six minutes, approximately, to try every gate and every door, then I can stand still for ten minutes, then off I go again. I have the regulation breaks, of course. Breakfast, lunch, tea and dinner. Still, I feel a bit whacked when my shift’s over, I must admit. But as I said it gives me time to think – not when I’m testing the locks, of course – but in between locks – it gives me time to think, and mostly I think about the patients. I get some very good ideas while I think, honestly. As a matter of fact, I hear one receives a little token of esteem, sometimes – I mean after a certain period. I’ve got a feeling that mine’s almost due."|"Harold Pinter Plays 1"|"Harold Pinter"

Didn’t you come down for Mother’s Day, or Thanksgiving Day, or for the annual summer picnic for patients, staff, relatives and friends? Weren’t you invited to the Halloween Feast, the May Dance, the October Revival, the Old Boys and Girls supper and social? Dancing on the lawn, cold buffets on the flat roof, midnight croquet, barbecued boar by the lake? None of this? I never knew about it, she said. What! I said. The autumn art exhibition, the monthly concert of orchestral music in the bandroom, the half-yearly debate on a selected topic, held traditionally in the men’s changing room? The pageant? The unveiling? The Festival of One-Act Plays, judged by Miss Daisy Cutts, L.R.M.B., A.C.A., our dramatic instructor? You came down, I said, for none of these activities and ceremonies through which we from time immemorial engage and channel our patients’ energies? Oh dear, she said, I was never told. Obviously a clerical error, I said, I shall have it looked into. But, I said, it is a shame that you haven’t seen him, since he is now departed from us."|"Harold Pinter Plays 1"|"Harold Pinter"

I don’t know what your father would say. Coming in this time of night. It’s after twelve o’clock. In a state like that. Drunk, I suppose. I suppose your dinner’s ruined. Well, if you want to make a convenience out of your own home, that’s your business. I’m only your mother, I don’t suppose that counts for much these days. I’m not saying any more. If you want to go mucking about with girls, that’s your business."|"Harold Pinter Plays 1"|"Harold Pinter"
00:00|midnight|"I hope you’re satisfied, anyway. The house in darkness, I wasn’t going to break my neck going down to that cellar to look for a bulb, you come home looking like I don’t know what, anyone would think you gave me a fortune out of your wages. Yes. I don’t say anything, do I? I keep quiet about what you expect me to manage on. I never grumble. I keep a lovely home, I bet there’s none of the boys in your firm better fed than you are. I’m not asking for gratitude. But one things hurts me, Albert, and I’ll tell you what it is. Not for years, not for years, have you come up to me and said, Mum, I love you, like you did when you were a little boy. You’ve never said it without me having to ask you. Not since before your father died. And he was a good man. He had high hopes of you. I’ve never told you, Albert, about the high hopes he had of you. I don’t know what you do with all your money. But don’t forget what it cost us to rear you, my boy, I’ve never told you about the sacrifices we made, you wouldn’t care, anyway. Telling me lies about going to the firm’s party. They’ve got a bit of respect at that firm, that’s why we sent you there, to start off your career, they wouldn’t let you carry on like that at one of their functions. Mr. King would have his eye on you. I don’t know where you’ve been. Well, if you don’t want to lead a clean life it’s your lookout, if you want to go mucking about with all sorts of bits of girls, if you’re content to leave your own mother sitting here till midnight, and I wasn’t feeling well, anyway, I didn’t tell you because I didn’t want to upset you, I keep things from you, you’re the only one I’ve got, but what do you care, you don’t care, you don’t care, the least you can do is sit down and eat the dinner I cooked for you, specially for you, it’s Shepherd’s Pie—"|"Harold Pinter Plays 1"|"Harold Pinter"

"ap 05:00"|"Five o’clock"|"I always catch the all-night bus, six days out of the week. I walk to Marble Arch and get the two-nine-four, that takes me to Fleet Street. I never speak to the men on the all-night buses. Then I go into the Black and White at Fleet Street and sometimes my friend comes. I have a cup of tea. She is taller than me but thinner. Sometimes she comes and we sit at the top table. I always keep her place but you can’t always keep it. I never speak to them when they take it. Some remarks I never listen to. A man slips me the morning paper sometimes, the first one. He told me what he was once. I never go down to the place near the Embankment. I did go down there once. You can see what goes on from the window by the top table if you look. Mostly it’s vans. They’re always rushing. Mostly they’re the same van-drivers, sometimes they’re different. My brother was the same. He used to be in on it. But I can do better without the night, when it’s dark, it’s always light in the Black and White, sometimes it’s blue, I can’t see much. But I can do better without the cold when it’s cold. It’s always warm in the Black and White, sometimes it’s draughty, I don’t kip. Five o’clock they close down to give it a scrub round. I always wear my grey skirt and my red scarf, you never see me without lipstick. Sometimes my friend comes, she always brings over two teas. If there’s someone taken her place she tells him. She’s older than me but thinner. If it’s cold I might have soup. You get a good bowl. They give you the slice of bread. They won’t do that with tea but they do it with soup. So I might have soup, if it’s cold. Now and again you can see the all-night buses going down. They all run down there. I’ve never been the other way, not the way some of them go. I’ve been down to Liverpool Street. That’s where some of them end up. She’s greyer than me. The lights get you down a bit. Once a man stood up and made a speech. A copper came in. They got him out. Then the copper came over to us. We soon told him off, my friend did. I never seen him since, either of them. They don’t get many coppers. I’m a bit old for that, my friend told him. Are you, he said. Too old for you, she said. He went. I don’t mind, there’s not too much noise, there’s always a bit of noise. Young people in cabs come in once. She didn’t like the coffee. I’ve never had the coffee. I had coffee up at Euston, a time or two, going back. I like the vegetable soup better than the tomato. I was having a bowl then and this man was leaning from across the table, dead asleep, but sitting on his elbows, scratching his head. He was pulling the hairs out of his head into my soup, dead asleep. I pulled my bowl away. But at five o’clock they close down to give it a scrub round. They don’t let you stay. My friend never stays, if she’s there. You can’t buy a cup of tea. I’ve asked but they won’t let you sit, not even with your feet up. Still, you can get about four hours out of it. They only shut hour and a half. You could go down to that one near the Embankment, but I’ve only been down there once. I’ve always got my red scarf. I’m never without lipstick. I give them a look. They never pick me up. They took my friend away in the wagon once. They didn’t keep her. She said they took a fancy to her. I’ve never gone in for that. You keep yourself clean. Still, she won’t stand for any of it in the Black and White. But they don’t try much. I see them look. Mostly nobody looks. I don’t know many, some I’ve seen about. One woman in a big black hat and big black boots comes in. I never make out what she has. He slips her the morning paper. It’s not long. You can go along, then come back. When it’s light I go. My friend won’t wait. She goes. I don’t mind. One got me sick. Came in a fur coat once. They give you injections, she said, it’s all Whitehall, they got it all worked out, she said, they can tap your breath, they inject you in the ears. My friend came later. She was a bit nervy. I got her quiet. They’d take her in. When it’s light I walk up to the Aldwych. They’re selling the papers. I’ve read it. One morning I went a bit over Waterloo Bridge. I saw the last two-nine-six. It must have been the last. It didn’t look like an all-night bus, in daylight."|"Harold Pinter Plays 1"|"Harold Pinter"
