02:00|"two o’clock in the morning"|"That man in the picture had just finished an excellent lunch and had moved next door to do a bit of calving just for the sheer pleasure of it, as a kind of dessert. He hadn’t crawled shivering from his bed at two o’clock in the morning and bumped over twelve miles of frozen snow, staring sleepily ahead till the lonely farm showed in the headlights. He hadn’t climbed half a mile of white fell-side to the doorless barn where his patient lay."|"If Only They Could Talk"|"James Herriot"
"ap 06:54"|"six to seven o’clock"|"“Mr. Herriot?” she said thoughtfully. “Surgery is from six to seven o’clock. If you wanted to bring a dog in, that would be your best time.”"|"If Only They Could Talk"|"James Herriot"
01:00|"1 a.m."|"It was 1 a.m. before Farnon got back. His evening with his mother had stimulated him. His thin cheeks were flushed and he smelt pleasantly of gin. I was surprised to see that he was wearing evening dress and though the dinner jacket was of old-fashioned cut and hung in loose folds on his bony frame, he still managed to look like an ambassador."|"If Only They Could Talk"|"James Herriot"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"He yawned, jerked the knot out of his black tie and looked at his watch. “Well, five o’clock. Who would have thought it? But I’m glad we had a drink together - only right to celebrate your first case. It was a right one, wasn’t it?”"|"If Only They Could Talk"|"James Herriot"

"ap 07:00"|seven|"It was three weeks since Tristan’s arrival and life at Skeldale House had settled into a fairly regular pattern.

04:00|"4 a.m."|"“Out at 4 a.m.,” he groaned, buttering his toast listlessly. “And I don’t like to have to say this, James, but it’s all your fault.”"|"If Only They Could Talk"|"James Herriot"
04:00|"four o’clock in the morning"|"“Yes, lad, your fault. This was a cow with a mild impaction of the rumen. The farmer had been mucking about with it himself for days, a pint of linseed oil one day, a bit of bicarb and ginger the next, and at four o’clock in the morning he decides it is time to call the vet. When I pointed out it could have waited a few hours more he said Mr. Herriot told him never to hesitate to ring - he’d come out any hour of the day or night.”"|"If Only They Could Talk"|"James Herriot"

"ap 23:45"|"quarter to twelve"|"I was slightly taken aback when I entered the house. The family were just sitting down to Sunday dinner and were still in their working clothes.

"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"You know, I’m sure he must study the racing columns, he’s such a tremendous judge Of form. Well, he told me to back Canny Lad in the three o’clock at Redcar yesterday and, as usual, it won. He put on a shilling each way and got back nine shillings.”"|"If Only They Could Talk"|"James Herriot"
10:00|"ten o’clock this morning"|"With an effort, he mastered his emotion. “Well, she’s in her fifties and she has retired after thirty years with Green and Moulton in Bradford. She was company secretary there and I’ve had the most wonderful reference from the firm. They say she is a model of efficiency and that’s what we want in this practice efficiency. We’re far too slack. It’s just a stroke of luck for us that she decided to come and live in Darrowby. Anyway, you’ll be able to meet her in a few minutes - she’s coming at ten o’clock this morning.”"|"If Only They Could Talk"|"James Herriot"
"ap 09:00"|"Nine o’clock"|"“Fine, Miss. Harbottle, fine.” Siegfried was rubbing his hands harder than ever. “We’ll expect you on Monday morning.”
“Nine o’clock sharp, Mr. Farnon.”
After she had gone there was a silence. Tristan had enjoyed her visit and was smiling thoughtfully, but I felt uncertain."|"If Only They Could Talk"|"James Herriot"
02:00|"two a.m."|"I looked at the clock as I put down the receiver. It was two a.m. I felt numbed. A farrowing right on top of the champagne and the smoked salmon and those little biscuits with the black heaps of caviare. And at Beck Cottage, one of the most primitive smallholdings in the district. It wasn’t fair."|"If Only They Could Talk"|"James Herriot"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"I glanced at my watch as I slammed the car door. It was six o’clock, so Tristan had had four hours of it. I ran up the steps and along the passage and when I opened the sitting-room door the noise jarred in my head. Tristan was standing with his back to me, looking through the french window into the darkness of the garden. His hands were deep in his pockets; tufts of cotton wool drooped from his ears."|"If Only They Could Talk"|"James Herriot"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"It was eleven o’clock before we all got into our cars and headed for our own particular niche in Yorkshire - some to the big industrial towns of the West Riding, others to the seaside places of the East coast and Siegfried and I hurrying thankfully back on the narrow road which twisted between its stone walls into the Northern Pennines."|"If Only They Could Talk"|"James Herriot"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"I thought guiltily that for the last few hours I had completely forgotten about Tristan and his vigil. Still, it must have been better tonight. The dog would surely have quietened down by now. But, jumping from the car in Darrowby, I froze in mid stride as a thin wail came out faintly from Skeldale House. This was incredible; it was after midnight and the dog was still at it. And what of Tristan? I hated to think what kind of shape he’d be in. Almost fearfully I turned the knob on the sitting-room door."|"If Only They Could Talk"|"James Herriot"
"ap > 03:00"|"After three"|"“Could be worse, old lad, could be worse. Soon as you’d gone I slipped over to the Drovers for a crate of pint Magnets. Made all the difference. After three or four the dog stopped worrying me - matter of fact, I’ve been yowling back at him for hours now. We’ve had quite an interesting evening. Anyway, he’s coming out now. Look at him.”"|"If Only They Could Talk"|"James Herriot"

"ap 09:15"|"quarter past nine"|"The church clock was chiming a quarter past nine when I pulled up outside Skeldale House. I felt good - warm, full of superb food and with the satisfying memory of the cow’s quick recovery. And there was my parcel on the back seat it was always a stroke of luck to land on a farm after a pig killing and there was usually a gift from the hospitable farmers, but these sausages were something I would never forget."|"If Only They Could Talk"|"James Herriot"

05:00|"five o’clock in the morning"|"I found it wonderfully easy to forget about the stallion over the days and weeks that followed; except when my defences were down. At least once a night it thundered through my dreams with gaping nostrils and flying mane and I developed an uncomfortable habit of coming bolt awake at five o’clock in the morning and starting immediately to operate on the horse. On an average, I took that tumour off twenty times before breakfast each morning."|"If Only They Could Talk"|"James Herriot"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"I turned to face Mr. Cranford, trying in vain to look into the eyes that always veered away at the last moment. “I’m sorry, but I feel we ought to have a look inside this cow. I’ll ring Mallock and ask him to pick her up and we can see her in the morning. I’ll meet you there at ten o’clock. Will that be all right?”"|"If Only They Could Talk"|"James Herriot"

This was just a little bit too much; once out of bed in the middle of the night was bad enough, but twice was unfair, in fact it was sheer cruelty.
