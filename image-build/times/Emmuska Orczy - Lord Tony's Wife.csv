"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"‘No one, zir. It ain’t their hour not yet. You’ll ‘ave the ‘ouse to yourself till after midnight. After that there’ll be a bustle, I reckon. Two shiploads come into Watchet last night—brandy and cloth, Mounzeer, so the Captain says, and worth a mint o’ money. The pack ‘orzes will be through yere in the small hours.’"|"Lord Tony's Wife"|"Emmuska Orczy"
"< 00:00"|"before midnight"|"‘Then if you have nothing more to tell me,’ quoth Martin-Roget, ‘I may as well think about getting back. Rain or no rain, I want to be in Bath before midnight.’"|"Lord Tony's Wife"|"Emmuska Orczy"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"‘My own schemes of revenge!’ exclaimed Martin-Roget with a hoarse cry that was like a snarl…It seemed as if he wanted to say something more, but that the words choked him even before they reached his lips. The hot flush died down from his forehead and his face was once more the colour of lead. He took up a log from the corner of the hearth and threw it with a savage, defiant gesture into the fire.
Somewhere in the house a clock struck nine.

They won’t be ‘ere neither till after midnight. But,’ she added more cheerfully, ‘I can straighten a saddle if you want it.’"|"Lord Tony's Wife"|"Emmuska Orczy"
00:00|midnight|"Sir Percy Blakeney and his lady had just arrived. It was close on midnight, and the ball had positively languished. What was a ball without the presence of Sir Percy? His Royal Highness too had been expected earlier than this. But it was not thought that he would come at all, despite his promise, if the spoilt pet of Bath society remained unaccountably absent; and the Assembly Rooms had worn an air of woe even in the face of the gaily dressed throng which filled every vast room in its remotest angle."|"Lord Tony's Wife"|"Emmuska Orczy"
00:00|midnight|"But now Sir Percy Blakeney had arrived, just before the clocks had struck midnight, and exactly one minute before His Royal Highness drove up himself from the Royal Apartments. Lady Blakeney was looking more radiant and beautiful than ever before, so every one remarked when a few moments later she appeared in the crowded ball-room on the arm of His Royal Highness and closely followed by my lord Anthony Dewhurst and by Sir Percy himself, who had the young Duchess of Flintshire on his arm."|"Lord Tony's Wife"|"Emmuska Orczy"
"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"‘It is long past midnight now, sweetheart,’ he said with sudden irrelevance."|"Lord Tony's Wife"|"Emmuska Orczy"
"ap 06:30"|"half-past six"|"‘The parson will be ready at half-past six, dear heart, it was the earliest hour that I could secure…after that we go at once to your church and the priest will tie up any loose threads which our English parson failed to make tight. After those two ceremonies we shall be very much married, shan’t we?…and nothing can come between us, dear heart, can it?’ he queried with a look of intense anxiety on his young face."|"Lord Tony's Wife"|"Emmuska Orczy"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"There was silence for a moment or two, during which the heavy bracket clock over the door struck the first hour after midnight. His Royal Highness looked round at Lady Blakeney, and she gave him a smile and an almost imperceptible nod. Sir Andrew Ffoulkes had in the meanwhile quietly slipped away."|"Lord Tony's Wife"|"Emmuska Orczy"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"It was close on ten o’clock now in the morning on the following day, and M. le duc de Kernogan was at breakfast in his lodgings in Laura Place, when a courier was announced who was the bearer of a letter for M. le duc."|"Lord Tony's Wife"|"Emmuska Orczy"
"> 12:00"|"past midday"|"It was past midday when at last Martin-Roget knocked at the door of M. le duc’s lodgings in Laura Place. The older man had in the meanwhile gone through every phase of overwhelming emotions. The outbreak of unreasoning fury—when like a maddened beast that bites and tears he had broken his daughter’s miniature and trampled it under foot–had been followed by a kind of dull apathy, when for close upon an hour he had sat staring into the flames, trying to grapple with an awful reality which seemed to elude him all the time. He could not believe that this thing had really happened: that Yvonne, his well-bred dutiful daughter, who had shown such marvellous courage and presence of mind when the necessity of flight and of exile had first presented itself in the wake of the awful massacres and wholesale executions of her own friends and kindred, that she should have eloped—like some flirtatious wench–and outraged her father in this monstrous fashion, by a clandestine marriage with a man of alien race and of a heretical religion! M. de Kernogan could not realize it. It passed the bounds of possibility. The very flames in the hearth seemed to dance and to mock the bare suggestion of such an atrocious transgression."|"Lord Tony's Wife"|"Emmuska Orczy"
"ap ~ 04:00"|"about four o’clock"|"To this gloomy numbing of the senses had succeeded the inevitable morbid restlessness: the pacing up and down the narrow room, the furtive glances at the clock, the frequent orders to Frιdιrick to go out and see if M. Martin-Roget was not yet home. For Frιdιrick had come back after his first errand with the astounding news that M. Martin-Roget had left his lodgings the previous day at about four o’clock, and had not been seen or heard of since. In fact his landlady was very anxious about him and was sorely tempted to see the town-crier on the subject."|"Lord Tony's Wife"|"Emmuska Orczy"
12:00|midday|"Four times did Frιdιrick have to go from Laura Place to the Bear Inn in Union Street, where M. Martin-Roget lodged, and three times he returned with the news that nothing had been heard of Mounzeer yet. The fourth time—it was then close on midday–he came back running–thankful to bring back the good tidings, since he was tired of that walk from Laura Place to the Bear Inn. M. Martin-Roget had come home. He appeared very tired and in rare ill-humour: but Frιdιrick had delivered the message from M. le duc, whereupon M. Martin-Roget had become most affable and promised that he would come round immediately. In fact he was even then treading hard on Frιdιrick’s heels."|"Lord Tony's Wife"|"Emmuska Orczy"
12:00|midday|"There are lovely days in England sometimes in November or December, days when the departing year strives to make us forget that winter is nigh, and autumn smiles, gentle and benignant, caressing with a still tender kiss the last leaves of the scarlet oak which linger on the boughs, and touching up with a vivid brush the evergreen verdure of bay trees, of ilex and of yew. The sky is of that pale, translucent blue which dwellers in the South never see, with the soft transparency of an aqua-marine as it fades into the misty horizon at midday. And at dusk the thrushes sing: ‘Kiss me quick! kiss me quick! kiss me quick’ in the naked branches of old acacias and chestnuts, and the robins don their crimson waistcoats and dart in and out among the coppice and through the feathery arms of larch and pine. And the sun which tips the prickly points of holly leaves with gold, joins in this merry make-believe that winter is still a very, very long way off, and that mayhap he has lost his way altogether, and is never coming to this balmy beautiful land again."|"Lord Tony's Wife"|"Emmuska Orczy"
"ap > 08:00"|"after eight o’clock"|"Half an hour later M. de Kernogan had arrived and his daughter lay in his arms, happy, beyond the dreams of men. He looked rather tired and wan and still complained that the cold had got into his bones: evidently he was not very well and Yvonne after the excitement of the meeting felt not a little anxious about him. As the evening wore on he became more and more silent; he hardly would eat anything and soon after eight o’clock he announced his desire to retire to bed."|"Lord Tony's Wife"|"Emmuska Orczy"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"Whereupon M. le duc yielded. He kissed and thanked his daughter and seemed even relieved at the prospect of her company. The barouche was ordered for eleven o’clock, and a quarter of an hour before that time Lord Tony had his young wife in his arms, bidding her a sad farewell."|"Lord Tony's Wife"|"Emmuska Orczy"
09:00|"nine o’clock in the morning"|"He started for Bath at nine o’clock in the morning. It was still raining hard. It had rained all night and the roads were very muddy. He started out without a groom. A little after half-past ten, he drew rein outside his house in Chandos Buildings, and having changed his clothes he started to walk to Laura Place. The rain had momentarily left off, and a pale wintry sun peeped out through rolling banks of grey clouds. He went round by way of Saw Close and the Upper Borough Walls, as he wanted to avoid the fashionable throng that crowded the neighbourhood of the Pump Room and the Baths. His intention was to seek out the Blakeneys at their residence in the Circus after he had seen Yvonne and obtained news of M. le duc."|"Lord Tony's Wife"|"Emmuska Orczy"

"ap 11:15"|"quarter-past eleven"|"The Abbey clock struck a quarter-past eleven when finally he knocked at the house in Laura Place. Long afterwards he remembered how just at that moment a dense grey mist descended into the valley. He had not noticed it before, now he saw it had enveloped this part of the city so that he could not even see clearly across the Place."|"Lord Tony's Wife"|"Emmuska Orczy"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"”Is Grace,’ she said with slow emphasis, for of a truth she thought that the young gentleman was either sick or daft,’ ‘Is Grace left this ‘ouse the day afore yesterday in a hired barouche. ‘Is man—Frederick— went yesterday afternoon with the liggage. ‘E caught the Bristol coach at two o’clock.

12:30|"half an hour after midday"|"It was half an hour after midday when Percy knocked at the door of her boudoir. She had just come in from a walk in the meadows round the town and along the bank of the river: the rain had overtaken her and she had come in very wet, but none the less exhilarated by the movement and the keen, damp, salt-laden air which came straight over the hills from the Channel. She had taken off her hat and her mantle and was laughing gaily with her maid who was shaking the wet out of a feather. She looked round at her husband when he entered, and with a quick gesture ordered the maid out of the room."|"Lord Tony's Wife"|"Emmuska Orczy"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"It was close on six o’clock and the night, after the turbulent and capricious alternations of rain and sunshine promised to be beautifully clear, though very cold. The pale crescent of the moon had just emerged from behind the thick veil of cloud and mist which still hung threateningly upon the horizon: a fitful sheen of silver danced upon the waves."|"Lord Tony's Wife"|"Emmuska Orczy"
"< 22:00"|"two hours before midnight"|"‘Only,’ replied Martin-Roget with a laugh, ‘that we are close to the coast of France and that with this unpleasant but useful north-westerly wind we shall be in Nantes two hours before midnight.’"|"Lord Tony's Wife"|"Emmuska Orczy"
12:00|midday|"Two chairs were placed in front of the door which led to the private sanctuary—still wrapped in religious obscurity—where Carrier sat enthroned. The youth curtly pointed to the two chairs, then went back to the inner room. The two men advanced. The full light of midday fell upon them from the tall window on their right—the pale, grey, colourless light of December. They bowed slightly in the direction of the audience chamber where the vague silhouette of the proconsul was alone visible."|"Lord Tony's Wife"|"Emmuska Orczy"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"The Place itself was deserted, in strange contrast to the bustle and the movement which characterized it in the days when the death of men, women and children was a daily spectacle here for the crowd. Then a constant stream of traffic, of carts and of tumbrils, of soldiers and gaffers encumbered it in every corner, now a few tumble-down booths set up against the frontage of the grim edifice—once the stronghold of the Dukes of Brittany, now little else but a huge prison—a few vendors and still fewer purchasers of the scanty wares displayed under their ragged awnings, one or two idlers loafing against the mud-stained walls, one or two urchins playing in the gutters were the only signs of life. Martin-Roget with his colleague Chauvelin turned into the Place from the quay—they walked rapidly and kept their mantles closely wrapped under their chin, for the afternoon had turned bitterly cold. It was then close upon five o’clock—a dark, moonless, starless night had set in with only a suspicion of frost in the damp air; but a blustering north-westerly wind blowing down the river and tearing round the narrow streets and the open Place, caused passers-by to muffle themselves, shivering, yet tighter in their cloaks."|"Lord Tony's Wife"|"Emmuska Orczy"
"ap 05:00"|five|"The clock in the tower of the edifice was even then striking five. The Marats in the hall looked up with lazy indifference at the two men who had come rushing out in such an abrupt and excited manner."|"Lord Tony's Wife"|"Emmuska Orczy"
12:00|midday|"The house occupied by the citizeness Adet lay back a little from the others in the street. It was one of an irregular row of mean, squalid, tumble-down houses, some of them little more than lean-to-sheds built into the walls of Le Bouffay. Most of them had overhanging roofs which stretched out like awnings more than halfway across the road, and even at midday shut out any little ray of sunshine which might have a tendency to peep into the street below."|"Lord Tony's Wife"|"Emmuska Orczy"
"ap 06:00"|six|"From somewhere in the distance a city clock struck six. The afternoon was wearing on. The keenest brain in Europe was on the watch to drag one woman and one man from the deadly trap which had been so successfully set for them. A few hours more and Chauvelin in his turn would be pitting his wits against the resources of that intricate brain, and he felt like a war-horse scenting blood and battle. He was aching to get to work—aching to form his plans—to lay his snares—to dispose his trap so that the noble English quarry should not fail to be caught within its meshes."|"Lord Tony's Wife"|"Emmuska Orczy"
"ap 00:00"|"twelve o’clock"|"‘Well, citizen,’ retorted Chauvelin imperturbably, ‘will you take the risk of conveying the fair Yvonne to the Rat Mort by twelve o’clock to-night?
