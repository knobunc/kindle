"ap 05:30"|5:30|"Long after night had descended completely, obscuring everything before him but watch fires and the occasional dull gleam of a bayonet, Churchill, unable to sleep, peered intently at the stars overhead. As he listened to nearby soldiers tensely coughing and shifting in their trenches, yearning for the night to end, he contemplated “those impartial stars, which shine as calmly on Piccadilly Circus as on Inayat Kila.” Bindon Blood had ordered the men to march into the mountains the next morning, burning homes and crops and destroying water reservoirs. Reveille would sound at 5:30, and the Pashtun, they knew, would be waiting."|"Hero of the Empire"|"Candice Millard"
18:00|"6:00 p.m."|"Within just a few weeks of Lady Jeune’s dinner party, Churchill stood at the imposing, pillared entrance of Blenheim Palace, surrounded this time not just by tributes to the 1st Duke of Marlborough but by an eager audience of hundreds, and, heedless of Chamberlain’s advice, made his case for war. His opportunity had come at the annual meeting of the Woodstock Conservative Association, following a day of festivities that had included everything from a ladies’ bicycle race over the palace grounds to a potato-picking race in one of the gardens to an obstacle course that had ended with the exhausted challengers shakily trying to thread a needle. At 6:00 p.m., long before the summer sun had begun to set, the association’s members gathered at the foot of the palace’s broad stone steps to hear remarks by the 9th Duke of Marlborough as well as two of his cousins: the calm, dark-haired Ivor Guest, who was the son of Lady Cornelia, Randolph Churchill’s older sister, and Guest’s polar opposite, the fair-haired and forceful Winston Churchill."|"Hero of the Empire"|"Candice Millard"
17:00|"5 o’clock p.m."|"Finally, on October 9, driven by fear and fury, the Boers issued an ultimatum to the British Empire: Stand down or prepare for war. “The Government must press for an immediate and affirmative answer before or upon Wednesday, October 11, 1899, not later than 5 o’clock p.m.,” read the ultimatum, which had been telegraphed to London from the Transvaal capital of Pretoria. “It desires further to add, that in the event of unexpectedly no satisfactory answer being received by it within that interval, it will, with great regret, be compelled to regard the action of Her Majesty’s Government as a formal declaration of war.”"|"Hero of the Empire"|"Candice Millard"
15:00|"3:00 p.m."|"The British allowed the deadline for the ultimatum to pass with little more than a sneer. At 3:00 p.m. on October 11, just two hours before the deadline, William Conyngham Greene, Her Majesty’s agent at Pretoria, received a telegram from London, which he brought immediately to the president of the Transvaal, Paul Kruger, and his secretary of state for war, Louis de Souza. After reading the telegram, which dismissed his government’s claims out of hand and refused to abide by its terms, Kruger, a large man with a wide, solemn face ringed by a graying chin-curtain beard, sat for a long time without saying a word, filling the nearly empty room with a heavy silence. Finally, bowing his head, he said simply, “So must it be.” “We have crossed the Rubicon,” de Souza’s wife, Marie, wrote in her diary that night, “and God alone knows the end of it all.”"|"Hero of the Empire"|"Candice Millard"
15:47|"3:47 p.m."|"When Buller’s special five-car train, its interior upholstered in a rich yellow silk, finally reached the port at 3:47 p.m., the long, low steam whistle announcing his arrival was immediately swallowed by the deafening roar of the crowd. Those who had resorted to sitting on everything from packing crates and cast-aside boxes to the port’s filthy ground during their long wait leaped to their feet, cheering wildly. A rope that had been strung the fifty yards between the customs house and the ship in an effort to separate passengers from onlookers was straining to its snapping point. Harried policemen, their belted tunics by now wrinkled and stained and their helmets barely hanging on by the chin straps, fought to maintain order."|"Hero of the Empire"|"Candice Millard"
18:00|"6:00 p.m."|"At 6:00 p.m., with the final cry of “Any more for the shore!” hanging in the air, Churchill watched from the ship as reporters and photographers frantically dashed down the gangplank and the throng that swarmed the long pier shouted their last good-byes. As Buller stood on the captain’s deck, waving to the upturned faces, the Dunottar Castle slipped its moorings, and the shouts slowly began to die away. In their place rose the soft, swelling sound of women’s voices, singing “God Save the Queen.” As men joined in the chorus, the words, solemn and strong—“Send her victorious, happy and glorious, long to reign over us”—followed the ship out to sea, and the passengers, looking “back towards the shores swiftly fading in the distance and the twilight,” Churchill wrote, “wondered whether, and if so when, they would come safe home again.”"|"Hero of the Empire"|"Candice Millard"
"ap 05:00"|5:00|"At 5:00 on the morning of October 20, after a night of rain so heavy the British were certain it would deter any man, even the Boers, from scaling the hills surrounding their camp, a shell suddenly rent the quiet morning air. Penn Symons was just about to sit down to his breakfast when the second shell thundered down in the midst of his tents, missing his own by only a few yards. Outraged by the Boers’ impudence, he smoked a cigarette as he began issuing orders, commanding his men to train their guns on Talana Hill."|"Hero of the Empire"|"Candice Millard"
"ap 01:00"|1:00|"The train, with Churchill and Amery aboard, pulled out of Estcourt at 1:00 on the afternoon of November 8, rattling along the railway line that stretched toward Ladysmith. Although they made frequent stops to question locals and check in with their own scouts, the train moved relatively quickly through the empty veld until it reached the small town of Chieveley. From there, however, they were forced to slow down considerably. “Beyond Chieveley,” Churchill wrote, “it was necessary to observe more caution.” The train inched, yard by yard, along the tracks. The men scanned the horizon with their field glasses and telescopes, and if they came to a bridge or culvert, they stopped, climbed out and carefully inspected it before continuing on their excruciatingly slow journey."|"Hero of the Empire"|"Candice Millard"
11:00|"11:00 that morning"|"Although Churchill had had little luck getting to the war, on November 14 the war seemed finally to come to him. At 11:00 that morning, less than a week after his ride aboard the armored train, the thunderous boom of an alarm gun suddenly shook Estcourt. The gun, which had been placed in front of the camp, a hundred paces from the artillery posts, was there to warn the men, not kill them, but the sudden, explosive sound was as jolting and sickening as that of the Boer field guns trained on Ladysmith. Even after weeks of tense waiting, and endless discussions about when and how the enemy would attack, it was hard to believe the Boers had finally arrived."|"Hero of the Empire"|"Candice Millard"
"<< 00:00"|"long before midnight"|"Later that night, not long before midnight, Churchill’s old friend Aylmer Haldane was surprised when a young officer in his battalion named Tom Frankland appeared before him with a message from the colonel. He was, Frankland told Haldane, to report immediately to the brigade office for an assignment. Unlike Churchill, Haldane did not know Long. In fact, he had never even met him, but he could guess why the colonel had summoned him. It was his turn to take command of the armored train."|"Hero of the Empire"|"Candice Millard"

12:00|midday|"As the men shuffled their feet uncomfortably, kicking up loose pebbles on the flat, open stretch of dirt where they had been ordered to wait, the heat from a midday summer sun bore down on them. Haldane, trying with little luck to find some shade, pulled his hat low over his eyes. Peeking out from under the brim at the other prisoners, still divided into two groups, officers and soldiers, he suddenly spotted a man whom he knew to be an officer in the Natal Carbineers, the same regiment in which Brockie had claimed to be a lieutenant. Worried that the man would accidentally give their secret away, Haldane called him over and quickly muttered an explanation of the situation. Despite his efforts to protect the young sergeant major, however, Haldane watched in dismay as Brockie was pulled away and ordered to join the enlisted men. Minutes later, a large Boer policeman, one of the white-helmeted Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek Politie, or ZARPs, singled out another man—Winston Churchill."|"Hero of the Empire"|"Candice Millard"
"ap 07:00"|7:00|"On this night, for the first time, a current of excitement coursed through Churchill when the sun began to set. At ten minutes to 7:00, he and Haldane slipped away. They were accompanied by a few of the other officers, who knew what they intended to do and were willing to help them. Brockie would follow when he had received word from these men that his cohorts had made it over the fence."|"Hero of the Empire"|"Candice Millard"
19:00|"7:00 that night"|"At 7:00 that night, the men gathered on the back veranda, staring out at the fence and the guards. Churchill and Haldane, again accompanied by a few officers who would serve as lookouts, started out for the lavatory, leaving Brockie behind to wait for his signal. As had happened the night before, however, the sentry posted across from the lavatory did not stir. After waiting as long as they safely could, they once again agreed to postpone the escape and crossed the yard to rejoin Brockie on the veranda."|"Hero of the Empire"|"Candice Millard"
04:00|"4:00 in the morning"|"It was now 4:00 in the morning. Roughly nine hours had passed since his escape, but he would have to wait at least fourteen more before he could continue his journey. When he had first jumped from the train, he had felt the cold night air sharp on his hands and face and stealing through his thin flannel suit. With little humidity in the air, there was nothing to hold the heat after the sun went down. As it came up, however, Churchill knew that he would soon long for the chill of night."|"Hero of the Empire"|"Candice Millard"
"ap 10:00"|10:00|"He had experienced extreme heat before. In India, he had described it in tactile, almost anthropomorphic terms. “You could lift the heat with your hands,” he had written, “it sat on your shoulders like a knapsack, it rested on your head like a nightmare.” Now it was not only oppressive, it was a threat. The pool from which he had drunk before the sun rose was only about half a mile away, beckoning him, but it was too dangerous to walk even that short distance in the daylight. By 10:00, even in the shade of his grove, Churchill was boiling, and his thirst had returned with a vengeance. Because he had had nothing to eat since before dinner the previous day, he ate one of his four precious bars of chocolate, but it did little to satisfy his hunger and only heightened his thirst."|"Hero of the Empire"|"Candice Millard"
08:00|"8:00 a.m."|"When the barber arrived at the Staats Model School at 8:00 a.m. on December 13, he went straight to Churchill’s room, accompanied as always by a guard. Haldane tried to turn him away, telling him that Churchill would not need his services that day, but the barber was insistent. “Unfortunately, he was an inquisitive, persistent fellow,” Haldane wrote, “who was unwilling to depart before earning his expected fee.”"|"Hero of the Empire"|"Candice Millard"
"> 20:30"|"after 8:30 p.m."|"Despite Churchill’s attempts to protect his friends, the Boers’ fury fell first on those closest to him. He had hoped that by referring to his “friends on the outside,” he would make it seem as though he had had no help from inside the prison, either from his fellow inmates or from the guards. The letter, however, had done more harm than good. It was immediately apparent to the men Churchill had left behind that life for them would change dramatically. “Vengeance was now to be taken on us,” Hofmeyr wrote. “Everybody and everything was suspected.” They could no longer have visitors or walk outside after 8:30 p.m., buy newspapers or sleep on the veranda on the hottest nights. Nearly all of the privileges they had come to expect from the Boers were now stripped from them. “We were subjected to many petty annoyances,” Haldane wrote, “which displayed to fine advantage the narrow-minded and malicious nature which actuated our warders.”"|"Hero of the Empire"|"Candice Millard"
"ap 07:00"|"7 o’clock"|"Moving quickly through the town, ZARPs knocked on one door after another, looking for Churchill or any sign of him. For the rest of her life, Catherine Holmes, who was six years old at the time, would remember waking in the middle of the night and listening to the tense voices of her parents as they discussed the escape. “As there was a 7 o’clock curfew nobody could be out late,” she wrote years later. “My cousin had crept through the windows of the houses to warn us all that the Boer soldiers were coming to search the houses for Sir Winston.”"|"Hero of the Empire"|"Candice Millard"
"> 19:00"|"after 7 p.m."|"As the war intensified, even British trains would be forbidden to operate at night. A manual distributed by the Royal Engineers Institute declared that, with very few exceptions, “no trains are to run after 7 p.m. until daylight and until permission has been given…that traffic may be resumed.” The hope was that the trains would be safer during the day than at night, even though the derailment of Churchill’s armored train had been just one of dozens of attacks that had been carried out by the Boers in the full light of day."|"Hero of the Empire"|"Candice Millard"
"~ 03:00"|"about three in the morning"|"Standing up, he began walking toward the fires once again, this time moving quickly and with a clear sense of purpose. As fast as he walked, however, it took Churchill several hours to reach the fires, which had seemed to be much closer than they actually were. It was about three in the morning when he finally came close enough to get a good look at them, and what he saw made him stop in his tracks. Before him stood not a friendly, African kraal, but a coal mine."|"Hero of the Empire"|"Candice Millard"
05:30|"5:30 a.m."|"With his columns mobilized and his plan in place, there was little for Buller to do but begin the battle, with or without a visible enemy. At 5:30 a.m., when they had come within three miles of the river, his men abruptly stopped. The field guns pulled up behind them and, with little fanfare, opened fire. Instantly, the hills across the Tugela erupted like a roaring volcano, alive with sprays of red dust, a column of gray smoke rising hundreds of feet into the air, and a greenish plume of lyddite, the explosive used in British shells. “The cry of the shell through the air; the upheaval of smoke and earth and dust,” Atkins wrote. “These are the things that clamp your soul and will be the visions afterwards of wakeful nights.”"|"Hero of the Empire"|"Candice Millard"
"ap 03:00"|3:00|"As they approached the guns, the men were quickly separated in the onslaught, which intensified as soon as the Boers realized what they were attempting to do. The devastation was immediate, leaving one man and twelve horses dead, with five men wounded. Freddy Roberts seemed to vanish in the tumult of beating hooves and drumming bullets, a broad smile on his face. By 3:00, the last of the men had retreated, and the sounds of war had been silenced. The men could hear the river again, rushing between the crumbling red banks that still separated the two armies. Even the birds were back, but while some brought relief from the horrors of battle, others only heightened it. “The aasvogels gathered in numbers,” Atkins wrote, referring to the hook-beaked vultures, “wheeling overhead with an eye on the horrid banquet.”"|"Hero of the Empire"|"Candice Millard"
"ap 02:00"|2:00|"At 2:00 on the morning of December 19, the door to Churchill’s hidden room opened once again.

The man gratefully accepted, and Burnham, who had already been told once again that his boxcars would be detained, took the opportunity to ask his help. Could the guard hook his cars onto the next train that came into the station? Unfortunately, he couldn’t, the man told Burnham, because he would not be traveling any farther that night. He would, however, introduce him to the man who was to relieve him.

Standing just outside the goods gate, he kept a careful watch until, at 4:00 p.m., as promised, he saw his own seven trucks being shunted into the station yard. Knowing that if the soldier saw him return, he would not have a hope of avoiding arrest, Burnham quietly slipped back through the gate and quickly walked toward the freight cars, weaving his way between them until he came to the one that he knew was Churchill’s."|"Hero of the Empire"|"Candice Millard"
