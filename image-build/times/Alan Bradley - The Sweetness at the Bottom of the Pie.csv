"ap 03:44"|3:44|"WHEN I OPENED MY EYES, an oyster-colored dawn was peeping in at the windows. The hands of my brass alarm clock stood at 3:44. On Summer Time, daylight came early, and in less than a quarter of an hour, the sun should be up."|"The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie"|"Alan Bradley"

Was I now inducted, and would I be expected to take part in unspeakably bloody midnight rituals in the hedgerows? It seemed like an interesting possibility."|"The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie"|"Alan Bradley"

"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"I hugged myself with pleasure. If the stranger had come from Norway, dropped a dead bird on our doorstep before breakfast, and then appeared in Father's study after midnight, he must have been staying somewhere not far away. Somewhere within walking distance of Buckshaw. Some where such as right here in this very room at the Thirteen Drakes."|"The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie"|"Alan Bradley"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o'clock"|"Even in its mutilated form, the broken pastry reminded me that I had not eaten all day.

On the chimneypiece, an ormolu monstrosity, its brass pendulum, like the curved blade in “The Pit and the Pendulum,” tock-tocking away the time and flashing dully at the end of each swing in the subdued lighting of the room. On the bedside table, an exquisite little Georgian clock stood in silent disagreement: Her hands were at 3:15, his at 3:12."|"The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie"|"Alan Bradley"

Or was it?"|"The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie"|"Alan Bradley"
