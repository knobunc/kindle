               need of tuck-pointing for some time, sprayed bricks all over the yard. Most of the
               plumbing was wrecked, which means that the heating system is history, since the house
               used radiators. The plaster fell from the lath everywhere, cumulative tons of old

               which is their code name for a tiny cove on the west coast of Luzon, down beneath
               Mount Pinatubo, not all that far north of Subic Bay. The submarine glides in at around
               midnight, running on its electric motors so it won’t make any sound, and the Huks
               pull up alongside in rubber boats and outrigger canoes and unload the cargo. Sure
               enough, the transmitter’s there. And this time there’s none of those goddamn stickers
               or matchbooks. The cargo is ammunition and a few fighting men: some Fil-American commandoes
               fresh from a debriefing with MacArthur’s intelligence chief, and a couple of Americans—MacArthur’s
               advance scouts."|Cryptonomicon|"Neal Stephenson"

               and perseverance, he reaches  the town of Concepcion, and knocks on the door of their local contact around midnight.
               The contact is a prominent local citizen—the manager of the town’s only bank. Mr.
               Calagua is astonished to see an American standing at his back door. This tells Shaftoe
               that something must have gone wrong—the boys with the transmitter should have arrived
               a week ago. But the manager tells him that no one has shown up—though rumor has it

05:00|"five in the morning"|"The Nipponese have, and have always had, a marvelous skill with graphic images—this
               is clear in their manga and their anime, but reaches its fullest expressive flower
               in safety ideograms. Licking red flames, buildings splitting and falling as the jagged
               earth parts beneath them, a fleeing figure silhouetted in a doorway, suspended in
               the stroboscopic flash of a detonation. The written materials accompanying these images
               are, of course, not understandable to Randy, and so there is nothing for his rational
               mind to work on; the terrifying ideograms blaze, fragmentary nightmare images popping
               up on walls, and in the drawers of his room’s desk, whenever he lets his guard down
               for a moment. What he can read is not exactly soothing. Trying to sleep, he lies in
               bed, mentally checking the locations of his bedside emergency flashlight and the pair
               of freebie slippers (much too small) thoughtfully left there so that he can sprint
               out of the burning and collapsing hotel without cutting his feet to sashimi when the
               next magnitude 8.0 tremblor shivers the windows out of their frames. He stares up
               at the ceiling, which is fraught with safety equipment whose LEDs form a glowering
               red constellation, a crouching figure known to the ancient Greeks as Ganymede, the
               Anally Receptive Cupbearer, and to the Nipponese, as Hideo, the Plucky Disaster Relief
               Worker, bending over to probe a pile of jagged concrete slabs for anything that’s
               squishy. All of this leaves him in a state of free-floating terror. He gets up at
               five in the morning, grabs two capsules of Japanese Snack from his minibar, and leaves
               the hotel, following one of the two emergency exit routes that he has memorized. He
               starts wandering, thinking it would be fun to get lost. Getting lost happens in about
               thirty seconds. He should have brought his GPS, and marked the latitude and longitude
               of the hotel."|Cryptonomicon|"Neal Stephenson"
"ap > 10:00"|"after ten"|"She ends up on Randy’s lap, lying sideways on top of him, her head on his chest. “Close
               the door,” Amy says, and Randy does. Then she squirms around until she’s face to face
               with him, her pelvic center of gravity grinding mercilessly against the huge generalized
               region between navel and thigh that has, in recent months, become one big sex organ
               for him. She brackets his neck between her forearms and grabs the carotid supports
               of the whiplash arrestor. He’s busted. The obvious thing now would be a kiss, and
               she feints in that direction, but then reconsiders, as it seems like some serious
               looking is in order at this time. So they look at each other for probably a good minute.
               It’s not a moony kind of look that they share, not a starry-eyed thing by any means,
               more like a what the fuck have we gotten ourselves into thing. As if it’s really important to both of them that they mutually appreciate
               how serious everything is. Emotionally, yes, but also from a legal and, for lack of
               a better term, military standpoint. But once Amy is satisfied that her boy does indeed
               get it, on all of these fronts, she permits herself a vaguely incredulous-looking
               sneer that blossoms into a real grin, and then a chuckle that in a less heavily armed
               woman might be characterized as a giggle, and then, just to shut herself up, she pulls
               hard on the stainless steel goalposts of the whiplash arrestor and nuzzles her face
               up to Randy’s and, after ten heartbeats’ worth of exploratory sniffling and nuzzling,
               kisses him. It’s a chaste kiss that takes a long time to open up, which is totally
               consistent with Amy’s cautious, sardonic approach to everything, as well as with the
               hypothesis, alluded to once while they were driving to Whitman, that she is in fact
               a virgin."|Cryptonomicon|"Neal Stephenson"
12:00|midday|"They start working their way up the riverbed. Randy’s GPS indicates that Golgotha
               is less than two thousand meters upstream. The river begins to develop proper banks
               that get steadily higher and steeper. John Wayne clambers up onto the left bank and
               Jackie Woo onto the right, so that the high ground on either side will be guarded,
               or at least reconnoitered. They pass back into the shade of the canopy. The ground
               here is some kind of sedimentary rock with granite boulders embedded in it from place
               to place, like mixed nuts in half-melted chocolate. It must be nothing more than a
               scab of congealed ash and sediment on top of an underlying monolith of hard rock.
               Those who are down in the streambed move very slowly now. Part of the time they are
               down in the river, struggling upstream against a powerful current, and part of the
               time they are picking their way from boulder to boulder, or sidestepping along crumbling
               ledges of harder rock that protrude from the banks here and there. Every few minutes,
               Doug looks up and makes visual contact with Jackie Woo and John Wayne—who must be
               contending with challenges of their own, because sometimes they fall behind the main
               group. The trees only seem to get higher as they work their way up into the mountains,
               and now their height is accentuated by the fact that they are rooted in the top of
               a bank that rises above the stream two, five, ten, then twenty and thirty meters.
               The bank actually overhangs them now: the river’s gorge is a tube mostly buried in
               the earth, open to the sky only through a narrow slot in the top. But it’s close to
               midday and the sun is shining nearly straight down through it, illuminating all of
               the stuff that makes its way down from the heights. The corpse of a murdered insect
               drifts down from the upper canopy like winter’s first snowflake. Water seeping from the rims of the overhanging bank forms a drip curtain, each drop glittering
               like a diamond and making it nearly impossible to see the dark cavity behind. Yellow
               butterflies weave among those falling drops but never get hit."|Cryptonomicon|"Neal Stephenson"
