"ap 08:00"|"EIGHT o’clock"|"AT EIGHT o’clock on the evening of October 5, a dense crowd was milling in the rooms of the Gun Club at 21 Union Square. All the members who lived in Baltimore had responded to their president’s invitation. As for the corresponding members, express trains were bringing them in by the hundreds and they were pouring through the streets of the city. Large though the meeting hall was, it was unable to hold this influx of learned members, and so they overflowed into the adjoining rooms, the halls, and even into the grounds outside. There they encountered the ordinary people who were swarming around the doors, each one trying to make his way to the front, all eager to learn what President Barbicane’s important announcement was going to be, pushing, jostling, and crushing one another with the freedom of action that is peculiar to a populace that has been raised with the idea of self-government."|"From the Earth to the Moon"|"Jules Verne"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"When the detonating clock in the meeting hall struck eight, Barbicane suddenly stood up as though he were moved by a spring. A hush fell over the hall and he began speaking in a rather grandiloquent tone:"|"From the Earth to the Moon"|"Jules Verne"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"Then, as though it had understood that all this tumult concerned it, the moon came out and began shining in serene splendor, eclipsing all the flames with its intense radiance. The Americans all looked up at its glowing disk. Some of them waved to it, some called it affectionate names, some sized it up, some shook their fists at it. Between eight o’clock and midnight an optician on Jones Street made a fortune selling telescopes. The crowd stared at the moon through telescopes as though they were staring at a great lady through opera glasses. They treated it casually as if they owned it. It seemed that blonde Phoebe belonged to those bold conquerors and was already part of the territory of the Union. And yet they were planning only to send a projectile to the moon. This is a rather brusque way of establishing relations, even with a satellite, but it is in very common use by civilized nations."|"From the Earth to the Moon"|"Jules Verne"

00:00|midnight|"Even at midnight the general enthusiasm had still not begun to wane. It was maintained at an equal level in all classes of the population: politicians, scientists, businessmen, shopkeepers, laborers, intelligent people, and simpletons all felt stirred to their innermost depths. This was to be a national undertaking, so all parts of the city, and even the ships imprisoned in their basins, were overflowing with crowds drunk with joy, gin, and whiskey. Everyone was conversing, holding forth, discussing, arguing, approving, and applauding, from the gentlemen lolling on the soft benches of barrooms with mugs of sherry cobbler, to the boatmen getting drunk on knock-me-downs in the dark taverns of Fell’s Point."|"From the Earth to the Moon"|"Jules Verne"
"< 02:00"|"Toward two o’clock in the morning"|"Toward two o’clock in the morning the excitement finally died down. Barbicane succeeded in getting home, bruised, battered, and exhausted. Hercules himself would not have been able to withstand such enthusiasm. The crowd gradually deserted the streets and parks. The four railroads that converge at Baltimore scattered the multitude to the four corners of the United States and the city settled down to relative calm."|"From the Earth to the Moon"|"Jules Verne"
13:53|"thirteen hours, fifty-three minutes"|"If the projectile kept its initial velocity of 36,000 feet per second, it would take only about nine hours to reach its destination; but its velocity will be constantly diminishing, and calculation shows that it will take 300,000 seconds, or eighty-three hours and twenty minutes, to reach the point where the earth’s gravity is balanced by the moon’s, and from this point it will fall to the moon in 50,000 seconds, or thirteen hours, fifty-three minutes, and twenty seconds. It should therefore be launched ninety-seven hours, thirteen minutes, and twenty seconds before the moon arrives at the point of aim."|"From the Earth to the Moon"|"Jules Verne"
00:00|midnight|"As has been said above, the projectile should be launched when the moon is at its perigee. Furthermore, it should be launched when the moon is at the zenith. This will diminish the distance by the length of the earth’s radius, i.e., 3,919 miles, so that the actual distance to be covered will be 214,973 miles. But while the moon reaches its perigee each month, it is not always at the zenith when it does so. These two conditions coincide only at long intervals. The projectile should not be launched until they do. Fortunately this will be the case on December 4 of next year: at midnight the moon will be at its perigee, i.e., at its shortest distance from the earth, and at the same time it will reach the zenith."|"From the Earth to the Moon"|"Jules Verne"
22:46|"thirteen minutes and twenty seconds before eleven o’clock at night"|"The cannon must be located no more than twenty-eight degrees from the equator.
It must be aimed at the zenith.
The projectile must be given an initial velocity of 36,000 feet per second.
It must be launched on December 1 of next year, at thirteen minutes and twenty seconds before eleven o’clock at night.
It will strike the moon four days after its departure, on December 4 at exactly midnight, just as the moon reaches the zenith.

The members of the Gun Club must therefore begin work without delay and be ready to launch their projectile at the right time, for if they miss the date of December 4 they will not find the moon in the same conditions of perigee and zenith until eighteen years and eleven days later."|"From the Earth to the Moon"|"Jules Verne"

13:00|"one that makes day"|"The movement of rotation is the one that makes day and night on the moon’s surface; but there is only one day and one night per lunar month, and each lasts 354⅓ hours. Fortunately, however, the side turned toward the earth is illuminated by it with an intensity equal to the light of fourteen moons. As for the other side, which is always invisible to us, it naturally has 354? hours of profound darkness mitigated only by “the pale glow that falls from the stars.” This is due solely to the fact that the motions of rotation and revolution take place in exactly the same span of time, a phenomenon which, according to Cassini and Herschel, is common to the satellites of Jupiter, and probably to all other satellites as well."|"From the Earth to the Moon"|"Jules Verne"

10:00|"ten o’clock in the morning"|"By ten o’clock in the morning the little troop had ridden a dozen miles. The fertile fields were succeeded by a forest in which a wide variety of trees grew in tropical profusion. This almost impenetrable forest was composed of masses of vines and pomegranate, orange, lemon, fig, olive, apricot, and banana trees, whose fruit and blossoms rivaled one another in color and aroma. In the fragrant shade of those magnificent trees a whole world of brightly colored birds were singing and flying. Among them were boatbills, whose nest should be a jewel case in order to be worthy of them."|"From the Earth to the Moon"|"Jules Verne"
10:00|"ten o’clock in the morning"|"On October 31, at ten o’clock in the morning, this troop landed at Tampa. It is easy to imagine the agitation and activity which reigned in that small town, whose population had been doubled in one day. Tampa was to gain enormously from the Gun Club’s project, not because of the workers, who were immediately taken to Stone Hill, but because of the influx of curious people who gradually converged on the Florida peninsula from all parts of the world."|"From the Earth to the Moon"|"Jules Verne"
08:00|"eight o’clock in the morning"|"At eight o’clock in the morning the first pick struck the soil of Florida, and from then on that valiant tool was never idle in the hands of the diggers. They worked around the clock in six-hour shifts."|"From the Earth to the Moon"|"Jules Verne"
12:00|noon|"The casting was to take place at noon. The day before, each furnace had been loaded with 114,000 pounds of metal in bars, arranged in crosshatch stacks so that the hot air could circulate freely among them. The 1,200 chimneys had been spewing their torrents of flame into the air since morning, while the ground was being shaken by dull tremors. For each pound of metal to be melted, a pound of coal had to be burned, so 70,000 tons of coal sent up a thick curtain of black smoke before the sun."|"From the Earth to the Moon"|"Jules Verne"
"< 12:00"|"A few minutes before noon"|"A few minutes before noon, the first drops of metal began to flow. The basins gradually filled, and when the metal was entirely liquid it was kept at rest for a time, in order to facilitate the separation of foreign substances."|"From the Earth to the Moon"|"Jules Verne"
12:00|noon|"At exactly noon the cannon fired, throwing its tawny lightning into the air. Twelve hundred tapholes opened at once, and 1,200 snakes of fire crawled toward the central pit, straightening their incandescent coils. There, with a fearful uproar, they plunged to a depth of nine hundred feet. It was a moving and magnificent spectacle. The ground quivered while those cascades of metal, sending whirlwinds of smoke toward the sky, volatilized the moisture in the mold and shot it through the vent holes in the stonework in the form of dense vapor. These artificial clouds spiraled up to an altitude of 3,000 feet. An Indian wondering beyond the horizon might have believed that a new volcano was being formed in Florida, but this was not an eruption, a tornado, a storm, a struggle of the elements, or any of the other terrible phenomena that nature is capable of producing. No, it was man alone who had created those reddish vapors, those gigantic flames worthy of a volcano, those loud tremors that brought an earthquake to mind, that roar which could rival any hurricane, and it was his hand that had precipitated, into an abyss that he himself had dug, a whole Niagara of molten metal."|"From the Earth to the Moon"|"Jules Verne"

There was an even more significant symptom: the Americans’ violent passion for games and gambling had been overcome by their excited anticipation. The sight of tenpins lying on their sides, dice sleeping in their cups, motionless roulette wheels, abandoned cribbage boards, and cards used for playing whist, blackjack, monte, and faro enclosed in their unopened boxes, showed clearly that the great event of the day overshadowed everything else and left no room for diversions."|"From the Earth to the Moon"|"Jules Verne"
