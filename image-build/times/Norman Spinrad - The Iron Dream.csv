12:00|noon|"Feric somewhat dubiously watched the Finance Minister delivering a tedious economic report on the official noon news broadcast. The point of all this still eluded him; the public television broadcasts were controlled entirely by the present decadent regime. There was no doubt that television broadcasts were a propaganda tool of immense potential, reaching as they did public television receivers in every public square in Heldon. But since the government had absolute control of this means of communication, it seemed impossible that the Party would ever be able to use this latest wonder of Helder science for its own patriotic ends."|"The Iron Dream"|"Norman Spinrad"
12:00|noon|"When Best had collected all the documents, Feric turned to Bogel. “The new Council of State now consists of the present members of the Swastika Circle. I will rule by emergency decree until a new constitution can be written which permanently abolishes republican forms. Prepare the proclamation for broadcast at noon tomorrow.”"|"The Iron Dream"|"Norman Spinrad"
00:00|midnight|"As the hour of midnight approached, Feric Jaggar assumed his position in the observer’s seat of the lead Helder tank. Beside him in the driver’s position, Ludolf Best’s eyes shone with excitement and fanaticism. The true battle in this campaign would be with time itself, for the Borgravian army hardly qualified as a joke. Therefore the vanguard of the force that Feric had assembled just inside the south-eastern margin of the Emerald Wood consisted of a hundred and fifty tanks, well stocked with incendiary and high-explosive shells. Combined with the devastating force of a hundred dive-bombers even now winging their way toward the Borgravian capital, these tanks would be enough to pulverise all organised opposition within Borgravia in a matter of hours. As the tanks swept eastward across Borgravia, motorised infantry and motorcycle SS would mop up in their van, and by the time the tank force reached the Vetonian border, Remler would already have Classification Camps under construction."|"The Iron Dream"|"Norman Spinrad"
"ap < 00:50"|"almost ten to one"|"To the north, wave after wave of Helder dreadnoughts pounded the advancing Zind horde. The pilots had reported that this gargantuan force outnumbered even the huge Helder army by almost ten to one. Although the Helder planes had blasted every last Zind aerial dreadnought from the sky and ranged over the forces of Zind at will, vast formations of the mutated flyers hovered over the horde like swarms of huge venomous insects. In addition to the usual Warriors, war-wagons, and dreadnoughts, the scout planes had spotted several hundred tanks, Puller-drawn artillery, and vast troops of Warriors who seemed somehow different from the usual variety. Truly, the hosts of Zind were on the move in unprecedented force; upon the coming battle would hinge the future of the world for all time."|"The Iron Dream"|"Norman Spinrad"
12:00|noonday|"Suddenly the very sky seemed to explode; an enormous burst of light flashed into existence on the eastern horizon, a glare brighter than a thousand noonday suns that filled half the sky with its brilliance and leached the rest of all colour."|"The Iron Dream"|"Norman Spinrad"
