Why is it colder in the winter? Why can we see through air? Why is the barometric pressure measured in inches? How can you tell the temperature by listening to a cricket? How does the greenhouse effect work? What eventually becomes of a helium-filled balloon after you let it go outdoors?"|"What Einstein Didn't Know"|"Robert L. Wolke"

12:00|noon|"Picture the Earth as a sphere covered by a layer of air—the atmosphere—a couple of hundred miles thick. When the sun is directly overhead, its rays are coming down perpendicular to the atmosphere and to the ground, penetrating the least possible amount of atmosphere in the process. But when the sun is lower in the sky, its rays are coming to us obliquely and somewhat horizontally, having to penetrate much more of the atmosphere before getting to us. Because the atmosphere scatters and absorbs some sunlight, the more atmosphere the rays have to penetrate, the less intense they become. So low sun is weaker in intensity than high sun. Near sunrise or sunset, it is almost three hundred times dimmer than at noon."|"What Einstein Didn't Know"|"Robert L. Wolke"
12:00|noonday|"TRY IT
In a darkened room, shine the round beam of a penlight or tiny flashlight onto the surface of an orange. The penlight is the sun and the orange is the Earth. First hold the penlight directly above the equator, in noonday position. You’ll see a perfectly circular beam of sunlight landing on the Earth. Now, holding the sun the same distance from the Earth (makes you feel powerful, doesn’t it?), shine the beam onto the Earth obliquely, a little to the left (west) of where you had it before, in late afternoon position. You’ll see an oval-shaped light on the orange, as if the circle of sunlight has been smeared out. Well, it has been. The same amount of light is now spread out over a larger area, so of course its intensity at any one spot must be lower."|"What Einstein Didn't Know"|"Robert L. Wolke"
12:00|"high noon"|"If we wanted to, we could call this geometric effect the “cosine effect.” If you work out the trigonometry, it turns out that the intensity of sunlight on the ground falls off according to the cosine of the angle between straight overhead and the sun’s position. The intensity (and the cosine) decrease from full value at high noon on the equator to zero when the sun hits the horizon at sunset."|"What Einstein Didn't Know"|"Robert L. Wolke"
12:00|Mid-day|"It’s much the same with human skins: A light-skinned person may not feel as hot in the sun as a dark-skinned person will. When British imperialism was at its peak in parts of the world where the people have generally darker skins, Noel Coward immortalized that fact in his song, “Mad Dogs and Englishmen Go Out in the Mid-day Sun."|"What Einstein Didn't Know"|"Robert L.

00:00|midnight|"Incidentally, the green color that you see on pennies in the bottoms of fountains, tossed in by people who believe that one cent will bribe the Fates into granting a wish, and that are somehow overlooked by the midnight scavengers, is not the same, chemically, as the green color you observe on the roofs. It is due to other compounds of copper such as copper chloride and copper hydroxide that don’t have the same blue-green color and that don’t adhere very well to the metal."|"What Einstein Didn't Know"|"Robert L.
