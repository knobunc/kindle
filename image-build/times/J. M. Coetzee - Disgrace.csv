14:00|"two p.m."|"FOR A MAN of his age, fifty-two, divorced, he has, to his mind, solved the problem of sex rather well. On Thursday afternoons he drives to Green Point. Punctually at two p.m. he presses the buzzer at the entrance to Windsor Mansions, speaks his name, and enters. Waiting for him at the door of No. 113 is Soraya. He goes straight through to the bedroom, which is pleasant-smelling and softly lit, and undresses. Soraya emerges from the bathroom, drops her robe, slides into bed beside him. ‘Have you missed me?’ she asks. ‘I miss you all the time,’ he replies. He strokes her honey-brown body, unmarked by the sun; he stretches her out, kisses her breasts; they make love."|Disgrace|"J. M. Coetzee"
09:00|"nine in the morning"|"There is still Soraya. He ought to close that chapter. Instead, he pays a detective agency to track her down. Within days he has her real name, her address, her telephone number. He telephones at nine in the morning, when the husband and children will be out. ‘Soraya?’ he says. ‘This is David. How are you? When can I see you again?’"|Disgrace|"J. M. Coetzee"
"ap 07:30"|seven-thirty|"‘I live just nearby. Can I invite you in for a drink?’
A pause, cautious. ‘OK. But I have to be back by seven-thirty.’
From the gardens they pass into the quiet residential pocket where he has lived for the past twelve years, first with Rosalind, then, after the divorce, alone."|Disgrace|"J. M. Coetzee"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"At four o’clock the next afternoon he is at her flat. She opens the door wearing a crumpled T-shirt, cycling shorts, slippers in the shape of comic-book gophers which he finds silly, tasteless."|Disgrace|"J. M. Coetzee"
00:00|midnight|"She stays away the whole of the next week. Time after time he telephones, without reply. Then at midnight on Sunday the doorbell rings. It is Melanie, dressed from top to toe in black, with a little black woollen cap. Her face is strained; he steels himself for angry words, for a scene."|Disgrace|"J. M. Coetzee"
07:00|"seven in the morning"|"At seven in the morning, as the first birds are beginning to chirrup, he knocks at her door. She is awake, lying with the sheet drawn up to her chin, looking haggard."|Disgrace|"J. M. Coetzee"
12:00|noon|"‘I’m going to leave now,’ he says. ‘I have classes to meet. Try to sleep again. I’ll be back at noon, then we can talk.’ He strokes her hair, kisses her forehead. Mistress? Daughter? What, in her heart, is she trying to be? What is she offering him?"|Disgrace|"J. M. Coetzee"
12:00|noon|"When he returns at noon, she is up, sitting at the kitchen table, eating toast and honey and drinking tea. She seems thoroughly at home."|Disgrace|"J. M. Coetzee"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"He calls the Vice-Rector’s office and is given a five o’clock appointment, outside regular hours."|Disgrace|"J. M. Coetzee"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"At five o’clock he is waiting in the corridor. Aram Hakim, sleek and youthful, emerges and ushers him in. There are already two persons in the room: Elaine Winter, chair of his department, and Farodia Rassool from Social Sciences, who chairs the university-wide committee on discrimination."|Disgrace|"J. M. Coetzee"
12:00|noon|"ONCE HE HAS made up his mind to leave, there is little to hold him back. He clears out the refrigerator, locks up the house, and at noon is on the freeway. A stopover in Oudtshoorn, a crack-of-dawn departure: by mid-morning he is nearing his destination, the town of Salem on the Grahamstown–Kenton road in the Eastern Cape."|Disgrace|"J. M. Coetzee"
12:00|midday|"The house, which is large, dark, and, even at midday, chilly, dates from the time of large families, of guests by the wagonful. Six years ago Lucy moved in as a member of a commune, a tribe of young people who peddled leather goods and sunbaked pottery in Grahamstown and, in between stands of mealies, grew dagga. When the commune broke up, the rump moving on to New Bethesda, Lucy stayed behind on the smallholding with her friend Helen. She had fallen in love with the place, she said; she wanted to farm it properly. He helped her buy it. Now here she is, flowered dress, bare feet and all, in a house full of the smell of baking, no longer a child playing at farming but a solid countrywoman, a boervrou."|Disgrace|"J. M. Coetzee"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"By seven, with dawn touching the hills and the dogs beginning to stir, the job is done. The kombi is loaded with boxes of flowers, pockets of potatoes, onions, cabbage. Lucy drives, Petrus stays behind. The heater does not work; peering through the misted windscreen, she takes the Grahamstown road. He sits beside her, eating the sandwiches she has made. His nose drips; he hopes she does not notice."|Disgrace|"J. M. Coetzee"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"Lucy’s potatoes, tumbled out into a bushel basket, have been washed clean. Koos and Miems’s are still speckled with earth. In the course of the morning Lucy takes in nearly five hundred rand. Her flowers sell steadily; at eleven o’clock she drops her prices and the last of the produce goes. There is plenty of trade too at the milk-and-meat stall; but the old couple, seated side by side wooden and unsmiling, do less well."|Disgrace|"J. M. Coetzee"
"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"He sighs again. How brief the summer, before the autumn and then the winter! He reads on past midnight, yet even so cannot get to sleep."|Disgrace|"J. M. Coetzee"
"ap 05:45"|5.45|"He finds a seat between two hefty girls who might be sisters, one of them holding a moaning child, and a man with bloody wadding over his hand. He is twelfth in line. The clock on the wall says 5.45. He closes his good eye and slips into a swoon in which the two sisters continue to whisper together, chuchotantes. When he opens his eye the clock still says 5.45. Is it broken? No: the minute hand jerks and comes to rest on 5.46."|Disgrace|"J. M. Coetzee"

03:00|"three in the morning"|"She is right, of course. It is three in the morning. But he cannot fail to notice that for the second time in a day she has spoken to him as if to a child – a child or an old man."|Disgrace|"J. M. Coetzee"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"At nine o’clock, after Bill Shaw has gone off to work, he taps on Lucy’s door. She is lying with her face turned to the wall. He sits down beside her, touches her cheek. It is wet with tears."|Disgrace|"J. M. Coetzee"
"ap > 11:00"|"past eleven"|"It is past eleven, but Lucy shows no sign of emerging. Aimlessly he roams about the garden. A grey mood is settling on him. It is not just that he does not know what to do with himself. The events of yesterday have shocked him to the depths. The trembling, the weakness are only the first and most superficial signs of that shock. He has a sense that, inside him, a vital organ has been bruised, abused – perhaps even his heart. For the first time he has a taste of what it will be like to be an old man, tired to the bone, without hopes, without desires, indifferent to the future. Slumped on a plastic chair amid the stench of chicken feathers and rotting apples, he feels his interest in the world draining from him drop by drop. It may take weeks, it may take months before he is bled dry, but he is bleeding. When that is finished, he will be like a fly-casing in a spiderweb, brittle to the touch, lighter than rice-chaff, ready to float away."|Disgrace|"J. M. Coetzee"
"> 12:00"|"past noon"|"She is sitting on the sofa in pyjamas and dressing-gown, playing with the cat. It is past noon. The cat is young, alert, skittish. Lucy dangles the belt of the gown before it. The cat slaps at the belt, quick, light paw-blows, one-two-three-four."|Disgrace|"J. M. Coetzee"
12:00|noon|"Preparations for Petrus’s festivities begin at noon on Saturday with the arrival of a band of women half a dozen strong, wearing what looks to him like churchgoing finery. Behind the stable they get a fire going. Soon there comes on the wind the stench of boiling offal, from which he infers that the deed has been done, the double deed, that it is all over."|Disgrace|"J. M. Coetzee"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"At five o’clock the guests start arriving, by car, by taxi, on foot. He watches from behind the kitchen curtain. Most are of their host’s generation, staid, solid. There is one old woman over whom a particular fuss is made: wearing his blue suit and a garish pink shirt, Petrus comes all the way down the path to welcome her."|Disgrace|"J. M. Coetzee"
09:00|"nine a.m."|"The incinerator is anthracite-fuelled, with an electric fan to suck air through the flues; he guesses that it dates from the 1950s, when the hospital itself was built. It operates six days of the week, Monday to Saturday. On the seventh day it rests. When the crew arrive for work they first rake out the ashes from the previous day, then charge the fire. By nine a.m. temperatures of a thousand degrees centigrade are being generated in the inner chamber, hot enough to calcify bone. The fire is stoked until mid-morning; it takes all afternoon to cool down."|Disgrace|"J. M. Coetzee"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"At eleven o’clock there is a call for him in his hotel room. It is Isaacs. ‘I am phoning to wish you strength for the future.’ A pause. ‘There is a question I never got to ask, Mr Lurie. You are not hoping for us to intervene on your behalf, are you, with the university?’"|Disgrace|"J. M. Coetzee"
