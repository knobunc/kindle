00:00|midnight|"I suppose it would have been getting on for midnight when I fetched up at the rural retreat: and, being about ready for sleep by now, I lost no time in lighting a candle and toddling upstairs. As I opened the door of my room, I recollect I was thinking how particularly well a dollop of slumber would go: and I was just making for the bed with a song on my lips, so to speak, when something suddenly sat up in it."|"Thank You, Jeeves_"|"P.

I suppose it's some old Puritan strain in the Wooster blood. I drew myself up censoriously and shot a sternish glance in her direction. Absolutely wasted, of course, because it was pitch dark."|"Thank You, Jeeves_"|"P. G. Wodehouse"

"ap 07:00"|seven|"At seven on the dot, accordingly, I stepped aboard the yacht and handed the hat and light overcoat to a passing salt. It was with mixed feelings that I did so, for conflicting emotions were warring in the bosom. On the one hand, the keen ozone of Chuffnell Regis had given me a good appetite, and I knew from recollections of his hosp. in New York that J. Washburn Stoker did his guests well. On the other, I had never been what you might call tranquil in his society, and I was not looking forward to it particularly now. You might put it like this if you cared to â€“ The fleshly or corporeal Wooster was anticipating the binge with pleasure, but his spiritual side rather recoiled a bit."|"Thank You, Jeeves_"|"P. G.

There was not even a sign of Police Sergeant Voules or Constable Dobson. Chuffnell Regis slept, as you might say. And yet, looking at my watch, I found that the hour was only a few minutes after nine. It gave me quite a start, I recall. What with stress of emotion, so to speak, and the spirit having been on the rack, as it were, I had got the impression that the night was particularly well advanced, and wouldn't have been surprised to find it one in the morning."|"Thank You, Jeeves_"|"P.

"ap 02:59"|"one to three"|"What I describe as the sitting-room, I must tell you, was really more in the nature of a sort of lounge-hall. It was rather liberally furnished for such a smallish place, and contained a table, a grandfather clock, a sofa, two chairs, and from one to three glass cases with stuffed birds in them. From where I stood, looking over the banisters, I had a complete view of the entire lay-out. It was fairly dim down there, but I could see pretty well, because there was an oil lamp burning on the mantelpiece. By its light I was able to observe that the sofa had been upset, the two chairs thrown through the window, and the stuffed-bird cases smashed; and at the moment of going to press, a shadowy form was in the far corner, wrestling with the grandfather clock."|"Thank You, Jeeves_"|"P.

Well, here I am, what?
Yes, but your bally house has burned down.


Not mine. Chuffy's.
Yes, I know, but all your things are in it.


Nothing of value.
How about the banjolele?


Oh, my gosh! That's true.
I thought that would make you think a bit.


You needn't rub it in.
I'm not rubbing it in. I am merely saying that your banjolele has been reduced to a heap of ashes.


Well, I'd have looked a damn sight sillier if it had been me.
A footling bit of reasoning.


Well, anyway, I've got away from old Stoker.
How do you know you have?


He hasn't caught me yet.
No, but he may.


I've still time to get that 10.21 train.
My poor ass, you can't go getting on trains with your face all black.


Butter will remove the blacking
Yes, but you have no butter.


I can buy some.
How? Got any money on you?


Well, no.
Ah!


Why shouldn't I get someone to give me butter?
Who?


Why, Jeeves, of course. All I have to do is to go to the Hall and put the whole case before Jeeves and tell him to rally round, and there I'll be, as right as rain, with nothing more to worry about. Jeeves will know where to lay his hand on seas of butter. You see! It's perfectly simple if you think it out and don't lose your head."|"Thank You, Jeeves_"|"P. G. Wodehouse"

Shortly after that, I should be the old pink-cheeked clubman once more. And, in due season, I should be safely inside the 11.50 train, on my way to London and safety."|"Thank You, Jeeves_"|"P. G.
