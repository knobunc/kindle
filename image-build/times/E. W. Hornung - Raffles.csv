mean Rosenthall himself, and that pasty-faced beast Purvis.  They
were up and drinking from midnight, when they came in, to broad
daylight, when I cleared out.  Even then I left them sober enough
to slang each other.  By the way, they very nearly came to blows
in the garden, within a few yards of me, and I heard something

to-morrow night: there's nothing subtle in my plan.  It's simply
to get in while these fellows are out on the loose, and to lie
low till they come back, and longer.  If possible, we must doctor
the whiskey.  That would simplify the whole thing, though it's
not a very sporting game to play; still, we must remember
Rosenthall's revolver; we don't want him to sign his name on US.

Metropole, it's got to be done from the inside.  Problem one, how
to get at the fellow. Only one sort of pretext would do—it must
be something to do with this blessed picture, so that I might see
where he'd got it and all that.  Well, I couldn't go and ask to
see it out of curiosity, and I couldn't go as a second
representative of the other old chap, and it was thinking how I
could go that made me such a bear at lunch.  But I saw my way
before we got up.  If I could only lay hold of a copy of the
picture I might ask leave to go and compare it with the original.
So down I went to Esher to find out if there was a copy in
existence, and was at Broom Hall for one hour and a half
yesterday afternoon.  There was no copy there, but they must
exist, for Sir Bernard himself (there's 'copy' THERE!) has
allowed a couple to be made since the picture has been in his
possession. He hunted up the painters' addresses, and the rest of
the evening I spent in hunting up the painters themselves; but
their work had been done on commission; one copy had gone out of
