06:30|"6:30 A.M."|"At 6:30 A.M. of a dishwater-gray, electric-lighted dawn, the echo of the alarm clock still in my ears, I felt my way into the bathroom with my eyes shut, thus gaining an extra six seconds’ sleep. At the medicine-cabinet mirror, eyes still closed, I stood, hoping as always that when I opened them something would have happened overnight, and I’d see a change. But nothing had changed, not for the better anyway."|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"

But it’s obviously true, something, quite simply, to be faced and accepted, that you just don’t love me any more.” And oh boy, there at 6:43 A.M. she began to bawl again."|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
"ap > 10:00"|"A little after ten"|"A little after ten I had coffee in the drugstore downstairs with Ralph and Eddie at a crumb-littered, strawberry-jam-smeared table, ankle-deep in lipsticked paper napkins, discarded straw-wrappers, and crumpled cigarette packages. In a flurry of time-tested whimsy we matched to see who’d pay, and Ralph lost, pantomiming chagrin, while Eddie and I joshed him humorously. “You just don’t live right, Ralph!” I said; then we crept upstairs again, and I found a note from the boss’s secretary on my desk. He’d been looking for me; he was in a hurry to see a copy of a report I had, and it took me forty-five minutes to find it, in a folder it had no business being in."|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
"ap ~ 04:30"|"About four-thirty"|"The red second-hands of the office clocks continued to revolve in perfect, irritating synchronization sixty times every hour, and another lost day slipped by. About four-thirty I walked down the hall, and turned into Accounting to see Miss Wilmar, high priestess of our office computers. “Hi, honey. Do me a favor.”"|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
"ap 05:11"|"eleven minutes past five"|"At eleven minutes past five I stepped safely out of the automatic elevators for one more time, fully aware that the odds against me increased each time I used them. I walked out of the building, toward Herman’s newsstand, a dime in one hand, the other gripping the butt of a Colt .45 Frontier model with a filed hair trigger, Holden beside me murmuring encouragement and all. At the counter I put down my dime, and in one blurred motion Herman snatched up a New York Post, simultaneously folding it and humorously slipping it under my gun arm. To raise my arm and fire meant losing my paper, so, outwitted again, I smiled weakly and walked on, letting the gun slide from my fingers and drop in the gutter as I stopped at the curb for the DON’T WALK sign. Without glancing at me or moving her lips, a lovely black-haired girl who was standing beside me murmured, “I’ve been following you for days; the very way you hold the paper under your arm thrills me. I have a suite just down the street at the Commodore Hotel; please come with me!”"|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
00:00|midnight|"Smiling, she walked off screen left as a lovely Polynesian girl, similarly dressed, crossed the screen from the right. “Also available,” she was saying, and she twitched her hips so that her gown opened momentarily to reveal a marvelously unbroken expanse of dusky skin, “in Tahiti tan!” A beautiful Chinese girl following directly behind her murmured, “ . . . in sunset yellow!” demonstrating as she walked how effective this shade was, too. “ . . . midnight black!” said a magnificent black girl as she crossed the screen. “And in the West,” said a terrific-looking Indian girl in full tribal headdress and almost nothing else, “dawnblush red!” She moved off in a cute little war dance, thrusting her unblemished red stomach forward at each step. To soft harp music, the screen went black and the film ended."|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
"< 12:00"|"nearly noon"|"At my free-form desk—beautiful, but with a tear-shaped hole in the middle through which I tended to occasionally knock one or more of my telephones with my elbow—I read my mail, dictated some replies to the lovely-limbed goddess who was my secretary, made a phone call to Frank Flannel in Production, and what with one thing and another it was nearly noon before I even leaned back in my chair to stretch. For a moment I sat there, glancing around my office, admiring the Jacob Epstein bust in one corner and the tremendous view of Manhattan to the south. Then I grinned, and on impulse pulled the Manhattan phone book over. I turned to the S’s, ran a forefinger down the first column, and sure enough, though the address was different, there it was: Saf-T Products."|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
"ap 05:30"|five-thirty|"The day flashed by, and at five-thirty I rode downstairs, anxious and happy to hurry home to Tess and renew our glorious acquaintance. Stepping out into the Doc Pepper lobby, I glanced into the building drugstore and on impulse turned in. It looked just about the same, it seemed to me, as the Chrysler Building drugstore. I glanced around, and yes, there it stood: the bargain counter of various doodads such as pillboxes. I began poking through the stuff and found it right away: the little gilt pillbox with the jewel-encrusted top. Walking toward the counter with it, I looked for the candy display but it wasn’t there."|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"

12:00|noon|"It was a noon wedding, and I had to go back to the office and work, or at least go through the motions. When I got there I had a phone call from the chairman of the board. He was all excited about a new promotion idea of mine, a series of ads in show-biz publications offering to chorus girls and nightclub entertainers, for a limited time only, a free navel-size zircon with a trial box of Navel-O-No. He raised my salary and gave me a stock option."|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"

"ap 05:30"|five-thirty|"I was up at five-thirty, and after a little initial difficulty managed to straighten up and stand erect. By six I was at the office, strangely empty and silent except for my steps across the brown vinyl tiles. I unplugged the giant duplicating machine, rolled it across to Bert Glahn’s office, and inside. I put it in the center of the room facing the doorway, plugged it in, then sat down at Bert’s desk, drew a sheet of paper toward me, and in mod-style lettering printed You are a Neanderthal jackanapes and I quit, and signed my name. I inserted it into the behemoth, set the dial at 5,000 copies, turned it on, and removed the receiving tray so that the duplicates floated, gliding and swooping, out into the room."|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"As soon as they opened, at eight o’clock, I bought a pocket-size Japanese tape recorder at a discount house for $19.95 and took it to my room. With my transistor radio facing the microphone on the dresser top, I recorded a WNEW station announcement, then shut off the tape and sat listening for an hour or so to one commercial after another, switching from station to station to hear as many as I could, sort of getting the tone. I wrote briefly on the back of an envelope, switched on the tape, and read into the microphone in a fine, sonorous voice."|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"I was there at five o’clock, loitering in a doorway just down the street; Hetty came out a few minutes later, but unfortunately with Custer, who must have been waiting in the lobby. I followed them to a restaurant and, walking slowly past the window, my coat collar turned up, saw them greeted as old friends by the proprietor, and ushered to what was obviously their favorite booth. Gnashing my teeth, I walked slowly back past the window again, a handkerchief at my face, and watched Custer give an order, the proprietor bowing gleefully and scurrying away. They didn’t have menus, so I knew they’d ordered drinks; I also knew that unless Hetty had changed enormously, the drinks would arrive and she’d taste hers, smile, stand up, and go to the ladies’ room to fix her face."|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
"ap ~ 10:30"|"around ten-thirty"|"Later it occurred to me that Hetty might have stuck out her tongue affectionately; there were two ways to interpret it. So I phoned her around ten-thirty. “Darling? This is B—” Dial tone."|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
"ap ~ 06:00"|"around six"|"The circular in one of the junk letters said, “Accept this amazing offer! Try Time for a month, and see if your evenings aren’t more rewarding!” and I replaced Time with Ben. The other ad was a soap coupon, “Good for one bar of Dove”; I replaced bar with night, and Dove with Love, and added my name at the bottom. I pasted one of my own stamps over each real stamp on all the envelopes, walked around to the apartment building, and dropped the mail into Hetty’s box. That night, around six, I phoned. I said, “This is Ben, sweetie,” and she replied with a short string of words I didn’t think she knew and hung up before I could reply. Still, I told myself, she’d at least answered me, and that was progress."|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
"~ 00:00"|"around midnight"|"Late Sunday afternoon, working in the super’s coveralls, I finished. The wall phone was ringing, and I answered in a fake Polish accent; it was some sort of complaint, about a bathroom flooding, and I said I’d be up first thing Monday. Then I set right to work again, using a rechargeable seltzer bottle and five pounds of sugar I’d brought downstairs. Mixing up bottle after bottle, I finally got pretty much the taste I was after. Then I sat sketching; first in pencil, discarding; then refining; and finally, around midnight, finishing up pretty carefully in colored inks."|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"There was no time for self-pity. At two o’clock—Perce Shelley had done his work well—I sat in the office of the president of a large and important company. He listened to me, nodding politely; then I took the glass from the carafe set on his desk, and filled it from the stoppered bottle I’d brought along. “Looks like water,” he said doubtfully, holding it to the light; then he tasted it, and shrugged. “And what would you call it?” he said."|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"All that night I typed, down in the furnace room; my fingers were literally bleeding when I stoked up the furnace at dawn. But I delivered my stuff at nine sharp, then walked the streets, sat in parks, and drank a dozen cups of coffee in a dozen places till my four o’clock appointment, when I was back. “We don’t usually read quite this fast, you know,” my man said reprovingly, “but since Manny put it on the basis of a personal favor . . .” He shrugged, and leaned back in his swivel chair; he was a guy around forty, I thought, who looked twenty-six, wearing a gray tweed coat and a pipe. “Anyway, I’ve read your first chapters and outlines. This first one”—he riffled the pages with his thumb—“what’s it called again?”"|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
"ap 06:30"|six-thirty|"He told me: he’d had a little cold, and stayed home from the office a couple days, but he was back now; he still felt a little stuffy, but was definitely better. What could he do for me? I said I had a very important favor to ask. I would like him, if he would, to pay me in cash tomorrow. In comparatively small bills; say hundreds. And I’d appreciate it if the transaction could take place with just the two of us present; in my home, perhaps. I lowered my voice conspiratorially: it was a matter of taxes, I said; I knew he’d understand. He replied, with the businessman’s chuckle, that he certainly did, would be glad to oblige, and I gave him my address, suggesting six-thirty tomorrow evening."|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
"ap 06:30"|six-thirty|"Phase Two: I walked half a block to another phone booth, so that my calls couldn’t be traced. I wasn’t sure who would be tracing them or how, but felt it best not to take unnecessary chances. I’d listened carefully to Swanson’s voice, and when Custer came on, I said, “Ed Swanson, Mr. Huppfelt,” and knew I sounded just like him. He asked how my cold was, and I said it was better, though I was still a little stuffy; I’d stayed home a couple days, because I’d noticed that if you went right to bed with a cold, you saved time in the long run. He asked what he could do for me, and I said I had a very important favor to ask. I preferred to pay him in cash tomorrow; in comparatively small bills, say hundreds. And I’d appreciate it if the transaction would take place with only the two of us present; I thought his home might be best; say six-thirty tomorrow? Lowering my voice, I said it was a tax matter, and that I knew he’d understand. I doubt if there’s a businessman with soul so dead that he’d admit he didn’t, and Custer chuckled, businessmanlike, and said he certainly did; it was fine with him, and at his house; he had a wall safe in his study. Stepping out of the phone booth, I hardly cared for the moment whether crime paid or not; this was fun!"|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
"ap 05:11"|5:11|"5:11, and—oh, about 25 seconds: Subject walked out of office-building lobby; took cab. I foresightedly had cab waiting just down street, me inside.

"ap 05:43"|5:43|"5:43, watch stopped. Anyway, Cus went home, taking a bus for the five or six miles to Whipley, New Jersey, then walking three blocks from the bus stop. I envied him a little, “shadowing” him, as we say; this was a nice old-fashioned-looking town, with quiet streets and a lot of trees. Like others we passed, Custer’s house occupied what must have been nearly an eighth of a city block. It was on a corner lot surrounded by a shoulder-high wall of fine old brick; along the top of the wall ran a foot-high fence of ironwork. Two tall arch-topped wrought-iron gates opened onto a brick path leading up to the house, which was set far back from the street. The house was a fine steep-roofed Victorian with gables, dormer windows, and trim around the eaves; there was a round tower at one corner with a skyrocket-shaped roof, a great wide front porch, everything nicely painted in maroon and white."|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
"ap 05:03"|5:03|"It was worth the search, though, because I found exactly what I was looking for, in a shop one flight up, the owner in one of the Bela Lugosi costumes he was closing out at $19.95. He was lying in a coffin when I walked in, reading the World-Sun. “Drrrink your blut!” he said in greeting, not looking up; he finished the item he was reading, then stood up, spreading his cape like bat wings. “Blood-stain-resistant! It’s Cravenetted!” he said, but I said no, explained what I wanted, and he produced just the thing, an absolute marvel. At 5:03—less than three hours left!—I was on an early ferry to Jersey."|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"

"ap 04:30"|four-thirty|"But we did. For the rest of the day except for a fifteen-minute sandwich lunch in the kitchen—Al, tidy soul that he is, kindly disposing of my crusts—we peeled wallpaper, watching for more writing to appear. None did, and by four-thirty the room was stripped to the rose-patterned paper on all four walls and in the window-seat bay. Once more, then, we stood looking at the wall to the left of the fireplace: Marion Marsh lived here, June 14, 1926. Read it and weep! we read again. Then I changed clothes to drive to the airport."|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
"ap 06:30"|six-thirty|"The airport is always crowded but it wasn’t bad this time of day and year, and the plane was on time. We were home by six-thirty, talking all the way back to the city catching up on the news. There wasn’t much: we keep in fairly close touch with a letter every couple of weeks or so and an evening phone call once in a while. We get along pretty well, my dad and I; my mother is dead."|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
00:00|midnight|"Drinks in hand, staring at Marion’s wall again, the group rang changes on what might appear on further layers of the Cheyneys’ wallpaper: a huge X covering the largest wall, which would be King Kong’s autograph; Walt Disney’s denunciation of Mickey Mouse’s sexual extravagances. But the actuality of the great red scrawl couldn’t be joked away, it retained its mystery, and there wasn’t one of us, including Jan and me, who at some moment of the evening didn’t find himself standing and staring at Marion’s wall. After the party, doing the dishes, letting Al in for a little midnight snack before throwing him out again to his backyard dog-house, we decided there was no question now of removing Marion’s message; it had become the showpiece of the house."|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
21:30|"9:30 p.m."|"Thursday Evening, June 14, I read at the top of the page, and saw that Jan’s lacquered nail was touching the little TV-screen-shaped spot on which a 9 was superimposed in white. This was today’s date; Channel 9 was the Bay Area Public Television station. I took the magazine and, walking upstairs behind Jan, read the listing: 9:30 p.m., THE TOY THAT GREW UP. “Flaming Flappers,” silent film of the Twenties starring Richard Abel and Blanche Purvell: hip flasks, flaming youth, fast cars, and fast parties. Piano accompaniment following original cue sheets by Mabel Ordway."|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
"ap 09:30"|nine-thirty|"I was grinning when we hit the top of the stairs and said, “Kiddo, you don’t know it, but you probably just saved my life.” I kissed Jan, genuinely, so that she actually flushed. “Now how in the hell am I going to wait till nine-thirty?”"|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
"ap 09:28"|nine-twenty-eight|"At nine-twenty-eight I switched on the set in the living room, turned to 9, and stood waiting for sound and picture; across the room Jan sat on the chesterfield watching, and Al lay on the rug before it, more or less knocked out as he generally is after his dinner. The sound came on, music over a man’s voice, the music rising in volume as the voice receded. Then the picture popped on, swelling to fill the screen, rolling slowly; I tuned it to sharpness as the rolling slowed and stopped. Two men in molded-plastic chairs sat facing each other, one listening and slowly nodding, the lips of the other moving soundlessly as the music overrode his voice completely. They began contracting into the distance as the camera drew away, the men continuing to talk, one of them throwing his head back to laugh, as though they were so caught up they were unaware the program was ending."|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
"ap < 10:30"|"nearly ten-thirty"|"We sat watching the picture for a few moments longer, then Jan said, “I don’t think I can take another half hour of this, Nick; it’s nearly ten-thirty, and I’m tired.

12:00|noon|"But I wasn’t doing it now; I had more on my mind than Zee paper towels. All morning, beginning as soon as my eyes opened, I’d done my best to think sensibly about whatever it was that had happened last night. At noon I grabbed a quick lunch alone so that I’d have time to walk—first to the Ferry Building at the head of Market Street, then along past the covered docks and the glimpses of Bay between them—and think some more, trying to reach some conclusion."|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
"< 12:00"|"A little before noon"|"A little before noon I stood in the kitchen in pajamas and slippers waiting for the toast to pop up, trying not to listen to the loud plopping pulselike gurgle of the percolator. I had a full-blown hangover, and it helped to stand absolutely still while I waited, arms hanging at my sides, eyes closed; when the toaster popped it made me wince. I had to make my way to the other side of the kitchen then, but by walking without lifting the soles of my slippers from the linoleum I managed. Getting the plates out wasn’t too bad, but the trays are propped in the narrow space between stove and refrigerator, resting on the floor on their edges, and I had to stoop. I made it by bending very slowly, at the knees only, eyes straight ahead, locating a tray by feel."|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"

Marion Marsh lived here, I read once more, June 14, 1926, the back of the chesterfield cutting off the rest. Then I stood up, walked out to the kitchen and the phone, and dialed my dad’s area code and number; it was about eight o’clock here, ten in Chicago. He answered right away, and we talked; every once in a while one or the other of us phoned, particularly when a letter was a bit overdue. He’d run into an old friend of mine in the Loop, Eddie Krueger, who’d been at our house a lot when I was in high school and when I’d come home during vacations from college, my mother still alive. “And,” he said, “the weather’s been lousy, but that’s to be expected.”"|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"

I wonder if I could reach him there?” She listened, then nodded. “On North Gower Street; thank you very much.” She put the phone aside slowly and looked over at me, her face suddenly frightened. “He’s on his way to the studio—he’s still in pictures. Oh, Nickie, I’m scared! He’s my only hope, really; I’ve been hunting through the phone books, and of all the people I knew there’s no one else could possibly still be in pictures.

"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"When we turned onto Keever Street and I read the street sign, I glanced around, not sure whether this was Beverly Hills or not: it didn’t look like my idea of Beverly Hills. There were small businesses on both sides of the street: an enormous brilliantly lighted drugstore, the people in it actually pushing shopping carts; a discount record place; a dry cleaner; gas stations; three take-out food places in a row, all busy—it was only nine o’clock. And scattered among them, alone and in twos and threes, were the asbestos-shingle-covered remains of the residential area this had once been. They were no longer one-family residences—you could see eight or ten mail slots on every porch—but rooming houses, with no future now but demolition. The area wasn’t shabby, I don’t think that’s allowed, but it was the Los Angeles equivalent."|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
"ap ~ 11:00"|"Around eleven"|"Back at the hotel, I told Jan about the day and about Rodolpho Guglielmi, and she listened, shaking her head, looking at me to smile incredulously and shake her head again. And we talked about Marion, saying what little there was to say. On our way through the lobby I’d bought a Los Angeles Times, and we sat in bed looking through it, but it seemed hard to follow and without any real news, the way an out-of-town paper generally does. I got up and standing at the desk turned through the pages of the little magazine telling what there was to do in town, almost none of it outside this hotel, apparently. There were some postcards in a drawer, already stamped by the management, I discovered, a thoughtful “touch.” And since I knew I was paying for it, I picked one—a view of the pool—and sat down and wrote a card. “Dear Al: Well, here we are in glamorous, exciting Hollywood, ‘seeing the stars’! Tomorrow, Forest Lawn, to visit the world-famed mausoleum of Felix the Cat. Love, yr. friend, Nick.” There was no one in the hall, and leaving the room door open, I darted out in pajamas, dropped the card in the chute next to the elevator, and got back safe and sound. Around eleven, or a couple minutes past, we turned out the lights, and almost instantly the phone rang."|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
"ap 01:00"|one|"“Hugo Dahl, goddamn it! I been phoning all night every half hour! Now, listen: you saw the guy with me in the projection room? Young; bald; brown suit? Well, that’s Jerry Houk! A producer here. Movies, not television; he’s a big man here, and he likes you. They’re making a picture, finishing it up. But there’s a part in it. Very small. One quick scene. Which they’ve already filmed. But they’re still on the same set; tomorrow’s the last day. Be there at one and they’ll try to get in a couple of takes of you in the part before they wrap up. If they like it, they’ll use it. Okay? Jesus, I been trying to reach you for an hour and a half!”"|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
"ap 01:00"|one|"For an instant longer Jan hesitated. Then, voice firm, she replied. “Yes. Yes, this is Marion Marsh. And I’ll be there. Tomorrow at one. I was stunned for a moment, Mr. Dahl, and couldn’t talk. But I’ll be there. And I can’t tell you how much I appreciate it.”"|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
"ap > 04:00"|"a little after four o’clock"|"At a little after four o’clock the scene ended for the third time, and the director called, “All right, that’ll do it.” He sighed, blinked a few times, took a clipboard from the other man, and looked at it. Then he looked over at us, handing back the clipboard, and came over."|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"

"ap < 01:00"|"nearly one o’clock"|"Shirley and Jo went to the kitchen and brought out second hamburgers, and Harry offered more beer or wine. They stayed out till the street lamps came on, then the air turned chilly, and they went inside. Shirley wouldn’t play bridge, but got out a Monopoly board, and they sat at the all-purpose card table beside the kitchen, and played till nearly one o’clock."|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
"ap 10:30"|ten-thirty|"Lew knew these were omens pointing toward some more solid piece of good fortune ahead, which came at ten-thirty. Walking along the wide, green-carpeted corridor hung with Rowaldson prints which led past Partners’ Row, he heard, “Oh, Lew, got a second?” It was Willard Briggs, smiling out at him from his desk, and Lew replied silently, I do indeed have a second, and turned in. Approaching the small, delicate desk, a valuable antique inlaid at front and sides with porcelain ovals depicting eighteenth-century hunting scenes, he understood that Briggs had been waiting for him inevitably to pass: ordinarily this office door was kept closed. He said, “Morning, Will”—the firm was carefully informal—and sat down at Brigg’s gesture."|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"“I don’t know; I don’t remember. But we spent a night in a Pullman. In a compartment or whatever it’s called; three berths, and they gave me the lower so I could look out the window. In the middle of the night, maybe two or three in the morning, I woke up, and of course I raised the blind. I couldn’t see much, just blackness. Then we tore through a little town—fast, racing through, the train making time at night. I had a quick flash of a little street, a row of wooden houses and big trees in the light from street lamps; and just a glimpse down a little empty main street. And heard the crossing bell: you know the sound: DING, ding, ding, ding, ding, fading away fast."|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
"ap 02:20"|"two twenty"|"The night of his third walk Lew slept in his own apartment. When his eyes opened at two twenty, by the green hands of his alarm, he knew that this time he’d actually been waiting for it in his sleep. Flipping the coverings aside, knowing what he was about to do, an excitement shot through him sharp as a touch of flame. Dressing, staring at his face in the mirrorlike window pane, it occurred to him, troubling him a little, that the intensity of his pleasure at again going out into the compelling mystery that drew him there was greater than at anything else that had happened to him all that week."|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
03:00|"3 A.M."|"“Oh, I don’t. It was hearing about it in the middle of the night that I objected to. I’m told you were all for breaking the news to me at 3 A.M.” He smiled, and Lew did, too, relieved."|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
"ap 02:30"|"two thirty"|"Their alarms having rung in the darkness of their bedrooms some minutes before, the two couples met on the driveway between their buildings at two thirty. Glancing doubtfully around in the dim light from the stars and a partial moon, they exchanged semiwhispered greetings. Then Harry, Jo, and even Shirley stood waiting apathetically, shoulders hunched against the lingering pull of interrupted sleep. Jo wore her white Irish knit sweater and tasseled cap, Lew’s red daypack containing a thermos of coffee strapped to her back; Shirley again in bleached raincoat, and pants, though without a scarf tonight; Lew in the clothes he’d worn on other nights; Harry wore a black baseball cap and green nylon jacket, fists tucked up into the slanted breast pockets of his jacket. Their interest, Lew saw, was minimal now, and he felt resentful: these walks at night had been his alone, he hadn’t asked them to join him. “Well, let’s go,” he muttered, and walked down the driveway. Turning right, toward the shoreline road, he led them straggling down the silent street past the dark apartments."|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
07:30|"Seven-thirty in the morning"|"“But we didn’t defy anything, did we, Lew? We just sneaked onto it when it was safe. Looking both ways first. We were like kids making faces at Daddy when he’s taking a nap. The time to do it would be now.” He smiled, interested at the thought. “Seven-thirty in the morning. You and I climb the fence, and just bulldoze our way out into the middle of the god-damn road, cars hitting their brakes. We face the traffic, straddling the markers, and block all three lanes. The cars behind us move on, the road clears, and we turn around and start running all over the fucking freeway. Bring a real ball, and pass it, kick it, run with it, tackle. Cars backed up to San Rafael, every horn blasting, guys leaning out yelling blue murder.”"|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
"ap 02:15"|"two fifteen"|"It did. When the alarm rang at two fifteen, Lew shut it off, snapped on the little bedside lamp, then swung his feet to the floor to sit on the edge of the bed, holding his eyes open. Jo had gotten up instantly, and now the kitchen light came on, then the small sounds of Jo starting the coffee maker, which she’d left filled and ready to plug in. The phone rang, he picked it up from the little table, and as he put it to his ear he heard Jo’s voice on the kitchen extension: “Hello . . . ?”"|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
02:30|"2:30 A.M."|"“Why not?” said Harry. “Who’s going to call at 2:30 A.M. with a better idea? Yippee, to quote Lew, we’re having a party! What’re we serving, Lew?”"|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
02:30|"two thirty in the morning"|"Seven hours later, at two thirty in the morning, Lew and Jo walked toward the driveway, each carrying a Styrofoam cup of coffee steaming in the chill air: instant coffee because Jo had forgotten to prepare the percolator. She wore red plaid slacks, her Irish sweater and tasseled cap; Lew his usual dark blue nylon jacket, blue denims and sneakers, red cap. His other hand gripped the straps of a canvas shopping bag filled to the top with newspaper-wrapped packages which Jo had irritatingly refused to identify, the load heavy enough to pull his arm straight. At the driveway, seeing Harry and Shirley sitting out front on the curb, they turned down it."|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
"ap 02:45"|"two forty-five"|"“Anyone can dupe me at two forty-five on a raw, bitter morning. What are we doing out here? Jo,” he called to the women ahead, “this better be good.”"|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
02:55|"2:55 A.M."|"“It’s the way the world will end, Harry. Recorded cocktail music nuclear-powered to play on for centuries after all life has been destroyed. Selections from No, No, Nanette, throughout eternity. That do you for 2:55 A.M.?”"|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"Harry stood sipping thoughtfully, testing both the taste and the idea of champagne out here at three in the morning. Then he nodded abruptly, and drained his glass. Holding it out to Lew for more, he said, “First prize, Jo. Permanent possession of the silver trophy for leadership,” and Jo looked suddenly relieved and pleased. Lew filled Harry’s glass, he tasted it, nodded again, then glanced up and down the long length of the covered walkway stretching off into darkness at either end. “But . . . is this the idea for tonight, Jo? Drinking champagne at the shopping center?”"|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"“Well, we can’t go out again after tonight.” She smiled. “Be a long time before they forget four people dancing and drinking champagne at the shopping center. At three in the morning.”"|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
03:00|"3 A.M."|"“Why?” he insisted, wriggling forward to sit at the very edge of the chesterfield, glaring at the others. “If the cop is Short Pants we deny it was us; must have been four other people. He’ll know better, but let him try to prove it weeks later. And if it’s some other cop, we’re just out taking a walk; so what?”
“At like 3 A.M.?” said Shirley.
“Why the hell not if we feel like it! It’s what we’ve been doing, isn’t it? No law against it! Jesus Christ, we’ve gotten to believe the police are all-powerful!” He snatched the bottle from the table beside him, jumping up to refill their glasses. Then he strode over to the balcony doors, and closed them: “The cops aren’t coming, screw the cops.” He turned on the nearest lamp, yanked the drapes closed, then turned to grin at them, lifting the nearly emptied bottle to his mouth, and draining it. “Pah!”—he popped his lips in a long, satisfied exhalation, rubbing his stomach. “Stuff’s beginning to work its familiar magic once more. Right, Jo?”"|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
12:00|noon|"“It’ll be fun thinking about it tomorrow—today. After I’ve had some sleep. Till like noon. Lew, I hope the Walks don’t stop!”"|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"

In the early evening, Lew and Jo drove in to the Mill Valley library for a new supply of books; and each in his own apartment were reading in bed by eight-thirty, asleep before nine-thirty. At Lew’s office on Wednesday a typist unaccountably lost the last two pages of the memorandum she was typing for him; it had to be finished next morning, and Lew worked Wednesday evening at the office reconstructing them from his notes."|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"

As they ate, it grew dark, the street gradually taking on its night-time look, and when the street lights came on, Harry stared out over the railing, nodding, chewing. He’d been working on something, he said, for Monday’s Night People. But, smiling and shaking his head no, he wouldn’t say what. It was a good evening, and after eleven when the Levys left."|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
"ap > 10:00"|"a few minutes past ten"|"On Sunday evening, a few minutes past ten, Shirley phoned Jo. They’d just got home, she’d just walked in the door: Harry had asked her to phone while he emptied the car.

"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"“I was at the library again tonight,” Harry said. “And just before it closed at nine o’clock, I waited till the last of the kids got out of the reference section. Then I left one of these splendid posters behind. A duplicate of the one you’ve got there, but even more carefully lettered. I tucked it into one of the reference books left on the table.” Harry sat back, thumbs hooking into the band of his shorts, grinning around at the others. “I’d say that the odds that it won’t be found tomorrow are minuscule. It’s just about impossible, in fact, that one of the crowd of kids in that reference section tomorrow won’t open up that particular book. And discover an absolute sensation: Jolly Lew Joliffe, Mill Valley’s very own centerfold! Naturally he or she will show it around to absolutely every other kid in the library. And then—well, god knows where in Mill Valley they’ll stick it up, but you can bet your ass they will. Somewhere. Prominently. Maybe Xerox a batch of them on the library machine, and plaster them all over town.”"|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"

"ap 02:15"|"quarter after two"|"At a quarter after two, Harry driving slowly past the library from the north, they stared out at it as though they’d never before seen it—as they had not; not like this. In the front seat the Levys were dressed as they’d been earlier, except that Harry now wore his baseball cap; Lew wore his usual, the mask front of his cap rolled up; Jo a chocolate brown pants suit. In the darkness only the widely separated street lamps and the yellow parking lights of the slowly rolling Alfa showed. Beside the car just across the sidewalk, a ragged line of redwoods rose from a narrow strip of earth: behind the trees the long street facade of the library slid past. One by one the great floor-to-ceiling windows moved by, their panes shiny black, each reflecting light from the one dim street lamp ahead, and Lew thought he could sense the silent darkness on the other side of the wall. The busy, friendly, early-evening place this had always been for him had turned sinister now, drained of warmth and welcome; beside him Jo sat nibbling her lip."|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"“I know.” Harry said no more, head and shoulders ducked toward the windshield, a big hand gripping the wheel at eleven o’clock, other fist on the shift knob. He probably didn’t know it, Lew thought, looking at Harry’s profile, but Harry was smiling. Another long minute, possibly two, swinging left, then right, left, then right, the four of them leaning out on each curve, possibly helping to cut down the fishtailing. Then Harry moved closer to the windshield, ducking his head to watch for something on the left, never slowing. “Okay! Just ahead!” he said. “Hang on!”"|"Three by Finney"|"Jack Finney"

In the nearly empty living room, crawling on hands and knees, Jo and Shirley cut the sailcloth into fourteen fifty-foot lengths. Each took two of these strips and, sitting cross-legged on the floor, tailor fashion, began sewing them together in big, looping stitches along the sides. Beginning at ten-thirty they watched on the Levys’ portable television set the morning cartoons, as they worked, and then whatever else came on, discussing it.

The film continued till the car stopped at the back roof edge, then briefly returned to the faces of the watching crowd as it cheered mockingly.
