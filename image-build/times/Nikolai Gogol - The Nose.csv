"ap 08:00"|"eight o'clock"|"The worthy clerk listened with gravity, yet none the less
accomplished a calculation of the number of letters in the
advertisement brought. On either side there was a group of
charwomen, shop assistants, doorkeepers, and the like. All had
similar advertisements in their hands, with one of the documents to
notify that a coachman of good character was about to be
disengaged, and another one to advertise a koliaska imported from
Paris in 1814, and only slightly used since, and another one a
maid-servant of nineteen experienced in laundry work, but prepared
also for other jobs, and another one a sound drozhki save that a
spring was lacking, and another one a grey-dappled, spirited horse
of the age of seventeen, and another one some turnip and radish
seed just received from London, and another one a country house
with every amenity, stabling for two horses, and sufficient space
for the laying out of a fine birch or spruce plantation, and
another one some second-hand footwear, with, added, an invitation
to attend the daily auction sale from eight o'clock to three. The
room where the company thus stood gathered together was small, and
its atmosphere confined; but this closeness, of course, Collegiate
Assessor Kovalev never perceived, for, in addition to his face
being muffled in a handkerchief, his nose was gone, and God only
knew its present habitat!"|"The Nose"|"Nikolai Gogol"
01:00|"one: this very night"|"""Never mind,"" Kovalev replied. ""Stick it on again, pray. How can
I continue without a nose? Besides, things could not possibly be
worse than they are now. At present they are the devil himself.
Where can I show this caricature of a face? My circle of
acquaintances is a large one: this very night I am due in two
houses, for I know a great many people like Madame Chektareva (wife
of the State Councillor), Madame Podtochina (wife of the
Staff-Officer), and others. Of course, though, I shall have nothing
further to do with Madame Podtochina (except through the police)
after her present proceedings. Yes,"" persuasively he went on, ""I
beg of you to do me the favour requested. Surely there are means of
doing it permanently? Stick it on in any sort of a fashion—at all
events so that it will hold fast, even if not becomingly. And then,
when risky moments occur, I might even support it gently with my
hand, and likewise dance no more—anything to avoid fresh injury
through an unguarded movement. For the rest, you may feel assured
that I shall show you my gratitude for this visit so far as ever my
means will permit."""|"The Nose"|"Nikolai Gogol"
"ap 03:00"|"three o'clock"|"It had not been long before news of the strange occurrence had
spread through the capital. And, of course, it received additions
with the progress of time. Everyone's mind was, at that period,
bent upon the marvellous. Recently experiments with the action of
magnetism had occupied public attention, and the history of the
dancing chairs of Koniushennaia Street also was fresh. So no one
could wonder when it began to be said that the nose of Collegiate
Assessor Kovalev could be seen promenading the Nevski Prospekt at
three o'clock, or when a crowd of curious sightseers gathered
there. Next, someone declared that the nose, rather, could be
beheld at Junker's store, and the throng which surged thither
became so massed as to necessitate a summons to the police.
Meanwhile a speculator of highly respectable aspect and whiskers
who sold stale cakes at the entrance to a theatre knocked together
some stout wooden benches, and invited the curious to stand upon
them for eighty kopeks each; whilst a retired colonel who came out
early to see the show, and penetrated the crowd only with great
difficulty, was disgusted when in the window of the store he
beheld, not a nose, but merely an ordinary woollen waistcoat
flanked by the selfsame lithograph of a girl pulling up a stocking,
whilst a dandy with cutaway waistcoat and receding chin peeped at
her from behind a tree, which had hung there for ten years
past."|"The Nose"|"Nikolai Gogol"
