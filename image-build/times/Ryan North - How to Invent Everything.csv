If you’ve done this accurately, then the stick’s shadow at noon will always be directly underneath it, and 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. will always be at 90-degree angles to it on either side. To get the angles for the remaining hours, use the following formula, where l is your latitude and h is your hour:"|"How to Invent Everything"|"Ryan North"

12:00|midday|"Knowing humanity’s track record as you now do, you will not be surprised that it took more than a hundred years after thermoscopes were invented for anyone to think of applying a fixed scale to them. Two men (Isaac Newton and Ole Rømer) finally came up with this idea independently in 1701 CE, but Rømer’s scale was better: Newton used a lot of subjective temperature references (“the heat at midday about the month of July”: what the heck, Newton?) while Rømer at least used constants like the freezing and boiling points of water as the basis for his temperature scale.*"|"How to Invent Everything"|"Ryan North"
00:00|0|"Since the Earth rotates, it has a natural top, bottom, and middle.* We’ll call the line around the middle of the planet “the equator,” define that as 0 degrees, and label every other latitude line by whatever angle a line drawn from those latitudes to the center of the Earth makes with the equator. So latitude lines will start at 0 at the equator, and they’ll increase as you go north until they reach 90 degrees at the north pole, and decrease as you go south until they reach -90 degrees at the south pole."|"How to Invent Everything"|"Ryan North"
12:00|noon|"And yes, this thought you’re having is correct. While you might recall in your pre-time-travel life looking up to the sky at night and finding a north star (if you’re in the northern hemisphere) or a south star (if you’re in the southern), the position of these stars is not guaranteed, and without knowing precisely what time period you’re in, relying on them is impossible. However, there is one star visible from Earth that is always going to be where we want it no matter what time period you’re surviving in: our star, the sun. Measure the angle between you and the sun at noon—when it’s highest in the sky—and you’ll still be calculating latitude using the stars."|"How to Invent Everything"|"Ryan North"
12:00|noon|"Longitude is the measurement of how far east or west you are of your prime meridian. Since you already know the Earth rotates west to east a full 360 degrees each day (which you do, because we just told you), it’s clear that one degree of longitude corresponds to 1/360 of a day, or 4 minutes.* Your longitude is the difference between noon where you are and noon where your prime meridian is.* For example, if your noon happens 8 minutes before the noon at the prime meridian, you know you’re 2 degrees of longitude to the east of that line. Similarly, if your noon is 20 minutes after the prime meridian’s noon, your longitude is 5 degrees to the west. Longitude is trivial, assuming you believe that keeping track of what time it is at the prime meridian isn’t the sort of thing that will stymie humanity for thousands of years!"|"How to Invent Everything"|"Ryan North"
12:00|noon|"If you’re conveying information simply by the existence of a radio burst (for example, a transmission at noon for timekeeping; see Section 10.12.3), then you’re done, but if you add a switch so you can you turn it on and off in patterns, you can broadcast any information you want in Morse code.* This is the same technology used in the wired telegraph—which you can also invent now if you want, just by having your switch connect by wire to a distant buzzer, instead of to an electric arc radio transmitter. Wired telegraphy may be simpler for overland transmission, but you’ll want to use wireless for transoceanic transmissions, at least until you reach the point of laying cable at the bottom of the sea."|"How to Invent Everything"|"Ryan North"
"ap 00:50"|"10 to 1"|"If you’re on Earth and you’re seeing life beyond yourself, bacteria are absolutely unavoidable: they were among the first life to evolve. A gram of modern soil typically has around 40 million bacteria cells in it, and if that makes you feel uncomfortable, you’re not going to like this next phrase: bacteria cells outnumber human cells on (and in) your body 10 to 1.* Not all bacteria are bad, and you need some to survive: the bacteria in your gut not only make digestion of several foods possible (including plant matter) and help train your immune system, but many have specifically evolved to live inside humans. So in a way, you’re not actually trapped alone in the past: you and your gut flora are in this one together."|"How to Invent Everything"|"Ryan North"
"ap ~ 01:00"|"about 100"|"To perform CPR, you’ll want to put your patient on their back and regularly push down hard in the center of the patient’s chest, between the nipples, at about 100 compressions per minute. An easy way to hit that mark is to perform compressions in time to a song, usually but not necessarily sung inside your head. See the sidebar on this page for a list of popular songs drawn from the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries: a true golden age for CPR-friendly music."|"How to Invent Everything"|"Ryan North"
"ap 07:15"|7.15|"First, make a watertight tower about 25m tall: steel works well. At the bottom, you’ll heat limestone to produce quicklime and carbon dioxide (see C.3). Above it, you’ll have a concentrated liquid solution of ammonia and salt. As carbon dioxide bubbles through this solution, the ammonia turns into ammonium chloride (NH4Cl, a substance we weren’t trying to make, but hold on to it) and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3, also known as “baking soda”) falls out of your solution, collecting at the bottom. You can harvest it and use it now, but if you heat it, it decomposes into sodium carbonate (which is what we’re looking for) along with water and carbon dioxide. You’re left with ammonium chloride, which—if you don’t want to produce morphine (see Section 7.15)—you can add slaked lime to: this produces pure ammonia, pure water, and some calcium chloride (CaCl2). The nice thing about this process is you get your ammonia back at the end of it, so it’s pretty economical to run!"|"How to Invent Everything"|"Ryan North"
