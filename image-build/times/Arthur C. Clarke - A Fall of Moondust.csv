19:35|"19 hours 35 minutes"|"Those instruments had just produced some rather interesting results. At 19 hours 35 minutes 47 seconds GMT, there had been a major quake in the general area of Rainbow Bay. That was a little surprising, for the area was an unusually stable one, even for the tranquil Moon. Father Ferraro set his computers to work pinpointing the focus of the disturbance, and also instructed them to search for any other anomalous instrument readings. He left them at this task while he went to lunch, and it was here that his colleagues told him about the missing Selene."|"A Fall of Moondust"|"Arthur C. Clarke"
19:35|"nineteen thirty-five"|"“Hello, Duster Two. Lawrence here. Plato Observatory’s just reported a quake near the Mountains of Inaccessibility. It took place at nineteen thirty-five, which is near enough the time when Selene should have been in Crater Lake. They suggest she’s been caught in an avalanche somewhere in that area. So head for the mountains and see if you can spot any recent slides or rockfalls.”"|"A Fall of Moondust"|"Arthur C. Clarke"
"ap 00:50"|"Ten to one"|"“The sun’s rising over the Sea about now. Base will have the dust-skis out looking for us, and they must know our approximate position. Ten to one they’ll find us in a few hours.”"|"A Fall of Moondust"|"Arthur C. Clarke"
12:00|noon|"Tom adjusted the instrument for maximum sensitivity, and searched the area where the trail had ended. Perhaps there was some lingering trace that could be picked up even now, some faint smudge of heat that still persisted, strong enough to be detected even in the warmth of the lunar morning. For the sun was still low, and its rays had not yet attained the murderous power they would possess at noon."|"A Fall of Moondust"|"Arthur C. Clarke"
12:00|noon|"But now he could see that they were making progress, and that their long, black shadow was not frozen to the ground, as it sometimes seemed. He focused the detector on the rising peaks, and obtained a strong reaction. As he had expected, the exposed rocks were almost at boiling point where they faced the sun. Though the lunar day had barely started, the Mountains were already burning. It was much cooler down here at “Sea” level. The surface dust would not reach its maximum temperature until noon, still seven days away. That was one of the biggest points in his favor; though the day had already begun, he still had a sporting chance of detecting any faint source of heat before the full fury of the day had overwhelmed it."|"A Fall of Moondust"|"Arthur C. Clarke"
"ap 06:00"|six|"“Traditions of the service,” replied Anson. “Of course, the ship’s flight recorders are running all the time we’re under power, and the trip can always be reconstructed from them. But only the skipper’s log gives the little details that make one voyage different from another—like ‘Twins born to one of the steerage passengers this morning’ or ‘At six bells, sighted the White Whale off the starboard bow.’”"|"A Fall of Moondust"|"Arthur C. Clarke"
"ap 06:15"|"six fifteen"|"“Supernova rating. And there’s a new angle-every crackpot inventor who ever tried to patent a new paper clip is crawling out of the woodwork with ideas. We’re rounding up a batch of them at six fifteen. It should be good fun.”"|"A Fall of Moondust"|"Arthur C. Clarke"
12:00|noon|"I seem to have been here for half a lifetime, thought Maurice Spenser, yet the sun is still low in the west, where it rises on this weird world, and it’s still three days to noon. How much longer am I going to be stuck on this mountaintop, listening to Captain Anson’s tall stories of the spaceways, and watching that distant raft, with its twin igloos?"|"A Fall of Moondust"|"Arthur C. Clarke"
