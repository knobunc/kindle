Nineteen minutes later, she flipped end for end, accelerating away from them until their overtake speed had dropped once more to thirty thousand KPS at a range of just under a hundred and fifty-eight million kilometers, and Lieutenant Commander MacAllister's face tightened as Hotspur's sensors penetrated their ECM at last.""Get another message off to the Old Lady, Ruth,"" he said very quietly. ""Tell her we have six Peep heavy cruisers - they look like Scimitars. I estimate they'll enter range of the convoy in - "" he glanced back down at his plot "" - two hours and thirty-six minutes."""|"The Short Victorious War"|"David Weber"
"ap 02:14"|"two hours and fourteen minutes"|"""General message to all units, Com."" Her voice sounded rusty and strained in her own ears. ""Message begins: From CO escort to all ships. We have detected six warships, apparently Havenite heavy cruisers, closing from astern. Present range one-three-point-six light-minutes, closing velocity three-zero thousand KPS. On present course, they will overtake us in two hours and fourteen minutes."" She drew a deep breath, staring down into her display. ""In view of Admiralty warnings, I must assume their intention is to attack. All escorts will form on me and turn to engage the enemy. The convoy will scatter and proceed independently.

"ap 10:40"|"ten hours and forty minutes"|"""Commander Oselli's working it up now, Sir. It looks like they're heading to intercept the repair base."" Someone said something behind Chandler, and she nodded. ""Confirmed, Sir. Assuming they hold their present acceleration and heading with turnover for the lead element in about five and a half hours, the DNs and BCs will be just about at rest relative to the base at range zero in ten hours and forty minutes."""|"The Short Victorious War"|"David Weber"
"ap 01:05"|one-four-one|"""It'll be a little tighter than optimum, Sir,"" Honor's astrogator said, ""but we can make it. If we get underway within ten minutes, we can match courses at one-four-one-zero-eight KPS in three hours and five-two minutes. They'll be approximately three-five minutes past turnover at a velocity of three-four-two-seven-eight KPS."""|"The Short Victorious War"|"David Weber"

""The fact is, Lucien Cortez is staying on as Fifth Space Lord, but Caparelli's going to want to put his own personnel policies in place, and I'm here to get your input before I sign a few midnight command assignments."" He waved a hand at White Haven's raised eyebrow. ""Oh, it's his prerogative to make his own personnel decisions. I certainly wanted the same thing when I took over. But he's going to be feeling his way into things for a couple of months. Given the current situation in the PRH, I want him to have a solid team in the field during the transition."""|"The Short Victorious War"|"David Weber"
"ap 00:00"|twelve|"""Tomorrow at twelve hundred would be good."" He sounded relieved by the change of subject.
