"ap ~ 09:00"|"about nine"|"They all turned to look at Percy. “Very well,” the redhead said reluctantly. Then he added, “I suggest we catch the morning current. The Gibraltar Loop should be over London at about nine.”"|Prudence|"Gail Carriger"
08:00|"eight in the morning"|"Rue and Prim looked at him, askance. Neither of them had ever been up before eight in the morning, except on those few occasions when they were viewing that untenable hour from the other side. Being raised by vampires and werewolves made one quite nocturnal."|Prudence|"Gail Carriger"
"~ 00:00"|"around midnight"|"Rue was at dinner in the stateroom at around midnight when Primrose returned to the ship. Footnote had found his way over from the library and graced her lap with a purr. This was most likely due to the delicious smells coming from her plate but Rue was disposed to be honoured by his presence. She had thought to return home to Dama’s that night but with so much to do, and a cat in her lap, it seemed easier to stay aboard and test out the facilities in a dry run. Kill two pigeons with one stone, as it were."|Prudence|"Gail Carriger"
09:08|"Eight minutes past nine in the morning"|"Percy scattered his notes every which way, looking for the earlier schedule. “Eight minutes past nine in the morning.”"|Prudence|"Gail Carriger"
"ap 04:26"|"Four hours, twenty-six minutes"|"Percy instantly sobered. As dangerous as the first hop could be, it was hopping between charted currents that took real skill. He took out his pocket watch and snapped it open. “Four hours, twenty-six minutes.”"|Prudence|"Gail Carriger"
"ap 00:30"|"half of one"|"Or what looked like a lamp-post, except that it was only the top half of one and Rue knew that it only seemed small because they were still far away. In actual fact, the beacon was very large indeed. It was birdcage in shape and lit from within by a miasmic orange gas."|Prudence|"Gail Carriger"
03:15|"quarter past three in the morning"|"It was quarter past three in the morning. Most aristo functions ended around four to give everyone time to get home and into their dark chambers before the sun rose, so that gave me forty-five minutes. Luckily, my destination was less than a mile away."|Prudence|"Gail Carriger"
