was simply this. After I left you yesterday evening, Harry, I
dressed, had some dinner at that little Italian restaurant in
Rupert Street you introduced me to, and went down at eight
o'clock to the theatre. Sibyl was playing Rosalind. Of course,
the scenery was dreadful and the Orlando absurd. But Sibyl! You
should have seen her! When she came on in her boy's clothes,
she was perfectly wonderful. She wore a moss-coloured velvet jerkin
with cinnamon sleeves, slim, brown, cross-gartered hose, a dainty
little green cap with a hawk's feather caught in a jewel, and a
hooded cloak lined with dull red. She had never seemed to me more
exquisite. She had all the delicate grace of that Tanagra figurine
that you have in your studio, Basil. Her hair clustered round her
face like dark leaves round a pale rose. As for her acting—well,
you shall see her to-night. She is simply a born artist. I sat in
the dingy box absolutely enthralled. I forgot that I was in London
and in the nineteenth century. I was away with my love in a forest
that no man had ever seen. After the performance was over, I went
behind and spoke to her. As we were sitting together, suddenly
there came into her eyes a look that I had never seen there before.
My lips moved towards hers. We kissed each other. I can't
describe to you what I felt at that moment. It seemed to me that
all my life had been narrowed to one perfect point of rose-coloured
joy. She trembled all over and shook like a white narcissus. Then
she flung herself on her knees and kissed my hands. I feel that I
should not tell you all this, but I can't help it. Of course,
our engagement is a dead secret. She has not even told her own
mother. I don't know what my guardians will say. Lord Radley is
sure to be furious. I don't care. I shall be of age in less
than a year, and then I can do what I like. I have been right,
Basil, haven't I, to take my love out of poetry and to find my
wife in Shakespeare's plays? Lips that Shakespeare taught to
speak have whispered their secret in my ear. I have had the arms of
Rosalind around me, and kissed Juliet on the mouth."""|"The Picture of Dorian Gray"|"Oscar Wilde"

Garden. The darkness lifted, and, flushed with faint fires, the sky
hollowed itself into a perfect pearl. Huge carts filled with
nodding lilies rumbled slowly down the polished empty street. The
air was heavy with the perfume of the flowers, and their beauty
seemed to bring him an anodyne for his pain. He followed into the
market and watched the men unloading their waggons. A white-smocked
carter offered him some cherries. He thanked him, wondered why he
refused to accept any money for them, and began to eat them
listlessly. They had been plucked at midnight, and the coldness of
the moon had entered into them. A long line of boys carrying crates
of striped tulips, and of yellow and red roses, defiled in front of
him, threading their way through the huge, jade-green piles of
vegetables. Under the portico, with its grey, sun-bleached pillars,
loitered a troop of draggled bareheaded girls, waiting for the
auction to be over. Others crowded round the swinging doors of the
coffee-house in the piazza. The heavy cart-horses slipped and
stamped upon the rough stones, shaking their bells and trappings.
Some of the drivers were lying asleep on a pile of sacks.

over his letters. One of them was from Lord Henry, and had been
brought by hand that morning. He hesitated for a moment, and then
put it aside. The others he opened listlessly. They contained the
usual collection of cards, invitations to dinner, tickets for
private views, programmes of charity concerts, and the like that
are showered on fashionable young men every morning during the
season. There was a rather heavy bill for a chased silver
Louis-Quinze toilet-set that he had not yet had the courage to send
on to his guardians, who were extremely old-fashioned people and
did not realize that we live in an age when unnecessary things are
our only necessities; and there were several very courteously

advance any sum of money at a moment's notice and at the most
reasonable rates of interest."|"The Picture of Dorian Gray"|"Oscar Wilde"

up the scarlet threads of life and to weave them into a pattern; to
find his way through the sanguine labyrinth of passion through
which he was wandering. He did not know what to do, or what to
think. Finally, he went over to the table and wrote a passionate
letter to the girl he had loved, imploring her forgiveness and
accusing himself of madness. He covered page after page with wild
words of sorrow and wilder words of pain. There is a luxury in
self-reproach. When we blame ourselves, we feel that no one else
has a right to blame us. It is the confession, not the priest, that
gives us absolution. When Dorian had finished the letter, he felt
that he had been forgiven."|"The Picture of Dorian Gray"|"Oscar Wilde"

time for her, but she did not come down again. They ultimately
found her lying dead on the floor of her dressing-room. She had
swallowed something by mistake, some dreadful thing they use at
theatres. I don't know what it was, but it had either prussic
acid or white lead in it. I should fancy it was prussic acid, as
she seems to have died instantaneously."""|"The Picture of Dorian Gray"|"Oscar Wilde"
"ap ~ 05:30"|"about half-past five"|"""No,"" said Dorian Gray, ""there is nothing fearful
about it. It is one of the great romantic tragedies of the age. As
a rule, people who act lead the most commonplace lives. They are
good husbands, or faithful wives, or something tedious. You know
what I mean—middle-class virtue and all that kind of thing. How
different Sibyl was! She lived her finest tragedy. She was always a
heroine. The last night she played— the night you saw her—she acted
badly because she had known the reality of love. When she knew its
unreality, she died, as Juliet might have died. She passed again
into the sphere of art. There is something of the martyr about her.
Her death has all the pathetic uselessness of martyrdom, all its
wasted beauty. But, as I was saying, you must not think I have not
suffered. If you had come in yesterday at a particular moment—
about half-past five, perhaps, or a quarter to six— you would have
found me in tears. Even Harry, who was here, who brought me the
news, in fact, had no idea what I was going through. I suffered
immensely. Then it passed away. I cannot repeat an emotion. No one
can, except sentimentalists. And you are awfully unjust, Basil. You
come down here to console me. That is charming of you. You find me
consoled, and you are furious. How like a sympathetic person! You
remind me of a story Harry told me about a certain philanthropist
who spent twenty years of his life in trying to get some grievance
redressed, or some unjust law altered—I forget exactly what it was.
Finally he succeeded, and nothing could exceed his disappointment.
He had absolutely nothing to do, almost died of ennui, and became a
confirmed misanthrope. And besides, my dear old Basil, if you
really want to console me, teach me rather to forget what has
happened, or to see it from a proper artistic point of view. Was it
not Gautier who used to write about la consolation des arts? I
remember picking up a little vellum-covered book in your studio one
day and chancing on that delightful phrase. Well, I am not like
that young man you told me of when we were down at Marlow together,
the young man who used to say that yellow satin could console one
for all the miseries of life. I love beautiful things that one can
touch and handle. Old brocades, green bronzes, lacquer-work, carved
ivories, exquisite surroundings, luxury, pomp—there is much to be
got from all these. But the artistic temperament that they create,
or at any rate reveal, is still more to me. To become the spectator
of one's own life, as Harry says, is to escape the suffering of
life. I know you are surprised at my talking to you like this. You
have not realized how I have developed. I was a schoolboy when you
knew me. I am a man now. I have new passions, new thoughts, new
ideas. I am different, but you must not like me less. I am changed,
but you must always be my friend. Of course, I am very fond of
Harry. But I know that you are better than he is. You are not
stronger— you are too much afraid of life—but you are better. And
how happy we used to be together! Don't leave me, Basil, and
don't quarrel with me. I am what I am. There is nothing more to
be said."""|"The Picture of Dorian Gray"|"Oscar Wilde"

20:15|"eight-fifteen that evening"|"He felt that the man must be got rid of at once. He must not be
allowed to know where the picture was being taken to. There was
something sly about him, and he had thoughtful, treacherous eyes.
Sitting down at the writing-table he scribbled a note to Lord
Henry, asking him to send him round something to read and reminding
him that they were to meet at eight-fifteen that evening."|"The Picture of Dorian Gray"|"Oscar Wilde"
"ap > 05:00"|"just after five
o'clock"|"On reaching the library, he found that it was just after five
o'clock and that the tea had been already brought up. On a
little table of dark perfumed wood thickly incrusted with nacre, a
present from Lady Radley, his guardian's wife, a pretty
professional invalid who had spent the preceding winter in Cairo,
was lying a note from Lord Henry, and beside it was a book bound in
yellow paper, the cover slightly torn and the edges soiled. A copy
of the third edition of The St. James's Gazette had been placed
on the tea-tray. It was evident that Victor had returned. He
wondered if he had met the men in the hall as they were leaving the
house and had wormed out of them what they had been doing. He would
be sure to miss the picture—had no doubt missed it already, while
he had been laying the tea-things. The screen had not been set
back, and a blank space was visible on the wall. Perhaps some night
he might find him creeping upstairs and trying to force the door of
the room. It was a horrible thing to have a spy in one's house.
He had heard of rich men who had been blackmailed all their lives
by some servant who had read a letter, or overheard a conversation,
or picked up a card with an address, or found beneath a pillow a
withered flower or a shred of crumpled lace."|"The Picture of Dorian Gray"|"Oscar Wilde"
"ap 08:15"|eight-fifteen|"He sighed, and having poured himself out some tea, opened Lord
Henry's note. It was simply to say that he sent him round the
evening paper, and a book that might interest him, and that he
would be at the club at eight-fifteen. He opened The St.
James's languidly, and looked through it. A red pencil-mark on
the fifth page caught his eye. It drew attention to the following
paragraph:"|"The Picture of Dorian Gray"|"Oscar Wilde"
"ap < 09:00"|"almost nine o'clock"|"It was almost nine o'clock before he reached the club, where
he found Lord Henry sitting alone, in the morning-room, looking
very much bored."|"The Picture of Dorian Gray"|"Oscar Wilde"
