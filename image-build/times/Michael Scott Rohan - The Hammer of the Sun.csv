12:00|noontide|"He blinked in astonishment, and with a wicked glitter in her eyes she added ""Never thought to hear that, did you? But I only said might, mind! Well, the sun's all but up; I'll have the silver sent over to the Hall of Guild in the noontide, and my lads when they've rested. Right now I want some breakfast! So we'll go pay our respects at the palace, though it's plain enough eating there, in all conscience."" A note of amused affection crept into her voice. ""How fares the long lad, by the bye?"""|"The Hammer of the Sun"|"Michael Scott Rohan"
12:00|noontide|"In the few days of peace that followed Elof steered to the southeast as far as he dared, to avoid more ice. The sailing was all too easy, bearing away effortlessly before that southward wind when it blew, or running comfortably on the weaker westerlies; in these latitudes the air was milder, and while there was some heavy weather even the water that came roaring over the bows seemed warmer, or at least less chill. Roc revelled in the change, but Elof distrusted it, fearful of straying into the sudden calms for which southern waters were notor-ious. He kept careful watch on their position and progress; and thus it was that they were not taken by surprise. For it was as he attempted to trace the sun one overcast noontide, by a subtle instrument with thin sheets of spar crystal, that he noticed the dark speck cresting the southward horizon; against that sullen sky, shaded in charcoal and lead, they might otherwise have quite missed their peril till it was too late. But now it was his turn to hail, and Roc's to come running in disbelief. When he saw, though, he whistled, long and low. ""Well! A sail it surely is this time, and a big 'un! Now what…"" He stopped then, and swallowed audibly."|"The Hammer of the Sun"|"Michael Scott Rohan"
12:00|midday|"No account remains of the passage of Elof and Roc southward through the hills and the forests. It must have taken some few days at least, since so many heights and valleys lay in their way, but it seems to have been uneventful; the land was empty, is all that is said, and game was scarce. What this meant to them can be guessed, for they had only the little food the duergar gave them, and no easy means of hunting save Roc's bow and few remaining arrows; and the effort of healing was draining Elof's body. On the other hand, they walked free and alive when all too often they had stood in deadly peril, and they had both strong spirits to sustain their flagging frames. It must have been warm summer in those forests, the air tangy with resin, and flowers glowing among the pine-needles on their floor. They were still afoot and in no bad heart when they reached the wood's edge, and came out among a few scattered trees onto a bare and stony upland slope, leading to what seemed a hill-crest. It was a warm midday, and beyond the crest only clouds glided by; there were no more treetops, and as they looked to either side it seemed that there also the wood was thinning and diminishing. With growing excitement to steady their shaky limbs, they clambered up the slope. ""Let's… hope the downslope's… easier,"" wheezed Roc, face purple and glistening as a berry. But as they drew nearer the top, they realised that there was no downslope; they were at the top of a cliff. And it was no mere hillside crag, such as they had come upon out of the Meneth Aithen, but part of a long irregular wall of golden stone; as far as they could see from east to west the forest grew down almost to its edge. Then they came cautiously to the cliff-edge, keeping low lest some unfriendly eye catch them against the skyline. But when they reached it and looked out, they forgot all that in wonder at what they saw. For to their right, westward, they first made out another such line of cliffs, and thought themselves overlooking some deep valley. But as they rose higher, and looked out east, they saw that line of cliffs turn away from them and plunge deep into cloud-shadowed distance, till they became no more than a dark streak upon the horizon and merged with it. And below them all the broad lands between lay spread out clear, as on some vast map, some boundless living tapestry. For if this was indeed a vale, then it was the greatest in the world."|"The Hammer of the Sun"|"Michael Scott Rohan"
01:00|"1 am"|"/ have not come anywhere. 1 am here, as I am where stands even the smallest sapling of a tree. And I do not seek to mock you, or enchain your heart as before. As the world is now we have common cause; and I speak only to bring warning."|"The Hammer of the Sun"|"Michael Scott Rohan"
12:00|midday|"""No!"" muttered Elof, still burnishing at the gold, though it shone bright as it ever had in the midday sunlight. ""But I may yet make myself worse. Enough! High time you were on your way; the guard-boat is waiting! And take care!"""|"The Hammer of the Sun"|"Michael Scott Rohan"
"~ 12:00"|"about midday"|"Yet for all his absorbtion, in some remote corner of his thoughts he could not help imagining the train of events he had set in motion, so minutely that he seemed actually to be seeing them all, building up like strange simultaneous layers of motion. He saw Roc's little boat glide across the dark Yskianas to shore, beaching clumsily, no doubt, but safe; Roc leaving that casket with some of the gate guards he knew, repeating the instructions on its lid that it was for Nithaid's eyes alone, and then melting away into the end of the dark. Taking to the boat again, though not for long; Roc would sooner make his way ashore. Roc on his way, the casket borne by mounted courier through the sleeping streets of that immense city to the walls of the Strength of Kerys, and within, to await the coming of the king. He saw the sun arise over the Horns of the Bull more clearly than through his own shutters, his own eyes blind to all except the piecing together of things delicate into a binding whole. But then it grew less certain; Nithaid might return by water, sailing leisurely up the channels, or by land, to ride in triumph through the streets and enjoy the acclamation of his people. That was more likely, now that be brought peace to offer them, and the appearance, at least, of victory. He would come by the westward gates, then, and reach the palace sooner; about midday, perhaps. He would find troubled faces awaiting him; the princes would have been missed by then. Perhaps Beathaill would tell then, something at least. They would bring Nithaid the casket…"|"The Hammer of the Sun"|"Michael Scott Rohan"
12:00|"noon that day"|"He slept that night beneath the trees of an outlying orchard, overgrown and neglected this season; it yielded him some food, and its fallen boughs a sweet-scented fuel for his ascent next morning. By noon that day, less than two days after the fall of the forge, he reckoned he had come the distance it had taken Trygkar's cog well-nigh seven days to sail. Prompted by that thought, he looked up and down the Great River, but there were few ships of any size abroad. He saw the distant wings then, a pair of flyers as fast as himself, and curiously he swung towards them; but they scattered in panic, as what birds might not before something as huge as he? Ever westward as he flew he saw more signs of war, at first those that the greater towns were inflicting upon themselves in their frantic haste to build new fortifications on his pattern; many an ancient building was torn down for the materials, and the lands about gouged up with trench and dyke. But soon he came upon sharper devastations, wide slashes brown and black across the green earth below where holt and hamlet had been overrun and fired, walls tumbled or whitened with flame, fields trampled to muck, pastures empty of beast and herdsman. A wide ring of such ruin marked out many of the greater towns from afar."|"The Hammer of the Sun"|"Michael Scott Rohan"
12:00|noonday|"Three days later, when Kermorvan's force came trotting out of the hills above the march, it became clear that Elof s surmise had been right. The army was at its noonday rest, straggling out across the land like a ragged scar, stretching far into the distance; only here and there was there any trace of order. Yet when the first sounds of hooves reached the flanking columns, they saw sentinels enough spring to their feet, and if the weapons in their hands glinted dully, still they were held steady, and no man turned. Horns sounded, and the whole long line erupted; the country seethed like an ant's nest. Kermorvan exclaimed in astonishment as he saw it. ""There must be tens of thousands here!"""|"The Hammer of the Sun"|"Michael Scott Rohan"
12:00|midday|"In this Kermorvan proved himself a true prophet. There are many accounts in the Chronicles of that last and greatest of battles in the defence of Kerys, and they differ over many points; for so vast a conflict can seldom look alike to any one pair of eyes, and to each man his own standpoint must often have seemed the most hard-pressed and perilous. Yet all agree that between midday and evening four more such great onslaughts were unleashed against the combined ranks of Kerys and Morvanhal, and smaller assaults unnumbered, and that many broke through even to the king's rock. But though they differ as to how, they agree that the ranks, though sadly diminished and frequently broken, never panicked nor sought to run, and that all these assaults were turned, though at great cost; all, save the very last."|"The Hammer of the Sun"|"Michael Scott Rohan"
12:00|noon|"Roc nodded curtly, and turning to Elof s mount he handed him down the great shield slung from its saddlebow; the grips had already been reversed. Elof tore the cover from it, revealing a surface still mirror-bright after its long voyage; that was a work of virtues also, and of subtle alloys. ""This is one of the master-shields,"" he said quietly. ""There are others, here and there among the host; but they will command only if this and others of greater precedence are turned from the sun. We tested this weapon when we had only a few shields; where the master-shield's light falls, all follow. One or two, even ten, do little. But thirty under a clear noon sun could fire a tree, given time - or a hundred, a man. And though some, and their wielders, are lost to us, we have - what would you say? - some eight thousand still."" He held the shield to his lips, and they heard him murmur a few words in a tongue of old; only his friends knew their origins."|"The Hammer of the Sun"|"Michael Scott Rohan"
00:00|midnight|"Kermorvan jerked upright. An awful chill had lanced through him at the very sound of that voice, and he knew at once whose it was. The huge figure that stooped beside him had not been there only a moment since; and though from the huge rough-shafted spear the man leaned upon he had the look of a warrior, no one in all the army wore such a long and dusty mantle of midnight blue, nor such a wide-brimmed hat. But even had Kermorvan been a man of less swift thought, that chill would have warned him."|"The Hammer of the Sun"|"Michael Scott Rohan"
12:00|noon|"The mirror-shields seem to have been no more than some light and hard alloy, perhaps upon a bracing frame of wood or metal tube. Their chiefest subtlety lay in their shape which caught and concentrated the sun so well, and in the truly mysterious influence that held them in such unison both as shieldwall and as solar mirror. Such tight coordination and focussing is the problem which bedevils modern solar furnaces; they are capable of astonishing temperatures, such is the power the sun sheds upon us, but are very clumsy at concentrating it. Nevertheless there is evidence that some part of this problem was solved in ancient times. The Greek philosopher Archimedes, among the defences he created for his home city of Syracuse, is said to have fired enemy ships by just such a burning-glass, a feat historians have long sneered at because of the problems such mirrors involve. But recently a more practical archaeologist realised that he might have used the long Greek shields, highly polished, and tried an experiment with some twenty modern replicas of these, representing quite a good-sized area of reflector. Under the noon sun their combined beams were well able to set afire the timbers of a boat moored in the harbour. Elof s shields represented a surface thousands of times greater, and much more carefully and uniformly shaped. In such greater numbers and more skilfully shaped, and with their beams concentrated by the mastershields into near-perfect intensity, they must have achieved astonishing temperatures. It is ironic that the Ice's ultim-ate plan was to raise the world's albedo and so reflect away the life-giving solar energy; for Elof simply reflected it back at them."|"The Hammer of the Sun"|"Michael Scott Rohan"
