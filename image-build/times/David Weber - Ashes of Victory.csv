"ap 03:57"|"three of four"|"“But in a way,” Saint-Just continued, “that actually works to our advantage, because when you come right down to it, the only way our morale could go was up. The Manty public, on the other hand, started the war terrified of how it might end, only to have its confidence shoot up like a counter-grav shuttle. As far as their man-in-the-street could see, they beat the snot out of us for three of four T-years without even working up a good sweat, and there didn’t seem to be very much we could do to stop them."|"Ashes of Victory"|"David Weber"
"ap < 00:58"|"almost two to one"|"“Please be seated,” he invited, with much more congeniality than he showed most people who visited him in the middle of the night. Of course, most people hadn’t managed to pump nine million traceless austens into the Opposition’s war chest. He had to be careful how he spread those funds around lest too much money in any one spot get questions asked, but it freed up his legitimate contributions enormously. It was too early yet to predict the full impact of the media blitz he and his fellows were planning, but so far their closely coordinating candidates were on a pace to outspend their less organized opponents by a margin of almost two to one."|"Ashes of Victory"|"David Weber"
"ap < 00:57"|"almost three to one"|"“Um.” Citizen Vice Admiral Groenewold plucked at his lower lip. Allowing for the apparent efficiency of the Manties’ new inertial compensators, that was about right for an SD with pods deployed outside her wedge. So if the Manties were dropping their accel now, that would indicate they were, indeed, deploying their pods. But it also meant none of their light units had full pod loads. They couldn’t have, because, unlike superdreadnoughts, they lacked the tractor capacity and room to tow full loads inside their wedges, which meant they couldn’t have stayed with the ships of the wall on the approach run. And since Tactical reported that his ships of the wall outnumbered the Manties by almost three to one and his screening elements were towing full pod loads, it looked like things were about to get messy for the Manty CO."|"Ashes of Victory"|"David Weber"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"“No reason you shouldn’t, as long as you don’t get carried away,” Hughes assured him. “And now I really should be on my way. Brother Tobin may’ve said `any time,’ but I doubt he’ll really be pleased to see me if I get there after midnight!”"|"Ashes of Victory"|"David Weber"
"ap 05:38"|"Five hours and thirty-eight minutes"|"Citizen Admiral Dimitri accepted another cup of coffee from a signals yeoman. It was good coffee, brewed just the way he liked it, and it tasted like corrosion-strength industrial cleaner. Not too surprisingly, he supposed. Five hours and thirty-eight minutes had passed since the Manties’ translation, and the bastards had come the next best thing to four hundred and sixty million kilometers in that time. They were down to just a hair over fifteen million klicks from Enki, decelerating now, and their velocity was back down to a little over ninety-three hundred KPS."|"Ashes of Victory"|"David Weber"
12:00|noon|"“This interview is over,” Elizabeth said, and stood, shaking with fury, too angry even to notice the incredulity in her guests eyes as she violated all the solemn protocol of the occasion. “I can’t keep you from forming a government. Send me your list of ministers. I want it by noon tomorrow. I will act upon it immediately. But—;” her eyes stabbed each of them in turn “—;remember this day. You’re right, My Lord. I’m not a dictator, and I refuse to act like one simply because of your own stupidity and arrogance. But I need not be a `dictator’ to deal with the likes of you, either, and the time will come when you—;when all of you—;will rue this day!”"|"Ashes of Victory"|"David Weber"
"ap > 03:00"|"just after 03:00"|"He looked at the bedside chrono and winced. Benjamin the Great ran on standard twenty-four-hour days rather than the twenty-two-plus-hour days of Manticore, and it was just after 03:00. He’d been in bed barely three hours, and he was due to attend the final admirals’ briefing before kicking off against Lovat in only five more hours."|"Ashes of Victory"|"David Weber"
