"~ 05:00"|"around 5 A.M."|"We were dug in among the trees of a hilltop wood, my platoon and that of my friend Charlie. Charlie was sent off on a patrol, leaving me supposedly looking after both platoons. At around 5 A.M. the Germans suddenly put down a heavy barrage on us, so that there seemed to be shells bursting everywhere around us as we huddled in our slit trenches. Suddenly the stonk was over and in came the German attack, mounted, I learned much later, by men of the Storm Battalion of the Hermann Goering Division, very violent men armed with small rocket guns and a flamethrower."|"Chewing the Cud"|"Dick King-Smith"

On arrival she was greeted by the three dogs, Anna, Jonah, and Susie. She drew up her skirts in distaste. “We shall want them shut away,” said the midwife, and on entering the bedroom, “We shall need newspapers, plenty of newspapers. And boiling water.”"|"Chewing the Cud"|"Dick King-Smith"

00:00|Midnight|"Reach Midnight, notorious kicker, normally needs her hocks tied with rope. Can't be bothered, get my shoulder well under her, and lean in hard, hoping for best. Worst happens. With one tremendous wallop she comprehensively strips the machine bucket — air line, milk pipe, pulsator, teat cups — flying in all directions while I finish on my backside in urine-filled dung channel."|"Chewing the Cud"|"Dick King-Smith"
00:00|Midnight|"For three days and nights she lay there, covered in sacking to keep her warm, turned from one side to the other with ropes and enormous effort, emitting rivers of dung rich enough to grow Jack's beanstalk. A lesser beast would have died, but not Polly. The vet and Gladwyn and I may have contributed something to her recovery, but what got her to her feet again was undoubtedly the thought of the next square meal.
Finally, for sheer meanness, you could rely on Midnight.
Of all the many purchases I made, Midnight's was the most impulsive. A local farmer was selling up, it was a lovely day, there was nothing that absolutely had to be done for an hour or so."|"Chewing the Cud"|"Dick King-Smith"

00:00|midnight|"The cow (it was almost a shock to see the evidence of its sex) stood there, the blackest cow you ever did see, coal black, raven black, black as midnight, and I suddenly said to Gladwyn, “What d'you think of that one?”"|"Chewing the Cud"|"Dick King-Smith"
00:00|Midnight|"The hauler brought Midnight in time for the afternoon milking, and what a milking that was. At the first touch of the first cup on the first teat, she put on a performance that relegated Kicker to the fourth division. It wasn't just the kicking, explosively violent, a burst of heavy machine-gun fire instead of Kicker's little pistol shots, a fusillade that stripped the machinery into its component parts and left Gladwyn and me battered and bruised and breathless. It was the sheer ferocity that accompanied the act as she leaped and pranced and bucketed, blaring and bawling at us with wide-open mouth, not in pain or fear but in red-hot anger. Her fierce eyes blazed, and only the neck chain restrained her from her obvious wish to disembowel the pair of us with those twin daggers."|"Chewing the Cud"|"Dick King-Smith"
00:00|Midnight|"Any theory I might have had that Midnight's black satanic anger was directed solely against the milking machine was dispelled a week later. It was Gladwyn's day off, and Myrle had walked out with me when I went to fetch the cows in. She stopped to pick some wildflowers from a bank, and I went over the hill."|"Chewing the Cud"|"Dick King-Smith"
00:00|Midnight|"When next I saw Myrle, she was on the other side of a fence, rather white about the face and very angry.
“That bloody Midnight!”
“Why, what happened?”"|"Chewing the Cud"|"Dick King-Smith"
00:00|Midnight|"They all did, in the end of course, one way or another, Midnight and Polly and Thompson and Kicker and Cissie and Buttercup the boss and all the rest of them. A dairy cow's life is not often as long as it might be. The vet, the butcher, the slaughterman, they're all waiting, and seldom does anyone die in her bed. But the look of each and every one of them is clear in my mind."|"Chewing the Cud"|"Dick King-Smith"

She loved the camera, she loved the crew, she knew exactly when they usually came to the cottage (9 A.M. on a Thursday morning), and she'd be waiting by the door, at that time, on that day. Dodo had always been very self-possessed. When we brought her home as a puppy, we put her down on the lawn to be introduced to Daniel, our current Great Dane. He bent his great head towards this tiny creature, and she wagged happily at him."|"Chewing the Cud"|"Dick King-Smith"
