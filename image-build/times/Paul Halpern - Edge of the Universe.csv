"ap 03:00"|three|"Although it is straightforward to continue such counting, actually picturing the higher-dimensional bodies is much harder. The three familiar dimensions are all at right angles to one another—as in the walls and floor at the corner of a room. How can we envision additional directions perpendicular to that trio? While mathematics keeps going, could nature stop at only three? Or are we simply limited in our perceptions? Art historian Linda Dalrymple Henderson has documented the extraordinary attempts by artists and other inspired individuals—Marcel Duchamp and Salvador Dalí, for example—to paint imaginative visions of the imperceptible.2 Dalí’s rendition of the fourth dimension in the painting Cruxification (Corpus Hypercubus) offers a visually stunning example."|"Edge of the Universe"|"Paul Halpern"

On a Tuesday you see a girl wearing red shoes, on a Wednesday you see a boy with a blue shirt, and on a Thursday you see a boy chasing another boy who has a green corduroy jacket. You try to take into account each of these parameters and concoct an elaborate theory relating days, colors, clothes, and behavior. You develop a hypothesis that if a girl with red shoes and a boy with a shirt other than red leave the school at 3:00 P.M. on consecutive days, there must be at least someone wearing corduroy, of yet another color, running out the door at 3:05 P.M. on the third day. That unjustifiably close level of matching is called overfitting the data. Based on your prior experiences, you would have little basis for adding so many specific factors to your prediction. Therefore the Bayesian approach would advise that the amount of detail you put into the model would make it less likely to be accurate."|"Edge of the Universe"|"Paul Halpern"
