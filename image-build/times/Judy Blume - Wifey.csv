"ap 06:00"|six|"LAST DECEMBER while Sandy was recuperating in Jamaica, Norman was making a name for himself as athlete of the century. He’d jump out of bed at six, jog around the grounds of La Carousella for half an hour, perform Royal Canadian Air Force exercises for twenty minutes, swim a dozen laps, play eighteen holes of golf, rush out to the new court for doubles, followed by singles, followed by mixed doubles, and before dinner, while the others were napping, he was back in the pool, holding his breath under water."|Wifey|"Judy Blume"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"“I get up at six so I usually don’t have to wait.”
“Wouldn’t you rather sleep till nine?” Funky asked.
“I’m not a late sleeper,” Norman said."|Wifey|"Judy Blume"
"ap 09:32"|nine-thirty-two|"She had to hurry if she was going to make the nine-thirty-two train. She had a date to meet Lisbeth in New York for lunch and wanted to do some shopping first. She needed something for the Fourth of July formal at The Club, something black and slinky like Myra and her friends had worn in Jamaica. Maybe she’d get her hair cut too, if there was time."|Wifey|"Judy Blume"
"ap 09:30"|nine-thirty|"Sandy took golf lessons from Roger. Three mornings a week, at nine-thirty, she reported to the driving range dressed for battle. Three mornings a week Roger steadied her head with one hand as she swung at the ball. Roger smelled of Sen-Sen and old English Leather after-shave. He was determined to get her off the practice range and onto the front nine by mid-July."|Wifey|"Judy Blume"
"ap 09:30"|nine-thirty|"“Can you be down to headquarters in half an hour?”
“Well, I’ve got a nine-thirty appointment.”
“This is very important. Can you cancel, because we’ve traced the laundry markings on the sheet and we’ve picked up the guy it belongs to.”"|Wifey|"Judy Blume"
"ap 06:30"|six-thirty|"“Let me check. Yes, Thursday, the seventh. Let’s say Gino and Augusta’s at six-thirty . . . that’s on West Sixty-fourth, near the park. Is that okay, Sandy?”"|Wifey|"Judy Blume"
12:00|noon|"She’d left a trail of blood all over Puerto Rico, but by week’s end she was beginning to enjoy the feeling of Norm’s penis inside her. She was still sore but she liked the way it felt moving in and out. And she was coming, coming the way she had in the rec room, coming once or even twice every time. She wanted it more and more. She wanted it morning, noon, and night. And Norman was impressed with her responsiveness. He’d had other girls, he told her, but none like her. None who could come so fast, so hard. None who wanted it so often. It looked like it was going to work after all."|Wifey|"Judy Blume"
13:00|"one p.m."|"“A refusal to accept the archaic laws of this Club which state that women cannot tee off on Wednesdays, weekends, or holidays until one p.m. I mean, we’re members too, aren’t we? So why should we just go along with this shit? I play as good a game as most of our male members. Why should I have to wait until one p.m.?”"|Wifey|"Judy Blume"
00:00|midnight|"Soon the party was in full swing with Justine and her forces in charge. Justine was the ultimate caterer, the finest, the classiest, the most gourmet. Sandy knew the menu by heart. So did all the other guests. There would be no palatable surprises. But no one would go hungry. Crab fingers, marinated mushrooms, miniature pizzas, cheese and spinach quiche, tiny shells filled with chicken a la king, giant shrimp to hold by the tail, and later, at midnight, Justine herself would emerge from the kitchen, offering whole fillets of beef, sliced before your very eyes and placed on squares of hot garlic bread, eliminating the hostess’s need for renting china or silverware. And later still the buffet table would be laden with delectable French pastries and freshly brewed coffee. Oh, delicious . . . delicious! they would cry, even though they used Justine for all of their parties too. Myra threw three of them a year. The seasons would change, Myra’s hostess gowns would change, but Justine’s menu would remain the same. And next week and the week after that they would attend other parties at other homes, catered by Justine, and at midnight, would rave about the scrumptious sliced beef on garlic bread and how dependable Justine was, how you could count on her food being perfect, every time."|Wifey|"Judy Blume"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"At ten, a five-piece band arrived, complete with electric guitar and bongo drums, something for everyone. Sandy drank carefully although her glass seemed to fill up automatically each time she looked away. She was sure that before long someone would pass out and fall into the pool and was relieved that the house was full of doctors, just in case. Following the steak sandwiches someone declared that the girls should go topless. Myra was the first to discard her top, flinging it into the pool with a great whoop, then dancing a bouncing frug with Gordon’s friend, Dave Immerman. The best-breasted followed Myra’s lead, while the padded and the drooping wisely kept covered."|Wifey|"Judy Blume"
04:00|"4 a.m."|"SANDY AND GORDON sat in his Citröen in the parking lot of Sip n’ Sup on the highway. Gordon had ordered two hamburgers with french fries and Cokes and now, as they unwrapped their lunches and prepared to eat them, Sandy said, “Oh, God, I’ve got to go again,” and she leaped out of the car and raced inside to the Ladies Room. She’d had stomach pains and diarrhea since 4 a.m., following her episode with Gordon. She knew it was nerves. Nerves and tension and anxiety. The fear of being caught. Having to face the consequences. She could see it all too clearly."|Wifey|"Judy Blume"
"ap 05:00"|five|"NORMAN CAME HOME at five, an hour early. He took two aspirin and lay down on the sofa in the den."|Wifey|"Judy Blume"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"SANDY PICKED UP MONA at eleven the next morning and drove into New York, leaving the car on the Port Authority parking roof. It was hot, but breezy, and Mona protected her hairdo with a pink, gauzy scarf for the short walk to the building."|Wifey|"Judy Blume"
"ap 04:16"|four-sixteen|"“Oh, yes, of course, Room four-sixteen. Mrs. Lefferts said her family would be here around noon.”"|Wifey|"Judy Blume"

"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"SANDY PUT MONA ON the four o’clock bus back to Hillside, then went to Myra’s room at the St. Moritz to shower and change for her dinner with Vincent.

"ap 07:45"|seven-forty-five|"“Yes, difficult . . .” Vincent signed the Bank-Americard receipt and checked his watch. “Well, it’s just seven-forty-five. How about a movie?”"|Wifey|"Judy Blume"
"ap 09:45"|nine-forty-five|"She was finished and scraping her shoes on the mat at nine-forty-five. She showered and changed, the only member in the locker room. It was nice that way, quiet and peaceful. She tried six new combination numbers on her lock, without luck. Oh well. She’d go grocery shopping now, then home to sit on the porch and read. Yes, she’d stop by the library and get something she could sink her teeth into. Something that would make her think."|Wifey|"Judy Blume"
"ap < 04:00"|"almost four"|"“And we just got word from the company that Desert Sand has been discontinued. They’re putting out two new colors though, one’s called Beechnut and the other’s Suntan. I’ve got the samples here. If you’d come up we could put the order in right away.”
“It’s almost four.”
“I can wait.”"|Wifey|"Judy Blume"
"ap 06:02"|Six-two|"“Jesus,” Norman muttered, storming off the court. “Six-two, six-one. I told you to move out of the way, didn’t I? But you didn’t. You just stood there like a lump of clay.”"|Wifey|"Judy Blume"

But Norman would never forgive her. No, she had to go, had to play in the tournament. She dressed and drove to The Club. The sky was already gray and threatening."|Wifey|"Judy Blume"
"ap 03:00"|three|"She took a hot bath and wrote to the children.
At three the doorbell rang.

"ap 02:00"|two|"“I think I’ll have the chef’s salad.” She looked over at Shep. “I’m not very hungry,” she explained.

“Guilty,” she told him. “So where should I meet you?”"|Wifey|"Judy Blume"

“No,” he said. “I told you, I thought we could have a drink.” He held up a bottle."|Wifey|"Judy Blume"
"ap 07:45"|"Quarter to eight"|"SANDY SAT UP in bed and looked at the clock. Quarter to eight. Damn! Last night she’d told Norman she might sleep all day just to catch up. No kids for once, no demands, no responsibilities. But the noise. What was it, a truck, a bus? It sounded so close. And then the empty sound after the engine cut off. She’d never get back to sleep now. She slipped into her robe, the one the children had given her for Mother’s Day. “Daddy picked it out,” Jen had said. “Do you like it?” “Oh yes, it’s perfect,” Sandy had answered, hating it. Imagine Norman choosing the same robe for her as she had sent to his mother and her own."|Wifey|"Judy Blume"
