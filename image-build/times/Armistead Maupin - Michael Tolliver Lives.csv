12:00|noon|"At my suggestion Ben had a bathhouse afternoon just before we left for Orlando. I was paying penance-in-advance, I guess, for inflicting my family on him. (My biological family, that is—as opposed to my logical one—as Anna likes to put it.) So Ben took off for the Steamworks at noon, and I stayed at home to wash the truck and curl up in the window seat with a glass of chocolate soymilk and the latest issue of American Bungalow magazine. There was an article on Bisbee, Arizona, and its funky little bungalow neighborhoods, and I wondered if that would make a good destination for us; we’d loved our recent road trip through the Southwest and had talked of returning."|"Michael Tolliver Lives"|"Armistead Maupin"

He’s searching for daddies, of course, preferably with fur, politely deflecting the young and the smooth, the ones who inevitably regard him as their natural birthright.

"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"By four o’clock I was on the sofa watching a Netflix movie. Normally I save them for the two of us, but this one was a thriller, and Ben’s never been crazy about the creepy stuff.

"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"Irwin’s wife, Lenore, was at Children’s Bible Study, he told us, doing her puppet ministry with one of the grandkids. He expected her back by four o’clock, at which point we could discuss where to go for dinner. There were several malls nearby, offering a plenitude of choices, including an Outback whose steaks, Irwin assured me, were far superior to the Outback steaks on the West Coast. Except, of course, Irwin said Left Coast, since that’s been his favorite zinger ever since he learned it on Rush Limbaugh."|"Michael Tolliver Lives"|"Armistead Maupin"

(Mama had chosen this guy from the Yellow Pages, reasoning that someone named Joel Bernstein wasn’t likely to know anyone in Lenore and Irwin’s crowd.) When Patreese arrived, resplendent in a crisp pink shirt and gray tie, the three of them joined me in Mama’s room. We looked more like a caucus at an ACLU convention than the hastily assembled support group of a dying Christian lady."|"Michael Tolliver Lives"|"Armistead Maupin"
"ap ~ 00:00"|"about twelve"|"As it happened, Shawna took Mary Ann’s departure rather well and began a serious fascination with Connie. Flight Attendant Barbie became the centerpiece of Shawna’s toy collection and was often drafted for theatrical extravaganzas requiring a mother figure. Before long I found myself being interrogated about a woman I’d met only once—when Brian brought her to one of Anna’s Christmas parties. I’d end up telling Shawna how pretty Connie was, and how nice, and how much genuine cheer she brought into a room. But the kid was no dummy and demanded more as she grew older. She was about twelve when she grilled me one afternoon on Heart’s Desire Beach, a tree-lined cove on Tomales Bay, where we’d settled with a picnic lunch. She waited until Brian was dog-paddling offshore before asking me if I’d ever met her “real dad.”"|"Michael Tolliver Lives"|"Armistead Maupin"

Brian and Shawna headed off in their separate directions, and Ben and I went home. Anna’s condition had remained unchanged, and I was grateful, frankly, to get the smell of the hospital out of my head. I was beginning to feel a familiar tightening in my chest—a function of my meds, probably, or anxiety, or a combination of the two. It happens sometimes, I don’t know why. I was ready to breathe some clean morning air and take a shower and stretch out on the bed for a few hours. Ben was, too."|"Michael Tolliver Lives"|"Armistead Maupin"
