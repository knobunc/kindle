The army had replaced muzzle-loaders with breech-loading Springfield repeating rifles; the increased firepower allowed this small detachment to fend off the lakota and Cheyenne warriors (see Hebard and Brinin-stool, The Bozeman Trail, 2:39–87). The figures for Indian casualties nary widely. White Bull claimed that only six Indians were killed (Vestal, Warpath, 78). Capt. James W. Powell, who led the troops in the fight, estimated the number of Indians killed at sixty (Utley, Frontier Regulars, 125)."|"Black Elk Speaks"|"John G. Neihardt"

George Armstrong Custer at the head of the Seventh Cavalry to drive the Lakotas and Cheyennes down the Little Big Horn toward Gen. Gibbon’s troops. Discovering the great village on June 25, Custer divided his forces, sending a detachment under Capt. Frederick W. Benteen to circle around to the south and west to prevent the Indians from escaping. Meanwhile, Maj. Marcus A. Reno’s detachment would attack the village from the south while Custer’s troops would attack from the north. See Utley, Frontier Regulars, 257–61. Gray, Centennial Campaign, is a useful summary. For Indian perspectives and a guide to Indian sources, see Powell, People of the Sacred Mountain, 2:1009–30, 1138.

When we left, after sunset, Flying Hawk said, “That was kind of funny, the way the old man seemed to know you were coming!” My son remarked that he had the same impression; and when I had known the great old man for some years I was quite prepared to believe that he did know, for he certainly had supernormal powers."|"Black Elk Speaks"|"John G.
