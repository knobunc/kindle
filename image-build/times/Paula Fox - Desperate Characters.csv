03:00|"3:00 A.M."|"When Sophie awoke, it was 3:00 A.M. Her hand, doubled up beneath her, was like an alien object which had somehow attached itself to her body, something that had clamped itself to her. She lay there for a moment, thinking of the cat, how surprised she’d been, seeing it again, when she and Otto had come home. It had looked so ordinary, just another city stray. What had she expected? That it would have been deranged by its attack on her? That it planned to smash and cuff its way into their house and eat them both up? She got up and went into the bathroom. The swelling, which she had managed to reduce earlier by the long soak in hot water, had returned. She filled the basin and immersed her hand. Then, looking at her face in the mirror over the sink—she didn’t want to see what she was doing—she began to press the fingers of her other hand against the swollen mass of skin. When she looked down, the water was clouded. She flexed her fingers, then made a fist."|"Desperate Characters"|"Paula Fox"
12:00|noon|"Sophie did not see Francis until six months later, when he phoned her unexpectedly one day at noon. They were to meet for a drink. He was standing at the bar, reading a book, wearing glasses. “Hello,” she said. Her hand reached out to touch his arm, then she withdrew it. “Sophie,” he said."|"Desperate Characters"|"Paula Fox"
12:00|noon|"Before going to Claire’s, where she was not expected until noon, Sophie stopped by the Bazaar Provençal, a small kitchen-equipment shop on East Fifty-eighth Street. She wanted an omelet pan—it sat, substantial as its own metal, in a hazy domestic dream: a middle-aged couple sitting together over their omelette aux fines herbes, two glasses of white wine, one half of a grape cheese, two pears in a milk glass bowl…."|"Desperate Characters"|"Paula Fox"
"ap 01:00"|one|"“Total insight!” repeated Claire, laughing. “Sounds like a depot in North Dakota. Listen, I’m not claiming any such thing. In fact, I didn’t get Charlie at all—it was the way he offered himself, like a platter of antipasto, then stood back and seemed to watch one consume it. I didn’t like him. His attitudes were impeccable, all that good liberal stuff spread out before one, so reassuring, so appetizing, so flattering. I don’t like impeccable attitudes.”"|"Desperate Characters"|"Paula Fox"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"Sophie ran down the stairs and through the lobby, coming to a breathless halt outside the entrance of the building. A hairpin that had worked loose slipped down the back of her dress and fell out on the sidewalk. She looked at her watch. It was four o’clock. She didn’t think that the two of them, back up there on the second floor, would be talking about her. Her visit had been only a slight distraction for them, even a vexation, perhaps. She grew aware that someone was watching her, and looked up to see an old man staring at her idly. A gray poodle sat at his feet. How familiar he looked! A character actor? One of those familiar nameless faces she had seen a dozen times—the Duke, my Lord, is in the hands of the French. She smiled at him and he bowed."|"Desperate Characters"|"Paula Fox"
"ap 10:30"|"ten thirty"|"When she got home, Sophie went directly to the phone and called their doctor. He would not be in the office until Tuesday at ten thirty. The answering service had no suggestion to make. She could leave her number, of course, and if it was an emergency…Sophie got out the Yellow Pages and phoned six doctors within the area. None was available. One woman suggested she call a policeman."|"Desperate Characters"|"Paula Fox"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"By eleven, the cat had not appeared. Otto brought the bowl of livers inside and set it down next to the cardboard box Sophie had found in the storage closet. He moved purposefully, as though to show her that everything was going along according to plan. “It’ll be back in the morning,” he said firmly."|"Desperate Characters"|"Paula Fox"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"He ignored her. He went to empty his cigar ashes in the kitchen, returned the chair to the living room and checked the front door.
“We should leave at nine. We can be in Flynders by noon.”
“I’m going to wait here. I have to,” she said."|"Desperate Characters"|"Paula Fox"
12:00|noon|"He ignored her. He went to empty his cigar ashes in the kitchen, returned the chair to the living room and checked the front door.
“We should leave at nine. We can be in Flynders by noon.”
“I’m going to wait here. I have to,” she said."|"Desperate Characters"|"Paula Fox"
"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"“The doctor, the one who does the examination, doesn’t come in until Monday. You don’t have to call them, just as the nurse said. If there’s anything—there won’t be—they will telephone you before noon on Monday. It’s really over now.”"|"Desperate Characters"|"Paula Fox"
12:00|noonday|"Once, Flynders had been a town, a center for the neighboring farms. Most of the farmland, abandoned and neglected, had reverted to marsh and had once been a halting place for a myriad of birds. Every summer house had, still, in cupboard or basket or bookcase, worn copies of Roger Tory Peterson’s Field Guide to the Birds. Then the village people had called in the mosquito-control people. Now there were few birds, and poison ivy and Virginia creeper flourished in the acid earth. The elm blight had destroyed those trees not already harmed by frequent droughts. But in the center of the village, three copper beeches survived, black in the noonday sun, purple in the twilight. Even the villagers prized them, not so rapturously as the summer people, perhaps. One manor house remained unoccupied and unsold. It sat on a small rise, a menacing, ugly house, a barrow, deposited and deserted by some 1920’s millionaire and left there to testify to the power of money to create a permanent and quarrelsome unloveliness."|"Desperate Characters"|"Paula Fox"
12:00|noon|"“That old brute? Who would take it?”
“Can you stay home tomorrow until noon?”
“Why do you persist in thinking they’re going to call you?”"|"Desperate Characters"|"Paula Fox"
"ap ~ 03:00"|"Around three o’clock"|"The house creaked quietly to itself in the dark. Around three o’clock, an east wind blew down the street, moving the stiff young branches of the maple trees. A small gray mouse ran from beneath the Bentwood refrigerator, across the kitchen floor, and out to the dining room, where it wedged itself beneath an armoire in which Sophie kept the table linen."|"Desperate Characters"|"Paula Fox"
06:00|"six in the morning"|"It was six in the morning. Through the open kitchen door, Sophie felt the morning sunlight on her bare feet like a sustained and mindless stare. She poured herself a shot glass of whisky, then drank it down hastily, catching glimpses, as her head fell back, of the waxed surface of kitchen cabinets, a flash of scoured pots, a line of sharp Sabatier knives gripped by a strip of magnet. She set the glass down in the sink and saw a line, like a slug’s trail, of dried gray spume circling the drain, the residue, the mark of the night tides from a hidden urban sea of pipes and sewers. Turning on the tap, she flushed out the sink, making loud childish sounds of disgust, momentarily amused by her own noise. Then she walked quickly to the dining room, feeling a sudden intense desire for more sunlight, for signs of life in the windows across the yard."|"Desperate Characters"|"Paula Fox"
06:00|"six in the morning"|"The small still life echoing Otto’s presence filled her with uncertainty. Although she had only just left him asleep upstairs, having waked in an instant from deep sleep to find herself standing next to the bed, shivering and displaced as though she’d spent the night illicitly, these reminders on the table, paradoxically, cast a doubt on his proximity. But then, it was probably the whisky. She had never had a drink at six in the morning—it was a hell of a way to start Monday."|"Desperate Characters"|"Paula Fox"
12:00|noon|"“What a nasty indifferent way to manage things! I have to wait until noon without a word from them. Then, a minute later, I’m supposed to know everything is all right?”"|"Desperate Characters"|"Paula Fox"
"ap 08:30"|"eight thirty"|"He grabbed up his briefcase, gave her a look of pure exasperation, and shouted, “Sophie! It’s too much!” and closed the door on whatever she might have shouted back.
It was eight thirty.
She was indignant that he had gone, leaving her in the chilly entryway, still wordlessly begging that some incident would force him back, that he would have forgotten something, and that once he opened the door, he would not see any reason for going. She even waited several minutes, poised forward, listening. He was like everyone else, witlessly inflexible, treating his own actions as if they stemmed from inexorable natural laws. Damn him! He had closed her out into the house!"|"Desperate Characters"|"Paula Fox"
"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"Was it the phone call she was afraid of? Or was it that she knew she would refuse those inoculations? Was that why, against all reason, reassurances, statistics, she continued to believe in nothing but the event itself? And that the appalling certainty that the phone would ring before noon did not arise from reason or its systems, but was a fatal estimate of her true life?"|"Desperate Characters"|"Paula Fox"
"< 12:00"|"a few minutes before noon"|"From a drawer she took out paper and envelope. She filled the old fountain pen Otto had found for her in an antique shop from a small crystal ink bottle that stood on its own silver claw feet. The foot of the desk chair was caught in the fringes of the rug and, just as she bent down to disentangle it, she heard the sound of a key in the front door. She stood up and glanced at the bedside clock in surprise. It was a few minutes before noon. Otto’s footsteps were audible on the stairs; then he walked into the bedroom."|"Desperate Characters"|"Paula Fox"
"ap 10:30"|"ten thirty"|"“I took care of a few things, then planned to come right home,” he said. He looked very tired. “I was going to call you to tell you I was coming, but I was afraid the phone’s ringing would scare you. You’d think it was about the cat turning up crazy. The subway was awful. I was wild…I left the office at ten thirty and it’s taken me all this time. Some youths were on a rampage. They broke some windows and…youths!” With consuming bitterness, he repeated the last word. “So the trains were all delayed. I didn’t know what to do.”"|"Desperate Characters"|"Paula Fox"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"By imagining a dramatic moment as a series of physical gestures—by paying close attention—Fox makes room here for each aspect of Sophie’s complexity: her liberality, her self-delusion, her vulnerability, and, above all, her married-person’s consciousness. Desperate Characters is the rare novel that does justice to both sides of marriage, both hate and love, both her and him. Otto is a man who loves his wife. Sophie is a woman who downs a shot of whiskey at six o’clock on a Monday morning and flushes out the kitchen sink “making loud childish sounds of disgust.” Otto is mean enough to say, “Lotsa luck, fella” when Charlie leaves the firm; Sophie is mean enough to ask him, later, why he said it; Otto is mortified when she does; Sophie is mortified for having mortified him."|"Desperate Characters"|"Paula Fox"
