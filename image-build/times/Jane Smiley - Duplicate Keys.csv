I walked down Broadway, and bought a paper at Seventy-ninth Street. The vendor knows me. It’s ten blocks from my place, so it must have taken me about twenty minutes. I didn’t see anyone. I let myself in, because there isn’t a doorman, and went up the elevator to the sixth floor. I’ve been in that building almost more than I’ve been in my own, so I’m very familiar with everything about it. Nothing was different. I mean, out of place or anything.” Honey drew his left hand across the paper and wrote behind it. “I opened the door. Everything was very neat.” With the light streaming in, arrowing among the spikes of succulents, the ivy vines, the heavy, glossy leaves of avocados, the silvered masses of cyclamen, the rosy coleus. Drapes open, skylights blue with sunshine. Alice swallowed, but something in her throat would neither go down nor come up. The detective said, “Did you step into the room before you saw them?”"|"Duplicate Keys"|"Jane Smiley"

Alice stood up, too, and then, almost immediately, she was outside, in front of the precinct station. It was a brilliant day, of breezy clarity and substantial warmth.

Joggers and dog walkers were out in fleets. After a full week of adamantine blue skies, the grass along the river had lost the freshness briefly attained during a damp April, but the trees swayed in full, sybaritic leaf. They walked along the river toward the boat basin, and Alice said, “Does the weather make you feel better or worse?”"|"Duplicate Keys"|"Jane Smiley"

The cleaning, which had been for Susan an act of love and purgation, had been for Alice a horror, even after the boys’ shades were exorcised from the orange chairs. Susan went to bed. Agitated, Alice went into the kitchen and made some herb tea reputed to induce slumber. All up and down Eighty-fourth Street, buildings rose dark into the darkness. From her window she could see only one light on, and that one, behind frosted glass, probably a bathroom light left on for children. Even most of the building entrances were dark. Alice wondered if the contemplation of dozens, or hundreds (what would be the population of Eighty-fourth Street?) of sleepers could bring her sleep."|"Duplicate Keys"|"Jane Smiley"

But maybe they were merely curious. There hadn’t, after all, been as much attention to the story as Craig might have wanted. Rya sat between Alice and Noah. As the church, Mount St. Ursula’s (chosen by the funeral home because it was nearby), filled with sightseers, Rya said, “I want to tell you that Noah and I went to see Ain’t Misbehavin’ last night.”"|"Duplicate Keys"|"Jane Smiley"

"ap ~ 06:00"|"About six"|"Smiling as broadly as she could, Alice said, “About six, then. Bananas. I’ll stop at the Fairway.” She got out at the bus stop and Susan rolled away. On the trip downtown Alice put her purse between her feet, stepping firmly on the strap, and used her hands to count up her friends. With Laura, Sidney, and Howard, to whose homes she had never been, and Janet O’Connor, who had so many children, in Minneapolis, that she never had time to write, Alice still could not fill up two hands. Denny and Craig, of course, could hardly be so soon replaced, and it was hard to tell if Jim Ellis should be called a friend or not. There was no one else, no lover from the years since Jim that she could even telephone. The fewness of them shocked her, and what shocked her even more was that until now they had seemed plenteous, a wealth of friends. Of course, she had spent her whole childhood with her parents, not understanding the occasional sympathetic query, “Wouldn’t you like to have brothers and sisters?” To share Doreen and Hugh? Wasn’t seven at the table, plus friends, for holidays, an enormous number? Riding downtown on the Fifth Avenue bus, Alice felt for the first time in her life depopulated. She tried to think that Susan’s suspicions of their friends didn’t have to influence her, but posing the unanswerable question, to whom would she go if she had to, she saw that already the influence was felt. Her brief, nearly involuntary mental images of Noah killing Craig out of a jealous passion (and Denny because he entered the apartment at the wrong moment?) and of Ray lending out his key to thugs and of Rya teasing Noah with the rivalry of his best friend distanced her absolutely from them no matter how she regretted it. Of course, there was Susan. Alice smiled at the richness of the friendship: its length, its intimacy, its comfort, at her own deftness in handling Susan’s porcupine periods and at Susan’s skill with her jellyfish periods. There would always be Susan, but still—She jumped off at the library. She rarely came in this late, and when she looked up toward the grand sunlit facade with its rising pigeons and tranquil lions, she thought it beautiful. Susan’s phrase, “A mighty fortress is our library,” recurred to her. Just then it did seem that a dozen acquaintances and one beautiful building might indeed equal a friend."|"Duplicate Keys"|"Jane Smiley"

And he didn’t know how not to answer the phone while he was talking to her, and in the middle of the third phone call, when he was running his finger down the schedules looking for an empty room, he knocked everything off his desk, including his cup of coffee. Still, she found out from asking passers-by that he was the only person who even might know something. Everyone else had gone on a delivery or out to dinner. Alice looked at her watch. It was nearly six. Her trip from the library had been a chain of time-consuming mistakes—getting into a cab that got stuck in traffic, getting out of it just before the jam eased, bumping into people, turning down wrong streets. The boy got off the phone again, looked at the mess on the floor, and said, “Oh, shit. Shee-it.”"|"Duplicate Keys"|"Jane Smiley"
"ap 06:33"|"six thirty-three"|"Alice stood between two doors, with her eye on a third, waiting for someone to come out. No one did. At last, she opened the door to her right and saw that the room, cavernous and completely insulated, was empty. So was the room to her left. Across the hall, a man with a guitar looked up and scowled before she could get the door shut. She crept toward the stairs. Her own behavior was making her afraid. Surely it hadn’t really been an emergency. Ray hadn’t called it an emergency. He had wanted her, but he hadn’t needed her. If he needed someone, wouldn’t he call Noah, or some friend that Alice didn’t know, someone who’d seen him more frequently over the last year? Thinking of how they had drifted apart rather reassured Alice. At the top of the stairs she stood up straight. A face she recognized came out of one room and went into another, but she barely had time to remember the name, much less ask him if he knew Ray Reschley. The emptiness of the high-ceilinged corridor made her jumpy. She looked at her watch. It was six thirty-three. She opened the door next to her. Inside, someone very famous, judging by his resplendent clothing and his entourage, was practicing. No Ray. Five chords boomed over her before she got the door closed. After that she knew that she couldn’t open any more doors. Shortly after that, she began to view favorably the notion that Ray had gone home. Why should the kid lie? Ray was probably in his apartment right now, wondering what had happened to her. She should go home, too, and wait for his call. Call him, even. The door in her distracted gaze opened, startling her. A Rastafarian sauntered out. Alice squeaked, as she had planned, “Do you know Ray Reschley?”"|"Duplicate Keys"|"Jane Smiley"

01:00|"one in the morning"|"“Jerry McMann! Right! It seems to me that he spent the evening talking about all the other girls in the bar, what they looked like, what they were wearing. Anyway, these two guys got up on stage and sang a lot of folk music. Kingston Trio, the usual. But every set they sang two songs, ‘Don’t Think Twice, It’s All Right’ and ‘That’s What You Get for Lovin’ Me.’ I was entranced. I didn’t even realize that Jerry was boring, and I loved watching Denny and Craig. Those two songs made them seem so mean, and then they’d sing something like ‘Early Morning Rain’ and instead of seeming mean, they’d seem tormented. We sat there for hours. Sometime in the last set, they sang that old Ian and Sylvia thing called ‘Song for Canada’ and I just knew they were Canadians. Denny was completely hairy, as if he’d just gotten in from the Arctic, and Craig simply looked exciting. He could have been from anywhere far away and difficult. Then Jerry said we should buy a pitcher and get the singers, who he knew slightly, and the girls at the next table, who he kept talking about, to join us. It worked like a charm, except that the funny thing was that I angled to sit next to Craig, and then one of the girls just shot in there and grabbed the seat, so I was stuck sitting next to Denny, who looked almost normal rather than in the advanced stages of some Romantic agony. The first thing he said to me was ‘I was watching you from the stage,’ which of course sounded thrilling and sophisticated. These two guys just moved in on Jerry, and it was so graceful and worldly and perfectly cruel that it seemed marvellous to me. There was a teasing sexual innuendo in everything they said that flattered us and made us laugh and made adulthood seem very possible and desirable. I’m sure I was arch and joking and rather distant, I mean, you had to be, but inside I was leaning and melting, and when Denny told me he was from Minnesota after all, and then when he talked affectionately about his family and all the other kids, he somehow didn’t get any less exotic or cruel, he just got exotic and cruel and familiar and kind and desirous and experienced all at the same time. We left Jerry at the bar, which seemed to be what he deserved, and went to their apartment, which was furnished entirely with mattresses on the bare floor and with their record collection, and of course Craig got out the dope and the unfiltered apple juice, and there was Country Joe and kissing on the Indian bedspreads and discussion of whether marijuana enhanced or dampened sexual desire, and then some friends came over to play music, and that was what really struck me, that friends who rode motorcycles could just walk in at one in the morning. Exotic again! I shook his hand in the doorway, but there seemed such a terrible lack of compromise between never seeing Denny again and becoming his slave.”"|"Duplicate Keys"|"Jane Smiley"

"ap 10:35"|"ten thirty-five"|"“Wonderful,” said Alice, smiling a good enough smile. In spite of himself, Henry, too, sighed. Alice wondered if he hoped that she wouldn’t know how to interpret it. When she looked at her watch it was only ten thirty-five. She nearly groaned aloud. Only a week had passed, exactly a week. At Grand Army Plaza, Henry Mullet forgot himself, took her hand, and ran her off the train. He was physical in a way that Jim Ellis was not. Although Jim hovered around you, desire shooting out of him like sparks, either the desire to do something, or, more uncomfortably, the desire for you to do something, he hardly ever touched. When he did, it was a stroke or a prod or even a glancing light blow. Henry Mullet was a grasper, a holder-in-place, a propeller, a preserver from traffic. Alice wasn’t sure she liked it."|"Duplicate Keys"|"Jane Smiley"
"ap < 05:00"|"nearly five"|"“If that’s your main experience, you’re lucky! Anyway, it is with you.” Alice smiled, then blushed, afraid she had implied something beyond incipient friendship, but one of Henry’s virtues was apparently tact. He smiled, but slightly, without making eye contact. It was nearly five when they left the restaurant. Although still not compelling, Henry was not like any other man she knew. She walked in his aura of safety and enthusiasm as under an umbrella, certain, among other things, that Ray was okay and the murder well in the past. Although he himself did not fascinate her—she didn’t care to hear, for example, about his family in Wisconsin or his experiences in grammar school—in his company, many things were interesting, and while Alice felt dull by contrast, Henry did not seem bored with her, and so the familiar worry about being good enough company did not nag her. He talked of books he had read and books they had both read. There were books she had read that he had always meant to read. While he had been to the Orient, she had been to Mexico, and he quizzed her enviously. In his talk there was a vivid sense of the populous, busy world. It was enormously agreeable, and Alice found herself kissing him on the cheek as they waited for the subway train back to Manhattan. Henry squeezed her shoulders.

Susan didn’t call to remind her of their pleasant day or gossip about Honey, and Henry Mullet didn’t call to tell her that he had thought about her all day, so that she could admit the same to him. On second thought, however, he probably hadn’t thought of her much at all. He wasn’t the type. His mind, considering trees and shrubs and “herbaceous plants” (Alice savored the words) would be undivided, wholly concentrated. It was one of his finest qualities. So in spite of the resolute silence of the phone, Alice smiled and hummed around the seven-room apartment, thinking of Henry’s fine qualities. She took a bath, knowing he would call her out of it as soon as she was settled into it (“I just figured you would call now, I’m dripping”), but he didn’t. Nor while she was brushing her teeth, creaming her face, looking through the drawers and laundry basket for pajama bottoms. Even as she got into bed and took up her book, the phone didn’t ring. She picked it up to see if it was dead. It sizzled with life. Finally discouraged, she turned out the light and settled herself to forget it."|"Duplicate Keys"|"Jane Smiley"

For a friendship, or even a companionable love affair she was an excellent bet, but for someone who said Alice in just that way? Henry did not go on. She said, “What time is it?”

She carried a little cloud of thought in her head from stack to stack and floor to floor and she hummed. When she took a pile of books to her desk, she found a note that Susan had the car out to do errands, and that she would pick her up at five. If she really wanted to take the bus, she was to call. Alice looked at the note for a long time, because, oddly, she really did want to take the bus. When she imagined herself calling Susan, though, and expressing such a thing (“Don’t be silly! It’ll be jammed! We can stop at—”) she knew it was impossible. Somehow, though, she didn’t want Susan coming there, to the library. Or Honey, either. She lived in dread of Honey’s showing up and quizzing her on the steps again. None of them! They had invaded her apartment, and she didn’t want a single one of them even looking up a book in her card catalogue. She put down Susan’s note and picked up her list of poets. Of course they were obscure, she thought angrily. None of them was any good.

She idly deplored this disintegration of materials, and said to herself all the clichés about what the library needed. She counted the names on her list and estimated how much of tomorrow her search would use up. She saw, as she turned out the light after herself, a flash of fabric, the heel of a shoe disappearing around one of the white metal bookstacks. It startled her, the presence of another person, no doubt one of the clerks, in someplace so obscure. Although if you thought about it, no place in this cataloguing system could be any obscurer than any other place, since at least the oldest books were arranged according to size and date of acquisition rather than according to subject or author. Alice could not help pausing and catching her breath, listening for the retreat of footsteps. There were no sounds. She walked down the aisle toward the stairs to the floor below.

When she came to the book she wanted, she put her hand on it, and then, almost involuntarily, she paused for a long time, staring at the brown binding, absolutely still, making no noise, hearing no noise.

As she looked at it now it seemed so alien as to be almost funny. For what cause could those eleven men, was it, have possibly died, and wasn’t there one still buried in the walls? Not for the great work of preserving books, since as an edifice of book preservation, the library was not ideal. For the greater glory of Lennox, Astor, and Tilden, then? She let herself out of the librarians’ station between the reading rooms and glanced up at the spot where men had come once to scrub up the gold leaf of the vault, a vast and dangerous undertaking that trustees in the modem era had rejected as not cost effective. The experimental spot still glowed."|"Duplicate Keys"|"Jane Smiley"
"ap 02:00"|two|"Henry chuckled happily. He had made coffee. The dishes from the night before, which Alice had seen beside the sink, were washed. A round, cold, golden grapefruit blushed with rose at the stem end sat in the middle of the kitchen table like a bouquet of flowers. At two places were folded paper napkins and grapefruit spoons. Susan seemed a continent away. “I haven’t got much,” said Henry. “I always eat the same thing for breakfast, and I can’t imagine that you’d like it.”"|"Duplicate Keys"|"Jane Smiley"

She could not help assuming it was Henry, but the grin faded when she saw Detective Honey leaning on the desk and surveying the reference room with his professional eye. He looked out of place, as if he felt superior to mere dictionaries and encyclopedias. Annoyed, Alice snapped, “People are waiting to use this desk. We should go outside.”"|"Duplicate Keys"|"Jane Smiley"
"ap 03:10"|"ten after three"|"IT WAS one of those long nights of awaking into desire, making love, falling asleep, bumping into one another, and awaking into desire again. When Alice’s eyes opened permanently, it was still dark. Henry was in love with her. Food was out all over the house. Alice got up as carefully as possible and went into the living room. She seemed to have been at Henry’s for ten years. It was ten after three. With the best of intentions about clearing the table and putting the food away, she stood idly by the window, not trying to sort out her thoughts, for that would be impossible, but trying to think them one at a time. The moon, which must have been above and behind Henry’s building, shone with penetrating whiteness upon the windows of her apartment, into them, in fact. She could make out any number of things, including the sandals she had worn to work, which she had left on the kitchen floor while washing the raspberries. From this angle, with this full moon, her apartment was wide open. It was disconcerting, but not nearly so disconcerting as Henry’s declaration of love. The possibility of his friendship, of his good advice, of a concentrated focus on her tangle of ignorance now seemed hopelessly remote. While she talked he would look at her hair or her breasts. His advice would be too quick and enthusiastic, too colored by the vividness of his new feelings and his wish to protect them. It was not a matter of trying. Henry would try hard to be calm and objective, but in Alice’s limited experience, lovers were as often adversaries of a sort as they were friends. In addition, there was her undutiful self, who could think with some perspective, who could panic and hesitate under the weight of someone’s love, but only if the lover was not in the room. She was doomed to reciprocate on the first eligible occasion. Whether or not it was Henry she adored, it was certain that she did adore, that she shivered with delight every time she thought of Henry actually saying, “Alice, I love you.”"|"Duplicate Keys"|"Jane Smiley"
"ap 03:25"|3:25|"There was a movement in her apartment. She stood up in surprise and leaned against the windowpane. There certainly had been a movement in her apartment, something white above the floor had moved from the dining room to the kitchen. Whatever it was stayed back from the window and Alice didn’t see it again. Her body had gone cold, and now was covered with goosebumps. There was something in her apartment! Someone, really. Someone in a white shirt that reflected the moonlight. She looked in each window systematically, starting in the laundry room, then the living room, then the dining room, then the kitchen. Whoever it was didn’t appear again, but there had been something odd—the sandals. The sandals in the kitchen that had been right in the middle of the floor were off to one side and separated. Whoever it was had stumbled over them and kicked them. Alice put her hand on the window frame and gripped it tightly. The clock on Henry’s coffeetable read 3:25. Alice dragged her eyes from the clock and back to the darkened windows across the street. She watched for a long time. There were no lights, no movements, but also no appearances at the street entrance, the only way besides the fire escape of getting out of her building."|"Duplicate Keys"|"Jane Smiley"
"ap 04:55"|"five minutes of five"|"Inexorably, the stillness across the street grew boring, and her concentration began to fail. The buildings in her peripheral vision began to change shape, first expanding, then contracting. Her corneas seemed to dry out. She closed her eyes for a second and then opened them without knowing how long she had failed to watch. When she opened them, she understood. Obviously, her night-time visitor was Susan, the only person with a key. It was almost light. She had fallen asleep. She turned to the clock, which read five minutes of five, took a deep breath of relief, and began to pick up items from the table and carry them into the kitchen."|"Duplicate Keys"|"Jane Smiley"

Against Susan there was no evidence, only a feeling on Alice’s part borne of confusing conversations and 3 a.m. hallucinations. Every time she thought of the scene, of the motive, of the opportunity, nothing told against Susan, no fact damned her, nothing about her threw all the fragments into alignment. Although Alice’s conviction of Susan’s guilt remained unshaken, everything ameliorated it. After work she ran into Henry on the corner of Eighty-fourth and West End, and he embraced her as a matter of course and kissed her with perfect self-confidence, as if he expected his kisses to be welcome. They were, but only in retrospect. She felt him notice her coldness and elect to ignore it. To make up, she put her arm around his waist, but resolved not to go back to his apartment with him. There she would be unable to think at all."|"Duplicate Keys"|"Jane Smiley"

“What for? It’s after nine.”
“You’ll see. Leave it to me.” Susan walked along with complete docility, her clogs tapping the pavement. Alice took her hand off the other woman’s elbow and put it around her waist. “I’m starving,” she said. “I’ll take you out to dinner.

"ap 08:00"|"Eight o’clock"|"“Let’s have some cake.” This is how they would go on, Alice was tempted to think, certainly for the rest of the evening and maybe for years, maintaining separate residences, perhaps, but living as close together as a pair of shoes. Soon, sometime in the next ten minutes, the night’s conversation would take root. First, two or three topics would be begun and discarded as boring or worn out. This would happen automatically, a result of the cake or the newspaper open on the floor or the view of a neighbor passing across the street. Inevitably, though, something would take root, then grow and branch and exfoliate into a whole evening’s talk. Susan rolled over and reached under the coffeetable for the Arts and Leisure section of last Sunday’s paper. Alice smiled and wandered over to the chair across from her. Weren’t they set for life, with steady jobs, enough money, no commitments, couldn’t this last for years, in a way that marriage could never last, without effort, without swings in desire, or mistakes in translation, or the balancing of needs that marriages always demanded? People stayed home for passion and went out for companionship, when actually the reverse would work much better. Alice picked up the book review and glanced over the poetry reviews. Susan said, “There’s a free concert of medieval consort music at the Cloisters. Eight o’clock.”"|"Duplicate Keys"|"Jane Smiley"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"Alice had left before eleven, still unwilling to actually sleep in that apartment, and was now sitting naked and freshly bathed in her dark kitchen, drinking a glass of milk. In a detached but interested way, as if scientifically, she was considering the fact of the murder, and Susan’s identity as the murderer. It hardly moved her at all any more. She had thought Thursday night that the surprise would never leave her, that without wishing to she would never look at Susan and not sense those two corpses in close proximity. But she had apparently overestimated her capacity for moral outrage. Homicidal drunk drivers and cheating landlords that she saw on the news outraged her more. Everything about her upbringing and education had prepared her for a grand repudiation of this wrong: Susan had taken two lives, and two lives that Alice was close to and cared about. Nonetheless, Alice knew that her adoration of her friend, and her anticipation of lasting, comfortable intimacy were greater than ever. The evening before, she could have sent Susan back to Chops and gone off with Henry, but she had not. Although monumentally confused just at the moment, she had not acted confused at all.

It was nearly twelve, he would already be in bed, but even as she thought it, she was struggling with her jeans and looking for a casual but attractive shirt. Keys? Keys?
