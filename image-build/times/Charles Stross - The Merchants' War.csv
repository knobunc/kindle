"> 01:00"|"an hour after midnight"|"""Shit,"" she moaned quietly, ""shit!"" She sat down on the bed and rested her head in her hands, her energy and will to resist fading frighteningly fast. It had been a long and terrible day, and even standing up felt like a battle. What have I done? Erasmus was nuts, or playing a sick joke on her, sending her to a brothel to talk to the madam: although, on further thought, it didn't seem particularly strange compared to the rest of this eventful day. She'd been dragged out of her house arrest, shanghaied into a forced wedding, just missed being blown up by a bomb, seen the king and the prince she'd been engaged to gunned down (and who knew what the hell was going to happen in the Gruinmarkt now?) and run into an old heartthrob (and what the hell was he doing there, working for the DEA?). Then she'd lied for her life, been attacked by muggers, menaced by a cabbie who thought she was a prostitute, and finally locked up in another goddamned prison cell, this time in a brothel. I'm going to go mad, she thought dizzily, lying down on the lumpy mattress. I can't take much more of this. But instead, she fell asleep. And that was how they found her when they came for her, an hour after midnight."|"The Merchants' War"|"Charles Stross"
"ap ~ 10:00"|"About ten"|"The room was maybe twenty feet long and eight feet wide, with a ten-foot ceiling. Naked unpainted cinder block walls, a galvanized tin ceiling, and a concrete floor completed the scene. There was a big rolling door at one end and dust everywhere. But what caught her attention was the sheer size of the cylinder that, standing on concrete blocks, dominated the room. ""Sweet baby Jesus,"" she whispered. It was at least ten feet long, and had to be a good four feet in diameter. There was barely room to walk around the behemoth. She shone her torch along the cylinder, expecting to see-""what the hell?"" ""Herz, report! What have you seen?"" ""It's a cylinder,"" she said slowly. ""About ten, twelve feet long, four, five feet in diameter. Supported on concrete blocks. One end is rounded; there's some kind of collar about three feet from the other end and four vanes sticking out, sort of like the fins on 'a bomb..."" She trailed off. Like the fins on a bomb, she thought, dazed. Jesus, this can't be here! She shook herself and continued, ""there's some kind of equipment trolley near the back end, and some wires going into the, the back of the bomb."" She glanced down at her watch. The second hand was spinning round. It was a logarithmic counter, and it had jumped from tens of becquerels per second to tens of thousands as she crossed the threshold. Gamma emission from secondary activation isotopes created by neutron absorption, she heard the lecture replay in her mind's eye; Geiger counters can't detect neutrons until the flux is way too high for safety, but over lime a neutron source will tend to activate surrounding materials. ""I'm reading secondaries. I think we've got a hot one. I'm coming out now."" A quick sweep across the screen door in front of the gadget's nose revealed no telltale trip wires. ""No sign of booby traps."""|"The Merchants' War"|"Charles Stross"

Angbard, Duke Lofstrom, might write his personal correspondence with a fountain pen and leave the carrying of mobile phones to his subordinates, but his communications security was the best that the Clan's money could buy."|"The Merchants' War"|"Charles Stross"
"ap 07:45"|"quarter to eight"|"The next day came too early for Erasmus. It was barely a quarter to eight when he checked out of the cheap traveler's hotel he'd stayed in overnight, and walked around to the rear entrance to Hogarth Villas. Lady Bishop's taciturn manservant Edward answered the door, then led him down a servants' passage and a staircase that led to a gloomy basement, illuminated by the dim light that filtered down to the bottom of an air shaft."|"The Merchants' War"|"Charles Stross"

If you make yourself at home, I'll find Dr. Hu and get things started."""|"The Merchants' War"|"Charles Stross"
"ap 06:00"|"six o'clock"|"He'd stopped again, opposite a diamond-paned window. Through it she could just about make out the seats and basins of a hairdresser: some things seemed to evolve towards convergence, however distinct they'd been at the start. ""I think I can just about manage that."" She tried to smile, but the knot of tension had gotten a toehold back and wouldn't let go. ""This will probably take a couple of hours. Then I need to buy clothes. Why don't you just tell me where the hotel is, and I'll meet you there at six o'clock? How does that sound?"""|"The Merchants' War"|"Charles Stross"
"~ 18:00"|"about six in the evening"|"Just as the guard handed Erie back his mobile phone, it rang. ""Hey, good timing!"" The cop chuckled, Eric flipped it open, ignoring the man. It had already been a long day: back home it was about six in the evening, and he still had to fly back. ""Smith here."""|"The Merchants' War"|"Charles Stross"
"~ 00:30"|"around half past midnight"|"Eric shook his head tiredly. ""I'm touching down around half past midnight. If you get any pushback between now and then, call me and I'll come in. If it goes smoothly, I might as well get some sleep before I debrief him."" A thought struck him. ""Another thing. I want a guard with him at all times, with a voice recorder in case he says any-thing. And I don't want random doctors or nurses eavesdropping."""|"The Merchants' War"|"Charles Stross"
"ap 06:30"|"half-past six"|"""Ow, you cruel, heartless man!"" She struggled to sit up, covering her eyes. ""What time is it?""
""It's half-past six, and we need to be on the train at ten to eight.""
""Ouch. Okay, I'm awake already!"" She squinted into the light. Burgeson was fully dressed, if a bit rumpled-looking. ""The chaise was a bit cramped?"""|"The Merchants' War"|"Charles Stross"

"ap 06:50"|"ten to seven"|"""Possibly. And then again, it might just be routine. Let me help you."" Erasmus passed her hat down from the coat rack, then gathered up her two shopping bags. ""The sooner we're out of town the better. There's a train at ten to seven, and we can just catch it if we make haste."""|"The Merchants' War"|"Charles Stross"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o'clock"|"""We're going to deliberately get on the wrong train."" He steered her around a pillar box, then into the entrance to the station concourse, and simultaneously passed her a stubby cardboard ticket.

"ap 08:15"|"eight fifteen"|"Huw checked his wristwatch for about the ten-thousandth time. It was coming up on eight fifteen, and the sun was already below the horizon. Another half hour and it would be nighttime proper. I could go over and look for him, he told himself. If he misses this return window, I could go over tomorrow. Elena's video footage had been rubbish, the condensation on her helmet camera lens blurring everything into a madcap smear of dark green shade and glaring sunlight, but Hulius was wearing a radio beacon. If anything had happened-"|"The Merchants' War"|"Charles Stross"
"ap 04:10"|"ten past four"|"""Okay..."" Brill picked up her bag and scouted the top floor briefly, then returned to the kitchen. The carton of half-and-half in the fridge was fresh, and there was a neat pile of unopened mail on the tabletop, the most recent postmarked the day before. And there was no dust. She checked her watch: ten past four. Might as well wait, she thought, and began to set up the coffee machine."|"The Merchants' War"|"Charles Stross"
"< 12:00"|"nearly noon"|"Back at the rented house, Huw got down to the serious job of redistributing their packs and making sure everything they'd need found a niche in one rucksack or another. It didn't take long to put everything together: what took time was double-checking, asking what have I forgotten about that could kill me? When finally they were all ready it was nearly noon."|"The Merchants' War"|"Charles Stross"
"> 14:00"|"just past two in the afternoon"|"""I think you're right."" Huw cast around for more chunks of half-buried roadstone. Now that he knew what he was looking for it wasn't difficult to find. ""It ran that way, north-northeast, I think."" Turning to look in the opposite direction he saw a shadowy tunnel, just about as wide as a two-lane road. Some trees had erupted through the surface over the years, but for the most part it had held the forest at bay. ""Okay, this way is downhill. Let's plant a waypoint and-""he looked up at the heavy overcast""-follow it for an hour, or until it starts to rain, before we head back."" He checked his watch. It was just past two in the afternoon. ""I don't want to get too far from base camp today."""|"The Merchants' War"|"Charles Stross"
"ap ~ 10:00"|"around ten o'clock"|"I seem to be spending all my time throwing up these days. Miriam sat on the edge of her bed, the chamber pot clutched between her hands and knees in the pre-dawn light. What's wrong with me? A sense of despondency Washed over her. All I need right now is a stomach bug,.. she yawned experimentally, held her breath, and let her back relax infinitesimally as she realized that her stomach was played out. Damn. She put the pot back in its under-bunk drawer and swung her legs back under the sheets. She yawned again, exhausted, then glanced at the window in mild disgust. Might as well get started now, she told herself. There was no way she'd manage another hours sleep before it was time to get up anyway: the train was due to pause in Dunedin around ten o'clock, and she needed to get her letter written first. The only question Was what to put in it..."|"The Merchants' War"|"Charles Stross"
12:00|noon|"The festivities had started at dawn, when Sir Markus, beater for the royal hunt, had led his levies up to the gates of Wergatfurt and laid his demand before the burghers of the town. Open the gates to the royal army, accept the Thorold Palace edicts, surrender any witches and their get, and be at peace-or defy the king, and suffer the consequences. He had put on a brave show, but (at Otto's urging) had carefully not placed troops on the town's south-western, upstream, side. And he'd given them until noon to answer his demands."|"The Merchants' War"|"Charles Stross"
"~ 12:00"|"Around noon"|"Around noon, he got out of the house for a couple of hours, driven stir-crazy by the daytime TV. It took him nearly ten minutes to get the car seat adjusted, and an hour of hobbling around Barnes and Noble and a couple of grocery stores left him feeling like he'd run a marathon, but he made it home uneventfully. Then he discovered that he hadn't figured on carrying the grocery sacks and bag of books and magazines up the front steps. He ended up so exhausted that by the time he got the last bag in and closed the door he was about ready to drop. He hobbled into the lounge clutching the bookbag, and lowered the bag onto the coffee table before he realized the lounger was already occupied."|"The Merchants' War"|"Charles Stross"
01:00|"One, am"|"Rudi missed the rest. Down below, sparks were flashing from the gatehouse. Startled, he let go of the binoculars and threw himself to the left, side-slipping away from the tower. A faint crackling sound reached his ears, audible over the buzz of the engine. ""Rudi, Pappa One, am under fire from the palace, over."" He leaned back to the right, feeling a bullet pluck at the fabric of his wing. This shouldn't he happening, he told himself, disbelieving: the altimeter was still showing two thousand feet. How are they reaching me? A horrible suspicion took hold. ""Pappa One, Rudi, they've got-shit!"""|"The Merchants' War"|"Charles Stross"

We're to take our guns, and we've got to be in Las Vegas by noon tomorrow, so we're going to be moving out right now. There's a private plane waiting for us near Richmond but we've got to get there first and it's going to take eight hours to get where we're going once we're airborne.
