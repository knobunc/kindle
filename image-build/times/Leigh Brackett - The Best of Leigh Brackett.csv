"< 00:00"|"Toward midnight"|"Toward midnight Broca roused. The fever had left him but he was morose and silent. He thrust Alor roughly aside and took the sweep and the Ethne gathered speed."|"The Best of Leigh Brackett"|"Leigh Brackett"
"ap 02:30"|"half-past two"|"The house was quiet, and nothing happened. The huge relic of a clock that stood on the stair landing chimed peacefully every fifteen minutes, and every hour it counted off the strokes in a deep, soft voice. I think the last time I heard it was half-past two. I didn’t mean to sleep. I had purposely drunk nothing but black coffee all evening. But I had been so long without sleep!"|"The Best of Leigh Brackett"|"Leigh Brackett"
12:00|noon|"He went to his doctor, who could find no sign of infection but gave him a shot on general principles. He went to his office, but it was only a gesture. He returned home at noon on a two-day sick leave. The temperature had crept up to ninety and the humidity dripped out of the air in sharp crashing showers."|"The Best of Leigh Brackett"|"Leigh Brackett"
00:00|midnight|"He slept downstairs that night, on the living-room couch. He had done that before during heat waves. It gave the illusion of being cooler. He dosed himself heavily with aspirin, and for a time he lapsed into a drugged slumber full of dark shapes that pursued him over a landscape he could not quite see but which he knew was alien and hateful. Then in the silent hours between midnight and dawn he started up in panic. He could not breathe. The air was as thick as water, and a weight as of mountain ranges lay along his chest, his thighs, his shoulders."|"The Best of Leigh Brackett"|"Leigh Brackett"
02:49|"two-forty-nine a.m."|"I dreamed Doc Callendar called me on the phone and said, “I’ve found him but you’ll have to hurry.” And I said, “But you’re dead. Don’t call me, Doc, please don’t.” But the phone kept ringing and ringing, and after a while I woke part way up and it really was ringing. It was two-forty-nine a.m."|"The Best of Leigh Brackett"|"Leigh Brackett"
"~ 17:00"|"about five o’clock that afternoon"|"I went home, but I didn’t sleep. Not right away. I told my assistant and right-hand man, Joe Streckfoos, that the paper was all his today, and then I got on the phone. I drove the local exchange crazy, but by about five o’clock that afternoon I had the information I wanted."|"The Best of Leigh Brackett"|"Leigh Brackett"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"I had started with a map of the area on my desk. Not just Newhale, but the whole area, with Buckhorn Mountain roughly at the center and showing the hills and valleys around its northern periphery. By five o’clock the map showed a series of red pencil dots. If you connected them together with a line they formed a sprawling, irregular, but unbroken circle drawn around Buckhorn, never exceeding a certain number of miles in distance from the peak."|"The Best of Leigh Brackett"|"Leigh Brackett"
"ap 11:30"|eleven-thirty|"The alarm woke me at eleven-thirty. I did not turn on any lamps. I don’t know why, except that I still had that naked feeling of being watched. Light enough came to me anyhow from the intermittent sulfurous flares in the sky. There was a low mutter of thunder in the west. I put the automatic in a shoulder holster under my shirt, not to hide it but because it was out of the way there. When I was dressed I went downstairs and out the back door, heading for the garage."|"The Best of Leigh Brackett"|"Leigh Brackett"
