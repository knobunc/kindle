This took half an hour, for the station is outside of the town. Then my uncle, after refreshing himself quickly, dragged me along with him. The porter at the hotel could speak German and English; but the professor, as a polyglot, questioned him in good Danish, and it was in the same language that this individual directed him to the Museum of Northern Antiquities."|"A Journey to the Center of the Earth"|"Jules Verne"

It was now four o’clock, and we had gone four miles.
In that place the fjord was at least half a mile wide; the waves broke noisily on the pointed rocks; this bay opened out between walls of rock, a sort of sharp-edged precipice 3,000 feet high, and remarkable for the brown layers which separated beds of reddish tuff. Whatever the intelligence of our horses might be, I hardly cared to put it to the test by crossing a real estuary on the back of quadruped."|"A Journey to the Center of the Earth"|"Jules Verne"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"That favorable moment arrived only at six o’clock; my uncle, myself, the guide, two ferrymen and the four horses had embarked on a somewhat fragile sort of raft. Accustomed as I was to the steamships on the Elbe, I found the oars of the rowers rather a dismal mechanical device. It took us more than an hour to cross the fjord; but the passage concluded without any mishap. A half hour later, we reached the aolkirkja of Gardär."|"A Journey to the Center of the Earth"|"Jules Verne"

My uncle settled with him. It was Hans’ own family, that is, his uncles and cousins, who offered us hospitality; we were kindly received, and without abusing the kindness of these good folks, I would very much have liked to recover from the exhaustion of the journey at their house. But my uncle, who needed no recovery, would not hear of it, and the next morning we had to mount our brave beasts again."|"A Journey to the Center of the Earth"|"Jules Verne"

But this farewell took the unexpected shape of a huge bill, in which we were charged even for the air in the parsonage—foul-smelling air, I might mention. This worthy couple was fleecing us just like a Swiss innkeeper, and estimated their exaggerated hospitality at a high price."|"A Journey to the Center of the Earth"|"Jules Verne"

Barometer: 29 7/12”.

Thermometer: 6°C.

Direction: E.S.E.This last observation applied to the dark tunnel, and was indicated by the compass."|"A Journey to the Center of the Earth"|"Jules Verne"
"ap 10:00"|10|"Yet there was no sensible increase in temperature. This justified Davy’s theory, and more than once I consulted the thermometer with surprise. Two hours after our departure it only showed 10°, an increase of only 4°. This was reason to believe that our descent was more horizontal than vertical. As for the exact depth we had reached, it was very easy to ascertain that; the professor measured the angles of deviation and inclination accurately on the road, but he kept the results of his observations to himself."|"A Journey to the Center of the Earth"|"Jules Verne"
"~ 20:00"|"about eight in the evening"|"At about eight in the evening he signaled to stop. Hans sat down at once. The lamps were hung on a projection in the lava; we were in a sort of cavern where there was no lack of air. On the contrary. Certain breezes reached us. What caused them? That was a question I did not try to answer at the moment. Hunger and exhaustion made me incapable of reasoning. A descent of seven consecutive hours is not accomplished without considerable expenditure of strength. I was exhausted. The word ‘stop’ therefore gave me pleasure. Hans spread some provisions out on a block of lava, and we ate with a good appetite. But one thing troubled me; our supply of water was half consumed. My uncle counted on a fresh supply from underground sources, but so there had been none. I could not help drawing his attention to this issue."|"A Journey to the Center of the Earth"|"Jules Verne"

12:17|"seventeen minutes past noon"|"We continued to follow the tunnel of lava, really a natural, gently sloping ramp like those inclined planes which are still found in old houses instead of staircases. And so we continued on until seventeen minutes past noon, the precise moment when we rejoined Hans, who had just stopped."|"A Journey to the Center of the Earth"|"Jules Verne"
18:00|"six in the evening"|"By six in the evening, after an undemanding walk, we had gone two leagues south, but scarcely a quarter of a mile down."|"A Journey to the Center of the Earth"|"Jules Verne"
"~ 10:00"|"about ten in the morning"|"We awoke the next morning refreshed and in good spirits. We resumed the road. As on the previous day, we followed a lava path. Impossible to identify the nature of the rock it passed through. The tunnel, instead of leading down into the bowels of the globe, gradually became absolutely horizontal. I even thought I noticed that it rose again toward the surface of the earth. This tendency became so obvious at about ten in the morning, and therefore so tiring, that I was forced to slow down our pace."|"A Journey to the Center of the Earth"|"Jules Verne"
12:00|noon|"At noon there was a change in the appearance of the tunnel walls. I noticed it through a decrease in the amount of light that was reflected from the sides. Solid rock was replacing the lava coating. The mass was made up of slanted and sometimes vertical strata. We were passing through rocks of the Transition or Silurian system."|"A Journey to the Center of the Earth"|"Jules Verne"
"ap 06:00"|six|"On Saturday, at six, we started afresh. In twenty minutes we reached a vast open space; I then knew that the hand of man could not have hollowed out this coal mine; the vaults would have been shored up, and really they seemed to be held up only by a miracle of equilibrium."|"A Journey to the Center of the Earth"|"Jules Verne"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"This excursion through the coal formation lasted until night. My uncle could scarcely restrain his impatience at the horizontal road. The darkness, always twenty steps ahead of us, prevented us from estimating the length of the tunnel; and I was beginning to think it must be endless, when suddenly at six o’clock a wall very unexpectedly arose before us. Right or left, top or bottom, there was no passage; we were at the end of a blind alley."|"A Journey to the Center of the Earth"|"Jules Verne"
10:00|"ten in the morning"|"At last, on Tuesday, July 7, we arrived half dead at the junction of the two tunnels by dragging ourselves on our knees, on our hands. There I dropped down like an inert mass, stretched out on the lava soil. It was ten in the morning."|"A Journey to the Center of the Earth"|"Jules Verne"
"ap ~ 06:00"|"about six o’clock"|"At about six o’clock this feast of light diminished appreciably, then almost ceased; the walls took on a crystalline but dark appearance; mica mingled more intimately with feldspar and quartz to form the essential rock, the hardest stone of all, the one that supports the four layered terrains of the globe. We were immured in an immense prison of granite."|"A Journey to the Center of the Earth"|"Jules Verne"
20:00|"eight in the evening"|"It was eight in the evening. There was still no water. I was suffering horribly. My uncle walked at the front. He refused to stop. He listened anxiously for the murmur of some spring. But nothing!"|"A Journey to the Center of the Earth"|"Jules Verne"
08:00|"eight in the morning"|"We resumed our walk on Thursday at eight in the morning. The granite tunnel meandered in sinuous contortions and confronted us with unexpected turns in what appeared to be the intricacies of a labyrinth; but, on the whole, its main direction was always southeast. My uncle constantly checked his compass to keep track of the ground we had covered."|"A Journey to the Center of the Earth"|"Jules Verne"
"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"On July 11 and 12, we kept following the spiral curves of this singular well, penetrating two more leagues into the earth’s crust, which added up to a depth of five leagues below sea level.

"< 12:00"|"Toward noon"|"Toward noon, immense algae could be seen floating at the surface of the water. I was aware of the vital power of these plants, which grow at a depth of over twelve thousand feet under the sea, reproduce under a pressure of four hundred atmospheres, and sometimes form barriers strong enough to impede the course of a ship; but there were never, I think, more gigantic algae than those in the Lidenbrock Sea."|"A Journey to the Center of the Earth"|"Jules Verne"
12:00|noon|"At noon Hans fastens a hook to the end of a line. He baits it with a small piece of meat and throws it into the sea. For two hours he catches nothing. Are these waters uninhabited, then? No. A pull on the line. Hans draws it in and lifts up a fish that struggles vigorously."|"A Journey to the Center of the Earth"|"Jules Verne"

20:00|"eight in the evening"|"At eight in the evening, we are less than two leagues away. Its blackish, enormous, mountainous body rests on the sea like an island. Is it imagination, is it fear? Its length seems to exceed a thousand fathoms! What can be this cetacean that neither Cuvier nor Blumenbach anticipated? It lies motionless, as if asleep; the sea seems unable to lift it, and the waves play on its sides. The fountain of water propelled to a height of five hundred feet falls back down in a rain with deafening noise. And here we speed like madmen toward this powerful mass that a hundred whales would not nourish even for a day!"|"A Journey to the Center of the Earth"|"Jules Verne"
10:00|"ten in the morning"|"At ten in the morning the symptoms of a storm become more pronounced; it seems as if the wind lets up only to catch its breath; the cloud bank resembles a huge goatskin in which hurricanes are building up."|"A Journey to the Center of the Earth"|"Jules Verne"
12:00|noon|"At noon the violence of the storm doubles. We must safely stow every piece of cargo. Each of us ties himself down as well. The waves rise above our heads."|"A Journey to the Center of the Earth"|"Jules Verne"
12:00|midday|"The shore had long disappeared behind the hills of bones. The rash professor, unconcerned about losing his way, took me along. We advanced in silence, bathed in electric waves. Due to some phenomenon that I cannot explain, and due to its by then complete diffusion, the light illuminated all the sides of an object equally. Its source no longer resided at a particular point in space and cast no shadows. One could have believed that it was midday in the middle of the summer, in the equatorial regions under the vertical rays of the sun. All steam had disappeared."|"A Journey to the Center of the Earth"|"Jules Verne"
"~ 18:00"|"about six in the evening"|"The wind was not well-suited for a kind of vessel that was unable to maneuver against it. So in many places we were forced to push ahead with the iron-tipped sticks. Often the rocks, lying just beneath the surface, forced us to take rather long detours. At last, after three hours’ sailing, that is to say at about six in the evening, we reached a place that was suitable for landing."|"A Journey to the Center of the Earth"|"Jules Verne"
