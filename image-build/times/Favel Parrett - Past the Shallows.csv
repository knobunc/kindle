"ap 11:00"|eleven|"Aunty Jean parked the car on the grass near the cenotaph. She wanted to see the wood chopping and it started at eleven. That
         meant they had forty minutes, so after finding the portable loos, Harry led them straight to the rides."|"Past the Shallows"|"Favel Parrett"
00:00|midnight|"Mr Roberts drove slowly, even on the straight bit of road. He kept a steady pace and his knees hugged the bottom of the steering
         wheel, his hands resting loose on top. The windows were tinted, just slightly, so that the grey sky seemed to be a midnight
         blue. Miles would have liked to keep on driving for a long time. To rest down against the warm seat and listen to Mr Roberts
         talk. To keep on going until there was no more road."|"Past the Shallows"|"Favel Parrett"
13:55|"1:55 pm"|"Aunty Jean put her knife and fork down on her plate and finally they were allowed to get up and take the dishes into the kitchen.
The clock above the cooker said it was 1:55 pm.
Miles filled the sink and started to wash the dishes. He squeezed the detergent hard, made the water slimy and full of suds.
         And he washed like mad, lining the dishes up neatly in the rack until it was full."|"Past the Shallows"|"Favel Parrett"
"ap 09:20"|9:20|"Harry got up. The clock in the kitchen said 9:20. God, he’d slept for ages, hadn’t even heard Miles get up and go."|"Past the Shallows"|"Favel Parrett"
"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"Miles and Harry had stayed out for as long as they could, stayed out past midnight until they were freezing, because Jeff and
         Dad had been drinking for two days. But now they were back in their room and Harry was busting for the loo."|"Past the Shallows"|"Favel Parrett"
"ap > 09:00"|"past nine"|"A girl with a round face and yellow hair leant against the wall of the rusty bus shelter next to the shop. Harry didn’t know
         her, hadn’t seen her before, but that didn’t mean anything. He hardly knew anyone. It was windy, but she only had bare legs,
         and they were blotchy and purple and her short skirt looked too tight. She rubbed at her legs with her chubby hands, all the
         while looking down the road. It was past nine. Maybe she’d missed the bus. Maybe the bus was late. There was only one. If
         you missed it, there wasn’t another."|"Past the Shallows"|"Favel Parrett"
