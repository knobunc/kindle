It was the background of his life, that distant, restless, implacable sound—on rare occasions soft, soothing and gentle, far more often angry, somber and harsh. It was somber tonight, and so was his mood as he listened. Three hours after final confirmation that he had won one of the great political victories of American history, he was as uneasy and uncertain as though he were a hunted soul instead of the next President of the United States.

Hasty crews had worked desperately all night to keep Pennsylvania Avenue open for the triumphal passage of the new President to the Hill, his return to the White House and the parade that would follow. For the sake of the parade their endeavors were necessary, but for the general public they need not have bothered. Not since Franklin Roosevelt’s first inaugural in March of 1933 had there been such a fervent outpouring as now was making its way to the Hill. No amount of snow, clogged roads, skidding cars, minor accidents, traffic jams was going to stop it. If streets were blocked, cars were locked and left and their occupants proceeded on foot. By 10 a.m. all the main arteries from Maryland were closed, all the bridges from Virginia were solid with abandoned cars. Vehicular traffic had come to a halt save for the police, Army, Secret Service and other official cars that skimmed nervously up and down Pennsylvania Avenue between White House and Capitol prior to the ceremony. Sometimes silent but more often singing, the believers in Edward Jason trudged toward the Capitol, happy and hopeful and greatly excited, in the cold clear sun."|"Come Nineveh, Come Tyre"|"Allen Drury"

At least a million anyway, said NBC, sounding slightly miffed. Probably five hundred thousand along the mile from White House to Hill, said UPI and AP, agreeing. Pushing five hundred thousand, conceded NBC and CBS. Well over, said ABC. In front of the Capitol, filling the temporary wooden stands, spilling out across the park, solid to the very steps of the Supreme Court a block away, at least another five hundred thousand, said everybody. And still they came, plowing through the trampled drifts, pushing in behind those already in place along the Avenue, breaking through police lines again and again—but happy. Always happy. Here and there a few wore the mailed-fist-superimposed-on-dove emblem of NAWAC, but even these were smiling and excited, if wary, on this wonderful day. Even they for once seemed happy. Nothing but good was expected by this crowd, and nothing but good, it seemed to those trained observers who watched it with microphone or pencil along the line of march and before the East Front of the Capitol, could be expected from it."|"Come Nineveh, Come Tyre"|"Allen Drury"

A vast shout of pleasure and anticipation echoed from White House to Hill; and for the next ten minutes, while the cavalcade rolled slowly out the gate, turned right on Pennsylvania, made the jog down past Treasury and then turned left and proceeded to the Hill, the roar never stopped, but only grew in its wild, ecstatic, animal intensity."|"Come Nineveh, Come Tyre"|"Allen Drury"

His had been a risky and supremely lonely course in the desperate days since inaugural; and so, too, had it been a risky and supremely lonely life. Val had come closest in that period, but even their amicable nightcap in the solarium after midnight had ended in a moody silence as both had stared out across the Ellipse at the Washington Monument and the muted gleam of the Potomac.

Its identical companion, House of Representatives 1776, was introduced a few minutes later by youthful Representative Bronson Bernard of New York. They referred to it in their brief joint statement as “the Help America Act.” The media instantly picked up the phrase, which was handy, colloquial, had immediate recognition value, and looked and fitted well in headlines. By nightfall opponents led by ex-President William Abbott, ex-Senate Majority Leader Robert D. Munson and Minority Leader Warren Strickland had begun to call it “the dictatorship bill.” But the positive emphasis of the words “Help America,” with their appeal to patriotism in a deeply troubled time, had already given it a substantial advantage in the public mind. This advantage, however, did not extend to a great many thoughtful citizens. Thus the stage was set for a tense and extraordinarily bitter debate."|"Come Nineveh, Come Tyre"|"Allen Drury"

Anyway, after this exchange of pleasantries, Tashikov abruptly dismissed his men and indicated with a gesture I can only describe as arrogant, impatient and unpleasant, that the President do the same. The President started to protest but Tashikov looked around with an elaborately sarcastic air at the empty seats on his side of the table and then gave the President a deliberately insolent stare. So after a moment the President gave in. I suppose you could say Tashikov shamed him into it, but there really wasn’t much he could have done, under the circumstances. So we left them alone and were shown back to our quarters. Four hours later we were awakened and told to be ready for departure at 9 a.m. He remained in his cabin for the entire trip and did not speak to any of us. We barely spoke to one another.

We’re working on it. I’ve got Hal Knox and a few other old and new hands helping me here, and Bob Munson and Warren are hard at work over there.
