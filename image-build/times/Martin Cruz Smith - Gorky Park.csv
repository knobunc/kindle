"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"Arkady took Fet’s buff-and-red militia car and drove off, crossing the Krimsky Bridge to the north side of the city. The frozen river ached, ready to break. It was nine o’clock, two hours since he’d been roused from bed, no breakfast yet, just cigarettes. Coming off the bridge, he waved his red ID at the militiaman directing traffic, and sped through stopped cars. A privilege of rank."|"Gorky Park"|"Martin Cruz Smith"
"ap 04:20"|Four-twenty|"“Colonel, I—” he got to say before he was disconnected. He dialed again. There was no answer at Kiselny Street. He looked at his watch. Four-twenty: time for the operators to shut down the board in preparation for leaving work at five. The detectives would want to go soon, too. Pasha to lift weights. Fet? Home to mother, or Pribluda first?"|"Gorky Park"|"Martin Cruz Smith"

"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"By regulations, Arkady should have returned the car to the office lot. He drove home. It was after midnight when he rolled into a courtyard off Taganskaya on the east side of town. Rough wooden balconies stood out from the second floor. His apartment was dark. Arkady let himself in the communal entrance, climbed the stairs and unlocked his door as quietly as he could."|"Gorky Park"|"Martin Cruz Smith"
00:00|midnight|"By midnight, everyone had returned and everyone was drunk. There was a buffet of cold pork and sausages, fish, blini, cheeses and breads, pickled mushrooms, even pressed caviar. Someone was shouting poetry. At the other end of the room couples hopped to a Hungarian version of the Bee Gees. Misha was stricken with guilt and couldn’t keep his eyes off Zoya sitting close to Schmidt."|"Gorky Park"|"Martin Cruz Smith"
"~ 00:00"|"Around midnight"|"Around midnight he remembered Pasha’s note. On the detective’s table was a report clipped to the dossier of a German national called Unmann. Arkady leafed through it with red eyes."|"Gorky Park"|"Martin Cruz Smith"
06:00|"6 A.M."|"At 6 A.M. inside Kazan Station, entire Turkman families lay head to feet on benches. Babies with felt skullcaps nestled on soft bundles. Soldiers leaned slackly against the wall in a sleep so tangibly deep that the heroic mosaics of the ceiling overhead could have been their communal dream. Bronze fixtures glowed fully. At the one refreshment stand open, a girl in a rabbit-skin coat confided in Pasha Pavlovich."|"Gorky Park"|"Martin Cruz Smith"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"“A few years ago, an American tourist was visiting the village he was born in about two hundred kilometers from Moscow when he dropped dead. It was summer and the local people didn’t want to be disrespectful, so they stuck him in the refrigerator. You know these villages, they have only one refrigerator. They called here, and the people in the Foreign Ministry told them to do nothing more until they received special forms for the death of tourists. A couple of days go by, no forms. A week, no forms. These forms take time to organize. Two weeks went by, and the villagers got fed up with the tourist in the refrigerator. It was summer, after all. Milk was spoiling, and there was only so much they could fit on the American’s lap. Well, you know villagers—one night they got drunk, threw the body in a truck, drove all the way to Moscow, dumped the body in your lobby, jumped back in their truck and drove off. This is a true story. The commotion here was unbelievable. There was a ring of KGB officers around the body. At three in the morning they called an American attaché from the embassy. The poor bastard thought he was going to have a private word with Gromyko, and instead here’s this body. He wouldn’t touch it—not without the right forms. Still no one could find the right forms. Someone suggested there were no such forms, and that set off a panic. Nobody wanted this American. Maybe they should just lose him, someone else suggested. Take him back to the village, bury him in Gorky Park, give him a job in the ministry. Finally, they called in me and the head pathologist. It turned out we had the right form, and we threw the American tourist in the trunk of the attaché’s car. That was the last time I was in this building.”"|"Gorky Park"|"Martin Cruz Smith"

04:00|"four in the morning"|"There was no doubt that Nikitin had been a brilliant chief investigator of Homicide. Though Arkady would build the case, it was always Nikitin who came into the interrogation room with two bottles and a leer, to emerge hours later with a pliant, shamefaced killer. “Confession is all,” Nikitin explained. “If you won’t give people religion or psychology, at least let them confess to a crime. Proust said that you could seduce any woman if you were willing to sit and listen to her complain until four in the morning. At heart, any murderer is a complainer.” “For the bribes, boychik,” Nikitin explained when Arkady asked why he transferred from Homicide to Government Liaison."|"Gorky Park"|"Martin Cruz Smith"
"ap 00:30"|twelve-thirty|"In the garage, Arkady ran to his car and swung onto Petrovka Street, one-way south. There was little traffic. Assuming that she had called Osborne, Arkady thought, then it was at her initiative, even insistence. A minute was more time than needed to merely state a meeting place; she’d demanded one. Where? Not in Osborne’s room, and not someplace where he would seem out of place and conspicuous. Not in a car—that could catch the eye of a militiaman, and if not in a car, then Osborne wouldn’t be driving her home. Public transportation stopped at twelve-thirty. Arkady’s watch said twelve-ten. The truth was, he didn’t know if they were meeting, or where or when. He could only try the obvious."|"Gorky Park"|"Martin Cruz Smith"

"ap 02:56"|2:56|"At the end of the passage, low arches led to a passenger platform. A train was just pulling out, strangers behind steel and glass, the old folks and veterans slipping into the seats provided for them, lovers daring to sway together, becoming a blur, a whiptail, then two red lights in the tunnel. Arkady didn’t think she was on the train, but he couldn’t be sure. Over the track the light-bulb numerals of a large digital clock changed from 2:56 to 0:00 and started to count up again. During rush hour, trains were never more than a minute apart, so that there was always a hushed, insistent trembling in the tunnels, and at night, even toward the end of service, no train was more than three minutes after the previous one. Platform conductors, sturdy grandmothers in blue uniforms, metal flags in their hands, made the rounds of the benches and whispered to reluctant lovers, “Last train coming … last train.” Arkady asked about a tall, young, good-looking woman with long brown hair, and the conductor, misunderstanding, shook her head sympathetically. He darted across the passage to the opposite platform for trains in the other direction. The passengers there were a mirror of the ones he’d left, except for the Mongolian soldiers, who sat on their suitcase like a pair of prize dolls waiting to be won."|"Gorky Park"|"Martin Cruz Smith"

"ap 02:27"|2:27|"Arkady took two hits on his arm and felt a warm numbness from the elbow down. He had learned from Kirwill in Gorky Park, though. As the other man drew back to bring a blow directly to the soft fontanel in the center of the skull, Arkady savagely brought his foot up to that larger, softer area between the legs. The man folded like a chair and dropped his weapon. Arkady gathered it up and swung in one motion, snapping the man’s head back. The man sat down on the catwalk, one hand over his groin, one hand catching the dark burst of blood from his nose. Arkady looked down the tunnel to the far-off platform clock, surprised he could see it so distinctly. 2:27."|"Gorky Park"|"Martin Cruz Smith"

He felt a wind, air-propelled ahead of the train, and the rails’ moan."|"Gorky Park"|"Martin Cruz Smith"

At 4 A.M., he went down to his car, drove it around the block to find if he was being watched, and returned to Levin’s apartment. He couldn’t wait any longer. He dressed Irina in her damp clothes, wrapped her in a blanket and carried her down. Driving, the only people he saw were road crews “storming” for May Day. A single man on a steamroller directed four women pouring warm tar. When he had crossed the river and was within two blocks of Taganskaya, he got out, walked alone the rest of the way to his apartment, and went through every room to be sure it was empty. Returning to the car, he drove to the apartment, switching his engine and headlights off as he turned into the courtyard. He carried Irina upstairs, laying her on the bed, undressing her and covering her with Levin’s blanket and his own overcoat."|"Gorky Park"|"Martin Cruz Smith"
09:00|"9 A.M."|"Irina Asanova lay facing him, her skin as wan as ivory now that her fever was broken. He was still in his clothes. At first he’d tried to find some other place to curl up, but there were no chairs or sofa, not even a rug, and in the end they’d shared the bed. Not that she’d known or that it mattered. He lifted his watch. 9 A.M. Slowly, so as not to wake her, he rose and walked in stockinged feet to the side of a window and looked down into the courtyard. No face looked up. He’d have to move her, but he didn’t know where. Not her place. Hotels were out of the question; it was illegal to take a hotel room in your own city. (What good reason could a citizen have for not being home?) Something would turn up."|"Gorky Park"|"Martin Cruz Smith"

I did it and I’m glad.’ He wouldn’t be extradited. With any decent American lawyer the case would drag on for five years. It takes twenty years to get a Nazi war criminal out of here. Say, five years for the first trial, another five years for an appeal. In the end he could still go to the federal appeals and buy a mistrial. Win or lose, that’s fifteen years. Sables fuck; they don’t fuck like minks but they fuck, and in fifteen years the Russian sable monopoly will be ancient history. That’s fifty million dollars in foreign exchange. So forget extradition. The other two choices are killing Osborne and stealing the sables back, or else dealing. The bureau is protecting Osborne, and the Russians don’t know where the sables are, so they’ll deal. Look, give the man credit. Osborne pissed on the KGB, he pissed on them and then he shook it. The man’s a fucking American hero. What are you, some fucking Russian subversive? But I’m going to help you, Renko.”"|"Gorky Park"|"Martin Cruz Smith"
