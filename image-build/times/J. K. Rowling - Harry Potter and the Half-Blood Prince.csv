00:00|midnight|"It was nearing midnight and the Prime Minister was sitting alone in his office, reading a long memo that was slipping through his brain without leaving the slightest trace of meaning behind. He was waiting for a call from the President of a far distant country, and between wondering when the wretched man would telephone, and trying to suppress unpleasant memories of what had been a very long, tiring, and difficult week, there was not much space in his head for anything else. The more he attempted to focus on the print on the page before him, the more clearly the Prime Minister could see the gloating face of one of his political opponents. This particular opponent had appeared on the news that very day, not only to enumerate all the terrible things that had happened in the last week (as though anyone needed reminding) but also to explain why each and every one of them was the government’s fault."|"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 10:59"|"one minute to eleven"|"Harry grunted in his sleep and his face slid down the window an inch or so, making his glasses still more lopsided, but he did not wake up. An alarm clock, repaired by Harry several years ago, ticked loudly on the sill, showing one minute to eleven. Beside it, held in place by Harry’s relaxed hand, was a piece of parchment covered in thin, slanting writing. Harry had read this letter so often since its arrival three days ago that although it had been delivered in a tightly furled scroll, it now lay quite flat."|"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"|"J. K. Rowling"
23:00|"eleven p.m."|"If it is convenient to you, I shall call at number four, Privet Drive this coming Friday at eleven p.m. to escort you to the Burrow, where you have been invited to spend the remainder of your school holidays."|"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"|"J. K. Rowling"
19:00|"seven o’clock that evening"|"Though he already knew it by heart, Harry had been stealing glances at this missive every few minutes since seven o’clock that evening, when he had first taken up his position beside his bedroom window, which had a reasonable view of both ends of Privet Drive. He knew it was pointless to keep rereading Dumbledore’s words; Harry had sent back his “yes” with the delivering owl, as requested, and all he could do now was wait: Either Dumbledore was going to come, or he was not."|"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"|"J. K. Rowling"
"< 00:00"|"almost midnight"|"He set off at a brisk pace, past an empty inn and a few houses. According to a clock on a nearby church, it was almost midnight."|"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"|"J. K. Rowling"
00:00|midnight|"The church clock chimed midnight behind them. Harry wondered why Dumbledore did not consider it rude to call on his old colleague so late, but now that conversation had been established, he had more pressing questions to ask."|"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"|"J. K. Rowling"
"~ 00:00"|"around midnight"|"“Yes, he is. As a matter of fact, he’s a tiny bit late. … He said he’d be back around midnight. …”"|"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"|"J. K. Rowling"
"~ 01:00"|"About one o’clock this morning"|"“Not bad,” said Ron, pulling over a cardboard box and sitting on it. “When did you get here? Mum’s only just told us!”
“About one o’clock this morning.”
“Were the Muggles all right? Did they treat you okay?”"|"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"|"J. K. Rowling"
20:00|"8 p.m."|"I would like to start our private lessons this Saturday. Kindly come along to my office at 8 p.m. I hope you are enjoying your first day back at school."|"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 07:55"|"five to eight"|"Harry looked at his watch and hurriedly put the old copy of Advanced Potion-Making back into his bag.
“It’s five to eight, I’d better go, I’ll be late for Dumbledore.”
“Ooooh!” gasped Hermione, looking up at once. “Good luck! We’ll wait up, we want to hear what he teaches you!”"|"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 08:30"|"half past eight"|"“No … from Professor Snape,” said Demelza. Harry’s heart sank. “He says you’re to come to his office at half past eight tonight to do your detention — er — no matter how many party invitations you’ve received. And he wanted you to know you’ll be sorting out rotten flobberworms from good ones, to use in Potions and — and he says there’s no need to bring protective gloves.”"|"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"Harry had wondered whether Dumbledore would return from wherever he had been in time for Monday night’s lesson, but having had no word to the contrary, he presented himself outside Dumbledore’s office at eight o’clock, knocked, and was told to enter. There sat Dumbledore looking unusually tired; his hand was as black and burned as ever, but he smiled when he gestured to Harry to sit down. The Pensieve was sitting on the desk again, casting silvery specks of light over the ceiling."|"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"“Well then, you’re in,” said Harry. “There’s a practice tonight, seven o’clock.”"|"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"|"J. K. Rowling"
12:00|midday|"Harry awoke next morning feeling slightly dazed and confused by a series of dreams in which Ron had chased him with a Beater’s bat, but by midday he would have happily exchanged the dream Ron for the real one, who was not only cold-shouldering Ginny and Dean, but also treating a hurt and bewildered Hermione with an icy, sneering indifference. What was more, Ron seemed to have become, overnight, as touchy and ready to lash out as the average Blast-Ended Skrewt. Harry spent the day attempting to keep the peace between Ron and Hermione with no success; finally, Hermione departed for bed in high dudgeon, and Ron stalked off to the boys’ dormitory after swearing angrily at several frightened first years for looking at him."|"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"|"J. K. Rowling"
19:00|"seven o’clock in the evening"|"“Well, good night, Harry,” said Hermione, though it was only seven o’clock in the evening, and she left for the girls’ dormitory without another word."|"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"“No,” said Harry firmly, “that was a mistake. I’ll get Hermione to put it right for me. So, I’ll meet you in the entrance hall at eight o’clock then.”"|"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"“No invite,” said Parvati gloomily. “I’d love to go, though, it sounds like it’s going to be really good. … You’re going, aren’t you?”
“Yes, I’m meeting Cormac at eight, and we’re —”
There was a noise like a plunger being withdrawn from a blocked sink and Ron surfaced. Hermione acted as though she had not seen or heard anything."|"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"|"J. K. Rowling"
20:00|"eight o’clock that night"|"When he arrived in the entrance hall at eight o’clock that night, he found an unusually large number of girls lurking there, all of whom seemed to be staring at him resentfully as he approached Luna. She was wearing a set of spangled silver robes that were attracting a certain amount of giggles from the onlookers, but otherwise she looked quite nice. Harry was glad, in any case, that she had left off her radish earrings, her butterbeer cork necklace, and her Spectrespecs."|"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"|"J. K. Rowling"
00:00|midnight|"Everybody was wearing new sweaters when they all sat down for Christmas lunch, everyone except Fleur (on whom, it appeared, Mrs. Weasley had not wanted to waste one) and Mrs. Weasley herself, who was sporting a brand-new midnight blue witch’s hat glittering with what looked like tiny starlike diamonds, and a spectacular golden necklace."|"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"|"J. K. Rowling"
19:50|"ten to eight that evening"|"“Whoa!” whispered Seamus, and he, Dean, and Neville put their heads a little closer to hear what Apparition felt like. For the rest of the day, Harry was besieged with requests from the other sixth years to describe the sensation of Apparition. All of them seemed awed, rather than put off, when he told them how uncomfortable it was, and he was still answering detailed questions at ten to eight that evening, when he was forced to lie and say that he needed to return a book to the library, so as to escape in time for his lesson with Dumbledore."|"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"The fog cleared as suddenly as it had appeared and yet nobody made any allusion to it, nor did anybody look as though anything unusual had just happened. Bewildered, Harry looked around as a small golden clock standing upon Slughorn’s desk chimed eleven o’clock."|"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"It was evening; the hospital wing was quiet, the windows curtained, the lamps lit. Ron’s was the only occupied bed. Harry, Hermione, and Ginny were sitting around him; they had spent all day waiting outside the double doors, trying to see inside whenever somebody went in or out. Madam Pomfrey had only let them enter at eight o’clock. Fred and George had arrived at ten past."|"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"|"J. K. Rowling"
00:00|midnight|"“I never said tha’,” said Hagrid, though his look of panic could not have been a bigger giveaway. “Look at the time, it’s gettin’ on fer midnight, I need ter —”"|"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap < 08:00"|"nearly eight o’clock"|"“Thanks a lot, Hermione,” said Harry, giving her a hasty pat on the back as he checked his watch and saw that it was nearly eight o’clock. “Listen, I’ve got to hurry or I’ll be late for Dumbledore. …”"|"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"She did not answer, but merely crossed out a few of his feebler sentences in a weary sort of way. Grinning, Harry hurried out through the portrait hole and off to the headmaster’s office. The gargoyle leapt aside at the mention of toffee éclairs, and Harry took the spiral staircase two steps at a time, knocking on the door just as a clock within chimed eight."|"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 04:00"|four|"“Hurry up, Hokey!” said Hepzibah imperiously. “He said he’d come at four, it’s only a couple of minutes to and he’s never been late yet!”"|"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"|"J. K. Rowling"
00:00|midnight|"“Well, the password changed at midnight, so you’ll just have to sleep in the corridor, won’t you?”"|"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"|"J. K. Rowling"
00:00|midnight|"“Well, the password changed at midnight, so you’ll just have to sleep in the corridor, won’t you?”
“You’re joking!” said Harry. “Why did it have to change at midnight?”
“That’s the way it is,” said the Fat Lady. “If you’re angry, go and take it up with the headmaster, he’s the one who’s tightened security.”"|"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"The small golden clock standing upon Slughorn’s desk chimed eleven o’clock behind him and he looked around."|"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 10:00"|"Ten o’clock"|"“Well, we shall see how you feel after your detentions,” said Snape. “Ten o’clock Saturday morning, Potter. My office.”"|"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 10:00"|"Ten o’clock"|"“Ten o’clock,” whispered Snape, with a smile that showed his yellow teeth. “Poor Gryffindor … fourth place this year, I fear …”"|"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 00:30"|"half past twelve"|"Harry’s stomach started rumbling when the clock showed half past twelve. Snape, who had not spoken at all since setting Harry his task, finally looked up at ten past one."|"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 01:10"|"ten past one"|"Harry’s stomach started rumbling when the clock showed half past twelve. Snape, who had not spoken at all since setting Harry his task, finally looked up at ten past one."|"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"“I think that will do,” he said coldly. “Mark the place you have reached. You will continue at ten o’clock next Saturday.”"|"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"|"J. K. Rowling"
"< 00:00"|"nearly midnight"|"“Outside Snape’s office, yes,” whispered Hermione, her eyes sparkling with tears, “with Luna. We hung around for ages outside it and nothing happened. … We didn’t know what was going on upstairs, Ron had taken the map. … It was nearly midnight when Professor Flitwick came sprinting down into the dungeons. He was shouting about Death Eaters in the castle, I don’t think he really registered that Luna and I were there at all, he just burst his way into Snape’s office and we heard him saying that Snape had to go back with him and help and then we heard a loud thump and Snape came hurtling out of his room and he saw us and — and —”"|"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"|"J.
