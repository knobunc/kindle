00:00|midnight|"Speaking of German, Wannier was scheduled to go to Germany for a six-month period in the fall of 1974, and since I had always loved Europe, I asked if there was any way I could go along. Very kindly, he arranged for me to be a wissenschaftlicher Assistent — essentially a teaching assistant — in physics at the Universitat Regensburg, and so that's what I did for one semester spanning the end of 1974 and the start of 1975. It was then that I got most of the work done for my Ph.D. thesis. Since I had no close friends, my Regensburg days and nights were long and lonely. In a peculiar sense, my closest friend during that tough period was Frederic Chopin, since I tuned in to Radio Warsaw nearly every night at midnight and listened to various pianists playing many of his pieces that I knew and loved, and others that were new to me and that I came to love."|"Godel, Escher, Bach"|"Douglas R.

"ap ~ 00:50"|"about ten to one"|"The most important cells in the brain are nerve cells, or neurons (see Fig. 65), of which there are about ten billion. (Curiously, outnumbering the neurons by about ten to one are the glial cells, or glia. Glia are believed to play more of a supporting role to the neurons' starring role, and therefore we will not discuss them.) Each neuron possesses a number of synapses (""entry ports"") and one axon (""output channel""). The input and output are electrochemical flows: that is, moving ions. In between the entry ports of a neuron and its output channel is its cell body, where ""decisions"" are made."|"Godel, Escher, Bach"|"Douglas R. Hofstadter"
"ap 02:00"|2|"Notice that I have called two procedures inside this algorithm: MINUS and REMAINDER. (The latter is presumed to have been previously defined, and you may work out its definition yourself.) Now this test for primality works by trying out potential factors of N one by one, starting at 2 and increasing to a maximum of N—1. In case any of them divides N exactly (i.e., gives remainder 0), then we jump down to the bottom, and since OUTPUT still has its default value at this stage, the answer is NO. Only if N has no exact divisors will it survive the entirety of LOOP 1; then we will emerge smoothly at the statement OUTPUT 4= YES, which will get executed, and then the procedure is over."|"Godel, Escher, Bach"|"Douglas R. Hofstadter"
"ap 02:00"|two|"The idea I adopted was to classify each word—noun, verb, preposition, etc.—in several different ""semantic dimensions"". Thus, each word was a member of classes of various sorts; then there were also superclasses— classes of classes (reminiscent of the remark by Ulam). In principle, such aggregation could continue to any number of levels, but I stopped at two. At any given moment, the choice of words was now semantically restricted, because it was required that there should be agreement between the various parts of the phrase being constructed. The idea was, for instance, that certain kinds of acts could be performed only by animate objects; that only certain kinds of abstractions could influence events, and so on. The decisions about what categories were reasonable, and whether each category was better thought of as a class or a superclass, were quite complicated. All words were branded in several different dimensions. Common prepositions—""of"", ""in"", etc.—had several distinct entries, corresponding to their distinct usages. Now, the output began to be much more comprehensible—and for that reason it was funny in a new way."|"Godel, Escher, Bach"|"Douglas R. Hofstadter"
