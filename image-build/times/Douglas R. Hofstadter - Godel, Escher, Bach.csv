Very kindly, he arranged for me to be a wissenschaftlicher Assistent — essentially a teaching assistant — in physics at the Universitat Regensburg, and so that's what I did for one semester spanning the end of 1974 and the start of 1975. It was then that I got most of the work done for my Ph.D. thesis. Since I had no close friends, my Regensburg days and nights were long and lonely. In a peculiar sense, my closest friend during that tough period was Frederic Chopin, since I tuned in to Radio Warsaw nearly every night at midnight and listened to various pianists playing many of his pieces that I knew and loved, and others that were new to me and that I came to love."|"Godel, Escher, Bach"|"Douglas R.

"ap 01:00"|one|"There is something very significant about what has happened here. It shows one difference between people and machines. It would certainly be possible—in fact it would be very easy—to program a computer to generate theorem after theorem of the MlU-system; and we could include in the program a command to stop only upon generating U. You now know that a computer so programmed would never stop. And this does not amaze you. But what if you asked a friend to try to generate U? It would not surprise you if he came back after a while, complaining that he can't get rid of the initial M, and therefore it is a wild goose chase. Even if a person is not very bright, he still cannot help making some observations about what he is doing, and these observations give him good insight into the task—insight which the computer program, as we have described it, lacks."|"Godel, Escher, Bach"|"Douglas R.

(Curiously, outnumbering the neurons by about ten to one are the glial cells, or glia. Glia are believed to play more of a supporting role to the neurons' starring role, and therefore we will not discuss them.) Each neuron possesses a number of synapses (""entry ports"") and one axon (""output channel""). The input and output are electrochemical flows: that is, moving ions. In between the entry ports of a neuron and its output channel is its cell body, where ""decisions"" are made."|"Godel, Escher, Bach"|"Douglas R. Hofstadter"
"ap 02:00"|2|"Notice that I have called two procedures inside this algorithm: MINUS and REMAINDER. (The latter is presumed to have been previously defined, and you may work out its definition yourself.) Now this test for primality works by trying out potential factors of N one by one, starting at 2 and increasing to a maximum of N—1. In case any of them divides N exactly (i.e., gives remainder 0), then we jump down to the bottom, and since OUTPUT still has its default value at this stage, the answer is NO. Only if N has no exact divisors will it survive the entirety of LOOP 1; then we will emerge smoothly at the statement OUTPUT 4= YES, which will get executed, and then the procedure is over."|"Godel, Escher, Bach"|"Douglas R.
