I thought it was only strike one.”"|"War of Honor"|"David Weber"

"ap 00:54"|"six of one"|"“Um.” McKeon frowned. “I understand what you’re saying, but I think it’s a bit of six of one, half a dozen of another. We’re not getting any support or guidance, but they’re not screwing the situation up still worse, either.”"|"War of Honor"|"David Weber"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"“Yes, Sir. In fact, they pretty much suck, and they’re getting worse. Particle count is way up, and that grav eddy at three o’clock is funneling them straight over us.”"|"War of Honor"|"David Weber"

There was no one on his schedule this afternoon until his meeting at four o’clock with Simon Chakrabarti, and the yeoman knew it.

"ap < 00:57"|"almost three-to-one"|"“You’re right,” Stevens agreed, but his eyes drifted back to the display and the oncoming icons of eight superdreadnoughts. Assuming what the sensor platforms were seeing was what was really there, Rear Admiral Sir Ronald Maitland’s short superdreadnought division was outnumbered by almost three-to-one. “I just wish we had an SD(P) or two to even things up.”"|"War of Honor"|"David Weber"
"ap < 10:00"|"almost ten"|"Twelve more minutes passed. Second Fleet’s base velocity rose to just over 28,530 KPS and Task Force 34’s velocity reached 19,600 KPS. The range continued to fall, gnawed away by a closing velocity of almost sixteen percent of light-speed. It dropped from fifty-three million kilometers to barely thirty-seven and a half million, and then HMS Werewolf transmitted a brief FTL message to HMS Borderer. The destroyer, almost ten full light-minutes outside the system hyper limit received the transmission, acknowledged receipt, and translated up into hyper … where it sent a second transmission."|"War of Honor"|"David Weber"
