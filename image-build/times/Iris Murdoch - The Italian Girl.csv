00:00|midnight|"I pressed the door gently. It had always been left open at night in the old days. When I became quite certain that it was locked, I stepped back into the moonlight and looked up at the house. Although it was barely midnight, there was not a light showing. They were all abed and asleep. I felt a resentment against them. I had expected a vigil, for her, and for me."|"The Italian Girl"|"Iris Murdoch"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"‘A hot-water bottle in the bed? How kind of you, Maggie. No, not a meal, I’ve eaten, thank you. Just bed. It’s at eleven tomorrow, isn’t it? Thank you, good night.’ With this came to me some old comforting breath of childhood; warm beds, prompt meals, clean linen: these things the Italian girl had provided."|"The Italian Girl"|"Iris Murdoch"
"~ 17:00"|"about five o’clock in the evening"|"It was about five o’clock in the evening, a time which always finds me fretful and restless. I had a permanent pain of worry about Flora. And I had not yet recovered from the shock which Isabel had given me, a shock now oddly separated from Isabel herself as if a demon had emanated from her which teased me still. I stretched my legs out and contemplated at the other end of the table a heap of cherry-red silk which Maggie had been sewing, presumably a dress for Isabel. Like a true house-serf the Italian girl had always made clothes for Isabel and Lydia. Lydia’s old beautiful gipsy robes, the garments which my dear father had inspired and which he so much loved to see her wear, had all been made by Maggie: or perhaps by Giulia or Vittoria or Gemma or Carlotta."|"The Italian Girl"|"Iris Murdoch"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"‘Well,’ I said, looking at my watch again, ‘if you’ll excuse me, and if I can get hold of Otto now, I’ll catch the five o’clock train.’"|"The Italian Girl"|"Iris Murdoch"
"ap 08:00"|"Eight o’clock"|"She looked at me more hopefully. We began to move back toward the glossy arches of the camellias. ‘Thank you, Edmund. I think I’ll go and lie down now. I’m glad I told you. I won’t see you till tomorrow and I’ll try and think about it all. Come and see me early in the morning will you? Come and have breakfast in my room. Eight o’clock. I always have breakfast there. What do you eat for breakfast?’"|"The Italian Girl"|"Iris Murdoch"
"ap > 10:00"|"after ten o’clock"|"We had now reached the edge of the garden and I turned from him quickly across the lawn. The sun had dried the dew. The worms were gone. I felt disturbed, exhilarated. I wanted to think about what had happened to me. Yet of course it was no business of mine. I did not belong here, I was going away soon, perhaps that very day – and with that I suddenly remembered Flora. I looked at my watch and could hardly believe my eyes. It was after ten o’clock. I began to run towards the house."|"The Italian Girl"|"Iris Murdoch"
"ap < 10:00"|"just before ten"|"I looked up and saw someone looking at me. ‘Oh, Maggie – she’s gone. You say she looked for me everywhere? The bus, just before ten, of course.’"|"The Italian Girl"|"Iris Murdoch"
"ap ~ 05:00"|"about five o’clock"|"It was then that I decided I must speak to Otto about last night. The brother and the sister would probably have told him of my apparition. But I felt that I must, if I was in any honesty to remain, have it out with him myself. I decided this in some trepidation, for I knew how sudden and how violent Otto’s rages could be. I had of course no intention of telling him anything about Flora. I could not even decide to speak of that to Isabel. I kept wandering about and visiting the workshop until Otto appeared there, very dishevelled, about five o’clock. I conjectured how he had spent the afternoon. I found that I could not help being curious, though I disliked the curiosity and hoped it would not be too evident to him."|"The Italian Girl"|"Iris Murdoch"
