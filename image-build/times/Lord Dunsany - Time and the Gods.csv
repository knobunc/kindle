all the cattle die, go up unheeded to the heedless clouds, and if
somewhere there be those that garner prayer let us send men to seek
them and to say: 'There be men in the Isles called Three, or
sometimes named by sailors the Prosperous Isles (and they be in the
Central Sea), who ofttimes pray, and it hath been told us that ye
love the worship of men, and for it answer prayer, and we be
travellers from the Islands Three.'"""|"Time and the Gods"|"Lord Dunsany"
