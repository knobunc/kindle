12:00|Noon|"Noon came. Regulus was led by Sham’s stall on his way to the Round Course. Agba heard the saddling bell. He heard the winding of the trumpet. He heard the cry as if from a thousand throats, “They’re away!” Then the quickening music of hoofbeats. A few brief seconds, and they began fading, growing fainter and fainter until they were gone."|"King of the Wind"|"Marguerite Henry"
