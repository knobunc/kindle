"> 12:00"|"Shortly after midday"|"“There is. Shortly after midday gong the guards took the off-worlder, Krip Vorlund, to answer the claims of Othelm, the beast dealer. And the party were set upon by mounted men from beyond the boundary. When the skirmish was over the off-worlder was gone. It is believed that he is back with his kin, and the chief priest has ordered their trade booth closed and the Traders to remove themselves.”"|"Moon of Three Rings"|"Andre Norton"
"> 12:00"|"after midday"|"We forded the river, meeting with none other on the outward road from Yrjar than some belated fairgoers. And to the greetings of these I replied as one who had cares, twice saying that illness among my beasts drove me to this departure. But after midday I turned from the open road into a side trail which still led eastward, lest some passer-by would begin to wonder why I needs must go so far in my search for peace and quiet for my ill ones."|"Moon of Three Rings"|"Andre Norton"
"ap 02:00"|two|"Stand up—1 wanted to stand up. I wavered, staggered. To rise to four feet was not the same as standing upon two. I lifted my head. Scents, my nose drowned in scents; so thickly did they assault my nostrils that it was as if all possible odors had been sprayed into one ship’s cabin and I was locked therein. I choked, thought that I could not breathe. But I did and the scents began to carry messages which I only partially understood. I tried to creep as a man would go on all fours, and tottered a step or two. The animal that had licked my head shouldered against me in support until I managed to stand without wavering. To look about me from this new angle was another thing to be learned, and I had by no means mastered it when there was a disturbance behind me."|"Moon of Three Rings"|"Andre Norton"
12:00|midday|"“I will. Now let us consider what lies before us, not what may exist behind a mountain range or two. By midday we shall arrive at Yim-Sin, the road to it lies there—” We were coming down a bank to a road into which the kasi turned, heading upward from the plains."|"Moon of Three Rings"|"Andre Norton"
00:00|midnight|"By midnight I found a pass which was no more than a knife edge of crevice, and was on the down slope to the plains. But fatigue drove me into hiding and the sleep I must have."|"Moon of Three Rings"|"Andre Norton"
"< 12:00"|"almost noon"|"It had been almost noon when Malec had been struck down. With the best of success, I did not believe we could expect Maelen to return before two days passed, And I hoped those setting the trap in camp would grow discouraged before the end of that time. The strategy I had used to take the animals out of danger would be successful, unless they lost patience and returned."|"Moon of Three Rings"|"Andre Norton"
12:00|midday|"I judged it midday when we came out into the courtyard of the temple. There was no sign of the van, but two riding kasi awaited us, journey cloaks across their saddle pads, bundles of provisions hanging ready. I would have aided Maelen to mount, but she was too quick for me, and I went to my own kas. Could it be she shrank from any contact in aversion?"|"Moon of Three Rings"|"Andre Norton"
