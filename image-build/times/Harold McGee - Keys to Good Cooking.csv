"ap 01:30"|130|"To keep root vegetables firm and intact for tossing in a vegetable salad, precook pieces in water at 130 to 140°F/55 to 60°C for 30 minutes. Chill them in ice water for 30 minutes, then boil until tender."|"Keys to Good Cooking"|"Harold McGee"
"ap 03:50"|350|"The key to good frying is to adjust the oil temperature to the piece size and the time it takes to cook through. Fry at 350 to 375°F/175 to 190°C for small pieces that cook through in a few seconds or minutes, 325 to 340°F/160 to 170°C for larger, slower pieces."|"Keys to Good Cooking"|"Harold McGee"
"ap 01:30"|130|"To cook potato chunks that will stay intact when tossed for potato salad, firm their texture with a preheating treatment. Hold them for 30 minutes in hot water at 130 to 140°F/55 to 60°C, then chill them in ice water for 30 minutes. Then boil them as usual until they’re tender. Allow them to cool before tossing with dressing; hot potato flesh is more fragile."|"Keys to Good Cooking"|"Harold McGee"
"ap 02:50"|250|"To cook french fries in two stages, cut the potatoes into strips, soak them in ice water for 30 minutes, then blot dry and fry twice: first at 250 to 325°F/120 to 163°C until limp, then at 350 to 375°F/175 to 190°C until brown.
For french fries that remain crisp longer, cook them in three stages. Cook the potato strips in simmering salted water until limp, allow them to cool and dry until they’re tacky to the touch, then fry twice: first at 340°F/170°C until they just begin to color, then at 365 to 375°F/185 to 190°C until brown.

Radicchio is a red-leaved lettuce relative, somewhat bitter and also astringent thanks to the red pigment."|"Keys to Good Cooking"|"Harold McGee"

"ap 02:00"|160|"white teas at 175°F/80°C for 2 to 3 minutes,
Chinese green teas at 175°F/80°C for 2 to 3 minutes,
Japanese green teas at 160 to 175°F/70 to 80°C for 1 to 3 minutes,
oolong teas just off the boil for 3 to 4 minutes,
black teas just off the boil for 4 to 5 minutes,
puerh teas just off the boil for 1 to 3 minutes.

Check tea flavor during the brewing by pouring small tastes at intervals."|"Keys to Good Cooking"|"Harold McGee"
