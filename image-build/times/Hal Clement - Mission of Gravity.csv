12:00|noon|"""It should, Barl, and I can think of only one reason it escaped us. Each picture, you recall, covered many square miles; one alone would include all the land we can see from here, and much more. The picture that does cover this area must have been made between sunrise and noon, when there would have been no shadow."""|"Mission of Gravity"|"Hal Clement"
12:00|noon|"""At the rate you've been going, there should be plenty of time to get there and scout around for a good harbor.""
""All right. What's my noon bearing?""
The men were keeping close track of the Bree's position by means of the radiation from the vision sets, although it was quite impossible to see the ship from beyond the atmosphere with any telescope, and the meteorologist had no trouble in giving the captain the bearing he wanted. The sails were adjusted accordingly and the Bree moved off on the new course."|"Mission of Gravity"|"Hal Clement"
"ap 01:45"|"one forty-five"|"""All right. Get your little friend on the radio and find out all he knows himself about this ability of his. Rick, look up or find out somehow the solubility of hydrogen in methane at eight atmospheres pressure and temperatures between minus one forty-five and one eighty-five Centigrade. Dave, put that slide rule back in your pocket and get to a calculator; get as precise a value of the hydrogen density on that clifftop as physics, chemistry, math, and the gods of good weather men will let you. Incidentally, didn't you say there was a drop of as much as three atmospheres in the center of some of those tropical hurricanes? Charlie, find out from Barlennan whether and how much he and his men felt that. Let's go."" The conference broke up, its members scattering to their various tasks. Rosten remained in the screen room with Lackland, listening to his conversation with the Mesklinite far below."|"Mission of Gravity"|"Hal Clement"
"ap 01:45"|"one forty-five"|"""Think what a place like that could do in your gravity, climate, and atmosphere. Look: winter in the part of Mesklin you know—the southern hemisphere—coincides with the world's passage of its closest point to the sun. That's summer in the north, and the icecap boils off—that's why you have such terrific and continual storms at that season. We already knew that. The condensing moisture— methane—whatever you want to call it—gives up its heat and warms the air in your hemisphere, even though you don't see the sun for three or four months. The temperature probably goes up nearly to the boiling point of methane—around minus one forty-five at your surface pressure. Isn't that so? Don't you get a good deal warmer in winter?"""|"Mission of Gravity"|"Hal Clement"
