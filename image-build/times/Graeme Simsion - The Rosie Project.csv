There were approximately twenty-five people milling around the door and the front of the classroom, but I immediately recognised Julie, the convenor, from Gene’s description: ‘blonde with big tits’. In fact, her breasts were probably no more than one and a half standard deviations from the mean size for her body weight, and hardly a remarkable identifying feature. It was more a question of elevation and exposure, as a result of her choice of costume, which seemed perfectly practical for a hot January evening."|"The Rosie Project"|"Graeme Simsion"

I packed four questionnaires and arrived precisely at 8.00 p.m. Only one woman was there! The other three were late. It was a stunning validation of the advantages of field work. These women may well have answered (b) a little early or (c) on time, but their actual behaviour demonstrated otherwise. I decided to temporarily allow (d) a little late, on the basis that a single occasion might not be representative of their overall performance. I could hear Claudia saying, ‘Don, everyone’s late occasionally.’"|"The Rosie Project"|"Graeme Simsion"

‘Excellent. I’ll make a reservation for 8.00 p.m.’
‘You’re kidding.’"|"The Rosie Project"|"Graeme Simsion"
20:00|"8.00 p.m."|"It was an odd response. Why would I make a confusing joke with someone I barely knew?

00:00|midnight|"‘Aren’t you forgetting something? Today is my day. And tomorrow. I own you until midnight Monday. Now get your butt down here. I’m hanging out for breakfast.’"|"The Rosie Project"|"Graeme Simsion"
00:00|midnight|"‘How old are you?’ said Rosie, aggressively. She didn’t wait for the answer. ‘You’re like an old man – I always have my breakfast before I shower, don’t sit in my chair, that’s where I sit … Do not fuck with me, Don Tillman.’ She said the last words quite slowly. I decided it was best not to fuck with her. By midnight tomorrow it would be over. In the interim, I would adopt the dentist mindset."|"The Rosie Project"|"Graeme Simsion"
19:00|"7.00 p.m."|"Rosie was three minutes late for our 7.00 p.m. foyer meeting. I was about to call her room when she arrived wearing clothes purchased that day – white jeans and a blue t-shirt thing – and the jacket she had worn the previous evening. I remembered a Gene-ism, something I had heard him say to Claudia. ‘You’re looking very elegant,’ I said. It was a risky statement, but her reaction appeared to be positive. She did look very elegant."|"The Rosie Project"|"Graeme Simsion"
22:00|"10.00 p.m."|"We caught the subway back to the Lower East Side. I was hungry, but did not want to break the rules by suggesting that we eat. But Rosie had this planned too. A 10.00 p.m. booking at a restaurant called Momofuku Ko. We were on Rosie time again."|"The Rosie Project"|"Graeme Simsion"
16:32|"4.32 p.m."|"Monday was allocated to visiting popular tourist sights. We had breakfast at Katz’s Deli, where a scene for a film called When Harry Met Sally was shot. We went to the top of the Empire State Building, famous as a location for An Affair to Remember. We visited MOMA and the Met, which were excellent.
We were back at the hotel early – 4.32 p.m.
‘Back here at 6.30,’ said Rosie."|"The Rosie Project"|"Graeme Simsion"

"ap 00:00"|twelve|"‘Short answer, no,’ she said. We walked a bit further. ‘Long answer: you asked what I meant about being fucked-up by my father. Psychology 101 – our first relationship with a male is with our fathers. It affects how we relate to men forever. So, lucky me, I get a choice of two. Phil, who’s fucked in the head, or my real father who walked away from me and my mother. And I get this choice when I’m twelve years old and Phil sits me down and has this “I wish your mother could be here to tell you” talk with me. You know, just the standard stuff your dad tells you at twelve – I’m not your dad, your mum who died before you could know her properly isn’t the perfect person you thought she was, and you’re only here because of your mother being easy and I wish you weren’t so I could go off and have a life.’"|"The Rosie Project"|"Graeme Simsion"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"‘See you at eight – and don’t be late,’ said Rosie. Then she kissed me. It was not a passionate kiss; it was on the cheek, but it was disturbing. Neither positive nor negative, just disturbing."|"The Rosie Project"|"Graeme Simsion"
10:30|"10.30 a.m."|"We were first in line when the museum opened at 10.30 a.m. I had planned the visit according to the history of the universe, the planet and life. Thirteen billion years of history in six hours. At noon, Rosie suggested we delete lunch from the schedule to allow more time with the exhibits. Later, she stopped at the reconstruction of the famous Laetoli footprints made by hominids approximately 3.6 million years ago."|"The Rosie Project"|"Graeme Simsion"

18:45|"6.45 p.m."|"We had one critical task to perform before leaving New York the following morning. Max Freyberg, the cosmetic surgeon and potential biological father of Rosie, who was ‘booked solid’, had agreed to see us for fifteen minutes at 6.45 p.m. Rosie had told his secretary she was writing a series of articles for a publication about successful alumni of the university. I was carrying Rosie’s camera and would be identified as a photographer."|"The Rosie Project"|"Graeme Simsion"
"ap 04:11"|411|"He led me through the back of his office, past Rachel to a door marked ‘Private’ and left me there. There was no way to exit without returning the way we had come. I took out my phone, called 411 – directory assistance – and they connected me to Rachel. I could hear the phone ring and Rachel answer. I kept my voice low."|"The Rosie Project"|"Graeme Simsion"
20:55|"8.55 p.m."|"I could not sleep. I had not eaten and it was only 8.55 p.m. Claudia and Gene would be at work now, back in Melbourne, and I did not feel like talking to either of them. I considered it inadvisable to contact Rosie again, so I rang my remaining friend. Dave had eaten already, but we walked to a pizza restaurant and he ate a second dinner. Then we went to a bar and watched baseball and talked about women. I do not recall much of what either of us said, but I suspect that little of it would have been useful in making rational plans for the future."|"The Rosie Project"|"Graeme Simsion"
"ap 07:45"|7.45|"Neither spoke. Rosie looked a little stunned. I looked at her directly. ‘That’s a charming pendant,’ I said. ‘I’ll pick you up at 7.45.’ I was shaking as I walked away, but I had given it my best effort. Hitch from Hitch would have been pleased with me."|"The Rosie Project"|"Graeme Simsion"
16:00|"4.00 p.m."|"I went back to my office and changed from my Gregory Peck costume into my new trousers and jacket. Then I made a phone call. The receptionist was not prepared to make an appointment for a personal matter, so I booked a fitness evaluation with Phil Jarman, Rosie’s father in air quotes, for 4.00 p.m."|"The Rosie Project"|"Graeme Simsion"

‘It’s 10.31,’ I said. ‘Too late for visitors.’
‘Are you okay?’ said Claudia, again."|"The Rosie Project"|"Graeme Simsion"
"ap 10:30"|10.30|"‘Ring back if you’re home before 10.30,’ my mother said. It was 10.38, but I decided not to be pedantic."|"The Rosie Project"|"Graeme Simsion"

07:48|"7.48 a.m."|"It was only 7.48 a.m. when I arrived at the university. A police car approached from the opposite direction, slowed as it passed me, then signalled a U-turn. It occurred to me that it could have been summoned to deal with my apparent theft from the hobo. I turned quickly down the bicycle path, where I could not be followed by a motor vehicle, and headed towards the Genetics building to find a towel."|"The Rosie Project"|"Graeme Simsion"
