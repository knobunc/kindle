"< 10:00"|"shortly before 10 A.M."|"And one day Hallam entered the laboratory (well, it was October 3, 2070, to be exact), got to work, stopped shortly before 10 A.M., stared transfixed at the bottle, and lifted it. It was as dusty as ever, the label as faded, but he called out, “God damn it; who the hell has been tampering with this?”"|"The Gods Themselves"|"Isaac Asimov"
12:00|midday|"She had loved the surface at evening. The other Emotionals had called it cold and gloomy and had quivered and coalesced when she described it for them. They were ready enough to emerge in the warmth of midday and stretch and feed, but that was exactly what made the midday dull. She didn’t like to be around the twittering lot of them."|"The Gods Themselves"|"Isaac Asimov"

She had run from him that day; not in malice; not because she suspected what he had to tell her; but only out of joy.

But there is more than one interaction; there are four. In addition to the strong nuclear, there is the electromagnetic, the weak nuclear, and the gravitational, with intensity ratios of 130:1:10-:10-. But if four, why not an infinite number, with all the others too weak to be detectable or to influence our Universe in any way.”"|"The Gods Themselves"|"Isaac Asimov"
