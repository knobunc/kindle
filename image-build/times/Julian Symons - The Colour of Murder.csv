"ap > 10:00"|"Just after ten o’clock"|"“Just after ten o’clock on that Monday night, Miss Morton went out for a walk. Her fiancé offered to accompany her, but she said she would prefer to be alone. Counsel for the defence has tentatively suggested, in his very able final speech, that she might have gone out to keep an appointment. You may think that is intrinsically improbable, bearing in mind the facts of her father’s illness and her own recent engagement – and you may think also that there is nothing unlikely, after the strain under which she had been living for the past few hours, in her desire to be alone for a little and to take a breath of air."|"The Colour of Murder"|"Julian Symons"
"ap 10:30"|ten-thirty|"“Now, at some time between ten-thirty and twelve o’clock midnight (these are the time limits suggested by the expert witnesses for the prosecution, and they were not questioned by the defence) Sheila Morton was brutally attacked and done to death on Brighton beach. Her head and face were beaten by several blows from a blunt instrument which has not been found, but may have been a large stone from the beach. Her clothing had been interfered with, but although there were signs that sexual assault had been attempted, she had not in fact been violated."|"The Colour of Murder"|"Julian Symons"

"> 18:30"|"just after six-thirty that night"|"“Sheila Morton was a virgin. She was friendly in her manner, but not at all the kind of girl, you may think, to walk on a dark beach at night with a stranger. Bear in mind that she had just become engaged, and you may think that what was unlikely becomes incredible. You may think that when Sheila Morton went down from the lighted promenade to the unlighted beach it was in the company of somebody she knew and trusted. It is suggested by the prosecution that she met John Wilkins, accepted his invitation to walk by the sea, that there she resisted his attempts to make love to her, and that he killed her in a fit of passion. It is my duty to tell you that in this case there can be no question of any other verdict than that of wilful murder. The possibility that Wilkins is not competent to plead has not been raised by the defence, and no evidence has been offered in relation to it. This in spite of the fact that Wilkins can give no explanation of his movements between just after six-thirty that night and the next morning. Such brief periods of amnesia – or, as they are commonly called, blackouts – are not unknown after periods of heavy drinking, or under some mental stress, and although they might be used to suggest that the prisoner was not responsible for his actions, that suggestion has not been made by the defence. The defence is simply that he did not commit this crime."|"The Colour of Murder"|"Julian Symons"
"ap 23:40"|"twenty minutes to twelve"|"“…the question of times,” he was saying. “This is a point of the greatest importance, in which the evidence given by various witnesses is irreconcilable. Mr Fanum, you will remember, said that he saw a man come up from the beach to the promenade at twenty minutes to twelve, and identified that man as Wilkins. In his cross-examination Mr Newton made great play with a phrase the witness had used about a cry he heard on the beach, a cry which had in it, he said, ‘the colour of murder’. It is a fanciful phrase, and you may think that Mr Fanum is prone to such flights of fancy. He said the man’s face was pale, and Mr Newton pointed out that all faces look pale under sodium lighting of the kind installed at this point on the beach. He suggested that Mr Fanum might have seen a photograph of the prisoner and was influenced by that in making his identification. You will have to decide how much significance to attach to Mr Fanum’s evidence. Is he merely fanciful, or was it really the prisoner he saw coming up from the beach?"|"The Colour of Murder"|"Julian Symons"
"ap 23:50"|"ten minutes to twelve"|"“Linked with Mr Fanum’s evidence is that of the hall porter Shaddock, who testified that the prisoner came in at ten minutes to twelve. On the other hand Mrs Wilkins, who looked at her bedside clock when the prisoner came into the bedroom, says it was then twenty-five minutes to twelve. Clearly they cannot both be correct. It is suggested by the defence that Shaddock was misled because he was reading the time only by a reflection of the clock in the hall. It is suggested by the prosecution that Mrs Wilkins was deceived by a clock outside, which struck the three-quarters when she thought it struck the half-hour. You will make up your minds which of these witnesses was mistaken. I must point out, however, that if you believe Mrs Wilkins, you will necessarily discount Mr Fanum’s evidence, since if Wilkins entered his bedroom at twenty-five minutes to twelve he cannot possibly have been seen on the promenade five minutes later. I must point out, too, that the usual distrust felt of evidence given by a wife in her husband’s defence has little application here. Much of what Mrs Wilkins had to say, under cross-examination, was so damaging to her husband, and it was evidence given with such remarkable composure, that she may be acquitted of any desire to shield him."|"The Colour of Murder"|"Julian Symons"

"ap 09:30"|nine-thirty|"“Then there are questions you must ask yourselves, also, about the evidence given by Miss Prenton for the defence. She is a prostitute and one, as you will have gathered, who is not ashamed of her calling. Her evidence, taken alone, does not establish the prisoner’s innocence. It does, however, place him in her house from roughly nine-thirty to eleven o’clock. It would have taken him some fifteen minutes to walk back to the spot where Sheila Morton was murdered, and that would mean he did not meet her until, say, a quarter past eleven or a little later. Mr Newton argued very forcibly that this left him little time to murder Miss Morton and be back in his room at the hotel at twenty-five minutes to twelve. This argument, of course, only has validity if you accept Mrs Wilkins’ evidence about the time of his return. Mr Newton also argued that if we accept Miss Prenton’s story which places the time of meeting no earlier than eleven fifteen, Miss Morton must have been out walking for more than an hour when she met Wilkins. He said that this was most unlikely, since her father was ill, and she had said she would not be very long. Does this argument seem to you conclusive? Bear in mind that she knew a night nurse was installed, that there was nothing she could do for her father, and that she had been with him continuously since his heart attack on Saturday evening.
