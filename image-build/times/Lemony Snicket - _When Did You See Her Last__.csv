"ap ~ 10:30"|"about ten thirty"|"The shopkeeper squinted at the flyer. “Yesterday morning,” she said, “about ten thirty. She hurried in here to buy that silly breakfast food she likes.” She led us down an aisle and pulled down a box for us to see. It was Schoenberg Cereal, the brand Zada and Zora had mentioned. TWELVE WHOLESOME GRAINS COMBINED IN A STRICT SEQUENCE, the label read. I could not imagine who would eat such a thing in a kitchen where fresh-baked cinnamon rolls could be had."|"_When Did You See Her Last__"|"Lemony Snicket"
"ap ~ 10:30"|"about ten thirty"|"Jake thought about this for a minute, and the food started to smell good. “Miss Knight was in here yesterday morning,” he said, “about ten thirty.”"|"_When Did You See Her Last__"|"Lemony Snicket"

“Ten thirty?” I asked. “Are you sure about that?”
“Sure I’m sure,” he said."|"_When Did You See Her Last__"|"Lemony Snicket"

"ap 10:30"|"ten thirty"|"“Cleo Knight woke up yesterday morning and had her usual breakfast of Schoenberg Cereal,” I said. “She was wearing brand-new clothes that were black and white, and an old hat that was somewhat pink. She ran away to join the circus and didn’t leave a note, but that couldn’t have happened, because she’s a brilliant chemist, not a circus performer, and the people who know her best say she definitely would have left a note. She was seen at Partial Foods by Polly Partial at ten thirty buying Schoenberg Cereal and leaving in a taxicab, but that couldn’t have happened, because she’d driven there in her brand-new Dilemma.”"|"_When Did You See Her Last__"|"Lemony Snicket"
"ap 10:30"|"ten thirty"|"“Mind the ears,” I said. “Now, Cleo Knight was also seen at Hungry’s by Jake Hix, also at ten thirty, and she left in the Dilemma. But that can’t have happened, because the Dilemma is parked nearby with a flat tire.”"|"_When Did You See Her Last__"|"Lemony Snicket"
"ap ~ 10:30"|"about ten thirty"|"“He will if you answer a question,” Moxie piped up. “Pip, did you and your brother take Cleo Knight anywhere yesterday morning, say about ten thirty?”"|"_When Did You See Her Last__"|"Lemony Snicket"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"“We’d better synchronize our watches,” Moxie said, and held her wrist next to Squeak’s. They adjusted their watches so the times matched up exactly. “It’s precisely three minutes until eight o’clock,” she said, “now.”"|"_When Did You See Her Last__"|"Lemony Snicket"
"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"It was past midnight when I let myself in. For a moment it looked like the Far East Suite was covered in confetti. I could hear Theodora snoring. After all this time it was a familiar sound to me, but I couldn’t say that I was used to it. I stepped to the bathroom and turned on the light and left the door open a crack so I could see. The reason it looked like the room was covered in confetti was that it was covered in confetti. There were a few streamers taped to the walls, and I could see a bottle of champagne in a bucket of ice. Theodora was asleep on her bed, with a bright pink party hat tilted on her head. She had fallen asleep in the middle of her celebration for solving the case of Cleo Knight."|"_When Did You See Her Last__"|"Lemony Snicket"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"I nodded. My feet ached. The day wasn’t over yet, not even after midnight. I followed my associate out of the hotel and down the street. Naturally, we walked toward the library, though we stopped in the middle of the lawn, where the ruined statue glinted in the moonlight. I could see lights on in the police station, where the Officers Mitchum were arguing over whose fault it was that Ellington had slipped out of the cell, while Dr. Flammarion and Nurse Dander sat, handcuffed and forced to listen. The library looked closed and locked up, although I thought I saw a few moths fluttering near the entrance, now that their home, a tall, broad tree, was gone. I wondered if Dashiell Qwerty had finished all the work he was doing in the library. Perhaps he was sleeping there now. “What happened?” I asked finally."|"_When Did You See Her Last__"|"Lemony Snicket"
