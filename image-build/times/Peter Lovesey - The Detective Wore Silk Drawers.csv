As I say, we see ’im in church on Sundays, those of us that go to Sung Eucharist and Matins, but you ain’t liable to see ’im any other time, unless it’s passin’ in a carriage. ’E don’t call on us for a yarn and a smoke any more than we’d look ’im up at Radstock ’All.”"|"The Detective Wore Silk Drawers"|"Peter Lovesey"
"ap 10:50"|Ten-fifty|"“They’re right,” Thackeray confirmed. “Ten-fifty. We must get to the station.”"|"The Detective Wore Silk Drawers"|"Peter Lovesey"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"“You must travel with Meanix and the London mob. Get close enough to listen to ’em. I’ve got business here with Thackeray. We’ll take the first train back in the morning. Report to the station at nine tomorrow. I expect to be there. If I’m not, tell the Inspector everything that happened. And ask him, at my request, to get a squad of picked men out to Radstock Hall.”"|"The Detective Wore Silk Drawers"|"Peter Lovesey"
23:30|"half an hour before midnight"|"¦ Perhaps it appealed to Cribb’s sense of humour, forcing a man in his fifties across drenched fields in Essex, half an hour before midnight. It was possible, Thackeray speculated, that if he had gallivanted about the bar of the Fox like a penguin attempting flight, Cribb might have sent him back to a warm bed in London. He suffered because he was utterly dependable."|"The Detective Wore Silk Drawers"|"Peter Lovesey"
12:00|midday|"July 17th. I passed this day in abject discomfort, the direct consequence of the two ounces of Glauber’s salts administered to me the evening before. I was awakened at six by D’Estin, who ordered me to strip and then advanced on me with horsehair gloves and rubbed my flesh into an inflamed state. The cold bath that followed cooled me somewhat before the rubbing began afresh. Then a two-mile walk outside the grounds, which in other circumstances I should have enjoyed. On this occasion it was with some relief that I returned to the Hall. Breakfast followed, consisting of a broiled cutlet of mutton, stale bread and strong tea. D’Estin then took me in hand again, the morning’s programme consisting of alternating showers and massage. After the midday meal, for which I was served roast beef, stale bread, a mealy potato and a small portion of greens, I was allowed to move about gently until nature had been complied with, and then to the gymnasium. Much barbell work and some sparring with the sack, all under D’Estin’s direction. Then more rubbing, another shower, and a slow walk through the grounds. Two lightly boiled eggs and dry toast for tea."|"The Detective Wore Silk Drawers"|"Peter Lovesey"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"Wednesday’s programme was identical to Tuesday’s, even to the composition of the meals. But after tea I was asked to report to Mrs. Vibart in the drawing room, Edmund Vibart also being present. Mrs. Vibart inquired about my progress, and seemed pleased enough with the answers I gave. She then informed me that a “test” was being arranged for me this coming Saturday. Edmund has contracted for a local man to spar with me in the yard of the Fox and Grapes, commencing seven o’clock. It is not to be an articled contest, but a hat will be passed round after, and the contributions shared between us. I am to be attended by Vibart (bottleholder) and D’Estin (second). My instructions are to let the fight run for ten rounds and then to try to finish it. My opponent is said to be well-made and strong, but not so spry as I am."|"The Detective Wore Silk Drawers"|"Peter Lovesey"
"ap 07:00"|"Seven o’clock"|"“You’re becoming quite a Corinthian, Constable. Would you care to see a fight on Saturday?”
“Seven o’clock, Fox and Grapes? I wouldn’t miss it, Sarge.”
“Nor I. We’ll need to look a trifle different from last time, though. Can’t be known as regulars. Tweeds and deerstalker for me. You’re easy. You just shave off your beard.”"|"The Detective Wore Silk Drawers"|"Peter Lovesey"
"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"Jago at once stood to go. The Ebony, too, nodded and removed himself, leaving Isabel and D’Estin alone. It was well past midnight. The candles had burned to a molten liquid at the bottom of each glass. D’Estin’s cigar glowed against the weird background like a demon’s eye."|"The Detective Wore Silk Drawers"|"Peter Lovesey"

"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"She was in the morning room at her writing desk, and she did not look up when he entered. It was early; one rarely saw her before noon. She was wearing black, as usual, velveteen skirt and sealskin jacket over a white lace blouse. Her wardrobe must have been bought for a year’s mourning at least. Only on the evening after his fight had Jago seen her in another colour."|"The Detective Wore Silk Drawers"|"Peter Lovesey"

"ap 09:00"|nine|"Then came the inquisition: D’Estin, Vibart and finally Jago appearing before Isabel. She was tight-lipped when he saw her, but surprisingly forbearing with him. Perhaps Vibart had managed to convince her that the Ebony had left of his own accord. At any rate, Jago was able to withdraw after ten minutes, having admitted to no more than seeing the departure— which had actually been quite conspicuous, but exceedingly well-timed. And by supper that evening calm was restored, if a little uneasily. Isabel said little to D’Estin or her brother-in-law, but talked freely to Jago about the war in Afghanistan, the theatre, the London season—anything, in fact, but pugilism. At nine he had been able to plead tiredness. For one alarming moment he thought she was about to offer massage, but it passed. He thankfully made his exit."|"The Detective Wore Silk Drawers"|"Peter Lovesey"
12:00|noon|"“Ah, is that so? Well, he’s not necessary to our last item of business. The time and place, gentlemen, the time and place. Now let’s say this at the outset. We want no trouble from the police. They’ve queered too many pitches in the last year or two by getting wind of a fight before it takes place. So I’ve made it known that we’ve settled on Surrey and I hope it’s reached the law’s ears, for now I’d like to propose that we set up stakes in Kent—out Tunbridge Wells way. There’s a fast train out from London Bridge at noon."|"The Detective Wore Silk Drawers"|"Peter Lovesey"
"ap ~ 11:00"|"about eleven"|"“They won’t—until about eleven tomorrow morning, when I let slip the word,” Beckett explained. “That’s early enough for the needle-pointed division.

"< 00:00"|"SHORTLY BEFORE MIDNIGHT"|"D’ESTIN WAS RIGHT. RETIRING SHORTLY BEFORE MIDNIGHT, Jago settled quickly into untroubled sleep and woke much refreshed to sunshine and the colloquy of the rook community on his side of the house: no melodious awakening, but preferable to the squeak and trundle of handcarts and carriage wheels outside his lodgings at Palace Place. There had always been a rookery at home, at Chapeldurham; with his eyes trained on the ceiling, it was amusing how graphically the carving revived early memories. Each one in a line of three nannies was available for recall with her distinctive morning ritual: cold bath with coal-tar soap; wrestling match under the quilt; and rhubarb pills and stretching exercises."|"The Detective Wore Silk Drawers"|"Peter Lovesey"

“Quarter to eight. She’ll be down in the kitchens by now.
Must have heard that halfwit shooting. He’ll have to tell her he was after game. Look, I’d better get the servants out of the way altogether. I’ll go down there now and tell ’em Isabel went off to London last night, and we’re off shortly, so that they can all take the weekend off.”"|"The Detective Wore Silk Drawers"|"Peter Lovesey"

"ap 06:00"|six|"After that, though, nothing for two hours. Small wonder that Thackeray finally turned on his back. The day had started for him at six, a mortifying hour for a senior constable to be afoot, with Blackfriars Road still wet from the water cart, and a full two hours to go before the dossers got turned out of the Salvation Army shelter. Then a far-from-comfortable third-class journey out to Rainham on the London and Southend and an hour’s walk in the sun to Radstock Hall. After footing it last time through rain and mud, he had brought his Inverness and heaviest boots and now regretted it. He had blisters the size of pennies, he was sure, but dared not examine them for fear of the feet swelling and never going back into the boots. He closed his eyes and imagined himself checking closing time in Hampstead."|"The Detective Wore Silk Drawers"|"Peter Lovesey"
"ap 08:30"|eight-thirty|"“Then, why,” pondered Thackeray, “did you drag me across the fields blowing like a confounded grampus at eight-thirty?” He trained the glasses on the one constable in the force he would not have changed places with at that moment. Jago was now seated in the gig; from the set of his shoulders it might well have been a tumbril. D’Estin climbed up to join him and Vibart shook the reins."|"The Detective Wore Silk Drawers"|"Peter Lovesey"
12:00|noon|"The noon sun bore down heavily as they made their way across the fields towards Rainham. The blister on Thack-eray’s right foot was now troubling him more than the hoof kick on his shin. It was going to take at least an hour to reach the station. Then they had to get to London Bridge, find out where exactly the fight was to be staged, and take the first available train there. Jago could be beyond help by then."|"The Detective Wore Silk Drawers"|"Peter Lovesey"

“Since eight this morning. Can I ’elp you, guvnor?”

Afternoon sunshine filtered through the grimy glass onto the nodding faces opposite—a fat, flushed woman in dolman jacket and a hat supporting a small stuffed bird and satin cherries that rocked with the train; and her two pale sons clutching and systematically emptying bags of jujubes. In the corner a wide-awake hat had tilted forward to muffle its owner’s snores. Thackeray screwed up his handkerchief in his pocket and thought about Henry Jago."|"The Detective Wore Silk Drawers"|"Peter Lovesey"

Three-quarters of my men are off duty, and that leaves four of us. I refuse to close the office to hare off after a bunch of London riffraff that might be over the county boundary by now.

It had been an illuminating day. “Report to Inspector Jowett, Great Scotland Yard, 11:30 A.M.,” the message left on his desk had said. There wasn’t much doubt in his mind about the outcome of this interview. He felt sorry there was no message for Thackeray, though, getting on in years, of course, and not particularly inspired, but surely worth a lift in rank towards the close of a dutiful career."|"The Detective Wore Silk Drawers"|"Peter Lovesey"

You couldn’t drop one of them off Waterloo Bridge without someone raising a barney. Now this little set-to here is a far likelier invitation to violence. Crowd out from London, more set on placing a pretty bet than following a pug’s fortunes. Meanix may be known to a few, but who’d miss him if he dropped dead here in front of us? None of this mob is going to report the fact. You don’t risk prosecution to report the passing of a knuckle fighter who means no more to you than a guinea at five to one.”"|"The Detective Wore Silk Drawers"|"Peter Lovesey"
