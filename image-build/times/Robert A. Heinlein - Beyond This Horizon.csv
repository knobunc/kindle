What had we better select for?’ ‘Are you sure you want to do this?’ he says. ‘You’re both good sound types and the state needs controls like you. I’m willing to recommend an increase in benefit, if you’ll drop it.’ ‘No,’ I said, ‘I know my rights. Any citizen, even a control natural, can practice gene selection if he wants to.’ Then he let me have it, full charge.”"|"Beyond This Horizon"|"Robert A. Heinlein"

“Right. We’ll redecorate it in midnight blue and silver.”
“That’s right. I’ll send a stat to confirm. That’s all, I guess. I’m clearing.”"|"Beyond This Horizon"|"Robert A. Heinlein"

He had a long, low wicked-looking Hispano-Suiza. Class."|"Beyond This Horizon"|"Robert A. Heinlein"
12:00|"high noon"|"“Give.” Way out on far Pluto, the weather is cold. The temperature rarely rises above eighteen degrees centigrade absolute even on the side toward the sun. And that refers to high noon in the open sunlight. Much of the machinery of the observatories is exposed to this intense cold. Machinery that will work on Terra will not work on Pluto, and vice versa. The laws of physics seem to be invariable but the characteristics of materials change with changes in temperature—consider ice and water, a mild example."|"Beyond This Horizon"|"Robert A. Heinlein"
