12:00|midday|"Dicey lay on her back under the wide-branched paper mulberry tree. She opened her eyes and looked up. The paper mulberry had broad leaves that made a pool of shade in which she lay. Thick roots spread around her, making a kind of chair for her to lean on. She wore only shorts in the hot midday air. Her arms and chest were spattered and streaked with red paint, and the barn was completely painted, top to bottom, all four sides, patched and painted and looking good. The paint and sweat were drying on Dicey’s body. She could hear the buzzing of insects and nothing else. For once she was alone, but she knew where everybody was."|"Dicey's Song"|"Cynthia Voigt"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"“You know, Dicey,” he said. His eyes shifted away from hers. At ten he was old enough to be embarrassed. He hurried after Gram."|"Dicey's Song"|"Cynthia Voigt"
"ap 03:15"|"three fifteen"|"She took the folded paper outside to sit beside Gram while she read it. It was from Maybeth’s music teacher, asking Gram to come in for a meeting, the next day, at three fifteen, as soon as school let out. “But Maybeth can sing,” Dicey protested. “She never had a note from her music teacher before,” Dicey told Gram."|"Dicey's Song"|"Cynthia Voigt"
"ap 03:15"|"three fifteen"|"Dicey closed her eyes briefly, then turned her attention back outside. If she hadn’t, just then, she would have missed seeing the straight-backed figure emerge from the main doors with a clumsy purse over its shoulder. Gram. Dicey couldn’t mistake that high carriage of the chin, or the unkempt curly gray hair. But her meeting about Maybeth wasn’t until three fifteen. What was Gram doing at Dicey’s school?"|"Dicey's Song"|"Cynthia Voigt"
"ap > 10:00"|"after ten"|"“I’m sorry,” Dicey said again. She bit her lip to keep from giggling. He had a voice like Mina’s, just as rich, only deeper. “I didn’t know it was after ten.”"|"Dicey's Song"|"Cynthia Voigt"
12:00|midday|"By the time they went to bed, a light dusting of snow glittered over everything, glistening white in the dark air. But when Dicey emerged from Millie’s the next afternoon, there was no sign of it. The cold weather had been nudged aside by an unexpectedly balmy day. Sunlight poured warm out of a cloudless sky; the breeze blew gently, wafting the warm air around. The temperature, Millie told her, had reached the sixties at midday. Dicey peeled her sweater over her head and saw Mina walking toward her, wheeling a bike."|"Dicey's Song"|"Cynthia Voigt"
"ap 04:00"|four|"“I’ve been thinking,” Dicey said to the stiff back. “It’s only four and a half years before I can get a full-time job. Then we won’t need any extra help from anyone.”"|"Dicey's Song"|"Cynthia Voigt"
"ap 08:45"|8:45|"The airport at Baltimore was a huge, sprawling building. Gram and Dicey threaded their way through throngs of people. Dicey followed Gram, saying nothing. She stopped when Gram stopped, standing just behind her. Gram stopped first at an information booth to ask about flights to Boston, then hurried down a long hallway to the counter of an airlines. She bought two tickets for the 8:45 flight to Boston. One-way tickets. She checked in their suitcase. Then she led Dicey to a coffee shop and instructed her to order something to eat. “You’ve got to eat,” she said."|"Dicey's Song"|"Cynthia Voigt"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"“In which to place the ashes,” he explained to her. “We have a good selection. If you will choose the one you want, you can return to pick her up at —” he looked at his wristwatch and consulted a paper on his desk ” — three o’clock.”"|"Dicey's Song"|"Cynthia Voigt"
"ap 05:00"|five|"They delivered the box to the undertaker, who told them to return at five. Then they had a late lunch and returned to the motel room to pack. They talked about ordinary things, about taking a train to Wilmington and a bus from there to Salisbury. Dicey changed into her brown dress and belted it at the waist. She and Gram weren’t exactly going to make a march, but she wanted to mark the formality of the occasion, taking Momma home. They talked about the presents Dicey had bought, of which Gram approved. Then Gram asked, “Wasn’t there change?”"|"Dicey's Song"|"Cynthia Voigt"
08:00|"eight in the morning"|"So they called the house in Crisfield. Gram placed the call, placed it collect. She spoke to Mr. Lingerie first, brushing aside his sympathy but making a point to tell him that without his money she would have been in real difficulty. She told him that they were taking a train that got into Wilmington at eight in the morning, and they would take buses down from there. Gram expected to see everybody at home, after school, she said. As far as Dicey could tell, Mr. Lingerie was saying yes, ma’am and yes, ma’am on the other end of the phone. Then Gram handed the phone to Dicey."|"Dicey's Song"|"Cynthia Voigt"
