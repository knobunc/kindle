"ap 05:44"|"five forty-four"|"Laughing Boy's wristwatch told me it was five forty-four. The metal strut was inside my belt, under the white orderly jacket, and it rubbed against my hip bone as I walked. There was a ceiling fixture about every twenty feet, casting about forty watts of light."|"Nine Princes in Amber"|"Roger Zelazny"
"ap ~ 08:00"|"about eight o'clock"|"It was about eight o'clock when the cab deposited me on a random corner in the nearest town. I paid off the driver and walked for around twenty minutes. Then I stopped in a diner, found a booth and had juice, a couple of eggs, toast, bacon and three cups of coffee. The bacon was too greasy."|"Nine Princes in Amber"|"Roger Zelazny"
"ap 09:30"|nine-thirty|"After giving breakfast a good hour, I started walking, found a clothing store, and waited till its nine-thirty opening."|"Nine Princes in Amber"|"Roger Zelazny"
"ap 03:00"|"three o'clock"|"The woman behind the desk wore a wide-collared, V-necked dress of blue-green, had long hair and low bangs, all of a cross between sunset clouds and the outer edge of a candle flame in an otherwise dark room, and natural, I somehow knew, and her eyes behind glasses I didn't think she needed were as blue as Lake Erie at three o'clock on a cloudless summer afternoon; and the color of her compressed smile matched her hair. But none of these was the reason I'd paused."|"Nine Princes in Amber"|"Roger Zelazny"
12:00|noon|"“We're in trouble,” I said. “Seventy-three ships made it through, and Caine has called on us to surrender by noon.”"|"Nine Princes in Amber"|"Roger Zelazny"
12:00|noon|"I lit a cigarette. I paced the deck. It was no longer morning. The mists had long vanished and the sun warmed my shoulders. Soon it would be noon. Perhaps two hours."|"Nine Princes in Amber"|"Roger Zelazny"
00:00|midnight|"By midnight on that second night we'd marched through slush and sleet, cold rains, warm rains, and on into a dry world."|"Nine Princes in Amber"|"Roger Zelazny"
12:00|"high noon"|"By high noon we were crossing the valley that paralleled the seacoast. The Forest of Arden was to the north and our left. Amber lay directly ahead. The breezes were cool and filled with the odors of earth and its sweet growing things. A few leaves fell. Amber lay eighty miles distant and was but a shimmer above the horizon."|"Nine Princes in Amber"|"Roger Zelazny"
12:00|noon|"We led a speed-march till noon. then rested. By then, we were twenty-five miles away from the foot of Kolvir. By twilight, the distance was ten."|"Nine Princes in Amber"|"Roger Zelazny"
00:00|midnight|"And we kept on. We marched till midnight and we bivouacked once again. By that time, I was beginning to feel fairly alive once more. I practiced a few cuts with my blade and could almost manage them. The next day, I felt even better."|"Nine Princes in Amber"|"Roger Zelazny"
