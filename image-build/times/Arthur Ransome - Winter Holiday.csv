"ap 00:30"|"half-past twelve"|"“That’s your mother all over,” said Mrs Dixon. “Well, look as much as you like, but dinner’ll be ready at half-past twelve, and you’d best be here if you want any.”"|"Winter Holiday"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"Time had passed quicker than they thought, while they had been looking at pigs and cows and enviously watching the children on the island. Mrs Dixon called them in for dinner just when they were asking Mr Dixon whether it would be all right for them to go up the cart track that seemed to climb up the fell from the gate on the opposite side of the main road. Mrs Dixon was in a hurry to get dinner over, because she was baking pork pies for which she had a name throughout the district. Her mind was in the oven and they got only the vaguest answers when they asked her about the children they had seen. “Yes. Staying at the farm along the road. Six of them? That would be the Blackett lasses as well . . . Dixon, do keep yon door shut, with pies in the oven and a cold wind enough to ruin all.” And then, after dinner, looking over her shoulder with her hand on the knob of the oven door wrapped in a fold of her apron, she told them, “Come you in at four o’clock for a cup of hot tea. You’ll be wanting dark for your star-gazing, and I’ll give you your supper later.”"|"Winter Holiday"|"Arthur Ransome"
09:00|"9 a.m."|"TWO days later, a postcard from the doctor came to Holly Howe at breakfast-time. “Collect the gang. Inspection of jaws at 9 a.m.” John had run upstairs again at once to hoist the diamond over the north cone to let Dick and Dorothea know that they were to come to Holly Howe. And then, when breakfast had hardly been cleared away, there was the doctor, stamping the snow off his shoes on the doorstep and complaining of the slipperiness of the roads. “Chains on both back wheels,” he was saying as he was taking off his gloves, “and in spite of all I was skidding on the hill. But it’s grand weather for all that. Well, and where are the exiles?”"|"Winter Holiday"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 03:30"|"half-past three"|"John tapped the barometer gently, but Peggy, seeing the hands of the clock standing still at half-past three, though it was in the middle of the morning, marched straight up to it, opened it, and wound it up with the key that was hanging beside it. She asked John what the right time was, and when he told her, set the clock and closed its glass door with a sharp click. It was like taking possession."|"Winter Holiday"|"Arthur Ransome"
12:00|noon|"Once or twice, in the middle of the day, there seemed to be half a promise of a thaw; and the explorers, seeing drops of water on the tips of icicles, looked glumly at each other. But then, as the sun weakened, the frost came hard again, and sometimes for days on end it froze so hard that there was never a hint of melting snow even in the full glow of the sun at noon."|"Winter Holiday"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 01:00"|one|"“What about Cache Island?” he said, “or has it got a name already?”
“We’ve never given it one,” said Peggy.

12:00|midday|"But time was going on, and Dorothea had to live up to Susan’s standards as well as Nancy’s. There was tea to make to drink with their midday dinner. She boiled the kettle on the stove, and when the tea was ready, brought two clean plates out of the fo’c’sle. Sandwiches eaten straight out of a paper packet would have been too much like a picnic. But on plates, cut up with a knife and fork, they were much more like the kind of meal people would have in their own house or ship. There was room for the plates and two mugs on the end of the table, where Dick had pushed back the mess of skins and sewing things so that he could lay his lenses out in a row and look at his star-book while he was polishing them."|"Winter Holiday"|"Arthur Ransome"
21:00|"9 p.m."|"As he spoke he was turning over the leaves of the log, and suddenly caught sight of the last entry: – “Fine display of Northern lights. 9 p.m. Moon clear and high.” “What?” he said. “You haven’t been sleeping here at night?”"|"Winter Holiday"|"Arthur Ransome"
01:00|"one in the morning"|"“Not I!” said Captain Flint. “Not tonight. And, by the way, don’t you go along there either. Come straight to the houseboat tomorrow, and not too early. Peggy’s given me a bit of a surprise. It’ll be her turn for one in the morning.”"|"Winter Holiday"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 00:00"|"twelve o’clock"|"“We don’t know yet what time tomorrow. Disinfection, fumigation, and all the rest of it. Not before twelve o’clock at the very earliest, so she says. The doctor’s going round there first thing in the morning; and as soon as Nancy knows for certain, she’ll hoist a flag on the promontory. If it’s white, it means they won’t let her come till next day. If it’s a red one, it means she’s to be allowed to come across here for dinner and to stay the afternoon. We’ll have dinner a bit late because she won’t anyhow be able to start till twelve or half-past. Then we’ll settle everything in full council, and the day after tomorrow, if the weather goes on being decent, we’ll liven up the solitary Pole.”"|"Winter Holiday"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap ~ 01:00"|"about one o’clock"|"“Give them another half-hour,” said Captain Flint. “Nancy won’t be here till about one o’clock. She won’t be let out of Beckfoot till after twelve. I gather there’s some tremendous disinfection to be done, and she’ll come along smelling like a chemist’s shop.”"|"Winter Holiday"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap > 00:00"|"after twelve"|"“Give them another half-hour,” said Captain Flint. “Nancy won’t be here till about one o’clock. She won’t be let out of Beckfoot till after twelve. I gather there’s some tremendous disinfection to be done, and she’ll come along smelling like a chemist’s shop.”"|"Winter Holiday"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 00:00"|"twelve o’clock"|"“Well, there’s one thing about it,” he said. “It’s come before Nancy’ll have started. It’s not twelve o’clock yet, and she’s got sense enough not to start with it looking like this. Her mother wouldn’t let her, anyway.”"|"Winter Holiday"|"Arthur Ransome"
12:00|midday|"It was midday, but she was lighting the cabin lamp, and was bothered by the wild wind even in the cabin."|"Winter Holiday"|"Arthur Ransome"
12:00|midday|"At Beckfoot it had been very hard on Nancy when, at midday, just as she was making ready to start for the Fram, to meet once more the members of the expedition for whom her martyrdom had won a month of holiday, blowing snow had made it impossible to see more than a yard or two, and Mrs Blackett had said that she was not to think of going until it cleared. But it had grown worse and worse, and she had almost forgotten her own disappointment in her fears that the snow-drifts at the head of the lake would be so deep that they would have to put off once more the journey to the Pole that had been planned for tomorrow. She had got some comfort by throwing herself violently into the business of disinfecting. It had been already evening before the wind dropped and the storm was over and then, too late to go to the council, she had put on the fur hat and mittens that today, at last, were hers to handle, and had gone out in the garden. She was wading in the snow there when, as she had hoped he might, her ally, Captain Flint, came skating into the river."|"Winter Holiday"|"Arthur Ransome"
