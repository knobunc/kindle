On that particular afternoon, there were not so very many people around, but enough for me to be uncertain as to which one was Andrew Wiles. After a few moments I picked out a shy-looking man, listening to the conversation around him, sipping tea, and indulging in the ritual gathering of minds that mathematicians the world over engage in at around four o’clock in the afternoon. He simply guessed who I was."|"Fermat's Last Theorem"|"Simon Singh"

In this case a 6 × 6 × 6 cube added to an 8 × 8 × 8 cube does not have quite enough building blocks to form a 9 × 9 × 9 cube. There are 216 (6) building blocks in the first cube, and 512 (8) in the second. The total is 728 building blogs, which is 1 short of 9."|"Fermat's Last Theorem"|"Simon Singh"
00:00|midnight|"The story begins with Wolfskehl’s obsession with a beautiful woman, whose identity has never been established. Depressingly for Wolfskehl the mysterious woman rejected him and he was left in such a state of utter despair that he decided to commit suicide. He was a passionate man, but not impetuous, and he planned his death with meticulous detail. He set a date for his suicide and would shoot himself through the head at the stroke of midnight. In the days that remained he settled all his outstanding business affairs, and on the final day he wrote his will and composed letters to all his close friends and family."|"Fermat's Last Theorem"|"Simon Singh"
00:00|midnight|"Wolfskehl had been so efficient that everything was completed slightly ahead of his midnight deadline, so to while away the hours he went to the library and began browsing through the mathematical publications. It was not long before he found himself staring at Kummer’s classic paper explaining the failure of Cauchy and Lamé. It was one of the great calculations of the age and suitable reading for the final moments of a suicidal mathematician. Wolfskehl worked through the calculation line by line. Suddenly he was startled at what appeared to be a gap in the logic – Kummer had made an assumption and failed to justify a step in his argument. Wolfskehl wondered whether he had uncovered a serious flaw or whether Kummer’s assumption was justified. If the former were true, then there was a chance that proving Fermat’s Last Theorem might be a good deal easier than many had presumed."|"Fermat's Last Theorem"|"Simon Singh"
12:00|noon|"A prize of $1,000, offered for the first correct solution to the problem, has never been claimed, although there are thousands of persons who say they performed the required feat. People became infatuated with the puzzle and ludicrous tales are told of shopkeepers who neglected to open their stores; of a distinguished clergyman who stood under a street lamp all through a wintry night trying to recall the way he had performed the feat. The mysterious feature of the puzzle is that none seem to be able to remember the sequence of moves whereby they feel sure they succeeded in solving the puzzle. Pilots are said to have wrecked their ships, and engineers rushed their trains past stations. A famous Baltimore editor tells how he went for his noon lunch and was discovered by his frantic staff long past midnight pushing little pieces of pie around on a plate!

Loyd was always confident that he would never have to pay out the $1,000 because he knew that it is impossible to swap just two pieces without destroying the order elsewhere in the puzzle. In the same way that a mathematician can prove that a particular equation has no solutions, Loyd could prove that his ‘14–15’ puzzle is insoluble."|"Fermat's Last Theorem"|"Simon Singh"

"ap 05:00"|5|"Earlier we saw how numbers can be thought of as marks along the number line which extends to infinity, as shown in Figure 13. To make the number space finite, clock arithmetic involves truncating the line and looping it back on itself to form a number ring as opposed to a number line. Figure 14 shows a 5-clock, where the number line has been truncated at 5 and looped back to 0. The number 5 vanishes and becomes equivalent to 0, and therefore the only numbers in 5-clock arithmetic are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4."|"Fermat's Last Theorem"|"Simon Singh"

00:00|0|"As well as addition we can perform all the other common mathematical operations, such as multiplication. In 12-clock arithmetic 5 × 7 = 11. This multiplication can be thought of as follows: if you start at 0, then move along 5 lots of 7 spaces, you will eventually arrive at 11. Although this is one way of thinking about multiplication in clock arithmetic, there are short cuts which speed up calculations. For example, to calculate 5 × 7 in 12-clock arithmetic, we can begin by just working out the normal result which is 35. We then divide 35 by 12 and work out the remainder, which is the answer to the original question. So 12 goes into 35 only twice, with a remainder of 11, and sure enough 5 × 7 in 12-clock arithmetic is 11. This is equivalent to imagining going around the clock twice and still having 11 spaces to travel."|"Fermat's Last Theorem"|"Simon Singh"

17:00|"five o’clock in the afternoon"|"Suddenly, in the midst of a private conversation which I was carrying on with the person on my left, the name Louis-Phillipe, followed by five or six whistles, caught my ear. I turned around. One of the most animated scenes was taking place fifteen or twenty seats from me. It would be difficult to find in all Paris two hundred persons more hostile to the government than those to be found reunited at five o’clock in the afternoon in the long hall on the ground floor above the garden.A young man who had raised his glass and held an open dagger in the same hand was trying to make himself heard – Evariste Galois was one of the most ardent republicans. The noise was such that the very reason for this noise had become incomprehensible. All that I could perceive was that there was a threat and that the name of Louis-Phillipe had been mentioned: the intention was made clear by the open knife.This went way beyond my own republican opinions. I yielded to the pressure from my neighbour on the left who, as one of the King’s comedians, didn’t care to be compromised, and we jumped from the window sill into the garden. I went home somewhat worried. It was clear this episode would have its consequences. Indeed, two or three days later, Evariste Galois was arrested.

After being detained at Sainte-Pélagie prison for a month Galois was charged with threatening the King’s life and brought to trial. Although there was little doubt from his actions that Galois was guilty, the raucous nature of the banquet meant that nobody could actually confirm that they had heard him make any direct threats. A sympathetic jury and the rebel’s tender age – he was still only twenty – led to his acquittal. The following month he was arrested again."|"Fermat's Last Theorem"|"Simon Singh"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"Once the lecture series was over Wiles devoted all his efforts to completing the proof. He had successfully applied the Kolyvagin–Flach method to family after family of elliptic equations, and by this stage only one family refused to submit to the technique. Wiles describes how he attempted to complete the last element of the proof: ‘One morning in late May, Nada was out with the children and I was sitting at my desk thinking about the remaining family of elliptic equations. I was casually looking at a paper of Barry Mazur’s and there was one sentence there that just caught my attention. It mentioned a nineteenth-century construction, and I suddenly realised that I should be able to use that to make the Kolyvagin–Flach method work on the final family of elliptic equations. I went on into the afternoon and I forgot to go down for lunch, and by about three or four o’clock I was really convinced that this would solve the last remaining problem. It got to about tea-time and I went downstairs and Nada was very surprised that I’d arrived so late. Then I told her – I’d solved Fermat’s Last Theorem.’"|"Fermat's Last Theorem"|"Simon Singh"
"ap 03:00"|"3 o’clock"|"Meanwhile back in the mathematics department the gossip continued. Princeton mathematician Professor John H. Conway remembers the atmosphere in the department’s tea-room: ‘We’d gather for tea at 3 o’clock and make a rush for the cookies. Sometimes we’d discuss mathematical problems, sometimes we’d discuss the O.J. Simpson trial, and sometimes we’d discuss Andrew’s progress. Because nobody actually liked to come out and ask him how he’s getting on with the proof, we were behaving a little bit like Kremlinologists. So somebody would say: “I saw Andrew this morning” – “Did he smile?” – “Well, yes, but he didn’t look too happy.” We could only gauge his feelings by his face.’"|"Fermat's Last Theorem"|"Simon Singh"
