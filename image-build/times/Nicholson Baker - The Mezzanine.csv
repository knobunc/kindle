"ap < 01:00"|"ALMOST ONE O’CLOCK"|"AT ALMOST ONE O’CLOCK I entered the lobby of the building where I worked and turned toward the escalators, carrying a black Penguin paperback and a small white CVS bag, its receipt stapled over the top. The escalators rose toward the mezzanine, where my office was. They were the freestanding kind: a pair of integral signs swooping upward between the two floors they served without struts or piers to bear any intermediate weight. On sunny days like this one, a temporary, steeper escalator of daylight, formed by intersections of the lobby’s towering volumes of marble and glass, met the real escalators just above their middle point, spreading into a needly area of shine where it fell against their brushed-steel side-panels, and adding long glossy highlights to each of the black rubber handrails which wavered slightly as the handrails slid on their tracks, like the radians of black luster that ride the undulating outer edge of an LP.1"|"The Mezzanine"|"Nicholson Baker"
"ap < 00:00"|"a few minutes before twelve"|"At a few minutes before twelve, I stopped working, threw out my earplugs and, more carefully, the remainder of my morning coffee—placing it upright within the converging spinnakers of the trash can liner on the base of the receptacle itself. I stapled a copy of a memo someone had cc:’d me on to a copy of an earlier memo I had written on the same subject, and wrote at the top to my manager, in my best casual scrawl, “Abe—should I keep hammering on these people or drop it?” I put the stapled papers in one of my Eldon trays, not sure whether I would forward them to Abelardo or not. Then I slipped my shoe back on by flipping it on its side, hooking it with my foot, and shaking it into place. I accomplished all this by foot-feel; and when I crouched forward, over the papers on my desk, to reach the untied shoelace, I experienced a faint surge of pride in being able to tie a shoe without looking at it. At that moment, Dave, Sue, and Steve, on their way to lunch, waved as they passed by my office. Right in the middle of tying a shoe as I was, I couldn’t wave nonchalantly back, so I called out a startled, overhearty “Have a good one, guys!” They disappeared; I pulled the left shoelace tight, and bingo, it broke."|"The Mezzanine"|"Nicholson Baker"
12:00|midday|"I moistened the splayed threads of the snapped-off piece and twirled them gently into a damp, unwholesome minaret. Breathing steadily and softly through my nose, I was able to guide the saliva-sharpened leader thread through the eyelet without too much trouble. And then I grew uncertain. In order for the shoelaces to have worn to the breaking point on almost the same day, they would have had to be tied almost exactly the same number of times. But when Dave, Sue, and Steve passed my office door, I had been in the middle of tying one shoe—one shoe only. And in the course of a normal day it wasn’t at all unusual for one shoe to come untied independent of the other. In the morning, of course, you always tied both shoes, but random midday comings-undone would have to have constituted a significant proportion of the total wear on both of these broken laces, I felt—possibly thirty percent. And how could I be positive that this thirty percent was equally distributed—that right and left shoes had come randomly undone over the last two years with the same frequency?"|"The Mezzanine"|"Nicholson Baker"

I was always touched when, out of a morning’s worth of repetition, secretaries continued to answer with good mornings for an hour or so into the afternoon, just as people often date things with the previous year well into February; sometimes they caught their mistake and went into a “This is not my day” or “Where is my head?” escape routine; but in a way they were right, since the true tone of afternoons does not take over in offices until nearly two."|"The Mezzanine"|"Nicholson Baker"

21:00|"nine in the evening"|"2 There are two ideal ways to wind up a light conversation with a coworker; one is with a little near-joke, and the other is with the exchange of a piece of useful information. The first is more common, but the second is preferable. The chat with Tina was the longest conversation I had had yet that day (and, as it turned out, was to have that day, until L. called at nine in the evening—more than enough talk, though, oddly enough, to satisfy my midweek socializing instincts); and I was pleased that it had ended with her telling me that I could get shoelaces at CVS. It made us both feel we were moving ahead in our lives: at random, on errands of her own, she had learned something that other people apparently didn’t know, and she was now passing the knowledge on to me."|"The Mezzanine"|"Nicholson Baker"
"~ 07:45"|"about 7:45 in the morning"|"Yet, though it is true that my thoughts about escalators now are composed of up to seventy or eighty percent of this kind of kid-memory, I have lately become increasingly uncomfortable about including it in descriptions of the things I love—and it was only a few weeks ago, several years after the escalator ride that is the vehicle of this memoir, that I reached a somewhat firmer position on the whole issue. I was driving south, in the middle lane of a wide highway, at about 7:45 in the morning, on a very blue, bright, snowless day in winter, on my way to the job that I had taken after leaving my job with the department on the mezzanine.1 I had the sun-visor flap swung over to shield me from direct sunlight, which was hot on the left—in fact, I had extended the shade-range of the sun-visor (that beautiful aileron, notched in one corner to clear the rearview mirror) by slipping a manila folder over it—so the sky in front of me was filled with an excellent, pure blue, while no sun fell directly on me to make me squint. Cars and trucks around mine were all nicely spaced: close enough to create a sense of fellowship and shared purpose, but not close enough to make you think that you couldn’t swerve exuberantly into another lane at any time if you wanted. I had the vertebrae of the steering wheel in my left hand and a Styrofoam cup of coffee with a special sipmaster top in my right."|"The Mezzanine"|"Nicholson Baker"
"ap > 09:00"|"past nine o’clock"|"I then began to wonder how late to work I was going to be. My own watch had been stolen by threat of force a week before, but I glanced hopefully down the diminishing perspective of hands and wrists that held the metal loops of the subway car. I spotted many watches, women’s and men’s, but on this particular morning they were all unreadable. The buckle, and not the face, of one pointed my way; some were too far off; the women’s were too small; several lacked all circumferential points of reference, and thus remained Necco wafers to all but their wearers; some were oriented so that glints from their crystals obscured the hands or the diodes beneath. A wristwatch less than a foot from my head, worn by a too carefully shaven man reading a newspaper folded into tiny segments, was exactly half visible; the half I needed was eclipsed by his cuff, so that while I could easily make out the terminal “get” of the tall-lettered trademark, the only time-telling I could do was to determine that it was not yet actually past nine o’clock. The cuff was possibly more expertly starched than my own."|"The Mezzanine"|"Nicholson Baker"
12:00|noontime|"Given all of these powerful, preexisting connections in my past life between escalators and shoelaces, you would expect that at the moment I boarded the escalator that afternoon, I would have been forcefully reminded of the problem of shoelace wear which had occupied me an hour earlier. But the determinism of reminding often works obscurely; and in this case the subject had already occurred to me and been laid aside in the few minutes I spent in the men’s room before lunch: following this recurrence, the subject didn’t arise until very recently, as I began to reconstitute the events of that noontime for this opusculum. Even after lunch, back in my office, as I tore open the stapled top of the CVS bag and pulled the bubble pack of new laces out and wove them into my shoes, zigzagging up every other eyelet with one lace-end, as shoe salesmen had shown me, a moment when I should certainly have been reminded of the subject, I was instead preoccupied with whether I should send off four hundred dollars to Chase Visa, or whether that was too big a chunk and would get me in trouble before my next biweekly paycheck, and I should send only two hundred. Just after lunch always seemed to be the time to think about practical things like bills—and I can’t help mentioning here the rarefied pleasure that I took in handling my finances back then: especially the pleasure of getting in the mail fat envelopes filled with charge statements and their receipts, the documentary history of that month, dinners out and odd purchases that you would have forgotten completely but for those slips, which nicely resurrect the moment of paying for you: you’re there in the restaurant, very full, an entire steak in your stomach, with your beloved darling, smiling and happy, your bottom by this time on fire from the unab-sorptivity of the vinyl seat, and you weigh whether or not to ask her help in calculating the tip—sometimes it is better to be the complete man and dash in a generous round sum, other times it is nice to confer with her about the shades between fifteen and twenty-two percent that evening’s waiter or waitress deserved—and you experience the pleasure of writing down the tip’s amount through several layers of carbon paper, bearing down hard against the little black tray the restaurant has provided to keep its compensation off the tablecloth, and then, once the totaling has been done and double-checked, you sign, more rapidly than you would sign a business letter because it doesn’t matter here what character traits people will read into your signature, and because wine makes you sign more fluently: you whip off most of your last name with the sort of accelerating wriggle that a vacuum cleaner cord makes in retracting into its coiled place of storage1—this moment of an evening’s closure returns to you entire, rightly sized down to something the size of that duplicate receipt, its carbon image less distinct and the name of the restaurant sometimes barely legible, to accord with its fading state in memory."|"The Mezzanine"|"Nicholson Baker"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"A SMALL, perhaps not very interesting question has troubled me occasionally: Is a lunch hour defined as beginning just as you enter the men’s room on the way to lunch, or just as you exit it? At the end of an earlier chapter, I instinctively said, “I stepped away toward the men’s room, and the lunch hour beyond”; and, right or wrong, this was how I saw the transition: the stop at the men’s room was of a piece with the morning’s work, a chore like the other business chores I was responsible for, and therefore, though it obviously didn’t help the company to make more money, it was part of my job in a way that the full hour of sunlight and sidewalks and pure volition was not. What that meant was that my company was as a rule paying me to make six visits a day1 to the men’s room—three in the morning, and three in the afternoon: my work was bounded and segmented by stops in this tiled decompression chamber, in which I adjusted my tie, made sure that my shirt was tucked in, cleared my throat, washed the newsprint from my hands, and urinated onto a cake of strawberry deodorant resting in one of four wall-mounted porcelain gargoyles."|"The Mezzanine"|"Nicholson Baker"

"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"1 Although earplugs are essential for getting to sleep, they are useless later on, when you are awakened with night anxieties, and your brain is steeping in a bad fluorescent juice. I slept beautifully through college, but the new job brought regular insomnia, and with it a long period of trial and error, until I hit on the images that most consistently lured me back to sleep. I began with Monday Night at the Movies title sequences: a noun like “MEMORANDUM” or “CALAMARI” in huge three-dimensional curving letters, outlined with chrome edgework of lines and blinking stars, rotating on two axes. I meant myself to be asleep by the time I passed through the expanding O, or the dormer window of the A. This did not work for long. In the belief that images with more substance to them, and less abstract pattern, would encourage the dreaming state, I pictured myself driving in a low fast car, taking off from an aircraft carrier in a low fast plane, or twisting water from a towel in a flooded basement. The plane worked best, but it didn’t work well. And then, surprised that I had taken so long to think of it, I remembered the convention of counting sheep. In Disney cartoons a little scene of sheep springing lightly over a stile or a picket fence appears in a thought-cloud above the man in the bed, while on the soundtrack violins accompany a soft voice out of 78 records saying, “One, two, three, four . . .” I thought of story conferences in Disney studios back in the golden days of cartoons: the look of benign concentration on the crouching animator’s face as he carefully colored in the outline of a suspended stylized sheep one frame farther along in its arc, warm light from his clamp-on drafting-table lamp shining over the pushpins and masking tape and the special acetate pencil in his hand—I was soon successfully asleep. But though this Disney version achieved its purpose, it felt unsatisfactory: I was imagining sheep, true, but the convention, which I wanted to uphold, called for counting them. Yet I didn’t feel that there was any point to counting what was obviously the same set of animated frames recycled over and over. I needed to pierce through the cartoon, and create a procession of truly differentiable sheep for myself. So I homed in on each one in its approach to the hurdle and looked for individuating features—some thistle prominently caught, or a bit of dried mud on a shank. Some times I strapped a number on the next one to jump and gave him a Kentucky Derby name: Brunch Commander, Nosferatu, I Before E, Wee Willie Winkie. And I made him take the jump very slowly, so that I could study every phase of it—the crumbs of airborne dirt floating slowly toward the lens, the soft-lipped grimace, the ripple moving through the wool on landing. If I wasn’t off by then, I backed up and reconstructed the sheep’s entire day; for I found that it was the approach to the jump, rather than the jump itself, that was sleep-inducing. Some sheep had probably reported for work around noon several towns over, tousled and fractious. Around two in the afternoon, while at my office, expecting a rough night, I had (I imagined) placed a call to one of the shepherd-dispatchers: Could she send out some random number of sheep not larger than thirty to arrive outside my apartment by 3:30 A.M., for counting? The practiced crook of the sheep dispatcher travels over her herd, pointing: “You, you, you”; she repeats my address again and again to her nodding subjects; and my personal flock departs fifteen minutes later, with a voucher to be signed on arrival. All that afternoon they cross village greens, wade brooks, and trot along the median valleys of highways. While I am eating dinner with L., they are still miles away, but by bedtime, 11:30 P.M., I can spot them with my binoculars coming over a rise: tiny bobbing shapes next to a foreshortened Red Roof Inn sign, still in the next county. And at 3:30 A.M., when I need them badly, they bustle up, exhilarated from their journey: I put aside the unwritten thank-you letter I have been writhing over, log the sheep in and pay them off, and the first few begin lofting themselves over the planks and milk crates I have assembled out front, their small pink tongues visible with the effort, the whites of their sheep eyes showing; one, two, three . . . and then I have become a very successful director of fabric-softener commercials—the agency needs lush shots of jumping sheep; their fleece has to read as golden in the failing sunlight, and the greens of the countryside have to be inconceivably full-throated. I shampoo each sheep myself; I comfort the weepers; I read to the assembled flock from Cardinal Newman’s Idea of a University to heighten their sense of purpose and grace, and I demonstrate to them how I need them to send their plump torsos airborne, hike up their rear legs for an added boost, throw their heads back for drama, and always, always lead in their landing with the left forehoof. I give them their cue through a rolled-up script: “Okay, number four. Lighter footfalls. Now thrust. Up. And the rear legs! More teeth! Show strain! Now some nostril! And over!” Lately I have found that the last thing in my mind before resumed unconsciousness is often the dwindling sight of one lone sheep, who, having cleared my hurdle and been checked off, full of relief and the glow of accomplishment, is hurrying over farther hills to his next assignment, which is to leap an herbal border in slow motion for L., awake with worries of her own beside me."|"The Mezzanine"|"Nicholson Baker"

And at 3:30 A.M., when I need them badly, they bustle up, exhilarated from their journey: I put aside the unwritten thank-you letter I have been writhing over, log the sheep in and pay them off, and the first few begin lofting themselves over the planks and milk crates I have assembled out front, their small pink tongues visible with the effort, the whites of their sheep eyes showing; one, two, three . . . and then I have become a very successful director of fabric-softener commercials—the agency needs lush shots of jumping sheep; their fleece has to read as golden in the failing sunlight, and the greens of the countryside have to be inconceivably full-throated. I shampoo each sheep myself; I comfort the weepers; I read to the assembled flock from Cardinal Newman’s Idea of a University to heighten their sense of purpose and grace, and I demonstrate to them how I need them to send their plump torsos airborne, hike up their rear legs for an added boost, throw their heads back for drama, and always, always lead in their landing with the left forehoof. I give them their cue through a rolled-up script: “Okay, number four. Lighter footfalls. Now thrust. Up. And the rear legs! More teeth! Show strain! Now some nostril! And over!” Lately I have found that the last thing in my mind before resumed unconsciousness is often the dwindling sight of one lone sheep, who, having cleared my hurdle and been checked off, full of relief and the glow of accomplishment, is hurrying over farther hills to his next assignment, which is to leap an herbal border in slow motion for L., awake with worries of her own beside me."|"The Mezzanine"|"Nicholson Baker"
23:30|"11:30 P.M."|"1 Although earplugs are essential for getting to sleep, they are useless later on, when you are awakened with night anxieties, and your brain is steeping in a bad fluorescent juice. I slept beautifully through college, but the new job brought regular insomnia, and with it a long period of trial and error, until I hit on the images that most consistently lured me back to sleep. I began with Monday Night at the Movies title sequences: a noun like “MEMORANDUM” or “CALAMARI” in huge three-dimensional curving letters, outlined with chrome edgework of lines and blinking stars, rotating on two axes. I meant myself to be asleep by the time I passed through the expanding O, or the dormer window of the A. This did not work for long. In the belief that images with more substance to them, and less abstract pattern, would encourage the dreaming state, I pictured myself driving in a low fast car, taking off from an aircraft carrier in a low fast plane, or twisting water from a towel in a flooded basement. The plane worked best, but it didn’t work well. And then, surprised that I had taken so long to think of it, I remembered the convention of counting sheep. In Disney cartoons a little scene of sheep springing lightly over a stile or a picket fence appears in a thought-cloud above the man in the bed, while on the soundtrack violins accompany a soft voice out of 78 records saying, “One, two, three, four . . .” I thought of story conferences in Disney studios back in the golden days of cartoons: the look of benign concentration on the crouching animator’s face as he carefully colored in the outline of a suspended stylized sheep one frame farther along in its arc, warm light from his clamp-on drafting-table lamp shining over the pushpins and masking tape and the special acetate pencil in his hand—I was soon successfully asleep. But though this Disney version achieved its purpose, it felt unsatisfactory: I was imagining sheep, true, but the convention, which I wanted to uphold, called for counting them. Yet I didn’t feel that there was any point to counting what was obviously the same set of animated frames recycled over and over. I needed to pierce through the cartoon, and create a procession of truly differentiable sheep for myself. So I homed in on each one in its approach to the hurdle and looked for individuating features—some thistle prominently caught, or a bit of dried mud on a shank. Some times I strapped a number on the next one to jump and gave him a Kentucky Derby name: Brunch Commander, Nosferatu, I Before E, Wee Willie Winkie. And I made him take the jump very slowly, so that I could study every phase of it—the crumbs of airborne dirt floating slowly toward the lens, the soft-lipped grimace, the ripple moving through the wool on landing. If I wasn’t off by then, I backed up and reconstructed the sheep’s entire day; for I found that it was the approach to the jump, rather than the jump itself, that was sleep-inducing. Some sheep had probably reported for work around noon several towns over, tousled and fractious. Around two in the afternoon, while at my office, expecting a rough night, I had (I imagined) placed a call to one of the shepherd-dispatchers: Could she send out some random number of sheep not larger than thirty to arrive outside my apartment by 3:30 A.M., for counting? The practiced crook of the sheep dispatcher travels over her herd, pointing: “You, you, you”; she repeats my address again and again to her nodding subjects; and my personal flock departs fifteen minutes later, with a voucher to be signed on arrival. All that afternoon they cross village greens, wade brooks, and trot along the median valleys of highways. While I am eating dinner with L., they are still miles away, but by bedtime, 11:30 P.M., I can spot them with my binoculars coming over a rise: tiny bobbing shapes next to a foreshortened Red Roof Inn sign, still in the next county.

12:00|noon|"1 I am fairly certain now that shoelaces will rank higher. In the course of preparing the present record of that Aurelius-and-shoelace noon, I lived through a rigorous month in which the subject of shoelace-tying and shoelace wear came up 325 times, whereas Aurelius’s sentiment cycled around only 90 times. I doubt very much that I will ever concentrate on either of them again, having worn both of the thoughts out for myself. But these sudden later flurries may not count, since they are artificial duplicative retrievals performed in order to understand how the earlier natural retrievals had come about. The very last instance of shoelace thought happened as follows: by chance, I was flipping through the 1984–1986 Research Reports of MIT’s Laboratory for Manufacturing and Productivity at my office, and I noticed that there was active work going forward on the subject of the “pathology of worn ropes.” The research was described as follows:"|"The Mezzanine"|"Nicholson Baker"
