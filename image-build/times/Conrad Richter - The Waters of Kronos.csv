Like the time we had to dig two graves in one day and they got Bob Bender and Ike Zerbe to dig the other one. Bob had his bottle along and when Check here and me went over and seen what they dug, we had to go to the preacher. ‘You got to get that straightened out tonight, Parra’ we told him. ‘There ain’t no coffin made’ll ever fit that grave.’ It was hooked like a sickle. Yep, bent like a quarter-moon. But we got to get home, mister. They lock the gate up here at five thirty.”"|"The Waters of Kronos"|"Conrad Richter"
"> 18:00"|"after six o’clock in the evening"|"He started up the Methodist church hill. How incredibly quiet and peaceful it was. Nothing had changed. The sidewalk, moist and slippery as when he was a boy, still shone faintly in the darkness, reflecting unseen light. You had to lift your feet to keep from stumbling over the unpredictable bulges where unseen roots had lifted the bricks in giant mole-like waves. He passed the house of Mr. Nagle, chief clerk for the Markles, who owned Primrose Colliery. It had the peculiar dreamlike look of certain houses when he was young, of importance without and hushed withdrawal from the world within. Across the street the white horse of Dr. Sypher, who had brought him into the world, stood hitched to the buggy, head drooping, perhaps asleep. At the top of the hill was the old post office, tinier than ever in its square boxlike building that had once been a squire’s office. It must be after six o’clock in the evening but the stamp window was still up, with Katie Gerber calmly reading someone’s paper behind the partition of call and lock boxes. No one was visible on the public side. In an hour it would be jammed with townspeople chatting to each other, waiting for the seven-thirty mail from Lebanon to be “changed,” everyone keeping an eye on his or her box not to miss when a letter or paper might be popped in."|"The Waters of Kronos"|"Conrad Richter"

"ap 06:00"|"six-o’clock"|"He tried not to look at Aunt Jess as he made his way down the hall after Aunt Teresa into the sitting room, to be swallowed up in the past, in a distillation of feelings, slow time and the genes of mortality that few houses have today. It was as it had always been, the yellow oak chairs and buffet, the deep windows, the cubbyhole closets and the door that led out to the children’s schoolroom. There were the same smells, of old leatherbound books, of cigar ashes, of the Rayo lamp and from the kitchen below. On a chair by the lamp sat Uncle Dick, thin, stiff and faintly contemptuous as ever, the Evening Bulletin that had come on the six-o’clock train up defensively before him."|"The Waters of Kronos"|"Conrad Richter"
"ap 06:30"|"six thirty"|"“I wonder,” the old stranger said, “if I could get a sandwich and a glass of beer.”
“Supper’s over,” Jake told him. “Dining room closes at six thirty.”
“I know,” John Donner said, remembering that meals were early in Unionville, dinner often at eleven and supper at four or five. “But I’ve walked pretty far and am a little shaky.”"|"The Waters of Kronos"|"Conrad Richter"
"ap 08:55"|"eight fifty-five"|"Some of the stores were closing but the depot remained open and lighted, waiting for the eight fifty-five from Auburn, the last train till the early miners’ train in the morning. John Donner was grateful for the open waiting room. He felt a little peace here in this house that belonged to an absentee landlord and was free from the pressures of the personally occupied. Nobody resented his presence or showed that he wished him to leave. The very look of the benches was impersonal, meant for transients such as he and the two old men smoking and talking with long lapses of silence in this pleasant retreat shot with the scent of travel and far places and the sudden chatter of the telegraph instrument."|"The Waters of Kronos"|"Conrad Richter"
16:00|"four in the afternoon"|"The beast turned his head and the great dark orbs observed him. It was Mike, the old retainer, whom Pap-pa had kept so long. As a boy John Donner had played in his stall, climbed on his back, ducked between his legs, had thought this horse wiser than most men, a beast who could tell the time of day. The afternoon mail came to Unionville at four in the afternoon. If Pap-pa returned to town after this time, the horse went to the post office and stopped. If earlier, Mike went straight to the stable."|"The Waters of Kronos"|"Conrad Richter"
03:00|"three o’clock in the morning"|"Wasn’t it curious that now at this gloomy time he should think of some of his grandfather’s funeral stories, especially the one about Manny Keefer, typically Pennsylvania Dutch. He told Pap-pa that when he died he wanted to be buried north and south instead of east and west like everybody else in the cemetery. He didn’t want to have to get awake and sit up to see the sun shine in his face on resurrection morn. He would sooner sleep. That was something he had never had enough of. For thirty years he had had to get up at three o’clock in the morning and walk four miles to town to catch the early miners’ train. He was tired and if resurrection came before he got rested, he’d be “grichlich.” It was a long entertaining story full of Manny’s talk together with what his wife said and what Pap-pa and the grave digger said. John Donner seemed to see and hear his grandfather telling it now with his unreadable face and those peculiar motions of his long arms to relieve his inner enjoyment."|"The Waters of Kronos"|"Conrad Richter"

"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"Once eleven o’clock struck, hope in him would start to rise. He would lie listening for the first footfall in the late street. Mrs. Feezer, a little gray woman like a pouter pigeon, always left Guild early, his mother said. He knew her by her very fast steps, pat, pat, pat, down the dark bricks. Now there was silence again. What he waited to hear was his father bidding good night to the Whetstones. His voice a square away was unmistakable, even on winter nights with the window tightly closed, but the child would not let himself wholly believe or rejoice until the front door opened and he heard the other, the indispensable, voice downstairs."|"The Waters of Kronos"|"Conrad Richter"

I can tell Harry Donner’s shirts anyplace once he’s wore them. His handkerchiefs, too. His clothes don’t smell like other men’s clothes. You got the same smell.”"|"The Waters of Kronos"|"Conrad Richter"
