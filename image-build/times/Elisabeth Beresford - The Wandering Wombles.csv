11:25|"11.25 hours"|"At round about the same time that all this was going on Wellington and Tomsk were also having their fair share of trouble. At 11.25 hours they had been deposited by Tobermory at Constitution Hill to one side of Buckingham Palace. It was, of course, a moonless night, just as it was in Scotland and, as the street lighting was not very bright in this part of London, Tobermory began to have faint hopes that Tomsk might just pass for a Grenadier Guardsman after all."|"The Wandering Wombles"|"Elisabeth Beresford"
"ap 07:30"|"seven thirty"|"‘Well, I suppose it’ll be all right,’ said Tobermory doubtfully. ‘I’ll be back at seven thirty sharp. You haven’t got long in which to work, young Wellington, so make the best of it and good luck. Remember, in an emergency you can use the Underground.’"|"The Wandering Wombles"|"Elisabeth Beresford"
"ap < 07:30"|"nearly half past seven"|"‘Oh, don’t worry about that now,’ said Wellington, who was tired out and suffering from a deep disappointment. ‘It’s nearly half past seven and Tobermory’ll be here soon and I’ve got to fill up this beastly, rotten tunnel.’"|"The Wandering Wombles"|"Elisabeth Beresford"
00:00|midnight|"At midnight Miss Adelaide and Tobermory set off in the Silver Womble. All the working Wombles, who were out on the Common clearing up the litter which had been left behind by the Human Beings earlier in the day, waved to them as they purred past and Miss Adelaide bowed graciously."|"The Wandering Wombles"|"Elisabeth Beresford"
01:00|"01.00 hours"|"‘So at 01.00 hours, that is,’ Great Uncle Bulgaria corrected himself as he realised that none of the Wombles present, except Madame Cholet, Wellington and Tomsk, would know what he meant, ‘at one o’clock tomorrow morning we shall start moving out of the burrow and into our new quarters.’"|"The Wandering Wombles"|"Elisabeth Beresford"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"‘So at 01.00 hours, that is,’ Great Uncle Bulgaria corrected himself as he realised that none of the Wombles present, except Madame Cholet, Wellington and Tomsk, would know what he meant, ‘at one o’clock tomorrow morning we shall start moving out of the burrow and into our new quarters.’"|"The Wandering Wombles"|"Elisabeth Beresford"
21:00|"21.00 hours"|"‘But, even if we reach the heights of Hampstead and the forests of Epping, Outer Bromley or,’ and Great Uncle Bulgaria bowed slightly, ‘the Royal grounds of Windsor, we must never forget that we are the Wombles of Wimbledon Common. And every year we shall be united, as a family, at our Midsummer party. That is all I have to say. Now you may all dismiss. We shall all gather again at 21.00 hours, at nine o’clock that is, for final orders.’"|"The Wandering Wombles"|"Elisabeth Beresford"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"‘But, even if we reach the heights of Hampstead and the forests of Epping, Outer Bromley or,’ and Great Uncle Bulgaria bowed slightly, ‘the Royal grounds of Windsor, we must never forget that we are the Wombles of Wimbledon Common.

We shall all gather again at 21.00 hours, at nine o’clock that is, for final orders.’"|"The Wandering Wombles"|"Elisabeth Beresford"
01:00|"one o’clock in the morning"|"It was not, of course, to be expected that everything should go entirely smoothly, as it is no small thing to move a whole colony of Wombles across London from Wimbledon Common to Hyde Park without anything going wrong. Even at one o’clock in the morning there are still quite a number of Human Beings about and several of them, particularly policemen, were a bit startled. One of them went so far as to stop Great Uncle Bulgaria on Albert Bridge."|"The Wandering Wombles"|"Elisabeth Beresford"
05:00|"five o’clock in the morning"|"It was five o’clock in the morning before the last of the Wombles had arrived in Hyde Park. They were all very sleepy by this time and as for Wellington, he was like a jelly, because for the last two hours he had been having terrible doubts as to whether what he had discovered in the old papers and books in the library (Operations Room) was right after all."|"The Wandering Wombles"|"Elisabeth Beresford"
00:00|midnight|"Great Uncle Bulgaria’s curiosity was soon to be satisfied, but, as he didn’t know that of course, he decided to try and calm the worries of the Wombles by putting up a suggestion box as to where they should hold their Midsummer party this year. Naturally all the Wombles who had signed the paper saying they wished to return to Wimbledon Common one day, wrote Wimbledon Common. There were several votes for Regent’s Park, one (from Wellington) advocating the gardens at Buckingham Palace and a number who were in favour of repeating a trip to Battersea fun-fair, where they had once had a most successful outing. The majority, however, feeling that they had had enough wandering for a while, were solidly behind the idea of having a midnight boating party on the Serpentine with races, water sports and a diving competition from the bridge."|"The Wandering Wombles"|"Elisabeth Beresford"
22:00|"22.00 hours"|"‘Sorry,’ he said in his turn, ‘but I’m on duty at 22.00 hours. Musn’t be late, you know, or I shall find myself on standing orders.’"|"The Wandering Wombles"|"Elisabeth Beresford"
"ap 10:30"|"half past ten"|"‘How should I know until it happens?’ snapped Great Uncle Bulgaria. ‘You can’t say next week there will be an emergency on Tuesday morning at half past ten. An emergency is something unexpected like an earthquake or the roof falling in.’"|"The Wandering Wombles"|"Elisabeth Beresford"
09:00|"09.00 hours"|"‘He’ll have to like it,’ replied Great Uncle Bulgaria. ‘I shall see them both at 09.00 hours tomorrow. The meeting’s now closed.’"|"The Wandering Wombles"|"Elisabeth Beresford"
14:00|"14.00 hours"|"‘You will be taken off Common-tidying,’ said Great Uncle Bulgaria, ‘and I shall announce that like Tobermory, Wellington and myself you have been posted to Special Duties. Or SD as we shall now call them. From this moment you will be OWW, SD 4 and 5. You will start your training at 14.00 hours. Tobermory will be your instructor. Any questions?’"|"The Wandering Wombles"|"Elisabeth Beresford"
14:00|"14.00 hours"|"Bungo, who was hastily working out what time 14.00 hours was on his paws, shook his head, but Orinoco, who didn’t at all care for the word ‘training’, timidly asked what it meant."|"The Wandering Wombles"|"Elisabeth Beresford"
"ap 01:02"|One-two|"‘One-two, one-two,’ ordered Tobermory, riding along beside them on Orinoco’s old bicycle. ‘Keep those knees up. One-two, one-two.’"|"The Wandering Wombles"|"Elisabeth Beresford"
"ap 01:02"|One-two|"‘One-two, one-two,’ chanted Tobermory, who was waiting beside Queen’s Mere with another useful little book he had got out of the library. Unfortunately some of the middle pages were missing so that it went straight from simple life-saving to advanced diving, but then, as Tobermory so rightly said, Wombles can’t be choosers."|"The Wandering Wombles"|"Elisabeth Beresford"
"ap 01:02"|one-two|"‘Not bad,’ he said. ‘Back to the burrow for motor-scooter drill, one-two, one-two . . .’"|"The Wandering Wombles"|"Elisabeth Beresford"
"ap 06:30"|"six thirty"|"‘And in the notebook,’ said Tobermory, who felt he’d been left out of things for quite long enough, ‘is the telephone number of a call box near this Common. You will please ring me there at six thirty tomorrow evening to report any news. Also . . .’"|"The Wandering Wombles"|"Elisabeth Beresford"
"ap 06:25"|"twenty-five past six"|"‘I wonder if there are whales in it,’ said Orinoco. ‘It’s almost as big as a sea after all.’
‘I don’t think so. Come on, it’s twenty-five past six.’
Bungo’s paws were fairly shaking with excitement as he dialled the number, and then there was a poop-poop-poop sound and he put in the right money and the pooping stopped and Tobermory said right in his ear, ‘Well, young Womble?’"|"The Wandering Wombles"|"Elisabeth Beresford"
18:00|"18.00 hours"|"‘Report tomorrow at 18.00 hours and don’t go getting fanciful. Red deer won’t eat you. They’re vegetarians like we are. The OC sends his regards and . . .’"|"The Wandering Wombles"|"Elisabeth Beresford"
08:00|"08.00 hours"|"‘That’s a point. It can’t be another long journey such as Bungo and Orinoco have made. We must look for somewhere nearer home. Leave it to me, old friend. Just ask SD 3 and 6 to report to me at 08.00 hours.’"|"The Wandering Wombles"|"Elisabeth Beresford"
"ap 08:00"|"Eight o’clock"|"‘Eight o’clock tomorrow morning,’ said Tobermory. ‘Very well. It may not be as bad as I’ve made out.’ But he didn’t sound very sure of his own words and once Great Uncle Bulgaria was on his own, he shuffled back to his desk looking very old and frail indeed. He knew all about dangers and his fur had that faint prickly feel about it, which told him very plainly that his Wombles were in peril. He sat for a long while staring at the ceiling until, because he was very tired, he almost felt that he could see it bulging more and more."|"The Wandering Wombles"|"Elisabeth Beresford"
12:00|"12.00 hours"|"‘A fitting for some very special clothes,’ said Great Uncle Bulgaria patiently. ‘I’ve written it all down here. Take this paper along to Miss Adelaide and then do as she tells you. Wellington, I want you to study this map of the Underground and then go to the Workshop for supplies. Tobermory, here are copies of these orders for you. At 12.00 hours everybody is to report back to me. Is that clear?’"|"The Wandering Wombles"|"Elisabeth Beresford"
22:00|"22.00 hours"|"‘22.00 hours, that’s ten o’clock tonight. They’ll get caught, you’ll see. And locked up and questioned and then the newspapers’ll get hold of it and there’ll be a big Womble hunt. It’ll be the finish of us all.’"|"The Wandering Wombles"|"Elisabeth Beresford"
