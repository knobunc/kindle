"~ 12:00"|"ABOUT NOON"|"ABOUT NOON I STOPPED at the captain’s door with some cooling drinks and medicines. He was lying very much as we had left him, only a little higher, and he seemed both weak and excited."|"Treasure Island"|"Robert Louis Stevenson"
"ap ~ 03:00"|"about three o’clock"|"So things passed until, the day after the funeral, and about three o’clock of a bitter, foggy, frosty afternoon, I was standing at the door for a moment, full of sad thoughts about my father, when I saw someone drawing slowly near along the road. He was plainly blind, for he tapped before him with a stick and wore a great green shade over his eyes and nose; and he was hunched, as if with age or weakness, and wore a huge old tattered seacloak with a hood that made him appear positively deformed. I never saw in my life a more dreadful-looking figure. He stopped a little from the inn, and raising his voice in an odd sing-song, addressed the air in front of him. “Will any kind friend inform a poor blind man, who has lost the precious sight of his eyes in the gracious defence of his native country, England—and God bless King George!—where or in what part of this country he may now be?”"|"Treasure Island"|"Robert Louis Stevenson"
"ap 10:00"|"Ten o’clock"|"“Ten o’clock!” he cried. “Six hours. We’ll do them yet,” and he sprang to his feet."|"Treasure Island"|"Robert Louis Stevenson"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"I went down on my knees at once. On the floor close to his hand there was a little round of paper, blackened on the one side. I could not doubt that this was the black spot; and taking it up, I found written on the other side, in a very good, clear hand, this short message: “You have till ten tonight.”"|"Treasure Island"|"Robert Louis Stevenson"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"“He had till ten, Mother,” said I; and just as I said it, our old clock began striking. This sudden noise startled us shockingly; but the news was good, for it was only six."|"Treasure Island"|"Robert Louis Stevenson"
"ap 06:00"|six|"“He had till ten, Mother,” said I; and just as I said it, our old clock began striking. This sudden noise startled us shockingly; but the news was good, for it was only six."|"Treasure Island"|"Robert Louis Stevenson"
12:00|noonday|"“The thing is as clear as noonday,” cried the squire. “This is the black-hearted hound’s account-book. These crosses stand for the names of ships or towns that they sank or plundered. The sums are the scoundrel’s share, and where he feared an ambiguity, you see he added something clearer. ‘Offe Caraccas,’ now; you see, here was some unhappy vessel boarded off that coast. God help the poor souls that manned her—coral long ago.”"|"Treasure Island"|"Robert Louis Stevenson"
16:00|"four this afternoon"|"“All hands aboard by four this afternoon,” shouted the squire after him."|"Treasure Island"|"Robert Louis Stevenson"
"ap 07:01"|"seven one"|"I began to feel pretty desperate at this, for I felt altogether helpless; and yet, by an odd train of circumstances, it was indeed through me that safety came. In the meantime, talk as we pleased, there were only seven out of the twenty-six on whom we knew we could rely; and out of these seven one was a boy, so that the grown men on our side were six to their nineteen."|"Treasure Island"|"Robert Louis Stevenson"
"ap ~ 01:30"|"ABOUT HALF past one"|"IT WAS ABOUT HALF past one—three bells in sea phrase—that the two boats went ashore from the Hispaniola. The captain, the squire, and I were talking matters over in the cabin. Had there been a breath of wind, we should have fallen on the six mutineers who were left aboard with us, slipped our cable, and away to sea. But the wind was wanting; and to complete our helplessness, down came Hunter with the news that Jim Hawkins had slipped into a boat and was gone ashore with the rest."|"Treasure Island"|"Robert Louis Stevenson"
"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"“And when? says you,” he added. “Why, from about noon observation to about six bells.”"|"Treasure Island"|"Robert Louis Stevenson"
"> 12:00"|"a little past noon"|"After dinner the squire and the doctor sat by the captain’s side while in consultation; and when they had talked to their hearts’ content, it being then a little past noon, the doctor took up his hat and pistols, girt on a cutlass, put the chart in his pocket, and with a musket over his shoulder crossed the palisade on the north side and set off briskly through the trees."|"Treasure Island"|"Robert Louis Stevenson"
12:00|midday|"I was right, as appeared later; but in the meantime, the house being stifling hot and the little patch of sand inside the palisade ablaze with midday sun, I began to get another thought into my head, which was not by any means so right. What I began to do was to envy the doctor walking in the cool shadow of the woods with the birds about him and the pleasant smell of the pines, while I sat grilling, with my clothes stuck to the hot resin, and so much blood about me and so many poor dead bodies lying all around that I took a disgust of the place that was almost as strong as fear."|"Treasure Island"|"Robert Louis Stevenson"
12:00|noon|"Well, as it seemed to me, there was some sense in this. We struck our bargain on the spot. In three minutes I had the Hispaniola sailing easily before the wind along the coast of Treasure Island, with good hopes of turning the northern point ere noon and beating down again as far as North Inlet before high water, when we might beach her safely and wait till the subsiding tide permitted us to land."|"Treasure Island"|"Robert Louis Stevenson"
12:00|midday|"The other men were variously burthened, some carrying picks and shovels—for that had been the very first necessary they brought ashore from the Hispaniola—others laden with pork, bread, and brandy for the midday meal. All the stores, I observed, came from our stock, and I could see the truth of Silver’s words the night before. Had he not struck a bargain with the doctor, he and his mutineers, deserted by the ship, must have been driven to subsist on clear water and the proceeds of their hunting. Water would have been little to their taste; a sailor is not usually a good shot; and besides all that, when they were so short of eatables, it was not likely they would be very flush of powder."|"Treasure Island"|"Robert Louis Stevenson"
"ap < 02:00"|"nearly two"|"The first of the tall trees was reached, and by the bearing proved the wrong one. So with the second. The third rose nearly two hundred feet into the air above a clump of underwood—a giant of a vegetable, with a red column as big as a cottage, and a wide shadow around in which a company could have manoeuvred. It was conspicuous far to sea both on the east and west and might have been entered as a sailing mark upon the chart."|"Treasure Island"|"Robert Louis Stevenson"
"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"After that, we kept under cover of the bulwarks, and when next I looked out they had disappeared from the spit, and the spit itself had almost melted out of sight in the growing distance. That was, at least, the end of that; and before noon, to my inexpressible joy, the highest rock of Treasure Island had sunk into the blue round of sea."|"Treasure Island"|"Robert Louis Stevenson"
