""Two-fifteen A.M., Mrs. Gaines.""
How many people, she wondered, are alive on the face of Earth at this moment? One million? Two million? How many groups, playing The Game? Surely no more than a few hundred thousand. And every time there was a fatal accident, the population decreased irretrievably by one more."|"The Game-Players of Titan"|"Philip K. Dick"

A woman in our group, Mrs. Don Palmer, bit her rabbit-paper with no more idea of hoping than she ever did, and—"""|"The Game-Players of Titan"|"Philip K. Dick"

""About eleven, by now.""
""Christ!"" Pete said."|"The Game-Players of Titan"|"Philip K. Dick"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"Seated with the spinning device, Pete rolled. His first roll was a nine. To Carol he said, ""I'm doing the best I can."" In his voice there was an overtone of resentment. His new relationship, Freya saw, was getting into motion in the customary way. She smiled to herself. It was impossible not to take a measure of enjoyment in the situation.
Scowling, Pete rolled again. This time it was ten.
""We can't start playing anyhow,"" Janice Remington said brightly. ""We have to wait for Mr. Luckman to get here."""|"The Game-Players of Titan"|"Philip K. Dick"
"ap 01:30"|one-thirty|"""I tell you what,"" she said. ""I'll meet you this afternoon at one-thirty, in downtown San Francisco. At Market and Third. We can have lunch together.

"ap 01:30"|one-thirty|"""I'll see you at one-thirty,"" Pete said. ""At Third and Market."" Unless, he thought, the inchoate syndrome having to do with violence and death and Jerome Luckman becomes actual before then."|"The Game-Players of Titan"|"Philip K. Dick"

""About four.""
""A.M.?"" He couldn't believe it. How come the bar was still open? ""They don't allow bars open that late, in any state."""|"The Game-Players of Titan"|"Philip K. Dick"

""It'll be five A.M. when we get there.""

""At five-thirty in the morning?""
""Yes,"" he said, dialing. A long time passed; the phone, at the other end, rang and rang. "" 'Walkin' the dog see-bawh, see-bawh,'"" Pete sang. "" 'He have-um red whisker, he have-um green paw.'

05:30|"five-thirty in the morning"|"""Carol, I've known your husband for years. He has suicidal depressions. Regularly. To be blunt, dear, he's a manic-depressive; he has an affective psychosis, periodically. Tonight, because of the news about the baby, he's gone into a manic phase and I for one don't blame him. I know how it feels; it's like being reborn. I want him to call Hawthorne for a"" very good reason. Hawthorne has had more to do with vugs than anyone else we know. There's no use my talking to Pete; I don't know a damn thing about vugs; maybe they are all around us, for all I know. I'm not going to try to argue Pete out of it, especially at five-thirty in the morning. I suggest you follow the same course."""|"The Game-Players of Titan"|"Philip K. Dick"

It was past noon, now. Pete Garden had not returned
home and Joe Schilling knew that he was not going to. There was no point in contacting the other members of Pretty Blue Fox; Pete wasn't with any of them. Whoever had taken him lay outside the group."|"The Game-Players of Titan"|"Philip K. Dick"
