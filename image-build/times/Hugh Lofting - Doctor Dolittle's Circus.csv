11:00|"eleven in the morning"|"“All right, Mr. Smith,” said the showman. “Have your party ready by eleven in the morning. Good night.”"|"Doctor Dolittle's Circus"|"Hugh Lofting"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"Very early the next morning Dab-Dab had the whole house astir. She said breakfast must be eaten and the table cleared before seven, if everything was to be got in readiness for their departure by eleven."|"Doctor Dolittle's Circus"|"Hugh Lofting"
"~ 14:00"|"about two o’clock in the afternoon"|"They reached the Grimbledon Fair-grounds about two o’clock in the afternoon and entered the circus enclosure by a back gate. Inside they found the great Blossom himself, waiting to welcome them."|"Doctor Dolittle's Circus"|"Hugh Lofting"
14:00|"two in the afternoon"|"The main show took place only twice a day (at two in the afternoon and at six thirty at night), in a big tent in the middle of the enclosure. But all around this there were smaller tents and stands, most of which you had to pay extra to get into. Of these the Doctor’s establishment was now to form one. They contained all manner of wonders: shooting galleries; guessing games; wild men of Borneo; bearded ladies; merry-go-rounds; strong men, snake charmers; a menagerie and many more."|"Doctor Dolittle's Circus"|"Hugh Lofting"

"ap ~ 09:00"|"about nine o’clock"|"The circus reached Ashby about nine o’clock on a Wednesday evening. It was to open to the public the first thing the following morning. So all through that night, by the light of flares, the men were busy hoisting tents, setting up booths, and spreading tanbark. Even after the pushmi-pullyu’s stand was put together and the Doctor’s family retired to rest, no one got any sleep; for the ground still shook with the hammers driving pegs; and the air was full of shouts and the spirits of work, till the dusk of dawn crept over the roofs of Ashby and showed the city of canvas that had been built in a night."|"Doctor Dolittle's Circus"|"Hugh Lofting"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"“All right,” said Too-Too, preparing to depart. “Leave the window of the caravan open, so I can get in. I don’t suppose I shall be back much before two in the morning. So long!”"|"Doctor Dolittle's Circus"|"Hugh Lofting"
"ap 02:00"|two|"He got so interested in this he did not notice how the time was passing; till, somewhere between two and three in the morning he suddenly found Too-Too, the night bird, standing on the table before him."|"Doctor Dolittle's Circus"|"Hugh Lofting"

"ap ~ 10:00"|"About ten o’clock"|"About ten o’clock, when the circus was beginning to close up, Too-Too stationed himself on the top of the menagerie where he could see everything that went on. He had arranged with the elephant and the animals of the collection to start a rumpus in the menagerie on a given signal—to attract, if necessary, the attention of the circus men away from the escaping seal. Gub-Gub gave himself the job of watching Blossom, and he took up a post underneath the ringmaster’s private caravan."|"Doctor Dolittle's Circus"|"Hugh Lofting"
"< 13:00"|"near one o’clock in the afternoon"|"Well, Sophie was very brave and made the best of it. But, as the day wore on they both got ravenously hungry. Somewhere near one o’clock in the afternoon, Sophie, suddenly said:"|"Doctor Dolittle's Circus"|"Hugh Lofting"
12:00|noon|"“‘Good,’ says he. ‘Then he’s safe in hiding some place. He’s got wits, has the Doctor—in some things. Now, nose him out—and come back and tell me where he is. In the mean time I’ll have some food got ready for him. Both he and the seal will be hungry. They’ve neither of them had a thing probably since noon yesterday, and they’ll certainly have to stay where they are till late-to-night.’"|"Doctor Dolittle's Circus"|"Hugh Lofting"
"~ 01:00"|"about one o’clock in the morning"|"It was about one o’clock in the morning when the Doctor returned to the copse. The noise he made entering woke Sophie out of a sound sleep."|"Doctor Dolittle's Circus"|"Hugh Lofting"
02:00|"two o’clock in the morning"|"“It’s now two o’clock in the morning,” said he. “We have three hours more before daylight comes. Would you prefer, Sophie, to stay here and rest till to-morrow evening, or shall we push on and get as far as we can before dawn?”"|"Doctor Dolittle's Circus"|"Hugh Lofting"
"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"Then the woman added a veil to the Doctor’s purchases. And with a large parcel under his arm he presently left the shop. Next, he went to a grocery and bought some dried herrings for Sophie —the only kind of fish he could obtain in the village. And about noon he started back down the road."|"Doctor Dolittle's Circus"|"Hugh Lofting"
"ap ~ 08:00"|"about eight o’clock"|"“We’ll cover that up with a veil.” said the Doctor. “And your hat will disguise the rest of your head. Now, eat this fish I’ve brought you and then we will rehearse dressing you up. I hear that the Grantchester coach passes by here about eight o’clock—that is, the night one does; and we’ll take that, because it’s less crowded. Now, it’s about a four hours’ ride to Talbot’s Bridge. During all that time you’ll have to sit up on your tail and keep still. Do you think you can manage that?”"|"Doctor Dolittle's Circus"|"Hugh Lofting"
02:00|"two o’clock in the morning"|"Then, to mix things up still more, that same day at two o’clock in the morning the real Robert Finch held up and robbed the Ipswich coach, more than a hundred miles away. And how he got across England to do it in that short time is still one of the great mysteries in the history of highway robbery. John Dolittle had been quite right when he said that they were adding to Finch’s reputation!"|"Doctor Dolittle's Circus"|"Hugh Lofting"
"~ 10:00"|"about ten o’clock in the morning"|"And when, about ten o’clock in the morning, the superintendent of police entered with a tall white-haired gentleman they found the prisoner stretched on his cot snoring loudly."|"Doctor Dolittle's Circus"|"Hugh Lofting"
"~ 12:00"|"About noon"|"Before long he had left the last houses of the town behind and found himself in the open country. About noon he came to a cross-roads where a sign post, pointing down a very pretty little country lane, read, “To Appledyke, ten miles.”"|"Doctor Dolittle's Circus"|"Hugh Lofting"
"~ 16:00"|"About four o’clock in the afternoon"|"About four o’clock in the afternoon a coach came along and took him to the next large town. From there he caught a night coach going east; and in the early hours of the following morning he was back within ten miles of Ashby again."|"Doctor Dolittle's Circus"|"Hugh Lofting"
"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"By making inquiries of the wayfarers along the road, the Doctor was able to follow the route the man had taken. And about noon he came up with him halted at the roadside taking his lunch."|"Doctor Dolittle's Circus"|"Hugh Lofting"
"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"It was not long before the further instructions were forthcoming. Much indignation had been aroused throughout the respectable town of Stowbury over the whole affair. And the Mayor sent word to Blossom about noon that he and the aldermen would be obliged to him if he would pack up his circus and take it out of their town immediately."|"Doctor Dolittle's Circus"|"Hugh Lofting"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"At two o’clock the show at the big tent (for which an extra sixpence was charged) was to begin. Outside the entrance a large sign was set up showing the program: “Mademoiselle Firefly, the Bareback Rider; the Pinto Brothers, Daring Trapeze Artists; Hercules, the Strongest Man on Earth; Hop, the Side-Splitting Clown, and His Comedy Wonder-Dog, Swizzle; Jojo, the Dancing Elephant,” and (in large letters) “NINO, the World-Famous Talking Horse.”"|"Doctor Dolittle's Circus"|"Hugh Lofting"
"ap 01:55"|"Five minutes to two"|"“Five minutes to two, Mr. Blossom. Pierce wants to know if you are all ready.”"|"Doctor Dolittle's Circus"|"Hugh Lofting"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"The circus was now all packed up ready for departure early to-morrow morning. As John Dolittle approached Blossom’s caravan he saw a light in the window. It was very late—after midnight."|"Doctor Dolittle's Circus"|"Hugh Lofting"
02:00|"two o’clock in the morning"|"“My gracious!” said the Doctor, looking at his watch. “Do you know what time it is? It is two o’clock in the morning … . Go to bed, all of you.”"|"Doctor Dolittle's Circus"|"Hugh Lofting"
"> 17:00"|"after five o’clock in the evening"|"“As for the rest of your show,” he said to Blossom, “I’ll leave you this corner of the grounds, and you can set up and do what business you can on your own. We get the bigger crowds after five o’clock in the evening and all Saturday afternoon—when we usually run a prizefight over in the arena. But Doctor Dolittle’s company I am going to take care of separately. Of course, I’ll pay the money through you, as I told you, and you divide it in whatever way you two arrange. But from now on he and his animals are under my management, you understand, and are not to be interfered with by anybody else. That’s what we agreed on, isn’t it?”"|"Doctor Dolittle's Circus"|"Hugh Lofting"

"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"Then for a whole morning the good housekeeper was more than usually busy. Over two hundred printed cards of invitation had been sent out. Mrs. Mugg was called in to help. A large number of small tables were set about the wagon; the inside of the caravan was decorated with flowers; lots of tea and cakes were prepared and at four o’clock on Saturday afternoon the gates of the little enclosure beside the theatre were thrown open to visitors."|"Doctor Dolittle's Circus"|"Hugh Lofting"
"~ 14:00"|"about two in the afternoon"|"“Mr. Blossom has gone into Manchester,” said John Dolittle. “He expects to be back about two in the afternoon, he told me.”"|"Doctor Dolittle's Circus"|"Hugh Lofting"
14:00|"Two o’clock in the afternoon"|"Two o’clock in the afternoon came—three o’clock—and still Mr. Blossom hadn’t returned."|"Doctor Dolittle's Circus"|"Hugh Lofting"

"ap < 06:00"|"nearly six"|"“And he may not, Doctor,” Hercules put in. “If he is a queer one, by the time you get your proof he’ll be in China, maybe—where nobody can get at him. It’s nearly six now. The Pintos are right. What are we standing around here for, guessing and wondering? At least we ought to send somebody into Manchester to find out what we can.”"|"Doctor Dolittle's Circus"|"Hugh Lofting"
"ap ~ 10:00"|"about ten o’clock"|"Of course, the animals, when they went beyond the circus fence, were careful to keep out of the way of people because they didn’t want to scare them—and people didn’t interest them anyway. They were, in fact, heartily sick of them, having them gazing and staring in at the cages all day. But one evening when the circus had moved to a new town a rather serious thing happened. Matthew came rushing to the Doctor’s wagon about ten o’clock and said:"|"Doctor Dolittle's Circus"|"Hugh Lofting"
