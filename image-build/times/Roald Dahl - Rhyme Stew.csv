00:00|midnight|"Let’s simmer down and think things out.

Young fools rush in, it’s always said,

Where even angels fear to tread.”

How wise. Had this been you or me,

We would have jumped up instantly

And rushed along the street point-blank

To rob the safe in Barclays Bank.

Not Ali Baba, no not he,

He wanted fun, not villainy.

And so, upon that selfsame day,

At midnight, Ali made his way

To London, which he knew quite well,

And thence into the Ritz Hotel."|"Rhyme Stew"|"Roald Dahl"
12:00|noon|"Hey diddle diddle

We’re all on the fiddle

And never get up until noon.

We only take cash

Which we carefully stash,

And we work by the light of the moon."|"Rhyme Stew"|"Roald Dahl"
