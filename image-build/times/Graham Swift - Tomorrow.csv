"~ 01:00"|"just gone one in the morning"|"YOU’RE ASLEEP, my angels, I assume. So, to my amazement and relief, is your father, like a man finding it in him to sleep on the eve of his execution. He’ll need all he can muster tomorrow. I’m the only one awake in this house on this night before the day that will change all our lives. Though it’s already that day: the little luminous hands on my alarm clock (which I haven’t set) show just gone one in the morning. And the nights are short. It’s almost midsummer, 1995. It’s a week past your sixteenth birthday. By a fluke that’s become something of an embarrassment and that some people will say wasn’t a fluke at all, you were born in Gemini. I’m not an especially superstitious woman. I married a scientist. But one little thing I’ll do tomorrow—today, I mean, but for a little while still I can keep up the illusion—is cross my fingers."|Tomorrow|"Graham Swift"
"ap 02:00"|two|"But sixteen years have passed and sixteen’s like eighteen once was, maybe. But that doesn’t matter. To me, tonight, you’re still little kids, you’re tiny babies, as if you might be sleeping now, not in your separate dens of rooms, but together as you once did in a single cot at Davenport Road. Our Nick and Kate. And what I’m feeling now is simply the most awful thing: that we might be wrenching you for ever from your childhood, in the same way as if you might have been wrenched once prematurely and dangerously from my womb. But you were right on time: the tenth of June 1979. And at two, as it happens, in the morning."|Tomorrow|"Graham Swift"
02:00|"two o’clock in the morning"|"At two o’clock in the morning. Of course, we let you know that. A charming little gloss on those facts of life that were bound to get raised sooner or later and can sometimes be (or they could be in those “old days”) a cause of awkward Saturday mornings. Though hardly when you were barely three and first put the innocent question and were both completely enchanted, it seemed, to learn that you both came out of my tummy, that you’d both once been there together. And that seemed to be the bit—do you even remember?—that really tickled you pink, that you’d been there together. So much so that though you’d moved by then to your first little separate beds, it seemed to reinforce your obstinate habit of ending up nonetheless in the same one."|Tomorrow|"Graham Swift"
00:00|"midday, that that night"|"I suppose it was still technically possible when we finally emerged, at some time approaching midday, that that night might have proved to be just another visit. No, your dad hadn’t come to stay, to spend the rest of his life with me. But I didn’t think I had to ask the question, and Linda and Judy at least weren’t going to deny what they could see with their eyes. All students get up late, but the two of them had been loitering for some time in the kitchen, clearly not intent on going anywhere. They were waiting to check us out. I still see their slightly glassy stares. Well, well, they might have said. Well, well, what have we here? But their silences and fidgety displays of matter-of-factness were perhaps more eloquent still."|Tomorrow|"Graham Swift"
"ap 02:00"|two|"And let’s call it two and a half. In Osborne Street, that is. I’ve never known precisely what his overall score was. One doesn’t ask. I think it can be assumed that this is a number no man is honest about. But, take it from me, your dad did his sleeping around before he came to a halt with me. I don’t say that to boast, to claim surrogate points. Perhaps I do. With me, it was six. Honest. To some that may seem quite a few, in two years, to some not so many. It was enough for me: to be able to say I’d slept around. And to sort out the Mikeys from the rest. What are women programmed to do? Biologists will tell you, and Mike was one: to select a mate."|Tomorrow|"Graham Swift"

"ap 10:30"|ten-thirty|"It wasn’t lost on Simon, of course, that it was very odd that Michael Hook, head of Living World and a busy man, should want or feel it proper to phone his wife in her busy office at ten-thirty on a Friday to press her to lunch."|Tomorrow|"Graham Swift"
00:00|midnight|"I can say now that that would have been a tricky undertaking, I’m not sure how we’d have managed it, and I should thank you for getting us out of it. Since what, in the event, did we find? You were both out celebrating, your recent release from exams. There were separate, dutiful phone messages from each of you to say you had your separate Friday-evening plans, hastily fixed up, it seemed, like our lunch. The days have long gone for asking permission: “Fine. Have fun. Home by midnight.” This was hardly a night anyway for taking you to task."|Tomorrow|"Graham Swift"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"And in fact you were both home before eleven. They can’t have been such riotous celebrations. Neither of you seemed especially worse for wear, and neither of you had been aware till you came in that you’d both been doing similar things. Of course, you were immediately and automatically uninterested in that fact. These days you don’t like anything that smacks of synchronicity. Your lack of enquiry after each other meant that your dad and I couldn’t do much enquiring either. It turned out, this last day, to be one of those not so uncommon days which pass with our exchanging barely a handful of words with you. How different tomorrow will be."|Tomorrow|"Graham Swift"
15:00|"three in the afternoon"|"Your father told me later that after a memorable guided tour my father had picked out a bottle and said (though it was three in the afternoon and more like tea-time) that we should drink it now, right away—by way of welcome. Your father had concurred. My father had patted the bottle. Then, with his non-dusty hand, he’d patted Mike on the shoulder and said, “Call me Dougie.”"|Tomorrow|"Graham Swift"
02:00|"two, this morning"|"Life at Davenport Road. The two of us and a cat. Was it quite what Mrs. Lambert had intended? “You’re looking well, you two, this morning.” Had we been looking unwell? “You’re looking full of the joys.” Once we’d been students at Sussex University in the heady and joyous 1960s. Now look at us, this steady, settled married couple in their thirties, in their terraced house in Herne Hill. They even have a cat…"|Tomorrow|"Graham Swift"
"~ 03:00"|"GONE THREE A.M."|"IT’S GONE THREE A.M. It’s getting closer. Not “tomorrow,” I can’t play that trick on myself for much longer. Today, today: the soft drumming of the rain seems to be saying it over and over."|Tomorrow|"Graham Swift"
"ap ~ 10:00"|"about ten o’clock"|"It was a Sunday morning, about ten o’clock. We were in the kitchen. The weather was damp and dull, a little threatening, but the back door was resolutely and hopefully half-open. And then there he suddenly was, like a precisely realised wish. A barely believable scuffling sound outside—more laboured and protracted, perhaps, than as we remembered it. But there he was, hesitantly pacing the kitchen floor, as if it might be a trick. As if he might be a trick. But he wasn’t."|Tomorrow|"Graham Swift"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"“It’s nine o’clock. You’re my first. I know that’s because it’s been counted as an emergency—which, incidentally, it isn’t, strictly. But anyway, most young mothers usually come in a little later, after they’ve dropped the kids off at school.”"|Tomorrow|"Graham Swift"
19:53|1953|"We were born in the historic year of 1945, when a lot of big things happened, but your dad will tell you (he’s told me enough times) that the biggest thing to have happened this century was a quiet little event that occurred in a laboratory: the discovery of the structure of DNA. Though, as your dad will be the first to admit, he didn’t have a clue about it at the time. He was only eight years old, it was 1953. It was before he started spending those summers at Uncle Eddie’s, learning about frogspawn and birds’ eggs or whatever, a biologist in the making. But even when he was doing that, he hardly had a clue about DNA."|Tomorrow|"Graham Swift"
"ap ~ 10:00"|"around ten o’clock"|"I asked Alan to drop me at East Croydon, so I could take the train from there. So I could muster again some token illusion that I’d returned from Paris, by a Gatwick flight which would have departed, allowing for the time difference, at around ten o’clock. Another train from Victoria to Herne Hill. I had only a light, one-night case. The rather slinky small black dress inside it would have been explained by the cocktail party I’d been required to attend."|Tomorrow|"Graham Swift"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"GEMINI. On the tenth of June, 1979. And, as we have told you, without any fraudulent invention, at more or less two in the morning. Something we certainly couldn’t specify, but it was what we got. What an extraordinary, world-transforming little word it suddenly seemed to be: two."|Tomorrow|"Graham Swift"
02:00|"two o’clock in the morning"|"At two o’clock in the morning, in these small hours, sixteen years ago. I wouldn’t have known if it was raining then, the weather was my last concern."|Tomorrow|"Graham Swift"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"I fear for both of you. Mothers fret and wonder and lie awake at three in the morning. Tell me I’m foolish. I fear for you in ways that have nothing to do with tomorrow. As if tomorrow won’t be enough for you, anyway, to be getting on with."|Tomorrow|"Graham Swift"
"ap 02:00"|two|"Noah’s Ark must be a sure winner, anyway, the all-time favourite for primary-school painting sessions. Is there a child who’s never been asked? A rainy afternoon in the classroom, the lights are on, out come the paints. The teacher tells the story first, then the brushes get to work. For both of you, of course, it was that memorable phrase “two by two” that struck an inspirational chord. The animals went in two by two and they did so, you were given to understand, so that the world would be saved. Whether or not you knew what that really meant, you clearly thought that being what you were meant your own salvation was guaranteed. In those days you used to get called “the Hook twins,” something you’d loathe now."|Tomorrow|"Graham Swift"
