(The owner reported it to the police after seeing her picture in the papers.) First she asked for a pair of stockings, but because of a rush of business for the Spring Dance scheduled for the following night, they were out of her size. She then asked for gloves, and bought a pair for $1.50. She was wearing them when she died, yet in the bureau in her room was a beautiful pair of hand-made white cloth gloves, perfectly spotless, that Marion had given her the previous Christmas. Why didn’t she wear those?"|"A Kiss Before Dying"|"Ira Levin"

When he left the white concrete path and cut across the darkness of the lawn he saw that Dorothy was already there, sitting stiffly with her fingers locked in her lap, a dark coat cloaking her shoulders against the April coolness. A street lamp off to the side cast leaf shadows on her face."|"A Kiss Before Dying"|"Ira Levin"

"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"He reached the campus at three o’clock and went directly to the library. In the card catalogue he found listed six books likely to contain the information he wanted; four of them were general works on toxicology; the other two, manuals of criminal investigation whose file cards indexed chapters on poisons.

"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"Whether the stimulus was the actual work he was doing or the comparative relaxation which the work offered after a day of more rigorous thinking, he could not say. But in the midst of his writing the idea came to him. It rose up fully formed, a perfect plan, unlikely to fail and unlikely to arouse Dorothy’s suspicion. The contemplation of it so occupied his mind that when the period ended he had completed only half the assigned page. The inevitable failing mark in the quiz troubled him very little. By ten o’clock the following morning Dorothy would have written her suicide note."|"A Kiss Before Dying"|"Ira Levin"

The smile was still there as she sorted her books, keeping a notebook and a small assignment pad before her and putting the remaining books in the aisle between their seats."|"A Kiss Before Dying"|"Ira Levin"

"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"No, it was unlikely that she would be found before one o’clock or so. ‘Dorothy Kingship wasn’t at breakfast and she wasn’t at lunch either’ – then they would knock on her door and get no answer. They’d most likely have to get the house mother or someone with a key. Or it might not even happen then. Many of the dorm girls slept through breakfast, and some of them ate lunch out occasionally. Dorrie hadn’t had any close friends who would miss her right away. No, if his luck held, they might not find her until Ellen’s phone call came."|"A Kiss Before Dying"|"Ira Levin"
"ap 06:00"|six|"The night before, after saying goodbye to Dorothy on the telephone, he had returned to the dorm. In the mailbox on the corner he had posted the envelope addressed to Ellen Kingship, the envelope containing Dorothy’s suicide note. The first mail collection of the morning was at six; Caldwell was only a hundred miles away and so the letter would be delivered this afternoon. If Dorothy were found in the morning, Ellen, notified by her father, might leave Caldwell for Blue River before the letter arrived, which would mean that an investigation of some sort would almost certainly be launched, because the suicide note would not be found until Ellen returned to Caldwell. It was the only risk, but it was a small one and unavoidable; it had been impossible for him to sneak into the Girls’ Dormitory to plant the note in Dorothy’s room, and impractical to secrete it in the pocket of her coat or in one of her books prior to giving her the pills, in which case there would have been the far greater risk of Dorothy finding the note and throwing it away or, still worse, putting two and two together."|"A Kiss Before Dying"|"Ira Levin"
12:00|noon|"He had decided upon noon as the safety mark. If Dorothy were found after twelve, Ellen would have received the note by the time the school authorities contacted Leo Kingship and Kingship in turn contacted her.

Then everything would be neat and in its proper order."|"A Kiss Before Dying"|"Ira Levin"

His danger was so enormous he couldn’t grasp it all at once. Ellen would receive the note – when? Three o’clock? Four? – and call Dorothy – ‘What does this mean? Why did you write this?’ – ‘Write what?’ – then Ellen would read the note and Dorothy would recognize it … Would she come to him? What explanation could he invent? Or would she see the truth – blurt out the whole story to Ellen – call her father. If she had kept the pills – if she hadn’t thrown them away, there would be proof! Attempted murder. Would she take them to a drugstore, have them analysed? There was no figuring her now. She was an unknown quantity.

In one white-gloved hand she  held a purse, in the other, a small valise covered in tan aeroplane  cloth with wide red stripes. He lifted his arm and in a moment she  noticed him.

In the orange glow of the bonfire, the students, the girls especially, spread their blankets and sat huddled in conversation. The business manager of the baseball team and the members of the cheerleading squad tried vainly to make the rally what it should be. They spurred the boys to the gathering of more and more fuel, throwing on crates and cartons until the flaming pillar was so high it threatened to topple, but it was to no avail.

She asked if I would loan her the belt to my green suit. I should mention that we both have the same green suit. I got mine in Boston and she got hers in New York, but they’re exactly the same. We both wore them to dinner last Saturday night, and it was really embarrassing. Anyway, she asked if I would loan her my belt because the buckle of hers was broken.

"ap 08:55"|"five to nine"|"She ran clatteringly down the metal steps, her heels ringing, clutching at the banister and swinging round the turn at each landing and before she had gone two and a half flights she heard him thundering down after her shouting, ‘Evvie, Ellen, Wait!’ and then it was too late to take the elevator because by the time she ran all the way around the corridor and it came and took her down he would be waiting there already so there was nothing to do but keep on running with her heart beating and legs aching down the fourteen flights from roof to lobby which were really twenty-eight half flights spiralling down through the gloomy stairwell with twenty-seven landings to swing out arm-pullingly banging against the wall with him thundering closer behind all the way down to the main floor half slipping with the damn heels and coming out into the slippery-floored cathedral of a lobby where the startled Negro head popped out of the elevator then pushing exhaustedly out through the heavy revolving door and down more steps to treacherous marble and almost bumping into a woman on the sidewalk and running down to the left down towards Washington Avenue down the small-town night-deserted street and finally slowing with her heart hard-pumping to snatch one backward look before rounding the corner and there he was running down the marble steps waving and shouting, ‘Wait! Wait!’ She wheeled around the corner running again ignoring the couple that turned to stare and the boys in the car shouting ‘Want a ride?’ and seeing the hotel down the block with its glass doors glowing like an ad for hotels getting nearer – he’s getting nearer too but don’t look back just keep on running – until at last she reached the beautiful glass doors and a man smiling amusedly held one of them open. ‘Thank you, thank you,’ and finally she was in the lobby, the lobby, the safe warm lobby, with bellhops, and loungers and men behind newspapers. She was dying to drop into one of the chairs but she went straight to the corner phone booths because if Gant went to the police with her, Gant who was a local celebrity, then they’d be more inclined to listen to her, believe her, investigate. Panting, she seized the phone book and flipped to the Ks – it was five to nine so he’d be at the studio. She slapped away pages, gaspingly catching her breath. There it was: KBRI – 5–1000. She opened her purse, and hunted for coins. Five-one-thousand, five-one-thousand, as she turned from the phone-book rack and looked up."|"A Kiss Before Dying"|"Ira Levin"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"‘I’m sorry, but Mr Gant’s programme is on the air now. If you call again at ten o’clock you might be able to catch him before he leaves the building.’"|"A Kiss Before Dying"|"Ira Levin"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"The woman sing-songed that she would be glad to take a message, and Ellen told her that Miss Kingship – spelled out – said that Powell – spelled out – was all right but had an idea as to who wasn’t, and Miss Kingship was going to Powell’s home and would be there at ten o’clock, when Mr Gant could call her."|"A Kiss Before Dying"|"Ira Levin"
"ap 09:50"|9.50|"It was 9.50 when the cab pulled up in front of Powell’s house. West Thirty-fifth Street was silent, feebly lighted by street lamps whose beams had to strain their way through meshing tree branches. Yellow windowed houses faced each other on either side, like timid armies showing flags across no-man’s-land."|"A Kiss Before Dying"|"Ira Levin"
22:00|"ten p.m."|"The radio said, ‘At the sound of the chime, ten p.m., Central Standard Time,’ and a chime toned."|"A Kiss Before Dying"|"Ira Levin"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"‘Not at this hour, not without phoning. And I think the tramcars stop running at ten.’ He picked up her coat and held it for her."|"A Kiss Before Dying"|"Ira Levin"
"ap 10:25"|"twenty-five after ten"|"Shifting uncomfortably, she drew her folded leg out from under her. She squinted at her watch in the dashboard’s glow. ‘It’s twenty-five after ten. Shouldn’t we be there already?’"|"A Kiss Before Dying"|"Ira Levin"
"ap ~ 09:45"|"about a quarter to ten"|"‘Yeah. You didn’t think I was laying here just to be lazy, did you? This is the way to think, with your feet higher’n your head. Blood goes to the brain.’ He cleared his throat. ‘The guy breaks in about a quarter to ten – man next door heard the glass break but didn’t think anything of it. No sign of any of the other rooms having been gone through, so Powell’s must have been the first one he hit. A couple of minutes later Powell and the girl come in. The guy is stuck upstairs. He hides in Powell’s closet – the clothes are all pushed to the side. Powell and the girl go into the kitchen. She starts making coffee, turns on the radio. Powell goes upstairs to hang up his coat, or maybe he heard a noise. The guy comes out. He’s already tried to open the suitcase – we found glove smudges on it. He makes Powell unlock it and goes through it. Stuff all over the floor. Maybe he finds something, some money. Anyway, Powell jumps him. The guy shoots Powell. Probably panics, probably didn’t intend to shoot him – they never do; they only carry the guns to scare people. Always wind up shooting ’em. Forty-five shell. Most likely an army Colt. Million of ’em floating around."|"A Kiss Before Dying"|"Ira Levin"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"After a moment’s silence he said, ‘You know how many don’t get caught? More than fifty per cent, that’s how many. Maybe a lot more.’ After another moment he said, ‘How are they going to catch me? Fingerprints? – none. Witnesses? – none. Motive? – none that they know about. They won’t even think of me. The gun? I have to go over the Mississippi to get back to Caldwell; goodbye gun. This car? – two or three in the morning I leave it a couple of blocks from where I took it; they think it was some crazy high school kids. Juvenile delinquents.’ He smiled. ‘I did it last night too. I was sitting two rows behind you and Powell in the theatre and I was right around a bend in the hall when he kissed you goodnight.’ He glanced at her to see her reaction; none was visible. His gaze returned to the road and his face clouded again. ‘That letter of yours – how I sweated till it came! When I first started to read it I thought I was safe; you were looking for someone she’d met in her English class in the fall; I didn’t meet her till January, and it was in Philosophy. But then I realized who that guy you were looking for actually was – Old Argyle-Socks, my predecessor. We’d had Math together, and he’d seen me with Dorrie. I thought he might know my name. I knew that if he ever convinced you he didn’t have anything to do with Dorrie’s murder – if he ever mentioned my name to you—’"|"A Kiss Before Dying"|"Ira Levin"

"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"Marion’s birthday fell on a Saturday early in November. In the morning she cleaned her apartment hastily. At one o’clock she went to a small building in a quiet tributary of Park Avenue, where a discreet silver plaque beside a white door confided that the premises were occupied, not by a psychiatrist nor an interior decorator, but by a restaurant. Leo Kingship was waiting within the white door, sitting gingerly on a Louis Quinze sofa and scanning a management-owned copy of Gourmet. He put down the magazine, rose, kissed Marion on the cheek, and wished her a happy birthday. A maître d’hôtel with fluttering fingers and neon teeth ushered them to their table, swooped away a Reserved placard and seated them with Gallic effusion. There was a centrepiece of roses on the table, and, at Marion’s place, a small box wrapped in white paper and clouds of gold ribbon. Kingship pretended not to be aware of it. While he was occupied with the wine card and ‘If I may suggest, Monsieur’, Marion freed the box of its gold entanglement, excitement colouring her cheeks and shining her eyes. Nested between layers of cotton was a golden disc, its surface constellated with tiny pearls. Marion exclaimed over the brooch, and when the maître d’hôtel had gone, thanked her father happily, squeezing his hand, which lay as if by chance near hers on the table."|"A Kiss Before Dying"|"Ira Levin"
"ap 06:00"|six|"He arrived promptly at six. He gave the button next to Marion’s nameplate two quick jabs and stood waiting in the stuffy hallway, removing a grey suede glove to pick a speck of lint from the lapel of his navy blue coat. Soon footsteps sounded on the stairs. The dingily curtained door opened and Marion appeared, radiant, the orchid bursting whitely on her black coat. They clasped each other’s hands. Wishing her the happiest of birthdays, he kissed her on the cheek so as not to smudge her lipstick, which he noticed was of a deeper shade than she had worn when first he met her."|"A Kiss Before Dying"|"Ira Levin"

"ap > 06:00"|"Shortly after six o’clock"|"In one of the vestibules, facing a dirt-stained window, Gordon Gant occupied himself by counting codfish-cake bill-boards. It was, he reflected, a hell of a way to spend Christmas Day.
Shortly after six o’clock the train reached Providence.
In the station, Gant addressed several questions to the bored oracle of the information booth. Then, regarding his watch, he left the building. It was already dark outside. Crossing a wide and slushy thoroughfare, he entered an establishment which called itself a ‘spa’, where he made quick work of a steak sandwich, mincemeat pie, and coffee. Christmas dinner. He left the spa and went to a drugstore two doors away, where he purchased an inch-wide roll of Scotch Tape. He returned to the station. He sat on an uncomfortable bench and read a Boston tabloid. At ten minutes to seven he left the station again, proceeding to a nearby place where three buses stood waiting. He boarded a blue and yellow one marked Menasset – Somerset – Fall River."|"A Kiss Before Dying"|"Ira Levin"
