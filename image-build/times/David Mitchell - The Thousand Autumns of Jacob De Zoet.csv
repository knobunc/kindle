Witnessed by Vorstenbosch and van Cleef, the document can be redeemed in Batavia or even at the Company’s Zeeland offices in Vlissingen on Walcheren. The sum represents five or six years’ salary from his former job as a shipping clerk. He must repay the friend of his uncle in Batavia who lent him the capital to buy the medicinal mercury – the luckiest gamble of my life, Jacob thinks, how nearly I bought the beche-de-mer instead – and no doubt Arie Grote has not done badly from the deal but, by any measure, the transaction made with the enigmatic Abbot is an exceptionally lucrative one. And the remaining crates, Jacob anticipates, shall fetch an even higher price, once other traders see the profit that Enomoto earns. By Christmas of next year he should be back in Batavia with Unico Vorstenbosch, whose star should, by then, be even brighter as a consequence of purging Dejima of its notorious corruption. He could consult with Zwaardecroone or Vorstenbosch’s colleagues and invest his mercury money in a yet bigger venture – coffee, perhaps, or teak – to generate an income that might impress even Anna’s father."|"The Thousand Autumns of Jacob De Zoet"|"David Mitchell"

Ten o’clock in the morning on the 3rd September, 1799
The Shogun’s reply to my ultimatum is a message for me,’ X. complains Vorstenbosch. ‘Why must a piece of paper rolled up in a tube spend the night at the Magistracy, like a pampered guest? If it arrived yesterday evening, why wasn’t it brought to me straight away?’ Because, Jacob thinks, a Shogunal communique is the equivalent of a Papal edict and to deny it due ceremony would be capital treason. He keeps his mouth shut, however: in recent days, he has noticed a growing coolness in his patron’s attitude towards him. The process is discreet: a word of praise to Peter Fischer here, a curt remark to Jacob there, but the one-time ‘Indispensable de Zoet’ fears that his halo is dimming. Nor does van Cleef attempt to answer the Chief Resident’s question: long ago, he acquired the courtier’s knack of distinguishing the rhetorical question from the actual. Captain Lacy leans back on his groaning chair with his head behind his hands and whistles between his teeth very softly. Waiting on the Japanese side of the State Table are Interpreters Kobayashi and Iwase and just two senior scribes. ‘Magistrate’s chamberlain,’ Iwase offers, ‘shall bring Shogun’s message soon.’ Unico Vorstenbosch scowls at the gold signet on his ring finger. ‘What did William the Silent,’ wonders Lacy, ‘say about his moniker?’ The grandfather clock is grave and loud.

He started his clerical work one hour early this morning so he could finish at four o’clock and begin repaying the twelve hours’ garden labour he owes the doctor. Marinus was a scoundrel, Jacob thinks, to hide his virtuosity at billiards, hut a wager is a wager. He removes the straw from around the cucumber plants’ stems, empties both gourds, then replaces the mulch to keep the moisture in the thirsty soil. Now and then a curious head appears above the Long Street wall. The sight of a Dutch clerk pulling up weeds like a peasant is worth catching. Hanzaburo, when asked to help, laughed until he saw that Jacob was in earnest, then mimed a back-pain and walked away, pocketing a fistful of lavender heads by the garden gate. Arie Grote tried to sell Jacob his sharkhide hat so he could ‘toil with elegance, like a gentleman farmer’; Piet Baert offered to sell him billiard lessons; and Ponke Ouwehand helpfully pointed out some weeds. Gardening is harder labour than Jacob is used to, and yet, he admits to himself, I enjoy it. His tired eyes are rested by the living green; rosefinches pluck worms from the ramped-up earth; and a black-masked bunting, whose song sounds like clinking cutlery, watches from the empty cistern. Chief Vorstenbosch and Deputy van Cleef are at the Nagasaki Residence of the Lord of Satsuma, the Shogun’s father-in-law, to press their case for more copper, so Dejima enjoys an unsupervised air. The seminarians are in the Hospital: as Jacob hoes the rows of beans, he hears Marinus’s voice through the Surgery window. Miss Aibagawa is there. Jacob still hasn’t seen her, much less spoken to her, since giving her the daringly illustrated fan. The glimmers of kindness the doctor is showing him shall not extend to arranging a rendezvous. Jacob has considered asking Ogawa Uzaemon to take her a letter from him, but if it was discovered, both the interpreter and Miss Aibagawa could be prosecuted for secret negotiations with a foreigner.
