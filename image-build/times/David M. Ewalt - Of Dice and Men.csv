His grandfather would challenge him to matches, checkmate him, start the game over at the point where “Gary” had made his biggest mistake, and then repeat the process until the boy’s play was perfect. When he was eight, the family moved out of the city—in part because mischievous Gary had been involved in a forty-kid rumble—to the quiet resort town of Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. Gary passed his time there playing board games and cards. At ten, he discovered Avalon Hill’s Gettysburg. “That sealed my fate,” he’d later write, “for thereafter I was a wargamer.” As an adolescent, he got hooked on military miniatures battles and built his own sand table."|"Of Dice and Men"|"David M.

"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"The first people to play it were Gygax’s eleven-year-old son, Ernie, and nine-year-old daughter, Elise. Gygax had created a counterpart to Arneson’s Blackmoor, which he called Castle Greyhawk, and designed a single level of its dungeons; one night after dinner, he invited the kids to roll up characters and start exploring. Ernie created a wizard and named him Tenser—an anagram for his full name, Ernest. Elise played a cleric called Ahlissa. They wrote down the details of their characters on index cards and entered the dungeon. In the very first room, they discovered and defeated a nest of scorpions; in the second, they fought a gang of kobolds—short subterranean lizard-men. They also found their first treasure, a chest full of copper coins, but it was too heavy to carry. The two adventurers pressed on until nine o’clock, when the Dungeon Master put them to bed. Fatherly duties completed, Gygax returned to his office and designed another level of the dungeons."|"Of Dice and Men"|"David M. Ewalt"

By two or three in the morning, wired on caffeine, sticky with vending machine junk food, and damp with nerd sweat, I had outlined an entire campaign."|"Of Dice and Men"|"David M. Ewalt"
