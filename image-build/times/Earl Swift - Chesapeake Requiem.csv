At sixty-four feet, the Courtney Thomas is the largest boat homeported in Tangier, and its twin diesels hurry it along at about seventeen knots. In ten minutes it’s left the protection of the Maryland shore and ventured into an often tempestuous arm of the bay called Tangier Sound."|"Chesapeake Requiem"|"Earl Swift"
"ap 04:00"|four|"He suggests that we talk in the morning, in case I change my mind. When my alarm goes off at four, the wind is buffeting the darkened house, and the chimes hanging from the underside of my deck are banging around crazily. I step outside. A blow’s coming steady out of the west at what must be thirty miles an hour. I can’t see the water, but I can hear its hiss, along with the thumps of breakers hitting the shore beyond the airstrip. There’s no way, I decide, that I’m spending the day in an open boat in water I can hear. I leave a message for Ooker telling him so, and go back to bed. When I wake again the sun’s shining bright, but the wind is blowing as hard as ever. I step back outside. The bay is stippled in whitecaps. In their midst are several deadrises, their captains fishing their pots. Later, conversation in the Situation Room centers on how hard it “blowed” out there, but no one seems much put out by it."|"Chesapeake Requiem"|"Earl Swift"
"ap ~ 09:00"|"about nine"|"Three days into the voyage I pulled into a wide break in the shoreline at the mouth of Mattawoman Creek and beached for the night on tiny Honeymoon Island, a lump of sand in the creek’s middle sprouted with beach grass and a few water bushes. I set up my tent, broke out my stove, and cooked dinner. Then, as darkness approached, I crawled into my sleeping bag to read by headlamp before turning in. I was immersed in a book when, at about nine, I heard a low, long rumble of distant thunder. I paid it little heed. Not three minutes later I heard another snarl—this one much louder, and deeper, and closer. And just seconds after that a gale blasted the tent with sudden, extreme force, ripping up the stakes and prying up the floor and rolling the shelter onto its side before I had time to scream. I threw myself to the tent’s windward side and stretched to pin down the corners with hands and feet, while from outside came the sounds of my cook set skittering away and the kayak sliding on the sand. I heard that for only a moment, though, because now came a deluge pounding the tent, and lightning in a flurry, bolts striking by the score, so close that the ground bounced under me, their blue-white strobes blinding through the tent’s two layers of nylon, and the sound of this hellstorm—the roar of the wind and rain, the concussions of the thunder—blotting out my every thought except that I was about to die."|"Chesapeake Requiem"|"Earl Swift"

A hard rain is falling, and its drops catch fire in the beam of a powerful spotlight on the cabin’s roof. Beyond them, all is black: Clouds smother the moon, and at 3:50 A.M. the few lights burning onshore hide behind a heavy curtain of mist. The way ahead is an impenetrable blank. Undaunted by the heavy chop, Lonnie opens the throttle, the diesel roars, the bow rises high, and we shoot bucking and thumping into the wind and confused water beyond the P’int."|"Chesapeake Requiem"|"Earl Swift"

We rattle and thud east into Pocomoke Sound’s middle, then turn due south. Up ahead, a channel marker’s red light flashes weakly through the rain. Lonnie adjusts his radar to zoom in on our location and, at 4:25 A.M., cuts the engine. Isaiah crawls blinking from the berth. We’re three miles west–southwest of the entrance to Onancock Creek. So say the instruments. The Eastern Shore is invisible, as is everything else beyond the cabin’s fogged windows."|"Chesapeake Requiem"|"Earl Swift"

The sound is empty save for a single deadrise a half mile off to starboard.

In 1928, islanders rigged up a diesel generator on the Main Ridge to wires crisscrossing the island and created a primitive electrical utility. The system ran on direct current, which required special equipment if a householder were to use industry-standard lights, radios, or appliances, and its load capacity was so limited that it was fired up for only a few hours each evening, from about 5:00 to 10:30 P.M.

All of which explains why first impressions of Tangier, and much that’s been written about it, tend to fasten on what the place lacks, rather than its one great asset—the geographic advantage defining its very existence. For all of its deprivations, Tangier could not be better situated to harvest Callinectes sapidus."|"Chesapeake Requiem"|"Earl Swift"

The thirty pots they pulled there were disappointing, so they abandoned those rows for the four they’d set another five miles out, at the edge of the channel used by big ships bound for Baltimore.

They roam the ridges in all weather, huddling under parked golf carts, colonizing yards and porches, and lounging in gangs on the roadsides, where they display little fear of approaching traffic. Cats often outnumber people on the Main Ridge, for Tangier’s central spine can seem curiously deserted on a weekday morning. Minutes might pass between golf carts trundling by, on their way to the grocery or post office. Few souls walk the streets before the tour boats arrive at midday.

"ap < 00:00"|"AN HOUR BEFORE ONE"|"AN HOUR BEFORE ONE JUNE SUNUP I hitch a ride out to Ooker’s crab shanty with Donald Thorne Jr., a.k.a. Thornie, first cousin to Carol Moore. I find the mayor packing soft crabs for market while listening to an Eastern Shore farm report on the radio. A crabber’s life resembles a farmer’s in manifold ways, he tells me. His livelihood is dependent on the weather, for one thing, and on other natural forces beyond his control: the bay’s temperature and salinity, the health of its underwater grasses, the preponderance or dearth of fish that prey on juvenile crabs. His income, like a farmer’s, turns on whatever price the market sets for his product, and he doesn’t have much say in that, either. Prices typically start high in the spring, when crabs are fresh from the mud and just starting their migration, and drop steadily as their numbers increase after Memorial Day, reaching a seasonal low in late July or August, when the animals are at their greatest abundance. Beyond that general rule, however, a Tangierman cannot count on much. “You find out what the price is when you come in with your catch,” Ooker says. “Sometimes they won’t even put a price on your ticket—they’ll just tell you it will be higher or lower than the day before.”"|"Chesapeake Requiem"|"Earl Swift"
07:40|"7:40 A.M."|"AT 7:40 A.M. we cross the harbor to the mailboat dock, where a crewman from the Courtney Thomas tells us the big boat’s port engine won’t start, so the afternoon ferry—Mark Haynie’s Sharon Kay III—will make the morning run to Crisfield. Ed Parks, maternal grandfather of mailboat skipper Brett Thomas, has pulled up to the dock in a skiff. Beside him are two boxes of swelling toads, as Tangiermen call the spiked and self-inflating northern puffers. Ugly though the fish are, they’re undeniably delicious. Skinned and deep-fried, they enjoy growing popularity as “sugar toads,” a restaurant appetizer. Even so, the eighty-year-old Ed is one of a few Tangier crabbers who fish for them."|"Chesapeake Requiem"|"Earl Swift"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"MARY STUART PARKS, A RED BANDANNA KNOTTED AROUND her head, surveys the kitchen at Fisherman’s Corner. It is nine o’clock on a Saturday morning. The dining room opens in two hours, and Stuart, as she prefers to be called, faces a tumble of chores to ready the restaurant for the weekend’s anticipated spike in tourists. She consults a list of the most pressing tasks to complete first: “5 lbs crab cakes. Thaw. Slaw. Squash casserole. Green beans. Bisque. Heat soup. Toast points. Hush pups.”"|"Chesapeake Requiem"|"Earl Swift"
"ap < 11:00"|"Shortly before eleven"|"Shortly before eleven, Irene arrives to run the register. She and Stuart take turns overseeing the kitchen and dining room, while dividing the other duties of ownership. “Irene handles more of the administrative stuff,” Stuart says. “We complement each other."|"Chesapeake Requiem"|"Earl Swift"

The relative dearth of testosterone on either premises might help explain how the competitors have coexisted on good terms for so many years. “It’s not the greatest thing to have the two restaurants next door to each other,” Stuart says, battering up pickles for the fryer. “You’ll see tourists come up and look at one, then the other, trying to decide, and it’s nerve-racking on a slow day."|"Chesapeake Requiem"|"Earl Swift"
