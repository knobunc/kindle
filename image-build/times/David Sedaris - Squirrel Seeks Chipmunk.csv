12:00|Noon|"Not wanting to spoil anyone’s Christmas, the turkey announced that he would be spending the holiday with relatives. “The wild
         side of the family,” he said. “Just flew in last night from Kentucky.” Noon arrived, and when the farmer and his middle son
         appeared in the barnyard, the turkey went to them without a fuss, saying, “So long everyone” and “See you in a few days.”"|"Squirrel Seeks Chipmunk"|"David Sedaris"
19:52|"nineteen fifty-two"|"“Oh,” the pig said, “that Henry Bacon.” He was going to admit that he was no one, or at least no one special, when the parrot stepped back and examined him again over the rim of her punch glass. “I’ve got it,” she said.
         “You’re Luther Hamm. Took the silver medal for the four-hundred-meter freestyle, Helsinki, nineteen fifty-two. Little wisp
         of a thing but, boy, did he have shoulders.”"|"Squirrel Seeks Chipmunk"|"David Sedaris"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"When I told this to my mother, she looked at the bloody rabbit I was holding and said only “What about the other ear?” Then
         she swore that this new female, my cousin, was different. “I told her you’d meet her tomorrow night, on top of the cross in
         front of God Saint Christ Jesus Lord.” This is her name for the Catholic church, which is actually—I’ve told her a thousand
         times—called Saint Timothy’s. Not that it mattered in this case. At eleven o’clock the following evening, I was back at the
         zoo, talking to the hippo."|"Squirrel Seeks Chipmunk"|"David Sedaris"
12:00|noon|"It wasn’t much later that I awoke—the story of my life since my mate passed away. I get tired, wiped out, even, but can’t
         seem to sleep more than a few hours at a stretch. It’s such a weird time to be awake—noon. Spooky, really. There have been a few occasions when, tired of just standing there and hoping to fall back to
         sleep, I got up and flew around."|"Squirrel Seeks Chipmunk"|"David Sedaris"
