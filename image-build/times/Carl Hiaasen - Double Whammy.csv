12:00|noon|"Robert Clinch was about to pull out of the driveway when he got an idea, something that might make his homecoming more bearable.  He slipped back into the house and wrote a note to Clarisse. He put it on the dinette, next to the toaster: “Honey, I’ll be home by noon. Maybe we can go to Sears and look for that shower curtain you wanted. Love, Bobby.”"|"Double Whammy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
00:00|midnight|"By midafternoon his wife was so angry that she drove to Sears and purchased not only a shower curtain but some electric hair curlers and a pink throw rug too. By suppertime she was livid, and tossed her husband’s portion of Kentucky fried chicken over the fence to the Labrador retriever next door. At midnight she phoned her mother in Valdosta to announce that she was packing up the kids and leaving the bum for good."|"Double Whammy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 05:11"|five-eleven|"“A little,” said R. J. Decker. The interview was still at the stage where Decker was supposed to look steady and taciturn, the stage where the prospective client was sizing him up. Decker knew he was pretty good in the sizing-up department. He had the physique of a linebacker: five-eleven, one hundred ninety pounds, chest like a drum, arms like cable. He had curly dark hair and sharp brown eyes that gave nothing away. He often looked amused but seldom smiled around strangers. At times he could be a very good listener, or pretend to be. Decker was neither diffident nor particularly patient;  he was merely on constant alert for jerks. Time was too short to waste on them. Unless it was absolutely necessary, like now."|"Double Whammy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"At about noon a third bass boat raced up to the fishing spot, and Dickie started hollering like a madman. “Goddammit, stop the tape! Stop the tape!” He hopped up and down on the bow and shook his fist at the man in the other boat. “Hey, can’t you see we’re filming a goddamn TV show here? You got the whole frigging lake but you gotta stop here and wreck the tape!” Then he saw that the other  angler was Ozzie Rundell, Culver’s brother, so Dickie stopped shouting. He didn’t apologize, but he did pipe down."|"Double Whammy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"Ott Pickney stopped by the motel before eight the next morning. He knocked loudly on R. J. Decker’s door."|"Double Whammy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
12:00|noon|"The shack had a permanent lean, and looked as if a decent breeze could flatten it. Except for the buzz of horseflies, the place stood silent. Decker stuck his hands in his pockets and walked down to the lake. Across the water, several hundred yards away, a sleek boat drifted with two fishermen, plugging the shoreline. Every time one of them cast his lure, the shiny monofilament made a gossamer arc over the water before settling to the surface. The pointed raspberry hull of the fishermen’s boat glistened under the noon sun. Decker didn’t even bother to try a shout. If Skink were fishing, he’d be alone. And never in a boat like that."|"Double Whammy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
00:00|midnight|"“There’s a trailer park due northwest. Lights shine through the trees,” Skink said. “They leave ’em on all night, too. Old folks who  live there, they’re scared if the lights go off. Wild noises tend to get loud in the darkness—you ever noticed that, Miami? Pay attention now: the boat is the face of a clock, and you’re sittin’ at midnight. The trailer park lights are ten o’clock—”"|"Double Whammy"|"Carl Hiaasen"

04:30|"four-thirty in the morning"|"Decker drove all night. He shot straight up Interstate 95 and got off at Route 222, just west of Wabasso. Another ninety minutes and he was in Harney County. By the time he got to Skink’s place on the lake, it was four-thirty in the morning. Already one or two bass boats were out on the water; Decker could hear the big engines chewing up the darkness."|"Double Whammy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
12:00|noon|"“The body will be gone by noon, if it’s not already. They’ll be back for it. They saw Jim Tile out by the slough, and that was that.”"|"Double Whammy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"“Not for him, not for us. But Jim Tile is a careful man. So am I. And you—you’re catching on.” Skink balanced the beer can on one knee. “There’s an Eastern nonstop to New Orleans,” he said, “leaves about noon from Orlando.”"|"Double Whammy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"< 00:00"|"almost midnight"|"Dickie lurched up to the top-floor suite of the swank hotel on Chartres Street and pounded on the door. It was almost midnight."|"Double Whammy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"Decker sighed and said he’d be back before ten. He got in the rental car and headed for the dock at Pass Manchac. On old Route 51 he encountered a steady stream of well-buffed Jeeps, Broncos, and Blazers, all towing bass boats to Lake Maurepas. Many of the trucks had oversize tires, tinted windows, and powerful fog lights that shot amber spears through the soupy-dark bayous. These vehicles served as the royal carriages of the top bass pros, who had won them in various fishing tournaments; a tournament wasn’t even worth entering unless a four-wheel-drive was one of the prizes. Many of the bassers won three or four a year."|"Double Whammy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 08:14"|Eight-fourteen|"The cheaters in the green boat arrived ten minutes before the deadline. They wore no smiles for the fans. Only four bass hung on their stringer, including the two wan specimens that Skink had marked the previous night in the fish trap. Decker got off four frames before the cheaters slung their catch onto the scale and trudged off in a sulk. “Eight-fourteen,” the weighmaster droned through a megaphone. Tenth place, Decker noted; it wasn’t Lockhart, but it still felt good."|"Double Whammy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"> 00:00"|"Shortly after midnight"|"Shortly after midnight he excused himself, went to a pay phone on Iberville, and called Jim Tile in Florida. Decker told him what had happened with Skink, Lanie, and the bass tournament."|"Double Whammy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"> 02:00"|"past two in the morning"|"He took his time driving back to Hammond. It was past two in the morning, but 1-10 was loaded with big trucks and semis, citybound. Their headlights made Decker’s eyes water."|"Double Whammy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
00:00|midnight|"Dickie Lockhart’s eyes stared wide but were long past seeing. He wore a plum-sized bruise on his right temple. If the blow hadn’t killed him outright, it had definitely rendered him unfit for a midnight swim."|"Double Whammy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
05:30|"five-thirty in the morning"|"At five-thirty in the morning, a city policeman knocked on the double door to Charlie Weeb’s hotel suite. The cop recognized one of the hookers but didn’t mention it. “I’ve got bad news, Reverend,” the policeman said. “Dickie Lockhart’s been murdered.”"|"Double Whammy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
09:00|"nine in the morning"|"After checking out of the motel, he packed his gear into the rental car and drove toward Pass Manchac. It was nine in the morning—surely somebody had discovered the gruesome scene by now."|"Double Whammy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"~ 12:00"|"About noon"|"About noon Garcίa had to drop the head case when a real murder happened. A Bahamian crack freak had carved up his male roommate, skinned him out like a mackerel, and tried to sell the fillets to a wholesale seafood market on Bird Road. It was one of those cases so bent as to be threatened by the sheer weight of law-enforcement bureaucracy—the crime scene had been crawling not just with policemen, but with deputy coroners, assistant prosecutors, immigration officers, even an inspector from the USDA. By the time the mess was cleaned up, Garcίa’s bum shoulder was throbbing angrily. Pure, hundred-percent stress."|"Double Whammy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 11:30"|eleven-thirty|"She wore tight cutoff jeans and a sleeveless lavender top, with no brassiere. Decker was ticked off that James the doctor had let her answer the door in the middle of the night—they could have been any variety of nocturnal Dade County creep: killers, kidnappers, witch doctors looking for a sacrificial goat. What kind of a lazy jerk would send his wife to the door alone, with no bra on, at eleven-thirty?"|"Double Whammy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap ~ 03:00"|"about three o’clock"|"At about three o’clock Decker gave up on sleep and got out of bed. From the window there was no sign of Skink’s campfire, or of Skink himself. Decker assumed—hoped, at least—that he was curled up in the bushes somewhere."|"Double Whammy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
12:00|noon|"To convince Skink to quit pummeling the speeders, Decker had had to agree to let him sink their ski boat, which he did by shooting three holes in the hull. Then he scrupulously idled the Aquasport all the way to the Port Everglades inlet, and from there it was full throttle again to Pier 66. By now Decker was cold and wet and eternally grateful to be off the water. They caught a cab to the Harbor Beach Marriott, got a room, and fell asleep—Decker splayed on the king-size bed, Skink in a ball on the floor. At noon they woke up and started working the phones."|"Double Whammy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
09:00|"nine in the morning"|"Jim Tile got off the road at nine in the morning. When he got back to the apartment, he fixed himself four poached eggs, three hunks of Canadian bacon, and a tumbler of fresh-squeezed orange juice. Then he took off his trousers, went to the bathroom, and changed the dressing on the bullet wound in his right thigh. Afterward he put on a gray sweatsuit, fixed himself some hot tea, and sat down with the newspaper. He did all this without saying a word to the Rundell brothers, who were still bound and gagged on the floor. In truth Culver didn’t feel slighted (he had passed out from pain many hours before), but Ozzie was dying to talk. Ozzie was scared out of his mind."|"Double Whammy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"The first caller was a woman: “Rage, it’s me. James is on another trip and I’m in the mood for pasta. How about Rita’s at nine?”"|"Double Whammy"|"Carl Hiaasen"

“It’s three in the morning, man.”
“Tough shit. Are you listening?”"|"Double Whammy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"< 00:00"|"Just before midnight"|"Just before midnight he suddenly groaned and passed out again. Decker tore up his own shirt for a compress bandage and wrapped the bad eye. He held Skink’s head in his lap and told Garcia to drive faster."|"Double Whammy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
00:00|Midnight|"Curl lay faceup on a sofa, the big dog across his chest. He stayed there for what seemed like an hour, until he could no longer tolerate the weight of the animal and the raw odor of its blood. In the darkness he could only imagine what his right arm looked like; he felt the first stinging tickle of a vile infection, and the burning throb of torn muscles. He realized that before long the dog’s body would stiffen, and it would become virtually impossible to pry its jaws. Angrily Thomas Curl balled his left fist and tested his strength. Still supine, he aimed a fierce upper cut at the pit bull’s head. The punch made little noise and had no effect, but Thomas Curl did not stop. He shut his eyes and imagined himself on the bag at the Fifth Street Gym, and punched left-breathe-left in a steady tempo. For the heavy bag drill his ex-manager used to play “Midnight Rambler” on the PA, so Curl ran the tune through his skull while he pounded on the  pit bull. With each impact a ferocious bolt shot from his mangled arm into the vortex of his neck. The pain was miserable, but his alone; like any punching bag, the dog felt nothing. Its grip was immovable and, Thomas Curl began to fear, supernatural."|"Double Whammy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 09:30"|nine-thirty|"When the bell rang, Catherine slipped into a short chiffon robe and padded barefoot to the door. The house was bright, and the clock in the alcove said nine-thirty. She’d overslept again."|"Double Whammy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
12:00|midday|"With the puny six-horse outboard, it took them longer to get around the canals, but by midday they reached the spot Skink had told them about, at the far western terminus of Lunker Lake Number Seven. Charlie Weeb’s landscapers had not yet reached this boundary of the development, so the shores remained as barren white piles of dredged-up fill. The canal ended at the old earthen dike that separated the lush watery Florida Everglades from concrete civilization. Charlie Weeb had pushed it to the brink. This was the final barrier."|"Double Whammy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 05:00"|FIVE|"At dusk the anglers returned to the boat ramp to find banners streaming, canned country music blaring, and an elaborate rectangular stage rising—a pink pulpit at one end, the bass scoreboard at the other. The whole stage was bathed by hot kliegs while the OCN cameramen conducted their lighting checks. Over the pulpit hung a red-lettered banner that said: “JESUS IN YOUR LIVING ROOM-LIVE AT FIVE!” And over the scoreboard hung a blue-lettered banner that said: “Lunker Lakes Presents the Dickie Lockhart Memorial Bass Blasters Classic.” Every possible camera angle was cluttered with the signs and logos of the various sponsors who had put up the big prize money."|"Double Whammy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
00:30|"half-past midnight"|"It was half-past midnight when someone knocked on the door of Dennis Gault’s room. He couldn’t imagine who it might be. He had elected not to stay at the Lunker Lakes Lodge with the others because all the parties would be raucous and distracting, and because the other anglers would ignore him as always. Besides, there was sawdust all over the carpets, and the walls reeked of fresh paint; obviously the place had been slapped together in about two weeks, just for the tournament."|"Double Whammy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
00:00|midnight|"So Gault had taken a suite at the Everglades Hilton, where he always stayed in Fort Lauderdale. Only Lanie, his secretaries, and a few lady friends knew where to find him. Which was why he was puzzled by the midnight visitor."|"Double Whammy"|"Carl Hiaasen"

Here the dike was accessible, but wide enough for only one vehicle; at three in the morning Eddie didn’t anticipate oncoming traffic. He drove the Wagoneer at a crawl through a crystal darkness, insects whorling out of the swamp to cloud the headlights. Every so often he had to brake as the high-beams froze some animal, ruby-eyed, on the rutted track—rabbits, raccoons, foxes, bobcats, even a fat old female otter. Eddie marveled at so much wildlife, so close to the big city."|"Double Whammy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 06:00"|six|"At six sharp a burgundy Rolls-Royce Corniche pulled up to the ramp at Lunker Lake Number One. Dennis and Lanie Gault got out. Lanie was dressed in a red timber jacket, skintight Gore-Tex dungarees, and black riding boots. She basked in the stares from the other contestants and dug heartily into a bag of hot croissants."|"Double Whammy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap < 10:00"|"before ten"|"Soon the sky over Lunker Lakes throbbed in piercing aquamarine. On a forty-foot screen mounted behind the stage, the face of Reverend Charles Weeb appeared for the morning benediction; it was a taped message (for Charlie Weeb seldom rose before ten), but none of the contestants was in the mood to hear what the Old Testament said about fishing. They were riveted on what was slowly rolling toward them down the road."|"Double Whammy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
12:00|midday|"This was true; García and Jim Tile did not know why, nor did they give it much thought as they rowed. Their concern was for one fish only, and they still had a long way to go. As for the other contestants, they might have been interested to know that Charlie Weeb’s hydrologist had warned this would happen, that the imported bass might not feed in the bad water. Even had the pros known the full truth, it was unlikely they would have given up and packed their rods—not with so much at stake. Deep in every angler’s soul is a secret confidence in his own special prowess that impels him to keep fishing in the face of common sense, basic science, financial ruin, and even natural disasters. In the maddening campaign at Lunker Lakes, whole tackleboxes were emptied and no secret weapon was left unsheathed. The putrid waters were plumbed by lures of every imaginable size and color, retrieved through every navigable depth at every possible speed. By midday it became obvious that even the most sophisticated angling technology in the world would not induce these fish to eat."|"Double Whammy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 05:00"|five|"At five sharp, the special live edition of Jesus in Your Living Room flashed via satellite across the far reaches of the Outdoor Christian Network. Radiant and cool, the Reverend Charles Weeb appeared behind his pink plaster pulpit and welcomed America to the scenic and friendly new community of Lunker Lakes, Florida."|"Double Whammy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
