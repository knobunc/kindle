However, a year after the initial infection, Alcott told her journal, “I fear she may slip away, for she never seemed to care much for the world beyond home.”44 By September 1857, Lizzie was failing fast. In the midst of her illness, Bronson Alcott chose again to move the family, this time back again for a third sojourn in Concord. This time, for the grand sum of $945, he purchased a hundred-fifty-year-old house on Lexington Road, a short walk westward from the Hillside house that had housed his family a decade earlier. Because the property featured at least forty apple trees, he christened his new home Orchard House. The structure was too dilapidated for immediate occupancy. Thus the Alcotts settled briefly into a house on Bedford Street to wait for the needed repairs to be done. Lizzie did not survive the wait. In early March 1858, she set aside her sewing needle, saying it was “too heavy” for her.45 On the fourteenth, at three in the morning, Lizzie Alcott passed away. She was not yet twenty-three."|"The Annotated Little Women"|"Louisa May Alcott"

C.” in different colors on each, and the weekly newspaper, called “The Pickwick Portfolio,” to which all contributed something; while Jo, who revelled in pens and ink, was the editor. At seven o’clock, the four members ascended to the club-room, tied their badges round their heads, and took their seats with great solemnity. Meg, as the eldest, was Samuel Pickwick; Jo, being of a literary turn, Augustus Snodgrass; Beth, because she was round and rosy, Tracy Tupman; and Amy, who was always trying to do what she couldn’t, was Nathaniel Winkle. Pickwick, the President, read the paper, which was filled with original tales, poetry, local news, funny advertisements, and hints, in which they good-naturedly reminded each other of their faults and short-comings. On one occasion, Mr. Pickwick put on a pair of spectacles without any glasses, rapped upon the table, hemmed, and, having stared hard at Mr. Snodgrass, who was tilting back in his chair, till he arranged himself properly, began to read,—"|"The Annotated Little Women"|"Louisa May Alcott"

Jo spent the morning on the river, with Laurie, and the afternoon reading and crying over “The Wide, Wide World,”4 up in the apple-tree. Beth began by rummaging everything out of the big closet, where her family resided; but, getting tired before half done, she left her establishment topsy-turvy, and went to her music, rejoicing that she had no dishes to wash. Amy arranged her bower, put on her best white frock, smoothed her curls, and sat down to draw, under the honeysuckles, hoping some one would see and inquire who the young artist was.

One day, as he went prancing down a quiet street, he saw at the window of a ruinous castle the lovely face. He was delighted, inquired who lived in this old castle, and was told that several captive princesses were kept there by a spell, and spun all day to lay up money to buy their liberty. The knight wished intensely that he could free them; but he was poor, and could only go by each day, watching for the sweet face, and longing to see it out in the sunshine.
