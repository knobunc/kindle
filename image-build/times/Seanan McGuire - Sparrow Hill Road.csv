CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT
THE WINTER LONG *"|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"Larry looks at me in silence for a long while before he nods and turns back to the road. I slam my door and the truck pulls away, driving down that long, straight stretch of highway. And then it’s gone like a piece of tissue whipped away by the wind, and overhead, the stars start blinking back on. The wind picks up and I’m cold again, falling out of the midnight back into the twilight, where the air still tastes like apple pie and dreams."|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"There are a lot more than just two Americas. Every inch of ground on this planet is a palimpsest, scraped clean and overwritten a million times, leaving behind just as many ghosts. That daylight America exists, alongside a thousand other Americas just like it, but the twilight Americas outnumber them a thousand-fold, and beneath them, the midnight Americas lurk, hungry and waiting. People who aren’t careful . . . well, people who aren’t careful run the risk of slipping through the cracks between the countries. They run the risk of falling off the map, and in the spaces where the map doesn’t extend . . ."|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"There are a thousand types of the newly dead, each with their own destinations in the twilight or the midnight. Those who died running tumble out of the daylight and find themselves on the ghostroads, the narrow veins of dark asphalt that run through the body of the twilight like veins through the thighs of an aging hooker. The trainspotters say new arrivals used to find themselves standing in railway stations or next to remote stretches of track, and the routewitches say that before that, the new-dead wound up on dirt roads or narrow horse-trails. They’re all the ghostroads, and they’ve all got one thing in common: they’re all physical evidence of the scars mankind leaves on the world."|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"It doesn’t matter whether you’re alive or dead—either way, the ghostroads are the best way to move through the twilight. They dependably exist, which gives them a definite advantage over the roads that sink down from the daylight or rise up from the midnight. They aren’t exactly safe, but nothing in the twilight really is, and the ghostroads generally don’t go out of their way to kill people. They’re content to strew themselves with hidden dangers and wait, instead of going hunting like some of the routes that can get you through the midnight."|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"Hitchers like me aren’t the only ghosts of the twilight, too well-lit for the midnight Americas, but too dark for the daylight levels. There are other types of ghost that walk here, and every one of them follows different rules. Some of them don’t understand that they’re not in charge anymore. When that happens, somebody has to teach them what they’re doing wrong. And sometimes, when I’m less than lucky, on nights like this one, somebody winds up being me."|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
"ap > 10:00"|"just past ten"|"The clock on the wall says it’s just past ten. The night is young. So are these people, and they deserve to live longer than this night. “So,” I say, a little too loudly. “How about that coffee?”"|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"I turn away, stepping through the glass of the door without opening it. The others follow me, phantom parade out into the parking lot, and the line dividing the daylight from the twilight fades with every step we take, until there’s only the dark, and still we walk on, out of the twilight, into the midnight, where the ghostroads are the only route to anywhere."|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"“I don’t know who will come, and I don’t know where they’ll take you. You’re not road ghosts, and that means you’re outside my jurisdiction.” I look at the crowd, tattered little spirits, frightened and lost here in the midnight before their time. Even Dmitri isn’t really prepared, and he’s the only one who’s been dead for any time at all. Finally, I sigh, and say, “If you’re not sure—if you’re not ready to take the final exit off the highway and see what’s on the other side—ask whoever it is to drop you off at the Last Dance. They usually need staff.”"|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"Shoving my hands into the pockets of my jeans, I walk on, down the cold line of midnight, moving toward the distant glow of dawn."|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"Tommy is there, unbroken, unbloodied, standing next to his car and staring blankly up into a sky the color of ink. There are no stars. Not here; not in the midnight. We’re on the deepest level now, the one where ghosts are the natives, and the living are the strange invasions. He looks toward the sound of my feet scuffling on the surface of the road, eyes wide in his young man’s face. “Rose? What’s going on?”"|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"The diner door swings open, and a dead man steps across the threshold, stopping just shy of the circle of salt. “You okay, Rose?” he asks. His voice is young, but the tone is much older, the voice of a man who’s spent a decade running the roads in the midnight, where young is forever and innocence is over in an instant."|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"The way stations exist for the dead, belong to the dead, but they aren’t owned by the dead. Too many of us are only passing through, psychopomps because of circumstance, making a few runs along the road before we give in to the call of taking that last exit, riding the midnight train to whatever’s waiting on the other side. The natives of the twilight tend the way stations, using them to provide themselves with a purpose, something to keep themselves from sliding down into the midnight. They work for everyone, in a way."|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"The clock was striking midnight when Tommy dropped me off in the parking lot of the Last Dance Diner, leaving me alone as he dwindled into taillights and memory down that endless road to morning. I’ve been here for hours now, and it’s still midnight at the Last Dance."|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"That’s not as strange as it seems: it’s always midnight here, or close to it, the hands on the clock locked in perpetual embrace above the window that cuts through to the kitchen. Heating lights shine down on the clean surface of the counter there, warming stacks of pancakes and cheeseburgers with their accompanying heaps of fries. Nothing ever stays on the counter long—Emma’s staff is too well-trained, the diner running like a well-oiled machine whenever someone actually comes through looking for a meal—but its presence is reassuring, granting glimpses of other people’s meals as you wait for your own. Normally, anyway. That’s how it’s supposed to work."|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
"ap 06:00"|six|"“Tomorrow, huh? I was thinking I’d go see a movie. Maybe drive up to Ann Arbor for the afternoon.” Rose made a face at him. Gary laughed. “Or I could pick you up at six for dinner, and we can go from there to the prom. If that’s okay with you?”"|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"Lady Persephone and her sacred midnight preserve me from routewitches who don’t know their own traditions. “How about I wait here while you run back to your trail guide and find out?”"|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"“Some men don’t need introductions, do they?” The first card is flipped, revealing a picture of a sleek black muscle car with red headlights racing along a midnight road. I can’t tell the make or model, and I don’t need to; I know what this represents."|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"“Routewitches are born in the daylight and live in the twilight. We die in the midnight, and the ghostroads are the closest thing we have to a true home. Without them, the Ocean Lady will not open Her arms or Her heart to us, and we wither and die. Who has once worn the crown and sets it aside is no longer welcome on the ghostroads.” The Queen’s gaze remains coldly challenging. “When our King realized what he’d allowed by answering Bobby’s question, he exiled himself by passing the crown along. He died in the daylight. He died alone. He has been more than punished for his sins.”"|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"“Then you understand. When you go to the crossroads, you take your chances with the bargain you’ll be offered. There’s no backing out once you begin. Bobby Cross requested eternal youth, time to race every road he could, and something came up out of the deepest levels of the midnight and granted him his heart’s desire.”"|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"I was starting to believe that he had. I swallow, and ask, “So what was the catch? Nothing’s free. Not when it comes from the midnight. Not when it comes from the crossroads.”"|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
"~ 00:00"|"around midnight"|"Anyway, right around midnight, they’re, like, getting real hot and heavy—if you know what I mean—and he’s thinking, score, I’m going to get all the way tonight. And then there’s this noise out in the woods. Not like, screaming, or chains, or anything, but like, music. This real old-timey big band stuff, like they used to play at school dances back in the olden days. The chick, she’s like, what the hell? And the dude, he looks out the window, and there’s this girl, right, this gorgeous stacked blonde in like, a tight little green dress, and she was all, come on, let’s dance, and he got out of the car, and she led him into the trees."|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"THE SECRET OF the palimpsest skin of America is that every place is different, and every place is the same. I guess that’s probably the true secret of the entire world, but I don’t have access to the world. All I have is North America, where the coyotes sing the moon down every night and the rattlesnakes whisper warnings through the canyons. Here the daylight, the twilight, and the midnight are divided and divided again into thousands upon thousands of realities that never seem to touch—barely even seem to exist in parallel—while secretly they’re like horny teenage lovers who can’t keep their hands off of each other. They’re stealing kisses at the drive-in, the midnight girls with their daylight boys; they’re slipping love notes to their twilight sweethearts, they’re telling lies to keep their friends from ever figuring out. They’re ripping holes in the world every day, every hour, every second, and they’re doing it because people are just people, no matter what onion-skin level of the world they think of as their home. People are just people, and people don’t like being fenced in."|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"Things that happen in the daylight echo all the way down to the midnight. It works the other way, too. What happens in the midnight will inevitably make itself known in the daylight, given enough time to echo through the layers, to pass hand to hand down all those chains of secret lovers. What happens in the dark always shines through into the light."|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"The man who ran me off the road is named Bobby Cross. He’s not dead, but he runs the ghostroads like we do. They say he can cross between levels with a thought, burn rubber from the midnight to the daylight without making any of the usual stops or payments. They say he doesn’t follow the rules of the living or the dead—and they say he eats ghosts, rips us out of the world and turns us into nothing but the scent of incense on the wind. That’s why he ran me off the road to begin with. He was hungry, and he looked into my living heart and saw a meal that just needed preparation."|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"Only one car in the crash was loved enough to leave a ghost behind, a battered pickup truck that’s healing by the second, the years wiping away like so much dust. Six more ghosts come out of the wreckage, all confused and shaken and uncertain of the rules that bind them now. I scan their faces, labeling them without really thinking about it—hitcher, homecomer, white lady. Emma can sort them out, help them decide who needs to move on and who wants to find a place in the endless arms of the midnight America."|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"Just on the off chance that it’s past midnight, I try letting go of the strings tying me to the wrap Bethany so “charitably” provided. Nothing happens. It’s still prom night in Buckley, and that means I’m anchored here, whether or not I want to be. “Fuck,” I mutter."|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"“You needed to keep track of time, Bethany. It’s midnight. That means you can’t hold me here. Oh, and by the way, your Queen? Is going to be pissed when I tell her about this.”"|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:15|"fifteen minutes after midnight"|"The corsage smells like lilies and ashes, or maybe the smell of lilies and ashes is rising from the parking lot around us, routewitch facing off with road ghost fifteen minutes after midnight on prom night. This is the sort of thing that’s rare enough to have power all its own, and in the far distance, I can hear the sound of an engine, screaming."|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"The sun’s been down for a little more than an hour. Everyone seems sure that nothing exciting will happen until midnight—they insist on calling it “the witching hour,” which is making me want to scream—so people are mostly just checking equipment and taking walks around the grounds, making sure everything has stayed in place. So far, the valiant ghost-hunters have managed to successfully attract two raccoons, a stray cat, and a hitchhiker who isn’t quite as dead as I am."|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"Sure enough, the Maggy Dhu swings its head in my direction, lips drawn back to display teeth like daggers, eyes burning the smoky, angry orange of midnight jack-o’-lanterns and the sort of harvest fire that used to come with a side order of barbecued virgin sacrifice. I take a step back. “Uh, nice doggy. Good doggy. Don’t eat me, doggy.”"|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"“You can’t be a crossroads ghost,” I say, fighting the urge to go insubstantial and drop through this layer of reality. The midnight is below us, and I’m not a midnight ghost. Worse yet is the thought that maybe Mary is. No one knows what level the crossroads ghosts belong to. I could slide into the midnight and find her there, already waiting for me. “You can’t. They don’t really exist.”"|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"“Meaning you have to take me to the crossroads before the stroke of midnight,” says Bethany. It’s the first time she’s spoken since we acknowledged each other."|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"Going to the crossroads, the quick and dirty version: as long as there have been people, there have been roads, places where the footsteps of a hundred strangers have worn a groove in the world and changed it in a way that might seem superficial, but goes all the way down into the root of things. As long as there have been roads, the places where those roads met have held a power entirely their own. Towns spring up in the places where roads meet. Fairs are held. Goods are exchanged. And sometimes, if you’re desperate, or stupid, or just feel like you have nothing left to lose, bargains are made. I don’t know who made the first crossroads bargain, and I don’t need to know, because that groove, too, has been worn into the root of things. Go to the crossroads at midnight when you need to make a deal. Everyone knows that’s how it works."|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"What the proverbial “everyone” doesn’t know is how to get to the crossroads, because there’s only so much magic to go around these days, and not just any old intersection will do. You need the right combination of place and time, madness and longing, and you need to get there by the stroke of midnight, because that’s the way it has to go. I’ve never gone to the crossroads for myself. In the decades since I died, I’ve only ever gone for other people, and even then, only when they begged, only when there was no other choice."|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"“Why?” She’s panting as she staggers to my side. I take pity and slow down slightly. My debt to the Queen probably won’t count as paid if Bethany drops dead before I can get her to the crossroads. Too bad. “I want this taken care of more than you do, but doesn’t midnight happen every night? If we miss it tonight, can’t we just try again tomorrow?”"|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"“Nope.” I can see from her expression that she doesn’t understand. This seems to be my night for taking pity. I sigh, and explain, “Once you start looking for the crossroads, you’re on one of the crossing roads. It’s some sort of symbolic metaphysical thing, since you still need to find the roads in a physical sense, and I don’t really understand it, but them’s the rules. My friend Mary could probably explain it. Anyway, she’s not here, and we have until midnight.”"|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"Bethany’s having trouble keeping up. The walk is taking its toll on her, but I don’t dare slow down. There’s only so much distance between here and midnight at the crossroads, and if we miss the deadline . . . Bethany’s going to have a lot more nights of achy joints and trouble breathing ahead of her. She’s stupid. She’s stupid, and shortsighted, and stubborn, and most of all, she’s young. She’s the kind of young I never had the chance to be. And yet a part of me understands her. She got into this mess because she wanted to get out of Buckley so badly she was willing to ransom someone else’s soul in order to do it. There was a time when I wanted out of Buckley just as bad. Admittedly, I was going to do it by marrying Gary and moving someplace big and exotic, like Ann Arbor, but hell. Who understands kids these days?"|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|Midnight|"Midnight comes and midnight goes; that’s what midnight does. Bethany stops gesturing, her hands falling to her sides as she slumps, defeated. She nods, just once. Sound returns to the cornfield, crickets chirping, an owl hooting in the middle distance, a train whistle sounding somewhere further out. The crossroads time is ending. I can even, for just a moment, hear Bethany breathing."|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|Midnight|"She looks relieved as she nods. “Yes, you probably should. Midnight’s over, and you didn’t come to make a deal.”"|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"“We’re going to get her, and bring her back.” I brace my hands against the wheel, trying to ignore the burning, letting go of the thin threads that hold me to the daylight levels high above. “He left directions. Come on, honey. Let’s hit the midnight.”"|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"I don’t know anything about Heaven or Hell. I usually figure that they wait beyond those final exits that the drivers I guide sometimes take, but I’ve never seen them, or talked to anyone who’s been there and back again. I do know the ghostroads. There are a thousand highways cutting through the afterlife, ranging from the daylight all the way down to the midnight. My natural habitat is the twilight, where the living are close enough to be remembered and distant enough to be safely ignored. Most road ghosts seem to live there, remembering life, celebrating death. When I can’t stay in the twilight, I usually ascend to the daylight, where I can catch a ride, bum a meal, and earn enough credit in the eyes of the gods of the dead to pay the fare for descending."|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"The radio dial spins, and some modern folk singer offers to let me sleep while she drives. I shake my head once, sharply. “It’s not safe,” I say. “You haven’t been dead long enough to drive these roads alone.” The things some of the creatures in the midnight can do to an innocent ghost are enough to give me nightmares. And I don’t technically sleep."|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"The transition between layers of twilight is usually seamless, like walking down a gentle slope. Going from the twilight into the midnight is nothing of the kind. Gary’s wheels actually lose contact with the road, and we drop about five feet before hitting the pavement with a bone-rattling thud. My teeth snap shut on my tongue, and phantom blood fills my mouth for a moment before my body remembers that it’s already dead, it can’t bleed anymore. My tattoo is on fire, a burning brand pressed against the small of my back. That’s almost certainly not a good sign."|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"“And neither do I.” Neither of us expected to hear Bethany’s voice. That’s clear from the way Bobby’s head whips around, expression a mask of pure fury. I turn more slowly, somehow resigned to the sight of my recently dead niece walking toward us through the midnight. The darkness doesn’t quite touch her; it skates off her skin like water off a duck’s back. She may be dead, but she’s not the sort of dead girl who belongs to the ghostroads. They can’t touch her. “There are rules for engagements of this kind, Bobby. You know that.”"|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"The engine turns over, and then we’re rolling through the midnight, heading for the night’s designated drag strip . . . heading for the future. Whatever that future is going to be."|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"There isn’t time for lengthy contemplation. Bethany is standing at our ad hoc starting line, the starter flag in one hand—and there’s no point in wondering where she got it, she’s a crossroads ghost now, and I guess that comes with a few party tricks of its own. She watches with calm, sad eyes as we roll up to either side of her, our idling engines like dragons in the quiet midnight. Then the flag comes down and there’s nothing to do but drive."|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"Last Dance Diner, says the neon sign, glowing through the darkness like a lighthouse guiding us safely into port. The lights are on, and there are people inside, being waited on by Emma’s staff. After the midnight, this level of the twilight seems almost bright enough to be the day."|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"If you ever need me, I’ll be there to get you home. And in all the Americas, from midnight to noon and in-between, the truckers roll out, and the diners stand like cathedrals of the road, and the beat . . . the beat goes on."|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
12:00|noon|"If you ever need me, I’ll be there to get you home. And in all the Americas, from midnight to noon and in-between, the truckers roll out, and the diners stand like cathedrals of the road, and the beat . . . the beat goes on."|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"Bela da meia-noite. The bela da meia-noite, or “midnight beauty,” is an exclusively female type of ghost, capable of appearing only between sunset and midnight. They enjoy trendy clubs and one-night stands. They’re generally harmless, and some have proven very helpful in exorcising hostile spirits, since they’d prefer that no one get hurt."|"Sparrow Hill Road"|"Seanan McGuire"
