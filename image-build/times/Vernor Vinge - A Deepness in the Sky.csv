12:00|"high noon"|"By coincidence OnOff was hanging near the zenith when they reached the valley floor. In the “sunny season” this would be high noon. Now, well, the OnOff star looked like some dim reddish moon, half a degree across. The surface was mottled, like oil on a drop of water. Without display amplification, OnOff’s light was just bright enough to show their surroundings."|"A Deepness in the Sky"|"Vernor Vinge"
12:00|noonday|"There comes a time when a hundred stars can be seen in the same sky as the noonday sun. And then a thousand stars, and finally the sun gets no dimmer…and the Dark has truly arrived. The larger plants have long since died, the powder of their spores is hidden deep beneath the snows. The lower animals have passed the same way. Scum mottles the lee of snowbanks, and an occasional glow flows around exposed carcasses: the spirits of the dead, classical observers wrote; a last bacterial scavenging, scientists of later eras discovered. Yet there are still living people on the surface. Some are the massacred, prevented by stronger tribes (or stronger nations) from entering deep sanctuary. Others are the victims of floods or earthquakes, whose ancestral deepnesses have been destroyed. In olden times, there was only one way to learn what the Dark might really be: stranded topside, you might attain tenuous immortality by writing what you saw and saving the story so securely that it survived the fires of the New Sun. And occasionally one of these topsiders survived more than a year or two into the Dark, either by extraordinary circumstance or by clever planning and the desire to see into the heart of the Dark. One philosopher survived so long that his last scrawl was taken for insanity or metaphor by those who found his words cut into stone above their deepness: “and the dry air is turning to frost.”"|"A Deepness in the Sky"|"Vernor Vinge"
"~ 00:00"|"about midnight"|"Meantime, Smith was across the road, talking to the captain who was running her security detail. She came back after Sherk had paid for the kerosene. “Damn. Lands Command says there’s a worse storm due in about midnight. First time I take my own car, and all hell breaks loose.” Smith sounded angry, which usually meant she was irritated with herself. They got aboard the auto. She poked at the ignition motor twice. Three times. The engine caught. “We’ll bivouac here overnight.” She sat for a moment, almost indecisive. Or maybe she was watching the sky to the south. “I know where there’s some Crown land west of town.”"|"A Deepness in the Sky"|"Vernor Vinge"
12:00|midday|"Larson’s estate was strangely quiet. Dirby city contained almost a million people, and though none of the buildings were monstrously tall, there was urbanization to within a thousand meters of the high-class Huskestrade section. Yet sitting here, the loudest sounds were Gunnar Larson’s inane chitchat—and the splashing of the little waterfall just down the hillside. Pham’s eyes were well adjusted now. He could see the reflection of Trygve’s arching light in the pond. He could see ripples when some large, shelled creature breached the surface. I’m actually coming to like the cycle of light on Ytre. Three weeks ago Pham would have never thought that time could come. The nights and days were long beyond any rhythm Pham could sustain, but the midday eclipses gave some respite. And after a while you began to forget that almost every color was a shade of red. There was a comfortable safeness about this world; these people had kept a prosperous peace for almost a thousand years. So maybe there was wisdom here…"|"A Deepness in the Sky"|"Vernor Vinge"
00:00|midnight|"A pale blue light, bluer than blue, blinked once near the edge of his vision. Pham opened his eyes a slit. The room was midnight dark. The light from the sleep panel was too faint to reveal colors. Nothing moved except the slow drifting of his hammock in the ventilator’s breeze. The blue light had been from elsewhere. From inside his optic nerve. Pham closed his eyes, repeated the breathing exercise. The blue, blinking light appeared once more. It was the effect of a localizer array’s synthesized beam, guiding off the two he had set by his temple and in his ear. As communication went, it was very crude, no more impressive than the random sparkles that most people ignore all the time. The system was programmed to be very cautious about revealing itself. This time he kept his eyes closed, and didn’t change the level of his breath or the calmness of his pulse. He curled two fingers toward his palm. A second passed. The light blinked again, responding. Pham coughed, waited, moved his right arm just so. The blue light blinked: One, Two, Three…it was a pulse train, counting binary for him. He echoed back to it, using the codes that he had set up long ago."|"A Deepness in the Sky"|"Vernor Vinge"
"> 12:00"|"Just past noon"|"It was an afternoon that Hrunkner Unnerby would never forget. In all the years he had known Victory Smith, it was the first time he’d seen her come close to losing control. Just past noon the frantic call came over the microwave communications link, Sherkaner Underhill breaking through all military priorities with word of the kidnappings. General Smith dumped Sherkaner from the line and pulled her staff into emergency session. Suddenly Hrunkner Unnerby went from being a projects director to something like…like a sergeant. Hrunkner got her tri-prop on the flight line. He and lower staff checked background security. He wasn’t going to let his General take chances. Emergencies like this were just the things that enemies like to create, and when you’re thinking that nothing matters but that emergency, then they strike at their true targets."|"A Deepness in the Sky"|"Vernor Vinge"

"< 12:00"|"almost noon"|"Above them, a narrow square of sunlight crept foot by foot across the high walls of their prison. It must be almost noon. “I hear sirens,” Brent said abruptly, after an hour of silent sitting. “Lie down close and listen.”"|"A Deepness in the Sky"|"Vernor Vinge"
12:00|"high noon"|"The First Day of the Dark. Religions and nations set minor variations in the date. The New Sun began with an explosive blaze of light, though no one was alive to see it. But the end of the light—that was a slow waning that extended across almost the whole of the Brightness. For the last three years, the sun had been a pale thing, scarcely warming your back at high noon, dim enough to stare at with a fully open gaze. For the last year, the brighter stars had been visible all through the day. But even that was not officially the beginning of the Dark, though it was a sign that green plants couldn’t grow anymore, that you’d better have your main food supplies in your deepness, and that tuber and grub farms would be all that could sustain you until it came time to retreat beneath the earth."|"A Deepness in the Sky"|"Vernor Vinge"
"ap < 10:00"|"almost ten"|"Belga Underville was getting a bit tired of Lands Command. It seemed that she was down here almost ten percent of the time—and it would be a lot more if she hadn’t become a heavy telecomm user. Colonel Underville had been head of Domestic Intelligence since 60//15, more than half the past Bright Time. It was a truism—at least in modern times—that the end of the Brightness was the beginning of the bloodiest wars. She had expected things to be rough, but not like this."|"A Deepness in the Sky"|"Vernor Vinge"
00:00|midnight|"Underville brushed her eating hands nervously across her mouth. She was committed now. Damn. If only the Finance Minister weren’t here. “I—Ma’am, in the past you have been very, um, generous in your management of subordinate operations. You give us the job, and let us do it. I have been very grateful for that. Recently though, and very likely this is without your precise knowledge, people from your inner staff have been making unscheduled visits”—midnight raids, actually—“on domestic sites in my area of responsibility.”"|"A Deepness in the Sky"|"Vernor Vinge"
"> 15:00"|"three hours after noon"|"A minute later the city bus pulled up behind Thract. He hopped aboard, the only passenger, even though it was mid-morning. “You’re in luck.” The driver grinned. “The next one isn’t until three hours after noon.”"|"A Deepness in the Sky"|"Vernor Vinge"
