The event turned out to be a classic of the volcanic art, camera-ready for the textbook: an ash cloud rising sixteen miles into the sky, and visible 200 miles away; the mountain's summit suddenly reduced in height by 1,300 feet; scores of square miles of countryside burned and devastated; 22,000 further square miles blanketed with debris; billions of trees swept flat; and fifty-seven people killed, most of them suffocated by clouds of boiling grit."|Krakatoa|"Simon Winchester"

They had awakened to the unusual sounds, and they had been then merely puzzled. By the time they breakfasted, they had become concerned. The Christians among them had gone off to their churches, feeling moderately alarmed.

The first was the electric telegraph, which, as we have already seen, came to the East Indies in 1856; the second was the submarine telegraph cable, which was to play a highly significant role in the unfolding of the Krakatoa story. This underwater cable arrived in Java after many fits and starts – the first one failed after sitting on the ocean bottom for only a month.

But the wave displayed all the insouciance of its great power; and at the time it roared over, submerged and then wrecked these mansions it was towering above them by a good twenty feet meaning that whether what Pechler saw was the wave or not, it was at least 135 feet high, formidable in its terror.
