She would never have to touch the carpet with her feet again. She would be inches off the ground all the time. She would fly up to Magnus’s window now and peek below the blind. (Magnus Smart. Magnus Berenski. Magnus is not even bothered. Why should I care about him when he clearly doesn’t give a fuck about me, he said once. But Magnus can remember him. He put me on his shoulders and we walked along the beach, he told Astrid one night in the treehouse. He let me spoon sugar into his tea.) The blind on Magnus’s room is always down. He doesn’t ever have a bath or a shower. He doesn’t get up until two in the afternoon most days and only comes downstairs to bring down dirty dishes, collect his dinner in the evening and take it back upstairs with him and lock the door again. Their mother and Michael are losing their patience. But even though they are annoyed with him he still gets to do it.

He couldn’t imagine any way of saying it, though, that wasn’t patronizing-sounding. She’d notice when she tasted it, he was sure. He called Philippa Knott on his walk down the road. He blocked the number first; never ever give out the mobile number. Hello Philippa? Dr Michael Smart here, the sound of his voice in the open summer air was strange, bombastic. He fixed their appointment for two p.m. Just on the bend of the road by the start of the woods was a square little Volvo of some kind, parked quite neatly by a ditch.

This is their third day out filming important things on Astrid’s camera. Amber is striding out now across the field, walking straight through all the stuff growing in it. Insects buzz everywhere and there are birds. There are fieldmice or rabbits or grass snakes probably, ricocheting away from them as they take every step. It would be amazing if they could actually see them shooting off away from the noise of Amber’s and Astrid’s feet i.e. she and Amber are giants in a different world and the ground is shaking under them and all the animals etc. radiating away from them. But the stuff growing in the field is jabby on Astrid’s legs, and the soil where there’s space through the stalks of stuff is dry and very uneven, and the field is huge, much bigger than it seemed from the edge of the motorway where it looked like it would be really easy to walk across, and it is very very hot because it is around noon."|"The Accidental"|"Ali Smith"

The dawn is coming up red. Red sky at night, shepherd’s delight. Red sky in the morning, shepherd’s warning. Red sky at night means that it will be a sunny day the next day. Red sky in the morning means storms, it is an old folklore way of predicting what is coming. It is something else that is amazing to Astrid, that shepherds are traditionally the people who look after the sheep, lying under trees playing their pan pipes in the summer with the sheep all grazing round them and choosing which of their flock get butchered and which don’t, and at school they sing The Lord’s My Shepherd and the readings are all about how God looks after the little children and the lambs, but only some lambs, only the ones who believe in Him, and anyway people eat lamb all the time and it only takes a few months for lambs to become sheep, and butchered."|"The Accidental"|"Ali Smith"

Q: Is there life after death? She had been on her way to a press conference about the Families Against the Thievery of Relatives’ Authenticity group. She could already see the news headlines. FATRA Lot of Good. As FATRA Would Have It. The families had got together to try to get money out of Jupiter Press and Eve. Eve’s head was full of sentences which she’d been practising overnight. Who is to say what authenticity is? Who is to say who owns imagination? Who is to say that my versions, my stories of these individuals’ afterlives, are less true than anyone else’s? She was going to answer every question with a question. This would let her answers seem open, let her seem willing to be discursive, at the same time as be rhetorically cunningly closed. She had passed the travel office then stopped and gone back to its window and read the words on the poster again. A: Why wait to find out? Take a gap year. Live now. This had made her go in and press the button on the machine that gave out numbers to people waiting their turn to be seen. The ticket said number 6. It was noon. So few people were travelling because of the world at the moment, the woman in the office told her, that they were thinking of getting rid of their ticket machine. Does it matter that I’m not a student? Eve had asked. It’ll cost you more, the woman said, but no, in terms of who you are, of course not. Anyone can take a year out. Where would you like to go in the world?"|"The Accidental"|"Ali Smith"
