“Fourteen minutes past seven,” said Dick.
Peggy was scribbling on a bit of paper. She rolled it up tight, opened another wicker basket like the one that had been sent to meet them, and brought out a pigeon. “Come on,” she said. “You slip the despatch under the ring … the rubber one.”"|"Pigeon Post"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap > 00:00"|"after twelve o’clock"|"But Susan stopped short. “What’s the time, John?” she said. “Ages after twelve o’clock. He’ll be in the middle of his dinner if we go in now. We’d better have ours first.”"|"Pigeon Post"|"Arthur Ransome"

12:00|midday|"They pushed the old car out into the yard, and when they had crammed it with stores and bedding, things began to look a little more hopeful, though there was still plenty left to be carried by the dromedaries. By that time three parts of the morning were gone, and it was clear that there could be no hope of starting till after the midday meal."|"Pigeon Post"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 06:30"|"half-past six"|"“You’ll be tired after all that traipsing,” said Mrs Tyson. “I’ll be having supper ready for you in the parlour as soon as you’ve your tents fit up. And breakfast’ll be at eight in the mornings … and your suppers at half-past six.”"|"Pigeon Post"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 06:30"|"half-past six"|"“Everybody got a hammer?” said Nancy.
“We’re to be back for tea at half-past six,” said Susan.
“Oh, look here,” said Nancy. “It’s as bad as being at school.”"|"Pigeon Post"|"Arthur Ransome"
05:00|"Five o’clock this morning"|"“Five o’clock this morning. Dick’s horrible invention began to do its worst. We did our best to sleep through it, but couldn’t. In the end I had to get up and go down to the pigeon-loft. It’s very pleasant out of doors at that time of the morning, but I’d rather have had my sleep out all the same.”"|"Pigeon Post"|"Arthur Ransome"
05:00|"five o’clock this morning"|"“But we sent the pigeon off quite early,” said Roger.
“The bell began at five o’clock this morning.”
“It was that wretched Sappho,” said Nancy."|"Pigeon Post"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"“Sappho, indeed,” said Mrs Blackett. “Just idling about and then waking people up at five o’clock.”"|"Pigeon Post"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"How long had Peggy been in sight? Hang that fly. Far down the cart track leading through the trees to Atkinson’s, was a huge old oak tree. Roger could see its wide trunk, just where the cart track bent and disappeared. Only a moment ago, he could have sworn, there was no one there. And yet … How long had he been squinting at that fly? … Now, clear enough, he could see Peggy, with her back to the tree, facing him, with one hand outstretched, and the other lifted, pointing just about at two o’clock. Q for Squashy Hat … And then … Yes … Down went her left hand and up went her right … straight above her head. D … Danger. Squashy must be leaving the farm. He must be close by. Peggy had dropped flat to the ground in front of that old oak, and was wriggling back into the bushes. She was gone."|"Pigeon Post"|"Arthur Ransome"
12:00|noon|"At noon they were back again at the near side of the Topps. This was according to plan, and they ate their midday dinner, pemmican (cold), apples, bunloaf and marmalade, and a bottle of ginger-beer (grog) apiece, in the shade of the trees. They sent off Sappho early, to give her plenty of time to get home. The message was cheerful: “ALL GOING WELL.” Roger thought it much too cheerful considering there was more than half the Topps still to be searched."|"Pigeon Post"|"Arthur Ransome"

12:00|midday|"IF it had been earlier in the day somebody would have noticed at once that there was a gap in the line and that one of the prospectors was missing. But the day had been long and very hot, and by the end of the afternoon even Nancy was not as strict as she had been. Again and again the line had been broken when somebody had found something or other and all the others had come together to see what it was. It had never been anything worth looking at, from the mining point of view, and the prospectors had spread out again to go on with the combing of the Topps, feeling more and more disheartened. They had come to spreading out anyhow, in no particular order, so that each time people had different next-door neighbours. When Roger slipped into hiding he had been next to Nancy, but when Nancy next looked that way and called out to John it never occurred to either that there ought to have been someone else between the two of them. It was growing late, and they were back at the side of the Topps above the valley of the Amazon, and Nancy had at last agreed that they had done enough, when the discovery was made. They had come to the place where they had dumped their knapsacks after the midday meal. One by one they stiffly twisted their arms through the straps, ready for the short walk home along the edge of the moorland. The pile of knapsacks grew smaller, until of all the eight only one was left."|"Pigeon Post"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 00:00"|"twelve o’clock"|"Dick stopped and pulled out his watch. “There is a way,” he said. “I found it in a book last term. You point the hour hand at the sun, and then half-way between the hour and twelve o’clock is south … or north …”"|"Pigeon Post"|"Arthur Ransome"

But today the starving prospectors’ only thought seemed to be that they could have done with a little more of it. People were seen to scrape up even the grease with bits of bread, to eat those bits of bread as if they enjoyed them, and to lick their fingers afterwards. The beans were rather sad and flabby, but Susan hotted up the potatoes again while the pudding was being eaten. They made a separate course, and it was found that ginger beer had a very good effect in clearing off the film of grease which had coated everybody’s tongue."|"Pigeon Post"|"Arthur Ransome"
