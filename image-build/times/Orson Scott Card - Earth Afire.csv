03:00|"three o’clock in the morning"|"Lieutenant Mazer Rackham jogged across the tarmac to where the HERC sat on the landing pad and climbed up into the copilot’s seat. It was three o’clock in the morning, and cloud cover from the west off the Tasman Sea had blotted out the Moon and left all of Papakura Military Camp in near total darkness. Mazer put on his helmet and switched on his HUD while the other three members of his unit climbed into the HERC and did the same. A holo of the HERC appeared in the air in front of Mazer, covered with blinking dots. Six months ago it had taken the team ten minutes to run through the preflight sequence. Now they could do it in twenty-seven seconds flat."|"Earth Afire"|"Orson Scott Card"
06:00|"six o’clock in the morning"|"It was six o’clock in the morning when Mazer left Colonel Napatu’s office and made his way across base toward the motor pool. Three hours. Napatu had given them three hours to arrange their affairs before getting on a plane for an overseas six-month assignment."|"Earth Afire"|"Orson Scott Card"
"ap 06:50"|"ten minutes to seven"|"He woke the officer on duty at the motor pool and checked out a vehicle.

03:00|"three in the morning"|"“She wasn’t going to let us take it anyway. Besides, we don’t need her. We’ll come back at three in the morning and take the test then. Right, ladder boy?”"|"Earth Afire"|"Orson Scott Card"
15:00|"three p.m."|"“I’ve been talking with the Board. Get to Luna in eight days. That’s a Tuesday. Come to the Juke north port at three p.m. Luna time. I’ll be waiting for you. I need your help with this Formic situation, son. We’ve got work to do.”"|"Earth Afire"|"Orson Scott Card"
12:00|midday|"At midday they found a family with two young children resting in the shade of an overpass. The wife said little, but she offered Bingwen and Mazer soup, which they both gratefully accepted."|"Earth Afire"|"Orson Scott Card"
"ap 02:00"|"Two o’clock"|"Mazer kept moving, shining his light in every direction, gun up and ready. For a moment he thought they were in the clear. Then his light fell upon hundreds of pairs of eyes in the darkness, rushing forward.
“Formics!” said Mazer. “Two o’clock. Hundreds of them!”
“Thirty more seconds,” said Wit."|"Earth Afire"|"Orson Scott Card"
