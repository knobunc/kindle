Fuel and explosives were concealed in a cellar under the House of Lords, but the conspirators were betrayed to the government before their design could be carried out. One of their number, Guy Fawkes, was arrested at midnight in the cellar doorway, brought to trial with his fellow conspirators and executed in January 1606."|"A Demon in My View"|"Ruth Rendell"

"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"So instead of cutting through Oriel Mews, past the Waterlily pub and making for the crossroads, he went down past All Souls’ Church, where as a child he had passed two hours each Sabbath Day, his text carefully committed to memory. And at four o’clock Auntie Gracie had always been waiting for him, always, it seemed to him, under an umbrella. Had it invariably rained on Sundays, the granite terrace opposite veiled in misty grey? That terrace was now gone, replaced by barracklike blocks of council flats."|"A Demon in My View"|"Ruth Rendell"
"ap 06:00"|six|"He had strangled her before he knew what he was doing. With his bare hands on her cold smooth throat. The release had been almost as good as the real thing. He set her up against the wall once more, dusted her beautiful white face. You do not have to hide or fear or sweat for such a killing; the law permits you to kill anything not made of flesh and blood.… He left her and came out into the yard. The room that was now Room 2 had been untenanted then as had the whole house but for his flat. And when a tenant had come he had been, as had his successor, on night work that took him out five evenings a week at six. But before that Arthur had decided. She should save him, she should be—as those who would like to get hold of him would call it—his therapy. The women who waited in the dark streets, asking for trouble, he cared nothing for them, their pain, their terror. He cared, though, for his own fate. To defy it, he would kill a thousand women in her person, she should be his salvation. And then no threat could disturb him, provided he was careful never to go out after dark, never to have a drink."|"A Demon in My View"|"Ruth Rendell"
"ap 07:30"|seven-thirty|"Arthur was a sound sleeper. He fell asleep within five minutes of laying his head on the pillow and hardly ever awoke before the alarm went off at seven-thirty. This ability to sleep was something to confound those silent critics, that invisible army of psychiatrists whose words he had read but never yet heard, and who would, he suspected, categorise him disagreeably. Which was absurd. Neurotic people don’t sleep well, nor do hysterics. Arthur knew he was a perfectly normal man who happened (like all normal men) to have a small peculiarity he was well able to keep under control."|"A Demon in My View"|"Ruth Rendell"
"ap 08:05"|"five past eight"|"He was always the last to leave for work and the first to get home. This was because the others all worked further afield than he. Jonathan Dean went first. He left at five past eight while Arthur was still in his bath. This Monday morning his room door was slammed so loudly that the bath water actually rocked about like tea in a joggled cup. The front door also crashed shut. Arthur dried himself and, for decency’s sake, put on his towelling robe before washing down bath, basin, and floor. As soon as he was dressed, he opened his own front door and left it on the latch."|"A Demon in My View"|"Ruth Rendell"

"ap 09:00"|nine|"Alone in the house now, he finished his breakfast, washed the dishes, and wiped down all the surfaces. The post was due at nine. While he was brushing the jacket of his second-best suit and selecting a tie, he heard the dull thump of the letter box. Arthur always took the post in and arranged the letters on the hall table."|"A Demon in My View"|"Ruth Rendell"
"ap 09:10"|"Ten past nine"|"He tidied up the circulars and vouchers—who messed them about like that out of sheer wantonness he didn’t know—and then he arranged the letters, their envelope edges aligned to each other and the edge of the table. Ten past nine. Sighing a little, because it was so pleasant having the house to himself, Arthur went back upstairs and collected his briefcase. He had no real need of a briefcase for he never brought work home, but Auntie Gracie had given him his first one for his twenty-first birthday and since then he had replaced it three times. Besides, it looked well. Auntie Gracie had always said that a man going to business without a briefcase is as ill dressed as a lady without gloves."|"A Demon in My View"|"Ruth Rendell"
"ap 09:30"|nine-thirty|"Grainger’s, Contractors and Builders’ Merchants, weren’t due to open until nine-thirty, and Arthur was early. He lingered to look at the house where he had lived with Auntie Gracie. It was on the corner of Balliol Street and Magdalen Hill, at the point where the hill became Kenbourne Lane, a tall narrow house, condemned to demolition but still waiting along with its neighbours to be demolished. The front door and the downstairs bay were sealed up with gleaming silvery corrugated iron to stop squatters and other vagrants from getting in. Arthur often wondered what Auntie Gracie would say if she could see it now, but he approved of the sealing up. He paused at the gate and looked up to the boarded rectangle on the brick façade which had once been his bedroom window."|"A Demon in My View"|"Ruth Rendell"

The hall smelt vaguely of cloves, less vaguely of old, unwashed fabrics. That would be the bathroom, that door between his and Room 1, and that other one to the right of old Caspian’s table, the loo. Wondering what sort of a woman or girl Miss Chan was and whether she would get possession of the bathroom just when he wanted to use it, he went out into the street."|"A Demon in My View"|"Ruth Rendell"
"ap 05:30"|"Half-past five"|"Houses marked here for demolition. The sooner they came down the better and made way for flats with big windows and green spaces to surround them. Not many truly English people about. Brown women pushing prams with black babies in them, gypsy-looking women with hard, worn faces, Indian women with Marks and Spencers woolly cardigans over lilac and gold and turquoise saris. Cars parked everywhere, and vans double-parked on a street that was littered with torn paper and bruised vegetables and silvery fish scales where a market had just packed up and gone. Half-past five. But very likely that corner shop, Winter’s, stayed open till all hours. He went in, bought a packet of ham, a can of beans, some bread, eggs, tea, margarine, and frozen peas. Carried along by a tide of home-going commuters, he returned to 142 Trinity Road. The house was no longer empty."|"A Demon in My View"|"Ruth Rendell"
"ap 06:00"|six|"Anthony could think of no answer to make to that one. He went into Room 2 and closed the door behind him. On this mild, still summery day the room with its pipe-hung brick ramparts was already growing dark at six. He switched on the jellyfish lamp and saw how the light radiated the whole of that small courtyard. Leaning out of the window, he looked upwards. In the towering expanse of brick above him there was only one other window, and that on the top floor. The frilly net curtains behind its panes twitched. Someone had looked down at him and at the light, but Anthony’s knowledge of the geography of the house was as yet insufficient to tell him who that someone might be."|"A Demon in My View"|"Ruth Rendell"
"ap ~ 06:00"|"about six"|"Every morning for the rest of that week, Arthur listened carefully for Anthony Johnson to go off to work. But Jonathan Dean and the Kotowskys always made so much noise over their own departures that it was difficult to tell. Certain it was, though, that Anthony Johnson remained at home in the evenings. Peering downwards out of his bedroom window, Arthur saw the light in Room 2 come on each evening at about six, and could tell by the pattern of two yellow rectangles divided by a dark bar, which the light made on the concrete, that Anthony Johnson didn’t draw his curtains. It was a little early for him to feel an urge to visit the cellar again, and yet he was already growing restless. He thought this restlessness had something to do with frustration, with knowing that he couldn’t go down there however much he might want to."|"A Demon in My View"|"Ruth Rendell"
09:10|"ten past nine in the morning"|"Anthony Johnson smiled, showing beautiful teeth. He radiated health and vigour and a kind of modest virility to an extent that made Arthur uncomfortable.

"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"It was eight o’clock and dusk. Arthur had long finished his evening meal, washed the dishes, and was about to settle in front of his television. But he remembered leaving his bedroom window open. Auntie Gracie had always been most eloquent on the subject of night air and its evil effects. As he was pulling down the sash, taking care not to catch up the fragile border of the net curtain, he saw the light, shed on the court below, go out. Quickly he went to his front door, opened it and listened. But instead of leaving the house, Anthony Johnson was coming upstairs."|"A Demon in My View"|"Ruth Rendell"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"The children, those in the park, and the two at the station, gave him an idea. A job for the evenings and the occasional weekend afternoon, a job for which he was admirably and thoroughly trained … It was six o’clock. He let himself into Room 2, wrote his letter, addressed an envelope and affixed a stamp to it. The whole operation took no more than ten minutes, but by the time it was done the room was so dark that he had to put the jellyfish light on. Emerging, he encountered Arthur Johnson in the hall, and Arthur Johnson was also holding a letter in his hand. Anthony would have passed him with no more than a smile and a “good evening,” but the “other” Johnson—or was that he?—turned, almost barring his passage, and fixed him with an intense, anxious, and almost hungry look."|"A Demon in My View"|"Ruth Rendell"
"ap 09:05"|"five past nine"|"They were all out but for himself. From the phone call he had overheard, Arthur knew Anthony Johnson would be going off to college or whatever it was today, but he was relieved to have had assurance made doubly sure by the sight of the “other” Johnson, viewed from his living room window, departing at five past nine for the tube station. Not that it was of much practical assistance to him, as he too must go to work in ten minutes; it was simply comforting to know the man went out sometimes. It was a beginning."|"A Demon in My View"|"Ruth Rendell"
"ap < 09:15"|"nearly a quarter past nine"|"Arthur realised what had happened and he was appalled. That he—he out of the two of them—should be the one to open a letter in error! It would have mattered so much less if it had been someone else’s letter, that giggly little Chinese piece, for instance, or that drunk, Dean. Obviously the letter must be returned. Arthur was so shaken by what he had done that he couldn’t bring himself to write the necessary note of apology on the spot. Besides, it would make him late for work. It was nearly a quarter past nine. He put the envelope and its contents into his empty briefcase and set off."|"A Demon in My View"|"Ruth Rendell"
"ap 09:45"|"quarter to ten"|"The demolition men were at work and Auntie Gracie’s living room—brown lincrusta, marble fireplace, pink linoleum—all exposed to the public view. There on the ochre-coloured wallpaper was the paler rectangle marking where the sideboard had stood, the sideboard into whose drawer he had shut the mouse. His first killing. Auntie Gracie had died in that room, and from it he had gone out to make death … Why think of all that now? He felt sick. He unlocked the gates and let himself into his office, wishing there was some way of insulating the place from the sounds of hammer blows and falling masonry, but by the time Barry lounged in at a quarter to ten, he was already composing the first draft of a note to Anthony Johnson."|"A Demon in My View"|"Ruth Rendell"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"Fortunately, there was very little correspondence for Grainger’s that day, the books were in apple-pie order and well up to date.

There was one, Arthur thought, who could do with an evening at home to get that draggled, greasy hair washed. At five past six Anthony Johnson emerged from under the arched entrance to Oriel Mews. And as Arthur watched him approach, the tall well-proportioned figure, the firm-featured, handsome face, the mane of hair crowning a shapely head, he felt a stirring of something that was part envy, part resentment. Yet this wasn’t evoked by the “other” Johnson’s good looks—hadn’t he, Arthur, had just as great a share of those himself?—or by his occupancy of Room 2. Rather it was that there, in the process of its mysterious unfair workings, fate had been kinder. Fate hadn’t saddled this man with a propensity that placed his life and liberty at constant risk.…"|"A Demon in My View"|"Ruth Rendell"

"ap 08:00"|eight|"Anthony cursed. For a few moments he sat there in the dark, wondering whether to appeal for help from Jonathan or the Kotowskys. But that would only involve him in another drinking session. The gentle closing of the front door a minute or two before had told him of Li-li’s departure. He’d have to go out and buy another light bulb. Just as well Winter’s didn’t close till eight."|"A Demon in My View"|"Ruth Rendell"
"ap 05:30"|five-thirty|"Darkness. He thought often in those days of the mouse afraid and trapped in the dark and of himself powerful in it. How he longed to be allowed out in the streets after dark! But even when he was at work and earning Auntie Gracie wanted him to come straight home. And he had to please her, he had to be worthy of her. Besides, defiance of her was too enormous an enterprise even to consider. So he went out in the evenings only when she went with him, and once a week they went together to the Odeon that was now Indian and called the Taj Mahal. Until one night when old Mr. Grainger, catching him in the yard as he was sweeping up at five-thirty, sent him over to the other side of Kenbourne to pick up an electric drill some workman had been careless enough to leave behind in a house where he was doing a rewiring job. He’d tell Miss Johnson on his way home, he told Arthur, and he was to cut along as fast as he could."|"A Demon in My View"|"Ruth Rendell"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"His own dreams had been troubling him this past fortnight, the consequence of frustration. Each evening at eleven, before going to bed, he had taken a last look out of his bedroom window to see the courtyard below aglow with light from Room 2. It seemed a personal affront and, in a way, a desecration of the place. Moreover, Anthony Johnson hadn’t been near him, had avoided all contact with him. Arthur wouldn’t have known he was in the house but for the arrival, and the subsequent removal from the hall table, of another of those Bristol letters, and of course that ever-burning light."|"A Demon in My View"|"Ruth Rendell"
"ap < 08:00"|"just before eight"|"Then, on a Friday evening just before eight, it went out. Carrying his torch, Arthur let himself out of his flat and came softly down the top flight. He had heard the front door close, but that might have been Li-li Chan going out. Both she and Anthony Johnson closed it with the same degree of moderate care. And it must have been she, for as Arthur hesitated on the landing he saw Anthony Johnson appear in the hall below him. Arthur stepped back and immediately the front door closed. Through its red and green glass panels the shape of Anthony Johnson could be seen as a blur vanishing down the marble steps. No one, Arthur reasoned, went out at this hour if he didn’t intend to stay out for some time. He descended the stairs and, delaying for a moment or two to let the occupant of Room 2 get clear, left the house, crossed the lawn, and entered the side passage."|"A Demon in My View"|"Ruth Rendell"
"ap 09:30"|"half-past nine"|"The euphoria he felt after one of his killings totally ruined, Arthur passed a bad night. He sweated profusely so that he fancied the pink sheets smelt bad, and he stripped them off in a frenzy of disgust. Li-li had put her rent envelope under his door at some time in the small hours. By half-past nine he had assembled hers, the two envelopes of the Kotowskys—Vesta insisted on paying her half-share separately from that of her husband—and his own, and was seated downstairs waiting for Stanley Caspian. No more rent from Jonathan Dean, who would be leaving today, thank God, and none to collect (thank God again) from Anthony Johnson, who had paid two months in advance."|"A Demon in My View"|"Ruth Rendell"
"ap 10:10"|"ten past ten"|"The hall was cold and damp. It was a foggy morning, an early harbinger of the winter to come. Stanley stumped in at ten past ten, wearing a checked windcheater that looked as if it was made from a car rug, and carrying a huge cellophane bag containing cheese puff cocktail snacks.

On his way to the Vale Café, he paused for a moment to view the stacked wood. The pile stood some fifteen feet high and someone had flanked it with a pair of trestle tables. Arthur shook his head in vague, undefined disapproval.

"ap 09:30"|"half-past nine"|"In another public house, the Grand Duke, in a distant part of Kenbourne, Arthur sat alone at a table, drinking brandy. A small brandy with a splash of soda. When first he had set out on this nocturnal walk he had been terrified—of himself. But gradually that fear had been conquered by the interest of the streets, by the changes which had come to them, by the squalid glitter of them, by the lonely places at which alley mouths and mews arches and paths leading to little yards hinted like whispers in the dark. He hadn’t forgotten, in twenty years, the geography of this place where he had been born. And how many of the warrens, the labyrinths of lanes twisting across lanes, still remained behind new, soaring façades! The air was smoky, acrid with the stench of fireworks, but now, at half-past nine, there were few people about. It excited Arthur to find himself, during that long walk, often the only pedestrian in some wide, empty space, lividly lighted, swept by car lights, yet sprawled over with shadows and bordered with caverns and passages penetrating the high frowning walls."|"A Demon in My View"|"Ruth Rendell"

There was a finality in this act which both pleased and frightened him. No going back now, no possibility of restoring the letter with another explanatory note. The deed was done and his revenge accomplished. Would the knowledge of that be sufficient to sustain him till he was home again? Could he get home in safety? As he emerged once more into the cocktail bar, the fear of himself began to return. But all the same, he bought another small brandy. He was deferring his departure from the Grand Duke until the last possible moment. It was twenty minutes to eleven. In his absence, someone had taken his seat and he was obliged to stand in a corner by the glass partition which divided this section from the saloon. The glass was frosted but with a flower pattern on it of clear glass.

Its main gate was closed, but the little iron kissing gate, the entry to a footpath which skirted the park, couldn’t be closed. He saw a woman pass through this gate, her shadow, before she entered the dark path, streaming across the lighted pavement. His heart squeezed and he clenched his hands.

Brian had gone out the previous night, intent on quarrelling with Jonathan Dean—intent perhaps on fighting Dean?"|"A Demon in My View"|"Ruth Rendell"

"ap < 05:00"|"nearly five"|"Anthony spent the day in the college library and it was nearly five when he reached Kenbourne Lane tube station on his way home. There on the newsboards he read: Murder of Kenbourne Woman and Kenbourne Killer slays again? Though he was necessarily interested in what leads men to kill, murder itself fascinated him not at all, so he didn’t buy a paper. Helen’s letter would be waiting for him, and since leaving the library his whole mind had been possessed by speculating as to what she would say."|"A Demon in My View"|"Ruth Rendell"
07:30|"half-past seven this morning"|"“The police came here at half-past seven this morning,” he said. “They couldn’t get an answer from Brian, so they came to me.

"ap < 11:00"|"just before eleven"|"“Oh God, of course. That’s why I moved away. We couldn’t do it here, could we? In the next room to the poor old bastard. Christ, I was with her yesterday.

"~ 00:00"|"about midnight"|"Jonathan ran his fingers through his untidy ginger hair. “I haven’t been living in that bloody awful hole for the past week. It stinks and it’s overrun with mice. My sister said I could stay in her place while she’s away in Germany. She’s got a flat in West Hampstead. I went back there last night from the Duke. I got there about midnight and Brian turned up around half-past. He was pissed out of his mind and he was making all sorts of threats and accusations, only he passed out and I put him to bed.”"|"A Demon in My View"|"Ruth Rendell"
"~ 12:00"|"about midday"|"Jonathan shook his head. “I left him there and went to work. The fuzz got hold of me at about midday and I told them everything, but when they got to my sister’s Brian had gone. They’re searching for him now. It’s no good looking like that, Tony old man, he must have done it. Why else would he vanish?”"|"A Demon in My View"|"Ruth Rendell"
23:00|"eleven that night"|"He went up to her and put his hand into his pocket where he had stuffed his scarf. Perhaps she thought he was feeling for his wallet, for she moved towards him and put her hand on his arm. He strangled her then, and she was too surprised to struggle or cry out. Afterwards, when he understood what he had done, he knew he would be caught, tried, hanged—but nothing had happened. The police never came to the house in Magadalen Hill, and if they had they would have discovered nothing, for Beryl told neither his aunt nor her mother that he had left her alone in the Odeon. She gave them the impression that it was she who had jilted him, left him finally at eleven that night and never wanted to see him again. Auntie Gracie was hot against her for her ingratitude and her fickleness, and of course she understood why Arthur, disappointed in love, fell ill suddenly from some virus the doctors couldn’t diagnose and was off work for six weeks. He never saw Beryl again, though later he heard that she had married a greengrocer and had two children.…"|"A Demon in My View"|"Ruth Rendell"

Impossible to get over the fact—yet equally impossible to grasp the full significance of it—that he had not only killed a woman he knew but one who lived in the same house. Impossible too to forget or come to terms with another aspect. He had lied to Inspector Glass, that piranha-faced man, lied under the pressure of panic and forgetting that his lie could easily be detected. Anthony Johnson could show the police he had lied.

"ap 10:45"|"quarter to eleven"|"Linthea, in the kitchen making Chicken Maryland, talked about the murder practically, logically, like a character in a detective story. “If Brian Kotowsky did kill her, he can’t have gone straight to find this Dean, because he left your house at a quarter to eleven and she didn’t leave the Grand Duke till ten minutes later. So they’re saying he hung about in the street on a freezing cold night on the chance she’d come that way and at that time. When she did come they didn’t go home to quarrel but quarrelled in a pitch-black mews where he killed her. And that’s ridiculous.”"|"A Demon in My View"|"Ruth Rendell"

Then Li-li Chan emerged. She stood at the front gate under a red pagoda umbrella, scanning the cars that turned into Trinity Road from Magdalen Hill. Then the front door slammed with a Dean-like crash and Arthur heard her platform soles clumping up the stairs. He opened his door and put it on the latch."|"A Demon in My View"|"Ruth Rendell"

"ap < 09:20"|"almost twenty past nine"|"By now it was almost twenty past nine. Arthur considered not going to work, phoning Mr. Grainger and saying he’d got this gastric bug that was going about. He seemed to see Auntie Gracie loom before him, shaking her head at his deceit and his cowardice. Besides, he’d have to go back tomorrow or the next day. Shivering as if he were really ill, he dragged on his raincoat and took his umbrella from the rack in the hall. What to do with H’s letter? Take it to work and try to think of some solution. He could come home at lunchtime, anyway, in good time to restore it if he could find no alternative but to deliver it and himself into Anthony Johnson’s hands."|"A Demon in My View"|"Ruth Rendell"

H’s letter would have to go back to 142 Trinity Road by one and it was eleven now. He’d brazen it out, that was all. He’d deny in his most severe manner ever having touched Anthony Johnson’s correspondence. Useless to keep turning things over in his mind like this when there was no help for it. He glanced at the sheet on which he was typing and saw he had put an H instead of a P before Coleman and “convict” instead of “convert.” The paper was torn out and a fresh sheet inserted. Anthony Johnson would go at once to the police. The police would stop hunting for Brian Kotowsky and start thinking seriously about Arthur Johnson, who never went out at night but who had been out that night; who was a resident of Kenbourne Vale at the time of the murder of Maureen Cowan and at the time of the murder of Bridget O’Neill; who had unaccountably lied to them.… He flexed his hands to try and prevent their trembling."|"A Demon in My View"|"Ruth Rendell"

Brian had been sitting on the stairs doing up his shoelaces and he had come up to him and said, “Mr. Johnson, I presume?” Now he was dead, had walked out into the wintry sea until he drowned.

The announcer didn’t say much about it, only that a drowned corpse had been identified and that there would be an inquest. But Arthur was satisfied. He had never even considered that honourable promptings of conscience might bring him qualms when Brian was tried for Vesta’s murder. Brian Kotowsky was nothing to him, his indifference towards the dead man tempered only by a natural dislike of someone who got drunk and was noisy. But Kotowsky might have been acquitted. Nothing could now acquit him. His self-dealt death marked him as plainly a murderer as any confession or any trial could have done. The police would consider the case as closed."|"A Demon in My View"|"Ruth Rendell"

The new attendant at the launderette was Mr. Grainger’s nephew’s wife, earning a bit of pin money, and he thought he could safely leave his washing with her while he went to the shops.

But now a girl who had sat next to him in the lecture room brought her tray to his table and pointed out to him a long-haired boy who was holding court at the far end of the room, surrounded by avid listeners."|"A Demon in My View"|"Ruth Rendell"
"ap 09:51"|"nine fifty-one"|"“I didn’t bother to queue up for a ticket. I could hear an announcer saying, ‘The train standing at platform two is the nine fifty-one for London, calling at Bath, Swindon and Reading.’ It was nine-fifty then and I jumped on that train. I had to buy a ticket when the man came round and it took all the money I’d got but for five pence. I hadn’t got a chequebook or a bank card or anything. Oh, Tony, I’m entirely skint, I’ve got just what I stand up in."|"A Demon in My View"|"Ruth Rendell"

He put an arm round her shoulders, helped her to her feet. “Come along, my love, we’re going to Trinity Road, but we’ll take in an errand I have to do on the way.”"|"A Demon in My View"|"Ruth Rendell"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"Behind the curtains Arthur had sat all day, breaking his vigil every half-hour or so to examine his face in the bathroom mirror. Now, at three o’clock, he saw Stanley Caspian’s car draw up and park in front of one of the houses on the odd-numbered side. A man was coming to view Flat 1, and in a moment this man and Stanley would come into the house. Arthur watched the car but he could only see Stanley in it, sitting in the driving seat, his bulk and the bikini doll impeding further view. Perhaps he had brought the man with him or perhaps he was simply waiting for the new tenant to arrive for his appointment. Arthur went back to the bathroom.
