"ap ~ 03:00"|"about three"|"It was about three when we rode into Bridger’s Wells, past the boarded-up church on the right, with its white paint half cracked off, and the houses back under the cottonwoods, or between rows of flickering poplars, every third or fourth one dead and leafless. Most of the yards were just let run to long grass, and the buildings were log or unpainted board, but there were a few brick houses, and a few of painted clapboards with gimcracks around the veranda rails. Around them the grass was cut, and lilac bushes were planted in the shade. There were big purple cones of blossom on them. Already Bridger’s Wells was losing its stage-stop look and beginning to settle into a half-empty village of the kind that hangs on sometimes where all the real work is spread out on the land around it, and most of the places take care of themselves."|"The Ox-Bow Incident"|"Walter van Tilburg Clark"

Even at that Farnley didn’t give any sign. Gil drew the card into his hand and picked them all up. He’d drawn the king of spades."|"The Ox-Bow Incident"|"Walter van Tilburg Clark"
"ap 06:00"|six|"That still didn’t make it any sky-limit game, but it was mean for the kind of a game this had started out to be. There was plenty left in Gil’s stack, but when Farnley had counted out the five there was only one dollar left on the green by his hand.
“Make it six,” Gil said, and put in the extra one.
“Pick it up, Gil,” I said. “You were seen at five.”"|"The Ox-Bow Incident"|"Walter van Tilburg Clark"

There was some muttering from others too. Gil didn’t pay any attention. He sat looking at Farnley. Farnley was breathing hard, and his eyes were narrowed, but he looked at his hand, not Gil."|"The Ox-Bow Incident"|"Walter van Tilburg Clark"

"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"“Greene was all mixed up,” I said, still muttering over my chin. “He wasn’t sure of anything except Kinkaid was shot in the head. But he thought it was about noon.”"|"The Ox-Bow Incident"|"Walter van Tilburg Clark"

12:00|noon|"Ma said, “Art, you read too many books,” to him, and began to dig into young Greene, calling him son, and acting as if what he thought was just as important as what he knew. At that she boiled it down better than anybody else had. Kinkaid had been killed way down in the southwest corner of the valley, eight miles below the ranch. They didn’t know just when, but it must have been noon or earlier, because a couple of the riders had picked up his horse clear over by the ranch road, and at about two o’clock had found Kinkaid lying on his back in the sun in a dry wash over under the mountains. Greene didn’t know if there were any more cattle gone; they hadn’t been able to distinguish the rustlers’ tracks. Too many cattle had been working over the range there, and there were still a lot of horses’ prints from the roundup. She kept him toned down except on that one thing, that Kinkaid had been shot through the head. That was the one thing he seemed to have clear without question. He had kept on saying that to the men too. It impressed him that Kinkaid had been shot through the head, as if he could feel it more, as if he would have felt better if Kinkaid had been shot in the belly or in the back, or anywhere but in the head. When Ma asked him, he admitted that he hadn’t seen Kinkaid, but that the man who told him had. No, he hadn’t seen the sheriff down there; it must have been three o’clock before they sent him to Bridger’s and he hadn’t seen the sheriff all day."|"The Ox-Bow Incident"|"Walter van Tilburg Clark"

If we’re wanted, we’ll hear. I sent Joyce down to the ranch to find out what the sheriff has to say. If any of you want to stay in town, Mrs. Grier can put you up, or Canby, or the Inn, if they can still get the doors open.”"|"The Ox-Bow Incident"|"Walter van Tilburg Clark"

“In the lower pass at four,” said Farnley. “Sure we can get ’em.”

"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"After a time Tetley led us out to the edge of the aspens to where the wind was directly on us again. We waited there, peering into the snow blowing in the valley, and the dark gulf of the valley itself, but unable to see the other riders, of course, or anything but the fire. It felt to me as if it must be one o’clock at least, but I learned early that I couldn’t tell within four hours on a cloudy night unless I was doing some work I did every night, like riding herd in the same valley."|"The Ox-Bow Incident"|"Walter van Tilburg Clark"

“Five minutes after two,” he said.
“All right,” Tetley said after a moment, “we’ll wait till daylight.”"|"The Ox-Bow Incident"|"Walter van Tilburg Clark"
12:00|midday|"When Ma set to cooking it, though, with Sparks helping her, many changed their minds. There was a belly-searching odor from that meat propped on forked sticks and dripping and scorching over the coals. None of us had had a real meal since midday, and some not then, and the air was cold and snowy and with a piny edge. It carried the meat smell very richly."|"The Ox-Bow Incident"|"Walter van Tilburg Clark"
"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"Then he was quiet again, and looked up, though not at me, and told me evenly, “When he got home his father had locked the house against him. He went out into the barn and hanged himself from a rafter. The hired man found him about noon. I saw him,” he said slowly. His hands stopped twisting and gripped together."|"The Ox-Bow Incident"|"Walter van Tilburg Clark"
