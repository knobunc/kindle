“One-fifty,” the Major said.
Dortmunder hesitated, and the Major could see him trying to decide whether or not to hold out for the full amount."|"The Hot Rock"|"Donald E. Westlake"

“We’re meeting tonight,” Dortmunder said. “At ten. You free?”
“Yes, I think I am,” Greenwood said. Not happily."|"The Hot Rock"|"Donald E. Westlake"

Two of the regulars were having a game at the bowling machine, and three more were remembering Irish McCalla and Betty Page at the bar.

"~ 03:20"|"about three-twenty in the morning"|"One Wednesday night in late June, at about three-twenty in the morning, Kelp came walking eastward along West 60th Street wearing a tan raincoat, and when he was opposite the Coliseum entrance he suddenly had a fit. He went rigid, and then he fell over, and then he began to thrash around on the sidewalk. He cried, “Oh! Oh!” several time, but in a husky voice that didn’t carry far. There was no one else in sight, no pedestrians and no moving automobiles."|"The Hot Rock"|"Donald E. Westlake"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"Dortmunder got to his feet and went out to the kitchenette and began to put cheese spread on Ritz Crackers. He did about half a dozen of them, put them on a plate, and brought them back in to the living room, where Kelp was just finishing up the conversation. Dortmunder put the plate of crackers on the coffee table, Kelp hung up the phone, Dortmunder sat down, and Kelp said, “He’ll meet us at the O. J. at ten.”"|"The Hot Rock"|"Donald E. Westlake"
"ap 10:00"|"Ten o’clock"|"“Well, I’m intrigued, naturally,” Chefwick said. “I suppose it’s too complicated to go into over the phone.”
“It sure is,” Dortmunder said. “Ten o’clock at the O. J.?”
“That will be fine,” Chefwick said."|"The Hot Rock"|"Donald E. Westlake"
"ap 10:01"|"one minute after ten"|"Dortmunder said, “Hi,” and Rollo nodded. Dortmunder at one minute after ten. The same regular customers were draped in their usual positions on the bar, watching the television set, looking not quite as real as the figures in a wax museum. Rollo was wiping glasses with a towel that once was white."|"The Hot Rock"|"Donald E. Westlake"
02:25|"TWO TWENTY-FIVE A.M."|"AT TWO TWENTY-FIVE A.M., the morning after Prosker’s visit to Greenwood, the stretch of Northern State Parkway in the vicinity of the Utopia Park exit was very nearly empty. Only one vehicle was in the area, a large dirty truck with a blue cab and a gray body, the words “Parker’s Renta-Truck” in a white-lettered oval on both cab doors. Major Iko had done the renting, through untraceable middlemen, just this afternoon, and Kelp was doing the driving at the moment, heading east out of New York. As he slowed now for the exit, Dortmunder, in the seat beside him, leaned forward to look at his watch in the dashboard light and say, “We’re five minutes early.”"|"The Hot Rock"|"Donald E. Westlake"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"In the prison at this same time Greenwood was also looking at his watch, the green hands in the darkness telling him he still had half an hour to wait. Prosker had told him Dortmunder and the others wouldn’t be making their move until three o’clock. He shouldn’t do anything too early that might tip their mitts."|"The Hot Rock"|"Donald E. Westlake"
"ap 02:55"|"five minutes to three"|"In the prison Greenwood, looking at his watch and seeing it was five minutes to three, decided the time had come. He sat up, throwing the covers off, showing he was already fully dressed except for shoes. He put his shoes on now, got to his feet, looked at the sleeping man in the top bunk for a few seconds—the old man was snoring slightly, mouth open—and then Greenwood hit him in the nose."|"The Hot Rock"|"Donald E. Westlake"
"ap 03:20"|three-twenty|"They retraced the route that Dortmunder and Chefwick had taken coming in here. Four more doors stood in the way, each having been unlocked by Chefwick on the way in and each now being locked again on their way out. They came at last to the exit from this building and waited there, clustered around the doorway, looking at the black cube of the laundry across the way. Dortmunder checked his watch and it was three-twenty. “Five minutes,” he whispered."|"The Hot Rock"|"Donald E. Westlake"
"ap 03:20"|three-twenty|"Four blocks away, Kelp looked at his watch, saw it was three-twenty, and got out of the truck cab again. He was finally getting used to the fact that the interior light didn’t go on when he opened the door, he having removed the bulb himself before they left the city. He closed the door quietly, went around back, and opened the rear doors. “Set,” he whispered to Murch."|"The Hot Rock"|"Donald E. Westlake"
"ap ~ 06:00"|"around six"|"They’d done it. From here on it was simple. They’d wait here in the truck till around six, and then Kelp would slip out, get into the cab, and drive them all away from here. It was unlikely he’d be stopped, but if he was he was perfectly safe. He had legitimate papers for the rental truck, legitimate-looking driver’s license and other identification, and a legitimate-sounding reason for being abroad. In a quiet spot in Brooklyn the convertible would be removed from the truck and left with its keys in it invitingly close to a vocational high school. The truck would be driven to Manhattan and left at the garage where Major Iko’s man would pick it up and return it to the rental agency."|"The Hot Rock"|"Donald E. Westlake"

Tonight they wouldn’t be able to hear it, not being able to hear anything but themselves, so they could either have to see it or just take a chance on its being there. Dortmunder hadn’t realized noise would be a problem like this, and it troubled him, detracting from the enjoyment of the ride."|"The Hot Rock"|"Donald E. Westlake"
"ap 07:20"|Seven-twenty|"Far away on their left the sun was sinking slowly into Pennsylvania, the sky turning pink and mauve and purple. Manhattan was already in twilight.
Dortmunder checked his watch. Seven-twenty. They were doing well.
The plan was to circle around the police station and come at it from the rear, so the cops out front wouldn’t get a glimpse of the helicopter landing on their roof. Murch kept following the Hudson north, therefore, until Harlem stood snaggle-toothed on their right, and then he made a wide sweeping U-turn. It was like being a kid on one of those Coney Island rides, only higher up."|"The Hot Rock"|"Donald E. Westlake"

It was not quite two o’clock in the afternoon, September the seventh—three weeks and two days since the raid on the police station—and the neighborhood children were all in school. The neighborhood fathers were all at work, of course, and God alone knew where all the neighborhood mothers were. Wherever they were, Dortmunder was alone, trapped by a stupid overzealous dog on the porch of a middle-aged but comfortable home in a middle-aged but comfortable residential section of Long Island about forty miles from Manhattan.

It started off with a drenching rain in the morning, then turned windy and cold, then the clouds blew away in the middle of the afternoon and the sun came out, and by five-thirty it was as warm as a summer afternoon. Albert Cromwell, safe deposit box guard at the 46th Street and Fifth Avenue Branch of C&I National Bank, had worn raincoat and rubbers in the morning as well as carrying an umbrella, and went home carrying all three. He didn’t know whether to be disgusted at the changeableness of the weather or pleased with the goodness it had finally arrived at, and decided to be both."|"The Hot Rock"|"Donald E. Westlake"

Dortmunder had come here once already today, at nine-thirty this morning, but when he’d walked by the stairway and looked down, it was Albert on duty outside, which meant George would be inside, and George they didn’t have primed, so he’d gone away again, coming back now in the hope that Albert and George shifted after lunch and didn’t keep the same posts all day long."|"The Hot Rock"|"Donald E.

The sidewalks were busy too, with nannies walking baby carriages and elevator operators walking dachshunds and colored nurses walking bent old men. Dortmunder and Chefwick kept their back to it all, shielding Chefwick’s busy hands as he went through the door like a car with Platformate going through a paper hoop.
