10:00|"10:00 A.M."|"Due to the reduced sunshine over a patch of the earth as large as the diameter of the Moon, the morning was unusually cool for a Mexican July. By 10:00 A.M., the temperature was only in the low seventies and then slowly dropped as the eclipse progressed. When the daylight finally began to dim noticeably, the air seemed almost chilly. The surface of the ocean looked dull and flat, but without the slate gray color of a cloudy day. Cumulus clouds billowed over the distant spine of mountains like an accelerated film."|"The Five Ages of the Universe"|"Fred Adams"
12:00|noon|"Suddenly, the dunes were awash in strange shadowy ripples, like the bottom of a swimming pool at noon. The ripples drifted slowly across the sand, their contrast flickering. These shadow bands, among the rarest of natural phenomena, were produced by the special combination of a crescent sliver of Sun and unusual turbulence in the upper atmosphere. The bands persisted for less than a minute, and then seemed to evaporate. The wind grew stronger."|"The Five Ages of the Universe"|"Fred Adams"
12:00|noon|"Earth’s life-producing oceans have long since evaporated, first into a crushing, sterilizing blanket of water vapor, and then into space entirely. Only a barren rocky surface is left behind. One can still trace the faint remains of ancient shorelines, ocean basins, and the low eroded remnants of the continents. By noon, the temperature reaches nearly 3000 degrees Fahrenheit, and the rocky surface begins to melt. Already, the equator is partly ringed by a broad glowing patchwork of lava, which cools to form a thin gray crust as the distended Sun eases beneath the horizon each night."|"The Five Ages of the Universe"|"Fred Adams"
"ap 10:00"|10|"where η is some number. According to our definition, the exponent η is the number of cosmological decades. For example, the universe is currently only about ten billion years old, which corresponds to 10 years or η = 10 cosmological decades. In the future, when the universe is 100 billion years old, the time will be 10” years or η = 11 cosmological decades. The power of this scheme is that each successive cosmological decade represents a tenfold increase in the total age of the universe. The concept of a cosmological decade thus provides us with a way to think about immensely long time spans. Our aggressively large example, the number 10, thus corresponds to the rather more tractable hundredth cosmological decade, or η = 100."|"The Five Ages of the Universe"|"Fred Adams"
