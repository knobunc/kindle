03:00|"three in the morning"|"“I am an enormous fan of Reynolds’s work. It seems he can’t put a foot wrong at the moment, providing as he does everything I want in a science fiction story—startling originality, daring concepts and ideas, rich characterizations, and the technical skills to pull them all together. Diamond Dogs is yet another small but perfectly formed masterpiece to add to the Reynolds canon . . . [He] has a knack of keeping you reading. It might be three in the morning and you’ve got work the next day, but you still need to turn that page to find out what happens. And then the page after that! He is an ingenious and endlessly inventive writer, filling his work with twists and turns that make for compulsive reading. His descriptive prose can be awesome at times. The various horrors played out in the Spire are truly chilling . . . Diamond Dogs is glam-goth science fiction played loud and is destined to become as much of a classic as the Bowie song that inspired the title. Don’t miss it!” —SF Revu"|"Diamond Dogs, Turquoise Days"|"Alastair Reynolds"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"Mina rose after midnight to begin her shift. Naqi went to sleep and dreamed fitfully, seeing in her mind’s eye red smears and bars hovering against amorphous green. She had been staring at the readouts too intently, for too many hours."|"Diamond Dogs, Turquoise Days"|"Alastair Reynolds"
00:00|midnight|"The midnight light was all spectral shades of milky grey. The creased and crumpled landscape of the node reached away into mid-grey gloom, merging with the slate of the overlying cloud deck. Naqi saw nothing remarkable, other than the surprising closeness of the surface."|"Diamond Dogs, Turquoise Days"|"Alastair Reynolds"
"ap 01:00"|one|"This was, in truth, exactly the kind of thing Naqi would normally have gone to the other side of the planet to avoid. But something had drawn her this time, and made her wangle the trip out from the Moat at an otherwise critical time in the project. She could only suppose that it was a need to close a particular chapter in her life, one that had begun the night before Mina’s death. The detection of the Ultra ship—they now knew that it was named Voice of Evening—had been the event that triggered the blackout, and the blackout had been Mina’s justification for the two of them attempting to swim with the Jugglers. Indirectly, therefore, the Ultras were “responsible” for whatever had happened to Mina. That was unfair, of course, but Naqi nonetheless felt the need to be here now, if only to witness the visitors’ emergence with her own eyes and see if they really were the monsters of her imagination. She had come to Umingmaktok with a stoic determination that she would not be swept up by the hysteria of the celebrations. Yet now that she had made the trip, now that she was amidst the crowd, drunk on the chemical buzz of human excitement, with a nice fresh worm hooked onto her gut wall, she found herself in the perverse position of actually enjoying the atmosphere."|"Diamond Dogs, Turquoise Days"|"Alastair Reynolds"
12:00|midday|"The crowd turned their heads into the sky, ignoring the musicians, conjurors and confidence tricksters. The backpacked girls stopped and looked aloft along with the others, shielding their eyes against the midday glare. The spark was the shuttle of Voice of Evening, now parked in orbit around Turquoise."|"Diamond Dogs, Turquoise Days"|"Alastair Reynolds"
12:00|midday|"In Umingmaktok the booths and bunting were packed away and normal business resumed. Litter abounded. Worm dealers did brisk business, as they always did during times of mild gloom. There were far fewer transport craft moored to the arms, and no sign at all of the intense media presence of a few days before. Tourists had gone back to their home cities and the children were safely back in school. Between meetings Naqi sat in the midday shade of half-empty restaurants and bars, observing the same puzzled disappointment in every face she encountered. Deep down she felt it herself. For two years they had been free to imprint every possible fantasy on the approaching ship. Even if the newcomers had arrived with less than benign intent, there would still have been something interesting to talk about: the possibility, however remote, that one’s own life might be about to become drastically more exciting."|"Diamond Dogs, Turquoise Days"|"Alastair Reynolds"
12:00|noon|"Near local noon they reached the next node. The shuttle had continued to dog them, nosing to and fro along the hazy band where sea met sky. Sometimes it appeared closer, sometimes it appeared further away, but it never left them alone, and Naqi knew that it would be only a matter of time before it detected a positive homing trace, a chemical or physical note in the water that would lead it to its quarry. The shuttle would cover the remaining distance in seconds, a minute at the most, and then all that she and Weir would know would be a moment of cleansing whiteness, a fire of holy purity. Even if Weir released his toxin just before the shuttle arrived, it would not have time to dissipate into a wide enough volume of water to survive the fireball."|"Diamond Dogs, Turquoise Days"|"Alastair Reynolds"
