"> 12:00"|"after noon"|"Some time after noon, Kote came down the stairs to find him crushing walnuts on the bar with a heavy leather-bound book. “Good morning, Reshi.”"|"The Name of the Wind"|"Patrick Rothfuss"
"> 00:00"|"PAST midnight"|"IT WAS WELL PAST midnight by the time Kote made it back to Newarre with Chronicler’s limp body slung across his lacerated shoulders. The town’s houses and shops were dark and silent, but the Waystone Inn was full of light."|"The Name of the Wind"|"Patrick Rothfuss"
00:00|midnight|"The voice came from a man who sat apart from the rest, wrapped in shadow at the edge of the fire. Though the sky was still bright with sunset and nothing stood between the fire and where he sat, shadow pooled around him like thick oil. The fire snapped and danced, lively and warm, tinged with blue, but no flicker of its light came close to him. The shadow gathered thicker around his head. I could catch a glimpse of a deep cowl like some priests wear, but underneath the shadows were so deep it was like looking down a well at midnight."|"The Name of the Wind"|"Patrick Rothfuss"
"~ 12:00"|"AROUND NOON"|"IT WAS AROUND NOON when the wagon turned onto a new road, this one wide as a river and paved with cobbles. At first there were only a handful of travelers and a wagon or two, but to me it seemed like a great crowd after such a long time alone."|"The Name of the Wind"|"Patrick Rothfuss"
00:00|midnight|"I woke at midnight when all the bells in the city started ringing. People ran and shouted in the streets. The seven days of High Mourning were behind us. Midwinter was past. A new year had begun."|"The Name of the Wind"|"Patrick Rothfuss"
"> 15:00"|"just past fifteen"|"I HAD BEEN IN Tarbean for years at this point. Three birthdays had slipped by unnoticed and I was just past fifteen. I knew how to survive Waterside. I had become an accomplished beggar and thief. Locks and pockets opened to my touch. I knew which pawnshops bought goods “from uncle” with no questions asked."|"The Name of the Wind"|"Patrick Rothfuss"
"< 12:00"|"a little before noon"|"Still naked, I wrapped myself in a towel and left by the back door. I took my purse but kept it out of sight. It was a little before noon and people were everywhere. Needless to say, quite a few eyes were turned in my direction. I ignored them and set a brisk pace, not trying to hide. I composed my features into an impassive, angry mask without a trace of embarrassment."|"The Name of the Wind"|"Patrick Rothfuss"
"< 11:00"|"AN hour before noon"|"Coppers, Cobblers and Crowds
IT WAS ABOUT AN hour before noon when I stepped out onto the street.
The sun was out and the cobblestones were warm beneath my feet. As the noise of the market rose to an irregular hum around me, I tried to enjoy the pleasant sensation of having a full belly and a clean body."|"The Name of the Wind"|"Patrick Rothfuss"
"< 12:00"|"nearly noon"|"THE NEXT MORNING I blearily awoke after two hours of sleep, bundled myself onto one of the wagons and proceeded to drowse away the morning. It was nearly noon before I realized that we had taken on another passenger at the inn last night."|"The Name of the Wind"|"Patrick Rothfuss"
12:00|noon|"He spoke before I could think of anything. “If you’re really going, you should hurry. Today is the last day. Sometimes they don’t go much longer than noon.”"|"The Name of the Wind"|"Patrick Rothfuss"
"ap ~ 00:50"|"about ten to one"|"It was a young woman of about eighteen. A rarity of sorts. The ratio of men to women in the University is about ten to one."|"The Name of the Wind"|"Patrick Rothfuss"
12:00|noon|"“Four and a half in favor of suspending punishment,” the Chancellor said after a pause. “The discipline stands: three lashes to be served tomorrow, the third of Equis, at noon.”"|"The Name of the Wind"|"Patrick Rothfuss"
12:00|Noon|"Kilvin ran his hands through his beard, thoughtfully. “Do not bother with the Basic Artificing class you have signed for. Instead you will come to my workroom tomorrow. Noon.”"|"The Name of the Wind"|"Patrick Rothfuss"
12:00|Noon|"Kilvin ran his hands through his beard, thoughtfully. “Do not bother with the Basic Artificing class you have signed for. Instead you will come to my workroom tomorrow. Noon.”
“I’m afraid I have another appointment at noon, Master Kilvin.”
“Hmmm. Yes.” He frowned. “First bell, then.”"|"The Name of the Wind"|"Patrick Rothfuss"
12:00|Noon|"Kilvin watched him go, then turned to look at me. “My workshop. Day after tomorrow. Noon.” The tone of his voice implied that it wasn’t really a question."|"The Name of the Wind"|"Patrick Rothfuss"
12:00|noon|"THE NEXT MORNING I woke early, washed up, and grabbed a bite to eat at the Mess. Then, because I had nothing to do before my whipping at noon, I strolled the University aimlessly. I wandered through a few apothecaries and bottle shops, admired the well-kept lawns and gardens."|"The Name of the Wind"|"Patrick Rothfuss"
12:00|noon|"I bought us cider at a nearby pub, using mine to wash down the nahlrout, trying not to grimace at the bitter, chalky taste. Before too long we heard the belling tower striking noon."|"The Name of the Wind"|"Patrick Rothfuss"
00:00|midnight|"“What could I have done, Bast? Smeared my face with lampblack and staged a daring midnight rescue?” Kvothe gave a brief humorless laugh. “They’d taken him in on heresy. All I could do was hope he truly had friends in the church.”"|"The Name of the Wind"|"Patrick Rothfuss"
12:00|midday|"By the time I struggled through the midday crowd and caught up with him, we were on the northern edge of the University, following a wide dirt road that led into the forest. “Master Elodin,” I said, pelting up to him. “I was hoping I could talk with you.”"|"The Name of the Wind"|"Patrick Rothfuss"
"ap 03:20"|Three-twenty|"“Take a wild guess,” Elodin said. “We’re all friends here.”
“Three-twenty?” the man said with a shrug. “Three-fifty?”
Elodin rapped on the thick timber door with a knuckle, and the man scrambled to unlock it. “How many more could we fit if we needed?” Elodin asked him."|"The Name of the Wind"|"Patrick Rothfuss"
"ap 03:50"|Three-fifty|"“Take a wild guess,” Elodin said. “We’re all friends here.”

12:00|noon|"Eight jots more than I had. As I walked out of the Masters’ Hall, I ignored the sinking feeling in my gut and tried to think of a way I could lay hands on more money by tomorrow noon."|"The Name of the Wind"|"Patrick Rothfuss"
12:00|noon|"“Of course,” she said coolly. “But I don’t feel particularly inclined to give out that sort of information.” She tilted her head quizzically. “By the way, today’s Cendling, isn’t it? Don’t you need your tuition by noon tomorrow?”"|"The Name of the Wind"|"Patrick Rothfuss"
12:00|Noon|"“Kvothe, Arliden’s son,” I said when I finally arrived at the front of the line. The bored looking woman marked my name and I drew a tile out of the black velvet bag. It read “Hepten: Noon.” Five days from now, plenty of time to prepare."|"The Name of the Wind"|"Patrick Rothfuss"
"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"The next day one of Jamison’s errand boys woke me out of a sound sleep in my vast bed at the Horse and Four. He informed me that I was due on the horns at a quarter hour before noon. I was being charged with Conduct Unbecoming a Member of the Arcanum. Ambrose had finally caught wind of my song."|"The Name of the Wind"|"Patrick Rothfuss"
12:00|noon|"Denna gave me a sideways glance, smiling. “You’re always so cautious,” she said. “I’ve never known a man to step so carefully.” She looked at my face as if it were a puzzle she could solve. “I expect noon would be an auspicious time tomorrow. At the Eolian.”"|"The Name of the Wind"|"Patrick Rothfuss"
12:00|noon|"But even better than that was the fact that my days of fruitlessly searching for Denna were at an end. Tomorrow at noon in the Eolian: “lunch and talking and walking” as she had phrased it. The thought filled me with a giddy excitement."|"The Name of the Wind"|"Patrick Rothfuss"
"> 12:00"|"after noon"|"“What time is it?” I asked frantically.
“First bell after noon,” a female voice said. “Don’t try to get up.”
I slumped back against the bed. I was supposed to have met with Denna at the Eolian an hour ago."|"The Name of the Wind"|"Patrick Rothfuss"
12:00|noon|"By noon, I had worked myself into such a grim mood that I snapped at Sim during lunch and we bickered like an old married couple. Wilem offered no opinion, keeping his eyes carefully on his food. Finally, in a blatant attempt to dispel my foul mood they invited me to go see Three Pennies for Wishing across the river tomorrow evening. I agreed to go, as I’d heard the players were doing Feltemi’s original and not one of the expurgated versions. It was well suited to my mood, full of dark humor, tragedy, and betrayal."|"The Name of the Wind"|"Patrick Rothfuss"
"> 12:00"|"after noon"|"“I’m not running,” I said. “But I need to cover some ground. Seventy miles before it gets much after noon.”"|"The Name of the Wind"|"Patrick Rothfuss"
00:00|Midnight|"“What’s your name, boy?” I asked gently, just so he could get used to the sound of my voice. He snuffed delicately at my hand, keeping close watch with one large, intelligent eye. He didn’t back away, but he certainly wasn’t at his ease either. I kept talking as I came closer, hoping he would relax at the sound of my voice. “You deserve a good name. I hate to see some lordling with delusions of wit saddle you with some terrible name like Midnight or Sooty or Scut.”"|"The Name of the Wind"|"Patrick Rothfuss"
"> 13:00"|"an hour after noon"|"I looked in the direction he gestured and saw chimney smoke rising from behind the hill. A great wave of relief washed over me. I’d made it, and it was barely an hour after noon."|"The Name of the Wind"|"Patrick Rothfuss"
"ap 03:55"|"Five and a half to four"|"“All in favor?” the Chancellor said wearily. Hemme raised his hand, as did Brandeur, Mandrag, and Lorren. “Five and a half to four: grievance stands.”"|"The Name of the Wind"|"Patrick Rothfuss"
12:00|noontime|"As he spoke, Bast’s eyes grew paler, until they were the pure blue of a clear noontime sky. “I swear by all the salt in me: if you run counter to my desire, the remainder of your brief mortal span will be an orchestra of misery. I swear by stone and oak and elm: I’ll make a game of you. I’ll follow you unseen and smother any spark of joy you find. You’ll never know a woman’s touch, a breath of rest, a moment’s peace of mind.”"|"The Name of the Wind"|"Patrick Rothfuss"
