00:00|midnight|"Karrde looked at the data pad again, a muscle tightening briefly in his jaw. “We’re going to do the only prudent thing,” he said. “Namely, retreat. Dankin, get on the secure comm and tell Lachton to start pulling the drop apart again. Then call Chin and his team and have them go over and repack the stuff in the equipment dumps. You can stay and help Mara and me here. I want to get off Rishi by midnight if at all possible.”"|"Dark Force Rising"|"Timothy Zahn"
00:00|midnight|"Mara would have bet that they couldn’t reassemble their equipment in less than twenty-four hours. To her mild surprise, the crews had everything packed and ready to go barely an hour after local midnight. With suitably generous applications of funds to spaceport officials, they were off Rishi and to lightspeed an hour after that."|"Dark Force Rising"|"Timothy Zahn"
"ap 01:26"|"one twenty-six"|"“That’s ours,” Irenez said, peering over Han’s shoulder. “You can parallel them by changing course to one twenty-six mark thirty.”"|"Dark Force Rising"|"Timothy Zahn"
"ap < 02:00"|"nearly two"|"They walked in silence for another minute. “Some believed then that he was a god,” the maitrakh said. “All feared him and the mighty silver flying craft that had brought him and his attendants from the sky. But even amid the fear there was anger at what the gods had done to us, and nearly two tens of warriors chose to attack.”"|"Dark Force Rising"|"Timothy Zahn"
"ap 09:03"|Nine-Oh-Three|"“It’s a Harkners-Balix Nine-Oh-Three,” the other sniffed with a second-rate attempt at wounded pride. “Flying hatbox, indeed.”"|"Dark Force Rising"|"Timothy Zahn"
"ap 09:17"|Nine-Seventeen|"Not much of an actor, but he was clearly getting a kick out of all this cloak-and-blade stuff. Setting her teeth firmly together, Mara sent a silent curse down on Torve’s head for setting up such a ridiculous identification procedure in the first place. “Looks like a Nine-Seventeen to me,” she said dutifully. “Or even a Nine-Twenty-Two.”"|"Dark Force Rising"|"Timothy Zahn"
"ap 09:22"|Nine-Twenty-Two|"Not much of an actor, but he was clearly getting a kick out of all this cloak-and-blade stuff. Setting her teeth firmly together, Mara sent a silent curse down on Torve’s head for setting up such a ridiculous identification procedure in the first place. “Looks like a Nine-Seventeen to me,” she said dutifully. “Or even a Nine-Twenty-Two.”"|"Dark Force Rising"|"Timothy Zahn"
"ap 09:03"|Nine-Oh-Three|"“No, it’s a Nine-Oh-Three,” he insisted. “Trust me—my uncle used to make landing gear pads for them. Come inside and I’ll show you how to tell the difference.”"|"Dark Force Rising"|"Timothy Zahn"
"< 12:00"|"just before noon"|"They had been sitting around the table in the maitrakh’s house since early morning, studying maps and floor plans and diagrams, searching for a plan of action that would be more than simply a complicated way of surrendering. Finally, just before noon, Leia called a halt. “I can’t look at this anymore,” she told Chewbacca, closing her eyes briefly and rubbing her thumbs against throbbing temples. “Let’s go outside for a while.”"|"Dark Force Rising"|"Timothy Zahn"
"< 00:00"|"A little before midnight"|"The late morning sunshine was blazing brightly down, with only a scattering of high clouds to interfere. Leia glanced upward at the clear sky, shivering involuntarily at the sudden sensation of nakedness that flooded in on her. A clear sky, all the way up to space … but it was all right. A little before midnight the maitrakh had brought the news of the Star Destroyer’s imminent departure, a departure which she and Chewbacca had been able to watch with the macrobinoculars from the Wookiee’s kit. It had been their first break since Khabarakh’s arrest: just as it had begun to look like she and Chewbacca would be pinned down here until it was too late, the Grand Admiral had abruptly left."|"Dark Force Rising"|"Timothy Zahn"
00:00|midnight|"Sometime during their midnight journey the unit had finally finished its work … and as she read the analysis, Leia felt a fresh stirring of her earlier anger toward the Empire at what they’d done to these people. “Yes,” she told the maitrakh. “I can indeed prove that the debt has been paid.”"|"Dark Force Rising"|"Timothy Zahn"
00:00|midnight|"There was no problem getting the midnight transport off Coruscant; Leia’s authorization guaranteed that. But a freighter with a cargo consisting of a dozen X-wings was unusual enough to spark comment and speculation … and it was inevitable that the speculation would eventually reach the ears of one of Fey’lya’s supporters."|"Dark Force Rising"|"Timothy Zahn"
"ap 02:10"|two-ten|"“Vector two-ten mark twenty-one. Configuration … it’s an Escort Frigate.”"|"Dark Force Rising"|"Timothy Zahn"
