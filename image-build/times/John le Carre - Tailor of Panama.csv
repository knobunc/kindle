Then he remembered his eight-thirty appointment with his bank manager and sprang out of bed at the same moment that his wife, Louisa, howled, “No, no, no,” and pulled the sheet over her head, because mornings were her worst time."|"Tailor of Panama"|"John le Carre"

12:00|midday|"And that was that. Vain fool that he afterwards called himself, Pendel was amused and flattered. This Osnard was evidently a card, and Pendel loved a card the way Uncle Benny had, and the Brits, whatever Louisa and her late father might say about them, made better cards than most. Perhaps after all these years of turning his back on the old country it wasn’t such a bad place after all. He made nothing of Osnard’s reticence about the nature of his business. A lot of his customers were reticent, others should have been who weren’t. He was amused; he was not prescient. And on putting down the telephone, he went back to his admiral’s uniform until the Happy Friday midday rush began, because that was what Friday lunchtime was called until Osnard came along and ruined the last of Pendel’s innocence."|"Tailor of Panama"|"John le Carre"
"ap 04:57"|"three minutes to five"|"It was entirely appropriate, in Pendel’s later opinion, that Osnard’s arrival at P & B should have been accompanied by a clap of thunder and what Uncle Benny would have called the trimmings. It had been a sparkly Panamanian afternoon in the wet season till then, with a nice splash of sunshine and two pretty girls peering into the window of Sally’s Giftique across the road. And the bougainvillea in next door’s garden so lovely you wanted to bite it. Then at three minutes to five—Pendel had somehow never doubted that Osnard would be punctual—along comes a brown Ford hatchback with an Avis sticker on the back window and pulls into the space reserved for customers. And this easygoing face with a cap of black hair on top of it, planted like a Halloween pumpkin in the windscreen. Why on earth Pendel should have thought Halloween he couldn’t fathom, but he thought it. It must have been the round black eyes, he told himself afterwards."|"Tailor of Panama"|"John le Carre"

An excellent choice if I may say so, and your grey suit in Panama is practically de rigger. I’ll bring you down the bolt and you can have a look and a feel. Marta! Shop, please, dear.”"|"Tailor of Panama"|"John le Carre"

"ap > 11:00"|"after eleven"|"It was after eleven when Pendel switched off the engine of his car and coasted to a halt twenty yards below the house in order not to wake the children. Then used both hands to open the front door, one to shove it and one to turn the key. Because if you shoved it first the lock worked smoothly; otherwise it went off like a pistol shot. He went to the kitchen and rinsed his mouth out with Coca-Cola in the hope that it would take away the brandy fumes. Then he undressed in the hall and laid his clothes on the chair before tiptoeing into the bedroom. Louisa had opened both windows, which was how she liked to sleep. Sea air wafted in from the Pacific. Drawing back the sheet, he saw to his surprise that she was naked like himself and wide awake and staring at him."|"Tailor of Panama"|"John le Carre"

If he would lash out, bawl at her, drag her into the garden where the children couldn’t hear and say: “Louisa, we’re all washed up, I’m leaving you, I’ve got someone else.” If that was what he had. Anything, absolutely anything, was better than the bland pretence that their life together was fine, nothing had changed, except that he just had to pop out and measure a valued customer at nine o’clock at night and come back three hours later, saying wasn’t it time they had the Delgados to dinner? And why not have the Oakleys and Rafi Domingo as well?

An embassy working party was set up with the harmless-sounding title of the Isthmus Study Group. A trio of morose technicians flew down from Washington and after three days of listening to walls pronounced them deaf. And at seven o’clock one turbulent Friday evening, the four conspirators duly assembled round the embassy rain-forestteak conference table and under the low light of a Ministry of Works lamp acknowledged by signature that they were privy to special material BUCHAN, provided by source BUCHAN under an operation code-named BUCHAN.

The new blue rugs and smart furnishings amazed him; so did the sight of the Sportsman’s Corner in Marta’s glass box and the shiny new frame round Braithwaite’s portrait. Who on earth did that? I did.
