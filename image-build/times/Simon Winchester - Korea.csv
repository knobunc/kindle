I had asked the defence attaché at the British Embassy in Seoul, and the American Defense Mapping Agency in Washington, if I could acquire some good English-language maps of Korea, but both, with weary you-should-know-better-than-to-ask sighs, had refused. In the end I discovered you could go into an ordinary Seoul shop and buy as decent a 1:250,000 or even 1:50,000 map as you could wish for, but for the script being in either Chinese characters (which I did not understand) or hangul (which I was trying to). I thus bought coverage of the entire country in the smaller-scale 1:250,000 for about £5; and I was not particularly alarmed to notice, in red letters on the reverse, a strict enjoinment to the effect that were I to take the map abroad without permission of the director general of the National Institute of Geography, I could be sent to prison for two years or fined 2 million won.

They were, I soon realized, excellent players. They hit hard and true, and their brown arms and legs, muscles taut as hawser wire, gleamed with fine sweat. They never said a word to each other. They just grunted with their exertion as they played, machinelike in their accuracy and speed, absolutely matched in their excellence. I became more fascinated as their game went on, rally after rally, never a ball lost or a shot missed, the net unmoved, the fault lines untouched, exchange after exchange after exchange.

It was not a cruel or mocking curiosity: the people who saw me, and who had never seen such a lumbering and hairy creature before—a head taller than most Koreans, pale and ghostly skinned, and covered with a primeval fur—were amazed. They had seen such creatures on television; now here was a real live one, and in their town, too. (Having said that, it has been reported that Koreans with blue eyes and light-coloured hair have been seen in both Namwon and Sunchon, cities where Hendrick Hamel and his party of shipwrecked Dutch sailors spent some years. Naju was one of the towns in which they had spent time en route to Seoul—my journey through Korea, it may be remembered, was designed to follow their approximate route—and it is entirely possible that genetic relics of the Dutchmen’s passage may still be found. I had imagined that a man who was a little taller than normal and had blue eyes and sandy hair might be living in Naju somewhere; but the locals’ reaction to me suggested that such a signal was totally alien—the collapse, I realized, of my small theory.

They repeated the same actions as the day before, beating, stabbing and mutilating unarmed civilians, including children, young girls, and aged grandmothers. They forced both men and women to strip naked, made others lie flat on the ground and kicked them. Several sources tell of soldiers stabbing or cutting off the breasts of naked girls; one murdered student was found disemboweled, another with an X carved in his back. About twenty high school girls were reported killed at Central High School. The paratroopers carried out searches in side streets, firing randomly into crowds, carted off the bodies in trucks, and piled them in the bus terminal. They even took the wounded out of hospitals. Ten high school students were killed in front of the Kaerim police box. The troopers chased two hundred students into the Catholic Center and then invaded the building and killed over a hundred. They had virtually declared open season on anyone under thirty, arresting and beating any they found on the streets. A dozen students were killed on the roof of the Kumyong building and thrown off.

So we weaved our way through a cold, spitting spring night, to the flickering lights of the Arirang yogwan. The matron was still awake, idly watching the television, and she poked her head around the door as we were removing our shoes. (There were a dozen pairs, and all, as is common in Korea, had their backs broken down—a conse quence of a system of politesse that requires the shoes to be taken off and put back on maybe twenty times a day. Cobblers, and shoe shops, make good money in Korea.)"|Korea|"Simon Winchester"

"ap 07:00"|seven|"The concierge whispered a few words to Choon-sil, who promptly collapsed in a fit of drunken giggles, and I had to hush her and take her to the room and quieten her down. When she had caught her breath she explained: the old woman had remarked on how sad it would be for this nice room—Western bed, naked girl on the wall, deep bath, and so on—to be wasted on a man alone. So good, she said to Choon-sil, that someone was going to share. ‘Except,’ Choon-sil said, her voice slurred both with weariness and an excess of maekju, ‘that I go to sleep, right away.’ And she did just that, and she snored boldly for hours. When I woke at seven she had already gone, and there was a note in English, saying how sorry she was for her distemper, and how she wished me good fortune with my final few miles. She had to be in her office in Yoido at eight: given the rush hour she had to wake at six, and the concierge had duly obliged."|Korea|"Simon Winchester"

12:00|noon|"The plan for the final few miles had had to be agreed on in Seoul with the commander of the UN garrison. To walk right up to the frontier, to the strange border-that-is-not-a-border that is formally known as the Military Demarcation Line, requires special permission. Military escorts are needed. Sentries need to be forewarned. One of the North Korean duty officers is told, out of politeness, and to head off any possibility of trouble that might stem from so unexpected an arrival in the sensitive area. And so that everything is expected—and because soldiers run the final miles—a timetable has to be agreed on. I had thus promised to be at the southern end of Freedom Bridge over the Imjin River at noon precisely. Provided I did that, the officer had told me over the phone a few days before, everything should go like clockwork."|Korea|"Simon Winchester"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"At eleven I was striding past yet another sprawling military base at the city of Munsan. A band was playing, its sousaphones and serpents gleaming in the steady sunshine. Two hundred soldiers in gleaming ceremonial helmets and white uniforms were wheeling and marching and countermarching on the parade ground. My feet moved involuntarily to the infantry pace, and I was out of town in moments and back in open country once more."|Korea|"Simon Winchester"
14:35|"2:35 P.M."|"I arrived at the line. It was 2:35 P.M. The stream, someone said, was called the Konshan-gang. ‘Please do not touch the MDL sign,’ said the black sergeant. ‘It’s part of the armistice agreement.’ The American soldiers stood foursquare before me, looking sternly into the middle distance, unsmiling. Behind them, no more than a stone’s throw away, the two North Koreans were now both out of their hut, looking with keen interest at this curious delegation. Someone mentioned—it may have been a joke—that the propaganda loudspeakers had just begun referring to this impoverished visitor who had been forced to walk all the way to the frontier, since he hadn’t enough money to buy a car. Someone else reported that the North Koreans had invited me to cross over to their side. Was the black car, then, waiting for me? Did I fancy that the North Koreans were beckoning to me?"|Korea|"Simon Winchester"
