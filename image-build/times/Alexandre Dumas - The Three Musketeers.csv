At five o’clock the next morning d’Artagnan arose, descended by himself to the kitchen, and asked for (among other ingredients the names of which have been lost) some wine, some oil, and some rosemary. Then, with his mother’s recipe in his hand, he prepared a balm that he applied to his numerous wounds, replacing his bandages himself and refusing the aid of a doctor. Thanks, no doubt, to the effectiveness of this Bohemian balm—and perhaps also thanks to the absence of a doctor—d’Artagnan was back on his feet by that evening.

From far off, muffled by shutters and distance, came the sound of drinking songs from the cabarets along the Pré-aux-Clercs. D’Artagnan turned right, up the Rue des Canettes, and crossed the Place Saint-Sulpice to where the street became the Rue Férou.

“Tomorrow at noon, Tréville.”
“Shall I bring only him?”"|"The Three Musketeers"|"Alexandre Dumas"

“At noon, Sire, we’ll be at the Louvre.”
“Ah . . . come in the back way, by the Petit Escalier, Tréville. There’s no point in letting the cardinal know about this.”"|"The Three Musketeers"|"Alexandre Dumas"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"That evening the three musketeers were informed they were to have the honor of a royal audience. They’d been acquainted with the king for some time so this was no novelty for them; but d’Artagnan, with his active Gascon imagination, imagined his fortune was made, and passed the night in golden dreams. By eight o’clock the next morning he was already knocking on Athos’s door."|"The Three Musketeers"|"Alexandre Dumas"
12:00|noon|"D’Artagnan found the musketeer dressed and ready to go out. As the audience with the king wasn’t until noon, he’d arranged to play tennis30 with Porthos and Aramis at the courts near the stables of the Luxembourg. Athos invited d’Artagnan to join them. Despite his ignorance of the game, which he’d never played, he accepted, not knowing what else to do with his time from nine in the morning until nearly noon."|"The Three Musketeers"|"Alexandre Dumas"

12:00|noon|"Porthos and Aramis were involved in their game, and Athos was watching them intently, so none of them saw their young comrade leave. He waited outside the door and less than a minute later the guard came down. D’Artagnan’s audience with the king was fixed for noon, so he had no time to lose. He looked around and, seeing the street deserted, said to his adversary, “My faith! It’s lucky you have to deal with only an apprentice musketeer, even if your name is Bernajoux. But don’t worry, I’ll do my best. En garde!”"|"The Three Musketeers"|"Alexandre Dumas"
12:00|noon|"“What you say makes sense,” replied d’Artagnan, “but unfortunately my time is short, as I have an appointment at noon. So if you please, Monsieur, en garde!”"|"The Three Musketeers"|"Alexandre Dumas"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"Excitement was at its height among the musketeers and their allies. They debated setting fire to the hôtel to punish the insolence of Monsieur de La Trémouille’s household for daring to attack King’s Musketeers. It looked like this proposal would be put into action, when fortunately the bells of the town struck eleven o’clock and d’Artagnan and his companions remembered their royal audience. They succeeded in calming the hotheads, who consoled themselves by hurling some paving stones at the gates of the mansion— but the gates wouldn’t budge, so they soon gave it up. Besides, their leaders had already left for the hôtel of Monsieur de Tréville, who was waiting for them, having heard of this latest outburst. “To the Louvre, and quickly,” he said, “to the Louvre without losing a moment. We must try to see the king before he’s swayed by the cardinal. We’ll describe this thing as a result of yesterday’s affair and the two will be disposed of together.”"|"The Three Musketeers"|"Alexandre Dumas"
"ap ~ 06:00"|"Around six o’clock"|"Around six o’clock Tréville announced it was time to go to the Louvre. The hour of their audience was long past, so instead of entering by the Petit Escalier, Tréville decided to await the king with his four young men in the main royal antechamber. When they arrived the king had not yet returned from the hunt, but they waited among the crowd of courtiers for no more than half an hour before the doors were thrown open and His Majesty was announced."|"The Three Musketeers"|"Alexandre Dumas"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"“Awaken me? Do you think I sleep? I never sleep anymore, Monsieur; I dream sometimes, that’s all. Come as early in the morning as you like, come at seven o’clock—but take care, if your musketeers are guilty!”"|"The Three Musketeers"|"Alexandre Dumas"
"ap 06:30"|"half past six"|"However little the king slept that night, Tréville slept still less. He had advised his three musketeers and their comrade to be back at his hôtel by half past six the next morning. When he left for the Louvre he took them along. He promised nothing, assuring them only that their future, and his, depended upon this roll of the royal dice."|"The Three Musketeers"|"Alexandre Dumas"

The first, of course, was the one carrying Milady. The success of her plot had been confirmed by sight of the black flag that had been run up the mast of the admiral’s ship."|"The Three Musketeers"|"Alexandre Dumas"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"That same evening, Milady took to the road. Night overtook her, and she stopped at an inn to sleep. She left at five o’clock the next morning, and three hours later she entered Béthune."|"The Three Musketeers"|"Alexandre Dumas"

But you’ve been traveling for four days, as you told me yourself, and you’ve been up since five this morning; I’m sure you’d like a rest. Go to bed and sleep, and we’ll call you at dinner time.”"|"The Three Musketeers"|"Alexandre Dumas"

"ap < 10:00"|"nearly ten o’clock"|"By then it was nearly ten o’clock. Athos rose from his chair, belted on his sword, wrapped himself in a cloak, and left the inn. As everyone knows, in the provinces, by ten in the evening the streets are nearly deserted. Athos, however, was keen to find someone to whom he could address a question. Finally he met a late passerby, approached him, and spoke a few words. The man he addressed recoiled in fright and answered the musketeer’s words with only a gesture of direction. Athos offered the man a half-pistole to accompany him, but the man refused."|"The Three Musketeers"|"Alexandre Dumas"

As to the poisoner herself, the abbess had no news, except that she must have fled through the garden, where her footprints were visible in the sand. The door of the garden had been found shut and the key had disappeared."|"The Three Musketeers"|"Alexandre Dumas"
"ap ~ 08:30"|"about half past eight"|"Everything was as Athos had foreseen. Planchet had followed the same road as Athos; like Athos, he had noticed the bloodstains and the place where the horses had stopped. But he had gone farther than Athos, into the village of Festubert. There, drinking in a tavern, without even having to ask a question, he had learned that the night before, at about half past eight, a wounded man, who accompanied a lady traveling in a post-chaise, had been obliged to stop, unable to go any farther. His wound was blamed on thieves who had stopped the chaise in the wood. The man had remained in the village, but the woman had ordered a relay of horses and had continued on her way."|"The Three Musketeers"|"Alexandre Dumas"

Plan-chet took the same route, and by seven in the morning he was in Armentières."|"The Three Musketeers"|"Alexandre Dumas"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"There was only one traveler’s inn in the village, that of the postservice. Planchet had presented himself there as an out-of-work lackey in search of a job. He hadn’t chatted for more than ten minutes with the people of the inn before he’d learned that a woman, alone, had arrived at eleven o’clock the night before. She’d taken a room, sent for the innkeeper, and informed him that she planned to stay in the area for some time."|"The Three Musketeers"|"Alexandre Dumas"
20:00|"eight in the evening"|"At eight in the evening Athos ordered the saddling of the horses, and sent to inform Lord Winter and his friends that they should prepare for an expedition."|"The Three Musketeers"|"Alexandre Dumas"

00:00|midnight|"It was midnight, or very nearly. The waning crescent moon, bloodied by the last traces of the storm, rose behind the little village of Armentières, its wan light making dark silhouettes of the town’s houses and a skeleton of its ornamental steeple. Before them the waters of the Lys rolled like a flow of molten pewter. On the opposite bank a shadowy mass of trees was outlined against the unsettled sky, where dark umber clouds shuddered and shed a sort of twilight in the midst of the blackness. To the left arose an old abandoned windmill with its broken vanes, whence came the regular, monotonous, and shrill cry of an owl. Here and there in the fields, to the right and left of the road along which the funereal procession marched, appeared a few low, stunted trees, looking like deformed dwarfs craning for a view of the men who were abroad at this sinister hour."|"The Three Musketeers"|"Alexandre Dumas"
15:00|"three in the afternoon"|"The next day, at three in the afternoon, they arrived at Surgères, where the cardinal awaited Louis XIII. The minister and the king embraced each other enthusiastically, and congratulated themselves on the lucky chance that had rid France of a relentless enemy who had incited all Europe against her. After which the cardinal, who had been informed by Rochefort that d’Artagnan had been arrested, and who was impatient to see him, took his leave of the king, inviting him to come the next day to view the dyke blocking the harbor, now completed."|"The Three Musketeers"|"Alexandre Dumas"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"For the four friends, it was a good time to be alive. Athos spent a great deal of time gambling, always unluckily. Nonetheless, he never borrowed a sou41 from his friends, though his purse was always at their services.

D’Artagnan, though not a musketeer, performed the duties of one with touching dedication. He was always on guard, because he always kept company with whichever one of his friends was on duty. Everyone knew him at the mansion of the musketeers, where he soon had the reputation of a good comrade. Monsieur de Tréville, who had appreciated him at first glance, and who genuinely liked him, recommended him regularly to the king."|"The Three Musketeers"|"Alexandre Dumas"
