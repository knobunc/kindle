"ap 08:00"|"eight o'clock"|"In these circumstances alone one knows when someone is going to die. All other deaths can be predicted, conjectured, even anticipated with some certainty, but not to the hour, the minute, with no room for hope. Vera would die at eight o'clock and that was that. I began to feel sick. I lay there exaggeratedly still, listening for some sound from the next room. If I was awake my father would be. About my mother I was less sure. She had never made a secret of her dislike of both his sisters. It was one of the things which had made a rift between them, though there they were together in the next room, in the same bed still. People did not break a marriage, leave each other, so lightly in those days."|"A Dark-Adapted Eye"|"Barbara Vine"
"ap 06:30"|Six-thirty|"A floorboard creaked in the passage. I heard the bedroom door close and then the door of the bathroom, so I got up and looked at the day. A clean white still morning, with no sun and no blue in the sky, a morning that seemed to me to be waiting because I was. Six-thirty. There was an angle you could stand at looking out of this window where you could see no other house, so plentiful were the trees and shrubs, so thick their foliage. It was like looking into a clearing in a rather elaborate wood. Vera used to sneer at where my parents lived, saying it was neither town nor country."|"A Dark-Adapted Eye"|"Barbara Vine"

This was before he went to live in the gardens of the Orcellari – the Otello restaurant is on the corner at the top – and the address was a street off the Viale Gramsci, up near where the Porta a' Pinti once stood. Jamie wrote back by return. He had heard of me, Francis had mentioned the existence of a cousin and said we knew each other when he was a child, but of that he had no recollection.

My inquisitive friend hadn't, of course, looked at the letters, though I had been on tenterhooks that she would. She had withdrawn them, or some of them, from the large brown envelope that held them all and pushed them back again with a quick explanation that these must be family letters.

An enormous spread of tea had been prepared in my honour. There was as yet no shortage of food and I was never to see in that house a lack of the kind of constituents that go to make cakes and pies and biscuits. Vera had no refrigerator. Few people did in 1939. Her Victoria sponge and gingerbread, lemon-curd tarts, Banbury cakes, drop scones and almond slices were on the kitchen table covered with clean, ironed teacloths to keep off the flies. Vera stayed always thin as a rail, though eating her fair share of that rich, sweet stuff. As we carried the cakes in, arranging them on the dining-table, laying the plates on a cloth embroidered by Eden in lazy-daisy and stem stitch, Vera (having adjured me not to drop anything, she hoped I wasn't a ‘butterfingers’) apologized for the poor quality of the tea and the lack of variety."|"A Dark-Adapted Eye"|"Barbara Vine"
"ap 05:00"|"five o'clock"|"Young girls change so much in adolescence. This is apparent not only to their seniors but to children like me. It was a year since I had seen Eden and if I had met her in the street I would not have known her. She was beautiful and she was grown-up. The Veronica Lake hairdo was not yet in fashion and she wore her hair in that style too awful ever to have been revived, the front rolled up and back into a sausage, the back hanging loose. Eden's beauty could not be spoiled by it. To me it seemed wonderfully chic. She had a gymslip on, a plain, round-neck pinafore, not one of the old box-pleated kind, a dark red blazer with her school crest on the pocket, and hanging from one shoulder, her satchel. She kissed me and called me her little niece in a very kindly way, asked me how my parents were – Vera had forgotten to mention my mother but Eden did not – and said she hoped the train journey had been pleasant. Then she went away to her room, emerging ten minutes afterwards with powder on her nose and lipstick on her lips, her school tunic changed for a skirt and blouse. She seemed even older. We sat down to Vera's enormous tea, working our way through sandwiches and cakes and buns, and tea was always to be the principal meal of the day, this first one being no festive exception. It seems strange to me now to think of those teas, the bread and butter and mountains of sweet food we ate, at least four rounds of bread each, at least one slice of cake, a series of small buns, slices, biscuits, cupcakes. None of us put on weight or came out in spots. And we ate like that every day as a matter of course at five o'clock, Vera encouraging Eden and now me to stuff ourselves, saying it was all good, wholesome and home-made food. She seemed to have the idea that everything bought in a shop was bad for you and everything made at home good for you, a widely held view responsible, no doubt, for many an untimely death."|"A Dark-Adapted Eye"|"Barbara Vine"

Somehow, young as I was, I already knew that, though they had sent me to bed because they were tired of my company, so could scarcely care whether I slept or sat up all night reading provided I were out of the way, nevertheless they would not admit this, they never, never would, but would insist that the bedtime they had ordained was for my own health and well-being. Therefore they had better not see my light still on at nearly 9.30. Once it was out, the ticking seemed to grow much louder. The room was not dark, for the moon had come up, a glowing, yellow harvest moon. It afforded enough light for my purposes… I got out of bed, set one of the cushions on the seat of the pale blue and gilt Lloyd Loom chair and stuck the clock on it, having first wrapped it up in my dressing-gown."|"A Dark-Adapted Eye"|"Barbara Vine"
"ap ~ 07:30"|"about seven-thirty"|"The peace was so beautiful that I tried to stay awake simply for the pleasure of listening to the silence. This, of course, had the effect of sending me to sleep. When I woke up in the morning at about seven-thirty, I remembered the clock and fetched it in, beaded all over with dew but still ticking. There was no reason, I thought, why I shouldn't do this every night. Rain might present problems but I would worry about that when the time came. I began to wish I knew the proper time to get up and if I went into the bathroom, would I be keeping Eden, who certainly had a prior claim, out of it? The house was silent. I debated what to do and after about ten minutes, having decided that Vera and Eden were still in bed, I got up and went into the bathroom to wash. Later on Vera was to ask me why I hadn't had a bath and to adjure me to take a daily bath and not be ‘lackadaisical’ about it. There was still no sound in the house."|"A Dark-Adapted Eye"|"Barbara Vine"
"ap 08:15"|eight-fifteen|"Eden said that I had nearly missed her. She had to leave at eight-fifteen. Her voice was full of reproach and the implication that to come down to breakfast at this hour was to show a lazy disposition. Vera, who had sprung up when I came in and was now tensely poised between larder and stove, asked me what I should like for breakfast. A variety of foods was reeled off at high speed: poached eggs, boiled eggs, fried eggs, bacon, cereal, toast. There was, however, no porridge. Porridge, she said, was too much trouble to make when neither she nor Eden was likely to eat it. I said I hated porridge."|"A Dark-Adapted Eye"|"Barbara Vine"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o'clock"|"The question of whether I should still be sent to bed at eight o'clock was one that I had been anxious about. Francis's presence, though in so many ways upsetting, eased my mind a little. They could hardly send me to bed and let him stay up, and somehow the two of us being sent to bed in the same ignominious fashion would be preferable to my isolated banishment. But soon after tea Francis disappeared."|"A Dark-Adapted Eye"|"Barbara Vine"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"The rector of the parish of Great Sindon was called the Reverend Richard Morrell. I had spoken of him as the vicar for which I was roundly reproved by Vera and told not to be so silly, but in my ignorance I thought all clergymen of the Church of England were vicars, I thought of it as a generic term like ‘butcher’. Vera went to church most Sundays, usually to Evensong. For some reason never made clear to me, my father did not want me to be confirmed. I suppose he had lost his faith or had ceased to accept formalized religion. At the time I rather resented missing this surely indispensable part of my education. A large framed photograph, much admired by me, of Eden in her white confirmation dress with a veil over her hair stood on the piano in the living-room at Laurel Cottage. Though lacking this positive entrée to the elect, or even the promise of it, I sometimes went to church with Vera, especially on the evenings when Eden came too. To walk along the village street with my two aunts, each of us carrying a Prayer Book – for no reason that I can fathom since a copy was placed in front of every pew seat – helped me towards that ‘belonging’ for which I was ever striving. After the service, we all shook hands with Mr Morrell, big, heavy and unkempt-looking, with the reputation of keeping the communion bread unwrapped in the pocket of his surplice. He was first cousin to a very eminent man who had been the Master of Balliol. I called him ‘a master at’ Balliol because I thought I had misheard and if he was head of a college he would have been called a headmaster, an error for which I again got the rough side of Vera's tongue."|"A Dark-Adapted Eye"|"Barbara Vine"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"I was at Sindon for the long summer holidays only for, blasé now about raids, my parents had had me back home for Easter and there I had stayed, reverting to old school and old friends. I was never again to ‘live’ at Laurel Cottage, only to go back for holidays, drawn by the prospect of time spent with Anne. Vera, too, had written to ask me. I was surprised by this and immensely gratified. Why is it that when people are never specially nice to us or warm, we long all the more for their affection so that the least little crumb they let fall is bounty? I didn't like Vera, I didn't admire her, and I'm sure she never liked me, and yet I was inordinately pleased at her inviting me. Why, soon she would be letting me stay up till ten and confiding in me the truth behind all those secrets!"|"A Dark-Adapted Eye"|"Barbara Vine"
"ap 07:30"|seven-thirty|"Eden had gone but before she went she had brought home a boyfriend. Not that Vera would have used this word (it wasn't in anything like the general use for lover it is today, signifying a sixty-year-old live-in common-law husband, for instance), or even have implied there might be anything remotely sexual in Chad Hamner's interest in Eden or hers in him. Vera would probably have referred to Chad as Eden's ‘friend’ if she had mentioned him at all or introduced him. These, though, weren't her ways. I came home dutifully at seven-thirty from an afternoon and evening at the Cambuses' to find a strange man sitting in the living-room with Vera and – wonder of wonders at this hour! – Francis. They were all drinking sherry, something one never saw any more and had never seen at Laurel Cottage."|"A Dark-Adapted Eye"|"Barbara Vine"
"ap 08:35"|"twenty-five minutes to nine"|"He was rewarded by congratulatory laughter from Chad and a glare from his mother. For a moment or two he sat in one of his mystifying silences, not exactly smiling but looking immensely pleased with himself without smiling, and then he got up and said he was going to bed. Vera was thus foiled and had to take her frustration out on me, asking me as a preliminary if I knew what time it was, and then proceeding as if twenty-five minutes to nine was the small hours. I went upstairs and consoled myself by daubing my face with Miner's Liquid Make-up and Tangee lipstick. Chad soon went home. I heard Vera go out into the kitchen to wash the glasses before settling down with the Daily Telegraph crossword."|"A Dark-Adapted Eye"|"Barbara Vine"

He will be bound to look in when he knows I'm home.’ Later on she had it out with me. Incongruously, this scolding took place in our air-raid shelter, for the inconsistencies of life being what they are, the Germans chose to bomb London that night – or at least deceived us into thinking they would do so. I can't recall hearing gunfire or the distant thunder of bombs, but the alert sounded at one in the morning, and everyone came down and woke me up."|"A Dark-Adapted Eye"|"Barbara Vine"
"ap 06:00"|"six o'clock"|"Jamie was christened in August. I was going to stay with Vera for two weeks, my father joining me for a day and a night to attend the christening. It was as well we were there, for no other members of the family were, not Eden, not Francis, not Helen. Already formed in my mind was an image of how Vera would be with a baby. Routine-driven, I thought, everything done by the clock, a fanatical emphasis on hygiene, cot sheets ironed as well as laundered and napkins, too, I wouldn't have been surprised. He could not disappear at bed-time and be hunted through the house and streets but it could be impressed upon his infant ears that six o'clock was the crucial hour, the point in time after which no well-conditioned baby should be out of his cot."|"A Dark-Adapted Eye"|"Barbara Vine"

Eden had refused to wear slipper satin which was the fashion and had a billowing dress made (she told Vera and me) out of twenty yards of white tulle. She spent the night before the wedding at Laurel Cottage and Vera was the first to see her dressed in this amazing confection with its tight bodice and sleeves and huge skirt. A girl who worked for a local hairdresser (and who lived with her parents in Inkerman Terrace next door to the house that had been the Marches') came at nine in the morning to do her hair first and then Vera's. My hair, being very long and straight, didn't need doing. The night before, it had been quite like old times, Francis sleeping in the room on the other side of the landing, Eden and I sharing her room, the beds still as far removed from each other as possible. When she opened one of the drawers in the dressing-table to hunt about for a pair of eyebrow tweezers, guilt got hold of me and I wondered if she had ever noticed my incursions into her privacy, if I had left a long, brown hair behind or the marks of none-too-clean twelve-year-old fingers. But it was soon apparent that she had discarded every cosmetic and perfume that dressing-table had contained. She had gone up the scale now and nothing but top-rank French toiletries would do for her. But her sophistication did not extend to the appointments of the room. Before she got into bed, she unhooked the Peter Pan photograph from the wall."|"A Dark-Adapted Eye"|"Barbara Vine"

I think this must have been just before she met the new Mrs Cambus, who was to become her dear friend and support (and principal witness for the defence at her trial), or at any rate before she got to know her well, for in saying goodbye to me she did not mention her but merely told me to be sure and bolt the back door after me when I came in. How far I had progressed in growing up since the eight o'clock bedtime days – or how far she had in tolerance!

The gate in the back fence of the Cambuses' garden led into a narrow lane or path that eventually, after crossing the edge of a field, cutting the corner of a farmyard and running between high flint walls, passed the back fence of the Laurel Cottage garden. The reason I avoided it was the farmer's dog, a black Labrador with a nasty temper. But this dog I had seen from the Cambuses' living-room window, setting out on a walk, correctly leashed, with its owner, so I took to the path, having switched on my torch.

He would refer to ‘adults’ instead of ‘grown-ups’ for instance, and get all his past tenses right, never saying ‘rided’ for ‘rode’, or ‘eated’ for ‘ate’. And he was a happy child, he was very happy then, I would vouch for that. I wonder if he remembered that visit, that day at Walbrooks, when he chose to call himself an Italian version of Richardson. After lunch, Helen showed us all the ‘surprise’ the General had given her for her birthday, a likeness by Augustus John of a sweet, plain-faced woman in a dark dress with a lace collar. It was her grandmother, taken in late middle age, and it had been sold when the old Richardsons had died in the twenties by the lawyer who managed the estate for Helen, the heir, and who had not known Helen would have wanted every memento in existence of Mary Richardson.

A curious thing happened as we approached the gravel sweep in front of the terrace. Eden came round the side of the house alone, walking slowly, pausing at the corner where a stone urn stood on the angle of the balustrade, and placing her hands on its pedestal stared first across the park, then in our direction.

I kept thinking how cross Eden would be. And it's so nearly impossible getting from Goodney to Sindon without a car. We had to get three buses and it was eight before we got home.

"ap 09:00"|nine|"Vera lied to Josie. She asked her to have Jamie because her solicitor was coming to see her about the divorce. Did Josie really believe this? Her own son was in practice by that time and she must have known solicitors don't usually travel miles out into the countryside to visit unimportant clients at nine in the morning. For it was as early as this that Vera expected Eden to come and by then she had already taken him to Josie. When I first heard this, I thought of Moses being hidden by his mother in the bulrushes and I looked up the story in Exodus and found it wasn't like that at all. She made him an ark out of bulrushes and hid it in the flags by the river's brink, flags presumably being irises. But Jamie's concealment wasn't much like any of this, he being five and not an infant. Though he was young for his age in his need for Vera. By midday he was crying and asking for her and Josie, harassed by it, took him home. If there really had been a solicitor and he had come at nine, he would surely be gone by twelve."|"A Dark-Adapted Eye"|"Barbara Vine"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"Vera had miscalculated. The reason probably was that Eden got up late as a matter of course. She can't have had much to occupy her. Instead of nine, she arrived at eleven. Even today I don't like to think of what Vera's state of mind must have been during those two hours. At least Jamie wasn't there. It isn't hard to imagine the kind of thing Vera would have said, not if you knew her as I did."|"A Dark-Adapted Eye"|"Barbara Vine"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o'clock"|"At ten o'clock, Eden arrived with June Poole and Mrs King. June was wearing the grey dress we had seen her in and a grey felt hat, requisite nanny's garb. Mrs King had a box of Black Magic chocolates. Sweets were still rationed in the spring of 1950 (and were to be for years longer) so these chocolates would have been accounted a rare prize, if a rather unsuitable choice as bribe for a child of six. It was a sunny morning, quite warm, and they found Jamie playing in the back garden of Laurel Cottage in a sandpit Vera had made for him up near the house. In my childhood and Eden's, the sandpit had been down at the bottom of the garden near the hovel, now irrevocably associated in my mind with the loves of Chad and Francis – but this would have been too far away for Vera. She needed him within her sight."|"A Dark-Adapted Eye"|"Barbara Vine"
