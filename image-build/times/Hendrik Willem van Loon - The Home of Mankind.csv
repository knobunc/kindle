12:00|mid-day|"Experience teaches us that as we approach the North Pole the angle between the lines drawn from the point at which we stand to the sun and to the horizon below the sun will gradually grow smaller. Thus in my figure the angle SA″ H″ is clearly less than the angle SA′ H′. This angle is therefore becoming smaller as the latitude grows higher. By using this fact the mathematicians were able to draw up tables giving the latitude of any place when its sun-horizon angle at mid-day has been measured."|"The Home of Mankind"|"Hendrik Willem van Loon"
"ap 00:00"|"twelve o’clock"|"For example, if we find (after careful calculations which every ship’s officer can make) that it is twelve o’clock where we are, but two o’clock by our chronometer (which gives us the exact Greenwich time), then we know that since the sun travels through fifteen degrees in one hour (which means four minutes for every single degree) and since there is a difference of two hours between our time and that of Greenwich, that we must have travelled exactly 2 × 15° = 30°. And we write down in the log-book (so called because it was originally used to record the ship’s rate of progress by means of a log of wood attached to a knotted cord and dropped into the water) that on such and such a day at noon our ship found itself at long. 30° west."|"The Home of Mankind"|"Hendrik Willem van Loon"

12:00|noon|"To-day that startling invention of the year 1735 has lost a great deal of its importance. Every day at noon the Greenwich Observatory broadcasts the correct time all over the world. Chronometers are rapidly becoming superfluous luxuries. Indeed, if we are to believe our navigators, wireless telegraphy will eventually do away with all our complicated tables and our diligent calculations and computations. Then that lengthy chapter of finding one’s way across those uncharted seas, where one wave looked so hopelessly much like the next that even the best of sailors could lose himself in less time than it takes to write down this sentence—then that marvellous chapter of courage and endurance and high intelligence will also have come to an end. The imposing man with the sextant will disappear from the bridge. He will sit in his cabin with a telephone clasped to his ear and he will ask: “Hallo, Plymouth! or Hallo, Nantucket! or Hallo, Cherbourg! Where am I?” And Plymouth, or Nantucket, or Cherbourg will tell him. And that will be that."|"The Home of Mankind"|"Hendrik Willem van Loon"
"ap 04:00"|400|"The earth turns upon its own axis in twenty-four hours. The earth revolves round the sun in about 365¼ days. To get rid of that ¼ day and keep the calendar more or less pure (no, it is not correct, but it is extremely doubtful whether the nations just now would find time in which to agree upon a decent revision) we have a year of 366 days, or leap-year, every four years except in the years which end with two zeros, such as 900, 1100, 1300, or 1900. But the years which can be divided by 400 are an exception to this exception. The last exception was Anno Domini 1600. The next one will be the year of grace 2000."|"The Home of Mankind"|"Hendrik Willem van Loon"

Bergen, the old Hansa settlement which looked after the commercial needs of the entire Norwegian coast, is now connected with Oslo by means of a railway. So is Trondheim with a branch road that leads to the Baltic coast of Sweden. Further north, well above the Arctic Circle, lies Narvik, the harbour for the Swedish iron ore from Lapland. Tromso and Hammerfest smell everlastingly of fish. These names occur here because it rarely happens that one finds human beings living comfortably at latitude 70°."|"The Home of Mankind"|"Hendrik Willem van Loon"
"ap 01:00"|one|"West of the Gobi desert lies the slightly lower plateau of east Turkestan or Sinkiang. It is the valley of the Tarim River, which aimlessly loses itself in the nearby lake of Lob-nor, famous through the discoveries of the Swedish traveller Sven Hedin. On the map the Tarim looks like a small desert brook. Yet it is one and a half times as long as the Rhine. For remember, Asia is the country of the gigantic proportions."|"The Home of Mankind"|"Hendrik Willem van Loon"
