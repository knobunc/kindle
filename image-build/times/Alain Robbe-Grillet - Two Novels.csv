12:00|noon|"Sitting facing the valley, in one of the armchairs of local manufacture, A ... is reading the novel borrowed the day before; they have already spoken about it at noon. She continues reading, without raising her eyes, until the daylight becomes too faint. Then she raises her head, closes the book—which she puts within arm's reach on the low table—and remains staring straight in front of her, toward the openwork balustrade and the banana trees on the opposite slope, soon invisible in the darkness. She seems to be listening to the noise that rises on all sides from the thousands of crickets inhabiting the low ground. But it is a continuous, ear-splitting sound without variations, in which nothing can be distinguished."|"Two Novels"|"Alain Robbe-Grillet"
12:00|noonday|"The light, rubber-soled shoes make no sound on the hallway tiles. The door turns on its hinges without squeaking. The office floor is tiled too. The three windows are closed and their blinds are only half-open, to keep the noonday heat out of the room."|"Two Novels"|"Alain Robbe-Grillet"

"~ 01:00"|"around one in the morning"|"But delays are always likely on these bad roads. Even if they start back at the expected time, immediately after a quick dinner, the travellers might not get home until around one in the morning, or even much later."|"Two Novels"|"Alain Robbe-Grillet"
12:00|noon|"She is in full sunlight. The sun strikes her directly on the forehead. But she does not mind it, even at noon. Her foreshortened shadow falls perpendicularly across the flagstones of which it covers, lengthwise, no more than one. A quarter of an inch behind it begins the roof shadow, parallel with the railing. The sun is almost at its zenith."|"Two Novels"|"Alain Robbe-Grillet"

"ap 06:30"|six-thirty|"The light quickly fades. The sun has disappeared behind the rocky spur that borders the main section of the plateau. It is six-thirty. The deafening racket of the crickets fills the whole valley—a constant grating with neither nuance nor progression. Behind, the whole house has been empty since daybreak."|"Two Novels"|"Alain Robbe-Grillet"

"ap 06:30"|six-thirty|"Very quickly the luminous background becomes more somber. On the opposite hillside, the clumps of banana trees grow blurred in the twilight.
It is six-thirty.
Now the dark night and the deafening racket of the crickets again engulf the garden and the veranda, all around the house."|"Two Novels"|"Alain Robbe-Grillet"

A little farther along among the toilet utensils is a large round alarm clock —doubtless stopped—whose hands indicate a quarter to four."|"Two Novels"|"Alain Robbe-Grillet"
"ap 06:00"|six|"A and Franck are sitting in comfortable armchairs, their arms resting on the arms of the chairs, their hands parallel, motionless. Conversation? The narrator suggests one or two themes — commentaries by A and Franck on a novel with an African decor; the account of motor trouble. One day Franck announces a plan to go to town to buy a truck and visit certain agents: A will accompany him, to make several purchases. A and Franck have left in the car for town, 50 kilometers from the plantation, at six one morning. They were scheduled to return around midnight. Motor trouble has kept them from doing so, and they have spent the night at a hotel. Upon their return, they have offered no details. The next day, or perhaps two weeks or a month earlier — the narrator no longer knows — A and Franck are sitting at table. A notices a centipede on the white wall of the dining room. Franck gets up, wads his napkin and squashes the insect. The black stain remains on the wall, a few stumps of its limbs Utter the tile floor. A watches, her clenched fist closes over her knife. The horror inspired by the insect, Franck's sadistic gesture, the motionless presence of the two observers — everything contributes to giving this incident the scope of a symbolic prefiguration. We are beholding the gesture of murder. Who has been killed? Who will be the killer?"|"Two Novels"|"Alain Robbe-Grillet"
