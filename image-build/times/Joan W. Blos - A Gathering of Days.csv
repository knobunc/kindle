03:00|"three in the morning"|"Mrs. Shipman’s sister arrived last night—very late but in good spirit despite her lengthy journey. It was nearly mid-night when the coach reached the bridge where, her arrival being expected, Mr. Shipman met her and fetched her belongings home. She left Boston at three in the morning, having travelled there from Salem."|"A Gathering of Days"|"Joan W. Blos"
12:00|mid-day|"At mid-day today the storm let up; by dusk a few pale shadows appeared on the hillock’d snow. Father expects that tomorrow will be the day of the breaking out. This time we may go with him if the weather’s not too severe!"|"A Gathering of Days"|"Joan W. Blos"
">> 12:00"|"long after noon"|"We stayed till it was long after noon. The way home lying mostly uphill we had a leisurely journey of it—taking our pleasure in the newly cleared road and telling each other the news we’d gleaned during our hours in town."|"A Gathering of Days"|"Joan W. Blos"
12:00|mid-day|"While I prepared our mid-day dinner Father came to talk about the day that I was born. He remembers well it had snowed nine inches just the night before my birth, and ten the day preceding. Most of the previous snow had melted and they’d had flooding on River Street down in Holderness. The sun’s first rays came in to the room as I came in to the world. They’d wrapped me well and there, with my mother, I lay in the room which they’d planned for the purpose and called the borning room."|"A Gathering of Days"|"Joan W. Blos"
"ap 09:00"|"9 o’clock"|"Wagons and chaises surrounded the green whereon at 9 o’clock promptly the militia paraded. Presently all the marchers stopped, and stood most steadily in their places, while fife and fiddle & drummers performed, the last of their tunes being Yankee Doodle, which was the most applauded. Next was read, in ringing tones, the Declaration of Independence; this being followed by a prayer given by the militia captain. A soldier’s prayer is even more forceful than one by a minister. (Perhaps ’tis the unexpectedness of some-time strength so sweetly gentled? I am reminded of that day when Father insisted that he alone would attend the cooking.)"|"A Gathering of Days"|"Joan W. Blos"
11:00|"11 o’clock in the morning"|"Dan’l and Asa soon slipped off, and Father went with Uncle Jack to refresh himself at the tavern. However, we women wanted not for diversion, & hardly knew they were gone! The scene before us was constantly changing and, at 11 o’clock in the morning, the oration was given. A Judge J Wax came down from Plymouth especially for the event. At the end he espied two fellows with thin white hair & pipe stem legs, wearing what seemed the well-worn remains of that well-loved uniform—the buff coloured trousers & deep blue coats of General Washington’s soldiers. The speaker’s eager imagination placed them both at Valley Forge, and lauded them as patriots by whose example we might be inspired, and called on them to reply."|"A Gathering of Days"|"Joan W. Blos"
12:00|mid-day|"By mid-day, it having grown quite warm, we sat beside the wagon, grateful for the wedge of shade that its height afforded. There did we eat the meal we’d brought—the outdoor air enhancing its flavour—and presently Father re-appeared to keep us company. He’d heard reports of burns, one maiming, through misfired explosions."|"A Gathering of Days"|"Joan W. Blos"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"She will find this a studious house. Edw. reads so beautifully! Every evening, from eight o’clock till ten, he engages us in study! I know I can not begin to tell you the bliss of these short hours! We have already read much in French, and some philosophy."|"A Gathering of Days"|"Joan W. Blos"
