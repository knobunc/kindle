"ap 11:27"|"eleven twenty-seven"|"""Good work! This course takes us right through a planetary system in a few minutes and well have to unload there. Let's see . . this chart marks planets two and three as inhabited, but with a red reference number, eleven twenty-seven. Um . . m . ."|"Galactic Patrol"|"E. E. _doc_ Smith"
12:00|noon|"""Ouch!” groaned Kinnison. ""If that means what I think it does, all hell's out for noon. Did you see any numbering recorders on those ports? I didn't -- of course neither of us thought of such a thing. Hold it -- here comes some more stuff."|"Galactic Patrol"|"E. E. _doc_ Smith"
"< 12:00"|"almost noon"|"And eventually came Tregonsee's announcement that it was almost noon, and that now, for half an hour or so, it would be calm enough for the spaceship to leave the port."|"Galactic Patrol"|"E. E. _doc_ Smith"
12:00|noon|"""Blast!"" the captain commanded, unnecessarily, for the alert pilot had already set the course and was kicking in full-blast drive. ""If that baby is what I think it is, all hell's out for noon."""|"Galactic Patrol"|"E. E. _doc_ Smith"
12:00|noon|"""Let me finish, please,"" the Lensman interrupted. ""As soon as the mauler turns back it is practically certain that your captain will send out a message, letting the pirates know that he is easy prey. Within a minute after sending that message, he dies. So does every other pirate aboard. Your ship lands on Valeria and takes on a crew of space fighting wildcats, headed by Peter vanBuskirk. Then it goes  on toward Alsakan, and when the pirates board that ship, after its prearranged half-hearted resistance and easy surrender, they are going to think that all hell's out for noon. Especially since the mauler, back from her `rescue work, will be tagging along, not too far away."""|"Galactic Patrol"|"E. E. _doc_ Smith"
"ap 00:00"|twelve|"""Better call it twelve, I think-ten at least. You see, some of the fractures, especially those in the left leg, and a couple of burns, are rather severe, as such things go. Then, too, the length of time elapsing between injury and treatment didn't do anything a bit of good."""|"Galactic Patrol"|"E. E. _doc_ Smith"
"ap 02:30"|"two hours and thirty minutes"|"""Vice-Commander Krimsky, as senior officer, you are now in command of this base,"" he remarked. ""While I am in no sense giving you orders, there are a few matters about which you should be informed. First, I set no definite time as to when you may leave this room-I merely state that you will find it decidedly unhealthy to follow us at all closely as we go from here to the hospital ship. Second, you haven't a ship fit to take the ether, your main injector toggles have all been broken off at the pivots. If your mechanics work at top speed, new ones can be put on in exactly two hours. Third, there is going to be a severe earthquake in precisely two hours and thirty minutes, one which should make this base merely a memory."""|"Galactic Patrol"|"E. E. _doc_ Smith"
"ap 02:30"|"two hours and a half"|"""Hardly,"" he reproved her. ""That isn't due for two hours and a half yet, but it’ll happen on scheduled time."""|"Galactic Patrol"|"E. E. _doc_ Smith"
20:15|"fifteen minutes after twenty"|"""Plus two for allowances. QX----at exactly hour 20, ten weeks from today, let every projector of every vessel you can possibly get there cut loose on that base with everything they can pour in. There's a detailed drawing in here somewhere . . . here-twenty-six main objectives, you See. Blast them all, simultaneously to the second. If they all go down, the rest will be possible-if not, it'll be just too bad. Then work along these lines here, straight from those twenty-six stations to the dome, blasting everything as you go. Make it last exactly fifteen minutes, not a minute more or less. If, by fifteen minutes after twenty, the main dome hasn't surrendered by cutting its screen, blast that, too, if'"|"Galactic Patrol"|"E. E. _doc_ Smith"
"ap ~ 11:00"|"about eleven o'clock"|"Eventually, however, he approached Trench and located without difficulty the Patrol's spaceport. Fortunately, it was then at about eleven o'clock, so that he did not have to wait long to land. He drove downward inert, sending ahead of him a thought."|"Galactic Patrol"|"E. E. _doc_ Smith"

"<< 12:00"|"Well before noon"|"Well before noon the last kilogram of impalpable, purplish blue powder was put into its impermeable sack. The machinery was cleaned, and untouched leaves, the waste, and the contaminated sir were blown out of the spaceport, and the room and its occupants were sprayed with antithionite. Then and only then did the crew remove their masks and air-filters. Trench Spaceport was again a Patrol post, no longer a zwilnik's paradise."|"Galactic Patrol"|"E. E. _doc_ Smith"
