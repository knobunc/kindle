"ap 04:00"|"four o'clock"|"At four o'clock, one of them got to take a ten-minute break, out back. If Rydell did the curb check, it meant he got to take his break first, then let Durius take one. The curb check was something that Lucky Dragon's parent corporation, back in Singapore, had instituted on the advice of an in-house team of American cultural anthropologists. Mr. Park, the night manager, had explained this to Rydell, ticking off points on his notebook. He'd tapped each paragraph on the screen for emphasis, sounding thoroughly bored with the whole thing, but Rydell had supposed it was part of the job, and Mr. Park was a definite stickler. “In order to demonstrate Lucky Dragon's concern with neighborhood safety, security personnel will patrol curb in front of location on a nightly basis.’” Rydell had nodded. “You not out of store too long,” Mr. Park added, by way of clarification. “Five minute. Just before you take break.” Pause. Tap. “‘Lucky Dragon security presence will be high-profile, friendly, sensitive to local culture.’”"|"All Tomorrow's Parties"|"William Gibson"

Kids on dancer, tweaked off their dimes, hallucinating monster movies. Guess who gets to be the monster? Plus there's your more mature sociopaths; older, more complicated, polypharmic…”"|"All Tomorrow's Parties"|"William Gibson"

They kept maybe half the security shut down because people were in and out all day, and there was always someone there."|"All Tomorrow's Parties"|"William Gibson"

07:00|"seven in the morning"|"It was an old building, in the kind of area where buildings like that were usually converted to residential, but the frequency of razor wire suggested that this was not yet gentrified territory. There were a couple of Universal square badges controlling entry, a firm that mostly did low-level industrial security. They were set up in an office by the gate, watching Real One on a flatscreen propped up on a big steel desk that looked like someone had gone over every square inch of it with a ball peen hammer. Cups of take-out coffee and white foam food containers. It all felt kind of homey to Rydell, who figured they'd be going off shift soon, seven in the morning. Wouldn't be a bad job, as bad jobs went."|"All Tomorrow's Parties"|"William Gibson"
07:00|"Seven in the morning"|"Creedmore was conducting a grooming operation in the illuminated mirror behind the passenger-side sun visor. This consisted of running his fingers repeatedly back through his hair, wiping them on his jeans, then rubbing his eyes. He considered the results. “Time for a drink,” he said to the reflection of his bloodshot eyes.
“Seven in the morning,” Rydell said.
“What I said,” Creedmore said, flipping the visor back up."|"All Tomorrow's Parties"|"William Gibson"
