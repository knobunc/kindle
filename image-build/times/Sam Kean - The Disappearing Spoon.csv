"ap 01:00"|1|"Although Lewis laid this theory out in the 1920s and 1930s, scientists are still pushing the edge of how strong they can make
         acids using his ideas. Acid strength is measured by the pH scale, with lower numbers being stronger, and in 2005 a chemist
         from New Zealand invented a boron-based acid called a carborane, with a pH of –18. To put that in perspective, water has a
         pH of 7, and the concentrated HCl in our stomachs has a pH of 1. But according to the pH scale’s unusual accounting methods,
         dropping one unit (e.g., from 4 to 3) boosts an acid’s strength by ten times. So moving from stomach acid, at 1, to the boron-based
         acid, at –18, means the latter is ten billion billion times stronger. That’s roughly the number of atoms it would take to
         stack them to the moon."|"The Disappearing Spoon"|"Sam Kean"

         the next generation of nuclear weapons. Von Neumann, Ulam, and their ilk would show up at the gymnasium-sized rooms where
         computers were set up and mysteriously ask if they could run a few programs, starting at 12:00 a.m. and running through the
         night. The weapons they developed during those dead hours were the “supers,” multistage devices a thousand times more powerful
         than standard A-bombs. Supers used plutonium and uranium to ignite stellar-style fusion in extra-heavy liquid hydrogen, a complicated process that never would have moved beyond secret military reports and
         into missile silos without digital computation. As historian George Dyson neatly summarized the technological history of that
         decade, “Computers led to bombs, and bombs led to computers.”"|"The Disappearing Spoon"|"Sam Kean"

00:00|midnight|"Similarly, the official definition of one second used to be about 1/86,400 of one spin on Earth’s axis (i.e., the number of
         seconds in one day). But a few pesky facts made that an inconvenient standard. Most important, the length of a day is slowly
         increasing trip because of the sloshing of ocean tides, which drag and slow earth’s rotation. To correct for this, metrologists slip in a “leap second” about every third year, usually when no one’s paying attention, at midnight on
         December 31. But leap seconds are an ugly, ad hoc solution. And rather than tie a supposedly universal unit of time to the
         transit of an unremarkable rock around a forgettable star, the U.S. standards bureau has developed cesium-based atomic clocks."|"The Disappearing Spoon"|"Sam Kean"
"> 20:00"|"after 1960"|"Cesium proved convenient as the mainspring for atomic clocks because it has one electron exposed in its outermost shell, with
         no nearby electrons to muffle it. Cesium’s heavy, lumbering atoms are fat targets for the maser that strums them as well.
         Still, even in plodding cesium, the outer electron is a quick bugger. Instead of a few dozen or few thousand times per second,
         it performs 9,192,631,770 back-and-forths every one-Mississippi. Scientists picked that ungainly number instead of cutting
         themselves off at 9,192,631,769 or letting things drag on until 9,192,631,771 because it matched their best guess for a second
         back in 1955, when they built the first cesium clock. Regardless, 9,192,631,770 is now fixed. It became the first base-unit
         definition to achieve universal e-mailability, and it even helped liberate the meter from its platinum rod after 1960."|"The Disappearing Spoon"|"Sam Kean"
