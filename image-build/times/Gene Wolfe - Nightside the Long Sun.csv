"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"The air of the place poured past her, hot and freighted with a hundred stale perfumes and the vinegar reek of wasted wine. “I was to meet Blood here at one o’clock,” Silk told her. “What time is it?”"|"Nightside the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"“We’re not now,” Orchid told him. “Not until nine, so you’ve got plenty of time. But tonight’s our biggest night, usually, so I’d appreciate it if you were finished by then.” At last noticing his averted eyes, she tugged ineffectually at the edges of the pink peignoir."|"Nightside the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"With florid sweeps of her quill, Orchid was writing the draft. “Tomorrow, right? When’ll it be?”
“I had thought at eleven.”
“I’ll be there, Patera.” Orchid’s face hardened. “We all will.”"|"Nightside the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"“Then I won’t ask you again,” Silk said. “And I’m not going to tell Orchid or Blood, unless I must to save someone else. If the Guard were investigating, I suppose I’d have to tell the officer in charge, but I believe it might be a far worse injustice to turn you over to Blood than to permit you to go unpunished. Since that’s the case, I’ll let you go unpunished, or almost unpunished, if you’ll do as I ask. Orpine’s service will take place at eleven tomorrow, at my manteion on Sun Street. Orchid’s going to demand that all of you to attend it, and doubtless many of you will. I want you to be among those who do.”"|"Nightside the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
12:00|noon|"As it was every day except Scylsday, “from noon until the sun can be no thinner,” the market was thronged. Here all the produce of Viron’s fields and gardens was displayed for sale or barter: yams, arrowroot, and hill-country potatoes; onions, scallions, and leeks; squashes yellow, orange, red, and white; sun-starved asparagus; beans black as night or spotted like hounds; dripping watercresses from the shrinking rivulets that fed Lake Limna; lettuces and succulent greens of a hundred sorts; and fiery peppers; wheat, millet, rice, and barley; maize yellower than its name, and white, blue, and red as well, spilling, leaking, and overflowing from baskets, bags, and earthenware pots—this though Patera Silk noted with dismay that prices were higher than he had ever seen them, and many of the stunted ears were missing grains."|"Nightside the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"“I really don’t know,” Silk confessed. “I saw one around noon today, and it hasn’t rained yet. As for spying upon Viron, what could a Flier see here that any foreign traveler couldn’t?”"|"Nightside the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
"ap 06:00"|six|"“It’d make you a fine sacrifice, Patera—the finest you could have, inside of the law. What was it I told you? Seven cards, was that it? Tell you what. I’ll make it six, but only for today. Just six cards, because I’ve heard good things about you and hope to do more business with you in the future.”"|"Nightside the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
00:00|midnight|"Where was he now, old Patera Pike? Where did he sleep, and did he sleep well there at last? Or did he wake as he always had, stirring in the long bedroom next to Silk’s own, his old bed creaking, creaking? Praying at midnight or past midnight, at shadeup with the skylands fading, praying as Viron extinguished its bonfires and its lanterns, its many-branched candelabras, praying as they were forfeited to the revealed sun. Praying as day’s uncertain shadows reappeared and resumed their accustomed places, as the morning glories flared and the long, white trumpets of the night silently folded themselves upon themselves."|"Nightside the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"

12:00|noon|"Erect at Patera Pike’s ambion, beside the luminous gray vacuity of the Sacred Window, Silk took a moment to observe the students before he began. All were poor, he knew; and for more than a few the noon meal that half a dozen mothers had prepared in the palaestra’s kitchen had been the first of the day. Yet most were almost clean; and all—under the sharp gaze of Maytera Rose, Maytera Marble, and Maytera Mint—were well behaved."|"Nightside the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"“I’d been praying and praying for help. Praying mostly to the Nine, of course, but praying to every god and goddess in the Writings at one time or another; and about noon today my prayers were answered by the Outsider, as I’ve told you. Maytera, do you…” His voice quavered, and he found that he could not control it. “Do you know what he said to me, Maytera? What he told me?”"|"Nightside the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"

"ap ~ 01:00"|"about one o’clock"|"Blood’s eyebrows shot up. “Excellent. You’re right. You always are.” He tossed the golden needler into Silk’s lap. “Here you go, Patera. Use it in good health—yours, I mean. We’re going to make a slight charge for it, though. Meet us about one o’clock at the yellow house on Lamp Street. Will you do that?”"|"Nightside the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
"ap 03:15"|"Quarter past three"|"Doctor Crane’s mystery gouged his back. He leaned forward. “What time is it, driver?”
“Quarter past three, Patera.”
He had done what the Outsider had wanted. Or at least he had tried—perhaps he had failed. As though a hand had drawn aside a veil, he realized that his manteion would live for another month now—a month at least, because anything might happen in a month. Was it possible that he had in fact accomplished what the Outsider had desired? His mind filled with a rollicking joy."|"Nightside the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
12:00|noon|"“In there,” the driver jerked his thumb at the yellow house, “they’ll be getting set to turn in now. They’ll sleep till noon, most likely.” He stretched, yawning. “So will I, if I can.”"|"Nightside the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
"ap > 11:00"|"after eleven"|"He staggered to his feet. The busy little clock beside his triptych declared that it was after eleven, nearly noon. He struggled to recall the positions of its hands when he had permitted himself to fall into bed. Eight, or after eight, or possibly eight-thirty. Teasel, poor little Teasel, had been bitten by an owl—or by a devil. A devil with wings, if it had come in through her window, and thus a devil twice impossible. Silk blinked and yawned and rubbed his eyes."|"Nightside the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"

"< 12:00"|"Nearly noon"|"To keep his mind from the ampule, Silk said, “I’m very sorry I missed our prayers this morning. What time is it, Maytera?”
“Nearly noon. Maytera Rose said you had to—is that a bird, Patera?”
Crane snapped, “Don’t jerk like that!”"|"Nightside the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
"ap 01:00"|"One o’clock"|"“One o’clock, sharp.” Silk carried the blanket into the sellaria; when he returned, he added, “I’m going to be late, I imagine; I doubt that he’ll do anything worse than complain about it.”"|"Nightside the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
