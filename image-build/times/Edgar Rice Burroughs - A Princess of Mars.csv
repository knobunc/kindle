"~ 15:00"|"about three in the afternoon"|"My last sight of Powell was about three in the afternoon as he entered the shadows of the range on the opposite side of the valley."|"A Princess of Mars"|"Edgar Rice Burroughs"
"ap ~ 09:00"|"About nine o'clock"|"About nine o'clock the moon was sufficiently bright for me to proceed on my way and I had no difficulty in following the trail at a fast walk, and in some places at a brisk trot until, about midnight, I reached the water hole where Powell had expected to camp. I came upon the spot unexpectedly, finding it entirely deserted, with no signs of having been recently occupied as a camp."|"A Princess of Mars"|"Edgar Rice Burroughs"

00:00|midnight|"Several times I thought I heard faint sounds behind me as of From then until possibly midnight all was silence, the silence of the dead; then, suddenly, the awful moan of the morning broke upon my startled ears, and there came again from the black shadows the sound of a moving thing, and a faint rustling as of dead leaves. The shock to my already overstrained nervous system was terrible in the extreme, and with a superhuman effort I strove to break my awful bonds. It was an effort of the mind, of the will, of the nerves; not muscular, for I could not move even so much as my little finger, but none the less mighty for all that. And then something gave, there was a momentary feeling of nausea, a sharp click as of the snapping of a steel wire, and I stood with my back against the wall of the cave facing my unknown foe."|"A Princess of Mars"|"Edgar Rice Burroughs"
12:00|midday|"It was midday, the sun was shining full upon me and the heat of it was rather intense upon my naked body, yet no greater than would have been true under similar conditions on an Arizona desert. Here and there were slight outcroppings of quartz-bearing rock which glistened in the sunlight; and a little to my left, perhaps a hundred yards, appeared a low, walled enclosure about four feet in height. No water, and no other vegetation than the moss was in evidence, and as I was somewhat thirsty I determined to do a little exploring."|"A Princess of Mars"|"Edgar Rice Burroughs"
"~ 12:00"|"About noon"|"could see them just as plainly, as I stood there under the moonlit We broke camp the next day at an early hour and marched with only a single halt until just before dark. Two incidents broke the tediousness of the march. About noon we espied far to our right what was evidently an incubator, and Lorquas Ptomel directed Tars Tarkas to investigate it. The latter took a dozen warriors, including myself, and we raced across the velvety carpeting of moss to the little enclosure."|"A Princess of Mars"|"Edgar Rice Burroughs"
"~ 12:00"|"About noon"|"At daybreak of the fifteenth day of my search I was overjoyed to see the high trees that denoted the object of my search. About noon from, and the nature of my errand."|"A Princess of Mars"|"Edgar Rice Burroughs"
00:00|midnight|"We traveled entirely by night, timing our marches so that we camped during the day at deserted cities where, even to the beasts, we were all kept indoors during the daylight hours. On the march Tars Tarkas, through his remarkable ability and statesmanship, enlisted fifty thousand more warriors from various hordes, so that, ten days after we set out we halted at midnight outside the great walled city of Zodanga, one hundred and fifty thousand strong."|"A Princess of Mars"|"Edgar Rice Burroughs"
