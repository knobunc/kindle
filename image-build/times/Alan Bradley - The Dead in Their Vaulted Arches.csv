"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"At the appointed time, which happened to be ten o’clock, we were all of us gathered more or less together on the little railway platform at Buckshaw Halt. I think it was the first time in my life I had ever seen Daffy without a book in her hand."|"The Dead in Their Vaulted Arches"|"Alan Bradley"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"As ten o’clock approached, everyone, as if at an arranged signal, fell suddenly quiet, and an unearthly hush settled upon the countryside. It was as though a bell jar had been lowered upon the land and all the world was holding its breath. Even the nightingale in the woods had abruptly ceased its song."|"The Dead in Their Vaulted Arches"|"Alan Bradley"

It would be transported by hearse to the front door of Buckshaw, from which point it would be carried inside and placed on trestles in Harriet’s boudoir, which was upstairs at the extreme south end of the west wing."|"The Dead in Their Vaulted Arches"|"Alan Bradley"

We shall each of us take turns standing vigil in six-hour watches in order of age, which means that I shall begin and Flavia shall finish. Kneeling benches have been laid on and Mrs. Mullet has seen to the candles.”"|"The Dead in Their Vaulted Arches"|"Alan Bradley"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"It would soon be two o’clock, and the villagers would begin arriving at Buckshaw to pay their respects to Harriet’s remains. Father would not want to be seen with moist eyes and had obviously gone next door to his own room to regain his composure. I knew that when the mourners arrived, they would find him showing only the stony face of that cold-fish colonel in whose shell he lived."|"The Dead in Their Vaulted Arches"|"Alan Bradley"

He himself would take the first shift of six hours, he had decided, from two until eight o’clock.

Aunt Felicity had at first been written off on grounds of age."|"The Dead in Their Vaulted Arches"|"Alan Bradley"
