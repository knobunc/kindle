"~ 02:00"|"around two in the morning"|"I rode my bike furiously home to Frogmore. My father was in Melbourne and wouldn’t be back until the early hours of the morning. I read the magazines, cut out some pictures, pasted them into an exercise book, and wrote a passionate text praising rock and roll in general and Presley in particular, defending him from attack by older generations who feared him as a leading figure in a movement that would overturn their values. I covered the book in brown paper and wrote a provocative title on the cover. I do not remember it exactly but it was something like ‘Elvis Presley: Devil or Liberator?’ I left the book on the kitchen table and went to bed at around two in the morning. My father read it when he came home. Next morning he was almost as angry as when I took his razor. He tore up the book. How I could have written it? Was this what I was coming to?"|"Romulus, My Father"|"Raimond Gaita"
"~ 17:00"|"around 5 p.m."|"The saloon itself occupied a smallish room at the front of one of the more imposing Victorian buildings in High Street. In a much larger room across the passage Mr Foschia kept his barrels. The saloon’s customers were predominantly immigrants who lived in the area, but it was also home to a small group of mostly Australian alcoholics. Mr Foschia—known to everyone as Gino—kept an insecure order in the bar and the fragility of this achievement made him tense. Every hour or so he came to the back of the house, walking with a heavy step, scraping his boots on the stone floor of the verandah, swearing in Italian. ‘Ostia! Porco Dio! Porca Madonna!’ he shouted in a gravelly voice. He then spat into the gully-trap, turned on the tap to wash the spit away and returned to the bar. After he had closed the saloon around 5 p.m., he relaxed by standing in his front doorway, his thumbs in his braces, surveying events in the street and greeting passers-by."|"Romulus, My Father"|"Raimond Gaita"
12:00|midday|"A week later Mitru came home from work at midday and fought with my mother over her neglect of Susan. He beat her again with his belt, bruising her about the arms and body with its buckle. Susan lay in her pram on the verandah, crying. Mitru took her in his arms and went off with her, but came back within an hour. He then rode his bicycle to the Pioneers’ Memorial Tower and dived fifteen metres to his death. My mother was three months pregnant."|"Romulus, My Father"|"Raimond Gaita"
"ap ~ 03:00"|"approximately three o’clock"|"I learned that Mitru was dead when my mother arrived at my school in a taxi at approximately three o’clock the next Monday afternoon. My father was with her. She was in the back seat, her head covered with a light scarf, her face drawn and marked with tears. She told me that Mitru had died and, when I asked how, she said that he had died of a cold. That evening she told me the truth, and that she had spent the previous two nights sleeping at the foot of the tower, fighting the impulse to follow him. She said that he was so determined to succeed this time that he placed a knife at the foot of the tower onto which he intended to fall. I do not know whether this horrible detail is true."|"Romulus, My Father"|"Raimond Gaita"

Never willingly an early riser, he went to Tom Lillie’s blacksmith shop at nine, and then worked late into the night, until ten or eleven, and on most weekends. He would occasionally watch an hour or so of television when the Lillies bought a set, but he was happiest in his workshop, spending little time at Frogmore. He played Romanian and Yugoslav records on a record player in the middle of the workshop, singing along with them. He was fond of crooners, particularly of Dean Martin for his easygoing style, but he admired Bing Crosby more for his capacity suddenly to hit a low note."|"Romulus, My Father"|"Raimond Gaita"

">> 00:00"|"well after midnight"|"I was not with my father and Hora when they visited the woman whose news would change the course of my father’s life. When I returned to Prahran after swimming at the city baths, my father was lying on Hora’s bed, moaning in heart-rending distress. Hora told me he had severe stomach trouble. This was half true. On the return journey with Hora he felt nauseated and weak from shock and his stomach began to cramp. But I knew that could only be some of the truth, for my father’s face was tortured in ways that I knew instinctively no mere physical ailment could explain. When we drove home to Frogmore that night my father told me nothing of the cause of his anguish. We arrived well after midnight. I went to bed. He wrote to Lydia."|"Romulus, My Father"|"Raimond Gaita"
12:00|midday|"The hospital represented a foreign world to me, one whose beliefs were shaped by ideas I instinctively felt to be in conflict with those that had enabled me to understand the events of my childhood. I could no longer see my father’s illness just from the perspective of our life at Frogmore. Strange though it may sound, my sense of that life, of the ideas that informed it, was given intensity and colour by the light and landscape of the area. The hills looked as old as the earth, because they were rounded by millennia and also because the grey and equally rounded granite boulders that stood among the long yellow grasses, sharply delineated at all times of day by the summer sun, made them look prehistoric. More than anything, however, the glorious, tall, burnt-yellow grasses (as a boy they came to my chest and sometimes over my head) moving irregularly against a deep blue sky, dominated the images of my childhood and gave colour to my freedom and also to my understanding of suffering. In the morning they inspired cheerful energy of the kind that made you whistle; at midday, in partnership with an unforgiving sun and alive with insects and other creatures, they intimidated; but in the late afternoon, towards dusk, everything was softened by a light that graced the area in a melancholy beauty that could pierce one’s soul, as it did mine on the day I went in search of rabbits, and many times thereafter."|"Romulus, My Father"|"Raimond Gaita"
"ap ~ 07:00"|"around seven o’clock"|"We shared the driving and arrived at Lydia’s house early in the morning, around seven o’clock. My father said that we should wait until a more suitable time before knocking at their door. This courtesy struck me as incongruous with our purpose, and I did not know whether to take it as a sign that my father had abandoned his plan, or that his natural courtesy showed through even when he was intent on murder."|"Romulus, My Father"|"Raimond Gaita"
"~ 03:00"|"Around three in the morning"|"M slept with me in a small room on the verandah. Around three in the morning I heard him get up to go to the lavatory and noticed that he was gone a long time. I thought he might be sick after so much to drink, but because I was only partly awake I fell asleep before he returned. The next morning I woke before him and went into the house to hear my father speaking on the telephone in an agitated voice. When I asked him what was the matter, he told me that he had phoned the hospital to see if a psychiatrist could come to the house; Lydia’s mother had gone mad. She was saying that M had come to her bed that night. She refused to get up until he left the house."|"Romulus, My Father"|"Raimond Gaita"
23:00|"11 p.m."|"She was constantly with him, usually working until evening, and then she often stayed with him in the workshop until 10 or 11 p.m., preferring to be there than home alone. He made an iron stove so that she would be warm in winter, especially in the evenings, and was proud of the fact that it warmed the entire large workshop within half an hour, glowing red hot. When the garden settings were finished he hired a semitrailer to take them to Melbourne where he painted them because he did not want any to arrive with chipped paintwork. He often stayed in a caravan park and sometimes with his uncle. Every evening he telephoned Milka who was impatient for his call and for his return."|"Romulus, My Father"|"Raimond Gaita"
"< 00:00"|"before midnight"|"On one occasion, when I came home for Christmas, we quarrelled within minutes of my arrival. I drove back to Melbourne at such speed that my car became airborne when I hit a level crossing. When I reached Melbourne I realised that I must either break with my father or return to Maryborough, it being a serious matter for me to refuse to come for Christmas. I ruled out the former, so I drove back, again at high speed in order to get there before midnight. When I arrived my father asked where I had been. I told him that I had been to Melbourne. Incredulous that I could have been to Melbourne and back in such a short time, he berated me for driving like a lunatic. If I had not bitten my tongue and said nothing we would have quarrelled and I would have driven back to Melbourne again."|"Romulus, My Father"|"Raimond Gaita"
"~ 22:00"|"Around ten at night"|"My father put the savage killings down to human cruelty. He had waited some nights hidden behind a log, hoping to catch the killers. Around ten at night, he took his rifle and asked me whether I was coming with him. I knew my father and so I knew that nothing I could say would deter him from going. He would either go alone or go with me. I was taken back to the time when we went to Sydney, he intent on shooting Lydia’s husband. As I did then, I knew that because he had asked me it was morally impossible for me to refuse."|"Romulus, My Father"|"Raimond Gaita"
"> 00:00"|"just after midnight"|"Milka phoned me that Wednesday night around ten. I was preparing to leave for Tasmania where I was to give some lectures, to be joined by Yael at the weekend. Because my father knew that we were in need of a holiday, he told Milka to say nothing to me in case I should cancel my trip. Fortunately she finally disregarded this instruction. I phoned the Ballarat hospital to be told that the doctors had not settled on a diagnosis. An hour later they conducted an exploratory operation and telephoned me just after midnight to inform me of the result. My father had a dead gut, caused by a clot in the artery supplying his stomach. They thought it unlikely that he would live for more than twenty-four hours."|"Romulus, My Father"|"Raimond Gaita"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"Yael and the girls went to a motel while I stayed at the hospital. At ten o’clock nurses came to turn my father onto his other side. As they began to do it, he moaned in obvious pain. I pleaded with them to leave him be. They said that hospital regulations required them to turn him to prevent bed sores. I told them that he wouldn’t live long enough for that, and pointed out the irony of the fact that the only time he showed pain was when they tried to ensure that he would not suffer it. Torn between the regulations and good sense, they allowed good sense to prevail."|"Romulus, My Father"|"Raimond Gaita"
"> 00:00"|"just past midnight"|"My father died just past midnight, as they had predicted twenty-four hours before. I kissed him and sat with him for another half-hour before calling the nurses.

01:00|"1 a.m."|"When he fled from home in 1935, my father made his way to a village about one hundred and fifty kilometres away and there sought out a blacksmith to ask if he would engage him as an apprentice. He was granted a trial period and proved himself more than satisfactory. It is difficult now to believe how hard he worked during his three-year apprenticeship. Work started for him at 1 a.m. and continued with breaks only for meals until approximately 4 p.m. when he had often to tend to his master’s animals. He had nothing we now call free time because almost anything he might do after his duties were completed would deny him much needed sleep."|"Romulus, My Father"|"Raimond Gaita"

"~ 21:00"|"about 9 p.m."|"My mother came occasionally. When she was there, my father took the opportunity to work overtime when he did not work night shift. He would come home at about 9 p.m. to find that she had not cooked dinner for me. Sometimes he found her just staring into the fire. By the time he had prepared a meal, I was asleep at the table. Only when he recalled this do I remember him speaking bitterly about my mother. She must have suffered depressions, but at the time she appeared to me cheerful and vivacious, even when she lay in bed during the day, as she often did. When not at school, I spent many hours lying in bed with her, reading or talking, despite the fact that she refused to deny herself the pleasure of cleaning my ears with her bobby pins. I was glad of her physical, feminine presence, which comforted me more than food."|"Romulus, My Father"|"Raimond Gaita"
"~ 03:00"|"about 3 a.m."|"She made light of her attempted suicide to me, but her vivacity was gone. Preoccupied and uncommunicative, she lay in bed most days except for an hour or two when she went for walks. One evening, when she did not return from her walk, my father and I searched the paddocks calling to her, but heard no answer. Again my father ran to Lillie’s from where he phoned the police in Maldon. He feared she had killed herself. Later that night I stood knee-deep in the waters of a nearby swamp lit by searchlights as the police, my father, Lillie and others searched for her body.They did not find her and at about 3 a.m. everyone went home."|"Romulus, My Father"|"Raimond Gaita"
"ap 01:30"|130|"In the winter of 1954 Mitru and my mother came separately to Frogmore, he from Ballarat and she from Melbourne. They had quarrelled and they quarrelled again at Frogmore, with each other and with my father. Mitru decided it would be best for him to leave, so my father took him on the motorbike to Castlemaine station where he could catch a train to Melbourne. Agitated, my father rode at 130 kmh with Mitru complaining all the while that he would prefer to drive than to fly. In Castlemaine, my father went to the market and filled two sugar sacks with groceries and fruit. He slung one over each shoulder and rode home, again at speed. Over and again he asked himself why had it all turned out so? When would he be free of these troubles?"|"Romulus, My Father"|"Raimond Gaita"
11:00|"eleven o’clock in the morning"|"By this time conditions at Frogmore had become ever more primitive, but my father and I did not mind. The house had deteriorated. Some of the joists under the floor in the hallway, the kitchen and the bedroom had given way and, in those areas, the floor had sunk below the bottom of the skirting boards. The summers were hot and the house became unbearable, driving us to sleep on a mattress under the verandah. The winters were sharp, with frosts lasting sometimes until ten or eleven o’clock in the morning. The water froze at the tap in the tank, so we filled basins the night before. In the morning, stripped to the waist, we broke the ice and washed ourselves."|"Romulus, My Father"|"Raimond Gaita"
06:00|"6 a.m."|"We cooked on a one-burner kerosene stove, lighting the wood-fired stove only when it was cold, and even then only occasionally. The cooking was as basic as the facility on which we did it. I cooked breakfast because I rose at 6 a.m. to listen to ‘Sunrise Trail’, a country and western program to which I often sent requests, and dinner because I could prepare it while my father worked. Our meals were not distinguished for their variety. For breakfast we invariably had two fresh eggs and coffee although I had to drink at least two cups of fresh milk before I was permitted coffee. For dinner we often ate a variation on potato soup: potato soup with meat, with baked beans, with green peas, with sweet corn, and so on. Domestic duties, washing dishes, sweeping the floor and so on, fell to me, as did the tasks of feeding the hens and collecting the eggs."|"Romulus, My Father"|"Raimond Gaita"
