"ap > 08:00"|"past eight o’clock"|"For the inspector? It was well past eight o’clock. She ought to have been home. Frowning, Rhys rapped on the ceiling of the coach. Jumping out into traffic was only slightly less harrowing than sprinting through a zombie forest, but Rhys made it to the cart in one piece."|"The Iron Duke"|"Meljean Brook"
00:00|midnight|"“We leave at dawn, so make your decision quickly,” he said, and strode for the door. “I’ll wait until midnight for your wiregram.”"|"The Iron Duke"|"Meljean Brook"
"<< 00:00"|"well before midnight"|"Though the messenger must have delivered her note well before midnight, when Mina rose from her bed near dawn, Trahaearn still had not come. She waited in her room, expecting an imperious knock at the front door, expecting an airship to hover above her house at any moment. She heard nothing."|"The Iron Duke"|"Meljean Brook"
12:00|noon|"He greeted Mina before nodding to Yasmeen. “Three weeks, captain. I’ll be atop that ruin at noon.”"|"The Iron Duke"|"Meljean Brook"
00:00|midnight|"Cutting Lady Corsair’s engines the previous night had delayed them. It was nearing midnight before Mina climbed above decks in anticipation of her first glimpse of the Market, prudently leaving her short uniform coat behind in favor of a less conspicuous black waistcoat that buckled tightly over her shirtsleeves and armor. Trahaearn had already joined Yasmeen at the quarterdeck, and she knew they were discussing whether to wait until morning before attempting to find Colbert. That decision was made for them, however, when the notorious settlement finally came into view as an unmistakable orange glow against the dark sky."|"The Iron Duke"|"Meljean Brook"
">> 12:00"|"long after noon"|"Not long after noon, he saw her stiffen with the telescope to her eye, no longer sweeping the horizon. Without a word, he took it from her. Hot triumph shot through him. There she was. Marco’s Terror. Just the masts were visible, but he knew their shape. He could have stood blindfolded on a pier, and recognized her sound when she sailed past him."|"The Iron Duke"|"Meljean Brook"
">> 00:00"|"well after midnight"|"After the first day and night on the Terror, Mina didn’t wonder that he’d thought a month wouldn’t be enough. On the airship, they’d been able to spend a full day in bed. Here, stealing more than a few minutes during the day was all but impossible. Though the crew changed shifts several times, Rhys stood over them from before dawn until well after midnight. He broke to eat dinner with Mina and Scarsdale, but even then he worked, describing the upcoming stretches of water to the navigator, relaying what the crew needed to accomplish during their shifts, and poring over maps and ledgers."|"The Iron Duke"|"Meljean Brook"
">> 00:00"|"long after midnight"|"And long after midnight, she did, pushing him onto his back and climbing over him—but there was no rest. With her lips, she explored, and wrecked him with the heat of her mouth and the stroke of her tongue. She kissed him into desperate need, until they were both rigid and panting. And when her fingers smoothed the sheath over his cock, when her thighs parted over him, when she took him deep into her wet passage, the tightness and the friction held him in a mad grip. Insensate with pleasure, but not resting, no—she moved upon him, and he met her with heavy upward thrusts, seeking oblivion within her hot depths. But there was only exquisite awareness, of her every sigh and gasp as she rode him. Of the warmth and softness of her hands and mouth. Of Mina taking him all, kissing, biting, and losing control as he finally came deep inside her. Stiffening, she breathed his name on a shudder, then again on a hoarse cry."|"The Iron Duke"|"Meljean Brook"
00:00|midnight|"Sitting by Andrew, she threw her arms around him before running to Rhys and letting him sweep her up into a sweet, victorious kiss. The giddy relief lasted through endless questions as Bellerophon ’s rear admiral and the van squadron’s vice admiral boarded the ship. Vitruvian was lost, and although much of her crew had been rescued, Mina wasn’t surprised to learn that Burnett had gone down with the ship. But even with a king’s decree in hand, an admiral’s death couldn’t be pardoned without rigorous examination. When the admirals opted to continue their questioning on Bellerophon, Rhys left with them on Seymour’s airship. Mina spent the rest of the afternoon writing out a long report to Hale. At sunset, Yasmeen and Scarsdale joined her for dinner at the captain’s table—and as they’d made an early start on their celebratory drinking, Mina was well entertained until midnight approached, and Rhys finally returned."|"The Iron Duke"|"Meljean Brook"
12:00|Noon|"Mina was still in a warm, spicy haze when they stopped in Venice three days later, hovering over the tall ruins. Noon arrived."|"The Iron Duke"|"Meljean Brook"
