"> 11:00"|"A little after eleven A.M."|"A little after eleven A.M. on July 31, 2013, the sun was beating down on the low, modest residential buildings lining a back street in the Indian farming village of Raipur Khadar, southeast of New Delhi. Faint smells of cooking spices, dust, and sewage seasoned the air."|"The World in a Grain"|"Vince Beiser"
05:12|"5:12 in the morning"|"At 5:12 in the morning of April 18, 1906, a titanic earthquake sledgehammered the city of San Francisco. For almost a full minute, streets convulsed and buildings shivered and collapsed. People were killed by the dozens. “Of a sudden we had found ourselves staggering and reeling. . . . Then came the sickening swaying of the earth that threw us flat upon our faces,” recalled one eyewitness. “Then it seemed as though my head were split with the roar that crashed into my ears. Big buildings were crumbling as one might crush a biscuit in one’s hand. Ahead of me a great cornice crushed a man as if he were a maggot—a laborer in overalls on his way to the Union Iron Works with a dinner pail on his arm.”"|"The World in a Grain"|"Vince Beiser"
11:15|"11:15 A.M."|"The eighty-one-vehicle “motor truck train”—including trucks, motorcycles, ambulances, and field kitchens, accompanied by carloads of reporters and auto company officials—set off from Washington, DC, at 11:15 A.M. on July 7, 1919. Less than four hours later, a coupling broke on a kitchen trailer. That was only the first of many mechanical troubles that bedeviled the convoy. It advanced a grand total of forty-six miles that first day."|"The World in a Grain"|"Vince Beiser"
"ap 06:05"|6.05|"Much of that has been to the good. Paved roads have enabled goods to reach distant markets, knitted regions together, and made it far easier to visit loved ones and distant places. They have also saved countless lives. One benefit modern freeways don’t get enough credit for is the dramatic extent by which they have reduced the number of road deaths. Thanks to their well-engineered banks, wide lanes, gentle curves, separation from automobiles coming the other way, and careful control of merging ones, interstates are far safer than the roads they replaced. In fact, according to the Federal Highway Administration, the interstate is the safest road system in the country, with a fatality rate of 0.8 deaths per 100 million vehicle miles traveled, a rate almost half the national average. Compare that to the rate in 1956, when the interstates were launched, which was 6.05."|"The World in a Grain"|"Vince Beiser"
05:00|"five A.M."|"Truth to tell, it wasn’t much of an improvement, safety-wise. Glass is mainly made of melted quartz sand. Melting those durable grains requires tremendous heat, which in Owens’s day was provided by coal. Owens’s first job at the factory, at age ten, was as a blower’s dog, stoking coal into the glory hole of a furnace. Every day, black dust and ash covered his body and filled his lungs. Wearing knee pants held up with suspenders, he worked six days a week, ten hours a day, starting at five A.M. The temperature inside the factory sometimes topped 100 degrees. He was paid thirty cents a day. “The constant facing of the glare of the furnaces, and the red-hot bottle causes injury to the sight,” reported a visitor to a glass factory of the time, noted Quentin Skrabec Jr. in his book Michael Owens and the Glass Industry. “Minor accidents from burning are numerous.” The glass factories employed boys as young as seven. Adult glassblowers screamed at and beat them. A magazine journalist at the time called it “a boy-destroying trade.”"|"The World in a Grain"|"Vince Beiser"
"> 19:52"|"after 1952"|"Glass came into even wider use after 1952 when Alastair Pilkington, a British engineer and businessman, developed a technique of pouring molten glass onto a shallow pool of molten tin, resulting in sheets that could be larger and more uniform in size than ever, ideal for big windows in large-scale construction projects. Float plants using this method soon became the industry standard."|"The World in a Grain"|"Vince Beiser"
08:30|"8:30 A.M."|"It’s a grimy, dusty, noisy corner of the city. The summer heat was just kicking in at 8:30 A.M., and traffic streamed steadily on and off the ramps connecting the freeway with Melrose, a busy four-lane thoroughfare. Underneath the overpass, a bluntly functional span held up by two heavy concrete columns, were vestiges of homeless encampments: an abandoned shopping cart, scattered clothes, a mattress, ashes from a fire. Homeless folk add another risk to concrete overpasses, Mah said. They sometimes steal the steel nuts on the structure to sell as scrap metal, or accidentally set fire to wood reinforcements with their cooking fires. Caltrans inspectors always go out in pairs, Mah explained, especially to spots where homeless folk stay. “A lot of them are very rude,” he says. Sometimes he has to call in California Highway Patrol officers to get them to move so he can do his job."|"The World in a Grain"|"Vince Beiser"
