Zdravko, who has a ruddy, outdoor complexion, wears an old forage-cap and carries a small stainless-steel spade slung across his shoulder like a rifle. Damir laughs when I worry about his octogenarian uncle.

But the two most important members of the expedition are Betty and Dick (a bit of a shock here as they’re the names of my aunt and uncle), a four-year-old Labrador and a seven-year-old Retriever respectively."|"New Europe"|"Michael Palin"

Towns are small, run-down and dominated by shoddy apartment blocks. I have the feeling, admittedly on very short acquaintance, that Macedonia may have suffered most from the break-up of the Yugoslav Federation. Within Yugoslavia it had the strength and support to survive. Without, it is fragile and vulnerable. Average earnings, I’m told, are around 250 euros a month. Their security depends on old Russian fighters and Bulgarian tanks and Mafia influence is widespread. Even their national flag, an eye-catching gold-on-red rising sun, which we see for the last time fluttering above the border post beyond Delevo, had to be changed after complaints from the Greeks that it incorporated the star of Vergina, the symbol of the ancient Macedonian kingdom to which the Greeks lay sole claim."|"New Europe"|"Michael Palin"

No-one seemed to bat an eyelid as we chugged through Republic Square, past the National Theatre, the National Museum and a statue of Prince Michael Obrenovic III, who is seen as the great liberator of Serbia from the Turks in the nineteenth century. We rattled along, at a steady 25 miles an hour, by the impressive walls of the Kalemegdan Castle, started by the Romans and added to over the years by Turks, French and Hungarians, which guards the junction of the Sava and the Danube. Until 1918 the tree-fringed banks of the land called Vojvodina, on the far side of the Danube, were part of the Austro-Hungarian empire. In the great dismemberment of that empire that followed the Treaty of Trianon in 1920, Transylvania was given to Romania, and Vojvodina to the newly emerging Yugoslavia."|"New Europe"|"Michael Palin"

I put my watch on an hour to Ukrainian time and wait, as you often do on international trains, in limbo-land. Eventually we edge creakily forward towards the border. Less than ninety years ago we wouldn’t be leaving Hungary at all, just carrying on into that part of their empire called Galicia."|"New Europe"|"Michael Palin"

The flat Hungarian plain has been replaced by the steep, tree-fringed fields and hills of the northern Carpathians, the sunshine and clear skies of the last two weeks by streaming rain and low cloud. Our Ukrainian stewardess, back in her own country, and in sole and effortless control of the coach, is already up and about, bringing us glasses of tea in stainless-steel holders as we gather and gaze out at the gloom.

The doors swing open and a delegation of the great and powerful emerges. At the same time the cheerleaders strut out from behind the monument and, having flung their batons about a bit, fall back to allow the hosts of the ceremony to make their appearance. And what an appearance it is too. A man dressed from head to foot in white and a woman in a long taffeta ball-gown.

The Wolsztyn train consists of only two coaches, one clean, the other very dirty indeed, but they are drawn by a monster of a locomotive. For those who like these details, it’s a 2-6-4, which means it has twelve wheels. It’s a menacing sooty-black colour with windshields on either side of the boiler and a freshly filled tender.

I discover a potently pungent combination of vodka and oscypek, the smoked goat’s cheese made in heaven, which I first tasted at the Podhale restaurant in Warsaw. The band, two violinists and a three-string cello, then takes over and fast and fierce and slow and decorous numbers tumble over each other in quick succession, and often at the same time.

The architecture is as striking as I remember it, the city as beautiful, but now it is open, welcoming and anxious to please, and you can talk about anything, anywhere. The ‘Golden Mile’, running from St Vitus’ Cathedral and the castle through Mala Strana (the Little Quarter), across Charles Bridge to the Old Town Square, must be one of the most over-appreciated stretches of any capital in Europe. In the high tourist time of day - from nine till five - a thick, slow-moving crowd clogs this lucrative artery, making it impossible to get a sense of anything except other people. Prague is endlessly hospitable and seems as much at ease with the night-time adventurer as the daytime masses. Quite late at night I saw vehicles, looking like converted jeeps, offering rides to the nearest brothel. I also saw a group of medics from Portsmouth, bowling down through Wenceslas Square, all dressed identically in green surgical overalls. They were pissed as newts and yet the Czech people I was with seemed to take it quite philosophically. And they were policemen."|"New Europe"|"Michael Palin"

She’s an independent traveller, in her thirties, and although she’s from the depths of West Germany her opinion on how things are going seems very similar to those of East German Felix.
