Reconstructing the crime, they had sat in the end bay of the library, as Robert Fentiman might have sat, casting his eyes around him while he considered how he could best hide and cover up this extremely inopportune decease. They had noticed how the gilt lettering on the back of a volume caught the gleam from the shaded reading-lamp. Oliver Twist.

The important thing is that it was a raw, cold evening. She insisted on undertaking her little expedition nevertheless, enjoyed the entertainment as heartily as the youngest child, imprudently exposed herself to the night air and caught a severe cold which, in two days’ time, turned to pneumonia. On November 10th she was sinking fast, and scarcely expected to live out the night. Accordingly, the young lady who lived with her as her ward—a distant relative, Miss Ann Dorland—sent a message to General Fentiman that if he wished to see his sister alive he should come immediately. For the sake of our common human nature, I am happy to say that this news broke down the barrier of pride and obstinacy that had kept the old gentleman away so long. He came, found Lady Dormer just conscious, though very feeble, stayed with her about half an hour and departed, still stiff as a ramrod, but visibly softened.

He had his breakfast in bed at a quarter to eight—tea and buttered toast, with a hegg lightly boiled, as he did every day in the year.

About three o’clock in the afternoon there was a ring on the telephone. We had the telephone put in, my lord, on account of the General’s heart, so that we could always call up a medical man in case of emergency.”"|"The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club"|"Dorothy L.

However, at half-past eight I began to be afraid of the night air for him; it was very cold that day, my lord, if you remember.

“At nine exactly?”
“About nine. It might have been a little later, but not more than a quarter-past at latest. It was a gentleman spoke to me. He said: ‘Is that General Fentiman’s flat?’ I said ‘Yes; who is it, please?’ And he said, ‘Is that Woodward?’ giving my name, just like that, and I said ‘Yes.’ And he said, ‘Oh, Woodward, General Fentiman wishes me to tell you not to wait up for him, as he is spending the night with me.’ So I said, ‘Excuse me, sir, who is it speaking, please?’ And he said, ‘Mr. Oliver.’ So I asked him to repeat the name, not having heard it before, and he said, ‘Oliver’—it came over very plain—‘Mr. Oliver,’ he said; ‘I’m an old friend of General Fentiman’s, and he is staying to-night with me, as we have some business to talk over.’ So I said, ‘Does the General require anything, sir?’ thinking, you know, my lord, as he might wish to have his sleeping-suit and his toothbrush or somethink of that, but the gentleman said no, he had got everything necessary and I was not to trouble myself. Well, of course, my lord, as I explained to Major Fentiman, I didn’t like to take upon myself to ask questions, being only in service, my lord; it might seem taking a liberty. But I was very much afraid of the excitement and staying up late being too much for the General, so I went so far as to say I hoped General Fentiman was in good health and not tiring of himself, and Mr. Oliver laughed and said he would take very good care of him and send him to bed straight away. And I was just about to make so bold as to ask him where he lived, when he rang off. And that was all I knew till I heard next day of the General being dead, my lord.”"|"The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club"|"Dorothy L. Sayers"
