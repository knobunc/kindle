The new manager of the little grocer’s, who had been there no more than ten days, rolled down the blind over the door at eight o’clock one evening, bolted the door, and turned to propose marriage to Joan. So Bush interpreted it by her modest looks, her smiles, her moment of fear, his way of clasping her hand formally and tenderly. Next day, the fellow cycled to work as usual and presented Joan with a ring from his neat waistcoat pocket; as he slipped it on her finger, she smiled with misty eyes and suddenly put an arm about his neck, resting a cheek against his head."|Cryptozoic!|"Brian W.

Daylight came, the alarm shrilled, stirring some peptic chains to motion under the sleeping clouds.

We know the future, that the human race is dwindling towards its union with animal kind, that the end of the Earth is so near, geologically speaking, that everything is tending towards the less and the mindless. So marvelously is everything planned, that humanity follows that same pattern, in the general and in the individual. Every human being – and of course this applies to the animals as well – grows younger and smaller, with most of his faculties reaching maturity just before he loses the abilities of puberty. He then grows through boyhood, probably attending school to forget the knowledge he will no longer need. The decline into helplessness is comparatively swift and merciful; it is possible that at the age called twelve – twelve years to the womb, that is – the human is probably as mentally alert as he will ever be: and he needs all his alertness, for there is the complicated business of unlearning the language to go through. For most, this is a happy period to which they gladly surrender at the end of their life. They can lie back in their mothers’ arms and babble without care. They hardly know it when the time comes for them to return to the womb, that grave of the human race."|Cryptozoic!|"Brian W. Aldiss"
