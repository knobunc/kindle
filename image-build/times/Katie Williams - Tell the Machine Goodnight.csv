12:00|midday|"CARTER RETURNED HOME TO FIND ANGIE deep in one of her midday naps, not-so-gently snoring. The baby, however, was wide awake, on her back in the side-along, staring up at him. Carter lifted her gently, then, on impulse, extended his arms, holding her above his head. Her eyes gleamed, dark and depthless, whole galaxies stretching out behind them. She pounded her fists in the air as she always did when she was airborne. Carter lowered her, pressing her fat belly to his face, then he lowered both of them until he was curled over her in the middle of his bedroom carpet."|"Tell the Machine Goodnight"|"Katie Williams"
12:00|midday|"He wandered to the gallery and hovered by Nita’s desk like a ghoul. Midas was over, after garnering a handful of listings, a few middling reviews on lightly trafficked blogs. One blogger thought it was an indictment of capitalism. Another a rejection of the physical body. The only review Elliot had liked was the one where most of the screen was given over to a hand-drawn illustration of a vicuna. So it seemed Midas would not be lucrative after all. Irony. It was midday on a Tuesday. The gallery was near empty. Nita gave him a sharp look and did not rise from her seat at the desk to greet him."|"Tell the Machine Goodnight"|"Katie Williams"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"Pearl hadn’t seen either of them, or anyone else, since her arrival the previous afternoon. After her call to Rhett, she’d stayed in her guest suite for a couple of hours, unsure if she was welcome to move around the house. When dinnertime came, she’d wandered downstairs and found the first floor empty, though all the lights had been left on. On the kitchen counter she’d discovered a covered tray marked with her name, underneath its lid a salad of strange leaves, cheeses, and fruits, as delicious as anything she’d ever eaten. Also, bread and wine. When she’d finished, Pearl had washed her dinner plate in the sink and taken the remainder of the bottle up to her room, where she’d continued her Calla Pax marathon. During the opening credits of Death Drop, Pearl’s screen had lit with a request from Marilee for a meeting the next morning at eleven, and then, during Skin Scythe’s infamous peeling scene, a second alert from Calla saying that they needed to move the meeting up to ten. When Pearl had come downstairs this morning at half past nine, she’d found Calla already waiting in the front sitting room, a coffee service and basket of muffins set out on the table before her."|"Tell the Machine Goodnight"|"Katie Williams"

12:00|noon|"Each noon, a town car came to pick up Calla and Marilee and take them to, Pearl assumed, the movie set. This left Pearl free for the rest of the day, free but restricted to the house and the garden. The first couple of days, she tried to scare up more work, but after spending two hours needlessly reformatting an Apricity intake form, she admitted that her time would be better spent in the garden rereading Jane Eyre. She wished she’d brought the model she was working on, a western bristlebird (Dasyornis longirostris), mud colored but for iridescent shimmers on the tips of its wings and tail."|"Tell the Machine Goodnight"|"Katie Williams"

Pearl spent the evenings in her guest suite working her way through the Calla Pax oeuvre. Sometime after midnight, Pearl would hear Calla return, Marilee’s voice on the stairs, shepherding the girl to bed. Sometime after that, Pearl would fall into a deep cottony sleep."|"Tell the Machine Goodnight"|"Katie Williams"

“Seven-oh-three post meridiem,” the HMS reports.
I give Mom a look, but she doesn’t see it because she’s focused on her taco. She’s practically arranging every individual shred of lettuce and cheese like she’s making one of her models.

I get up from the vinyl chair where I’ve been sitting for a while now. I walk to the head of the trail and look down the mountainside.

Pearl read it over again, silently apologizing to the machine for referring to it as property. Other than that, she was pleased with the firmness of her message.
