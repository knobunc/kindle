"ap ~ 04:30"|"about four-thirty"|"I was looking at him across my office desk at about four-thirty when the phone rang and I heard a cool, supercilious voice that sounded as if it thought it was pretty good. It said drawlingly, after I had answered:"|"Farewell, My Lovely"|"Raymond Chandler"
19:00|"seven o’clock this evening"|"“Oh—you mean, yes. You have been recommended to me as a man who can be trusted to keep his mouth shut. I should like you to come to my house at seven o’clock this evening. We can discuss a matter. My name is Lindsay Marriott and I live at 4212 Cabrillo Street, Montemar Vista. Do you know where that is?”"|"Farewell, My Lovely"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"“Yes. Well, Cabrillo Street is rather hard to find. The streets down here are all laid out in a pattern of interesting but intricate curves. I should suggest that you walk up the steps from the sidewalk cafe. If you do that, Cabrillo is the third street you come to and my house is the only one on the block. At seven then?”"|"Farewell, My Lovely"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 07:00"|"Seven o’clock"|"He cleared his throat lightly and looked past my shoulder at the darkening sea. His cool supercilious voice said: “Yes?”
“Seven o’clock,” I said. “On the dot.”
“Oh yes. Let me see, your name is—” He paused and frowned in the effort of memory. The effect was as phony as the pedigree of a used car. I let him work at it for a minute, then I said:"|"Farewell, My Lovely"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 10:08"|"eight minutes past ten"|"The phone rang four times within the next hour and a half. The big one came at eight minutes past ten. Marriott talked briefly, in a very low voice, cradled the instrument without a sound and stood up with a sort of hushed movement. His face looked drawn. He had changed to dark clothes now. He walked silently back into the room and poured himself a stiff drink in a brandy glass. He held it against the light a moment with a queer unhappy smile, swirled it once quickly and tilted his head back to pour it down his throat."|"Farewell, My Lovely"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 10:56"|10.56|"I put my right hand back on the ground and took the left off and swivelled it around until I could see my watch. The illuminated dial showed 10.56, as nearly as I could focus on it."|"Farewell, My Lovely"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 10:08"|10.08|"The call had come at 10.08. Marriott had talked maybe two minutes. Another four had got us out of the house. Time passes very slowly when you are actually doing something. I mean, you can go through a lot of movements in very few minutes. Is that what I mean? What the hell do I care what I mean? Okey, better men than me have meant less. Okey, what I mean is, that would be 10.15, say. The place was about twelve minutes away. 10.27. I get out, walk down in the hollow, spend at the most eight minutes fooling around and come on back up to get my head treated. 10.35. Give me a minute to fall down and hit the ground with my face. The reason I hit it with my face, I got my chin scraped. It hurts. It feels scraped. That way I know it’s scraped. No, I can’t see it. I don’t have to see it. It’smy chin and I know whether it’s scraped or not. Maybe you want to make something of it. Okey, shut up and let me think. What with? . . ."|"Farewell, My Lovely"|"Raymond Chandler"

22:56|"10.56 p.m."|"The watch showed 10.56 p.m. That meant I had been out for twenty minutes."|"Farewell, My Lovely"|"Raymond Chandler"
"< 00:00"|"towards midnight"|"I looked at the dial of my watch. The faintly glowing hands said that it was getting towards midnight."|"Farewell, My Lovely"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"“Sorry. It’s only eleven o’clock or less. I didn’t think you looked the type.”"|"Farewell, My Lovely"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"I looked at it again. Then I slid it under the blotter. “How about tonight at eleven?”"|"Farewell, My Lovely"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"“So I said to Mrs. Grayle: ‘You’d still like it back, wouldn’t you?’ Just like that. I didn’t know any other way to say it. I had to say something that would jar her a bit. It did. She gave me another number in a hurry. And I called that and I said I’d like to see her. She seemed surprised. So I had to tell her the story. She didn’t like it. But she had been wondering why she hadn’t heard from Marriott. I guess she thought he had gone south with the money or something. So I’m to see her at two o’clock. Then I’ll tell her about you and how nice and discreet you are and how you would be a good man to help her get it back, if there’s any chance and so on. She’s already interested.”"|"Farewell, My Lovely"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"I hung up and lunged for the office bottle. I felt as if I had been through a meat grinder. Ten minutes passed. The phone rang. The voice said:
“Amthor he weel see you at six o’clock.”
“That’s fine. What’s the address?”"|"Farewell, My Lovely"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 10:00"|"Ten o’clock"|"“I guess you’re right,” she said. “Just too much Scotch. Tonight at the Belvedere Club. Ten o’clock.” She wasn’t looking at me. Her breath was fast."|"Farewell, My Lovely"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 10:00"|"Ten o’clock"|"“Nothing. Ten o’clock at the Belvedere Club. Don’t be too magnificent. All I have is a dinner suit. In the bar?”"|"Farewell, My Lovely"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap < 05:00"|"almost five"|"I got into my own car and looked at my watch before starting up. It was almost five."|"Farewell, My Lovely"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 10:00"|"Ten o’clock"|"“There’s a nice little girl,” I told myself out loud, in the car, “for a guy that’s interested in a nice little girl.” Nobody said anything. “But I’m not,” I said. Nobody said anything to that either. “Ten o’clock at the Belvedere Club,” I said. Somebody said: “Phooey.”"|"Farewell, My Lovely"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 05:45"|"quarter to six"|"It was a quarter to six when I reached my office again. The building was very quiet. The typewriter beyond the party wall was stilled. I lit a pipe and sat down to wait."|"Farewell, My Lovely"|"Raymond Chandler"
"< 00:00"|"almost midnight"|"He looked mildly surprised. I had my wrist watch on now, but it had run down.
“It is almost midnight. Why?”
“What day is it?”"|"Farewell, My Lovely"|"Raymond Chandler"
"~ 04:00"|"about four in the morning"|"The revolving searchlight was a pale mist-ridden finger that barely skimmed the waves a hundred feet or so beyond the ship. It was probably more for show than anything else. Especially at this time in the evening. Anyone who had plans for hijacking the take on one of these gambling boats would need plenty of help and would pull the job about four in the morning, when the crowd was thinned down to a few bitter gamblers, and the crew were all dull with fatigue. Even then it would be a poor way to make money. It had been tried once."|"Farewell, My Lovely"|"Raymond Chandler"
00:00|midnight|"He was neither young nor old, neither fat nor thin. Spending a lot of time on or near the ocean had given him a good healthy complexion. His hair was nut-brown and waved naturally and waved still more at sea. His forehead was narrow and brainy and his eyes held a delicate menace. They were yellowish in color. He had nice hands, not babied to the point of insipidity, but well-kept. His dinner clothes were midnight blue, I judged, because they looked so black. I thought his pearl was a little too large, but that might have been jealousy."|"Farewell, My Lovely"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 05:30"|five-thirty|"“I can prove it by the taximan,” Mess-jacket snarled.
“You’ve been off the stage since five-thirty?”
“Not a minute, boss.”"|"Farewell, My Lovely"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap ~ 10:00"|"about ten o’clock"|"It was about ten o’clock when I called the Grayle number in Bay City. I thought it would probably be too late to catch her, but it wasn’t. I fought my way through a maid and the butler and finally heard her voice on the line. She sounded breezy and well-primed for the evening."|"Farewell, My Lovely"|"Raymond Chandler"
