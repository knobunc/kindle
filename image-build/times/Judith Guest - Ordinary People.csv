"ap < 08:30"|"Almost eight-thirty"|"He sits on the front porch steps, waiting for Lazenby. The air is crisp and cool, and he rubs his hands together, shivering in the thin denim jacket. He should go back inside; get a heavier one, but he doesn’t want to risk it. Not that she will care, or say anything. But the hurdle has been jumped once today. Enough. He glances again at his watch. Almost eight-thirty. Lazenby has forgotten. He hopes for a moment that he has; then, prays he hasn’t. She would have to drive him. She has a golf game; it will make her late. The wrong direction, across town the two of them alone in the car and he not wanting to screw up and say the wrong thing. Haul ass Lazenby crissake don’t make me stand here until she comes out."|"Ordinary People"|"Judith Guest"

"ap 03:30"|three-thirty|"He sits at his desk, working on the papers Ray has left there for him. At three-thirty he has a meeting with Sandlin. They will discuss a new angle on their annuities. A germ, Ray calls it. His ideas are always referred to as “germs”; his figure estimates are “in the ball park.” Cliches. They jump out at you from everywhere, but you never see your own. Howard called again today, to talk about the Mercedes dealership opening up  in Evanston. “Things are looking up, Cal. Light at the end of the tunnel. People buying expensive foreign cars again. Hell of a good sign, wouldn’t you say?”"|"Ordinary People"|"Judith Guest"
"ap 01:19"|"one nineteen"|"He wants to ask, What the hell do you know about it, you with your two girls, one nineteen, away at college and everything roses, and how old is the other one? Seven? What is that, second grade? What do you know? But he doesn’t. And he can’t stay angry at Ray, who has been his friend since law school, nor at Howard, either; the concerned grandfather, the concerned father-in-law. All who are concerned only want to help."|"Ordinary People"|"Judith Guest"
"ap 04:00"|"Four o’clock"|"Glancing at his watch again, he finds his eyes have adjusted to the dim light. Four o’clock. Exactly. Well then get on it no backing out now an idea he has toyed with all week not going just not showing up won’t work. He is to meet his father at his office at five-fifteen. “Don’t be late. I’ve got a meeting tonight. I’d like to get out of there as close to five as I can.” Translated: “Don’t  let the guy upset you, show up when you’re supposed to, it only takes ten minutes to walk from Sherman and Tenth to the Plaza, I have clocked it.” No. Not fair. Not necessary to take everything so personally. He probably does have a meeting tonight. Everything’s all right, everything’s fine, keep it that way. On an even keel, as his grandfather would say."|"Ordinary People"|"Judith Guest"

"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"He laughs, delighted. “That oughta be easy. This my office, or yours? No. No good. Lotsa guys in this business make house calls now. Let’s see your appointment book.” He steps over to his desk, rummaging fiercely for a minute; he comes up with a gray stenographer’s  notebook. “Here. Tuesday, four o’clock. Conrad Jarrett. Ah. I knew it.” He grins, then."|"Ordinary People"|"Judith Guest"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"Cherry swings into the room with her smile, to put the papers on his desk. Seductively, that is how she does it. She works hard at it. Too hard. She has a good telephone voice. That’s about it. Can’t take dictation worth a damn, and she won’t file. He wonders where she  found this one; she must have had to do some hunting for it. Her boy friend goes to Northwestern, gets out of class at five o’clock each day, she has informed them. She is firm about leaving the office at exactly that time. Her habit of sneaking error-spotted letters on the desk for his signature, as she gives him the look of wide-eyed innocence, drives him crazy.

Yesterday I heard a guy on the radio talking about how to take care of your trees.

"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"A wooden clock on the wall behind his head ticks away loudly, and it is relaxing to lie here with this placid man beside him, talking of anger and of change, without being irrevocably committed to it. He could go to sleep here; right now he is yawning, pleasantly tired, but it is five o’clock, time to go home."|"Ordinary People"|"Judith Guest"
"ap ~ 08:20"|"About eight-twenty"|"He ignores that, not answering. The ride seems long. Even though he is the first to be dropped off.

“I’ve got to go early tomorrow,” he says. “I’ll get a ride with my dad.”"|"Ordinary People"|"Judith Guest"
12:00|noontime|"He runs into Carole Lazenby downstairs in the Plaza. Hatless, wearing a tweed pantsuit, her large-boned, square figure looks farmlike, out of place here, among the coeds and snazzy secretaries parading the streets of Evanston at noontime. And because she looks so real and so alive, he is absurdly glad to see her; asks her to go to lunch with him on the spot."|"Ordinary People"|"Judith Guest"

The old building is comfortable and secluded and dark, with its narrow stained-glass windows and soft leather chairs. He can stay there until five-thirty and make it home on time. Or else he walks, keeping an eye on his watch, checking the time. Down Deerpath, past the Presbyterian church to the north campus of Lake Forest, where he can sit on a park bench and watch the birds. Nut-hatches, creepers, chickadees, grosbeaks (he bought himself a bird book, and is learning to identify them) go sedately and earnestly about their business, which is eating. He carries envelopes of sunflower seeds in his jacket pockets. He has his own Life List."|"Ordinary People"|"Judith Guest"

"ap 08:30"|Eight-thirty|"Standing on the front porch of her house, he nervously shoves his hands in his pockets; pulls them out again. Too casual. Wouldn’t want her mother to get the wrong impression. He takes a quick glance at his watch. Eight-thirty. He is right on time. Her mother is strict, she says. Maybe she has a rule about her not being out after midnight. He hopes so. A series of five-minute telephone calls over a two-week period does not establish much precedent for the evening that now stretches lengthily ahead. Too long between the asking and the actual event. Like having to think in advance about going to the dentist. But she had been busy that first Saturday, and Friday nights she works. What is the problem? No problem. He is in great shape for this event. He has just been cut down to once a week by his analyst. He finds on waking each morning no terrible urgency to escape his thoughts. They are harmless. They concern a report he has to write, a section of tenor melody he is learning, small goals to purify his days."|"Ordinary People"|"Judith Guest"

23:30|"eleven-thirty at night"|"The distance between people. In miles. In time. In thought. Staggering, when you think about it. Here he is, driving on the Edens, and he catches a glimpse, in the lane to his left, of a passing car. The driver is raising an angry finger at him, behind the double space of window glass separating them. And he is amazed. What has he done to deserve this gesture of contempt? Of course. Glancing at his speedometer, he understands. Thirty miles an hour. You don’t do this on the Edens, drive thirty in a fifty-mile zone, even at eleven-thirty at night: it can get you more than an obscenity, it can get you into an accident. No thanks. No more. The quota is all used up."|"Ordinary People"|"Judith Guest"

Shouldn’t plan ahead like this shouldn’t expect minutes hours and the elevator comes down you could hit the ground but what  a trip. Last night, he took her out, again: the old Saturday-Night-Show Date. Afterward, at Lombardi’s they had run into Phil Truan and Shirley Day. Phil had talked about the four of them going bowling sometime and Jen had said, “Oh, I’m a terrible bowler, ask Con.” And Phil had said, “Hey, so am I, ask Con,” and suddenly he was the authority figure, although he does not remember Truan being a bad bowler; he was probably just being nice, making him feel important."|"Ordinary People"|"Judith Guest"
