21:00|"9 p.m."|"Then, when evening fell, 80,000 spectators took their seats and the lights were turned back on, causing the sleeping moths to stir. The players’ warm-up was already interrupted by clouds of the moths fluttering low across the pitch and by the time of kick-off at 9 p.m., thousands of the insects were zigzagging among the players. Photographs taken that night show annoyed UEFA officials picking moths off each other’s dark blue suits, moths blocking the lenses of TV cameras or bunches of them hanging from the goal posts, workers desperately wielding vacuum cleaners to keep the lines on the soccer pitch clear, and, the highlight, Cristiano Ronaldo weeping on the grass after a knee injury in the 24th minute, while a lone Autographa gamma sips his teardrops away."|"Darwin Comes to Town"|"Menno Schilthuizen"
13:30|"1:30 p.m."|"At 1:30 p.m., he emerges. Khaki shirt and shorts, with long graying hair and, somewhat uncharacteristically (for an acoustic ecologist), a pair of binoculars around his neck. He hoists his bag, adorned with a Pacific Northwest native pattern, onto his shoulder, stands himself in front of the expectant group of thirty or so students, and outlines the afternoon’s activity. We humans are very visually oriented animals, he explains. We view our surroundings first and foremost with our eyes. But for a biologist, it is also very important to be aware of the acoustic landscape, as many animals communicate by sound. As an exercise to stimulate that auditory awareness, Slabbekoorn explains, “We’re going on a silent walk. We will walk in a line, not talking, in total stillness, to become more aware of all the sounds around us.” It would be even better, he adds, to also close our eyes, but that would pose too many navigational challenges."|"Darwin Comes to Town"|"Menno Schilthuizen"
12:00|mid-day|"“Pang!” Sow-Yan uses both hands, one pulling an invisible trigger, the other holding an imaginary barrel aimed at the blazing mid-day Singaporean sky, to imitate a rifle shot. Again he goes, “pang!!.” The impersonation comes in reply to my question about the Indian house crow situation. “In my area, they shoot them down,” he elaborates with some indignation. “For no reason! Just someone complains about them, and that’s it. Also, everybody is using the wheelie-bin now, so the crows cannot get to the garbage anymore. Last time, they would just tear open all the refuse bags.”"|"Darwin Comes to Town"|"Menno Schilthuizen"
