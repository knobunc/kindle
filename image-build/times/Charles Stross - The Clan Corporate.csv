"ap >> 10:00"|"well after ten o’clock"|"Mid-afternoon, Helge returned to her rooms to check briefly on the arrangements for her travel to the Östhalle-it being high summer, with the sun setting well after ten o’clock, she need not depart until close to seven-then turned to Lady Kara. “I would like to see Lady Olga, if she’s available. Will you investigate? I haven’t seen her around lately.”"|"The Clan Corporate"|"Charles Stross"
"ap 08:50"|"Ten to nine"|"“Then ye’ll just have to tell me what time it says?”
He hauled out his watch and flipped it open. “Ten to nine.”
“Jolly good.” With a sigh and a rustle his welcomer moved aside to let him into the cubicle. Farnsworth sat down gratefully. “I’ve taken the liberty of ordering your pint already.” He was a plump, slightly shabby man whom Farnsworth knew only as Jack. Farnsworth had studiously suppressed any instinct to dig deeper. Jack wore a dark suit, shiny at the elbows, and a red silk cravat that although clean was clearly in need of ironing. Beside him sat another fellow, unknown to Farnsworth: a long-faced man in early middle age, but with a consumptive pallor about him and a face that seemed to chronicle more insults than any one life should bear. Farnsworth removed his hat and scarf and placed them fastidiously on one of the hooks screwed to the upper rail of the booth. “Have you anything to report?”"|"The Clan Corporate"|"Charles Stross"
"~ 18:00"|"about six o’clock in the evening"|"It was only about six o’clock in the evening, far too early to turn over and go back to sleep if he wanted to be ready for the office tomorrow. Mike shook his head, trying to dislodge the cobwebs. Then he sat up, gently pushed Oscar out of the way, and began to undress. After ten minutes in the shower with the heat turned right up he felt almost human, although the taste in his mouth and the stubble itching on his jaw felt like curious reminders of a forgotten binge. Virtual bar-hopping, all the aftereffects with none of the fun. He shook his head disgustedly, toweled himself dry, dragged on sweat pants and tee, then took stock."|"The Clan Corporate"|"Charles Stross"
"ap 02:15"|two-fifteen|"“This man was arrested yesterday at two-fifteen, stepping off the Acela from Boston with a suitcase that contained some rather interesting items. Agents Fleming and Garfinkle will be pleased to know that information they passed on from the preliminary debriefing of source Greensleeves directly contributed to the bust. Mr. Morgan here was charged with possession of five kilograms of better than ninety-five percent pure cocaine hydrochloride, which goes some way to explain his agitation. There were, ah, other items in the suitcase."|"The Clan Corporate"|"Charles Stross"

Miriam turned out of bed at seven in the morning, forced down as much of a light breakfast as she could manage in the already oppressive heat, then alighted with her bag at Dunedin station. From there it was a brief cab ride to the safe house, an anonymous classical villa in the middle of a leafy suburb on the edge of the city center. She knocked on the door, and her contact ushered her into a basement room. Then he waited outside while she opened one of the two lockets she wore on a fine gold chain around her neck and focused on it."|"The Clan Corporate"|"Charles Stross"

It’s almost two o’clock! Quick, we must get you back to your rooms immediately, there’s barely time.”"|"The Clan Corporate"|"Charles Stross"

"~ 05:00"|"about five in the morning"|"“Well.” Pete looked embarrassed. “I asked him how he thought it had worked, and that was when he got agitated. Said you’d told him something about him being in military custody now? So I tried to get him calmed down, told him it wasn’t what it sounded like. But he wasn’t having it. And at about five in the morning he went missing. Do I have to draw you a diagram?”"|"The Clan Corporate"|"Charles Stross"

Once the Queen Mother placed her youngest grandson in play … well, one day you’ll know enough to admit I was right, although I don’t ever expect you to thank me for it.” He glanced at the window. “You have enough time to get ready. A coach will be waiting for you at nine. It’s up to you whether you go willingly, or in leg irons.”"|"The Clan Corporate"|"Charles Stross"
