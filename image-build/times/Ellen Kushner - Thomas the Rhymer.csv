12:00|noontide|"Thomas was restless that morning; it was no surprise to me when he set off for Huntsleigh Farm a little short of the noontide."|"Thomas the Rhymer"|"Ellen Kushner"
"> 12:00"|"after noon"|"Next day he went to see Elspeth on his own. And a fair day it was, the skies deep blue, the air so clear you could see the hills spreading out into beyond, all the way to the haze of the sea, and, westward, smoke rising from the chimneys of a town a day’s walk away. The pair of them returned late after noon, the girl in a temper, but for once not with him."|"Thomas the Rhymer"|"Ellen Kushner"
12:00|"high noon"|"I drank from a pitcher of juice, this time pressed from oranges —a fortune squeezed to pulp for me!—and then I sat on a bench against the wall of the garden, and watched the light grow stronger, felt it glow golden warm on my skin, until it was as hot and bright as high noon. The water of the fountain pool sparkled, dazzling. But there was no sun reflected in it."|"Thomas the Rhymer"|"Ellen Kushner"
12:00|noon|"Hours must have passed, though the courtyard was still bathed in noon light. I was getting some nice sounds out of a sort of mechanical psaltery worked by ivory tablets connected to hammers, one for each triple-string—but working it was slow going, and I was forming an idea for a tune."|"Thomas the Rhymer"|"Ellen Kushner"
12:00|noon|"I had not played a verse or two, when I felt a chill shadow fall on me. But it was still bright noon, and no shadows were in that land. I sang on:"|"Thomas the Rhymer"|"Ellen Kushner"
00:00|midnight|"There it was at last; I had taken the song as far as it could go. All the tale was there: the jealous mother and her cruel deed; the burying of the knight and Eleanor’s transformation; the king’s high favor and her midnight tears. It was time to bring back the dove."|"Thomas the Rhymer"|"Ellen Kushner"
"ap 01:00"|one|"Thus employed, I learned that Hugh had five sisters living, one by his own mother and four by his father’s second wife. No wonder Errol wanted him spliced with Elizabeth Drummond: her portion aside, it was time he secured an heir for his son, or else one of the daughter’s husband’s heirs might walk off with the Errol lands."|"Thomas the Rhymer"|"Ellen Kushner"
00:00|midnight|"It was when I found myself caught in the song, thinking of Janet and Tam Lin and seeing the faery procession, bridle bells ringing at midnight, instead of the hall at hand, that I knew the boy had inherited all his father’s gifts."|"Thomas the Rhymer"|"Ellen Kushner"
00:00|midnight|"“Do you remember,” I say, although I know he never forgets anything, “do you remember that cloak Gavin wove for young Tam when he was small, and how Meg told him it was a Cloak of Invisibility, woven at midnight from the wool of unbaptized lambs?”"|"Thomas the Rhymer"|"Ellen Kushner"
