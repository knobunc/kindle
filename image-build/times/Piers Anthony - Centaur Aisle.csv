00:00|midnight|"""I don't know his talent!"" Humfrey snapped. ""I've been burning the midnight magic and cracking mirrors trying to ascertain it—but there seems to be nothing he does."""|"Centaur Aisle"|"Piers Anthony"
00:00|midnight|"Dor glanced down at the gift. It shone like a miniature sun, almost too bright to gaze at directly. It was a midnight sunstone, the rarest of all gems. ""Uh, thanks,"" he said lamely. He didn't know how to deal with this sort of thing. He tucked the gem into a pocket and rejoined Beauregard, who was urging him on. As he reached the dais and mounted it, the hubbub diminished. The ceremony was incipient."|"Centaur Aisle"|"Piers Anthony"
00:00|midnight|"Grundy the Golem entertained himself by chatting with passing fish and sea creatures. It was amazing, the gossip he came up with. A sneaky sawfish was cutting in on the time of the damselfish of a hammerhead, and the hammerhead was getting suspicious. Pretty soon he would pound the teeth out of the sawfish. A sea squirt was shoring himself up with the flow from an undersea fresh-water spring, getting tipsy on the rare liquid. A certain little oyster was getting out of bed at midnight and gambling with the sand dollars; he was building up quite an alluvial deposit at the central bank of sand. But when his folks found out, he would be gamboling to a different tune."|"Centaur Aisle"|"Piers Anthony"
00:00|midnight|"Startled, Dor checked himself. Light was streaming from one of his pockets. ""Oh—that's the midnight sunstone Jewel gave me so I'll always have light. I had forgotten about it."""|"Centaur Aisle"|"Piers Anthony"
00:00|midnight|"Dor woke again as dawn came. The sun had somehow gotten around to the east, where the land was, and dried off so that it could shine again, Dor wondered what perilous route it employed. Maybe it had a tunnel to roll along. If it ever figured out a way to get down without taking a dunking in the ocean, it would really have it made! Maybe he should suggest that to it sometime. After all, some mornings the sun was up several hours before drying out enough to shine with full brilliance; obviously some nights were worse than others. But he would not make the suggestion right now; he didn't want the sun heading off to explore new routes, leaving Xanth dark for days at a time. Dor needed the light to see his way to Centaur Isle. Jewel's midnight sunstone was not enough."|"Centaur Aisle"|"Piers Anthony"
00:00|midnight|"He found himself in a man-sized passage, leading south, under the channel. The light from the entrance faded rapidly. But Irene had thoughtfully planted starflowers along the way, and their pinpoint lights marked the progress of the tunnel, Dor paused to unwrap his midnight sunstone; its beam helped considerably."|"Centaur Aisle"|"Piers Anthony"
"ap 06:00"|"six o'clock"|"A wyvern detached itself from the battle with the tangler and winged toward them. ""Look out behind; enemy at six o'clock!"" Grundy cried."|"Centaur Aisle"|"Piers Anthony"
00:00|midnight|"Dor brought out his midnight sunstone. Now it possessed only the faintest internal glimmer—and in a moment that, too, faded out."|"Centaur Aisle"|"Piers Anthony"
00:00|midnight|"Dor checked. ""No. They must have searched us and taken everything they thought was valuable or dangerous. I don't have my sword either."" But then his questing fingers found something small. ""I do have the jar of salve, not that it's much good here. And my midnight sunstone; it fell into the jacket lining. Let me see—"" He brought it out. ""No, I guess not. This has no light."""|"Centaur Aisle"|"Piers Anthony"
12:00|midday|"""Yes,"" she agreed. ""That's really our best hope. Ill-treatment. We don't even need to trick anybody. All we have to do is wait. By midday tomorrow Smash will be storming. We'll all escape over the dead bodies of the guards who get in the way. We may not need the centaurs at all!"""|"Centaur Aisle"|"Piers Anthony"
00:00|midnight|"Did some magic adhere to portions of the centaur that were removed from his body? Dor brought out his midnight sunstone gem and held it close to the hairs. Almost, he thought, he saw a gleam of light, deep within the crystal. But maybe that was a reflection from the wan illumination of the cell."|"Centaur Aisle"|"Piers Anthony"
"< 00:00"|"near midnight"|"Beyond the castle the way grew more difficult. This was truly mountainous country, and there was a high pass between the two redoubts. Dor and the others were not yet fully rested from their arduous climb to Onesti of a day or so ago; now the stiffness of muscles was aggravated. But the path assured them there was no better route. Perhaps that was its conceit— but they had no ready alternative. So they hauled themselves up and up, until near midnight they came to the highest pass. It was a narrow gap between jags."|"Centaur Aisle"|"Piers Anthony"
00:00|midnight|"But Dor used his talent, making the path call out warnings of hazards, so that they could proceed more rapidly than other strangers might. His midnight sunstone helped, too, casting just enough light to make pitfalls almost visible. But he knew they couldn't remain on the path long, because the soldiers were more familiar with it, and had their torches, and would surely catch up. They would have to pull off and hide—and that might not be enough, this time. There was too little room for concealment, and the soldiers would be too wary."|"Centaur Aisle"|"Piers Anthony"
00:00|Midnight|"Chapter 12. Midnight Sun
In midday, weary but hopeful, they reached Castle Ocna. This was less imposing than Castle Onesti, but still formidable. The outer wall was far too high for them to scale. ""Me bash to trash,"" Smash offered confidently."|"Centaur Aisle"|"Piers Anthony"

00:00|midnight|"""The midnight sunstone!"" Dor exclaimed. After all, it was just about midnight now. Without waiting for King Trent to take the matter further, Dor drew it from his pocket. ""King Omen, as a sincere token of amity between the Kingdom of Xanth and the Kingdom of Onesti and of my appreciation for the manner you saved my life, allow me to present you with this rarest of gems. Note that it shines in the presence of magic—but turns dull in the absence of magic. Thus you will always know when magic is near."" He gave the gem to King Omen, who stepped out of the magic aisle, then back in, fascinated by the manner the gem faded and flashed again."|"Centaur Aisle"|"Piers Anthony"

00:00|midnight|"""Another dastardly deed performed in the light of the midnight sun-stone,"" Grundy said. And Dor had to hold Irene delightfully tight to prevent her from kicking the golem."|"Centaur Aisle"|"Piers Anthony"
