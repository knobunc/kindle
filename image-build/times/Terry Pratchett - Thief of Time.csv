"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"It was three o’clock. And every clock struck it at once. Cuckoos cuckoo’d, the hour pins fell out of the candle clock, the water clocks gurgled and seesawed back as the buckets emptied, bells clanged, gongs banged, chimes tinkled, and the Ephebian lawyer beetle turned a somersault."|"Thief of Time"|"Terry Pratchett"

They were only any good if your idea of accuracy was ‘around two-ish.’” He grimaced when he used the term. It felt like fingernails on a blackboard."|"Thief of Time"|"Terry Pratchett"

Mr. Soak was a friend, which in Jeremy’s limited social vocabulary meant “someone I speak to once or twice a week.” He approved of the milkman, because he was regular and punctual and had the bottles at the doorstep every morning on the stroke of 7 A.M. “Er, er…goodbye,” he said."|"Thief of Time"|"Terry Pratchett"

Women weren’t allowed in the club at all except under Rule Thirty-four B, which grudgingly allowed for female members of the family or respectable married ladies over thirty to be entertained to tea in the Green Drawing Room between 3:15 and 4:30 P.M., provided at least one member of staff was present at all times. This had been the case for so long that many members now interpreted it as being the only seventy-five minutes in the day when women were actually allowed to exist and, therefore, any women seen in the club at any other time were a figment of their imagination."|"Thief of Time"|"Terry Pratchett"

Lady LeJean also did not appear in Twurps’ Peerage or the Almanack de Gothic or any of the other reference books Igor had checked as a matter of course, which meant that she had something to hide. Of course, he had worked for masters who occasionally had a great deal to hide, sometimes in deep holes at midnight. But this situation was morally different for two reasons. Her ladyship wasn’t his master, Jeremy was, and that was where his loyalty lay. And Igor had decided it was morally different."|"Thief of Time"|"Terry Pratchett"

And then she was gone. Except that she was still there, I think. In the air.”"|"Thief of Time"|"Terry Pratchett"
