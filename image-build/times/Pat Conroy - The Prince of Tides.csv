17:00|"five o’clock in the afternoon"|"It was five o’clock in the afternoon Eastern Standard Time when the telephone rang in my house on Sullivans Island, South Carolina. My wife, Sallie, and I had just sat down for a drink on the porch overlooking Charleston Harbor and the Atlantic. Sallie went in to answer the telephone and I shouted, “Whoever it is, I’m not here.”"|"The Prince of Tides"|"Pat Conroy"
05:00|"five in the morning"|"“See that,” my father said, crowing. “See the living proof. I’m supposed to eat food a dog won’t touch. I get up at five in the morning, bust my ass catching a shrimp or two, work like a dock nigger from morning till night, then come home and eat food the dumbest dog in the world won’t touch.”"|"The Prince of Tides"|"Pat Conroy"
05:00|"five in the morning"|"Luke, Savannah, and I began a ritual of rising at five in the morning and setting a string of crab pots in the river. We would empty the traps of blue crabs, spilling them into a large barrel centered in the boat and baiting the traps with fresh mullet and trash fish. We began with twenty traps and by summer’s end we were pulling out fifty along twenty miles of river and creek. Because we were new on the river, we had to respect the rights of the commercial crabbers and set out pots in remote channels far from Colleton proper. We ranged far and wide throughout the county, leaving the wire traps as the signature of our passing. Tying white floats to a rope, we would haul the baited traps into the advancing or withdrawing tides. You could follow us from float to float over the wildest, most desolate stretches of our county. At first we worked slowly and our movements were inexpert and wasteful. But we grew into our task, learned the rhythms of the work, and developed an expertise based on our initial mistakes. In the first month, it took us ten minutes to empty a trap of crabs and to bait it again for the next tide. But in the second month, the same operation took us less than two minutes per trap. It was a matter of perfecting the technique of crabbing. We refined our movements; we learned grace and the economy of precise gestures; we learned that crabbing, like everything else, had its own native beauty, its own properties of dance. We broke even the first month because all our profits went into buying new traps. In the second month, we paid the note on our father’s shrimp boat. The older crabbers watched our progress as we brought our catch to be weighed. In the beginning, we were the object of their derision and jokes. By August, we were initiates into their brotherhood. They would gather around to admire Savannah’s rough and calloused hands. They gave sound advice. They taught us the mysteries of their rugged craft. Then, after we had mastered the essentials, they praised us by their silence. We were born to the river and they expected us to be good at what we were born to do."|"The Prince of Tides"|"Pat Conroy"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"We awoke at three in the morning and slipped out of the house through our bedroom window. Soundlessly, we made our way down to the dock, and Luke did not start the motor until we had drifted a quarter of a mile from our house. He turned the boat into the main channel and he headed for the lights of Colleton across the river. He opened up the throttle and we flew through a light, choppy sea on a full tide. We were laughing as we passed under the bridge, but grew silent as we approached the landing at the end of the Street of Tides. Luke cut the motor and we drifted a hundred feet up to the shore where I jumped out and tied the boat to the community dock. We lifted the turtle out of the boat, and stopping often to rest, we moved through the dark abandoned streets of our town toward the Newbury house. We passed beneath the oaks that formed the green canopy along the most distinguished row of houses between Savannah and Charleston. Dogs barked far off in the town. I cut my hand on one of the barnacles that had adhered to the loggerhead’s back. The air was cold and Christmas tree lights winked in some of the windows."|"The Prince of Tides"|"Pat Conroy"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"Each morning he met me at eight; he was always there waiting when I jogged into the park from the Village. We ended our practice sessions in a series of wind sprints where I would race Bernard in the forty-yard dash. On the first day, we ran ten dashes and I won six of them. On Friday of the same week, Bernard won seven of them. After practice I would buy him a Coke and send him home to shower before he began his violin lessons. As his coach, I was making him obedient to a cold and wearying discipline. Because of his desire, he found, to his happy surprise, that he loved it. At the end of the first week, Bernard began to think of himself as a football player. I had transformed him into something he was never supposed to be. He returned the favor by making me feel like a coach again. His mouth still bothered me and he asked too many questions. It took him far too long to learn the basics of the game. But he kept trying and he burned with a love of the sport. He thrilled me and made me understand again the mystery of why I loved to teach boys the rudiments of a game I had played as a child. If a boy came to me in good faith and wanted to learn the game of football, I could make him better than he ever thought he could be. I could light a fire in that boy and other boys would hate to see him on the same field. Already, I could tell that there were boys from Phillips Exeter now asleep in Newport and Westchester who would hurt in the coming autumn because Bernard Woodruff spent his summer learning the fine points of his game in Central Park."|"The Prince of Tides"|"Pat Conroy"
12:00|noon|"But behind the wheel of his shrimp boat, with the dawn spilling its fine oils across the waters and the winches groaning beneath the weight of the nets, my father was the perfect master of his environment. His time on the river had left its mark and he would always look ten years older than his actual age. Each year his wind-tortured face would sag a bit around the edges and the Carolina sun at nigh noon would loosen and flense the pouches beneath the eyes. His skin was hard and leathery and it looked as though you could strike a kitchen match on the stubble of his chin. His hands were rough and his palms were glazed with layers of calluses the color of vellum. He was a hard-working and respected shrimper, but his talents were not amphibious; they did not follow him up onto dry land. Very early on, my father became obsessed with getting off the river. Shrimping was always a “temporary” situation with him. Neither of my parents could ever admit that shrimping was a beautiful way of life. They kept aloof from the shrimping fraternity and cut themselves off from any of those natural alliances so common among peers. Of course, the shrimpers and their wives were far too common for my mother’s speciously cultivated and unattenuated tastes. My parents had no close friends. Together, they spent their whole lives waiting for their luck to change, as though luck were some fabulous tide that would one day flood and consecrate the marshes of our island, christening us in the iridescent ointments of a charmed destiny. It was an article of faith to Henry Wingo that he was a businessman of genius. Never has a man’s basic assumption about himself been so heartbreakingly wrong or caused him or his family so much prolonged and unnecessary grief."|"The Prince of Tides"|"Pat Conroy"
12:00|"high noon"|"He did have a singular talent for extravaganza and he opened Wingo Esso with enough fanfare to bring half the town to his corner of the world. He talked the band director into marching the high school band straight down the Street of Tides at high noon, led by baton-twirling majorettes and Mr. Fruit shimmying and shaking out his own wild improvised dance, keeping time with his whistle, throwing his head straight back into sunlight, then jackknifing forward until his nose nearly touched his shoelaces. When the band made the turn into the gas station, my father released three hundred helium-filled balloons, which rose straight up into the air and hovered over the town like lost flowers. He handed out lollipops and bubble gum to the kids. Roman candles exploded on the roof, showering sparks to the ground. The circus clown showed up late and my father was both surprised and delighted that he was a midget. The clown was drunk and broke a dozen Coke bottles trying to juggle them on the back of our pickup truck. The mayor of Colleton, Boogie Weiters, at the ribbon-cutting ceremony, made a rather impassioned speech on the importance of attracting new industry to Colleton County. The drunk clown shouted that that should be easy since Colleton County had never attracted any old industry. The crowd applauded the clown, who responded with a spectacular handstand on the cab of the pickup. The Volunteer Fire Department arrived with their new fire truck and received a whole tank of gas free of charge because Henry Wingo wanted them to know how much he appreciated the fine job they were doing protecting the property of Colleton. A reporter from the Colleton Gazette interviewed my father and took his picture with the clown sitting on his shoulder. The high school band played a medley of patriotic songs and my father raised an American flag on top of the gas station when they played “The Star-Spangled Banner.” Toward the end of the day, the flag was set afire by an errant Roman candle and was extinguished by the members of the Volunteer Fire Department."|"The Prince of Tides"|"Pat Conroy"

From noon to three on that commemorative day he would walk up and down the length of the Street of Tides to remind the backsliding, sinful citizenry of my hometown of the unimaginable suffering of Jesus Christ on that melancholy hill above Jerusalem so long ago. It was the summit and the Grand Guignol of my grandfather’s liturgical year; it embodied characteristics of both the saints and the asylum.

When the walk was completed at three, so was the bottle, and my grandmother would be comatose until late the next morning. When she awoke to her memorial headache, she would find my grandfather on his knees, praying for her sweet, boozy soul."|"The Prince of Tides"|"Pat Conroy"

A shrimper from Charleston witnessed the capture of the white porpoise at 1130 hours that morning, saw Carolina Snow panic and charge the encircling nets, saw when she entangled herself, and admired the swiftness and skill of the crew as they got their ropes around her, held her head above the water to keep her from drowning, and maneuvered her into one of the motorboats."|"The Prince of Tides"|"Pat Conroy"
12:00|noon|"The crowd was large and good-natured and we followed a processional of Bermuda shorts and rubber-soled thongs toward the amphitheater where the killer whale, Dreadnought, would perform at noon. From our brief encounter, Florida seemed to be a place where amiable crowds met to display white shapeless arms and acres of sun-starved hairless legs. The sun had parched the grass to the palest of greens and automatic sprinkler systems worked the infields off the gravel paths and ruby-throated hummingbirds droned among the lilies. As we neared the amphitheater, we passed a sign that read, “Visit Moby Porpoise at feeding time.”"|"The Prince of Tides"|"Pat Conroy"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"We found Carolina Snow in her own small enclosed pool, cut off from the companionship of the other porpoises. A large and curious crowd surrounded her enclosure and she swam from side to side, looking disoriented and faintly bored. She had not yet learned a single trick but was certainly earning her keep as an item of curiosity. The announcer described the capture of the white porpoise and made it sound like the most dangerous, exotic venture since the discovery of the Northwest Passage. At three o’clock we watched a keeper bring a bucket of fish to feed the Snow. He threw a blue runner at the opposite end of the pool from where Snow was swimming. She turned and in a movement of surprising delicacy accelerated across the pool and took the fish from the top of the water. We listened as the tourists tried to describe her color. We, her liberators, listened with pride as we heard strangers speak of her pale luminous beauty."|"The Prince of Tides"|"Pat Conroy"

By midday the tide was full and when it turned, the winds kept the tides from receding and a titanic struggle ensued. The wind wreaked havoc among the orchards and the rows of beans. After lunch, Luke invited Savannah and me to accompany him to the south end of the island, where he planned to spend the afternoon fertilizing the pecan grove that had not borne fruit for two years. I told my brother cheerfully that I did not care if the pecan trees of Melrose Island did not produce a single nut in the next fifty years, that I did not intend to walk about the island in such peculiar weather.

He let them get three-quarters of a mile down the beach before he walked in a straight line to the ocean without looking to his right or left. If someone saw his bold move to the water, he figured he was a dead man. But if he waited for daylight he had no chance at all. He reached the water and hurled Blackstock over a wave and dove in after him. It took him fifteen minutes to get past the breakers and into open water.

He was the main suspect, of course, but no one had seen him to make a positive identification. Like the Viet Cong he had come to admire so much, Luke owned those long morning hours after midnight when he filled the lives of ill-paid guards with dread. He moved only at night in his displaced country, avoiding the patrol boats in the rivers and the cruising police cars along the abandoned roads. As the weeks passed, a terrible sense of priesthood obsessed him as he walked through the memorized woods of his childhood. He heard voices and began to see the faces of his family materialize in the branches of trees. All the hallucinations—or visions, as he preferred to call them—were brimming with applause and consent for the efficacy of his mission, his sacred walkabout in the war zone where he served as a liberation army of one.

The reason I need to stop him, Savannah, is because, in the deepest part of me, I believe in the rectitude of his private war with the world. Because I believe it so deeply, his sense of engagement is a constant reminder of how much I’ve surrendered.

From the Viet Cong he had learned to reach an accordance with darkness and the efficacy of patience in dealing with a numerically superior enemy. He recounted his long surveillance of the four bridges he had taken out on the northern frontier of the county. He could not believe how poorly guarded those bridges were or how easy it was to set powerful time bombs to go off simultaneously at two a.m. and still be back at Marsh Hen Island before the sun rose. He had improved security on the bridges leading to the county immeasurably, he told us, but the death of the men on the train had changed the nature of his protest.

The island dogs are afraid. It is October 4, 1944, ten o’clock in the evening. The tide is rising and will not be full until 1:49 the next morning."|"The Prince of Tides"|"Pat Conroy"
"ap < 11:00"|"almost eleven"|"The storm would be called Bathsheba by the black people of the lowcountry, and she would kill two hundred seventeen people along the South Carolina coast. My grandfather checked his watch. It was almost eleven. He opened to the book of Job and read for an hour. He thought about his son and his wife. My grandmother had left him during the Depression. In his heart, there were times when my grandfather was bitter with the Lord. He read about Job and was comforted. Then he wept again for his only son."|"The Prince of Tides"|"Pat Conroy"
02:00|"Two o’clock in the morning"|"Two o’clock in the morning, the tide is supposed to be ebbing now, he thought. He could not understand why the water was not receding. Tide was one of the immutable constants of life by the river and he could not fathom why it had chosen this moment to betray itself and his family. Outside, the prodigious winds devastated the trees of the island in a two-hundred-mile-an-hour assault. Oak trees were lifted out of the ground like a child pulling candles out of a birthday cake. Saplings hurtled through the air like leaves. Ah, my grandfather thought, listening to that wind rush through the door of the barn like a train entering a small tunnel, it is the wind holding back the tide. He knew that this storm nullified even the moon’s pull and all daily laws were canceled in the horror and majesty of its passage."|"The Prince of Tides"|"Pat Conroy"
">> 00:00"|"long after midnight"|"Arriving after sundown, the priest would often not leave my father’s side until long after midnight. In my father, Günter Kraus had found the perfect friend: captive, injured, and always available."|"The Prince of Tides"|"Pat Conroy"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"The story grew slowly and as it unfolded I began to feel an interior strength flicker into life. I spent the first few days reviewing the tapes that so chillingly recorded the extent of my sister’s breakdown. She spoke in hurt fragments of language. I wrote her screams down on paper, studied them, and each day startled myself with some clear vision of memory I had repressed or forgotten. Each of her phrases, no matter how surreal or bizarre, had a foundation in reality, and each memory led to another and another until my head blazed with small intricate geometries of illumination. There were days when I could hardly wait for my five o’clock meetings with Dr. Lowenstein."|"The Prince of Tides"|"Pat Conroy"
"ap 05:00"|"Five o’clock"|"The air-conditioning thermostat in Dr. Lowenstein’s office was always turned down too low. I would come in off those torrid, filmy streets, begrimed with sweat and dust, and involuntarily shiver as I entered that suite of well-appointed offices with their false, unseasonal weather. The outer office where the receptionist, Mrs. Barber, worked was always a degree or two warmer than the chill, nearly arctic temperature of the waiting room. Five o’clock sunlight divided her face into symmetrical slats whenever I entered for my weekday soliloquies with Dr. Lowenstein."|"The Prince of Tides"|"Pat Conroy"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"For a week the police parked a patrol car on Rosedale Road and a plainclothes detective circled our home several times during the night. My mother could not sleep at night and we would find her hovering over us after midnight, obsessively checking and rechecking the locks on our bedroom windows. Once I awoke and saw her framed in moonlight, staring out toward the forests of Callanwolde. As she stood there, I noticed her body for the first time, observed in guilt and terror its soft, voluptuous features, admired the shape of her full breasts and the curve of her waist as she scanned the moonlit yard for the approach of her enemy."|"The Prince of Tides"|"Pat Conroy"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"“There you are,” she said. “You’re absolutely sure you could handle my problems, but you have trouble handling your own. That’s the way I feel about my profession. When I leave the office at six o’clock, I leave everything behind me. I don’t think once about the patients I saw that day. I’ve learned to separate my professional life from my private life.”"|"The Prince of Tides"|"Pat Conroy"
"ap < 07:00"|"nearly seven o’clock"|"It was nearly seven o’clock when she rose from her chair, signaling the end of our time together for another day. She motioned for me to stay for a moment and walked to her desk to use the telephone."|"The Prince of Tides"|"Pat Conroy"

"~ 16:30"|vespers|"But she had misheard my mother’s pronunciation of the word guardian and when she wrote down the dialogues between Aretha and Norton, she described them as her “garden angels.” There were many “garden angels” surrounding our house, hovering like the souls of azaleas above us. There were unborn Wingo children simmering beneath the thorns of roses. The garden angels were under a divine obligation to love and protect our house. They said vespers in the trees and watched over us, not because God required it, but because they cherished us and could not help it. She even recruited Norton as a foot soldier in that silent army of occupation which patrolled the winds above the river. Even a dark angel was susceptible to Savannah’s enthusiastic overtures. Savannah never believed that Norton was an agent of Satan; she claimed he was just Presbyterian."|"The Prince of Tides"|"Pat Conroy"
"ap 09:30"|9:30|"It was raining when I arrived at the Coach House at 9:30 to meet Susan Lowenstein for dinner. The maître d’ led me to a comfortable table upstairs, placed remotely beneath several folk paintings aging well on the red brick walls. I ordered a Manhattan, honoring the island on which I sat, and only when I tasted the ghastly concoction did I remember why I had never developed a fondness for that particular cocktail. The waiter understood perfectly and brought me a dry martini to cleanse my palate."|"The Prince of Tides"|"Pat Conroy"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"Sharon McKissick was eight years old and felt the full weight of being the youngest. She thought that no one in her family ever took her seriously because she was so small and fragile. Everyone had called her “Baby” McKissick until she was six and reminded everyone that she had a name and it was Sharon. No one had taken the time to explain her father’s death to her because they thought she was too little to understand. On the day of her father’s funeral, her mother had come to her room and in a trembling voice told her that her father had gone to sleep. She had made her mother cry by answering, “For how long?” So she had been afraid to ask any more questions. She had watched the grass grow over her father’s grave. At first it was a few blades coming out of the earth, then one day, it was all green, like a pretty bedspread covering the place where he was sleep ing. She could see her father’s grave from her window and it bothered her at night that he might be lonely. When the wind would rise off the river, she would climb from her bed and gaze out the window toward his grave. In moonlight, she could see it, though it seemed to have nothing to do with her father. She tried to imagine angels gathering around his tombstone, helping him survive the solitude of the windswept night. But nothing helped and she vowed to herself if she ever had an eight-year-old, that child would know everything there was about life, death, and everything in between. She would show them all when she was nine. At nine, they would listen to her and she certainly had some things to say."|"The Prince of Tides"|"Pat Conroy"
