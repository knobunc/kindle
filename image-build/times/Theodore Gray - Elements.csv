15:25|"3:25 p.m."|"Every field has its legends, told and retold until they take on an air of mythology. One is how Enrico Fermi created the first sustained nuclear chain reaction in a racquets court under Stagg Field at the University of Chicago. His Chicago Pile One, or CP-1, went critical on December 2, 1942, at 3:25 p.m."|Elements|"Theodore Gray"
15:25|"3.25 p.m."|"The pile reached a ratio of 1.0006 at 3.25 p.m. and operated for 28 minutes, generating about half a watt of power. It wasn’t much, but it was enough for Enrico Fermi’s name to live forever in the legends of atomic power."|Elements|"Theodore Gray"
08:00|"8.3 hours"|"Astatine is considered naturally occurring, as are all the elements from hydrogen (1) to uranium (92), except technetium (43). But its half-life is only 8.3 hours, which means that whenever astatine occurs naturally it doesn’t stick around very long. A rough estimate indicates that at any given time there’s about an ounce of it present in the entire earth, and it’s never the same ounce from day to day: The supply is constantly refreshed by the slow radioactive decay of uranium and thorium (90), of which there is vastly more."|Elements|"Theodore Gray"
