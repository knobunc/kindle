"ap 00:00"|"Twelve o’clock"|"Not all, however. Twelve o’clock came, and the three boatbuilders, fathers of Joe, Bill and Pete, walked by the staithe as usual with a group of their friends, on the way to have their midday pints at the inn. They too stopped by the Death and Glory."|"The Big Six"|"Arthur Ransome"

"ap > 00:00"|"after twelve"|"“Bit late for you,” said the old man. “Tide’ll be working up till after twelve and eels won’t be running till tide turn.”"|"The Big Six"|"Arthur Ransome"
00:00|Midnight|"The old eelman laughed. “Come if you like,” he said. “But come quiet. Midnight. Not after. But who’s to wake you? Sleeping you’ll be when old Harry draw his setts.”"|"The Big Six"|"Arthur Ransome"
00:00|Midnight|"“Not us,” said Bill.
“Midnight then,” said the old man, “for them as wakes.”
He stumped off across the staithe to do his bit of shipping."|"The Big Six"|"Arthur Ransome"
00:00|midnight|"For a long time they had wanted to spend a night at the eel setts when the eels were working down the river. They had often visited the eelman by day, in the derelict old hulk in which he lived beside his nets, but they had never before had a chance of seeing him at work. When you sleep in houses people are not too pleased if you slip out at midnight, but now that they were living in the Death and Glory, Joe, Bill and Pete could for the first time make their hours fit their business."|"The Big Six"|"Arthur Ransome"
00:00|midnight|"“I tell ’em so,” said the old man. “I tell ’em so. Well, see you midnight if so be you ain’t sleeping. Mind you come quiet. When eels run they’re like other folk, want to have the river to themselves. You can fright eels easy, same as other fish.”"|"The Big Six"|"Arthur Ransome"
00:00|midnight|"They had come as far as the first of the big boatsheds that lay between the road and the river. At this time of year, with the season ending, boat after boat was being hauled up into it to lie under cover through the winter. They knew that men had been working late there. But this was midnight and all the village ought to be asleep, except for Tom and Joe, the other two who were waiting for them at the staithe and the old eelman who was going to let them see him lift his nets."|"The Big Six"|"Arthur Ransome"

“You’re right. Gone midnight. Seventy year today.”
“Many happy returns,” said Tom."|"The Big Six"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap > 00:00"|"after twelve o’clock"|"“Where were you last night after twelve o’clock?” said Mr. Tedder. “Where were you? Casting off moorings and sending boats adrift all down the reach. That’s what you were doing.”"|"The Big Six"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap > 00:00"|"after twelve o’clock"|"Mr. Tedder silenced everybody. “I’m making this inquiry,” he said. “Where was this boat last night after twelve o’clock?”"|"The Big Six"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 00:00"|"Twelve o’clock"|"“They come before turn of tide,” said the old man. “Twelve o’clock, likely, and they stay with me till daylight when the warmints stop running. Anything amiss?”"|"The Big Six"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 01:00"|one|"People on the staithe looked almost disappointed. Bill gave his bucket back to the eelman, who put it in the bottom of his boat, stepped ashore, and stumped off towards the inn. Mr. Tedder shut up his note-book, and looked first at one and then at another."|"The Big Six"|"Arthur Ransome"

At nine o’clock he caught his first fish, a good one. At half-past ten he caught another, not so good. Then came a long string of little ones not worth taking. Every penny earned would help in buying stores for the Death and Glory so that they would be able to go to distant places and not have to run home every other day for supplies. He spoke never a word, dropping the little ones sadly back into the river, welcoming the rare twopennies with a slow grin. He never even looked round, though once or twice he was too late in striking because of things said about casting boats adrift by people who stopped on the staithe behind him and watched, as people always do watch a fisherman, to see whether he was catching anything or not."|"The Big Six"|"Arthur Ransome"

"> 12:00"|"after midday"|"PETE’S clothes took a long time drying. The fisherman turned them inside out and all but cooked them and hung his boots close under the roof beside the hot chimney. The crew of the
Death and Glory settled down in the Cachalot and heard all about her building, and how her owner meant to use her all through the winter season when the pike fishing was at its best. They heard how he had been trying again and again for the big fish, coming all the way round from Norwich because of the better fishing in the northern waters. He gave them an enormous meal of pea soup and cold roast beef and chip potatoes and jam tart. At last soon after midday he let Pete get into his clothes again, though patches of mud on his knickerbockers were still too damp to brush. They washed up, after the meal, while the fisherman sat smoking, looking at the huge pike."|"The Big Six"|"Arthur Ransome"
