On the Tuesday morning Morel rose early. He was in good spirits. Quite early, before six o’clock, she heard him whistling away to himself downstairs. He had a pleasant way of whistling, lively and musical. He nearly always whistled hymns. He had been a choir-boy with a beautiful voice, and had taken solos in Southwell cathedral.

At the Moon and Stars they had their first drink, then on to the Old Spot. Then a long five miles of drought to carry them into Bulwell to a glorious pint of bitter. But they stayed in a field with some haymakers whose gallon bottle was full, so that, when they came in sight of the city, Morel was sleepy. The town spread upwards before them, smoking vaguely in the midday glare, fringing the crest away to the south with spires and factory bulks and chimneys.

Nine o’clock passed, and ten, and still “the pair” had not returned.

The children played in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight o’clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below. Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord. Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time, aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father’s fist on the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man’s voice got higher. And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children lay silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear what their father was doing. He might hit their mother again. There was a feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness, and a sense of blood. They lay with their hearts in the grip of an intense anguish. The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer. All the cords of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked. And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere, outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of blood? What had he done?"|"Sons and Lovers"|"D. H. Lawrence"

Then they started as the lights went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take the nine o’clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men, imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.

All the earningsof each stall were put down to the chief butty, as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the public-house or in his own home. So that the children could fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons. Each of the Morel children—William, then Annie, then Paul—had fetched the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.

Then he heard someone cough, and saw in the office at the end of the room an old, decaying clerk, in a round smoking-cap of black velvet embroidered with red and green, opening letters. He waited and waited. One of the junior clerks went to the old man, greeted him cheerily and loudly. Evidently the old  “chief” was deaf. Then the young fellow came striding importantly down to his counter. He spied Paul."|"Sons and Lovers"|"D. H. Lawrence"

"ap 08:30"|"half-past eight"|"Many of these letters, some of them in French or Norwegian, were a great puzzle to the boy.

He was a thin, sallow man with a red nose, quick, staccato, and smartly but stiffly dressed. He was about thirty-six years old. There was something rather “doggy,”ck rather smart, rather ’cute and shrewd, and something warm, and something slightly contemptible about him."|"Sons and Lovers"|"D. H. Lawrence"

Everywhere voices were calling weights, there was the chink of metal, the rapid snapping of string, the hurrying to old Mr. Melling for stamps. And at last the postman came with his sack, laughing and jolly. Then everything slacked off, and Paul took his dinner-basket and ran to the station to catch the eight-twenty train.

Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse, answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess. Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups, the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange, not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them. William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician  in Nottingham, was home for the holiday. Morel, as usual, was up early, whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven o’clock the family heard him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked with gusto to the little girl who brought them, calling her “my darling.” He turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling them they had been “kested”dc by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up, and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody, this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday. And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed, sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury. The room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety.

Hers were large, to match her large limbs, but white and powerful looking. As Paul looked at them he knew her. “She is wanting somebody to take her hands—for all she is so contemptuous of us,” he said to himself. And she saw nothing but his two hands, so warm and alive, which seemed to live for her. He was brooding now, staring out over the country from under sullen brows. The little, interesting diversity of shapes had vanished from the scene; all that remained was a vast, dark matrix of sorrow and tragedy, the same in all the houses and the river-flats and the people and the birds; they were only shapen differently. And now that the forms seemed to have melted away, there, remained the mass from which all the landscape was composed, a dark mass of struggle and pain. The factory, the girls, his mother, the large, uplifted church, the thicket of the town, merged into one atmosphere—dark, brooding, and sorrowful, every bit.

There was a stuffed owl in a case over a corner cupboard. The sunlight came through the leaves of the scented geraniums in the window. She was cooking a chicken in his honour. It was their cottage for the day, and they were man and wife. He beat the eggs for her and peeled the potatoes.

"ap 00:00"|"twelve o’clock"|"But the ache and strain of it could not go on much longer. He worked incessantly. Still it was only twelve o’clock. As if he had nailed his clothing against the desk, he stood there and worked, forcing every stroke out of himself. It was a quarter to one; he could clear away. Then he ran downstairs."|"Sons and Lovers"|"D. H. Lawrence"

"ap 02:05"|"five past two"|"And he had to be content. He went and got some dinner. All the time he was still under chloroform, and every minute was stretched out indefinitely. He walked miles of streets. Then he thought he would be late at the meeting-place. He was at the Fountain at five past two. The torture of the next quarter of an hour was refined beyond expression. It was the anguish of combining the living self with the shell. Then he saw her. She came! And he was there."|"Sons and Lovers"|"D. H. Lawrence"
"ap 08:58"|"Two minutes to nine"|"“What time is it?” she asked, quiet, definite, hopeless.
“Two minutes to nine,” he replied, telling the truth with a struggle.
“And can I get from here to the station in fourteen minutes?”"|"Sons and Lovers"|"D. H. Lawrence"
"ap 00:30"|"half-past twelve"|"After a while he glanced at the little clock that was ticking on the mantelpiece. It was half-past twelve."|"Sons and Lovers"|"D. H. Lawrence"
"ap 01:00"|one|"The clock struck one. Still the game continued. Mrs. Radford had done all the little jobs preparatory to going to bed, had locked the door and filled the kettle. Still Paul went on dealing and counting. He was obsessed by Clara’s arms and throat. He believed he could see where the division was just beginning for her breasts. He could not leave her. She watched his hands, and felt her joints melt as they moved quickly. She was so near; it was almost as if he touched her, and yet not quite. His mettle was roused. He hated Mrs. Radford. She sat on, nearly dropping asleep, but determined and obstinate in her chair. Paul glanced at her, then at Clara. She met his eyes, that were angry, mocking, and hard as steel. Her own answered him in shame. He knew she, at any rate, was of his mind. He played on."|"Sons and Lovers"|"D. H. Lawrence"
"ap 02:00"|two|"Immediately afterwards Paul heard the mother slowly mounting the stairs. The candlelight flashed through the cracks in his door. Her dress brushed the door, and his heart jumped. Then it was dark, and he heard the clatter of her latch. She was very leisurely indeed in her preparations for sleep. After a long time it was quite still. He  sat strung up on the bed, shivering slightly. His door was an inch open. As Clara came upstairs, he would intercept her. He waited. All was dead silence. The clock struck two. Then he heard a slight scrape of the fender downstairs. Now he could not help himself. His shivering was uncontrollable. He felt he must go or die."|"Sons and Lovers"|"D. H. Lawrence"
"ap ~ 05:00"|"about five o’clock"|"He laughed at once.
“It ought only to be about five o’clock,” he said.
“Well,” she answered, “it’s half-past seven, whether or not. Here, I’ve brought you a cup of tea.”"|"Sons and Lovers"|"D. H. Lawrence"
"ap 07:30"|"half-past seven"|"He laughed at once.

"ap 04:15"|four-fifteen|"“To-morrow—Sunday? Yes! Can you tell me about what time there is a train in the afternoon?”
“There is a Central gets in at four-fifteen.”
“And will there be any way of getting up to the house? Shall I have to walk?” The doctor smiled."|"Sons and Lovers"|"D. H. Lawrence"
"ap 03:30"|"half-past three"|"“But Minnie’s a good little wench, bless ’er heart!” He sat looking dismal.
“I s’ll have to be going at half-past three,” said Paul.
“It’s a trapse for thee, lad! Eight guineas! An’ when dost think she’ll be able to get as far as this?”"|"Sons and Lovers"|"D. H. Lawrence"
"ap ~ 11:00"|"just gone eleven"|"“Why, what time is it?” The murmur came plaintive and helpless.
“It’s only just gone eleven.”

“Yes; it’s nearly eight o’clock.”
He stood looking out of the window. The whole country was bleak and pallid under the snow. Then he felt her pulse. There was a strong stroke and a weak one, like a sound and its echo. That was supposed to betoken the end. She let him feel her wrist, knowing what he wanted."|"Sons and Lovers"|"D. H. Lawrence"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"Nurse did not come that night to settle Mrs. Morel down. Paul went up with the hot milk in a feeding-cup. It was nine o’clock."|"Sons and Lovers"|"D. H. Lawrence"
"ap ~ 11:00"|"about eleven"|"Morel was in bed. Nurse did not come. Annie and Paul came to look at her at about eleven. She seemed to be sleeping as usual after her draught. Her mouth had come a bit open."|"Sons and Lovers"|"D. H. Lawrence"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"Annie huddled into the dressing-gown, Paul wrapped himself in a brown blanket. It was three o’clock. He mended the fire. Then the two sat waiting. The great, snoring breath was taken—held awhile—then given back. There was a space—a long space. Then they started. The great, snoring breath was taken again. He bent close down and looked at her."|"Sons and Lovers"|"D. H. Lawrence"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"And in a few minutes Paul heard his father’s heavy steps go thudding over the deadening snow. Miners called in the streets as they tramped in gangs to work. The terrible, long-drawn breaths continued—heave—heave—heave; then a long pause—then—ah-h-h-h-h! as it came back. Far away over the snow sounded the hooters of the ironworks. One after another they crowed and boomed, some small and far away, some near, the blowers of the collieries and the other works. Then there was silence. He mended the fire. The great breaths broke the silence—she looked just the same. He put back the blind and peered out. Still it was dark. Perhaps there was a lighter tinge. Perhaps the snow was bluer. He drew up the blind and got dressed. Then, shuddering, he drank brandy from the bottle on the wash-stand. The snow was growing blue. He heard a cart clanking down the street. Yes, it was seven o’clock, and it was coming a little bit light. He heard some people calling. The world was waking. A grey, deathly dawn crept over the snow. Yes, he could see the houses. He put out the gas. It seemed very dark. The breathing came still, but he was almost used to it. He could see her. She was  just the same. He wondered if he piled heavy clothes on top of her it would stop. He looked at her. That was not her—not her a bit. If he piled the blanket and heavy coats on her—"|"Sons and Lovers"|"D. H. Lawrence"
"ap 07:40"|"twenty to eight"|"They whispered together a minute, then went downstairs to get breakfast. It was twenty to eight. Soon Annie came down."|"Sons and Lovers"|"D. H. Lawrence"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"It went on just the same. She lay with her cheek in her hand, her mouth fallen open, and the great, ghastly snores came and went.
At ten o’clock nurse came. She looked strange and woebegone.
“Nurse,” cried Paul, “she’ll last like this for days?”"|"Sons and Lovers"|"D. H. Lawrence"
"ap ~ 11:00"|"about eleven o’clock"|"At last, at about eleven o’clock, he went downstairs and sat in the neighbour’s house. Annie was downstairs also. Nurse and Arthur were upstairs. Paul sat with his head in his hand. Suddenly Annie came flying across the yard crying, half mad:"|"Sons and Lovers"|"D. H. Lawrence"
"ap ~ 04:00"|"about four o’clock"|"The father came home from work at about four o’clock. He dragged silently into the house and sat down. Minnie bustled to give him his dinner. Tired, he laid his black arms on the table. There were swede turnips for his dinner, which he liked. Paul wondered if he knew. It was some time, and nobody had spoken. At last the son said:"|"Sons and Lovers"|"D. H. Lawrence"
"ap ~ 00:00"|"About twelve this morning"|"“When wor that?”
“About twelve this morning.”
“H’m!”"|"Sons and Lovers"|"D. H. Lawrence"
"ap < 08:00"|"nearly eight o’clock"|"In a little while he went out. Annie went away, and Paul called on the undertaker, the clergyman, the doctor, the registrar. It was a long business. He got back at nearly eight o’clock. The undertaker was coming soon to measure for the coffin. The house was empty except for her. He took a candle and went upstairs."|"Sons and Lovers"|"D. H. Lawrence"
00:00|midnight|"After a while Paul went out of the house, and played cards at a friend’s. It was midnight when he got back. His father rose from the couch as he entered, saying in a plaintive way:"|"Sons and Lovers"|"D. H. Lawrence"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"Dawes had been driven to the extremity of life, until he was afraid. He could go to the brink of death, he could lie on the edge and look in. Then, cowed, afraid, he had to crawl back, and like a beggar take what offered. There was a certain nobility in it. As Clara saw, he owned himself beaten, and he wanted to be taken back whether or not. That she could do for him.
It was three o’clock.
“I am going by the four-twenty,” said Paul again to Clara. “Are you coming then or later?”"|"Sons and Lovers"|"D. H. Lawrence"

“I’m meeting my father in Nottingham at seven-fifteen,” he said.
“Then,” she answered, “I’ll come later.”"|"Sons and Lovers"|"D. H. Lawrence"
"ap ~ 04:00"|"about four o’clock"|"“There are one or two books in the corner,” said Morel. “I’ve done with ’em.”
At about four o’clock he went.
“I shall see you both later,” he said, as he shook hands."|"Sons and Lovers"|"D. H. Lawrence"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"After tea, as it drew near to six o’clock, he went to the window. All was dark outside. The sea was roaring."|"Sons and Lovers"|"D. H. Lawrence"
"ap 02:00"|two|"One evening he came home late to his lodging. The fire was burning low; everybody was in bed. He threw on some more coal, glanced at the table, and decided he wanted no supper. Then he sat down in the arm-chair. It was perfectly still. He did not know anything, yet he saw the dim smoke wavering up the chimney. Presently two mice came out, cautiously, nibbling the fallen crumbs. He watched them as it were from a long way off. The church clock struck two. Far away he could hear the sharp clinking of the trucks on the railway. No, it was not they that were far away. They were there in their places. But where was he himself?"|"Sons and Lovers"|"D. H.

"ap 09:30"|"half past nine"|"2   (p. 417) ”Did you sleep, my dear?” he asked: In a letter to the poet Rachel Annand Taylor dated December 1910, D. H. Lawrence writes, ”I have been at home now ten days. My mother is very near the end. Today I have been to Leicester. I did not get home till half past nine. Then I ran upstairs. Oh she was very bad. The pains had been again.‘Oh my dear,’ I said, ‘is it the pains?’"|"Sons and Lovers"|"D. H. Lawrence"
