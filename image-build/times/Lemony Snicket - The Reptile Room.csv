"ap 06:00"|"six o'clock"|"""Come on, come on, you are moving very slowly this morning,"" Uncle Monty said, bursting into the room. His face seemed even brighter than usual, and he was holding a small bunch of folded papers in one hand. ""Stephano has only worked here one day, and he's already in the Reptile Room. In fact, he was up before I was—I ran into him on my way down the stairs. He's an eager beaver. But you three—you're moving like the Hungarian Sloth Snake, whose top speed is half an inch per hour! We have lots to do today, and I'd like to catch the six o'clock showing of Zombies in the Snow tonight, so let's try to hurry, hurry, hurry."""|"The Reptile Room"|"Lemony Snicket"
"ap 05:00"|"five o'clock"|"""I know just what you mean!"" Uncle Monty said excitedly. ""This sort of behavior is indeed as dastardly as that terrible man's. That is why I'm doing this."" He raised one hand and waved the folded papers in the air. ""As you know,"" he said, ""tomorrow we are leaving for Peru. These are our tickets for the five o'clock voyage on the Prospero, a fine ship that will take us across the sea to South America. There's a ticket for me, one for Violet, one for Klaus, one for Stephano, but not one for Sunny because we're going to hide her in a suitcase to save money."""|"The Reptile Room"|"Lemony Snicket"
"ap 05:00"|"five o'clock"|"Stephano took no notice. ""Of course, after they discover that Dr. Montgomery is dead, they'll wonder what became of those repulsive orphans he had lying around the house. But they'll be long gone. Speaking of which, it's time to leave. The Prospero sails at five o'clock from Hazy Harbor and I'd like to be the first passenger aboard. That way I'll have time for a bottle of wine before lunch."""|"The Reptile Room"|"Lemony Snicket"
"ap 05:00"|"five o'clock"|"""Well, we don't have days,"" Violet said firmly. ""We don't even have hours. At five o'clock, the Prospero leaves Hazy Harbor, and Stephano is going to do everything he can to make sure we're on that ship. And if we end up alone in Peru with him—"""|"The Reptile Room"|"Lemony Snicket"
"ap 05:00"|"five o'clock"|"Sometimes, when someone tells a ridiculous lie, it is best to ignore it entirely. ""When I turn eighteen, as we all know,"" Violet continued, ignoring Stephano entirely, ""I inherit the Baudelaire fortune, and Stephano intended to get that fortune for himself. It would be easier to do so if we were in a location that was more difficult to trace, such as Peru."" Violet held up the small bunch of folded papers. ""These are tickets for the Prospero, leaving Hazy Harbor for Peru at five o'clock today. That's where Stephano was taking us when we happened to run into you, Mr. Poe."""|"The Reptile Room"|"Lemony Snicket"
