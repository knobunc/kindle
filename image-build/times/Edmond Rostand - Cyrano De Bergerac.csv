02:00|"two o’clock in the morning"|"A great deal of lore surrounds the premiere of Cyrano de Bergerac at the Theatre de la Porte-Saint-Martin in Paris on December 28, 1897. That just before the curtain went up, Rostand fell at the feet of leading actor Constant Coquelin and exclaimed: “Forgive me! Oh, forgive me, my friend, for having dragged you into this disastrous adventure!” That he then donned a costume and slipped onstage during the first act, causing surprise and confusion among the actors. That the first act was greeted with bravos, the following ones with standing ovations, and the final scene with forty-two curtain calls, so many that at two o’clock in the morning the exhausted stage manager simply left the curtain open and went home to bed."|"Cyrano De Bergerac"|"Edmond Rostand"
