"ap 01:00"|one|"Halsey Court, though
situated in Mayfair and entitled to put ‘London W.1’ after its name, is not a
fashionable locality. It is a small, dark, dingy cul-de-sac, far too full of
prowling cats, fluttering newspapers and derelict banana skins to attract the haut
monde. Dukes avoid it, marquises give it a wide berth, earls and viscounts
would not settle there if you paid them. It consists of some seedy offices and
a block of residential flats, Halsey Chambers, which are occupied mostly by
young men of slender means who cannot afford to pick and choose and are
thankful to have an inexpensive roof over their heads. Jeff Miller, the writer
of novels of suspense, lived there at one time; so did Jerry Shoe-smith, editor
until his services were dispensed with of the weekly paper Society Spice; and
now that they had married and gone elsewhere literature was represented by
Sandy Callender’s late betrothed, Samuel Galahad Bagshott."|"Galahad at Blandings"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"That
was what struck Sam immediately about Galahad Threepwood, that he looked
extraordinarily fit for his years. It was the impression Gally made on everyone
who met him. After the life he had led he had no right to burst with health,
but he did. Where most of his contemporaries had long ago thrown in the towel
and retired to cure resorts to nurse their gout, he had gone blithely on, ever
rising on stepping stones of dead whiskies and sodas to higher things. He had
discovered the prime grand secret of eternal youth — to keep the decanter
circulating, to stop smoking only when snapping the lighter for his next
cigarette and never to retire to rest before three in the morning."|"Galahad at Blandings"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
00:00|midnight|"‘I
expect so. She told me she was going to send them back.’ There was a world of
sympathy in the eye behind Gally’s monocle. As many people did, he had taken an
instant liking to this son of one with whom he had so often heard the chimes of
midnight, and he longed to do something to lighten his gloom. Years of
membership of the old Pelican Club, where somebody was always having trouble
with duns or bookies or women, had taught him how comforting it was to tell
your sad story to a compassionate listener."|"Galahad at Blandings"|"P. G. Wodehouse"

informed by Sandy Callender on the telephone the previous evening that he would
be calling for him shortly before one and it now being twelve fifty-four Lord
Emsworth was naturally astounded to see Gally. He was sitting in the lounge
when Gally reached Barribault’s Hotel, his long lean body draped like a wet
sock on a chair, and he appeared to be thinking of absolutely nothing. His mild
face wore the dazed look it always wore when he was in London, a city that
disturbed and bewildered him. Unlike his younger brother to whom it had always
been an earthly Paradise, he was allergic to England’s metropolis and counted
each minute lost that he was obliged to spend there. He rose like a snake
hurriedly uncoiling itself and his pince-nez flew from his nose and danced at
the end of their string, their invariable habit when he was startled."|"Galahad at Blandings"|"P. G. Wodehouse"

o’clock when Gally helped a still stupefied Lord Emsworth into the car,
adjusted his legs, which always tended to behave like the tentacles of an
octopus when he rode in any conveyance, and started on the homeward journey,
easing his way through the London traffic with practised skill. At five, Beach,
ably assisted by two footmen, served tea in the amber drawing-room of Blandings
Castle, and the company awaiting the wanderer’s return settled down to keep
body and soul together with buttered toast, cucumber sandwiches and cake. Lady
Hermione Wedge officiated at the tea pot. Colonel Egbert Wedge stood supporting
his shoulderblades against the mantelpiece over the fireplace. Dame Daphne
Winkworth sat very upright on what looked an uncomfortable chair and her son
Huxley perched on a footstool as near as he could get to the gate-leg table

possible, of avoiding Dame Daphne’s society. Hers, as Gally had said, was a
formidable personality. It had been so even in her youth, and many years of
conducting a large school for girls had increased its intensity, giving her an
imperious air calculated to intimidate all but the toughest. The thought that
before many weeks had passed he would become a member of her staff, permanently
under that eye of hers, never failed to induce in Wilfred a sinking feeling."|"Galahad at Blandings"|"P. G. Wodehouse"

"ap ~ 00:00"|"about twelve
o’clock"|"‘Crazy,’
said Colonel Wedge, continuing his remarks. ‘Let me tell you an incident that
happened when we were here a year or two ago. I came back late one night from a
Loyal Sons Of Shropshire dinner in London and went for a stroll in the grounds
to stretch my legs after the long train journey, and I was passing the
Empress’s sty when something I had taken for a suit of overalls hanging on the
rail suddenly reared itself up, and it was Clarence. Gave me no end of a start.
I asked him what he was doing there at that time of night — it was about twelve
o’clock —and he said he was listening to his pig. And what was the pig doing,
as I said to Hermione when I talked it over with her later? Singing? Reciting
Gunga Din? Not at all. It was just breathing and Clarence was listening to it —
courting lumbago, as I told him.’"|"Galahad at Blandings"|"P. G. Wodehouse"

had been a frown on Lady Hermione’s face as this anecdote proceeded. She was
not pleased with her husband for telling a story which might well make Lord
Emsworth’s destined bride dubious as to the advisability of linking her lot
with a man who went out at midnight to listen to pigs breathing. It seemed to
her that Dame Daphne was pursing her lips as she might have pursed them in her
study at school, had she been informed by an undermistress that Angela and
Phyllis had been found smoking cigarettes behind the gymnasium."|"Galahad at Blandings"|"P. G. Wodehouse"

from the London train and stepped into the car which Voules the chauffeur had
brought to Market Blandings station to meet her. Sandy Callender, who had
travelled by the same train but in a humbler compartment at the other end of
it, boarded the station taxi cab (Jno. Robinson, prop’r). And simultaneously
Constable Evans of the local police force, mounting the bicycle which had now
been restored to him, started to pedal castlewards to give Beach his watch."|"Galahad at Blandings"|"P. G. Wodehouse"

cheer the poor chap up. For several days he had been brooding on something, I
forget what, and Puffy and I talked it over and decided that something must be
done to take him out of himself He needs fresh interests, I said to Puffy. So
we coated a pig liberally with phosphorus and left it at his bedside at about
two in the morning. We then beat the gong. The results were excellent. It
roused him from his despondency in a flash and gave him all the fresh interests
he could do with. But the point I’m making is that it was years after that
before he could see a pig without a shudder. He took the same jaundiced view of
them that Sam has taken of potting sheds. And Plug was an even tougher specimen
than Sam. Curious. Oh, hullo, Beach.’"|"Galahad at Blandings"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
