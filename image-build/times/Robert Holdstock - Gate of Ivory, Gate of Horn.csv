I had stayed in the village, sleeping on a couch at the crowded local hotel, but woke at six, made tea, then gratefully accepted a lift on a passing truck as far as Ryhope Manor. The main pathways on the estate had already been swept clear of snow, right down to the farm, and from there I followed the tracks of the tractors that had been out at dawn with hay for the animals."|"Gate of Ivory, Gate of Horn"|"Robert Holdstock"

At midnight they released each other and prowled the glade, pulling back the trees, prodding at the bushes, calling in their strange tongue. I cowered back as Cernunnos leaned towards me, gape-mouthed and slack-eyed, but the monstrous horned head moved away. It hadn’t seen me."|"Gate of Ivory, Gate of Horn"|"Robert Holdstock"

Kylhuk and Someone stepped quickly into the space before the gorge, armoured and smiling, Kylhuk in battle kilt and torques, daggers strapped to each thigh and each forearm, Someone in a purple cloak, his hair meticulously shaped above his crown, his whole bearing prouder and more magnificent than I had ever seen him."|"Gate of Ivory, Gate of Horn"|"Robert Holdstock"
