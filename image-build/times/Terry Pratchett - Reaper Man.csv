“Half past nine,” said Windle, promptly if indistinctly.
“Well, that’s nice,” said the Bursar. “It gives you the rest of the evening, er, free.”"|"Reaper Man"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 09:15"|"quarter past nine"|"It was one of the new-fangled pocket watches, with hands. They pointed to a quarter past nine. He shook it. A small hatch opened under the 12 and a very small demon poked its head out and said, “Knock it off, guv’nor, I’m pedalling as fast as I can.”"|"Reaper Man"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 09:20"|"twenty minutes past nine"|"The Bursar looked surreptitiously at his watch. It was now twenty minutes past nine."|"Reaper Man"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 09:29"|"nine twenty-nine"|"“Can you knock it off with all this shaking around?” squeaked the demon. “I keeps on losing count.”
“Sorry,” the Bursar hissed. It was nine twenty-nine.
The Archchancellor stepped forward."|"Reaper Man"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 09:30"|"Half past nine"|"“What?” said the Bursar, jolted.
“Half past nine,” said the demon.
The wizards turned to Windle Poons. They looked faintly accusing."|"Reaper Man"|"Terry Pratchett"
05:00|"five in the morning"|"There was just too much of him, for one thing. It wasn’t that he was particularly big, it was just that he had the kind of huge personality that fits any available space. He’d get roaring drunk at supper and that was fine and acceptable wizardly behavior. But then he’d go back to his room and play darts all night long and leave at five in the morning to go duck hunting. He shouted at people. He tried to jolly them along. And he hardly ever wore proper robes. He’d persuaded Mrs. Whitlow, the University’s dreaded housekeeper, to make him a sort of baggy trouser suit in garish blue and red; twice a day the wizards stood in bemusement and watched him jog purposefully around the University buildings, his pointy wizarding hat tied firmly on his head with string. He’d shout cheerfully up at them, because fundamental to the make-up of people like Mustrum Ridcully is an iron belief that everyone else would like it, too, if only they tried it."|"Reaper Man"|"Terry Pratchett"

In cities like Ankh-Morpork midnight was just late evening, because there was no civic night at all, just evenings fading into dawns. But here people regulated their lives by things like sunsets and mispronounced cock-crows. Midnight meant what it said."|"Reaper Man"|"Terry Pratchett"
12:00|midday|"Even with the storm stalking the hills, the square itself was hushed. The ticking of the clock in its tower, unnoticable at midday, now seemed to echo off the buildings."|"Reaper Man"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"Above him, the hands of midnight came together. There was a whirring from the clock. The door opened. The automata marched out. They clicked to a halt on either side of the hour bell, bowed to one another, and raised their hammers."|"Reaper Man"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"He walked over to Miss Flitworth and gently pressed her hands together. The image of the lifetimer disappeared. The blue-and-violet fog on the edge of sight faded as solid reality flowed back.
Down in the town, the clock finished striking midnight.
The old woman was shivering. Death snapped his fingers in front of her eyes."|"Reaper Man"|"Terry Pratchett"
