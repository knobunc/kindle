next.  At five-fifteen, Scott Walker phoned from the CIA vehicle at the

and Leslie acknowledged each other with mutual glances and slightly

nodding heads.  At twelve minutes past six, Albert Whitehead jvalked

through Templars’ double doors and headed straight for the banquette

nodded as Pryce unobtrusively glanced at the banquette and Whitehead.

the broker’s table, startling Whitehead as he slid into the small

taken to the hospital, the detail to accompany him.  Somewhere between

here and the emergency entrance, no more than twelve minutes, he

regained consciousness, and to my utter astonishment, he overcame two
