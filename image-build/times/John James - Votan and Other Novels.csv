There was no body alive or dead, burnt or unburnt. Where Joy was I did not know."|"Votan and Other Novels"|"John James"
12:00|noon|"After the first few days we didn’t pass many houses. When I came back that way I began to realise how skilfully Occa had planned his march to take us out of people’s sight and earshot. Usually we rose at dawn and rode off at once. We would stop at noon and rest the horses and eat, and after an hour or two set off again till sunset. We had dried meat and twice-baked bread with us. Once or twice Occa went off with his bow and got a deer, though it was really out of the season, and we called at farms and bartered the meat and hide for carrots and cabbages that had been stored through the winter."|"Votan and Other Novels"|"John James"
"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"Then one day about noon we were making along a forest path when there came out of the scrub two horsemen, poor men, in rags, riding on blankets, one red and blue check, the other no particular colour except dirty. They stopped by the side of the path, and watched us as we went by. They were poor. They had no swords, but they carried the long spears of the country, and on their shields the eye of love, or of piety, might make out the shape of a cat. They watched us pass, and we looked them over as we went by, but none of us spoke. Two spears would not fight with three, that was common sense."|"Votan and Other Novels"|"John James"
"< 12:00"|"Toward noon"|"Apollo brought the dawn as I hung in my chain. I moistened my lips as the sun came up, and I wished I could risk eating again, but the sausage was salty and my water would last three days at most with great care. Toward noon, Apollo sent a sign. The cloud came over and there was a thunderstorm. My clothes were soaked, I drank the water that poured through my hair. I licked the water from the leaves and I ate. There was a hollow in the tree just in front of me that filled with water and I could just reach it, straining against the chain."|"Votan and Other Novels"|"John James"
12:00|noon|"Out of that glare of fire I woke to the glare of noon. The men came, and I could not speak to them. They came to the very foot of the tree, and before my dry eyes they poured out cool, clear, bitter beer at the roots. Then they too were gone."|"Votan and Other Novels"|"John James"
"~ 12:00"|"About noon"|"It was a bad day to start across the Heath. When I cast my spear into the eye of the sun, I had to guess where the sun might be, for the mist covered everything. You couldn’t see far, and you couldn’t make much speed. I wrapped my cloak around me and I made south-west as far as I could guess. About noon the sun began to break through, and I could see the kind of place I was in."|"Votan and Other Novels"|"John James"

12:00|noon|"For the night we tied ourselves to the thwarts, for the boat was rolling and pitching together in a most unpleasant spiral motion. Some of the Saxons were sick. At dawn we had water and dried meat, and at noon we had water and some fish we had caught, raw. During the nights we were kept awake all the time by men clambering over us to relieve the steersmen and to hold us end on, any end on, to the howling wind that blew out of nowhere. Yet no one suggested offering a sacrifice of what we had to Wude."|"Votan and Other Novels"|"John James"
"< 12:00"|"Toward noon"|"Toward noon on the third day we saw land, quite close, for the boat was very low in the water. It was a low green shore, with two or three strange green hills like upturned buckets, and an island a little offshore of the same shape. There was more land visible to starboard. We were in the mouth of a river. Suddenly the wind dropped, stopped, just like that. The Saxons left off arguing whether we were off Britain or Ireland or the Land of Norroway, and with one accord began to row for the nearer shore. I said nothing; I was sure our troubles weren’t over."|"Votan and Other Novels"|"John James"

Last I heard of him, I told them, he’d been commanding a regiment of cavalry at Carnuntum."|"Votan and Other Novels"|"John James"
12:00|noonday|"Gwawl was a long time in coming. I went back into the ship, and I looked at Bonnonia. The full round moon flooded the shore with a bright pale light, so that the patches of shadow were as dark as a bottomless pit. I thought that it was like the good hard noonday sun of the South, that has no half measures. Either a thing is in the dark and cannot be known, or it is out in the pitless light and cannot be hidden. I sat on the bulwark with my legs dangling and looked at Gaul, a familiar land of wine and olive, where everything was what it was, where a mule-driver was a mule-driver and a pirate was a pirate, and a slave girl only a slave girl. That was the last I knew for many a day of clarity and single-mindedness and fixity of meaning. For the wind was right for the misty island of Britain."|"Votan and Other Novels"|"John James"

Leo promised that I should have at least one quiet empty day, and the following day again he would invite some of his trading colleagues to meet me, as probably the most influential and wealthy visitor to Londinium for some years. However, just as I woke, half-way between dawn and noon on that first day, Leo came into my bedroom and announced:"|"Votan and Other Novels"|"John James"
"<< 12:00"|"Long before noon"|"They sold like water in a city under siege. Long before noon we had sold almost all our stock, and I was already beginning to reckon up my profit – I estimated that I had made three pairs for less than one denarius. All kinds of people had come to buy, first the market people themselves, and then farmers and their wives, and our greatest sale had, as always, been among the local lads buying what they hoped would get their girls into the long grass with them. But then as I looked at my last pair, a different customer arrived. There was a sudden thinning out of the crowd in front of me, leaving a space, and as I looked it was covered with a swarm of sparrows, hopping about and quarrelling for the crumbs and the grains of oats they found in the horse-droppings. And as I looked down, there appeared among the birds the feet of a Lady. It was feet and shoes I was looking at that day, and by the shoes this was a great Lady, the litter trade if ever I saw it. They were fine and dainty feet, and that was real Spanish leather that covered them, and dyed it was in a dye that would stand up to all the weather of the world. Dressed she was like a woman of the country. Not like the women of Pontes, who wanted to show how sophisticated they were and walked Roman fashion in tunics with a pallium to throw over their shoulders if the weather required it, which it always does up there."|"Votan and Other Novels"|"John James"
12:00|noon|"We set Taliesin to dyeing the leather, while Pryderi and I cut it out with our shoemakers’ knives and stretched it on the frames and stitched it. By noon, all the frames were covered and the leather was drying. We ate a light midday meal of a sucking pig between us, and then I told the others that I would work on a sample. I took a blue shield, the same beautiful heavenly blue as the shoes, and I made up dyes and colours from the variety of substances I carried in my bag."|"Votan and Other Novels"|"John James"

I had not dreamed in Calleva, and that is why I know that nothing will ever happen there, but in Londinium I had dreamed of fire, and here on the road to Sulis I dreamed of battle. I remember a little. All through a day, I dreamed, we had stood against an army that came at us from the East, and towards evening they had fallen back, exhausted, and left us holding the field. And yet at that moment, a new army came at us from the West, along the road, and though they were as many as we were, yet we laughed, because they were too late. And I woke from that jumble of weary men and dead horses to find the dawn breaking bright and clear on a fine day for sitting by the roadside and selling whatever we wanted."|"Votan and Other Novels"|"John James"

The cloud got lower as the morning wore on. The girl who sold us the oatcake was looking anxiously at the first few drops showing on the flagstone at her door, and awaiting the rush home from the fields. By the time we reached the inn, three hours after noon, the rain was falling steadily in a monotonous drizzle, not heavily, but thoroughly. I was tolerably dry myself, because I put on my sealskin cloak, and that shed the water like – well, have you ever seen a seal? The other two had their soft leather jerkins, but all the same we were all glad to get indoors."|"Votan and Other Novels"|"John James"
">> 12:00"|"Well after noon"|"When we cleared the north edge of the Apple Hills, we could see the edge of the Lead Hills east of us, like a long cliff, and the column of smoke from the Mines, but only when we came, as sometimes we did, out of the patches of willow and alder that stood up out of the waters. Well after noon I was ready to refuse to go any farther, and the only thing that gave me any hope was the strong smell of the salt sea."|"Votan and Other Novels"|"John James"
12:00|noon|"We crunched across the icy surface of the snow, watching our breaths before our faces. Then, into the marsh. We pushed by willows, and the icy twigs cut across our faces like iron wires. The log road beneath our feet was covered in a layer of glass, and I feared to slip and tear my side again. The streams and pools were edged with ice, but never fully covered in, or strong enough to take a man’s weight. Most of the paths we had used to come from the Glass Mountain were under running water, and we had to take awkward twisting ways, known only to the cattle and the deer, and the badger even, who made them. To push through a maze in twilight, with never a firm footing, with nothing dry, with the clouds threatening new snow, oh, there are better ways of spending a day in midwinter. Even when, at noon, the clouds cleared, it became no pleasanter, because it got even colder."|"Votan and Other Novels"|"John James"

Others looked too. Everywhere, men and women were getting up, and looking towards the farmyard. There was a smell in the air, a smell of anticipation, of excitement, as strong as woodsmoke, as distinctive as a mask. Pryderi stood, and I stood too. There was a sound of rattling at the gate. Everybody heard it. Now nobody was seated. We stood, Pryderi and I, in the very front of the crowd, and we saw the gate open."|"Votan and Other Novels"|"John James"

Therefore they feast to cheer themselves for the long vigils ahead, waking in the cold lambing shed. Now on this last night of freedom from care they drink and sing in every village throughout the land. If ever we are to expect rebellion, it is on such a night, when men are drunk and tempers are hot. Therefore, it being a feast of the Brits, the Legion stands at its post, every centurion watching throughout the night, neither any soldier venturing out where he might cause offence and begin a riot. For from a riot may begin a war. On this night, brothers, let us watch, being armed, all through the night, knowing that our comrades of the Sixth and Twentieth watch also. Therefore we sit here together, ready to take our places on the parade ground, with the Standard-bearers and the trumpeters at the door.’"|"Votan and Other Novels"|"John James"

So get drunk they did, all of them, before midnight. I went to the Setanta, who was still sober enough to speak, and I suggested that he should get a line of pickets out, in case the High King tried to rush us in the dark. He laughed at me. The Irish never do such things, he told me. They have no sense of prudence at all. Now you or I, if we had an enemy, would have used some intelligence when he left himself vulnerable, would ambush him with a knife in the dark, or put an arrow in his back in a narrow way, or burn his house over his head – or safer, when he was out of it. But the Irish believe in meeting their foes face to face. No, said the Setanta, there was no need to be afraid of anything."|"Votan and Other Novels"|"John James"

We heard a horn blow, Gwanar’s horn, I knew, who had succeeded Precent at the gate. It was noon, Mynydog would be sitting on his Mound of Judgement, before the gate of the Dun. Now any of his people, any free man of the Isle of Britain, could come to him where he sat with Clydno his Judge by his side to tell him what was true law and what was not. Every day he sat, like every King, to hear complaints of one man against another, or against the King, and do justice, in the Roman manner."|"Votan and Other Novels"|"John James"

In the middle of the day, with four hours riding behind you, and another four hours ahead, there is nothing to keep your heart up like a slab of cold roast mutton, with the crisp white fat in it, firmly breaking between your teeth. They were wonderful days, that summer. We would sit out in the noon sun to eat, the hobbled horses grazing around us. We lay on our backs, and watched the high clouds over us. We played ‘She loves me – she loves me not’ with the daisy flowers, and blew dandelion fluff into other men’s faces, and covered our friends’ backs with the bared seedheads of the grass. We would practise the songs we knew, and dance, men with men, the dances of every Kingdom in the Island of Britain. For songs are the same everywhere, since we speak the same language, from Wick to Cornwall, but every Kingdom has its own dances."|"Votan and Other Novels"|"John James"

A meal we got out of it, a snack rather, for the noon halt, for a young ox, half starved, and three little pigs fed no better will hardly give a mouthful between fifty men. And we got out of it some iron, and the hide of the ox would cover a shield for someone, and the pigskin would give a pair of shoes for riding. And there was enough tallow for a night’s candles in Mynydog’s Hall, and clothes to give away to the farmers we passed on the way back. And best of all, the Savages were gone with the ebb, drowned, or burnt before, and not to come in again till the next high tide. But by then we would be gone, too, dancing around the fires in a farmyard, and flirting with the girls for whose safety we had gone to war. We at least left the beach clear, the ashes buried, the sand swept over all."|"Votan and Other Novels"|"John James"

Mail is too heavy to wear without cause, unless you are fighting or on parade. Our helmets we could sling at our saddles. While our horses cropped the grass, we filled the helms with the ripening whinberries: the blackberries were still red."|"Votan and Other Novels"|"John James"

They would awake, and without a word would form up as if to advance, and, instead, would march the other way, into the North.

We might easily have made Eudav’s Hall before the evening, but a little after noon, the flank guard on the right sighted a whole herd of deer, and a squadron went off on to the hunt. They cast round up-wind of them, and drove the whole herd down on to our spears. We singled out twenty-six fat bucks, and that was enough for the Household: the rest we let run against next time some Roman felt hungry. It is only a Savage who kills except to eat at once."|"Votan and Other Novels"|"John James"
12:00|noon|"The skies were grey and clouded early in the day. By noon, however, when the Wall was far behind, there was only blue above, and the sun in our eyes. We all rode armed, now, of course; we were ready to fight. Our flank scouts were half a mile to either side of the road we followed, looking for prey, like the booths of shepherds. As I had told Owain, they did not find any. Savages do not keep many sheep, and only for the wool: instead of lads, they have grown men, who follow the flock on foot and keep them in sight of the farm all day. But what was strange was that we caught none of the usual bands of straggling Savages, bound one way or another across the hills to beg and scavenge on the West coast. At this time of the year, we ought to have caught scores of them going back for the wheat harvest. But there were none, as if, for some reason, they had all rushed home already."|"Votan and Other Novels"|"John James"

Before night I saw smoke, and I came to a hut of boughs. There I slept, as I had so often in my youth, and I had men of my own race, who spoke my own tongue, to look after me. I had returned from Cattraeth."|"Votan and Other Novels"|"John James"
