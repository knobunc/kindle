00:32|"12:32 A.M."|"Dazed, Langdon looked at the bedside clock. It was 12:32 A.M. He had been asleep only an hour, but he felt like the dead."|"The Da Vinci Code"|"Dan Brown"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"“My capitaine requires your expertise in a private matter.”
“Now?” Langdon managed. “It's after midnight.”
“Am I correct that you were scheduled to meet with the curator of the Louvre this evening?”"|"The Da Vinci Code"|"Dan Brown"
"ap 01:00"|"one o'clock"|"“Sister, I agree, and yet I would consider it a personal favor if you could let him in tonight. He can be there at . . . say one o'clock? That's in twenty minutes.”"|"The Da Vinci Code"|"Dan Brown"
"ap ~ 10:30"|"about ten-thirty"|"“Fache already did. His report shows you retrieving your room key from the concierge at about ten-thirty. Unfortunately, the time of the murder was closer to eleven. You easily could have left your hotel room unseen.”"|"The Da Vinci Code"|"Dan Brown"
"ap > 10:00"|"just after ten o'clock"|"Grinning, Sophie ran out to the garage. Sure enough, his car was gone. It was the weekend. Jacques Saunière despised city driving and owned a car for one destination only—his vacation château in Normandy, north of Paris. Sophie, after months in the congestion of London, was eager for the smells of nature and to start her vacation right away. It was still early evening, and she decided to leave immediately and surprise him. Borrowing a friend's car, Sophie drove north, winding into the deserted moon-swept hills near Creully. She arrived just after ten o'clock, turning down the long private driveway toward her grandfather's retreat. The access road was over a mile long, and she was halfway down it before she could start to see the house through the trees—a mammoth, old stone château nestled in the woods on the side of a hill."|"The Da Vinci Code"|"Dan Brown"
02:51|"2:51 A.M."|"Langdon made no response. Trust had not gotten him very far this evening. Pulling back the sleeve of his jacket, he checked his watch—a vintage, collector's-edition Mickey Mouse wristwatch that had been a gift from his parents on his tenth birthday. Although its juvenile dial often drew odd looks, Langdon had never owned any other watch; Disney animations had been his first introduction to the magic of form and color, and Mickey now served as Langdon's daily reminder to stay young at heart. At the moment, however, Mickey's arms were skewed at an awkward angle, indicating an equally awkward hour.
2:51 A.M.
“Interesting watch,” Sophie said, glancing at his wrist and maneuvering the SmartCar around the wide, counterclockwise rotary."|"The Da Vinci Code"|"Dan Brown"
"ap 03:06"|3:06|"Sophie raised her eyes to the enormous departure board overhead. The black and white tabs reshuffled, ruffling downward as the information refreshed. When the update was finished, Langdon eyed the offerings. The topmost listing read:
LYON—RAPIDE—3:06
“I wish it left sooner,” Sophie said, “but Lyon will have to do.”"|"The Da Vinci Code"|"Dan Brown"
02:59|"2:59 A.M."|"Sooner? Langdon checked his watch 2:59 A.M. The train left in seven minutes and they didn't even have tickets yet."|"The Da Vinci Code"|"Dan Brown"
"ap ~ 06:30"|"around six-thirty"|"The controller fumbled through his records. “It's a short flight. His plane could be on the ground by . . . around six-thirty. Fifteen minutes from now.”"|"The Da Vinci Code"|"Dan Brown"
"ap < 07:30"|"almost seven-thirty"|"Langdon's 
Mickey Mouse wristwatch read almost seven-thirty when he emerged from the Jaguar limousine onto Inner Temple Lane with Sophie and Teabing. The threesome wound through a maze of buildings to a small courtyard outside the Temple Church. The rough-hewn stone shimmered in the rain, and doves cooed in the architecture overhead."|"The Da Vinci Code"|"Dan Brown"
"ap 09:30"|nine-thirty|"Inside the church, an altar boy was almost finished vacuuming the communion kneelers when he heard a knocking on the sanctuary door. He ignored it. Father Harvey Knowles had his own keys and was not due for another couple of hours. The knocking was probably a curious tourist or indigent. The altar boy kept vacuuming, but the knocking continued. Can't you read? The sign on the door clearly stated that the church did not open until nine-thirty on Saturday. The altar boy remained with his chores."|"The Da Vinci Code"|"Dan Brown"
"ap 09:30"|nine-thirty|"Suddenly, the knocking turned to a forceful banging, as if someone were hitting the door with a metal rod. The young man switched off his vacuum cleaner and marched angrily toward the door. Unlatching it from within, he swung it open. Three people stood in the entryway. Tourists, he grumbled. “We open at nine-thirty.”"|"The Da Vinci Code"|"Dan Brown"
"ap 09:30"|nine-thirty|"The altar boy had been here a couple of years but had never heard of this custom. “It would be better if you waited until nine-thirty. The church isn't open yet, and I'm not finished hoovering.”"|"The Da Vinci Code"|"Dan Brown"
"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"Fache strode to the back of the plane and poured himself a hard drink. It was early, but he had not yet slept, so this hardly counted as drinking before noon. Sitting in a plush bucket seat, he closed his eyes, trying to sort out what was going on. The Kent police's blunder could cost me dearly. Everyone was now on the lookout for a black Jaguar limousine."|"The Da Vinci Code"|"Dan Brown"
22:46|"10:46 P.M."|"Louvre Museum, Paris
10:46 P.M.
Renowned curator Jacques Saunière staggered through the vaulted archway of the museum's Grand Gallery. He lunged for the nearest painting he could see, a Caravaggio. Grabbing the gilded frame, the seventy-six-year-old man heaved the masterpiece toward himself until it tore from the wall and Saunière collapsed backward in a heap beneath the canvas."|"The Da Vinci Code"|"Dan Brown"
