         sometimes simply ‘the Poet,’ lay outside on the deck, bare-chested, moderately overweight, in a partially reclined deck chair,
         in the sun, reading, half supine, moderately but not severely overweight, winner of two National Book Awards, a National Book
         Critics Circle Award, a Lamont Prize, two grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, a Prix de Rome, a Lannan Foundation

         now fifty-six, lying in an unwet XL Speedo-brand swimsuit in an incrementally reclinable canvas deck chair on the tile deck
         beside the home’s pool, a poet who was among the first ten Americans to receive a ‘Genius Grant’ from the prestigious John
         D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, one of only three American recipients of the Nobel Prize for Literature now living,
         5'8'', 181 lbs., brown/brown, hairline unevenly recessed because of the inconsistent acceptance/rejection of various Hair

          on the pool’s tile deck, in a portable deck chair whose back was now reclined four clicks to an angle of 35° w/r/t the deck’s
         mosaic tile, at 10:20 A.M. on 15 May 1995, the fourth most anthologized poet in the history of American belles lettres, near an umbrella but not in
         the actual shade of the umbrella, reading Newsweek magazine,
         
            2
         
          using the modest swell of his abdomen as an angled support for the magazine, also wearing thongs, one hand behind his head,
         the other hand out to the side and trailing on the dun-and-ochre filigree of the deck’s expensive Spanish ceramic tile, occasionally
         wetting a finger to turn the page, wearing prescription sunglasses whose lenses were chemically treated to darken in fractional
         proportion to the luminous intensity of the light to which they were exposed, wearing on the trailing hand a wristwatch of
         middling quality and expense, simulated-rubber thongs on his feet, legs crossed at the ankle and knees slightly spread, the
         sky cloudless and brightening as the morning’s sun moved up and right, wetting a finger not with saliva or perspiration but
         with the condensation on the slender frosted glass of iced tea that rested now just on the border of his body’s shadow to
         the chair’s upper left and would have to be moved to remain in that cool shadow, tracing a finger idly down the glass’s side
         before bringing the moist finger idly up to the page, occasionally turning the pages of the 19 September 1994 edition of Newsweek magazine, reading about American health-care reform and about USAir’s tragic Flight 427, reading a summary and favorable
         review of the popular nonfiction volumes Hot Zone and The Coming Plague, sometimes turning several pages in succession, skimming certain articles and summaries, an eminent American poet now four
         months short of his fifty-seventh birthday, a poet whom Newsweek magazine’s chief competitor, Time, had once rather absurdly called ‘the closest thing to a genuine literary immortal now living,’ his shins nearly hairless,
         the open umbrella’s elliptic shadow tightening slightly, the thongs’ simulated rubber pebbled on both sides of the sole, the
         poet’s forehead dotted with perspiration, his tan deep and rich, the insides of his upper legs nearly hairless, his penis
         curled tightly on itself inside the tight swimsuit, his Vandyke neatly trimmed, an ashtray on the iron table, not drinking
         his iced tea, occasionally clearing his throat, at intervals shifting slightly in the pastel deck chair to scratch idly at
         the instep of one foot with the big toe of the other foot without removing his thongs or looking at either foot, seemingly
         intent on the magazine, the blue pool to his right and the home’s thick glass sliding rear door to his oblique left, between
         himself and the pool a round table of white woven iron impaled at the center by a large beach umbrella whose shadow now no
         longer touches the pool, an indisputably accomplished poet, reading his magazine in his chair on his deck by his pool behind
         his home. The home’s pool and deck area is surrounded on three sides by trees and shrubbery. The trees and shrubbery, installed
         years before, are densely interwoven and tangled and serve the same essential function as a redwood privacy fence or a wall
         of fine stone. It is the height of spring, and the trees and shrubbery are in full leaf and are intensely green and still,
         and are complexly shadowed, and the sky is wholly blue and still, so that the whole enclosed tableau of pool and deck and
         poet and chair and table and trees and home’s rear façade is very still and composed and very nearly wholly silent, the soft
         gurgle of the pool’s pump and drain and the occasional sound of the poet clearing his throat or turning the pages of Newsweek magazine the only sounds—not a bird, no distant lawn mowers or hedge trimmers or weed-eating devices, no jets overhead or
         distant muffled sounds from the pools of the homes on either side of the poet’s home—nothing but the pool’s respiration and
         poet’s occasional cleared throat, wholly still and composed and enclosed, not even a hint of a breeze to stir the leaves of
         the trees and shrubbery, the silent living enclosing flora’s motionless green vivid and inescapable and not like anything
         else in the world in either appearance or suggestion.

12:00|noon|"Galvanic crisis notwithstanding, Jeni Roberts felt awkward and very nearly mortified with embarrassment as she and the ex-lover
         met and selected their meal options and sat down together in a windowside booth of molded plastic and made radically incongruous
         small talk while she prepared to try to ask the question that would accidentally precipitate her epiphany and a whole new
         less innocent and self-deluded stage of her married life. She had decaf in a disposable cup and put in six prepackaged creamers
         as her former sexual partner sat with his entree’s styrofoam box unopened and gazed both through the window and at her. He
         had a ring on his pinkiefinger and his sportcoat was unbuttoned, and the white shirt beneath the coat bore the distinctive
         furrows of an oxfordcloth dress shirt that had only recently been removed from its retail packaging. The sunlight through
         the big window was noon-colored and made the crowded franchise feel like a greenhouse; it was hard to breathe. The associate
         sales manager watched as she started the tops of the creamers with her teeth to safeguard her nails and removed them and placed
         them in the foil ashtray and dumped the thimblefuls of creamer into the disposable cup and stirred them in with a complimentary
         square-tipped stirrer one after another, the look in his developmentally appropriate eye the puddly look of nostalgia. She
         was still profligate with the creamer. She had both a wedding band and a diamond engagement ring, and the rock wasn’t cheap
         by a long shot. The former lover’s stomach hurt and eye-flesh ticced especially bad now because of how now they were in the
         dreaded last three bank days of the month and Mad Mike’s Hyundai put unbelievable pressure on reps to move units in the last
         three days so they could go on that month’s books and inflate the books for the clowns in the regional office. The young wife
         cleared her throat several times in her special way that the man solely responsible for the performance of all Mad Mike’s
         reps remembered all too well, doing the dry nervous thing with her throat to communicate the fact that she recognized how
         inappropriate a question like this was going to appear now at this juncture, with them with their unhappy history and now
         no longer in any way even like marginally connected, and her happily married, and that she felt embarrassed but was also in
         some kind of she was saying genuine inner-crisis-type situation about something, and desperate—the way usually only serious
         credit problems made people look desperate and trapped like this—with her eyes with that drowning look in them of she was
         begging him not to take advantage of her desperate position in any way including judgment or ridicule at her expense. Plus
         and how she always drank her coffee with two hands around the cup even in a hot environs like this one here. Hyundai-U.S.’s
         volume, margins, and financing terms were among the countless economic conditions affected by fluctuations in the value of
         the yen and related Pacific currencies. The young wife had spent an hour at the mirror in order to choose the shapeless blouse
         and slacks she wore, actually taking her soft contacts back out in order to wear her glasses as well, and nothing on her face
         in the windowlight but a quick dab-and-blot of gloss. The expressway’s heavy flow glittered through the window that lit up
         her right side with sun; and through the glass the Mad Mike’s lot, with its plastic pennants and a man in a wheelchair with
         his wife or like nurse getting worked by fat Kidder in the hospital gown and arrow-through-head-prosthesis the reps all had
         to wear on the days Messerly was there to keep tabs, lay also within the divided purview of the booth’s former lover—who still
         loved her, Jeni Ann Orzolek of Marketing 204, and not his current fiancée, he realized with the sickening wince of a mortal
         wound reopened—and just beyond it, shimmering in the heat, the Adult World lot, with its all makes and classes of vehicle
         day and night, moving them through like Mad Mike Messerly could only fantasize."|"Brief Interviews With Hideous Men"|"David Foster Wallace"

         dethroned, parachuted, & highly vengeance-oriented Reggie Ecko of Venice, who’d suffered a massive self-esteem-displacement
         & had sold his house & tank of pedigreed carp & moved into a freebase fleabag in an infamous Venetian residency hotel known
         along the boardwalk as The Temple of Very Short Prayers, & was now spending all his time & contract settlement hitting the
         alkaloid pipe & drinking Crown Royal right out of the velvet bag & throwing darts at 8 × 10s of Agon M. Nar & watching incredibly
         massive amounts of late-night syndicated television, gnashing his increasingly discolored teeth &, like, totally embittered.
         A covertly active strategy went into effect. While the demiurge Erythema began to appear to Reggie Ecko in the mortal guise
         of Robert Vaughan hosting Hair Loss Update every night from 4 to 5 A.M. on Channel 13, & to work on him, Codependae herself began work on the heart, mind, & cojones of Agon M. Nar, insinuating

"ap 04:00"|4|"This inspiration—the thesis Nar thought was his own, mortally, on awakening—appeared as inevitable as his Enhanced Love-Dumpling
         daughter’s own part in it. Now, Telephemus Studios & Tri-Stan Entertainment, consulting the cassocked vestals at the Oracle
         of Nielsen, God of Life Itself, were much vexed by the nascent spread of Cable Television & the geometric expansion of grainy
         syndication’s eternal return. Turner & ESP’s Network & Chicago’s Super 9 were then in utero. The industry was abuzz. It was

         & in the very air. The siren sings to Nar of oracular foresight, making the pitch with charts & pointer: Cable offers nothing
         new or improved & dies on the vine as hyperborean MHz TV expands to even the weeest of wee hours via black-and-white recycling.
         & not just recycled Hazel or I Married Joan, no, the callid & thrice-disguised C. did sing of the Ultimate Rerun, 100% echo: myth, classic & Classical myth: rich, ambiguous, archetypal, cosmological, polyvalent, susceptible of neverending renewal, ever fresh. The high-alto dreamsong
         was complex & mostly C#. Covert seeds were thus sowed by A.M.N.’s nightshade: a moebioid ticker-like loop that became its own REM mantra: ENDYMION PYRAMUS PHAETON MARPESSA EURYDICE LINUS

05:00|"5 A.M."|"Codependae then elects to afflict Agon M. Nar with the following dream. A.M.N.’s Pac 10 daughters Leigh & Coleptic are being held hostage by some extremely serious militant CA Hispanics who threaten
         to hang them by their own lustrous locks if Nar doesn’t complete the single telemarketing labor they demand: he is to find
         a hypnotic avatar of the ancient-Greek Narcissus & air him, i.e. broadcast his irresistible image over & over, in order to
         entrance the Anglos of medieval CA into the glazed narcosis that will make them easy pickings for lean hungry barbarians from
         the Latin south. Their voices on Nar’s cellular are highalto. Agon M. goes as usual to seek counsel at Tri-Stan’s videonic
         HQ, but the three antique Stans can’t concentrate on his trouble: they have only one of everything among them, & when two
         or more of them have to visit the exec washroom at the same time there’s always a hell of a row about time & trade, & A. Nar,
         in that aphasiac frustration so common to nightmares, can’t make himself heard through the Empedoclean squabble over porcelain
         & part. Finally a mysterious pockmarked Hispanic custodian does that psst thing from the doorway—without context or explanation, he informs Nar that he has consulted the Oracle of Stasis & that the
         ortolan-entrails have Foretold that Agon M. Nar will never be able in time to find a qualified male Narcissus II (no modern
         man, even in the much-Enhanced fluorescent basin, being divine-looking enough to hold the rapt gaze of demographic millions),
         but that a bona fide female Narcissus-grade object will, ironically, be found by Nar no farther away than his own neocolonial home’s bassinet or the

         smell, like the other smell, connects with a chemical haze inside you, an interior dimness that bends light to its own ends,
         softens the difference between what leaves off and what begins."|"Brief Interviews With Hideous Men"|"David Foster Wallace"
16:00|"4:00 in the afternoon"|"As in all those other dreams, I’m with somebody I know but don’t know how I know them, and now this person suddenly points
         out to me that I’m blind. As in literally blind, unsighted, etc. Or else it’s in the presence of this person that I suddenly
         realize I’m blind. What happens when I realize this is I get sad. It makes me incredibly sad that I’m blind. The person somehow
         knows how sad I am and warns me that crying will hurt my eyes somehow and make the blindness even worse, but I can’t help
         it. I sit down and start crying really hard. I wake crying in bed, and I’m crying so hard I can’t really see anything or make
         anything out or anything. This makes me cry even harder. My girlfriend is concerned and wakes up and asks what’s the matter,
         and it’s a minute or more before I can even get it together enough to realize that I was dreaming and I’m awake and not really
         blind and that I’m crying for no reason, then to tell my girlfriend about the dream and get her input on it. Then all day
         at work then I’m incredibly conscious of my eyesight and my eyes and how good it is to be able to see colors and people’s
         faces and to know exactly where I am, and of how fragile it all is, the human eye mechanism and the ability to see, how easily
         it could be lost, how I’m always seeing blind people around with their canes and strange-looking faces and am always just
         thinking of them as interesting to spend a couple seconds looking at and never thinking they had anything to do with me or
         my eyes, and how it’s really just a lucky coincidence that I can see instead of being one of those blind people I see on the
         subway. And all day at work whenever this stuff strikes me I start tearing up again, getting ready to start crying, and only
         keeping myself from crying because of the cubicles’ low partitions and how everybody can see me and would be concerned, and
         the whole day after the dream is like this, and it’s tiring as hell, my girlfriend would say emotionally draining, and I sign
         out early and go home and I’m so tired and sleepy I can barely keep my eyes open, and when I get home I go right in and crawl
         in bed at like 4:00 in the afternoon and more or less pass out."|"Brief Interviews With Hideous Men"|"David Foster Wallace"
"ap 06:00"|six|"‘Imagine not existing until a man needs you. Being there and yet not there. A willed translucence. Provisionally there, contingently
         there. The old saw Lives to serve. His career. Breadwinner. Every morning up at six, kiss us all goodbye, a piece of toast for the bus. He could eat for real
         on his break. A bellman would go to the deli. The pressure produced by pressure. The rich belches of expense-account lunches.
         The mirrors’ remains of sebum and pus and sneezed detritus. Twenty-six-no-seven years at the same station. The grave nod he’d
         receive a tip with. The inaudible thank-you to the regulars. Sometimes a name. All those solids tumbling out of all those
         large soft warm fat moist white anuses, flexing. Imagine. To attend so much passage. To see men of substance at their most

00:00|midnight|"‘What she knows is that the totally most terrible degrading thing that she ever could have even imagined happening to her
         has really happened to her now. And she survived. She’s still here. I’m not saying she’s thrilled, I’m not saying she’s thrilled
         about it or she’s in great shape or clicking her heels together out of joy it happened, but she’s still here, and she knows
         it, and now she knows something. I mean really knows. Her idea of herself and what she can live through and survive is bigger now. Enlarged, larger, deeper. She’s stronger than
         she ever deep-down thought, and now she knows it, she knows she’s strong in a totally different way from knowing it just because
         your folks tell you or some speechmaker at a school assembly has you all repeat you’re Somebody you’re Strong over and over.
         Alls I’m saying is she’s not the same and how some of the ways she’s not the same—like, if she’s still afraid at midnight
         walking to her car in a parking garage or whatever of getting jumped and gang-raped, now she’s afraid in a different way.
         Not that she wants it to ever happen again, getting gang-raped, no way. But now she knows it won’t kill her, she can survive
         it, it won’t obliterate her or make her, like, subhuman.’"|"Brief Interviews With Hideous Men"|"David Foster Wallace"
