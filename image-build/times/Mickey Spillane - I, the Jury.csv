08:00|"eight A.M."|"“Myrna did. She and Jack were driving out to the country today to pick a building site for their cottage. She got here at eight A.M. or a little after. When Jack didn’t answer, she got worried. His arm had been giving him trouble lately and she thought it might have been that. She called the super. He knew her and let her in. When she screamed the super came running back and called us. Right after I got the story about the party from her, she broke down completely. Then I called you.”"|"I, the Jury"|"Mickey Spillane"
"ap ~ 03:15"|"about three fifteen"|"“The coroner places it about five hours before I got here. That would make it about three fifteen. When I get an autopsy report we may be able to narrow it down even further.”"|"I, the Jury"|"Mickey Spillane"
"ap 08:30"|"eight thirty"|"“Here’s a list Myrna gave me. She was the first to arrive. Got here at eight thirty last night. She acted as hostess, meeting the others at the door. The last one came about eleven. They spent the evening doing some light drinking and dancing, then left as a group about one.”"|"I, the Jury"|"Mickey Spillane"
"ap ~ 11:00"|"about eleven"|"“By answering a few questions. First, what time did you get to the party that night?”
“Roughly, about eleven. I was held up by a visit to a patient.”
“What time did you leave?”"|"I, the Jury"|"Mickey Spillane"
"ap ~ 01:00"|"Around one"|"“What time did you leave?”
“Around one. We left together.”
“Then where did you go?”"|"I, the Jury"|"Mickey Spillane"
"ap 01:45"|"one forty-five"|"“I had my car downstairs. Esther and Mary Bellemy drove with me. We went to the Chicken Bar and had a sandwich. We left there at one forty-five. I remember the time because we were the only ones there and they were getting ready to close at two. I dropped the twins off at their hotel, then went straight to my apartment. I reached there about a quarter after two. I remember the time there, too, since I had to reset my alarm clock.”"|"I, the Jury"|"Mickey Spillane"

"ap < 10:00"|"nearly ten o’clock"|"I didn’t want to go through it right then. It was nearly ten o’clock and there was a chance that either the police might walk in on me or the little guy get suspicious enough of my being away so long he’d call a copper. As quickly as I could, I put the stuff back in the drawers and replaced them in the dresser. The book I stuck in my hip pocket."|"I, the Jury"|"Mickey Spillane"
"ap < 10:00"|"nearly ten o’clock"|"We drove on in silence after that. It was nearly ten o’clock when we got to the apartment. We went up the stairs instead of waiting for the elevator and rang the bell. No one came to the door and Charlotte fumbled for her key. “Damn,” she said. “I forgot this is the maid’s day off.” We went inside and the bell rang again when we opened the door."|"I, the Jury"|"Mickey Spillane"
04:00|"four A.M."|"“Not far from here. She was wandering on the streets at four A.M. and the patrolman picked her up on suspicion.”"|"I, the Jury"|"Mickey Spillane"
"< 00:00"|"almost midnight"|"It was almost midnight, and a sleepy attendant drove up as soon as I got downstairs. I stuffed a dollar bill into his hand, hopped in and pulled away. Luckily, there was no traffic to worry about this time of night. I beat out a few lights and turned on the West Side Express Highway and headed north. Pat had told me the town the college was in. Ordinarily it was a good three hours’ drive from the city, but I didn’t intend to take that long."|"I, the Jury"|"Mickey Spillane"
"< 16:00"|"nearly four in the afternoon"|"When I awoke I glanced at my watch. It was nearly four in the afternoon. Kathy heard me stir and came into the room with a tray of bacon and eggs and coffee."|"I, the Jury"|"Mickey Spillane"
10:00|"ten A.M."|"I gulped the eggs hungrily and polished off three cups of coffee. Then I called Myrna and she told me that it was okay to pick her up at ten A.M. Saturday. I hung up and poked around the bookshelves for something to read while I waited. Most of the fiction I had read, so I passed on to some of Charlotte’s textbooks. One was a honey called Hypnosis as a Treatment for Mental Disorders. I skimmed through it. Too wordy. It gave the procedure for putting a patient into a state of relaxation, inducing hypnosis, and suggesting treatment. That way, the patient later went about effecting his own cure automatically."|"I, the Jury"|"Mickey Spillane"
"ap 07:30"|Seven-thirty|"I pulled her down on the bed and kissed her. “What time is it?” She looked at her watch.
“Seven-thirty.”
“Holy cowl I slept the whole day out practically!”"|"I, the Jury"|"Mickey Spillane"
"ap 02:50"|"two hours and fifty minutes"|"“Everyone present here is under suspicion for murder,” he said. “Naturally, I know that you all couldn’t have done it. You are to report to each of my men as your name is called. They will speak to you separately. What we want is your alibi, whom you were with at the game, or wherever you were”—he checked his watch—“two hours and fifty minutes ago. If you can vouch for someone standing near you, do it. By doing so you are only insuring your own alibi. I want the truth. Nothing else. We will catch you if you try falsifying your statements. That is all.”"|"I, the Jury"|"Mickey Spillane"
">> 00:00"|"Well after midnight"|"When I stopped in front of Charlotte’s place I had to stop thinking. I looked at my watch. Well after midnight. I opened the door for her."|"I, the Jury"|"Mickey Spillane"
"ap 00:00"|twelve|"I awoke with a bad taste in my mouth. I brushed my teeth, but that didn’t get rid of the taste. I looked out the window. Monday was no better than the day before. The rain was coming down in buckets. I couldn’t stand to be holed up any longer, so I shaved and got dressed, then donned a raincoat and went out to eat. It was twelve then; when I finished it was one. I dropped in a bar and ordered one highball after another. The next time I looked at the clock it was nearly six."|"I, the Jury"|"Mickey Spillane"
