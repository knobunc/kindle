09:00|"nine a.m."|"There is an alley of sushi restaurants at the market, each the size of a railroad car, with one long counter and little space to pass behind the customers seated at the stools. If you get there before the market opens to the public at nine a.m., you can avoid long lines. The sushi are placed in front of you on a long green haran leaf faster than you can eat them. You can have five kinds of tuna sushi with different degrees of fattiness, a huge pile of uni (sea urchin), steamed freshwater eel—unlike the roasted eel you find elsewhere—and a bulbous pile of something soft and white and rich tasting. I asked what the last was and the translated response came back as “testosterone of cod.” My guess is that it is the organ that produces the sperm, but as I said, one of the secrets of enjoying Japanese food is not to ask too many questions."|"International Night"|"Mark Kurlansky"
12:00|midday|"Haiti’s Barbancourt, double distilled and dark, is simply the best rum in the world. And amazingly, through coups d’état, revolutions, massacres, and strikes, the quality of the rum never waivers. There is a small mushroom I have never seen anywhere else called djon djon, which, appropriately, turns rice black. And there are the dishes in this truly Haitian dinner. Truly Haitian, except that in Haiti, it would probably be eaten midday, which is when Haitians eat their big meal. A light supper, perhaps just a bowl of soup, would be evening fare."|"International Night"|"Mark Kurlansky"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"On our journey up the Maroni, we loaded a few bottles of cane syrup, a basket of fresh limes, and a case of white “agricole” rum made directly from fermented cane juice. These are the essential ingredients for the true Caribbean rum punch affectionately known in Creole as “ti punch.” This drink wards off tropical heat, fear, and anxiety with a pleasant cloud of indifference. We left so early that by ten o’clock, when the sun had turned white-hot, we had already been traveling for four hours and the guide would smile and announce, “Uh, c’est l’heure du premier punch,” and I would concur and fix everyone their first punch of the day."|"International Night"|"Mark Kurlansky"
"ap 00:29"|12:29|"From the outset, this was a strange setting for a civil war. Nicaragua was already one of the poorest countries in the Americas when, on December 23, 1972, the capital, Managua, was devastated by an earthquake, killing five thousand people. The quake struck at 12:29. I know this because when I got there more than a decade after the earthquake, the clock in the steeple in the center of town still said 12:29. Like everything else in the capital, it had not been fixed since the earthquake."|"International Night"|"Mark Kurlansky"
