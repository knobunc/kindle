"ap 00:45"|"quarter of one"|"Today’s show could change his reputation. At a quarter of one—live from the Century of Progress!—two unimpeachable doctors would join him on the midway and publicly agree about the way to save these babies. No, not with sideshows, but yes, with incubators—as Martin had been saying all along—and yes, with dedicated care, and yes, indeed, with public money. The script included Dr. Julius Hess, the director of Sarah Morris Children’s Hospital at Michael Reese and head of Chicago’s Medical Society. Formidable. And Dr. Herman Bundesen, the health commissioner, a man who was known to be mighty fond of the microphone himself."|"The Strange Case of Dr. Couney"|"Dawn Raffel"
11:00|"Eleven o’clock in the morning"|"Today brought another, possibly more important chance of a lifetime. Eleven o’clock in the morning, the mothers began to appear. They came from every corner of Chicagoland, glimmering with sweat, adjusting their loveliest summer frocks, walking in newly polished shoes, while their twins and singles mewled and hollered and spit up and cried like any other toddlers under the blazing sun. Here were Martin and Maye, resplendent and eager to greet them. Here came Miss May Winter, from the class of ’01. And here was the always impeccable Julius Hess, and Herman Bundesen, and with them Morris Fishbein. A curious crowd gathered, quite possibly oblivious to the news that halfway around the world, the Nazis were staging a coup in Austria."|"The Strange Case of Dr. Couney"|"Dawn Raffel"

Next, Mrs. Mollie Greenfield expressed her gratitude on behalf of all the mothers of the class of ’33. Then the announcer handed the microphone to the city’s health commissioner."|"The Strange Case of Dr. Couney"|"Dawn Raffel"

His métier was dramatic reenactments of fires and wars, sanitized catastrophes for public enjoyment. In Omaha, the Battle of Manila was a victory for him. In Buffalo, he went for double, with a theatrical production called The Land of the Midnight Sun, using the new electric lighting, and The Great Fire at Dawson City."|"The Strange Case of Dr. Couney"|"Dawn Raffel"
19:02|1902|"Martin saw it coming. He had warned them, had he not? Never would something like this have happened on his watch. Sam had been invited to make their pitch for the concession in St. Louis all the way back in ’01, before their Buffalo troubles. By 1902, the concessions committee was sold on the idea of an incubator show. But rather than award the contract to people who knew how to run it, they were shopping around. For all Martin knew, they intended to give it to Edward Bayliss from the beginning. The master of disaster: the Battle of Manila, the Great Fire at Dawson City. Bayliss was local to St. Louis, well connected."|"The Strange Case of Dr. Couney"|"Dawn Raffel"

It’s the passion project of an artist named Fred Kahl—aka The Great Fredini—who spent more than ten thousand hours creating the 1:13 scale model. You might gaze on its lacy minarets, its balconies and towers, its perfect plastic people, and long to shrink yourself into a past where you’ve never been."|"The Strange Case of Dr. Couney"|"Dawn Raffel"

Instead, a head nurse identified only as Miss Graf was on duty. All was quiet at Coney Island, with only the creatures of the sea scurrying on the beach and the bleary men at Hell Gate toiling thanklessly away. Then an exhausted worker knocked over a bucket of tar. Boiling hot. In a minute, the work lights sizzled and shorted, and Hell Gate burst into flames."|"The Strange Case of Dr. Couney"|"Dawn Raffel"

As he recorded it, Miss Graf had been just about to wake the two wet nurses for the two a.m. feeding when Solomon Fischel ran into the nursery in his nightshirt. A police sergeant followed. Smoke poured in through the doorway as the doctor grabbed two babies, covering their heads with blankets to shield them. The nurses, still in nightgowns, each scooped up a child; a wet nurse named Anna Duboid grabbed her own newborn, and into the hellish night they fled."|"The Strange Case of Dr. Couney"|"Dawn Raffel"

At dinner that night, the forty-three-year-old doctor complained to his friends of feeling ill. Yet the couple went after sunset to a synagogue, where they said their vows in Russian. Next, they checked into a hotel with plans to stay for a couple of weeks. But at four a.m. on his wedding night, Solomon Fischel awoke with a terrible stomachache. Two hours later, he was dead."|"The Strange Case of Dr. Couney"|"Dawn Raffel"

This twenty-first-century gathering—come one, come all—grew out of months of planning and logistics, after Barbara Gerber (class of ’34), told me she was coming in to visit from California. She was staying in Long Beach, close to our meeting place at Barbara Horn’s apartment. By six that morning, Kathy Meyer (’39) was en route from Connecticut. Her husband was ill, and her plans involved a relay of trains and family arrangements, but she was determined. “I missed the reunion in 1940 because I got sick,” she said. “I don’t want to miss this one.” Betty Heinisch (’42) was traveling 150 miles from Absecon, near Atlantic City. Beth Allen (’41) needed a ride from suburban New Jersey, so I’d be picking her up and we’d make the hour-plus drive together."|"The Strange Case of Dr. Couney"|"Dawn Raffel"
