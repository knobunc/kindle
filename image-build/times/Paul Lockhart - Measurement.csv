"ap 01:00"|1|"Then the motion of the point can be completely described by knowing exactly which time numbers go with exactly which position numbers. If, for instance, the point is at position number 2 when the clock reads 1, then that information (position is 2 when time is 1) constitutes an event in the history of the motion, and complete knowledge of all such events is tantamount to the motion itself. Geometrically, we can represent an event like this as a pair of points, one in space and one in time, linked together by the motion of the point itself:"|Measurement|"Paul Lockhart"

"ap 04:17"|417|"For example, if we have two piles of sizes 231 and 186, what is the code for their sum; that is, the pile we get when we push the two piles together? As I am sure you are aware, there is a well-known system for determining this sort of thing: 6 plus 1 is 7, 8 plus 3 is 11, carry the 1, add that to 2, plus 1 is 4, so itâ€™s 417."|Measurement|"Paul Lockhart"
