There was fresh groundsel,3 too, for Miss Maylie’s birds, with which Oliver, – who had been studying the subject under the able tuition of the village clerk – would decorate the cages in the most approved taste. When the birds were made all spruce and smart for the day, there was usually some little commission of charity to execute in the village, or failing that, there was always something to do in the garden, or about the plants, to which Oliver – who had studied this science also under the same master, who was a gardener by trade, – applied himself with hearty good-will till Miss Rose made her appearance, when there were a thousand commendations to be bestowed upon all he had done, for which one of those light-hearted beautiful smiles was an ample recompense."|"Oliver Twist"|"Charles Dickens"

Thus they crossed the bridge from the Middlesex to the Surrey shore, when the woman, apparently disappointed in her anxious scrutiny of the foot-passengers, turned back. The movement was sudden, but he who watched her was not thrown off his guard by it, for shrinking into one of the recesses which surmount the piers of the bridge, and leaning over the parapet the better to conceal his figure, he suffered her to pass by on the opposite pavement, and when she was about the same distance in advance as she had been before, he slipped quietly down and followed her again.

CONTAINING FURTHER PARTICULARS CONCERNING THE PLEASANT OLD GENTLEMAN
1. It was late: There had been no instalment of Oliver Twist, nor of The Pickwick Papers, in June 1837, which caused rumours about ‘Boz’ to abound. Dickens had been stunned by the sudden death on 7 May of his wife’s sister, Mary Hogarth (1819–37), who had frequently been a member of their household. ‘She went up stairs to bed at about one o’Clock in perfect health and her usual delightful spirits; was taken ill before she had undressed; and died in my arms next afternoon at 3 o’Clock. Everything that could be done was done but nothing could save her. The medical men imagine it was a disease of the heart.’ In the same letter, Dickens wrote that ‘I have lost the dearest friend I ever had… She had not a single fault, and was in life almost as far above the foibles and vanity of her sex and age as she is now in Heaven.’"|"Oliver Twist"|"Charles Dickens"

"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"2. the execution that morning: Executions outside Newgate Prison, using the ‘new drop’ (see note I to III, 14), took place on Monday mornings at eight o’clock; so Oliver and the Dodger have arrived at Fagin’s on a Sunday night. Dixon says that ‘an execution is as good as a lord-mayor’s show to the race of pickpockets’; he estimated that at a given hanging the arrests would number some thirty to fifty, the robberies several hundred."|"Oliver Twist"|"Charles Dickens"
08:00|"eight in the morning"|"2. Smithfield… Grosvenor Square: Smithfield was London’s main livestock market (held on Mondays and Thursdays till 1855), as well as a long-established site of public executions and religious martyrdoms – Sir William Wallace was executed there in 1305. It was also home to Bartholomew Fair, already a focus for fraudsters and pickpockets in Ben Jonson’s 1614 comedy of the same name, held every year for three days, starting on 3 September (new calendar), the feast of St Bartholomew (Sikes’s ‘Bartlemy time’). The fair was discontinued in 1835, and Dickens was later active in his journal Household Words against the ‘Beast Market’, and unhygienic nearby ‘slaughterhouses in the heart of a city’ (‘A Monument of French Folly’ (1851), DJ, II). In Great Expectations the young Pip, wandering into it, finds that ‘the shameful place, being all asmear with filth and fat and blood and foam, seemed to stick to me’; he flees, only to run into Newgate and the Old Bailey, where a drunken official shows him where the gallows is kept and informs him four people are to be hanged ‘the day after tomorrow at eight in the morning’ (ch. 20). See also I, 21. The mansions of Grosvenor Square are quite at the other, smart, West End of town, just south of Oxford Street."|"Oliver Twist"|"Charles Dickens"
"ap 09:30"|"half-past nine"|"2. A watchman was crying half-past nine: Guiliano and Collins (in The Annotated Dickens) say: ‘Watchmen called the hour and the half-hour throughout the night. They would periodically call out the last half hour to be struck until the next one was nearly due. The practice was abolished by Peel’s Police Act of 1829.’ But it appears to be still going here, several years later; only in 1839 was the old watch system abolished in the City of London, where Peel’s Metropolitan Police at first had no jurisdiction."|"Oliver Twist"|"Charles Dickens"
