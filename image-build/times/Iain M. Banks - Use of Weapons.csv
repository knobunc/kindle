12:00|noontime|"Zakalwe enfranchised; 
Those lazy curls of smoke above the city, 
Black wormholes in the air of noontime’s bright Ground Zero; 
Did they tell you what you wanted to be told? 
Or rain-skinned on a concrete fastness, 
Fortress island in the flood; 
You walked amongst the smashed machines, 
And looked through undrugged eyes 
For engines of another war, 
And an attrition of the soul and the device. 
With craft and plane and ship, 
And gun and drone and field you played, and 
Wrote an allegory of your regress 
In other people’s tears and blood; 
The tentative poetics of your rise 
From a mere and shoddy grace. 
And those who found you, 
Took, remade you 
(‘Hey, my boy, it’s you and us knife missiles now, 
Our lunge and speed and bloody secret: 
The way to a man’s heart is through his chest!’) 
- They thought you were their plaything, 
Savage child; the throwback from wayback 
Expedient because 
Utopia spawns few warriors. 
But you knew your figure cut a cipher 
Through every crafted plan, 
And playing our game for real 
Saw through our plumbing jobs 
And wayward glands 
To a meaning of your own, in bones."|"Use of Weapons"|"Iain M. Banks"

"< 12:00"|"near midday"|"He closed his eyes, but heard nothing more distinct. He opened them again. The wall was earth, and he was probably underground, for there were thick sawn-off roots sticking into the space around him. The light was composed of two nearly vertical shafts, slightly angled beams of direct sunlight, so . . . near midday, near the equator. Underground, he thought, and felt sick. Nice and hard to find. He wondered if the plane had been on course when it crashed, and how far from the crash site he’d been carried. No point in worrying about it."|"Use of Weapons"|"Iain M. Banks"
