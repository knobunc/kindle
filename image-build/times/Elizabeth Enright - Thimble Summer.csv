"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"There is a peculiar joy in writing about children for children. One naturally goes back to one’s own childhood to find things. To me, the astonishing thing is in the way one took life during those years. It was as though a thin, but tough, membrane had not yet grown between oneself and the rest of the world. A child sees everything sharp and radiant; each object with its shadow beside it. Happiness is more truly happiness than it will ever be again, and is caused by such little things. The first day of spring, for instance, when it was warm enough to go without a coat; or the time you stayed up till nine o’clock, and someone showed you Scorpio, and the Pleiades, and Cassiopeia’s Chair. Happiness came from the smell of a Christmas tree, or roast chicken on Sunday; it came from the first snowfall of the season, or learning to hang by your knees from a trapeze, or going barefoot in summer. I remember very well the glow of magic that illuminated the world for months after my mother had taken me to see Pavlowa dance; I remember the moment when my grandmother opened a book, and began to read me the first chapter of a story called Treasure Island."|"Thimble Summer"|"Elizabeth Enright"
00:00|midnight|"Garnet took an apple pie out of the cakebox and wrapped it in waxed paper: it was going to be fun to stay up all night. She didn’t intend to sleep for a minute, even though her mother insisted on her taking some blankets along, just in case. At midnight she would heat the coffee, and they would all have a picnic."|"Thimble Summer"|"Elizabeth Enright"
"ap < 06:00"|"nearly six"|"Garnet glanced at the clock; it was nearly six, and time to begin supper. She put more wood in the stove and filled the fat kettle with water. Then she went down to the garden with a basket to get some lettuce and cucumbers."|"Thimble Summer"|"Elizabeth Enright"
00:00|"twelve at night"|"The loud clattering of the kiln door wakened her. In the silence that followed she sat up and rubbed her eyes and heard the clock in the Blaiseville courthouse miles away ringing the hour. She counted the strikes; there were twelve of them — clear and perfect on the air. She had never been awake before to hear the clock strike twelve at night!"|"Thimble Summer"|"Elizabeth Enright"
00:00|midnight|"“I am, too,” agreed Garnet. “I never ate a meal at midnight before.” Food should have a special taste at such an hour, she thought."|"Thimble Summer"|"Elizabeth Enright"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"At seven o’clock they heard the Hausers in their truck a mile away. Merle and Cicero raised healthy, tone-deaf voices and sang because they felt good."|"Thimble Summer"|"Elizabeth Enright"
00:00|midnight|"“This is someone new to belong to our family,” she said. “His name is Eric, and he appeared at midnight.”"|"Thimble Summer"|"Elizabeth Enright"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"Garnet and Citronella huddled together and whispered. They heard the court-house clock strike eight, then nine; but when it struck ten they were both sound asleep."|"Thimble Summer"|"Elizabeth Enright"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"Garnet and Citronella huddled together and whispered. They heard the court-house clock strike eight, then nine; but when it struck ten they were both sound asleep."|"Thimble Summer"|"Elizabeth Enright"
"< 00:00"|"a little before midnight"|"At a little before midnight they were wakened by a tremendous pounding and shouting."|"Thimble Summer"|"Elizabeth Enright"
"ap 00:30"|"half past twelve"|"Every year Mr. Linden rented the Hausers’ threshing machine for one day. That meant that Mr. Hauser and Cicero and Merle came with it and helped. Mr. Freebody was always on hand and Jasper Cardiff and his two sons always came down from Big Hollow. Some of the men would bring their wives with them to visit and help Mrs. Linden with the cooking; threshers eat a lot. Already there were cakes in the pantry, and five different kinds of pie nestled under clean dish towels. There were new loaves of bread too, and at dinner time there would be pork and beans, and mountains of mashed potato, and oceans of gravy. The big agate coffeepot would be simmering on the stove, and by half past twelve every single thing would be gone! Garnet remembered other threshings."|"Thimble Summer"|"Elizabeth Enright"
12:00|noonday|"Eric climbed down from the pile to get a drink of water; the engine roared and chugged, and the sun of noonday burned in all its glory. Garnet felt drowsy; she sat up straight, opened her eyes very wide, tried humming a song, but it didn’t do any good. Pretty soon her head dropped anyway, and her thoughts began turning slowly, strangely, into dreams."|"Thimble Summer"|"Elizabeth Enright"
09:00|"nine o’clock in the morning"|"“I’m doing lots of awful things today,” said Garnet complacently. “Leaving the dishes, feeding ice-cream cones to pigs, and eating one myself at nine o’clock in the morning!”"|"Thimble Summer"|"Elizabeth Enright"
"ap 03:00"|"Three o’clock"|"“No, no,” replied Mr. Freebody. “You two little girls go on out and enjoy yourselves. You’ve got hours before the judges come. Three o’clock they’ll be here, and see that you get back in time!”"|"Thimble Summer"|"Elizabeth Enright"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"“I don’t know how I’ll ever wait till three o’clock,” sighed Garnet, but in the next minute she had forgotten all about time and waiting. There were dozens, hundreds of things to see and do."|"Thimble Summer"|"Elizabeth Enright"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"“Hey!” he yelled. “It’s three o’clock! Hurry up!” They could barely hear him but guessed at his meaning when he pointed repeatedly at the watch in his hand."|"Thimble Summer"|"Elizabeth Enright"
