00:00|Midnight|"Well, a funny thing happened on the way to the word processor. Early in 1986 my agent, Scott Meredith, called me in his most persuasive ""Don't-say-no-until-I've-finished"" mode. There was, it seemed, this young genius of a movie producer who was determined to film something—anything—of mine. Though I'd never heard of Peter Guber, as it happened I had seen two of his movies (Midnight Express, The Deep), and been quite impressed by them. I was even more impressed when Scott told me that Peter's latest, The Color Purple, had been nominated for half a dozen Oscars."|"Rama II"|"Arthur C. Clarke"

The lovely Japanese girl on the screen suggested that now would be an excellent time to make or confirm ground transportation and housing arrangements. Nicole activated the communication system in her seat and a thin rectangular tray with a keyboard and small display area slid in front of her. In less than a minute Nicole arranged both her train ride to Kyoto and her electric trolley passage from there to her hotel. She used her Universal Credit Card (UCC) to pay for all transactions, after first correctly identifying herself by indicating that her mother's maiden name was Anawi Tiasso. When she was finished a small printed schedule listing her train and trolley identifiers, along with the times of arrival and transit (she would reach her hotel at 11:14 a.m. Japanese time), popped out of one end of the tray."|"Rama II"|"Arthur C.

Now, Nicole said to herself as she stifled a yawn, he's going to tell me what this is all about. Takagishi had met her at the hotel when she had arrived. He had suggested that she have some lunch and a short nap before he returned. After he had picked her up at three o'clock, they had come directly to this temple."|"Rama II"|"Arthur C. Clarke"

Well., not exactly. O’Toole sat up straight in his chair and smiled. It was ten o'clock in the morning and he was sitting in a small anteroom inside the Vatican. He was about to have a private audience with the Vicar of Christ himself, Pope John-Paul V."|"Rama II"|"Arthur C. Clarke"
"ap 09:30"|nine-thirty|"""At nine-thirty,"" Nicole replied. ""Very fashionably late. We probably won't have dinner until an hour after that. I'm going to eat something in the hotel room before I leave so that I won't starve."""|"Rama II"|"Arthur C. Clarke"

She walked over to the computer terminal to order something to eat. With a few commands she requested a bowl of minestrone and a small bottle of mineral water. The computer monitor told her to expect them both in between sixteen and nineteen minutes."|"Rama II"|"Arthur C. Clarke"

As she had anticipated, he had interpreted her approach to mean something entirely different. They had continued talking while Francesca had announced to the partygoers that there would be no more formal entertainment until after midnight and that all the guests were free to drink or snack or dance to the recorded music until then, Julien had offered his arm to Nicole and the two of them had walked back over to the portico, where they had been dancing ever since."|"Rama II"|"Arthur C.

She took off her skis, stuck them in the snow, and walked toward the front door. She ignored the conspicuous signs all around her that said eintritt verboten. From out of nowhere came two burly men, one of whom actually jumped between Nicole and the door to the hut. ""It's all right,"" she heard a familiar voice say, ""we're expecting her."" The two guards vanished as quickly as they had appeared and Nicole saw Darren, smiling as always, occupying the doorway to the chalet."|"Rama II"|"Arthur C. Clarke"

""Look at this, quick, Janos/' she said, her eye on the digital clock counting down the inspection period. ""It looks perfectly healthy."" Janos leaned over from the opposite side of the operating table. My God, Nicole thought, we're going to remove . . . The digital clock read 00:08. ""Stop it,"" she shouted. ""Stop the operation."" Nicole and Janos both reached for the robot surgeon control box at the same time."|"Rama II"|"Arthur C. Clarke"

Why had he been reticent and withdrawn since Borzov's death? |ust after midnight she stared at the ceiling of her small bedroom. Today the crew enters Rama and I will be here alone. I should wait until then to continue my analysis. But she couldn't wait. She was unable to push aside all the questions that were flooding her mind. Could there be a connection between fanos and the drugs in Borzov? Is it possible that his death was not completely accidental?"|"Rama II"|"Arthur C. Clarke"

We are going to proceed with our plan. Cosmonaut Tabori will stay here with me at Beta and pack all the heavy equipment, including the biot. I will coordinate the search. Brown, Sabatini, and des Jardins will cross the ice to New York, the most likely destination if the professor went under his own power.

At one call every ten seconds—allowing myself time to listen for a response and move to the next square meter—that would be six calls a minute.
