00:00|midnight|"When night came, the elves mounted the horses they had brought and rode storm-swift inland.

"~ 00:00"|"About midnight"|"About midnight, far away, she heard a horn. Something of its scream ran cold through her. The child cried out and she gathered him to her."|"The Broken Sword"|"Poul Anderson"
