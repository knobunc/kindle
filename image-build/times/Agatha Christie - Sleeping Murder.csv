“We’ll know at three o’clock.”
Dr. Kennedy arrived punctually. Looking round the drawing room he said: “Seems odd to be here again.”"|"Sleeping Murder"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 10:30"|"Half past ten"|"“Ah, I wondered.” The old lady nodded her head and sipped her milk. Then she said conversationally, “Half past ten—that’s the time. It’s always at half past ten. Most remarkable.” She lowered her voice and leaned forward again."|"Sleeping Murder"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"“Yes, quite a sound view to take. Well, I think this is all quite clear, Mrs. Reed. Perhaps if you come in the day after tomorrow? Will eleven o’clock suit you?”"|"Sleeping Murder"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"Then, with a change of manner, he shook hands with her and said, “Since we seem to be old friends, you really must bring your husband to tea with my mother one day.

"ap ~ 11:30"|"About half past eleven"|"Giles, feeling, as he put it, rather like a shady detective in a divorce suit, took up his position at a point of vantage overlooking the front gate of Anstell Manor. About half past eleven he reported to Gwenda that all had gone well. Mrs. Erskine had left in a small Austin car, clearly bound for the market town three miles away. The coast was clear."|"Sleeping Murder"|"Agatha Christie"

“I don’t know … Nine o’clock, I suppose.”
“And you said good-bye?”"|"Sleeping Murder"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap > 04:30"|"shortly after 4.30"|"“Good for you, Gwennie,” he said gently. “I hope you’re right. Now this is what I think we’d better do. I’ll answer her letter and tell her to come here on Thursday. The train connection is quite good. By changing at Dillmouth Junction she can get here shortly after 4.30. If you two will come over that afternoon, we can tackle her all together.”"|"Sleeping Murder"|"Agatha Christie"

The hands of the clock pointed to ten minutes to five.

"ap 04:35"|"four thirty-five"|"“Hullo? Is that the station? This is Dr. Kennedy speaking. I was expecting someone by the four thirty-five. Middle-aged country woman. Did anyone ask to be directed to me? Or—what do you say?”"|"Sleeping Murder"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 04:35"|"four thirty-five"|"“Don’t think as there could be anyone for you, Doctor. Weren’t no strangers on the four thirty-five. Mr. Narracotts from Meadows, and Johnnie Lawes, and old Benson’s daughter. Weren’t no other passengers at all.”"|"Sleeping Murder"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 04:05"|four-five|"He looked from Kennedy to Giles and Gwenda who had accompanied the doctor.

If you will take the train leaving Coombeleigh at 3.30, change at Dillmouth Junction, and come by the Lonsbury Bay train to Woodleigh Bolton, my house is only a few minutes’ walk. Turn to the left as you come out of the station, then take the first road on the right. My house is at the end of it on the right. The name is on the gate."|"Sleeping Murder"|"Agatha Christie"

Also, she got out at the station before Woodleigh Bolton. Why? It seems possible to me that, after writing to the doctor, she wrote to someone else, suggesting a rendezvous at Woodleigh Camp, perhaps, and that she proposed after that rendezvous, if it was unsatisfactory, to go on to Dr. Kennedy and ask his advice. It is possible that she had suspicions of some definite person, and she may have written to that person hinting at her knowledge and suggesting a rendezvous.”"|"Sleeping Murder"|"Agatha Christie"

Then he simply substituted the letter you all saw for the letter she had with her (and which he had asked her to bring because of the directions in it) and went home to prepare for you and play out the little comedy of waiting for Lily.”"|"Sleeping Murder"|"Agatha Christie"
