Maybe the only reason she had read this one twice was that it had been written with a fountain pen. Black ink. Isn’t it strange how things that should be insignificant affect what we do?
Please be there between eight-fifteen and eight-thirty.
She carried it over to the narrow kitchen. A bottle of Italian red had been opened and recorked and she rinsed a glass under the cold tap before pouring herself a drink. The writing was distinctive, lowercase letters that were small and rounded, the capitals more pronounced and florid. The P of Please large enough to contain the whole word within its loop."|"Lonely Hearts"|"John Harvey"

"ap 06:17"|six-seventeen|"He turned slowly, coaxing the animal down on to the pillow. The clock read six-seventeen. A second cat, Miles, purred on contentedly from the patch in the covers where Resnick’s legs had made a deep V."|"Lonely Hearts"|"John Harvey"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"Skelton continued down the steps and round into the car park with a step that managed to be unhurried and urgent at the same time. Resnick wondered if the superintendent would be back in the station for the nine o’clock briefing, or whether the chief inspector would be sitting in for him. He’d rather Skelton’s briskness than twenty minutes of Len Lawrence doing his man-of-the-people act."|"Lonely Hearts"|"John Harvey"
"ap 02:53"|"seven till three"|"Patel had drawn the early shift, seven till three, and was bending over his desk, making final adjustments to the files that would bring Resnick up to date with what had happened through the night. One detailed the movement of prisoners, in and out of the cells on the ground floor; the other logged messages and Patel would have sorted these into local and national. And he would have put on the kettle for tea."|"Lonely Hearts"|"John Harvey"
"ap 08:04"|"four minutes past eight"|"Resnick glanced over his shoulder at the round-faced clock between pinboard and his pair of filing cabinets: four minutes past eight."|"Lonely Hearts"|"John Harvey"
"ap 09:15"|"quarter-past nine"|"Superintendent Skelton had not returned from Central Police Station, so, after briefing his men, Resnick had reported to Chief Inspector Lawrence, together with the uniformed inspector in charge. Both men had kept it as short as possible and by a quarter-past nine, Resnick was back in his own office, phoning through to the detective chief inspector at headquarters."|"Lonely Hearts"|"John Harvey"
"ap 08:15"|"Quarter-past eight"|"“There was a train from Midland Station this morning,” said Divine. “Quarter-past eight. Booking clerk recognized him from the photograph.”"|"Lonely Hearts"|"John Harvey"
"ap 03:47"|"Three forty-seven"|"“Three forty-seven, sir,” said Naylor. “Forty-nine,” corrected Divine. “Sir.”"|"Lonely Hearts"|"John Harvey"
"ap 04:55"|"five minutes short of five o’clock"|"It was five minutes short of five o’clock when Resnick called Rachel Chaplin. She was in the middle of discussing a long-term fostering breakdown. The kid was a fourteen-year-old West Indian lad who, after months of stealing systematically from his foster mother’s purse, had neglected to send her a card on her birthday. The petty theft she’d been able to understand, even expected; the ignoring of her birthday, purposeful or merely forgetful, she found more difficult to take."|"Lonely Hearts"|"John Harvey"
"ap ~ 06:30"|"about six-thirty"|"“You don’t think there’s any chance at all of keeping things as they are?” Rachel said into the room. “Are we all saying that that’s just not on?”
“How about six-thirty?” asked Resnick.
“Make it seven.”"|"Lonely Hearts"|"John Harvey"

“Seven o’clock.”
She put down the phone and got on with her meeting."|"Lonely Hearts"|"John Harvey"
15:00|"three that afternoon"|"Leave this one alone, Resnick had told him that morning, get back to the break-ins. You know the routine: question and answer. The same numbing procedure that had gone on too long. Houses where all the occupants were at work, no use in calling until way after six. Now there was a pain stretching across between his shoulder blades—all those kitchen tables he had leaned over, filling in the forms. Question and answer. Officially, he’d come off duty at three that afternoon."|"Lonely Hearts"|"John Harvey"
"ap 08:00"|"Eight o’clock"|"“This one here,” Resnick said, lifting one sheet away from the rest. “Man at 42—that’s across the street, isn’t it?—says he saw Shirley Peters leaving the house the evening she was killed. Eight o’clock.”"|"Lonely Hearts"|"John Harvey"
12:00|"High Noon"|"“My mum used to spend every spare minute she had at the pictures. Deptford, Lewisham. Anything with Grace Kelly in it, she’d be there, three, four times in a week. Spent half of my time as a kid, I did, sitting in Greenwich Park listening to her telling me what happened, over and over again. Fourteen Hours, High Noon, Mogambo. It was only when I saw some of them later, on the telly, I realized she’d got the plots all in a twist. That one, Dial M for Murder, where Grace Kelly’s husband’s out to…”"|"Lonely Hearts"|"John Harvey"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"Resnick had had too much experience outside the city’s discos at three in the morning to believe that, but he didn’t contradict her. “She was living with Macliesh then, was she?”"|"Lonely Hearts"|"John Harvey"

“Nearly twelve,” Phillips said, walking away.
“Hello,” Rachel said into the phone. “Who is this?”"|"Lonely Hearts"|"John Harvey"
"ap 04:15"|"quarter-past four"|"Resnick used a tissue to lift the mouse away. Stripped the cover from the pillow and took it to the bathroom. Pepper was curled around the lid of the laundry basket and when Resnick switched on the light, lay one paw across his eyes.
It was not yet a quarter-past four.
Resnick made tea."|"Lonely Hearts"|"John Harvey"
04:00|"Four that morning"|"I’m going to find out who’s going round the place whistling the Glenn Miller songbook, Resnick said to himself, and make sure he gets some Ellington for Christmas. Maybe it was a she. Did women whistle? Times gone by, it used to be considered unladylike, especially in public. Like smoking. Now when you walked round the city center every other female you passed had a lighted cigarette in her hand. Those under twenty-five, younger. What had they been telling him on Radio Four that morning? A generation of smoking teenage schoolgirls, using nicotine to cope with the stress of having few job prospects, of contracting Aids."|"Lonely Hearts"|"John Harvey"
"ap 05:11"|five-eleven|"She had a pale leather bag, the size of a fat wallet, hanging by a thin strap from her left shoulder; she picked a matching satchel from the floor and carried it in her right hand. Keeping step with Resnick, she was not far short of his height, five-ten or even five-eleven."|"Lonely Hearts"|"John Harvey"
"ap 04:30"|"half-past four"|"She’d told him, she’d told him half-a-dozen times if she’d told him once: back indoors by half-past four. What if I don’t know the time, he’d said? What do you think that watch is for? It’s bust. What do you mean, it’s bust? It won’t work any more. Look. Then ask somebody. You’ve got a tongue in your head, haven’t you?"|"Lonely Hearts"|"John Harvey"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"It was still only mid-evening and there was no point in getting to the club before eleven. At a sudden thought, he gave the eggs a stir, turned the gas low, and went to the phone."|"Lonely Hearts"|"John Harvey"
"ap 05:00"|five|"Resnick waited a while. There were other faces that he recognized; by that time more who recognized him, knew who and what he was. He began to count those in the club whom he’d arrested, seen sent down. At five, he stopped and went back to the bar. The woman, Jackie, was standing there and when he put down his empty glass she spat in it."|"Lonely Hearts"|"John Harvey"
"ap 11:30"|"Half-past eleven"|"“What time would that be, Mrs Barnett? Usually, I mean.”
“Half-past eleven.”
“But the children would already be asleep…”"|"Lonely Hearts"|"John Harvey"
"ap 11:30"|"half-past eleven"|"“They’re no trouble. Wake up without a fuss. Go off when she gets them back home again, fast as anything.”
“So your daughter comes to collect them at half-past eleven…”
“Or earlier. Makes me a bedtime drink, helps me into the bedroom, and off she goes till the next time. Brings them over on the bus, two buses really, but she always gets a taxi home. Phones through for it the minute she arrives.” She dabbed at a damp patch of hair. “I’ve known her have to ring back two, oh, three times; give some excuse like they couldn’t find the number, rang the bell and nobody answered. I’ve got nothing against them, of course, but they’re all, you know, these Asians. I don’t know if I should like to be driving home with them, last thing at night.”"|"Lonely Hearts"|"John Harvey"
"ap 02:52"|"Two fifty-two"|"“It is only…” Lynn checked her watch.
“Two fifty-two,” said the constable.
“It isn’t three yet. If she’s with friends. A party.” Lynn tried to smile reassuringly, but more and more she had a sense that the woman’s fears were grounded. Cold was starting to seek out her stomach. “There’s plenty of time for her to turn up.”"|"Lonely Hearts"|"John Harvey"
"ap 04:10"|"Ten-past four"|"Resnick was dreaming about a child playing with dolls: it was not a pleasant dream. The first sound of the telephone woke him with relief. Ten-past four. Dizzy jumped soundlessly down from somewhere above Resnick’s head, instantly hungry."|"Lonely Hearts"|"John Harvey"
00:00|midnight|"Resnick’s head swung back.
“Somewhere between midnight and one.”
Resnick nodded and went on into the room. The scene-of-crime team was just arriving outside; one or two neighbors were standing on the pavement in dressing gowns and slippers."|"Lonely Hearts"|"John Harvey"

“Till four, sir,” Naylor said.
Resnick glanced across the desk. “You two had lunch?”"|"Lonely Hearts"|"John Harvey"
"ap 05:30"|"half-past five"|"Rachel laughed in amazement. “Oh, so he went out and engineered a convenient crime so he could meet me at half-past five?”"|"Lonely Hearts"|"John Harvey"
"ap 07:30"|seven-thirty|"It was still shy of seven-thirty and they were on the steps outside the station. Skelton was wearing his dark executive blue and with good reason. There was an extra shine to his shoes and a messianic glint in his eyes that made Resnick wonder if he moonlighted as a lay preacher on his days off."|"Lonely Hearts"|"John Harvey"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"“Yeah,” said Colin Rich under his breath. “Like where’s the bloody coffee? When can we expect to get out of here and get a drink? They open at eleven.”"|"Lonely Hearts"|"John Harvey"
"ap 05:07"|Five-seven|"Dave Beatty moved the wrench to his other hand and opened a cupboard; inside was a large packet of tea bags and some sugar. He was conscious of Divine looking at him again, weighing him up.
“Five-seven,” Divine said.
“Look…”"|"Lonely Hearts"|"John Harvey"

Until now he’d been the only one of his family not to need glasses. He wondered about taking a break; the rain had eased off and he could walk between the trees and down the hill to the Sports Center, take a shower. He ought to do something before two-fifteen. Doria was lecturing to the combined second- and third-year groups of his course and Patel had every intention of being there.
