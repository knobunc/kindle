"ap 08:00"|"Eight o’clock"|"The curtains opened to a spectacularly cluttered set meant to represent Carter the Great’s study. A lackey bemoaned the audience’s presence. “Eight o’clock already, the show is starting, and the master’s room isn’t ready yet. He’ll have my hide for sure.”"|"Carter Beats the Devil"|"Glen David Gold"
12:00|noon|"Four days later, Monday, August sixth, Harding’s remains were on their way to their final resting place in Marion, Ohio. At the same time, the Hercules, still under surveillance for signs of Charles Carter, was in a storm south of the tropic of Cancer. At noon on that day, Jack Griffin and a superior, Colonel Edmund Starling, ferried from San Francisco to Oakland. They took a cab to Hilgirt Circle, at the top of Lake Merritt, where some of the wealthier families had relocated after the great earthquake. One Hilgirt Circle was a salmon-colored Mediterranean villa that rambled up the steep slope of China Hill. There were seven stories, each recessed above the last, like steps. Whereas its neighbors were hooded Arts and Crafts fortresses, One Hilgirt Circle was a rococo circus of archways, terra-cotta putti, gargoyles, and trellises strung with passion vines. Its builder couldn’t be accused of restraint."|"Carter Beats the Devil"|"Glen David Gold"
00:00|midnight|"His father read to them every night for two weeks and, every night, James drifted off quickly and Charles was left awake. It was worse, it turned out, to lie awake with company than to do so alone. He would wait until he heard the clock strike midnight, then he would crawl out of bed and slip into the hallway, listening for his father, or Cook, or Patsy."|"Carter Beats the Devil"|"Glen David Gold"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"“Religion,” Charles said, with the same sour expression their parents used when saying the word. “‘Please tell your father dinner will be ready by seven o’clock. If you have any trouble this afternoon, don’t worry, Mr. Jenks will look after you.’” Charles shuddered."|"Carter Beats the Devil"|"Glen David Gold"
"ap 03:30"|3:30|"The sky was dark for a remarkable reason. San Francisco was about to be blanketed with snow. When the first flakes fell, at 3:30, the Carter boys bolted out the front door and onto the street, where they twirled in a circle together, heads back, feeling for the first time ever snow on their faces."|"Carter Beats the Devil"|"Glen David Gold"
18:00|"6 P.M."|"By the time the clock chimed 6 P.M., he had put most of the page into English:"|"Carter Beats the Devil"|"Glen David Gold"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"Their plan had been to toast in the New Year with cider, but James had complained at ten o’clock, three hours ago, that it was already too late, so Carter had stopped all the clocks in the room. “It’s ten-thirty. Now, pick a card.” He fanned the deck."|"Carter Beats the Devil"|"Glen David Gold"

00:00|midnight|"Contrary to vaudeville’s claims, he wasn’t a prodigy. He had a workman’s undistinguished face, lacking all suggestion of precocious brilliance. In the sepia tone of the Highwayman photograph, the full effect of his ice-blue eyes was muted. His hair was a midnight black, and his features had not sharpened yet. His contemporaries had trouble describing him, and he was difficult to pick out in group photographs."|"Carter Beats the Devil"|"Glen David Gold"
"~ 04:00"|"About four in the morning"|"About four in the morning, he brought out a new trunk, and transferred all of his props into it. The old Kard and Koin stencil seemed like an admission of failure, but he wasn’t yet ready to add “the Amazing” or “the King” to his name. He stencil-cut a new title—simple, direct—and painted it on the side of the trunk: Charles Carter, Magician."|"Carter Beats the Devil"|"Glen David Gold"
">> 00:00"|"long after midnight"|"It was long after midnight when Carter, ragged and a little dirty under the fingernails, finally ran to the King Edward. It was far too late to inquire at the desk about a lady, and, after several hours in the barn (the Kowaleskis’ pig had taken an almost amatory shine to him), no amount of grooming could entirely mask Carter’s smell. So he had thought ahead, wrapping a half dozen of his landlady’s white roses in tissue paper, taking off his celluloid collar and wearing his rattiest hat."|"Carter Beats the Devil"|"Glen David Gold"
03:00|"three A.M."|"The only performance that he considered at length was at the Boston Keith’s theatre. Houdini. “Last night,” Carter wrote James, “I saw the most famous man in the world give what I suppose is a typical performance. It is now three A.M. and I am still trying to comprehend what I saw: a short, muscular man with a precise way of speaking, like a Dutchman who speaks the Queen’s English, in a dirty tuxedo—I was in Row S, and I could see soot on him—botching ten minutes of card tricks before tossing the deck aside and getting to the real business: being Houdini. Have I mentioned that he is the most famous man in the world? He did, for ten minutes. ‘Ladies and Gentlemen, George Bernard Shaw said that the three most famous men in the history of the world are Jesus Christ, Sherlock Holmes, and Houdini. Only one of us could be here tonight. . . .’ He listed all of the things he has escaped from in the last twelvemonth: handcuffs, straitjacket, sea bag, jail cell, convict ship, crazy crib, coffin, glass box, padlocked case, giant football, witch’s chair, chains, ropes, etc. Then he explained, for another ten minutes, all the old stories of how many foolish imitators he has destroyed. ‘If you are a handcuff king, beware of me,’ he said, ‘for I am unveiling a new weapon.’ Then he showed a motion picture show of him jumping manacled into the Mississippi River and escaping and then construction crews roping him to a girder of the Heidelberg Tower in Manhattan; he escaped that, too."|"Carter Beats the Devil"|"Glen David Gold"
12:00|noon|"The curtain was raised and the boiler was shown still to be riveted shut. Applause continued throughout the demonstration, with calls for Houdini finally answered when the manager announced that Houdini had been taken to the hospital due to the exertions of the escape. If people wanted to see him again, he would be escaping from a giant lightbulb, provided by the Edison Power Company, at noon the next day."|"Carter Beats the Devil"|"Glen David Gold"
"ap 07:30"|seven-thirty|"“You sleep at the hotel with Mysterioso.” She took out a cigarette. “What time is it?”
“Maybe seven-thirty.”
She put the cigarette back. “What are you doing here at the crack of dawn, anyway?”"|"Carter Beats the Devil"|"Glen David Gold"
04:00|"4 a.m."|"In bed that night, he fell into a restless sleep, waking at 4 a.m. with a disappointed, fading feeling: he’d dreamed of a new illusion Annabelle had performed. Unfortunately, it was a variation on a Robert-Houdin device, hardly original. Worse, it was a spiteful kind of trick, unworthy of consideration. Nonetheless, he sketched it in his notes and returned to bed."|"Carter Beats the Devil"|"Glen David Gold"
05:00|"5 A.M."|"At 5 A.M. Carter dashed to the telegraph office, waking the operator in order to send a wire to the Martinkas. An emergency order. Three more optical mirrors. Another winch and pulley. Black magic, yards and yards of it. A flash pot. A table with a steel trap built in. A platform, hinged. And modify the aga to an asrah, hang the expense."|"Carter Beats the Devil"|"Glen David Gold"
17:00|"5 P.M."|"The Orpheum was thus sparkling and clean on the opening evening of week twenty-seven, when the tour came into town. When Carter entered the dressing room at 5 P.M. he found an envelope at his dressing table. His name and the theatre address were written on the outside in a wispy and sweet hand, and inside was a photograph, rather small, the size of a trade card. On the back, in the same blue ink as on the envelope: “Good luck, Mr. Carter.” It was signed Sarah O’Leary."|"Carter Beats the Devil"|"Glen David Gold"
"ap 06:30"|6:30|"Carter peered through the curtains at 6:30. For the only time on the circuit, the entire audience was seated before the first act, Colonel Munson’s Russo-Chinese Flyers, began their acrobatic feats. No one wanted to miss a tradition at the San Francisco Orpheum: the late arrivals of Jessie Hayman and Tessie Wall. The center sections of rows G and H had been set aside, ushers turning back the few nitwits who tried to take the seats."|"Carter Beats the Devil"|"Glen David Gold"
"ap 07:15"|7:15|"It was 7:15. Carter had exactly an hour before he had to be onstage, and a task that would take about twenty minutes, if he hurried."|"Carter Beats the Devil"|"Glen David Gold"
"ap 07:40"|7:40|"Chase had the misfortune of going on at 7:40. Though he’d worked hard on his program of Shakespearean monologues—he even added a wickedly insightful Henry Irving parody—he was but politely acknowledged. It was apparent he would be offered just a standard contract for next season."|"Carter Beats the Devil"|"Glen David Gold"
"ap 07:57"|"three minutes till eight"|"At three minutes till eight, Laszlo and His Yankee Hussars set up onstage. While the band played their Sousa medley, Carter thoroughly checked his kit, stuffing his pockets with scarves, examining the seals on decks of cards. He glanced toward his levitation device."|"Carter Beats the Devil"|"Glen David Gold"
"ap 08:15"|8:15|"At 8:15, the orchestra played Carter’s theme, “Pomp and Circumstance,” and Carter went onstage to prolonged applause. He focused on his breathing, in and out, fifteen times a minute, standing in front of his trusty flats decorated with demons and flying cards. The main curtain was behind him, and a set of Chinese screens surrounded the levitation device. He thanked the audience, saying, “It is a great joy to return to the old neighborhood,” which led, of course, to a second round of applause. He breathed deeply through his nose, smelling the curls of smoke coming off the fresh gels on the footlights. Though the overhead lights hurt his eyes, he could see unusually far into the house tonight, from the elegance of the men and women in the orchestra pit to the third balcony, where men who wore their hats indoors and women in 1908 Sears, Roebuck catalogue finery fanned themselves with programs. Carter did not look toward his parents’ box. He thought about the card Sarah had sent, and wondered if she might be in the house, watching him."|"Carter Beats the Devil"|"Glen David Gold"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"At ten o’clock, the kettle drums began their thrilling, tribal beat, and the stage filled with Mysterioso’s stilt-walkers and fire-eaters. A half dozen Indians swooped down on them, whooping and hollering, out for blood. Carter dropped, one by one, his coins, cards, scarves, bouquets, and hard rubber balls into the barrel. He brought his thumb before his face, and whispered, “My flexor longus pollicis and its so-very-important terminal phalange.” He cleaned his nails with his lock picks."|"Carter Beats the Devil"|"Glen David Gold"
"< 00:00"|"before midnight"|"The dancers filed offstage to remove their paint, except for Annabelle, who was still in her frilly white dress. She settled down by the lion’s cage to roll a smoke. Stagehands tore down the scenery, and a crowd formed around Houdini, who had already taken out a stack of cream-colored calling cards, which he had presigned, “Best—Houdini!!!” As people approached him, he passed them the cards instead of engaging in conversation. He tossed a set of keys to some of Mysterioso’s men, and told them that if they wanted to free their boss before midnight, they should start now."|"Carter Beats the Devil"|"Glen David Gold"
08:00|"8 A.M."|"Back in the restaurant, Albee had Carter sign a napkin—they would have proper contracts drawn up tomorrow—and then Carter made a list of all his new responsibilities. He had a messenger (he now had access to the Keith-Orpheum messenger service) run to the Ferry building, where the troupe was housed, to alert them to a special 8 A.M. meeting to discuss the show. There were a thousand other details to deal with, but for now, his mood remained happy disbelief."|"Carter Beats the Devil"|"Glen David Gold"
01:30|"one-thirty in the morning"|"The question was good enough to bring Carter as far as the front stairs of 44 Mason, Jessie Hayman’s Georgian mansion. The first time Carter looked at the watch, it was one-thirty in the morning. The night air was warm. He could hear girlish laughter and piano music. Someone was playing “Waltz Me Around Again, Willie” at dizzying speed. He weighed whether he should go in or catch a taxi home. He was not the type of man to visit a parlorhouse girl. But he was wide awake, and felt perfectly capable of having just one drink and leaving."|"Carter Beats the Devil"|"Glen David Gold"
04:03|"4:03 in the morning"|"When some hours had passed, Carter pulled back the lever at the bottom of his watch. It chimed. It was the first time he’d heard it, melodious, rich, surprisingly full: four bells, a pause, then three airy bells, sounding, yes, just like angels playing them. How had it gotten to be 4:03 in the morning? He was still on the couch. Julius had gone upstairs long ago. Leonard had disappeared briefly three times, each time with a different girl, but an hour ago he’d left for the evening with Gladys, who had chestnut hair down to her waist. Adolph had made a comic scene of being unable to decide among the women who remained, gnashing his teeth and making faces, finally scooping up a small blond Russian girl, and, hollering like a wildman, dashing up the stairs with her."|"Carter Beats the Devil"|"Glen David Gold"
04:00|"four o’clock in the morning"|"This left Carter. It was four o’clock in the morning, he hadn’t had a drink in over an hour, and he felt like the evening had wound down around him. He was the only man in a room of ten women. He noticed their yawns, their smiles when he met their eyes, their occasional glances toward the window—Jessie didn’t allow clocks in her house, but, from certain angles, you could see the clocktower across the square. Someone cranked up the gramophone, and two tall girls danced together to the second movement of a Vivaldi lute concerto."|"Carter Beats the Devil"|"Glen David Gold"
05:30|"5:30 in the morning"|"He crossed to the window that faced the street, and he pulled back the draperies, which were damask, and smelled of burnt wood. Outside, it was silent and the rarest of San Francisco dawns: no fog. He could see, between the rooftops, just one spire of St. Boniface’s Cathedral. It was lovely. He and Annabelle were alone together. It was 5:30 in the morning. “Would you take a walk with me?” he asked."|"Carter Beats the Devil"|"Glen David Gold"
04:00|"four in the morning"|"She told him she was from Lawrenceville, Kansas, which was flat, so she was unimpressed with all the uphill hiking required in San Francisco. As they went up Columbus, he pointed out the new buildings, and the gaping, vacant lots awaiting new structures. He described all the beautiful things now gone: parks, monuments, ramshackle houses, playgrounds, amusement parks, all destroyed five years ago. But Carter remembered them. “When I was ten and eleven, I often couldn’t sleep. I would wake at four in the morning and I’d be so excited I had to go for a walk. So I left the house and walked miles and miles in a straight line, down Washington Street, right to the Barbary Coast.”"|"Carter Beats the Devil"|"Glen David Gold"
12:00|midday|"Once upon a time, Jack Griffin had been lean and hungry enough to slither down a chimney, and had in fact done so in 1901 on his first assignment, in Mochnacz Flats, Cleveland. It was a terrible area, home to the dregs of the melting pot, dangerous even in midday, and he went there alone, at midnight. His mission was to eavesdrop on a meeting held on the top floor of a boardinghouse on the corner of Broadway and Fleet."|"Carter Beats the Devil"|"Glen David Gold"

00:00|midnight|"Late in the evening of Sunday, August fifth, Griffin was on his bed in his undershirt, suspenders hanging in loops by his sides, when he heard a clatter in the other room of his suite. He had been playing solitaire, about to start his midnight-to-4-A.M. shift at Room 8064, and he held a card face up, suddenly unable to recall what play he’d just made. Had he only imagined the noise? Perhaps a new agent had shipped in or, more likely, one of the men knew the room next door was empty, and had elected to take an unauthorized nap. Griffin threw down the cards. He wasn’t going to let someone slack off."|"Carter Beats the Devil"|"Glen David Gold"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"In the hallway, Griffin looked at his notes, where he read the name that was supposed to unravel Carter’s past: Olive White, of the San Francisco Public Library newspaper morgue. Another job for him that required sitting in a room and flipping papers. He found a pay phone and called her number. A woman, friendly to the point of near frenzy, told him the library was officially closed for renovations, but as long as he didn’t mind a little dust and noise, he could literally have the library to himself beginning at, say, two o’clock? He told her that would be fine."|"Carter Beats the Devil"|"Glen David Gold"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"It was close to two o’clock, and he was suddenly aware of the onions in the meat loaf he’d eaten. He had in his breast pocket a tin of German peppermints, “PEZ—for the relief of toothache, tobacco breath, and fatigue,” and as he left the Automat, he sucked on one, concerned whether it was the right thing to do. PEZ had shipped a crate of peppermints to every military camp and Secret Service office, gratis, explaining it in an accompanying pamphlet as “our way to new friend making.” The company added that “if soldiers and police put our product to use, the rest of America will show for us much respect.” So there were boxes of PEZ everywhere, but they made Griffin, who knew nothing was free, uneasy. If Wilson had still been President, he would have ordered the candy shipped back to Germany. Everything, when you scratched the surface, could end up being a conspiracy, maybe malicious, maybe just to turn a profit."|"Carter Beats the Devil"|"Glen David Gold"

How to approach him, and what sort might he be, and was he the sort to license his invention to a magician? Carter had specific plans that went vague in places, so thinking about them late at night had left him nervous. Around 2 A.M., he began flipping through the latest several numbers of the Sphinx—never a good idea for relaxing, as the gossip columns usually detailed who was ahead of him, and who was fast approaching from below."|"Carter Beats the Devil"|"Glen David Gold"

Carter had never noticed what an excellent and well-paved boulevard Fourth was, with tree-lined curves and ever-broadening glimpses of the bay. Coming to see Borax, he was excited and nervous anyway, the way he was supposed to feel when visiting kings and princes, and he wished his ride could last a little longer. But he had to arrive before Philo did—if he did—and so, at three minutes till noon, he arrived at the gates of Arbor Villa."|"Carter Beats the Devil"|"Glen David Gold"
12:00|noon|"He sat on his motorcycle under the shade of a pepper tree. He produced a cigarette and smoked it until he heard a weak pop, like a distant champagne cork—the Arbor Villa noon cannon.

I didn’t bring it in the first place. You couldn’t, I don’t care if you’re the President, you couldn’t pay me to move hootch inside this hotel. I get fired, and you know who comes after me?

By the time the campanile chimed five o’clock, Pem counted 110 people, which caused her to jump up and down behind the side curtain until she regained her composure. Philo for his part looked glum and pale.

Instead, every square inch of space was covered with three sheets and eight sheets and even one spectacular twenty-four sheet, all of them showing in various sizes exactly the same image: on a deep blue background, so blue it was almost black, a warmly colored man in turban and tails, his smile dazzlingly white, his right palm extended, and in it a box that displayed a futuristic-looking clear globe capped with a yellow and orange halo of flames.

He entered the barracks and awoke the pilot, who’d been napping on his cot, and asked the groggy man how fast he could get to San Francisco. Half-awake, the pilot began his speech about how safe flying was and how many combat missions he’d flown in France—all Jenny pilots had exactly the same story, and it was built to suss out how much they could gouge their passenger—stopping only when Griffin started counting out ten-dollar bills."|"Carter Beats the Devil"|"Glen David Gold"
