“What train? There hasn’t been no train since the 3:14.”
“There was a train here just now. I got out of it. The boat express.”"|"Murder Is Easy"|"Agatha Christie"

“Reckon,” said the porter. “You’d best go on by the 4:25.”
“If the 4:25 goes to London,” said Luke, “the 4:25 is the train for me.”"|"Murder Is Easy"|"Agatha Christie"

"ap > 11:00"|"after eleven o’clock"|"“No. She stayed out after hours playing about with some young man. Gordon has very moral and old-fashioned views. Sin in his view does not take place until after eleven o’clock, but then it is rampant. So he gave the girl notice and she was impertinent about it!”"|"Murder Is Easy"|"Agatha Christie"
"~ 01:00"|"about one in the morning"|"“Dr. Thomas. And he gave her the bottle of cough mixture that she brought back with her. Something quite harmless, a stock mixture, I believe. She went to bed early and it must have been about one in the morning when the noise began—an awful kind of choking scream. I got up and went to her door but it was locked on the inside. I called to her but couldn’t get any answer. Cook was with me and we were both terribly upset. And then we went to the front door and luckily there was Reed (our constable) just passing on his beat, and we called to him. He went round the back of the house and managed to climb up on the outhouse roof, and as her window was open he got in quite easily that way and unlocked the door. Poor girl, it was terrible. They couldn’t do anything for her, and she died in Hospital a few hours later.”"|"Murder Is Easy"|"Agatha Christie"
00:00|midnight|"“Now the others. Amy Gibbs. Why did Ellsworthy kill Amy Gibbs? The obvious reason—she was being a nuisance! Threatened an action for breach of promise, perhaps? Or had she assisted at a midnight orgy? Did she threaten to talk? Lord Whitfield has a good deal of influence in Wychwood and Lord Whitfield, according to Bridget, is a very moral man. He might have taken up the matter against Ellsworthy if the latter had been up to anything particularly obscene. So—exit Amy. Not, I think, a sadistic murder. The method employed is against that."|"Murder Is Easy"|"Agatha Christie"
"~ 00:00"|"about midnight"|"“Who’s next—Carter? Why Carter? Unlikely he would know about midnight orgies (or did Amy tell him?). Was the pretty daughter mixed up in it? Did Ellsworthy start making love to her? (Must have a look at Lucy Carter.) Perhaps he was just abusive to Ellsworthy, and Ellsworthy in his catlike feline way, resented it. If he’d already committed one or two murders he would be getting sufficiently callous to contemplate a killing for a very slight reason."|"Murder Is Easy"|"Agatha Christie"
00:00|midnight|"“Now Tommy Pierce. Why did Ellsworthy kill Tommy Pierce? Easy. Tommy had assisted at a midnight ritual of some kind. Tommy threatened to talk about it. Perhaps Tommy was talking about it. Shut Tommy’s mouth."|"Murder Is Easy"|"Agatha Christie"

There was a street accident took place on Derby Day between five and six o’clock in the afternoon. Old lady run over in Whitehall and the car didn’t stop. Her name was Lavinia Pinkerton. I want you to dig up all facts you can about that.”"|"Murder Is Easy"|"Agatha Christie"
