"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"It was one o’clock and Leamas was hungry, so he walked over to where Liz Gold was sorting and said:"|"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"|"John le Carre"
"ap 02:30"|"half past two"|"It was half past two when he came back. He smelt of whisky. He had one carrier bag full of vegetables and another containing groceries. He put them down in a corner of the alcove and wearily began again on the archaeology books. He’d been marking for about ten minutes when he became aware that Miss Crail was watching him."|"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"|"John le Carre"
"ap 05:30"|"half past five"|"At exactly half past five Miss Crail put on her coat and, with a pointed: ‘Good night, Miss Gold’, left. Leamas guessed she had been brooding on the carrier bags all afternoon. He went in to the next alcove where Liz Gold was sitting on the bottom rung of her ladder reading what looked like a tract. When she saw Leamas she dropped it guiltily into her handbag and stood up."|"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"|"John le Carre"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"At six o’clock she locked up and gave the keys to the curator, a very old man with First War shellshock who, said Liz, sat awake all night in case the Germans made a counterattack. It was bitterly cold outside."|"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"|"John le Carre"
17:00|"five o’clock that evening"|"About three weeks after Leamas began work at the library Liz asked him to supper. She pretended it was an idea that had come to her quite suddenly, at five o’clock that evening; she seemed to realise that if she were to ask him for tomorrow or the next day he would forget or just not come, so she asked him at five o’clock. Leamas seemed reluctant to accept, but in the end he did."|"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"|"John le Carre"

05:00|"five in the morning"|"She made him stay that night and they became lovers. He left at five in the morning. She couldn’t understand it; she was so proud and he seemed ashamed."|"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"|"John le Carre"
"ap 11:30"|"half-past eleven"|"Then one day about a week later, he didn’t come to the library. Miss Crail was delighted; by half-past eleven she had told her mother, and on returning from lunch she stood in front of the archaeology shelves where he had been working since he came. She stared with theatrical concentration at the rows of books and Liz knew she was pretending to work out whether Leamas had stolen anything."|"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"|"John le Carre"
"ap 08:30"|"half past eight"|"Then she felt ashamed, because she knew she should have cleaned and tidied. Jumping up, she fetched the carpet sweeper and a duster from the kitchen, and set to work with feverish energy. She found a clean teacloth and spread it neatly on the bedside table and she washed up the odd cups and saucers which lay around the kitchen. When everything was done she looked at her watch and it was half past eight. She put the kettle on and went back to the bed. Leamas was looking at her."|"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"|"John le Carre"
"ap < 04:00"|"nearly four o’clock"|"It was nearly four o’clock before they ordered the bill and Leamas tried to insist on paying his half. Ashe wouldn’t hear of it, paid the bill and took out his cheque book in order to settle his debt to Leamas."|"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"|"John le Carre"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"‘My dear chap, I wouldn’t dream of it! You’d have to go to Rotherhithe to cash this one!’ Leamas shrugged and Ashe laughed, and they agreed to meet at the same place on the following day, at one o’clock, when Ashe would have the money in cash."|"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"|"John le Carre"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"Ashe took a cab at the corner of Compton Street, and Leamas waved at it until it was out of sight. When it was gone, he looked at his watch. It was four o’clock. He guessed he was still being followed, so he walked down to Fleet Street and had a cup of coffee in the Black and White. He looked at bookshops, read the evening papers displayed in the show windows of newspaper offices, and then quite suddenly, as if the thought had occurred to him at the last minute, he jumped on a bus. The bus went to Ludgate Hill, where it was held up in a traffic jam near a tube station; he dismounted and caught a tube. He bought a sixpenny ticket, stood in the end carriage and alighted at the next station. He caught another train to Euston, trekked back to Charing Cross. It was nine o’clock when he reached the station and it had turned rather cold. There was a van waiting in the forecourt; the driver was fast asleep. Leamas glanced at the number, went over and called through the window:"|"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"|"John le Carre"

"ap ~ 04:30"|"about four-thirty"|"‘I spend the weekends with my mother in Cheltenham,’ he said. ‘I just use this place mid-week. It’s pretty handy,’ he added deprecatingly.

"ap 09:45"|"nine forty-five"|"‘I took the liberty of obtaining one for you,’ Kiever replied suavely; nothing in his voice or his manner indicated that he had done other than negotiate an adequate business arrangement. ‘We’re flying to the Hague tomorrow morning at nine forty-five. Shall we go back to my flat and discuss any other details?’"|"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"|"John le Carre"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"Leamas was woken by the telephone at his bedside. It was Kiever.
‘It’s six o’clock,’ he said, ‘breakfast at half past.’
‘All right,’ Leamas replied, and rang off. He had a headache."|"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"|"John le Carre"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"Kiever must have telephoned for a taxi because at seven o’clock the door bell rang and Kiever asked, ‘Got everything?’"|"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"|"John le Carre"

"ap ~ 11:00"|"about eleven o’clock"|"Peters didn’t appear that afternoon, nor the next morning. Leamas stayed in, waiting with growing irritation for some message, but none came. He asked the housekeeper but she just smiled and shrugged her heavy shoulders. At about eleven o’clock the next morning he decided to go out for a walk along the front, bought some cigarettes and stared dully at the sea."|"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"|"John le Carre"
"ap 23:45"|"quarter to twelve"|"He made a detour and returned to the bungalow at a quarter to twelve. The woman let him in without a word, but when he had gone into the back room he heard her lift the receiver and dial a telephone number. She only spoke for a few seconds. At half past twelve she brought him lunch, and, to his pleasure, some English newspapers, which he read contentedly until three o’clock. Leamas who normally read nothing, read newspapers slowly and with concentration. He remembered details, like the names and addresses of people who were the subject of small news items. He did it almost unconsciously as a kind of private pelmanism, and it absorbed him entirely."|"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"|"John le Carre"

"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"They’d all laughed then, Guillam too. It had seemed a good joke at the time; good by Control’s standards anyway.
It must have been after midnight.
For some time they had been travelling an unmade road, partly through a wood and partly across open country. Now they stopped and a moment later the DKW drew up beside them. As he and Peters got out Leamas noticed that there were now three people in the second car. Two were already getting out. The third was sitting in the back seat looking at some papers by the light from the car roof, a slight figure half in shadow."|"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"|"John le Carre"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"The lights in the annexe were controlled from some central point. They were put on and off by an unseen hand. In the mornings he was often woken by the sudden blaze of the single overhead light in his room. At night he would be hastened to bed by perfunctory darkness. It was only nine o’clock as he entered the annexe, and the lights were already out. Usually they stayed on till eleven, but now they were out and the shutters had been lowered. He had left the connecting door from the house open, so that the pale twilight from the hallway reached, but scarcely penetrated, the guards’ bedroom, and by it he could just see the two empty beds. As he stood there peering into the room, surprised to find it empty, the door behind him closed. Perhaps by itself, but Leamas made no attempt to open it. It was pitch dark. No sound accompanied the closing of the door, no click nor footstep."|"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"|"John le Carre"

She could scarcely concentrate on the speaker, and when she tried he used long German compounds that she couldn’t work out anyway. It was like the meetings in Bayswater, it was like mid-week evensong when she used to go to church—the same dutiful, little group of host faces, the same fussy self-consciousness, the same feeling of a great idea in the hands of little people. She always felt the same thing—it was awful, really, but she did—she wished no one would turn up, because that was absolute and it suggested persecution, humiliation—it was something you could react to."|"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"|"John le Carre"
17:00|"five in the evening"|"She had no idea what time it was when she heard the footsteps in the corridor outside her cell. It could have been five in the evening—it could have been midnight. She had been awake, staring blankly into the pitch darkness, longing for a sound. She had never imagined that silence could be so terrible. Once she had cried out, and there had been no echo, nothing. Just the memory of her own voice. She had visualised the sound breaking against the solid darkness like a fist against a rock. She had moved her hands about her as she sat on the bed, and it seemed to her that the darkness made them heavy, as if she were groping in the water. She knew the cell was small; that it contained the bed on which she sat, a handbasin without taps and a crude table: she had seen them when she first entered. Then the light had gone out, and she had run wildly to where she knew the bed had stood, and struck it with her shins, and had remained there, shivering with fright. Until she heard the footsteps, and the door of her cell was opened abruptly."|"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"|"John le Carre"
