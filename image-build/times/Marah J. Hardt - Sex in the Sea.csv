12:00|noontime|"At the end of the day, the two tactics work to secure fertilizations with a female under very different circumstances. Arriving slightly ahead of the females each day, a supermale first aggressively chases away all other males from a favored spot. Then he welcomes the females with vigorous vibrations of his pectoral fins and a few dashes up in the water column. A female impressed with both his location and his moves will join in one of these upward surges. The pair will swim almost belly to belly and simultaneously release their sperm and eggs into the upper waters. Successful TP males have been known to exceed 150 matings in a single day—which is even more impressive given they don’t spawn all twenty-four hours long—these fish tend to be noontime lovers."|"Sex in the Sea"|"Marah J.

"ap ~ 01:10"|"about 1:10"|"That’s not to say some enormous phalluses don’t exist. But to truly appreciate their scale we need to consider length related to the size of the owner. Looking at this ratio evens the playing field between, say, barnacles and blue whales, allowing for far more colorful comparisons. For example, a one-hundred-foot blue whale with a ten-foot penis has a penis-to-body ratio of about 1:10. People, on the other hand, come in at about 1:13, assuming average human penis length (erect or stretched out flaccid) is about five to six inches and assuming a six-foot-tall male. So blue whales have us beat, but not by much. Move into invertebrate territory, however, and it’s a whole different ball game."|"Sex in the Sea"|"Marah J. Hardt"

Everyone is quiet, faces buried behind tattered paperbacks or fixated on tiny, glowing smartphone screens. An old lady rests heavily in the seat closest to the door; a young, slender woman wedges between two mountainous men hidden behind their newspapers."|"Sex in the Sea"|"Marah J. Hardt"
19:00|"seven p.m."|"One of the visionaries behind this effort is Barton Seaver, a chef and National Geographic fellow who has proven that using lesser-known varieties of seafood in creative ways can work—in terms of taste, sustainability, and economics. One night a few years ago, Seaver’s local supplier unexpectedly delivered a box of flying fish—the day’s bait—rather than the day’s anticipated catch to his popular DC restaurant, Hook. When pressed for an explanation, the supplier simply said it was a “bad day” for fishing. So, Seaver whipped up a delicious sauce, instructed his wait staff to tell the story about the fish, and promptly sold out of the dish by seven p.m. that night—at $26 per plate."|"Sex in the Sea"|"Marah J.
