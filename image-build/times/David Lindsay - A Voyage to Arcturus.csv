"ap 08:00"|"eight o'clock"|"On a march evening, at eight o'clock, Backhouse, the medium - a fast - rising star in the psychic world - was ushered into the study at Prolands, the Hampstead residence of Montague Faull. The room was illuminated only by the light of a blazing fire. The host, eying him with indolent curiosity, got up, and the usual conventional greetings were exchanged. Having indicated an easy chair before the fire to his guest, the South American merchant sank back again into his own. The electric light was switched on. Faull's prominent, clear - cut features, metallic - looking skin, and general air of bored impassiveness, did not seem greatly to impress the medium, who was accustomed to regard men from a special angle. Backhouse, on the contrary, was a novelty to the merchant. As he tranquilly studied him through half closed lids and the smoke of a cigar, he wondered how this little, thickset person with the pointed beard contrived to remain so fresh and sane in appearance, in view of the morbid nature of his occupation."|"A Voyage to Arcturus"|"David Lindsay"
"ap 09:00"|"Nine o'clock"|""" Afterward will do quite well. ""
"" Nine o'clock was the time specified, I believe? ""
"" I fancy so. """|"A Voyage to Arcturus"|"David Lindsay"
14:00|"two o'clock in the afternoon"|"A couple of days later, at two o'clock in the afternoon, Maskull and Nightspore arrived at Starkness Observatory, having covered the seven miles from Haillar Station on foot. The road, very wild and lonely, ran for the greater part of the way near the edge of rather lofty cliffs, within sight of the North Sea. The sun shone, but a brisk cast wind was blowing and the air was salt and cold. The dark green waves were flecked with white. Through out the walk, they were accompanied by the plaintive, beautiful crying of the gulls."|"A Voyage to Arcturus"|"David Lindsay"
"ap > 03:00"|"past three o'clock"|"It was by this time past three o'clock. Feeling hungry, for they had eaten nothing since early morning, Maskull went downstairs to forage, but without much hope of finding anything in the shape of food. In a safe in the kitchen he discovered a bag of mouldy oatmeal, which was untouchable, a quantity of quite good tea in an airtight caddy, and an unopened can of ox tongue. Best of all, in the dining - room cupboard he came across an uncorked bottle of first - class Scotch whisky. He at once made preparations for a scratch meal."|"A Voyage to Arcturus"|"David Lindsay"
"ap > 06:00"|"past six"|"Maskull pulled out his watch automatically, and looked at the time. It was past six.. .. But he was thinking of Nightspore's words, and not of the time."|"A Voyage to Arcturus"|"David Lindsay"
12:00|midday|"The day surged up. It was too misty for direct sunshine, but before long the brilliance of the light was already greater than that of the midday sun on earth. The heat, too, was intense, but Maskull welcomed it - it relieved his pain and diminished his sense of crushing weight. The wind had dropped with the rising of the sun."|"A Voyage to Arcturus"|"David Lindsay"
"< 12:00"|"before midday"|"She pressed his arm, while a score of unpaintable, delicate hues stained her cheeks in rapid transition. "" Please don't say any more about it, Maskull. It makes me feel unpleasant. ""
"" Very well. But can we possibly get there before midday? ""
"" Oh, yes. And you mustn't be frightened at the distance. We think nothing of long distances here - we have so much to think about and feel. Time goes all too quickly. """|"A Voyage to Arcturus"|"David Lindsay"
"<< 00:00"|"Long before midnight"|"Branchspell set, the day faded, night with its terrible weight came on, and through it all Maskull slept. Long before midnight, however, he was awakened by a crimson glow in the sky. He opened his eyes, and wondered where he was. He felt heaviness and pain. The red glow was a terrestrial phenomenon; it came from among the trees. He got up and went toward the source of the light."|"A Voyage to Arcturus"|"David Lindsay"
00:00|midnight|"At midnight, when Teargeld was in the south, throwing his shadow straight toward the sea and making everything nearly as bright as day, he saw a great tree floating in the water, not far out. It was thirty feet out of the water, upright, and alive, and its roots must have been enormously deep and wide. It was drifting along the coast, through the heavy seas. Maskull eyed it incuriously for a few minutes. Then it dawned on him that it might be a good thing to investigate its nature. Without stopping to weigh the danger, he immediately swam out, caught hold of the lowest branch, and swung himself up."|"A Voyage to Arcturus"|"David Lindsay"
"< 12:00"|"before noon"|""" Come, get on, get on! "" said Krag, laughing uncouthly. "" The morning's wearing away, and you have to die before noon. We are going to the Ocean. """|"A Voyage to Arcturus"|"David Lindsay"
