"ap ~ 10:15"|"about ten-fifteen"|"It was about ten-fifteen, and Terry was at work. Seven years younger than I, he could still go out drinking all night, get completely smashed, and jump out of bed the next morning and go to work. I could drink only when I had nothing to do the next day. I'm three-quarters Irish, which should have blessed me with a high tolerance, but the infrequency of my drinking has lowered my defenses. As my eldest brother remarks whenever we go out for a drink, I am a lightweight. The word sits in his mouth like a spoonful of spoiled mayonnaise. The fact that I can drink only one beer to his three is pitiable. How I struggle through life with this infirmity, he can't fathom."|"The Kid"|"Dan Savage"
"~ 04:00"|"about four in the morning"|"At about four in the morning, I clicked to one last site, “ Personality and Learning Traits of FAS/FAE Children,” promising myself it would be the last one I'd read tonight. After this, I would go back to bed or surf some porn. But first, I would read about the personality traits of FAS children. At the top of the page, the site warned that FAS/FAE children may exhibit one or all of these personality traits, and that some FAS/FAE children showed symptoms that weren't yet listed."|"The Kid"|"Dan Savage"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"I thanked Melissa and Laurie and said that Terry was getting off work at ten tonight, and we would sit down and make a decision."|"The Kid"|"Dan Savage"
"< 00:00"|"almost midnight"|"We both let out loud sighs, and sipped our drinks. I held out my arm for Terry, showing him the gooseflesh. Terry picked up my notebook and walked over to the pay phone. It was almost midnight, and when Terry called the agency he got someone at their live twenty-four-hour answering service. He left a message for Laurie, telling her we wanted to go ahead with this placement, and that she should tell Melissa yes. Then he came back to the booth and sat down beside me."|"The Kid"|"Dan Savage"
"ap 00:30"|twelve-thirty|"Our second meeting was less awkward than the first. Melissa's dog was chained up on the porch of Outside In, and she was inside arranging for someone to watch her cat while she visited with us. Today her belly was noticeably larger, and when we walked up the porch steps she looked us up and down before she said hey. She didn't smile, but she didn't seem upset either. She seemed businesslike. Her twelve-thirty had arrived, and she was clearing her schedule for the rest of the afternoon."|"The Kid"|"Dan Savage"
"ap ~ 03:00"|"about three o'clock"|"It was about three o'clock, and the place was practically deserted. A few late lunchers were scattered at tables around the dining room. I asked again for a table, locking eyes with the hostess, doing my best rendition of one of my mother's looks: I was smiling, but don't-fuck-with-me waves emanated from me. One look and our hostess knew there'd be an ugly scene if she tried to stick us in a table at the rear or tell us the kitchen was closed."|"The Kid"|"Dan Savage"
"ap 03:00"|three|"Instead of offering to pay her fine, I brought up my arrest record. At three different ACT-UP demonstrations in the early nineties, I was hauled away in handcuffs, once from the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol. Along with two hundred others, I was arrested, held for ten hours in a room with no food, water, or toilets, and ordered to appear in court two weeks later. Two days later, though, I was back at home, with no intention of returning to Washington, D.C., until I'd been elected to Congress."|"The Kid"|"Dan Savage"
"ap 02:25"|"twenty-five after two"|"On our way up the hill to OHSU, we got lost and had to double back. Finally we found the entrance and parked. The building with the maternity ward was built into the side of the hill, and the ground-level entrance from the parking lot side was on the ninth floor. Melissa was on the fourteenth. Still worried that no hospital would let someone as grubby as me near a newborn, I insisted we stop in a bathroom so I could clean up. While Terry waited beside me and Melissa pushed five floors up—I washed my face, shaved, flossed, and brushed my teeth. Terry looked at his watch: twenty-five after two. Almost four hours had passed between Laurie's phone call and our walking through the hospital door."|"The Kid"|"Dan Savage"
14:26|"two-twenty-six P.M."|"“Melissa had her baby a few minutes ago,” she said, “at two-twenty-six P.M. Melissa and the baby are doing fine.” She showed us to a waiting area; we'd be able to see Melissa in a few minutes. The waiting area was by the elevators; I wasn't sure how we'd managed to miss it. It had an information desk, several couches, and a couple of television sets tuned to the Saturday afternoon sports programs. Golf. The nurse told us the doctor would be out in a few minutes, pointed to a pot of coffee and told us to make ourselves comfortable. We plopped down on a couch. It was now 2:36. At the moment the baby was born, Terry and I were in a bathroom, Terry watching me shave. Not that it made any difference where we were, since Melissa hadn't wanted us in the birthing room. We had to be somewhere, so why not a bathroom? We'd spent our first moments alone together in the bathroom of a gay bar."|"The Kid"|"Dan Savage"

"ap ~ 08:00"|"about eight o'clock"|"At about eight o'clock, a nurse came in to check on us and the baby. She listened to the baby's heart, and said, “Hmm . . .” We were all a little troubled by the sound of that “hmm.” The baby had a heart murmur. She told us not to worry—too much: many babies are born with slight heart murmurs, and most disappear in twenty-four hours. But this was a particularly loud murmur, so she thought a pediatric cardiologist should drop by. She didn't want to panic us, she said, she just wanted an infant heart specialist to come and “give this a listen.” The fact that she didn't want to panic us naturally put all of us in a panic."|"The Kid"|"Dan Savage"
"ap 01:00"|"One o'clock"|"We were both too nervous to eat our bagels, so we took our drinks and headed back up to the maternity ward. Melissa's room was near the end of a long hallway, and about fifteen feet past her door was a window seat with a tremendous view of Portland and the Willamette River. We sat, drank our Cokes, and waited. And waited. One o'clock came and went. Laurie said the signing would take a half an hour, and soon ninety minutes had passed."|"The Kid"|"Dan Savage"
"ap ~ 01:00"|"around one o'clock"|"“Melissa wants to be alone with the baby in the morning,” Laurie said. “She has to check out by two, so if you guys came in around one o'clock that would be good.” Laurie would be available to Melissa all morning, in case she needed to talk, but otherwise Melissa would be alone with the baby."|"The Kid"|"Dan Savage"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o'clock"|"When we'd come in with dinner, Melissa said she was worried that David would show up and there wouldn't be enough food to go around. She was sure he'd come tonight. When eleven o'clock came and went, and David still hadn't shown up, Melissa's mood got darker. Melissa and David weren't involved, nothing romantic; she had taken him in, and spoke of him with the same weary affection with which she spoke of her other animals. Like the dog and the cat, David was her responsibility. Melissa had updated us on him whenever we visited: he had a job, he'd lost a job, he was on crystal, he was off crystal. Melissa had never introduced us to him, but we got a look at him when we dropped Melissa off after our visits: he was a skinny kid, good-looking, with intense blue eyes. He'd been living with Melissa since she moved into the apartment, eating her food, and she couldn't understand why David—or any of her other friends—would fail to come see her and the baby. Did her friends get busted? Were her animals okay?"|"The Kid"|"Dan Savage"
"ap 02:00"|two|"“She has to be out tomorrow at two, so you better go up early,” Terry said."|"The Kid"|"Dan Savage"
"ap 01:00"|one|"It was one, and Melissa was supposed to check out at two o'clock, so we had an hour. We sat chatting as if nothing special was going to happen, telling Laurie stories about the last two days: our mad dash down to Portland, the nurse who wanted Melissa to leave right away, that first poopy diaper, getting peed on, last night's steak dinner. Melissa made observations about the baby's eating habits, criticized my diapering, and showed Terry the right way to hold a bottle. We talked about the mall, our hotel, and David's visit. We were all acting as if Laurie had come to pay us a visit, and once she was gone the three of us would go back to lying around, watching TV and taking care of little David Kevin/Daryl Jude Pierce-Miller-Savage."|"The Kid"|"Dan Savage"

"ap 02:00"|"Two o'clock"|"Two o'clock came, and at Laurie's prompting we gave Melissa her I.D. bracelet and a small photo album full of pictures. Laurie said a few words, but none of the rest of us rose to the bait. We were all very quiet. Melissa asked about baby pictures, the kind taken at the hospital immediately after a baby is born. Laurie explained that these cost money and that you had to request them; they weren't taken automatically. Melissa shrugged, disappointed."|"The Kid"|"Dan Savage"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"We'd sent Bacchus a letter telling him where we'd be staying, and told him to give us a call when we got there. We had a number for him where he lived, but it was a pay phone in the hallway and the line was always busy. Shortly after we got to our hotel— a real dump right off Bourbon Street—Bacchus called. He could come over on Saturday or Sunday morning for a few hours, whichever we preferred. Tomorrow, I told him, would be great, in the lobby at ten."|"The Kid"|"Dan Savage"
"ap 09:45"|"quarter to ten"|"At a quarter to ten, I went downstairs, leaving Terry in bed with D.J. On a large leather couch in the lobby, I sat under a gilt mirror and read the paper while I waited for Bacchus. At ten after, a well-dressed young guy in slacks, a button-down shirt, and a black overcoat walked into the lobby. He had D.J.'s hair, the same color blond, but this couldn't be Bacchus, not the way he was dressed. Melissa had told us back in Portland that Bacchus had a mohawk and dressed the way she did. The man stood in the doorway for a second before he saw me looking at him."|"The Kid"|"Dan Savage"
