06:00|"6:00 A.M."|"Jack Merrill’s family lived in suburban Massachusetts. His parents brought him to Little Cranberry Island before he was a year old, and Jack spent his boyhood summers entranced by the island’s rocky beaches, its stands of spruce, and the scent of salt in the air. One day he eagerly accepted an invitation from an old-timer to go lobstering. At 6:00 A.M. the young Jack nearly lost his breakfast walking past the bins of rancid bait on the wharf. But staring straight ahead, he held his breath and made it aboard the old wooden boat and out onto the sparkling sea."|"The Secret Life of Lobsters"|"Trevor Corson"
"~ 07:30"|prime|"That made the bottleneck almost impossibly tight. Yet there was evidence that something made it even tighter. Even when prime cobble was present it could lie barren. Why, for instance, on the eerie island of Damariscove, was the cobble cove facing west home to more babies than anywhere else, while the cobble cove facing east was home to little but ghosts?"|"The Secret Life of Lobsters"|"Trevor Corson"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"Soon it was midsummer and catches slowed as the lobsters went into hiding for the shed. Bruce woke one morning at the leisurely hour of seven o’clock and motored the Double Trouble over to the yacht yard on Mount Desert. Waiting for him was the Travel Lift, a framework of blue girders the size of a house, riding on wheels from a 747 jumbo jet. The straps tightened under the Double Trouble’s hull and raised all eight tons of her from the ocean like a whale in a gurney. Her dripping hull was spotted with algae."|"The Secret Life of Lobsters"|"Trevor Corson"
04:00|"4:00 A.M."|"Bates College indulged Diane’s peculiar form of research, even if she did occasionally show up for class wet and tired after rising at 4:00 A.M. to dig in the mud. A redesign of the curriculum, however, cut the course Diane taught, so she was forced to look for other work. She tried other teaching gigs, but none allowed her to visit Lowell’s Cove on every astronomical low tide. So after spending seven years earning a Ph.D., Diane walked into Cook’s Lobster House and asked for a job as a waitress. The waiter who’d humored her requests for male lobsters in the past recognized her, and she was hired. The first thing she did was hand the manager a list of the dates and times she wouldn’t be able to work during the next twelve months, copied from her tide calendar."|"The Secret Life of Lobsters"|"Trevor Corson"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"Getting up to go lobstering at five o’clock was going to be murder. In the summertime it wasn’t unusual for lobstermen in Maine to wake to a coast enshrouded in fog. If a fog bank blew in before morning, Jack would have an excuse to stay home and sleep. Gathering the dancers into in a ring while the band dropped down to a rhythmic backbeat, Jack gave birth to something like a lobsterman’s rain dance."|"The Secret Life of Lobsters"|"Trevor Corson"
06:00|"6:00 A.M."|"Bruce steamed over to the mainland first thing in the morning. Steering the Double Trouble toward the wharf, Bruce decided he could get used to doing science. There was nothing like pulling your boat up to the float at 6:00 A.M. and seeing a couple of college girls in rubber overalls eager to jump aboard."|"The Secret Life of Lobsters"|"Trevor Corson"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"Every morning at two o’clock the computer queries the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for updated information on weather conditions. It downloads wind-and air-pressure data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction, and talks to the yellow robots on their cell phones from their lonely posts off the coast. The computer uses this information to build a model of temperature, salinity, and current velocity throughout the Gulf of Maine. The output, nearly in real time, is three-dimensional color-coded images of the gulf, with the direction and speed of ocean currents indicated by a layered grid of curving arrows on three planes. Overlays of temperature and surface-wind satellite imagery refine the picture further."|"The Secret Life of Lobsters"|"Trevor Corson"
07:00|"7:00 A.M."|"Erin’s workday aboard the Connecticut began at 7:00 A.M. and continued at a frenetic pace until eight or nine each night. The Phantom completed five dives a day, generating an hour of videotape on each dive. During the dives, two research assistants sat in the darkened control room, glued to the Phantom’s live video feed from the ocean floor. One assistant typed commands into a computer that controlled the zoom angle on the Phantom’s camera while the other recorded depth, temperature, and time. After each dive a third assistant reviewed the videotape in the Connecticut’s lab. Each time a lobster appeared, the assistant hit Pause and gauged the lobster’s size by the distance between the red dots projected by the Phantom’s lasers. An hour-long dive might uncover as many as forty lobsters."|"The Secret Life of Lobsters"|"Trevor Corson"

Local newspapers now referred to her as the Jane Goodall of lobsters, and the local lobstermen had come to expect her in the mud at water’s edge at 5:00 A.M. or 6:00 P.M. or God knew what other hour. Soon the lobstermen were looking out for Diane like a friend, and they joked with her the way they joked with each other."|"The Secret Life of Lobsters"|"Trevor Corson"

05:00|"5:00 A.M."|"On a typical autumn day Diane boarded a lobster boat at 5:00 A.M., her bag loaded with her collection of specialized equipment. When the fisherman hauled up an egg-bearing lobster, Diane noted the developmental state of the eggs and recorded the lobster’s location using a GPS receiver. That was one way to determine where a female lobster might hatch her spawn. Another was to attach a homing beacon to the lobster’s shell and track her."|"The Secret Life of Lobsters"|"Trevor Corson"
04:00|"4:00 A.M."|"Dan was eager to pit his skills against the sea too, and by the age of seventeen was lobstering from an eighteen-foot boat. Bruce was still in the navy when Dan bought Pa’s Pride from Warren, in April of Dan’s senior year in high school. The evening he graduated, Dan went straight to bed so he could rise at 4:00 A.M. to haul his traps. Aboard Pa’s Pride Dan developed a lightning-fast hand. With only a few flicks of the wrist Dan could empty a trap, rebait it, and set it back over the side before the boat drifted off target. Hitting the sweet spots on the bottom was an art, and all the Fernald boys dreamed of matching the uncanny talent of a man named Lee Ham."|"The Secret Life of Lobsters"|"Trevor Corson"
04:30|"four thirty in the morning"|"Barb returned to Rochester to think it over, only to learn that her brother had been nursing similar thoughts. So Barb quit her job and returned with him to the island. Her brother secured a job aboard Mark Fernald’s boat. But when Barb made inquiries, most of the lobstermen just smiled politely. Jack ought to hire her, Barb figured, but he already had a sternman. Finally Mark agreed to take her, but only because her brother needed a day off. Aboard the boat at four thirty in the morning, Mark grunted and handed Barb a pair of gloves. To prove she was tough, she shook her head."|"The Secret Life of Lobsters"|"Trevor Corson"
"ap 05:30"|"five thirty"|"The commissioner took Warren up on his offer. In the morning Warren woke him at five thirty. Aboard the Mother Ann, Warren made the commissioner stuff bait bags and empty traps. They spent most of the day throwing lobsters back into the sea. The shorts, eggers, notchers, and oversize lobsters that Warren tossed overboard far outnumbered the lobsters that he plopped into his barrel of keepers."|"The Secret Life of Lobsters"|"Trevor Corson"
"~ 12:00"|"Around noon"|"Around noon their boat drifted into Little Cranberry’s small harbor just as the wind died, making the day even hotter. After bowls of chowder at the restaurant on the wharf, the Stenecks strolled up the island’s main street, past colorful flower gardens and lobster traps scattered in yards and driveways. Down a wooded road on the back of the island they passed a snug white house with blue trim, set back from the road at an angle. Heat radiated from the cracked pavement."|"The Secret Life of Lobsters"|"Trevor Corson"
"ap 06:06"|"six hours and six minutes"|"A tide calendar would tell you that the sea floods toward land for six hours and six minutes and then reverses direction and ebbs for the same length of time, this cycle occurring roughly twice a day. During a strong flood or ebb tide, a string of buoys ought to behave like a row of balloons in a steady wind, each tied to a brick, strings pulled taut at an angle. A helicopter pilot, having dropped the bricks single file in line with the wind, could circle back and fly straight into the wind, pick up each balloon, and keep flying while he reeled in the string and approached the brick underneath, and so on for the next balloon and brick. Bruce liked to haul his traps in a similar way. Whenever the terrain of the seafloor allowed it, he set his strings of traps more or less parallel to the flow of the tide. When it came time to haul them a few days later, he’d drive the boat into the oncoming current and haul the row of traps from downstream."|"The Secret Life of Lobsters"|"Trevor Corson"
04:30|"four thirty that morning"|"Come June the family had packed their belongings into boxes and boated back out to the white-and-blue house on Little Cranberry for their final few months together before the boys left for college. Now it was late July and there was still no sign of shedders in the traps. When Bruce’s alarm had gone off at four thirty that morning he’d been in the middle of a nightmare. He’d been walking across a dry plain through a row of dusty shacks, pulling open one door after another only to find that each shack was empty. Bruce slowed the Double Trouble and stared at his GPS unit."|"The Secret Life of Lobsters"|"Trevor Corson"
"> 06:00"|"a few minutes past 6 A.M."|"At the helm of his lobster boat Jack Merrill yawned and scratched his beard, then draped his hand back over the steering wheel and looked at the cabin clock. It was a few minutes past 6 A.M. Jack seldom beat Bruce out in the morning, even though the twin-turbo diesel engine aboard Jack’s boat, the Bottom Dollar, cranked out nearly two hundred more horsepower than the Double Trouble. This morning Jack would be even later than usual, because he had a task to accomplish before tending his traps. But given how worried he was about the lack of lobsters, it was a job he had to do."|"The Secret Life of Lobsters"|"Trevor Corson"

He set a course for the first of the three hundred traps he planned to haul that day. The traps had been sitting on the bottom for four days. Maybe there would be lobsters in them."|"The Secret Life of Lobsters"|"Trevor Corson"
