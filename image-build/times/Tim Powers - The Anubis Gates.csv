He knew that the man would arrive at the London Dock on the frigate Sandoval at nine in the morning, and at ten-thirty would write the first draft of his best-known poem, “The Twelve Hours of the Night,” in the front room of the Jamaica Coffee House.

I should just have drunk the brandy, he reflected. His eyes were watering and his nose tingled, but it  seemed his body had forgotten how to sneeze. Hurry up, William, he thought. Your biographer is evidently dying. He hunched around to glance at the clock on the wall—twenty minutes after ten. Ashbless was due in ten minutes."|"The Anubis Gates"|"Tim Powers"

He’d thanked Jacky and bidden the boy farewell—having agreed to meet at high noon on Friday at the middle of London Bridge—and was being introduced to Kusiak’s stable boss when the gypsy had hurried in, demanding to exchange three spent horses for three fresh ones. The stable boss had initially refused, but reconsidered when the gypsy impatiently produced a handful of gold sovereigns from a pouch and offered to throw them in. Doyle’s idle interest had turned to hollow-bellied fear when he recognized the man —this was the same gypsy that had watched with no sympathy when Doctor Romany had tortured him a week ago; Doyle quietly stepped back out of the circle of lamplight and turned to leave, but by the time he got to the side door the recognition had become mutual. Doyle ran down an alley and then dashed east along a sidewalk toward London Bridge, but the old gypsy was faster, and the running footsteps behind Doyle sounded louder and louder until a hand had clamped on his collar and he’d been thrown to the ground."|"The Anubis Gates"|"Tim Powers"

His glance darted around the room, but there was no giant blond man present, with or without the fierce beard Ashbless was evidently never without. Damn it, Doyle thought; the son of a bitch is late. Could I have missed him during the last few minutes? No, he’s not supposed to just duck in and out; he’s supposed to sit down and write the damned “Twelve Hours of the Night.” That’s what, a couple of hundred lines long?"|"The Anubis Gates"|"Tim Powers"
"ap 10:40"|"twenty minutes of eleven"|"His face was hot and his mouth tasted feverish. Reasoning that he must at all costs keep from passing out here, he ordered a pint of stout for two precious pennies. When it arrived the clock said twenty minutes of eleven, and though he tried to drink it slowly, as befitted a restorative, when the clock pinged the third quarter-hour his glass was empty, and he could feel the alcohol pressing outward against the walls of his skull—for he hadn’t eaten in twenty-four hours—and Ashbless still hadn’t arrived."|"The Anubis Gates"|"Tim Powers"
"ap 11:30"|eleven-thirty|"Get hold of yourself, he thought. Coffee, no more beer. So he’s a little late; the accounts of his arrival were more than a century old when you read them—and those were based on Ashbless’ recollections, as recorded by Bailey in the 1830s. A bit of inaccuracy is hardly surprising. It might very well have been eleven-thirty actually. It has to have been eleven-thirty. He settled down to wait. Three carefully nursed cups of coffee later the clock bonged eleven-thirty and there had been no sign of William Ashbless."|"The Anubis Gates"|"Tim Powers"
"ap 10:30"|ten-thirty|"And he began to get angry. This really did, it seemed to him, show a carelessness on the poet’s part, a lack of regard for his readers. Arrogant—to claim he’d been here at ten-thirty when actually he hadn’t bothered to arrive until at least . . . let’s see—getting on for noon. What does he care if he’s kept people waiting? thought Doyle blurrily. He’s a famous poet, a friend of Coleridge and Byron. Doyle visualized him in his mind, and fever and exhaustion gave the picture an almost hallucinatory clarity—the broad shoulders, the craggy face  lion-maned and Viking-bearded. Before, that face had seemed, like Hemingway’s, basically humorous and sociable in a hard-bitten way, but now it only looked cruel and unapproachable. He’s probably outside, Doyle thought, waiting for me to drop dead before he’ll condescend to come in and write his damn poem."|"The Anubis Gates"|"Tim Powers"

"ap 00:30"|twelve-thirty|"An idea struck him, and he stopped a boy and asked him for a pencil and some sheets of paper. And when it arrived he began to write out, from memory, the entire text of “The Twelve Hours of the Night.” In composing the original PMLA article on Ashbless’ work, and later while writing the biography, he had read the poem hundreds of times, and in spite of his sick dizziness he had no difficulty in remembering every word. By twelve-thirty he was scribbling the somewhat awkward final eight lines:He whispered, “And a river lies 
Between the dusk and dawning skies, 
And hours are distance, measured wide 
Along that transnocturnal tide—
Too doomed to fear, lost to all need, 
These voyagers blackward fast recede 
Where darkness shines like dazzling light 
Throughout the Twelve Hours of the Night.”"|"The Anubis Gates"|"Tim Powers"

After ten pounding paces she rebounded from a brick wall—and though she had struck it first with her knee and shoulder, her head had been the next to collide with it, and she wound up sitting half-stunned on the floor. She shook her head, trying to clear it and stop her ears from ringing. She knew she’d misjudged the direction of the dock arch—but was it left or right of here? Had she done a half turn or a full one when she bounced off the wall? Was the wall a yard or two in front of her, or behind, or to one side?"|"The Anubis Gates"|"Tim Powers"

Darrow told us to shoot him with a tranquilizer gun, tie him up, and carry him upstairs, and not to hurt him at all beyond the tranquilizer bullet, which damn well better not hit him in the face or throat. And get this, Brendan: I asked him, boss, what does this guy look like? I mean, aside from having whiskers all over himself. You know what Darrow told me? He said, I don’t know, and even if I did know, the description would only be good for a week or so. Now—are those the words and actions of a sane man?”"|"The Anubis Gates"|"Tim Powers"

Short, chubby red-haired guy with sure enough five o’clock shadow  all over him. When I started edging toward the trank gun he got spooked and ran out, but,” Benner smiled proudly, “I followed him to where he lives. So this morning I was listening in on Darrow’s room—trying to find out if he was in a mood to be approached with an offer of you give me my hook and tell me where’s a gap and I’ll tell you where your hairy man lives, and by God, I hear Darrow telling Clitheroe to tell all the boys Benner is to be shot on sight! Seems he doesn’t trust me. So after emptying one of the cash boxes, I split, and went and talked to the hairy man myself. Had lunch with him just a few hours ago.”"|"The Anubis Gates"|"Tim Powers"

Sometime before midnight on Saturday, the eleventh night of the voyage, he’d thought he’d heard a wailing over the eternal wind scream, and he’d tried to see out, a trick as difficult as trying to see while riding a motorcycle at seventy miles per hour without goggles. After ten minutes he’d gone back to bed, more than half convinced that the black boat he’d seemed to see, visible because it shone a much deeper black than the waves behind it, had been nothing more than a retinal misfire caused by straining his eyes to see through the blast.

A few wavering pencil strokes of smoke stood up from what he knew was El Roda island, though it was not distinguishable as a separate land mass from this distance, and he could see individual palm trees and minarets and windows of buildings in the old quarter of Cairo on the hither bank. Some of our guests, he thought, the Bahrites, are probably coming through those streets right now. And a splendid parade it no doubt is, too—all the little boys will have stopped work to watch, and the dogs will be barking, and all the mashrebeeyeh lattices of the second-floor harems are sure to be glittering with kohl-darkened eyes peering down at the haughty war lords riding past below.

But the mob parted hastily before the relentless hooves of the procession riding down the center of the street at a relaxed but indomitable walk. In hopes of a tip at the end of the ride, a street boy had taken it upon himself to serve as the—in this case unnecessary—sais, or runner-ahead; “Riglak!” he would warn some Nubian merchant, whose foot had been snatched out of the way even before the boy called, and “Uxrug!” to two ladies from a harem who had already crowded up against a wall and were shrilly and indignantly protesting this usurpation of the street."|"The Anubis Gates"|"Tim Powers"

Doyle’s cry of “God damn it, over the wall, horse!” was lost in the tumult, but the horse bounded ahead, scrambling and leaping over the heaped corpses that twitched as bullets thudded into them. A spent ricochet struck Doyle a solid knock above his left ear, and while he reeled in the lunging saddle three shots hit him almost simultaneously—one nicked his right arm bicep, one plowed a long furrow down his left thigh, and the third tore shallowly across his belly, helping him hang on by making him jackknife forward onto the horse’s neck—and then Melboos was climbing the highest hill of corpses, at what he been the front of the procession, and from the top of it she vaulted up toward the rim of the wall, still an unmerciful eight feet above."|"The Anubis Gates"|"Tim Powers"

 Down into darkness; there not quite to drown,
 But ever on continue plying sails
 Against the midnight currents of the depths,
 Moving from pit to pit to lightless crag
 In hopeless search for some ascent to shore;
 And who, in their decayed, slow voyaging
 Do presently lose all desire for light
 And air and living company—from here
 Their search is only for the deepest groves,
 Those farthest from the nigh-forgotten sun . . .”"|"The Anubis Gates"|"Tim Powers"
