"ap ~ 07:00"|"about seven"|"So I had the time, the place, the people. Where was I? How plausibly could I insert myself, full-fledged, into a somewhat complex milieu in meridional France at the age of about sixteen? Who was I, where had I come from? I needed provenance, an identity. Which must mean trotting out my short and recent past. I had little desire to go into what passes as my childhood. I had never been much interested in myself as a child per se, moreover I had already used tales that had come my way in a previous novel in which I had also tried to construct and interpret my own father’s nature and life to the best not of my knowledge but of my imagination perhaps, plus guesswork. He had died when I was so very young; was there anything more to learn? Could I or should I invoke him again? (I often dream about him – sad, puzzled, remorseful dreams, where he is a lonely, hurt, forgiving man whose existence I, long grown-up myself, have ignored throughout the years, as callous as the unfeeling child I had been.) Then, quite suddenly, wide awake, I realised that I had thought and written only about what he may have been as a boy, as a young man, both scarred and spoiled, as the man in his marriages, in his role of a prisoner, the kept son-in-law, of the innocent tied to public scandal; what I had not done was recall our life, the actual, utterly isolated life of his last years that he and I led together in rather eccentric circumstances of ungenteel poverty in quite grand surroundings in the depth of the county. I was about seven when it began, he must have turned sixty, I believe (children did not ask their parents’ age in those days), still very handsome, still well turned out – those pre-1914 suits and shirts last for ever – and as I have said; isolated, cut off, alone. He saw no friends, no women. The house, in those parts called a château (twenty bedrooms, a considerable collection of Renaissance furniture and objets d’art, one bath), contained three inhabitants: a stranded man of the world; a bewildered, later acquiescent, somewhat know-all child; an elderly, good-hearted, deeply religious, hard-working village woman. The reason for all this was simple – no money. That had gone, radically so, when my mother left. It was her money and she had bought the château for her husband, my father, and let him keep it. That was a generous deed. It created a somewhat paradoxical situation – candles instead of electricity bills, masculine cast-offs (children’s clothes do not last), claret in the cellar and at table but no cash for butcher’s meat. (Hence decades into my adult life I would choose sirloin steak rather than Elizabeth David’s gratin of courgettes.) The complete true tableau of my almost prehistoric origins appeared to me quite suddenly one evening in a public place, at dinner, with friends, noise, conversation, flooding over me, wine making thought glide on … ‘This could be told, this is how one could make a book begin; “Antecedent: Germany”.’ Next morning I did begin. The substance was flowing as though it was already on film; as ever, alas, I had to look after the words."|Jigsaw|"Sybille Bedford"
"ap 07:45"|"quarter to  eight"|"An hour later he was back.  My wife thinks it might be ‘amusing’, he uttered the word as if he were  slightly distancing himself from it, if we took everyone to Toulon in a  private bus. He happened to have a bus. She was arranging to invite the  commerçants and anyone else who wished to see Topaze to  go in our bus. He would not come in now, there were things to organise,  but we could count on the bus being outside Les Cyprès at a quarter to  eight tonight, and he hoped that Madame votre Mère – whom he had not met  but had the pleasure of having seen before – would do them the honour …  he was off."|Jigsaw|"Sybille Bedford"

Well after one a.m. – French plays even in the provinces do  not begin nor finish early – we made our way in several groups on foot  up to the boulevard. Word had gone round: Rendez-vous à la Brasserie de Strasbourg. It was the  after-theatre supper place in Toulon, and renowned for its choucroute  garnie. There we assembled, happy and hungry, at one long table pulled  together for our party running along an entire wall. There was no  placement. I noted that our host, who came in late, put himself next to  my mama. I, for my sins, found myself next to Frédéric Panigon, Cécile  and Annette’s elder brother (the boy to whom it didn’t occur to dance  with us at the Café de la Marine – that was three years ago) who was  usually away beavering at his lycée. Apparently no longer so, he had entered university reading law at his father’s wish, as he was trying to tell me. He wanted to be a painter, did I think …? My mind wasn’t on it. Peintre-artiste,  he said. I was trying to watch our maîtres-de-plaisir even though I  couldn’t catch what they were saying. He was talking quietly to my  mother; she, though she sat next to the young god – who kept performing  small services such as filling her glass, with nothing more than Evian  water I noted – was talking rather insistently across people and table,  acting very much, a touch too much, the animatrice of the  occasion. (I would have liked looking at her in repose, which I imagined  most became her face. She was high-pitched when she ought to have been  still. Then I scolded myself for such carping.) At any rate, a good time  was being had by all."|Jigsaw|"Sybille Bedford"

Nor did Renée come  anywhere near to joining the tennis club. Me, to my joy, she sometimes  took out fishing in the early morning. A message would have come the  night before – the tide was right – I would be down on the port before  the break of day, and we, she with Léon the sailor who looked after the  boat, or just she and I, would go out on the dawn sea, still, flat and  grey, far out beyond the sight of land: fish, then swim off the boat and  swim again, and return before high noon.

Surrender …! Levantine pirates, their stylish captain in wig and  kerchief, sea-boots and cloak, scimitar in hand … his slim lieutenant  bristling with daggers and cutlass in belt … they wore half-masks … The  dancing had stopped, all stood still – for a minute the illusion held –  not of a live pirates’ attack but of a mêlée with some precisely executed ballet where the principals looked stunning.

The four of us were made welcome on board, finding a number  of people of various nationalities on deck below an awning, about to  start making cocktails. Mrs Schroder, who kissed Alessandro on both  cheeks, was impeccably sunburnt, smoked through a holder, and looked  extremely smart. They all looked extremely smart – ages I guessed to be  between thirty and forty, and Mr Schroder, who wore a yachting cap, much  older. The cocktails were orange-blossoms: gin and orange-juice shaken  with crushed ice. They tasted fresh and cool, and we were very thirsty. I  sat facing the colour-washed houses of the Saint-Tropez waterfront,  with the sea gently moving under the boat, and felt that life was good.  This bliss was prolonged as luncheon was very late – I’d never waited so  long for a meal before – there was much talking and more orange-blossoms  got shaken, when we ate it was well after three o’clock. Lunch was  served by a member of the crew, and was long, slow and delicious. The  main component was a great deal of lobster. Afterwards everyone retired.  Cécile and I were given a small cabin.

When we  came to a fine-branched ilex, he flung it on the ground. La Cride on a  Sunday noon is an isolated place. I thought he wanted to rest and smoke,  and sat down beside him. There ensued, at once and in complete silence,  what I had read about as heavy petting. I was too surprised to be taken  aback and almost at once surprised again by entirely unexpected and  delicious sensations. When we stood up again – he did hold out his hand  to help me – Tempo-Bello picked up his cloak with a swing and resumed  our walk as though absolutely nothing had occurred. He was his smug self  and entirely composed. I was not, but concealed this, waiting for a  lead from him. None came. No word, no smile, no caress. Up to this I  could have taken what had happened as natural and friendly. His silence made it into something appalling. Shameful, furtive, wrong. I became wordless myself. We went back. (I did not  want to bathe with him from the rocks.) When we got to Les Cyprès I was  struck by panic. In a few minutes I would be sitting down to lunch with  my mother and Alessandro. What if they suspected, what if they guessed?  How would I be able not to give something away? Now I felt fear as well  as guilt. I was unable to look at Tempo-Bello; if only he would not  come in, find some excuse … He did come in, leaving his cloak in the  hall. The teasing started at once: Did we have a nice walk? I turned to  hide my face. ‘What did you talk about? What was the subject of  conversation?’ ‘He told me che fa tempo bello.’ How did I manage  to trot out the old joke? How did I manage to sit through the next hour?  How did the others not notice my state of acute embarrassment?  Embarrassment, that was it. That was what remained."|Jigsaw|"Sybille Bedford"

He didn’t look at the bed, or more to the point, at Frédéric  and me in the bed with the sheet quickly drawn up to our chins. ‘It’s a  quarter to seven,’ he said in our direction, ‘get ready and get going.’  He looked awful. Alessandro could look melancholy and fine-drawn, now he  just looked wretched. ‘I knocked up a garage, they are mending the tyre  now.

"> 00:00"|"past  midnight"|"She could also be charming  to me, most so when Louis was about, hinting at shared private jokes,  ruffling my hair, touching my hand. It did not take much to make Louis  jealous, she always knew how to bring him to heel. There was none of  that – no irritation, no flirting – when Philippe was present; I was  treated (by both of them) with open affection as a well-liked, if  somewhat absurd, young friend of the house. They liked to pretend that I  was instructed beyond my years and nicknamed me Dix-sept ans: Je sais tout,  the title of a popular review for the young. Sadly aware that far from  knowing it all I was even no longer seventeen, I got Philippe to impart  to me some of his manifold knowledge: he  was both wonderfully instructed and instructive. I could make him tell  about Paul Valéry and Valéry Larbaud and Marcel whom he’d been brought  to see as a boy and if anything took against, to the disgust of Oriane  who was Proustienne to her fingertips. He would feed my curiosity  about book publishing, French political institutions, car engines,  map-making and the drafting of timetables. The latter attracted me by  the numerate ingenuity it required. Our calculations, if on a small  scale, were no idle pursuit: the Desmirail bus line was to come into  operation before long. There were to be seven buses to begin with  linking Sanary to Toulon by two routes – one taking in Ollioules, the  other La Seyne – at exact suitable times for getting people to work in  the mornings, returning them at lunchtime and after entertainments past  midnight. Working this out – computers had not been invented – was an  intricate and enjoyable job with graphs spread all over the floor;  Philippe said he was using the principle employed by the French National  Railway network. It was important to get the service from La Seyne  right as that rather deprived township, situated on  the other side of the Bay of Toulon, was mainly inhabited by men who  worked in the naval shipyards whose means of getting there were by steam  ferry. Philippe hoped to provide alternative public transport by road.  La Seyne had something over thirty thousand inhabitants. ‘You’ll be  needing seventy buses soon, Philippe, not seven,’ Louis said. ‘You’ll be  a millionaire.’"|Jigsaw|"Sybille Bedford"
"> 00:00"|"A little after midnight"|"What  was not known until some days after, was that Louis in thunderous black  mood had run into his brother on the port. Louis had poured it forth.  The brother, an elder brother, married, who happened to be staying at  the Hôtel de la Plage for a holiday, listened. Louis was fed up with  fetching and carrying and being bossed about by Oriane. He had had  enough. He wanted out. The brother saw his chance. One should remember  that the family – solid, respectable, highly regarded in the Parisian  art world – was against on every count: a married woman,  indiscreet, keeping a young son from the family, keeping him from  painting. The brother took Louis back to the hotel, settled him in his  own room, fanned the flames; then left him and went to work. Quick work.  He telephoned to their father in Paris, the father telephoned to an  uncle in Marseille, the uncle chased up a sea captain of his  acquaintance, a capitaine au long cours, whose ship – a tramp  steamer – was lying in port ready to weigh anchor that very dawn on the  way to the South Pacific. Louis meanwhile had been nourishing his wrath  (helped by brandies and sodas). He would show the bitch, he would. The  brother lost no time getting him into his car in the clothes (sans  cravate) he stood in. A little after midnight he was on board, under the  wing of the complacent captain and delighted with his destination.  (Louis liked thinking of himself as a noble savage.) The ship, the  brother was assured, would not call at any port for at least five weeks.  The plot was a triumph of initiative, family solidarity and cunning, as  well as will over matter when one considers the state of the French  telephone system (now the pride of Europe) in those days."|Jigsaw|"Sybille Bedford"

Joyeu received us wordlessly – he appeared not to have been  to bed – my mother, equally speechless, looked ghastly, she might well  just have had some appalling attack. He put her on a chaise-longue  and administered what was necessary. I believe she fell asleep for a  while. I was gasping for breath: Joyeu handed me a glass half filled  with a cloudy liquid with a vaguely pharmaceutical smell. I did not  really want to, but I drank it.

I already mentioned their  perfect manners to each other – no nagging or snapping in that ménage –  manners that included listening to what the other had to say. Their  morning’s forays into Sanary yielded amusing gleanings. Like many  intelligent people, like Aldous, like my mother, Philippe enjoyed gossip  of which he was both a source and a conveyor. Intelligent gossip, as  opposed to gossip tout court, makes for good conversation.  Philippe, though far from being a local man, knew – or invented – a good  deal about the secret histories of Sanary inhabitants; two of his  favourite butts were a retired military gentleman called Rose, referred  to as le Général Rose allongé, and a moustachioed spinster of uncertain sex whose actual name was Mademoiselle Casanova."|Jigsaw|"Sybille Bedford"

It aspired to be a boîte or a bar américain  and was really a café where one could dance. One sat and drank outside  in the balmy air not many yards from the sea; when the gramophone struck  up and one was so inclined, one went inside to dance on a small floor  that lit up sultry pink for a tango. It was frequented by people from  the hotels and villas, off yachts in harbour, strollers-in when the  casino closed. Suzie kept open till four a.m. or even five, quite  legitimately. I became an habituée; meeting diverse and curious  characters, who stood me drinks, most of them English or American (the  ones still able to come in spite of the slump), they might be anything  from an expatriate poet, or a Chelsea antique dealer to the spinster daughters of fathers who owned chains of Midland stores."|Jigsaw|"Sybille Bedford"

He is serious about this as he is about anything involving ritual and skills, but he is not fussy or anxious. Enjoy your wine, he says, and I do. At midday we drink cider – cider made in an old wooden press from apples grown in the orchard; we drink claret at night. We don’t have to worry, he says, we have a decent amount left in the bins. He has taught me to pronounce the names on the labels and to look at the pictures of the châteaux, he has been to them, has met the owners. What shall we drink tomorrow? I am sent to fetch up the bottle. I am proud of the job, but when it’s late in the day it fills me with terror – two flights down from the morning-room, across the large dark hall filled with crucifixes and statues, down another flight into the cellar; in one hand I hold a candle, in the other I shall have a bottle (bring it up gently); I shall have no free hand to cross myself if the ghost appears. He is a bishop, Wessenberg was his name, and he is said to have done a foul deed in this very hall. Lina has taught me an incantation to use if, Heaven forbid, I should see him, a German jingle, All good ghosts praise God the Lord, yet crossing oneself is of the essence. When I’m home and safe upstairs in the lighted room with the right wine and the candle has not blown out, my father often gives me a piece of gingerbread or a few coins. Danger-money. For he professes to believe – believes? – in old Wessenberg as he off-handedly calls the ghost and claims to have found him occupying the chairs he is said to favour in the library and the Renaissance room, chairs I give a wide berth to, the dogs won’t go near them, I’ve seen their hackles rise. Well, once the wine is safely up, it is stood somewhere to settle – that room’s too warm, keep it well away from that stove! – and next day I am allowed to cut the seal and, unless the wine is very old, draw the cork, wipe the neck inside and out.

The bacon was cut thick, right off a side in the larder, as thick as a beef steak. The bread was home-baked in big round loaves weighing about five pounds, whitish, not snow-white, good bread not unlike the French pain de campagne though harder and closer in texture; and at its best when about eight days old. The cider was spoken of as wine, and not up to ours, as many stretched it by adding water and a powdered stuff, a kind of must, that came out of a cardboard box.

Some had only an acre or two, some had thirty or forty; some were said to be in debt to the mortgage bank, some were quite prosperous; a few did something on the side such as keeping the smithy, the post office (with the one and only telephone which went dead at seven p.m.), the village shop and the inn. All lived much in the same way. The houses varied in size, all were stone and most of them had two storeys. A few were shiningly clean with polished cook-stoves and floors, a dustless quiescent parlour, a main bedroom with a store-bought suite, double bed, wardrobe, framed wedding photograph on the chest of drawers, often a photograph too of a son fallen (so recently) in the war. Some were less speckless, some were sluttish. At the back was the yard with the dung heap and the pump and trough (only the schoolhouse, the presbytery and the château had water laid on), then the stables and barns, and these also were tell-tale. The mayor’s were a joy to behold, the stables airy with the straw high and clean, the harness-room sparkling, the milk churns scoured and the apple loft smelling sweet. There was an enclosed vineyard. The mayor, like a few other big farmers, had four horses, most had only one and you often saw a horse and an ox teamed up before a load. Oxen did much of the work, and one man who was also the cobbler had to do the ploughing with his only cow."|Jigsaw|"Sybille Bedford"

In the church there was music, an organ played by the schoolmaster; whoever could sing, sang in the choir; one young man served as verger, others rang the bells, the angelus bell at morning, noon and sunset, the bells for mass, the jerky hysterical fire bells and the slow single bell when someone had died. The small high one for a woman, the deeper one for a man. You listened and said your ave, or got ready for church or ran for help or wondered who it might be. Women looked after the altar linen, swept the church – and a beautiful small church it was, pure-arched, whitewashed, plain – it was the virgins’ job (virgins of any age) to bring flowers and branches, to polish the censer and candlesticks. The mayor and my father in turn provided the wine for mass; the boys I played with served as acolytes. Rosary and missal were treasured private possessions."|Jigsaw|"Sybille Bedford"
"~ 16:30"|Vespers|"The most popular offices were Vespers and the nightly Rosary during May because in these we could take part. The responses – Et cum spiritu tuo, Orate pro nobis, Dona nobis pacem – would not be mumbled by the altar-boys or chanted by the choir but babbled in unison by the flock. If you were good at it and bold, you would be singled out to lead the prayers from a prie-dieu in front of the nave. There you intoned the Pater and the Ave or, best of all, recited the petitions of a litany in the vernacular. This exalted role was often filled by a young farmer’s wife who had acquired her much admired diction while in service at some country house. I aspired to be her rival. I went about boasting that I would be able to recite a whole litany without once opening my missal. It was taken up. One evening in May I found myself kneeling in conspicuous isolation, missal shut beside me, chanting in the right blend of Hochdeutsch and patois line after line punctuated by the thunderous response behind me."|Jigsaw|"Sybille Bedford"
16:00|"four p.m."|"The house was on the edge of the town and quite large, and the household too was large. Granny, maiden aunts, unmarried sisters, a line of female servants: housemaids, parlourmaid, cook, and of course the masters, the old people, Susan’s mother and father. There weren’t dozens of children, just two girls at home between schools, Marjory and Joan, big girls in their teens, older than I, younger than Doris. You’re a foreigner, they said. I don’t know, I answered. They lost interest. (Hadn’t much to begin with.) Meals were worlds apart from any I’d known, twice as many meals as there were in Italy. They were what they were sixty years ago before quiche, kebab and pasta had become ubiquitous in the land – breakfast off the sideboard (this I found splendid), another big spread at four p.m., main meals a steady rotation; after wishy-washy soup and a bit of fish, beef and mutton, hot joint, cold joint, mince, cutlets, hot joint, cold joint – pickles, bottled sauces, dispirited salads, custards, vegetables that were about par with Feldkirch cookery and puddings that were much better. Drink was water, soda water or barley water. Tea was offered again at bedtime. There were morning prayers and these made me feel odd. Was the family Church of England? Now I think they may well have been something more strict and narrow, then it didn’t occur to me that there were niceties in heresy; if I had lapsed from my religion, its teachings still told me to recognise no other. No one asked me questions. This may have been a way to make me feel at home. Jack’s mother-in-law had given him the use of the garden-room as a studio (this was regarded as indulgence), and he asked me to sit for him; he needed a child for a large composition. When I wasn’t sitting I was encouraged to work the pianola – much more enjoyable – as Jack liked music while he worked. For the rest of the time I seem to have been trotting after Marjory and Joan on their not unpleasant round of following an aunt leaving orders at the grocer’s and the greengrocer’s, changing library books at Boots, taking turns for fetching grandad from the works in the pony trap. Did it really happen? Did people ever live as they do in an E. F. Benson or an Agatha Christie novel? On Wednesday afternoons we went to the cinema, and, casually, miraculously, there was tennis! Tennis with a live opponent on an actual court. Contrary to my early aspirations I never got any good at it at all."|Jigsaw|"Sybille Bedford"
12:00|noon|"The rest of Sanary proper, Sanary-ville, consisted of a network of a few narrow streets, cleft by the sun only at noon, inhabited by families of commerçants and their shops, butchers and bakers, épiceries, laiteries, cordonneries, quincailleries, a couple of bonneteries where one bought thread, beach hats and canvas shoes. The houses were modestly urban, late eighteenth to mid-nineteenth century, with bead curtains over the doorways, here and there a stone arch, shutters on every window. Outer Sanary was pine groves and palms to eastward, small hotels, most of them new, bathing huts spread thinly between a flat road and the plage of Six-Fours; to westward there were hills, pine was relieved by ilex; villas with gardens of a sort (incipient suburbia) followed the contours of rock-bound bays, Port Issol, La Cride, La Gorguette – which became Huxley territory – Bandol. Inland all this vanished."|Jigsaw|"Sybille Bedford"
12:00|noon|"I had come by way of Paris, a stopover not attempted before. So the first time I put foot in France, after a sleepy queasy transfer from boat to train, was on the pavement outside the Gare du Nord. I did not kiss the ground; I found a bus to take me to the Gare de Lyon. The female conductor was unamiable about my suitcase, which couldn’t have been large. Having left it at the cloakroom, I had the day before me (from noon that was until the last night-train South). I still remember how I spent it and still blush. What did Ernest Hemingway, James Joyce, and Gertrude Stein feel on their first day in Paris, France? I cringe, for I felt nothing very much. But then these illustrious expatriates had not stepped off the quick green omnibus at the Place de la Madeleine at the age of fifteen and a half. That was where I started. I was not impressed and wondered if I should have been. Nor did I know what to make of the unfamiliar façades of the Grands Boulevards, the slate-grey straightness, the compound gusts of smells: open pissoirs with tin screens like fire-guards being prominent and numerous. I ate a hurried lunch at a prix fixe and trotted off again. My mother had told me to go to the Tuileries, stand in the Place du Carrousel and look at La Concorde and the Arc de Triomphe beyond. This I did, and the nobility of the perspectives, evidence that the theme contrapuntal to French easeful dailiness is La Gloire, left me not entirely unvisited by a sense of grandeur. It was so again in front of the Hôtel des Invalides."|Jigsaw|"Sybille Bedford"
14:00|"two p.m."|"The house had neither mosquito nets nor screens which made for fuss and inconvenience in the night (mosquitoes being a much greater plague in those days before the Allied Armies had done something drastic, or so one is told, with DDT); one had to undress in the dark if one wanted to keep the window open, and before that one either had to spray with a substance called Flytox, as noxious to humans as it was to those elusive buzz-diving pests, or fumigate. We used little brown cones, Zampironi, which we stood up and lit in saucers where they glowed then crumbled into dust filling the room with acrid smoke. My mother, an insomniac, took more and stronger sleeping pills. Veronal was one of the most potent on the market then and one could get it without prescription, two cachets at a time. The chemist allowed my mother four. (Good nature? Carelessness? Not profit: they were a few pence apiece; I never knew. That chemist played a painful part in our lives later on.) I went for the veronal, I ran most of the errands. The veronal induced heavy, sometimes alarmingly heavy, sleep. Once or twice I came home from the beach at two p.m. and found Alessandro saying, I can’t wake her up. This would be when the evening before they had talked of his need to go away, go to Paris, go to a city, to see a man, to see a woman who might buy a picture or want her house doing up."|Jigsaw|"Sybille Bedford"
00:00|midnight|"The only other break in our social isolation that summer came when we heard that one of my mother’s friends of other times was staying at the Hôtel des Bains at Bandol with a young and glossy mistress (I had seen her). It was Ernst Toller, the playwright and poet. He was a communist then and in exile (Paris, not yet Hollywood and New York where he eventually killed himself), having lately served a two-year prison sentence in Germany (pre-concentration-camp Germany) for his part in some subversive action, and had published a poem written in his cell (like Oscar Wilde, I thought). I was awed – had it been unbearable? Would it show? I was also agog to meet a writer. He came to supper at our bungalow one night (without the mistress, without Alessandro, too, as it turned out, he was spending a few days in Marseille trying to see that man about a job). Home before dusk, still in damp espadrilles and bathing-shorts, I found a youngish man – not yet thirty? – sun-browned, healthy-looking, handsome, sitting on the verandah with my mother. I had offered to do the cooking, and they presently joined me in the kitchen. I remember that he seemed a nice man, an animated talker, even jolly in a gentle way, and he made a nice evening of it, against odds. I do not remember what we, what they were talking about, what a poor cheap thing it is, one’s memory: Toller, that doomed and talented man, much loved by his friends, and all that I am able to tell about him at first-hand is his niceness about my own foolish predicament. Which was that we got nothing to eat; or rather: little, very late. I was trying to make us a dish of gratin dauphinois, once taught me by my father: finely sliced potatoes cooked in light cream with a touch of garlic and black pepper. The potatoes must be well washed and dried, and arranged in a neat pattern in their dish, and it looked promising enough as it went into the oven. Our kitchen stove burned wood; firewood in the South of France is either pine which makes a quick flambée then dies, or olive, often green, which is slow to ignite then dies and smokes. Need I say more? I still have the strip cartoon Toller drew afterwards for my mother. It shows a series of an anxious figure – me – bending in a cloud of smoke over a tepid stove under a clock (drawn not quite round) displaying the advancing hours. ‘Not quite ready …’, say the balloons from out of my mouth. Under the last image, showing midnight, he wrote, ‘But it was delicious all the same.’ (Not true: it was shrivelled and still not quite ready.)"|Jigsaw|"Sybille Bedford"
"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"I was back quite soon. At Christmas in fact, a rarity, we kept moveable feasts. I found them in a villa with a wide view on the sea, in an easy mood. Each day there were hours of warmth around noon, real warmth, we ate our luncheons out of doors on the terrace in shirt-sleeves.  I had brought a book for my mother, by a new English writer she had not heard of, expecting he would astonish and please. She read him in one go."|Jigsaw|"Sybille Bedford"
12:00|noon|"Our day began. In the long mornings it was concentrated plunges into la lecture. In France backwaters have bookshops; if Sanary did not run to a full-sized librairie, it had some well stocked shelves in an artists’ supply shop by name Au Grand Tube, run by a charming non-local couple. Here we found what is surely the ultimate in paperbacks: classics of French fiction at one franc twenty-five – three pence. New French books, then as now, did not come out in hardback – how I liked those light white volumes, beautifully produced by the NRF or Bernard Grasset, with their plain covers elegantly lettered like the labels of a first grand cru. That threepenny library was something quite else. Decades before Penguins, and also unlike the present French livres de poche, those books didn’t even look like books: they were flat, the shape of large notebooks, the paper was cheap and the print was smudgy – what matter, they were treasures; carrying an armful up our hill, I felt rich. I must have read (with earnest marginal notes) and my mother re-read half of Balzac, most of Maupassant, some Zola, Alfred de Vigny, Chateaubriand, George Sand, the Goncourts … All essential in their so various ways, my mother told me firmly, if I were to begin to understand something about the country I was in. Flaubert and, prematurely no doubt, Constant’s Adolphe I had absorbed earlier, at my mother’s knee as it were, and however little of their substance I had been capable of extracting, it was a foundation. Stendhal, too, had no part in our reconnaissance at that stage; Stendhal, a sincere and early passion, I felt to be both Italianate and a great writer hors nation. By noon we had shut our books, ready to stroll down, baskets over arm, into Sanary. Our bitch, Chumi, went with us. The few errands done, we would seek a sheltered table on the terrace of Chez Schwob, one of the bars tabacs. Schwob was a large and erudite Alsatian, married to a large and placidly competent black woman who nursed an out-sized baby while he spouted Heine and Descartes as they sold cigarettes and stamps and poured bright drinks from behind the zinc. Theirs was a steady clientèle of fishermen, masons, sailors, interspersed in the morning by artists, foreigners, French from other parts, and some of the larger-minded notables. In the evenings all these latter went to the more expensive Café de la Marine next door, the day resort of local professionals and retraités. The Café de Lyon and the other tabac must have been strictly other ranks, in all the years we never saw anyone we knew set foot in them."|Jigsaw|"Sybille Bedford"
"ap 08:45"|"quarter to nine"|"That agreeable routine was varied as we got drawn into Sanary winter night-life. Some of my mother’s new acquaintances met for a game of cards at the Café de la Marine on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and we were asked to join them. First step was putting dinner forward, these assignations being for a quarter to nine. The upheaval, my mother said, like dining out before a dance. To save me another walk down and up the hill, we did our own cooking. She made the soup, potatoes and leeks or potatoes and cresson, the ubiquitous good soup of the evening of the urban and suburban French (the peasant’s main-dish soup was something else). I made the oeufs-sur-le-plat in a couple of small round buttered dishes gently till the whites were set pure and creamy with the yolks still perfect, as my father had taught me when I wasn’t tall enough to reach the spirit-lamp (now it was more tricky on the charcoal-stove but attention – also taught by him – would do it). These were not the fried eggs of the English hotel breakfast: hardened, browned and frizzy at the edges, spluttered fat congealing into tepid grease. Our bi-weekly menu was always the same: small courses in the pattern of the French en famille at night (who ate more, much more, than we did at noon). After our eggs, we had a slice of ham with a green salad lightly dressed, and to end with a coeur-crème with apricot jam."|Jigsaw|"Sybille Bedford"

Infusions of verbena or lime, perhaps a rum toddy or some coffee laced with a teaspoonful of brandy, a couple of halves of light beer. The winner was supposed to pay, though after a token struggle this would always be a man. We got into our overcoats and mufflers, shook hands all round (much less kissing than there is now), said au revoir and à demain and started walking our different ways into the night.

Very happily, though vague about the constellations (Alessandro would have set us right). It was a good cold out here in the open; once inside our horrible villa it was just very very chilly.

I slept at Belsize Park, had breakfast with Susan and Jack, did my books; set off, walking a stretch, catching a bus, eating my lunch perhaps on the steps of the National Gallery having attended – what I thought of as – an excellent lecture on the Quattrocento or the Flemish. Round the corner were the attractions of the Charing Cross Road, Soho offering another kind of browsing among the 3/6d., 2/6d., even 1/6d., French and Italian menus; in the Strand barristers crossed the road in their wigs – the streets of London in busy midday, were pleasant places to be in for the young and curious. Then it was time to meet Rosie, tea at her bed-sitter in Marylebone: talking time. There would be books on her table, just come out, highbrow books as one spoke of them then unselfconsciously. She took The Times, for the reviews, the theatre critics, the law reports. Politics, except in most general terms, were seldom referred to. (Though, like my mother, she often spoke of the beastliness of the 1914 War.)

Well, she gave him his breakfast and his supper. He had his lunches near the shop – somewhere behind Bond Street or Oxford Street – how nice for him, I thought, with a colleague or a customer, the men he brought back the anecdotes from. The sisters had their main meal at Schmidt’s, the German restaurant in Charlotte Street, where they met every day at one o’clock. I had been expected to join them; got out of it, couldn’t afford it for one thing though it was fairly inexpensive then and a good place of its kind.

It embraced, contained, our existence; the ever-present sun and sea, the scented air, the strident sounds of tree-frog and cicada were the element we moved in. From May to October there was no rain, only night-dew, thus nothing changed: the earth was monochrome, the sea reverberated the sky. Morning after morning we woke to clear light, coolness modulating through the hours into the still, unwavering heat of noon, the small evening breezes, the warm night luminous from sky and phosphorescent sea.

Some weeks later I wrote the piece in the quiet of an isolated wing of some friends’ large country house in Tuscany. I did eight judges, or was it ten? It was tough work – there was a sharp deadline – and I was entirely absorbed in it. Trays of meals and refreshments were deposited on tiptoe outside my door.

Season tickets for the commuters from La Seyne? Then there was the argument about the secretary’s salary – they’d taken on Josée, a local girl, trained dactylo and rather pretty, who was to do the letters and bills, receive and count the cash in the drivers’ money bags. Now French women, especially young ones in that kind of job were as a rule not paid a living wage, the assumption being that either they didn’t need it as they were living at home, or if not, that there were always ways for a reasonably attractive girl to make ends meet.

The majority of Sanaryans, usually including the mayor, were Communists; on the other hand few if any had truck with a union. Philippe also insisted on paying for substantial accident insurance for his drivers (well above the requirements of the law) and that too was accepted with no more than a shrug – Well and good, and more fool he. So, how to balance overheads with income? How much would passengers think right to pay? How much was needed for them to pay? Should there be a surcharge after 9 p.m.? 12 p.m.? Season tickets for the commuters from La Seyne? Then there was the argument about the secretary’s salary – they’d taken on Josée, a local girl, trained dactylo and rather pretty, who was to do the letters and bills, receive and count the cash in the drivers’ money bags. Now French women, especially young ones in that kind of job were as a rule not paid a living wage, the assumption being that either they didn’t need it as they were living at home, or if not, that there were always ways for a reasonably attractive girl to make ends meet. Oh nothing as crass as prostitution, just an arrangement with a steady older man who’d naturally come forth with the occasional or regular cadeau."|Jigsaw|"Sybille Bedford"

Berlin was not the right place for her at present, too many rackety friends, late hours, too many night clubs … It was the life she was used to. Poor girl she’d never had much of a chance. All that would be different when he could look after her properly. What she needed now was warmth, some feeding up, no snacks at three a.m., and someone to keep an eye on her."|Jigsaw|"Sybille Bedford"

I could stop a world war, I told him. He gave me another injection, and wrote out a prescription to last a week. One in the morning, one in the late afternoon. Would I be able to do it? Give myself a hypodermic injection? with a needle? Of course not! It’s quite easy, he said. I dare say. Nor did I fancy coming to the Villa Joyeu morning, noon and night.

My mother’s twenty-four hours’ cycle followed a fairly even keel, if even keel is the right term for heavy late waking over-clouded soon by despondency (Alessandro bore the brunt of that), relieved – after the first injection – by mild euphoria silent or loquacious, followed through luncheon by irritability and strained waiting, relieved again by euphoria and so on through the third injection to the midnight dose of veronal. She struggled to remain kind to Alessandro and objective about their predicament, and most of the time succeeded. Even during the waiting hours – ‘It can’t be only half past five!’ – she was able to make jokes about herself.

03:00|"three in the morning"|"Though Aldous kept utterly regular working hours – two or three in the morning, at least two more in the afternoon – he and Maria were quite social. They had people for lunch and often dined out or had people to dinner; when the house became properly habitable (with three guest rooms) they generally had friends (interesting and charming) to stay. Then there were the picnics, the hilarious Huxley picnics, on beach and cliff and wind-swept plateau, nocturnal picnics with Aldous’s planter’s punch to drink, Maria’s eccentric food – she was fastidiously anti-food but fed children and guests – fried rose leaves, fried zucchini and rabbit, quince jelly to eat, games to play. These and music at night – Aldous’s Beethoven records listened to in hammocks in the garden under the stars and leaves – were sheer enjoyment, giving in to the moment. (Over, when my mother felt the first twinges of restlessness.)"|Jigsaw|"Sybille Bedford"
12:00|noon|"She insisted on giving me dinner at Le Sourd, so we drove there. Le Sourd, elegant, not large, practising a restrained classical cuisine, was then one of the most expensive restaurants in Toulon. We’d been there before, taken by one of Alessandro’s patronesses. My mother ordered – there was no gainsaying – an elaborate and heavy dinner: I must have this and that and so would she … It was a Sunday; the place had undoubtedly been bustling at noon, now it was nearly empty with the waiters glum and tired; the French do not dine out much on Sunday night. My mother picked at the first course, some delicacy barely in season; the duck looked huge on her plate and she could not touch it. By the time they wheeled in the paraphernalia for the crêpes Suzette, she told the head-waiter she was taken by a malaise, and me to get her home without delay (she needed the fourth hypodermic). As expeditiously as I could, I paid for the uneaten dinner and drove her back at speed."|Jigsaw|"Sybille Bedford"
