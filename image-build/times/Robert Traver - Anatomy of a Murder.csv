It was a warm moonlit Sunday night in mid-August and I was arriving home from a long weekend of trout fishing in the Oxbow Lake district with my old hermit friend Danny McGinnis, who lives there all year round. I swung over on Hematite Street to look at my mother’s house—the same gaunt white frame house on the corner where I was born. As my car turned the corner the headlights swept the rows of tall drooping elms planted by my father when he was a young man—much younger than I—and gleamed bluely on the darkened windows. My mother Belle was still away visiting my married sister and she had enjoined me to keep an eye on the place. Well, I had looked and lo! like the flag, the old house was still there."|"Anatomy of a Murder"|"Robert Traver"

"~ 23:45"|"approximately 11:45 P.M."|"“Thank you, Your Honor,” I said, and began reading. “Doctor, assume that a man of thirty-six is a First Lieutenant in the United States Army; that he was a combat veteran of World War II and the Korean War; that he returned to his country from Korea in 1953 and for a time was assigned to special military duty in various places. That in July of this year he was assigned to duty in a remote logging and resort village in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. That he was married to an attractive and vivacious woman five years his senior. That these two were and are much in love with each other. That they lived in a trailer in a public park in said village. That the social and recreational facilities of said village were limited. That one of the few public recreational places they could conveniently go to was a neighboring hotel bar. That because of his long overseas service and the further fact that he was on loan from his own outfit the Lieutenant had few acquaintances among local Army personnel. That he
occasionally went to the hotel bar when off duty and that his social relations with the civilian proprietor were cordial though in no sense intimate. Assume further, Doctor, that at approximately 9:oo P.M. on Friday, August 15th the wife of this lieutenant went to this tavern to get some beer and play pinball and that the lieutenant went to bed and slept and that at approximately 11:45 P.M. he was suddenly awakened. That he hurriedly got up and thereupon heard a series of screams. That he then met his wife at the door of his trailer. That she was sobbing and breathless and hysterical. That she finally told him that the proprietor of the hotel bar had threatened her life and assaulted and raped her; that he had again just assaulted her and beaten and kicked her. That she was badly bruised and beaten. That her skirt was ripped and her underpants were missing. That the Lieutenant spent upwards of an hour attempting to calm and comfort and minister to his wife. That during this time she told him the details of the threats and assaults and beatings. That during this time he wiped a fluid from his wife’s leg which he believed to be seminal fluid. Assume further, Doctor, that this lieutenant reasonably believed that the man whom he believed had just assaulted, threatened and raped his wife was an expert pistol shot and that he kept pistols about his premises and possibly on his person. That he himself kept a loaded liiger automatic pistol in his trailer for protection. That his mind was in a turmoil over what he believed had just happened to his wife and over her present condition. That he finally determined to seek out said hotel bar proprietor and grab him and hold him for the police. That while he felt considerable anger and loathing and contempt for the proprietor he had at no time any intention of killing or harming him but felt that if the man made one bad move he would have killed him. That he went and got his pistol without his wife’s knowledge and left his wife in the trailer and proceeded toward this tavern. That he does not remember what time it was or precisely how he got to the tavern. That he finally got to the tavern and entered it. That he saw the proprietor standing alone behind the bar watching him. That he then advanced to the bar and the proprietor whirled around and the Lieutenant produced his pistol and pointed it at the proprietor and emptied its contents into his body, leaning over the bar to do so. That he had and has no conscious recollection of his act. That he then turned and left the tavern and proceeded toward his trailer. That he does not remember anything after he entered the tavern other than as indicated until he got home to the trailer. That he then first observed
that his pistol was empty; that he then told his wife that he had shot the tavern proprietor. That he then notified a deputized caretaker of the trailer camp of what he had done. That he waited in his trailer for the police and was subsequently arrested and charged with murder. Assume further, Doctor, that this man had never before in his lifetime ever been arrested for or convicted of any criminal offense, including any civilian act of violence toward another human being.” I paused and caught my breath. “Now, Doctor, assume all the facts herein stated to be true, have you an opinion based upon a reasonable psychiatric certainty as to whether or not it is probable that the hypothetical man was in a condition of emotional disorganization so as to be temporarily insane?”"|"Anatomy of a Murder"|"Robert Traver"

He spoke rapidly. “Look, Polly,” he blurted, “something’s cooking, I don’t know what, but I just found out from Sulo Kangas that our friend Dancer’s been interviewing my prisoners since yesterday. Sees ’em alone in Mitch’s office, one at a time. Of course I suppose I couldn’t have stopped him but I thought I’d let you know.”"|"Anatomy of a Murder"|"Robert Traver"

we didn’t also expect to see … ? It was ten minutes past nine. Everyone was in his place, as tensely still as spectators at an execution.

I have warned you. Proceed, Mr. Clerk.”"|"Anatomy of a Murder"|"Robert Traver"

The lowering of the Judge’s hand seemed a signal for chaos: the courtroom suddenly burst alive like a sea in a lashing typhoon. The dikes of tension had finally broken. The clamor pounded in on mounting wave upon wave. Everybody was standing now. Laura threw her arms about the Lieutenant and wept. The flushed Lieutenant held out his hand behind her back and I took it. I glanced back at the clock. It was 9:17. A strange beady-eyed little woman who looked like an unkempt French poodle suddenly vaulted the lawyer’s rail—she wore no pants, I observed with fascinated honor—and threw her arms wildly about Laura and the Lieutenant and tried to waltz them around. She turned and lunged at me but I ducked and, frustrated, she tackled the jury foreman, who grinned and winked at me over her shoulder.
