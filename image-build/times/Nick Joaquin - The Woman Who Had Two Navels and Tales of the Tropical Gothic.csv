12:00|noon|"The gendered and sexualized inflections of generational politics are similarly thematized in two of Joaquin’s best-known works, “The Summer Solstice” and “May Day Eve” (both 1947). In the former, set in the late nineteenth century, the patriarchal complacency of a wealthy Filipino home is shattered on the hottest day of the summer when one of the servants, Agueda, returns from an orgiastic fertility ritual with its roots in pre-Christian practices. Drawn to the erotic power suddenly palpable on the half-naked body of the servant, the properly feminine mistress, Doña Lupe, decides, with the encouragement of her much younger nephew newly returned from Europe and against the wishes of her older, more conservative husband, Don Paeng, to attend the ritual. Running off to join the frenzied dancing among women of all ages and classes, Lupe is transformed as she comes to absorb the repressed memory of pagan practices that elevated women’s power of fertility over men’s claims of ownership over that power. Back home, she triumphantly confronts her husband, forcing him to declare his adoration for her as her “dog,” and “slave.” In the unforgettable ending, he gets down on the ground like “a great agonized lizard,” and crawls toward her outstretched naked foot, “kiss[ing] it savagely . . . the step, the toe, the frail ankle—while she bit her lip and clutched in pain at the windowsill, her body distended and wracked by horrible shivers, her head flung back and her loose hair streaming out the window—streaming fluid and black in the white night where the huge moon glowed like a sun and the dry air flamed into lightning and the pure heat burned with the immense fever of noon.”"|"The Woman Who Had Two Navels and Tales of the Tropical Gothic"|"Nick Joaquin"

The walls trembled and a window she ran to pull shut broke loose from her hands and went whirling away on the wind. By noon the typhoon had flooded the streets and unroofed half the city. As she dispensed dry clothes among the families who had sought refuge in her house, Doña Ana found herself trembling for Currito, and for all the poor soldiers caught by the storm at sea. She pictured them on their teetering decks, hurtled now upward, now downward; the rain beating on their faces and the wild sea piling in from all sides. Shuddering, she whispered prayer after prayer for them—for the poor Currito, especially, upon whom (as she feared) the rain was indeed beating hard at that moment, soaking him to the bone as he lay, wounded and bleeding, not on a ship’s deck but somewhere on the rocky coast of Mindoro. For the storm had caught the ship near that island; the ship had been hurled against the rocks and had shattered into pieces. A few men had saved themselves by swimming ashore, Currito among them and some other Spaniards, but the rest were natives who had been impressed to the service and who now turned against their cruel masters, pushing the Spaniards off the cliffs and hurling great rocks at them until they were all dead or dying, whereupon the natives fled to the wilderness."|"The Woman Who Had Two Navels and Tales of the Tropical Gothic"|"Nick Joaquin"

And they, not understanding him, stared at each other, wondering was this Currito? But though he spoke to them, he seemed but dimly aware of them; seemed to be gathered away already; lifting his eyes from their faces to stare, calm and unblinking, at the sun; dying thus indeed: his lips parted, as if the last breath were a cry of wonder, and his eyes arrested, his eyes fixed in wild rapture at the noon sun; the priest crouched at his side and intoning the litany; the soldiers grouped around in awed attitudes—the palms ascending, the sea shimmering, the ship tremulous behind and below them—their armor and helmets golden and bristling with lightnings as the sun clashed hotly with the proud steel, clashing as hotly, and in the same moment, with the proud steel of soldiers poised on the young walls of faraway Manila, clashing as hotly indeed with the spires and red roofs of that city and flooding with molten pearl its crooked cobbled streets, empty at this hour of the siesta save for a carriage stopping at the Dominicans and Doña Ana descending, Doña Ana moving slowly across the patio, her head bowed and her face very pale and her skirts and mantilla vividly black in the hot whiteness of that hour—and her mood as black as her veils."|"The Woman Who Had Two Navels and Tales of the Tropical Gothic"|"Nick Joaquin"

The city’s bells ring out as the gate opens and St. Andrew and his companions come forth to greet the heavenly embassy. The two bishops embrace and exchange the kiss of peace, and proceed to the cathedral, where the Pontiff celebrates the Mass of the Circumcision. The bells continue pealing throughout the enchanted hour and break into a really glorious uproar as St. Sylvestre rises to bestow the final benediction. But when the clocks strike one o’clock, the bells instantly fall mute, the thundering music breaks off, the heavenly companies vanish—and in the cathedral, so lately glorious with lights and banners and solemn ceremonies, there is suddenly only the silence, only the chilly darkness of the empty naves; and at the altar, the single light burning before the Body of God."|"The Woman Who Had Two Navels and Tales of the Tropical Gothic"|"Nick Joaquin"

Behind a company of heralds appeared the mighty St. Andrew, attired in apostolic red and wreathed with laurel. Beside him walked the virgin St. Potenciana, robed in bridal white and crowned with roses. Behind them came St. Francis and St. Dominic and a great crowd of Holy Souls who had been, in life, illustrious citizens and faithful lovers of Manila. Down the aisle advanced the concourse, the cathedral doors swung open, and the Maestro followed the procession down the street to the Puerta Postigo. There the crowd paused in its chanting and, in a moment of silence so infinite you could hear the clocks all over the world intoning twelve, a key clicked audibly in the lock and (as in Jerusalem and Rome and Antioch and Salamanca and Byzantium and Paris and Alexandria and Canterbury and all the great Sees of Christendom) the gates opened and St. Sylvestre entered the city as the wild bells greeted the New Year, the two processions merging and flowing together to the cathedral."|"The Woman Who Had Two Navels and Tales of the Tropical Gothic"|"Nick Joaquin"

We were camped just outside the walls—on the grassland between the walls and the Port Companies. That night—it was New Year’s eve—I’d come back to camp early because I was feeling homesick. I was all alone in our tent, the other boys were still downtown celebrating. I lay awake a long time thinking of the war and of the folks back home and when was I going to see them. Around midnight I woke up from a doze and heard music. So I stuck my head out and I saw a kind of parade coming up the road. I wasn’t surprised then and I wasn’t surprised at anything afterward. I just told myself that you people must be having one of your New Year’s celebrations and wasn’t it too bad your churches were all smashed up. But I turned my head just then—and there was the Walled City, and it wasn’t smashed up at all. The walls were whole all the way and I could even see some kind of knights in armor moving on top of them.

Timid folk fled; braver ones—Connie among them—remained and danced nervously, waiting for the shooting to begin. Nothing happened. The politicians kept getting up and crossing the room to offer each other drinks; they smiled and shook hands and thumped each other’s backs; at midnight, they and their unsmiling constabulary very peacefully departed. But the few customers left behind, scared and disappointed, quickly developed ugly tempers. A quarrel over places, between two young men, ended with both of them whipping out pistols and firing—and with the unluckier one staggering headlong across the dance floor, doubled up and clutching his rent belly, and dropping down just a foot away from where Connie had flung herself flat on the floor.

"ap > 09:00"|"past nine"|"—I heard her say so. Saturday morning, mother called me up asking me to get her emeralds from the bank. When I brought them over I asked her was she thinking of walking in the Naval procession, because she never wears those jewels except when she joins that procession, and she hasn’t been able to since her heart began to trouble her. When she told me that Josie had offered to take her place as guardia I got suspicious right away. Josie has been thick with that guy this last month, and I felt she was up to something. So, yesterday afternoon, I dropped around again. Mother and Josie were in here, dressing for the procession; I stood just outside the door, it was open a little, and I could hear them talking. I heard mother say: “I wanted to save you, Josefa.” And Josie said, very loud: “Don’t say that, mother.” But mother said she had to say it and that Josie should listen; and then she began to talk about the Christian life and choosing between good and evil and about glory and all that piety stuff, and Josie kept telling her to stop and not to speak. Then I heard mother say: “I placed those emeralds in your hands because I wanted you to be free to choose.” She said that she knew about Josie’s crucial temptation and that she was trying to save Josie by trusting her. “Whatever you choose to do now,” mother said, “you will choose deliberately, with full consciousness; knowing what you will do to me and to yourself.” But Josie said it was no use at all, it just happened, and was happening even then; and I heard mother say: “Did you feel it too? Someone just stepped across my grave.” Then I heard a thud, and I listened but there was only silence and at last I got frightened and pushed open the door and went in. Josie was lying on the floor and mother was bending over her, crying very weakly and trying to call out. I lifted Josie and laid her in bed and she really looked as if she had fainted: she was limp and cold all over, and very pale and sweating. Of course it was all a damned fake. Oh, she had it all planned out—this fainting act, so she could stay behind, in bed, with the jewels, while mother went off to the procession. She had me fooled all right; she did look ill; I stopped being suspicious—and mother kept whispering: “Maybe I’ve saved her, maybe I’ve saved her,” and wouldn’t let Josie be disturbed. I took mother to the procession and it was past nine when we came back. I dropped mother at the door and drove on home. Mother went right up to see how Josie was—but Josie was gone already. She had left a note, just one line: “Dear Mother, I have chosen. Goodbye.” When I reached home, mother’s maid was on the phone, frantic: mother had collapsed."|"The Woman Who Had Two Navels and Tales of the Tropical Gothic"|"Nick Joaquin"

It was then that our agent on the tree saw Father Lao, gun in hand, hurrying this thug through the dark area along the wall. I had some men climb on the wall to pull them both up.

I heard how they had held you up, Mr. Estiva, and killed that taxi driver, because he was going to the police. Oh, I know they were trying to terrorize me. But they made one more effort to persuade me peacefully. At noon the next day, a girl came to my cell and talked to me of their religion. How innocent it all sounded, coming from the lips of one who looked so pretty and innocent, but was a witch, was the scarlet woman, was the whore of Babylon, and evil, evil. And then it was that I understood why God had brought me right into the fortress of the forces of evil.

But Bobby, from the first moment I stepped out there, looked at me in the oddest way. Though it’s only now I wonder about that, and how pale he became. Then, after all that shooting, I sent him to his room. I was a wreck. So I called up Father O’Brien and he said better get the boy to church. Yesterday was a Wednesday and we have this noon Mass in our parish. Bobby came with me willingly, he looked all right. We got to church some time before the Mass. So I asked him if he wanted to go to confession and he said yes. He was in the box waiting, I was watching, and when the priest opened the window Bobby jumped as though he had seen a ghost and rushed out of the church. So I ran out too and Bobby was on the steps pressing a hand to his eyes and shaking all over. I got him into a taxi and all the way home I was trying to calm him down saying Bobby this and Bobby that. And suddenly he jerked up and yelled at me: ‘I’m not Bobby, I’m not Bobby!
