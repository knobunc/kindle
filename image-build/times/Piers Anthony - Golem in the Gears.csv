00:00|midnight|"Now a huge stallion appeared, virtually snorting fire. His hide was midnight black, and his eyes glinted blacker. ""I should have known!"" the Night Stallion snorted. ""A golem in the gears!"" There was a subtle flicker."|"Golem in the Gears"|"Piers Anthony"
"~ 00:00"|"around midnight"|"Somewhere around midnight they heard something, and paused. It was a low whistling or moaning, coming from somewhere ahead, in the tunnel. ""Something's there!"" Grundy exclaimed, horrified."|"Golem in the Gears"|"Piers Anthony"
"~ 12:00"|"Around noon"|"They finished their meal and slept. Around noon the ground shuddered, somewhat the way it had when the invisible giant had stridden toward them but less so. This was the familiar whomp! whomp! of the Gap Dragon."|"Golem in the Gears"|"Piers Anthony"
"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"Next day, about noon, the Monster of the Sea arrived. First a ripple developed in the water, then a wake; finally a grotesque head poked up. The Monster had a flexible pink snout, bulging nostrils, cauliflower ears and two enormous ivory tusks. His eyes seemed beady, but as he came closer Grundy realized that they were more like bloodshot saucers; it was the size of the creature that made them seem small."|"Golem in the Gears"|"Piers Anthony"
12:00|noon|"At noon Grundy woke and got up. He peered under the bed. Snortimer still lay without moving. Yet he was not dead; Bed Monsters dissolved into dust when their ends came. There was still hope."|"Golem in the Gears"|"Piers Anthony"
