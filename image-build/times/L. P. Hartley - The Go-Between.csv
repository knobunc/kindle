"ap 01:00"|one|"It was indeed the beginning of a mild persecution—very, very mild and concealed in smiles and kindly faces; the grown-ups could not have known it was one. But it became the thing to say to me, when they came across me: “Hullo, Leo, still feeling hot?” and “Why don’t you take your jacket off—you’d be more comfortable without it”—with a light laugh for this impossible request, for in those days dress was much more ceremonious and jackets were not lightly discarded. I came to dread these pleasantries, they seemed to spring up all round me like rows of gas-jets scorching me, and I turned redder than I was already. The frightful feeling of being marked out for ridicule came back in all its strength. I don’t think I was unduly sensitive; in my experience most people mind being laughed at more than anything else. What causes wars, what makes them drag on so interminably, but the fear of losing face? I avoided even Marcus, for I didn’t dare to tell him what was troubling me."|"The Go-Between"|"L. P. Hartley"
"ap ~ 06:00"|"about six o’clock"|"We trooped down the path, six of us—Marian and Denys, a young man and a young woman whose names are in my diary but whose faces I cannot remember—and Marcus and I bringing up the rear. It was about six o’clock, but the heat still lingered—not burning, but diffused and benign. We went through a wicket gate into a belt of trees. I was often to go that way on hotter days; but never again did I get quite the same impression of cold succeeding heat. The trees were very thick, they wrapped us round; the stillness was infectious, no one spoke. We came to a road between the trees and followed it, and then scrambled down a steep tree-lined bank and over a stile into a meadow. Another stage nearer the experience! Under the renewed assault of the heat we started talking again, and Marcus said:"|"The Go-Between"|"L. P. Hartley"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"BREAKFAST at Brandham Hall started with family prayers at nine o’clock. These were read by Mr. Maudsley sitting at the head of the table (all the dishes were on the sideboard). The chairs were drawn back and ranged round the walls; they were all alike, I think, but I had my favourite chair, which I could distinguish by certain signs, and I always tried to get it. After the gong had gone, the servants filed in, headed by the butler wearing his most solemn air. I always counted them but could never make them more than ten, though there were said to be twelve in the house. The family were less regular in attendance. Mrs. Maudsley was always there; Marcus and I made it a point of honour; Denys came from time to time and Marian, who was seldom there at the opening, sometimes came in half-way through. On the whole, rather more than half the guests used to attend. It was in no way compulsory, Marcus told me; but most households that were not “fast” had family prayers (I dared not tell him that ours hadn’t). His father rather liked one to go, but would not be angry if one didn’t."|"The Go-Between"|"L. P. Hartley"
"ap 00:52"|"twelve fifty-two"|"I had just reached this conclusion when the last hymn was announced. What a long service, almost a record! It was twelve fifty-two. The sidesmen were doing their rounds; and the expression of the one who mounted the transept steps and came towards us justified me in thinking that we were something special, so respectful was it."|"The Go-Between"|"L. P. Hartley"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"I looked at my watch and calculated. “We don’t have tea till five o’clock,” I said. “That’s rather late, isn’t it? At home we have it earlier. I could wait—well, ten or fifteen minutes.”"|"The Go-Between"|"L. P. Hartley"
"ap > 06:00"|"past six"|"Poor effort as it was, the letter took me a long time to write, and it was past six when, hot-foot, I reached the game larder. I expected something sensational and I was not disappointed. The mercury had declined to eighty-five; but the marker, nearly half an inch above it, recorded ninety-four. Ninety-four! Perhaps it was a record, a record at any rate for England, where I believed the shade temperature had never reached a hundred. It was my ambition that it should. Only six degrees to go! A mere trifle, the sun could easily accomplish that; perhaps it would tomorrow. As I stood musing, I seemed to feel within me the world’s tremendous meteorological effort to excel itself, to pass into a region of being which it had never attained before. I was myself the mercury (had I not been called Mercury, I thought confusedly) soaring ever to new heights; and Brandham Hall with its still unexplored altitudes of feeling was the mountain on which my experience would be won. I felt intoxicated and light-headed, as though some miraculous boon had been granted to me, something that took me outside myself and the limitations of my normal personality. Yet it was not a solitary experience, it was linked inseparably with the expectation that I saw reflected in the faces round me. They too were looking forward to a fulfilment, and I knew its stages as distinctly as if they had been rungs in a ladder: the cricket match, my birthday party, and the ball."|"The Go-Between"|"L. P.

"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"Elated by my victory, I left him, and made tracks for the game larder. It was three o’clock. The thermometer stood at ninety. It might still go up. Passionately I willed it to, and seemed to feel around me the unspoken response of Nature to my plea.

No other sounds disturbed the stillness."|"The Go-Between"|"L. P. Hartley"

I was not cast down; indeed, I was relieved. My belief that the telegram would come was unshakable and now I had an extra respite in hand, a respite from the respite, so to speak; for I didn’t relish the prospect of breaking to Mrs. Maudsley the news of my abrupt departure (which I had fixed in my mind for Thursday at latest), nor did I know how I should get it to her, since she was in bed.

"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"I had taken a first step by falsifying the time of his appointment. Marian would not find him in the outhouse at six o’clock; and would she wait a whole half-hour for him? I doubted it; I relied on the impatience that was one of her most obvious characteristics. She could not wait. She could not wait to hear an explanation; she could not wait for one to finish a sentence; the boredom of waiting upset her physically. Two minutes’ grace, I was sure, would be the utmost she would give to Ted; and in the exasperation of waiting her feelings for him might alter. To keep a grown-up person waiting was a serious offence, even among themselves. She might be angry with him, for she could be angry as well as he. “I’ll never come again! I’ll never come again!” And Ted: “Well, if you waited for me, so have I waited for you, and a lot longer too, and I’m a busy man, and it’s harvest-time.” “Pooh! You’re only a farmer, it doesn’t matter keeping farmers waiting.” “Oh, I’m only a farmer, am I? Well, we’ll see,” etc., etc."|"The Go-Between"|"L. P. Hartley"

I picked up the lock and looked at it again. What was the combination of letters that had opened it?
