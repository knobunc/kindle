04:30|"four-thirty in the morning"|"I wish to thank my friend Jeffrey Levin most cordially for his generous, patient, and valiant efforts to establish, after years of increasingly garbled editions, a correct and consistent text for these three novels. I don’t know anybody else who would restore commas, discover dropped sentences, and change “ingenious” back to “ingenuous” at four-thirty in the morning. He is hereby awarded the Order of the Golden Dele, First Class."|"Worlds of Exile and Illusion"|"Ursula K. le Guin"
"<< 12:00"|"long before noon"|"That night on the hillside by the campfire was Falk’s last with those who were to him his brothers, his own people. Next morning they were on the trail again a little after sunrise, and long before noon they came to a wide, overgrown trace leading to the left off the path to Ransifel. There was a kind of gateway to it made by two great pines. It was dark and still under their boughs where they stopped."|"Worlds of Exile and Illusion"|"Ursula K. le Guin"
00:00|midnight|"His days were all the same. Gray winter light; a wind blowing; forest-clad hills and valleys, long slopes, brush-hidden streams, swampy lowlands. Though badly overgrown the Hirand Road was easy to follow, for it led in long straight shafts or long easy curves, avoiding the bogs and the heights. In the hills Falk realized it followed the course of some great ancient highway, for its way had been cut right through the hills, and two thousand years had not effaced it wholly. But the trees grew on it and beside it and all about it, pine and hemlock, vast holly-thickets on the slopes, endless stands of beech, oak, hickory, alder, ash, elm, all overtopped and crowned by the lordly chestnuts only now losing their last dark-yellow leaves, dropping their fat brown burrs along the path. At night he cooked the squirrel or rabbit or wild hen he had bagged from among the infinity of little game that scurried and flitted here in the kingdom of the trees; he gathered beechnuts and walnuts, roasted the chestnuts on his campfire coals. But the nights were bad. There were two evil dreams that followed him each day and always caught up with him by midnight. One was of being stealthily pursued in the darkness by a person he could never see. The other was worse. He dreamed that he had forgotten to bring something with him, something important, essential, without which he would be lost. From this dream he woke and knew that it was true: he was lost; it was himself he had forgotten. He would build up his fire then if it was not raining and would crouch beside it, too sleepy and dream-bemused to take up the book he carried, the Old Canon, and seek comfort in the words which declared that when all ways are lost the Way lies clear. A man all alone is a miserable thing. And he knew he was not even a man but at best a kind of half-being, trying to find his wholeness by setting out aimlessly to cross a continent under uninterested stars. The days were all the same, but they were a relief after the nights."|"Worlds of Exile and Illusion"|"Ursula K. le Guin"
"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"These were clean woods of stately, wide-aisled deciduous trees. He went on at a good pace the rest of that day, and the next morning. The country was growing hilly again, the ridges all running north-south across his way, and around noon, heading for what looked from one ridge like the low point of the next, he became embroiled in a marshy valley full of streams. He searched for fords, floundered in boggy watermeadows, all in a cold heavy rain. Finally as he found a way up out of the gloomy valley the weather began to break up, and as he climbed the ridge the sun came out ahead of him under the clouds and sent a wintry glory raying down among the naked branches, brightening them and the great trunks and the ground with wet gold. That cheered him; he went on sturdily, figuring to walk till day’s end before he camped. Everything was bright now and utterly silent except for the drip of rain from twig-ends and the far-off wistful whistle of a chickadee. Then he heard, as in his dream, the steps that followed behind him to his left."|"Worlds of Exile and Illusion"|"Ursula K. le Guin"
12:00|noon|"It came from a low doorway, through which, when he got close, he could see an upswell of ground, treetops, and the rosy sky of evening or morning, which dazzled his eyes like a midsummer noon. He stopped inside the door because of that dazzlement, and because a motionless figure stood just outside."|"Worlds of Exile and Illusion"|"Ursula K. le Guin"
12:00|noon|"When he woke she was making a stand of bricks over the fire to support a kettle filled with snow. “It looks like late afternoon outside,” she said, “but it could be morning, or noon for that matter. The storm’s as thick as ever. They can’t track us. And if they did, still they couldn’t get in this place…This kettle was in the cache with the blankets. And there’s a bag of dried peas. We’ll do well enough here.” The hard, delicate face turned to him with a faint smile. “It’s dark, though. I don’t like the thick walls and the dark.”"|"Worlds of Exile and Illusion"|"Ursula K. le Guin"
12:00|noon|"His fool womenfolk came squealing around him, and he got mixed up and angry. But old Kerly drove them all off, gave him back his spear that one of them had taken from him, and fastened at his neck the cape of gray korio-fur she had made for him in autumn. There was one left who knew what a man was. She watched him in silence and he felt her grieving pride. So he walked very erect. She was a cross old woman and he was a foolish old man, but pride remained. He climbed up into the cold, bright noon, hearing beyond the walls the calling of foreign voices."|"Worlds of Exile and Illusion"|"Ursula K. le Guin"
12:00|noon|"“Jakob,” murmured Seiko Esmit, coming between him and the older man. He realized he had been yelling at Dermat, and tried to get hold of himself. But it was damned hard to come in from a bloody fight like that defense of the Sea Gate and have to cope with a case of male hysteria. His head ached violently; the scalp wound he had got in one of their raids on the Gaal camp still hurt, though it should have healed already; he had got off unhurt at the Sea Gate, but he was filthy with other men’s blood. Against the high, unshuttered windows of the library the snow streaked and whispered. It was noon; it seemed dusk. Beneath the windows lay the Square with its well-guarded barricades. Beyond those lay the abandoned houses, the defenseless walls, the city of snow and shadows."|"Worlds of Exile and Illusion"|"Ursula K. le Guin"
"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"Landing about noon in a field of ray clay, Rocannon and the two servants, Raho and Yahan, looked about blankly, seeing no sign of life. Mogien said with the absolute confidence of his caste, “They’ll come.”"|"Worlds of Exile and Illusion"|"Ursula K. le Guin"
12:00|noon|"At noon they rested a couple of hours by the river whose southwest course they were following to the sea; at dusk they flew down to a little castle, on a hilltop like all Angyar castles, near a bend of the same river. There they were made welcome by the lord of the place and his household. Curiosity obviously itched in him at the sight of a Fian traveling by windsteed, along with the Lord of Hallan, four midmen, and one who spoke with a queer accent, dressed like a lord, but wore no swords and was white-faced like a midman. To be sure, there was more intermingling between the two castes, the Angyar and Olgyior, than most Angyar like to admit; there were light-skinned warriors, and gold-haired servants; but this “Wanderer” was altogether too anomalous. Wanting no further rumor of his presence on the planet, Rocannon said nothing, and their host dared ask no questions of the heir of Hallan; so if he ever found out who his strange guests had been, it was from minstrels singing the tale, years later."|"Worlds of Exile and Illusion"|"Ursula K. le Guin"
"> 12:00"|"A little after midday"|"A little after midday they looked down from the ridge across a broad inlet running east and west as far as eye could see, lead-gray under a low sky. Nothing of the southern shore could be made out but a line of low, dark, dim hills. The wind that blew up the sound was bitter cold at their backs as they worked down to the shore and started westward along it. Yahan looked up at the clouds, hunched his head down between his shoulders and said mournfully, “It’s going to snow.”"|"Worlds of Exile and Illusion"|"Ursula K. le Guin"
"< 12:00"|"Before midday"|"The next day dawned clear. As on a morning of coldyear, the sun’s ruddy-white brilliance was blinding on the snow-whitened hills. Before midday Piai’s two companions arrived with a few of the downy gray pelliun-furs. Black-browed, strapping men like all those southern Olgyior, they seemed still wilder than Piai, wary as animals of the strangers, avoiding them, glancing at them only sideways."|"Worlds of Exile and Illusion"|"Ursula K. le Guin"
12:00|noon|"They had thought to cross a stream soon, but they did not. Either the stream-courses now were running north-south, or there simply were no more. The plain or pampas that seemed never to change as they walked had been becoming always a little dryer, a little grayer. This morning they saw none of the peya bushes, only the coarse gray-green grass going on and on.
At noon Rocannon stopped.
“It’s no good, Yahan,” he said."|"Worlds of Exile and Illusion"|"Ursula K. le Guin"
12:00|noon|"They built up a pyre of branches and brushwood, and on it laid Raho, whom they had borne from the city, and beside him his hunting-bow and arrows. Yahan made a new fire, and Mogien set the wood alight. They mounted the windsteeds, Kyo behind Mogien and Yahan behind Rocannon, and rose spiraling around the smoke and heat of the fire that blazed in the sunlight of noon on a hilltop in the strange land."|"Worlds of Exile and Illusion"|"Ursula K. le Guin"
"~ 12:00"|"About noon"|"About noon they came to a hard stretch: a cliff-face sticking out like a shield, over which they would have to crawl roped together. “From the air you might see a better path for us to follow, Mogien,” Rocannon suggested. “I wish the other steed would come.” He had a sense of urgency; he wanted to be off this bare gray mountainside and be hidden down among trees."|"Worlds of Exile and Illusion"|"Ursula K. le Guin"
"< 00:00"|"before midnight"|"He had chosen a night when of all four moons only the little captured asteroid, Heliki, would be in the sky before midnight. It brightened over the hills as he neared a row of hangars, like a black reef on the gray sea of cement, but no one saw him, and he sensed no one near. There were no fences and few guards. Their watch was kept by machines that scanned space for light-years around the Fomalhaut system. What had they to fear, after all, from the Bronze Age aborigines of the little nameless planet?"|"Worlds of Exile and Illusion"|"Ursula K. le Guin"
