05:00|"five a.m."|"
It was five a.m. Rain rustled out the sky, not hard, but with a…
"|Thud!|"Terry Pratchett"
08:00|"eight o’clock in the morning"|"“The very same, Nobby,” said Colon magisterially. “She does the cleaning in there. And it appears that when she come in at eight o’clock in the morning ae-em, with no one else about, Nobby, well, I hardly like to say this, but it appears she took it into her head to have a twirl on the pole.”"|Thud!|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|Midnight|"“Dunny Wagon not found in root dictionary. Searching slang dictionary…mip…mip…mip…Dunny Wagon, n.: cart for carrying night soil (see also Honey Wagon, Treacle Wagon, Midnight Special, Gong Wagon, and variants),” said the imp."|Thud!|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|Midnight|"“That right,” said Vimes, who hadn’t heard the Midnight Special one before. “Can you?”"|Thud!|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"It looked like a city. Ghostly, wavering buildings appeared through a drizzle of midnight rain. Of course, no two minds were alike…"|Thud!|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 05:49"|"eleven minutes to six"|"“Well? What have you got to say?”
“It’s eleven minutes to six, Insert Name Here,” said the imp meekly.
“Good grief! Why didn’t you tell me!” Vimes looked aghast."|Thud!|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 06:00"|"Six o’clock"|"“Yes, but not—” Vimes stopped. Eleven minutes. He couldn’t run it, not at this time of day. “Six o’clock is…important,” he muttered."|Thud!|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap ~ 05:55"|"gone five to six"|"He wasn’t going to make it. It must be gone five to six already. The thought of it, the thought of that little face—"|Thud!|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 06:00"|"Six o’clock"|"He’d be home in time. Would a minute have mattered? No, probably not, although his young son appeared to have a very accurate internal clock. Possibly even two minutes would be okay. Three minutes, even. You could go to five, perhaps. But that was just it. If you could go to five minutes, then you’d go to ten, then half an hour, a couple of hours…and not see your son all evening. So that was that. Six o’clock, prompt. Every day. Read to Young Sam. No excuses. He’d promised himself that. No excuses. No excuses at all. Once you had a good excuse, you opened the door to bad excuses."|Thud!|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"Shouting incoherent thanks, he leapt down as the coach slowed, flailed to stay upright, and skidded into his driveway. The front door was already opening when he raced toward it, scattering gravel, and there was Willikins holding up The Book. Vimes grabbed it and pounded up the stairs as, down in the city, the clocks began to mark various approximations of the hour of six o’clock."|Thud!|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"The happy silence enveloped Vimes, but it couldn’t last. There was The Reading Of The Picture Book to be undertaken. That was the meaning of six o’clock."|Thud!|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"“Yes, sir. The word is that they’ll start at nine. Arrangements have been made, I gather."|Thud!|"Terry Pratchett"
05:00|"five a.m."|"It was five a.m.
Rain rustled out the sky, not hard, but with a gentle persistence."|Thud!|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 05:29"|"twenty-nine minutes past five"|"“It’s twenty-nine minutes past five, Insert Name Here,” said the imp nervously."|Thud!|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"“On foot, at this time of day, you will need to leave now to be home at six o’clock,” said the imp."|Thud!|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"And I’m going home, Vimes repeated to himself. Everyone wants something from Vimes, even though I’m not the sharpest knife in the drawer. Hell, I’m probably a spoon. Well, I’m going to be Vimes, and Vimes reads Where’s My Cow? to Young Sam at six o’clock. With the noises done right."|Thud!|"Terry Pratchett"
"< 00:00"|"almost midnight"|"It was almost midnight, and there was Vetinari at his desk, fresh as a daisy and chilly as morning dew."|Thud!|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 07:51"|"nine minutes to eight"|"“Good morning!” he said brightly to the surprised imp. “What is the time, please?”
“Er…nine minutes to eight, Insert Name Here,” said the imp.
“So that would mean a speed slightly above one mile a minute,” mused Vimes. “Very good.”"|Thud!|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 05:30"|"half past five"|"They had to stop twice to get directions, and were twenty miles from Koom Valley at half past five. There was a coaching inn. They sat out in its yard. No one spoke much. Apart from the speed-hungry Willikins, the only people not shaken by the journey were Sybil and Young Sam, who seemed quite happy, and Detritus, who had watched the world skim past with every sign of enjoyment. Brick was still facedown on the coach roof, holding tight."|Thud!|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"On the sedate journey into town, and because it was six o’clock, Vimes read Where’s My Cow? to Young Sam. In fact, it became a communal effort. Cheery obliged by handling the chicken noises, an area in which Vimes felt he was somewhat lacking, and Detritus delivered a HRUUUGH! that rattled the windows. Grag Bashfullsson, against all expectation, managed a very passable pig. To Young Sam, watching with eyes like saucers, it was indeed the Show Of The Year."|Thud!|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 05:30"|"half past five"|"Out in the hall, a big grandfather clock had just stopped chiming half past five."|Thud!|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 05:30"|"half past five"|"“He’s never late,” Sybil went on. “He says if you’re late for a good reason you’ll be late for a bad one. And it’s only half past five, anyway.”"|Thud!|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 06:00"|six|"“Only the other day, he was running up the stairs as the clocks were striking six,” Sybil said, calmly soaping Young Sam with a sponge shaped like a teddy bear. “The very last second. You wait and see.”"|Thud!|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 05:54"|"six minutes to six"|"“Although things can be very treacherous in the lower valley at this time of—” her husband began, and was fried into silence by his wife’s stare.
It was six minutes to six.
"|Thud!|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 05:55"|"five minutes to six"|"“You weren’t listening! I was shouting and you weren’t listening!” the imp whined. “It’s five minutes to six! Read to Young Sam!”"|Thud!|"Terry Pratchett"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"I’d sooner be walking all by myself along Treacle Mine Road at three in the morning, Vimes thought. In the rain, with the gutters gushing. But it was a wife thing. She took such a…a pride in him. He could never work out why."|Thud!|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap > 06:00"|"past six o’clock"|"King Rhys turned in his seat, leaned across the two empty places, and said to the Diamond King: “Do you think something has happened to them? It’s past six o’clock!”"|Thud!|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 01:00"|one|"*Who wasn’t an Igor, but was merely called one. It was best not to have fun with him on this subject, and especially not to ask him to sew your head back on."|Thud!|"Terry Pratchett"
