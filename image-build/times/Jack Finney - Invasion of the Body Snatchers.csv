"ap ~ 06:00"|"around six o'clock"|"For me it began around six o'clock, a Thursday evening, August 13, 1953, when I let my last patient - a sprained thumb - out of the side door of my office, with the feeling the day wasn't over for me. And I wished I weren't a doctor, because with me that kind of hunch is often right. I've gone on a vacation certain I'd be back in a day or so; as I was, for a measles epidemic. I've gone to bed staggering-tired, knowing I'd be up in a couple hours driving out to a country call; as I did, have done often, and will again."|"Invasion of the Body Snatchers"|"Jack Finney"
"ap 06:00"|six|"So when I heard the light rapping on the outer locked door of my reception room, I just wanted to stand there motionless till whoever it was went away. In any other business you could do that, but not in mine. My nurse had gone - she'd probably raced the last patient to the stairway, winning handily - and now, for a moment or so, one foot on the radiator under the window, I just sipped my drink, looking down at the street and pretending, as the gentle rapping began again, that I wasn't going to answer it. It wasn't dark yet, and wouldn't be for sometime, but it wasn't full daylight any more, either. A few neon lights had come on, and Main Street below was empty - at six, around here, nearly everyone is eating - and I felt lonely and depressed."|"Invasion of the Body Snatchers"|"Jack Finney"
"ap 05:10"|Five-ten|"""I know,"" I said. ""I have the same feeling, the feeling that the world better hope we handle this right."" In medicine sometimes, on a puzzling case, an answer or a clue will pop up out of nowhere; the subconscious mind at work, I suppose. I said, ""Jack, how tall are you?""
""Five-ten.""
""Exactly?"""|"Invasion of the Body Snatchers"|"Jack Finney"
"ap 05:10"|Five-ten|"""How tall would you say the body downstairs is?""
He looked at me for a moment, then said, ""Five-ten.""
""And what do you weigh?"""|"Invasion of the Body Snatchers"|"Jack Finney"
"ap 01:40"|"One forty"|"""One forty."" He nodded. ""Yeah, just about what that body downstairs weighs. You've hit it; it's my size and build. Doesn't especially look like me, though."""|"Invasion of the Body Snatchers"|"Jack Finney"
"ap ~ 00:00"|"around twelve"|"We sat then, and talked some more - quite a while, in fact - staring down at the tiny lights of the town in the little valley below. But no one said anything much that hadn't already been said, and around twelve, most of the lights in the town below now out, Becky and I stood up to leave. The Belicecs got their coats, and drove downtown with us to pick up Jack's car. It was parked on Sutter Place, a block and a half from the movie, and when we stopped beside their car, and they got out, I repeated to Theodora what I'd said about waking Jack up and beating it out of there if the body in their basement started to alter in any way. I got some half-strength Seconal out of my satchel and gave it to Jack, and told him that one ought to get him to sleep. Then they said good night - Jack smiling a little, Theodora not bothering to try - got into their car, and we waved, and drove on."|"Invasion of the Body Snatchers"|"Jack Finney"
"ap 03:00"|"three o'clock"|"Some two hours later when the phone rang, my bed lamp was still on; I'd been reading, not expecting I could fall asleep for a while, yet I had, right away. It was three o'clock; reaching out for the phone, I noted the time automatically."|"Invasion of the Body Snatchers"|"Jack Finney"
09:00|"nine in the morning"|"Then Jack sat on the edge of the bed and watched her for a long time, twenty minutes maybe, holding her hand flat between his two palms, staring at her face. I sat in my pyjamas on the other side of the room, in a big easy chair, smoking, till Jack finally looked up at me. Then I nodded my head, and deliberately spoke in a normally loud tone: ""She'll sleep for several hours at least, Jack; maybe even till eight or nine in the morning. Then she'll wake up hungry, and she'll be all right."""|"Invasion of the Body Snatchers"|"Jack Finney"
"~ 00:00"|"around midnight"|"""On September 2, 1944, in the middle of the night, a woman phoned the police; someone had tried to kill her neighbour with poison gas. This neighbour, a woman, had awakened around midnight; her hushand was at work on the night shift of a factory. The woman's room was filled with a peculiar, sweet-smelling, sickening odour. She tried to get up, but her legs were paralyzed. She managed to crawl to the phone and call her neighbour, who notified the police."|"Invasion of the Body Snatchers"|"Jack Finney"
"ap 03:30"|three-thirty|"My nurse had come in while Mrs. Seeley was talking, and brought in my appointment list. I glanced down it, now, and - sure enough - there was the name of one of the three mothers of high-school girls who had called on me so frantically the week before. She was down for three-thirty, and later that afternoon, when my nurse ushered her in, she was smiling, and before she even sat down, began telling me what I knew I'd hear. The girls were all right, and fonder than ever of their English instructor. The teacher had accepted their apologies gracefully, showing some understanding of what had happened; and she'd made the sensible suggestion that the girls simply explain to their schoolmates that it had all been a joke, a schoolgirl hoax. They'd done this, and successfully. Their friends, the mother in my office assured me, actually admired the girls' skill as pranksters, and now she, the mother, wasn't worried a bit. Dr. Kaufman had explained to her how easily such a delusion can affect a person, particularly adolescent girls."|"Invasion of the Body Snatchers"|"Jack Finney"
"~ 20:00"|"around eight that evening"|"I pulled into my driveway around eight that evening, after my round of house calls, and I saw that they'd waited supper for me. It was still light, and Theodora and Becky were out on the porch, wearing aprons they'd found in the house somewhere, and setting out supper on the wide wooden porch rails. They waved at me, smiling, and upstairs from an open window, as I slammed the car door, I could hear Jack's typewriter, and the house seemed alive once again with people I liked, and I felt wonderful."|"Invasion of the Body Snatchers"|"Jack Finney"
02:21|"2.21 in the morning"|"The time was 2.21 in the morning; I'd just glanced at my watch and there were nine minutes to go before I woke Jack for his shift. I was patrolling the house, walking soundlessly along the upstairs hallway in my stocking feet; and now I stopped at the door of Becky's room. Noiselessly I opened it, walked in, and then, for the third time since midnight, I explored every inch of that room with my flashlight, just as I had every other room in the house. Stooping, I swept the beam under her bed; then I opened the closet and examined it."|"Invasion of the Body Snatchers"|"Jack Finney"

"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"""All right, all right"" - his voice was placating. ""I'll do what I can, do all I can. If it's what you really want, I'll give this whole story to my colonel within an hour; I'll go see him and wake him up; he lives here in Georgetown. I'll tell him just what you've told me, as well as I've followed it. And I'll add my own report that I know you well, that you're a sane, sober, intelligent citizen, and that I am personally certain you're speaking the truth, or believe that you are. But that's all I can do, Miles, absolutely all, even if it means the end of the world before noon."""|"Invasion of the Body Snatchers"|"Jack Finney"
"ap 03:00"|"three o'clock"|"We were asleep in less than five minutes, I suppose. I lay, not touching Becky, except for an arm around her waist, and she had both hands clasped over mine, holding it tight, like a child. And we slept, simply slept, for the rest of the night. We were tired; I'd had no sleep at all since three o'clock of the night before. Anyway, there's a time and place for everything, and while this may have been the place, it wasn't the time for a million reasons. We slept."|"Invasion of the Body Snatchers"|"Jack Finney"
12:00|noon|"If I dreamed, no traces remained in my memory; I simply left the world and life for complete exhausted oblivion, and it was the best thing that could have happened to me. I might have slept on till noon, I think, but around eight-thirty, quarter to nine, I turned over, bumped into someone, and heard her sigh.

11:02|"two minutes after eleven that morning"|"At two minutes after eleven that morning, Jack shifted into second and began to curse, as we turned off the highway onto the Santa Mira road, and the last few miles to home. We were charged with a terrible urgency to get there, now - to move, to act - but this road was a hopeless dusty mess of great twisted ruts, sharp-edged little chuckholes, and frequent wider, deeper holes that could break an axle if you did more than slowly ease your car into and out of them again. ""The one road into Santa Mira,"" Jack said angrily, ""and they let it fall apart."" He pulled hard on the wheel to bring us out of a rut and avoid a miniature gully just ahead. ""Typical town-council stupidity,"" he burst out. ""They let this one go to pieces because the new state road was coming through town, then change their minds, and veto the new road. Miles, you read about that?"" I said no, and Jack said, ""Yeah, in the Tribune. The council's against the highway now; it would spoil the quiet residential quality of the town, they say,"" Jack said bitterly. ""And now surveying's stopped, and looks like they'll re-route the new highway. Leaving us with one practically impassable road, and with the winter rains coming on, there's no point fixing it now."" The rear bumper guards scraped dirt, as the back wheels lurched out of a hole, and Jack cursed and complained steadily until eleven-thirty, when we passed the black-and-white Santa Mira City Limits sign, population 3,890."|"Invasion of the Body Snatchers"|"Jack Finney"

"ap 00:30"|twelve-thirty|"There was nothing I could say to that, and I simply nodded.

It took a while before Miss Wyandotte came out from the file room again; I'd finished my cigarette, and noticed it was twelve-twenty, before she appeared, smiling, with the big, cloth-covered, newspaper-sized book stamped Santa Mira Tribune, April, May, June, 1953. She laid it on the table beside, us, and we thanked her; the date-line on Jack's Santa Mira clipping had been May 9, and I opened the big book and found the Tribune for the day before."|"Invasion of the Body Snatchers"|"Jack Finney"
