"~ 19:03"|"around 1903"|"Labor demonstrations had started in earnest in the nitrate fields around 1903, tied to the growth of anarcho-syndicalist resistance societies across all of Chile for all sorts of laborers. Small strikes were used in the beginning, perhaps a daylong work stoppage at a mill when the men and their families would gather to hear speeches in the plaza. Almost always the mill owners would refuse to bargain, and the government would step in and get the laborers back to work."|"The Alchemy of Air"|"Thomas Hager"
"ap ~ 05:00"|"around 500"|"The strike leaders under the flag were shot first. “As though struck by lightning they fell,” wrote a witness. The crowd panicked. It was reported that some of the strikers had weapons and might have tried to use them. The machine gunners strafed the schoolyard, firing for what seemed like a few minutes, no one was quite sure. There were cries and screams, there were many women and children. The crowd broke and ran; the schoolyard emptied. Only bodies were left behind. Iquique officials claimed that 126 strikers died; the British minister in Santiago estimated somewhere around 500. Historians now believe that somewhere between 1,000 and 3,000 workers, spouses, and children were killed. There were no reports of any military casualties. The surviving workers streamed back up the hills and across the desert to their mills."|"The Alchemy of Air"|"Thomas Hager"

troops were again gathered. And again the wind refused to cooperate. Through the morning and into 
the afternoon it kept blowing toward the German lines. Late in the day it finally reversed, and 
at long last the order came to release the gas. About 5:00 p.m., with perfect precision, 
Haber’s gas troops opened their canisters. A wall of chlorine gas four miles long began 
slowly advancing toward the French."|"The Alchemy of Air"|"Thomas Hager"
19:17|1917|"TWO YEARS AFTER Clara committed suicide, 
Fritz Haber asked Charlotte Nathan to marry him. It surprised no one and seemed to please no one. 
The former business manager of Haber’s Berlin club was twenty years younger than her new 
husband and an “extraordinarily attractive woman,” according to a Haber biographer. 
At Haber’s insistence, Charlotte, like Clara, converted to Christianity, which allowed them 
to be married in Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial, a grand neo-Romanesque church in the center of Berlin. 
It was 1917 and the war was entering its fourth year. Haber wore his uniform, replete with dress 
sword and spiked helmet."|"The Alchemy of Air"|"Thomas Hager"
