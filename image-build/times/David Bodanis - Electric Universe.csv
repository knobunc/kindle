12:00|noon|"There were psychological shifts as well. Before electricity became widespread, time had been something local, changeable, personal. New York and Baltimore, for example, had kept their clock systems several minutes apart, since they were at slightly different longitudes, and noon arrived a few minutes later in Baltimore than it did in New York. Each city was a separate world, so it was fair to think that each individual, strolling here or there, or working on this or that isolated farm, was part of a similarly separate world. But now those worlds could be synchronized and, wherever you were, you knew where you fit in the tight, universal “control” of clocked time."|"Electric Universe"|"David Bodanis"

But it’s also one of the most expensive metals known, and pretty soon he moved on to cheaper ones, at one point thinking he might succeed with heated nickel wires. This didn’t burst into flames as much as his previous tries, but even when it just glowed, the light was too strong: “Owing to the enormous power of the light,” Edison jotted in his notebook, “. . . suffered the pains of hell with my eye last night from 10:00 P.M. to 4:00 A.M. . . .

"ap 03:00"|"three-o’clock"|"That’s an electric motor. (You can often hear this mechanism inside a running motor, for if there are two electromagnets, each whirring to a start and stop 110 times per second, there will be 220 separate whirs. That creates a hum not far from middle C.) To get power from it, you just grab on to the part that’s spinning around. Going back to our imagined example, if you hung a thread from the minute hand of this peculiar clock, the electromagnets luring the minute hand along in a circle would only be strong enough to tug along a doll-sized wicker basket dangling from the thread. Scale up the device, though, as Edison and others did, so that giant electromagnets are providing the power at the three-o’clock and nine-o’clock positions in the motor, and the metal rod that’s being tugged in a circle will be powerful enough to drag a ton or more of elevator straight up a shaft in a tall building."|"Electric Universe"|"David Bodanis"

"> 19:00"|"after seven P.M."|"Electric motors did more. Streetcar companies that had installed big power stations to pull their cars found that after seven P.M., when workers were at home, there was little use for their product. What could they do with the spare capacity? One solution was the invention of the modern amusement park. Electrically operated rollercoasters and brightly lit arcades appeared at the edges of cities throughout America and in parts of western Europe. By 1901, most of the largest U.S. cities had such amusement parks, powered and owned by local electric streetcar companies."|"Electric Universe"|"David Bodanis"

"~ 05:30"|"Around 5:30 a.m."|"Around 5:30 a.m., the radar operators in the easternmost radar stations in Britain detected a German air formation assembling over Amiens in France. Soon there was another one over Dieppe, then a third north of Cherbourg. The German pilots had every reason to think they were unobserved, for they had no way of detecting the electric and magnetic waves that surged through the metal wings of their planes and produced the signals that—only a fraction of a second later—were accurately received back in England. But when those several hundred planes did reach English airspace for their surprise attack, ten RAF squadrons were waiting for them. As a contemporary observer put it, “Inhospitably, the reception committee turned all these overseas visitors away.”"|"Electric Universe"|"David Bodanis"
00:00|midnight|"The Royal Navy wasn’t there, however, and increasingly urgent radio messages and even bright flares didn’t seem to help. But as headlights from German trucks appeared near the clifftop above, the navy’s landing craft arrived, lots of them, and their heavier guns meant the fresh enemy troops above would be no problem. Most of the escaping troops were left to wallow all the way back to England in the unwieldy landing craft (though they were given rum once aboard), but Cox was taken aside and quickly transferred to a speedboat, then led roaring at over twenty knots toward Portsmouth with two Royal Navy destroyers nearby and soon a flight of Spitfires giving further cover overhead. He made it ashore, was given a fast motorcade ride to London, and, after a quick debriefing and delivery of the precious Würzburg parts, was granted as much leave as he wanted. By midnight he’d made it all the way to his home in the small town of Wisbech, in East Anglia. There was one fire in the house, and his father, mother, grandparents, wife, and toddler child were waiting for him around it. Cox marched in, and as he remembered:"|"Electric Universe"|"David Bodanis"
23:00|"eleven P.M."|"At eleven P.M. the planes were far over the dark North Sea, still unseen. In the radio headsets of the aircrew, broadcasts sent rippling out from England led to electrons vibrating over minuscule distances, and then magnified into audible sound. Inside the downward-looking radars, more electrons were hurtling through their miniature copper-bound channels, flinging down tight radio waves. There are relatively few loose electrons in water to respond, so when the oscilloscopes showed only blackness, the navigators knew they were over the cold waters of the North Sea."|"Electric Universe"|"David Bodanis"
