16:15|"4:15 that afternoon"|"At 4:15 that afternoon Poirot sat in Mrs. Oliver’s drawing room sipping appreciatively at a large cup of chocolate topped with foaming whipped cream which his hostess had just placed on a small table beside him. She added a small plate full of langue de chats biscuits."|"Third Girl"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 06:50"|"Ten minutes to seven"|"Mrs. Oliver glanced down at her wrist. Ten minutes to seven. About the right time, as far as she could judge. The kind of time when girls in jobs might be presumed to have returned, either to renew their makeup, change their clothes to tight exotic pants or whatever their particular addiction was, and go out again, or else to settle down to home life and wash their smalls and their stockings. Anyway, quite a sensible time to try. The block was exactly the same on the east and the west, with big swing doors set in the centre. Mrs. Oliver chose the left-hand side but immediately found that she was wrong. All this side was numbers from 100 to 200. She crossed over to the other side."|"Third Girl"|"Agatha Christie"
10:00|"Ten a.m."|"She considered another visit to Borodene Mansions. Something still to be found out there, perhaps? She would have to think of another excuse for going there. She wasn’t quite sure what excuse she would use but anyway, that seemed the only possible place where more information could be obtained. What was the time? Ten a.m. There were certain possibilities…."|"Third Girl"|"Agatha Christie"
05:00|"Five o’clock in the morning"|"“Pitched herself out of a window—seventh floor—only a week ago, it was. Five o’clock in the morning. Funny time to choose.”"|"Third Girl"|"Agatha Christie"
06:00|"six o’clock in the morning"|"“Five or six o’clock in the morning, I think. No warning or anything. Just down she came. In spite of being so early we got a crowd almost at once, pushing through the railing over there. You know what people are.”"|"Third Girl"|"Agatha Christie"
12:00|midday|"“It would certainly seem so,” said Poirot. “And I have a letter here which came by the midday post from her father, urging me to come and see him and tell him what progress I have made.”"|"Third Girl"|"Agatha Christie"
05:00|"5 a.m."|"It was all there—waiting for him! He would have to work it all out. But he knew now. All the bits were there, disconnected bits and pieces, all fitting in. A wig, a picture, 5 a.m., women and their hairdos, the Peacock Boy—all leading to the phrase with which it had begun:"|"Third Girl"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 10:30"|"Half past ten"|"“When did she go?”
“This morning. Half past ten.”
“Exactly. After she read the papers. That is good enough to start on. Which paper did she usually read?”"|"Third Girl"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 04:30"|4:30|"A lady who wanted to dispose of her fur coat…Passengers wanted for a car trip abroad…Lovely period house for sale…Paying guests…Backward children…Homemade chocolates…“Julia. Shall never forget. Always yours.” That was more the kind of thing. He considered it, but passed on. Louis XVth furniture…Middle-aged lady to help run a hotel…“In desperate trouble. Must see you. Come to flat 4:30 without fail. Our code Goliath.”"|"Third Girl"|"Agatha Christie"
