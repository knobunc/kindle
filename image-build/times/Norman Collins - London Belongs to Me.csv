         a bit. The Drawing Office was a large bleak room with charts and diagrams on the walls, and it did not encourage conviviality.
         There were no Christmas cards there, not even a new calendar. The green‐shaded lights low down over the tables cast a dim
         aqueous glow as though the meeting were taking place at the bottom of an aquarium. The only concession to the season was a

         something hauntingly uncertain about the exact moment of Uncle Henry’s arrivals. He was a man of many engagements and much
         information. A greengrocer by trade – he had a shop with two assistants in Stoke Newington – he also cultivated outside interests.
         The chief of these at the moment was treasurership of the South London Parliament and Debating Society. And it was a long

         openly contemptuous of the Underground, he came and went on his green bicycle as his impetuous heart directed. It was nothing for Henry Knockell to turn up in his Norfolk jacket and cycling

         he didn’t get off till midnight and he felt he needed a little relaxation just to keep going. But somehow delight was absent.
         Everything was flat, and the fun fair didn’t seem funny. He went aimlessly from machine to machine in search of happiness,
         and couldn’t find it. Even the pin‐tables had lost their magic. The little steel balls careered madly about, striking first
         one kind of obstacle and then another, lighting things up on their zigzags, flashing up the score in thousands and tens of
         thousands – and he was just too bored to count. Then he tried the Electric Crane which looked as though it could scoop up
         watches and fountain pens and cigarette cases as often as you cared to put a penny into it. He’d wasted ninepence and gone
         back for more change before he decided that happiness didn’t lurk in the Electric Crane either. So, finally, still searching
         as hard as ever for something to make him forget himself – he sauntered over to the Peep‐Shows. He knew them all by heart
         of course. They were an old selection, and the Peep‐Show in England is an art form that hasn’t renewed itself with the times.
         But he put his pennies in dutifully and saw the old faded sets of postcards flicker past again – the Honeymoon, Milady’s Toilet,
         What the Butler Saw, The Artist’s Model and Greek Statues. They didn’t, however, rouse him to‐night. They simply left him

         seemed a little dazed by remembering how utterly marvellous everything had been. She would go on talking about it. First of
         all she’d gone to a simply heavenly film with a young doctor friend who was only twenty‐six but was doing absolutely marvellously,
         and then they’d gone on somewhere to dance and the doctor had danced divinely. On Sunday morning she’d had to go home, which
         was a frightful bore anyhow; but they were really awfully sweet and darlings really, even though they did make her want to
         scream sometimes. Then another friend – in the Navy this time – had suddenly turned up from nowhere and had rushed her down to the
         West End where everything had been simply too marvellous and divine; they had fed marvellously in an adorable little restaurant
         in Soho and then, most marvellous of all, this rugged seaman had turned out to be as divine a dancer as the doctor. They had
         finished up round about 1.30 in the morning, this morning it was, at a simply wonderful coffee stall near Baker Street Station where the most incredible people had gathered.

         to his food. He thought of the Marquis of Granby up the street. But he dismissed the idea because they never served enough
         pastry with the steak‐and‐kidney pie – and he had already decided in his mind on steak‐and‐kidney. Then he thought of the
         Pillars of Hercules. But somehow nothing at the Pillars of Hercules was ever really hot. The Irish stew there came out with
         small eyes of fat like ice floes floating on it. A bit further afield, there was the Rose and Crown which had everything – huge chunks of pastry, soup so hot that men like Mr Puddy who wore glasses had to keep on
         taking them off and wiping them, and boiled syrup roll that swam lazily in a treacle sea. But the trouble there was the waitresses.
         They were overworked and this meant that he would be kept waiting. Also, the waitresses had their regulars and reserved the
         best portions for them. Mr Puddy had to be in a specially good mood not to mind that happening. And somehow to‐day he felt

         though he wanted to say something. As though he wanted to join them. But not saying anything. Not attempting to lift the latch

         his mind was too full to concentrate on his food. Too full to concentrate on anything. Sitting with the untasted wheat‐flakes
         in front of him, he found himself drifting off into one of those dangerous psychic states of his. It seemed that Mrs Vizzard

         lips were moving, yet not hear a syllable that she said. He roused himself finally with a groan which startled the waitress,

         brutal version of impending war in the contemporaneous Coming Up for Air. Here there is no stoical resignation to man’s inalterable, impending doom but simply an examination of how a group of mostly working‐class Londoners deal with their everyday existence, the ephemeral and the
