"ap ~ 01:59"|"about 1 to 2"|"Subject 3151929: Week after period demonstrated climax: legs crossed—her 2 fingers making about inch stroke about 1 to 2 a second—not hard pressure but sway of pelvis and contraction of levator and thigh adduction—rhythmically once in 2 sec or less. Second orgasm, no levator throb—most of desire and feeling outside but “I like inside too.”It might be tempting to dismiss Dickinson as an iconoclastic pervert, but nothing could be further from the truth. He simply believed that lame sex destroyed more marriages than did anything else, and that “considering the inveterate marriage habit of the race,” something ought to be done. It was Dickinson who ushered the clitoris into the spotlight. He was an early proponent of the more clitoris-friendly woman-on-top position. Through measurements and interviews he debunked some persistent clitoral myths. For instance, that the bigger ones are more sensitive, and that good girls don’t play with them. (Masturbation, he wrote, was “a normal sex experience.”)"|Bonk|"Mary Roach"
"ap 01:00"|one|"…Kinsey was virtually on top of the action, his head only inches removed from the couple’s genitals…. Above the groans and moans, Kinsey could be heard chattering away, pointing out various signs of sexual arousal as the couple progressed through the different stages of intercourse. In [his colleague] Beach’s estimation, no observer had a keener eye for detail. Nothing escaped Kinsey’s notice—not the subtle changes in the breast’s skin tone that accompanied tumescence during arousal, not the involuntary twitch of the muscles in the anus upon orgasm—Kinsey saw everything. At one level, it was all very analytic and detached. As Beach looked closer, however, he was certain he detected a gleam of desire in Kinsey’s eyes, a look that grew more intense as the action built to a climax.I wanted to see the purported gleam and decide for myself. I wanted to watch one of the films. Did Kinsey look like a scientist doing research, or did he look like a Peeping Tom? Was he taking measurements? Jotting down notes? Perhaps I could see those too. I contacted Shawn Wilson, the likable gatekeeper for the Kinsey Institute’s library and special collections. He replied that if—as Wardell Pomeroy states in his book—notes were taken and data compiled from the sessions in the attic, the institute did not have them. The films themselves, he said, were “not available”—meaning, I think, that they still exist but very few people, and certainly not Mary Roach, get to watch them. In his email, Wilson referred to the footage as “the Kinsey stag film,” a fitting enough description, but not one that contributed greatly to its status as scientific documentation."|Bonk|"Mary Roach"
19:54|1954|"it was 1954 when William Masters embarked on his own investigation of sexual physiology. Kinsey was under fire from conservatives. The Rockefeller Foundation, partly because of its funding of Kinsey’s work, was the subject of a congressional investigation. (As a result, the foundation pulled Kinsey’s funding. He died less than two years later.)"|Bonk|"Mary Roach"

Their names are Martin, Morten, and Thomas, and they have twenty sows to inseminate before noon. An informal competition exists among the inseminators of Øeslevgaard Farm, I am told—not to inseminate more sows than anyone else, but to inseminate them better. To produce the most piglets."|Bonk|"Mary Roach"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"Aside from the intriguing link between street acrobatics and erectile function, what has mankind gained from Jupp and Ida? Mankind has gained a tremendous fudge factor should mankind wish to boast about the length of its penis. Before Schultz’s MRIs, few had realized how much of the penis lies hidden below the surface of the skin. The “root” is nearly two thirds again the length of the “pendulous part.” So if your erection is, say, six inches long, go ahead and say it’s ten. I’ll back you up."|Bonk|"Mary Roach"

"ap 23:53"|"seven of twelve"|"A penis amputation is not a cure for incontinence but it was, for one perplexed seventy-year-old man, a cure for his impotence. The newly invigorated member was a phantom. Phantom limbs are a common consequence of arm and leg amputations; owing to peculiarities of the nervous system, the sensations that existed in the limb beforehand often persist after the surgery. Occasionally, this happens with mastectomies—the phantom breast even seeming to “swell” at certain times of the month—and with penectomies (seven of twelve cases, according to one survey). Phantom expert V. S. Ramachandran, of the Brain and Perceptual Process Laboratory at the University of California, San Diego, once had a patient with a phantom appendix. So painful was it that he had trouble believing his surgeon had removed the real one."|Bonk|"Mary Roach"
"ap 00:30"|"half of one"|"The Female Sexual Psychophysiology Lab is part of the psychology department at the University of Texas at Austin. Its goal is simple but complicated: to untangle the complex, quixotic interplay of body and mind as they pertain to female sexuality. You have no idea what a perplexing mess is female arousal. When a woman is turned on by something or someone, her brain sends a signal to open up more of the capillaries in her womanly recesses. This ups the amount of blood in her vaginal walls, and some of the clear portion of it seeps through the capillaries and coats the vagina. Hello, lubrication. This much we know. But just because a woman is a little moist, that doesn’t mean she’s going to report feeling aroused. Unlike a man. If a man has an erection, or even half of one, as part of a sex study, he will almost always report that he’s aroused. Partly, this is because a boner is easier for its owner to detect than is a damp vestibule. It may also have to do with men’s greater skill at detecting subtle physical changes. A 1992 study showed that men were more accurate than women at picking up changes in their heart rate and blood pressure."|Bonk|"Mary Roach"
