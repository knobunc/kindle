"ap > 08:00"|"after eight o’clock"|"Annemarie jumped out of bed, and Kirsti grunted in her sleep. Peter! She hadn’t seen him in a long time. There was something frightening about his being here at night. Copenhagen had a curfew, and no citizens were allowed out after eight o’clock. It was very dangerous, she knew, for Peter to visit at this time. But she was delighted that he was here. Though his visits were always hurried—they almost seemed secret, somehow, in a way she couldn’t quite put her finger on—still, it was a treat to see Peter. It brought back memories of happier times. And her parents loved Peter, too. They said he was like a son."|"Number the Stars"|"Lois Lowry"

"ap < 05:00"|"Almost five"|"“I will pack some things,” Mama said. “What time is it?”
Papa looked at his watch. “Almost five,” he said.

02:30|"two-thirty in the morning"|"The clock in the hall struck once; it was two-thirty in the morning. Her mother would be home in an hour, Annemarie decided. She rocked gently back and forth in the old chair. Mama would be home by three-thirty."|"Number the Stars"|"Lois Lowry"

"ap > 04:00"|"past four o’clock"|"She stood stiffly, stretching her legs, and went to the hall to look at the old clock. It was past four o’clock."|"Number the Stars"|"Lois Lowry"
"ap 04:30"|four-thirty|"Mama nodded. “I knew you would be. I thought of you, worrying, as I dragged myself along. But here I am—safe with you, now. Everything is fine. What time is it?”
“It must be four-thirty, or close to it.”
“They will sail soon.” Mama turned her head and gazed across the meadow to the sea and the vast sky above it. There were no stars now, only the gray, pale sky, with pinkness at its border. “Soon they will be safe, too.”"|"Number the Stars"|"Lois Lowry"
