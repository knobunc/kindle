16:00|"four in the afternoon"|"My school was in the nearest village, two miles away. We didn’t have a car of our own. We couldn’t afford one. But the walk took only half an hour and I didn’t mind that in the least. My father came with me. He insisted on coming. And when school ended at four in the afternoon, he was always there waiting to walk me home."|"Danny the Champion of the World"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap ~ 06:00"|"Around six o’clock"|"It all started on a Saturday evening. It was the first Saturday of September. Around six o’clock my father and I had supper together in the caravan as usual. Then I went to bed. My father told me a fine story and kissed me good-night. I fell asleep."|"Danny the Champion of the World"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 11:10"|"ten past eleven"|"I got out of my bunk and found a box of matches by the sink. I struck one and held it up to the funny old clock that hung on the wall above the kettle. It said ten past eleven."|"Danny the Champion of the World"|"Roald Dahl"
00:00|midnight|"‘Fine, thank you.’
‘If you’re hungry we could have a midnight feast?’ he said.
"|"Danny the Champion of the World"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"‘I want to be away by six o’clock,’ my father said. ‘Then I will get to the wood exactly at twilight.’"|"Danny the Champion of the World"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"‘You wouldn’t catch anything if you did that,’ he said. ‘When night comes on, all the pheasants fly up into the trees to roost. Pheasants are just like other birds. They never sleep on the ground. Twilight’, my father added, ‘begins about seven-thirty this week. And as it’s at least an hour and a half’s walk to the wood, I must not leave here later than six o’clock.’"|"Danny the Champion of the World"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap ~ 10:00"|"About ten o’clock"|"‘About ten o’clock,’ he said. ‘Ten-thirty at the latest. I promise I’ll be back by ten-thirty. You’re quite sure you don’t mind being left alone?’"|"Danny the Champion of the World"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 10:30"|Ten-thirty|"‘About ten o’clock,’ he said. ‘Ten-thirty at the latest. I promise I’ll be back by ten-thirty. You’re quite sure you don’t mind being left alone?’"|"Danny the Champion of the World"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"As the day wore on, I could see my father getting more and more impatient and excited. By five o’clock we had finished work on the Baby Austin and together we ran her up and down the road to test her out."|"Danny the Champion of the World"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 05:30"|five-thirty|"At five-thirty we had an early supper of sausages and bacon, but my father hardly ate anything at all."|"Danny the Champion of the World"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"At six o’clock precisely he kissed me goodbye and said, ‘Promise not to wait up for me, Danny. Put yourself to bed at eight and go to sleep. Right?’"|"Danny the Champion of the World"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"At six o’clock precisely he kissed me goodbye and said, ‘Promise not to wait up for me, Danny. Put yourself to bed at eight and go to sleep. Right?’"|"Danny the Champion of the World"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 07:30"|"half-past seven"|"The clock said half-past seven. This was the twilight time. He would be there now. I pictured him in his old navy-blue sweater and peaked cap walking soft-footed up the track towards the wood. He told me he wore the sweater because navy-blue hardly showed up at all in the dark. Black was even better, he said. But he didn’t have a black one and navy-blue was next best. The peaked cap was important too, he explained, because the peak cast a shadow over one’s face. Just about now he would be wriggling through the hedge and entering the wood. Inside the wood I could see him treading carefully over the leafy ground, stopping, listening, going on again, and all the time searching and searching for the keeper who would somewhere be standing still as a post beside a big tree with a gun under his arm. Keepers hardly move at all when they are in a wood watching for poachers, he had told me. They stand dead still right up against the trunk of a tree and it’s not easy to spot a motionless man in that position at twilight when the shadows are as dark as a wolf’s mouth."|"Danny the Champion of the World"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 02:10"|"ten minutes past two"|"When I opened my eyes again, the oil-lamp was still glowing and the clock on the wall said ten minutes past two."|"Danny the Champion of the World"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 02:10"|"ten minutes past two"|"When I opened my eyes again, the oil-lamp was still glowing and the clock on the wall said ten minutes past two.
Ten minutes past two!
I jumped out of my bunk and looked into the bunk above mine. It was empty."|"Danny the Champion of the World"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 10:30"|ten-thirty|"He had promised he would be home by ten-thirty at the latest, and he never broke promises."|"Danny the Champion of the World"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 10:30"|ten-thirty|"Yes, but last week was a different thing altogether. He had made no promises to me last week. This time he had said, ‘I promise I’ll be back by ten-thirty.’ Those were his exact words. And he never, absolutely never, broke a promise."|"Danny the Champion of the World"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 06:00"|six|"I looked again at the clock. He had left the caravan at six, which meant he had been gone over eight hours!"|"Danny the Champion of the World"|"Roald Dahl"
15:00|fifteen|"What speed were we going? I glanced at the speedometer. It was lit up very faintly, but I was able to read it. It said fifteen miles an hour. Good. That was quite fast enough. I would stay in second gear. I started figuring out how long it would take me to do six miles travelling at fifteen miles an hour."|"Danny the Champion of the World"|"Roald Dahl"
02:30|"half-past two in the morning"|"I didn’t dare look round to see if they were stopping and coming back after me. I was certain they would stop. Any policeman in the world would stop if he suddenly passed a small boy in a tiny car chugging along a lonely road at half-past two in the morning. My only thought was to get away, to escape, to vanish, though heaven knows how I was going to do that. I pressed my foot harder still on the accelerator. Then all at once I saw in my own dim headlamps the tiny gap in the hedge on my left-hand side. There wasn’t time to brake or slow down, so I just yanked the wheel hard over and prayed. The little car swerved violently off the road, leaped through the gap, hit the rising ground, bounced high in the air, then skidded round sideways behind the hedge and stopped."|"Danny the Champion of the World"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 02:50"|"ten to three"|"‘What time is it?’ he said. ‘Shine the light down so I can see.’ I did as he asked. ‘It’s ten to three,’ he said. ‘I must be out of here before sunrise.’"|"Danny the Champion of the World"|"Roald Dahl"
"< 04:00"|"nearly four o’clock in the morning"|"We sat on the grassy bank under the hedge to get a breather. His watch said it was nearly four o’clock in the morning. The sun would not be up for another two hours, so we had plenty of time."|"Danny the Champion of the World"|"Roald Dahl"
04:30|"four-thirty in the morning"|"‘No. I don’t like waking doctors up at four-thirty in the morning. We’ll call him at seven.’"|"Danny the Champion of the World"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"The next morning, a Monday, my father was up at six o’clock. ‘I feel great,’ he said. He started hobbling round the caravan to test his leg. ‘It hardly hurts at all!’ he cried. ‘I can walk you to school!’"|"Danny the Champion of the World"|"Roald Dahl"
08:05|"five minutes past eight in the morning"|"As soon as the doctor had driven away from the filling-station, I went into the office and got out the sign that said SORRY CLOSED. I hung it on one of the pumps. Then I headed straight for the caravan. I was too tired to undress. I didn’t even take off my dirty old sneakers. I just flopped down on the bunk and went to sleep. The time was five minutes past eight in the morning."|"Danny the Champion of the World"|"Roald Dahl"
18:30|"six-thirty in the evening"|"More than ten hours later, at six-thirty in the evening, I was woken up by the ambulance men bringing my father back from the hospital. They carried him into the caravan and laid him on the lower bunk."|"Danny the Champion of the World"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap ~ 09:00"|"about nine o’clock"|"‘You know what makes me so hopping mad,’ he said to me all of a sudden. ‘I get up in the mornings feeling pretty good. Then about nine o’clock every single day of the week, that huge silver Rolls-Royce comes swishing past the filling-station and I see the great big bloated face of Mr Victor Hazell behind the wheel. I always see it. I can’t help it. And as he passes by, he always turns his head in my direction and looks at me. But it’s the way he looks at me that is so infuriating. There is a sneer under his nose and a smug little smirk around his mouth and although I only see him for three seconds, it makes me madder than mackerel. What’s more, I stay mad for the rest of the day’"|"Danny the Champion of the World"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"At eight o’clock we started walking down the road towards my school in the pale autumn sunshine, munching our apples as we strode along."|"Danny the Champion of the World"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 08:30"|eight-thirty|"‘Will Cooper’s be open so early?’
‘Yes,’ he said. ‘They open at eight-thirty’
I really loved those morning walks to school with my father. We talked practically the whole time. Mostly it was he who talked and I who listened, and just about everything he said was fascinating. He was a true countryman. The fields, the streams, the woods and all the creatures who lived in these places were a part of his life. Although he was a mechanic by trade and a very fine one, I believe he could have become a great naturalist if only he had had a good schooling."|"Danny the Champion of the World"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"When my father woke me at six o’clock next morning, I knew at once that this was the day of days. It was the day I longed for and the day I dreaded. It was also the day of butterflies in the stomach except that they were worse than butterflies. They were snakes. I had snakes in the stomach the moment I opened my eyes on that Friday morning."|"Danny the Champion of the World"|"Roald Dahl"
00:00|midnight|"‘What’s the matter, Dad?’
‘Nothing,’ he said. ‘Shall we have a midnight feast?’
‘Yes, let’s do that.’"|"Danny the Champion of the World"|"Roald Dahl"
12:00|midday|"By midday we had prepared one hundred and thirty-six raisins. ‘We’re in good shape,’ my father said. ‘Let’s break for lunch.’"|"Danny the Champion of the World"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"‘Don’t worry,’ he said. ‘The same thing happened to me the first time I went out. I was about your age then, maybe a little older, and in those days we always had a hot tea in the kitchen at five o’clock. I can remember exactly what was on the table that evening. It was my favourite thing of all, toad-in-the-hole, and my mum could make toad-in-the-hole like nobody else in the world. She did it in an enormous pan with the Yorkshire pudding very brown and crisp on top and raised up in huge bubbly mountains. In between the mountains you could see the sausages half-buried in the batter. Fantastic it was. But on that day my stomach was so jumpy I couldn’t eat one mouthful. I expect yours feels like that now.’"|"Danny the Champion of the World"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap ~ 07:30"|"about seven-thirty"|"‘Right now it’s about seven-thirty,’ he said. ‘So we must arrive at seven-fifteen exactly. It’s an hour and a half’s walk to the wood so we must leave here at a quarter to six.’"|"Danny the Champion of the World"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 07:15"|seven-fifteen|"‘Right now it’s about seven-thirty,’ he said. ‘So we must arrive at seven-fifteen exactly. It’s an hour and a half’s walk to the wood so we must leave here at a quarter to six.’"|"Danny the Champion of the World"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 05:45"|"quarter to six"|"‘Right now it’s about seven-thirty,’ he said. ‘So we must arrive at seven-fifteen exactly. It’s an hour and a half’s walk to the wood so we must leave here at a quarter to six.’"|"Danny the Champion of the World"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 05:30"|"half-past five"|"After that, we messed round in the workshop until half-past five. Then my father said, ‘That’s it! It’s time to get ready! We leave in fifteen minutes!’"|"Danny the Champion of the World"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 08:30"|eight-thirty|"At eight-thirty the next morning my father went into the workshop and dialled Doc Spencer’s number on the telephone."|"Danny the Champion of the World"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"At nine o’clock, Doc Spencer arrived in his car. My father went over to him and the two of them held a whispered conversation beside the pumps. Suddenly the tiny doctor clapped his hands together and sprang up high in the air, hooting with laughter."|"Danny the Champion of the World"|"Roald Dahl"
