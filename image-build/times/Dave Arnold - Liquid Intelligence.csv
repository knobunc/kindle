18:00|"6 p.m."|"The end result of all the experimentation isn’t super-rosy, however, because even the 500-watters always break eventually; they just last a lot longer. Occasionally the insulation inside the heater cracks and fails from the incessant thermal cycling, which leads to arcs and sparks. This is rare in a 500-watt poker, and not dangerous like an arcing scenario with a 1500-watt poker, but it is startling. The most common mode of failure is the fadeaway. Over time the resistance wire inside the heater oxidizes. As it oxidizes the resistance goes up, the amount of power it produces goes down, and the drinks no longer ignite. The poker just fades away. A poker that lives in a busy bar and is turned on seven days a week from 6 p.m. to 1 or 2 a.m. has a lifetime of about a month before it fades. At home they would last a lot longer, but I’ll never sell them. Imagine the insurance. I’m not going to tell you how to make them, either, because I can’t recommend that you do."|"Liquid Intelligence"|"Dave Arnold"

"ap 01:59"|"one of two"|"BALL-LOCK CONNECTOR: A length of reinforced hose will connect your regulator to a special fitting called a ball-lock gas connector. Ball-lock connectors are special doodads that were designed in the 1950s to pressurize and dispense from 5-gallon soda kegs (one of two such systems; the other is known as pin-lock). Soda suppliers would ship the soda, known as premix soda, to bars and restaurants in those kegs. The competing system, also designed in the 1950s, is called bag-in-box. With a bag-in-box system, syrup is added to carbonated water at the last minute, just before the drink enters the glass. The two systems existed side-by-side for a while, but bag-in-box eventually won out and rendered soda kegs and their connectors obsolete. In the 1990s and early years of this century, while bag-in-box was consolidating its hegemony over the fountain soda world, the market was flooded with surplus premix soda kegs and connectors. Home brewers snatched them up. Buying surplus, home brewers (yep, I was one) could brew, keg, and tap their beers in convenient 5-gallon quantities, almost for free. Those were good times. Today the surplus is gone, but the home brewer’s love is not, and the ball-lock soda fittings and kegs live on, at a higher but still reasonable price."|"Liquid Intelligence"|"Dave Arnold"
