14:59|"2:59 P.M."|"My clothes dried quickly in the sunlight. The warm breeze felt good on my face. Sailboats traced their way across the harbor while airplanes cut across the blue sky, heading out from Logan Airport to New York or California or Europe. The whole city of Boston seemed charged with impatient energy, like a classroom at 2:59 P.M., waiting for the dismissal bell, everybody ready to get out of town for the summer and enjoy the good weather."|"The Ship of the Dead"|"Rick Riordan"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"Behind us, Halfborn yelled, “Valkyrie at ten o’clock!” He pointed to the Charlestown waterfront. About a quarter mile ahead, I could just make out two figures standing on the dock—one with a green hijab, the other with green hair."|"The Ship of the Dead"|"Rick Riordan"
"~ 16:30"|"evening prayer"|"Finally, around sunset, I couldn’t stand it any longer. I stumbled aft to where I’d set up my sleeping bag. I lay down, enjoying the sound of Samirah doing her evening prayer on the foredeck, the singsong poetry soft and relaxing."|"The Ship of the Dead"|"Rick Riordan"
12:00|noon|"We stopped once for lunch—consisting only of some trail mix Mallory happened to have, along with a few wild blackberries we picked, and water from a stream so cold it made my teeth hurt. Sam didn’t join us, of course. She just did her noon prayers on a carpet of fluffy green grass."|"The Ship of the Dead"|"Rick Riordan"
"~ 16:30"|"evening prayer"|"The temperature dropped as we sailed into the sunset. Amidships, Sam did her evening prayer. Hearthstone and Blitzen sat at the prow, gazing in quiet awe at the fjord walls. Mallory went below to check on T.J. and cook up some dinner."|"The Ship of the Dead"|"Rick Riordan"
"< 12:00"|"before midday"|"Skadi smiled. “Fear not, Blitzen, son of Freya. My skis will look good on you. You will have to reach the ship before midday tomorrow. By then, the ice blocking the bay will be sufficiently melted for Loki to sail into open waters. If that happens, nothing will be able to stop Ragnarok.”"|"The Ship of the Dead"|"Rick Riordan"
04:00|"four in the morning"|"In the great hall, I found Sam at prayer. Jack hummed against my collarbone, informing me in a sleepy, irritated tone that it was four in the morning, Niflheim Standard Time."|"The Ship of the Dead"|"Rick Riordan"
