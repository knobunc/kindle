Rudge, who worked at the post office alongside Martin, was still at home. She
lived in the centre of town and could walk to work, and in any case she didn’t
have the responsibility of opening up, which brought Martin in on the dot of
half past eight. Hairgrip between clenched teeth, she was standing before the
kitchen mirror, concentrating on herself and a vital quiz question on the Dick
Arthur Breakfast Show."|"Hemingway's Chair"|"Michael Palin"

next day was a Saturday and the post office closed at one o’clock. Martin
needed not to feel sorry for himself, and after locking up he opted out of the
usual lunchtime drink and cycled six miles inland to Arnold Julian’s
second-hand bookshop in the town of Atcham. Since the announcement he had
endured a hell of sympathy, all of it well intentioned, and most of it doing
little more than smooth the rough edges of his resentment. Protestations of
eternal loyalty had flowed across the post office counter, whilst all that had
flowed from area headquarters was a series of faxed instructions advising him
of the arrangements for Mr Marshall’s arrival on October the first. There was
really nothing he could do other than accept the tide of commiseration and
prepare for what he was quite certain would be the worst. It was like winning
the pools on the day of your execution."|"Hemingway's Chair"|"Michael Palin"

hands hovered over the dark, round-headed keys, but his mind was paralysed.
Outside he heard the soft croaking call of brent-geese heading for the estuary.
He glanced at his watch. Four forty-five. At any moment his mother would call
up and tell him tea was ready. As far as his mother was concerned, the day was
made up of a series of closely observed times. Breakfast time, lunchtime,
teatime, time for a biscuit, time for a bath, time for bed. Perhaps it came
from having been a teacher. Or having been married to a postman."|"Hemingway's Chair"|"Michael Palin"

the first came, as it had to, and the staff of Theston
post office — Martin, Elaine, Arthur Gillis, John Parr and Shirley Barker the
part-time helper — all assembled in the cavernous, empty room that had been a
postal sorting office until the Royal Mail separated from Counter Services. Now
it was a staff room. There was a kitchen and a lavatory, and a table to eat
lunch from. It was here they were to meet their new Manager. It was half past
eight on a Monday morning. The office was due to open at nine."|"Hemingway's Chair"|"Michael Palin"

next evening Martin was still working at half past six. Tuesday was balance day
when post offices across the country checked their stock and their tills at
close of business. There was only one personal computer at Theston and Martin
and Elaine were the only two qualified to work it. Martin was on his own
tonight, apart from Marshall who hovered, checking figures, examining returns
and asking a lot of questions. At the end, when the last figures had been fed
through, and everything tallied, Martin felt relieved. It hadn’t been easy
having his new boss there and he’d been all fingers and thumbs on the keyboard.
Now suddenly he felt the younger man’s hand rest lightly on his shoulder. There
was a hint of something like lemon on his skin."|"Hemingway's Chair"|"Michael Palin"

something had changed. The lazy coffee breaks and gossipy lunch hours of

been posted on the staff-room wall with twenty-four-hour timings attached. But

Outside
the door Martin shifted uneasily from foot to foot. He didn’t like the new
estates. They looked as though they had been assembled from kits, freshly
unpacked and set down, arbitrarily, on what were once attractive fields. The
little roads bore bogus off-the-shelf names like Lakeside Crescent and
Farmview, though the only view the houses had was of other houses. He didn’t
like what he was doing here either. He’d had a pint at the King’s Head after
work and a large whisky back at home but his mouth was still dry and his
stomach still tight. For the umpteenth time he checked that the envelope was in
the right pocket. Not in his anorak which he might hang up, but in his old
brown corduroy jacket, and not in the side, but the inside pocket. There must be
no prior hint that he had it. When the time came to deliver it, it must be
swift and sweet."|"Hemingway's Chair"|"Michael Palin"

clothes, which were exactly the same but newer. Van Heusen cotton shirt,
Viyella sweater, creaseproof cotton and polyester trousers. When he’d finished

had rarely been so happy to see his lunch hour. Not that it was announced any
longer by the old wall clock, but that was a minor quibble. Thirteen hundred on
the dot-matrix indicator or one o’clock on his watch, it marked a respite from
the nightmare. He sat for a moment in the narrow, airless back room which had
been provided for staff breaks. There were two spindly metal and plastic chairs
on either side of the door and a shelf beside a wash-basin on which was a
kettle, a box of tea bags, a jar of coffee and a stack of polystyrene cups. On
one of the chairs Shirley Barker sat peeling a piece of cing film from around
her lunch. Martin took his sandwiches from his anorak pocket and looked at them
without interest. He had no appetite."|"Hemingway's Chair"|"Michael Palin"

one of the first warm days of March, when the skies were blue and innocent as June, Martin Sproale could be seen cycling
through Jubilee Park and down the gentle hill that led away from the centre of
town down to the old merchants’ houses on Mulberry Green. He stopped outside
the most handsome of them. It was half past nine on a Monday morning and
Martin, fired with enthusiasm for his new role as urban guerrilla, had decided
to take a week of his annual holiday. Leaving his bicycle leaning by the hedge
he crunched his way across the gravel to a columned and porticoed front door.
He pressed a well-polished enamel doorbell on the bit where it said, helpfully,
‘Press’. He cast a quick look in the direction he’d come from and was pleased
to see his arrival appeared to have gone unnoticed."|"Hemingway's Chair"|"Michael Palin"

Reverend Barry Burrell liked to be called Barry. He was good-looking in an
unforced way and was much disliked in Theston. His predecessor, Dr Wyngarde,
had behaved in an impeccably vicarish way, speaking the old Prayer Book
clearly, visiting the sick ineffectually and never preaching a sermon longer
than twelve minutes. Barry Burrell’s avowed aim was to be a hands-on rector. To
this end he had paid special attention to taking the church into the community.
He had held services in pubs and old folks’ homes, blessed stock cars and once
held midnight mass in the canteen of Theston Rubber Ltd. In return for these
favours he hoped the community would come in to the church. Traffic wardens
were encouraged to read the lesson, welders to bring their equipment to harvest
festival and one of the local bus companies to sponsor the Christmas crib. He
had a firm handshake and a close friend called Tessa."|"Hemingway's Chair"|"Michael Palin"

out, and on the low table between them was a pair of binoculars. She picked
them up and, adjusting the focus, scanned the harbour and its approach roads.
Sure enough, there on the steeper of the two hills that led into the town, was
