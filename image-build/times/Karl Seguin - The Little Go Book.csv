00:00|0|"C-Like Syntax
Saying that a language has a C-like syntax means that if you're used to any other C-like languages such as C, C++, Java, JavaScript and C#, then you're going to find Go familiar -- superficially, at least. For example, it means && is used as a boolean AND, == is used to compare equality, { and } start and end a scope, and array indexes start at 0."|"The Little Go Book"|"Karl Seguin"
