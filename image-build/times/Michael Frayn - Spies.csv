Mr Hucknall. 3 muten chops. Not to much fat. By noon.’ We flee into the playroom as she comes upstairs … halt our investigations and think about something else while she’s in the lavatory … emerge and follow her downstairs to the kitchen … out into the garden to watch her from behind the shed as she takes the familiar steaming, sour-smelling enamel bowl into the chicken run … She does far more different things in the course of the morning, now we’re taking note of them, than I’d ever realised, with not a single pause to rest or write letters. It’s easy to miss how active she is because she does it all in such a smooth, unhurried way – because she does it all so … inconspicuously."|Spies|"Michael Frayn"

"< 12:00"|"just before noon"|"Then again, is the ‘Mr Hucknall’ Keith’s mother spoke to on the phone really Mr Hucknall, the familiar bloodstained comedian of the butcher’s shop? And even if he is, his connection with a known spy now makes us begin to wonder about him. I think of the humorously loud way he sings as he hurls the cuts of meat on to the scale when he’s still several feet away from it. ‘If you were the only girl in the world …’ Then tosses the shining brass weights from hand to hand as if they were juggler’s clubs. ‘And I was the only boy …’ Then shouts to the cash desk: ‘Take two and fourpence off this good lady, Mrs Hucknall. And the next, please …’ Like Keith’s mother he’s putting on a performance; he’s trying to conceal his true nature. Are ‘mutton chops’ really mutton chops, for that matter? In any case, when the boy arrives on his heavy delivery bicycle just before noon, with the plate saying ‘F. Hucknall, Family Butcher’ under the crossbar, how do we know that the little white parcel that he takes out of the great basket over the tiny front wheel really contains mutton chops?"|Spies|"Michael Frayn"

17:00|1700|"I’m back at my post next day, logbook open once again, and I’m just hesitating, two-colour pencil in hand, trying to remember what it was that Keith’s mother did go into at 1700, when my eye’s caught by a movement at the Haywards’ house."|Spies|"Michael Frayn"

‘Funny sort of midnight feast,’ says Barbara.
I feel in the basket again and find a little white box. On the label is a familiar printed heading: ‘W. Walworth Watkins, MPS FSMC FBOA, Dispensing Chemist and Optician.’ Underneath the heading is a handwritten inscription: ‘Master K. R. G. Hayward. M & B tablets. One to be taken with water three times a day.’"|Spies|"Michael Frayn"
