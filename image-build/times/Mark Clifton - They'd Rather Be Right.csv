03:00|"three o’clock in the morning"|"It was three o’clock in the morning when Joe checked them out of the Deluxe Hotel. He had paid for their room in advance, of course, and checking out meant no more than dropping their cubicle key at the desk. The night clerk picked it up without question, without comment, without speculation. He had seen everything in his time and had lost all curiosity about men on the short line. Guided by the grapevine command, it was easy for him not to notice that this was an old geezer, a middle-aged bum, and a young punk."|"They'd Rather Be Right"|"Mark Clifton"

"< 02:00"|"near two in the morning"|"At Mission and New Montgomery, he turned south toward skid row. Ahead of him there was the stir of unusual activity. Although it was near two in the morning, there was a crowd of people gathered in a spot of light which streamed out from the open doors of a saloon. A squad car was parked nearby, but the two policemen standing beside it made no move to interfere in the excitement. This, in itself, was strange, for only the toughest were assigned to the skid row beats, and they did enjoy using their clubs whether called for or not."|"They'd Rather Be Right"|"Mark Clifton"
03:00|"three o’clock in the morning"|"“Bah!” Dr. Fairfax tossed the police blotter across the desk. “I have never seen a more routine report: ‘…Nude young woman arrested, corner of Howard and New Montgomery—’ And you wake me up at three o’clock in the morning! The commissioner will hear of this!”"|"They'd Rather Be Right"|"Mark Clifton"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"In desperation, Joe singled out one of the loudest of the women and fed the idea into her mind that the hearing had been postponed until two o’clock."|"They'd Rather Be Right"|"Mark Clifton"
12:00|noon|"Never far away from the entrance to the hide-out, still hoping he might avoid all the eyes upon him, the rumors circulating around him, Carney saw Joe coming out again, after having spent an hour with Hoskins and Billings. Before he could catch Joe’s eye, the young man disappeared in the crowd. Now it was noon, and still Carney had heard nothing believable about Mabel."|"They'd Rather Be Right"|"Mark Clifton"
16:00|"four o’clock in the afternoon"|"It was now four o’clock in the afternoon. At eight, the next morning, the experiment was to begin. Joe stretched out on his bed and tried to compose himself for dinner with Billings and Hoskins. Their relationships with him were a little strained, since it had become obvious to them that Joe and Mabel were deeply in love. They were a couple possessed with one another to the exclusion of everyone around them, not knowing or caring who saw."|"They'd Rather Be Right"|"Mark Clifton"

"< 00:00"|"nearly midnight"|"At the next turn of the corridor, Carney paused to case the situation ahead. It was nearly midnight, and the young soldier on guard, feeling that by now the lieutenant would be safely in bed and asleep, had pulled a chair up in front of this main entrance to the operating amphitheater. He had tilted his chair back against the door and was dozing there comfortable with his rifle across his knees, dreaming of the next twenty-four-hour pass and the little brunette he had met on a Hyde Street cable car."|"They'd Rather Be Right"|"Mark Clifton"
12:00|noon|"Assured by Joe, Billings and Hoskins, at noon Steve Flynn decided there was every chance the experiment on Carney would be a success. The scene in the amphitheater, set up again under the same conditions as the experiment on Billings, flashed on the television screens in millions of homes."|"They'd Rather Be Right"|"Mark Clifton"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"By six o’clock the public began to get bored, restive. Carney’s tired old body lay on the table under the glare of television lights, and its only movement was its rhythmic breathing, and occasional enigmatic twitch of the facial muscles, the tensing and relaxing of fingers and toes. There wasn’t much to see. The entertainment value of watching an oil man sleep is limited."|"They'd Rather Be Right"|"Mark Clifton"
