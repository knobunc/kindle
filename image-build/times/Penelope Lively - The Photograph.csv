"ap > 05:00"|"after five"|"The day proceeds. Elaine spends time on a garden design, and even more time on the phone. Sonia comes in and out with queries, as do Pam and Jim. Elaine achieves a further spell in the  garden and, eventually, after five, everyone has gone and she is alone."|"The Photograph"|"Penelope Lively"
"ap > 06:00"|"Past six"|"Past six, now swinging into the circular driveway in front of the house, she sees that everyone has gone home. Only Nick’s Golf is parked there. During the day, there is quite a lineup of cars. Sonia, Elaine’s personal assistant, drives from her home ten miles away. Three times a week there is Liz, who deals with the  paperwork Sonia hasn’t time for. The red pickup belongs to Jim, who does the heavy garden work. And then there are the relays of horticultural students serving their apprenticeship in the workshop of a master, just as Elaine herself once did. The current apprentice is Pam, who is a little northern butterball, sturdy as an ox, and exuberantly sociable, which makes her good front-of-house material on Saturdays, when the garden is open to the public. Then, all hands are needed to patrol the grounds and to man the sales area, where plants are on offer, along with a judicious selection of garden implements, seeds, gift-shop paraphernalia, and books—not least a complete display of Elaine’s own publications. On those days, the paddock next to the driveway becomes the visitors’ car park. Sometimes Elaine herself is on hand in the garden to be graciously responsive to queries and compliments. Initially, she found this stimulating and good for the ego. Nowadays, she gets rather tired of being asked if this or that is an annual or a perennial, and how to prune a rose. She tends to retreat to the house and leave customer relations to the students, who enjoy it."|"The Photograph"|"Penelope Lively"
"ap ~ 10:30"|"about half past ten"|"There is this heave of the gut. The room seems to swing a little. The troop of Kaths is quite gone. It is just him and Elaine, sitting there in the conservatory, with the tractor mower going up and down outside, a bee buzzing in the blue plumbago. Everything is quite real and precise, unfortunately. It is Tuesday morning, about half past ten. He should be on his way to the health club. Instead, he is here, with a sick feeling in his stomach."|"The Photograph"|"Penelope Lively"
21:00|"nine o’clock in the evening"|"“He’s gone out to buy some socks. At nine o’clock in the evening. He forgot to bring any. He seems to think he can buy socks at an all-night petrol station.”"|"The Photograph"|"Penelope Lively"
"ap 00:45"|twelve-forty-five|"Glyn is concerned with time. He is also worried about the time: it is twelve-forty-five, he is sitting on the side of a Dorset hill, and at two o’clock he has a seminar in the university, which is well over an hour’s drive away. He should be getting a move on, instead of which he is sitting here brooding about time."|"The Photograph"|"Penelope Lively"

"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"The tour of inspection completed, Elaine is taken to the house of one of the organizers for rest and refreshment, and to pronounce judgment. She is treated with great deference and solicitude, which is rather good for the ego, and she has of course given her services free: good public relations, and you never know what may spring from such an appearance. Book sales, naturally, but possibly some interesting commission. So she remains resolutely polite and cooperative, over and beyond the call of duty, even to the extent of a supernumerary visit to the deplorable garden of the chairman, to advise on a problem with a recalcitrant pittosporum. She is allowed a period on her own with a cup of tea and her notes, for the judging process—a welcome interlude, since it is now five o’clock, she left home at seven, and still has to fight her way back through the South London traffic. She allocates the gold, silver, and bronze medals—a decision which will no doubt  further fuel the animosities in this Arcadian suburb. And then at last it is time to be extensively thanked, to smile and smile again, and to get gratefully into the car."|"The Photograph"|"Penelope Lively"

"ap > 06:00"|"after six"|"But later is on hold until after six, when the garden empties, the customers and the cars depart, Jim and his nephew pile into the red truck, Pam goes off to the pub with an admirer from the village. Alone, Elaine checks the ticket sales and is quietly pleased with visitor levels, locks up the shop, goes into the silent house. Only then does that other aspect of the afternoon come bustling in. Cousin Linda hangs around all evening, saying that again. And again."|"The Photograph"|"Penelope Lively"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"And then last night I came home and he wasn’t here. No, no—not the man—and he’s called Andy, by the way. Dad. Dad wasn’t here. I mean, usually he’s just sitting in front of the telly every evening—and incidentally he’s drinking too much. I wasn’t going to mention that, except frankly I think you should know. But he wasn’t here, and at eleven o’clock I’m like some mother with a teenager out at a disco, watching the clock and thinking accidents and stuff."|"The Photograph"|"Penelope Lively"
"ap < 01:00"|"Nearly one o’clock"|"Oh, he came back, yes. Nearly one o’clock. By which time I’m climbing the wall, about to start reaching for the police. He’s been out of London, he says. Someone he had to see. And it was a long drive and he stopped off on the way back and he got a bit lost. And then he went to bed, and of course I’m so wound up I can’t go to sleep, and now I’m wiped out today, just when I’ve got a panic on with a job that’s overdue."|"The Photograph"|"Penelope Lively"
"ap 06:00"|six|"Nowadays, Polly can see this with adult wisdom. She had doted on Kath, and so, naturally enough, wanted more of her. But she had been sufficiently mature—at six? seven?—to realize that there was a whiff of infidelity in this: you can only have one mother, you should love your mother most of all."|"The Photograph"|"Penelope Lively"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"A Thursday. Glyn left early for the university on account of a nine o’clock seminar. He had woken late, reached for the clock, said, “Bloody hell, look at the time!,” and saw Kath lying wide-eyed beside him."|"The Photograph"|"Penelope Lively"
"ap 00:00"|twelve|"At the university he gave a seminar on eighteenth-century agrarian reform to third-year students. In his office he went through the mail, wrote some letters and a student reference, took a completed paper to the departmental secretary for typing. He stopped to chat with her for a minute: Joy, a chirpy young woman who served as the hub of local activity, pestered by staff and students alike. At twelve, he lectured."|"The Photograph"|"Penelope Lively"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"At one o’clock he went over to the cafeteria for something to eat, joined a couple of colleagues, got into an argument about student expansion, discussed a proposed new course, had a beer. At one-fifty he returned to the department in haste, to collect a file on his way to the library. Joy beckoned as he passed her open door. “Your wife rang. She tried your direct line, but you weren’t there. She asked if you could call her back.”"|"The Photograph"|"Penelope Lively"

"ap 02:20"|two-twenty|"He picked up his file, and was at once waylaid by an importunate student; the student occupied his attention for ten minutes, driving other thoughts from his mind. At two-twenty he was on the steps of the library, and briefly remembered Joy’s message. The phone call to Kath would have to wait—he had only an hour and a half in which to finish off some crucial checking of references."|"The Photograph"|"Penelope Lively"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"In the event, he got back to the department five minutes late for his four o’clock appointment with a research student, already  waiting patiently outside his door. That session overran, which meant that by the time the man left, Glyn’s five o’clock seminar group was also camped in the corridor."|"The Photograph"|"Penelope Lively"

"ap 06:15"|"quarter past six"|"At a quarter past six he was through with them. There could be a further quick foray to the library before the inaugural lecture and ensuing reception, which he planned to attend. He was going to this not out of intellectual curiosity and support of a colleague, but in order to confirm his view that this appointment, which he had opposed, was a disaster. He was halfway down the stairs when he remembered that he should phone Kath."|"The Photograph"|"Penelope Lively"
"ap 09:10"|"ten past nine"|"At ten past nine he arrived home. The hall light was on—but he knew at once that there was no one here: the inert feeling of an empty house. He went into his study, dumped his briefcase. Then to the kitchen for a glass of water; the breakfast things were still on the draining board. He looked in the fridge: some cold meats, and the wherewithal for a salad. Kath would no doubt eat out."|"The Photograph"|"Penelope Lively"
"ap 11:00"|"Eleven o’clock"|"Eleven o’clock by now, and the day snapping at her heels. Sonia needed guidance, Nick wanted to talk about buying a computer, which would give him a head start with this exciting new scheme he had to tell her about, there was a tricky phone call to be made to a new and exacting client. Elaine set Sonia straight, deflected Nick, was relieved to find the client unavailable, and turned at last to her largest current project—landscaping the grounds of a refurbished country-house hotel. She spent a couple of hours on design and costings."|"The Photograph"|"Penelope Lively"
"ap 08:45"|"quarter to nine"|"It was a quarter to nine when they reached the house. Elaine put the oven on to heat the remains of a casserole. Then she went to the telephone."|"The Photograph"|"Penelope Lively"
"ap < 04:00"|"nearly four"|"Back at the house, he made himself a cup of tea and took one to Sonia. It was nearly four now, so there was no point in getting down to anything today. He settled himself in the conservatory with the tea and a book. At one point he went back to the kitchen to forage for a snack, feeling peckish. Sonia was on the phone as he passed her door; she held the receiver aside to say, “Kath, for Elaine. Do you want to—?”"|"The Photograph"|"Penelope Lively"
