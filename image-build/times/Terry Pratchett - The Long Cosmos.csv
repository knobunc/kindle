"ap > 03:00"|"after three"|"So, after three successful hunts with Sancho, here was Joshua alone, scouting a suspicious-looking area not far from a forest clump. The faintest of circles on the ground – check. The shallowest of domes, barely visible in the dry drifting dust – check. Joshua spent a tough half-hour standing there in the sun, motionless, still as a statue, holding a rock the size of his head."|"The Long Cosmos"|"Terry Pratchett"
11:30|"11.30 a.m."|"AT PRECISELY 11.30 a.m. the Reverend William Buckland lifted into midsummer air, smoothly and silently. Below its prow, the luxurious facilities of the Twenty-Twenty tourist resort diminished: a cluster of glass-walled buildings surrounded by a sprawl of twain landing pads, and further out the brilliant-green absurdity of golf courses cut into the pine forests that dominated this footprint of southern England, here in Earth West 20,000."|"The Long Cosmos"|"Terry Pratchett"
"~ 12:00"|"Around noon"|"Around noon, or so he judged it from the position of the sun in the sky, Sam approached him. Nelson came to himself slowly; he’d evidently been dozing. Sam set up a kind of umbrella of palm fronds for shade, and produced a leaf basket that turned out to contain water, the juice of some exotic fruit and the baked flesh of fish. Nelson ate gratefully, wishing only that his palate, dulled with age, was capable of appreciating the spices better."|"The Long Cosmos"|"Terry Pratchett"
05:00|"5 in the morning"|"They left the Home at West 5 in the morning. A steam-powered tram took them into a downtown district dominated by the big wooden barn of a Capitol building that now housed the US Congress, itself a copy of the destroyed original on the Datum."|"The Long Cosmos"|"Terry Pratchett"
"~ 16:00"|"about four in the afternoon"|"It was about four in the afternoon by the time they reached West 31. This was September, but the day in this world was warm and bright. The geography of this footprint of Madison was virtually the same as West 5, of course. Here was the Capitol mound, and a short walk away, no doubt, they would find the lake. But there was no sophisticated development here, just tracks cutting through the prairie towards the lake shore. It seemed odd that such a nearby world should be so empty. But even after the great exodus of people that had followed the Yellowstone eruption and the evacuation of the Datum, just the first dozen or so worlds to East or West had soaked up almost all the fleeing population. Each world, after all, was a whole Earth the size of the original, each stepwise America a continental wilderness to match the homeland."|"The Long Cosmos"|"Terry Pratchett"
01:00|"one am"|"Roberta said, ‘I for one am glad to see you, Admiral. I do remember your decisiveness over the Happy Landings affair – and your good judgement. I hope that your presence here will progress the project.’"|"The Long Cosmos"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 02:00"|two|"But if he was already something like a mile above the ground, how high could the ultimate canopy be? He knew there were limits to the size of trees, on the Datum anyhow. Sequoias, say, could grow no higher than the structure of their wood could sustain the load of the trunk above it, and no higher than it was possible for the tree’s internal structures to lift water from the ground up to the leaves. So you were looking at two, three hundred feet. Not a mile."|"The Long Cosmos"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 03:00"|three|"‘Something like that.’ Joshua looked around, at the complex roof over his head, the mushrooms and ferns the size of small trees themselves, the soft greenish glow that shone from the roof and walls and permeated everything – and the underground lake, its shore a few paces away, tranquil, glimmering, itself so vast it was almost as if it had a horizon at the place where the earthen ‘sky’ of this chamber descended to touch the ground. He tried to remember how he had first struggled to take it all in, when the trolls had brought them both down here two days ago – or was it three? Time was fluid in this unchanging light."|"The Long Cosmos"|"Terry Pratchett"
22:00|"ten p.m."|"‘We’re expecting you. You’re the only guest we have arriving this evening. Umm, would you like to come in to the warm? We’ll get you checked in, and you can make yourself comfortable. None of the rooms are air-conditioned, you understand. You have a private room, just as you booked, or what we call private anyhow. There’s TV and web connections, on a good day. Oh, and the power goes off at ten p.m. Still, we’re better off than we were. We got a Repatriation grant for redevelopment. Have you heard of that? Money to get people to come back to the Datum and rebuild, now that the weather’s easing at last, or so they say. I like President Damasio, I think. Didn’t vote for her, of course . . . Oh, here I am yapping on while you’re standing there. Can I take your pack?’"|"The Long Cosmos"|"Terry Pratchett"

"ap 01:00"|one|"Maggie nodded. ‘I’ve known her a long time. She’s evolved into a kind of unofficial ambassador of the Next to humanity. Useful in smoothing out the wrinkles between us and them.’ She grinned. ‘So much so that I sometimes wonder if she’s actually one of our super-brained overlords at all. Now, the man with her is called Marvin Lovelace. He’s a Next also; he’s from Miami West 4. Seems he worked undercover there at one time. Now he’s out in the open, and is a front man for a group who call themselves the Humble.’"|"The Long Cosmos"|"Terry Pratchett"
"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"They were heading east, Joshua saw from the position of the sun – it was about noon, the sun was to the south. The roadway they followed was a straight dirt track, evidently purposely left clear so that traffic like this could pass. But to either side of the track, the substance of the Thinker towered. They drove between diamond cliffs, their very surfaces complex textures of facets and panels. The material was mostly clear, it really was like quartz or diamond, and the captured sunlight, multiply reflected, emerged as a cool-blue glow. Joshua had crossed Earths trapped in Ice Ages; very old ice could look like this, he knew, shining like walls of blue light. Yet he glimpsed structure in there producing light of its own, winking stars like trapped constellations. Every so often they drove over structures crossing the road, like speed bumps but with more texture – fallen glassy pillars. And more prosaically the bus and its accompanying fleet had to skirt those huge heat-release pits in the ground, circular shafts lined with concrete."|"The Long Cosmos"|"Terry Pratchett"

"ap ~ 10:00"|"around ten o’clock"|"‘No,’ Joshua said. ‘There is something, on this copy of the world at least. Take a look at the horizon, at around ten o’clock. There’s a building out there – I think. I saw it before . . .’"|"The Long Cosmos"|"Terry Pratchett"
