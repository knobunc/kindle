"> 02:00"|"after two in the morning"|"‘After the Marquis had gone a letter came for the Marchioness. I could see her getting terribly agitated as she read it. She called in a trusted companion, sort of secretary she had, and told her all about it. It was from a woman in one of the mill towns within the Marquis’s lands. It told of the awful distress in the homes of idle workmen, starving children and what not. And that night the Marchioness dressed herself like a working woman and stole out of the castle grounds by the little orchard gate. I saw her from my window in the tower. With loaves of bread and foodstuffs in a basket she went miles and miles on foot to find the woman who had written the letter. When she came back it was after two in the morning. And I, who had been left on my peg outside the window all that time, was nearly frozen in the chill morning air. She brought me in and wept over me when she discovered her forgetfulness. But I quite understood—and, anyway, it was the only time she had ever neglected me."|"Doctor Dolittle and the Green Canary"|"Hugh Lofting"
">> 00:00"|"long after midnight"|"It was now quite late—long after midnight—and Pippinella’s story still seemed far from being finished. The Doctor was by this time so thoroughly absorbed and interested that it is not likely he would have thought of the time at all had not the sudden neighing of one of the horses from the nearby stables reminded him that the circus must open to the public at ten o’clock, as usual, tomorrow morning, and that he must be up to see it upon. So, in spite of the protests of Gub-Gub (who dearly loved, you will remember, any excuse for staying up late), the green canary was put in her cage and the Dolittle family circle was packed off to bed. But this was not done before a promise had been obtained from the Doctor that, without fail, the story should be continued the following evening."|"Doctor Dolittle and the Green Canary"|"Hugh Lofting"

"> 12:00"|"a little after noon"|"‘At the beginning, yes, I was,’ said Pippinella. ‘But after I had my first experience of it I was not so scared. I had supposed that if the gas ever did come while I was there that, of course, would be the end of me. But I was wrong. We had several goes of it in my mine, but no fatal accidents. I remember the first one especially. It was a little after noon and the men had only been working about half an hour since lunch. I noticed a peculiar smell. Not knowing what gas smelled like I didn’t at first suspect what it was. It got stronger and stronger. Then suddenly my head began to swim and I thought, “Gosh! this is it, sure enough!” And I started to squawk and flutter about the cage and carry on. There were men working not more than seven or eight feet from my cage. But with the noise of their own shovels and picks they did not hear me. And their heads, of course, being lower than mine, they had not yet smelled the gas, which always floats to the top of a room first."|"Doctor Dolittle and the Green Canary"|"Hugh Lofting"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"‘One morning at eleven o’clock a party of visitors came to look over the mine. You wouldn’t think if you had ever worked in a coal mine, that anybody would want to go and look at one. But folks will do all sorts of things out of curiosity. And these people came to inspect us and our mine in rather the way they’d go to a zoo."|"Doctor Dolittle and the Green Canary"|"Hugh Lofting"

12:00|noon|"‘Just how long I slept I don’t know—till an hour or so beyond noon, I imagine. I was awakened by a great racket, and, opening my eyes, found the sky dark with rain clouds. A storm was brewing. Every few seconds great tongues of lightning flashed across the face of the gloomy heavens, followed by deafening crashes of thunder."|"Doctor Dolittle and the Green Canary"|"Hugh Lofting"
12:00|midday|"‘Presently I began to notice the sun. It had been getting higher and higher all the time since I had left land, but soon it seemed to be standing still and then to descend. That meant that midday had been passed. I began to wonder if I could get much further before night fell. There was no moon. I knew, till early morning, and in the darkness flying for me would be impossible if I could not see my guiding current."|"Doctor Dolittle and the Green Canary"|"Hugh Lofting"
"~ 12:00"|"About noon"|"‘About noon some kind of craft was seen by the man in the crow’s nest—as the lookout on the mast is called. It was evidently in distress. There was a lot of signalling and a good deal of running about and looking through telescopes. Our ship’s course was changed and we headed in the direction of the stranger."|"Doctor Dolittle and the Green Canary"|"Hugh Lofting"
"ap 06:30"|"half-past six"|"‘“Well, Pip,” said he, shaking up the mattress of his bed, “here we are again! The captains’s been pretty generous. Gave me a first class cabin for nothing. Of course I can’t expect to have the services of a steward as well. So I make my own bed—where the dickens did that pillow get to? Oh, there it is, on the floor …. poor old Pip! What ages it is since we talked to one another. And then to find you aboard the ship that rescued me, living in the barber’s shop! Dear, dear, what a strange world it is, to be sure! There goes five bells. That means half-past six. It’ll soon be dinner-time. Are you hungry, Pip? Let’s see. Oh, no, you’ve got plenty of seed. And I’ll bring you a piece of apple from the dining saloon. What a decent chap that be-whiskered old fellow was, wasn’t he—paying for your cage and all like that? Heaven only knows when he’ll get his money back. I haven’t a penny in the world. But I must see that he gets it somehow.”"|"Doctor Dolittle and the Green Canary"|"Hugh Lofting"

"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"‘Aye,’ he said, after a moment. ‘I mind it wur the day I took the potatoes in off the north field. It rained about noon and I had to stop ‘cause potatoes don’t store good when they’re wet. I hadn’t even seen him go away. But his not coming with the rent told me that he’d gone off and I’d like as not ever see him again. Then, when I were starting for home I saw a man a crossin’ down from the mill to the gate. It wur him. He wur running, crazy like. “So,” I thinks to myself, “he’s come back, ‘as he?” Minding he never like to have me come to see him, I thinks to meself: “He’ll be round to my place afore long with his rent and I’ll not bother.” And I goes off home in the rain. But he never comed and I never seen him from the fields here while I was ploughing. And at the end of the week I goes up to the mill, anyhow. But he wasn’t there.’"|"Doctor Dolittle and the Green Canary"|"Hugh Lofting"
"~ 12:00"|"About noon"|"And they had not long to wait, as a matter of fact.
