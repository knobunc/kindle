"ap 08:45"|"quarter to nine"|"In the morning, at a quarter to nine, the phone rang in the laboratory. Sam Latourette took it from the technician who’d picked it up. He said, “Well, if he’s like that, don’t take any crap from him, Tom. Tell him to wait. I’ll notify Ed Hawks.” He hung up and padded in his old shoes across the floor, to where Hawks was with the crew of Navy dressers laying out the equipment Barker would wear."|"Rogue Moon"|"Algis Budrys"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"“It’s a personnel problem,” Hawks said, looking over Cobey’s left shoulder. “And I have to be back in the laboratory by one o’clock.”"|"Rogue Moon"|"Algis Budrys"
"ap 02:00"|two|"Gersten touched Hawks’ arm and nodded toward the stopwatch in his hand. It showed two hundred forty seconds’ of elapsed time since Barker had gone into the formation. Hawks nodded a nearly imperceptible reply. Gersten saw he was not moving his eyes away, and continued to hold the watch up."|"Rogue Moon"|"Algis Budrys"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"Connington gestured with the pitcher. “Upstairs. Took a shower, threatened to disembowel me if I didn’t get out of his way in the hall, went to bed. Set the alarm for eight o’clock. Put down a tumblerful of gin to help him. Where’s Barker?” Connington repeated. “Dreamland, Hawks — whatever dreamland it was that awaited him.”"|"Rogue Moon"|"Algis Budrys"
"ap 07:50"|"ten minutes of eight"|"At ten minutes of eight, a radio began to play loud jazz upstairs. Ten minutes later, the electric blat of the radio’s alarm roiled the music, and a moment after that there was a brittle crash, and then only the occasional sound of Barker stumbling about and getting dressed."|"Rogue Moon"|"Algis Budrys"
09:00|"nine in the morning"|"Hawks turned around. He came back and stood with his hands on the edge of the passenger side, looking down at Barker. “I’ll expect you at the main gate tomorrow at nine in the morning, sharp.”"|"Rogue Moon"|"Algis Budrys"
