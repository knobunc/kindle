one railway fact — that it is generally a 4-hour journey from Paddington (1923),

Wellington (under 3 hours from Paddington) and, excluding Shrewsbury itself,
Gobowen (about 3 hours 40 minutes) . This latter puts Blandings Castle eight
miles from the Severn, which means that the river could hardly flow ‘through
its grounds’ (though it might flow through its land, but that is not the same
thing) . It also puts the castle in the suburbs of Oswestry. This is so

Gardenia Club (see p. 22), in Leicester Square, was one of many started when the
Licensing Acts of the 1870s made restaurants close at 12.30 a.m. The Gardenia
was a dancing club and, unusually, had women as well as men as members. It was
less exclusive, in that way and generally, than the Pelican. It was opened,
probably in 1882, by the Bohee brothers, black musicians who had come over from
America with Haverley’s Minstrels. They sold the club to William Dudley Ward,
father of the Member of Parliament for Southampton (1906-1922). Dudley Ward
persuaded La Goulue (see Toulouse Lautrec’s Moulin Rouge drawings) to appear at
the club. He sold the club to an Australian, ‘Shut-Eye’ Smith, who was its
owner when the police closed it down, probably for infringements of the
drinking rules, probably in 1889. I am indebted for this information again to
Col. Murphy."|"Sunset at Blandings"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
