But all there is to see is ice and the nearer we get to it the more evident it is that the ice is not in good shape.

Instead of some grizzly bearded old-timer, a tall, pale, studious figure comes out to welcome us. He does have a beard, but attached as it is to long, aquiline features the effect is more rabbi than trapper. The second surprise is how benignly and agreeably he copes with the appearance of ten tired and hungry travellers in the middle of the night. First we fill up his minuscule hallway with our boots and bags, then we burst his sitting-room to the seams while he heats up some stew on a wood-burning stove.

This means that as we head east to the fishing grounds we have to push through a thickening ice-field.

Also boarding at Tromso are sacks of potatoes and onions, sides of meat, televisions, wash-basins and mail.

There isn’t much compensation in the landscape. An unrelieved horizontal band of cloud hangs, like a pelmet, over the treeless headlands. When Hammerfest does appear, a smudge nestling in a bowl of tundra-covered hills, it lacks the sparkle of Tromso.

Unfortunately there is no wiper in the fitting and there is a horrid screech as the metal claw scrapes blindly at the windscreen, which is already broken anyway. Almost everything to do with the vehicles is a headache for Volodya and his team. The chronic shortage of petrol means that to be sure of supplies our regular drivers have to fill up at three in the morning, and the chronic shortage of glass is why every other windscreen in the city is cracked. At the restaurant we have zakuski - an hors d’oeuvre comprising slices of tomato, cucumber, pickle, tinned ham, beef and pork on a bed of lettuce, hard-boiled eggs in mayonnaise, fish paste and caviar. Vodka and wine are liberally supplied, and because the wine is so rough and beer seems impossible to come by most of us attend to the vodka.

About three o’clock the show gets on the road with a public shaving of the groom. Polycarpus is a modern Cypriot, a student in Germany, who looks very different from his beaming, ruddy-cheeked father who is the current head man of the village. He sits in the half-finished shell of the house that is being built for him and his wife, and with a brave smile submits to the attentions of an elderly barber who has a disconcerting habit of swatting flies away with his cut-throat razor."|"Pole to Pole"|"Michael Palin"

There is music and dancing, including one dance in which the marital bed is blessed, and four men in suits have to perform a particularly tricky soft-shoe shuffle while holding a mattress on their shoulders. There is still no respite for Polycarpus and Ariadne. They are dragged up on stage to cut the cake, and all goes well until the best man opens the champagne over-zealously and a stream of foam deluges the bridal pair. As champagne drips down his forehead I see Polycarpus’s smile wither for a split second before he’s back to being man of the moment and leading the hastily mopped-up Ariadne into a slow, rather inelegant dance which could be called the Lumbago. The reason it is so slow is that during the dance relatives and friends come up and pin money to the couple. Polycarpus is no Fred Astaire at the best of times and having to trip the light fantastic festooned with currency doesn’t help. By midnight they must both be carrying close on a thousand pounds each, and I now understand those who say that these weddings, besides being good for public relations, can be run at a considerable profit. Not that that can be much consolation for Polycarpus, who is now quite seriously wilting, and the night still young. But his wife is beautiful and 3000 guests are having a great time and there’s a near full moon in the cloudless sky."|"Pole to Pole"|"Michael Palin"

Romany is doing his best to prevail upon the officer in charge, telling him we have been through all this for seven hours yesterday and he has the paperwork to prove it. After an hour we are allowed to repack our bus and leave. As the imperious senior officer barks orders at the soldiers lounging by the gate, I notice his right hand is playing with a string of beads.

We have reached the lock at Esna, thirty miles from Luxor, a bottleneck of quite serious proportions which they don’t mention in the brochures. The lock was built by the British in 1908, and it has room for only one ship at a time. It takes thirty-five minutes to get each one through and, as they alternate between those going north and south, it can mean a seventy-minute wait; if you’re lucky. But the lock also incorporates a swing road-bridge so it is closed every alternate hour. There are four ships ahead of us, and Wahid, our cruise director, estimates that we will not be through until late afternoon. ‘And this is not the busy time,’ he adds gloomily, ‘from late September it will start to be the busy time … during, let’s say, New Year’s Eve, sometimes it reaches up to twenty-four ships each side.’"|"Pole to Pole"|"Michael Palin"

The concentration of light grows slowly, expands and then widens into an expanse of pale pink, extinguishing the stars. A half-hour later the crest of the sun edges into a whitening, cloudless sky and within a matter of seconds it is riding free of the mountains, growing in power and brilliance until it is a ball of molten gold.

Bungi, I’m told by Byron, the leader of the team, who has a world record jump of over 800 feet to his credit, is an Indonesian word for the particular rubbery twine they use in their descents. Having nearly given my life to the Zambesi I am not at all tempted to fling myself upside-down into a gorge, but I recognize someone who is. It’s Conrad, our organizer from yesterday. Slim and insubstantial beside the chunky white men in beer-brand T-shirts who seem to make up the bulk of the jumpers, he grins nervously as a red towel is wrapped around his ankles and the rope lashed carefully over it. Tied only by his feet, he climbs onto the parapet of the bridge, moistens his lips, murmurs something - I think it’s ‘goodbye’ - and hurls himself out and away from the bridge. As he goes he flings his arms out, plummeting in a Christlike free-fall nearly 300 feet to the river below.

"ap > 02:00"|"After two"|"After two or three approaches as Dan and Scott search for the oil drums, we put down on the ice, at a spot called King’s Peak. After two and a half hours sitting in the plane, unable to change position, it is a relief to clamber down onto the ice, even if it is into the teeth of a strong, bitingly cold wind."|"Pole to Pole"|"Michael Palin"

23:30|"11.30 p.m."|"11.30 p.m. We have seen the last of the rock-strewn slopes of the escarpment, now there is nothing but whiteness below in every direction. In front of me Clem settles to sleep. Dan has changed his sealskin hat for a baseball cap, held in place by his headset. Scott is concerned to know if any of us are feeling the effects of altitude - for we are at the equivalent of 20,000 feet above sea-level, in an unpressurized plane. I sense that I am taking shorter breaths, but apart from that I feel good, bumped by the excitement of my situation from the tired, almost melancholy heaviness I felt as we sat at King’s Peak an hour ago."|"Pole to Pole"|"Michael Palin"
00:30|"12.30 a.m."|"12.30 a.m. Over the noise of the engine Dan shouts back that we are forty-seven minutes from the Pole."|"Pole to Pole"|"Michael Palin"

01:10|"1.10 a.m."|"1.10 a.m. We can see the South Pole ahead. It is somewhere in the middle of a complex of buildings dominated by a 150-foot-wide geodesic dome. Vehicles and building materials are scattered about the site. It is the busiest place we’ve seen in Antarctica."|"Pole to Pole"|"Michael Palin"
01:20|"1.20 a.m."|"1.20 a.m. We land at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, scudding to a halt on a wide, cleared snow runway."|"Pole to Pole"|"Michael Palin"
02:00|"two o’clock in the morning"|"The South Pole is on New Zealand Time. Everyone is eating, not because it’s two o’clock in the morning and they can’t sleep, but because we have leapt forward sixteen hours, a time-shift of record breaking proportions. These people are coming in for their evening meal."|"Pole to Pole"|"Michael Palin"
03:15|"3.15 in the morning"|"The temperature, with wind chill, is a cutting, almost paralysing minus fifty Centigrade, and it’s 3.15 in the morning at 10,000 feet when I set out on the final lap of this extraordinary journey."|"Pole to Pole"|"Michael Palin"
