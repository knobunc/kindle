00:00|midnight|"At midnight his wife and daughter might still be bustling about, preparing holiday delicacies in the kitchen, straightening up the house, or perhaps getting their kimonos ready or arranging flowers. Oki would sit in the dining room and listen to the radio. As the bells rang he would look back at the departing year. He always found it a moving experience. Some years that emotion was violent or painful. Sometimes he was racked by sorrow and regret. Even when the sentimentality of the announcers repelled him, the tolling of the bells echoed in his heart. For a long time he had been tempted by the thought of being in Kyoto one New Year’s Eve to hear the living sound of those old temple bells."|"Beauty and Sadness"|"Yasunari Kawabata"
"ap > 10:00"|"A little after ten o’clock"|"When he arrived in Kyoto, Oki went directly to the Miyako Hotel. He asked for a quiet room, with the thought that Otoko might come to see him. The elevator seemed to rise six or seven floors; but since the hotel was built in steps upward along a steep slope of the Eastern Hills, the long corridor he followed led back to a ground-floor wing. The rooms along the corridor were as silent as if there were no other guests. A little after ten o’clock he began hearing clamorous foreign voices all around him. Oki asked the floor boy about it."|"Beauty and Sadness"|"Yasunari Kawabata"
"ap < 11:00"|"almost eleven"|"Oki had been aroused early by the children, but once the two foreign families went out he fell asleep again. It was almost eleven when he awakened."|"Beauty and Sadness"|"Yasunari Kawabata"
"ap ~ 10:00"|"about ten o’clock"|"One of her stories was about a man bewitched by a badger. They had found him splashing along in the river at dawn, screaming for help. He was floundering in the shallows under the Togetsu Bridge, where you could easily climb up on the bank. It seems that after he was rescued and came to his senses, he told them he had been wandering around the mountain like a sleepwalker from about ten o’clock the night before—and the next thing he knew he was in the river."|"Beauty and Sadness"|"Yasunari Kawabata"
"ap 03:30"|three-thirty|"As he left he looked up again at the heavy thatched roof. Its mossy, decaying charm appealed to him, but the mistress of the restaurant explained that, being under the trees, it never really got a chance to dry out. It was not very old, less than ten years ago they had put on new thatching. A half moon gleamed in the sky just beyond the roof. It was three-thirty. As Oki went down the river road he watched kingfishers skimming low over the water. He could see the colors of their wings."|"Beauty and Sadness"|"Yasunari Kawabata"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"“No, don’t,” Otoko said a little hastily. “I’ll come for you. At eight o’clock … perhaps that’s early, so let’s say around nine, at your hotel. I’ll make a reservation somewhere.”"|"Beauty and Sadness"|"Yasunari Kawabata"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"Oki had hoped for a leisurely dinner with her, but nine o’clock would be after dinner. Still, he was glad she had agreed. The Otoko of his old memories had come to life again."|"Beauty and Sadness"|"Yasunari Kawabata"
"ap 09:20"|"twenty past nine"|"It was twenty past nine when a call from the lobby announced Miss Ueno."|"Beauty and Sadness"|"Yasunari Kawabata"
13:30|"half past one that afternoon"|"Oki was standing on a low hill, his gaze held by the purple sunset. He had been at his desk since half past one that afternoon, and had left the house to take a walk after finishing an installment of a serial for a newspaper. He lived in the hilly northern outskirts of Kamakura, and his house was across the valley. The glow spread high in the western sky. The richness of the purple made him wonder if there might be a thin bank of clouds. A purple sunset was most unusual. There were subtle gradations of color from dark to light, as if blended by trailing a wide brush across wet rice paper. The softness of the purple implied the coming of spring. At one place the haze was pink. That seemed to be where the sun was setting."|"Beauty and Sadness"|"Yasunari Kawabata"
"ap ~ 04:30"|"around four-thirty"|"Oki opened his supper early, around four-thirty. It was an assortment of New Year’s foods, including some small, perfectly formed rice balls. They seemed to express a woman’s emotions. No doubt Otoko herself had made them for the man who had long ago destroyed her girlhood. Chewing the little bite-sized rice balls, he could feel her forgiveness in his very tongue and teeth. No, it was not forgiveness, it was love. Surely it was a love that still lived deep within her. All he knew of her years in Kyoto was that she had made her way alone, as a painter. Perhaps there had been other loves, other affairs. Yet he knew that what she felt for him was a young girl’s desperate love. He himself had gone on to other women. But he had never loved again with such pain."|"Beauty and Sadness"|"Yasunari Kawabata"
12:00|midday|"But it was not merely from pleasure in the undulating waves of light and dark green that Otoko had wanted to paint the Uji tea plantation. After the breakup of her affair with Oki she had fled to Kyoto with her mother, and then gone back and forth several times to Tokyo, but what especially lingered in her mind from those days were the tea fields around Shizuoka, seen from the train window. Sometimes she saw them at midday, sometimes in the evening. She was still only a high-school student, and had no idea of becoming a painter; it was just that at the sight of the tea fields the sadness of parting suddenly pressed in on her. She could not say why these rather inconspicuous green slopes had so touched her heart, when along the railway line there were mountains, lakes, the sea—at times even clouds dyed in sentimental colors. But perhaps their melancholy green, and the melancholy evening shadows of the ridges across them, had brought on the pain. Then too, they were small, well-groomed slopes with deeply shaded ridges, not nature in the wild; and the rows of rounded tea bushes looked like flocks of gentle green sheep. But it may have been simply that Otoko, sad even before leaving Tokyo, reached the peak of her sadness the first time the train passed Shizuoka."|"Beauty and Sadness"|"Yasunari Kawabata"

00:00|midnight|"The corridor beside his study was a wide one, with a writing table and chair in the corner. He wrote either there or at a low table on the matted floor of the study. The couch in the corridor was very comfortable. When he stretched out on it his difficulties vanished from his mind. It was uncanny. While he was writing a novel he tended to sleep poorly at night and to dream about his work, but on the couch in the corridor he quickly fell into a deep sleep that blotted out everything. When he was young he never had a nap. Often the whole afternoon would be taken up by callers. He wrote at night, usually from midnight till dawn. Now that he worked during the day he had begun taking naps, but not at any fixed time. Whenever he felt blocked in his writing he lay down on the couch. Sometimes it was in the morning, sometimes almost evening. Only rarely did he feel, as he used to when he worked at night, that fatigue stimulated his imagination."|"Beauty and Sadness"|"Yasunari Kawabata"
"ap 08:30"|eight-thirty|"Keiko had to go to the main residence of the temple to make her telephone call. When she came back Otoko was still hurrying to get dressed.
“Ofusa says we can have a balcony table until eight-thirty.”
“Eight-thirty?” Otoko frowned. “Well, that will do. If we go right away we can have a leisurely dinner.” Drawing the side mirrors of the vanity closer together, she leaned forward and looked at her hair. “I suppose I needn’t redo it.”"|"Beauty and Sadness"|"Yasunari Kawabata"

"ap 02:01"|"two one"|"Her own painting showed the same young geisha, doubled, playing scissors-paper-and-stone. She wanted to give an uneasy feeling that the one girl was two, the two one, or perhaps neither one nor two. Even the dated trick photograph had something of that feeling. To avoid ending up with a merely clever notion, Otoko took great pains over the faces. The decorative pattern of the clothing that looked so bulky in the photograph was a help, and set off the four hands vividly. Although the painting was not an exact copy, many Kyoto people must have recognized at a glance that it was based on a photograph of an early Meiji geisha."|"Beauty and Sadness"|"Yasunari Kawabata"

"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"When Keiko came home after midnight Otoko had been too engrossed in gazing at the sketches to pay any particular attention. Keiko hurried to bed without even bathing and promptly fell asleep. But perhaps Otoko thought Keiko was sleeping because she herself had soon dropped off to sleep."|"Beauty and Sadness"|"Yasunari Kawabata"
"ap 09:45"|"quarter to ten"|"“What time is it?”
“A quarter to ten.”
