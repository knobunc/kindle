"ap 00:00"|twelve|"Richard Axel was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1948, the first child of immigrant parents who had fled Poland before the Nazi invasion. His childhood was typical for the neighborhood: running errands for his father, a tailor, between playing stickball (a kind of street baseball, with manhole covers as the bases and a broom handle as bat) or basketball in the local roads and courtyards. His first job, aged eleven, was as a messenger, delivering false teeth to dentists; at twelve he was laying carpets, and at thirteen serving corned beef and pastrami in a local delicatessen. The chef was a Russian who used to recite Shakespeare while slicing cabbage heads, providing the young Richard with his first real exposure to the cultural world beyond delis and basketball courts and inspiring a deep and abiding love of great literature. Axel’s intellectual talents were spotted by a local high-school teacher who encouraged him to apply, successfully, for a scholarship to Columbia University in New York to read literature."|"Life on the Edge"|"Johnjoe McFadden"
"ap 00:00"|twelve|"JEAN-MARIE CHAUVET was born in the ancient French province of Auvergne, but when he was five his parents moved south-east to the Ardèche, a spectacular region of rivers, gorges and canyons cut into the underlying limestone rock. At twelve, Jean-Marie discovered his lifelong passion as he and his friends first donned Second World War helmets to explore the many caverns and caves dug out of the Ardèche valley walls along its great river. He left school at the age of fourteen, working first as a stonemason, then as a hardware store clerk and finally as a caretaker. Yet, inspired by Norbert Casteret’s book My Life Underground, Jean-Marie devoted every weekend he could to his childhood passion, climbing across sheer rock faces or digging through dark caverns, dreaming of one day being the first person to set eyes on the hidden treasure of an unexplored cave. “It’s always the unknown that leads us. When you’re walking along in a cave, you don’t know what you’re going to find. Will it end around the next corner, or will you discover something fantastic?”"|"Life on the Edge"|"Johnjoe McFadden"

The noontide sun, call’d forth the mutinous winds,
And ’twixt the green sea and the azured vault"|"Life on the Edge"|"Johnjoe McFadden"

But the sun now climbs high in the midday sky and its fierce heat has dried the shallow streams that wind through the woodland. The forest is becoming parched and inhospitable to our European passerine. It is time for her to move on."|"Life on the Edge"|"Johnjoe McFadden"
