"ap 07:20"|7.20|"It was a cold windy evening with occasional bursts of thin misty rain. Sir Stafford Nye turned up the collar of his mackintosh and plodded on. It was not the first time he had gone across Hungerford Bridge, but it had never seemed to him a walk to take for pleasure. Beneath him was the river and crossing the bridge were large quantities of hurrying figures like himself. Their mackintoshes pulled round them, their hats pulled down and on the part of one and all of them an earnest desire to get home and out of the wind and rain as soon as possible. It would be, thought Sir Stafford Nye, very difficult to recognize anybody in this scurrying crowd. 7.20. Not a good moment to choose for a rendezvous of any kind. Perhaps it was Hungerford Bridge in Berkshire. Anyway, it seemed very odd."|"Passenger to Frankfurt"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 04:30"|four-thirty|"‘But of course, Staffy dear, it will be lovely to have you. Take the four-thirty train. It still runs, you know, but it gets here an hour and a half later. And it leaves Paddington later–five-fifteen. That’s what they mean by improving the railways, I suppose. Stops at several most absurd stations on the way. All right. Horace will meet you at King’s Marston.’"|"Passenger to Frankfurt"|"Agatha Christie"

‘Four a.m.,’ she said. ‘Be ready.’
She went straight into her room and shut the door and he went to his."|"Passenger to Frankfurt"|"Agatha Christie"

Then they had driven down the winding road, leaving the Schloss high above them and they had come at last, after many hours of driving, to a stronghold in the Dolomites–an amphitheatre in the mountains where meetings, concerts and reunions of the various Youth Groups were held."|"Passenger to Frankfurt"|"Agatha Christie"
