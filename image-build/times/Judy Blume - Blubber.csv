"ap < 00:00"|"almost twelve"|"Margaret Simon, almost twelve, likes long hair, tuna fish, the smell of rain, and things that are pink. She’s just moved from New York City to the suburbs, and she’s anxious to fit in with her new friends, so when they form a secret club to talk about boys, bras, and getting their first periods, Margaret is happy to belong. But none of them can believe Margaret doesn’t have a religion. And Margaret can’t tell them the truth: that she can talk to God anyway, about everything that’s on her mind—including Philip Leroy, the best-looking boy in sixth grade."|Blubber|"Judy Blume"
"ap 05:30"|five-thirty|"“Be back at five-thirty,” Mrs. Sandmeier called, as I walked up the driveway."|Blubber|"Judy Blume"
"ap 10:30"|ten-thirty|"We were back in our classroom at ten-thirty and Mrs. Minish said we’d work on math and science until lunchtime. I tried to concentrate on my math but when Mrs. Minish asked to see my paper she drew red lines across every problem."|Blubber|"Judy Blume"
"ap 05:00"|five|"Tracy called at five. “What time will you be ready to go Trick-or-Treating?”"|Blubber|"Judy Blume"
"ap 06:30"|six-thirty|"“Me neither.”
“I’ll meet you outside at six-thirty.”
“Okay …”"|Blubber|"Judy Blume"
"ap 08:30"|eight-thirty|"“Have fun,” my mother said. “But remember, if you’re not home by eight-thirty, I’m sending your father to find you.”"|Blubber|"Judy Blume"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"At eleven Mr. Kubeck, the custodian, delivers our lunch milk. He leaves it outside the classroom door, in the hall. When I see it standing there my stomach growls and I start thinking about my peanut butter sandwich, sitting inside my stuffy old locker, getting soggy. By lunchtime the milk is warm. I think it’s sour too. I’ve told my mother to report that to the Board of Health. We’ll be able to buy cold milk next year, when the school gym is converted into a part-time cafeteria. Until then we have to suffer through lunch in our classrooms."|Blubber|"Judy Blume"
12:00|noon|"At noon Mrs. Minish leaves the room. She goes out to lunch every day. All the teachers do. It makes me mad to think of them sitting in some nice restaurant eating hamburgers and french fries while I have to sit at my desk drinking sour milk."|Blubber|"Judy Blume"
"ap 01:15"|one-fifteen|"Miss Rothbelle sent for us at one-fifteen so we’d have time to rehearse before assembly. She made us stand in size place on the stage. I wound up between Rochelle, who is a new girl, and Linda, with Wendy right behind me. All during rehearsal Wendy kept giving me little pokes and pinches, trying to make me laugh. But I kept a straight face the whole time."|Blubber|"Judy Blume"
01:00|"one this morning"|"Then she stood up and fanned the air, trying to get rid of the smoke. “I couldn’t help it,” she said. “I really needed one this morning.”"|Blubber|"Judy Blume"
"ap 09:58"|"two to ten"|"“So who won the game?” Tracy asked.
“Them … two to ten.”
That night I struggled over my math homework for an hour. I should be great at math since my father is a tax lawyer and my mother works with computers. I don’t understand why I have such a hard time with word problems. Dad explained three of them to me but he doesn’t set the problems up the way we’re supposed to, so even though I got the right answers I knew Mrs. Minish would still mark some of them wrong. But I’d done my best and Mom and Dad always say that’s what counts."|Blubber|"Judy Blume"
"ap > 11:00"|"after eleven"|"By the time we got to the temple in New Jersey it was after eleven. There was no place to park so Dad dropped us off in front while he drove around the block."|Blubber|"Judy Blume"
12:00|noon|"By noon we’d been working for three hours and we weren’t even halfway through. My mother drove by with lunch for us."|Blubber|"Judy Blume"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"At three o’clock Mrs. Wu drove by with some juice and cookies. I showed her my blisters, one on each finger of my right hand, except for my pinky. Mrs. Wu took the First Aid kit from her glove compartment and rubbed some ointment on my blisters. She gave me enough Band Aids to cover them. “Your father’s coming to pick you up at five,” she told me."|Blubber|"Judy Blume"

"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"At ten o’clock it started to rain. At eleven, when Mr. Kubeck delivered our milk, it was pouring. By noon the playground and field were practically flooded. I knew we wouldn’t be able to go outside even if it stopped raining, which it didn’t."|Blubber|"Judy Blume"
