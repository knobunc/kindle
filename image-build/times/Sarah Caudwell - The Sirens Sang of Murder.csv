It was a few minutes after half past five that I made my way to the Corkscrew, expecting it to be some time before I was joined by any of my friends. I found Julia, however, already there, though she claimed to be still working. She had thought that a glass of wine would prove an aid to the construction of a particularly opaque provision of the new Finance Bill. She could not permit herself, therefore, to engage in any immediate sociability. In the meantime, she suggested, it might amuse me to read the telex messages which she had received from Cantrip in the course of the weekend."|"The Sirens Sang of Murder"|"Sarah Caudwell"

Yoo-hoo there, Larwood—thanks for the telex, but not ruddy likely. My clients go waltzing along to the Royal Court to get directions and who’s that sitting at the back of the courtroom with his notebook out and his ears flapping? The chap from the Financial Times, that’s who, Larwood, the one who’s always chatting up Selena and wanting to do exposés of things. If you were a Swiss bank that had lost its files and didn’t know what to do with nine million quid, would you want a half-page spread in the F. T. about it?

No, the essence of the Alcibiades strategy, as I understand it, is to make no advance oneself but to find ways to make it clear that one would be happy to receive one. So I invited Patrick to help me to finish off a bottle of wine which I had in my room and which would otherwise be wasted—and you will surely admit, Ragwort, that considering how late it was, he could without any incivility or embarrassment have said no.”"|"The Sirens Sang of Murder"|"Sarah Caudwell"

Cantrip left the bar of the hotel at about a quarter past ten on Monday evening together with Clementine and the Contessa, and Edward Malvoisin was then alive and well. From then on, apart from the brief interval required to change into night attire, Clementine and Cantrip remained in each other’s company until the moment when the drunken handyman came galloping into the garden—that is to say, until after the accident which blocked the entrance to the Coupee. We have no way of knowing whether Edward Malvoisin’s death occurred before or after the accident, but in either case Clementine can have had no hand in it. If it was before, then it was while she was with Cantrip. If after, then at a place where it was physically impossible for her to have been at that time—unless you imagine, I suppose, that she could have scrambled down the cliffs and reached it by boat.”"|"The Sirens Sang of Murder"|"Sarah Caudwell"

We were on our way up to our rooms when we heard all the noise of Albert coming back. We looked out of the landing window to see what was going on, and there he was up on his horse and shouting out about the woman in white, with Philip swearing back at him in Sercquais.

By ‘enclosed’ she seems to mean ‘attached by means of a paper clip,’ and by ‘clear’ she seems to mean ‘totally obscure’—I suppose one can’t expect a very high standard of precision at five o’clock in the morning.

Item one—a telex message from Clementine to Cantrip, sent at lunchtime yesterday, asking him to attend a meeting at the Grand Hotel this morning and to telephone to confirm the arrangement. Item two—a telex message to Cantrip from the Contessa di Silvabianca, transmitted in Monaco yesterday afternoon, inviting him to have breakfast with her. Item three—item three, Hilary, is a telex message from you to Julia, apparently dispatched from Monte Carlo late last night, indicating that if Cantrip goes to Jersey he will be in danger of a murderous attack from the same person who is responsible for the death of Edward Malvoisin.
