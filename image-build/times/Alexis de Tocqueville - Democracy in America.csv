   The constitution provided that there should not be more than one representative for every 30,000 people but no minimum was fixed. Congress has not thought it necessary to increase the number of representatives in proportion to increased population. By the first law passed on this subject, that of 14 April 1792 (see Story’s Laws of the United States, vol. 1, p. 235), it was decided that there should be one representative for every 33,000 inhabitants. The final law, passed in 1832, fixed the number of one representative for 48,000 inhabitants. The population, for this purpose, was calculated as all free men and three-fifths of the number of slaves."|"Democracy in America"|"Alexis de Tocqueville"

I am not, therefore, making an absolute statement that men living in democratic times should never make revolutions but I do think that they rightly hesitate more than any other peoples before embarking upon one and that it is preferable for them to suffer many discomforts in their present conditions than to resort to such a perilous solution."|"Democracy in America"|"Alexis de Tocqueville"
10:00|"ten o’clock in the morning"|"At ten o’clock in the morning of 19 July, we embarked upon the steamship Ohio, in the direction of Detroit. A fierce breeze blew from the north-west and gave the waters of Lake Erie every appearance of an ocean. On the right, the horizon stretched out limitless; on the left, we hugged the southern shores of the lake which we frequently approached within shouting distance. These shores were entirely flat and contrasted in that respect with all the European lakes I had ever had the opportunity of visiting. Nor were they at all like seashores. Extensive forests cast their shade over them and formed around the lake a dense and almost uninterrupted belt. Occasionally, however, the countryside suddenly changed its appearance. Coming around the angle of a wood, we glimpsed the elegant spire of a bell tower, brilliantly white, and spruce houses and shops. A few steps more and the primitive and apparently impenetrable forest recovered its sway and once again cast the reflection of its foliage upon the waters of the lake."|"Democracy in America"|"Alexis de Tocqueville"

"~ 00:00"|"About midnight"|"The night following this hot day was one of the most difficult I have ever spent in my life. The mosquitoes had become so irritating that it was impossible to close my eyes despite being overwhelmed by tiredness. About midnight, the storm which had been threatening for a long time finally burst. Having abandoned any hope of falling asleep, I rose and went to open the door of our cabin to breathe the fresh night air at least. It had not rained again and the atmosphere appeared calm but the forest was already swaying; it growled and moaned far into its depths. Occasionally lightning lit up the sky. The quiet flow of the Saginaw, the narrow strip along its banks, the roofs of five or six cabins, and the belt of surrounding foliage looked just then, for a moment, like an evocation of the future. Everything melted into the darkest obscurity and the frightening voice of the wilderness began again to be heard."|"Democracy in America"|"Alexis de Tocqueville"

All the Indians from the Saginaw neighborhood had disappeared; they had left to go and receive the presents which the English gave them every year while the Europeans were occupied with the harvest. We had, therefore, to resolve to travel through the forest without a guide. The undertaking was not as difficult as one might suppose. There is generally only one path through these vast solitudes and it is only a matter of keeping to the track in order to reach one’s destination."|"Democracy in America"|"Alexis de Tocqueville"
05:00|"five o’clock in the morning"|"So, at five o’clock in the morning we crossed the Saginaw once more. We received the farewells and final advice from our hosts and, turning our horses’ heads, we were alone in the middle of the forest. I confess that it was not without a serious feeling that we began to push forward into these humid depths. This very forest around us stretched from there on toward the Pole and the Pacific Ocean. Only one inhabited spot lay between us and the limitless wilderness and we had just left it behind. Moreover, these thoughts simply served to spur our horses on and after three hours we reached an abandoned wigwam and the isolated banks of the River Cass. A green area jutting out into the river, shaded by tall trees, served as our table and we started lunch with a view over the river whose crystal clear waters wound through the wood."|"Democracy in America"|"Alexis de Tocqueville"
