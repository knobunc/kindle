"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"It was past midnight. Bod began to walk toward
the old chapel. The tree that grew out of the gutter on the spire had fallen in
the last storm, taking a handful of the slate-black roof tiles with it."|"The Graveyard Book"|"Neil Gaiman"
16:00|"four in the afternoon"|"The gates were locked. They were always locked at
four in the afternoon in winter, at eight at night in summer. Spike-topped iron
railings ran around part of the cemetery, a high brick wall around the rest of
it. The bars of the gates were closely spaced: they would have stopped a grown
man from getting through, even stopped a ten-year-old child…"|"The Graveyard Book"|"Neil Gaiman"

"< 00:00"|"almost midnight"|"It was high summer. It would not get fully dark
until almost midnight. There were no lessons in high summer—the time that Bod
spent awake he spent in an endless warm twilight in which he would play or
explore or climb."|"The Graveyard Book"|"Neil Gaiman"
"~ 12:00"|"Around midday"|"Around midday, with the dead-eyed sun high
overhead, the ghouls stopped, and huddled. Ahead of them, high in the sky,
circling on the hot air currents, were the night-gaunts, dozens of them, riding
the thermals."|"The Graveyard Book"|"Neil Gaiman"
"< 00:00"|"almost midnight"|"It was almost midnight, and it was still not
fully dark. The three of them sat at the top of the hill, with the lights of
the city glimmering beneath them."|"The Graveyard Book"|"Neil Gaiman"
00:00|midnight|"“Yes. Exactly,” said Silas. “Suicides, criminals,
and witches. Those who died unshriven.” He stood up, a midnight shadow in the
twilight. “All this talking,” he said, “and I have not even had my breakfast.
While you will be late for lessons.” In the twilight of the graveyard there was
a silent implosion, a flutter of velvet darkness, and Silas was gone."|"The Graveyard Book"|"Neil Gaiman"
09:00|"nine in the morning"|"It was nine in the morning, when all the world is
sleeping. Bod was determined to stay awake. He was, after all, on a mission. He
was eight years old, and the world beyond the graveyard held no terrors for
him."|"The Graveyard Book"|"Neil Gaiman"
"ap 04:30"|"half past four"|"Dusk fell early in the afternoon, and it was night
by half past four. Bod wandered the paths of the graveyard, looking for someone
to talk to, but there was no one about. He walked down to the Potter’s Field to
see if Liza Hempstock was about, but found no one there. He went back to the
Owenses’ tomb, but found it also deserted: neither his father nor Mistress
Owens was anywhere to be seen."|"The Graveyard Book"|"Neil Gaiman"
00:00|midnight|"A clock began to strike somewhere close at hand:
the chimes of midnight, and they came."|"The Graveyard Book"|"Neil Gaiman"
"< 00:00"|"before midnight"|"Going to school with the living did not excuse Bod
from his lessons with the dead. The nights were long, and sometimes Bod would
apologize and crawl to bed exhausted before midnight. Mostly, he just kept
going."|"The Graveyard Book"|"Neil Gaiman"
"~ 04:00"|"gone four in the morning"|"“How exactly do I make a cold spot in the air?”
he asked, and “I think I’ve got Fear down, but how do I take it up all the way
to Terror?” and Mr. Pennyworth sighed and hurrumphed and did his best to
explain, and it was gone four in the morning before they were done."|"The Graveyard Book"|"Neil Gaiman"
00:00|midnight|"“When will Silas come back?”
The midnight wind was cold and it came from the
north.
Mrs. Owens was no longer angry. She feared for
her son. She said only, “I wish I knew, my darling boy, I wish I knew.”"|"The Graveyard Book"|"Neil Gaiman"
12:00|midday|"Scarlett helped Mr. Frost with his grave-rubbings
until midday, when they stopped for lunch. He offered to buy her fish and chips
as a thank-you, and they walked down to the fish and chip shop at the bottom of
the road, and as they walked back up the hill they ate their steaming fish and
chips, drenched in vinegar and glittering with salt, out of paper bags."|"The Graveyard Book"|"Neil Gaiman"
"~ 22:00"|"about 10 P.M."|"The flowers were popular, the chocolates, which
they had for dessert, were perfect, and Mr. Frost sat and talked then watched
television with them until about 10 P.M.,
when he said that he needed to get home."|"The Graveyard Book"|"Neil Gaiman"
