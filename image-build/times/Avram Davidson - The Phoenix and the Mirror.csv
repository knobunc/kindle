We are brother and sister, but we . . .” She looked about her, held out her slender hand, and he helped her rise."|"The Phoenix and the Mirror"|"Avram Davidson"

The floor was slippery with water, but he held his footing until he reached the stairs. And there he lost it . . ."|"The Phoenix and the Mirror"|"Avram Davidson"
"ap 01:00"|one|"Suddenly the rhythm of the rowers was interrupted. A cry went up, again the running of feet, and now the hasty hoisting of the sail. The sail snapped and cracked loudly — once — twice — a third time. The men shouted in triumph. Vergil arose without haste and with his stylus scratched up a bit of wax, working it between his fingers. The mandrake eyed him with great unease as he approached, then opened its mouth wide. But before that fearful, fatal, maddening cry could issue forth, Vergil had (seemingly at one and the same time) popped the bolus into the tiny mouth, looped the silken scarlet thread around the muted figure, and tore it loose from its fitting in the pot of earth."|"The Phoenix and the Mirror"|"Avram Davidson"
12:00|"high noon"|"“On the back of each was graven the Four quadrants of the Uranoscope, thus: the Sombre Warrior in the north, the Vermilion Phoenix in the south, in the east the Azure Dragon, and in the west the Milk-white Tiger.” [“Now, that idea, I rather like,” Clemens said. Vergil nodded.] “(Others say that locusts were also shewn, the winged locusts meriting a numerous posterity because they live in harmonious clusters.) “All magic mirrors must reflect the Six Limits of Space, comprising the four cardinal points plus zenith and nadir. They must be round as the heavens and yet square as the earth, and he who makes one must conjure it, Be thou like the Sun, like the Moon, like Water, and like Gold, clear and bright and reflecting what is in thy heart. Some authorities further distinguish between sunlight and moonlight mirrors. We will now explain the art by which the design on the back of a magic mirror is cast upon a wall or screen when a light strikes its front or reflecting surface . . .“If you would safely capture tiger cubs, you must carry with you a large mirror and place it in the path to be followed by the tigress, for, great as is her rage and grief, on perceiving her reflection, she is sure to forget all else and linger to admire it till the fall of night. . . . “The best alloy for mirror bronze [“What?” asked Vergil. “No more tigresses?”] . . . will consist in seventeen parts of copper to eight parts of tin [“This is rather less tin than we in Europe are accustomed to use for ordinary mirrors, but it approximates Egyptian usage quite closely, as well as our bell-metal.”] . . . Moonlight may be obtained by hanging a well-prepared mirror on a tree during the full of the moon and then distilling the dew which forms on its face. If this is done properly, a translucent container of it will give bright light in the darkness at any time; but if not, it will only shine according to the phases of the moon itself.“Solar fire for kindling the sacrificial flames may be caught in a concave mirror cast at high noon exactly on the solstice.“And now we will speak of molds and wax and stamps and clay and potter’s wheels to shape the curvèd surfaces. . . . “The bronzefounder borrows from the sculptor and the woodcarver borrows from both, the potter imitating the bronze-founder and in turn being imitated by the lapidary who influences the sculptor; thus turns the wheel, bringing up water to quicken all the fields and furrows . . . Suquas sayeth that, in casting mirrors, the ancients would give the large mirrors a plane surface and the small ones a convex surface; for all mirrors will relfect a man’s face large if they are concave and small if they are convex; and by reflecting the human face in reduced size, a mirror may be small and yet take in a man’s face complete, though the reflected image will correspond in size to the size of the mirror.”Clemens looked up from his reading. “This is an important passage,” he said."|"The Phoenix and the Mirror"|"Avram Davidson"

Its back was ornately and beautifully designed and inscribed, but no one lingered to examine or to decipher; all walked with eyes awestruck and unfocused. And, as they did so, an horlogue began to sound the twelfth hour and as it did the room began to darken, until at eleven it was almost black. Then came the stroke of twelve, Vergil reached out and snapped back the lid, and the bronze, resounding like a bell, encompassed and occluded the stroke of noon. Simultaneously the the darkness was pierced by a broad shaft of sunlight and Cornelia pulled from the bosom of her robe a long golden pin and thrust it at the blank but luminous face of the mirror’s disc. The pin touched, the surface of the disc went into flux like oil resting upon the surface of water when disturbed. The disorder became a whirlpool, round and round, drawing everything toward it and everything into it."|"The Phoenix and the Mirror"|"Avram Davidson"

Whose voice had cried her name, Vergil did not know, but it was Cornelia’s voice which cried out now, cried no name, cried out. The whirlpool swirled reversewise, closed in, the scene vanished, and the last vanishing echoes of the stroke of twelve were heard. The mirror was a mirror now, and nothing more. Vergil, Clemen, Cornelia saw their own faces, but Vergil now saw what he had already felt: it was his own face, his true face, his face complete. His missing soul had returned to him. Cornelia — she who now stood staring, staring, staring — had kept her word."|"The Phoenix and the Mirror"|"Avram Davidson"

The rigors of the climate were fortunately not matched by the severity of the people, who neither hinder travelers nor help them. The Garamantes are so shy and eremitical as to be willing to greet strangers only from a distance too great for voice to carry; often Vergil and Laura would see their strange, cloaked figures, arms upraised, outlined against the hill or sky. Always at their sides were their dogs, which the Garamantes love more than they love humankind; and this love is returned, for when the Numideans carried off captive the King of the Garamantes to hold for ransom, no less than two thousand of his own dogs followed his trail by scent and by stealth until they burst upon the sleeping camp to destroy the captors and release the king."|"The Phoenix and the Mirror"|"Avram Davidson"
