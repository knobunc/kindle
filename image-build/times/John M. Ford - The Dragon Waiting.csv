12:00|noonday|"Gregory lay very still in the dark, on his narrow bed, dressed in only a pair of hose. A little light seeped in around the draperies; he did not have a pin-board to block off the window. There was no fire. He was not cold, not able to be, and in the gray haze of light he could see as clearly as an ordinary man at noonday."|"The Dragon Waiting"|"John M. Ford"
00:00|midnight|"Last week a young man claiming to be a wizard had passed through Alesia; he promised a cure, for gold and the use of a servant girl in a midnight ritual. Cosmas's sickness did not ease. Caractacus's light cavalry caught the sorcerer and brought him back. He was still splashed with the girl's blood."|"The Dragon Waiting"|"John M. Ford"
00:00|Midnight|"The hall was tiled black and white, chessboard fashion—Lorenzo loved chess—with fluted false columns around the walls and a frieze of Muses and bemused satyrs just below the ceiling vault. Midnight was made day by countless candles, on the table, in wall sconces, in chandeliers of faceted crystal. Arched doorways were open on Lorenzo's botanic gardens; fall flowers were blooming, summer's dying, and the mingled smell was astonishing."|"The Dragon Waiting"|"John M. Ford"
"ap 04:00"|four|"With a sudden grin, he put hand to lyre, tossed his head back, and sang the next chime. Then he clenched a fist and declaimed the stroke of four."|"The Dragon Waiting"|"John M. Ford"
"< 00:00"|"before midnight"|"By the sixth stroke of the clock, Cynthia's giggles had completely escaped control, and before midnight tolled everyone in the room was laughing, chorusing the chimes with Lorenzo."|"The Dragon Waiting"|"John M. Ford"
"< 00:00"|"almost midnight"|"Cynthia was ready to drop from the saddle and die; on second thought she lacked the strength to fall down. She kept falling asleep without noticing; the landscape would seem to dissolve from one scene into another, Tuscan plains into foothills, hills into Apennines, one mountain pass into another. The post-horse knew the way, though, and the courier who rode escort with Cynthia knew when to stop their travel for a little rest and food and water. They did not come to a full stop until almost midnight, and then, the courier explained, it was only because of inadequate moonlight for traveling."|"The Dragon Waiting"|"John M. Ford"
"> 12:00"|"A little after noon"|"A little after noon they left the Imperial road, and after a few minutes on a side track the coach stopped at what looked more like a farmhouse than a coaching inn. Rabbit pelts were stretched on frames in the front yard, and there was no signboard."|"The Dragon Waiting"|"John M. Ford"
"> 12:00"|"just past noon"|"""Whatever."" She looked up; it was just past noon, and the thin clouds were brilliant. She turned back to Hywel. ""What did you say it was called?"" He could see the haze in her eyes."|"The Dragon Waiting"|"John M. Ford"
"> 12:00"|"a little after noon"|"Her bags were carried down to the castle courtyard a little after noon. Hywel was already there, mounted on a dark chestnut horse, a gift from the Earl; a white palfrey waited for Cynthia. She laughed when she mounted it, so that she would not cry. They rode out into a gentle October breeze."|"The Dragon Waiting"|"John M. Ford"
