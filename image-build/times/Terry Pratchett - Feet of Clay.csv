Autumn fog pressed itself against the midnight windowpanes.
Blood ran in a trickle across the pages of a rare volume of religious essays, which had been torn in half."|"Feet of Clay"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"The first clocks were striking eleven as Vimes’s sedan chair wobbled to a halt outside the Patrician’s palace. Commander Vimes’s legs were beginning to give out, but he ran up five flights of stairs as fast as possible and collapsed on a chair in the waiting salon."|"Feet of Clay"|"Terry Pratchett"
11:00|"11 A.M."|"“Yes?” said Vimes.
“11 A.M. Appointment with the Patrician.”
“Yes? Well it’s five past now.”"|"Feet of Clay"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 11:15"|"quarter past eleven"|"Someone very clever—certainly someone much cleverer than whoever had trained that imp—must have made the clock for the Partrician’s waiting room. It went tick-tock like any other clock. But somehow, and against all usual horological practice, the tick and the tock were irregular. Tick tock tick…and then the merest fraction of a second longer before…tock tick tock…and then a tick a fraction of a second earlier than the mind’s ear was now prepared for. The effect was enough, after ten minutes, to reduce the thinking processes of even the best-prepared to a sort of porridge. The Patrician must have paid the clockmaker quite highly.
The clock said quarter past eleven.
Vimes walked over to the door and, despite precedent, knocked gently."|"Feet of Clay"|"Terry Pratchett"
12:00|"twelve noon"|"“Yes?”
“Ey…twelve noon,” said the imp. “Lunch with Lady Sybil.”
It stared at their faces."|"Feet of Clay"|"Terry Pratchett"
14:00|"2 P.M."|"“Yes?”
“Memo: Appointment with bootmaker, 2 P.M.,” said the imp.
“It’s not two o’clock yet and that was Tuesday in any case,” said Vimes."|"Feet of Clay"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"“Yes?”
“Memo: Appointment with bootmaker, 2 P.M.,” said the imp.

"~ 03:00"|"around 3 A.M."|"Gods, he’d missed this. He’d patrolled alone in the old days. When there was just him, and the stones glistened around 3 A.M., it all seemed to make sense somehow—"|"Feet of Clay"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 09:00"|"nine of the clock"|"“It’s nine of the clock,” said the organizer, poking its head out of Vimes’s pocket. “‘I was unhappy because I had no shoes until I met a man with no feet.’”"|"Feet of Clay"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|Midnight|"The clouds had settled somewhat so that up here, six stories above the streets, it was possible to believe you were on a beach at the edge of a cold, moonlit sea. The occasional tall tower or steeple rose out of the clouds, but all sounds were muffled and pulled in on themselves. Midnight came and went."|"Feet of Clay"|"Terry Pratchett"
"< 00:00"|"nearly midnight"|"The fog glowed and sizzled around Five and Seven Yard. Flames roared up and all but set the thick clouds alight. Spitting liquid iron cooled in its moulds. Hammers rang out around the workshops. The ironmasters didn’t work by the clock, but by the more demanding physics of molten metal. Even though it was nearly midnight, Stronginthearm’s Iron Founders, Beaters and General Forging was still bustling."|"Feet of Clay"|"Terry Pratchett"
