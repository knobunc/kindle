"~ 00:00"|"About midnight"|"Billy was doing push-ups in the deserted horse barn. He wasn’t worried about eating the first worm. But people were always daring him to do things, and he’d found it was better to look ahead, to try to figure things out, get himself ready. Last winter Alan had dared him to sleep out all night in the igloo they’d built in Tom’s backyard. Why not? Billy had thought to himself. What could happen? About midnight, huddled shivering under his blankets in the darkness, he’d begun to wonder if he should give up and go home. His feet felt like aching stones in his boots; even his tongue, inside his mouth, was cold. But half an hour later, as he was stubbornly dancing about outside in the moonlight to warm himself, Tom’s dog Martha had come along with six other dogs, all in a pack, and Billy had coaxed them into the igloo and blocked the door with an orange crate, and after the dogs had stopped wrestling and nipping and barking and sniffing around, they’d all gone to sleep in a heap with Billy in the middle, as warm as an onion in a stew."|"How to Eat Fried Worms"|"Thomas Rockwell"

03:30|"three thirty in the morning"|"Billy’s father groaned and sat up. “Now, look. I am not going to call Dr. McGrath at three thirty in the morning to ask if it’s all right for my son to eat worms. That’s flat. Secondly, I do know that Billy’s not going to die before morning. If worms were poisonous, which they’re not, he would have been laid up before this. Billy, you’ve been eating worms for five days?”"|"How to Eat Fried Worms"|"Thomas Rockwell"
"< 00:00"|"Almost midnight"|"Alan struggled out of Joe’s grip and asked his father what time it was.
“Late. Almost midnight, I think.”
Joe pulled Alan’s head down and tried to sit on it."|"How to Eat Fried Worms"|"Thomas Rockwell"

“About quarter to twelve.”
“It was a trick!” He snatched his pants off the floor. “They were trying to make me forget!” He tumbled and slid downstairs, through the dining room, his shirttail flying, yanked open the drawer in the kitchen table, snatched out the flashlight, the drawer spilling out with a clatter and crash onto the floor, and slammed out the back door."|"How to Eat Fried Worms"|"Thomas Rockwell"
"< 00:00"|"almost midnight"|"“It was a trick,” panted Billy. “Alan and Joe were trying to make me forget. Fifteen worms in fifteen days. If I don’t eat one in the next ten minutes, Alan’ll say he’s won. It’s almost midnight.”"|"How to Eat Fried Worms"|"Thomas Rockwell"

“Tomorrow?” he said without turning. “Ten o’clock?”
He sounded as if he was going to cry."|"How to Eat Fried Worms"|"Thomas Rockwell"
