The goal of the company is to invent new ways of telling time, combiing “art and time telling into amusing and thought provoking clocks and watches.” This watch is as much a statement about the wearer as it is a timepiece."|"Emotional Design"|"Donald A.

Ekuan clearly prizes beauty—aesthetics—first. “A sense of beauty that lauds lightness and simplicity,” he continues, “desire that precipitates functionality, comfort, luxury, diversity. Fulfillment of beauty and its concomitant desire will be the aim of design in the future.”"|"Emotional Design"|"Donald A. Norman"

Need a bath, but no time (the bathroom’s flooded anyway from the broken sink I never got around to fixing). Got to work late and in horrible shape, was demoted as a result. Got home at 5:00, the repo man promptly showed up and repossessed my television because I forgot to pay my bills. My girlfriend won’t speak to me because she saw me flirting with the neighbor last night."|"Emotional Design"|"Donald A. Norman"

Bobrow told me that a programmer, having worked hard to get Eliza working on a BBN computer, finally finished about 5:00 A.M. Saturday morning and then went home, leaving the program running on the computer. (In those days—this was 1966—personal computers were unheard of, and only advanced companies, such as BBN, even had computers for its employees to use, which is one reason programmers had to work at night to get computer time.)"|"Emotional Design"|"Donald A.
