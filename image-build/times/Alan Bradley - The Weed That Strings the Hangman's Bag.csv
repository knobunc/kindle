"ap 00:00"|"twelve o’clock"|"At twelve o’clock, just at the time we should otherwise have been sitting down to lunch, there had been the departure from Buckshaw: my polished rosewood coffin being brought out of the drawing room, carried slowly down the broad stone steps to the driveway, and slid with heartbreaking ease into the open door of the waiting hearse, crushing beneath it a little bouquet of wildflowers that had been laid gently inside by one of the grieving villagers."|"The Weed That Strings the Hangman's Bag"|"Alan Bradley"

"ap 08:00"|"Eight o’clock"|"“Not in my circles,” Father said, looking at his wristwatch and pushing his chair back from the table.
“Eight o’clock,” he said. “Thursday.”
He did not have to explain himself. Without a word, Daffy and Feely and I got up and made dutifully for the drawing room, all in a scattered line like a convoy."|"The Weed That Strings the Hangman's Bag"|"Alan Bradley"
"ap 10:05"|"five past ten"|"Before I could even begin to recall her trespasses on my own good nature, Father went on: “Her train gets in to Doddingsley at five past ten, and I’d like you to be there to meet her.”"|"The Weed That Strings the Hangman's Bag"|"Alan Bradley"
"ap 10:05"|"five past ten"|"God blind me with a fish fork! Aunt Felicity’s train was due to arrive at five past ten and I’d completely forgotten about her! Father would have my guts for garters."|"The Weed That Strings the Hangman's Bag"|"Alan Bradley"
"ap 03:40"|"twenty minutes to four"|"The clock on the church tower showed twenty minutes to four, which was impossible: The stupid thing had probably stopped in the reign of Henry the Eighth and nobody had cared enough to set it going again."|"The Weed That Strings the Hangman's Bag"|"Alan Bradley"
12:00|noon|"As I raced past the corner of Spindle Lane, the clock set into the wall of the Thirteen Drakes showed that the time was either noon or midnight. I’m afraid I let slip rather a rude word."|"The Weed That Strings the Hangman's Bag"|"Alan Bradley"
00:00|midnight|"As I raced past the corner of Spindle Lane, the clock set into the wall of the Thirteen Drakes showed that the time was either noon or midnight. I’m afraid I let slip rather a rude word."|"The Weed That Strings the Hangman's Bag"|"Alan Bradley"
"ap 10:05"|Ten-oh-five|"Clarence skidded to a stop at one end of the Doddingsley railway platform as the train steamed in at the other.
“Ten-oh-five,” he said, glancing at wristwatch. “On the dot.”
As I knew she would be, the first passenger to step down from the carriage was Aunt Felicity. In spite of the heat, she was wearing a long, light-colored motoring coat and a great solar topee, which was tied under her chin with a broad blue ribbon. Various bits protruded from her person in all directions: hatpins, umbrella handles, rolled-up magazines, newspapers, shooting sticks, and so forth. She looked like a walking bird’s nest, or, rather, more like an ambulatory haystack."|"The Weed That Strings the Hangman's Bag"|"Alan Bradley"
"ap > 05:00"|"past five o’clock"|"I undid my shoes, peeled off my socks, and joined them. The sun was well down in the afternoon sky. It was probably now too late to bicycle to Hinley. By the time I got there, it would be past five o’clock, and Inspector Hewitt would be gone for the day."|"The Weed That Strings the Hangman's Bag"|"Alan Bradley"

Duquenois-Levine test of leaves and cigarette remnants from
Gibbet Wood indicates presence of Indian hemp (Cannabis
sativa). Gordon Ingleby growing—and smoking—the stuff.
Overheard his remark that it was “the end of the line” for
him. What did he mean? Who are the “rest of us” Rupert
spoke of? Who is “the dead woman”? Could it be Mrs.
Ingleby? Whatever is going on at Culverhouse Farm,
Rupert Porson is part of it."|"The Weed That Strings the Hangman's Bag"|"Alan Bradley"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"“If the vicar needs coins,” said Miss Cool, the postmistress, “why doesn’t he break into those paper collection boxes from the Sunday school? I know the money’s for missions, but he could always stuff in banknotes to replace what he’s taken. Save him from imposing on His Majesty for pennies, wouldn’t it? But then, vicars are not always as practical as you might think, are they, dear?”
By two o’clock, I was completely fagged out.
As I took my seat at last—front row, center—the eager buzz of the audience rose to a climax. We had a full house."|"The Weed That Strings the Hangman's Bag"|"Alan Bradley"

"ap 06:30"|six-thirty|"“Ring up Clarence and tell him we shall require a taxi for seven at six-thirty.”
“Six-thirty, miss?” Dogger asked, his brow furrowed.
“Of course,” Aunt Felicity said. “He’ll have to make two trips. I expect you and Mrs. Mullet would both have your noses out of joint if you were left behind. Puppet shows are not just for bluebloods, you know.”"|"The Weed That Strings the Hangman's Bag"|"Alan Bradley"
"ap 06:40"|"TWENTY minutes to seven"|"CLARENCE PULLED UP AT THE LYCH-GATE AT TWENTY minutes to seven. He came round the taxicab to hold the door open for Aunt Felicity, who had insisted on sitting in the front seat with him in order to, as she put it, “keep a sharp eye out for road hogs.”"|"The Weed That Strings the Hangman's Bag"|"Alan Bradley"
"ap 06:40"|Six-forty|"“Six-forty,” I said, “on the dot. With my family. In a taxicab. Clarence Mundy’s taxicab.”"|"The Weed That Strings the Hangman's Bag"|"Alan Bradley"
00:00|midnight|"Ned earned £7 a week doing chores for Tully Stoker at the Thirteen Drakes, and he was smitten with, among others, my sister Ophelia. Even though he had accompanied Tully’s daughter, Mary, to Jack and the Beanstalk last night, it had not kept him from leaving his midnight love token on our doorstep, as an adoring tomcat drops a mouse at its owner’s feet."|"The Weed That Strings the Hangman's Bag"|"Alan Bradley"

The coroner recorded a verdict of Death by Misadventure, and expressed his sympathy to the bereaved parents."|"The Weed That Strings the Hangman's Bag"|"Alan Bradley"
12:00|noon|"Although I had a sketchy idea of what went on between two people having an affair, I did not actually know the precise mechanical details. Once, when Father had gone away for several days to a stamp exhibition in Glasgow, Daffy had insisted upon reading Madame Bovary aloud to us at every meal, morning, noon, and night, including tea, and finished on the third day just as Father was walking in the door."|"The Weed That Strings the Hangman's Bag"|"Alan Bradley"
"ap 07:25"|"twenty-five past seven"|"“It was twenty-five past seven. We had the tea laid on for eight o’clock, and it takes those big electric urns a long time to come to the boil.

00:00|midnight|"It reminded me, oddly enough, of something I had experienced the previous year when Father had taken Ophelia, Daphne, and me up to London for midnight mass at the Brompton Oratory. At the elevation of the Host, as the priest held the round white wafer (which some of us believed to be the Body of Christ) above his head for an inordinately long time, it had for just an instant caught the light from the candles and the colored reflections of the chancel, glowing with an unearthly iridescent sheen that was neither solid nor vaporous. At the time, it had seemed to me a signal that something momentous was about to happen."|"The Weed That Strings the Hangman's Bag"|"Alan Bradley"
