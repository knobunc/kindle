02:30|Vigils|"Isolation produces such effects. She’d trained for them during the God’s Gardeners Vigils and Retreats. The floating orange triangle, the talking crickets, the writhing columns of vegetation, the eyes in the leaves. Still, how to distinguish between such illusions and the real thing?"|"The Year of the Flood"|"Margaret Atwood"
"~ 00:00"|"Around midnight"|"Around midnight, and after a few wrong turns — the streets in Big Box looked so much alike — she reached her parents’ former house. No lights were on, the door to the garage was open, and the plate-glass window at the front was smashed, so she didn’t think anyone was in there. The current occupants were either dead or elsewhere. It was the same with the identical house next door, the one where the rifle was buried."|"The Year of the Flood"|"Margaret Atwood"
12:00|"noon that same day"|"At noon that same day, Blanco ordered Toby to his office. He sent his two pals with the message. They walked on either side of her, just in case she might get flighty ideas. As they went along the street, the heads turned. Toby felt she was on the way to her own execution. Why hadn’t she quit when she had the chance?"|"The Year of the Flood"|"Margaret Atwood"
"ap ~ 07:00"|"Around seven o’clock"|"When I’m thinking back over that night — the night the Waterless Flood first began — I can’t recall anything out of the ordinary. Around seven o’clock I was feeling hungry, so I got a Joltbar from the minifridge and ate half of it. I only ever ate half of anything because a girl with my body type can’t afford to blimp up. I once asked Mordis if I should get bimplants, but he said I could play underage in a dim light, and there was heavy demand for the schoolgirl act."|"The Year of the Flood"|"Margaret Atwood"
12:00|noontime|"During the heat of the day, she naps. Trying to stay awake through the noontime steambath is a waste of energy."|"The Year of the Flood"|"Margaret Atwood"
02:30|Vigils|"Pilar and Toby carried Zeb over to the Fallows Recovery Hut on the northwest corner of the Rooftop, which was used by Gardeners on Vigils, or those emerging from a Fallow state, or those who were moderately ill. As they were helping him to lie down, Rebecca came out from the enclosed shed at the back of the Rooftop, carrying a stack of dishtowels. “Now who did that?” she said. “That’s a glass job! Bottle fight?”"|"The Year of the Flood"|"Margaret Atwood"
02:30|Vigils|"Toby thought. “I’d be honoured,” she said at last. “But I can’t accept. To be a full-fledged Eve … it would be hypocritical.” She’d never managed to repeat the moment of illumination she’d felt on her first day with the Gardeners, though she’d tried often enough. She’d gone on the Retreats, she’d done an Isolation Week, she’d performed the Vigils, she’d taken the required mushrooms and elixirs, but no special revelations had come to her. Visions, yes, but none with meaning. Or none with any meaning she could decipher."|"The Year of the Flood"|"Margaret Atwood"
02:30|Vigils|"For the site of her Vigil, Toby chose the tomato section of the Edencliff Rooftop Garden. She posted the site on the Vigil sign-in slate, as required: those on Vigils sometimes went wandering away, and in tracing them it was helpful to know where they were supposed to have been."|"The Year of the Flood"|"Margaret Atwood"
05:00|"five in the morning"|"In the holding room we sat on a black vinyl sofa. It was five in the morning. Lucerne picked up a magazine — NooSkins, it said on the cover. Why Live With Imperfection? She riffled through it."|"The Year of the Flood"|"Margaret Atwood"
"ap < 01:00"|"near one"|"There was a lot of trash cluttering the streets — burnt things, broken things. Not only cars and trucks. Glass — a lot of that. Shackie said we had to be careful which buildings we went into: they’d been right near one when it collapsed. We should stay away from the tall ones because the fires could have eaten away at them, and if the glass windows fell on you, goodbye head. It would be safer in a forest than in a city now. Which was the reverse of what people used to think."|"The Year of the Flood"|"Margaret Atwood"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"“Let’s see your blister,” she says to Ren. It’s not a blister yet. She tears a strip off her top-to-toe, winds it around Ren’s foot. The sun’s at ten. They put on their top-to-toes and Toby smears their faces with more SolarNix, then sprays them again with SuperD."|"The Year of the Flood"|"Margaret Atwood"
12:00|noon|"It’s noon when we reach the old Tree of Life parkette. The plastic swings are gone, but the cobb house is the same — even the spraypainted pleeb tags are there — except they’ve been building onto it. There’s a fence made of poles and planks and wire and a lot of duct tape. Croze opens the gate, and the sheep go in and file towards a pen in the yard."|"The Year of the Flood"|"Margaret Atwood"
12:00|noon|"We walk and walk; at noon we stop to eat. Toby’s listening all the time: too many birdcalls of the wrong kind, such as crows — or else no bird calls at all — means Look out, she says. But all we’re hearing is background cheeping and chirping. “Bird wallpaper,” says Toby."|"The Year of the Flood"|"Margaret Atwood"
12:00|mid-day|"After the mid-day heat and the thunderstorm I went back to the beach for our packsacks and brought them to the clearing, along with some wild mustard greens I’d found along the way. Toby took out her cooking pot, and the cups, and her knife, and her big spoon. Then she made soup with the leftovers from the rakunk and the rest of Rebecca’s meat, some of her dried botanicals. When she put the bones of the rakunk into the water she spoke the words of apology and asked for its pardon."|"The Year of the Flood"|"Margaret Atwood"
02:30|Vigils|"This then is the Serpent Wisdom we long for — this wholeness of Being. May we greet with joy the few moments when, through Grace, and by the aid of our Retreats and Vigils and the assistance of God’s Botanicals, we are granted an apprehension of it."|"The Year of the Flood"|"Margaret Atwood"
"ap 01:00"|one|"But these resources are now exhausted, and we must either move or starve. Let us pray that the outer world is Exfernal no more — that the Waterless Flood has cleansed as well as destroyed, and that all the world is now a new Eden. Or, if it is not a new Eden yet, that it will be one soon. Or so we trust."|"The Year of the Flood"|"Margaret Atwood"
12:00|noonday|"May God deliver us from the snare of the fowler, and cover us with his feathers, and under his wings may we trust, as it says in Psalm 91; and thou shalt not be afraid of the pestilence that walketh in darkness, nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday."|"The Year of the Flood"|"Margaret Atwood"
