Waiting on the shoreline, Victoria looked back a couple of times and found it comforting to touch the inside-the-pant holster that nestled her Tula-Tokarev, 7.62mm semi-automatic pistol. Her husband boarded the boat and found, to port and starboard, resting lengthwise on the boards for oarsmen and passengers to sit, two eight-foot-long oars. He sat with his back to the bow, hauled the duffel bag in, and waved Victoria to come over.

The din of the twin outboards was bearable until, at 10:54, they were thrown against their seats as “the baby took off.” Lights were then turned out. The ensuing uproar, vibration, and occasional jumps as the patrol boat bounced over waves were too much for Victoria. She threw up the water she had drank and added some of her bodily fluids.

A first application of complete fertilizer two weeks earlier had given a very healthy blue-green color to the four-to five-inch-high St. Augustine grass. The gasoline-powered engine coughed into life, and the gardener proceeded to mow the lawn down to three inches, at the front of the house first, the courtyard later. It was 10:25 when he rode the lawn mower back into the trailer. Bonis left the cut grass on the ground, but blew back to the lawn those clippings that had fallen on the slate path at the front, and by the granite path, cemented area, and tiled poolside floor in the courtyard."|"Comrades in Miami"|"Jose Latour"

He pulled on a pair of gloves and began moving young plants grown in four-inch pots from the van to the courtyard. He also took a drain spade, a warren hoe, and a half-full bag of fertilizer, then called for the front yard’s irrigation to be turned off. Flower beds of butterfly bush, coreopsis, lion’s ear, hibiscus, plumbago, and ruelia graced Maria’s garden with shades of blue, lilac, yellow, orange, red, pink, and violet. On his knees, Bonis started replanting the flower beds with young plants. Soon he was drenched in sweat. His nimble hands occasionally plucked weeds out of the ground and dead leaves off shrubs.
