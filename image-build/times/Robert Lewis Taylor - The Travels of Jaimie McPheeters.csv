My father brought it up toward noon; he had just remembered it. It was lucky for us he did, because two cousins of my mother’s New Orleans plantation clan had died of cholera when she was small, and you only had to mention that disease for her to get the nervous jumps."|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"
08:00|"8 A.M."|"Now, your first shock over, I shall try to describe what happened in such detail as will make it all clear. As you know, Willie delivered us in the rig to Portland; dawn was breaking as we arrived. The boat I’d booked stateroom passage on, the Courier—a packet for St. Louis—was lying in the canal, though far from ready to go, despite the advertised sailing time of 8 A.M. It was nearer 11 when our cargo was aboard and the plank taken in. You may imagine what a fever of anxiety I generated during this delay; we alternated between disposing our luggage in the astonishingly small cabin assigned us (a mere closet, with wooden bunks one above the other, next to the ladies’ quarters in the stern) and pacing the upper deck, myself watching the communicating roads, as the morning wore on."|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"
"< 00:00"|"nearly midnight"|"This, Melissa, brings me to the time of our personal sorrow, the disappearance of Jaimie, and it is a sore trial for my hand to form the words. The hour was nearly midnight when Streeter went to his reward in the wheelhouse of the Courier, with Jaimie among the horrified onlookers peering through the glass. The accident had occurred at nine, as he and I were preparing to leave for bed. When finally we got into our bunks, we were, I am sure, distressed and wakeful. I fell into a sleep disturbed by visions of that grotesque shape in the paddle wheel (some of Streeter’s clothes were even torn from his body, such was the violence of the blades) and I awoke early, at the first streaks of sunrise. I sensed rather than noticed that Jaimie was not in his bunk. Springing down, I verified that this was the case, and with agitated heart, flung on some clothes and searched the deck, thinking to surprise him in an early morning stroll. He was nowhere to be seen. Frantically, now, I rushed through the ship—into the saloon, the engine room—room by courtesy only; it was all but exposed to the elements—through the lower deck, and at last to the Captain’s cabin. We combed the ship; he was gone."|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"

Off in the woods somewhere, I could hear an ax ring, a regular chunking, with now and then rests in between. It must have been seven o’clock; the sun had just blinked out above the tree line, looking as though it had maybe arisen too early, and didn’t feel quite up to scratch."|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"

In the afternoon we carried down the saplings, and he loaded me up till my knees buckled, after which he kept asking me boneheaded things like: “Tired?” “Wears you out, does it?” and “Appear to be much of a heft?”"|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"
"< 12:00"|"toward noon"|"Getting on toward noon, we stopped to eat, and I learned some more about the party. About the first thing that turned up was that the old gentleman, who went by the name of John, claimed to be John Murrel, the pirate and outlaw. I was acquainted with this Murrel, or leastways with the real article. He had been written up in a paper-backed book I’d got off a shantyboater for two stringy rabbits from my traps. According to the reports, he had ended up by going around trying to coax all the slaves to rise up against their masters and kill them with axes and hoes, upon which he would run a “southern empire,” with whiskey and women for all. It might have worked, too, but one of his partners named Steward told on him, and the people around Natchez charged forward and placed Murrel in jail, where they hoped he would be less of a nuisance. After that they had a kind of picnic, going overboard on the other side, as reformers generally do, and hung all his friends, and some of his acquaintances, and several strangers, including a number who were just passing through, and wound up by flogging everybody else in sight. Then they called it a good day and said they wished they had a conspiracy to put down more often."|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"
"< 12:00"|"toward noon"|"Getting on toward noon we came to a sizable stream that ran into the Mississippi, which I heard them call the Maremack, or sounds to that effect, and it had a rude log bridge over a narrow part, with a toll gate. An angular man wearing a straw hat and a pair of corduroy jeans with one gallus busted got up off a bench, a foot or so at a time, and said, “Howdy.” His face was neither friendly nor unfriendly; he just waited. Leaning against his bench was a rickety old squirrel gun."|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"

So he told the jury to be sure and avoid prejudice one way or the other, and not let Slater’s ratty appearance tell against him, but only consider the evidence, and that in the sight of God, Slater and a man like Pierre Chouteau were equal, and when they were born you couldn’t tell one from the other.

But before we did, we made an agreement to all travel together to California in the same company, because Mrs. Kissel said they’d admire to have Jennie along, just like one of the family. I haven’t the least doubt they’d have taken in five more without a word of objection, for that’s the way they were. There wasn’t anything small or selfish about them any more than there is about an elephant."|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"

03:00|"3 A.M."|"We rolled out of bed at 3 A.M., caught up the oxen, hitched, and had breakfast, squatting around the fire, still in the deep dark. We always had firewood laid out from the night before, and the women made breakfast in silence, feeling a little poorly and not quite up to snuff, the way women do in the mornings. It was best to leave them alone. Jennie was apt to snap your head off, and even Mrs. Kissel took on a kind of mournful note, which was aimed at the general misery of being a woman, I judged, and not centered on any one person like her husband. So the smartest thing was to let them pitch in and work; it’s my observation that nothing’s as handy for taking the kinks out of a woman as work."|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"
03:00|"3 A.M."|"It was a fresh, clear morning with the stars out in smears and clusters. Off in the distance you could hear animals barking, coyotes or wolves, and the oxen stamped around, lowing, ready to move. It felt good to be a boy and off adventuring. I remember eating an uncommon lot that morning, and I’m glad I did, for it turned out to be an unusual day, and required strength. As my father finished his one-man conversation—he was always bubbling over at 3 A.M., in the gabbiest of spirits, but since nobody else cared to talk, he just rattled on alone—Coulter rode by on his Indian pony to see that we squashed our fire. “Get it out—every last ember,” he called from the saddle. “Rain’s been scarce and you’ve never lived till you’ve seen a prairie fire on the roar.”"|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"

McBride was nowhere to be seen. It was about four-thirty now, and a few pale streaks, the false dawn, showed in the East where the real dawn was about to break. Looking back, I could see one or two wagons with lanterns out, where people were sick, maybe; but mostly it was dark."|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"I looked all around. Jennie was bossing Mrs. Kissel, Brice dozed in the sun on his wagon seat, and my father was up ahead gathering prairie peas that the women made pickles of, to ward off scurvy. All was clear. Now at eight o’clock the train already was moving in the slow bend that Coulter said would continue all day, so at the first dry creek bed, I slipped off, looking, I hoped, like I was searching for a handy place to go to the outhouse."|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"
"< 00:00"|"nearly midnight"|"Dark came down like a curtain, and now I was stuck. Still, I could see a little by the early stars, so I plodded on, singing and talking to discourage the wolves. It must have been nearly midnight—I was getting giddy with tiredness—when I saw a glow of campfires up ahead. I gave a shout, remembered to say my prayers of thankfulness, and broke into a run, my knees buckling at every piece of uneven ground."|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"
"ap ~ 01:00"|"About one o’clock"|"On the morning of the storm the wind blew high, though it was nothing more in effect than a hot blast of temperature. About one o’clock, however, strange meteoric appearances began to present themselves to the north (the opposite point to that from which the wind blew), gradually becoming more widespread and livid; when suddenly a small black speck emerged from the horizon, and, with the quickness of thought, the wind ran round to that quarter, increasing to a perfect hurricane, scattering hats, laundry, and clothing, and detaching the odometer which trails from the wagon of a Mr. Meeker, to check our daily mileage. Several of the wagon covers were rent to shreds, one vehicle was turned clear over, and the unhitched stock, being badly scattered, went galloping about, snorting and puffing, and keeping us busily engaged for some while to look after them. The din and confusion, the mingled screams of the ladies, and the terrified cries from the cattle—were past describing. To add to our dismay, a kettle of coals in the overturned wagon ignited the underwood, and a lake of flame spread out, threatening to engulf one and all in its depths. By good fortune, the rain, which came in erratic torrents, soon extinguished this, and we managed to pick ourselves up and regroup."|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"
10:00|"ten o’clock in the morning"|"Dead cattle were strewn along here thick enough to walk on like steppingstones. And we came to mounds of thrown-out beans and bacon and flour, and every utensil you could name, including pots and pans and a ten-gallon water cask. I wondered how much had come from our train, up there ahead, and how much from others. The first pile of bacon we came on, these potbellied Indians hove to and organized a feast. It wasn’t more than ten o’clock in the morning, but they dug in as if they hadn’t eaten for a week. The bacon was spoiled to the point where it was kind of slippery, and the stench would have frightened a polecat, but that made no difference to these fellows. They grabbed up pieces—soapy lumps, rather—and stuffed them in, and a good many ate the beans, entirely raw. I’ve seen some vomity sights among Indians since, particularly with the Utes, which live on a caterpillar mash, and the Diggers, which will eat anything as long as it’s filthy, but these Pawnees fighting the flies for that bacon topped everything."|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"

In spite of some night marauding they do—horse-stealing, camp-raiding and such—an Indian isn’t any account before dawn, on account of the spirits.

Suddenly there came a dreadful shout—it was a man of our company, a taciturn and bearded drover, who, in the act of leading his horse to the stream, had come upon a very shocking scene. Unable to proceed, he froze in his spot, then voiced the shout previously mentioned. We—Kissel, and some others and I, including Coe, who is now a friend—rushed to his side and stared in the direction he was pointing. Below, on all fours in the mud, snapping, uttering sounds of a sighing or sobbing character, enough like the baying of a dog to make the hairs rise on one’s neck-was our Mr. Kennedy. He was in the throes of virulent rabies, or hydrophobia, the dread disease in full career.

These were regathered laboriously, Coulter encouraging the process with refreshing examples of his peculiar idiom. As to our wagons, they completed the trip with smoothness, though in the struggle for footing the oxen were pushed to their last extremity, their sides sobbing with distress. We had taken the precaution to caulk both beds with calico strips and lampwick, but the water bubbled on in. By good fortune it was warm, not at all displeasing to the touch. Toward noon a hullabaloo was raised when someone pointed downstream to a sand bar where lay the body of a middle-aged man. After a head count, we agreed that he was none of our group. But only a few minutes later we observed Jaimie swimming stoutly toward the bar; hallooing brought no response. He was seen to clamber out, kneel, then make his way to the far shore. He returned with a purse carrying the identification of one Edwin Lorch, of Prairie du Rocher, Illinois, and said that the clothing was heavily freighted with sand, so that the victim must have stepped in a sink hole, only to be spewed back later."|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"

As senior physician present, I gave a lecture on health, advising a low diet and cooling aperients, stating in addition that I had decided against bleeding, and suggesting that those ill suck linen rags soaked in vinegar. Green goggles were found for a few suffering from opthalmic irritation of dust and sun, and cambric mouth veils were provided for those with coughs. I concluded with advices on bathing: Cleanliness and frequent baths, I said, are your best preventives of sickness, but I cautioned against bathing if fatigued and recommended as the best hour for this exercise around nine or ten in the morning; one is stronger then than at other times of day. My further directions were, heed not the coldness of the water if it is soft; and after leaving the water, begin an active rubbing with a coarse towel, until a reaction takes place in the skin; dress rapidly, drink a long draught of pure water, and commence a smart walk until perspiration ensues; then cool gradually and fix the mind on subjects of pleasant good cheer."|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"

Then he raised up and said he was dying. He looked so white and sober I believed it, too. So I got the girl and we talked it over pretty fast. She knelt over him, and looked confused. “Don’t worry,” I said. “It isn’t your fault. The medicine’s taken him wrong—it does that sometimes. I’d better go for Doctor Merton.” I was back in ten minutes, but I must say that this Dr. Merton appeared to be in a poor humor, and said he hoped it wasn’t any kind of joke; he’d be obliged “to make representations in the proper quarter.”"|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"

A man whose name I’ve forgotten with a wooden leg played the fiddle, and played it very well, too, and some of the women had baked a real winner of a cake, with what they called “matrimonial devices” on top. They handed it around; each person got a piece, even the children."|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"

When Mrs. Kissel said, “If you think it over, it wasn’t nothing but furniture,” her husband added, in a rare burst of speech, “If a man’s got an ax, he’s got furniture.” Then he added, as an afterthought, “And I’ve got an ax.” He was right about that.

Benson, a dry, practical-looking man with sandy hair, wearing steel spectacles, who at first said there was no rental space to be had in any dwelling. Then he advised us to return later, as he was occupied in forming a committee, together with the Prophet, to carry out certain town road projects. Though not personable in the English social, or charm, sense, Benson appeared unhostile and even helpful within his limits. He is an earnest, able man, and his descendants, Mormon or “Gentile,” will make their mark in the America of the future. Before we left, he informed us that a large room in the southeast corner of the State House has been converted to an eating establishment for the accommodation of emigrants and laborers on the public works, to be called the Deseret Boarding House, where one may obtain a meal of milk, bread, butter, radishes, onions, and slaw for a few pennies.

Thank you.” An Elder Bullock had married a young couple named Throgmorton during the week, and afterward supped on green peas. The Council of Health would meet Wednesdays hereafter, and give advice gratis, from 3 to 4 P.M. The Utes were getting uppity again and had attacked a Snake village nearby, burning six lodges. It looked as if they might have to be punished some more. The Stake of Zion in the Sandwich Islands was prospering, according to the latest report of Apostle Parley B. Pratt there, and soon would be sending Hawaiian converts to Salt Lake City. As to the Stakes in Europe, converts were piled up in those countries—specially England and Wales—by the hundreds of thousands, waiting to come to America. Thirty-five thousand were said to be collected at Liverpool alone. The slave trade on the African coast was very brisk just now, the average price of souls on the current market being thirty-two dollars. Thursday evening a concert would be held at the Tithing and Post Onice, “when we shall endeavor to introduce a variety of sentimental and comic pieces which will be new to the people of Deseret generally, together with some original pieces.

The day before the party arrived, one of the emigrants took a child of about four years of age in bed with him, and devoured the whole before morning; and the next day ate another about the same age before noon.”"|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"
"ap ~ 07:30"|"about half-past seven o’clock"|"“While we were in the habit at night of turning the water through the tail race, I used to go down in the morning to see what had been done through the night; and about half-past seven o’clock on or about the 19th of January—I am not quite certain to a day, but it was between the 18th and 20th of that month—1848, I went down as usual, and after shutting off the water from the race I stepped into it, near the lower end, and there, upon the rock, about six inches beneath the surface of the water, I DISCOVERED THE GOLD. I was entirely alone at the time. I picked up one or two pieces and examined them attentively; and having some general knowledge of minerals, I could not call to mind more than two which in any way resembled this—sulphuret of iron, very bright and brittle; and gold, bright yet malleable; I then tried it between two rocks, and found that it could be beaten into a different shape, but not broken. Four days afterwards I went to the Fort for provisions, and carried with me about three ounces of the gold, which Capt. Sutter and I tested with nitric acid. I then tried it in Sutter’s presence by taking three silver dollars and balancing them by the dust in the air, then immersed both in water, and the superior weight of the gold satisfied us both of its nature and value.”"|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"
12:00|noon|"But we got busy, on fire to drive ahead, and dug one hole after another. Most had nothing; every fifth or sixth turned up a few bits like the first ones, say as big as very small gravel. These we tucked away in our sack. Some of the washings were little more than dust, not positively gold, but we dumped it in, anyhow, whatever failed to wash out with the dirt and stones. By noon we had what they estimated was better than an ounce, net, which meant that, with gold bringing sixteen dollars an ounce, we’d made about twenty dollars. This wasn’t bad; but as my father said toward late afternoon, when the pickings were growing slim, we’d done a square day’s work for it. Also, with prices the way they were, we wouldn’t pile up much of a backlog at this rate."|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"
12:00|noon|"“Par-don,” he said, and held out a note, which my father read aloud, after fixing on his spectacles. “ ‘If it suits, tomorrow at noon, épée, no bandages, à outrance, at the glade by what is known as Hawkins’ Oak.’ ”"|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"
00:00|midnight|"We made a gloomy supper of it, all but Mr. Coe, who was somewhat more cheerful than usual. But the rest of us were low in our minds, with Mrs. Kissel and Jennie and even Po-Povi sniffling a little now and then, and it took me a poison long time to get to sleep. Way off in the late hours—it must have been midnight—I heard whispering in the Kissel tent, and presently Mr. Kissel crept out, all dressed."|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"
"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"“I’m glad you didn’t get away,” said my father, “though I must admit it’s tempting. Let’s go back to bed. Maybe something will happen before noon.”"|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"At eleven o’clock, Mr. Coe said, “Well, then,” and stood up. He’d been sitting on a log reading from a book of poems to Po-Povi, who sat looking down in silence. “We’d better be getting along.”"|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"
12:00|noon|"When we reached camp, they were getting ready for the noon meal, with my father and Mr. Kissel fanning away at the fire, coughing as they always did, and the women bustling around with the cooking. I stepped up and said, “These here are some friends from back on the trail in Missouri—the boy named Todd was the one I was telling you about, and this is his Uncle Ned.”"|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"
12:00|noon|"We had a good dinner, eating our best meal at noon on a Sunday, and had compone, fat bacon, boiled beef, pickled pork, and salad that Jennie and Po-Povi picked in the woods. I never saw a man eat so. And the boy did the same. They were starved down to a point where they were just barely moving and that’s all. Every few minutes the man made an apology for “gormandizing” and tackled another plateful. He must have laid in twelve pounds, more or less."|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"
"ap < 03:00"|"toward three o’clock"|"And afterwards, by George if he didn’t insist on washing up, he and the boy. They wouldn’t let the women touch a thing, shooed everybody right out to the chairs Mr. Kissel had made, and then I’m blessed if they didn’t light in and chop about half a cord of firewood. When they finished, toward three o’clock, Uncle Ned came up to Mrs. Kissel with his hat in his hand and said:"|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"
12:00|noon|"He seemed embarrassed and said, “Here lately, we’ve had tan-bark coffee in the morning, et bacon and greens at noon, and munched acorns for the rest. It serves, but it’s right hard to work on.”"|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"
"ap < 04:00"|"toward four o’clock"|"We were prospering, much better than mining, but one afternoon Coulter and I went into Vernon to get a fresh jug of spring water from a tap owner that bought our meat. When we got inside his place, toward four o’clock of an October day that had a nice blue crackle to it, there was sitting at a table not only the mangy pair from Missouri that had swindled us, but John and Shep besides. They looked prosperous, and meaner than Hades, but John’s eyes suggested that if he wasn’t outright insane by now, he was very close to it. They were drinking grog. The woman didn’t look sickly at all now, but was spruced up and being very friendly with Shep, which didn’t appear to put her husband in a better humor."|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"
"ap > 05:00"|"just after five"|"I kicked off my shoes and clipped out down the road. It was just after five; there were a few miners weaving around in the path, but I made good time. When our shop came in view, I could see them staring at me, and when I stumbled up, fighting for breath, Jennie ran out."|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"
00:00|midnight|"This far down, the river was strongly affected by tide, so we went aground around about dark, but the tide floated us off by midnight, and we kept right on booming, it being moonlight, bright and clear."|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"“When do you expect to come in for mail again?”
“I’ll call at ten tomorrow.”
“Thank you, sir,” said the clerk, and scribbled a memorandum on the note he had."|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"Out early to have breakfast in a coffeehouse, and killed time till ten, when we went back to the post office. There wasn’t any more mail, of course, but the clerk seemed glad to see us, and said, “The gentleman was here only a moment ago. I believe he will make himself—”"|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"
"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"They said the climate here was unlike any other about, being entirely local. During the summer and fall, the wind blew from the west or northwest, directly in from the ocean. Then the mornings were warm and calm, but around noon, as a general thing, the ocean wind lifted to a regular gale, driving dust and paper and filth over the streets so thick you had to shield your eyes. And always, at sunset, it died away to nothing, leaving a time of peaceful quiet. The early evenings were pleasant but after dark it turned so cool you could wear woolen clothing nearly any old time you chose. In the winter, they said, there was nothing but soft, gentle breezes from the southeast, with temperatures always mild, the thermometer rarely sinking below 50."|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"Well, he had a fair-sized crowd, mostly hecklers, and he said, just as I find it in the Journals, “Gentlemen, I’m no croaker. I’m not here to bind and chafe, or make injudicious attacks on Romanism. I’ve been preaching regularly in the streets for more than ten years, seven of them among California gamblers and rum-sellers. Now I’d like to call your attention to the difference between a decent, well-behaved sinner and a violent, outbreaking sinner. Gentlemen, I stand on what I suppose to be a cask of brandy. Keep it bunged and spiled, and it is entirely harmless; nay, it answers some very good purposes; it even makes a good pulpit. But draw that spile and fifty men will be down here to drink up its spirit and wallow in the gutter, and before ten o’clock tonight will carry sorrow and desolation to the hearts of fifty families. A case in point is a congregation man we had at the Powell Street Methodist Church, a previous sinner, black as tar, with a history to shame a cutthroat criminal. But he’d heard the sweet word of Jesus, through your humble servant, and he straightened up like a sergeant, though his tripes burned for rum as a wolf ravens after gore—”"|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"
"ap ~ 01:00"|"around one o’clock"|"Right on schedule the next evening, while we were eating bread and molasses and two cups of chocolate we’d bought off a ship, Reverend Ebersohl appeared with our laundry. It was done up in a neat bundle and tied with a string. My father paid him elaborate thanks and persuaded him to share the chocolate, then take a piece of bread. But he said he’d consumed a very hearty meal around one o’clock, of “forest greens,” meaning grass, I reckon, and goat’s milk, but would try to choke down a bite to be courteous. Then he took a snap, though perfectly mannerly, at that bread and it disappeared from the public view forever. Watching him carefully, my father said, “Reverend, what happens to the money you take up in collecting?”"|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"
12:00|"noon that day"|"At noon that day we got a drayman to cart the stand down to the Square, and my father made a sign: “McPheeters and Ebersohl, Sundries.” We only had about a dollar, but we sunk this in tea, also bought off a boat, and for two days I tended stand while my father harrowed for pay on the streets, so as to buy stock."|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"We had to stop and serve figs and molasses and sassafras tea to four English sailors off a ship in the harbor. They said both their food and water had turned weevily, and their teeth were loose in their heads from scurvy. It was close on to six o’clock."|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"The fire broke out on the east side of the Square; before eight o’clock it had wiped out the four main gambling halls, and one of the biggest boardinghouses. By afternoon the Square was, as the paper said next day, reduced to ashes except for two houses of 72-foot frontage at the southwest comer and a solitary brick house at the northeast corner. That wind did zip along! From Washington Street down to Montgomery, all leveled off—gambling houses, stores, residences, everything. Sparks and burning cloth swept over the Plaza on a level line close to the ground, like a blizzard of snow, and you had to look sharp to keep from getting your clothes afire. My father wrote in his Journals: “It was an awful and sublime scene. The smoke made the brilliant sun as though seen through a piece of black bottle glass.”"|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"
"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"I guess it was around noon, with the sky all dark that way and burning bits swirling past, when we thought about the stand. I don’t know why it hadn’t occurred to us before, except that our things were a hundred yards away from the main area of flames. But when we got there, the tent was all but gone and the stand was on fire in three places. We kicked it over, and my father snatched up his bag, but we couldn’t stamp out the flames. A big piece of burning calico—a ceiling from somewhere, likely—had blown against it, giving it a very good start. We’d lost everything except the clothes we stood up in, but they included my father’s new suit, thanks to goodness."|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"

Seeing his duty to be removed for a while from San Francisco, devil or no devil, he had worked his way upriver by manual toil, and walked or ridden wagon trains as far as the ranch. It would be hard to say just how glad we were to see him. Sitting on the Kissels’ porch after supper—Coulter and Jennie and Uncle Ned and Todd and the Kissels—Reverend Ebersohl forgot he was a preacher for a while. He even drank a glass of wine; I couldn’t have been more staggered if he’d hung up a notice praising the devil. Then he sat talking about my father until midnight. I’d never heard him make so much sense; he said the old things, but he said them well."|"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"|"Robert Lewis Taylor"
