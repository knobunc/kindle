"ap 05:00"|five|"I was still on the phone at five, checking with people who’d helped make calls. The line went dead almost on the second by the master clock. That was it. I rubbed my face and said a little prayer."|Arslan|"M. J. Engh"
"ap 05:30"|five-thirty|"After the five-thirty deadline no more blankets were accepted, though a few more people showed up with them. Maud Dollfus organized teams of seventh- and eighth-grade boys to carry supper trays to the classrooms. (She was about to use the girls from her home ec classes, till I told her I wasn’t going to have girls running around with the halls full of soldiers.) It was a slow way to feed three hundred children, but keeping them out of the way was worth a little inefficiency."|Arslan|"M. J. Engh"
"ap 06:00"|"Six o’clock"|"Six o’clock came and went, and I felt my stomach tighten as the hand of the clock moved past that curfew mark.

Besides, the supper business was keeping me busy. We finished a little before seven-thirty. I was eating my own meal at last when a certain stir among the soldiers told me Arslan was coming back. He carried a sphere of motion and excitement around him. I knew the phenomenon very well. We didn’t see it so often in grade school, but it happened every few years in high school, whenever the basketball team had a star player who inspired the rest of the kids with pride instead of envy. There was exactly that feeling obvious in the looks of the Turkistanis; wherever Arslan went was where the action was."|Arslan|"M. J. Engh"

"ap > 09:00"|"past nine o’clock"|"The street lights weren’t on, though it was past nine o’clock. None of the soldiers wandering in the darkness paid much attention to me. As an experiment, I turned west past my house—almost anything was worth a try—but I wasn’t surprised when a rifle turned me back."|Arslan|"M. J. Engh"
"ap 10:15"|ten-fifteen|"And that morning at ten-fifteen he had been in my office, saying, “Your people are entirely free,” with a face like a cat just wiping the feathers off of its mouth."|Arslan|"M. J. Engh"
"> 12:00"|"after noon"|"Neither Hunt nor Betty had been out of the rooms since they went in, except for one guarded trip each to the bathroom. That was after the one meal Luella had been allowed to fix for them, carried up on trays a while after noon by Arslan’s men. She hadn’t seen them; hadn’t heard any sounds out of the rooms since the screaming stopped, a little while before Arslan left that morning. He had come back around suppertime, eaten a big meal, and disappeared into the guestroom. Since then everything had been very quiet."|Arslan|"M. J. Engh"
"ap < 05:00"|"one hour to six"|"I took care of the real work of planning in my own bedroom. When I needed information from the Turkistani side, I went to Nizam. At first that meant a wait of anywhere from one hour to six on Frieda Althrop’s front porch, in full view of Pearl Street and the hardroad—and if Nizam didn’t have enough business on hand to keep me waiting that long, he would find some. As soon as that became clear, I quit waiting. If he wasn’t ready to see me when I got there, or within a few minutes, I went away and came back exactly two hours later. The longest streak of such visits we ever worked up to was a day and a half, with time out for a night’s sleep. After that, I never had to come back more than once, and those few occasions I was perfectly willing to put down to genuine business."|Arslan|"M. J. Engh"
"< 00:00"|"before midnight"|"By now I was well used to Nizam’s standard procedure. He accepted a sheaf of papers from me, shuffled it to the bottom of a stack and cleared his throat a little in preparation for English. He very seldom looked at me, except to deliver one of his venomous stares, and he didn’t look at me now. “You will extinguish the power plant before midnight twenty-four December,” he said."|Arslan|"M. J. Engh"
00:00|Midnight|"He nodded—at least I thought it was a nod—and shuffled the suspicious paper to the bottom of the stack. “Midnight twenty-four December,” he repeated. “You are dismissed.”"|Arslan|"M. J. Engh"
"< 12:00"|"Before noon"|"He contemplated his cigarette, while he constructed his clauses. “You will give me two lists. Of people to whom you wish to talk. Of things at which you wish to look. Before noon tomorrow.”"|Arslan|"M. J. Engh"
"ap > 10:00"|"A little past ten"|"I gave him his lists first thing in the morning. A little past ten he sent for me. Lieutenant Z and two soldiers were waiting in his office. “You will follow this route,” said Nizam, holding up a paper for me to take. He didn’t bother to look at me; after all, he’d glanced up when I came in. “You will return between noon and curfew, eighteen February. Dismissed.”"|Arslan|"M. J. Engh"
12:00|noon|"I gave him his lists first thing in the morning. A little past ten he sent for me.

"ap ~ 02:00"|"about two"|"We took down the fences. We climbed poles and took down the wires. We carted refrigerators. We ran regular wagon trains through the district all afternoon, picking up stuff. We tried to put ourselves in Nizam’s place and imagine what he had in mind (though that didn’t work entirely—one thing he had in mind was that at least part of whatever we decided would be wrong), and in cases of doubt we figured better safe than sorry. We also cached a few thousand feet of electrical wire, two generators, and about two bushels of assorted radio equipment."|Arslan|"M. J. Engh"
"~ 17:00"|"About five o’clock that afternoon"|"He had been gone since early morning, presumably into the next district west, the day Rusudan disappeared. About five o’clock that afternoon, she had started out for a stroll with two of her women. It was just turning dusk when they got back. She had sent the women upstairs, walked through the kitchen, picked up an apple, and stepped out the back door, and that was the last anybody had seen of her."|Arslan|"M. J. Engh"
"ap ~ 09:00"|"about nine o’clock"|"It must have been about nine o’clock when I heard the front door open after a period of quiet, and came downstairs to see a Turkistani sergeant frozen in a salute that Arslan did not return. The man’s face was blank and hard as a glazed brick. Arslan stood in front of the couch, his shoulders a little hunched and his eyes dogged. There was dead silence in the room."|Arslan|"M. J. Engh"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"It was already nine o’clock. Arslan was still in his room, where he’d had breakfast. Hunt was locked in. Luella had tried to take him some breakfast, too, but the soldiers wouldn’t let her get near the door. She thought Arslan had forgotten about him. The women had fared better. A couple of them had been allowed to bring Sanjar down to eat, and Luella said they’d gone back with enough food for a week. Arslan had come out just long enough to claim Sanjar. The boy had been in his father’s room nearly two hours now."|Arslan|"M. J. Engh"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"So it was business as usual—but business with a difference. There was a kind of fury in Arslan’s actions, in his voice, his laugh, his stride. Every movement he made looked like a blow held back. He’d never wasted time before, but he’d never seemed pressed for it, either; he’d had the leisure to enjoy everything. Now, suddenly, he was in a hurry. Business as usual—but he plunged into that business with a very unusual fervor, burrowing his way into mountains of work that seemed to disintegrate under his attack and leave him unsatisfied, unprotected again. And after dark, pleasure as before; even beginning that first night, with Rusudan hardly cold in her grave under his window, he dove into the black sea of his old pastimes. He had his two bottles of vodka every night, and every night now he had to have a new girl. He wasn’t interested in the esthetic niceties of rape any longer; he took whatever the daily dragnet brought him. One of his lieutenants was in charge of picking up a new girl every day and getting rid of the used one. So day by day I saw a procession of the pretty kids who had been in second and third grades the last year of school, delivered and discarded like daily newspapers. A girl would be picked up sometime during the day, whenever the roving lieutenant spotted a likely prospect, and held at Nizam’s till evening. Then the lieutenant would escort her over to Arslan’s room, as forcibly as necessary. In the morning he was on duty from five o’clock, ready to whisk her away as soon as Arslan emerged and deposit her where he had found her."|Arslan|"M. J. Engh"
"ap 05:30"|five-thirty|"He had tortured nobody, unless it was Rusudan’s women—and they hadn’t looked any the worse for wear, physically. He had done it by simple, thorough detective work. In about thirty-six hours he and his men had questioned something like three thousand people, and (at least as important and a lot harder) found and compared the relevant answers. The questions had been very standardized and very few: Where were you between five-thirty and eight! What were you wearing! Whom did you see! What were they wearing! Meanwhile they had confiscated the shoes and clothes allegedly worn by every able-bodied man in the district that night. It was a massive job, but very effective if you had the manpower to do it fast and thoroughly. One of its virtues was that it touched everybody. It didn’t much matter whether Arslan’s conclusions were accurate or not, either. Kraft County had been impressed."|Arslan|"M. J. Engh"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"We had set the Saturday night for the Trick; but for insurance we would be ready to go the night before. There would be a few kids out on Friday night—closely followed by nervous parents—and a few more little ones on Saturday afternoon. At sundown the KCR would pass the word at top speed, and an immediate curfew would go into effect. At seven o’clock most of the troops would be eating supper; those on duty would be expecting to see people on the streets; Nizam would be in his lair; Arslan, if he followed his recent pattern, would already be in his room with a girl. At seven o’clock we would hit."|Arslan|"M. J. Engh"
00:00|midnight|"Yet, expectably, chance set me alone with Franklin after a late supper, Sanjar and Leila abed, Arslan and his bodyguard on some midnight errand, and nothing petty to talk about. “He’s changed,” Franklin said."|Arslan|"M. J. Engh"
02:30|matins|"It was not the first day, it was a near one, when the first question was thrust to me, and necessarily I had no answer. We were alone in Karcher’s woods (after the first hunt we were always alone, though two of his bodyguard waited, bored and smoking, in the jeep), and we were looking for deer. We made no kill that day; but in the dew and innocence of sunrise, on the heartbreaking plush of moss below the oaks and in the shelving shales and sandstones of the creekbanks, we tracked the spoor of a harem of whitetails. And while the dew exhaled and the gold sun undid the pink and grayness, and the mosquitoes gave way to gnats, and the birds bustled from matins into business, we tracked them slowly yet."|Arslan|"M. J. Engh"
00:00|midnight|"In that crowded, bustling house I lived alone and silent. The raucous poultry of the yard, the thick-tongued soldiery, alike confident of their validity, filled day and night with urgent communication. Betty—Miss Hanson to me before my promotion to auxiliary adulthood—emitted signals of agony and ecstasy from Arslan’s room. Mr. and Mrs. Bond communed conjugally, upon a band narrow but apparently clear. Cats wove their intricate society through the useful obstacles of humankind and its hounds. The monkey, sui generis, scratched his piglike skin and pattered forth rattling streams of helpless exhortation. Individuals addressed communications to me: Darya sang, in a language whose very sounds I never grasped; Mrs. Bond presented to me kindnesses, fruit pies, clean linen; Arslan’s soldiers delivered retailed orders and original mockery; Mr. Bond kindly preached; Arslan laid upon me his light hands, his heavy body, his intolerable informations. I did not respond. Only in certain roseate darknesses—the laughably, pitiably frail virginness of dawn, the dying violent power of sunset, the glory that attended midnight in Arslan’s sweated bed—did I speak, give answers, question, and then to Arslan alone. A certain mechanical heaviness invested otherwise my speech centers."|Arslan|"M. J. Engh"
12:00|midday|"In Bukhara, the music seemed miraculous to me, the machine no less so. Nightlong I would sit hunched beside it, touching my budding beard with small proxy caresses, while the floating tone-arm softly bobbed and gradually pivoted, spinning great ripples of sound from a flat black circle. The tremendous swag and sway of Verdi, the joyous patternings of Mozart, gave back to my memory now the odor of Arslan’s lust, now the concerned and disapproving eyes of Franklin L. Bond. In the morning there would be coffee, raucously strong; and at midday I would lie flat, spread-eagled on a blank bed, my teeth locked tight and fragments of arias furiously rotating through my brain."|Arslan|"M. J. Engh"
12:00|noonday|"I was teaching myself to see and hear in the dim world of the corn, as Arslan had taught me in the woods, and in the dazzling nights and colorless days of Bukhara. In the lion-colored noonday dusk of the corn, the eye lost itself. The brazen rustling had the very quality of silence. It was easy to drift in a hot, buzzing dream, down aisles cross-laced with ragged swords. But I was learning. So I heard, in the unresonant clangors that ran like muffled alarms through the corn with the changing breeze, a more purposeful rustle. I stood at gaze. Ahead, behind, the tall files closed in. The blades clashed. The bronze shadows crossed and waved. I walked on, stirring the blades carefully out of my way."|Arslan|"M. J. Engh"
04:00|"four in the night"|"Sanjar was right; it was ten days, almost to the hour. They had come through the kitchen window in the dawn of a Monday morning; and a week and a half later, a little before the dawn of the Thursday, they went quietly through the back door. Arslan brushed against me in the darkness, and I felt the heat of his lean body, still fired from the fourth bout of fever since he came. It had been a nervous ten days, but quiet. There were no alarms. He slept; slept night and day, apparently. Sanjar stood guard over him like a tame tiger. He ate. Maybe ten times a day and three or four in the night, Sanjar would materialize in the kitchen to carry away a bowl or plate full of the nourishing messes that Hunt continually stirred up. And in those ten days I never once saw Arslan. It was like having a ghost for a tenant. All the news of his progress came through Hunt from Sanjar. Hunt had washed and ironed Arslan’s clothes, such as they were—the threadbare blouse and pantaloons of a peon. Sanjar had washed his own, in stages, borrowing a pair of Hunt’s pants while his dried in the basement, belting them in to fit and rolling up the legs so that he looked like a boy playing pirate."|Arslan|"M. J. Engh"
"~ 14:00"|"about two in the afternoon"|"It must have been about two in the afternoon when a wagon pulled up in front of the house. I was working in the side garden—somebody had to do Hunt’s chores—and I straightened up to watch."|Arslan|"M. J. Engh"
12:00|noon|"“Clear up to the Wabash. Nearly far as Clairmont, I reckon. Spent most a month, if you can believe it, Mr. Bond. I mean if you count coming and going.” If he had had a hat, he would have taken it off now and turned it round and round in his hands. “And it was up there we seen Hunt Morgan. Riding that there red horse of his. I’d of knowed him and the horse both, five miles off. Seen him ride up to a little old house there was, one of them little summer houses some people used to build up there, and he waited there most near half a day till somebody come and met him. And you know who it was, Mr. Bond? A soldier. Yes, sir. One of Arslan’s soldiers, I’ll swear. He had the uniform and all. And they was talking there all evening from noon till clear up dark. We was watching the whole thing from the river bank, all day long, first to last. Then we seen them ride off again back the way they come, Hunt south and the soldier north. He wasn’t just no private, neither; he was some kind of a officer.”"|Arslan|"M. J. Engh"
"< 00:00"|"near midnight"|"Hunt woke near midnight. As soon as the fuzziness of the drug wore off enough for him to understand what had happened, he lashed out at us desperately. He was furious at the doctor for having put him to sleep, at me for having let Arslan be taken, at Sanjar for no logical reason. What really hurt him was that he couldn’t see Arslan and couldn’t help him. Their blood was incompatible."|Arslan|"M. J. Engh"
