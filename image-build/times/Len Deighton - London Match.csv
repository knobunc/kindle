20:00|"eight o'clock that evening"|"It was eight o'clock that evening in London when I finally delivered my report to my immediate boss, Dicky Cruyer, Controller German Stations. I'd attached a complete translation too, as I knew Dicky wasn't exactly bilingual."|"London Match"|"Len Deighton"
"< 22:00"|"nearly ten o'clock at night"|"It was nearly ten o'clock at night when they dragged the ambulance out of the Havel. It was a sorry sight, its side caked with oily mud where it had rested on the bottom of the river. One tyre was torn off and some of the bodywork ripped open where it had collided with the railings that were there to prevent such accidents."|"London Match"|"Len Deighton"
"ap 11:15"|eleven-fifteen|"By eleven-fifteen the police inspector declared the preliminary forensic examination complete. Although they'd put a number of oddments into clear-plastic evidence bags, nothing had been discovered that was likely to throw any light on the disappearance of Carol Elvira Miller, self-confessed Russian agent."|"London Match"|"Len Deighton"
"ap 02:30"|two-thirty|"By this time she'd noticed the smell of the mud on my clothes, and now she pushed her glasses into place so that she could see me more clearly. 'You're filthy, Bernd. Whatever have you been doing? 'Where have you been?' From her study there came the loud chimes of the ornate ormolu clock striking two-thirty."|"London Match"|"Len Deighton"
19:41|1941|"'Die Stunde Null,' said Lange. 'Germany's hour zero — I didn't need anyone to explain what that meant when I got here in 1945. Berlin looked like the end of the world had arrived.' Lange scratched his head without disarranging his neatly combed hair. 'And that's the kind of chaos I had to work in. None of these Army guys, or the clowns who worked for the so-called Military Government, knew the city. Hah of them couldn't even speak the language. I'd been in Berlin right up until 1941 and I was able to renew all those old contacts. I set up the whole agent network that your dad ran into the East. He was smart, your dad, he knew I could deliver what I promised. He assigned me to work as his assistant and I told the Army where to stick their ""War Correspondent"" badge, pin and all.' He laughed. 'Jesus, but they were mad. They were mad at me and mad at your dad. The US Army complained to Eisenhower's intelligence. But your dad had a direct line to Whitehall and that trumped their ace.'"|"London Match"|"Len Deighton"
"~ 21:00"|"about nine o'clock in the evening"|"For a moment or more I hesitated. Then I said, 'We'd been in the East nearly three weeks. It was at the time when a lot of things were going wrong for us. A KGB arrest team came for him in a safe house we used in Stendal. I was there with him. It was about nine o'clock in the evening. Max got a car; God knows where he found it. Neither of us had papers; they were in a suitcase at the station.'"|"London Match"|"Len Deighton"
"ap 09:45"|"nine forty-five"|"He looked at his watch. 'If they don't arrive by nine, we'll have to do this later in the day. I'm due at a meeting in the conference room at nine forty-five.'"|"London Match"|"Len Deighton"
00:00|midnight|"'And what happens if I get you home later than midnight?' said Dicky with that fruity voice he used after people had laughed at a couple of his jokes. 'Do you turn into a pumpkin or something?' They both laughed. Perhaps he wasn't talking about Tessa, but it made me sick in my stomach to think of her being with Dicky Cruyer and of George being miserable about it."|"London Match"|"Len Deighton"
12:00|midday|"It was still raining when we came out of the Science Museum. There are never any taxicabs available in Exhibition Road at midday on Saturday, they are all working the West End or the airport or taking a day off. Mario's is not very far, but we were all rather wet by the time we arrived."|"London Match"|"Len Deighton"
"< 00:00"|"before midnight"|"None of the women — not even the gorgeous Tessa, flaunting a new green-silk dress that was all pleats and fringe — could compare with mine. Gloria's hair was perfect, and she wore a choker of pearls and a very low-cut white dress that was tight-fitting enough to do justice to her wonderful figure. I watched her all the evening as she effortlessly charmed everyone, and I knew beyond a doubt that I was seriously in love with her. Like all such London dinner parties it ended rather early and we were home and undressing for bed before midnight. We didn't read."|"London Match"|"Len Deighton"
03:20|"three-twenty in the morning"|"It was dark. I looked at the radio clock and saw that it was three-twenty in the morning as I became fully awake. I'd been sleepingbadly for some time. I had a recurring dream in which I was swept away in the filthy swirl of some wide tropical river — I could see the palm trees along the distant banks — and as I drowned I choked on the oily scum. And as I choked I woke up."|"London Match"|"Len Deighton"
"ap 08:30"|eight-thirty|"We were in the sitting room of an eleventh-floor flat near Netting Hill Gate, a residential district of mixed races and lifestyles on the west side of central London. It was eight-thirty on a Monday evening. We were dancing very very slowly in that old-fashioned way in which you clasped each other tight. The radio was tuned to Alan Dell's BBC programme of big-band jazz, and he was playing an old Dorsey recording of Tea for Two'. She was letting her hair grow longer. It was a pale-gold colour and now it was breaking over her shoulders. She wore a dark-green ribbed polo-neck sweater, with a chunky necklace and a light-brown suede skirt. It was all very simple, but with her long legs and generous figure the effect was stunning."|"London Match"|"Len Deighton"
00:00|midnight|"Ted looked at Gloria who closed the curtains and put on her coat. Ted helped her into it. 'At midnight he turns into a frog,' he told her, indicating me with a movement of his head."|"London Match"|"Len Deighton"

"ap 08:30"|eight-thirty|"'As I say, he tunes in each morning. Or perhaps I should say that the timer you put on the electric plug shows electricity being used each morning at eight-thirty. Then he does his exercises and has a couple of cups of coffee before the interrogator comes.'"|"London Match"|"Len Deighton"
"ap 03:00"|"three o'clock"|"It was three o'clock Sunday morning by the time I'd collected the car and driven back to Bret Rensselaer's place in Berkshire. Bret was fully dressed when he came to answer the door to me — he was quick to tell me that he'd never gone to bed — but he'd changed his clothes; he was now in a roll-neck cashmere sweater and matching blue poplin pants. He'd been waiting for the phone call that would tell him everything had gone smoothly."|"London Match"|"Len Deighton"
"ap 08:30"|eight-thirty|"'Ted told me that Stinnes is tuned to Moscow every morning at eight-thirty. Ted thought he was getting his instructions from them. Maybe one of the instructions they gave him was to tell us about the Cambridge cell and get Ted Riley blown into little pieces.'"|"London Match"|"Len Deighton"
02:30|"2.30 a.m."|"We were in an all-night launderette. I was pretending to read a newspaper that was resting on my knees. It was 2.30 a.m., and outside the street was very dark. But there was not much to be seen through 'the windows, for this small shop was a cube of bright blue light suspended in the dark suburban streets of Hampstead. From the loudspeaker fixed in the ceiling came the soft scratchy sounds of pop music too subdued to be recognizable. A dozen big washing machines lined one wall. Their white enamel was chipped and scarred with the initials of the cleaner type of vandal. Detergent was spilled across the floor like yellow snow and there was the pungent smell of boiled coffee from a dispensing machine in the corner. We were sitting at the far end of a line of chairs facing the washing machines. Side by side Bret and I stared at the big cyclops where some dirty linen churned in suds. Customers came and went, so that most of the machines were working. Every few moments the mechanisms made loud clicking noises and sometimes the humming noises modulated to a scream as one of the drums spun."|"London Match"|"Len Deighton"
"ap 03:00"|"three o'clock"|"I started the car and pulled away before there was any sign of a police car. I suppose that respectable part of Hampstead doesn't attract a big police presence at three o'clock on a Tuesday morning. 'What the hell happened?' I asked."|"London Match"|"Len Deighton"
17:30|"half past five that afternoon"|"From Berwick House I drove straight back to London for a conference that was scheduled for half past five that afternoon.

"ap 05:00"|five|"'I'm not the sort of man who boasts of his conquests — you know that, Bernard — but one woman could never be enough for me. I have a powerful libido. I should never have got married. I realized that long ago. I remember my old tutor used to say that the trouble with marriage is that while every woman is at heart a mother, every man is at heart a bachelor.' He chuckled.
'I have to see Werner Volkmann at five,' I reminded him.
Dicky looked at his watch. 'Is that the time? How that clock goes round. Every day it's the same.'"|"London Match"|"Len Deighton"
"~ 23:00"|"about eleven at night"|"'I don't know anything about that,' said Dicky. 'All I remember is that Bret had arranged to meet a contact there. We went into the bar about eleven at night, but the place was almost empty. It was elaborately furnished — red velvet and carpet on the floor — but it was empty except for a few regular customers and a line of hostesses and the bartender. I never found out if the nightlife in Kiel starts later than that or doesn't exist at all.'"|"London Match"|"Len Deighton"
"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"When we went downstairs, Lisl Hennig was sitting in the dining room. It was a large airy room overlooking the gloomy courtyard. The panelling had been painted cream and so had some of the cupboards. There was an old Oriental rug to cover worn lino just inside the doorway, and there were framed prints on the walls — scenes of German rural life — and one tiny picture that was different from the rest. It was a George Grosz drawing, a picture of a deformed soldier, a war veteran made grotesque by his injuries. It was full of rage and spite and despair so that the artist's lines attacked the paper. Lisl was sitting near the drawing, at a table by the window. She was always there about noon. On the table there was the usual pile of newspapers. She couldn't live without newspapers — she was obsessed by them, and woe betide anyone who interrupted her reading. Her mornings were always spent in going through them all, column by column: news, adverts, gossip, theatre, concert reviews, share prices, and even the classified adverts. Now she had finished her papers; now she was sociable again."|"London Match"|"Len Deighton"
12:00|noon|"She was a big woman and the old-fashioned black silk dress with a lacy front did nothing to disguise her bulk. Her hair was lacquered, her once-pretty face was heavily but carefully painted, and there was too much mascara on her eyelashes. Backstage in a theatre her appearance would have gone unremarked but in the cold hard light of noon she looked rather grotesque. 'Sit down and have coffee,' she commanded with a regal movement of her hand."|"London Match"|"Len Deighton"
00:00|midnight|"At midnight the front door to Lisl Hennig's hotel was locked. That had always been the routine, ever since I could remember. Any hotel guest who occasionally returned after that time was given a key on request. Any guest frequently returning after that time was asked to find another hotel."|"London Match"|"Len Deighton"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"Guests arriving there after midnight without a key had to tug the old bellpuil. You couldn't hear the bell from outside in the street and sometimes guests made a great deal of noise before they got in. I couldn't hear the bell from my little garret room at the very top of the house. Lisl could hear the bell. She slept downstairs — she'd been sleeping .downstairs ever since her arthritis had got really bad. Lisl never went down to open the door, of course; just that one flight of stone stairs, from the salon to the front hall, was something she didn't attempt very often. One of the servants opened the door if the bell rang. They took it in turns. Usually it was Klara, but on that night after Werner went over to the East it was Richard, a youngish man from Bremen who worked in the kitchen. Klara was not out that night, of course — she was in bed and asleep and awakened by the bell as always. But when she was off duty, she was off duty, and she just turned over and forgot about it."|"London Match"|"Len Deighton"
02:30|"2:30 a.m."|"So it was Richard who went down to the front door when the bell went at 2:30 a.m. It was dark and still raining, and Richard took with him the wooden bat used for flattening slices of veal to make Wiener schnitzels. As he said afterwards, he knew that there were no guests still not back and he wanted something to defend himself with."|"London Match"|"Len Deighton"
12:00|noon|"'How?' If Frank knew officially about Bret's arrival, the report would go through regular channels and be in London by noon the following day."|"London Match"|"Len Deighton"
"ap 09:30"|nine-thirty|"It was nine-thirty when the call came through. I was a hundred and fifty points behind Lisl and trying to make two hearts with a hand that wasn't really worth a bid. Lisl answered the phone. She must have realized that I was waiting for my call. She passed it to me. It was Posh Harry."|"London Match"|"Len Deighton"

"ap 08:00"|"Eight o'clock"|"'Eight o'clock will be very convenient,' I said. 'Good night, Frank. See you in the morning.' I'd turned the radio down while talking on the phone; now I made it louder. It was a Swedish station playing a Bruckner symphony; the opening chords filled the room."|"London Match"|"Len Deighton"
"ap < 04:00"|"before four"|"Now that my eyes had become used to the gloom I could see the big electric clock over the door that led to the wards. It was the clock that gave that loud click every second. It was the only sound to be heard. 'What time did they say his brother's plane would arrive?'
'I don't think he can possibly get here before four,' said Frank.
'Sheldon was his father's favourite. Bret resented that. Did he ever tell you?'"|"London Match"|"Len Deighton"
