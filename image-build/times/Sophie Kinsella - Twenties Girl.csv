13:30|"1:30 P.M."|"Silently, the woman raises her hand and points at a plastic-lettered sign above the door: BERTRAM COX—1:30 P.M. Damn. Why didn’t I notice that?"|"Twenties Girl"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 08:30"|eight-thirty|"he next day the sketch of the necklace is all I have left. Sadie has disappeared and the whole episode feels like a dream. At eight-thirty I’m sitting at my desk, sipping coffee and staring down at the picture. What on earth got into me yesterday? The entire thing must have been my brain cracking up under the strain. The necklace, the girl, the banshee wailing … It was obviously all a figment of my imagination."|"Twenties Girl"|"Sophie Kinsella"
09:00|"nine a.m."|"“Oh yes, another thing,” she says hurriedly. “Janet from Leonidas Sports called, wanting an update. She said she was going to ring at nine a.m. sharp. This’ll be her.” She meets my panicky eyes. “Do you want me to answer?”"|"Twenties Girl"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"“All fixed up!” Kate puts the phone down. “You’re having lunch today at one o’clock.”"|"Twenties Girl"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 02:00"|two|"From the shell-shocked way Clive’s froggy eyes have widened, I’m guessing the answer is yes. At two neighboring tables, conversations have come to a halt, and I can see our supercilious waiter pausing to watch. The buzz of clashing cutlery and conversation seems to have died away all around. Even the lobsters seem to be lined up at the edge of the tank, watching."|"Twenties Girl"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"haven’t felt as zippy as this for weeks. For months. It’s eight o’clock the next morning, and I feel like a brand-new person! Instead of waking all depressed, with a picture of Josh clutched in my tearstained hand, a bottle of vodka on the floor, and Alanis Morissette playing on a loop…"|"Twenties Girl"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 07:30"|seven-thirty|"“Good idea,” I say brightly.
“Saturday night, seven-thirty?”
“See you there.”"|"Twenties Girl"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 00:30"|twelve-thirty|"It’s twelve-thirty on Saturday and I’ve been sitting here for twenty minutes. I know the restaurant so well, I’ve been able to plan things perfectly. I’m in the corner, tucked out of sight, wearing a baseball cap just to be on the safe side. The restaurant’s one of those bustling brasseries with lots of tables and plants and hooks for coats, so I’m easily able to blend away in the background."|"Twenties Girl"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 02:40"|"Third of three"|"“I’m in no hurry.” Josh’s voice has deepened a smidgen. I’m watching in horror. They’ve got that whole eyes-meeting frissony thing going on. Any minute he’ll take her hand, or even worse. What’s Sadie waiting for?
“Well, I was born in Dublin.” She smiles. “Third of three.”
“Why did you break up with Lara?” Sadie’s voice is so piercing through my earpiece, I nearly jump out of my chair."|"Twenties Girl"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"“But you haven’t even chosen a frock!” Sadie is hopping with impatience. “It’s already two o’clock! We need to go home now. Now!”"|"Twenties Girl"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"While I’m trying to think of something to say, I run my eyes over him. Nice charcoal jacket, I have to admit. He’s taller than I remember, with a broader, firmer frame, in an expensive-looking shirt. A hint of five o’clock shadow; the same V of frown lines that he had in the office. For God’s sake. It’s the weekend, he’s on a date, yet he looks as if he’s at some really serious board meeting where everyone’s about to be fired and lose all their bonuses."|"Twenties Girl"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap ~ 06:00"|"about six"|"It was as if I’d asked to see the president. Within the hour, about six assistants started sending me emails, coordinating a time, changing the time, changing the location, organizing a car, asking me to bring ID, telling me I couldn’t overrun my slot, asking what Lingtons beverage I’d prefer in the car…."|"Twenties Girl"|"Sophie Kinsella"
18:30|"6:30 p.m."|"I have a plan, and it’s a pretty good one. I’ve been using all my detective skills in the few days since we got back from Uncle Bill’s house. First of all, I found out about Diamanté’s next Tutus and Pearls catwalk show. It’s this Thursday at the Sanderstead Hotel, 6:30 p.m., private guest list. The only trouble was, I couldn’t see Diamanté putting me on the private guest list in a million years, bearing in mind I’m not a photographer from Hello! or one of her celebrity chums or have four hundred quid to spend on a dress. So then came my master stroke. I emailed Sarah in a friendly way and said I’d really like to support Diamanté in her fashion venture and could I come and talk to Uncle Bill about it? Maybe I would just drop over to the house on spec, I suggested. Maybe tomorrow!!! And I added a few smiley faces for good measure."|"Twenties Girl"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 05:45"|5:45|"It only takes twenty minutes to get to Farringdon, and as I hurry up the tube steps I glance at my watch—5:45. Perfect."|"Twenties Girl"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"By seven o’clock my neck is aching and my eyes are red-rimmed. I’ve made a new, emergency long list of candidates, using old issues of Business People, the Internet, and a copy of Marketing Week I made Kate run out and buy. But none of them will even take my call—let alone talk about a job, let alone allow me to quickly slap them onto a short list. I have less than forty-eight hours. I’m going to have to invent a top marketing director. Or impersonate one."|"Twenties Girl"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"By ten o’clock the list has been finalized and sent off to Janet Grady. I flop back in my chair and grin at Kate, who’s staring intently at her computer screen."|"Twenties Girl"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap > 09:30"|"just after nine-thirty"|"I get to work just after nine-thirty to find Natalie already at her desk, flicking her hair back as she talks on the phone. “Yeah. That’s what I said to him, babe.” She winks at me and taps her watch. “In a bit late, aren’t you Lara? Got into bad habits when I was away? Anyway, babe…” She swivels back again."|"Twenties Girl"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"I’ve called for her until I’m hoarse, over and over, out the window, up and down the street. But she doesn’t hear. Or she doesn’t want to hear. Abruptly, I stand up and consult my watch; I have to go, anyway. It’s five o’clock. Time for my appointment with Malcolm Gledhill, the collections manager."|"Twenties Girl"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 06:00"|six|"“Very well.” The trainer gathers up all his pieces of equipment, brushing the sand off them. “I see you at six.”"|"Twenties Girl"|"Sophie Kinsella"
09:05|"9:05 a.m."|"The tour of the office doesn’t take that long. In fact, we’re pretty much done by 9:05 a.m. Ed looks at everything twice and says it’s all great, and gives me a list of contacts who might be helpful, then has to leave for his own office. And then, about an hour later, just as I’m elbow deep in rose stems and water and a hastily bought vase, Mum and Dad arrive, also bearing flowers, and a bottle of champagne, and a new box of paper clips, which is Dad’s little joke."|"Twenties Girl"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap ~ 05:30"|"about five-thirty"|"I text Ed, saying I have a headache and need to be alone. When I get home, there’s no Sadie, which doesn’t surprise me. I make some supper, which I don’t eat, then sit in bed with the necklace around my neck, twisting the beads and watching old movies on TCM and not even bothering to try to sleep. At last, at about five-thirty, I get up, put on some clothes, and head out. The soft gray of the dawn is tinged with a vivid pink-red sunrise. I stand still, gazing at the red streaks in the sky for a few moments, and in spite of everything feel my spirits lifting. Then I buy a coffee from a café, get on a bus, and head to Waterloo, staring blankly out as the bus trundles through the streets. By the time I arrive it’s nearer six-thirty. People are starting to appear on the bridge and in the streets. The London Portrait Gallery is still shut up, though. Locked and empty; not a soul inside. That’s what you’d think, anyway."|"Twenties Girl"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"I find a nearby wall, sit down, and sip my coffee, which is lukewarm but delicious on an empty stomach. I’m prepared to sit there all day, but as a nearby church bell strikes eight, she appears on the steps, that dreamy look on her face again. She’s wearing yet another amazing dress, this one in pearl gray with a tulle skirt cut in petal shapes. A gray cloche is pulled down over her head, and her eyes are lowered. I don’t want to alarm her, so I wait until she notices me and starts in surprise."|"Twenties Girl"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 08:55"|"Eight fifty-five"|"She sits down beside me on a wooden bench, and for a moment we’re both silent. I glance at my watch. Eight fifty-five. They open up shop at nine. Just the thought gives me a rush of panic, so I won’t think about it. Not yet. I’ll just focus on the fact that I’m sitting here with Sadie."|"Twenties Girl"|"Sophie Kinsella"

"ap 01:02"|one-two|"adies and gentlemen.” My voice booms so loudly, I stop and clear my throat. I’ve never spoken into such a big loudspeaker system, and even though I did a “Hello, Wembley, one-two, one-two” sound check earlier, it’s still a bit of a shock."|"Twenties Girl"|"Sophie Kinsella"
