14:30|"2:30 p.m."|"I pulled away from the curb and slowly drove by. It was Jack Bass’s place. Say that real fast. It was only 2:30 p.m. Cindy’s red Mercedes was parked in the drive."|Pulp|"Charles Bukowski"
12:00|noon|"I decided to stay in bed until noon. Maybe by then half the world would be dead and it would only be half as hard to take. Maybe if I got up at noon I’d look better, feel better. I knew a guy once who didn’t excrete for days. He finally just exploded. Really. Shit flew out of his belly."|Pulp|"Charles Bukowski"

I looked at my watch. It was right on 2:30. Where were they?
I signaled the waiter for another drink…"|Pulp|"Charles Bukowski"
"ap 02:35"|2:35|"I signaled the waiter for another drink…
At 2:35 Celine walked in. He stood there a moment, looking about.
I waved my napkin on a fork. He walked over, sat down."|Pulp|"Charles Bukowski"
"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"I awakened about noon, eliminated some waste, brushed my teeth, shaved, mused. Didn’t feel too bad. Didn’t feel too much. I got dressed. I put on an egg, let it boil. I drank a glass of half-tomato and half-ale. I let the egg run under cold water, peeled it, ate it and then I was as ready as I would ever be."|Pulp|"Charles Bukowski"
"~ 20:00"|"about 8 p.m."|"So, there I was, parked outside of Bass’s place, a third of a block down. It was evening, no it was night, about 8 p.m. Cindy’s red Mercedes was in the drive. I had a hunch I was onto something."|Pulp|"Charles Bukowski"
"~ 15:00"|"around 3 p.m."|"It was around 3 p.m. I found a stool and sat down. The bartender came up. Lonely looking guy. Didn’t have any eyelids. Had little green crosses painted on his fingernails. Some kind of nut. There was no avoiding them. Most of the world was mad. And the part that wasn’t mad was angry."|Pulp|"Charles Bukowski"
"ap ~ 09:00"|"about 9"|"I walked along the plush rug until I found apartment 9. What was it about 9? There seemed something dangerous about it. But most numbers worried me. I only liked 3, 7 and 8 or combinations thereof."|Pulp|"Charles Bukowski"
"~ 22:00"|"about ten p.m."|"I got up, walked down the bar, tossed some bills to the bartender and walked out. The punk was no longer on the bench.

14:00|"2 p.m."|"“Yeah, oh,” I said.
“Meet us at the Grand Central Market, tomorrow afternoon, 2 p.m.”
“That’s a big place. Where?”"|Pulp|"Charles Bukowski"
14:00|"2 p.m."|"So, it was 2 p.m. I was at the Grand Central Market. I had found the butcher shop and I stood at the hogs’ heads. The holes in the skulls, where the eyes had been, looked at me. I looked back, took a puff at my cigar. So many things to make a man sad. The poor boiled those skulls for soup."|Pulp|"Charles Bukowski"
