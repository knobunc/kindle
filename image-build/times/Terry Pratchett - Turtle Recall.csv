Her head might strike anyone watching as being just slightly too big for the rest of her, but perhaps she’ll grow into it. We also meet Tiffany at the age of eleven (A Hat Full of Sky), thirteen (Wintersmith) and not quite sixteen (I Shall Wear Midnight)."|"Turtle Recall"|"Terry Pratchett"

Washed and dried and left in the middle of a clean floor for five minutes, Went-worth would be sticky. It didn’t seem to come from anywhere. He just got sticky. But he was an easy child to mind, provided you stopped him eating frogs. By the time he was seven, little Wentworth was always running after the men, always wanting to be one of them, always trying to help. By the time he’s in I Shall Wear Midnight, he’s happy to fight much bigger boys in the village to defend his sister’s honour. (TWFM, AHFOS, W, ISWM]"|"Turtle Recall"|"Terry Pratchett"

It slows down considerably (and variably, but generally to about the speed of sound) and, at the same time, becomes very slightly heavier than air and also – by assumption – soluble. (It pools in deep valleys but has gone by midnight, so it either sinks into the ground or is soluble in darkness.)"|"Turtle Recall"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap ~ 06:00"|"about 600"|"The combined effect of these changes can be seen by watching a Discworld day from a convenient point in space. The disc is 10,000 miles across. The sunlight strikes point A and proceeds towards point B at about 600 mph, producing a rather pleasing effect similar to an incoming tide. When it strikes a mountain range (C) it piles up on the dawn side, so that dawn will be postponed in the ‘light shadow’ of the mountain until either the light flows over the top or around the sides."|"Turtle Recall"|"Terry Pratchett"

No room ought to be more than a mile across, especially when, outside in the corridor, it appears to have perfectly normal rooms on either side of it. It shouldn’t have a ceiling so high that you can’t see it, either. It simply should not fit. Technically it appears to be a classic Bag of Holding but with n mouths, where n is the number of items in an eleven-dimensional universe that are not currently alive, not pink and can fit in a cubical drawer 14.14 inches on a side, divided by P (unknown). The wizards don’t know what it’s for or who built it. Nothing in it is bigger than about fourteen inches square, but they don’t know why this is or who it is who decides they are curious, or why, and they certainly don’t know why it contains nothing pink. Anything taken out of it has to be returned in 14.14 hours recurring. When it closes up, its drawers slam in on themselves far too fast for the human eye to follow as the edifice shrinks and folds and slides and rattles down into house size, shed size and, finally, in the middle of the huge space it becomes a small polished cabinet, about a foot and a half on a side, standing on four beautifully carved legs.
