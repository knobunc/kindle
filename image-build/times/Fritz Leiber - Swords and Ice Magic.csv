12:00|noon|"Now it may be that in the world of Nehwon there are gods of whom even Death does not know and who from time to time take pleasure in putting obstacles in his path. Or it may be that Chance is quite as great a power as Necessity. At any rate, on this particular morning Fafhrd the Northerner, who customarily snoozed till noon, waked with the first dull silvery shaft of dawn and took up his dear weapon Graywand, naked as he, and blearily made his way from his penthouse pallet out onto the roof, where he began to practice all manner of swordstrokes, stamping his feet in his advances and from time to time uttering battleshouts, unmindful of the weary merchants he waked below him into groaning, cursing, or fright-quivering life. He shivered at first from the chill, fishy dawnmist from the Great Salt Marsh, but soon was sweating from his exercise, while his thrusts and parries, perfunctory to begin with, grew lightning-swift and most authoritative."|"Swords and Ice Magic"|"Fritz Leiber"
12:00|"high noon"|"It was high noon and the sun was hottest. Fafhrd's left hand touched in the dry heat a cool fence about two feet high, invisible at first though not for long."|"Swords and Ice Magic"|"Fritz Leiber"
12:00|noon|"The Great Gong of Lankhmar, sounding distantly through the walls, boomed out the twelve funereal strokes of noon, when burial parties plunge spade into earth."|"Swords and Ice Magic"|"Fritz Leiber"
12:00|midday|"As they worked, the three waterspouts vanished in the distance ahead, to be replaced by a group of five more coming up fast from astern -- somewhat nearer this time, for all the while _Black Racer_ was being driven gradually but relentlessly south. From almost overhead the midday sun beat down fiercely, for the storm wind blowing near hurricane force had brought no clouds or opaque air with it -- in itself a prodigy unparalleled in the recollection of the Mouser or even Fafhrd, a widely sailed man. After several futile efforts to steer north out of the mighty current (which resulted only in the following storm wind shifting perversely north a point or two, driving them deeper south) the two men gave over, thereby admitting their complete inability at present to influence their leopard boat's course."|"Swords and Ice Magic"|"Fritz Leiber"
12:00|noon|"""But I will,"" the Mouser responded gently. ""Recall the gigantic spout like speeding mesa we briefly saw far south of us last noon? That was the moonspout, to invent a word. And now it's raced to sky ahead of us, in half day since."""|"Swords and Ice Magic"|"Fritz Leiber"
12:00|noon|"""Of course not,"" the Mouser said patiently. ""Sunlight drowns out their twinkles for those folk. It's day up there, you see."" He pointed at the dark near the moon. ""Up there, you see, they're bathed in highest noon, drenched in the light of sun, which now is somewhere near us, but hid from us by the thick walls of his sunspout, to coin a word wholly analogous to moonspout."""|"Swords and Ice Magic"|"Fritz Leiber"
12:00|noon|"But the Mouser did eventually make the admission although his mind had not the edge-of-sleep honesty of Fafhrd's and tended to drift off to musings on his bubble-cosmos. Yet under strong prompting by Fafhrd he even confessed to his encounter with the sun-red vermilion-eyed shimmer-girl last noon, when he'd looked afire, and upon Fafhrd's insistence recalled the exact words she'd said to him in dream."|"Swords and Ice Magic"|"Fritz Leiber"
00:00|midnight|"True indeed, the interior of the Silver Eel presented a tavern visage as leaden-hued as its wine cups. The hour was halfway between midnight and dawn, the light dim without being murky, the air dank yet not chill, the other drinkers like moody statues, the faces of the barkeep and his bully and servers paralyzed in expressions of petulant discontent, as if Time herself had stopped."|"Swords and Ice Magic"|"Fritz Leiber"
00:00|midnight|"That last attribute broke the congealed midnight trances of the assembled dullards, a half dozen of whom converged on the newcomers, calling low invitations and trailing throaty laughs. The two moved forward as if to hasten the encounter, with gaze unwaveringly ahead."|"Swords and Ice Magic"|"Fritz Leiber"
00:00|midnight|"Then a swift two-day broad reach north again, while air and sea grew rapidly colder, until by their reckonings they were half-journey to the latitude of the Claws. And now two days of dismal beating about in one place await for Fafhrd, with the cold increasing steadily until, this midnight, clear skies had given way to the ice fog in which _Flotsam_ lay becalmed. Two days in which to wonder if Fafhrd would manage to find this spot, or even come at all."|"Swords and Ice Magic"|"Fritz Leiber"
"ap 01:00"|one|"At one stride went the dark. From the low west the true sun burst forth, warmly lighting the bay in which they lay and striking an infinitude of golden gleams from the great, white, crystalline cliff to steerside, down which streaming water rushed in a thousand streams and runnels. A league or so beyond it rose a conical mountain down whose sides flowed glaring scarlet and from whose jaggedly truncated summit brilliant vermilion flames streamed toward the zenith, their dark smoke carried off northeastward by the wind."|"Swords and Ice Magic"|"Fritz Leiber"
00:00|midnight|"The bowman laid his five arrows across the brazier and then, as they came alight, plucked them out and sent them winging successively toward Sayend with such miraculous swiftness that the fifth was painting its narrow orange curve upon the midnight air before the first had struck."|"Swords and Ice Magic"|"Fritz Leiber"
00:00|midnight|"Fafhrd had nodded dubiously on hearing that. He had not liked accepting responsibility for a girl with his childhood sweetheart's name. Nor had he liked leaving the management of everything in Salthaven to the Mouser and the two women, now that there was so much to do, and besides all else the new task of investigating the Grand Maelstrom and spying out its ways, which would occupy the Mouser for a day at least, and which more befitted Fafhrd as the more experienced ship-conner. But the four of them had conferred together at midnight in _Flotsam_'s cabin behind shrouded portholes, pooling their knowledge and counsels and the two gods' prophecies, and it had been so decided."|"Swords and Ice Magic"|"Fritz Leiber"
12:00|noon|"He handed it to Pshawri. ""Two pieces to each man at nightfall, if I'm not returned,"" he directed. ""Keep them hard at work. 'Twere well _Flotsam_
were seaworthy by noon tomorrow at latest. Go.""
Pshawri saluted and made off."|"Swords and Ice Magic"|"Fritz Leiber"
