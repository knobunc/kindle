 Alas! 'tis clear as noonday now. But say,
 Lady, who carried this report to Thebes?"|"Oedipus Trilogy"|Sophocles
12:00|noonday|"(Epode)
 Such ills not I alone,
 He too our guest hath known,
 E'en as some headland on an iron-bound shore,
 Lashed by the wintry blasts and surge's roar,
 So is he buffeted on every side
 By drear misfortune's whelming tide,
 By every wind of heaven o'erborne
 Some from the sunset, some from orient morn,
 Some from the noonday glow.
 Some from Rhipean gloom of everlasting snow."|"Oedipus Trilogy"|Sophocles
