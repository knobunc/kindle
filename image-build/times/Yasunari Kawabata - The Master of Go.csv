"ap ~ 10:00"|"about ten"|"Apparently Otaké, one of the eminences of the Go world, was thinking seriously that if his two daughters, six and four, showed promise, he would make them professionals like himself. It is said that talent in Go appears at about ten, and that if a child does not begin his studies by that age there is no hope for him. Yet Otaké's words struck me as odd. Did they tell, perhaps, of youth, of a thirty-year-old who was a captive of Go but had not yet been bled by it? His household must be a happy one, I thought."|"The Master of Go"|"Yasunari Kawabata"
"ap 00:30"|"half past twelve"|"Otaké had worried the whole night through about whether to continue the game with the ailing Master. He had not slept at all, and had come sleepless to the session that morning. It was Black's turn at half past twelve, the hour specified for breaking off the session, and after almost an hour and a half Otaké still had not decided upon his sealed play. There was no question of lunch. Mrs. Otaké of course found it difficult to sit quietly in her room. She too had passed a sleepless night."|"The Master of Go"|"Yasunari Kawabata"
"ap 00:30"|"twelve thirty"|"Immediately after White 98 the youth who was keeping records announced that a minute of play remained. Then it was twelve thirty, time for the sealed play."|"The Master of Go"|"Yasunari Kawabata"
11:40|"twenty minutes before noon"|"His voice was low but intense, as if he were telling Otaké to be quick about it. Was he objecting to the somewhat histrionic quality of Otaké's behavior, was he eager to do battle? Otaké opened his eyes and closed them again. During the sessions at Itō he read the Lotus Sutra on mornings of play, and he now seemed to be bringing himself to order through silent meditation. Then, quickly, there came a rap of stone on board. It was twenty minutes before noon."|"The Master of Go"|"Yasunari Kawabata"
16:00|"four in the afternoon"|"Otaké's Black 5 took twenty minutes, and the Master used forty-one minutes for White 6, the first considerable period of deliberation in the match. Since it had been arranged that the player whose turn came at four in the afternoon would seal his play, the sealed play would be the Master's unless he played within two minutes. Otaké's Black 11 had come at two minutes before the hour. The Master sealed his White 12 at twenty-two minutes after the hour."|"The Master of Go"|"Yasunari Kawabata"
"ap 03:30"|"three hours and a half"|"It astonished the managers, and myself as well, that Otaké deliberated his first move at Itō, when the game was resumed after a three-month recess, for two hundred and eleven minutes - a full three hours and a half.

"ap 03:30"|"three hours and a half"|"Probably it was the truth. Probably in those three hours and a half Otaké was not only deliberating his play; he was bringing himself back to the board after a three-month absence, and doing his best to map out the finished game, through all the stages and formations it was likely to take."|"The Master of Go"|"Yasunari Kawabata"
"ap 05:00"|"five o'clock"|"In games lasting over several sessions, it was the custom from ancient times for Black to make the last play of a session, as an act of courtesy toward the more distinguished player. Since the practice gave the advantage to the latter, the injustice was remedied by having the player whose turn it was at the prearranged end of a session, say five o'clock, make the last play. A further refinement was hit upon: to seal the last play. Go took its example from chess, which had first devised the sealed play. The purpose was to eliminate the manifest irrationality of allowing the first player at the beginning of a session, having seen the last play, the whole of the recess, and it could be several days, in which to deliberate his next play, and of not charging the prolonged interval against his allotted time."|"The Master of Go"|"Yasunari Kawabata"
"ap 03:15"|3:15|"The move was to take place on June 30, the third day after the second session. Because of floods it was postponed to July 3 and finally to July 8. The Kanto was drenched and there were floods in the Kobé region. Even on the eighth the Tokaido line was still not through to Osaka. Leaving from Kamakura, I changed at Ofuna for the train on which the Master and his party had come from Tokyo. The 3:15 for Maibara was nine minutes late."|"The Master of Go"|"Yasunari Kawabata"
"ap 01:00"|one|"The judges for the Master's last match were Onoda and Iwamoto, both of the Sixth Rank. Iwamoto arrived at one on the afternoon of the eleventh. Taking a chair on the veranda, he sat gazing at the mountains. It was the day on which, according to the calendar, the rainy season ended, and indeed the sun was out for the first time in some days. Branches cast shadows over the wet ground, golden carp were bright in the pond. When play began, however, the sky was lightly clouded over once more. There was a strong enough breeze that the flowers in the alcove swayed gently. Aside from the waterfall in the garden and the river beyond, the silence was broken only by the distant sound of a rock-cutter's chisel. A scent of red lilies wafted in from the garden. In the almost too complete silence a bird soared grandly beyond the eaves. There were sixteen plays in the course of the afternoon, from sealed White 12 to sealed Black 27."|"The Master of Go"|"Yasunari Kawabata"
12:00|noon|"This outbuilding was almost a hundred yards across the garden from the main building. The noon recess came, and the figure of the Master going alone down the path caught my eye. Just beyond the gate of the outbuilding was a short slope, and the Master bent forward as he climbed it. I could not see the lines on the palms of the small hands he held lightly clasped behind him, but the network of veins seemed to be complex and delicate. He was carrying a folded fan. His body, bent forward from the hips, was perfectly straight, making his legs seem all the more unreliable. From below the thicket of dwarf bamboo, along the main road, came a sound of water down a narrow ditch. Nothing more - and yet the retreating figure of the Master somehow brought tears to my eyes. I was profoundly moved, for reasons I do not myself understand. In that figure walking absently from the game there was the still sadness of another world. The Master seemed like a relic left behind by Meiji."|"The Master of Go"|"Yasunari Kawabata"
12:00|noon|"Onoda came up behind the Master, as if to shield him from something. The Master's wife had come to meet him at the stone bridge over the pond. In the morning and afternoon she would see him as far as the game room, and slip away when he had taken his place at the board. At noon and at the end of a day's session she was always at the pond by their room, waiting for him."|"The Master of Go"|"Yasunari Kawabata"

"ap 01:37"|"one hour and thirty-seven minutes"|"For the twenty-one plays during the three Itō sessions, Black 101 to Black 121, Otaké had used eleven hours and forty-eight minutes. The Master had used only one hour and thirty-seven minutes. Had it been an ordinary match, Otaké would have exhausted his time allotment on a mere eleven plays."|"The Master of Go"|"Yasunari Kawabata"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"After a game of chess the day before, the Master had gone into town for a game of billiards. He had been at mahjong until almost midnight with Iwamoto, Murashima, and Yawata. That morning he was out strolling in the garden before eight. Red dragonflies lay on the ground."|"The Master of Go"|"Yasunari Kawabata"
"ap 07:30"|"seven thirty"|"The maple below Otaké's upstairs room was still half green. Otaké was up at seven thirty. He feared he might be defeated by stomach cramps, he said. He had ten varieties of medicine on his desk."|"The Master of Go"|"Yasunari Kawabata"
"ap 10:30"|"ten thirty"|"""The Condor flew in last night at ten thirty."" The Master went to the managers' room on the morning of the first. ""Can you imagine such speed!"""|"The Master of Go"|"Yasunari Kawabata"
12:00|noon|"""A fine thing,"" Otaké muttered over and over again. ""A very fine thing."" He was still deliberating Black 131 when the noon recess was called. ""A fine thing he's done to me. A terrible thing, that's what it is. Earthshaking. I make a stupid play myself, and here I am with my arm twisted behind me."""|"The Master of Go"|"Yasunari Kawabata"
"ap 11:34"|"eleven thirty-four"|"He made the play at eleven thirty-four, after twenty-seven minutes of deliberation. It was a matter of chance, I suppose, that he should have made a bad play after deliberating almost a half hour. Yet I was sorry afterwards that he had not waited another hour and so carried the play past the noon recess. If he had left the board and taken an hour and a half's rest, he would probably have played more effectively. He would not have fallen victim to a passing wraith, so to speak. He had twenty-three hours of play remaining, and need not have worried about an hour or two. But the Master was not one to make tactical use of a recess. It was Black 131 that had the advantage of the recess."|"The Master of Go"|"Yasunari Kawabata"

12:00|noon|"That Buddha countenance lasted for but a moment. Otaké's face was alive again with a lust for battle. The small, beautifully erect figure of the Master as he counted up points seemed to take on a grandeur that stilled the air around him. When Otaké played Black 191, the Master's head fell forward, his eyes were wide, he moved nearer the board. Both men were fanning themselves violently. The noon recess came with Black 195."|"The Master of Go"|"Yasunari Kawabata"
"> 12:00"|"shortly after noon"|"The afternoon session was moved back to the usual site, Room 6 in the main building. The sky clouded over from shortly after noon, and crows cawed incessantly. There was a light above the board, a sixty-watt bulb. The glare from a hundred watts would have been too much. Faint images the colour of the stones fell across the board. Perhaps in special observance of this last session, the innkeeper had changed the hangings in the alcove for twin landscapes by Kawabata Gyokushō{45}. Below them was a small statue of a Buddha on an elephant, and beside that a bowl of carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes, mushrooms, trefoil parsley, and the like."|"The Master of Go"|"Yasunari Kawabata"
14:42|"forty-two minutes past two in the afternoon"|"""Yes, five points,"" said the Master. Looking up through swollen eyelids, he made no motion toward rearranging the board. The game had ended at forty-two minutes past two in the afternoon."|"The Master of Go"|"Yasunari Kawabata"
