00:00|midnight|"The synagogue was empty and the candles had begun to burn low. We were quite alone, and I was overcome by increasing anxiety. I knew that I shouldn’t be there with him at midnight, for that is the hour when the dead rise up from their graves and come to say their prayers. Anyone they find in the synagogue risks being carried away, for fear he betray their secret."|Dawn|"Elie Wiesel"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"Radio Jerusalem…Last-minute news flashes. David ben Moshe’s execution will take place at dawn tomorrow. The High Commissioner has issued an appeal for calm. Curfew at nine o’clock. No one will be allowed on the streets. I repeat, no one will be allowed on the streets. The army has orders to shoot on sight…"|Dawn|"Elie Wiesel"

00:00|Midnight|"I was grateful for his consent. He and not I would warn John Dawson of his approaching end. I could never have done it. It’s easier to kill a man than to break the news that he is going to die.
“Midnight,” said Joab.
Midnight, I reflected, the hour when the dead rise out of their graves and come to say their prayers in the synagogue, the hour when God Himself weeps over the destruction of the Temple, the hour when a man should be able to plumb the depths of his being and to discover the Temple in ruins. A God that weeps and dead men that pray."|Dawn|"Elie Wiesel"

02:00|"two o’clock in the morning"|"Then came the last evening. The month of vacation was over and I was to go back to Paris the next day. As soon as we had finished supper we went to sit for the last time under the tree. I felt sad and lonely, and Catherine held my hand in hers without speaking. The night was fair and calm. At intervals, like a warm breath, the wind played over our faces. It must have been one or two o’clock in the morning when Catherine broke the silence, turned her melancholy face toward me, and said:"|Dawn|"Elie Wiesel"
00:00|midnight|"No wonder. The room was small, far too small to receive so many visitors at one time. Ever since midnight the visitors had been pouring in. Among them were people I had known, people I had hated, admired, forgotten. As I let my eyes wander about the room I realized that all of those who had contributed to my formation, to the formation of my permanent identity, were there. Some of them were familiar, but I could not pin a label upon them; they were names without faces or faces without names. And yet I knew that at some point my life had crossed theirs."|Dawn|"Elie Wiesel"

"ap > 02:00"|"after two"|"Almost brutally he snatched the cup and plate from Ilana’s hands and went precipitately down the stairs.
Joab looked at his watch. “It’s after two.”
“Is that all?” asked Ilana. “It’s a long night, the longest I’ve ever lived through.”"|Dawn|"Elie Wiesel"
"ap ~ 05:00"|"Around five o’clock"|"“I hope so,” said Ilana. “What time does the sun rise?”
“Around five o’clock.”
“And what time is it now?”"|Dawn|"Elie Wiesel"
"ap 02:20"|"Twenty past two"|"“And what time is it now?”
“Twenty past two,” said Joab, looking again at his watch.
“Aren’t you hot, Elisha?” Ilana asked me."|Dawn|"Elie Wiesel"
"ap 04:00"|"Four o’clock"|"Gad’s reappearance had roused Gideon and Joab from their sleep. With haggard faces they looked around the room, as if to assure themselves they weren’t dreaming. Stifling a yawn, Joab asked Gad for the time.
“Four o’clock,” said Gad, consulting his watch.
“So late? I’d never have thought it.”"|Dawn|"Elie Wiesel"
"ap > 04:00"|"after four"|"In an uncertain voice I answered that it was after four. He frowned, as if in an effort to grasp the hidden meaning of my words."|Dawn|"Elie Wiesel"
"ap 04:20"|"twenty past four"|"He did not seem to hear, but went on pacing from wall to wall. I looked at my watch; it was twenty past four. Suddenly he stopped in front of me and asked for a cigarette. I had a package of Players in my pocket and wanted to give them to him. But he refused to take the whole package, saying quite calmly that obviously he didn’t have time to smoke them all."|Dawn|"Elie Wiesel"
"~ 05:00"|"about five o’clock in the morning"|"I thought of David whom I had never met and would never know. Because he was not the first of us to be hanged we knew exactly when and how he would die. At about five o’clock in the morning the cell door would open and the prison director would say: Get ready, David ben Moshe; the time has come. “The time has come,” this is the ritual phrase, as if this and no other time had any significance. David would cast a look around the cell and the rabbi would say: “Come, my son.” They would go out, leaving the cell door open behind them (for some reason no one ever remembers to close it) and start down the long passageway leading to the execution chamber. As the man of the hour, conscious of the fact that the others were there solely on his account, David would walk in the center of the group. He would walk with his head held high—all our heroes held their heads high—and a strange smile on his lips. On either side of the passageway a hundred eyes and ears would wait for him to go by, and the first of the prisoners to perceive his approach would intone the Hatikva, the song of hope. As the group advanced the song would grow louder, more human, more powerful, until its sound rivaled that of the footsteps…"|Dawn|"Elie Wiesel"
"ap 04:50"|"Ten minutes to five"|"I looked at my watch. Ten minutes to five. Ten minutes to go. In ten minutes I should commit the most important and conclusive act of my life. I got up from the bed."|Dawn|"Elie Wiesel"
"ap 04:52"|"Eight minutes to five"|"Eight minutes to five. Eight minutes to go. I took the revolver out of my pocket. What should I do if he tried to take it from me? There was no chance of his escaping. The house was well guarded and there was no way of getting out of the cellar except through the kitchen. Gad, Gideon, Joab, and Ilana were on guard upstairs, and John Dawson knew it."|Dawn|"Elie Wiesel"
"ap 04:54"|"Six minutes to five"|"Six minutes to five. Six minutes to go. Suddenly I felt quite clearheaded.
