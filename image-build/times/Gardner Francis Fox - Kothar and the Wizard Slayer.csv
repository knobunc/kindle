12:00|"high noon"|"Flarion said, ""I can carry no more.” They went up the stone ladder, Flarion leading the way and following him, the girl. Kothar mounted easily after them. They came out into the sunlight of high noon, with the air about them sweet with the fragrance of growing things. The sky seemed bluer, the day more lovely, because of the treasure each one carried."|"Kothar and the Wizard Slayer"|"Gardner Francis Fox"
"~ 00:00"|"about midnight"|"“We'll come aboard about midnight.” The captain knuckled his brow to the witch-woman and stood up. ""I'll go along then, to make things ready. If you could tell me where it is we sail, I could plot a course.”"|"Kothar and the Wizard Slayer"|"Gardner Francis Fox"
00:00|midnight|"When the clepsydra showed the hour to be close to midnight, Lori pushed an empty platter away and reached behind her for her heavy woolen paenula. “It is time to go, to board the ship.”"|"Kothar and the Wizard Slayer"|"Gardner Francis Fox"
"< 00:00"|"toward midnight"|"She laughed up at him, caught his hand and squeezed it. ""Trusting Kothar! Always you see specters where there are none. But come, it moves toward midnight.”"|"Kothar and the Wizard Slayer"|"Gardner Francis Fox"
12:00|midday|"They came into the ancient ruins at midday, weary with long riding. Red Lori swayed oddly in her saddle; she was near her limits of endurance, the big barbarian realized. He leaped from the saddle, caught her as she lifted a leg over the kak, lowered her to the ground."|"Kothar and the Wizard Slayer"|"Gardner Francis Fox"
"< 12:00"|"almost midday"|"They rose to their feet and walked toward their horses, with the big barbarian treading on their heels. The morning sun was high—it was almost midday—and a soft breeze was blowing through the dead city."|"Kothar and the Wizard Slayer"|"Gardner Francis Fox"
12:00|midday|"It was warm in this midday, and there was an ache in his body, now that the need for action was at an end. He sank down beside the witch-woman and closed his eyelids. Almost at the same moment, he fell asleep."|"Kothar and the Wizard Slayer"|"Gardner Francis Fox"
"< 00:00"|"before midnight"|"""Fetch the food bags,” he said gently. They rode together out of Radimore just as the sun was going down in the west. They had not far to go, they would be in Ebboxor before midnight. And from Ebboxor? Where would he turn Greyling after that? He was tired of spells and incantations and magicians. There was a yearning for something more substantial than necromancy in his heart."|"Kothar and the Wizard Slayer"|"Gardner Francis Fox"
