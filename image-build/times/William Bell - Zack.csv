"ap ~ 10:30"|"about ten-thirty"|"I got home about ten-thirty, checked in with my parents, who were playing Scrabble at the kitchen table and arguing good-naturedly about a word Mom said Dad had just made up out of thin air, and took my loot from under the bed."|Zack|"William Bell"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"On the last Friday of June, I hoped my eagerness to get Mom and Dad out of my hair didn’t show. Although their plane didn’t leave until eleven o’clock, Dad was up at six, clanging and banging around, over-organizing things and tripping over his own feet."|Zack|"William Bell"

"ap 06:30"|six-thirty|"I have never been a morning person. Although I had set the alarm for six-thirty it was nine before I hauled myself out of bed, rubbed the sleep from my eyes, showered and dressed. After Jen had left the night before, I had lain awake listening to the breeze outside my open window, and the Grand River flowing along, wondering if the whole idea of the trip was a mistake. It was late before I fell asleep."|Zack|"William Bell"

"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"After a breakfast of toast and coffee I packed up all the gear and stowed it in the truck, then I did a tour of the house, checking to make sure all the windows and doors were locked, the timers set on the upstairs and downstairs lights, and the water main in the basement was shut off. It was ten o’clock when I pulled out of Fergus and headed south on Highway 6, my atlas open beside me on the seat."|Zack|"William Bell"
"ap 00:42"|12:42|"The clock on the dashboard read 12:42. I pulled the keys from the ignition, locked the cab and crawled into the back. Carelessly I kicked off my shoes. I crawled into the sleeping bag, burrowed deep and went back to sleep."|Zack|"William Bell"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"On the edge of town was a strip of discount motels and fast-food restaurants. It was eight o’clock and I had driven all day. It wouldn’t look good, I rationalized, to arrive late in the evening at my grandfather’s house, dirty and underfed."|Zack|"William Bell"
"ap ~ 00:00"|"‘round twelve"|"He gnawed the last shred of meat from a chicken bone and dropped it on his plate. When he spoke there was a hard edge to his voice. “When Cal and Ned were younger than you, ‘round twelve, I guess, they was real hellions. Got mixed up in the civil rights movement back there in the sixties. At Selma, Cal managed to get hisself in the first row of a demonstration. A police dog got at him. Chewed his arm up real bad before the cop got it under control. Probably wasn’t in much of a hurry, the cop. Cal almost bled to death.”"|Zack|"William Bell"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"I woke up at eight, pulled on my clothes and padded down the hall to the kitchen. A pot of coffee simmered on the stove. Lucas was nowhere to be seen."|Zack|"William Bell"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"As soon as the clock on our mantel chimed nine o’clock I picked up the phone. On the eighth ring a grumpy voice came on."|Zack|"William Bell"
"ap 09:15"|nine-fifteen|"Feeling pleased and a little like I had escaped the hangman, I bounced outside to wash the truck and remove the cap. I had to pick my parents up at the airport at nine-fifteen. When I laid eyes on the dented hood and crumpled quarter panel all my good thoughts flew away. It was time to face the hangman after all."|Zack|"William Bell"
