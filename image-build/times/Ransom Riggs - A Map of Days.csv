"< 00:00"|"nearly midnight"|"She was right—it was nearly midnight, and my friends had begun their day in Devil’s Acre twenty-three hours (and one hundred thirty–odd years) ago. We were all exhausted. I found places for everyone to sleep—in our guest bedrooms, stretched out on couches, in a tangle of blankets in a broom closet for Enoch, who preferred his sleeping arrangements dark and nest-like. I offered my parents’ bed to Miss Peregrine, since they wouldn’t be using it, but she demurred. “I appreciate the offer, but let Bronwyn and Miss Bloom share it. I’ll be keeping watch tonight.” She flashed me a knowing look that said, And not just over the house, and it took a lot of effort not to roll my eyes at her. You don’t have to worry, I almost said, Emma and I are taking things slow. But what business was that of hers? I was so irritated that the minute she left to tuck Olive and Claire into bed I found Emma and said, “Want to see my room?”"|"A Map of Days"|"Ransom Riggs"
"ap ~ 03:00"|"About three"|"“What time is it?”
“About three,” I said. “Everything’s okay.”
“No,” she said, looking around the room, confusion turning to panic."|"A Map of Days"|"Ransom Riggs"
"ap ~ 10:00"|"around ten"|"“I was around ten when it happened. Your grandfather would go on these long business trips. He’d be away for weeks at a time. I always wanted to go with him, and I used to beg and plead, but he always, always said no. Until one day. One day he said yes.”"|"A Map of Days"|"Ransom Riggs"
"ap < 06:00"|"almost six"|"Emma looked at her watch. “It’s almost six. We’d better be getting back.”"|"A Map of Days"|"Ransom Riggs"
"ap 07:15"|"seven fifteen"|"“The potting shed.”
“At seven fifteen, precisely.”
That gave me just over an hour of free time."|"A Map of Days"|"Ransom Riggs"
"ap 07:12"|"seven twelve"|"We milled around my backyard, waiting for Miss Peregrine. It was seven twelve, and the light had mostly gone out of the sky. I glanced at the potting shed, a neglected shack made from latticed wood that stood against the oleander hedges. My mother had gone through a gardening phase a few years back, but these days the shed was just a shelter for weeds and spiders."|"A Map of Days"|"Ransom Riggs"
"> 12:00"|"past noon"|"The clock had just ticked past noon in Devil’s Acre. Miss Peregrine had some business left to take care of here, but ours was done for the day, so we were to meet her at my house later on."|"A Map of Days"|"Ransom Riggs"
"ap 01:37"|"one thirty-seven"|"His gaze flicked across the lobby, then back at me. “Walk down that hall. Meet me at room one thirty-seven in two minutes. We can’t be seen walking together.”"|"A Map of Days"|"Ransom Riggs"
21:00|"nine p.m."|"“Pay attention.” It was the same gruff voice on the other end. H. “Abe’s spot, nine p.m. sharp. Sit at his booth. Order his usual.”"|"A Map of Days"|"Ransom Riggs"
"ap 08:30"|"eight thirty"|"The friends I’d taken mall shopping earlier were trying on their clothes, and the rest of the peculiars were still in the Acre. It was easy to slip away unnoticed. By eight thirty, we were driving into town."|"A Map of Days"|"Ransom Riggs"
09:00|"nine a.m."|"“It’s a test,” I said. “And it’s one I intend to pass. Anybody who feels the same, be downstairs with a bag packed at nine a.m. sharp.”"|"A Map of Days"|"Ransom Riggs"
"ap < 09:00"|"almost nine"|"“I’m sure,” I said, and turned away. “It’s almost nine. Let’s pick a car and go.”"|"A Map of Days"|"Ransom Riggs"
12:00|midday|"We passed in and out of small towns, riding mostly in silence, just processing the crazy events of the past day. We were tired, too. Not only had what happened at the motel been emotionally and physically exhausting, but it was late—midday here, but nearly midnight back in the present. To think that we had discovered my grandfather’s safe house that same day was unfathomable. It felt like a lifetime had passed since then."|"A Map of Days"|"Ransom Riggs"

19:35|1935|"We followed him into town. It was all of three blocks from end to end and looked as if had been made entirely, but expertly, by hand, from the houses to the packed-dirt streets to the wooden sidewalks. It was 1935 here, Paul explained, and the loop at Portal had been made in the worst depths of the Great Depression. Despite all that, it was neat as a pin, and everywhere someone could’ve planted flowers or painted a happy color it had been done, and the dozen or so people I saw walking were all dressed to the nines. It was a cheerful, homey place, and I already wished we didn’t have to leave in such a hurry."|"A Map of Days"|"Ransom Riggs"
00:00|midnight|"“I’d make it midnight at noon,” said June. “And turn the overseer into an ass.”"|"A Map of Days"|"Ransom Riggs"

03:30|"three thirty in the morning"|"It was three thirty in the morning and my butt was almost completely numb when we finally reached the exit. I followed directions from my phone to the address printed on H’s matchbook. We had no idea what we’d find there. A gas station? A café? Another motel?"|"A Map of Days"|"Ransom Riggs"
03:30|"three thirty a.m."|"“No,” I said. “But I don’t think he expected us to come at three thirty a.m.”"|"A Map of Days"|"Ransom Riggs"
12:00|midday|"We were marched through a kitchen buzzing with chefs and waiters who pressed themselves against the walls to let us pass, careful never to make eye contact. We walked through a ballroom, through a plush bar that was gloomy at midday but nearly half full with patrons, then up a gilded staircase, to an office."|"A Map of Days"|"Ransom Riggs"
"ap < 06:00"|"Almost six"|"“Gandy’s dead,” Leo repeated. “Then I guess you’ll have to do, junior. What time is it?”
“Almost six,” said Bill.
“We’ll kill him in the morning. Make a thing of it. Invite the troops.”"|"A Map of Days"|"Ransom Riggs"
