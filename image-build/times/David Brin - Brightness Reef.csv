12:00|noon|"A covered walkway linked the dam/factory to the forest, where most villagers dwelled. Fierce sunlight filtered through a canopy of living camouflage. At noon it took an optimist to think the screen would hide the buildings against a resolute scan from space—and among the Six, optimism was viewed as a mild type of heresy."|"Brightness Reef"|"David Brin"
12:00|noon|"It occurred to Sara that she might get a chance to visit a completely different kind of library. One towering over the Biblos cache, the way the noon sun outblazed a candle. What an opportunity! Even if we’re all soon prisoners of the galactic Lords of Migration, destined for some prison world, they can hardly deny us a chance to read!"|"Brightness Reef"|"David Brin"
"~ 12:00"|"Around noon"|"Around noon, a mutter of voices carried up the trail—the day’s first regular pilgrims, making an outward show of reverence while still chattering about the pleasures of Gathering. Lark sighted white-robed figures beyond some vapor fumaroles. The leaders called greetings to Lark’s group, already returning from devotions, and began shuffling aside to give up right of way."|"Brightness Reef"|"David Brin"
12:00|noon|"“Of all utterjeekee things, what could top her scouting ahead at night?” Huck groused. “Urs can’t see in the dark any better’n a glaver can at noon. Oughta let me do it.”"|"Brightness Reef"|"David Brin"
00:00|midnight|"“As you predicted, they desire a meeting. It is arranged for tonight at midnight.”"|"Brightness Reef"|"David Brin"
12:00|noon|"It was fun picturing the look on Jass’s smug handsome face, when the sky over the Gray Hills went dark at noon, and then her words booming from above—"|"Brightness Reef"|"David Brin"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"Ur-ronn started calling out depths from the pressure-bladder gauge. At seven cables she turned a switch, and the eik light came on, casting twin beams into cool, dark waters. I expected those in front to resume their excited exclamations, but apparently there was less to see at this depth. Pincer identified something only every few duras, in a voice that seemed disappointed."|"Brightness Reef"|"David Brin"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"At eleven and a half cables, a sudden chill swept the cabin, causing fog briefly to form. Every hard surface abruptly went damp and Huck cranked up the dehumidifier. I reached out to touch the garuwood hull, which seemed markedly cooler. Wuphon’s Dream turned and tilted slightly, facing a new tug, no longer the same languid downward drift. From soundings, we had known to expect a transition to a deep frigid current. Still, it was unnerving."|"Brightness Reef"|"David Brin"
"~ 00:00"|"Around midnight"|"Around midnight, the party had to ford a wide, shallow stream that flowed through a desert wadi. Always prepared, Ulgor slipped on sealed booties, crossing with dry feet. The other urrish rebels slogged alongside the humans and animals, then dried each other’s legs with rags. After that, the Urunthai seemed eager to run for a while, till the moisture wicked out of their fibrous ankle fur."|"Brightness Reef"|"David Brin"
00:00|midnight|"Rising at midnight, he would scout by the light of two smaller moons, sniffing warily each time the trail of hoofprints neared some plausible ambuscade. Then, at dawn, he would hurry back to help Danel’s donkey train plod ahead by day."|"Brightness Reef"|"David Brin"
"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"Dwer woke to find it already a midura past midnight. Though he felt much better now, he had to fight a languid lethargy to get dressed and check his gear—the bow and quiver, a compass, sketch pad, and hip canteen—then stop by the dim coals to pluck the leaf-wrapped package Jenin left for him each night, the one decent meal he would eat while away."|"Brightness Reef"|"David Brin"
