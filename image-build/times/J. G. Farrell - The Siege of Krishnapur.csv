"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"It
was about noon that the General died. The humming of the native
Christians was the only sound to break the silence. As the afternoon
wore on, the humming was silenced by the great heat; all living
creatures were obliged to crawl into some shade in order to survive.
For a while the silence now became profound at the Residency, as it did
every afternoon. Besides, there was nothing further for the garrison to
do; by now they had made their defences as secure as was possible in
the circumstances. The ladies, having fought polite but ruthless
battles for a place under those punkahs in the billiard room that were
still moving (that is to say, those which still had a native attached
to the other end), lay stretched out on charpoys and mattresses in
their chemises and petticoats like arrangements of wilted flowers,
their faces, necks, and arms shining with perspiration. Flies and
mosquitoes tormented them and they longed for the evening which would
bring, if not coolness, at least a fall in the temperature."|"The Siege of Krishnapur"|"J. G. Farrell"
"ap ~ 03:00"|"About
three o’clock"|"About
three o’clock the deathly silence was broken by a terrible noise of
banging and hammering which startled them awake. It was the native
carpenters knocking together a coffin for the General. The Padre was to
bury him that evening. Towards four o’clock, when the heat had at last
begun to die down a little, the aggrieved humming started up again.
This time it came from a little further away … from outside the
Residency gates, where the native Christians had been moved, each
holding his certificate of loyalty to the Company."|"The Siege of Krishnapur"|"J. G. Farrell"

"ap >> 05:00"|"long after five o’clock"|"Word
of mutiny at the prison and Treasury reached the Residency an hour
before dusk. Not long after five o’clock, when the streets of
Krishnapur were most crowded, a strange clinking sound was heard.
People wondered at first where it was coming from; it seemed to be all
around them. As it grew louder they realized that among the familiar
inhabitants of the town a number of strangers had appeared: they moved
in long lines through the evening crowds, looking neither to right nor
left, moving with a curious, rapid shuffle away from the middle of the
town; presently, it became clear that the sound came from the ankle
chains with which they were shackled. The prison guards had mutinied on
a signal given by the sepoys at Captainganj and had freed their
prisoners."|"The Siege of Krishnapur"|"J. G. Farrell"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"It was nine o’clock and
the heat was becoming unbearable; the chase of the cannon could not be
touched; if a drop of water fell on it from Fleury’s sponge it sizzled
away in an instant. The flagstones shimmered and the lake of blood
where Fleury had slipped had become a sticky brown marsh sucking at
every footstep. Once Fleury trod on something which squashed beneath
his foot and he thought with horror: “Someone’s eye!” He hardly dared
to look down. But it was merely one of the Kabul grapes which Barlow
had been eating."|"The Siege of Krishnapur"|"J. G. Farrell"
"ap > 09:00"|"after nine o’clock"|"Soon after nine o’clock
the Collector set out for the Cutcherry to see how they were getting on
there. He took a cane and a pith helmet; in the buttonhole of his coat
he wore a pink rose which one of the ladies had given him the evening
before. He was pleased with the rose; it helped him to appear calm and
cheerful. Now that the defence of the Residency had begun his main
function must be to keep up the morale of the garrison. With this in
mind he walked over to the Cutcherry as if he were going for a morning
stroll, paying no attention whatsoever to the musket balls which
sometimes droned by. He even paused on the way to inspect the odd
collection of animals that had gathered to shelter from the sun in the
shadow of the Church."|"The Siege of Krishnapur"|"J. G. Farrell"
"ap 02:50"|250|"“How do you judge
distances?” asked Harry disagreeably. “I suppose you all must know
since nobody had any questions.” They all looked chastened so Harry
explained. At 1300 yards good eyesight can distinguish infantry from
cavalry. A single individual detached may be seen at 1000 yards but his
head does not appear as a round ball until 700 yards, at which distance
white cross-belts and white trousers may be seen. At goo yards the face
may be seen as a light coloured spot and limbs, uniform and firelocks
can be made out. At 250 and 200 yards details of body and uniform are
tolerably clear. “Or alternatively, Vokins, you multiply the number of
seconds which elapse between the time of seeing the flash of the
enemy’s musket and hearing the report by 1100 and the product will be
the distance in feet. Have you got that?”"|"The Siege of Krishnapur"|"J. G. Farrell"
12:00|mid-day|"Among the disasters
which multiplied in the enclave during these last days before the
monsoon none came as a more severe blow than the death of Lieutenant
Cutter. He had become a hero for the garrison, for English and native
defenders alike. Many tears were shed, particularly by the younger
ladies, while the Padre made his eloquent funeral oration after the
mid-day service on Sunday the 12 July in the Residency cellars."|"The Siege of Krishnapur"|"J. G. Farrell"
"ap < 05:00"|"Shortly before five
o’clock"|"Shortly before five
o’clock the sepoy cavalry made an attack near the Cutcherry but
fortunately the men had not yet left their positions at the rampart.
The attack was repulsed. The Collector watched this brief engagement in
the dazzling circle of crystal but could no longer understand it. He
saw a sowar hit as he spurred towards the Residency. He saw
the man’s limbs, tightly clenched as he drove his horse towards the
Cutcherry guns, suddenly relax as if something inside him had snapped.
Then he slithered out of sight into the dust."|"The Siege of Krishnapur"|"J. G. Farrell"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"As
night fell, although the Collector became quieter (no doubt thanks to
the laudanum), he remained delirious. The heat was extraordinarily
oppressive. No breath of air stirred the Collector’s mosquito net.
Miriam sat wearily by the window, feeling the perspiration soaking her
neck and breast and the hollow of her back, leaking steadily from her
armpits and from between her legs, and causing her underclothes to
stick to her stomach and thighs. From time to time she crossed the
room, soaked a flannel in the tepid water of a basin, and pressed it
gently against the Collector’s swollen face. At ten o’clock she gave
him beef tea and brandy. But he scarcely seemed to notice any of these
ministrations. He gulped down what he was given but continued muttering
urgently to himself. His daughters, Eliza and Margaret, came to gaze
dutifully at their stricken father. They, too, had taken to helping in
the hospital and Miriam could read on their pale, shocked faces some of
the terrible sights they had seen; after a little while she sent them
away to bed."|"The Siege of Krishnapur"|"J. G. Farrell"
12:00|noon|"One or two of the
bystanders, filled with dread, knowing already that the catastrophe had
occurred but unable to prevent themselves verifying the fact,
discreetly consulted their time-pieces. It was as they thought. The
time was not yet noon."|"The Siege of Krishnapur"|"J. G. Farrell"
"< 00:00"|"A
little before midnight"|"A
little before midnight Miriam, who had been unable to sleep, came over
to see him and tell him the news. Shortly after supper the poor Doctor
had been seized with the tell-tale purging and vomiting. For the sake
of privacy he had been carried, not to his own ward in the hospital,
but to the tiger house next door where Hari and the Prime Minister had
been incarcerated. As people bustled around him the Doctor had
harangued them frantically with all the strength that was left to him.
“It was only water in that medicine bottle I drank from!” he had
protested again and again. “On no account let that charlatan near me!”"|"The Siege of Krishnapur"|"J. G. Farrell"
"~ 10:00"|"about ten o’clock in the morning"|"On 17 September, a
Thursday, at about ten o’clock in the morning, the Collector found
himself in conversation with the Padre. The Collector sat on an oak
throne which had been chipped out of the mud rampart for fuel, but had
not yet been used, though it had lost one of its front legs. The
throne, whose gothic spires rose high above the Collector’s head, had
been placed on a wooden dais at one end of the banqueting hall. Because
of the missing front leg, the Collector had to sit well back and to one
side; even so, he sometimes forgot about it and, waving an arm for
emphasis, narrowly avoided plunging to the floor; this could have
caused him a severe injury since the floor was some way below. The
Collector had sat a good deal in this chair over the past few days and
it had come to affect his habits of thought. He had found that since
the chair discouraged emphasis, it also discouraged strong convictions.
It had once even gone so far as to empty him on to the floor for
voicing an intolerant opinion on the Jesuits. So now he was gradually
coming to see that there were several sides to every question."|"The Siege of Krishnapur"|"J. G. Farrell"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"Fleury dressed rapidly,
thankful not to have fallen a prey to the drinking snakes during the
night, and then breakfasted with Miriam, who had already risen. They
spent the morning together, until it was time for Miriam to dress for a
visit to the Dunstaple ladies. The hours dragged by. Fleury found it
too hot to go outside. He tried to read a book. Miriam had not returned
by four o’clock when Rayne, the Opium Agent, sent one of his servants
over to invite Fleury to tea. From the shade of the verandah Fleury
watched Rayne’s servant hastening up from the depths of the compound
under a black umbrella; once on the verandah he shook it vigorously as
if to shake off drops of sunlight."|"The Siege of Krishnapur"|"J. G. Farrell"
00:00|midnight|"After the glare of the
compound a midnight darkness seemed to prevail on the verandah. A
figure advanced out of the gloom and shook Fleury’s hand, welcoming him
in loud tones which he recognized as belonging to Rayne. Another figure
loomed up, bowed and clicked his heels nearby: this was Burlton who
looked after the Treasury. He seemed to be a sensitive young man,
anxious to please, and laughing excessively at everything Rayne said.
Inside, there was another man, as yet only dimly perceived, who made a
motion of bowing from his chair as he was introduced; at the same time
he laughed sardonically; his name was Ford, one of the railway
engineers. “Always glad to meet a griff,” he drawled."|"The Siege of Krishnapur"|"J. G. Farrell"
