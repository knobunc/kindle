15:00|"3 P.M."|"When I arrived at Alder Creek it wasn’t yet 3 P.M. and already cars, pickups, even bicycles were parked everywhere in the drive and on the grassy lawn. So many! What was Mom thinking of, calling this a family reunion? Scram, Mom’s and Sable’s antic beagle, came rushing at me, barking and sniffing excitedly, tail thumping. The first people I ran into were the Plucketts, hauling enormous watermelons up the drive—Jimmy Ray and Nanci and their three freckle-faced teenagers so alike in appearance I could never tell them apart—but the Plucketts, sunny, good-hearted people, wouldn’t have expected me to remember their names, just called out, all smiles, “Judd, hello! Happy Fourth of July!” The next people I ran into were my gorgeous sister-in-law Vicky, Mrs. Mike Mulvaney Jr. with the caramel-colored hair—very pregnant—again—and her little girl Chrissy, my firstborn niece, for whom my heart always gave a lurch. Vicky cried, “Judd, aren’t you looking handsome!” standing on tiptoe to give me a breathy little kiss, her basketball-belly poking against me, and I lifted Chrissy in my arms with a mock grunt—four years old already, what if she’d forgotten her Uncle Judd she hadn’t seen in a year?—but she hadn’t. And where was Mike?—playing softball, Vicky said, in the goat pasture. And there were damp smeary kiddy-kisses from two-year-old Davy, Mike and Vicky’s other child, and there came rushing at me my sister Marianne in STUMP CREEK HILL yellow T-shirt and shorts, baby Molly Ellen in her arms, and three-year-old Willy toddling behind, and we hugged, and kissed, clutching at each other as always as if in the other’s absence each of us had imagined catastrophes, and these phantoms to be laughed eagerly away, dispelled like bad dreams in daylight, and we exchanged a minute’s quick news, and I saw that Marianne was in the prime of her young womanhood, the color restored to her skin, a fullness to her face, the stress lines eased, the liquidy yearning in the eyes eased, now she was thirty-four years old, and married, and a mother, and a devoted worker at Stump Creek Hill Animal Shelter & Hospital, and her life independent of all Mulvaneys if she should wish it. And what a husband she had!—I didn’t always get along with bluff opinionated Whit West, but I admired him immensely. I asked, “Where’s Whit? I don’t hear him,” and Marianne laughed, poked me reprovingly in the chest, and said, “He’s on the phone. We haven’t been here an hour—have we, Willy?—and already Whit is checking back. He was up late doing emergency surgery on Smoke—remember Smoke?—one of our black bears—an appendectomy. Oh but Judd,” Marianne said, just remembering, “—he’s here, he’s actually here. And he has a girl.” Marianne pointed toward the pasture where a rowdy game of softball was in progress."|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"

His mother Corinne Mulvaney was a devout churchgoer, at this time a member of the South Lebanon United Methodist congregation. Mule went less and less frequently with her and the others to church services now he was older, but still it rubs off on you. You have to know deep in your heart Do unto others as you would they would do unto you is just plain common sense. So he was beginning to get a little scared. Not seriously scared, but a little. Mixing warm Molson with vodka and whiskey didn’t help. After the big party at the MacIntyres’ (this really cool ranch-style house on the golf course) they’d piled into cars and driven six miles out to the funky County Line Tavern, where there was the possibility, unwarranted as it turned out, of some after-hours drinking, and some “girls.” Then word got out that T-T MacIntyre had picked up Della Rae Duncan, the poor bitch was dumb enough and drunk enough to imagine he “liked” her and wanted to be her “steady.” They were in Jamie Klinger’s van, this gang of guys. Cruising Route 119 as far south as the river, then turning back to Mt. Ephraim. Cruising Main Street, where (it’s after 2 A.M.) everything is dead—the Majestic, the Checkerboard Diner. Then into the cemetery off Iroquois. Which was where Frankie Kreigner trailed them. Though not turning into the cemetery but circling the block. Mule Mulvaney was saying, “Maybe we should check them out?—they might be hurting her, or something.” Another time he said, like pleading, “Shit, Della Rae, that poor mutt, that’s like shooting fish in a barrel.” The other guys were divided. Maybe yes, maybe no. There was something exciting about this. Knowing Della Rae was putting out for their buddies, or anyway guessing so. Though they didn’t want to investigate, exactly. Della Rae was a pig and she was smashed out of her skull and you didn’t want to think about it, Mule felt blood rush into his cock like a faucet turned on: hot."|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"

07:30|"7:30 A.M."|"The truth was that Michael Mulvaney, when he’d first met his wife-to-be, was crazy about a girl named Donna whose last name he’d quickly forget but not his wild adventures with her, making love where and whenever they could, often in risky places like the backseat of a stranger’s fancy car, in a just-vacated room at the hotel, on an isolated stretch of beach. This was not an era in which good girls or even not-so-good girls succumbed to sexual pressure from men but Donna (from Glens Falls: “speedcar capital of New York State”) was a notable exception. She too was a college girl, a third-year nursing student at Cornell. Liked to drink and got high—“high” not “drunk” which didn’t sound so good—and meltingly amorous. How could Michael Mulvaney keep sweetly shy Corinne Hausmann in mind, or even, to be frank, remember her name, overwhelmed as he was by Donna? Her supple hips and pelvis, her bold exploring hands, her astonishing mouth that was so ardent, beyond even his lurid ex-Catholic-boy fantasies—Michael was prone to fall into an open-eyed stupor in the midst of work (roofs his specialty, from the start: being short-legged, compact, deft and muscular, with a strong tolerance for working in the sun, had its distinct advantages) contemplating Donna, the night-before and the night-to-come. He was just twenty-three years old and had been living on his own, parentless, family-less, for the past five years. His “real” life. He was a fast, reliable worker but clearly too smart to remain only a worker, you’d naturally give Michael Mulvaney more responsibility than you’d give the rest of the crew who were older, dumber. It helped that he was in peak physical condition (he swam, he dived, loved to show off at the lake) so he could subsist on four or three, occasionally two, one or even no hours of sleep, after a night of drinking and lovemaking with Donna before showering and hurriedly shaving and dressing and beginning the next long, so very long (you had to be at the work site by 7:30 A.M.) workday."|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"

At 12:50 A.M., and Michael not home.
It was late April, after Easter. Corinne was in bed upstairs, propped up with pillows, too anxious to sleep; reading, or trying to read, one of Patrick’s science magazines. Though every cell and nerve ending in her brain quivered with wakefulness, she could not concentrate on a passage she’d read, reread how many times…. No evidence either in the living world of today or of past geological epochs for a continuous transition of species…what we actually find are separate and well-distinguished species…intermediate stages from one species to another which should be found…are not met with. The worlds of organisms, living and extinct, do not represent a continuum but a discontinuum…. Certain conditions of stability exist notonly for the individual genes but also for genomes…. A “species” represents a state in which a harmoniously stabilized “genetic balance” has been established, that is… Thinking of Marianne who was so deeply unhappy at school. Yet never spoke of it. Poor Marianne with so few friends now, few telephone calls, and all that visiting the girls had done back and forth at one another’s houses—suddenly, for Marianne, all that had ceased as if it had never been. She’d quit the cheerleading squad, rarely attended club meetings or her Christian Youth meetings. Her grades had dropped to C’s but seemed to have levelled off. She was happiest at church, so far as Corinne could judge. Singing hymns in her thin, sweet soprano voice—“Rock of Ages,” Corinne’s favorite hymn of all time, was Marianne’s, too. It was the only public place she felt comfortable: the First Church of Christ of South Lebanon was a one-room foursquare white-shingled church miles from Mt. Ephraim; the congregation was mostly country people; no one knew the Mulvaneys except as relatively new churchgoers, Corinne Mulvaney and her three children. Corinne drove to church in the mud-splattered rust-speckled Buick station wagon with the bumper sticker 4-H: HEAD HEART HANDS HEALTH and, on a rear window, a frayed decal FUTURE FARMERS OF AMERICA 1974. No one would have judged her the wife of a prosperous businessman, or, maybe, anyone’s wife at all. If there was a Mr. Mulvaney, no one had ever sighted him in South Lebanon, nor would."|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
01:25|"1:25 A.M."|"So Corinne drove to Wolf’s Head Lake, arrived at 1:25 A.M. in hastily thrown-on jeans, sweatshirt, sneakers without socks. She had not so much as glanced at herself in a mirror, hadn’t had time to splash water onto her face or drag a comb through her hair, rushing off, calling to the children (of course, they’d been awakened—or had they been asleep, at all, waiting too for the telephone to ring?) that things were all right, their dad was all right, at Wolf’s Head Lake and she was going to get him."|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
03:00|"3 A.M."|"They lay together exhausted. Only partly undressed, their shoes off. Not in, but on top of, the dank-smelling bed that was hardly more than a cot, pushed into the corner of the cramped little room. Michael’s left eye had swollen almost shut and promised to be luridly blackened. There were cuts in his eyebrows, his upper lip was swollen, the color of an overripe plum. His knuckles, too, were skinned and swollen. A jittery sobriety had overtaken him by 3 A.M. just as Corinne sank toward sleep. “Jesus, honey, I’m sorry!” Michael murmured. Corinne murmured, “Well.” She was holding him in a way she’d held him frequently, after lovemaking, in the early years of their marriage: her arm slipped beneath his heavy shoulders, his head on her shoulder, his arm slung across her. Seen from above, they would appear to be huddling together like dazed and desperate children. With an air of dogged incredulity that seemed genuine Michael was saying, “—just don’t know what happened.” Corinne said, taking the tone she’d taken with Patrick, “It isn’t what happened, Michael, it’s what you’ve done.” The schoolmarmish edge was a way of keeping herself from more tears, or worse than tears. Adrenaline had pumped through her veins for a long time and was beginning now to wane and Corinne knew that, when it did, if she wasn’t safely unconscious, she would be washed out, despairing."|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"

The ceremony was set to begin promptly at 11 A.M. at the school and, to our relief, Patrick did appear downstairs in his cap and gown, and he’d apparently prepared a speech, on a long sheet of yellow scrap paper carelessly folded and stuffed into his trouser pocket. Mom asked what the title was and Patrick just shrugged. He might have been embarrassed, or nervous; the skin beneath his eyes had a sallow, shadowy cast, as if he’d been awake much of the night. He gave off a sourish-acrid odor as if his sweat had a chemical component, reacting against the fine-knit dark wool of the absurd ankle-length gown that fitted his lanky frame loose as a tent. Patrick insisted upon driving to the school an hour before the rest of us, saying he had last-minute work to do on his speech. “But why can’t we ride together? Aren’t we a family?” Mom shouted after him, perplexed and annoyed."|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"

Again Mr. Hendrie appeared, greeting the packed assemblage ebulliently, and the band shifted to the national anthem and we rose to our feet and sang, some of us, loudly and happily, though others stood silent, for there are always those others in our noisy happy midst, waiting for whatever it is, to end. Next, a “moment of silence” presided over by a local Unitarian minister. Then the Mt. Ephraim High anthem, words spliced to the vigorous “John Brown’s Body,” led by the school’s choir director. Again, we were all enjoined to sing. Mr. Hendrie returned to the podium and introduced Coach Hansen, a popular Mt. Ephraim presence, who began, amid applause, laughter, and whistles, to read off the names of prizewinners of the senior class in various categories—numerous prizewinners, in numerous categories. The auditorium had grown warm, people were fanning themselves with their programs. Ventilators were turned up, rattling and vibrating. I saw that Dad’s putty-colored face was slick with sweat. The program had slipped from his fingers to the floor. He was sitting on the aisle, Mom between us, Mom straight and alert staring at the stage, a fixed smile on her face. Can’t we be proud? Don’t we deserve this, this day of pride? He’s our son!—our son! I seem to have heard these words through one of the vents of our house earlier that morning. Mom’s hushed, sibilant voice, and no voice responding. Dad must have murmured something, some words, in Mom’s ear, before rising shakily to his feet and turning to slip away—suddenly he was gone, up the aisle and through a rear door and gone, his seat empty. (Gone where? To the men’s room, and he’d be right back? Outside on the front steps, for a quick cigarette? Out to the car in the parking lot, where just maybe he had a bottle hidden in the trunk?) Mom continued to sit very straight, head uplifted, proud profile, white pearl button earrings, polka-dot silk dress, shining eyes fixed upon the stage in defiance of Mr. Mulvaney’s abrupt departure.

And helping to record data of such exacting minuteness, Patrick felt, as he often felt in the midst of such experiments, which were essentially the counting of microbe cells with a high-tech hemocytometer, as if he were an intruder in a world that, if he descended into it for a split second, would devour him rapaciously, reducing him to mere chemicals and a throbbing current called “life.” Gazing through the powerful microscope he had to look up frequently, to break the spell; to escape a vertiginous sensation that was part dread, and part longing."|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"

What would she think, that Patrick had forgotten her after all? He’d told her not to take a taxi, not to spend the money, he wanted to pick her up, he’d be there."|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"

Thinking just possibly he’d gotten the time wrong and Marianne was only now due, 6 P.M.?—but she wasn’t here, wasn’t anywhere. He stared grimly as a northbound bus, up from Binghamton en route to Syracuse, discharged passengers. All strangers. The Erie, Pennsylvania bus, with its Kilburn connection, had obviously come and gone an hour ago. Patrick saw an Ithaca patrolman talking with a security guard and approached them to ask if they’d seen Marianne but at the last moment he passed on by, he was too confused. He could not think how to describe his sister! His mind had gone blank and his last clear memory of her was of the radiantly smiling cheerleader in the maroon jumper and long-sleeved perfectly starched white cotton blouse, eyes shining, curly-brown hair bouncing as in an advertisement for American happiness itself. “Button” Mulvaney. Immortalized on Mom’s bulletin board."|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
17:05|"5:05 P.M."|"Patrick pushed through the swinging doors into the waiting room another time and to the ticket counter. Asked the severely frowning middle-aged woman behind the counter if she’d happened to see a girl come into the waiting room, after the 5:05 P.M., bus from Erie? A girl about nineteen? The woman said no, not that she recalled, with a shrug of one shoulder to indicate she wasn’t trying very hard to recall, Patrick’s question was naive. “Well, she’d look younger, I guess,” Patrick said, faltering. “My sister. But she doesn’t look much like me, she’s sort of—” Again his mind went blank. It was like a blackboard carelessly erased, by hand. The ticket-counter woman shook her head, whether meaning “no” or in bemused pity of Patrick who was visibly perspiring, glasses sliding down his nose."|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"

Hey Mari-anne! Who’s seen Mari-anne! Telephone for Mari-anne! and he’d shut his eyes tight bitterly resenting this stranger who so familiarly called his sister’s name; resisting the impulse to imagine her life there amid young and presumably attractive, idealistic men and women like herself, in the Co-op’s residence which Marianne had described to Patrick as a big old ramshackle inn with several greenhouses, two acres of good rich soil where they grew their own vegetables, communally-owned cars and a pickup truck. The residence, in “condemned condition,” had been bought by Kilburn College, then leased to the Co-op for a token payment, one hundred dollars yearly; the Co-op members had repaired it, furnished it, made it “like home.” No, Patrick didn’t want to call the Green Isle Co-op just now."|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"

His lips moved silently. Marianne. Marianne! He should have sought out Zachary Lundt, long ago, and killed him. In his fantasy, a smart-boy A-student fantasy, he’d force his sister’s rapist to swallow poison—Lysol: flaming agony, mouth, esophagus, stomach, liver. It would look like suicide! And not detectable, as the hydrogen sulfide stink bomb, the proudest project of Patrick Mulvaney’s high school career, had not been detected, so far as he knew. (No, Patrick hadn’t made any inquiries about who the prankster might be. That was what guilty parties always did: couldn’t resist. But Patrick, who was smarter than smart, could resist, for all his life. Just watch!) Weak, breathless, he leaned against the badly scratched wall of lockers, too shaky to continue pacing yet not wanting to sit down amid the shabby, torn plastic seats and relinquish his advantage which was the advantage of height. But his left eye, which always betrayed him, was dimming with fatigue. The day had begun so long ago, in a rainy, snow-gritty twilight before dawn, in dreams in which Marianne and his Biology of Organisms lab were mixed together—he could scarcely remember. Awake before dawn in his third-floor room in the stucco house on Cook Street, waking beneath the eaves of his dormer bedroom, as at High Point Farm, his quick-pulsing nerved-up body waking him in lieu of an alarm. Sometimes in this strange place in Ithaca hundreds of miles from home he heard in his sleep a rooster crowing, and another rooster crowing in reply. Now it was spring, the early-morning cries of red-winged blackbirds, cardinals. And Wake up kiddos! Wake-up time kiddos! and Mom’s friendly whistle. Smelled frying bacon, for always Mom insisted upon good, solid, hot breakfasts, no going with just cereal dumped in a bowl, breakfast was the most important meal of the day Mom and Dad both insisted. He’d hear the dogs’ toenails excitedly clicking on the kitchen floor as quickly he descended the stairs, Mom whistling to Feathers who trilled and warbled in return. And that damned radio station, out of Yewville, the announcer Mom swore by, her favorite. And Marianne would be downstairs already in the kitchen helping Mom get breakfast on the table, the two of them talking and laughing together, almost if he shut his eyes very tight he could see her: his lost sister."|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
"ap 01:14"|114|"Cook Street, in heterogeneous Collegetown, near an edge of the gigantic Cornell campus, was one of Ithaca’s numerous steep-banked streets: Patrick estimated it at about seventy degrees. His two-room apartment at 114 Cook was at the top of a moldering stucco house long ago partitioned into “apartments” for students, mainly foreign graduate students. Patrick had moved there the previous summer, from an even shabbier place on College Avenue. His fellow tenants were all young men, from India, China, Pakistan, studying science or engineering; they were as fanatic as he about work and quiet, shyly friendly with him but not inquisitive—not very real to Patrick as, he guessed, he wasn’t very real to them. Patrick might have lived more conveniently in a residence hall on campus, within closer walking distance of his classes, but he valued privacy, relative isolation. And he couldn’t tolerate his fellow undergraduates’ juvenile behavior, noise at all hours, binge-drinking, vomiting and brawling, ceaseless rock music."|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"Seeing Marianne’s quizzical smile, Patrick quickly added that he didn’t always work, of course. He had a few friends, he’d gone out with a few girls. No one special, but—he didn’t always work. Sometimes when he got restless he went running—across Cascadilla Creek and down Central Avenue below the hill and over to Fall Creek, to the gorge (he would show her the gorge tomorrow: the famous suspension bridge from which suicidal students threw themselves) and across and around Lake Beebe and back to Cook Street—how many miles, he didn’t know. He ran in a kind of trance, his mind stilled. In rapid motion, his body seemed to catch up with his metabolism, he felt right. And he didn’t mind bad weather—“Reminds me of home.” Other nights he’d go downtown, to State Street, where there was a cheap movie house, old and crummy and smelling of rancid popcorn, he’d see whatever was playing, the last show ended after midnight and he’d return home and work for maybe another hour or two—by the time he hiked up from State Street, the movie would have faded from his consciousness. He loved how unreal movies were, like certain people."|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"

And glancing around to check out who’s here, twelve, fifteen men approximately, at the bar and in the booths, all familiar faces, and there’s Ben Breuer in one of the red-leather booths, and Charley MacIntyre, the two exchanging a quick startled glance—a look of warning, caution passing between them—and there’s a third man, his back to Michael, Michael doesn’t recognize at first then sees it’s Gerry Kirkland, the district court judge. Kirkland is about sixty, solidly built, with a square-ruddy face creased from a career of hard smiling. His hair, the color of pewter, is thinning patchily at the crown exactly like Michael Mulvaney’s. Michael knows Kirkland from the Club mainly, just well enough to shake the man’s hand, exchange friendly greetings and inquiries after their respective families. Michael always asks after Jeannette Kirkland and in turn Kirkland asks after—is it Carol? Coralee?—never can quite remember Corinne Mulvaney’s name, and why is that?

First thing he asked was, ‘D’you think anyone else is on the line?” and I’m surprised as hell, I say, “What? Who?”—because it could only be Mom or Dad, as far as Patrick would know. (He couldn’t have known that Dad was in Marsena on business, staying the night.) So right away Patrick backs off a little, saying he just wanted to be sure.

But now if it’s just Mom and me not knowing for sure when Dad might show up we don’t exactly sit down at the table as in the old days because Mom says it makes us nervous, as Mom says it’s just as easy to eat standing up or somewhere not the kitchen at all. This is about 6:30 P.M. and the phone rings and Mom answers quick and worried as she does when Dad’s out but—it’s Patrick!—and I hear her talking with him—talking and laughing—for ten, fifteen minutes! Trying not to eavesdrop, hanging around the kitchen with the dogs and cats nudging their heads against my legs and it’s amazing to me how Mom and Patrick seem to be talking, Mom so relaxed telling Patrick about her latest plans for “expanding” High Point Antiques so that she can bring in serious income, now that Dad is negotiating to sell his property in Mt. Ephraim and “relocate” the business in Marsena and of course they’d be selling the farm—“relocating”—maybe Patrick had heard of the Marsena Antique & Flea Market at the fairgrounds there, every weekend in good weather? one of the oldest and largest markets in the Valley? antique dealers and well-to-do customers come from as far away as Rochester, Port Oriskany, Buffalo? And—"|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
"ap 03:40"|"Three hours and forty minutes"|"Three hours and forty minutes driving to Kilburn in the extreme southwest corner of New York State, most of the trip along two-lane country highways (sometime stuck behind snowplows moving at twenty miles per hour); almost that long again, driving back home that evening. Mom was anxious about staying overnight in Kilburn—“At this time of year, you can’t tell what the weather might do.” It was a snowy windswept landscape, the air bright and glittering with cold. No immediate snow was predicted but Mom envisioned the two of us snowbound in Kilburn, trapped until the spring thaw."|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
11:20|"11:20 A.M."|"The former inn, painted mint-green with white trim, that was the Green Isle Co-op hadn’t changed much since Mom’s and my last visit. There were Christmas decorations in all the windows and, in the front room which was a combination parlor and office, a lopsided evergreen tree trimmed with handmade paper, tinsel, and cloth ornaments in primary colors. The mood of the Co-op at 11:20 A.M. of a weekday was busy, bustling, even frantic—people rushing about, up and down the stairs, a telephone ringing and a dog barking excitedly. This was an atmosphere hospitable to my mother who wandered inside, smiling and calling, “Marianne? Marianne?” until someone yelled, “Marianne! Visitors!” and Marianne appeared out of the rear of the house where she’d been working in the kitchen, wiping her hands on her apron. She wore baggy khaki pants, a red-plaid flannel shirt with sleeves rolled to the elbows, an oversized stained apron. When Marianne and Mom hugged they began to cry in a soundless way you’d almost mistake for laughter; then Marianne hugged me, her thin, surprisingly strong arms around me as I stood self-conscious, embarrassed—a clumsy kid of sixteen not knowing what to do or say. “My goodness, Judd, you keep growing! You’ve actually grown inches!” Marianne cried breathlessly. Her bones seemed light as a sparrow’s and her hair was cut shorter than mine; her skin looked sallow, grainy. But her eyes, glistening with tears, were my sister’s beautiful eyes—I almost couldn’t bear to look into."|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
12:00|midday|"Marianne had to hurry downstairs to finish preparing the midday meal, as it was called, where we’d be guests of course, but before she rushed off Mom explained awkwardly that we wouldn’t be staying the night in Kilburn and Marianne said, hurt, “Oh, but I thought—you were planning to, this time? There’s a choral concert some of us are singing in—at my church—I told the minister my mom and brother were coming, and—” Mom said hurriedly, “Yes, honey, but it’s the weather, you know—you just don’t know what weather this time of year will do. And, well—” her voice faltered, her eyes searched Marianne’s face, “—we’re expected back home tonight.”"|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
12:00|noon|"Promptly at noon a gong sounded and Mom and I trooped downstairs and into the dining room for a cheerful, noisy, confused meal at a long table with as many as twenty-five people (their numbers kept shifting as people arrived, departed). Marianne introduced Mom and me and one by one around the table the members of the Co-op gave their names and said “Welcome!” and “Happy holidays!” Even as these smiling strangers, young men and women in their twenties, called out their names, I was forgetting their names, awkwardly self-conscious in their midst. They were so friendly. They were so inquisitive. Mom was in her element in such boisterous company, jumping up every few minutes to accompany Marianne back into the kitchen, insisting upon helping serve the meal even as others cried, “No, no! Mrs. Mulvaney, you’re a guest.” Mom basked in the attention, loving every moment. It was clear that Marianne was much liked by her friends but she seemed oddly shy; it would have been easy to overlook her. But not Mom, who announced to the table, “When I was a young mother, mealtimes at our house—we have a farm, in Mt. Ephraim—maybe Marianne told you—were wild, I mean wild. At harvesttime there’d be as many at my table as—right here! We had our own babies of course and visitors would come to the farm with their babies and I remember one Sunday supper we had three high chairs at the table—or was it four, Marianne?” Laughing then, slapping her hand against her forehead like a TV comic, “Oh!—Marianne wouldn’t know, she was one of the babies.”"|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"

12:00|midday|"It wasn’t a thought I could hold on to. The table was being cleared for dessert, platters of date-nut brownies (baked by Marianne that morning) were being brought in, pots of herbal tea. And Abelove, the Co-op director, had just hurried in, late for the midday meal, no time for the midday meal, but taking time to shake hands with Marianne’s mom and kid brother—“Welcome to Kilburn! Great to see you!” Abelove was like one of our teachers at the high school, a youngish guy exuding “personality.” He was in his mid-thirties maybe, stockily built, a round head and thick neck and pale blond hair, goatee and shimmering locks to his shoulders like a blond Jesus Christ. The kind of guy you resent like hell until he singles you out for attention, lets his hand fall on your shoulder (as he did with me calling me “Judd” as if we were old friends, and equals), at which point you melt and go crazy for him. When he praised Marianne for her “tireless spirit of optimism” in the Co-op I saw my sister’s eyes film over with tears of gratitude."|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
00:00|midnight|"Coatless in the thin, freezing wind, her eyes shifting, Marianne kissed us good-bye, hugged us and wept and made us promise we’d stay overnight next time we visited Kilburn, by then the weather would have turned warm. I’d slid behind the wheel of Mom’s Buick station wagon which was looking kind of grim these days, rust-flecked, low-slung, one of the rear windows mended with masking tape. I was impatient to get out of Kilburn: the sky had darkened in rapid, shifting patches, like a jammed-up ice floe. By the time we reached the foothills of the Chautauquas and twisty-treacherous High Point Road, it would be dark as midnight. Marianne was asking Mom another time to please say hello to Dad, and give him her love, and tell him she was thinking of him all the time; and the same to all the animals! And—did Muffin look all right? or did he look, maybe, a little thin? and Mom said brusquely, “When cats age their kidneys start to fail, you know that. Toxins build up in them and they lose their appetites, even the big, husky eaters, and they lose weight and you’ll have to be realistic, Marianne. Muffin isn’t a young cat any longer. He must be—how old?”"|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
03:10|"3:10 A.M."|"Weather? I listened: wind. Possibly snow. It was 3:10 A.M. and I was speaking to Patrick ninety miles away on the phone in the family room, in the dark and with the door shut and Troy sleeping and wheezing contentedly at my feet. Upstairs, Mom was sleeping. She’d taken a long hot bath at eleven and I was pretty sure she was sleeping. I didn’t know Dad’s exact or even approximate whereabouts but I reasoned that if he drove up the driveway his headlights would precede him and I’d have no trouble escaping back upstairs to my room."|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"

17:00|"five in the afternoon"|"At the end of March, from a public telephone in Ithaca, Patrick called the Lundts, in Mt. Ephraim. It was five in the afternoon of a weekday. A woman answered on the fourth ring. Patrick introduced himself as a high school friend of Zachary’s, naming a name (“Don Maitland”) that might sound plausible to Mrs. Lundt, for there was in fact a “Don Maitland” who’d been on the periphery of Zachary’s circle, and Patrick guessed the young men wouldn’t be in contact, not after several years. Patrick asked for Zachary’s address, telephone number, and so forth, and Mrs. Lundt provided the information readily enough, yes he was at SUNY Binghamton, yes studying business administration, no he wouldn’t be graduating this year he’d taken a couple of semesters off but he was serious now, working very hard and she and her husband expected Zachary to get his degree possibly as early as next spring. Mrs. Lundt was pleasant-voiced, polite enough to ask “Don Maitland” how he was, what he was doing, and Patrick provided a plausible response, “Don Maitland” too had dropped out of school for a while but was back now, at Oswego Tech, studying electrical engineering. He asked, “Will Zachary be home over spring break? Around Easter?” and Mrs. Lundt said, “Certainly, yes,” and Patrick said, “Great! Us guys can all get together, then, like last time,” and Mrs. Lundt said, with a mild motherly laugh, “I’m sure you will.”"|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"

Rain blown against his windows, a chilly draft from the window now that it was April and Patrick had removed the masking tape he’d been using as insulation. Now it was officially nearing spring, the landlord at 114 Cook was more grudging with heat; Patrick’s room was as cold as if it were winter. Yet he’d been sweating in his sleep, in such terror of being suffocated. He wiped at his eyes imagining lashes were stuck together with black muck.

23:00|"eleven that night"|"Sitting now, at eleven that night, moon-bright Saturday eve of Easter Sunday, in his Jeep at the rear of the crowded parking lot of Cobb’s Corner Inn where Zachary Lundt and three of his high school buddies had been for the past forty minutes. The Jeep’s motor was off, no headlights. Beside Patrick on the passenger’s seat, hidden by a strip of canvas should anyone pass close enough to glance inside (but no one did, or would: Patrick had parked just far enough away from other vehicles, partly on the grass) were Mike’s. 22-caliber Winchester rifle, several yards of rope, a roll of black duct tape, a powerful flashlight and a fishing knife with a double-edged eight-inch blade acquired at a Sears in Whitney Point, New York weeks before. Except for the rifle all were anonymous items, randomly and anonymously purchased."|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"Patrick knew that Zachary Lundt was at Cobb’s. An hour before he’d telephoned the Lundts to learn the whereabouts of his friend Zach, “Don Maitland” just home from Owego, or was it Oswego, eager to join his friends for the evening, and Mrs. Lundt who’d answered the phone in a girlish voice had seemed to remember him, or maybe hadn’t, in any case provided the information Patrick needed. Later, maybe the rest of her life she’d regret it but—who could have known, at the time? We never suspected. How would we have suspected! Mrs. Lundt had told him Cobb’s Corner at ten, asked if he knew where that was, and Patrick said, “Know where Cobb’s Corner is? Hell, Mrs. Lundt, everybody knows that.”"|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
00:10|"12:10 A.M."|"At 12:10 A.M. at last Zachary and his friends appeared, leaving Cobb’s by the side door. Beneath the lights of a concrete walkway bordered by crude stucco latticework. The young men stood talking and laughing before going to their cars—Patrick might have picked them off one by one. How unsuspecting they were, unknowing. Oblivious of danger. Patrick thought of the fantastic wingless birds of New Zealand that had intrigued the young Charles Darwin. No mammal predators for millennia—a heaven of birds, of countless species. As if all of creation were exclusively birds, yet birds not birds—unable to fly, helpless against predators when predators arrived. Easy prey."|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
08:00|"8 A.M."|"Well, she’d signed up for the course, anyway. “Introduction to English Literature”—required for all teachers’ ed. majors. What with one emergency at the Co-op (there was poor hair-straggling-in-her-face Val Allan desperate because she had baking duties all day, dozens of cherry tarts to prepare on order, and an exam at 8 A.M. the next morning, so naturally Marianne volunteered to make the tarts though she herself had a term paper due in forty-eight hours) or another (there was Abelove’s perpetually frantic assistant Birk rushing about looking for someone to help him deliver crates of fresh produce to the Pennysaver Food Mart at the Kilburn Shopping Center—something had happened to whoever was scheduled to help him, it was an emergency situation and naturally Marianne volunteered though she’d set aside a precious morning for schoolwork which was weeks behind) it didn’t look promising that she’d complete the course, let alone get a decent grade in it. Her professor had called her in for a conference, he’d expressed concern she’d missed so many lectures, warned her she’d have to get a “high, solid A” on the final just to get a C in the course, and Marianne had stared at the floor, shamefaced and tongue-tied. She wanted to say Oh but this isn’t like me really. In high school I never missed any classes. I did all the work and my grades were A’s and B’s and I was never scolded, never. Instead she murmured a whispery apology and slunk away in disgrace."|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
05:30|"5:30 A.M."|"Returning sometimes to the house, to her room, in the afternoon, so tired! her head spinning! especially if it was a day spent clerking in town at the store, where the cash register’s ring-ring-ring-ringing wore her out, having wakened at 5:30 A.M. and by 5:30 P.M. exhausted, about to fall sleep on her feet, but it was a normal tiredness she supposed, a healthy tiredness, preventing her thoughts from flying off in the wrong direction. Despite the commotion in the house at this hour of day, raised voices, footsteps pounding the stairs, telephone ringing and dog barking, Marianne would gather up Muffin and slip beneath her quilt on her bed, curl up luxuriantly to sleep, twenty minutes was all she required, or only ten. Only five! Cradling the soft-furred lanky cat in her arms and pressing her cheek against his side so that his deep resonant purr entered her being, thrummed along her nerves and quieted them. Within seconds she was deeply and dreamlessly asleep."|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"

12:00|midday|"At midday meal of the bulletin board’s first day, when Marianne came rushing breathlessly into the dining room, she was greeted with applause from all her friends. And there was Abelove at the head of the table, rising to toast her—with a glass of Green Isle Elderberry Wine (nonalcoholic). “To Mari-anne Mul-van-ey. Expediter par excellence.”"|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"“The funeral is Thursday at eleven, as I’ve said. At their church.” A pause. An intake of breath. “But your mother doesn’t want you to attend, I’m afraid.”"|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
06:00|"6:00 A.M."|"So it happened that Marianne slipped away, at 6:00 A.M. of an overcast May morning, to be driven to Ransomville, to Ida Hausmann’s funeral to which she was not invited, riding with Hewie the Co-op carpenter in his big old battered-plum boat of a 1969 Dodge. Did she imagine it?—a vague impression of someone peering at them out of a downstairs window of the house."|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
11:00|"11 A.M."|"So by 11 A.M., at about the midpoint of what would have been the exam, she found herself three hundred miles away in rural Ransomville, west of Mt. Ephraim in the Chautauqua Valley. Thank God, Hewie wasn’t a talker! Nor a questioner! He was a taciturn young man with brooding dark eyes and a chronic downturned mouth, usually unshaven, like the elusive Birk a Green Isle member who’d been taking courses at Kilburn State for years, nowhere near graduating. There were things whispered of Hewie that Marianne hadn’t heard, nor cared to hear. She didn’t believe in gossip. She’d warned Hewie at the start of their trip, “I might be—oh, I don’t know—behaving kind of—strangely. It’s my grandmother dying and this funeral and—you know. I hope—you won’t judge me harshly?” Hewie stared at Marianne as if he hadn’t heard correctly. He muttered, almost inaudibly, with a scowl, “Hell, I wouldn’t judge you at all, Marianne.” He seemed annoyed at the suggestion."|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
11:00|"11 A.M."|"By 11 A.M. the wind had been blowing boiled-looking clouds across the sky in a vivid procession and it had turned into a mild, fragrant, dazed sort of spring day. At least Marianne felt dazed. Staring avidly at everything she saw, rubbing her eyes to see if her vision was real. Why, she hadn’t been in Ransomville for—four years? Yet the little crossroads town seemed unchanged, same two-pump gas station, convenience store and tackle shop combined, a teenager’s long-faded sign NIGHT CRAWLLERS BARGINS! The same post office–volunteer firemen’s building, the same elevated railroad tracks, several wood-frame churches, surrounding farmland. The two-lane blacktop highway leading out into the country, to the remote Hausmann farm, was more cracked and potholed than Marianne recalled. And where was the Lutheran church, hadn’t it been at a fork in the road? How many miles from town?"|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
00:00|midnight|"So strange, and distressing—about Patrick. He’d telephoned her just after Easter, the previous month, a midnight call when Marianne was groggy with exhaustion, wakened by Felice-Marie for this “emergency” call from her brother, and she’d been scarcely able to comprehend Patrick’s excited rushed words, let alone what they meant. He wanted her to know, he said, that justice had been executed; and that he was dropping out of Cornell before graduating, he’d decided not to go to graduate school just yet but to forestall making any decisions about the future. He was going to travel, he said—maybe the Southwest, the Rocky Mountains. Marianne listened in horror. She’d stammered Yes but Patrick aren’t I coming to your graduation? Aren’t all the Mulvaneys coming to your graduation? I’ve got May 30 marked on my calendar, oh Patrick wait—"|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
00:00|midnight|"But Marianne had made an effort to improve her usual appearance for the occasion of Grandmother Hausmann’s funeral—surely Corinne would note, and appreciate, that? She’d shampooed her hair until it shone, scrubbed her hands and dug dirt out from beneath her broken-off nails, soaked in the big claw-footed tub on the top floor of the Co-op (not much used, you had to scour the tub with steel wool afterward to remove the stains, no one had time for anything much except showers) until she was clean, clean, clean. For the first time in a long time. (Except now, nervous as a cat, sweating—what a sight she probably looked!) On her head, not exactly straight, was a wide-brimmed black straw hat with a crinkly black straw band from the Second-Time-’Round Shop in Kilburn, and from the same shop an ankle-length long-sleeved waistless dress of a similar soft-crinkly fabric, midnight blue that could pass for the black of mourning. Unfortunately the dress was too large for her and had a dipping boat-neck that showed her sharp collarbone so, inspired, in haste, she’d wrapped a strip of black velvet around her throat with a tiny glass ruby pasted on it—a “touch,” Amethyst insisted, the dress badly needed. On her feet were a pair of black “ballerina flats” and she wore gauzy black-mesh knee-length stockings. Seeing Marianne rush downstairs that morning, where he was already waiting, Hewie glanced up at her startled, his downturned mouth actually dropping, as if he’d never set eyes on such a person before."|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
06:00|"6 A.M."|"I don’t want to misrepresent my father. There were days when he didn’t drink much, or in any case didn’t show the effects of drinking. Which were for him an anesthetized glare, on the edge of belligerence but lacking the energy to cross over. He’d come home exhausted, too tired to eat, crack a can or two of ale and drain them in a few minutes, fall into bed—and be up again the next morning by 6 A.M. He was a good man in his heart but stymied, frenzied, like a creature poked by spears, upright and flailing in a corner. If you got too close, to console, or hope to be consoled, you might be hurt."|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
22:00|"10 P.M."|"I carried the rifle back to High Point Farm, smuggled it into the house and back to Dad’s cabinet, locked the cabinet door. I was desperate to hear from Patrick what had happened, but he didn’t call until 10 P.M. that night, from Ithaca; and then he said only, tersely, “It’s over—justice has been executed.”"|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
"~ 22:00"|"around 10 P.M."|"Dad missed supper that evening, didn’t call to explain why, arrived home around 10 P.M. sullen and heavy-footed and in no mood for surprises. He’d seen, of course, that the Buick was missing from the driveway and naturally he wasn’t happy about it. I heard him and Mom discussing the problem, calmly enough at first and then with more urgency as Dad’s voice rose in volume with a beat like chopping wood. Don’t listen. Stay out of it. He can’t seriously blame her—can he? I was in “my” room at a back corner of the house, a room approximately the size of the old claw-footed bathtub we’d had at the farm, and I’d pushed my windows up as far as they could go so the exterior night seemed to be in. I was sprawled on my bed listening to a radio turned low and leafing through some paperbacks I’d brought home—“borrowed”—from the Miracle Mart where I worked four afternoons a week—a handbook Backpacking in the Mountains: A Personal Odyssey, a “pictorial biography” of John F. Kennedy, Lovejoy’s College Guide. That was the way I read most things—three or four at once. Even Patrick’s science magazines and books I’d appropriated, I was too restless and my mind too scattered to focus on just one. Even The Selected Poems of Penelope Hagström I’d looked into and agreed with Mom they were hard to understand but impressive and who knows?—maybe even profound."|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
"ap > 09:00"|"Past nine o’clock"|"So they argued for a while. Past nine o’clock and the sky was still riddled with light like pale capillaries in dark-bruised flesh. The dad who was in fact Michael Mulvaney, his own independent person and not just the father of some pack of kids, was mumbling he had a friend to meet up the street, had to leave, but thanks for the meal, son—“We’ll have to get together more often.” This made Mike laugh as if it were meant to be witty, a TV gag line. He’d taken out his wallet, was offering the ravaged old dad some bills, and the dad was protesting, “No! No thanks, son,” almost convincingly, “—you’re an old married man now, soon there’ll be babies and you’ll need all the money you can get.” Breaking off then to cough, as if coughing were a signal of sincerity, but there was a cigarette in his fingers and he’d inhaled wrong and the coughing veered out of control. This is how you’ll die the bulletin came puking up your lung-tissue. But Mike was insisting that his dad accept the money, the kid’s big-boned handsome face dark with blood and eyes glistening with misery. Maybe they’d decided all this beforehand? Life was trickier than TV, it seemed so often to be veering in the wrong direction, yet sometimes it veered in the right direction as if by accident. Certainly it was the case, the ravaged old dad couldn’t deny it, he needed to purchase some new, decent clothes, also shoes, have his hair professionally cut and not hacked with a scissors by a shaky-handed woman friend, yes and check into a clinic—promise? “Well, maybe—” he assented, seeing the logic of it, from the son’s perspective at least. Giving in then and the son in the tall muscled Marine-body slipped cash into his shyly opened hand."|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
09:00|"9 A.M."|"And Penelope Hagström, certainly, was a remarkable, even an extraordinary woman. A poet—a true lover of poetry—who could recite poems of Keats, Shelley, Dickinson, Yeats, Frost in a way that thrilled Marianne to hear. (Marianne was frequently invited to share meals with the lonely woman, and it was at such times that Penelope Hagström recited those poems she considered “luminous—illuminating to the soul.”) Now in her early sixties, Miss Hagström had been wheelchair-bound for many years, though her multiple sclerosis seemed to be in remission at the present time. She had a ravaged, hawkish, rather noble face, her graying hair parted in the center and drawn back severely into a chignon—“My Emily Dickinson look, the best we plain girls can hope for.” She was surprisingly robust in appearance, from the hips up, with an ample bosom, shoulders, arms; if you couldn’t discern her sad sticklike legs beneath. Her voice was alternately melodic and shrill, sweetly reasonable and despotic. There had been other “girl assistants” preceding Marianne, and Marianne had no doubt there would be others to follow. Miss Hagström seemed to be fond of Marianne, and several times made inquiries into her family background (“But you must be from somewhere and someone, dear—we all are!”), which Marianne gently discouraged; she was always “promoting” her—and raising her modest salary by a few dollars; she encouraged Marianne to “cultivate friends your own age” in Spartansburg, but seemed pleased when Marianne stayed close to home. Yet she was a demanding, dictatorial presence, requiring help in small matters—getting into, and out of, “this damned chair”—and large—the organization of her study, including her vast correspondence that dated back to the mid-1940’s, and hundreds, or thousands, of poetry manuscripts. (What a confusion this study had been, when Marianne first saw it! As if a hurricane had blown through.) She was always scolding Marianne to “Speak up! You’ll make me think I’m going deaf and I am not” and even poor Muffin, for being “nervous as a cat”—which, in her presence, he was. She declared herself, however, a lover of animals, and gave lavish donations to the Humane Society. She declared herself “an opponent of organized religion” and resolutely did not give to local churches or church-related charities—“Let them pray to their Almighty God, if they think they’re on such special terms with Him.” She refused to see visitors who dropped by with no warning; yet complained of being lonely in Spartansburg, “ostracized for being a ‘poetess.’” She was furious if her morning was interrupted (this was her time, from 9 A.M. until noon, for the intense work of composing poems) yet disappointed as a child when Marianne fetched the mail, and there was nothing interesting; no requests for interviews, visits, etc., which she would have probably refused. Or if an entire day passed, and often an entire day did, when no calls came in and Marianne had to report apologetically, “Nothing, Miss Hagström. Not a thing.”"|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
12:00|noon|"And Penelope Hagström, certainly, was a remarkable, even an extraordinary woman. A poet—a true lover of poetry—who could recite poems of Keats, Shelley, Dickinson, Yeats, Frost in a way that thrilled Marianne to hear. (Marianne was frequently invited to share meals with the lonely woman, and it was at such times that Penelope Hagström recited those poems she considered “luminous—illuminating to the soul.”) Now in her early sixties, Miss Hagström had been wheelchair-bound for many years, though her multiple sclerosis seemed to be in remission at the present time. She had a ravaged, hawkish, rather noble face, her graying hair parted in the center and drawn back severely into a chignon—“My Emily Dickinson look, the best we plain girls can hope for.” She was surprisingly robust in appearance, from the hips up, with an ample bosom, shoulders, arms; if you couldn’t discern her sad sticklike legs beneath.

00:00|midnight|"So Marianne decided instead to take Muffin to the Stump Creek Hill Animal Shelter & Hospital, of which she’d been hearing such good things since coming to Sykesville. It was only a few miles away and next morning, early, she managed to get a ride with a local farmer, carrying Muffin not in the cardboard box but on her lap. The farmer was doubtful about just dropping her off at the end of the sandy driveway marked STUMP CREEK hill animal shelter & hospital, wouldn’t she want him to come by and pick her up, later?—but Marianne said no, thank you, she’d be fine. Walking then up the quarter-mile drive, Muffin in her arms, the two of them blinking and staring about them. A strange place—an old estate apparently, now given over to the care of animals; a broad stone house and a carriage house each weatherworn as aged grave markers, yet with bright yellow shutters and trim, and the front area overgrown and tangled as a jungle, lush with wild tiger lilies, goldenrod, and Queen Anne’s lace. There were various outbuildings and sheds, and a graveled parking lot in which a half dozen vehicles were parked. To the rear was a yellow picket fence and twin gates marked ENTER and EXIT, leading to what appeared to be an outdoor zoo. Muffin’s pale nose began to twitch with the raffish smell of animals. There was a sound of excited screeching, jabbering in the distance. Muffled barking. Marianne saw a gigantic bird—iridescent midnight blue, exquisitely beautiful, with a quivering feather crown and a long tail dragging in the dust—a peacock?—ambling across the parking lot, and in its wake a smaller pure-white bird—a peahen? Farther along the lane were several deer, a small loose tame herd. Marianne stared—at least two of the deer were young bucks, with only three legs."|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
12:00|noon|"In a daze then, vaguely smiling, Marianne wandered back through the parking lot, hoping for another glimpse of the peacock and his hen, and the herd of deer. There were chattering guinea hens and a high-stepping bantam rooster running loose, there was a scrawny black tomcat with two half-ears sunning himself on the hood of a battered Chevy pickup. Marianne petted him, daringly—you never can tell, with a strange cat—but he merely blinked at her, lazy and content. It was a heating-up sort of August morning, the kind that begins damp and almost cool and turns baking by noon. A happy, hopeful day. No ticket seller at the ENTRANCE gate, just an orange plastic container STUMP CREEK HILL ANIMALS NEED ALL YOU CAN GIVE THEM! so Marianne took a five-dollar bill from her wallet (yes, she’d saved plenty of money working as Penelope Hagström’s assistant) and pushed it into the slot. The pungent smell of animals drew her. Manure and hay, that just-slightly-rancid-pleasurable smell. A sharper smell—what was it? the antiseptic spray they’d used, at the farm, when the cows calved?—but this was sweeter somehow. And someone had been mowing deep grass, a wet green pungent smell, laced with wild onion."|"We Were the Mulvaneys"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
