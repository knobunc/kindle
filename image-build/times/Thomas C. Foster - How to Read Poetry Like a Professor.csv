The beauty of the scene lies not in its realization but in its potentiality, for the way that it adumbrates its story rather than filling in all the details. Which praise he delivers in considerable detail. Throughout the second and third stanzas he lauds the permanence of the scene: the lover cannot extract his kiss, but on the other hand, neither he nor his quarry will ever age, nor will they be subject to the heartaches of real human love. Stanza four offers further detail of the urn’s pictorial tale: priests coming to a sacrifice, leading a garlanded heifer, townsfolk following along and leaving, thereby, a town forever abandoned (because they are on the urn and not back at home), everything captured in clay. Forever."|"How to Read Poetry Like a Professor"|"Thomas C. Foster"
00:00|midnight|"If we turn the beat around and go looking for trochaic, rather than iambic, rhythm, we find Edgar Allan Poe and something decidedly not comic:
Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—"|"How to Read Poetry Like a Professor"|"Thomas C. Foster"
00:00|midnight|"The first two lines of William Blake’s “The Tyger” have the advantage of not only rhyming but also being a couplet, a rhyming pair right next to each other. Rhyming lines need not be that close to one another, and the patterns in which they rhyme can be quite complex, but for the moment, let’s limit ourselves to the basic concept. Rhymes don’t have to sit at the ends of lines; they can also happen within the line, where a word on the interior rhymes with the one at the end (or sometimes one in the next line), in which case we call them internal rhymes, exhibiting just how imaginative literary scholars can be. One frequently invoked instance of internal rhyme is Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Raven,” whose first line reads, “Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary.” It’s true: those are full chimes for each other. On the other hand, it feels a little like cheating. What Poe has done here is take rhyming short lines and lay them end to end so that his rhymes fall at the midpoint and the end rather than in couplets:"|"How to Read Poetry Like a Professor"|"Thomas C.

"ap 02:45"|2:45|"Why is that wrong? Because a poem is not a court deposition, a letter of recommendation, or a lover’s note. Those are, we trust, true statements in the real world, reflecting someone’s version of the God’s honest truth about X or Y or Zed. If John writes to Marsha, “Meet me behind the school at 2:45,” he darned well needs to back it up by showing up at the appointed moment and not sometime next week. A poem is not a true document but rather an imaginative utterance. And the imaginative part extends to the personage who utters it. When we assume that said personage is the Poet (as if that’s his name, John Q. Poet), we run the risk of missing the point."|"How to Read Poetry Like a Professor"|"Thomas C. Foster"
