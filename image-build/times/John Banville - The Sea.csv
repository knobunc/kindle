12:00|midday|"At last we went inside, having nowhere else to go. Bright  light of midday streamed in at the kitchen window and everything had a glassy, hard-edged radiance as if I were scanning  the room through a camera lens. There was an impression   of general, tight-lipped awkwardness, of all these homely  things—jars on the shelves, saucepans on the stove, that bread-board with its jagged knife—averting their gaze from our all at  once unfamiliar, afflicted presence in their midst. This, I  realised miserably, this is how it would be from now on, wherever she goes the soundless clapping of the leper’s bell preceding her. How well you look! they would exclaim. Why, we’ve never seen  you better! And she with her brilliant smile, putting on a brave  face, poor Mrs. Bones."|"The Sea"|"John Banville"
00:00|midnight|"In fact it is a field no longer but a dreary holiday estate  packed higgledy-piggledy with what are bound to be jerrybuilt  bungalows, designed I suspect by the same cackhanded line-drawer who was responsible for the eyesores at the bottom of   the garden here. However, I was pleased to note that the name  given to the place, ersatz though it be, is The Lupins, and that  the builder, for I presume it was the builder, even spared a tall  stand of this modest wild shrub—Lupinus, a genus of the  Papilionaceae, I have just looked it up—beside the ridiculously  grand mock-gothic gateway that leads in from the road. It was  under the lupin bushes that my father every other week, at  darkest midnight, with spade and flashlight, muttering curses  under his breath, would dig a hole in the soft sandy earth and  bury the bucketful of slops from our chemical lavatory. I can  never smell the weak but oddly anthropic perfume of those  blossoms without seeming to catch behind it a lingering sweet  whiff of nightsoil."|"The Sea"|"John Banville"
12:00|midday|"Love among the big people. It was strange to picture them,  to try to picture them, struggling together on their Olympian  beds in the dark of night with only the stars to see them, grasping and clasping, panting endearments, crying out for pleasure  as if in pain. How did they justify these dark deeds to their  daytime selves? That was something that puzzled me greatly.  Why were they not ashamed? On Sunday morning, say, they  arrive at church still tingling from Saturday night’s frolics. The   priest greets them in the porch, they smile blamelessly, mumbling innocuous words. The woman dips her fingertips in the  font, mingling traces of tenacious love-juice with the holy  water. Under their Sunday best their thighs chafe in remembered delight. They kneel, not minding the mournfully reproachful gaze the statue of their Saviour fixes on them from  the cross. After their midday Sunday dinner perhaps they will  send the children out to play and retire to the sanctuary of  their curtained bedroom and do it all over again, unaware of  my mind’s bloodshot eye fixed on them unblinkingly. Yes, I was  that kind of boy. Or better say, there is part of me still that is  the kind of boy that I was then. A little brute, in other words,  with a filthy mind. As if there were any other sort. We never  grow up. I never did, anyway."|"The Sea"|"John Banville"
00:00|midnight|"Chloe, her cruelty. The beach. The midnight swim. Her lost  sandal, that night in the doorway of the dancehall, Cinderella’s  shoe. All gone. All lost. It is no matter. Tired, tired and drunk.  No matter."|"The Sea"|"John Banville"
12:00|noon|"At lunchtime the Colonel and I must shift for ourselves,  for Miss Vavasour retires to her room every day between noon  and three, to sleep, or read, or work on her memoirs, nothing  would surprise me. The Colonel is a ruminant. He sits at the  kitchen table in shirt-sleeves and an antique sleeveless pullover  munching away at an ill-made sandwich—hacked lump of  cheese or chunk of cold meat between two door-stoppers   smeared with his slap, or a daub of Colman’s fieriest, or sometimes both if he feels in need of a jolt—and tries out feints of  conversation on me, like a canny field commander searching for  a bulge in the enemy’s defences. He sticks to neutral topics, the  weather, sporting fixtures, horse racing although he assures me  he is not a betting man. Despite the diffidence his need is  patent: he dreads the afternoons, those empty hours, as I dread  the sleepless nights. He cannot make me out, would like to  know what really I am doing here, who might be anywhere, if I  chose, so he believes. Who that could afford the warm south—  “The sun’s the only man for the pains and aches,” the Colonel  opines—would come to do his grieving at the Cedars? I have  not told him about the old days here, the Graces, all that. Not  that all that is an explanation. I get up to leave—“Work,” I say  solemnly—and he gives me a desperate look. Even my unforthcoming company is preferable to his room and the radio."|"The Sea"|"John Banville"

12:00|noon|"Our day today was lightened, if that is the way to put it, by  a visit from Miss Vavasour’s friend Bun, who joined us for Sunday lunch. I came upon her at noon in the lounge, overflowing  a wicker armchair in the bay window, lolling as if helpless there  and faintly panting. The space where she sat was thronged with  smoky sunlight and at first I could hardly make her out,  although in truth she is as unmissable as the late Queen of  Tonga. She is an enormous person, of indeterminate age. She  wore a sack-coloured tweed dress tightly belted in the middle,  which made her look as if she had been pumped up to bursting  at bosom and hips, and her short stout cork-coloured legs were  stuck out in front of her like two gigantic bungs protruding  from her nether regions. A tiny sweet face, delicate of feature   and pinkly aglow, is set in the big pale pudding of her head, the  fossil remains, marvellously preserved, of the girl that she once  was, long ago. Her ash-and-silver hair was done in an old-fashioned style, parted down the centre and pulled back into an  eponymous bun. She smiled at me and nodded a greeting, her  powdered wattles joggling. I did not know who she was, and  thought she must be a guest newly arrived—Miss Vavasour has  half a dozen vacant rooms for rent at this off-peak season.  When she tottered to her feet the wicker chair cried out in  excruciated relief. She really is of a prodigious bulk. I thought  that if her belt buckle were to fail and the belt snap her trunk  would flop into a perfectly spherical shape with her head on  top like a large cherry on a, well, on a bun. It was apparent from  the look she gave me, of mingled sympathy and eager interest,  that she was aware of who I was and had been apprised of my  stricken state. She told me her name, grand-sounding, with a  hyphen, but I immediately forgot it. Her hand was small and  soft and moistly warm, a baby’s hand. Colonel Blunden came  into the room then, with the Sunday papers under his arm, and  looked at her and frowned. When he frowns like that the yellowish whites of his eyes seem to darken and his mouth takes  on the out-thrust blunt squareness of a muzzle."|"The Sea"|"John Banville"
00:00|midnight|"Of the three central figures in that summer’s salt-bleached  triptych it is she, oddly, who is most sharply delineated on the  wall of my memory. I think the reason for this is that the first  two figures in the scene, I mean Chloe and her mother, are all  my own work while Rose is by another, unknown, hand. I keep  going up close to them, the two Graces, now mother, now  daughter, applying a dab of colour here, scumbling a detail  there, and the result of all this close work is that my focus on  them is blurred rather than sharpened, even when I stand back  to survey my handiwork. But Rose, Rose is a completed portrait, Rose is done. This does not mean she was more real or of  more significance to me than Chloe or her mother, certainly  not, only that I can picture her with the most immediacy. It  cannot be because she is still here, for the version of her which  is here is so changed as to be hardly recognisable. I see her in  her pumps and sheer black pants and shirt of a crimson  shade—although she must have had other outfits, this is the  one she wears in almost every one of my recollections of her—  posed among inconsequentials, the arbitrary props of the studio, a dull drape, a dusty straw hat with a blossom in the band,  a bit of mossed-over wall that is probably made of cardboard,  and, high up in one corner, an umber doorway where, mysteriously, deep shadows give on to a white-gold blaze of empty  light. Her presence was not as vivid for me as that of Chloe or  Mrs. Grace, how could it be, yet there was something that set  her apart, with that midnight-black hair of hers and that white  skin the powdery bloom of which the strongest sunlight or  harshest sea breeze seemed incapable of smudging."|"The Sea"|"John Banville"
12:00|midday|"The visit was due for midday, but the noontide bell tolled,  and the lunch hour came and went, and no car had pulled up at  the gate and no joyous shouts of the Little Ones had been   heard. The Colonel paced, wrist clasped in a hand behind him,  or stationed himself before the window, muzzle thrust forward, and shot a cuff and lifted his arm to eye level and glared  reproachfully at his watch. Miss Vavasour and I went about   on tenterhooks, not daring to speak. The aroma of roasting  chicken in the house seemed a heartless gibe. It was late in the  afternoon when the telephone in the hall rang, making us all  start. The Colonel leaned his ear to the receiver like a despairing priest in the confessional. The exchange was brief. We tried  not to hear what he was saying. He came into the kitchen clearing his throat. “Car,” he said, looking at no one. “Broke down.”  Clearly he had been lied to, or was lying now to us. He turned  to Miss Vavasour with a desolate smile. “Sorry about the  chicken,” he said."|"The Sea"|"John Banville"

12:00|noon|"I went to the Pier Head Bar by myself and got sozzled. I  did not mean to but I did. It was one of those plangent autumn  evenings streaked with late sunlight that seemed itself a memory of what sometime in the far past had been the blaze of  noon. Rain earlier had left puddles on the road that were paler  than the sky, as if the last of day were dying in them. It was  windy and the skirts of my overcoat flapped about my legs like  Little Ones of my own, begging their Da not to go to the   pub. But go I did. The Pier Head is a cheerless establishment presided over by a huge television set, fully the match   of Miss V.’s Panoramic, permanently switched on but with    the sound turned down. The publican is a fat soft slow man of  few words. He has a peculiar name, I cannot remember it for  the moment. I drank double brandies. Odd moments of the  evening stand out in my memory, fuzzily bright, like lamp standards in a fog. I remember provoking or being provoked into an  argument with an old fellow at the bar, and being remonstrated  with by a much younger one, his son, perhaps, or grandson,  whom I pushed and who threatened to summon the police.  When the publican intervened—Barragry, that is his name—  I tried to push him, too, lunging at him across the counter with  a hoarse shout. Really, this is not like me at all, I do not know  what was the matter, I mean other than what is usually the matter. At last they calmed me down and I retreated grumpily to a  table in the corner, under the speechless television set, where I  sat mumbling to myself and sighing. Those drunken sighs,  bubbly and tremulous, how like sobs they can sound. The last  light of evening, what I could see of it through the unpainted  top quarter of the pub window, was of that angry, purplish-brown cast that I find both affecting and troubling, it is the  very colour of winter. Not that I have anything against winter,  indeed, it is my favourite season, next to autumn, but this year  that November glow seemed a presagement of something more  than winter, and I fell into a mood of bitter melancholy. Seeking to assuage my heaviness of heart I called for more brandy  but Barragry refused it, advisedly, as I now acknowledge, and I  stormed out in rageful indignation, or tried to storm but staggered really, and came back to the Cedars and my own bottle,  which I have fondly dubbed the Little Corporal. On the stairs I  met Colonel Blunden and had some converse with him, I do  not know what about, exactly."|"The Sea"|"John Banville"
