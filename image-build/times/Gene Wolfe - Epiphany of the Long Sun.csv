That, too, was good. At three, he would preside at the private sacrifice of twenty-one dappled horses, the now-posthumous offering of Councillor Lemur-one to all the gods for each week since Thin more substantial than a shower had blessed Viron's fields. They could be convened to a thank offering, and he would so convert them."|"Epiphany of the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
04:00|"four in the morning"|"Then the garden wall was at his elbow, and Maytera Marble at the gate waving to him while the Guardsmen swung the butts of the slug guns to keep back the crowd. A voice at his ear said, ""I shall come with you, My Caldé. Always now, you must have someone to protect you."" It was the captain with whom he had breakfasted at four in the morning in Limna."|"Epiphany of the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
12:00|noon|"An augur ready to steal to get just such cards as her body sold for. An augur ready to steal by night from the man from whom he had already bullied three cards at noon. One of those cards had bought Oreb and a cage to keep him in. Would three have bought Hyacinth? Brought her to this old three-sided cage of a manse, with its bolted doors and barred windows?"|"Epiphany of the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
"ap ~ 07:30"|"about seven thirty"|"""Yes, but its after shadelow. It's about seven thirty, I think. There's a clock in the captain's room, and it was seven twenty-five when I went in. Seven twenty-five by that clock, I mean, and I wasn't there long. He's very busy."""|"Epiphany of the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"

01:00|"one this morning"|"""I rode in one this morning."" Silk shut his eyes again, striving to remember, ""I rode inside until the rain stopped. Later I rode on it, sitting on the… Up on that round part that has the highest buzz gun. It was crowded inside, not at all comfortable, and we'd put the bodies in there-but it was better than being out in the rain, perhaps."""|"Epiphany of the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
"ap 03:00"|three|"""I have forgotten."" Oosik extracted the letter from its envelope and unfolded it. ""'Patera Remora, Coadjutor.' He wishes to see you, or he did. You were to come to his suite in the Prolocutor's Palace yesterday at three. You are more than a day late already, Caldé. Do you want it?"""|"Epiphany of the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"

Late when they released me. I've said it? Suppertime-after suppertime, really. They know your-um-profession. Vocation, hey? Mint's a sibyl. You take my meaning?"""|"Epiphany of the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"

00:00|midnight|"For a wasted second, Silk stared at Remora, searching for signs of Mucor in his face. Hyacinth was in sight before he heard the rapid pattering of her bare feet on the path of false gems and saw her, mouth open and dark eyes bright with tears above the rosy confusion of a gossamer dishabille, her hair a midnight cloud behind her as she ran."|"Epiphany of the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
"ap 02:00"|two|"""I teach arithmetic."" Maytera Marble sighed. ""And now I want to count on my fingers. What's worse, I can't. Only up to five, and we had six with Generalissimo Oosik and all those foreign officers. You and His Cognizance make eight. The old fencing master nine. Chenille, ten. Mucor and me, twelve. If you're going to invite anybody else, you'd better make it two, Patera. Thirteen at table's not lucky. I don't know why, but you're supposed to bring somebody in off the street if you have to, to make fourteen."""|"Epiphany of the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"Silk leaned against the doorframe; he was already tired, had been tired before the parade had ended, and there was still the dinner tonight; he resolved to get an hour's sleep before eight, no matter what happened. Aloud he asked, ""Can you cast bronze-this real bronze-as well as brass?"""|"Epiphany of the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"""With your permission, I shall look in on my son. I hope he is well enough to attend. I will return at eight."""|"Epiphany of the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"

12:00|noon|"The top of the chute was a glaring rectangle above her, light so bright that it seemed to her it must surely be noon, with the whole of Pas's long sun pouring golden radiance through the windows of the manteion into which she rose. Fascinated, she watched Slate's metal hands in silhouette as they slowly and steadily hauled her up, each grip succeeded by the next."|"Epiphany of the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
"ap 02:21"|"Two twenty-one"|"""Two twenty-one, madame. It is Phaesday morning, madame. Shadeup is less than four hours distant."""|"Epiphany of the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
12:00|midday|"Staring up at the still-distant airship, Silk clenched his teeth, determined equally that the icy wind that whipped his robe would not make them chatter and that the airship would not make him gape, though so immense a flying structure seemed less an achievement than a force of nature. Ever so slowly, it edged its vast, mummy-colored bulk across the gray midday sky, lost at times among low clouds dark with snow, always reappearing nearer the winter-wet meadow where he and his companions waited under guard."|"Epiphany of the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 00:00"|"About midnight"|"""About midnight. This will float over the city, and in the morning they'll let you down."""|"Epiphany of the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
12:00|midday|"""Over this we fight a duel, perhaps, if I am free. It may still be so. I did not know, Mint. If you have deal with Saba and her airship as I, you know that what is to be at shadeup may not be until midday, or not this day or the next. Let me go. I get them again and free them. Caldé Silk also."""|"Epiphany of the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
00:00|midnight|"As a tactician, she understood better than most the need for a simple workable plan which could be put into effect before conditions changed; that and the astounding loyalty she inspired were the keys to her success. Although she is better known as General Mint, I have titled her Maytera, just as I have referred to her sib as Maytera Marble throughout my account. Fewer than I had expected have found fault with Silk's assertion that she took her warlike character from the Goddess of Love, although it seems implausible to me. Nettle suggests that many women, thus inspired by love of their city and their gods, might exhibit the same dauntless courage. Certainly love will face the inhumi at midnight, as we say now."|"Epiphany of the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
