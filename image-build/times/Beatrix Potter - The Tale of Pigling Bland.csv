"ap 00:00"|"twelve o’clock"|"Mr. Piperson was very affable; he slapped Pigling on the back, made lots of porridge
            and forgot to lock the meal chest. He did lock the cupboard door; but without properly shutting it. He went
            to bed early, and told Pigling upon no account to disturb him next day before twelve o’clock."|"The Tale of Pigling Bland"|"Beatrix Potter"
