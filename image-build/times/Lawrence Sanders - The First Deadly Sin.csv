A pregnant woman was raped by three men in a subway station at 10:30 in the morning. Bombs were set. Acid was thrown. Explosions destroyed embassies, banks, and churches. Infants were beaten to death. Glass was shattered, leather slashed, plants uprooted, obscene slogans sprayed on marble monuments. Zoos were invaded and small animals torn apart."|"The First Deadly Sin"|"Lawrence Sanders"

He wore a Swedish blazer of black wool and a French “body shirt” in a lacy polyester weave, cut to cling to the torso. It was a style called “Chemise de gigolo” and had a front that opened halfway to the waist. An ornate Maltese cross hung from a silver chain about his neck."|"The First Deadly Sin"|"Lawrence Sanders"

He squinted at the sketches, remembering how the girl looked, beginning to plan the first painting."|"The First Deadly Sin"|"Lawrence Sanders"

I swear we had to tear this guy away from them. If someone had had a rope, he’d have been swinging. I’ve never seen people so infuriated. To this day it scares me to think about it. And of course the clincher is that this guy was facing a GTA back in Michigan, or Illinois, or whatever. Even if Sam had asked for his ID, which, knowing Sam, I doubt he’d have done, the guy faced three-to-five at most, and probably less. But he panicked, and I lost the best street cop in my precinct.”"|"The First Deadly Sin"|"Lawrence Sanders"
