12:00|midday|"When the bell for luncheon called them downstairs, both had regained their serenity, owing to understanding the political scene and to setting the understanding aside. An atmosphere of unusual relaxation had spread over the house. The midday meal was the chief one of the day, and went, God be thanked, quite smoothly. This in spite of one of the ringlets framing the face of the twenty-year-old Carolina, the eldest daughter, dropping into her soup plate because, apparently, of an ill-secured pin. Another day the incident might have had dreadful consequences, but now it only heightened the gaiety; and when her brother, sitting next to her, took the lock of hair and pinned it on his neckerchief, where it hung like a scapular, even the Prince allowed himself a smile. Tancredi’s departure, destination, and reasons were now known to all, and everyone talked of them, except Paolo, who went on eating in silence. No one was really worrying about him, in fact, but the Prince, who showed no signs of the anxiety he still felt deep down, and Concetta, who was the only one with a shadow on her pretty forehead. “The girl must have her eye on the young rascal. They’d make a fine couple. But I fear Tancredi will have to aim higher, by which of course I mean lower.”"|"The Leopard"|"Giuseppe Tomasi Di Lampedusa"
06:00|"six that morning"|"The trees were only three, in truth, and eucalyptus at that, scruffiest of Mother Nature’s children. But they were also the first seen by the Salina family since leaving Bisacquino at six that morning. It was now eleven, and for the last five hours all they had set eyes on were bare hillsides flaming yellow under the sun. Trots over level ground had alternated briefly with long, slow trudges uphill and then careful shuffles down; both trudge and trot merging, anyway, into the constant jingle of harness bells, imperceptible, now, to the dazed senses, except as sound equivalent of the blazing landscape. They had passed through crazed-looking villages washed in palest blue; crossed dry river beds over fantastic bridges; skirted sheer precipices which no sage and broom could temper. Never a tree, never a drop of water; just sun and dust. Inside the carriages, tightly shut against that sun and dust, the temperature must have been well over 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Those desiccated trees yearning away under bleached sky bore many a message: that they were now within a couple of hours of their journey’s end; that they were coming into the family estates; that they could lunch, and perhaps even wash their faces in the verminous waters of the well."|"The Leopard"|"Giuseppe Tomasi Di Lampedusa"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"At the bottom of the steps the authorities took their leave, and the Princess, acting under instructions whispered to her during the ceremony, invited the Mayor, the Archpriest, and the notary to dine that same evening. The Archpriest was a bachelor by profession and the notary one by vocation, so that for them the question of consorts did not arise; the invitation to the Mayor was rather languidly extended to his wife; she was some peasant woman, of great beauty, but considered by her own husband as quite unpresentable in public for a number of reasons; thus no one was surprised at his saying that she was indisposed; but great was the amazement when he added, “If Your Excellencies will allow I’ll bring along my daughter Angelica, who’s been talking for the past month of nothing but her longing to be presented to you now that she’s grown up.” Consent was, of course, given; and the Prince, who had seen Tumeo peering at him from behind the others’ shoulders, called out to him, “You come too, of course, Don Ciccio, and bring Teresina.” And he added, turning to the others, “And after dinner, at nine o’clock, we shall be happy to see all our friends.” For a long time Donnafugata commented on these last words. And the Prince, who had found Donnafugata unchanged, was found very much changed himself, for never before would he have issued so cordial an invitation; and from that moment, invisibly, began the decline of his prestige."|"The Leopard"|"Giuseppe Tomasi Di Lampedusa"
"ap < 03:00"|"almost three o’clock"|"Don Nofrio was disturbed by his master’s silence and imagined he had put the Prince out by telling him petty local gossip. “Excellency, I ordered a bath to be prepared for you, it should be ready by now.” Don Fabrizio suddenly realized that he was tired; it was almost three o’clock, and he had been up and about for nine hours under that torrid sun, and after that ghastly night. He felt his body covered in dust to the remotest creases. “Thank you, Don Nofrio, for thinking of it; and for everything else. We shall meet tonight at dinner.”"|"The Leopard"|"Giuseppe Tomasi Di Lampedusa"
12:00|"high noon"|"“Dear Uncle Fabrizio,” therefore, was informed that his “most affectionate and devoted nephew” had for the last three months been a prey to the most violent love, and that neither “the risks of war” (read: walks in the park of Caserta) nor “the many attractions of a great city” (read: the charms of the dancer Schwarzwald) had been able even for an instant to drive from his mind and heart the image of the Signorina Angelica Sedàra (here a long procession of adjectives to exalt the beauty, grace, virtue, and intellect of his beloved); then, in neat hieroglyphics of ink and sentiment, the letter went on to say that Tancredi had felt so conscious of his own unworthiness that he had tried to suffocate his ardor (“long but vain have been the hours during which, amid the clamor of Naples or the austere company of my comrades-in-arms, I have tried to repress my feelings”). But now love had overcome his reserve, and he was begging his dearly beloved uncle to deign to request Signorina Angelica’s “most esteemed father” for her hand, in his name and on his behalf. “You know, Uncle, that all I can offer to the object of my affection is my love, my name, and my sword.” After this phrase, in connection with which it should not be forgotten that romanticism was then at high noon, Tancredi went on to long considerations of the expediency, nay the necessity, of unions between families such as the Falconeris and the Sedàras (once he even dared write “The House of Sedàra”) being encouraged in order to bring new blood into old families, and also to level out classes, aims of the current political movement in Italy. This was the only part of the letter that Don Fabrizio read with any pleasure; and not just because it confirmed his own previsions and crowned him with the laurels of a prophet, but also (it would be harsh to say “above all”) because the style, with its hints of subdued irony, magically evoked his nephew’s image: the jesting nasal tone, the sparkling malice in his blue eyes, the mockingly polite smile. And when he realized that this little Jacobin sally was written out on exactly one single sheet of paper so that if he wanted he could let others read the letter while subtracting this revolutionary chapter, his admiration for Tancredi’s tact knew no bounds. After a brief résumé of recent operations and an expression of the conviction that within a year they would be in Rome, “predestined capital of the new Italy,” he thanked his uncle for the care and affection given him in the past, and ended by excusing himself for daring to confide him with this charge, “on which my future happiness depends.” Then came greetings (for Don Fabrizio only)."|"The Leopard"|"Giuseppe Tomasi Di Lampedusa"
12:00|midday|"But though a shot had killed the rabbit, though the bored rifles of General Cialdini were now dismaying the Bourbon troops at Gaeta, though the midday heat was making men doze off, nothing could stop the ants. Attracted by a few chewed grape-skins spat out by Don Ciccio, along they rushed in close order, morale high at the chance of annexing that bit of garbage soaked with an organist’s saliva. Up they came full of confidence, disordered but resolute; groups of three or four would stop now and again for a chat, exalting, perhaps, the ancient glories and future prosperity of anthill Number Two under cork tree Number Four on the top of Mount Morco; then once again they would take up their march with the others toward a buoyant future; the gleaming backs of those imperialists seemed to quiver with enthusiasm, while from their ranks no doubt rose the notes of an anthem."|"The Leopard"|"Giuseppe Tomasi Di Lampedusa"
"~ 16:00"|"about four in the afternoon"|"The Prince went to vote about four in the afternoon, flanked on the right by Father Pirrone, on the left by Don Onofrio Rotolo; frowning and fair-skinned, he proceeded slowly toward the Town Hall, frequently putting up a hand to protect his eyes lest the breeze, loaded with all the filth collected on its way, should bring on the conjunctivitis to which he was subject; and he remarked to Father Pirrone that though the air would have been like a putrid pool without the wind, yet health-giving gusts did seem to drag up a lot of dirt with them. He was wearing the same black frock coat in which two years before he had gone to pay his respects at Caserta to poor King Ferdinand, who had been lucky enough to die in time to avoid this day of dirty wind, when the seal would be set on his incapacity. But had it really been incapacity? One might as well say that a person succumbing to typhus dies from incapacity. He remembered the King busy putting up dikes against the floods of useless documents; and suddenly he realized how much unconscious appeal to pity there was in those unattractive features. Such thoughts were disagreeable, as are all those that make us understand things too late, and the Prince’s face went solemn and dark as if he were following an invisible funeral carriage. Only the violent impact of his feet on loose stones in the street showed his internal conflict; it is superfluous to mention that the ribbon on his top hat was innocent of any piece of paper, but for the eyes of those who knew him a “yes” and a “no” alternated under the glistening of the felt."|"The Leopard"|"Giuseppe Tomasi Di Lampedusa"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"Applause and hurrahs rose from the dark background of the square; on her little balcony Angelica, with her funereal maid, clapped lovely rapacious hands; speeches were made; adjectives loaded with superlatives and double consonants reverberated and echoed in the dark from one wall to another; amid the thunder of fireworks messages were sent off to the King (the new one) and to the General; a tricolor rocket or two climbed up from the village into the blackness toward the starless sky. By eight o’clock all was over, and nothing remained except the darkness as on any other night, as always."|"The Leopard"|"Giuseppe Tomasi Di Lampedusa"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"“Excellency, no one has laid eyes on Don Calogero’s wife for years, except me. She only leaves the house to go to early Mass, the five o’clock one, when it’s empty. There’s no organ-playing at that hour; but once I got up early just to see her. Donna Bastiana came in with her maid, and as I was hiding behind a confessional I could not see very much; but at the end of Mass the heat was too much for the poor woman and she took off her black veil. Word of honor, Excellency, she was lovely as the sun; one can’t blame Don Calogero, who’s a beetle of a man, for wanting to keep her away from others. But even in the best-kept houses secrets come out; servants talk; and it seems Donna Bastiana is a kind of animal: she can’t read or write, or tell the time by a clock; she can scarcely talk; just a beautiful mare, voluptuous and uncouth; she’s incapable even of affection for her own daughter! Good for bed, and that’s all.”"|"The Leopard"|"Giuseppe Tomasi Di Lampedusa"
"ap 04:30"|"half past four"|"When Don Calogero’s arrival was announced at exactly half past four the Prince had not yet finished his toilet; he sent a message asking the Mayor to wait a minute in his study and went on placidly beautifying himself. He plastered his hair with lemo-liscio, Atkinson’s lime and glycerine, a dense whitish lotion which arrived in cases from London and whose name suffered the same ethnic changes as songs; he rejected the black frock coat and chose instead a very pale lilac one which seemed more suited to the presumably festive occasion; he dallied a little longer to tweak out with pincers an impudent fair hair which had succeeded in getting through free that morning in his hurried shave; he had Father Pirrone called; before leaving the room he took from a table an extract from the Blätter für Himmelsforschung and with the rolled paper made the sign of the Cross, a gesture of devotion which in Sicily has a nonreligious meaning more frequently than is realized."|"The Leopard"|"Giuseppe Tomasi Di Lampedusa"
18:00|"six in the evening"|"Angelica’s first visit to the Salina family as a bride-to-be was impeccably stage-managed. Her bearing was so perfect that it might have been suggested word by word by Tancredi, but this was ruled out by the slow communications of the period; one possible explanation was that he had given her some suggestions even before their official engagement: a risky hypothesis for anyone able to measure the young Prince’s foresight, but not entirely absurd. Angelica arrived at six in the evening, dressed in pink and white; her soft black tresses were shadowed by a big autumnal straw hat on which bunches of artificial grapes and golden ears of wheat discreetly evoked the vineyards of Gibildolce and the granaries of Settesoli. She sloughed off her father in the entrance hall, then with a swirl of wide skirts floated lightly up the many steps of the inner staircase and flung herself into the arms of Don Fabrizio; on his whiskers she implanted two big kisses which were returned with genuine affection; the Prince paused perhaps just a second longer than necessary to breathe in the scent of gardenia on adolescent cheeks. After this Angelica blushed, took half a step back: “I’m so, so happy …,” then came close again, stood on tiptoe, and murmured into his ear, “Uncle mine!”; a highly successful line, comparable in its perfect timing almost to Eisenstein’s baby carriage, and which, explicit and secret as it was, set the Prince’s simple heart aflutter and yoked him to the lovely girl for ever. Meanwhile Don Calogero was coming up the stairs, and said how very sorry his wife was she could not be present, but the night before she had slipped at home and twisted her left foot, which was most painful. “Her ankle’s like an eggplant, Prince.” Don Fabrizio, exhilarated by the verbal caress, and forewarned by Tumeo’s revelations that his offer would never be put to the proof, said that he would give himself the pleasure of calling upon the Signora Sedàra at once, a suggestion which dismayed Don Calogero and made him, in order to reject it, think up a second indisposition of his spouse’s, this time a violent headache which forced the poor woman to remain in the dark."|"The Leopard"|"Giuseppe Tomasi Di Lampedusa"
12:00|noon|"Don Fabrizio’s voice quickly put such trifling in its place; he talked of Tancredi as he was now, of the quick attentive youth, always ready with a remark which enraptured those who loved him and exasperated everyone else; he told of Tancredi’s introduction to the Duchess of San-something-or-other during a visit to Naples, and how she had been so taken with him that she wanted him to visit her morning, noon, and night, whether she happened to be in her drawing room or her bed; all because, said she, no one knew how to tell les petits riens like Tancredi; and although Don Fabrizio hurriedly added that Tancredi could have been no more than sixteen at the time and the Duchess over fifty, Angelica’s eyes flashed, for she had definite information about the habits of Palermitan youths and strong intuitions about those of Neapolitan Duchesses."|"The Leopard"|"Giuseppe Tomasi Di Lampedusa"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"Don Fabrizio intervened. “Listen, Count: you thought it never rained in Sicily and now you can see it’s pouring. We wouldn’t like you to think there isn’t pneumonia in Sicily too, and then find yourself in bed with a high temperature. Mimí,” he said to the valet, “light the fire in the Signorino Tancredi’s room and in the green room of the guest wing. Prepare the little room next door for the soldier. And you, Count, go and get thoroughly dry and change your clothes. I’ll send you up some punch and biscuits. And dinner is at eight, in two hours.” Cavriaghi was too used to military service not to bow at once to the voice of authority; he saluted and followed meekly behind the valet. Behind him Moroni dragged along the military boxes and curved sabers in their green flannel wrappings."|"The Leopard"|"Giuseppe Tomasi Di Lampedusa"
16:00|"four in the afternoon"|"At four in the afternoon the Prince sent to tell Chevalley that he was waiting for him in his study. This was a little room with walls lined by glass cases containing gray pheasants with pink claws, thought rare, and found in past shoots. One wall was ennobled by a high, narrow bookcase, crammed full of back numbers of mathematical reviews. Above the great armchair meant for visitors hung a constellation of family miniatures: Don Fabrizio’s father, Prince Paolo, heavy in face and sensual in lip as a Moor, with the ribbon of St. Januarius diagonally across his black Court uniform; Princess Carolina as a widow, her fair hair heaped into a towering coiffure, and with severe blue eyes; the Prince’s sister, Giulia, Princess of Falconeri, sitting on a bench in a garden, with the crimson splotch of a small parasol laid on the ground to her right and to her left the yellow splotch of Tancredi at three years old offering her wild flowers (Don Fabrizio had thrust this miniature into his pocket secretly while the bailiffs were making their inventory for the sale at Villa Falconeri). Beneath that was his eldest son, Paolo, in tight white leather breeches, just about to mount an arrogant horse with a curving neck and flashing eyes; various unidentifiable uncles and aunts, covered with jewels or pointing sorrowfully at the bust of some extinct dear one. But in the center of the constellation, acting as a kind of polestar, shone a bigger miniature; this was of Don Fabrizio himself at the age of about twenty, with his very young wife leaning her head on his shoulder in an act of complete loving abandon. She was dark-haired, he rosy in the blue and silver uniform of the Royal Guards, smiling with pleasure, his face framed in his first and very fair long whiskers."|"The Leopard"|"Giuseppe Tomasi Di Lampedusa"
05:30|"five-thirty in the morning"|"In the livid light of five-thirty in the morning Donnafugata was deserted and apparently despairing. In front of every house the refuse of squalid meals accumulated along leprous walls; trembling dogs were routing about with a greed that was always disappointed. An occasional door was already open and the smell of sleep spread out into the street; by glimmering wicks mothers scrutinized the eyelids of their children for trachoma; almost all were in mourning, and many had been the wives of those carcasses one stumbles over on the turns of mountain tracks. The men were coming out gripping their hoes to look for someone who might give them work, God willing; subdued silence alternated with exasperated screams of hysterical voices; away over toward the Convent of the Holy Spirit a tin-colored dawn was beginning to tinge leaden clouds."|"The Leopard"|"Giuseppe Tomasi Di Lampedusa"
19:00|"seven this evening"|"“A moment, Uncle, just a moment.” It occurred to Father Pirrone that he ought to say a word to the “man of honor,” who knew nothing as yet. “Back home they’ll be sure to want to get things ready; anyway, they told me they’d be expecting you at seven this evening. Come then, and it’ll be a pleasure to see you.” And off he went, after embracing father and son."|"The Leopard"|"Giuseppe Tomasi Di Lampedusa"
"ap 10:30"|"half past ten"|"So frequent were the various and yet identical parties that the Prince and Princess of Salina had moved to their town palace for three weeks so as not to have to make the long drive from San Lorenzo almost every night. The ladies’ dresses would arrive from Naples in long black cases like coffins, and there would be a hysterical coming and going of milliners, hairdressers, and shoemakers, of exasperated servants carrying excited notes to dressmakers. The Ponteleone ball was to be one of the most important of the short season: important for all concerned because of the grandeur of the family, the splendor of the palace, and the number of guests; particularly important for the Salinas, who would be presenting Angelica, their nephew’s lovely bride-to-be, to “society.” It was still only half past ten, rather early to appear at a ball if one is Prince of Salina, whose arrival should be timed for when a fete is at its height. But this time they had to be early if they wanted to be there for the entry of the Sedàras, who were the sort of people (“they don’t know yet, poor things”) to take literally the hours on the gleaming invitation card. It had taken a good deal of trouble to get one of those cards sent to them; no one knew them, and the Princess Maria Stella had had to make a visit to Margherita Ponteleone ten days before; all had gone smoothly, of course, but even so it had been one of those little thorns that Tancredi’s engagement had inserted into the Leopard’s delicate paws."|"The Leopard"|"Giuseppe Tomasi Di Lampedusa"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"Till that moment accumulated irritation had given him energy; now with relaxed nerves he was overcome by tiredness; it was already two o’clock. He looked around for a place where he could sit down quietly, far from men, lovers and brothers, all right in their way, but always tiresome. He soon found it: the library, small, silent, lit, and empty. He sat down, then got up to drink some water which he found on a side table. “Only water is really good,” he thought like a true Sicilian, and did not dry the drops left on his lips. He sat down again; he liked the library and soon felt at his ease there; it put up no opposition to him because it was impersonal, as are rooms which are little used; Ponteleone was not a type to waste time in there. He began looking at a picture opposite him, a good copy of Greuze’s Death of the Just Man; the old man was expiring on his bed, amid welters of clean linen, surrounded by afflicted grandsons and granddaughters raising arms toward the ceiling. The girls were pretty, provoking, and the disorder of their clothes suggested sex more than sorrow; they, it was obvious at once, were the real subject of the picture. Even so, Don Fabrizio was surprised for a second at Diego always having this melancholy scene before his eyes; then he reassured himself by thinking that the other probably entered that room only once or twice a year."|"The Leopard"|"Giuseppe Tomasi Di Lampedusa"
06:00|"six in the morning"|"The ball went on for a long time, until six in the morning; all were exhausted and wishing they had been in bed for at least three hours; but to leave early was like proclaiming the party a failure and offending the host and hostess who had taken such a lot of trouble, poor dears."|"The Leopard"|"Giuseppe Tomasi Di Lampedusa"
12:00|midday|"For this was different now, quite different. Sitting in an armchair, his long legs wrapped in a blanket, on the balcony of the Hotel Trinacria, he felt life flowing from him in great pressing waves, with a spiritual roar like that of the Falls of the Rhine. It was midday on a Monday at the end of July, and away in front of him spread the sea of Palermo, compact, oily, inert, improbably motionless, crouching like a dog trying to make itself invisible at its master’s threats; but up there the static perpendicular sun was straddling it and lashing at it pitilessly. The silence was absolute. Under the high, high light Don Fabrizio heard no other sound than that inner one of life gushing from him."|"The Leopard"|"Giuseppe Tomasi Di Lampedusa"
