12:00|noon|"“Leave her here.” The command head was gazing out at the ugly gray bubblefab settlement with a curiously rapt expression on her face. Hard to believe it was the view—maybe she was listening to the machine systems talk, senses open and lost in the wash of transmission traffic. She snapped out of it abruptly and turned to face her crew. “We’ve got the cabins till noon. No point in moving her till we know what we’re doing.”"|"Woken Furies"|"Richard K. Morgan"
12:00|midday|"By midday, we were a couple of kilometers into the city and operational tension had given way to boredom. The nearest crews were half a dozen streets away on either side. Their vehicles showed up on the mapping equipment in lazily slewed parking formations, and if you tuned to the general channel you could hear the foot sweepers grumbling their way up and down buildings, all trace of the earlier make-a-killing enthusiasm gone from their voices."|"Woken Furies"|"Richard K.

"ap 01:05"|one-oh-five|"“Found, two, Quellcrist Falconer, nom de guerre of Settlement-years insurgent leader and political thinker Nadia Makita, born Millsport, April eighteenth, forty-seven (Colonial Reckoning), died October thirty-third, one-oh-five. Only child of Millsport journalist Stefan Makita and marine engineer Fusako Kimura. Makita studied demodynamics at Millsport University and published a controversial master’s thesis, ‘Gender Role Leakage and the New Mythology,’ as well as three collections of verse in Stripjap, which quickly attained cult status among the Millsport literati. In later life—”"|"Woken Furies"|"Richard K. Morgan"
"> 12:00"|"a little after noon"|"We pulled into Newpest harbor a little after noon the next day and crept to a mooring with painstaking care. The whole port was jammed up with hoverloaders and other vessels fleeing the threat of heavy weather in the eastern Gulf, and the harbormaster software had arranged them according to some counterintuitive mathematical scheme that the Haiduci’s Daughter didn’t have an interface for. Japaridze took the con on manual, cursing machines in general and the Port Authority AI in particular as we wound our way through the apparently random thickets of shipping."|"Woken Furies"|"Richard K.

00:00|midnight|"More correctly, Harlan’s Eve—technically, the festivities wouldn’t commence until midnight rolled around, and that was a solid four hours away. But even this early in the evening, with the last of the day’s light still high in the western sky, the proceedings had kicked off long since. Over in New Kanagawa and Danchi the downtown areas would already be a lurid parade of holodisplay and masked dance, and the bars would all be serving at state-subsidized birthday prices. Part of running a successful tyranny is knowing when and how to let your subjects off the leash, and at this the First Families were accomplished masters. Even those who hated them most would have had to admit that you couldn’t fault Harlan and his kind when it came to throwing a street party."|"Woken Furies"|"Richard K. Morgan"
"< 00:00"|"before midnight"|"Another long, quiet spell. The launch barge slipped away into the evening. Talking to Tres was always like this. Under normal circumstances, I’d have found it irritating, but now, caught in the calm before midnight, it was curiously restful."|"Woken Furies"|"Richard K. Morgan"
"< 00:00"|"A little before midnight"|"A little before midnight, Isa cut loose of Reach traffic control and Brasil took the con from the fair-weather cockpit. By then, conventional fireworks were already bursting, like sudden green and gold and pink sonar displays, all over the Millsport skyline. Pretty much every islet and platform had its own arsenal to fire off, and across the major landmasses like New Kanagawa, Danchi, and Tadaimako, they were in every park. Even some of the boats out in the Reach had laid in stock—from several of our nearest neighbors, rockets trailed drunken lines of sparks skyward, and elsewhere rescue flares were put to use instead. On the general radio channel, against a backdrop of music and party noise, some inane presenter warbled pointless descriptions of it all."|"Woken Furies"|"Richard K. Morgan"
"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"Faint, pervasive reek of rotting belaweed, poorly kept façades, and grumpy staff. Narrow streets, sliced with angles of hot sunlight. Damp, debris-strewn corners that only ever dried out in the hours around noon. A desultory coming and going of tourists who already looked miserable and exhausted with their cut-rate attempts at fun in the sun. I wandered through it all, trying to let the Envoy sense do the work, trying to suppress my headache and the pounding hatred that surged for release underneath."|"Woken Furies"|"Richard K. Morgan"
"ap ~ 05:00"|"about five"|"The overall honeycomb structure the nine pits formed rose about five meters out of the shallow waters of the Expanse and backed onto the low-lying bubbles of the wet-bunker complex at one side. Adjacent to this edge of the pits and crisscrossed with more gantried service walkways were the rows of smaller feeding pens and long rectangular exercise runs that Impaler had smashed through on her way into the farm. As near as I could make out, it was from the edge of this mangled wreckage that the blaster had fired."|"Woken Furies"|"Richard K. Morgan"
"ap 01:00"|one|"And I can’t help believing--hoping, maybe--that an orbital platform that can reach down and wipe out at one and the same time a hoverloader full of people and the minute bindings on two individual humans’ hands, that can destroy and record at the same time, that can decant whole minds back into datasystems on the ground--I can’t help believing that the same system may be able someday to look down at the fringes of the Nurimono Ocean and find a pair of decades-abandoned weed-grown cortical stacks."|"Woken Furies"|"Richard K.
