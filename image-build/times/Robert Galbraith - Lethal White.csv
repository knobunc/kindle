01:00|"one that morning"|"Since arriving at her parents’ house she had been occupied nonstop with tedious wedding chores, yet she had still managed to check her phone frequently and surreptitiously, hoping that Strike had called or texted. Alone in bed at one that morning she had checked her entire call history in the vain hope that she would find a missed communication, but had found the history deleted. Having barely slept in the last couple of weeks, she had concluded that she had made an exhausted blunder, pressed the wrong button, erased it accidentally…"|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"“He’s being watched today by my other guy,” said Strike, “but I need you outside his flat from six o’clock tomorrow morning.”"|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap > 05:00"|"After five"|"Another silence had ensued. After five sessions, Robin was used to them. In normal conversation, it would be considered rude or passive aggressive to leave these long pauses and simply watch the other person, waiting for them to speak, but in psychodynamic therapy, she had learned, it was standard."|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"Tonight, both surgeons would be attending a Royal College of Surgeons dinner with their wives, so Strike had left his BMW in its expensive garage. The hours rolled by in tedium, Strike mostly concerned with shifting the weight off his prosthesis at regular intervals as he leaned up against railings, parking meters and doorways. A steady trickle of clients pressed the bell at Dodgy’s door and were admitted, one by one. All were female and most were sleek and well-groomed. At five o’clock, Strike’s mobile vibrated in his breast pocket and he saw a text from his client."|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"

Speakers:"|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"He blinked at her, then moved aside. He was already drunk, she thought, and it was barely nine o’clock. Robin could hear Sarah’s braying laugh from the middle of the crowd outside."|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
01:00|"one in the morning"|"Of course you fucking did, thought Strike irritably, feeling in his pocket for more cigarettes.
“Enjoy yourself?” asked Lorelei in the taxi, at one in the morning.
“Not particularly,” said Strike, who was watching the headlights of oncoming cars."|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 08:45"|"quarter to nine"|"Robin texted Strike on Sunday evening to ask what he wanted her to do on Monday, because she had handed over all her jobs before taking a week’s leave. His terse response had been “come to office,” which she duly entered at a quarter to nine the following day, glad, no matter how matters stood between her and her partner, to be back in the shabby old rooms."|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 11:30"|"half past eleven"|"At half past eleven the following Friday, a suited and freshly shaven Strike emerged from Green Park Tube station and proceeded along Piccadilly. Double-deckers rolled past the windows of luxury shops, which were capitalizing on Olympics fever to push an eclectic mix of goods: gold-wrapped chocolate medals, Union Jack brogues, antique sporting posters and, over and again, the jagged logo that Jimmy Knight had compared to a broken swastika."|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 00:00"|"Twelve o’clock"|"Twelve o’clock arrived, but Chiswell did not. “Georgina,” however, was friendly and informative about the club. She and her husband, the chef, lived on the premises. Strike could not help but reflect that this must be some of the most expensive real estate in London. To maintain the little club, which, Georgina told him, had been established in 1857, was costing somebody a lot of money."|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 05:00"|"Five o’clock"|"“—no, Kinvara, I can’t. I’ve just told you why, I’ve got a lunch meeting… no, you can’t… Five o’clock, then, yes… yes… yes!… Goodbye!”"|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 07:30"|"half past seven"|"Lorelei Bevan lived in an eclectically furnished flat over her thriving vintage clothes store in Camden. Strike arrived that night at half past seven, a bottle of Pinot Noir in one hand and his mobile clamped to his ear with the other. Lorelei opened the door, smiled good-naturedly at the familiar sight of him on the phone, kissed him on the mouth, relieved him of his wine and returned to the kitchen, from which a welcome smell of Pad Thai was issuing."|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
01:00|"one in the morning"|"Strike and Lorelei had met at Eric Wardle’s birthday party. It had been an awkward evening in some ways, because Strike had seen Coco there for the first time since telling her by phone that he had no interest in another date. Coco had got very drunk; at one in the morning, while he was sitting on a sofa deep in conversation with Lorelei, she had marched across the room, thrown a glass of wine over both of them and stormed off into the night. Strike had not been aware that Coco and Lorelei were old friends until the morning after he woke up in Lorelei’s bed. He considered that this was really more Lorelei’s problem than his. She seemed to think the exchange, for Coco wanted nothing more to do with her, more than fair."|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
00:00|midnight|"At close to midnight Strike retired to his flat for some much-needed sleep, rose early on Sunday, and transferred his attention to Geraint Winn, remaining hunched at the computer until the light began to fade again, by which time a new cardboard file labeled CHISWELL sat beside him, fat with miscellaneous but crosschecked information on Chiswell’s two blackmailers."|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 00:30"|"half past twelve"|"Strike rose early on Tuesday morning. After showering, putting on his prosthesis and dressing, he filled a thermos with dark brown tea, took the sandwiches he had made the previous evening out of the fridge, stowed them in a carrier bag along with two packets of Club biscuits, chewing gum and a few bags of salt and vinegar crisps, then headed out into the sunrise and off to the garage where he kept his BMW. He had an appointment for a haircut at half past twelve, with Jimmy Knight’s ex-wife, in Manchester."|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 04:10"|"ten past four"|"Finally, at ten past four, her luck changed. Geraint Winn swaggered around the corner, rather tipsy after what seemed to have been a prolonged lunch, and in sharp contrast to his wife, he seemed delighted to meet her as she set off towards him."|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 05:45"|"quarter to six"|"Robin left the house at a quarter to six the next morning. The sky was a faint blush pink and the morning already warm, justifying her lack of jacket. Her eyes flickered towards the single carved swan as she passed their local pub, but she forced her thoughts back onto the day ahead and not the man she had left behind."|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"“Back at DCMS, he’s got a meeting at ten,” said Izzy. “I can’t—well, because he’s very busy, you know, the Olymp—yes… goodbye.”"|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 06:00"|six|"Robin, who had been due to arrive at six, was still absent at half past. Unable to resist the picture on the menu any longer, Strike ordered himself cod and chips and a second pint, and read a long article in The Times about the upcoming Olympics opening ceremony, which was really a long list of the ways in which the journalist feared it might misrepresent and humiliate the nation."|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 06:45"|"quarter to seven"|"By a quarter to seven, Strike was starting to worry about Robin. He had just decided to call her when she came hurrying in through the door, flushed, wearing glasses that Strike knew she did not need and with an expression that he recognized as the barely contained excitement of one who has something worthwhile to impart."|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 03:30"|"three thirty"|"Strike obediently inserted the earbuds and Robin switched on the tape in her handbag.
“… at three thirty, Aamir.”
The Welsh male voice was interrupted by the sound of a mobile phone ringing. Feet scuffled near the power point, the ring ceased and Geraint said:"|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 02:00"|2|"Need a favor. Barclay’s done a 10-day stretch on Jimmy Knight, but he’s just found out his wife’s got to work over the weekend & he can’t get anyone else to look after the baby. Andy leaves for a week in Alicante with the family tonight. I can’t tail Jimmy, he knows me. CORE are joining an anti-missile march tomorrow. Starts at 2, in Bow. Can you do it?"|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"“… and by ten o’clock, no later, or I won’t have time to read the whole bloody thing. And tell Haines he’ll have to talk to the BBC, I haven’t got time for a bunch of idiots talking about inclu—Kinvara.”"|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 01:00"|one|"“I told you,” growled Chiswell, “I’d be in meetings till one, and if it’s about those bloody stud fees again—”"|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 08:50"|"ten to nine"|"Strike’s text requesting an update reached Robin at ten to nine, as she arrived in the corridor where Izzy and Winn’s offices lay. So keen was she to see what he had to say that she stopped dead in the middle of the deserted passage to read it."|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
04:00|"four in the morning"|"It was four in the morning, the hopeless hour when shivering insomniacs inhabit a world of hollow shadow, and existence seems frail and strange. Strike, who had fallen into a doze, woke abruptly in the hospital chair. For a second, all he felt was his aching body and the hunger that tore at his stomach. Then he saw his nine-year-old nephew, Jack, who lay motionless in the bed beside him, jelly pads over his eyes, a tube running down his throat, lines coming out of neck and wrist. A bag of urine hung from the side of the bed, while three separate drips fed their contents into a body that appeared tiny and vulnerable amid the softly humming machines, in the hushed, cavernous space of the intensive care ward."|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
04:10|"ten past four in the morning"|"At ten past four in the morning, the waiting room was mercifully deserted. Strike turned on the mobile he had kept switched off while on the ward and saw a dozen missed calls from Robin and one from Lorelei. Ignoring them, he texted Lucy who, he knew, would be awake in the Rome hotel to which, shortly past midnight, her passport had been delivered by the taxi driver who had found it. Lucy had implored Strike to send a picture of Jack when he got out of surgery. Strike had pretended that the picture wouldn’t load. After the stress of the day, Lucy didn’t need to see her son ventilated, his eyes covered in pads, his body swamped by the baggy hospital gown."|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"

17:00|"five in the afternoon"|"By the time Robin found her way back across London to the unfamiliar cricket ground, it was five in the afternoon and Matthew’s charity match was over. She found him back in his street clothes in the bar, fuming and barely speaking to her. Matthew’s side had lost. The other team was crowing."|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 05:30"|"half past five"|"The sound of Robin and Barclay climbing the metal stairs to the office at half past five made a welcome distraction from Strike’s increasingly dark mood."|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"“I want to see you tomorrow morning at ten o’clock,” he told Strike. “Not at my office. Come to the flat in Ebury Street.” He turned away, then, as an afterthought, turned back. “You too,” he barked at Robin."|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"“We shouldn’t be seen together any more tonight,” he told her, as they passed over the threshold into a blaze of ochre, scarlet and gold. “There was a café in Ebury Street, not far from Chiswell’s house. I’ll meet you there at nine o’clock tomorrow, and we can face the firing squad together. Go on, you go ahead.”"|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 09:05"|"five past nine"|"Where the hell was Strike? It was five past nine and she wanted company. She also wanted to know what had happened after he left the reception with Charlotte. Anything would be preferable to sitting here, thinking about Matthew."|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
"< 12:00"|"almost midday"|"It was almost midday when Strike arrived at Izzy’s mews house in Upper Cheyne Row in Chelsea, a quietly expensive stretch of houses which, unlike those of Ebury Street, were tastefully mismatched. Izzy’s was small and painted white, with a carriage lamp beside the front door, and when Strike rang the doorbell she answered within a few seconds."|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
04:00|"4 a.m."|"She had woken with a yelp at 4 a.m., with the sensation of being still tangled in the nightmare in which she had been carrying a whole bag full of listening devices through darkened streets, knowing that men in masks were following her. The old knife wound on her arm had been gaping open and it was the trail of her spurting blood that her pursuers were following, and she knew she would never make it to the place where Strike was waiting for the bag of bugs…"|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"At six o’clock on Wednesday morning, Robin, who had again slept in the spare room, got up and dressed herself in jeans, T-shirt, sweatshirt and trainers. Her backpack contained a dark wig that she had bought online and which had been delivered the previous morning, under the very nose of the skulking journalist. She crept quietly downstairs, so as not to wake Matthew, with whom she had not discussed her plan. She knew perfectly well that he would disapprove."|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 06:00"|6|"“What time of death are we looking at?”
“Between 6 and 7 a.m.,” said Oliver.
“But he was fully dressed,” mused Robin."|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
07:00|"7 a.m."|"“What time of death are we looking at?”
“Between 6 and 7 a.m.,” said Oliver.
“But he was fully dressed,” mused Robin."|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
"> 06:00"|"just after 6 a.m."|"“Yeah, she said something about that,” said Oliver, flicking backwards and forwards through his notebook to find the information. “Yeah, he made two calls just after 6 a.m. First to his wife, then to his son.”"|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
"< 00:00"|"before midnight"|"“A neighbor saw her go into the house on Ebury Street the evening before and come out shortly afterwards with a bag, two hours before her husband came back. A taxi driver picked her up halfway down the street and took her to Paddington. She was caught on camera on the train back to wherever she lives—is it Oxfordshire?—and apparently there was someone at the house when she got home, who can vouch for the fact that she arrived there before midnight and never left again until the police came round to tell her Chiswell was dead. Multiple witnesses to her whole journey.”"|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
02:30|"half-past two in the morning"|"Had Lorelei only accepted his sincere apology, he might have felt like sex. However, by half-past two in the morning, at which time she finally burst into tears of mingled self-recrimination and self-justification, he was too tired and bad-tempered to accept physical overtures which would, he feared, assume an importance in her mind that he did not want to give them."|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"This has to end, he thought, as he rose, hollow-eyed and dark-jawed, at six o’clock, moving as quietly as possible in the hope that she would not wake before he made his way out of her flat. Forgoing breakfast, because Lorelei had replaced the kitchen door with an amusingly retro bead curtain that rattled loudly, Strike made it all the way to the top of the stairs to the street before Lorelei emerged from the dark bedroom, sleep tousled, sad and desirable in a short kimono."|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap ~ 10:00"|"About ten"|"“Yeah, Chiswell left a letter of wishes with his will, asking that Kinvara has the right to remain in the house lifelong, or until she remarries. How old’s this Pringle?”
“About ten, I think.”
“Well, it’ll be interesting to see whether the family honor Chiswell’s request given that one of them thinks Kinvara killed him. Mind you, it’s a moot point whether she’ll have enough money to keep the place running, from what Izzy told me last night. Izzy and her sister were each left fifty grand, and the grandchildren get ten grand apiece, and there’s hardly enough cash to honor those bequests. That leaves Kinvara with what’s left from the house in Ebury Street once it’s sold off and all other personal effects, minus the valuable stuff that was already put into the grandson’s name. Basically, he’s leaving her with the junk that wasn’t worth selling and any personal gifts he gave her during the marriage.”"|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap > 10:30"|"Shortly after half past ten"|"Shortly after half past ten, they turned off the motorway onto a country road that wound down into the valley where the tiny village of Woolstone lay nestled. Robin parked beside a hedgerow full of Traveler’s Joy, so that Strike could reattach his prosthesis. Replacing her sunglasses in her handbag, Robin noticed two texts from Matthew. They had arrived two hours earlier, but the alert of her mobile must have been drowned out by the racket of the Land Rover."|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap ~ 09:00"|"around nine"|"“No, I ate something, first, and showered,” said Raphael. “I wasn’t exactly looking forward to dealing with her. She and I aren’t each other’s favorite people. I got here around nine.”"|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 06:00"|six|"“Izzy was just trying to convince me that Kinvara could have sneaked back to Oxfordshire, after bumping off Chiswell between six and seven in the morning. I don’t know whether she realizes there are multiple witnesses to every stage of Kinvara’s journey from Ebury Street. The police probably haven’t gone into detail with the family yet, but I think, once the penny drops that Kinvara can’t have done it in person, Izzy’ll start suggesting she hired a hitman. What did you make of Raphael’s various outbursts?”"|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"

"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"A little under eight hours, seven cups of tea, three bathroom breaks, four cheese sandwiches, three bags of crisps, an apple and twenty-two cigarettes later, Strike had repaid all his subcontractors’ expenses, ensured that the accountant had the firm’s latest receipts, read Hutchins’ updated report on Dodgy Doc and tracked several Aamir Malliks across cyberspace in search of the one he wanted to interview. By five o’clock he thought he had him, but the photograph was so far from “handsome,” which was how Mallik had been described in the blind item online, that he thought it best to email Robin a copy of the pictures he had found on Google Images, to confirm that this was the Mallik he sought."|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
06:00|"6 a.m."|"“Where were you at 6 a.m. on the thirteenth of July?” Strike asked Aamir."|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"

"ap 08:30"|"half past eight"|"Robin emerged from Camden Town station at half past eight on Friday morning and set off for the jewelry shop where she was to have her day’s trial, furtively checking her appearance in every window that she passed."|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 08:45"|"quarter to nine"|"The Wiccan’s jewelry shop, Triquetra, was tucked away in Camden Market. Arriving outside at a quarter to nine, Robin found the stallholders of Camden Lock Place already busy, but the store locked up and empty. After a five-minute wait, her employer arrived, puffing slightly. A large woman whom Robin guessed to be in her late fifties, she had straggly dyed black hair that showed half an inch of silver root, had the same savage approach to eyeliner as Bobbi Cunliffe and wore a long green velvet dress."|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"“All right, I need to be off,” the owner announced at eleven, while Flick was serving a tall German woman who was dithering between two packs of tarot cards. “Don’t forget: one of you needs to be focused on stock all the time, in case of pilfering. My friend Eddie will be keeping an eye out,” she said, pointing at the stall selling old LPs just outside. “Twenty minutes each for lunch, taken separately. Don’t forget,” she repeated ominously, “Eddie’s watching.”"|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
06:00|"six in the morning"|"“Forget psychology or probability: we’re considering opportunity,” said Strike, blowing out a long jet of smoke. “Nothing I’ve heard so far precludes Raphael being at Ebury Street at six in the morning. I know what you’re going to say,” he forestalled her, “but it wouldn’t be the first time a phone call had been faked by a killer. He could have called his own mobile with Chiswell’s to make it seem as though his father had ordered him down to Woolstone.”"|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"
01:00|"one in the morning"|"He was wrong: it was Robin’s name he saw when he peered groggily at the screen, and it was, moreover, one in the morning. Momentarily forgetting that she had been out at a party with Flick, Strike sat up hurriedly and the cardboard file that had been lying on his chest slid smoothly off him, scattering its various pages across the floorboards, while Strike squinted, blurry-eyed, at the photograph Robin had just sent him."|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"

As part of her effort to try and keep the atmosphere amicable, she wanted to get up to see him before he left."|"Lethal White"|"Robert Galbraith"

"ap 00:30"|"Half of one"|"The strings of the violins in the symphony swooped and fell as Strike sat down. From the fawn carpet to the furniture, all of which might have been designed in the seventies, everything seemed to be in different shades of brown. Half of one wall was covered in built-in shelves holding what he thought must be at least a thousand CDs. On a table to the rear of the room was a stack of Braille manuscripts. A large, framed photograph of a teenage girl sat on the mantelpiece.

An hour later, she had received a call from Tegan Butcher, who had not required much persuasion to agree to an interview.
