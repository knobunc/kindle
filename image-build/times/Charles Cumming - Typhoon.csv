emerged from the still waters of the South China Sea shortly before dawn on
Thursday 10 April 1997. Exhausted by the long crossing, he lay for some time in
the shallows, his ears tuned to the silence, his eyes scanning the beach. It
was 5:52 a.m. By his calculations the sun would begin to rise over Dapeng Bay
in less than fifteen minutes. From that point on he would run the greater risk
of being spotted by a passing patrol. Keeping his body low against the slick
black rocks, he began to crawl towards the sanctuary of trees and shrubs on the
far side of the beach."|Typhoon|"Charles Cumming"

was six o'clock. Wang looked back across the narrow stretch of water and felt a
tremor of elation which numbed, for an instant, his near-constant dread of
capture. He reached out and felt for the bark of the tree, for the sand at his
feet. This place is freedom, he told himself. This shore is
England. Starling Inlet was less than two kilometres wide, but in the
darkness the tide must have pulled him west towards Sha Tau Kok, or even east
into the open waters of Dapeng. Why else had it taken him so long to swim
across? The professor was fit for a man of his age and he had swum well; at
times it was as if his desire to succeed had pulled him through the water like
a rope. Wiping seawater from the neck of the rucksack he removed several seals
of waterproof tape and withdrew a tightly bound plastic bag. A few minutes
later he had discarded his T-shirt and shorts and dressed himself in damp blue
jeans, a black cotton shirt and dark sweater. On his feet he wore grey socks
and the counterfeit tennis shoes from the market in Guangzhou."|Typhoon|"Charles Cumming"

hit the bars of Wan Chai, maybe take a girl up to the Peak or go gambling out
at Macau. ""Enjoy yourself,"" his father had told him.

the tables. She was wearing a black summer dress and a white coral necklace
that seemed to glow under the lights against her tanned skin. Joe must have
picked up on the crackle in the room because he pushed his chair back from the

me, then at Joe, checking around the restaurant to see if she recognized
anyone. Joe kissed her only briefly on the cheek before she settled into the

together, like a couple who had been married for five or ten years, not two
twenty-six-year-olds in only the second year of a relationship. But if you

his naked body against hers for the first time, and Joe found himself adrift in
a world that he had never known: a world in which he was so physically and
emotionally fulfilled that he wondered why it had taken him so long to seek it
out. There had been girlfriends before, of course--two at Oxford and one just a
few days after he had arrived in Hong Kong--but with none of them had he
experienced anything other than the brief extinguishing of a lust, or a few
weeks of intense conversations about the Cultural Revolution followed by
borderline pointless sex in his rooms at Wadham. From their first moments

police siren. So much information had been spilled over the course of the
interview that he was finding it difficult to pick his way through it. Joe knew
that it was his job to report the uprising in Yining, and the extent of
separatist fervour across Xinjiang was certainly valuable intelligence. But he
could not piece together Wang's role in the struggle and felt that there were
holes in his story. And what of the human rights issues?
To Joe's shame, he was surprised by how little impact the news of the torture
had had on him. The suffering of these jailed men was somehow an inchoate
thing, a nebulous concept around which he could not assemble sympathy. Only
when Wang had spoken of the man beating his head against the radiator had he
felt even the faintest tremor of discomfort. What was wrong with him? Had he
grown immune to human suffering already? Had three years in SIS turned him into
a machine? How was it possible to sit in a room with a man like Wang Kaixuan

him like an electric shock. He rolled out of bed and moved to a sitting
position, turning down the volume on the radio and holding his head in his
hands. Through open curtains Miles Coolidge could see fog enshrouding the Peak.
Kitty, he recalled, had left at 5 a.m. There was an empty highball glass on the
floor at his feet, a discarded condom, an ashtray full of half-smoked
cigarettes and an unopened bottle of warm white wine on the bedside table. When
Miles drank heavily, he made sure to consume at least a litre of water before
going to bed, the only effective preventative measure against a hangover that
he had ever encountered. He made his way slowly to the shower, adjusted the
nozzle setting to ""Massage"" and blasted his scalp in a shuddering jet of
scalding water. Afterwards, naked and dripping water on the spiral staircase,
he walked slowly downstairs to the open-plan kitchen and sitting room, where he
retrieved three Panadol Extra from a drawer in his desk, juiced four oranges
and made a mug of instant coffee which he drank while scrambling eggs. Americans,
he had been repeatedly told, drank filthy coffee, and Miles was oddly proud of
this, regularly importing vast cans of Folger's Instant
into Hong Kong after trips back home to the States."|Typhoon|"Charles Cumming"

sat in the steam room at his local gym expunging the poisons of the previous
evening: the tequilas of Samba's, the vodkas of Luard Road, the lines of coke
aggressively snorted from Kitty's flat, soft belly at 3 a.m. Yet the fight with
Joe preyed on his mind. Miles realized that he had behaved unpleasantly in the
club. He knew that Joe would be angry. Their friendship was a delicate web into
which the American frequently pushed a fat, obnoxious finger, but he cared
enough about Isabella to make amends. Joe, after all, was the link to the woman

compact-disc player on the windowsill and put a Beethoven piano concerto on

several plates of unnecessary vegetable dishes. Above their heads, an ageing
air-conditioning unit hummed, threatening to drip water onto the carpet. Towards

Hong Kong and drop him into the lap of British intelligence so that we all

she come to his apartment to discuss the documentary on a night when he knew

left the consulate at five in order to be home in good time to prepare supper,
have a shower and put on a clean set of clothes. An enormous amount of time and
thought had gone into every element of the evening. Should he shave or leave a stubble? Should he cook a three-course dinner, or would
that look ostentatious? Was it better to have the apartment looking lived-in
and scruffy, or reasonably clean and organized? Miles had been to the best
supermarket in town--Oliver's in the Prince's building--to pick up the
ingredients for a decent meal: a rack of lamb, some expensive French cheese, a
homemade apple pie and a tub of Ben and Jerry's vanilla. He then blew HK$150 on
a bottle of Sancerre at Berry Bros & Rudd and a further HK$230 on a Robert
Mondavi Pinot Noir. At about seven o'clock he began scattering CD cases on the
floor near his hi-fi and placed a stack of old New Yorkers and
well-thumbed paperbacks on the coffee table in the sitting room. If Isabella
sat on the sofa at any point in the evening, she would see that Miles was
reading Graham Greene's Brighton Rock, Jacques Gernet's Daily Life
in China on the Eve of the Mongol Invasion, Mikhail Lermontov's A Hero
of Our Time, and a brace of novels--Ladder of Years and The
Accidental Tourist--by Anne Tyler. No harm, after all, in being seen to
read fiction by women. (The book that Miles was actually reading--and was quite
gripped by--was The Firm, momentarily stashed in a cupboard in the
spare bedroom next to Michael Crichton's Disclosure and a hygienically
unreliable copy of Playboy.)"|Typhoon|"Charles Cumming"

arrived at eight o'clock. She was wearing a dark blue Agnes B dress and a pair
of wedge-heeled espadrilles. It was a hot night, muggy in the Mid-Levels, and
she had wanted to dress in a way that was striking without seeming provocative.
Miles buzzed her in and came to the door of his apartment wearing a pair of
blue jeans and a white linen shirt. He had taken a shower an hour earlier and
the fresh warm smell of his skin tugged in Isabella's stomach in a way that
surprised her. She thought back to her dream and felt oddly embarrassed. Music
was playing in the sitting room ahead of them--The Fugees' The Score--and
a smell of garlic and rosemary wafted through from the kitchen."|Typhoon|"Charles Cumming"

event attended by several hundred of the island's business and diplomatic
elite. When the post-Tamar fireworks began to explode over Victoria

walls of the club became so thick with condensation that a waiter had to be

hundred miles away, in Tiananmen Square, a specially invited crowd of the Party
faithful consigned 150 years of shame and humiliation at the hands of the
British to the dustbin of history, celebrating the safe return of their beloved
Hong Kong with a fireworks display that shook the foundations of the Forbidden

Communist Party, Ansary Tursun took little interest in the handover
celebrations. At around nine o'clock, on what was a typically warm summer
evening in Urumqi, he left his parents' apartment on Tuan Jie Lu and made his
way to the bazaar at Shanxi Hangzi. He walked through the narrow channels of the
market, past stalls selling vegetables, sweaters, nuts and dried fruit,
occasionally stopping to sift through a table of cassettes or to make brief
conversation with Uighur friends from the neighbourhood. The market was crowded
and noisy: Uighur songs competed with the new popular music from India and
combined with the shouts and arguments of the stallholders to create a
discordant yet somehow innocuous din. Large crowds were gathered around
television screens showing highlights of the fireworks display over Victoria
Harbour."|Typhoon|"Charles Cumming"
"~ 02:00"|"about two o'clock in the morning"|"Professor Wang Kaixuan
claimed that he watched the Hong Kong celebrations on a small black-and-white
television set at his apartment in Urumqi, although I later discovered that
this, like so many of his utterings, was a lie. TRABANT had calculated--correctly
as it turned out--that the eyes of Chinese Intelligence would be momentarily
averted by the handover celebrations and that it would therefore be a good
opportunity to hold a meeting in a room at the Holiday Inn to discuss
developments with TYPHOON. Wang must have watched highlights of the broadcast
when he returned home at about two o'clock in the morning. His wife was ill in
bed next door, which gave him the opportunity to mutter insults under his
breath whenever Chinese triumphalism threatened to get out of hand. Drinking a
beer on the very couch where his slain son had slept for almost every night of
his twenty-five-year life, Wang marvelled at the stoicism of the magnificent
British soldiers as they paraded in the rain, and raised his glass of beer to
Patten as tears fell from the governor's eyes. How many other Han Chinese, he
wondered, on this night of triumph for the Motherland, would be toasting the
health of the ""Triple Violator"" and his ""capitalist running dogs"" in London?"|Typhoon|"Charles Cumming"
"> 00:00"|"a few minutes after midnight"|"One
thing, in particular, provoked Wang's ire. In Jiang Zemin's speech, delivered
in the Convention Centre just a few minutes after midnight, the British were
accused of having subjected Hong Kong to more than a century of ""vicissitudes.""
I remember the Mandarin word he used--cangsang--because it provoked
considerable argument among the press corps at the time, not least because
nobody was entirely sure of its precise meaning. Had Jiang meant ""difficulties""
or ""problems?"" Was ""vicissitudes"" the correct translation? Had he really intended
to insult the British at such a delicate and sensitive moment in their history?
But Professor Wang Kaixuan was in no doubt, and the childish slur appalled him.
What problems, after all, had Hong Kong suffered under colonial rule? A few riots in the fifties and sixties, all of them engineered by
agents of Chairman Mao. By comparison, China in the same period had been
decimated by communist rule: millions dead from famine; families torn apart by
the insanity of the Cultural Revolution; minority ethnic groups tortured and
flung into prison. The hypocrisy was breathtaking."|Typhoon|"Charles Cumming"

o'clock"|"I
sensed there was trouble brewing the moment I saw Billy Chen forcing his way
through the sweat-and rain-soaked crowds of Lan Kwai Fong. It was about eleven
o'clock on the night of the 29th. Imagine a Mardi Gras
or New Year's Eve in a sticky, tropical climate, with thousands of
over-excited, emotionally exhausted, inebriated Westerners puking and kissing
and laughing and dancing and you'll have some idea of what it was like to be
out in Hong Kong that night. Joe, Isabella, Miles and myself--along
with about a dozen other colleagues and hangers-on--were drinking in F-Stop, a
long-established bar halfway up Lan Kwai Fong. Joe had left the bar momentarily
to buy cigarettes at a nearby convenience store and had been gone about five
minutes. The bar was popular with Chinese yuppies but Chen still looked out of
place squeezing himself through the bottleneck of customers at the entrance,
wearing a pair of cheap jeans, trainers and a dirty white T-shirt. He was
sweating profusely and his eyes had a kind of wild, narcotic stare that I can
still picture vividly to this day."|Typhoon|"Charles Cumming"
06:00|"six in the morning"|"One
additional characteristic of Joe's three-year posting to London was that he was
bored. Travelling by Tube to Vauxhall station every morning doesn't really
compare to the eye-popping spectacle of taking the Star Ferry across Victoria
Harbour. Nor does liaising with Whitehall on intelligence requirements compare
to the excitement and challenge of obtaining that intelligence oneself. A night
owl by nature, Joe missed the bars and restaurants of Kuala Lumpur, the crush
and sweat of Asian streets. Going out in Singapore was a case of picking up the
phone, arranging to meet a friend two hours later, and of staying out until
five or six in the morning. Going out in London involved making an arrangement
two weeks in advance, securing names on a guest list, queuing for half an hour
for entry into an overpriced, crowded nightclub, and then dodging piles of
vomit on the way home. In any case, by 2004 most of Joe's friends from the old
days had settled down. He felt increasingly disconnected from their world of
nappies and marriage. Joe was fond of quoting Goethe's maxim--""A man can stand
anything except a succession of ordinary days""--and longed to be posted back to
Asia. ""That's where I'm most at home,"" he said. ""That's where I'm happiest."""|Typhoon|"Charles Cumming"

live band played the best of Carly Simon; a guy dressed up in a Spiderman
outfit, attached to the roof by a harness, cleaning the glass windows 100ft

friend of yours--and because I'm an extremely decent, upstanding person--I
grabbed my jacket, had a shower and took a cab down to the Westin. Was at least
twenty minutes late, knackered, etc, but Joe couldn't have been nicer about it.
He was in the lobby making conversation (in fluent, very old-school Mandarin)
with an octogenarian cleaning woman who had bags under her eyes like Huan Huan
the Panda. She looked as though nobody had bothered to speak to her since the
Cultural Revolution and was busy telling Joe stories about all the old
buildings in her neighbourhood which had been knocked down by developers. He
took one look at me and must have realized what a mess I was in because he did
most of the talking for the first twenty minutes. He also paid the bill for
both of us as we went in and before long we were three-quarters of the way

on CNN at eight o'clock, he watched a news report about a car bomb in Iraq and
contemplated sending a message to Vauxhall Cross asking them to comb the files
for mention of Tursun's name. But Joe was a stubborn man and it became a point
of operational pride that he should remember where he had heard the name before
London woke in the morning. If he could not come up with an answer, he would
admit defeat and contact Waterfield. Yet he had retrieved Platoon from
his memory, and the violins of Barber's ""Adagio"" still soared in his mind. What
was the difference? It was just a question of locating the melody of Ansary
Tursun."|Typhoon|"Charles Cumming"

arranged to meet at the restaurant at nine. Joe took the lift down to the
first-floor bar, where he sank a vodka and tonic and nodded at the band, a New
Orleans jazz trio who had been playing at the hotel for the previous fortnight
and knew Joe on sight. He bought the pianist a Coke (""I'm AA,"" he had disclosed
during their one and only conversation), malt whiskies for the vocalist and
drummer, and signed the bill to his room. There was a long queue for cabs
downstairs, so he walked a block east along Nanjing Lu and hailed one off the

the corner of Hengshan Road and Dong Ping Road, Zapata's is a wild, chaotic
Shanghai nightspot that relies for its atmosphere on a cocktail of cheap
alcohol, elastic opening hours and hot Asian weather. Joe arrived direct from
the restaurant with Tom, Megan and Ricky, who led him across a crowded outdoor
terrace where tanned, freshly showered expats sank Heinekens and talked shop in
midnight temperatures of twenty degrees. Conscious of Zhao Jian's disclosure
that Sammy, Miles's Pakistani contact, was a regular customer, Joe scanned the
crowds for his face, but there were too many people to make an effective
assessment."|Typhoon|"Charles Cumming"

Beijing, where it was passed to me in Fish Nation, a tiny, British-style
fish-and-chip shop, by the head of media and public affairs at the British
embassy. To my knowledge, she thought she was handing over documents relating
to Britain's recent decision to lift an embargo on the sale of arms to China. The
package consisted of a padded A4 envelope in which Waterfield had placed two
typewritten sheets of paper and a compact disc. I flew to Shanghai that night,
placed the papers inside an edition of the China Daily, hid the disc
inside a bootlegged copy of Blood on the Tracks, and presented both
items to Joe at dinner. At about midnight, he left me in Park 97 with Tom and
Ricky and returned to his hotel."|Typhoon|"Charles Cumming"

have often wondered if Joe had Megan vetted. He was never prepared to say. When
a spy meets a strange girl in a strange restaurant, and that girl turns out to
be as forthcoming as Megan, the spy has a right to feel suspicious. Why was she
calling him at two o'clock in the morning? Why was it so important to Megan
that they spend the night together? Joe was certain that she was legitimate,
but as soon as he had hung up the phone, he removed the CD from the laptop and
placed it in the small black safe located in the main wardrobe of his room. Afterwards,
switching on the hot water in both the bath and shower, he created a room of
steam to defeat the hotel fire alarm and burned the pages of Waterfield's report
in the sink."|Typhoon|"Charles Cumming"

days after checking out of the hotel he went shopping for groceries in
Xiangyang Market. It was raining heavily and Joe was carrying an umbrella as
well as a briefcase full of documents from Quayler. The market, which has since
been razed to the ground to make way for a shopping centre, was a crowded sea
of stalls protected only by flimsy tarpaulin coverings which dripped water onto
the ground. Butchers in white chef's hats took meat cleavers to joints of pork
and chicken and failed to meet Joe's eye when he paid for them. At a vegetable
stall he bought radishes and husks of white corn, beetroot for homemade
borscht, as well as mangoes, bananas and apples to eat for breakfast. One of
the pleasures of renting the flat was the opportunity he now had to prepare and
cook his own food; from vast hessian sacks at the perimeter of the market Joe
scooped dried mushrooms and black beans, nuts and rice, planning to host a
flat-warming dinner party to which he would invite Tom and Megan and their
friends. Weighed down with plastic bags, he eventually walked out onto Huaihai
Road at about six o'clock, in the hopeless aspiration of hailing a cab. Every
other shopper had the same idea. It was as if all of Shanghai was sheltering
from the tropical rain beneath the eaves and awnings on the street. As the
thick wet traffic fizzed past, Joe swore under his breath and knew that it
would be hours before he saw a vacant taxi."|Typhoon|"Charles Cumming"

went running in Xujiahui Park; he read the same paragraph of the same article
in the Pharmaceutical Journal eight times. How would Isabella react to
seeing him? With indifference? With studied cool? He

be called home. Looking back on the two eventful days that followed, it occurs

went on for another half-hour. Every angle was covered, every nuance of Wang's
possible behaviour anticipated and thought through. Then Joe settled the bill
and headed back to his hotel for an early night. The next morning he was at my
apartment by eight and we travelled north to scout the immediate area around
the language school. Feeling somewhat ridiculous, I practised cycling around
while talking to Joe on the phone, using an earpiece and a microphone clipped
to my shirt. By midday, I knew every bus stop, restaurant and traffic light
within a two-block radius. That said, Haidian is the university district in
Beijing and I did not feel that I knew the rest of the area particularly well. Having
lived in the city for just a few months, I was still frequently spun round by
the grid system of seemingly identical streets; there are very few landmarks in
Beijing, no hills, nothing to give you a bearing. My worry was that Wang would
vanish in a section of the city that I simply did not know or recognize. There
were times when every corner in the capital looked the same. How would I then
be able to give Wang's location to Joe, who might be five or six blocks away in
a cab?"|Typhoon|"Charles Cumming"

things turned out, we got lucky. At 4:45 p.m. on the Wednesday, I leaned my
bicycle against the exterior wall of the Agosto and dialled Joe's mobile. We

away, on the opposite side of the street, sitting on a metal railing with a
street map of Beijing open on his lap."|Typhoon|"Charles Cumming"

was a grey, smoggy day and there was plenty of traffic between us. When Wang
came out, he would be unlikely to spot Joe through what amounted to a
permanent, moving screen of dust and cars. The cab driver was waiting on the
next corner, reckoning it was his lucky day, because Joe had picked him from
five different drivers that he'd spoken to at the rank outside his hotel and
handed him the equivalent of a hundred and fifty dollars to be his
chauffeur-on-call all day. At about five to five, a gorgeous Chinese girl
wearing a knee-length qipao walked past me and Joe made a joke about
giving me the rest of the day off to follow her. I was grateful for his easy
humour because it cut through the tension of the long wait. I was ashamed by
how edgy I was feeling; at this early stage, to avoid drawing attention to
myself, I had my phone in my hand and the hard plastic casing was sticky and
damp against my ear."|Typhoon|"Charles Cumming"

after six o'clock, Wang crossed to the north corner of the gym area and drank
water from a public fountain. He had changed back into his work clothes and
draped a towel around his neck and now began to walk slowly towards the
north-eastern corner of the park. Joe tailed him through an oasis of dappled
light and evening birdsong, blending easily with the large numbers of tourists
who were passing through the park on their way back from the Forbidden City. Throughout
this time I was waiting for Joe to call me in, but he had decided not to risk
the small chance that Wang might see me and recognize my face from the school. He
was also certain that Wang lived nearby; with any luck, he would not have to
tail him for more than a few blocks."|Typhoon|"Charles Cumming"

pounds of Goma-2 ECO gelignite, three detonators and three mobile telephones. Celil

he returned to the seventh floor, walking back into the cinema, it is possible
that Ansary Tursun would have passed Ablimit Celil. Did they look at one
another? Did they find some way of acknowledging the enormity of what they were
about to set in motion? The lobby was packed with teenagers on dates, students
queuing for popcorn, laowais trying to work out which films were
dubbed and which ones had English subtitles. Beneath a bank of television
screens playing trailers for forthcoming features, Celil paid for his ticket
using a credit card. The card had been registered in a false name, to a Dubai
postal address, by Mohammed Hasib Qadir. Ablimit had used it many times and it
had never given him any problems.

checking his watch. ""After eight o'clock?"""|Typhoon|"Charles Cumming"

leaves it exactly where it was. Chances are I won't even get close to Ablimit
tonight. He's too cautious. Neither Yun nor I even know what he looks like. I'm
taking a gamble that he's either going to leave by the western fire exit or
take the stairs to the restaurants. You'll have to try and keep Memet at the
bar for as long as you can. Make regular trips to the bathroom. Go out and buy
chewing gum if you have to. Get him drunk. Get him a girl. If I haven't had any
luck with Ablimit by quarter-past nine, I'll jump in a cab and come to you. Is
that all right?"""|Typhoon|"Charles Cumming"

cars and mopeds clogging up the French Concession and decided to walk to
Xujiahui. It was a stifling night, horns and engines adding to the bass notes
of heat and pollution which thrummed through the Chinese summer. He headed
south along Hengshan Road, passing Zapata's, passing a strip of bars where
girls whistled at him as he walked by, trying to lure him inside for a drink. He
made it to the entrance of the Paradise City at 8:15, by which point Abdul
Bary, eating sushi with his wife and daughter in the Teppenyaki Shinju, had
begun to complain of a stomach ache. His wife, wearing a necklace which her
husband had given to her as a birthday present at the start of the meal, placed
her chopsticks in their holder and put a protective hand on his back."|Typhoon|"Charles Cumming"

lifted the lid of the bin and removed several handfuls of damp paper towels, a
crumpled sheet of newspaper and an empty packet of cigarettes. He unzipped the
rucksack, removed the IED, and placed it at the base of the bin. The phone, he
saw, was active. The read-out said 8:23 p.m. He covered the bomb with the
newspaper, camouflaged the device with the towels and closed the lid. Someone
was knocking on the door. Bary flushed the toilet and washed his hands. He
placed six rolls of toilet paper in the rucksack to give it weight and bulge,
and smiled as he opened the door."|Typhoon|"Charles Cumming"

Celil saw Miles Coolidge enter the cinema at half-past eight. His wife was with
him. The cinema, to his frustration, was half empty, a flaw in the plan which
he blamed on the Han appetite for bankrupt American culture. Miles and Isabella
sat down. Ablimit was in his usual seat, alone, at the far end of row Q. Just
as Ansary had done, he had wedged his rucksack against the rear wall of the
cinema. When Miles approached in twenty minutes' time, he would have no idea
that it was there."|Typhoon|"Charles Cumming"

Moazed's first reaction to Joe's warning had been to close his phone and to
stand stock still in the entrance of the bar, in what he would later describe
as a state of suspended animation. He was just a few feet away from the
cloakroom. Shahpour caught the eye of a young British man making his way up the
steps from Nanyang Road. He wanted to reach out and grab him, to warn him to
stay away, but his courage was lacking. It was 8:47 p.m."|Typhoon|"Charles Cumming"

undeclared SIS officer from the embassy--let's call him Bob--almost beat me to
it, and before I had a chance to find anything out about Joe's condition I was
being ushered downstairs to the canteen, where Bob bought me ""a quiet cup of
coffee"" and proceeded to lay out what he described as ""the respective positions

Joe regained consciousness
at 10:25 on the morning of 13 June.
His
first memory was of a conversation between two Chinese nurses standing in the
corridor outside his room. He heard one of them saying something about being
late for a seminar, to which the other replied, ""I'll cover for you."" Joe then
became aware of an intense, brittle dryness at the back of his throat and
called for water."|Typhoon|"Charles Cumming"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o'clock"|"Joe
asked me to explain. I said that Celil, upon hearing the alarm and seeing the
audience streaming out of the cinema, had panicked and detonated his IED
several minutes before nine o'clock. He had taken his own life in doing so.
Miles, alerted by Joe's warnings, had pulled Isabella out of her seat and
dragged her towards him. An eyewitness reported that he pushed his wife into
Joe's arms with the words, ""Take her, look after her,"" and then turned and ran
back into the panic and gloom of the cinema, either to confront Celil directly,
to try to prevent him from detonating the bomb, or to assist in the evacuation.
Shortly after this point, the bomb went off."|Typhoon|"Charles Cumming"
