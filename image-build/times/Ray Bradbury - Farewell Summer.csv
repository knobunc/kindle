"ap < 08:00"|"toward eight o’clock"|"All the fiery-pink windows of the dying day shone upon this arch-criminal who walked in their brilliant gaze, half smile-scowling toward destiny, toward eight o’clock, toward the camptown gathering of the great Green Town Confederacy and everyone sitting by firelight singing, “Tenting tonight, tenting tonight, tenting on the old camp grounds . . . ”"|"Farewell Summer"|"Ray Bradbury"
"ap 01:10"|"one hour and ten minutes"|"“How long’s it been? Tom, check your watch. How long?”
“Mmmm, one hour and ten minutes.”
“Jeez!”"|"Farewell Summer"|"Ray Bradbury"
"ap 01:12"|"One hour and twelve minutes"|"“Don’t tell him, Tom!”
Tom consulted his watch, proudly. “One hour and twelve minutes!”
“Holy smoke!” Charlie squeezed his face into a mask. “My stomach’s a prune ! They’ll have to feed me with a tube. I’m dead. Send for my folks. Tell ’em I loved ’em.” Charlie shut his eyes and fl ung himself backward onto the fl oorboards."|"Farewell Summer"|"Ray Bradbury"
"ap 00:00"|"twelve o’clock"|"At that very instant the town clock boomed twelve o’clock, noon, the long iron strokes which came as salvation because Doug leapt to the edge of the porch and stared toward the town square, up at that great terrible iron monument, and then down at the grassy park, where all the old men played at their chessboards."|"Farewell Summer"|"Ray Bradbury"

12:00|noon|"Here the lion and the hartebeest lay together, here the jackass became unicorn, here on Saturday noon an elderly man could be found underneath a not too imaginary bough, eating bread in the guise of sandwiches and pulling briefly at a jug of cellar wine."|"Farewell Summer"|"Ray Bradbury"
"< 00:00"|"Just before midnight"|"Just before midnight, Doug woke to that terrible boredom that only sleep ensures."|"Farewell Summer"|"Ray Bradbury"
00:00|midnight|"Doug was out the midnight door so fast he almost forgot to catch the screen before it slammed."|"Farewell Summer"|"Ray Bradbury"
00:00|midnight|"Now, at midnight, it was the unlit time of the special school, so Doug leaned forward and whispered in Grandpa’s ear, “1899.”"|"Farewell Summer"|"Ray Bradbury"
00:00|midnight|"Just then the great clock across town, an immense moon, a full moon of stunned sound and round illumination, cleared its ratchety throat and let free a midnight sound."|"Farewell Summer"|"Ray Bradbury"
00:00|Midnight|"Midnight, said the clock. Time, it said, Darkness. Flights of night birds flew up to carry the final peal away, out over the lake and into the night country, gone."|"Farewell Summer"|"Ray Bradbury"
00:00|Midnight|"Doug swallowed hard. Before he had a chance to speak, Tom, now that everybody was looking at him, said slowly, “The only thing that comes to mind right now is maybe we stop the courthouse clock. You can hear that darned thing ticking all over town. Bong! Midnight! Whang! Get outta bed! Boom! Jump into bed! Up down, up down, over and over.”"|"Farewell Summer"|"Ray Bradbury"
00:00|midnight|"They were together at last, Doug and the clock that had risen like a lunar face throughout his life at every midnight. At any moment the great machine might uncoil its brass springs, snatch him up, and dump him in a grinder of cogs to mesh its endless future with his blood, in a forest of teeth and tines, waiting, like a music box, to play and tune his body, ribboning his fl esh."|"Farewell Summer"|"Ray Bradbury"
"~ 02:00"|"about two in the morning"|"At about two in the morning Doug went down to the icebox and brought a dish of ice cream up to Tom, which, he figured, might cause Tom to speak more freely."|"Farewell Summer"|"Ray Bradbury"
12:00|noon|"The next day, at noon, Douglas walked Home from school to have lunch. When he got there, his mother sent him straight next door to his grandparents’ house. Grandpa was waiting, sitting in his favorite chair in a pool of light from his favorite lamp, in the library, where all was stillness and all the books on the shelves were standing alert and ready to be read."|"Farewell Summer"|"Ray Bradbury"
00:00|midnight|"Bong!
The great clock, striking midnight.
He felt himself, half-crippled, making it to the window and opening it wide to the sound of the great clock."|"Farewell Summer"|"Ray Bradbury"
00:00|midnight|"Quartermain leaned out the window and gazed at the moon, a silver sliver in the midnight sky. The moon, the clock, his creaking bones. Quartermain recalled numberless nights spent looking out the window at the sleeping town, although in years past his back was not stooped, his joints not stiff ; in years past, looking out this very window, he was young, fit as a fiddle, full of piss and vinegar, just like those boys . .."|"Farewell Summer"|"Ray Bradbury"
12:00|noon|"The cake stood like a magnificent Alp upon the kitchen table. To the odors of morning were added the smells of snow upon a white mountain, the aroma of frosted blossoms and candied roses, of petal pink candles and translucent icing. There it was, like a distant hill in a dream of the future, the cake as white as noon clouds, the cake in the shape of collected years, each candle ready for the lighting and blowing out."|"Farewell Summer"|"Ray Bradbury"
21:00|"nine o’clock at night"|"Tom and Charlie and Bo followed Doug up the side of the ravine and stood in front of the strange house at nine o’clock at night. In the distance, the courthouse clock bonged off the hour."|"Farewell Summer"|"Ray Bradbury"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"“From what I’ve heard, at eight o’clock, no,” said Doug. “And not at nine. But starting around ten, strange sounds start to come from the house. I think we should hang around and fi nd out. Besides, Lisa-bell said that she and her friends were going to be here. Let’s wait and see.”"|"Farewell Summer"|"Ray Bradbury"

"ap > 10:00"|"a little after ten"|"They waited as the moon got higher. And then, a little after ten, as the last peals of the courthouse clock faded away on the night air, they heard the noises. From inside the house, faint at first, almost imperceptible, there came a sound of rustling and scraping, as if someone was shifting trunks from one room to another."|"Farewell Summer"|"Ray Bradbury"
00:00|midnight|"Alone, Doug stood for a long while staring at the old house. Then he heard someone coming up the path behind him. He turned, his fists clenched, ready to defend himself against the midnight assailant."|"Farewell Summer"|"Ray Bradbury"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"Calvin C. Quartermain woke because some one had said something or called out in the night air. But that was impossible. Nobody or nothing had. He looked out the window at the great face of the courthouse clock and could almost hear it clearing its throat, preparing to announce three in the morning. “Who’s there?” Quartermain said into the cool night air."|"Farewell Summer"|"Ray Bradbury"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"Don’t go yet. Stay. I need a friend.
His friend stayed. And they talked. At three in the morning.
“Why do I feel so happy?” said Quartermain. “What’s been going on? Was I mad? Am I cured? Is this the cure?” Quartermain’s teeth chattered with an outrageous laugh."|"Farewell Summer"|"Ray Bradbury"
"ap 03:00"|three|"I wonder, he thought, where, oh just where in hell he has gone?
The great courthouse clock struck three. And Mr. Quartermain slept.
"|"Farewell Summer"|"Ray Bradbury"
"ap 03:00"|three|"Douglas opened his eyes in the dark. The town clock finished the last stroke of three."|"Farewell Summer"|"Ray Bradbury"
"ap 04:00"|four|"They thought, they slept.
The town clock struck four.
And Grandma sat up in the dark and named the season just now over and done and past."|"Farewell Summer"|"Ray Bradbury"
