12:00|midday|"“It wouldn’t be proper!” Imogene was shocked. To have been shown favor earlier that day with an arm and a short walk might be considered a mere whimsical informality from an eccentric genius.

It was certainly better than Imogene’s regular midday fare. Not to say the staff ate poorly – they had full roast once a week! Vampires believed in keeping their servants well fed for the sake of everyone’s health, but meals rarely varied from the wholesome stew arena. Rumor was (now that Imogene knew to pay attention and keep her ears perked) that Madame Lefoux and the countess were not friendly.

But Henry couldn’t steal anything this way."|"Romancing the Inventor"|"Gail Carriger"

“Gone three.”
“I’m glad I woke then. Sleep any more and I should never rest tonight.”"|"Romancing the Inventor"|"Gail Carriger"
12:00|midday|"The only thing that noticeably changed was that they now used each other’s first names. Their midday meals were awkward things, scrabbling to find a topic that didn’t touch on delicate territory."|"Romancing the Inventor"|"Gail Carriger"
