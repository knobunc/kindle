09:00|"nine in the morning"|"New York was bad enough. By nine in the morning the fake, country-wet freshness that somehow seeped in overnight evaporated like the tail end of a sweet dream. Mirage-gray at the bottom of their granite canyons, the hot streets wavered in the sun, the car tops sizzled and glittered, and the dry, cindery dust blew into my eyes and down my throat."|"The Bell Jar"|"Sylvia Plath"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"At seven I had heard my mother get up, slip into her clothes and tiptoe out of the room. Then the buzz of the orange squeezer sounded from downstairs, and the smell of coffee and bacon filtered under my door. Then the sink water ran from the tap and dishes clinked as my mother dried them and put them back in the cupboard."|"The Bell Jar"|"Sylvia Plath"
"< 15:00"|"almost three in the afternoon"|"My mother took care never to tell me to do anything. She would only reason with me sweetly, like one intelligent, mature person with another.
“It’s almost three in the afternoon.”
“I’m writing a novel,” I said. “I haven’t got time to change out of this and change into that.”"|"The Bell Jar"|"Sylvia Plath"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"I didn’t know why I had never bought any of these papers before. They were the only things I could read. The little paragraphs between the pictures ended before the letters had a chance to get cocky and wiggle about. At home, all I ever saw was the Christian Science Monitor, which appeared on the doorstep at five o’clock every day but Sunday and treated suicides and sex crimes and airplane crashes as if they didn’t happen."|"The Bell Jar"|"Sylvia Plath"
12:00|noon|"Hitchhiking occurred to me, but I had no idea which of all the routes out of Boston led to Chicago. It’s easy enough to find directions on a map, but I had very little knowledge of directions when I was smack in the middle of somewhere. Every time I wanted to figure what was east or what was west it seemed to be noon, or cloudy, which was no help at all, or nighttime, and except for the Big Dipper and Cassiopeia’s Chair, I was hopeless at stars, a failing which always disheartened Buddy Willard."|"The Bell Jar"|"Sylvia Plath"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"I had just strolled in through the glass doors of the terminal and was browsing over the rack of colored tour leaflets and schedules, when I realized that the bank in my home town would be closed, as it was already mid-afternoon, and I couldn’t get any money out till the next day.
My appointment at Walton was for ten o’clock.
At that moment, the loudspeaker crackled into life and started announcing the stops of a bus getting ready to leave in the parking lot outside. The voice on the loudspeaker went bockle bockle, the way they do, so you don’t understand a word, and then, in the middle of all the static, I heard a familiar name clear as A on the piano in the middle of all the tuning instruments of an orchestra."|"The Bell Jar"|"Sylvia Plath"
12:00|noon|"Somehow, in the broad, shadowless light of noon, the water looked amiable and welcoming."|"The Bell Jar"|"Sylvia Plath"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"Philomena Guinea’s black Cadillac eased through the tight, five o’clock traffic like a ceremonial car. Soon it would cross one of the brief bridges that arched the Charles, and I would, without thinking, open the door and plunge out through the stream of traffic to the rail of the bridge. One jump, and the water would be over my head."|"The Bell Jar"|"Sylvia Plath"
"ap 00:00"|"twelve o’clock"|"“Then my doctor sent me to a psychiatrist at this big hospital. I had an appointment for twelve o’clock, and I was in an awful state. Finally, at half past twelve, the receptionist came out and told me the doctor had gone to lunch. She asked me if I wanted to wait, and I said yes.”"|"The Bell Jar"|"Sylvia Plath"
"ap 00:30"|"half past twelve"|"“Then my doctor sent me to a psychiatrist at this big hospital. I had an appointment for twelve o’clock, and I was in an awful state. Finally, at half past twelve, the receptionist came out and told me the doctor had gone to lunch. She asked me if I wanted to wait, and I said yes.”"|"The Bell Jar"|"Sylvia Plath"
00:00|midnight|"The article under the picture told how this girl had disappeared from her home on August 17th, wearing a green skirt and a white blouse, and had left a note saying she was taking a long walk. When Miss Greenwood had not returned by midnight, it said, her mother called the town police."|"The Bell Jar"|"Sylvia Plath"
00:00|midnight|"A dark, midnight picture of about a dozen moon-faced people in a wood. I thought the people at the end of the row looked queer and unusually short until I realized they were not people, but dogs. Bloodhounds used in search for missing girl. Police Sgt. Bill Hindly says: It doesn’t look good."|"The Bell Jar"|"Sylvia Plath"
12:00|noon|"“I don’t see what women see in other women,” I told Doctor Nolan in my interview that noon. “What does a woman see in a woman that she can’t see in a man?”"|"The Bell Jar"|"Sylvia Plath"
"ap 04:05"|"Five past four"|"I had met Irwin on the steps of the Widener Library. I was standing at the top of the long flight, overlooking the red brick buildings that walled the snow-filled quad and preparing to catch the trolley back to the asylum, when a tall young man with a rather ugly and bespectacled, but intelligent face, came up and said, “Could you please tell me the time?”
I glanced at my watch. “Five past four.”
Then the man shifted his arms around the load of books he was carrying before him like a dinner tray and revealed a bony wrist."|"The Bell Jar"|"Sylvia Plath"
"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"I was roused by a tap on my door. It was past midnight, and the asylum quiet as death. I couldn’t imagine who would still be up."|"The Bell Jar"|"Sylvia Plath"
"ap 00:00"|"twelve o’clock"|"All at once music started to come out of the air on every side. Then it stopped, and we heard Lenny’s voice say “This is your twelve o’clock disc jock, Lenny Shepherd, with a roundup of the tops in pops. Number Ten in the wagon train this week is none other than that little yaller-haired gal you been hearin’ so much about lately . . . the one an’ only Sunflower!”"|"The Bell Jar"|"Sylvia Plath"
12:00|noon|"The packed snow creaked underfoot, and everywhere I could hear a musical trickle and drip as the noon sun thawed icicles and snow crusts that would glaze again before nightfall."|"The Bell Jar"|"Sylvia Plath"
"ap ~ 10:00"|"about ten o’clock"|"When I made my wan entrance into the office at about ten o’clock, Jay Cee stood up and came round her desk to shut the door, and I sat in the swivel chair in front of my typewriter table facing her, and she sat in the swivel chair behind her desk facing me, with the window full of potted plants, shelf after shelf of them, springing up at her back like a tropical garden."|"The Bell Jar"|"Sylvia Plath"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"At seven the next morning the telephone rang.
Slowly I swam up from the bottom of a black sleep. I already had a telegram from Jay Cee stuck in my mirror, telling me not to bother to come in to work but to rest for a day and get completely well, and how sorry she was about the bad crabmeat, so I couldn’t imagine who would be calling."|"The Bell Jar"|"Sylvia Plath"
"ap 02:00"|two|"“A date?” Buddy looked surprised. “Who is it?”
“It’s two,” I said, “Peter the Hermit and Walter the Penniless.”
Buddy didn’t say anything, so I said, “Those are their nicknames.”"|"The Bell Jar"|"Sylvia Plath"
"ap 03:00"|"three-o’clock"|"We danced about a mile apart the whole time, until during “Auld Lang Syne” he suddenly rested his chin on the top of my head as if he were very tired. Then in the cold, black, three-o’clock wind we walked very slowly the five miles back to the house where I was sleeping in the living room on a couch that was too short because it only cost fifty cents a night instead of two dollars like most of the other places with proper beds."|"The Bell Jar"|"Sylvia Plath"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"This boy—his name was Eric—said he thought it disgusting the way all the girls at my college stood around on the porches under the porch lights and in the bushes in plain view, necking madly before the one o’clock curfew, so everybody passing by could see them. A million years of evolution, Eric said bitterly, and what are we? Animals."|"The Bell Jar"|"Sylvia Plath"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"A green eye glowed on the bed beside me. It was divided into quarters like a compass. I reached out slowly and closed my hand on it. I lifted it up. With it came an arm, heavy as a dead man’s, but warm with sleep.
Constantin’s watch said three o’clock.
He was lying in his shirt and trousers and stocking feet just as I had left him when I dropped asleep, and as my eyes grew used to the darkness I made out his pale eyelids and his straight nose and his tolerant, shapely mouth, but they seemed insubstantial, as if drawn on fog. For a few minutes I leaned over, studying him. I had never fallen asleep beside a man before."|"The Bell Jar"|"Sylvia Plath"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"An hour later I lay in my hotel bed, listening to the rain. It didn’t even sound like rain, it sounded like a tap running. The ache in the middle of my left shin bone came to life, and I abandoned any hope of sleep before seven, when my radio-alarm clock would rouse me with its hearty renderings of Sousa."|"The Bell Jar"|"Sylvia Plath"
12:00|midday|"At midday the grayness paled a bit, and we parked in an icy turnoff and shared out the tunafish sandwiches and the oatmeal cookies and the apples and the thermos of black coffee Mrs. Willard had packed for our lunch."|"The Bell Jar"|"Sylvia Plath"
12:00|noon|"At my left, the rope tow deposited skier after skier on the snowy summit which, packed by much crossing and recrossing and slightly melted in the noon sun, had hardened to the consistency and polish of glass. The cold air punished my lungs and sinuses to a visionary clearness."|"The Bell Jar"|"Sylvia Plath"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"We were sitting on my bed in a mess of dirty cotton dresses and laddered nylons and gray underwear, and for ten minutes Doreen had been trying to persuade me to go to a country club dance with a friend of somebody Lenny knew which, she insisted, was a very different thing from a friend of Lenny’s, but as I was catching the eight o’clock train home the next morning I felt I should make some attempt to pack."|"The Bell Jar"|"Sylvia Plath"
