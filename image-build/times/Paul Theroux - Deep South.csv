12:00|noon|"It occurs in other languages, among them German, where the word is Neger. It was used by Nazi propagandists to induce fear or loathing (jazz was Negermusik), and in his speeches Reich Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels raised the specter of a defeated Germany being overrun by betrunken Neger (“drunken niggers”). Germans have come to see Neger as an objectionable word (often replaced by Farbige, colored, or Schwarze, black), which is why Negerkuss (“nigger kiss”), the chocolate-covered marshmallow treat beloved by German children, was not long ago renamed Schokokuss (“chocolate kiss”). The French word nègre is not so insulting but has belittling implications—for example, nègre is also slang for ghostwriter. Defying the formality of the Belgian king Baudouin and other luminaries, in the celebration of the Congo’s independence in 1960 in Leopoldville, Patrice Lumumba, the newly elected prime minister, angrily used the word, saying, “We have known sarcasm and insult, endured blows morning, noon and night, because we were ‘niggers’ [nègres]. Who will forget that a Black was addressed in the familiar tu, not as a friend, but because the polite vous was reserved for Whites only.”"|"Deep South"|"Paul Theroux"

At one long table were fourteen big white men in overalls sitting at their noontime meal. Hearing the tinkle of the doorbell, they lifted their querying, somewhat disapproving faces from their plates of chicken-fried steaks and mashed potatoes and stared at me, twenty-eight scrutinizing eyes, no hello—very odd for the South, where I had gotten used to a greeting—and a shadow of serious suspicion, and a fork in one hand and a knife in the other."|"Deep South"|"Paul Theroux"

Storms are frequent here, twisters especially, barreling across the region of the plains known as Tornado Alley, unimpeded by any mountain range, gathering speed, flattening the grass, battering the corn stalks, whirling into splinters any dwelling in its path, crushing the house trailers, felling the trees. Multiple tornadoes were forecast, with high winds and heavy rain, and the words that caught my attention: “baseball- and golf-ball-sized hail.”"|"Deep South"|"Paul Theroux"

It was midday, the temperature in the nineties, all of us gathered in the shade of the pecan tree. These men had been up since before dawn, and this was their first meal of the day.

It was the county seat, altogether a rather bleak place, much bleaker and nakeder in the glare of noon. On the sunny day that I spent walking its streets I was reminded that Philadelphia is still the headquarters of the Mississippi Klan.

This time, as before, I studied the column titled Reason for Visit and noted the scrawls next to the names: “Food,” “Clothes,” “Water,” “Light bill,” and more: “Utilities,” “Assistance.” “Food” was the reason most frequently cited, and the others listed almost as often.

When I got to the racecourse there was no letup, and toward noon the rain came harder, thrashing the oaks at the perimeter of the racecourse, gusts of wind driving against the tents and shelters of people who lined the enclosure adjacent to it.
