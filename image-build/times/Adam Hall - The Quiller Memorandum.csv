I showed my second set of papers to avoid delay."|"The Quiller Memorandum"|"Adam Hall"

The dog had been sent to bed: it had a kennel on the roof and went up by the fire-escape. She’d said ‘Friend’ and it went off without another look at me. Mostly we’d sat drinking and listening to things like Night Bounce that she put on the record-player for me, an eerie tune that suited her personality, lean, brooding, and cynical. She wore an all-black after-ski outfit more like a skin-tight track-suit with the top slit to the waist and a thonged belt. Nudity would have been less explicit."|"The Quiller Memorandum"|"Adam Hall"

5.14. Nothing to do.
I left my room and went along the corridor until I found a door open. The room was empty. The curtains were filmy but opaque enough by winter daylight.

We spent half an hour dodging about and then he went into a phone-kiosk to report on the situation. His orders became obvious within ten minutes: he took a taxi and I followed him in mine, all the way back to the Hotel Zentral in Mariendorf.

That is why we are able to avail ourselves of this supreme opportunity. For seven hours the entire Mediterranean area will be in darkness and - according to news reports - under a shroud of radioactive fallout.

I walked from the doors to the gates, to get some idea of what these conditions were. There was no risk in this that I wasn’t already faced with.
