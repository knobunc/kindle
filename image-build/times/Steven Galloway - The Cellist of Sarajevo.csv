16:00|"four o’clock in the afternoon"|"At four o’clock in the afternoon on 27 May 1992, during the siege of Sarajevo, several mortar shells struck a group of people waiting to buy bread behind the market on Vase Miskina. Twenty-two people were killed and at least seventy were wounded. For the next twenty-two days Vedran Smailović, a renowned local cellist, played Albinoni’s Adagio in G Minor at the site in honour of the dead. His actions inspired this novel, but I have not based the character of the cellist on the real Smailović, who was able to leave Sarajevo in December of 1993 and now lives in Northern Ireland."|"The Cellist of Sarajevo"|"Steven Galloway"
16:00|"four in the afternoon"|"Then sound returns to the world. She isn’t sure what has happened. She doesn’t know what a man playing a cello in the street at four in the afternoon has done to her. You will not cry, she tells herself, and she wills herself calm until after the cellist has finished, risen and returned to the building he came from. There will be no crack in her."|"The Cellist of Sarajevo"|"Steven Galloway"
16:00|"four o’clock in the afternoon"|"Arrow crosses and sits in the spot where the mortar landed, the spot where, later today, the cellist will sit. She knows that twenty-two people died here and a multitude were injured, will not walk or see or touch again. Because they tried to buy bread. A small decision. Nothing to think about. You’re hungry, and come to this place where maybe there will be some bread to buy. Of all the places to go, you come here. Of all the days to come, a particular one chooses you. At four o’clock in the afternoon. It’s just something you do because life is a series of tiny, unavoidable decisions. And then some men on the hills send a bomb through the air to kill you. For them, it was probably just one more bomb in a day of many. Not notable at all."|"The Cellist of Sarajevo"|"Steven Galloway"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"Arrow smiles. A plan is beginning to crystallize in her mind. She backtracks up the street, to the west, and selects a building on the south side that affords her a view of the area where she knows her enemy will be. She then walks back to where the cellist will play and sits, confirming the logistics of what she has mapped out. She wonders if the cellist is aware that someone’s protecting him, and if he is, whether this knowledge brings him comfort. The street is still empty, and the air is cool. Soon the sun will begin to warm the ground and more people will venture out. At four o’clock some of these people might lean against a wall on the southern side of the street and watch the cellist play for a few minutes before continuing on their way. They will be unaware of what goes on above them until she fires, and even then it will be just one more gunshot in a day of hundreds."|"The Cellist of Sarajevo"|"Steven Galloway"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"“Every day, at four o’clock.” She turns towards him as she says this, as if there’s something he doesn’t understand. “Every day he sits there and plays. People go and listen. Some leave flowers. I’ve been several times. Sometimes I listen all the way through, and sometimes I leave after only a few minutes.”"|"The Cellist of Sarajevo"|"Steven Galloway"
"< 09:00"|"nearly nine in the morning"|"It’s nearly nine in the morning, and again she sits in the spot where the cellist will play. But something has changed. Where yesterday she sat with her back straight and her eyes alert to the street around her, today her shoulders sag and pull her spine into a curve. She stares at the ground in front of her feet."|"The Cellist of Sarajevo"|"Steven Galloway"
"ap < 04:00"|"just before four o’clock"|"She has decided to give this sniper the benefit of doubt. She will assume he’s as good as, if not better than, she is. She will take all the necessary precautions to avoid detection. Though she’s been in this apartment for nearly five hours, she won’t enter her line of fire for a few more minutes, until just before four o’clock. She won’t even give him a chance of spotting her. She’s already gone to the decoy apartment and repositioned her dummy rifle and hat, so if he notices them he won’t have the opportunity to see that the gun he thinks is looking for him is in the exact same position as the day before."|"The Cellist of Sarajevo"|"Steven Galloway"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"This realization stuns her, and she feels an impulse to leave her rifle where it lies and return to her apartment. But she doesn’t. She stays where she is. At four o’clock the cellist comes out and her finger tightens around the trigger."|"The Cellist of Sarajevo"|"Steven Galloway"
"ap 02:00"|"Two o’clock"|"“Where?” she asks. She can’t see anything worth shooting at.
“Two o’clock, fifty metres south of the yellow bus.”
Arrow looks, and just past a burned-out bus a man is walking up the hill. He’s trying to stay close to the buildings, but he’s miscalculated the line of sight and is in easy range. But something’s wrong about him. He’s old, probably in his early sixties, and his clothes are too worn for him to be a soldier. There’s no confidence in his walk, no authority, and he’s clearly unarmed."|"The Cellist of Sarajevo"|"Steven Galloway"
"ap < 04:00"|"almost four o’clock"|"Arrow continues crawling. “I know exactly what I’m doing,” she says as she reaches the inner hallway and gets to her feet. She walks to the stairway quickly, but doesn’t run. She doesn’t put her rifle over her shoulder, isn’t sure she won’t need it. The stairway is dark, and she’s forced to make her way to the ground blind. Every sound she hears brings the expectation that Hasan will follow her, but he doesn’t. She emerges from the stairway and walks across the lobby towards the rear entrance to the building. The two guards are still there, but again they pay her no notice. Just before she steps through the double doors and into the street, she checks her watch and sees it is almost four o’clock. Her feet hit the pavement, and she begins to run."|"The Cellist of Sarajevo"|"Steven Galloway"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"He has been to hear the cellist play every day since the shelling at the brewery. Each day at four o’clock he stands in the street with his back pressed against a wall and watches as the city is reassembled and its people awaken from hibernation. Today is the last day the cellist will play. Everyone who died in the street while waiting for bread will be accounted for. Kenan knows no one will play for the people who died at the brewery, or those who were shot crossing the street, or any of the other victims of countless attacks. It would take an army of cellists. But he’s heard what there was to hear. It was enough."|"The Cellist of Sarajevo"|"Steven Galloway"
"> 12:00"|"past noon"|"It’s past noon. He’s been at this intersection for over two hours now. It seems like days. Stuck in a sort of no man’s land, kept but not kept from going to the bakery, where a small loaf of bread waits for him. He can cross whenever he likes. At no time has anyone come and said, no, Dragan, you can’t cross. It’s always been his decision."|"The Cellist of Sarajevo"|"Steven Galloway"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"He walks west, towards the bakery. He should be there in ten more minutes. But then his hand feels a small plastic pill bottle and a scrap of paper with an address in his pocket, and he knows he’ll be a little late. Still, no more than a half-hour. He’ll get his bread, and then he’ll come back this way, whether the sniper’s working or not. On his way home he’ll make a small detour to the street just south of the market and wait for four o’clock, so he can tell Emina what happened on the last day the cellist played."|"The Cellist of Sarajevo"|"Steven Galloway"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"ARROW BLINKS. SHE HAS BEEN WAITING FOR A LONG time. She slept well, didn’t wake even once during the night. There’s one sound she’s been listening for, and it’s here. Footsteps echo in the hall outside her door, heavy boots coming up the stairs. They’re making an effort to be quiet, but the stairwell isn’t helping, its acoustics unaccommodating to the aims of men requiring stealth. Arrow opens her eyes. It’s still early in the morning, not quite seven o’clock."|"The Cellist of Sarajevo"|"Steven Galloway"
16:00|"four o’clock in the afternoon"|"He played for twenty-two days, just as he said he would. Every day at four o’clock in the afternoon, regardless of how much fighting was going on around him. Some days he had an audience. Other days there was so much shelling that no one in their right mind would linger in the street. It didn’t appear to make any difference to him. He always played exactly the same way."|"The Cellist of Sarajevo"|"Steven Galloway"
16:00|"four o’clock in the afternoon"|"He will stand at the window all night and all through the next day. Then, at four o’clock in the afternoon, twenty-four hours after the mortar fell on his friends and neighbours while they waited to buy bread, he will bend down and pick up his bow. He will carry his cello and stool down the narrow flight of stairs to the empty street. The war will go on around him as he sits in the small crater left at the mortar’s point of impact. He’ll play Albinoni’s Adagio. He’ll do this every day for twenty-two days, a day for each person killed. Or at least he’ll try. He won’t be sure he will survive. He won’t be sure he has enough Adagios left."|"The Cellist of Sarajevo"|"Steven Galloway"
