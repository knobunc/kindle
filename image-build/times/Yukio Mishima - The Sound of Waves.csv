12:00|noonday|"The residence of the lighthouse-keeper was as quiet as though in a deep noonday sleep. He could see the back of a watchman seated at the desk in the watchhouse. A radio was blaring music."|"The Sound of Waves"|"Yukio Mishima"
13:00|"one in the afternoon"|"On that day alone the island’s ferryboat, the Kamikaze-maru, left Uta-jima at the unusual hour of one in the afternoon. Formerly the stubborn old-timer who captained this putt-putt launch of something under twenty tons had refused as an abomination any departure from the established schedule. But then had come the year when his own son went on the excursion. Ever since then he had understood what they meant by saying the children would squander their money if the boat got to Toba too much ahead of time for their train to leave, and had grudgingly agreed to let the school authorities have their own way with the schedule."|"The Sound of Waves"|"Yukio Mishima"
12:00|noon|"All this she knew. The interior of a house dark even at noon, the somber pangs of childbirth, the gloom at the bottom of the sea—these were the series of interrelated worlds in which she lived her life."|"The Sound of Waves"|"Yukio Mishima"
12:00|midday|"On the morning of the storm both mother and daughter slept late. The storm had been building up since the evening before, and they had kept vigil most of the night with the lighthouse-keeper, who took his responsibilities most seriously. Very much contrary to their usual ways, their midday meal was also their breakfast. And after the table had been cleared, the three of them passed the time quietly indoors, shut in by the storm."|"The Sound of Waves"|"Yukio Mishima"
02:00|"2 A.M."|"So Yasuo was looking up at the water-drawing roster, posted where the most people passed. He found the name Miyata written precisely under the 2 A.M. column. This was Hatsue’s turn."|"The Sound of Waves"|"Yukio Mishima"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"Yasuo clicked his tongue. He wished it were still octopus season, as the boats did not put out quite so early in the morning then. During the squid season, which had now arrived, the boats had to reach the fishing grounds in the Irako Channel by the crack of dawn. So every household was up preparing breakfast by three o’clock at the latest, and impatient houses were sending up smoke from their cooking fires even earlier."|"The Sound of Waves"|"Yukio Mishima"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"Even so, this was preferable to next week, when Hatsue’s turn would come at three o’clock.… Yasuo swore to himself that he would have Hatsue before the fishing-boats put out the next morning."|"The Sound of Waves"|"Yukio Mishima"
"ap 01:20"|"twenty minutes past one"|"At twenty minutes past one Yasuo stole out of the house. In the dead of night the sound of the waves could be plainly heard, and the moon was shining brightly. The village was silent."|"The Sound of Waves"|"Yukio Mishima"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"Soon it was two o’clock and Yasuo caught sight of Hatsue coming across the schoolyard, carrying a water bucket on either end of a wooden pole across her shoulders. Her outline was sharply etched in the moonlight."|"The Sound of Waves"|"Yukio Mishima"
00:00|midnight|"Although a woman’s body is ill-suited for midnight labor, on Uta-jima men and women alike, rich and poor, had to perform their own tasks. Robust Hatsue, hardened by the life of a diving woman, came up the stone steps without the slightest difficulty, swinging the empty pails to and fro and giving rather the merry appearance of actually enjoying her untimely work."|"The Sound of Waves"|"Yukio Mishima"
12:00|noonday|"As a matter of fact, Jukichi was sincerely moved by the letter and, during the reading, he heaved many a big sigh and threw in many an interjection. When he was done he gave his opinion in the same powerful voice he used to give fishing orders, a voice that now boomed out over the quiet noonday sea to a radius of a hundred yards in all directions:"|"The Sound of Waves"|"Yukio Mishima"
12:00|noon|"The rain continued during the entire day’s fishing, but Shinji managed to read the letter during the noon rest by protecting it with his raincoat."|"The Sound of Waves"|"Yukio Mishima"
"ap ~ 11:00"|"about eleven o’clock"|"“… Tomorrow night, for a wonder, Father is having visitors. They’re some prefectural officials from Tsu and will spend the night. Whenever Father has guests he always drinks a lot and goes to bed early. So I think it’ll be safe for me to slip out of the house about eleven o’clock. Please wait for me in front of Yashiro Shrine.…”"|"The Sound of Waves"|"Yukio Mishima"
"ap < 09:00"|"two hours of eleven o’clock"|"Shinji had now learned well enough the pain of waiting. So he decided it would be better if he let the girl do the waiting this time. But he could not do it. As soon as his mother and Hiroshi were in bed, he went out. It still lacked two hours of eleven o’clock."|"The Sound of Waves"|"Yukio Mishima"
"ap > 10:30"|"past ten thirty"|"But, to tell the truth, as he sat on the stairs at the entrance to the office of Yashiro Shrine he had already heard the clock give the single stroke of the half-hour and so was doubly sure it was past ten thirty. The priest and his family were fast asleep. Now the boy pressed his ear to the night-shutters of the house and counted, at full length, the eleven strokes that sounded lonesomely from the wall clock inside."|"The Sound of Waves"|"Yukio Mishima"
12:00|noonday|"One day, before the onset of the rainy season, the beach lay under a strong, noonday sun that could no longer be called that of early summer. A drying-fire had been lit, and a southerly breeze was carrying its smoke in the direction of the ancient grave-mound of Prince Deki. Garden Beach embraced a small cove, directly beyond which there stretched the Pacific. Summer clouds were towering over the distant sea."|"The Sound of Waves"|"Yukio Mishima"
12:00|noonday|"It was the noonday rest period and the area around the fire was noisy with laughing banter. The sand was not yet so hot as to scorch the soles of the feet and, though cold, the water was no longer of that freezing temperature that made the divers rush to put on their padded garments and huddle around the fire the minute they emerged from the sea."|"The Sound of Waves"|"Yukio Mishima"
09:00|"nine in the morning"|"The ship was to sail at nine in the morning. Shinji was given the task of taking the anchor-light off the mast at the first crack of dawn the next morning. The anchor-light was very much like the night-shutters of a house ashore: turning it off meant that the ship was awake, just as opening the night-shutters means a house is awake."|"The Sound of Waves"|"Yukio Mishima"
18:00|"six o’clock in the evening"|"Checking its headway countless times and then moving ahead very slowly, the ship passed through the channel between the coral reefs. It was then six o’clock in the evening."|"The Sound of Waves"|"Yukio Mishima"
21:00|"nine o’clock that night"|"By nine o’clock that night the two ships were beset by a wind with a speed of fifty-six miles an hour."|"The Sound of Waves"|"Yukio Mishima"
"< 23:00"|"An hour before midnight"|"An hour before midnight Shinji and Yasuo and one of the young seamen took the watch. Their bodies were hurled against the wall as soon as they began crawling out onto the deck. The wind-whipped rain struck their cheeks as though it were needles."|"The Sound of Waves"|"Yukio Mishima"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"“I see. Well, then, let’s just use a lifeline. The typhoon passed its peak at one o’clock, so there’s no danger at all in using a lifeline now. Someone can just swim out to the buoy and tie the lifeline to it.”"|"The Sound of Waves"|"Yukio Mishima"
