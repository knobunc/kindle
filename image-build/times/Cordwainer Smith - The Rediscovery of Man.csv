She screamed badly at ten months. Something she got in her mouth. She screamed at ten when she thought the air had stopped in her drop-shaft. It hadn’t, or she wouldn’t be here. They’re in her record. I want the mouse to have those screams. And she had a pair of red shoes for her fourth birthday. Give me the full two minutes with her. I’ve printed the key on the complete series of Marcia and the Moon Men—that was the best box drama for teen-age girls that they ran last year. Veesey saw it. This time she’ll see it again, but the mouse will be tied in. She won’t have the chance of a snowball in hell of forgetting it.”"|"The Rediscovery of Man"|"Cordwainer Smith"

We all five felt that we had been befriended, looked at. We felt that we had been made the toys or the pets of some gigantic form of life immensely beyond the limits of human imagination, and that that life in looking at the four of us—the three doctors and Liana—had seen us and the colonel and had realized that the colonel needed to go back to his own kind.
Because it was five, not four, who stood up.
The colonel was trembling, but he was sane. He was alive. He was human again. He said very weakly:"|"The Rediscovery of Man"|"Cordwainer Smith"

Meiklejohn, now launched into some drunken story of ancient injustices which had been done to him on other worlds, paid no attention to them. In the middle of the night, past nine-fifty in the evening, Casher woke alone in his chair, very stiff and uncomfortable.
