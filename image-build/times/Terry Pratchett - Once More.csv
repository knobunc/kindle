Two chickens were on the end of it, with twigs in their beaks. ""They looked as if they was nest building,"" he now recalls. ""I went past again about 10 a.m. It was all smashed up in the gutter."""|"Once More"|"Terry Pratchett"

Anyway, I stopped because it was getting very heavy, I mean, it was the way they were acting. The way they looked at you. Their beady eyes.

The world has gone strange. You can't tell the reality from the fantasy anymore. Think I'm kidding? On the racks at the supermarket are ""newspapers"" like the Sun, the Midnight Star, the Weekly World News. Typical lead story: Elvis has been found alive in a UFO dredged from the Bermuda Triangle.

I was prepared to dislike the man but in fact we got on pretty well; he avoided the usual dumb questions and we had a decent 20 minutes. Sometimes it's a bit embarrassing to be interviewed by a journalist who's a fan because fan-type questions don't work well on air (they say things like ""So ... is Rincewind coming back, then?"" and you can hear a hundred thousand people looking at their radios and saying ""what the—is he on about?"")."|"Once More"|"Terry Pratchett"

It was there that I once heard an old man in a cider house refer to a fox as Reynard, quite unselfconsciously. There I wandered around the fields looking for the Wimblestone, which comes alive at night, and once I heard the ghost of the horse which used to be tethered outside the back door. Well, it was 3 a.m., there was the sound of a horse outside, I knew about the ghost, and I wasn't about to spoil a good story by checking. I am a journalist, after all."|"Once More"|"Terry Pratchett"
