It was moving at .47c relative to us, and thus we would have been coincident in space-time”—rammed!—“in a little more than nine hours.

No way to see, of course, but I could imagine the pale blue solution—ethylene glycol and something else—foaming up around and over us. The suit material, cool and dry, collapsed in to touch my skin at every point. I knew that my internal body pressure was increasing rapidly to match the increasing fluid pressure outside. That’s what the shot was for; keep your cells from getting squished between the devil and the deep blue sea. You could still feel it, though. By the time my meter said “2” (external pressure equivalent to a column of water two nautical miles deep), I felt that I was at the same time being crushed and bloated. By 20:05 it was at 2.7 and holding steady. When the maneuvers began at 20:10, you couldn’t feel the difference. I thought I saw the needle fluctuate a tiny bit, though."|"The Forever War"|"Joe Haldeman"
