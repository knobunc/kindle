00:00|Midnight|"All that evening I sat by my fire at the Warwick Arms, steeped
in a dream of the olden time, while the rain beat upon the windows,
and the wind roared about the eaves and corners. From time to time
I dipped into old Sir Thomas Malory's enchanting book, and fed at
its rich feast of prodigies and adventures, breathed in the
fragrance of its obsolete names, and dreamed again. Midnight being
come at length, I read another tale, for a nightcap—this which here
follows, to wit:"|"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"|"Mark Twain"

resources of a kingdom at his command.  Unsuspected by this
dark land, I had the civilization of the nineteenth century booming
under its very nose!  It was fenced away from the public view,
but there it was, a gigantic and unassailable fact—­and to be heard
from, yet, if I lived and had luck.  There it was, as sure a
fact and as substantial a fact as any serene volcano, standing
innocent with its smokeless summit in the blue sky and giving no
sign of the rising hell in its bowels.  My schools and
churches were children four years before; they were grown-up now;
my shops of that day were vast factories now; where I had a dozen
trained men then, I had a thousand now; where I had one brilliant
expert then, I had fifty now.  I stood with my hand on the
cock, so to speak, ready to turn it on and flood the midnight world
with light at any moment.  But I was not going to do the thing
in that sudden way.  It was not my policy.  The people
could not have stood it; and, moreover, I should have had the
Established Roman Catholic Church on my back in a minute."|"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"|"Mark Twain"

enough sound in a formerly American ear.  They were freemen,
but they could not leave the estates of their lord or their bishop
without his permission; they could not prepare their own bread, but
must have their corn ground and their bread baked at his mill and
his bakery, and pay roundly for the same; they could not sell a
piece of their own property without paying him a handsome
percentage of the proceeds, nor buy a piece of somebody else’s
without remembering him in cash for the privilege; they had to
harvest his grain for him gratis, and be ready to come at a
moment’s notice, leaving their own crop to destruction by the
threatened storm; they had to let him plant fruit trees in their
fields, and then keep their indignation to themselves when his
heedless fruit-gatherers trampled the grain around the trees; they
had to smother their anger when his hunting parties galloped
through their fields laying waste the result of their patient toil;
they were not allowed to keep doves themselves, and when the swarms
from my lord’s dovecote settled on their crops they must not lose
their temper and kill a bird, for awful would the penalty be; when
the harvest was at last gathered, then came the procession of
robbers to levy their blackmail upon it:  first the Church
carted off its fat tenth, then the king’s commissioner took his
twentieth, then my lord’s people made a mighty inroad upon the
remainder; after which, the skinned freeman had liberty to bestow
the remnant in his barn, in case it was worth the trouble; there
were taxes, and taxes, and taxes, and more taxes, and taxes again,
and yet other taxes—­upon this free and independent pauper, but
none upon his lord the baron or the bishop, none upon the wasteful
nobility or the all-devouring Church; if the baron would sleep
unvexed, the freeman must sit up all night after his day’s work and
whip the ponds to keep the frogs quiet; if the freeman’s
daughter—­but no, that last infamy of monarchical government is
unprintable; and finally, if the freeman, grown desperate with his
tortures, found his life unendurable under such conditions, and
sacrificed it and fled to death for mercy and refuge, the gentle
Church condemned him to eternal fire, the gentle law buried him at
midnight at the cross-roads with a stake through his back, and his
master the baron or the bishop confiscated all his property and
turned his widow and his orphans out of doors."|"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"|"Mark Twain"

RESTORATION OF THE FOUNTAIN

Saturday noon I went to the well and looked on a while. 
Merlin was still burning smoke-powders, and pawing the air, and
muttering gibberish as hard as ever, but looking pretty
down-hearted, for of course he had not started even a perspiration
in that well yet.  Finally I said:"|"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"|"Mark Twain"

pretty well fagged, for they had traveled double tides.  They
had pack-mules along, and had brought everything I needed—­tools,
pump, lead pipe, Greek fire, sheaves of big rockets,
roman candles, colored fire sprays, electric apparatus,
and a lot of sundries—­everything necessary for the stateliest kind
of a miracle.  They got their supper and a nap, and about
midnight we sallied out through a solitude so wholly vacant and
complete that it quite overpassed the required conditions.  We
took possession of the well and its surroundings.  My boys
were experts in all sorts of things, from the stoning up of a well
to the constructing of a mathematical instrument.  An hour
before sunrise we had that leak mended in ship-shape fashion, and
the water began to rise.  Then we stowed our fireworks in the
chapel, locked up the place, and went home to bed."|"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"|"Mark Twain"

out by my works near the capital; we bored into a stone reservoir

to receive him in state; a strange thing, truly.  Only one
thing could explain this:  that other magician had been

of mine, a monk, about it, and he said, yes, the magician had tried
some further enchantments and found out that the court had
concluded to make no journey at all, but stay at home.  Think
of that!  Observe how much a reputation was worth in such a
country.  These people had seen me do the very showiest bit of
magic in history, and the only one within their memory that had a

helpless with rage and humiliation when I brought him out on a
balcony and showed him the head of the state marching in and never
a monk on hand to offer him welcome, and no stir of life or clang
of joy-bell to glad his spirit.  He took one look and then
flew to rouse out his forces.  The next minute the bells were
dinning furiously, and the various buildings were vomiting monks

SIR LAUNCELOT AND KNIGHTS TO THE RESCUE

Nearing four in the afternoon.  The scene was just outside
the walls of London.  A cool, comfortable, superb day, with a
brilliant sun; the kind of day to make one want to live, not
die.  The multitude was prodigious and far-reaching; and yet
we fifteen poor devils hadn’t a friend in it.  There was
something painful in that thought, look at it how you might. 
There we sat, on our tall scaffold, the butt of the hate and
mockery of all those enemies.  We were being made a holiday
spectacle.  They had built a sort of grand stand for the
nobility and gentry, and these were there in full force, with their
ladies.  We recognized a good many of them."|"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"|"Mark Twain"

singe him for the weariness he worketh with his one tale!  But
that men fear him for that he hath the storms and the lightnings
and all the devils that be in hell at his beck and call, they would
have dug his entrails out these many years ago to get at that tale
and squelch it.  He telleth it always in the third person,
making believe he is too modest to glorify
himself—­malédictions light upon him, misfortune be his
dole!  Good friend, prithee call me for evensong.”"|"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"|"Mark Twain"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"Vast as the show-grounds were, there were no
vacant spaces in them outside of the lists, at ten o’clock on the
morning of the 16th.  The mammoth grand-stand was clothed in
flags, streamers, and rich tapestries, and packed with several
acres of small-fry tributary kings, their suites, and the British
aristocracy; with our own royal gang in the chief place, and each
and every individual a flashing prism of gaudy silks and
velvets—­well, I never saw anything to begin with it but a fight
between an Upper Mississippi sunset and the aurora
borealis.  The huge camp of beflagged and gay-colored
tents at one end of the lists, with a stiff-standing sentinel at
every door and a shining shield hanging by him for challenge, was
another fine sight.  You see, every knight was there who had
any ambition or any caste feeling; for my feeling toward their
order was not much of a secret, and so here was their chance. 
If I won my fight with Sir Sagramor, others would have the right to
call me out as long as I might be willing to respond."|"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"|"Mark Twain"

midnight"|"“I think so.  I placed four of my boys
there as a guard—­inside, and out of sight.  Nobody was to be
hurt—­while outside; but any attempt to enter—­well, we said just
let anybody try it!  Then I went out into the hills and
uncovered and cut the secret wires which connected your bedroom
with the wires that go to the dynamite deposits under all our vast
factories, mills, workshops, magazines, etc., and about
midnight I and my boys turned out and connected that wire with the
cave, and nobody but you and I suspects where the other end of it
goes to.  We laid it under ground, of course, and it was all
finished in a couple of hours or so.  We sha’n’t have to leave
our fortress now when we want to blow up our civilization.”"|"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"|"Mark Twain"

it the end.  About midnight I awoke, and saw that hag making
curious passes in the air about The Boss’s head and face, and
wondered what it meant.  Everybody but the dynamo-watch lay
steeped in sleep; there was no sound.  The woman ceased from
her mysterious foolery, and started tip-toeing toward the
door.  I called out:"|"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"|"Mark Twain"
12:00|noon|"Now Sir Kay arose and began to fire up on his
history-mill with me for fuel.  It was time for me to feel
serious, and I did.  Sir Kay told how he had encountered me in
a far land of barbarians, who all wore the same ridiculous garb
that I did—­a garb that was a work of enchantment, and intended to
make the wearer secure from hurt by human hands.  However he
had nullified the force of the enchantment by prayer, and had
killed my thirteen knights in a three hours’ battle, and taken me
prisoner, sparing my life in order that so strange a curiosity as I
was might be exhibited to the wonder and admiration of the king and
the court.  He spoke of me all the time, in the blandest way,
as “this prodigious giant,” and “this horrible sky-towering
monster,” and “this tusked and taloned man-devouring ogre”, and
everybody took in all this bosh in the naivest way, and never
smiled or seemed to notice that there was any discrepancy between
these watered statistics and me.  He said that in trying to
escape from him I sprang into the top of a tree two hundred cubits
high at a single bound, but he dislodged me with a stone the size
of a cow, which “all-to brast” the most of my bones, and then swore
me to appear at Arthur’s court for sentence.  He ended by
condemning me to die at noon on the 21st; and was so little
concerned about it that he stopped to yawn before he named the
date."|"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"|"Mark Twain"

began, and rose by dramatically graded stages to my colossal
climax, which I delivered in as sublime and noble a way as ever I
did such a thing in my life:  “Go back and tell the king that
at that hour I will smother the whole world in the dead blackness
of midnight; I will blot out the sun, and he shall never shine

there was an awful crash and that old tower leaped into the sky in
chunks, along with a vast volcanic fountain of fire that turned
night to noonday, and showed a thousand acres of human beings

consternation.  Well, it rained mortar and masonry the rest of
the week.  This was the report; but probably the facts would
have modified it."|"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"|"Mark Twain"
