21:00|"9 PM"|"In July of ’42 we got our first black lieutenants. There were only three of them but we all walked with our heads a little bit higher after that, at least on the base. Off base, in the towns where we took our liberty, we walked real careful. In Killeen they put up a big sign for us at the end of Main Street: NIGGERS HAVE TO LEAVE THIS TOWN BY 9 PM. The paint was blood red in case we missed the point. Killeen didn’t have a colored section, only about half of them little towns did. The one in Alexandria near Camp Claiborne was typical—nothing to it but a falling-down movie theater and two shabby juke joints. Wasn’t no place to buy anything or set and eat a meal. The rest of the town was off limits to us. If the MPs or the local law caught you in the white part of town they’d beat the shit out of you."|Mudbound|"Hillary Jordan"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"It was eight o’clock by the time we finished supper, and the children were nodding into their bowls. When Alice offered to let us stay the night, I accepted quickly; it was a two-hour drive to Eboline’s in Greenville, and I wasn’t about to chance our flimsy wartime tires on those pothole-filled roads in the dark. Henry and Orris both looked like they wanted to object, but neither of them did. The three men went outside to cover the furniture in the truck against the dew, while Alice cleaned up and I put the girls to bed. After I got them tucked in, I helped her make up the bed Henry and I would share."|Mudbound|"Hillary Jordan"
12:00|noon|"This is not to say that I thought of Florence and her family as equal to me and mine. I called her Florence and she called me Miz McAllan. She and Lilly May didn’t use our outhouse, but did their business in the bushes out back. And when we sat down to the noon meal, the two of them ate outside on the porch."|Mudbound|"Hillary Jordan"
"ap 06:00"|6:00|"One Saturday at the end of April, the five of us went into town to do errands and have dinner at Dex’s Diner, famed for its fried catfish and the sign outside that read:
JESUS LOVES YOU
MONDAY - FRIDAY 6:00-2:00
SATURDAYS 6:00-8:00
After we ate we stopped at Tricklebank’s to get the week’s provisions. Henry and Pappy lingered on the front porch with Orris Stokes and some other men, and the girls and I went inside to visit with the ladies. While I chatted with Rose, Amanda Leigh and Isabelle ran off to play with her two girls. Alice Stokes was there, radiantly pregnant, buying a length of poplin for a maternity dress. Wretched as I was, I couldn’t bring myself to begrudge her happiness. We’d been chatting for a few minutes when a Negro soldier came in the back door. He was a tall young man with skin the color of strong tea. There were sergeant’s stripes on his sleeves and a great many medals on his chest. He had a duffel bag slung over one broad shoulder."|Mudbound|"Hillary Jordan"

12:00|noon|"Jamie McAllan wasn’t evil, not like his pappy was, but he did the Dark Man’s business just the same. He was a weak vessel. Whiskey on his breath at noon and womansmell all over his clothes every Monday. Now a man can like his nature activity and even his drink and still be the Lord’s, but Jamie McAllan had a hole in his soul, the kind the devil loves to find. It’s like a open doorway for him, lets him enter in and do his wicked work. I thought maybe he got it in the war and it would close on up in time but it just kept on getting bigger and bigger. None of em seen it but me. Jamie McAllan geehawsed em all, specially Miz McAllan. The way she looked at him you would a thought he was her husband and not his brother. But Henry McAllan didn’t seem to mind, that’s if he even noticed. Tell you one thing, if my sister ever stretched her eyes at Hap like that, I’d claw em right out."|Mudbound|"Hillary Jordan"

May be you are surprised to hearing from me. At first I am thinking I am not writing to you but then I have decided that I must do it, because it is not right that a Mann does not know he is having a Son. That is what I want to say you—you have a Son. I name him after my Father und his Father, Franz Ronsel. He is born in the Nacht of the 14 November at 22:00, in the Hospital of Teisendorf. I ask myself what you is doing at that Moment. I am trying to imagine you in your flat Missippi but I can not make such a Picture in my Mind, only of your Face which I see everyday when I look at the little Franz. I am sending you a Foto so that you can see him. He have your Eyes und your Smile."|Mudbound|"Hillary Jordan"

Our house isn’t as nice as the one we lost to the Stokeses in Marietta, and there’s no fig tree in the backyard, but we do have electricity, running water, and an indoor toilet, for which I’m profoundly grateful. Our days here have settled into a pleasant routine. We get up at dawn. I make breakfast for us all, and Henry’s lunch to take with him to the farm. After he leaves I get the girls dressed and we walk Amanda Leigh the eight blocks to school. By the time Bella and I return home our colored maid Viola is here. She only comes half days; there’s not enough work to warrant having her full-time. I spend the morning reading to Bella or running errands. At three we go and fetch Amanda Leigh, and then I cook our supper. We eat half an hour after sunset, when Henry gets home. Then I knit or sew while we listen to the radio."|Mudbound|"Hillary Jordan"
