"ap 06:30"|"half-past six"|"Lyra lived at St. Sophia’s in term time, but her room in the back quad at Jordan was always there when she wanted to use it. The clock was striking half-past six as she hurried there with her living burden—who was much lighter than her own dæmon, as she intended to tell Pantalaimon later."|"Lyra's Oxford"|"Philip Pullman"
"ap 08:30"|"half-past eight"|"“You can see the clock over the hall from here. At half-past eight I shall be in the street outside the tower where you found us. Fly down and meet us there, and we’ll take you to Mr. Makepeace.”"|"Lyra's Oxford"|"Philip Pullman"
"ap 08:30"|"half-past eight"|"At half-past eight she and Pan moved out of the shadow of the Radcliffe Camera’s great dome and slipped into the narrow alley, overhung with chestnut trees, that separated Jordan College from Brasenose. It wasn’t hard to get out of St. Sophia’s School, but those girls who did were severely punished, and Lyra had no wish to get caught. But she was wearing dark clothes and she could run fast, and she and Pan, with their witchlike power of separation, had managed to mislead pursuers before now."|"Lyra's Oxford"|"Philip Pullman"
