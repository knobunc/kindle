The mother gasped and shielded her eyes, but the child stared into the flames, where a dark, brooding, masculine form took shape. With a laugh, the figure strode forward, to regard them. Then he stooped, snatched the gravedigger’s cloak away from the woman and cast it back over his shoulder, where it burst into flames. Then he threw an ermine robe atop her and the child."|"Last Exit to Babylon"|"Roger Zelazny"

There was a lot of adobe around me and what looked like a small park off to my left. There was a cathedral off to the right. I could investigate them later.

  § Amber

  Amber has occupied a big piece of my writing time over the years—ten books of it—and I want to say things about it here that will not give away the plot to those who are about to visit there for the first time. So I have to talk about the books without talking about what happens in the books. Okay. A challenge… One day I found myself walking in a part of Baltimore I had never visited before. Precisely where it was, or why I was there, I no longer recall. It was a sunny autumn day, though, a bit brisk, and I was passing down a narrow street lined with shops. I came to a corner and turned right. Immediately, I found myself on a totally different sort of street—residential, tree-lined, rather quaint. I had not anticipated the sudden shift and was somewhat surprised by the contrast. I passed along the street, however, and turned left at the next corner. With almost perfect timing, the sun was covered by a cloud as I turned, showing me a dark, alleylike street with a 19th-century feeling to it. Another turn, and there were open lots, houses set farther back from the road; and the sun came out again. It felt as if I were in the country rather than the city. I forget where I went after that, what I did, or how I got back. But the succession of contrasting prospects was already producing an effect in that place in my mind where stories occur. What form it would take, I had no idea at the time. It did not occur to me till later, when I was writing them, that this was a piece with the shadow walk and the hellride, two of the Amberites’ means of passing through realities."|"Last Exit to Babylon"|"Roger Zelazny"
"ap 10:11"|10-11|"Nine Princes in Amber continued to resurface as a potential motion picture. Zelazny told an interviewer that someone who used to work for 20th Century Fox had announced at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival a forthcoming Amber movie, encompassing the first two books. This unnamed company did not want Zelazny to write the screenplay.[1] In 1998 and 1999, Warner Bros. announced Nine Princes in Amber to be written by Ed Neumeier (Robocop, Starship Troopers) and co-produced by Akiva Goldsman (Batman Forever) and Mark Canton.[8-9] However, neither project ever materialized. Warner Bros. continues to hold rights to the title Nine Princes in Amber, and its domain names (www.nineprincesinamber.com or www.9princesinamber.com) redirect to the Warner Bros.’ website. The Sci Fi (now Syfy) Channel announced in 2002 a 4-hour Amber mini-series written by Richard Christian Matheson (and SciFiWeekly later published an interview with him about it),[10-11] but that miniseries has not emerged. Trent Zelazny confirmed that various Zelazny works remain under option for motion picture or television development, but details must remain confidential while negotiations continue.[12]"|"Last Exit to Babylon"|"Roger Zelazny"

The publisher asked Robert Silverberg to assemble a “best of” collection of Zelazny stories and to write an introduction. In 2002 The Last Defender of Camelot, Zelazny’s sixth collection, came out, unfortunately bearing the same title as an earlier publication which had completely different stories. Only one story in the new book (“Come Back to the Killing Ground, Alice, My Love”) was not previously collected. New editions of This Immortal, Damnation Alley, The Dream Master, Changeling, and Madwand were released, as were odd two-in-one pairings: Eye of Cat with Isle of the Dead, and To Die in Italbar with A Dark Travelling. ibooks commissioned John Betancourt to write the Amber prequel novels described earlier in this monograph, and four of five appeared between 2002 and 2005 before the publisher’s bankruptcy."|"Last Exit to Babylon"|"Roger Zelazny"
