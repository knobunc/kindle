"< 12:00"|"before midday"|"Yasmeen hadn’t had any reason to fly her airship into the small Danish township of Fladstrand before, but her reputation had obviously preceded her. All along the Scandinavian coast, rum dives served as a town’s only line of defense against mercenaries and pirates—and as soon as the sky paled and Lady Corsair became visible on the eastern horizon, lights began appearing in the windows of the public houses alongside the docks. The taverns were opening early, hoping to make a few extra deniers before midday . . . and the good citizens of Fladstrand were probably praying that her crew wouldn’t venture beyond the docks and into the town itself."|"Heart of Steel"|"Meljean Brook"

00:00|Midnight|"Midnight had come and gone when Yasmeen decided she’d heard enough. She emerged from the dim tavern into the dark and paused to light a cigarillo, studying the boardwalk along the docks. It was just as busy at night as during the day, but the crowd was comprised of more drunks. Some slumped against the buildings or slept beside crates. Groups of sailors laughed and pounded their chests at the aviators—some of them women, Yasmeen noted, and not one of them alone. The shopgirls and lamplighters walked in pairs, and most of the whores did, too."|"Heart of Steel"|"Meljean Brook"
00:00|midnight|"Ah, her midnight excursion. When they’d been sailing out of London, she’d bet the quartermaster that she could slip away from Vesuvius without being noticed. Last night, she hadn’t even tried to be furtive; she’d asked Tenner to help her lower a dinghy to the water."|"Heart of Steel"|"Meljean Brook"
12:00|noon|"“Excellent. We’ve secured the airship Ceres. If God wills it, she leaves tomorrow at noon.”"|"Heart of Steel"|"Meljean Brook"
12:00|midday|"“It is very good to meet you, Captain. I hope you will come  speak with me later, after you’ve settled—and I have had my midday rest. I am but a frail old man.”"|"Heart of Steel"|"Meljean Brook"
12:00|midday|"“Good. We’ll be in Vienna tomorrow morning; you can start your work then, God willing.” With effort, the older man stood, his heavy breath resonating deeply in his chest. “Forgive me. I’d hoped to have more opportunity to sit with you before I joined the captain for dinner, but the business with the reward has cut into that time. Perhaps tomorrow, you will take the midday meal here with me.”"|"Heart of Steel"|"Meljean Brook"
12:00|midday|"The older man sighed again, and Archimedes met Yasmeen’s eyes. She nodded. Yes, they had almost stayed too long—and Hassan was likely looking forward to his midday rest. She’d discovered almost everything she wished to know, anyway."|"Heart of Steel"|"Meljean Brook"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"He could have easily spent weeks here, but he settled on two days. They remained out until after midnight the first day, and almost immediately dropped into sleep on return to Ceres. He woke to the cracking of Yasmeen’s knees. As soon as she loosened up, they scouted a new building from the airship and went down again, lowering the rope ladder to the roof. After a cursory search, they climbed back up, scouted another building, then a castle overlooking the harbor. A number of zombies milled around in the courtyard, so many that it took Archimedes a few moments to recognize what they were milling around. His heart thumped against his chest, and his head swam."|"Heart of Steel"|"Meljean Brook"
"< 00:00"|"just before midnight"|"He glanced at the clock. A few more hours. They’d move into range just before midnight. Christ, he felt so maudlin, as if he were waiting to die. He should be sensible, instead."|"Heart of Steel"|"Meljean Brook"
