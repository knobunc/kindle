"> 14:00"|"a little after two o’clock in the afternoon"|"It was a cold gray day in late November. The weather had changed overnight, when a backing wind brought a granite sky and a mizzling rain with it, and although it was now only a little after two o’clock in the afternoon the pallor of a winter evening seemed to have closed upon the hills, cloaking them in mist. It would be dark by four. The air was clammy cold, and for all the tightly closed windows it penetrated the interior of the coach. The leather seats felt damp to the hands, and there must have been a small crack in the roof, because now and again little drips of rain fell softly through, smudging the leather and leaving a dark-blue stain like a splodge of ink. The wind came in gusts, at time shaking the coach as it traveled round the bend of the road, and in the exposed places on the high ground it blew with such force that the whole body of the coach trembled and swayed, rocking between the high wheels like a drunken man."|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
00:00|midnight|"Mary lost count of time and space; the miles might have been a hundred and the hour midnight, for ail she knew. She began to cling to the safety of the coach; at least it had some remnant of familiarity. She had known it since the early morning, and that was long ago. However great a nightmare was this eternal drive, there were at least the four close walls to protect her, the shabby leaking roof, and, within calling distance, the comfortable presence of the driver. At last it seemed to her that he was driving his horses to an even greater speed; she heard him shout to them, the cry of his voice blown past her window on the wind."|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap > 08:00"|"past eight o’clock"|"Mary woke to a high wind from the west, and a thin watery sun. It was the rattling of the window that roused her from her sleep, and she judged from the broad daylight and the color of the sky that she had slept late, and that it must be past eight o’clock. Looking out of the window and across the yard, she saw that the stable door was open, and there were fresh hoof-marks in the mud outside. With a great sense of relief she realized that the landlord must have gone from home, and she would have Aunt Patience to herself, if only for a little time."|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
12:00|"high noon"|"The house and outbuildings formed three sides of the little square that was the yard, in the center of which was a grass bank and a drinking-trough. Beyond this lay the road, a thin white ribbon that stretched on either hand to the horizon, surrounded on each side by moorland, brown and sodden from the heavy rains. Mary went out onto the road and looked about her, and as far as her eyes could see there was nothing but the black hills and the moors. The gray slate inn, with its tall chimneys, forbidding and uninhabited though it seemed, was the only dwelling-place on the landscape. To the west of Jamaica high tors reared their heads; some were smooth like downland, and the grass shone yellow under the fitful winter sun; but others were sinister and austere, their peaks crowned with granite and great slabs of stone. Now and again the sun was obscured by cloud, and long shadows fled over the moors like fingers. Color came in patches; sometimes the hills were purple, ink-stained, and mottled, and then a feeble ray of sun would come from a wisp of cloud, and one hill would be golden-brown while his neighbor still languished in the dark. The scene was never once the same, for it would be the glory of high noon to the east, with the moor as motionless as desert sand; and away to the westward arctic winter fell upon the hills, brought by a jagged cloud shaped like a highwayman’s cloak, that scattered hail and snow and a sharp spittle rain onto the granite tors. The air was strong and sweet-smelling, cold as mountain air, and strangely pure. It was a revelation to Mary, accustomed as she was to the warm and soft climate of Helford, with its high hedges and tall protecting trees. Even the east wind had been no hardship there, for the arm of the headland acted as a defense to those on land, and it was only the river that ran turbulent and green, the wave-crests whipped with foam."|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
12:00|midday|"Her presence was not required in the bar, for no one came to it when the landlord was from home, and, after giving her aunt a hand with the housework and in the kitchen, she was free to wander where she pleased. Patience Merlyn was no walker; she had no wish to stir beyond the chicken-run at the back of the inn, and she had no sense of direction. She had a vague idea of the names of the tors, for she had heard them mentioned by her husband, but where they were, and how anyone found them, she did not know. So Mary would strike off on her own at midday, with nothing but the sun to guide her and a certain deep-grained common sense which was her natural inheritance as a countrywoman."|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 01:00"|one|"They were a strange assortment gathered there, grouped around Joss Merlyn in the bar. Securely separated by the counter itself, and half screened by a barrier of bottles and glasses, Mary could look down upon the company and remain unobserved. They straddled the stools and sprawled upon the benches; they leaned against the wall; they slouched beside the tables; and one or two, whose heads or stomachs were weaker than the rest, already lay full length upon the floor. They were dirty for the most part, ragged, ill-kept, with matted hair and broken nails; tramps, vagrants, poachers, thieves, cattle-stealers, and gypsies. There was a farmer who had lost his farm through bad management and dishonesty; a shepherd who had fired his master’s rick; a horse-dealer who had been hounded out of Devon. One fellow was a cobbler in Launceston, and under cover of his trade passed stolen goods; he who lay in a drunken stupor on the floor was once mate of a Padstow schooner, and had run his ship ashore. The little man who sat in the far corner, biting his nails, was a Port Isaac fisherman, and rumor had it that he kept a store of gold rolled up in a stocking and hidden in the chimney of his cottage—but where the gold came from no one would say. There were men who lived nearby, under the very shadow of the tors, who had known no other country but moorland, marsh and granite; one had come walking without a lantern from the Crowdy Marsh beyond Roughtor, taking Brown Willy in his stride; another came from Cheesewring, and sat now with his face in a mug of ale, his boots on a table, side by side with the poor half-witted fellow who had stumbled up the lane from Dozmary. This last had a birthmark that ran the whole length of his face, blazing it purple, and he kept plucking at it with his hands, and pulling out his cheek, so that Mary, who stood in line with him, for all the bottles that divided them, turned sick and nearly faint at the sight of him; and what with the stale drink smell, and the reek of tobacco, and the foul atmosphere of crowded unwashed bodies, she felt a physical disgust rise up in her, and she knew she would give way to it if she stayed there long. Luckily she did not have to move among them; her duty was to stand behind the bar, hidden as much as possible, and then do what washing and cleaning of glasses was required, refilling them from tap or bottle, while Joss Merlyn himself handed them to his customers, or lifted the flap of the bar and strode out into the room, laughing at one, flinging a coarse word at another, patting someone on the shoulder, jerking his head at another. After the first hilarious outburst, the first curious stare, the shrug of the shoulder and the chuckle, the company gathered in the inn ignored Mary. They accepted her as niece of the landlord, a sort of serving-maid of Merlyn’s wife, as she was introduced, and, though one or two of the younger men would have spoken to her and plagued her, they were wary of the eye of the landlord himself, fearing that any familiarity on their part might anger him, as he had probably brought her to Jamaica for his own amusement. So Mary was left undisturbed, greatly to her relief, though had she known the reason for their reticence she would have walked out of the bar that night in shame and loathing."|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
00:00|midnight|"He wiped the sweat from his forehead with his shirtsleeve and stared down at her. She was surprised to see that, although he had been drinking during the evening, he was himself sober, and even if he was the ringleader of this riotous, crazy company, he knew what he was doing. “Had enough of it, have you?” he said. “Think yourself a little bit too good for such as we? I’ll tell you this, Mary. You’ve had an easy time behind the bar, and you ought to go down on your knees and thank me for it. Because you’re my niece they’ve let you alone, my dear, but if you hadn’t had that honor—by God, there wouldn’t be much left of you now!” He shouted with laughter, and pinched her cheek between his finger and thumb, hurting her. “Get out, then,” he said; “it’s close on midnight anyway, and I don’t want you. You’ll lock your door tonight, Mary, and pull down your blind. Your aunt’s been in bed an hour with the blanket drawn over her head.”"|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"There was no other sound except the husky wheezing of the clock in the hall and the sudden whirring note preparatory to the strike. It rang the hour—three o’clock—and then ticked on, choking and gasping like a dying man who cannot catch his breath."|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
09:00|"nine in the morning"|"“Shut your mouth, Harry, and do as you’re told,” answered the landlord. “Stand where you are by the door and prick him with your knife if he tries to pass you. Now, look here, Mr. lawyer-clerk, or whatever you are in Truro town, you’ve made a fool of yourself tonight, but you’re not going to make a fool of me. You’d like to walk out of that door, wouldn’t you, and get on your horse, and be away to Bodmin? Yes, and by nine in the morning you’d have every magistrate in the country at Jamaica Inn, and a regiment of soldiers into the bargain. That’s your fine idea, isn’t it?”"|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
00:00|midnight|"She must have stood for ten minutes or more waiting for some sound or signal, but everything was still. Only the clock in the hall ticked on, wheezing slowly and impervious to action, a symbol of age and indifference. Once she fancied she heard a cry; but it was gone and lost in an instant, and was so faint and far a thing that it might have been some strange conjuring of her imagination, whipped as it was by all she had seen since midnight."|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
12:00|midday|"No sign remained of the evening’s work; the bar had been swept and tidied, the furniture replaced and the broken glass taken away, and there was no rope hanging from the beam. The landlord himself spent the morning in the stable and the cow-house, pitchforking filth into the yard, and doing the work that a cowman should have done had he kept one; and when he came into the kitchen at midday, to wolf an enormous meal, he questioned Mary about the farm stock at Helford, and asked for her opinion on a calf that had fallen sick, nor did he make any reference to the events of the preceding night. He seemed in fair good humor, and went so far as to forget to curse his wife, who hovered around him as usual, watching the expression in his eye like a dog who would please his master. Joss Merlyn behaved like a perfectly sober normal man, and it was impossible to believe that he had murdered a fellow-being only a few hours before."|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 02:00"|two|"That night the wagons came again. Mary woke to the sound of the hall clock striking two, and almost at once she was aware of footsteps beneath the porch, and she heard a voice speak soft and low. She crept out of bed and went over to the window. Yes, there they were; only two carts this time, with one horse in harness, and less than half a dozen men standing in the yard."|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
12:00|noon|"She felt well in being, and she sang as she worked. Her uncle had ridden away on the moors somewhere, and a sense of freedom possessed her whenever he was gone. At the back here she was sheltered somewhat from the wind, the broad sturdy house acting as a screen, and as she wrung out her linen and spread it on the stunted gorse-bush, she saw that the full force of the sun fell upon it, and it would be dry by noon."|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"< 12:00"|"just before noon"|"Joss Merlyn returned just before noon. Mary heard him step into the kitchen from the front of the house, and he was met at once with a babble of words from his wife. Mary stayed where she was by the wash-tub; she was determined to let Aunt Patience explain things in her own way, and, if he called to her for confirmation, there was time enough to go indoors."|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 01:30"|"half past one"|"Her idea was to keep Joss Merlyn in view, remaining of course unseen, and in this way perhaps she would learn something of his secret mission. She had no doubt that the squire’s visit to Jamaica had altered the landlord’s plans, and that this sudden departure on foot across the heart of the West Moor was connected with it. It was not yet half past one, and an ideal afternoon for walking. Mary, with her stout shoes and short skirt to her ankles, cared little for the rough ground. It was dry enough underfoot—the frost had hardened the surface—and, accustomed as she was to the wet shingle of the Helford shore and the thick mud of the farmyard, this scramble over the moor seemed easy enough. Her earlier rambles had taught her some wisdom, and she kept to the high ground as much as possible, following as best she could the tracks taken by her uncle."|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
00:00|midnight|"Mary smiled at her fancy, and spread her hands once more to the log fire. The silence was pleasing to her; it soothed her weariness and took away her fear. This was a different world from Jamaica Inn. There the silence was oppressive and heavy with malice; the disused rooms stank of neglect. Here it was different. The room in which she was sitting had the quiet impersonality of a drawing-room visited by night. The furniture, the table in the center, the pictures on the walls, were without that look of solid familiarity belonging to the day. They were like sleeping things, stumbled upon at midnight by surprise. People had lived here once—happy, placid people; old rectors with musty books beneath their arms; and there by the window a gray-haired woman in a blue gown had stooped to thread her needle. That was all very long ago. They slept now in the churchyard beyond the gate, their names indecipherable on the lichened stone. Since they had gone the house had withdrawn into itself and become silent, and the man who lived there now had suffered the personality of those who had gone before to remain unchanged."|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 04:00"|four|"It was a novelty to be waited upon, but he did it so quietly and made such little show that it seemed a natural, everyday occurrence, and Mary was without embarrassment. “Hannah lives in the village,” he said; “she leaves every afternoon at four. I prefer to be by myself. I like getting my own supper, and then I can choose my own time. Luckily she made apple-tart today. I hope you can eat it; her pastry is only moderate.”"|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"~ 17:00"|"About five in the evening"|"Joss Merlyn was drunk for five days. He was insensible most of the time, and lay stretched out on a bed in the kitchen that Mary and her aunt had improvised between them. He slept with his mouth wide open, and the sound of his breathing could be heard from the bedrooms above. About five in the evening he would wake for half an hour or so, shouting for brandy and sobbing like a child. His wife went to him at once, and soothed him and settled his pillow. She gave him a little weak brandy-and-water, talking to him gently as she would to a sick child, holding the glass to his lips; and he stared around him with glaring bloodshot eyes, muttering to himself, and shivering like a dog."|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
18:00|"six in the evening"|"Aunt Patience became another woman, showing a calm coolness and a presence of mind that Mary had not believed her capable of possessing. She gave herself up entirely to this nursing of her husband. She was obliged to do everything for him, and Mary watched her change his blankets and his linen with a sick feeling of disgust in her own heart, for she could not have borne to go near him. Aunt Patience took it as a matter of course, and the oaths and screams with which he greeted her did not appear to frighten her. These were the only times when she had the controlling of him, and he would let her sponge his forehead with a towel and hot water without a protest. Then she would tuck the fresh blanket under him, and smooth his mat of hair, and in a few minutes he would be asleep again, his face purple and his mouth wide open, with his tongue protruding, snoring like a bull. It was impossible to live in the kitchen, and Mary and her aunt turned the little disused parlor into a dwelling-room for themselves. For the first time Aunt Patience became something of a companion. She chatted happily of the old days in Helford, when she and Mary’s mother had been girls together; she moved swiftly and lightly about the house, and sometimes Mary would hear her humming snatches of old hymns as she passed backwards and forwards to the kitchen. It seemed that every two months or so Joss Merlyn would have these bouts of drinking. The times used to be further apart, but now they were becoming more frequent, and Aunt Patience was never quite certain when they would occur. This present one had been caused by the visit of Squire Bassat to the inn—the landlord had been very angry and upset, she told Mary—and when he came back from the moors at six in the evening he went straight to the bar. She knew then what would happen."|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"The weather was cold and gray, and did not tempt Mary from the house, but on the fifth morning the wind dropped and the sun shone, and, in spite of the adventure that had befallen her only a few days before, Mary decided to brave the moors again. The landlord was awake at nine, and began to shout at the top of his voice, and what with the noise he made, and the smell from the kitchen that now pervaded the rest of the house, and the sight of Aunt Patience bustling downstairs with clean blankets over her arm, Mary was seized with a rush of disgust and a loathing for the whole business."|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap > 04:00"|"after four"|"“Why are you going?” he said. “It’s early yet; it won’t be dark till after four. I’ll walk back with you then as far as Rushyford Gate. What’s the matter with you?” He took her chin in his hands and looked into her face. “I believe you’re frightened of me,” he said. “You think I’ve got barrels of brandy and rolls of tobacco in the little old bedrooms up above, and that I’m going to show them to you, and then cut your throat. That’s it, isn’t it? We’re a desperate lot of fellows, we Merlyns, and Jem is the worst of the pack. Is that what you’re thinking?”"|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
00:00|midnight|"“Only selling Mr. Bassat’s black pony for him, my dear. You’d be best away from Jamaica Inn that day, if I know anything about my brother. He’ll be just recovering from his brandy-bed by then and looking for trouble. If they’re used to you gallivanting over the moors they’ll not say anything at your absence. I’ll bring you home by midnight. Say you’re coming, Mary.”"|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"“We’ll let the other folk make the pace and get there in the forenoon, and the streets will be thick enough for us by two o’clock. You can leave Jamaica at eleven, if you like.”"|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"

"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"Outside in the hall the clock struck six o’clock with a sudden whirring note. Mary held her breath as she counted the strokes. They broke upon the silence with deliberation; it seemed an eternity before the last note fell, and echoed through the house and died away. The slow ticking of the clock continued. There was no sound from the parlor, and Mary breathed again. Aunt Patience sat at the table, threading a needle and cotton by candlelight. Her lips were pursed and her forehead puckered to a frown as she bent to her task."|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"Outside in the passage the clock struck one o’clock, and the single note rang in the air like a summons. Neither of them moved. The room was very cold, for the fire had sunk away to nothing and a little current of air blew in from the open door. The yellow flame of the candle bowed and flickered. He reached out to her and took her hand; it lay limp in his, like a dead hand. Perhaps he saw something of the frozen horror in her face, for he let her go, and turned away his eyes. He stared straight before him at the empty glass, and he began to drum with his fingers on the table. Crouched on the ground beside him, Mary watched a fly crawl across his hand. She watched it pass through the short black hairs, and over the thick veins to the knuckles, and it ran to the tips of the long slim fingers. She remembered the swift and sudden grace of those fingers when they cut bread for her that first evening, and how if they chose they could be delicate and light; she watched them drumming now on the table, and in her fancy she saw them curl round a block of jagged stone, and fasten upon it; she saw the stone fly through the air…"|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 01:00"|one|"Once more he turned to her, his whisper hoarse, and he jerked his head towards the ticking of the clock. “The sound of it rings in my head sometimes,” he said, “and when it struck one just now, it was like the tolling of a bell-buoy in a bay. I’ve heard it come traveling down the air on the westerly wind: one-two-one-two, backwards and forwards the clapper goes against the bell, as though it tolled for dead men. I’ve heard it in my dreams. I heard it tonight. A mournful, weary sound, Mary, is a bell-buoy out in the bay. It rubs on your nerves and you want to scream. When you work on the coast you have to pull out to them in a boat and muffle them; wrap the tongue in flannel. That deadens them. There’s silence then. Maybe it’s a misty night, with patches of white fog on the water, and outside the bay there’ll be a ship casting for scent like a hound. She listens for the buoy, and no sound comes to her. And she comes in then, driving through the fog—she comes straight in to us who are waiting for her, Mary—and we see her shudder suddenly, and strike, and then the surf has her.”"|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
21:30|"half past nine in the evening"|"“Drink’s a funny thing,” he said, after a moment or two. “I got drunk once, in Amsterdam, the time I ran away to sea. I remember hearing a church clock strike half past nine in the evening, and I was sitting on the floor with my arms round a pretty red-haired girl. The next thing I knew, it was seven in the following morning, and I was lying on my back in the gutter, without any boots or breeches. I often wonder what I did during those ten hours. I’ve thought and thought, but I’m damned if I can remember.”"|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
07:00|"seven in the following morning"|"“Drink’s a funny thing,” he said, after a moment or two. “I got drunk once, in Amsterdam, the time I ran away to sea.

I’ve thought and thought, but I’m damned if I can remember.”"|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
14:30|"half past two in the afternoon"|"It was a hilarious and rather heated cavalcade that clattered into Launceston at half past two in the afternoon. Mary had thrown trouble and responsibility to the winds, and, in spite of her firm resolution of the early morning, she had melted to Jem’s mood and given herself to gaiety."|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 03:45"|"quarter to four"|"Once more the lynx-eyed man plucked at his sleeve and whispered in his ear. The dealer listened, and pulled a face, and then he nodded. “All right,” he said aloud; “I’ve no doubt that you’re right. You’ve got an eye for trouble, haven’t you? Perhaps we’re better out of it. You can keep your pony,” he added to Jem. “My partner doesn’t fancy him. Take my advice and come down on your price. If you have him for long on your hands you’ll be sorry.” And he elbowed his way through the crowd, with the lynx-eyed man beside him, and they disappeared in the direction of the White Hart. Mary breathed a sigh of relief when she saw the last of them. She could make nothing of Jem’s expression; his lips were framed in the inevitable whistle. People came and went; the shaggy moorland ponies were sold for two or three pounds apiece, and their late owners departed satisfied. No one came near the black pony again. He was looked at askance by the crowd. At a quarter to four Jem sold the other horse for six pounds to a cheerful, honest-looking farmer, after a long and very good-humored argument. The farmer declared he would give five pounds, and Jem stuck out for seven. After twenty minutes’ riotous bargaining the sum of six pounds was agreed, and the farmer rode off on the back of his purchase with a grin from ear to ear. Mary began to flag on her feet. Twilight gathered in the market square and the lamps were lit. The town wore an air of mystery. She was thinking of returning to the jingle when she heard a woman’s voice behind her, and a high affected laugh. She turned and saw the blue cloak and the plumed hat of the woman who had stepped from the coach earlier in the afternoon. “Oh, look, James,” she was saying. “Did you ever see such a delicious pony in your life? He holds his head just like poor Beauty did. The likeness would be quite striking, only this animal of course is black, and has nothing of Beauty’s breeding. What a nuisance Roger isn’t here. I can’t disturb him from his meeting. What do you think of him, James?”"|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"Mary waited, stamping her feet and blowing upon her hands. Jem was taking his own time to fetch the jingle. He was annoyed with her, no doubt, for refusing to stay, and leaving her to become wet and chilled in the open doorway was to be his method of punishment. The long minutes passed and still he did not come. If this was his system of revenge, the plan was without humor and lacked originality. Somewhere a clock struck eight. He had been gone over half an hour, and the place where the pony and jingle were stabled was only five minutes away. Mary was dispirited and tired. She had been on her legs since the early afternoon, and now that the high pitch of excitement had died away she wanted to rest. It would be difficult to recapture the careless, irresponsible mood of the last few hours. Jem had taken his gaiety with him."|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"“He talks, yes,” she answered him. “When my uncle has lived on brandy for five days he’ll bare his soul before the world. He told me so himself, the very first evening I arrived. He was not drunk then. But four days ago, when he had woken from his first stupor, and he came out to the kitchen after midnight, swaying on his two feet—he talked then. That’s why I know. And that’s perhaps why I’ve lost faith in humanity, and in God, and in myself; and why I acted like a fool today in Launceston.”"|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
00:00|midnight|"“You’ll come to heel if I kill you first,” he said. “Do you think you can stand against me, with your monkey face and your damned impudence? And what do you think you do, at midnight, riding on the King’s highway in a hired carriage, half naked, with your hair down your back? You’re nothing but a common slut, after all.” He jerked at her wrist, and she fell."|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 03:00"|three|"A wall of fog closed in upon her, obscuring the distant line of hedge for which she had been making, and she stopped at once in her headlong rush, aware of the danger of sea-mist, and how in its deception it might bring her back to the lane again. She fell at once upon hands and knees, and crawled slowly forward, her eyes low to the ground, following a narrow sandy track that wound in the direction she wished to take. Her progress was slow, but instinct told her that the distance was increasing between her and the pedlar, which was the only thing that mattered. She had no reckoning of time; it was three, perhaps four, in the morning, and the darkness would give no sign of breaking for many hours to come. Once more the rain came down through the curtain of mist, and it seemed as though she could hear the sea on every side of her and there was no escape from it; the breakers were muffled no longer; they were louder and clearer than before. She realized that the wind had been no guide to direction, for even now, with it behind her, it might have shifted a point or two, and with her ignorance of the coast-line she had not turned east, as she had meant to do, but was even now upon the brink of a sagging cliff path that, judging by the sound of the sea, was taking her straight to the shore. The breakers, though she could not see them because of the fog, were somewhere beyond her in the darkness, and to her dismay she sensed they were on a level with her, and not beneath her. This meant that the cliffs here descended abruptly to the shore, and, instead of a long and tortuous path to a cove that she had pictured from the abandoned carriage, the gully-way must have been only a few yards from the sea itself. The banks of the gully had muffled the sound of the breakers. Even as she decided this, there was a gap in the mist ahead of her, showing a patch of sky. She crawled on uncertainly, the path widening and the fog clearing, and the wind veered in her face once more; and there she knelt among driftwood and seaweed and loose shingle, on a narrow strand, with the land sloping up on either side of her, while not fifty yards away, and directly in front of her, were the high combing seas breaking upon the shore."|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"

The breakers, though she could not see them because of the fog, were somewhere beyond her in the darkness, and to her dismay she sensed they were on a level with her, and not beneath her. This meant that the cliffs here descended abruptly to the shore, and, instead of a long and tortuous path to a cove that she had pictured from the abandoned carriage, the gully-way must have been only a few yards from the sea itself. The banks of the gully had muffled the sound of the breakers. Even as she decided this, there was a gap in the mist ahead of her, showing a patch of sky. She crawled on uncertainly, the path widening and the fog clearing, and the wind veered in her face once more; and there she knelt among driftwood and seaweed and loose shingle, on a narrow strand, with the land sloping up on either side of her, while not fifty yards away, and directly in front of her, were the high combing seas breaking upon the shore."|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"“I’ll tell you my day, and you can believe it or not,” she said; “it doesn’t matter much to me what you think. I walked to Launceston on Christmas Eve, and went to the fair. I was tired by eight o’clock, and when it came to rain and blow I was wet through and fit for nothing. I hired that carriage, and I told the man I wanted him to take me to Bodmin. I thought if I said the Jamaica Inn he would have refused the journey. There, I’ve nothing more to tell you than that.”"|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
12:00|midday|"At the midday meal they sat round the table in the kitchen, eating silently, furtively almost, and the landlord, who usually had the appetite of an ox, drummed moodily with his fingers on the table, the cold meat on his plate untouched. Once Mary lifted her eyes and saw him staring at her beneath shaggy brows. The wild fear ran through her mind that he suspected her, and had some knowledge of her plans. She had counted upon his high humor of the preceding night, and had been prepared to fall in with it, if necessary, answer banter with banter, setting up no opposition to his will. He sat sullen, though, wrapped in gloom, and this was a mood she had experienced before, and, she knew now, led to danger. At length she took courage in both hands and asked him what time he intended to leave Jamaica Inn."|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"Mary entered her own little room above the porch and closed the door, turning the key. Her heart beat fast at the prospect of adventure, and she could hardly tell whether excitement or fear had the mastery. It was close on four miles to Altarnun by the road, and she could walk the distance in an hour. If she left Jamaica Inn at four o’clock, when the light was failing, she would be back again soon after six; and the landlord would hardly come to rouse her before seven. She had three hours, then, in which to play her part, and she had already determined upon her method of departure. She would climb out onto the porch, and fall to the ground, as Jem had done this morning. The drop was an easy one, and she would escape with little more than a scratch and a jar to her nerves. At any rate, it would be safer to do this than to risk coming upon her uncle in the passage below. The heavy entrance-door would never open noiselessly, and to go through the bar would mean passing the open kitchen."|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"

"ap 04:00"|four|"She sat by the window, looking out upon the bare yard and the high road where no one ever passed, waiting for the clock in the hall below to strike four. When it sounded at last, the strokes rang out in the silence like an alarm, pounding her nerves; and, unlocking the door, she listened for a moment, hearing footsteps echo the strokes, and whispers in the air."|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"That must be North Hill, and this the manor house belonging to the squire. She went down the avenue to the house, and away in the distance a church clock struck seven. She had been about three hours already from Jamaica Inn. Her nervousness returned as she rounded upon the house, large and forbidding in the darkness, with the moon not yet risen high enough to shine kindly upon it. She swung the great bell, and the sound was met at once by the furious baying of hounds. She waited, and presently she heard footsteps from within, and the door was opened by a manservant. He called sharply at the dogs, who thrust their noses at the door, and sniffed at Mary’s feet. She felt inferior and small, and was conscious of her old dress and shawl before this man who waited for her to speak. “I have come to see Mr. Bassat on very urgent business,” she told him. “He would not know my name, but if he could speak to me for a few minutes I would explain. The matter is of desperate importance, otherwise I would not disturb him at such an hour, and on a Sunday night.”"|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"When the clock on the mantelpiece chimed eight o’clock in piercing tones. Mary could bear it no longer. This dragging inactivity was worse than danger and pursuit. “Forgive me,” she said, rising to her feet; “you have been so kind, and I can never thank you enough; but I am anxious, desperately anxious. I can think of nothing but my poor aunt, who at this moment may be suffering the tortures of hell. I must know what is happening at Jamaica Inn, if I walk back there myself tonight.”"|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"Mrs. Bassat dropped her album in a flutter of distress. “Of course you are anxious. I have seen it all along, and tried to take your mind off it. How terrible it is. I am as concerned as you are, for my husband’s sake. But you cannot possibly walk back there now, alone. Why, it would be after midnight before you arrived, and heaven knows what might not happen to you on the way. I will order the trap, and Richards shall go with you. He is most trustworthy and dependable, and can be armed in case of need. If there is fighting in progress, you would see it from the bottom of the hill, and would not approach until it was over. I would come with you myself, but my health is delicate at the moment and…”"|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 10:30"|"half past ten"|"Anything might have happened during the five hours she had been absent from Jamaica Inn, and even with the trap she could scarcely hope to arrive there before half past ten. She could make no plans, and her action depended upon the moment when it came. With the moon now high in the sky and the soft air blowing upon her she felt emboldened to face disaster when it came, and this ride to the scene of action, however dangerous, was better than sitting like a helpless child listening to the prattle of Mrs. Bassat. This man Richards was armed, and she herself would use a gun if necessary. He was burning with curiosity, of course, but she gave short answers to his questions, and did not encourage him."|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap < 11:00"|"nearly eleven o’clock"|"Her heart sank; and she wondered if she should return to Richards and the trap, and wait, as he had suggested, until Squire Bassat and his men arrived. She glanced once more at the shuttered house. Surely, if her uncle intended to leave, he would have gone before now. The cart alone would take an hour to load, and it must be nearly eleven o’clock. He might have altered his plans, and decided to go on foot, but then Aunt Patience could never accompany him. Mary hesitated; the situation had become odd now, and unreal."|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 01:00"|one|"The vicar had driven her himself in the trap—with the squire’s groom following behind on his horse—and he at least had the gift of silence, for he questioned her not at all, nor murmured sympathy to be both wasted and ignored, but drove swiftly to Altarnun, and arrived there as his church clock struck one."|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"< 16:00"|"nearly four in the afternoon"|"It was nearly four in the afternoon before she woke, and the fourteen hours of sleep had done the work that he intended, turning the edge of sorrow and blunting her to pain. The sharp grief for Aunt Patience had softened, and the bitterness too. Reason told her that she could not put the blame upon herself: she had done only what her conscience had commanded her to do. Justice had come first. Her dull wit had not foreseen the tragedy; there lay the fault. There remained regret, and regret could not bring Aunt Patience back again."|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap < 06:00"|"a few minutes before six"|"“Have you eaten today?” he said, and, when she told him she had not, he took out his watch and noted the time—a few minutes before six—which he compared with the clock upon his desk. “You have supped with me before, Mary Yellan, and you shall sup with me again,” he said; “but this time, if you do not mind and if you are rested enough, you shall lay the table and fetch the tray from the kitchen. Hannah will have left it prepared, and we will not trouble her again. For my part, I have writing to do; that is, if you have no objection.”"|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 06:45"|"quarter to seven"|"She assured him that she was rested, and would like nothing better than to make herself useful, and he nodded his head then and said, “At a quarter to seven,” turning his back on her; and she gathered she was dismissed."|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 02:00"|two|"“I never said that. I wondered only at your patience. It had not struck two when I bade you sleep this morning, and it is now seven in the evening. Long hours; and things do not stand still by themselves.”"|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"

"ap 08:00"|eight|"“I slept until eight. And then I breakfasted and was away again. My gray horse was lame and I could not use him, so progress was slow with the cob. He jogged like a snail to Jamaica Inn, and from Jamaica Inn to North Hill.”"|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"< 19:00"|"near seven o’clock in the evening"|"“Yesterday was Sunday, was it not? And on Sunday no blacksmith plies his trade unless he has great respect for his customer. Only one traveler passed Tom Jory’s smithy yesterday, and begged a new nail for his lame horse, and the time was, I suppose, somewhere near seven o’clock in the evening. After which the traveler continued his journey by way of Jamaica Inn.”"|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 08:30"|"half past eight"|"She saw by the clock that he must have overstepped already his margin of time and had little in reserve. He concealed his impatience well, but it was there, in the flicker of his eye and the tightening of his lips. It was half past eight, and by now Jem would have spoken with the blacksmith at Warleggan. Twelve miles lay between them perhaps, but no more. And Jem was not the fool that Mary herself had been. She thought rapidly, weighing the chances of failure and success. If she went now with Francis Davey she would be a drag upon him, and a brake on his speed: that was inevitable, and he must have gambled upon it. The chase would follow hard upon his heels, and her presence would betray him in the end. Should she refuse to go, why then there would be a knife in her heart at best, for he would not encumber himself with a wounded companion, for all his flattery."|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
00:00|midnight|"“You should have heard me preach,” he said softly. “They sat there in the stalls like sheep, even as I drew them, with their mouths agape and their souls asleep. The church was a roof above their heads, with four walls of stone, and because it had been blessed at the beginning by human hands they thought it holy. They do not know that beneath the foundation-stone lie the bones of their pagan ancestors, and the old granite altars where sacrifice was held long before Christ died upon His cross. I have stood in the church at midnight, Mary, and listened to the silence; there is a murmur in the air and a whisper of unrest that is bred deep in the soil and has no knowledge of the church and Altarnun.”"|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
00:00|midnight|"“You are tired, yet you persist in watching for the dawn,” he said. “It is barely midnight now, and there are long hours to wait. Give way to nature, Mary Yellan, and relax. Do you think I want to harm you?”"|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
12:00|midday|"Loneliness was a thing of poor account, and came not into her consideration. A worker paid no heed to solitude, but slept when his day was done. She had determined upon her course, and the way seemed fair and good to follow. She would not linger anymore as she had done during the week, faint and indecisive, but make known her project to the Bassats when she returned for the midday meal. They were kind and full of suggestions—overful, perhaps, with their entreaties that she should stay among them, for the winter at least—and, rather than she should feel a burden upon them, had put to her, with kindly tact, that they would employ her even in some position in the household—have a care, perhaps, for the children, be companion to Mrs. Bassat herself."|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"> 12:00"|"past noon"|"“It’s past noon already, and I ought to be on the road. I’ve havered here long enough,” he said. “If you were a man I’d ask you to come with me, and you’d fling your legs over the seat and stick your hands in your pockets and rub shoulders with me for as long as it pleased you.”"|"Jamaica Inn"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
