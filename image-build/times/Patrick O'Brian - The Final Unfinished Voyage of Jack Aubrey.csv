Stephen dressed the wound, such as it was (more bruise than blood and no bone broken) and said to his loblolly-boy, ‘Tell Dr Jacob, when he comes back, that this boy is to have no grog for the next three days, and tomorrow he may keep his hammock.’ Dr Jacob, the surgeon’s mate, was away visiting friends aboard the frigate’s tender, the rapid and windwardly Chesapeake schooner Ringle, and Stephen glanced in her direction, fine on the starboard bow, before going down from the brilliance of noon to the comparatively sombre cabin that he shared with Captain Aubrey."|"The Final Unfinished Voyage of Jack Aubrey"|"Patrick O'Brian"
