15:00|"three o'clock that afternoon"|"
""Finished,"" Norris grunted at three o'clock that afternoon.
""Thirty-six K-99s,"" murmured the Anthropos file-clerk, gazing over Norris's shoulder at the clip-board with the list of doubtful neuts and the dealers to whom they had been sent. ""Lots of owners may be hard to locate."""|"Dark Benediction"|"Walter M. Miller Jr_"
"ap 06:00"|six|"Anne met him at the door when he came home at six. He stood on the porch for a moment, smiling at her weakly. The smile was not returned."|"Dark Benediction"|"Walter M. Miller Jr_"
12:00|noon|"""Easy on those warrants, boy. Judge Charleman can't be bothered just any time. I can get the newts to you by noon, I guess, provided we don't have to get a helicopter posse to chase down the mothers."""|"Dark Benediction"|"Walter M. Miller Jr_"
"ap 07:10"|"Seven ten"|"""Seven ten. Oh, the doe called to say he'd be a few minutes late. He was busy all day with a sick baby."""|"Dark Benediction"|"Walter M. Miller Jr_"
00:00|midnight|"They went to bed at midnight. At one o'clock, he became certain she was asleep. He lay in darkness for a time, listening to her even breathing. Then he sat up and eased himself out of bed. There was work to be done. He tiptoed quietly out of the bedroom, carrying his shoes and his trousers. He dressed in the kitchen by the glow of a cigaret ember and stole quietly out into the chilly night. A half-moon hung low in a misty sky, and the wind was sharp out of the north. He walked quietly toward the kennels. There were only three empty cages. He needed twenty-seven to accommodate the doubtful K-99s that were to be picked up during the next few days. There was work to be done."|"Dark Benediction"|"Walter M. Miller Jr_"

"ap 01:00"|100|"Man's technology had created little for the individual. Man used his technology to lengthen his life and sweeten it, but something had to be subtracted somewhere. The lives of the unborn were added unto the years of the aged. A son of Terry Norris might easily live till 100, but he would have damn little chance of being born to do it."|"Dark Benediction"|"Walter M. Miller Jr_"
12:00|noon|"At noon he brought home another dozen K-99s and installed them in the cages. Two reluctant mothers had put up a howl, but he departed without protest and left seizure of the animals to the local authorities. Yates had already delivered the three from yesterday."|"Dark Benediction"|"Walter M. Miller Jr_"
"ap 00:50"|"ten to one"|"""What? Whether to destroy her or not?"" Mulreany snorted irritably. ""Not if there was the least doubt in my mind about her. She's a shadow in the brush. Maybe it's ten to one that the shadow's a bear and not a man—but on the one chance, don't shoot, son, don't shoot."""|"Dark Benediction"|"Walter M. Miller Jr_"
00:00|midnight|"Chief Miler strode about the three rooms like a man looking for a burglar at midnight. He nudged the body of the neutroid with his foot. ""What's this, Norris?"""|"Dark Benediction"|"Walter M. Miller Jr_"
"ap 01:00"|"one o'clock"|"He came to work an hour early on Wednesday morning and sped through his usual chores on overdrive. He finished his work before one o'clock, had a shower back-stage, changed to street clothes, and went nervously up-stairs to ask Imperio D'Uccia for the rest of the day off."|"Dark Benediction"|"Walter M. Miller Jr_"
"ap 09:55"|"Five till ten"|"""Never!"" the old actor proclaimed resonantly, and glanced up at the clock. Five till ten. Nearly time for D'Uccia to arrive for work. He smiled to himself."|"Dark Benediction"|"Walter M. Miller Jr_"
"ap 02:00"|"two o'clock"|"""Never mind! Just get the new pickup mechanism over here for Thomas. And the Peltier tape. And don't have a wreck. It's two o'clock, and tonight's opening, and we're still short our leading man. And there's no time to get anything else flown in from Smithfield."""|"Dark Benediction"|"Walter M. Miller Jr_"
"ap 05:55"|"five minutes till six"|"At five minutes till six, Rick Thomas and a man from the Smithfield depot climbed down out of the booth, and Jade pressed forward through the crowd to question him with her eyes."|"Dark Benediction"|"Walter M. Miller Jr_"
"< 12:00"|"Toward noon"|"After two blocks, Paul stopped running. He sat panting on a fire hydrant and chided himself for being overly cautious. The man had been dead for months; and infection was achieved only through contact. Nevertheless, his scalp was still tingling. When he had rested briefly, he continued his plodding course toward the heart of the city. Toward noon, he saw another human being."|"Dark Benediction"|"Walter M. Miller Jr_"
"< 00:00"|"Before midnight"|"Before midnight, the party had returned to the hospital. Paul lay on a comfortable mattress for the first time in weeks, sleepless, and staring at the moonlight on the sill. Somewhere downstairs, Willie was lying unconscious in an operating room, while the surgeon tried to repair the torn tendon. Paul had ridden back with them in the ambulance, sitting a few feet from the stretcher, avoiding her sometimes wandering arms, and listening to her delirious moaning."|"Dark Benediction"|"Walter M. Miller Jr_"
00:00|twenty-four|"""Well, it'll start at twenty-four different times, depending on where you are. Maybe more than twenty-four. It's August. Some places, they set the clocks ahead an hour in Summer."""|"Dark Benediction"|"Walter M. Miller Jr_"
"ap 04:40"|"four forty"|"""Blasting operation at the next tower site will occur in ten minutes,""came the announcement. ""Demol team requests safety clearance over all of zones two and three, from four forty to five hundred hours. There will be scatter-glass in both zones. Zone two is to be evacuated immediately, and all personnel in zone three take line-of-sight cover from the red marker. I repeat: there will be scatter-glass . . ."""|"Dark Benediction"|"Walter M. Miller Jr_"
09:00|"nine in the morning"|"They were very methodical about it, like men handling an unruly circus animal. Marya stood in line with a dozen other prisoners, waiting her turn to be interrogated. It was nine in the morning, and the sun was evaporating the last of the dew on the tents in the camp. The sergeant had gone into the bunker to report to Major Kline and present the articles her captors had taken from her per-son. He had been gone ten minutes. When he came out, the Blue Shirts were still, whipping the prisoner. The old man had fainted."|"Dark Benediction"|"Walter M. Miller Jr_"
02:00|"two a.m."|"But he clammed up and refused to discuss anything about the matter. That night I awoke at two a.m. Something had made a sound. I stole out of bed without disturbing Cleo and went to prowl about the house. A glance down the stairway told me that no lights burned on the first floor. I went to Kenny's room and gingerly opened the door. Blackness."|"Dark Benediction"|"Walter M. Miller Jr_"
"> 00:00"|"Shortly after midnight"|"Shortly after midnight, I awoke to hear him tiptoe down the hall. I let him get downstairs and into the kitchen before I stole out of bed and went to the head of the stairs. ""Kenny!"" I shouted. ""Come back up here! Right now!"" There was a brief silence. Then he bolted. The screen door slammed, and bare feet trotted down the back steps. ""Kenny!"""|"Dark Benediction"|"Walter M. Miller Jr_"
"ap 01:00"|one|"She sagged to the floor of the hall and babbled aloud ""Hickory Dickory Dock, the mouse ran up the clock. The clock struck one—"""|"Dark Benediction"|"Walter M. Miller Jr_"

"ap 10:18"|ten-eighteen|"The other clock was leading by five and one-quarter minutes. He typed 5.250 on the keyboard. Nothing happened. ""You sure that's right?"" he called.
""It's now ten-eighteen—ten... fifteen ...twenty.""
The clock was still slowing down. He tried 5.230, but again nothing happened. The unit refused to respond. He arose with an angry grunt and began prowling around the library. ""There's something else,"" he muttered. ""There must be a modifying factor. That clock's too obvious anyway. But what else could they be measuring together except time?"""|"Dark Benediction"|"Walter M. Miller Jr_"

"ap 01:00"|"one of the clocks"|"He paused to grin. ""Could be! The barometric pressure difference from the mean could easily be mechanically added or subtracted from the reading of that wacky clock. Visualize this, inside of Central: The two clock motors mounted on the same shaft, with the distance between their indicator needles as the code number. Except that the distance is modified by having a barometer rigged up to shift one of the clocks one way or the other on its axis when the pressure varies. It's simple enough."""|"Dark Benediction"|"Walter M. Miller Jr_"
"ap 01:03"|1.03|"She shook her head. Mitch took the barometer with him to the unit. The dial was calibrated in atmospheres, and the pressure was now 1.03. Surely, he thought, for simplicity's sake, there would be no other factor involved in the code. This way, Sarquist could have glanced at his watch and the wall clock and the barometer and could have known the code number with only a little mental arithmetic. The wall time minus the wrist time plus the barometer's reading."|"Dark Benediction"|"Walter M. Miller Jr_"

We blasted off Jod VII at thirteen hours, Universal Patrol Time, switched on the high-C drive, and penetrated to the ten-thousandth level of the C'th component. We re-entered the continuum on the outer patrol radius at thirty-six degrees theta and two-hundred degrees psi. My navigator threw the dice to select a random course. We were to proceed to a point on the same co-ordinate shell at thirty theta and one-fifty psi. We began—"""|"Dark Benediction"|"Walter M. Miller Jr_"
12:00|noon|"He spent the following day watching the Sol ship, and waiting fatalistically for the police to come and question him about the Solarian's death. But the police failed to come. A check with the news agencies revealed that the man's body had not even been found. Roki was puzzled. He had left the giant lying in plain sight where he had fallen. At noon, the Solarian crew came bearing several lead cases slung from the centers of carrying poles. They wore metal gauntlets and handled the cases cautiously. Roki knew they contained radioactive materials. So that was what they purchased with their surgibank supplies—nuclear fuels."|"Dark Benediction"|"Walter M. Miller Jr_"

"ap 11:00"|"eleven o'clock"|"At eleven o'clock, a lion roared in the hangar. At eleven o'clock a steel juggernaut tore through the hangar wall and paused on a concrete ramp while bullets ricocheted off the hull. Then the first star-chariot burnt a verticle column of flame in the night. Thunder walked upward on fiery stilts, while men shouted angrily. When we were alone in the airless, star-stung, sun-torn blackness, I stroked the web of space, and listened to the muted notes. When the tune is memorized, I speak. I contradict. I refute the universe. We lived in a spaceless space beyond stars."|"Dark Benediction"|"Walter M. Miller Jr_"
