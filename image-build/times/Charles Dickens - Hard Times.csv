Stephen looked at her, saw how pale she was, noted the disorder of her hair, and the red marks of fingers on her forehead, and felt assured that his senses of sight and hearing had been awake. She held the cup in her hand even now."|"Hard Times"|"Charles Dickens"
12:00|noon|"“Oh!” said Mrs. Gradgrind, “so you have settled it! Well, I’m sure I hope your health may be good, Louisa, for if your head begins to split as soon as you are married, which was the case with mine, I cannot consider that you are to be envied, though I have no doubt you think you are, as all girls do. However, I give you joy, my dear—and I hope you may now turn all your ological studies to good account, I am sure I do! I must give you a kiss of congratulation, Louisa, but don’t touch my right shoulder, for there’s something running down it all day long. And now you see,” whimpered Mrs. Gradgrind, adjusting her shawls after the affectionate ceremony, “I shall be worrying myself, morning, noon, and night, to know what I am to call him!”"|"Hard Times"|"Charles Dickens"

The round of visits was made; and Mr. James Harthouse, with a discreet use of his blue coaching, came off triumphantly, though with a considerable accession of boredom."|"Hard Times"|"Charles Dickens"

For the same reason I don’t make all my journey in one day, but divide it into two days, and get a bed tonight at the Travellers’ Coffee House down by the railroad (a nice clean house), and go back Parliamentary, at six in the morning. Well, but what has this to do with this good lass, says you? I’m going to tell you. I have heard of Mr. Bounderby being married. I read it in the paper, where it looked grand—oh, it looked fine!”—the old woman dwelt on it with strange enthusiasm—“and I want to see his wife. I have never seen her yet. Now, if you’ll believe me, she hasn’t come out of that house since noon today. So not to give her up too easily, I was waiting about a little last bit more, when I passed close to this good lass two or three times, and her face being so friendly I spoke to her, and she spoke to me. There!” said the old woman to Stephen, “you can make all the rest out for yourself now, a deal shorter than I can, I dare say!”"|"Hard Times"|"Charles Dickens"

There was a sweep of some half-mile between the lodge and the house, and he was riding along at a foot pace over the smooth gravel, once Nickits’s, when Mr. Bounderby burst out of the shrubbery with such violence as to make his horse shy across the road."|"Hard Times"|"Charles Dickens"
"ap ~ 00:00"|"about twelve o’clock"|"“Well!” said the exasperated Bounderby, “while he was snoring, or choking, or Dutch-clocking, or something or other—being asleep—some fellows, somehow, whether previously concealed in the house or not remains to be seen, got to young Tom’s safe, forced it, and abstracted the contents. Being then disturbed, they made off, letting themselves out at the main door, and double-locking it again (it was double-locked, and the key under Mrs. Sparsit’s pillow) with a false key, which was picked up in the street near the Bank about twelve o’clock today. No alarm takes place till this chap, Bitzer, turns out this morning, and begins to open and prepare the offices for business. Then, looking at Tom’s safe, he sees the door ajar, and finds the lock forced, and the money gone.”"|"Hard Times"|"Charles Dickens"

That could hardly be, she knew, until an hour past midnight, but in the country silence, which did anything but calm the trouble of her thoughts, time lagged wearily. At last, when the darkness and stillness had seemed for hours to thicken one another, she heard the bell at the gate. She felt as though she would have been glad that it rang on until daylight, but it ceased, and the circles of its last sound spread out fainter and wider in the air, and all was dead again."|"Hard Times"|"Charles Dickens"
"ap 00:00"|"twelve o’clock"|"“I think differently,” blustered Bounderby. “I am going to finish this business according to my own opinions. Now, I don’t want to make a quarrel of it with you, Tom Gradgrind. To tell you the truth, I don’t think it would be worthy of my reputation to quarrel on such a subject. As to your gentleman-friend, he may take himself off, wherever he likes best. If he falls in my way, I shall tell him my mind; if he don’t fall in my way, I shan’t, for it won’t be worth my while to do it. As to your daughter, whom I made Loo Bounderby, and might have done better by leaving Loo Gradgrind, if she don’t come home tomorrow, by twelve o’clock at noon, I shall understand that she prefers to stay away, and I shall send her wearing apparel and so forth over here, and you’ll take charge of her for the future. What I shall say to people in general, of the incompatibility that led to my so laying down the law, will be this. I am Josiah Bounderby, and I had my bringing-up; she’s the daughter of Tom Gradgrind, and she had her bringing-up; and the two horses wouldn’t pull together. I am pretty well known to be rather an uncommon man, I believe; and most people will understand fast enough that it must be a woman rather out of the common, also, who, in the long run, would come up to my mark.”"|"Hard Times"|"Charles Dickens"

Difficulties had arisen in the construction of this machine, simple as it was; requisites had been found wanting, and messages had had to go and return. It was five o’clock in the afternoon of the bright autumnal Sunday before a candle was sent down to try the air, while three or four rough faces stood crowded close together attentively watching it, the men at the windlass lowering as they were told. The candle was brought up again, feebly burning, and then some water was cast in. Then the bucket was hooked on and the sobered man and another got in with lights, giving the word, “Lower away!”"|"Hard Times"|"Charles Dickens"

Though they took but a hasty breakfast and no rest (which it would have been in vain to seek under such anxious circumstances), it was noon before they began to find the bills of Sleary’s Horse-riding on barns and walls, and one o’clock when they stopped in the market-place."|"Hard Times"|"Charles Dickens"
