At the time the pair happened to be working in an academic community in the Vosges mountains of eastern France—and it was here that they got finally to christen this great body of land, and to offer it an identity it would then have for all time. Both of the mapmakers had read the Mundus Novus; both had read and were taken in by the more evidently forged Soderini Letter. Both agreed that in the preparation of an enormous new world map that had been commissioned from them, they would give, at least to the thinly sinuous southern part of the new continent that would be drawn on their masterpiece, a name. They would give it the feminine form of the Latinized version of Amerigo Vespucci’s Christian name: the properly feminine place nouns of Africa, Asia, and Europe would now be joined, quite simply, by a brand-new entity that they would name America."|Atlantic|"Simon Winchester"

At four o’clock sharp every Thursday, one liner would leave Table Bay while a sister ship would slip southbound out of the Solent. They would pass one another, saying a brief hello, somewhere off the coast of Senegal. “Seventeen Days!” the newspaper advertisements would cry: “Weekly Mail Service to South Africa.

In the fifteenth century Spain was poised, this time quite literally, between the two seas that, at this remove, can be seen to have shifted suddenly in their relationship and their relative importance. To the east was the Mediterranean—which was now blockaded at each end by Muslims, the Moors at one, and the Turks at the other. To the west was the Atlantic—a body of water that was largely free of the predatory and hostile Islamists, and into which Spanish vessels could sail unchallenged and unmolested. So the Spaniards must have seen the Atlantic as a means of furthering Spain’s imperial ambitions and as a way of forgoing and forgetting the now suddenly uncongenial Mediterranean."|Atlantic|"Simon Winchester"

Finally they spotted the masts of a radio station, circled it a number of times without at first managing to wake anyone—it was 8 A.M. on an Irish Sunday, and the aftereffects of Guinness must have trumped the callings of piety—and settled the plane onto a field, crash-landed, and ended up nose down in soggy black peat."|Atlantic|"Simon Winchester"

When the much more showy and popular Charles Lindbergh single-handedly flew the Spirit of St. Louis from Long Island to Le Bourget in 1927, he gave due credit to the pair: Alcock and Brown, he said, had showed him the way.
