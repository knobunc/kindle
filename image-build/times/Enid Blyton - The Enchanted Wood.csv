00:00|midnight|"The trap-door flew open and out shot Moon-Face on a yellow cushion. He put the three cushions together, whistled to the red squirrel who looked after them, and threw them to him. Then he turned to the waiting girls.
""There’s a train at midnight,"" he said. ""We shall have to hurry.""
The wood was still bright with moonlight. The three of them hurried between the trees. Suddenly Bessie heard the chuffing of a train, and she and Fanny stopped in surprise. They saw a small train winding in and out of the trees, looking for all the world like a clockwork train made big! The engine even had a key still in its side!"|"The Enchanted Wood"|"Enid Blyton"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"""We’ll find someone to help us,"" said Moon-Face gloomily, and they all set off, followed by their hens, their goat, and the clock, which kept striking four o’clock, nobody knew why."|"The Enchanted Wood"|"Enid Blyton"
20:09|twenty-nine|"Silky’ s clock got terribly excited too. It struck twenty-nine without stopping."|"The Enchanted Wood"|"Enid Blyton"
15:00|"three o’clock that afternoon"|"They sent a note back by the little goat, saying that they would arrive at three o’clock that afternoon. The children were excited. Mother had gone by that time, and the girls began to make the cottage look pretty with jars of flowers. Bessie baked some chocolate cakes, and Fanny made some toffee. ]o cut bread and butter."|"The Enchanted Wood"|"Enid Blyton"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"By three o’clock everything was ready. The children were neat and clean. The table looked fine with its bread and butter, cakes, and toffee. Bessie went to the gate to look for their visitors."|"The Enchanted Wood"|"Enid Blyton"
"ap 03:30"|"Half-past three"|"Half-past three came and no visitors. The children were rather disappointed. ""Perhaps Moon-Face read my letter wrongly, and thought it was four o’clock,"" said Bessie."|"The Enchanted Wood"|"Enid Blyton"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"Half-past three came and no visitors. The children were rather disappointed. ""Perhaps Moon-Face read my letter wrongly, and thought it was four o’clock,"" said Bessie."|"The Enchanted Wood"|"Enid Blyton"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"But when four o’clock came and still no Moon-Face, Silky, or Saucepan Man arrived, they got really worried."|"The Enchanted Wood"|"Enid Blyton"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"""We’ll wait a bit longer, then we’ll eat our share,"" said ]o. So, when five o’clock came, and nobody had arrived, the children sadly ate half the tea themselves."|"The Enchanted Wood"|"Enid Blyton"
14:00|fourteen|"The clock struck fourteen without stopping. It wandered about, looking as happy as could be."|"The Enchanted Wood"|"Enid Blyton"
08:00|"eight that day"|"""The birthday cake is coming!"" shouted Jo, and every one watched the silver dish. Gradually a great cake shaped itself there—oh, a wonderful cake, with red, pink, white, and yellow icing. All round the side were flowers made of sweets. On the top were eight candles burning, for Bessie was eight that day. Her name was written in big sugar letters on the top: ""BESSIE. A VERY HAPPY BIRTHDAY!"""|"The Enchanted Wood"|"Enid Blyton"
22:00|twenty-two|"""Just the thing to clean you with!"" said Silky in delight. The clock was very pleased. It struck twenty-two times without stopping, much to the walking doll’s astonishment."|"The Enchanted Wood"|"Enid Blyton"
00:00|midnight|"""We have to go home at midnight,"" said Moon-Face, pushing away Silky’s clock, which was trying to sit on his toadstool with him."|"The Enchanted Wood"|"Enid Blyton"
00:00|midnight|"""How shall we know when it’s midnight?"" asked Fanny, thinking that really it was quite time her doll went to bed."|"The Enchanted Wood"|"Enid Blyton"
00:00|midnight|"They knew all right—because when midnight came Silky’ s clock stood up straight and struck loudly, twelve times-Dong-dong-dong-dong- dong-dong-dong-dong-dong-dong-dong-dong!"|"The Enchanted Wood"|"Enid Blyton"
