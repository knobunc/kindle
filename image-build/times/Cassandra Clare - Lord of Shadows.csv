00:00|Midnight|"“He was the one who got my father involved in all that stuff with the Followers and the Midnight Theater,” said Kit, his tone almost thoughtful. “It’s Malcolm’s fault he died.”"|"Lord of Shadows"|"Cassandra Clare"
"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"The day stayed hot until the late afternoon, when a storm rolled in over the ocean. The Centurions had left before noon, and Emma couldn’t help but stare out the windows anxiously as the sun set behind a mass of black and gray clouds on the horizon, shot through with heat lightning."|"Lord of Shadows"|"Cassandra Clare"
"< 00:00"|"Almost midnight"|"“Almost midnight,” he said. “I wonder how much of a head start Mark has.”"|"Lord of Shadows"|"Cassandra Clare"
00:00|Midnight|"“It depends how long he had to wait for the right moment to step on the path,” said Cristina. “Such moments come and go. Midnight is only one of them.”"|"Lord of Shadows"|"Cassandra Clare"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"They’d decided—with Kit mostly as silent onlooker—to go directly to Arthur Blackthorn’s office. Even if it was two in the morning, even if he didn’t want to be bothered with Centurion business, he needed to know what Zara was planning."|"Lord of Shadows"|"Cassandra Clare"
04:00|"four in the morning"|"Only the three of them—Livvy, Ty, and Kit—were left in the parlor. Everyone else had gone to bed. Kit guessed from the quality of the darkness outside that it was probably three or four in the morning, but he wasn’t tired. It could be jet lag, or Portal lag, or whatever they called it; it could be the contagious relief of the others that they were all reunited again."|"Lord of Shadows"|"Cassandra Clare"
"ap < 05:00"|"nearly five o’clock"|"Julian was tall enough to need to duck under the low-hanging doorframe to get into the inn. Emma followed, and a few moments later they were being shown to a table by a cheerful, plump woman in a flowered dress. It was nearly five o’clock and the place was mostly deserted. A sense of history hung lightly about it, from the uneven floorboards to the walls decorated with smuggling memorabilia, old maps, and cheerful illustrations of Cornish piskies, the mischievous Fair Folk native to the area. Emma wondered how much the locals believed in them. Not as much as they should, she suspected."|"Lord of Shadows"|"Cassandra Clare"
12:00|noon|"Magnus sang. Cristina looked at him in surprise. He had a nice singing voice, though she didn’t know the melody. Sun, little sun, warm me a little, for the noon, for the dawning, for all the week long."|"Lord of Shadows"|"Cassandra Clare"
"< 12:00"|"nearly noon"|"It was nearly noon and the sun was high in the sky by the time they made it to Porthallow Church—apparently what was close for piskies wasn’t what humans would call nearby. Though Emma kept hearing the high voice of the piskie in her head. Killing close, it had said. Whatever that meant, she didn’t like the sound of it."|"Lord of Shadows"|"Cassandra Clare"
