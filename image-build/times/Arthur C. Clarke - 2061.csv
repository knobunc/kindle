Tsien stands - stood - about thirty metres from the edge of the Grand Canal. Pipes go directly from it and down through the ice. Very thin - not safe to walk on. The warm upwelling…’"|2061|"Arthur C.

So the drive will shut down at 23.00, and the ship will be reversed. We’ll have two hours of weightlessness before we commence thrust again at 01.00."|2061|"Arthur C. Clarke"

"ap 00:00"|12.00|"‘So we’ll go weightless at 12.00 exactly. Before then, your cabin stewards will check that everything’s correctly stowed. It will be just like turnaround, except that this time it’s going to be three days, not two hours, before we have weight again."|2061|"Arthur C. Clarke"
"ap 01:05"|01.05|"So at 01.05, Universal Time, Second Officer Chang was alone on the bridge, while the ship was sleeping around him. There was no real need for him to be awake either, since Galaxy’s electronic senses would detect any malfunction far sooner than he could possibly do. But a century of cybernetics had proved that human beings were still slightly better than machines at dealing with the unexpected; and sooner or later, the unexpected always happened."|2061|"Arthur C. Clarke"
12:00|noon|"It was a very young sea, being less than fifty years old; and, like most new-born infants, could be quite boisterous. Although the Europan atmosphere was still too thin to generate real hurricanes, a steady wind blew from the surrounding land towards the tropical zone at the point above which Lucifer was stationary. Here, at the point of perpetual noon, the water was continually boiling - though at a temperature, in this thin atmosphere, barely hot enough to make a good cup of tea."|2061|"Arthur C. Clarke"

There was, of course, none of the formal dress that had been mandatory aboard the floating palaces of the North Atlantic, but there was usually some attempt at sartorial novelty. Yva could always be relied upon to produce some new brooch, ring, necklace, hair-ribbon, or perfume from an apparently inexhaustible supply."|2061|"Arthur C. Clarke"

Midnight in the Plaza
The famous building, towering in solitary splendour above the woods of central Manhattan, had changed little in a thousand years. It was part of history, and had been reverently preserved. Like all historic monuments, it had long ago been coated with a microthin layer of diamond, and was now virtually impervious to the ravages of time."|2061|"Arthur C. Clarke"
00:00|midnight|"The last tourists had left an hour ago, and the Plaza was utterly deserted. The sky was cloudless, and a few of the brighter stars were just visible; all the fainter ones had been routed by the tiny sun that could shine at midnight."|2061|"Arthur C. Clarke"
