00:00|midnight|"I wonder, he thought with a grin, what sort of priest I would have made. Picture yourself pale and soft-voiced, Duffy my lad, rustling hither and yon in a cassock that smells of incense. Ho ho. I never even came near it. Why, he reflected, within a week of my arrival at the seminary I’d begun to be plagued by the odd occurrences that led, before long, to my dismissal—blasphemous footnotes, in a handwriting I certainly didn’t recognize, were discovered on nearly every page of my breviary; oh yes, and once, during a twilight stroll with an elderly priest, seven young oak trees, one after another, twisted themselves to the ground as I passed; and of course worst of all, there was the time I threw a fit in church during the midnight Easter mass, shouting, they later told me, for the need-fires to be lit on the hilltops and the old king to be brought forth and killed."|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"
">> 12:00"|"well after noon"|"The wine was unlocking Duffy’s memories. The sky had been overcast, he recalled, and both sides had simply milled about on opposite sides of the Mohács plain until well after noon. Then the Hungarian cavalry had charged; the Turkish center gave way, and Duffy’s troop of German infantry had followed the Hungarians into the trap. That was as hellish a maelstrom as I ever hope to find myself in, he thought now, sipping his wine—when those damned Turks suddenly stopped retreating, and turned on the pursuing troops."|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"He glanced at the sky—an hour or so after midnight. No sense now, he thought, in going back to San Giorgio; the only thing worth mentioning that waits for me there is a landlord, justly angry about my failure to pay rent. I’d better find some kind of rooming house to spend the night in, and then get an early start tomorrow. A few hours’ sleep in a moderately clean bed is what I need right now. It’s been a tiring night."|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"
00:00|midnight|"With a yell Duffy ran toward the door, but his own legs weren’t working correctly, and he made slow progress. Then he must have fallen, for he blacked out and dropped away through hundreds of disturbing dreams … he was a child crying with fear in a dark stone room; he was an old, dishonored king, bleeding to death in the rain, watched over by one loyal retainer; he stood with two women beside a fire on a midnight moor, staring into the black sky with a desperate hope; in a narrow boat he drifted on a vast, still lake; he sat across a table from a shockingly ancient man, who stared at him with pity and said, “Much has been lost, and there is much yet to lose.” The dreams became dim and incomprehensible after that, like a parade dwindling in the distance, leaving him finally alone in a land so dark and cold it could never have known the sun."|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"“Wake up, now,” Duffy told him as he climbed into the saddle. “The sun’s up, and it’ll burn off this damned mist before ten o’clock. By noon we’ll have forgot what this was like.”"|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"
12:00|noon|"“Wake up, now,” Duffy told him as he climbed into the saddle. “The sun’s up, and it’ll burn off this damned mist before ten o’clock. By noon we’ll have forgot what this was like.”"|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"Weariness and brandy made him sleep soundly in his treetop bed, but some time after midnight he was awakened by hoarse, deep-voiced calls. What the hell, he thought groggily; a gang of men on the road. Then he froze—for the voices sounded from above, and the speakers, unless Duffy was the victim of some kind of ventriloquism, were moving across the sky."|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"
"< 12:00"|"Toward midday"|"Toward midday the wind died down. It had blown away the cloud cover, and the sunlight began to make Duffy sleepy, so he laid his cloak under a tree and stretched out on it, dozing in the dappled evergreen shade."|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"The bells in the tower of St. Stephen’s Cathedral rang while Duffy was speaking, and Werner pointed vaguely in their southward direction. “It’s ten o’clock you sleep until, eh? Well, enjoy sleeping late while you still can.”"|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"
12:00|noon|"Duffy gave a polite glance to the maelstrom of churning figures. When he had first seen the picture, possibly seven years ago, he’d had to look closely to see the faint outlines of the shapes on the white plaster; and when he left Vienna in ’twenty-six the wall was a finely shaded drawing, crowded and vague in subject but faultless in execution. Now it was much darker, for every day the artist added hundreds of strokes, deepening shadows and, very gradually, blacking out some peripheral figures altogether. Three years ago the scene pictured seemed to be occurring at noon; now the tortured figures writhed and gestured in the shade of deep twilight."|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"
00:00|midnight|"The old sorcerer smiled. “Good! I’m glad your mind still has some stretch left in it. Finish that beer and come on. With any luck we’ll be back by midnight.” He stood up."|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"
12:00|noon|"When the stairs finally came to an end, widening out into a chamber whose walls and roof the lamp was powerless to illuminate, Duffy thought it must be dawn in Vienna, or even noon. And, he told himself grimly, there’s about a mile of tangled tunnels between you and your bed."|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"
00:00|midnight|"It was Easter morning, and the bells of St. Stephen’s rang solemnly joyful carillons out across the sunlit roofs of the city; another winter had been survived, and the several churches were filled with citizens celebrating the Vernal Equinox, the resurrection of the young God. At midnight all candles had been put out—even the tabernacle lights—and a new flame had been struck from the flint and steel in the cathedral vestibule and carried by altar boys to the other churches, in order to begin the new liturgical year with a renewed light."|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"
"ap 04:30"|"half past four"|"Bluto drained his glass and stood. “Say, Duff, it must be half past four now. When should I make sure to be here, to be at least among the first in line?”"|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"

“You start paying for it.”"|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"
"ap > 10:00"|"after ten"|"Bluto cut another notch in the candle’s rim and watched the hot wax spill down the side. “Anna,” he said. “Another cup of bock.”
“It’s after ten, you know.”
“I know.” The hunchback looked around the dining room. Most of the revellers had trickled back, but the room’s warmth had been let out, and the chilly air reeked of gunpowder—it was a more subdued crowd gulping the beer now."|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"At two in the morning the remainder of the crowd was sent home, and the lights were put out as the employees, having decided the clean-up could wait until the next morning, stumbled off to bed. Duffy took a walk out back, but all fires had been put out, his northmen snored peacefully in the stable and there was no evidence of smoldering bombs, so he went back inside."|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"
"< 12:00"|"just about noon"|"“Rain magic, hey?” Duffy peered up into the cloudless blue vault of the sky. “A likely day for it,” he observed. “Wait up.”
“Hurry. It’s just about noon right now.”
When he reached the water Aurelianus crouched down, and waved Duffy to be silent. He dipped a cupped hand into the water and sipped some of it, then rubbed the rest into the dirt. He opened the wooden chest—Duffy, peering over the old man’s shoulder, was distinctly disappointed to see the little raisin-wrinkled lumps it contained—and sprinkled a second handful of water over the stones. He closed the lid, stood up with the chest, and began to shake it rhythmically, whispering in a language Duffy was careful not to listen to."|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"
12:00|noon|"Aurelianus sat down heavily, letting his hands rest on the ground. “Ah,” he sighed after a minute of open-mouthed panting. “There are … many more powerful spirits, but these rain spirits certainly are among the most … engergetic.” He started to stand, then thought better of it. “And they demand a good deal of energy on the part of their conjurors, too.” He lifted his trembling hands and peered at them. “It must have been almost precisely noon when I started,” he said, “for them to have come through so quickly and easily. The last time I did this trick, several years ago, I had to shake the damned box for nearly half an hour.”"|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"
12:00|Noon|"Duffy watched the wooden chest bobbing slowly away downstream. “Noon?” he repeated absently. “What’s so special about noon?”"|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"

12:00|noon|"Aurelianus tried standing up again, and made it this time. “All these magics involve a breaking or violation of the natural laws,” he told Duffy, “and those laws relax just a little, are weakest, at noon and midnight.”"|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"

"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"There were curt nods from the four captains, and the hundred and fifty mercenary soldiers broke into a matched jogging trot forward. Duffy craned his neck as they rounded the southeast corner of the wall, but the only motion at the Turk position was a cloud of dust raised by the scattered shot. He could hear the bells of St. Stephen’s beginning to peal behind him—they were the church bells announcing one o’clock mass, not the strident, clanging alarum bells that would have warned of an attack. He sneaked a look over his shoulder a moment before the southernmost of the immobile knights receded out of sight around the high shoulder of the wall. We’re alone out here now, he thought, still breathing easily as he trotted across the ripped-up plain. I hope they follow quickly when we start shooting."|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"The Irishman wrung stronger chords from the instrument as the song neared its crest, and then, just as it did, the bells heralding eight o’clock mass began ringing in the tower of St. Stephen’s. The song reached crescendo gracefully, effortlessly taking in the pealing of the bells as accompaniment; and a moment later a deep, window-rattling bass was provided by rumbling cannon-fire from the city walls."|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"
12:00|midday|"“I’m not sure that gives me enough time,” replied Duffy with a grin. “I have to have drunk a huge quantity of beer to do it, and Suleiman’s likely to have the wall down by midday.”"|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"
12:00|midday|"The long hall to the western side of the inn was just as dark at midday as at night, and it took Duffy several minutes to grope his way through its length of varying height, width and flooring all the way to the two tall doors of the chapel. He had been hearing voices for the last hundred feet, and now saw that one of the iron doors was ajar."|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"
12:00|noon|"“No,” said the Irishman, recalling what had prompted him to leave five months ago. Then he remembered the harp-playing episode of the previous night, and he shrugged fatalistically. “Oh, why not,” he sighed. “I’m not really due back at the barracks till noon tomorrow. What time?”"|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"There was a man asleep on the stairs, and Duffy stepped carefully around him, reflecting that besieged towns probably tended to surrender sooner if there was no wine or beer inside to divert the defenders, now and then, from the bleakness of their position. He got to the top landing and found Aurelianus’ door, but just as he was about to knock he remembered that the old sorcerer had told him nine o’clock."|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"After closing his eyes for ten seconds, Aurelianus stared at him and shook his head. “Your years as a mercenary soldier have coarsened you, Brian, to the point where you’re unfit for gracious company. I was merely asking her if any of the maids had tried to come into my room recently; a new girl might not have been told that this room isn’t to be entered. And didn’t I say nine o’clock?”"|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"
"ap ~ 09:00"|"around nine"|"“I decided I might have to be heading back to the barracks at around nine. Why don’t you just lock your door?”"|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"
00:00|midnight|"Eilif regarded him narrowly, then grinned. “Why not? I’d probably sew your tongue to your cheek. And God knows we can’t leave you like this—you’d lose as much beer as you swallowed. In fact, you might be wise to catch a nap there, where there’s still a roof.” He pointed. “Their damned mine collapsed our barracks. Lucky most of us were outside. But I want you back here by midnight, understand? There will be a heavy watch kept here, and I’ll oversee our part of it until then.”"|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"At eleven the rain began to abate, and by noon the clouds were breaking up, letting a strained, pale sunlight play intermittently over the sundered section of wall. The gap was roughly two hundred feet wide, and the wall as it continued on either side—a surprising hundred-and-fifty feet thick in exposed cross-section—leaned dangerously outward. While sharpshooters with fresh loads hammered into their rifled guns watched the distant Turkish lines, hastily assembled gangs of soldiers and laborers built solid barricades in a straight line across the rubble-choked gap, and threw up a fifty-yard-radius semicircle of deep-moored open-frame wooden obstructions on the slope outside. Chalk dust was scattered thickly beyond the semicircle, most of it darkening into gray mud as it soaked up moisture from the wet ground."|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"

"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"Since he’d lit the snake just as the bells overhead had ceased their deafening, bone-jarring announcement of nine o’clock, and it was now nearly burned down to his fingers, Duffy deduced that it must be nearly time for him to brace himself for the one stroke of the half hour. He flipped the coal-tipped stub spinning out over the rail, and watched it draw random red arabesques as it tumbled toward the square far below; then he turned to the wizard who was crouched over the telescope. “Aren’t we about due for—” the Irishman began, but he was interrupted by the preludial mechanical grinding from above, so he closed his eyes and shoved his fingers in his ears until the single bong had been stuck, and the echoes were ringing away through the dark streets below."|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"
00:00|midnight|"They walked together, without speaking, until they came to the Tuchlauben; there Aurelianus turned north toward the Zimmermann Inn while Duffy continued on in the direction of the barracks and the gap, though it was still well short of midnight."|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"
"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"As Aurelianus had predicted, the Turkish troops were shifting around to face the eastern wall with its gap like a missing tooth in a stony jaw. Sentries crouched to lay their ears against the pavement, and many claimed to hear the digging of miners at several points north of the collapsed section of wall. There was sporadic trading of booming cannon-fire, but, aside from a particularly heavy burst of Turkish firing by the south wall at about noon, the cannonade was little more than a desultorily observed formality."|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"Duffy opened his eyes and crossed without a jolt from unremembered dreams into wakefulness. St. Stephen’s was tolling two, and the gray light that slanted in under the awning waxed and waned as the tattered clouds moved across the sun. He stood up and put on his boots, hauberk, doublet, and sword, pushed the curtain aside and stepped out into the street. A wine vendor was wheeling his cart past, and the Irishman called for a cup. The man’s young son trotted over with it and asked an exorbitant price, which Duffy paid after bestowing his fiercest frown on the unconcerned lad. His company wasn’t due to muster until three o’clock, so he took the wine—which proved to be sour—over to a corner where the tumbled wall of a warehouse wall formed a rough bench."|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"
"ap ~ 03:30"|"about three-thirty"|"Through the early afternoon the Turkish troops kept advancing and falling back, and losing hundreds of men in a vain effort to summon up the impetus that would break the desperate ranks of Europeans. Finally at about three-thirty they retreated, and the Viennese forces took turns standing in the gaps, trooping outside to construct advance defense positions, and marching back in for a brief respite in which to sit and drink wine and croak queries and braggadocio declarations at each other."|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"
"ap > 06:00"|"past six"|"Inside the wall the soldiers were gathering around a fire. “Hey, Duffy!” barked a tired, dust-streaked Eilif. “It’s past six, and Vertot’s crew will stand in the hole for a while. Come here and have a cup of mulled ale. You’re looking bashed-about.”"|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"
12:00|noon|"“He was trying to open that old ferrier’s door,” the captain answered. “The one that crazy man sneaked out through this noon. They bricked it up, but apparently nobody told old Redbeard; he was trying to pull the bricks loose when Rahn saw him.”"|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"
12:00|noon|"Aurelianus shook his head. “They work. Becky was the real thing. We have only one hook for hope. She was, as you say, a country witch, and her spells have a range of only about a mile.

If this beer-fouling trick of theirs works, then I believe they’ll have won even if we could physically retreat; and if it fails they’ll go home and the Dark will be drawn on schedule. Therefore I attach a lot of importance to the outcome of tonight’s venture.” His pose of calm rationality fell away for a moment and he banged the wet table top with a fist. “Alone, or even with a body of soldiers, you couldn’t go out and fight Ibrahim. For one thing, he’s got personal bodyguards, of the species you saw when we fetched the King into the city—oh, that’s right, Arthur had the reins in that fight, you wouldn’t remember them; but they’d be something like the two things that tried to hypnotize you back in April. Anyway, they’d laugh at your swords and guns—if they were the sort of creature that ever laughed.” Though clearly apprehensive, the pale sorcerer managed to smile. “It’s a big wager, but I don’t think we’ll ever have better odds. I have decided to break the deadlock.”"|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"
00:00|midnight|"“It won’t be quite that bad. Von Salm would never let me have any troops, of course, for an unexplainable midnight sortie, but he did say once that he’d be grateful if I’d take Bugge and the other northmen off his hands.”"|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"

"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"The Irishman heard the first notes of the bells of St. Stephen’s tolling eleven o’clock. “Look, Bluto,” he said urgently. “I have to go out there. A sorcerous attack is building up out there on the plain, and if I, and my party, aren’t out there when it starts, then things won’t go too well for Vienna. You must have seen enough in the last six months to know that magic is playing a part in this struggle. I swear to you, as your oldest friend, who once saved your life and who carries a certain obligation in trust, that I have to go. And I will. You can permit it or you can have him shoot me in the back.” He turned to Bugge and gestured toward the rope. The Viking stepped up into the crenel, seized the rope and leaned outward, walking down the outside of the wall."|"The Drawing of the Dark"|"Tim Powers"
