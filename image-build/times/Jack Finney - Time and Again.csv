"< 12:00"|"nearly noon"|"We walked north on Fifth Avenue past the incredible buildings of glass and steel, glass and enameled metal, glass and marble, and the older ones of more stone than glass. It’s a stunning street and unbelievable; I never get used to it, and I wonder if anyone really does. Is there any other place where an entire cloud bank can be completely reflected in the windows of one wall of only one building, and with room to spare? Today I especially enjoyed being out on Fifth, the temperature in the high 50’s, a nice late-fall coolness in the air. It was nearly noon, and beautiful girls came dancing out of every office building we passed, and I thought of how regrettable it was that I’d never know or even speak to most of them. The little bald man beside me said, “I’ll tell you what I’ve come to say to you; then I’ll listen to questions. Maybe I’ll even answer some. But everything I can really tell you I will have said before we reach Fifty-sixth Street. I’ve done this thirty-odd times now, and never figured out a good way to say it or even sound very sane while trying, so here goes."|"Time and Again"|"Jack Finney"

Yet at two-thirty Monday afternoon I finished the last of my “lovelier you” soap sketches, walked into Frank Dapp’s office, laid them on his desk, started to turn and leave, and instead my mouth opened, and I stood listening to myself give notice. I’d saved some money, I told Frank; now, before it was too late, I was going to take some time and see if I could make it as a serious artist. It was a lie, and yet something I’d often thought of. “You want to paint?” Frank said, leaning back in his chair."|"Time and Again"|"Jack Finney"

12:00|noon|"Outside, at the end of a short corridor, we climbed an enclosed flight of concrete fire stairs to a door that opened onto the roof. The morning rain had stopped, the sky was nearly clear again except for horizon clouds, and several girls and men were sitting out there in canvas chairs, their faces lifted to the sun. At the sound of our feet on the gravel as we stepped out onto the roof, they turned and spoke, and Danziger smiled and flicked his hand in a wave. The rooftop was immense; a city-block square of tar and gravel, ordinary enough except for scores of new skylights set into it, and a forest of stacks and vents. Ducking under rusting guy wires attached to the taller stacks, walking around an occasional puddle, we crossed to a glob of noon shade around the base of the wooden water tower. Danziger cut into his pie, and I stood looking around."|"Time and Again"|"Jack Finney"
00:00|midnight|"Then he looked at me again. “And that’s the purpose of all our constructions down on the Big Floor. They’re preparatory: temporary substitutes for the real sites because they’re either not available yet or not available for a long enough time. There aren’t many thousand-year-old buildings anywhere, for example, but one of them is Notre Dame cathedral in Paris. The actual site will be given to us for less than five hours, between midnight and dawn of one night only. Electricity and gas to be turned off on the Ile de Cité and along the Right and Left banks within eye range of the cathedral. And we’ll be allowed to stage-set the immediate area. It’s the best we could arrange—through the State Department—with the French government. They think it’s being done for a movie. We even prepared a full shooting script to show them; realistically bad, which I expect convinced them. No one in the project has a great deal of hope for this particular attempt; there will be only a matter of hours in which to make it, not nearly enough, I’m afraid. And it’s reaching a long way back; could anyone really achieve a sense of what it was like? I must doubt it, but still I have hope. We do the best we can, that’s all, with the sites we discover.”"|"Time and Again"|"Jack Finney"
18:00|"6:00 PM"|"I took the envelope. It bore a canceled three-cent green stamp bearing a profile of Washington in a design I’d never seen before, and the postmark circle read: “New York, N.Y., Main Post Office, Jan. 23, 1882, 6:00 PM.” Under this it was hand-addressed in black ink to “Andrew W. Carmody, Esq., 589 Fifth Avenue, City.” The lower right corner of the envelope was slightly charred as though it had been lighted and almost immediately put out. I turned it over—the back was blank—and Kate said, “Look inside.”"|"Time and Again"|"Jack Finney"

In black ink above the fold, in the same neat script as the address, was written: If a discussion of Court House Carrara should prove of interest to you, please appear in City Hall Park at half past twelve on Thursday next. In blue ink below the fold, in a large half-illegible scrawl, blot-stained in four places, it said: That the sending of this should cause the Destruction by Fire of the entire World (a word seemed to be missing here at the end of the top line where the paper was burned) seems well-nigh incredible. Yet it is so, and the Fault and the Guilt (another word missing in the burned area) mine, and can never be denied or escaped.

My hand on the key of the little green-shaded student lamp on the game table where our dominoes still lay, I waited for Kate to light the hall light.

"ap < 05:00"|"nearly five"|"“I know: I know what you mean.” I stood up, stooping to look ahead. I knew we must be approaching Forty-second Street and I was unconsciously looking for the landmark that would confirm it, the main library on the west corner just across Forty-second. Again a moment of utter disbelief, because of course it wasn’t there. Where it should have been stood what looked like the base of an enormous pyramid: tall blank walls slanting inward, running clear down to Forty-first Street on Fifth, and west on Forty-second out of sight. Martin had briefed me with pictures, and I knew what this was: the Croton Reservoir. But it was one more bewildering sight in a city completely familiar to me and now terribly different. The bus was edging toward the curb, I beckoned to Kate, and we got off directly in front of a two-wheeled hansom cab parked just short of the corner. I opened the cab door and helped Kate in. Settling down beside her, I glanced at her, and her head was back, her eyes closed. The driver sat in the rear on a high seat where he could look over the top, and now I heard a sound overhead, and looked up to see a panel slide back and reveal a small open square in the roof. Framed in it a moment later, I saw one eye, half of the other, a nose red with cold, and the beginnings of a large and drooping mustache. “The main post office,” I said; then I got out my watch, pressed the stud, and the lid sprang back to reveal the face. It was nearly five. “Can you do it in half an hour?”"|"Time and Again"|"Jack Finney"

Kate laid her head back on the hard tufted-leather upholstery, and I did, too, watching the telegraph wires, which had appeared as soon as we turned into Broadway, angle endlessly across the top of my window. I didn’t sit up or look out again till Chambers Street. Then, a block ahead on Kate’s side, I looked out and saw City Hall, and it was so good to see something familiar that I dragged out my watch; it was five twenty, there was time to walk, and I rapped on the roof."|"Time and Again"|"Jack Finney"

Filling my vision now, here he came heading across the great tiled floor directly for us, and his hairy right hand held the long slim robin’s-egg-blue envelope. His stubby, flat-topped plug hat hung jauntily on the back of his head; and his unbuttoned overcoat, swept behind him by the speed of his walk, exposed the long curve of his belly shoved belligerently forward. His chin was lifted, thrusting his stiff beard almost horizontally outward as though he were defying the world, and a corner of his mouth gripped a cigar butt, lifting his lip so that he appeared to be snarling."|"Time and Again"|"Jack Finney"

I looked through a Playboy, a copy of the U.S. Infantry Journal, and I walked out once and down the corridor to the cafeteria for a Coke I didn’t want. Rube’s girl came in twice, wanting to know, of course, what it had been like, really like, and once again I did my damnedest to find the words that would convey it.

Don’t ever blow them out; turn the flame off.”"|"Time and Again"|"Jack Finney"

It was a mail delivery at very nearly seven in the evening, and when I said I was surprised, Julia answered with a touch of big-city smugness that mail was delivered five times a day in New York City. “Byron,” she said then, “will you favor us with some magic?” He nodded, took the stairs to his room two at a time, came back down just as fast, then walked around the room pulling coins from our ears, and asking people to “pick a card, any one at all.” The truth is that he was pretty good, and everyone, including me, actually enjoyed the performance."|"Time and Again"|"Jack Finney"

Just one more day; half a day! I was saying to myself. For only those few hours I could certainly retreat to the role of observer only, couldn’t I? Lifting my hand into the faint light reflected up to my window from the snow outside, I looked at it, then compared it with the other, my hands side by side. The right hand was puffy, and all four finger knucklebones ached steadily. Staring at my hand, I flexed it slowly, then tried closing it into a fist. I couldn’t do it, but as it began to close, an involuntary picture popped up in my mind in which that fist was punching Pickering in the mouth."|"Time and Again"|"Jack Finney"

Instead, I turned away from the window, unbuttoning my shirt—it buttoned only partway down, the lower part being a single wide shirttail—undressed, and got into my nightgown. Lying in bed, I smiled; it had been quite a day.

At most it provided the relief of empty space from the miles all around it of narrow corridor-streets between high building walls. It didn’t seem to have much other meaning or purpose: a drab and pleasureless place."|"Time and Again"|"Jack Finney"
"ap 01:00"|one|"I liked the street; it was varied, interesting to the eye. The entrances to some of the buildings were four or five steps above street level, the wide flights of stairs often separated by a brass railing into incoming and outgoing sections. Generally there’d be more offices or a barbershop or restaurant or something in the basement section, half below street level, the stairway down to it protected by black iron guard railings with a row of points along the street-level railing to keep loafers from sitting on them. The buildings were constructed from every possible material; there was plenty of brick and wood; there were some whose entire fronts were of cast iron, often as high as three or four stories; there were marble and granite, brownstone, wood, and even stucco. And they were of mixed periods; between newer four- and five-story stone office buildings I passed a lot of small, modest houses of an obviously earlier time, with old-fashioned dormer windows in the upper stories, but the lower stories turned into shops with plate-glass display windows. At one such display window eight or ten men were standing, and I joined them. A girl, looking very prim and a little embarrassed, and never glancing at us, sat demonstrating a typewriter. It was a strange-looking contraption, high and almost completely open, exposing its works, and decorated here and there with gilt-and-red arabesques. Stuck to the window with little dabs of paste were samples of her work, praising the machine, its speed, and its superiority to handwriting. We all watched till she finished what she was doing, a short, sample business letter. Then she stuck that to the window and began a new sample. A man beside me said, “They’ll be all the go soon; you watch.” But I shook my head and said, “No, they’ll never catch on; they lack the personal touch,” and he looked thoughtful."|"Time and Again"|"Jack Finney"

I’d seen the source of the sound just down the street: it was an old friend, Trinity Church, its chimes clear in the winter air, and I hurried along to it. Then, a couple of dozen steps past the church, my back against a telegraph pole out of the stream of pedestrians, I made a quick reference-sketch which I finished up much later. I’d sketched Trinity before, but this time, incredibly, its tower rose black against the sky, higher than anything else in sight. I finished, making notes in the margins for the final job, stood looking at it, and a messenger boy in a brass-buttoned blue uniform stopped for a moment, looked at my sketch, nodded at me, and walked on. This is the finished sketch and it is absolutely accurate except that I added leaves to show the fine old trees more clearly. This is the Broadway I walked along—in the middle distance at the left you can see the Western Union Building and the time ball which had just dropped to the base of the pole a few minutes before."|"Time and Again"|"Jack Finney"
12:24|"TWENTY-FOUR MINUTES past noon"|"AT TWENTY-FOUR MINUTES past noon, standing at a first-floor rear window of the post office, I stood looking across the street to the north at the little wintertime park and the people moving along its crisscrossing paths, and the strangeness of what I was doing took hold of me. Staring out that soot-dirtied window, I was remembering the note I’d seen in Kate’s apartment, the paper yellowing at the edges, its once-black ink rusted with time. And the meeting in this park, arranged by that note, became an ancient event, decades old and long since forgotten."|"Time and Again"|"Jack Finney"
"ap 00:35"|"twelve thirty-five"|"Five minutes more passed; the City Hall clock across the park said twelve thirty-five. And when I looked down from the clock the second man was well inside the park walking swiftly toward its center from the west. And I knew that the fleck of blue in his gloved hand (the event was no longer ancient; a chill moved along my spine at knowing that here I stood watching it begin) was the envelope I’d seen Pickering mail, held in the other man’s hand now as a symbol of recognition."|"Time and Again"|"Jack Finney"
00:00|midnight|"There was a sudden change in the location of Pickering’s voice; he’d stood up, I realized, probably turning to face Carmody. “I am very far from ignorant of financial matters, whatever you may think. You will need, certainly, several business days to raise the required sum. This is Thursday, and I am giving you through Monday, two and a half business days. Three, counting Saturday morning. Come back Monday night. Here. To this very bench. At midnight, Mr. Carmody, when the park and the streets of this area are deserted; I intend to be certain no one follows us. Be here with the money in a satchel or I’ll expose you. I won’t wait even an hour. Within that time I will be in the offices of the Times”—there was a moment’s pause and I imagined he was nodding toward the building across the street—“with my documents.”"|"Time and Again"|"Jack Finney"

He smiled when I looked up at him, and nodded a quick polite approval, but his eyes were worried, and I knew why. I was worried, too—that Jake Pickering would come in and raise hell once again, and it was no part of my mission here to make trouble.

Their faces were animated, they were glad to be just where they were, alive in that moment and place. It showed in the faces of the people I saw in Madison Square. You could look at their eyes as they passed and see the pleasure they felt at being outdoors, in the winter, in a city they liked. And the men of lower Broadway hurrying along the walks, conscious of time and money, stopping at noon to check the precision of their big watches with Western Union’s red time-ball—well, their faces were often abstracted; some were worried; some were greedy or anxious, others complacent and going-to-live-forever. All sorts of expressions just as today, but they were also interested in their surroundings, pausing to check the temperature at Hudnut’s giant thermometer. And above all, they carried with them a sense of purpose. You could see that: They weren’t bored, for God’s sake! Just looking at them, I’m convinced that those men moved through their lives in unquestioned certainty that there was a reason for being.

I’m glad Ira didn’t.” She lifted the note again, and read the portion below the fold. “ ‘That the sending of this should cause the Destruction by Fire of the entire World’—oh, what’s the missing word!—‘seems well-nigh incredible.

Nothing could keep me from being there too, and I felt I knew intuitively that I was finally going to know what the note in the blue envelope meant. “. . . the Destruction by Fire of the entire World. . . .” The words were senseless, they didn’t mean anything, only—they did: On a day far in the future Andrew Carmody would put a bullet through his head because of them."|"Time and Again"|"Jack Finney"

For a moment I stood motionless on the walk. How could I have missed it?

"< 12:00"|"nearly noon"|"It was nearly noon, I was hungry, and I saw a saloon a dozen steps down Twenty-third Street. I went in, and it looked exactly the way I thought it ought to: a long bar and brass rail, an ornate mirrored back bar, and a table at the rear filled with food. There were stacks of bread, sliced meat—including ham, chicken, turkey, wild duck, and roast beef—potato salad, a big glass bowl filled with dozens of hard-boiled eggs, and pickles, relish, horseradish, mustard, and I know I’ve missed plenty of other things: sliced pickled beets, for one. It was all free with a five-cent stein of beer, which I ordered, and which tasted different from today’s beer. There was much more taste to it, of malt or hops, I think, I’m not sure which. Sipping the beer, I stood eating all the lunch I could manage, and I read a big oak-framed sign over the back bar: gilt letters against a black background on a shiny mirrorlike glass surface. It read:"|"Time and Again"|"Jack Finney"

A little after ten—his mind, I was certain, filled with what was about to happen—Jake couldn’t stand it anymore: he said an abrupt good-night to Julia, who was sitting at the dining-room table now, mending a towel, and went upstairs. Maud went up to her room a few minutes later, and within another five minutes—this was an early-rising household—Byron and Felix, who’d been sitting in the parlor matching pennies, had gone up, too. Aunt Ada came in from the kitchen, and when I heard her in the hall locking the front door, there was nothing left for me to do but say good-night, too, and go on up to my room.

It was Jake’s office, the only room lighted in the entire dark face of the old building. Ten minutes later it lowered, flickered redly for a moment, then was out."|"Time and Again"|"Jack Finney"
"ap - 23:49"|"ten or eleven minutes to twelve"|"Julia’s arm was under mine, and I felt it tighten. To herself she murmured, “He’s leaving,” and I nodded in the darkness. There was a three-quarter moon out, very high in the sky, but we stood far back, deep in the complete darkness of the doorway. I pictured Jake . . . locking his office door now . . . walking down the short hall in the faint light from outside, perhaps using a match, though I could see no light. Down the stairs then, a hand on the banister. And now, just about now, he’d be turning to walk through the long hall the length of the building toward Park Row and City Hall Park. Crossing the street toward it, he’d glance up at the City Hall clock; it would say ten or eleven minutes to twelve. Perhaps far across the park in the moonlight Carmody, too, would be entering it, a heavy satchel at the end of one arm."|"Time and Again"|"Jack Finney"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"But I suppose there were three or four thousand, maybe as many as five thousand sheets in the two-foot depth of that wooden file-cabinet drawer.

Pickering said, “I’ve waited so that you could see for yourself; it will take you hours to search through that one cabinet alone, and there are thirteen of them all together, an unlucky number for you.”"|"Time and Again"|"Jack Finney"

My legs were terribly stiff, and I had to reach quickly across Julia to the wall beside her and steady myself. Then, very slowly and completely silently, I stretched every muscle—arms, legs, back, neck—counting the slow bongs; it was four o’clock. I stepped to the doorway, and found a crack to peek through. Jake was asleep, head on his chest, snoring very faintly. Carmody still sat on the edge of the desk, but now his upper body lay along the length of the file drawer on the desk top before him: the top drawer, I saw, of the second cabinet. He slept silently; I had to watch closely to see the tiny motion of the back of his vest. I assume most people are tempted—at least the impulse stirs—to occasionally commit the outlandishly impossible: to whistle in church, to say something wildly inappropriate to a situation. It popped up in my mind to yell “Boo!” as loudly as I could, and then watch the wild scramble in the next room. I smiled, and sat down beside Julia, and knew she was awake, I’m not sure how."|"Time and Again"|"Jack Finney"

The wreckage looked centuries old, an ancient ruin, and the dark shapes of the firemen were motionless, the only movement the play of the water arching through the empty windows. Higher up, the walls were touched by the diffused sourceless light that so often accompanies a nighttime snowfall; and we stared up at the smoke-blackened OBSERVER sign along which we’d crawled, and just beyond it on the face of the Times Building the sign of J.
