"> 19:00"|"just after seven p.m."|"On the outskirts of the city, he stopped at the edge of a deserted lake Irina had previously scoped out, into which he rolled the two suitcases containing the remains of the real Captain Vanov. They disappeared in tiny bursts of bubbles, like a child playing underwater. Then he dried off his feet and shins, pulled on his socks, rolled down his trousers, and laced up his shoes. He drove back into the city, arriving just after seven p.m. at the Meisterstuck Hotel in Stresemannallee. He entered as Maksim Vanov, cultural attaché."|"The Bourne Enigma"|"Eric van Lustbader"
09:00|"nine this morning"|"Korsolov snorted again, but lifted a hand as if in salute. “As long as you’re at your desk at nine this morning, knock yourself out.”"|"The Bourne Enigma"|"Eric van Lustbader"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"Korsolov nodded dolefully; half a glass was better than an empty one. “The Makarov was probably bought locally on the black market.” He ran his forefinger down the pages as if he were scanning them. But at the moment he had no patience for words, so he was grateful for the verbal summary. Not that he would tell the courier that.

She was barefoot, which meant she was staying at his hotel or the behemoth next to it."|"The Bourne Enigma"|"Eric van Lustbader"
00:00|midnight|"She stared at him. One moment her large eyes were midnight-blue, the next they were pure black—a trick, he was sure, of the indirect lights from the hotel restaurant terraces. All at once, she jumped up, her magnificent legs vanishing beneath her dress. He rose with her. They stood side by side, not quite touching, gazing out over the sea."|"The Bourne Enigma"|"Eric van Lustbader"
