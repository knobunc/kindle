"ap ~ 11:00"|"around eleven"|"The next morning, at around eleven, she was standing with cold feet on the Athabasca Glacier,

  confronting Nature again. The bus, heading south toward Lake Louise, had made a planned stop. The

  Columbia Icefields, trapped in a bowl of peaks along the Continental Divide, pushed outwards

  through the mountain passes broad glacial arms, of which the Athabasca was the handiest to the

  highway. Fat-wheeled big vehicles, driven by youngsters and called Snocoaches, took tourists down

  a precipice—“the steepest grade drivable,” the boy’s miked voice claimed—onto the ice. Alexandra

  and her fellow-tourists dutifully extracted their bulks from their seats and clambered down,

  expecting something wondrous. She was prepared for a world of inhuman purity, but the glacier was

  as grimy as a city street, only harder to stand on. It was dirty, and pitted, and hollowed. It

  gurgled beneath its slick skin. Though summer was over, melting was still in progress, and made

  footing treacherous. She didn’t know much about being an old lady—just think, every second you

  live, you have never been this old before—but knew that she shouldn’t break a hip. Years ago she

  had seen a male taxi dancer interviewed on television and he had said, of his customers, “Once

  they fall and break a hip, they come back to the dance hall all right, for the company, for the

  memories; but the dears don’t ever dance again.” Not that she had done much dancing with Jim—just

  a weekend square dance now and then, when they were new to their marriage and game for most

  anything. She had liked the patterning, the weaving in and out and the flickering quick touch of

  other hands as in a sabbat orgy, but the New Mexico women with their bouffant hairdos and

  twirling, ballooning skirts and the men in their two-tone boots and bolo ties threaded through

  jade or turquoise slides, frowning in their concentration on the voice of the caller twanging

  above the fiddles, came to disgust her. They were bankers and feed merchants disguised as

  cowhands; they exuded the glossy falsity of the bourgeoisie at play. And Jim’s game leg would

  complain for days afterwards. So they gave up square dances. Giving things up agreed with

  Alexandra—appealed to her inner witch. There was so much unnecessary and superfluous clutter

  connected with living. Living itself, all that eating and propagating, was a study in

  superfluity. A cancer."|"The Widows of Eastwick"|"John Updike"
"ap 05:30"|five-thirty|"But, betraying him, she asked the desk to call her room at five-thirty. The shrill ring

  shattered a dream she was having, about Eastwick—a misty morning, sea fog beaded in the window

  screens, the children off at school, she trying to do housework but tensely expecting Joe Marino

  to come calling. In the dream he had brought her a present of a chicken, a live chicken but

  wrapped, in stiff pink-striped wrapping paper. She had to thank him but was secretly appalled;

  what could she do with a chicken? Even if she could bear to wring its neck she didn’t know how to

  pluck its feathers. What was dear Joe thinking of? His ridiculous middle-class guilt lay behind

  this. Why can’t men just fuck you and not bother with useless presents? The bird’s angry eye,

  above its collar of wrapping paper, transfixed her. A scraping, terrible noise came from its

  throat: the telephone shrilling with her wake-up call. This was her chance, the day that has

  been given thee. Alexandra would never see Lake Louise again."|"The Widows of Eastwick"|"John Updike"

  the base, and then the gondola ascended. At the top, there were souvenirs and snacks and warm air

  inside and, outside, cold air and viewing telescopes that accepted Canadian dollar coins, called

  “loonies” for the waterfowl on them, on the side opposite from the profile of an aging queen.

  Two-dollar coins were called “toonies.” Alexandra wondered why the United States couldn’t come up

  with a dollar coin that people would use. The Canadians made it look so easy, such fun. American

  men hated to have heavy pockets, she supposed; they’re afraid of being dragged down. They love

  freedom."|"The Widows of Eastwick"|"John Updike"
12:00|noon|"Dear, dear Lexa:


    


    Jane, whom I’ve seen a fair amount of since the sad event I will describe in a minute, has been

    after me to phone you, but it’s been so long since we’ve been in touch obviously I’ve felt shy.

    The kind of closeness the three of us had in East-wick depends really on being there every day,

    and bumping into one another by accident on Dock Street where you could spontaneously say

    “Let’s duck into Nemo’s for a cup of coffee,” and having children in the same local schools

    with the same teachers to bitch to each other about, and all experiencing the same wretched

    weather and the same tedious cocktail parties, and hearing without even knowing you’re hearing

    it the same town fire siren go off at every noon, cutting the day in two, and sharing the same

    sense of cozy isolation, Boston and New York way over the horizon in different directions and

    Providence though closer always somehow, maybe because of the repulsive religious name, a place

    you stayed away from.


    


    Connecticut turned out not to be like that. The towns are closer together, though not crammed

    together so one runs right into the next as in northern New Jersey—that is really

    repulsive—and have a more monied look (I hate to write it, it sounds so snobby), even the

    sections where the handymen and babysitters live. There aren’t any of those delicious lost

    corners, marshy waste spaces with abandoned duck blinds and rotting striped mattresses somebody

    dumped, that you find in Rhode Island, small as it is. The dumps, speaking of dumps, are

    terribly well organized for recycling—paper in one Dumpster and glass in another and

    colored glass in a third and cans in a fourth, all of it arranged so you just drive up and drop

    your nicely sorted trash down from above—and even the woods they set aside as natural Nature

    places seem weeded, with the fallen timber taken away and the underbrush cleared so they have

    that carpeted look of English beech woods in those movies about Robin Hood that even we could

    see as credulous children were Hollywood sets. The little downtowns all have uniform antique

    signage (love that word, like “dotage”) and the school grounds and children’s playgrounds are

    tended right to the edges. For that wasteland look you have to go to Bridgeport, which nobody

    does. As you may remember I came from upstate New York where everything had the look of not

    belonging to this century, by which I mean of course the century that’s dead and gone by now,

    the good old twentieth. Upstate was all nineteenth. When Lennie Mitchell brought me down here

    to live I couldn’t believe how self-conscious everything was, everybody facing New York City in

    their minds, even in Stamford when it was just Greenwich’s poor cousin, before all the

    companies getting away from city taxes opened branches here and put up one blue glass

    skyscraper after another, almost as bad as Hartford. Our section, on the edge closest to the

    Merritt, hasn’t been too affected yet—that “our” is a slip, Lennie’s and mine, I must get a

    grip. I’ve started to sniffle and get that raw-throat feeling, thinking about him. But the

    thing about all these suburbs is that having such a big city, the big city as far as

    the U.S. is concerned, keeps us on our toes and at the same time is rather demoralizing,

    because we don’t quite live there, we just live in its aura, so to speak. The

    restaurants and shops and beauty parlors aren’t quite up to Manhattan standards but they

    try, and even all those who don’t commute in and out, the local tradesmen and so on,

    share a certain New York attitude, chip on the shoulder and gritting it out and

    standing tall and so on, like I imagine the English when they had an Empire and then the Blitz.

    But people don’t know each other the way they did in Eastwick; they come and go,

    moving to more upscale houses or towns, and everybody terribly competitive underneath,

    measuring each other by the standards of New York. It was a lesson to me and I couldn’t have

    had the success with my writing that I have had living anywhere else. My agent lives right next

    door in South Norwalk and without him I’d be still doing small-town gossip columns, except all

    those little local newspapers are dying off, killed by blogs and e-mails, and in a strange way

    there aren’t any small towns any more, just malls and commercial strips and assisted-living

    developments between them, and there isn’t even gossip any more, the way there was

    when everybody was more sexually repressed. I think repression was the key to the kind of

    energy people used to have, we weren’t burnt-out the way people are in their twenties now, all

    this hooking up the young people do. Now don’t I sound prudish? And you know I’m not.


    


    My news, in case you’re wondering why I’m writing after all these years, is that Lennie died

    two months ago, quite suddenly, and Jane thought you should know. She’s come back into my life

    almost as if she foresaw it coming. But how could she have?—he was in lovely health, never fat,

    always active, and gave up smoking about the time I met him, while I stupidly puffed on, though

    mostly only at parties and when trying to write, so they tell me my lung function is less than

    fifty percent. He still liked to do the organized dancing when we went to Florida for January,

    and tennis, just doubles, and jogged on the town paths (the local town boards plan for

    everything) and played squash and paddleball all winter. He dropped over in a squash

    court after making what the other man in there with him said was a marvellous retrieve. Just

    dropped there, against this wall full of dirty ball marks, and even though the other man was a

    doctor he was a gynecologist and couldn’t even do resuscitation properly. By the time the

    paramedics came Lennie was quite gone. After eight minutes, they told me, there’s bound to be

    brain damage, and I wouldn’t have wanted to live with that. I suppose so but I wish they had

    let me decide. I still didn’t like hearing it from them after the fact and can’t help resenting

    that Lennie’s so-called friend, being an M.D. with a cell phone right on him, didn’t get help

    sooner. The squash courts are in the sub-basement of a big brassy new corporate building and

    hard to find if you haven’t been there before.


    


    Jane and I have been back-and-forthing a bit lately—I drive up more to her house than she to

    mine. Her ancient mother-in-law is rather a dear, though Jane thinks the old lady ruined her

    marriage to Nat Tinker. She also thinks it would do me good in my grief if I took a trip with

    her. With the two of you, ideally, if the trip to Egypt with just Jane Pain didn’t do you in.

    It sounds terribly dry and educational and brave with all those Muslims giving you dirty looks

    for not wearing a veil, but I don’t see how you stood all that death the Egyptians dwelt on.

    Those long deep passageways, I doubt I could have stood it and don’t know how you did, being

    such an outdoors person. Jane said you rode a camel and got a sunburn on the boat where she got

    a great tan. I don’t know how many steps you had to climb but I can’t do many with my

    emphysema. Steps were where I first noticed that I wasn’t my girlish self any more. If we ever

    were to go anywhere together—and I’m not sure it’s a good idea, maybe we all had our

    fun in life —I think it should be China. It seemed everybody we knew socially in Stamford had

    been to China but when I’d suggest it Lennie would say he’d rather go have a Chinese meal and

    pay for it and leave. He didn’t like Communists even if we had won the Cold War, as if

    everybody didn’t know that the Chinese are only Communists in name anymore. I picture it as a

    wide-open sort of place, with a big sky and huge open city squares and people eating noodles in

    the little alleys. The hutongs, aren’t they called? I’ve had a romantic thing about

    China ever since seeing Ingrid Bergman in that movie about leading a pack of children to safety

    in some kind of an inn. Of the sixth happiness, it just came to me. Think about it, dearest.

    Jane will be in touch with you also. She seems to want to devour the whole world before she

    leaves it, or else she just wants to stay away from her mother-in-law, who ancient or not

    doesn’t miss much. She has Jane’s number, is my impression when we talk (the old lady and I)

    briefly.


    


    About widowhood, what can I tell you? You’ve been through it. I still keep expecting Lennie to

    come home at night and when he doesn’t it’s like he’s willfully refusing or up to some mischief

    and it makes me mad. I’m free of course of a lot of annoying male habits and

    laziness—the kitchen floor over by the toaster doesn’t have English-muffin crumbs all over it,

    for instance—but what good is freedom if nobody’s watching you have it? Lennie was a salesman

    and a wife can get tired of being sold things she doesn’t want much. For instance, he had to

    have this ski place in southern Vermont though once the children began to rebel at being herded

    into the station wagon every weekend we hardly ever used it, and as the mountain lost

    cachet—they do, you know, just like restaurants—real-estate values went way down. For another

    instance, he bought me one of these fashionable new stoves with smooth black tops and the

    burners under it just barely visible, so I kept burning myself and setting vegetables in the

    wrong place where they stayed raw. As his computer business picked up again what with so many

    companies coming out from NYC to Stamford, he bought me a heavyweight navy-blue BMW because

    when he met me I was still driving that gray Corvair with the top you pulled down and locked by

    hand. I loved that car, remember? Like sitting in a bathtub going all over town with my hair

    streaming behind me and Hank (my beautiful Weimaraner, remember?) sitting up in the front seat

    beside me with his ears flattened pink inside out. Lennie thought the Corvair was tinny and

    unsafe for me to be driving. The BMW, which I still have, always feels to me like a man’s

    fantasy car—it has this phallic stick shift on the floor I’m always jamming into the wrong

    gear, and it rides so you feel every bump on the road. That was manly right there. At first in

    Stamford—not exactly Stamford but a village on the northern edge called Rocky Ridge—I had a

    comfy old red Taurus that I just loved, its trunk took a week’s worth of groceries plus a golf

    bag. But Lennie had to buy me that expensive BMW, just to let people know we had money again.

    And he would make me buy flashy clothes—a “fun fur” that made me look like a stupid puffball,

    and backless party dresses that would give me a cold for weeks. The reason, it turned out, was

    that his girlfriend at the office, who kept getting younger of course, one after another, wore

    clothes like that. Once, we turned up at the same business party on his boss’s lawn in Old

    Greenwich in the same exact clingy silk print, with a sash instead of a belt. We hugged each

    other at the end, it was so humiliating. He would sell me his affairs, too, after I discovered

    them, convincing me they were my fault. But that push of his, that salesman’s constant

    aggravating engaging push—it’s gone, dear Lexa. The way the dead vanish is almost

    enough to make you believe they go somewhere else. Going from room to room in our useless

    oversize house here I feel like that girl in the palace where the Beast never shows himself.

    That silence in the hour he used to pull into the driveway—do you ever get used to it? I’m so

    glad you met him that time in Manhattan at the Roosevelt Grill, in case I ever forget that he

    really existed or come to believe he was a perfect saint.


    


    Now that I have a little distance on him I can see he was a lot like Monty—a spiffy dresser and

    a male chauvinist. Sexual attraction keeps making the same mistakes. But less sardonic—he never

    made me feel stupid the way Monty sometimes tried to do. But, then, I was so young, just

    twenty, when I married him (Monty). The children have taken his death (Lennie’s) rather too

    much in stride, it seems to me. But why not, they’re all middle-aged, even little Bob, our one

    joint product (Lennie and me), on top of the three I brought with me from Monty. To the

    children his death is just part of Nature’s natural cycle, but to me it’s the end of my life of

    being important to anybody.


    


    Give me a call if you can’t be bothered to write. I know it’s more work for most people than it

    is for me. The trouble with these word processors is it’s too easy to go and on, and once

    they’ve perfected voice recognition and transcription, won’t that be a horror of sheer

    unhampered babble?— just the way the world used to be when it was all tribes and shamans and

    oral literature. I’d love to come visit you in sunny Taos but where I used to freckle

    charmingly I now get a hideous blotchy sun rash. O the joys of these sunset years! Does the sun

    ever shine in China? I hope not. You never see shadows in the scenes on their teapots and

    room-divider screens, I know that.

  single room, leaving the other two to share a second room. Jane’s wish to be alone made Alexandra

  wonder if she also had snored; it was a disconcerting thought. Jim had never complained, but,

  having dared the touch, into the relative cool there, by the moistened trays of supermarket

00:00|midnight|"Jane and Sukie were late. It was nearing six. Alexandra nibbled at the crackers and

  cheese—pumpkin-colored Gouda and moon-white Münster—that she had driven all the way, in Nat

  Tinker’s antique Jaguar, to the Stop & Shop to buy, along with some ready-made chicken curry

  and chopped broccoli salad for them to eat afterwards, if they weren’t too exhausted or

  transported to eat. Sabbats classically occurred at midnight, but, with so many young Wiccans in

  the workforce filling nine-to-five jobs, that tradition had been adjusted, and surely didn’t

  apply to women over a certain age. For wine, Alexandra had chosen Carlo Rossi Chianti in a

  two-liter screw-top glass jug, to be poured into mock-copper chalices, encrusted with embossed

  and painted jewels, which she had spotted on a back shelf of one of the town’s candle shops. They

  were made of foil-covered paper and weighed almost nothing in her fingers. Her hands, she thought

  as she toyed with an empty chalice, had held up pretty well under time’s battering. A little

  plumpness helps keep the skin taut as we get older. Jane’s hands, she had noticed, were

  repulsively emaciated and veined, their arthritic joints shiny with painful swelling, and even

  Sukie’s—dear Sukie, who carried herself as if still a contender in the lists of love—looked ropey

  then picturesque Old Wick, a collection of Federalist houses clustered, as if to seek protection

  from their inexorable deterioration, around a rambling crossroads inn under brave new management,

  sporting fresh white paint, croquet wickets and lawn chairs on the lawn, and a grouted signboard

  promising in golden letters FINE DINING; then came East-wick, and outer Orchard Road, and the

  crasser commercial note of the Stop & Shop in its struggling mall, a scatter of unappealing

  stores—picture frames, videos, health foods—inadequate to the vast, presumptuous imposition of

  asphalt on acres of land that can never grow sweet corn, potatoes, or strawberries again. The

  Unitarian church, with its squat octagonal tower topped by a copper weathervane of a cantering

  horse and top-hatted rider, appeared on the left, and on the right glimpses of saltwater—a

  luminous bile color—flickered between the trees, beyond the breakwater’s rusty boulders. The

  backyards of Oak Street materialized, with their swing sets and beached dories. The blue marble

  horse trough lay ahead, sporting its tiny forest. Alexandra’s weary heart quickened among the

  familiar shop fronts and clapboarded houses from earlier centuries; she had lived here, fully

  lived, with children and a husband and lovers and friends, although the plod of duties and

  errands and monthly bills to pay had in part concealed from her the bliss of those departed days.

  Here, now, the long daylight of June and July was giving way to August’s gradual closing-down. It

  was after seven o’clock, dinnertime, and already the lamps behind the house windows seemed to

  burn from deeper within, more intensely. Long shadows crossed Dock Street from curb to curb. A

  more determined summertime mood animated the teen-agers in their scanty pale clothes; they

  clustered and chattered along the stretch of storefronts, under the spindly trees wound with

  white Christmas lights, a little more loudly, more defiantly, squeezing the last allotments of

  fun from the strengthening dusk. Along Oak and Vane Streets, older citizens and visitors moved

  singly or in couples with a deliberate, self-conscious leisure on the dark Victorian lawns and

  the sidewalks, whose daytime pattern of shade was, when the streetlamps came on, abruptly recast

  shuffled bewildered through the living room in the hours after midnight. The music, smudged with

  static, tumbled out—the deep-voiced stride piano, the soaring clarinet, the rousing cornet, the

  drums romping through the insistent brass beat of the high-hat cymbal, each instrument, with a

  courtesy from an older era, taking its solo turn and then sinking back, to a spatter of applause,

  clock-radio, which was still rustling with immortal jazz. The red numbers said 8:47 when he

  finally left. His thanks and farewell were those of a portly, deep-voiced gentleman, but his

  pale-blue eyes had the glaze of a befuddled youth."|"The Widows of Eastwick"|"John Updike"
