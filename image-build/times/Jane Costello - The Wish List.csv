"ap 08:26"|08.26|"The flicker of a red LED drags my attention to the bedside table, where a solitary item sits entirely out of place: an Alessi alarm clock, straight out of the design pages in GQ. It
  reads 08.26."|"The Wish List"|"Jane Costello"
03:30|"three thirty in the morning"|"‘I’ve got a bed all to myself – with lovely white sheets, no small child and no prospect of being woken at three thirty in the morning with a request to watch Toy

03:00|"three in the morning"|"‘It’s three in the morning!’ protests Cally as my sister grabs my arm, ends the call, and places the phone firmly back on my lap."|"The Wish List"|"Jane Costello"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"By ten o’clock, the office is a hive of activity. Raj, our producer, is downing Natracalm like Smarties – but still looks like his head is about to explode when he glances at the
  pile of schedules on his desk. Jo, the assistant producer, is firing instructions to James, an animator, who’s scribbling as if the end of his pen is on fire; Harry, our editor, is splicing
  together scenes; Jill, the administrator, is dishing out mail, and everyone is more creatively fired-up (and frantic) than you’d think possible for a Monday morning. The only exception is
  Jez, the music producer, who doesn’t do frantic – even when Raj pushes his feet off the desk, grabs him by the shoulders and screams: ‘Don’t you understand the word
  deadline?’"|"The Wish List"|"Jane Costello"
11:30|"eleven thirty that day"|"He turned up at our office at eleven thirty that day like the Diet Coke man, leaving the womenfolk of the parish so overcome with lust most of us could barely walk straight. He and I got
  chatting in the lobby as I was leaving to grab some lunch – then carried on as we realised we were both heading into the city centre. He asked me if I would join him for lunch and, two Pret
  sandwiches and a couple of lattes later, our relationship had begun."|"The Wish List"|"Jane Costello"

14:00|"two p.m."|"Giles’s knickers have been in a terrible twist over the issue of Sarah’s replacement – and the fact that Perry is showing no urgency to appoint anyone. Nevertheless, he’s
  slightly calmer today for a reason I can’t put my finger on, but it could be something to do with him consuming only twelve cups of coffee by two p.m. instead of the usual fifteen."|"The Wish List"|"Jane Costello"
07:45|"quarter to eight this morning"|"I haven’t produced a jot of work since I sat in this seat at a quarter to eight this morning, having arrived early to try to make up for the work I failed to produce yesterday."|"The Wish List"|"Jane Costello"
00:00|midnight|"The wait is interminable, but my mind is occupied in flipping between several issues. First, Asha: who was at my flat until midnight last night trying, between frenzied sobs, to get hold of Toby
  to confess her mistake. He was at a black-tie event – with Christina – and simply reassured her to leave it with him. She was unreassured."|"The Wish List"|"Jane Costello"

07:05|"7.05 a.m."|"Chapter 22

  Despite my determination to have a restorative lie-in, I wake the next morning at 7.05 a.m. with an odd combination of grogginess and agitation. I throw off the covers, slip on

"ap < 11:00"|"nearly eleven"|"It’s nearly eleven when I go to the loo and take out my phone. Rob has had a habit of texting me when I’ve been out lately and I get a twinge of concern that he hasn’t tonight.

"ap ~ 00:30"|"About 12.30"|"Okay, it’s not Tolstoy, but it’s important to get these things right. I tell myself that if he’s talking about Saturday night then that has serious implications. Saturday night

Saturday lunchtime okay? About 12.30?
"|"The Wish List"|"Jane Costello"
"ap 00:30"|"twelve thirty"|"Matt knocks on my door at twelve thirty and my heart is racing as I open it. The phenomenon is instantly exacerbated when I see what he’s wearing: a black shirt. I should stress that this
  does not beat the Sexiest Shirt Known To Man. Nothing beats that. But it’s rolled up his arms to display the outline of toned biceps and undone at the top to reveal a tanned, muscular chest,
  and a terrible thought hits me: Emma Reiss, do you want this to be a date?"|"The Wish List"|"Jane Costello"
"ap 05:10"|"ten past five"|"We finally receive a call from Perry – in response to my thirty or so messages – at ten past five. His massage has clearly had an effect similar to that of inhaling a potent strain

"ap 08:30"|"eight thirty"|"The journey from Liverpool takes an hour, which means leaving at eight thirty on a Sunday morning. Getting up this early at the weekend feels deeply unnatural to Giles and me, but not to Cally

02:00|"two in the morning"|"Disloyal as it feels to say it, I’ll confess to some concerns about unleashing Giles on Matt and Cally, who’s only ever been introduced to him fleetingly, and years ago –
  usually when our respective work nights out ended up colliding (messily) at two in the morning. It’s not that Cally doesn’t get on with everyone, nor indeed that I suspect the same of
  Matt."|"The Wish List"|"Jane Costello"
"ap ~ 06:30"|"gone six thirty"|"By the time I’ve showered, pulled on jeans and a T-shirt and made it over to Rob’s, it’s gone six thirty. He’s made a delicious roast dinner for me, as

"ap 09:28"|9.28|"He’s normally the first in to work and the last to leave, an obsessive perfectionist who would never contemplate submitting a script that wasn’t honed and polished until you could

"ap 00:45"|12.45|"I slip away before most of the others have left, unable to face the tearful farewells, and bump into Giles on the way out – he’s apparently on his way to Cally’s. Given that

  emergency."|"The Wish List"|"Jane Costello"
09:00|"nine a.m."|"Despite it being nine a.m. when we leave Reykjavik, the city is in darkness and will remain so for some time. It’s snowing heavily – and horizontally; the roads are treacherous and

23:45|"quarter to midnight"|"So we get on a bus, with fifty or so others all dressed in clothing comparable in thickness to a Sealy mattress, and we drive. And drive. Then we get out and look at the sky. But they’re

"ap 10:15"|"ten fifteen"|"But I’m not. I’m a trainee interior designer. And not only do I now have nothing to interior design, I also have nothing to put my bum on while I’m not doing it. Even when I

"ap > 08:00"|"just after eight"|"At just after eight, my doorbell rings and it’s Matt again. It’s been nearly twenty-four hours since I saw him. Neither of us needs to say anything. We simply stumble backwards into

  could be the reason."|"The Wish List"|"Jane Costello"
23:15|"11.15 p.m."|"Matt gets round to texting me at 11.15 p.m. I feel a tingle of indignation. I mean, I could be in bed, blissfully asleep, only to be unnecessarily roused by a man who has

06:00|"six in the morning"|"Chapter 75

  I’ve been meaning to write and send my birthday party invitations for weeks. But I hadn’t counted on doing it at six in the morning, after only twenty minutes of

  of A Few Good Men."|"The Wish List"|"Jane Costello"
