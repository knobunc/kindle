14:00|"2 p.m."|"To cut a long story short, my driver and I spent exactly twenty-four hours covering the thirty-two miles which separate the district town of Grachyovka from Muryovo hospital. Indeed so nearly exactly twenty-four hours that it was uncanny: at 2 p.m. on 16 September 1916 we were at the last corn-chandler’s store on the outskirts of the remarkable town of Grachyovka, and at five past two on 17 September of that same unforgettable year 1916, I was in the Muryovo hospital yard, standing on trampled, withered grass, flattened by the September rain. My legs were ossified with cold, so much so that as I stood there bemused, I mentally leafed through the textbook pages in an inane attempt to remember whether there was such a complaint as ossification of the muscles or whether it was an illness I had dreamed up while asleep the night before in the village of Grabilovka. What the devil was it in Latin? Every single muscle ached unbearably, like toothache. There is nothing I can say about my toes—they lay immobile in my boots, as rigid as wooden stumps. I confess that in a burst of cowardice I pronounced a whispered curse on the medical profession and on the application form I had handed in five years earlier to the rector of the university. All the time a fine rain was drizzling down as through a sieve. My coat had swelled like a sponge. I vainly tried to grasp my suitcase with the fingers of my right hand, but in the end spat on the wet grass in disgust. My fingers were incapable of gripping anything. It was then, stuffed as I was with all sorts of knowledge from fascinating medical books, that I suddenly remembered the name of the illness—palsy. ‘Paralysis’, I said to myself in despair, God knows why."|"A Country Doctor's Notebook"|"Mikhail Bulgakov"

07:00|"seven in the morning"|"‘Next time, I’ll wear a sheepskin coat,’ I said to myself in angry desperation, tugging at the suitcase by its straps with my inflexible hands. ‘I’ll … though next time it’ll be mid-October, I’ll have to wear two sheepskin coats. I certainly shan’t be going to Grachyovka for a month yet. Just think … I actually had to put up for the night en route! When we had only driven fifteen miles and it was as black as the tomb … it was night … we had to stop in Grabilovka, a school teacher put us up. This morning we set off at seven in the morning, and here we are … God, it’s been slower driving here than if we’d come on foot. One wheel got stuck in a ditch, the other swung up into the air, my case fell on to my feet with a crash, we slithered from side to side, lurching forward one moment, backward the next. And all the time a fine rain drizzling down and my bones turning to ice. Who’d believe you can freeze as easily in the middle of a grey, miserable September as in the depth of winter? Ah well, it seems you can. And as you die a slow death there’s nothing to look at except the same endless monotony. On the right the bare, undulating fields and on the left a stunted copse, flanked by five or six grey, dilapidated shacks. Not a living soul in them, it seems, and not a sound to be heard.’"|"A Country Doctor's Notebook"|"Mikhail Bulgakov"
23:00|"eleven o’clock that night"|"Once I fell asleep. I remember that night perfectly—it was 29 November, and I was woken by someone banging on the door. Five minutes later I was pulling on my trousers, my eyes glued imploringly to those sacred books on operative surgery. I could hear the creaking of sleigh-runners in the yard—my ears had become unusually sensitive. The case turned out to be, if anything, even more terrifying than a hernia or a transverse foetus. At eleven o’clock that night a little girl was brought to the Muryovo hospital. The nurse said tonelessly to me:"|"A Country Doctor's Notebook"|"Mikhail Bulgakov"
09:00|"nine in the morning"|"I never saw her again. Gradually I forgot about her. Meanwhile my practice still grew. The day came when I had a hundred and ten patients.

00:00|midnight|"We are cut off; the nearest kerosene lanterns are seven miles away at the railway station, and even their flickering light has probably been blown out by the snowstorm. The midnight express to Moscow rushes moaning past and does not even stop; it has no need of this forlorn little halt, buried in snow—except perhaps when the line is blocked by drifts."|"A Country Doctor's Notebook"|"Mikhail Bulgakov"
"ap 00:00"|"twelve o’clock"|"‘Every day at twelve o’clock my head starts to ache, then I seem to get hot all over … It makes me shiver for a couple of hours or so and then it goes.’"|"A Country Doctor's Notebook"|"Mikhail Bulgakov"

Here is an exception for you—a literate, intelligent miller!’"|"A Country Doctor's Notebook"|"Mikhail Bulgakov"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"‘Wha-at? Dying? How can he be dying?’ For an instant, until I found my slippers, my bare feet felt the chill of the floor. I broke several matches and spent a long time poking them at the wick until it lit with a blue flame. The clock showed exactly six o’clock."|"A Country Doctor's Notebook"|"Mikhail Bulgakov"
00:00|midnight|"‘Just imagine, doctor—he swallowed all ten doses of quinine at once! At midnight.’"|"A Country Doctor's Notebook"|"Mikhail Bulgakov"
"ap 11:30"|"Half past eleven"|"‘All right, go and tell them I’m coming at once!’ I shouted as I got out of bed. Aksinya’s footsteps shuffled away from the door and the bolt grated again. Sleep vanished in a moment. Hurriedly, with shaking fingers, I lit the lamp and began dressing. Half past eleven … What could be wrong with this woman who was having a difficult birth? Malpresentation? Narrow pelvis? Or perhaps something worse. I might even have to use forceps. Should I send her straight into town? Out of the question! A fine doctor he is, they’ll all say. In any case, I have no right to do that. No, I really must do it myself. But do what? God alone knows. It would be disastrous if I lost my head—I might disgrace myself in front of the midwives. Anyway, I must have a look first; no point in getting worried prematurely …"|"A Country Doctor's Notebook"|"Mikhail Bulgakov"
"ap > 01:00"|"after one o’clock"|"It was after one o’clock when I went back to my room. In a pool of light on the desk in my study lay Döderlein open at the page headed ‘Dangers of Version’. For another hour after that, sipping my cooling tea, I sat over it, turning the pages. And an interesting thing happened: all the previously obscure passages became entirely comprehensible, as though they had been flooded with light; and there, at night, under the lamplight in the depth of the countryside I realised what real knowledge was."|"A Country Doctor's Notebook"|"Mikhail Bulgakov"
"ap 08:20"|"eight hours and twenty minutes"|"I had acquired such fame after amputating the leg of the girl who fell into a flax-brake that I almost expired under the burden of my reputation. Every day a hundred peasants would drive up the sleigh track to attend my surgery. I stopped having lunch. Arithmetic is a cruel science: assuming that I spent no more than five minutes on each patient … five!… then five hundred minutes equals eight hours and twenty minutes—without a break, please note. Apart from that I had a ward for forty inpatients. And I also did operations."|"A Country Doctor's Notebook"|"Mikhail Bulgakov"
21:00|"nine o’clock in the evening"|"In short, when I left the hospital at nine o’clock in the evening I had no desire to eat, drink or sleep. My only wish was for no one to call me out to a confinement. And in two weeks I was dragged out at night along that sleigh track five times."|"A Country Doctor's Notebook"|"Mikhail Bulgakov"
21:00|"nine o’clock in the evening"|"On Tuesday there were not a hundred but a hundred and eleven out-patients. I finished my surgery at nine o’clock in the evening and fell asleep trying to guess how many there would be on Wednesday. I dreamed that nine hundred people came."|"A Country Doctor's Notebook"|"Mikhail Bulgakov"

"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"The blizzard moaned through a copse, then lashed out, whistling, as we drove past the shelter of the trees. I felt I was swaying, swaying, swaying … until I found myself in the changing-room of Sandunov’s steam baths in Moscow—fully dressed, wearing my fur coat, and bathed in sweat. Then a torch flared up, the baths filled with cold water, I opened my eyes and saw a helmet shimmering in a blood-red glow. I thought there was a fire … then I blinked and realised that we had arrived. I was outside a white colonnaded building in the neo-classical style of Nicholas I. All around was pitch darkness, I was surrounded by firemen and a flame was flickering above their heads. There-upon I dragged out my watch through a chink in my fur coat: it was five o’clock. The drive had taken not one hour but two and a half."|"A Country Doctor's Notebook"|"Mikhail Bulgakov"
"~ 15:00"|"about three o’clock in the afternoon"|"Breathing the scent of April borne in from the dark plough-land, I listened to the rooks cawing in the tops of the birch trees, squinted in the spring sunlight and walked across the courtyard to complete my shave. That was about three o’clock in the afternoon. I finished shaving at nine o’clock that night. At Muryovo surprises like childbirth in the bushes, I have observed, never come singly. No sooner had I grasped the door handle on my porch then a horse’s muzzle appeared in the main gateway and a heavily mud-spattered cart rumbled in behind it. It was driven by a peasant woman, who shouted in a thin voice:"|"A Country Doctor's Notebook"|"Mikhail Bulgakov"

Ah, yes, I’m lying in my bed … Why are they waking me up? They’re allowed to because I’m on call tonight. Wake up, Doctor Bomgard. Maria has just shuffled across the lobby to open the door.

So if I am to record the progress of my disease, here it is: I inject myself with morphine twice every twenty-four hours—at five o’clock in the afternoon (after supper) and at midnight before going to bed.
