Skeptical but intrigued, well-placed scientists at London’s Royal Society and at Cambridge University, and Yale’s Russell Chittenden undertook follow-up studies, with mixed conclusions. In 1904, thirteen lads of the Hospital Corps Detachment of the U.S. Army were taken away from their nursing duties for six months to serve as guinea pigs in a test of Fletcher and Chittenden’s low-calorie, low-protein, super-mastication regimen. Here there was no strapping lad in knickers and feathered felt hat to do the weighing and tidying up. The men’s work began at 6:45 A.M. with an hour and a half of “duties about the quarters, such as . . . assisting in measurement of urine and faeces and transportation of the same to the laboratory; cleansing of faeces cans and urine bottles, etc.”"|Gulp|"Mary Roach"

09:00|"9 o’clock A.M."|"More than anything else, the story of Beaumont and St. Martin is one of obsession. Here was a man who devoted his adult life and more than a thousand dollars of his own money to the study of gastric fluids. Here was a man willing, in the name of science, to taste chymified chicken from another man’s stomach (“bland and sweet”). A man who became, as his biographer Jesse Myer put it, “so deeply engrossed in his subject that it was difficult for him to understand why everyone could not feel the same interest.” Beaumont was crushed by the lackluster sales of his book, Experiments and Observations on the Gastric Juice, and the Physiology of Digestion, in the United States and the bald disinterest from British publishers. (“I have returned Beaumont’s Experiments, as I do not feel inclined to make an offer for it,” read one rejection letter in its chilly entirety.) Among the William Beaumont Papers at Becker Medical Library are letters from the doctor to the secretary of the navy and the secretary of war, urging them to purchase a hundred copies of his book. (The navy man, a bit of a softie, bought twelve.) Beaumont had friends in high places, and he sent every single one a signed copy. Picture Martin Van Buren, then the vice president of the United States, leaning back in his magnificent leather-upholstered desk chair and opening Beaumont’s book at random and reading, “At 9 o’clock A.M., I put a solid piece of rib bone, of an old hog, into a vial . . . of pure gastric juice, taken from the stomach this morning.” Ambassadors, chief justices, senators, and representatives, all were forced to take time away from their weighty lives to pen thank-you notes for a book on stomach secretions.

"ap 06:58"|"Two of seven"|"* In 1973, inquisitive cold researchers from the University of Virginia School of Medicine investigated “the frequency of exposure of nasal . . . mucosa to contact with the finger under natural conditions”—plainly said, how frequently people pick their nose. Under the guise of jotting notes, an observer sat at the front of a hospital ampitheater during grand rounds. Over the course of seven 30- to 50-minute observation periods, a group of 124 physicians and medical students picked their collective noses twenty-nine times. Adult Sunday school students were observed to pick at a slightly lower rate, not because religious people have better manners than medical personnel, but, the researchers speculated, because their chairs were arranged in a circle. In a separate phase of the study, the researchers contaminated the picking finger of seven subjects with cold virus particles and then had them pick their nose. Two of seven came down with colds. In case you needed a reason to stop picking your nose."|Gulp|"Mary Roach"

The woman wheeled into the emergency room of the Royal Liverpool Hospital at 4 A.M. on an unspecified date in 1984 was an exception. She turned out to be carrying a meal. As dinners go, this was triplets: two pounds of kidneys, one and a third pounds of liver, a half pound of steak, two eggs, a pound of cheese, a half pound of mushrooms, two pounds of carrots, a head of cauliflower, two large slices of bread, ten peaches, four pears, two apples, four bananas, two pounds each of plums and grapes, and two glasses of milk. Nineteen pounds of food. Though her stomach eventually ruptured and she died of sepsis, the organ heroically held out for several hours.

Some have turned to what a researcher in one Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology paper called “self-administered home fecal transplantation.” Though seven of seven C. diff sufferers were cured by self- or “family-administered” transplants using a drugstore enema kit, it doesn’t always go well. One woman who recently e-mailed Khoruts for advice didn’t follow directions. She put tap water in the blender, and the chlorine killed the bacteria. Another in-home transplant replaced one source of diarrhea with another: fecal parasites contracted from the donor.
