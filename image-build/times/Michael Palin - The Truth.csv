"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"He gave a short reply, short because he was unable to express how frustrating it had been writing the book, knowing that every manager on the site was breathing down his neck. O’Connolly made his apologies and left shortly afterwards, giving Mabbut a powerful handshake – he was not the sort of man for a bear-hug. The atmosphere relaxed. The food was good and, knowing that the company was paying, those who stayed moved from beer to wine and even some curious Indian digestif that Rani produced from a back cupboard. Mabbut fell into a long conversation with Laurie from Accounts, who had lived on the island all her life and was desperate to get away and see the world. She’d never been to London, and no matter what Mabbut told her about it, she still wanted to go. As the evening wore on, those who lived out of Lerwick bade their farewells and began to drift off. Soon only Mabbut, Roscoe Gunn and Mae Lennox were left. Roscoe was a dour man on whom alcohol appeared to have no effect at all. He was, however, that even more deadly combination, a dour man who likes company, and it was long past midnight before he shook Mabbut’s hand one final time and headed off into the night. Mabbut waited for Mae Lennox to settle up. As they stepped out on to Bank Lane the sky was wonderfully clear and a small crescent moon hung so sharp and bright above the bay that neither felt they could turn their backs on it. Instead they walked down towards the waterfront, where the outline of a recently docked Norwegian three-master rose against the night sky. They turned south along Commercial Street, whose solid and sturdy old manses ran parallel to the sea, which lapped gently at the flights of stone steps leading from the houses to the water."|"The Truth"|"Michael Palin"

"ap 10:00"|ten|"Not wanting to go back to the hotel, he had retraced his journey along the road as far as Brae, a village grown into a small town as a result of its proximity to the terminal. Oil money, skilfully extracted from the companies by a dogged council, had provided a new school and a leisure centre that a town twenty times its size would have been proud of. An area of bright new Scandinavian-style homes, nicknamed Toytown by the locals, had advanced up the hillside. New restaurants and shops had opened to service them. The previous winter Mae had rented one of them for Keith, so he’d be closer to the terminal on those days when the sun sank at three and didn’t reappear until ten the next morning."|"The Truth"|"Michael Palin"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"He’d intended to spend the evening clearing emails, clearing the desk, clearing NorthOil out of his system, so that at nine o’clock the next morning he could enter his new life with seamless ease. But as he turned to climb the stairs he found himself paralysed by a sudden shock-wave of self-pity: because of Krystyna, who he was about to lose, and Mae, who he would never see again. And Jay, who’d found another man. It was a short, sharp feeling of abandonment which paralleled some distant memory. Of people walking away from him, and the fear that they would never come back. The sensation was painful enough to make him grab the banister rail and hang on to it for quite some time. When it had passed Mabbut steadied himself, breathed deeply and made his way carefully back to the sitting room. Here he picked up a half-drunk bottle of red wine and the remote control for the television and sank heavily into the sofa with a long and heartfelt sigh."|"The Truth"|"Michael Palin"
"> 08:00"|"just after eight in the morning"|"When Mabbut awoke, light was coming through the curtains. He lay for a while, wondering what it was about this room and this woman that seemed so necessary to him. He concluded that it was because he could walk away and come back whenever he wanted. There were no expectations and therefore no consequences. And no lies. He dozed briefly until his mobile sounded. The first bars of Beethoven’s Fifth jangled beside him. It was just after eight in the morning."|"The Truth"|"Michael Palin"
"< 14:00"|"nearly two o’clock that afternoon"|"It was nearly two o’clock that afternoon when Mabbut turned off the Edgware Road and, checking his daughter’s message one final time, searched for the name Harveh in a row of cafés and shops brimming with sweets and pastries. Outside some were tables where shorthaired, broad-shouldered men sat playing draughts and smoking narghiles. He spotted the slim incongruous figure of his daughter, waving to him, almost silhouetted by the bright lights of a cafés’ interior."|"The Truth"|"Michael Palin"
"ap 07:30"|"seven thirty"|"Mabbut felt assailed and confused. After the oddly disquieting chat with young Shiraj he wanted time and space to think. The last thing he needed was a return to Urgent’s bleak and spiritless office and the hard sell from Latham and Silla.
‘He’ll meet us at seven thirty. OK?’
Mabbut took a deep breath."|"The Truth"|"Michael Palin"
"ap 02:30"|2.30|"The alarm clock showed 2.30 when Mabbut finally gave up the struggle to sleep and, pulling on the dressing gown Krystyna had given him for the last birthday they’d spent together, he sat down at his computer to plot a guerrilla strategy."|"The Truth"|"Michael Palin"

‘Yes, and I must tell my wife I’ve arrived safely,’ he lied again."|"The Truth"|"Michael Palin"
"ap 03:30"|"half-past three"|"The night was so hot when Mabbut returned to his room that he was forced to activate the air con, whose convulsive thumps and shudders brought him a semblance of cool air at the cost of some dreadful dreams. He was stumbling through a forest, falling to the ground and being dragged onwards by some unseen force when the grating cry of a cockerel plucked him from the nightmare. He groped for his travel clock on the floor by the bed. Indignation was added to discomfort when the clock told him that it was half-past three. The cock sounded again, just below the window, then a dog barked and another dog answered from farther away, a donkey shrieked, and soon a whole arrhythmic animal chorus filled the night. Mabbut lay staring at the barely revolving fan, unable to recapture any of the elation of the day before. His mind was full of negatives. Melville was gone and Mabbut was clearly being told, in as many words, not even to think of following him."|"The Truth"|"Michael Palin"

14:00|"two in the afternoon"|"It was two in the afternoon when he awoke. The inside of the tent was womb-like and powerfully hot. He looked twice at his travel clock, then lay back staring for a while at the peak of the tent. The first thing that struck him was that there was a peak at all, making the tent feel more like a tepee. And no polyester or aluminium ribbing here – this was a proper canvas tent, awakening childhood memories of campsites and fruit gums."|"The Truth"|"Michael Palin"

"ap > 03:00"|"shortly after three"|"When they parted, shortly after three, Mabbut felt lost. He crossed Tottenham Court Road. There were buses and trains that would have taken him home, but instead he followed a vaguely northerly route, walking through the back streets around the university and the big sober squares south of Euston station. Something was nagging at him and he needed time to pin it down. The fact was that beneath the elation of having completed the book there was an element, quite a strong element, of fear. Fear that deep down nothing in his life had changed. That these last few months had merely been a happy aberration before normal service resumed."|"The Truth"|"Michael Palin"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"‘This, if you must know, is my first,’ Mabbut protested. ‘Since four o’clock, that is. And the strange sound you can hear in my voice is happiness. And when I think of happiness I think of you.’"|"The Truth"|"Michael Palin"
"ap 07:45"|"quarter to eight"|"A short, sharp buzzing noise woke Mabbut from some rambling dream. He opened his eyes and squinted at the clock. It was a quarter to eight.

He pulled himself up on to one elbow and picked it up."|"The Truth"|"Michael Palin"

It being a Saturday there was no one on the gate, but there was notification of an emergency number to ring. By the time the barrier had been raised and the rising kerbs lowered, a further five minutes had elapsed. Hector dropped them off at a side door which led into the glass and marble reception area, empty save for an Asian man wearing purple overalls who was making slow, sweeping passes over the marble floor with a rotary polisher. Ron, looking fresh and sharp in navy polo shirt and jeans, called down to them from the gallery above."|"The Truth"|"Michael Palin"
"ap 04:30"|"half-past four"|"Mabbut stared at the computer screen. He was left with an adulterous affair and an illegitimate child, and given what passed for sensation these days it was pretty thin stuff. He could quite easily feed this into the text, but would it be enough to get Latham off his back? He set to work that night and by half-past four had come up with something that felt right. He would revisit it in the morning and, all being well, send Latham the relevant pages over the weekend. Then, hopefully, the whole thing could be put to bed and he could get back to Albana."|"The Truth"|"Michael Palin"

There was a note from Ursula saying that his room and dinner had been paid for and suggesting they meet at the clinic at 9.30 the next morning. The hotel seemed to have been hijacked by a noisy Russian wedding party, so Mabbut ignored the free meal and walked down into the centre of town. Everywhere was busy, but he found a freshly vacated table outside the Café Alefant, and despite repeated attempts from the waiter to get him inside he tenaciously clung on to it. For the next couple of hours he watched the noisy throng of tourists passing by, and ordered white wine spritzers to keep the waiter happy."|"The Truth"|"Michael Palin"

Two of them contained micro-cassette tapes. In the third, a longer envelope, was a letter. The same old Foreign Office heading, smartly struck through with a red pen.
