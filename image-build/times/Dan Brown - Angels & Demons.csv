"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"Langdon flushed slightly. He was accustomed to having to defend his timepiece. The collector’s edition Mickey Mouse watch had been a childhood gift from his parents. Despite the contorted foolishness of Mickey’s outstretched arms designating the hour, it was the only watch Langdon had ever worn. Waterproof and glow-in-the-dark, it was perfect for swimming laps or walking unlit college paths at night. When Langdon’s students questioned his fashion sense, he told them he wore Mickey as a daily reminder to stay young at heart.
‘It’s six o’clock,’ he said.
Vittoria nodded, eyes still closed. ‘I think our ride’s here.’"|"Angels & Demons"|"Dan Brown"
19:00|"7 p.m."|"Following tradition, the cardinals gathered here two hours before conclave to catch up with friends and engage in last-minute discussion. At 7 p.m., the late Pope’s chamberlain would arrive, give opening prayer, and then leave. Then the Swiss Guard would seal the doors and lock all the cardinals inside. It was then that the oldest and most secretive political ritual in the world would begin. The cardinals would not be released until they decided who among them would be the next Pope."|"Angels & Demons"|"Dan Brown"

00:00|Midnight|"The operator gripped his mug and wondered how long tonight would last. Midnight or so, he guessed. Nowadays, most insiders already knew who was favored to become Pope well before conclave convened, so the process was more of a three- or four-hour ritual than an actual election. Of course, last-minute dissension in the ranks could prolong the ceremony through dawn . . . or beyond. The conclave of 1831 had lasted fifty-four days. Not tonight, he told himself; rumor was this conclave would be a ‘smoke-watch.’"|"Angels & Demons"|"Dan Brown"

Still he knew if the killer were inside, the man could leave through any door he wanted, making a one-gun outside stakeout totally fruitless. Catching him inside was the only way . . . that was, if he was even still here. Langdon felt guilt-ridden over the blunder that had cost everyone their chance at the Pantheon.

How will he get a cardinal through all these people and kill him in plain view? Langdon checked his Mickey Mouse watch. It was 8.54 p.m. Six minutes."|"Angels & Demons"|"Dan Brown"

He had been suffocated and branded with the ambigrammatic word “Earth.” Cardinal Lamassé was murdered in St Peter’s Square ten minutes ago. He died of perforations to the chest.
