12:00|noonday|"The enemy paused. The command scurried along the interminable front rank: “Stop shooting!” Here and there a ramrod still clattered, here and there a shot rang out, belated and lonesome. The blue-gray fog between the fronts lifted slightly. All at once, they were in the noonday warmth of the cloudy, silvery, thundery sun. Now, between the lieutenant and the backs of the soldiers, the Kaiser appeared with two staff officers. He held a field glass supplied by one of his escorts and was about to place it on his eyes. Trotta knew what that meant: even assuming that the enemy was retreating, the rear guard must still be facing the Austrians, and anyone raising binoculars was marking himself as a worthy target. And this was the young Kaiser! Trotta’s heart was in his throat. Terror at the inconceivable, immeasurable catastrophe that would destroy Trotta, the regiment, the army, the state, the entire world drove burning chills through his body. His knees quaked. And the eternal grudge of the subaltern frontline officer against the high-ranking staff officers, who haven’t the foggiest sense of bitter reality, dictated the action that indelibly stamped the lieutenant’s name on the history of his regiment. Both his hands reached toward the monarch’s shoulders in order to push him down. The lieutenant probably grabbed too hard; the Kaiser promptly fell. His escorts hurled themselves upon the falling man. That same instant, a shot bored through the lieutenant’s left shoulder, the very shot meant for the Kaiser’s heart. As the emperor rose, the lieutenant sank. Along the entire front, a tangled and irregular rattling awoke from the terrified guns, which had been startled from their slumber. The Kaiser, impatiently urged by his escorts to leave this perilous zone, nevertheless leaned over the prostrate lieutenant and, mindful of his imperial duty, asked the unconscious man, who could hear nothing, what his name was. A regimental surgeon, an ambulance orderly, and two stretcher bearers came galloping over, backs bent, heads stooped. The staff officers first yanked the Kaiser down and then threw themselves on the ground. “Here—the lieutenant!” the Kaiser shouted up at the breathless medic."|"The Radetzky March"|"Joseph Roth"

By six-fifteen the district captain’s chin lay smooth and powdered between the slightly silver pinions of his whiskers. His bald skull had already been massaged and slightly reddened by a few drops of cologne that had been rubbed in, and all superfluous hair—some sprouting from the nostrils, some from the ear conches or even on the back of the neck, welling over the high stand-up collar—had been removed without a trace. Then the district captain reached for the light-colored cane and the gray silk hat and headed toward the municipal park. He wore a white high-necked waistcoat with gray buttons and a dove-gray morning coat. The narrow creaseless trousers were fastened by dark-gray straps to the narrow pointed boots, untipped and seamless and made of the softest kidskin."|"The Radetzky March"|"Joseph Roth"

"ap 08:05"|"five minutes after eight"|"One morning in May, Herr von Trotta returned from his constitutional at five minutes after eight. The mailman must have come long since. Herr von Trotta sat down at the table in the breakfast room. The egg, soft-boiled as usual, was in its silver cup. The honey shimmered golden, the fresh kaiser rolls smelled of fire and yeast, the butter shone yellow, embedded in a gigantic dark-green leaf, the coffee steamed in the gold-rimmed porcelain. Nothing was missing. Or at least it seemed to Herr von Trotta at first glance that nothing was missing. But then he promptly stood up, put down his napkin, and scrutinized the table again. The letters were missing from their usual place. For as long as the district captain could remember, no day had ever passed without official mail. First Herr von Trotta went to the open window as if to convince himself that the world still existed outside. Yes, the old chestnut trees in the city park still wore their dense green crowns. The invisible birds were making their usual morning racket in the foliage. The milk wagon, which normally drew up at his residence around this time, stood there today, nonchalant, as if this were a day like any other. So nothing has changed outside, the district captain determined. Was it possible that there had been no mail? Was it possible that Jacques had forgotten it? Herr von Trotta shook the handbell. Its silvery peal scurried through the silent house. No one came. The district captain did not touch his breakfast for now. He shook the bell once more. Finally there was a knock. He was amazed, startled, and offended upon seeing his housekeeper, Fräulein Hirschwitz, enter."|"The Radetzky March"|"Joseph Roth"

Big Spanish flies stuck motionless to the window, and the canary had stopped twittering and was pecking on some sugar.

The district captain went into the dining room"|"The Radetzky March"|"Joseph Roth"
00:00|midnight|"THE DISTRICT CAPTAIN decided to visit his son in the remote border garrison. For a man like Herr von Trotta, this was no easy undertaking. He had unusual notions about the eastern border of the monarchy. Because of embarrassing lapses in duty, two of his schoolmates had been transferred to that distant crownland, at whose edges the Siberian wind could probably be heard howling. The civilized Austrian was menaced there by bears and wolves and even more dreadful monsters, such as lice and bedbugs. The Ruthenian peasants made sacrifices to pagan gods, and the Jews raged cruelly against other people’s property. Herr von Trotta took along his old revolver. He was not the least bit terrified of adventure; indeed, he experienced that intoxication he had felt in his long-buried boyhood—the excitement that had driven him and his friend Moser to go hunting in the mysterious wooded depths of his father’s estate and to visit the graveyard at midnight."|"The Radetzky March"|"Joseph Roth"

Even the “house spirits,” those invisible familiars that Captain Wagner could sense wherever people gambled, that he sometimes inaudibly conversed with—and even then in a gobbledygook he had concocted over the years—today those ghosts were chock-full of sheer benevolence for Wagner.

He remained. Around 3 P.M., the first players showed up. Captain Wagner began to tremble. What if Trotta stood him up and didn’t bring the money until tomorrow? By then his luck could desert him. A man might never again have such a good day! The gods were in a fine mood, and it was a Thursday. But Friday! Appealing to luck on a Friday was like expecting a medical officer to drill a company. The more time passed, the more grimly Captain Wagner thought about the tardy Lieutenant Trotta. He wasn’t coming, the young scoundrel!

Even though the “seditious disturbances” were not expected until noon, Lieutenant Trotta marched out by eight hundred hours, along the wide dusty highway. Behind the neat, systematic rifle stacks, which looked both peaceful and dangerous, the soldiers lay, stood, and wandered. The larks blared, the crickets chirped, the mosquitoes hummed. In the remote fields, they could see the colorful, radiant kerchiefs of the peasant women. They were singing. And sometimes the soldiers who were natives of this area responded with the same songs. They would have known what to do in those fields, but they did not understand what they were waiting for here. Had the war begun already? Were they going to the this afternoon?"|"The Radetzky March"|"Joseph Roth"

The lieutenant realized that these were the workers who were supposed to assemble outside the factory at noon. They all fell silent when he entered, jingling and fearsomely girded. He halted at the counter. Slowly, all too slowly, the tavern keeper fiddled around with bottle and glasses. Behind Trotta’s back the hush towered, a massif of silence. He drained his glass at one gulp. He sensed that they were all waiting for him to leave. He would have liked to tell them that it wasn’t his fault. But he was incapable of speaking to them or leaving immediately. He did not want to appear timorous, so he had several more drinks in a row. The men were still hushed. Perhaps they were making signs behind his back. He did not turn around.

And the undaunted champion of the honor of the Trottas forced his way into Hasselbrunner’s presence. Here at last he found a faint glint of hope. They drove from person to person, Hasselbrunner and old Herr von Trotta. Their goal was to forge all the way to Montenuovo.

For the fifteenth time that day the district captain was told that his plan was impossible. But he remained unshakable. And the silvery dignity of his years and the slightly bizarre and somewhat crazy determination with which he spoke about his son and the danger threatening his name, the solemnity with which he called his forgotten father “the Hero of Solferino” and nothing else, with which he called the Kaiser “His Majesty” and nothing else—all these things struck such deep chords in the listeners that they gradually found Herr von Trotta’s plan to be perfectly fair and natural."|"The Radetzky March"|"Joseph Roth"

Then he switched out the lights in the room. He rang the bell by the door. He sent for the barber. He slipped off his coat. He sat down. He had himself shaved. “Twice,” he told the groggy young man, “and against the grain!” Now his chin glistened bluish between his silvery whiskers. The alum tingled, the powder cooled his throat.

The brownish-yellow parquet floor, with only its center covered by a strip of red carpeting, hazily mirrored the lower part of Herr von Trotta’s body: the black trousers, the gilt tip of the scabbard, and also the billowing shadow of the coattails. Herr von Trotta rose. He walked across the carpet with timid, soundless steps. His heart pounded. But his soul was tranquil. At this moment, five minutes before his audience with his Kaiser, Herr von Trotta felt as if he had been frequenting this place for years, as if he were accustomed to reporting to His Majesty Kaiser Franz Joseph I every morning and supplying his personal account of all the previous day’s incidents in the Moravian district of W. The Herr District Captain felt thoroughly at home in his Kaiser’s palace. At most he was bothered by the thought that he might need to run his fingers once more through his whiskers but had no time to pull off his white gloves. No minister of the Kaiser’s, not even the Comptroller himself, could have felt more at home here than Herr von Trotta. From time to time the wind billowed the sunny yellow curtains on the high arched windows, and a touch of summery green stole into the district captain’s field of vision.

They performed in two round, open, wooden malls in the Little Forest. The ladies sat in canvas-covered baggage wagons, wearing summer frocks over stiff corsets and wheel-size hats on which stuffed birds nested. Although the ladies were hot they smiled, each lady a cheerful breeze. They smiled with lips and eyes, with breasts trapped in airy tight-hooked frocks, with ajourisé lace gloves that reached up to their elbows, with tiny handkerchiefs that they held in their hands, sometimes dabbing their noses—but gently, gently to avoid tattering the lace. Vendors sold candy, champagne, and tickets for the wheel of fortune, which was handled personally by the superintendent, and colored pouches of confetti, which was poured on all of them and which they tried to puff away by coquettishly pursing their lips. Nor was there any lack of paper streamers. They coiled around necks and legs and dangled from the trees, instantly turning all natural pines into man-made ones.

His father sat opposite the door, next to the window. Through the green blinds the sun traced thin stripes on the dark-red carpet. A fly buzzed, a clock ticked on the wall. The room was cool, shady, and filled with summery hush, as it had been long ago during vacations. Nevertheless a vague new glow clung to all the objects here. One couldn’t tell where it came from. The district captain stood up. He himself emanated the new shimmer. The pure silver of his beard tinged the greenish light of the day and the reddish glow of the carpet. It exhaled the radiant mildness of an unknown, perhaps otherworldly day that was already dawning in the midst of Herr von Trotta’s earthly life, just as the mornings of this world begin to dawn while the stars of the night are still shining. Many years ago, when the boy had come from Hranice to spend his vacation, his father’s whiskers had been a small black cloud divided in two."|"The Radetzky March"|"Joseph Roth"

Christmas and Easter he spent at his uncle’s. He came home only during summer holidays. He always arrived on a Sunday. This accorded with the wishes of his father, Herr District Captain Franz, Baron von Trotta und Sipolje. At home, summer vacation, no matter when it commenced at school, had to begin on a Saturday. On Sundays, Herr von Trotta was off duty. He reserved the entire morning, from nine to twelve, for his son.

He knew the names of all the members of the Imperial Royal House. He loved them all sincerely, with a child’s devoted heart—more than anyone else the Kaiser, who was kind and great, sublime and just, infinitely remote and very close, and particularly fond of the officers in the army. It would be best to die for him amid military music, easiest with “The Radetzky March.” The swift bullets whistled in cadence around Carl Joseph’s ears, his naked saber flashed, and, his heart and head brimming with the lovely briskness of the march, he sank into the drumming intoxication of the music, and his blood oozed out in a thin dark-red trickle upon the glistening gold of the trumpets, the deep black of the drums, and the victorious silver of the cymbals."|"The Radetzky March"|"Joseph Roth"

He was surprised that he felt no melancholy. A bottle of 180 Proof stood on the table, but he didn’t need a drink. Chojnicki came to pick him up. His riding crop cracked downstairs—and now he was in the room. He sat and watched. It was afternoon, the church clock struck three. All the mellow voices of summer poured in through the open window. Summer itself was calling Lieutenant Trotta. Chojnicki, in a light-gray suit with yellow stripes, his yellow crop in his hand, was an envoy of summer. The lieutenant rubbed his sleeve across the dull scabbard, drew the sword, puffed on it, wiped the steel with his handkerchief, and placed the weapon in a case. It was like preparing a corpse for its funeral. Before strapping the sword case to the trunk, he balanced it once again on his palm. Then he buried Max Demant’s sword next to it. He read the inscription scratched under the hilt. “Leave the army!” Demant had said. Now he was leaving…."|"The Radetzky March"|"Joseph Roth"

At the age of seven Trotta had started boarding school, at ten military school. He had been a soldier all his life. Trotta the soldier had to be buried and mourned.

Soon they noticed that the road was widening. A deserted railroad station shone nearby. That was where the tracks began. The battalion ran to the station—they were safe here; for a few miles they would be covered on either side by the embankments. The enemy, perhaps a sotnia of galloping Cossacks, must be across from them on the other side. Silent and dejected, they marched between the embankments."|"The Radetzky March"|"Joseph Roth"

He never cared much for women, aside from his own Frau Baroness, but she soon died—her lungs. Everyone knew he had saved the Kaiser’s life at the Battle of Solferino, but he kept mum about it, never a peep out of him. That was why they wrote ‘The Hero of Solferino’ on his gravestone. He wasn’t so old when he died; it was in the evening, around nine, in November. It was already snowing. That afternoon he’d been standing in the courtyard, and he said, ‘Jacques, where did you put my fur-lined boots?’ I didn’t know where, but I said, ‘I’ll get them, Herr Baron.’ ‘Tomorrow’s soon enough!’ he says—and tomorrow he no longer needed them.

And when physical training began on the water meadow, in the wide greenish glade framed by blackish firs, the silvery mists rose clumsily, torn apart by the vehement, regular motions of the dark-blue uniforms. Pale and dismal, the sun then rose. Its matte silver, cool and alien, broke through the black branches. Frosty shudders passed like a cruel comb over the russet skins of the horses, and their whinnying emerged from the nearby glade—painful cries for home and stable. The soldiers were doing “carbine exercises.” Carl Joseph could hardly wait to get back to the barracks. He dreaded the fifteen-minute break, which started punctually at ten, and the conversations with his fellow officers, who sometimes gathered in the nearby tavern to have a beer and wait for Colonel Kovacs. Even more awkward was the evening at the officers’ club. It would soon begin. Attendance was mandatory. Taps was fast approaching. The dark-blue jingling shadows of returning men flitted through the murky rectangle of the parade ground. Sergeant Reznicek was already stepping from his door, clutching his yellowly blinking lantern, and the buglers were gathering in the darkness. The yellow brass instruments shimmered against the dark shiny blue of the uniforms. From the stables came the drowsy whinnying of the horses.

They all remembered Dr. Demant’s arrival several weeks ago, after a long medical furlough. They could see his faltering steps and his sparkling glasses. They could see Count Tattenbach, his short rotund body on bandy equestrian legs, the eternally red skull with the close-shorn clear-blond hair parted down the middle and his pale, beady, red-rimmed little eyes. They could hear the physician’s gentle voice and the rittmaster’s thunderous voice. And even though the words “honor” and “dying,” “shooting” and “fighting,” “death” and “grave” had been at home in their hearts and minds ever since they could think and feel, it struck them today as incomprehensible that they might be separated forever from the rittmaster’s thunderous voice and the physician’s gentle one. Whenever the doleful chimes of the large wall clock rang out, the men believed that their own final hour had struck. Unwilling to trust their ears, they looked at the wall.

"ap 07:20"|seven-twenty|"On those long-vanished Sundays when Carl Joseph had stood on his father’s balcony while Herr Nechwal’s military band had intoned “The Radetzky March,” it would have been a bagatelle to fall and die. The cadet at the Imperial and Royal Military Academy had been intimate with the notion of death, but it had been a very remote death. Tomorrow morning, seven-twenty, Death was waiting for his friend, Dr. Demant; the day after tomorrow, or in a few days, for Lieutenant Carl Joseph von Trotta. Oh, horror and darkness! To be the cause of Death’s black arrival and finally to be his victim! And should he not become his victim, how many corpses still lined the roadway? Like milestones on other men’s roads, the gravestones lay along Trotta’s road. He was certain he would never see his friend again, just as he had never seen Katharina again. Never again! In front of Carl Joseph’s eyes, this word stretched out without shore or limit, a dead sea of numb eternity. The little lieutenant clenched his white weak fist against the grand black law, which rolled up the headstones but set no dam against the relentlessness of never and refused to illuminate the everlasting darkness. He clenched his fist; he stepped over to the window to raise his fist against heaven. But he raised only his eyes. He saw the cold twinkling of the winter stars. He remembered the night, the last time he had walked with Dr. Demant, from the barracks to the town. The last time, he had known then."|"The Radetzky March"|"Joseph Roth"

Dr. Demant had six more hours to live, six big hours. Now this time span seemed almost as mighty to the lieutenant as the shoreless eternity had seemed. He dashed over to the clothes hook, strapped on his saber and yanked on his coat, hurried along the corridor and practically soared down the stairs, raced across the nocturnal rectangle of the parade ground, out the gates, past the sentry, ran through the silent landscape, reached the little town in ten minutes and, a while later, the only sleigh that was on lonely night duty; and he glided amid the comforting jingling toward the southern edge of the town, toward the physician’s house. Behind the gate the small house slept with sightless windows. Trotta rang the bell. The hush continued. He shouted Dr. Demant’s name. Nothing stirred. He waited. He told the coachmen to crack his whip. No one responded."|"The Radetzky March"|"Joseph Roth"

His sparkling glasses approached the lieutenant’s light-brown hair. He, the wise Dr. Demant, had already settled accounts with the world; he had sent his wife to her father in Vienna, given his orderly leave, closed down his house. He had been staying at the Golden Bear Hotel ever since the eruption of this disastrous affair. He was ready. Once he had started drinking liquor contrary to his habit, he had actually managed to find some sense in this senseless duel, to wish for death as the lawful end of a path bristling with errors—indeed, he managed to glean a shimmer of the next world, which he had always believed in. After all, long before the danger toward which he was now heading, he had been familiar with graves and dead friends. Gone was his childish love for his wife. Jealousy, painfully burning in his heart just weeks ago, was now a small pile of cold ashes. His will, just written, addressed to the colonel, was in his coat pocket. He had nothing to bequeath, few people to remember, and thus had forgotten nothing. The alcohol gave him a light head; only the waiting made him impatient. Seven-twenty, the moment that for days now had been hammering dreadfully in the brains of all his comrades, pealed in his brain like a silvery chime. For the first time since he had donned his uniform, he felt strong, brave, and lighthearted. He enjoyed the nearness of death the way a convalescent enjoys the nearness of life. He had settled accounts, he was ready!"|"The Radetzky March"|"Joseph Roth"
"ap 03:00"|three|"Now the wall clock struck three hard strokes. Trotta suddenly fell silent. They heard the echo of the three strokes drowning slowly in the humming of the gas lamp. The lieutenant began in a steady voice."|"The Radetzky March"|"Joseph Roth"
"ap 07:20"|Seven-twenty|"Carl Joseph drank. He did not quite grasp what the doctor was saying, but he sensed that Demant was no longer willing to die. The clock ticked its tinny seconds. Time did not stop. Seven-twenty, seven-twenty! It would take a miracle to keep Demant from dying. Miracles did not occur, that much the lieutenant knew. He himself—a preposterous thought—would show up tomorrow morning at seven-twenty and say, “Gentlemen, Demant went crazy last night. I’m dueling in his place.” Drivel, ridiculous, impossible! He looked helplessly at the doctor again. Time did not stop; the clock kept endlessly stitching its seconds. Soon it would be 4 A.M. Three more hours!"|"The Radetzky March"|"Joseph Roth"

"ap 07:20"|Seven-twenty|"They walked across the courtyard, back through the corridor, into the night. The doctor looked up at the sky. The silent stars offered no counsel; they were colder than the snow all around. The houses were dark, the streets deaf and dumb, the night wind blasted the snow into powder, Trotta’s spurs jingled softly, the doctor’s boot soles crunched next to them. They hurried as if toward a specific goal. Shreds of ideas, of thoughts, of images raced through their minds. Their hearts pounded like swift, heavy hammers. Unwittingly the regimental surgeon set the direction; unwittingly the lieutenant followed him. They approached the Golden Bear Hotel. They stood in its arched doorway. In Carl Joseph’s imagination, the image of Grandfather Demant awoke, the silver-bearded king of the Jewish tavern keepers. All his life, he had sat at such a gateway—a much bigger one, probably. He would rise to his feet when the farmers drew up. Since he could no longer hear, the little farmers would cup their hands on their mouths and yell out their orders. Seven-twenty, seven-twenty: it came again. At seven-twenty the grandson of that grandfather would be dead."|"The Radetzky March"|"Joseph Roth"
"ap 07:40"|seven-forty|"He veered left, between the trunks, where a path branched off to the wide highway. It was seven-forty. No shots had been heard. Everything’s fine, everything’s fine, he told himself; a miracle has occurred! Within ten minutes at the latest, Major Prohaska is sure to come riding along; then I’ll know everything. He could hear the hesitant noises of the small town awakening and the long shriek of a locomotive at the station."|"The Radetzky March"|"Joseph Roth"
15:00|"three in the afternoon"|"The lieutenant slowly set out to perform his hard chore. It was three in the afternoon. The small storekeepers, wretched and frozen, stood outside their doors, waiting for their rare customers. From the workshops of the craftsmen came familiar productive noises. A cheerful hammering resounded from the smithy, a hollow metallic thunder rattled from the plumber’s shop, a swift clattering rose from the cobbler’s basement, and saws ground in the cabinetmaker’s workshop. The lieutenant knew all the faces and all the noises of these workshops. He rode past them twice a day. From his saddle he could see over the old blue-and-white signs, his head looming above them. Every day he saw the morning interiors of the upstairs rooms, the beds, the coffeepots, the men in shirtsleeves, the women with their hair down, the flowerpots on the windowsills, pickles and dried fruit behind ornamental ironwork."|"The Radetzky March"|"Joseph Roth"
"ap 23:50"|"ten minutes to twelve"|"Trotta unwrapped the saber. Dr. Demant’s smooth silver watch dangled from the hilt. The watch had stopped. It showed ten minutes to twelve. The lieutenant wound it and held it to his ear. Its frail, swift voice ticked comfortingly. He pried the cap open with his penknife, curious and eager to play—a boy. Inside were the initials M.D. He pulled the saber from its sheath. Right beneath the hilt, Dr. Demant had used a knife to carve a few clumsy, sprawling letters into the steel. Live well and free! said the inscription. The lieutenant hung the saber in the closet. He held the sword hanger in his hand. Its wired silk glided through his fingers—a cool, golden rain. Trotta shut the closet; he shut a coffin."|"The Radetzky March"|"Joseph Roth"
12:00|noon|"The rifle officers’ mess hall was located in two small rooms of a private home. Most of the officers ate at the station restaurant. So did Carl Joseph. He liked to march through the slapping mire just to see the station. It was the last of all the monarchy’s stations; nevertheless, it too displayed two pairs of glittering rails ribboning uninterruptedly into the core of the empire. This station too had not only bright, glassy, cheerful signals jingling with soft echoes of calls from home but also an incessantly ticking Morse apparatus on which the lovely, confused voices of a lost and distant world were diligently hammered out, stitched out as if on a bustling sewing machine. This station too had a stationmaster, and this master swung a jangling bell, and the bell signified, All aboard! All aboard! Once a day, at the stroke of noon, the stationmaster swung his bell at the train heading west, toward Crakow, Bogumin, Vienna. A good, dear train! It lingered almost until the end of lunch, outside the windows of the first-class dining room where the officers sat. The engine did not whistle until the coffee arrived. The gray steam billowed against the panes. By the time the damp beads began streaking the glass, the train was gone. The bleak group of diners drank their coffee and slowly straggled back through the silvery-gray mud. Not even generals on tours of inspection cared to come this far. They did not come. Nobody came. At the small town’s only hotel, where most of the officers resided as permanent tenants, the rich hops dealers from Nuremberg and Prague and Zatec would stay only twice a year. Once they completed their inscrutable deals, they would send for musicians and play cards at the only café, which belonged to the hotel."|"The Radetzky March"|"Joseph Roth"
"~ 05:00"|"around 5 A.M."|"At these functions, the officers of the ultrafeudal dragoon regiment and the mostly nonaristocratic officers of the rifle battalion swore tearful oaths of lifelong friendship. The summer dawns peering through the broad arched windows of the castle witnessed a gaudy chaos of infantry and cavalry uniforms. The sleepers snored toward the golden sun. At around 5 A.M., a throng of despairing orderlies dashed over to the castle to awaken their masters. For at six the regiments began their drills. The host, who was never worn out by liquor, had long since returned to his small hunting lodge. There he fiddled around with peculiar test tubes, tiny flames, laboratory apparatuses. Rumor had it that the count was trying to make gold. He certainly appeared to be engaged in foolish alchemical experiments. But while he may not have succeeded in producing gold, he did know how to win at roulette. He occasionally let on that he had inherited an infallible “system” from a mysterious long-deceased gambler."|"The Radetzky March"|"Joseph Roth"
