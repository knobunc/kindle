The Chief of Naval Operations had left abruptly at quarter to eleven from a dinner party at which the UPI’s Pentagon man had also been present; across town the Assistant Secretary of State for Latin American Affairs and his wife, pleading the excuse of a call from the babysitter about one of the kids having an upset tummy, departed with equal speed from a similar gathering; the AP’s State Department man was there. Within five minutes both journalists, acting on hunch, instinct, and the off-chance, had telephoned their offices and said they were going to drop by the White House, just in case.

He could remember the place, the occasion, and the speaker. It was at Bohemian Grove in the summer of his fortieth year, and there, with dull Care cremated and the enchanted canyon echoing in the night to the sound of music everywhere and the laughter of happy voices, he had been walking along River Road after midnight past the camp known as River Road Ramblers when he was hailed and welcomed aboard. Turning toward him from his place by the fire was that complex and brilliant personality who was to precede him in Sacramento and then go on to precede Harley Hudson in the White House. He was then in his fifth year as Governor and beginning to get in position for what he liked to call “the big try.” Now he greeted Ted merrily, and turning to the group around him called out, “You were wondering who you ought to have in Sacramento after I leave? There he is right now! His great-granddaddy made it. Why shouldn’t he?” And although Ted protested that Don Carlos had not actually been his great-granddaddy but only his great-grandmother’s first husband, the Governor had won agreeing laughter from their attentive audience when he said, “Never admit it, Ted! Never you admit it. He was in your family, wasn’t he—some way? And he was a Governor of California, and a pretty damned good and romantic one too. Don Carlos-Don Eduardo! With the romance of Old Spain—and JM—and that wife of yours—and your own good looks and ability—hell’s fire, boy, how can you lose?” There had been much good-natured joking and agreement before someone began playing the piano and River Road Ramblers became diverted again to song. Two days later every political columnist in the state was reporting that, “The Governor exploded a political bombshell at Bohemian Grove this week when he named Edward M. Jason as his handpicked successor.” And for the remainder of the Grove, Ted found himself hailed as “Governor” wherever he went through the lazy days and happy nights among the towering trees."|"Capable of Honor"|"Allen Drury"
