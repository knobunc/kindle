"ap < 11:00"|"Nearly eleven o’clock"|"“Nearly eleven o’clock,” said Pooh happily. “You’re just in time for a little smackerel of something,” and he put his head into the cupboard. “And then we’ll go out, Piglet, and sing my song to Eeyore.”"|"The House at Pooh Corner Deluxe Edition"|"A. A. Milne"
"ap 10:55"|"five minutes to eleven"|"The clock was still saying five minutes to eleven when Pooh and Piglet set out on their way half an hour later. The wind had dropped, and the snow, tired of rushing round in circles trying to catch itself up, now fluttered gently down until it found a place on which to rest, and sometimes the place was Pooh’s nose and sometimes it wasn’t, and in a little while Piglet was wearing a white muffler round his neck and feeling more snowy behind the ears than he had ever felt before."|"The House at Pooh Corner Deluxe Edition"|"A. A. Milne"
"~ 03:00"|"about three o’clock in the morning"|"“I don’t know how it is, Christopher Robin, but what with all this snow and one thing and another, not to mention icicles and such-like, it isn’t so Hot in my field about three o’clock in the morning as some people think it is. It isn’t Close, if you know what I mean—not so as to be uncomfortable. It isn’t Stuffy. In fact, Christopher Robin,” he went on in a loud whisper, “quite-between-ourselves-and-don’t-tell-anybody, it’s Cold.”"|"The House at Pooh Corner Deluxe Edition"|"A. A. Milne"
"~ 03:00"|"about three o’clock in the morning"|"“And I said to myself: The others will be sorry if I’m getting myself all cold. They haven’t got Brains, any of them, only grey fluff that’s blown into their heads by mistake, and they don’t Think, but if it goes on snowing for another six weeks or so, one of them will begin to say to himself: ‘Eeyore can’t be so very much too Hot about three o’clock in the morning.’ And then it will Get About. And they’ll be Sorry.”"|"The House at Pooh Corner Deluxe Edition"|"A. A. Milne"
"~ 07:00"|"about seven o’clock in the morning"|"Christopher Robin, who was thinking of something else, said: “Where’s Pooh?”—but Rabbit had gone. So he went into his house and drew a picture of Pooh going a long walk at about seven o’clock in the morning, and then he climbed to the top of his tree and climbed down again, and then he wondered what Pooh was doing, and went across the Forest to see."|"The House at Pooh Corner Deluxe Edition"|"A. A. Milne"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"And all the time he was saying things like this he was going more and more westerly, without thinking…until suddenly he found himself at his own front door again.
And it was eleven o’clock.
Which was Time-for-a-little-something…."|"The House at Pooh Corner Deluxe Edition"|"A. A. Milne"
"ap ~ 11:30"|"about half-past eleven"|"Written down, like this, it doesn’t seem a very good song, but coming through pale fawn fluff at about half-past eleven on a very sunny morning, it seemed to Pooh to be one of the best songs he had ever sung. So he went on singing it."|"The House at Pooh Corner Deluxe Edition"|"A. A. Milne"
