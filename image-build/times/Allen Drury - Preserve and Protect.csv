It appeared to Bob Munson and Bob Leffingwell as they arrived, to be greeted by a few mildly resentful murmurs but no overt outburst, that there were even a few relatively clean shirts and scrapes in the front rows, a few faces that looked as though they had actually been washed."|"Preserve and Protect"|"Allen Drury"
"ap 01:55"|"five minutes to two"|"By five minutes to two, everyone who had a reason to be there was in the leather-lined, book-filled, comfortably cluttered room where Mr. Justice Davis was accustomed to discuss pending cases with his clerks, entertain his friends at little private luncheons, write his opinions, or just sit and read. With a firmness that matched the President’s, and had quite surprised, puzzled and upset the media, he had sharply reduced the number of people and the amount of equipment that might be in the room. At best it was tiny and would hold no more than fifty comfortably. He had reduced it even further by announcing that he would permit one pool cameraman, one sound man and one reporter for television; two radio correspondents; two still photographers and two reporters from each of the two wire services; and three newspaper correspondents. These had been chosen by lot at emergency meetings last night of the Congressional gallery committees for the various media. The outcry was not as bitter against Mr. Justice Davis as it had been against the President, because Mr. Justice Davis, after all, was one of the Good Guys; but his decision did make for a lot of practical difficulties in coverage, there was no doubt about that. But Tommy, though they did not know it, had made up his mind on certain things and intended to stick to them."|"Preserve and Protect"|"Allen Drury"

Out of the votes taken today no really clear-cut pattern had developed. The Jason forces had lost heavily on the motion to reduce security, but there were many individual reasons for that. They had come back up very substantially on the vote to reconvene the convention, and though they had lost, there were many individual reasons for that, too, including Tommy’s ruling. It did not necessarily mean that they could not win a vote to make Ted the nominee. Nor did it necessarily mean that the Knox forces were in command. The vote that would show the real relative strength of the two candidates had not come, and nobody wanted to force it just yet."|"Preserve and Protect"|"Allen Drury"
