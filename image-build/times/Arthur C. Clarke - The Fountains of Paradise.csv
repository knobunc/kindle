"ap 04:00"|four|"When his visitors had left, in a very thoughtful mood Rajasinghe depolarised the library windows and sat for a long time staring out at the trees around the villa, and the rock walls of Yakkagala looming beyond. He had not moved when, precisely on the stroke of four, the arrival of his afternoon tea jolted him out of his reverie."|"The Fountains of Paradise"|"Arthur C. Clarke"
04:00|"four a.m."|"Morgan had left his hotel in Ranapura at four a.m. on a clear, moonless night. He was not too happy about the choice of time, but Professor Sarath, who had made all the arrangements, had promised him that it would be well worthwhile. “You won’t understand anything about Sri Kanda,” he had said, “unless you have watched the dawn from the summit. And Buddy - er, the Maha Thero - won’t receive visitors at any other time. He says it’s a splendid way of discouraging the merely curious.” So Morgan had acquiesced with as much good grace as possible."|"The Fountains of Paradise"|"Arthur C. Clarke"
05:00|"five a.m."|"These ominous thoughts were entirely forgotten when they arrived at the cable car terminus and Morgan discovered to his surprise - it was still only five a.m. - that at least a hundred people were milling around in the little waiting-room. He ordered a welcome hot coffee for himself and his garrulous driver - who, rather to his relief, showed no interest in making the ascent. “I’ve done it at least twenty times,” he said with perhaps exaggerated boredom. “I’m going to sleep in the car until you come down.”"|"The Fountains of Paradise"|"Arthur C. Clarke"

"ap ~ 10:00"|"About ten"|"“About ten teratons, moving at two kilometres a second. The inner moon, Phobos. It’s a cosmic bulldozer, going past the elevator every eleven hours. I’ve not worked out the exact probabilities, but a collision is inevitable every few days.”"|"The Fountains of Paradise"|"Arthur C. Clarke"
"ap 11:10"|"eleven hours and ten minutes"|"“Phobos sweeps past the tower every eleven hours and ten minutes, but luckily it isn’t moving in exactly the same plane - or we’d have a collision every time it went round. It misses on most revolutions and the danger times are exactly predictable - to a thousandth of a second, if desired. Now the elevator, like any piece of engineering, isn’t a completely rigid structure. It has natural vibration periods, which can be calculated almost as accurately as planetary orbits. So what your engineers propose to do is to tune the elevator, so that its normal oscillations - which can’t be avoided anyway - always keep it clear of Phobos. Every time the satellite passes by the structure, it isn’t there - it’s sidestepped the danger zone by a few kilometres.”"|"The Fountains of Paradise"|"Arthur C. Clarke"
"ap 01:50"|"one fifty"|"“Altitude four zero. Buffeting badly. Tension peaking at one fifty - I repeat, one fifty percent.”"|"The Fountains of Paradise"|"Arthur C. Clarke"
"ap 10:11"|ten-eleven|"For power had come to him; he had never sought it. And it had always been a very special, limited kind of power - advisory, not executive. He was only Special Assistant (Acting Ambassador) for Political Affairs, directly responsible to President and Council, with a staff that never exceeded ten-eleven, if one included ARISTOTLE. (His console still had direct access to Ari’s memory and processing banks, and they talked to each other several times a year.) But towards the end the Council had invariably accepted his advice, and the world had given him much of the credit that should have gone to the unsung, unhonoured bureaucrats of the Peace Division."|"The Fountains of Paradise"|"Arthur C. Clarke"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"Soon after midnight, when it was obvious that the auroral display had passed its climax, Rajasinghe had been carried back into his bedroom. As he always did when he had said goodnight to his household staff, he relaxed with a glass of hot toddy and switched on the late news summary. The only item that really interested him was the progress that Morgan was making; by this time he should be approaching the base of the Tower."|"The Fountains of Paradise"|"Arthur C. Clarke"
19:00|"19.00 hours"|"The little amphitheatre faced the western wall of Yakkagala, its two hundred seats all carefully orientated so that each spectator looked up into the laser projectors at the correct angle. The performance always began at exactly the same time throughout the year - 19.00 hours, as the last glow of the invariant equatorial sunset faded from the sky."|"The Fountains of Paradise"|"Arthur C. Clarke"
