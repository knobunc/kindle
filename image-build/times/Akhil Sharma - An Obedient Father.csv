"ap 08:15"|"quarter past eight"|"Asha wandered to the living room and turned on the television. Before leaving for school, she would move more and more slowly, so that it took her ten minutes to put her books in their bag. Asha was taking classes in May, even though most schools were closed, because she had missed many days when her father died. Rosary was one of the few schools that had government approval for a summer program and that was why I had had her admitted there. I went into the living room to watch the television news. Eventually Asha shuffled into the bedroom she and Anita shared. Through the doorway I saw her putting on white ankle-length socks and small black shoes. At a quarter past eight, she slung a satchel full of books around one shoulder and came to her mother in the kitchen to say goodbye. Anita kissed both of Asha’s hands and her forehead. I saw this from my room, where I was dressing, and felt sad and guilty again. The first anniversary of Radha’s death was in two days."|"An Obedient Father"|"Akhil Sharma"
"ap 09:30"|nine-thirty|"There was little traffic on the road and soon we were out of Model Town and on the main road back to the Old Vegetable Market. It was nine-thirty, but already homeless people had placed their cots along the edges of the road. The grassy swaths of land which divide the road were spotted with the stoves and dung fires of more homeless people. I pulled Asha next to me. “Did you enjoy yourself?” I asked."|"An Obedient Father"|"Akhil Sharma"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"Pitaji is dead. Asha and I are on the roof. The sky is ashy from the city’s trapped lights. It is three in ashy from the city’s trapped lights. It is three in the morning, or later. Moisture is finally collecting on the sheets. I am sitting on my cot. I have not slept at all since I saw Pitaji dead. I am staring at my daughter, because otherwise Pitaji appears before me. Asha’s hands are on her hips above the white sheet that reaches her waist."|"An Obedient Father"|"Akhil Sharma"
"ap > 11:00"|"a little after eleven"|"From the roof, a little after eleven, I watched Rajinder drive away on his scooter. He was going to my parents’ flat in the Old Vegetable Market. My dowry was stored there. There was nothing for me to do while he was gone. I wandered around the roof. Defense Colony is composed of rows of pale three- and four-storied buildings. There was a small park edged with eucalyptus trees behind our house."|"An Obedient Father"|"Akhil Sharma"
"~ 01:00"|"about one in the morning"|"The celebration lasted another six hours, ending about one in the morning. I did not remember most of it till many years later. The two red thrones on which we sat to receive congratulations are only in the photographs, not in my memories. There are photos showing steam coming from people’s mouths, so it must have been especially cold. For nearly eight years I did not remember how Ashok and his mother, Ma, Pitaji, Kusum, Rajesh got into the car with us to go to the dharamshala, where the people from Rajinder’s side were spending the night. Nor did I remember walking through the dharamshala’s halls, passing rooms where people were asleep on cots, mattresses without frames, blankets folded twice before being laid down."|"An Obedient Father"|"Akhil Sharma"
"~ 08:00"|"around eight in the morning"|"Sleep was there as soon as I closed my eyes. But around eight in the morning, when Rajinder woke me, I was exhausted. The door to our room was open. One of Rajinder’s cousins, a fat hairy man with a towel around his waist, walked past to the bathroom. Seeing me, he leered."|"An Obedient Father"|"Akhil Sharma"
"ap 05:00"|five|"For me, the heat was like a constant buzzing. It separated flesh from bone and my skin felt rubbery. I began to wake earlier and earlier. By five, the eastern edge of the sky was too bright to look at. I bathed early in the morning, then after breakfast. I did so again after doing laundry, before lunch. As June progressed, the very air seemed to whine under the heat’s stress. I stopped eating lunch. Around two, before taking my nap, I poured a few mugs of water on my head. I liked to lie on the bed imagining the monsoon had come."|"An Obedient Father"|"Akhil Sharma"

"ap 03:00"|three|"While I hurried clothes into a plastic bag, Kusum leaned against a wall of our bedroom drinking water. It was three. Rajinder sat on the edge of the bed in a blue kurta pajama. I felt no fear. The rushing, the banging on doors seemed to be only melodrama."|"An Obedient Father"|"Akhil Sharma"
"ap ~ 08:00"|"Around eight"|"Around eight, Ma returned. While we were there, I kept looking away from her, because it made me too sad to see her face. I went to the flat. In the days that followed, it was I who replaced Ma in the morning. Kusum lived at home while Pitaji was sick, but she came to the hospital only once."|"An Obedient Father"|"Akhil Sharma"
"ap ~ 05:00"|"around five"|"I watched the cricket game to the end. Again, I felt enormous. When the children dispersed, it was around five. Rajinder should have left his office."|"An Obedient Father"|"Akhil Sharma"
"ap 04:00"|four|"I woke at four or five. The rain scratched against the windows and there was a light like blue milk along the edges of the door. I was cold and tried wrapping myself in the sheet, but it was not large enough."|"An Obedient Father"|"Akhil Sharma"

"~ 03:00"|"Around three that morning"|"Around three that morning, the alcohol thinned to the point that I no longer passed out automatically. My bladder started to ache, but I did not want to get up. Walking to the bathroom would
make it harder to believe that I had imagined everything. I stayed on the cot with the sheet pulled over my face and thought, Anita couldn’t remember; what happened with her was so long ago. If she couldn’t remember, why would she be suspicious? Besides, from where she stood, how could she see I had my penis against Asha’s back? When she told Asha to brush her teeth, there was nothing on Anita’s face to show that she knew."|"An Obedient Father"|"Akhil Sharma"
"ap < 05:00"|"A little before five"|"A little before five, the pain in my bladder forced me up. My room had become packed with fears, and leaving it for the common room felt like stepping off a crowded bus into wind. The balcony door and the kitchen shutters were closed, but enough light slipped through them to tint the darkness blue. I could hear the whoosh of my own blood. My fears were joined by horror."|"An Obedient Father"|"Akhil Sharma"
21:00|"nine at night"|"When I was fifteen my father joined the Arya Samaj, a forerunner of the BJP, and sent me to an Arya Samaj school. The principal told us students to think of ourselves as being in God Ram’s army. We were to live a life of simplicity, deprived, as much as possible, of the objects of vanity which might keep us from ourselves and our responsibilities. The lives of all eighty or so students were to be contained by the row of four perfectly square classrooms at the center of the school compound and, behind it, the enormous barracks-style room where we slept. Each student’s bed had to be made before breakfast, and no bed could be unmade before nine at night. All personal belongings had to be kept beneath your cot or on the single small table which stood by the bed. In the back of the compound, the part farthest from the town’s only road, was a series of latrines. On Sundays the students had to clean each building with ammonia."|"An Obedient Father"|"Akhil Sharma"
"ap 10:30"|Ten-thirty|"The money from blessing the ice-cream factory must have dulled his desire for work, I thought. “Ten.”
“Ten-thirty.” Without another word, he closed the door.
When I stepped back onto the road, the roofs were still crowded, but a jeep with six or seven khaki-uniformed policemen standing in it was slowly rolling down the road. The hoodlums had disappeared. My scalp crept from all the people gazing down. I wanted to break into a trot, but I made myself keep walking."|"An Obedient Father"|"Akhil Sharma"
03:00|"three this morning"|"Rajesh said, “I left Faridabad at three this morning.” He toppled onto his side to show his exhaustion and repeated, “Three.” He smiled. “Somebody phoned a neighbor, who warned everyone. When I heard, I thought, Better start now, in case there are riots.” Across the aisle from the bed were two wooden chairs against a wall. I took off my shirt and draped it over one of these chairs. I sat down on the chair and began unlacing my shoes. Rajesh couldn’t possibly be speaking this way if Anita had revealed my secret."|"An Obedient Father"|"Akhil Sharma"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"I stayed on the balcony for hours. At maybe two or three in the morning, far away in the dark, a box kite with a burning candle inside rose and hovered. It was pulled down near dawn, and then I went back to my room."|"An Obedient Father"|"Akhil Sharma"
"ap ~ 03:30"|"about three-thirty"|"When the funeral pyre was lit, I felt such a sense of ending that I opened my door and walked into the living room, where Anita and Asha sat silently together on the two love seats watching television. It was about three-thirty."|"An Obedient Father"|"Akhil Sharma"
"> 01:00"|"a little after one in the morning"|"The phone rang at a little after one in the morning. I heard it immediately because I was awake. The low buzzing rrrs must have repeated ten times before Anita picked up. A moment later she knocked on my door."|"An Obedient Father"|"Akhil Sharma"
"ap ~ 05:00"|"about five"|"One afternoon I came home exhausted and nauseated from a headache. The heat had given me a nosebleed earlier that day, and just before I arrived, the trickle restarted. I lay down on the living-room bed, because when I tried sleeping in the smallness of my room, the ceiling swayed. Anita made me salty lemonade before I fell asleep. I woke an hour later, at about five, with the phone buzzing beside my head. It was late enough in the day that I winced at the idea of a fresh task."|"An Obedient Father"|"Akhil Sharma"
"ap ~ 11:00"|"about eleven"|"“One hundred and forty, the BJP says. A poster on plain thin paper. And then because I want more posters than the BJP put up, because I can’t afford their price, I have to lie and go around them and hire people on my own. I had to buy a minimum of ten thousand posters from the BJP.” I wondered whether Mr. Gupta thought that revealing his exploitation would somehow make me be kinder to him. Since the campaign started, perhaps to win people’s affection, Mr. Gupta had begun talking about his feelings. Because of the problems that always beset him, this openness made him appear complaining, distracted, and lost. “They were supposed to give me two generators. Why do I have one?” Having finished dressing, Mr. Gupta said, “Come tonight at about eleven and we’ll drink tea.”"|"An Obedient Father"|"Akhil Sharma"
"ap < 08:00"|"a little before eight"|"That night, a little before eight, one of Mr. Gupta’s servants, a boy judging from his voice, phoned and said that Ajay’s body had been found and would I please meet Mr. Gupta at the morgue near the ISBT. He gave me the address."|"An Obedient Father"|"Akhil Sharma"
