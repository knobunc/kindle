"ap 09:00"|0900|"Soshi nodded. “Enter a plea of not guilty for the defendant. We will adjourn until 0900, three weeks from today, at which time this court will reconvene for a court-martial.” He struck his gavel on the table."|"The Swarm"|"Orson Scott Card"
00:00|midnight|"Bingwen went alone to the Formic tunnels that night, wearing his black battle suit and a climbing harness. He left the officers’ barracks at midnight and mounted his skim cycle under the cover of darkness. No guards were on duty. All was quiet. He slid on his helmet, switched on its night vision, and flew west, soaring across a shallow valley in the northeast corner of Guangxi province."|"The Swarm"|"Orson Scott Card"
01:00|"one in the morning"|"It was one in the morning. Whoever was coming was coming for him. He listened for voices but heard nothing, which meant they were either well trained or wearing full helmets that covered their faces and sealed to their suits. Bingwen ran through every possible frequency—including the encrypted ones—until he found the one they were using. Two voices. Men. Speaking Mandarin."|"The Swarm"|"Orson Scott Card"
"ap 02:50"|"Two fifty"|"Lem shrugged. “Between corporates, free miners, and the IF? I don’t know. Two fifty? And that’s probably high.”"|"The Swarm"|"Orson Scott Card"

"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"Lem entered the offices of the Experimental Defense Division at Juke Limited and was surprised to find the lights still on. It was well past midnight, and yet the entire staff seemed to be on hand, as if Lem had caught them in the middle of their workday. The conference rooms were filled with engineers. Other groups were huddled at tables off to the sides, tapping away at their wrist pads and tablets and speaking in quick urgent tones. A lone engineer in need of a shave was bent forward asleep at a table, hugging his bag like a pillow. More people were asleep in hammocks in a dark corner of the room. Some looked to be in their sixties. Others looked like grad students. Lem made his way toward the back of the main hall, passing a trash receptacle overflowing with take-out boxes and stepping over a man in a sleeping bag."|"The Swarm"|"Orson Scott Card"
00:00|Midnight|"“You look nice,” she said, gesturing to the formal suit Lem was wearing. “What was it? The ballet? Political fund-raiser? Midnight’s a little late for that, isn’t it?”"|"The Swarm"|"Orson Scott Card"
00:00|midnight|"“I only use economics when it helps my argument. Otherwise I loathe it. I’m a scientist, remember?”
“Can you tell me why I’m here at midnight please?”
“We’re calling it the NanoCloud,” said Benyawe."|"The Swarm"|"Orson Scott Card"
