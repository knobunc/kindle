are not
flying there are lots of jobs to do and it is a friendly group of
people. Of
course the best part of the day was the two flights. One lasted 15
minutes and
the other ten. We fly up on a wire which is pulled by a winch, then let
go of

Super was, as Oppenheimer put it in 1949,
""singularly proof against any form of experimental approach."" How do
you begin to build a hydrogen bomb, when you have no idea whether it is
possible or not? You build it numerically, neutron by neutron and
nanosecond by
nanosecond, in the memory of a computer, first. Ulam, von Neumann, and
Nick
Metropolis developed the ""Monte Carlo Method"" of statistical
approximation whereby a random sampling of events in an otherwise
intractable
branching process is followed through a series of representative slices
in
time, answering the otherwise incalculable question of whether a given
configuration would go thermonuclear or not. Computers led to bombs,
and bombs
led to computers. Although kept largely secret, the push to develop the
Super
drove the initial development of the digital computers then adapted to
other
purposes by companies like IBM. Ralph Slutz, who worked with von
Neumann on the
Institute for Advanced Study computer project, remembers ""a couple of
people from Los Alamos"" showing up as soon as the machine was
provisionally operational, ""with a program which they were terribly
eager
to run on the machine... starting at midnight, if we would let them
have the
time.""[22]"|"Project Orion"|"George Dyson"

1958, worldwide atmospheric testing was

if tests
on low coral islands were continued there might not be enough of them
left to

to carry out our first crucial demonstration of feasibility with a real

explosion,
underground, it was impossible to stand there in the empty desert
without
imagining Orion's full-scale launch. ""Only once in my life have I
experienced absolute silence,"" says Freeman. ""That was Jackass Flats
under the midday sun. It is a soul-shattering silence. You hold your
breath and
hear absolutely nothing. There in the white, flat silence I began for
the first
time to feel a slight sense of shame for what we were proposing to do.
Did we
really intend to invade this silence with our trucks and bulldozers,
and after
a few years leave it a radioactive junkyard? The first shadow of a
doubt about
the rightness of Orion came into my mind.""[276]"|"Project Orion"|"George Dyson"
