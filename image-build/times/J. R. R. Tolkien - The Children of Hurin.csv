 through flowery frith     and fair acresthey fared, and found     of folk emptythe leas and leasows     and the lawns of Narog,
 the teeming tilth     by trees enfoldedtwixt hills and river.     The hoes unreckedin the fields were flung,     and fallen laddersin the long grass lay     of the lush orchards;every tree there turned     its tangled headand eyed them secretly,     and the ears listenedof the nodding grasses;     though noontide glowed
 on land and leaf,     their limbs were chilled.And so the two travellers came to the doors of Nargothrond, in the gorge of the Narog:"|"The Children of Hurin"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"
