"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"Night came. The festivities continued under the light of torches. The humans fought their desire to vent their frustration and boredom. At last, long past midnight, Krazb, slurring his words, announced that it was time for all to go to bed. The drums and the horns ceased their ""music,"" and the merrymakers who had not passed out staggered off to their huts. A minor official, Wigshab, led the humans to a hut, told them that they were to spend the night there on a pile of blankets, and wobbled off."|"More Than Fire"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
12:00|noonday|"Next day, during the noonday halt, he went out into the woods for a pit call but stayed there to watch. Presently, Eleth left the campsite, seemingly for the same reason he had left it. Instead of selecting a tree behind which to squat, she went deeper into the forest. He followed her at a distance. When he saw her stop in a small clearing, he hid behind a bush."|"More Than Fire"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
12:00|noon|"""Here we make camp for the night,"" Kickaha said. He pointed to an area halfway up the steep three-peaked mass. ""By late noon tomorrow, if we push hard, we'll be there."""|"More Than Fire"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
00:00|midnight|"By then, a darkness not as black as midnight but blacker than the last gasp of dusk filled the pit. The wind was stronger and colder, though it was not in its full rage. Suddenly, a heavy rain fell upon them. Whips of lightning exploded near them. A few minutes later, water spilled over the edges of the pit. The water rose to Kickaha's ankles."|"More Than Fire"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
"~ 10:00"|"around ten in the morning"|"The sky was cloudless. The sun was at a height that made him believe that the time was around ten in the morning. The air seemed to be a few degrees above 75Â° Fahrenheit."|"More Than Fire"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
00:00|midnight|"Kickaha walked back to the bottom of the hill and went into the woods a few yards from the road. Here he waited for nightfall, meanwhile napping and then eating his own rations and drinking from his own canteen. Though he was theoretically immune to any disease, he did not want to chance the local food or the water. After a long time, midnight came. By then, the sky was overcast. But he wore the headband and its attached night-vision device. He worked uphill through the trees some distance from the road until he came to the wall. Though it was ten feet high, he got over it easily by throwing a grappling hook and climbing up the rope."|"More Than Fire"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
"ap 02:30"|"two hours and thirty minutes"|"""New plan,"" he said. ""Here's what you must do at once. Gate Anana into Cell Suite Three. Pick four trusted women servants to gate food and water and other necessary supplies to her and Red Orc while we're gone. Send all but fifty guards off on a paid vacation. Those left-and they must be the most trusted men you know-will continue the twenty-four-hour patrol. After that's done, close up the palace, bar all gates, lock all lowerstory windows. I give you two hours and thirty minutes to do the job. Then report to me. Be ready to go to Zazel's World."""|"More Than Fire"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
