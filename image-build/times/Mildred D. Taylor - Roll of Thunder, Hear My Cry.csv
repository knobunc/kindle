"ap 00:00"|twelve|"Stacey cut me a wicked look and I grew silent. His disposition had been irritatingly sour lately. If I hadn’t known the cause of it, I could have forgotten very easily that he was, at twelve, bigger than I, and that I had promised Mama to arrive at school looking clean and ladylike. “Shoot,” I mumbled finally, unable to restrain myself from further comment, “it ain’t my fault you gotta be in Mama’s class this year.”"|"Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry"|"Mildred D. Taylor"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"By ten o’clock, Miss Crocker had rearranged our seating and written our names on her seating chart. I was still sitting beside Gracey and Alma but we had been moved from the third to the first row in front of a small potbellied stove. Although being eyeball to eyeball with Miss Crocker was nothing to look forward to, the prospect of being warm once the cold weather set in was nothing to be sneezed at either, so I resolved to make the best of my rather dubious position."|"Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry"|"Mildred D. Taylor"
12:00|noon|"As we crossed the school lawn, Stacey beckoned Christopher-John, Little Man, and me aside. “Look,” he whispered, “meet me at the toolshed right at noon.”"|"Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry"|"Mildred D. Taylor"
12:00|noon|"At noon, we met as planned and ducked into the unlocked toolshed where all the church and school garden tools were kept. Stacey studied the tools available while the rest of us watched. Then, grabbing the only shovels, he handed one to me, holding on to the other himself, and directed Little Man and Christopher-John to each take two buckets."|"Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry"|"Mildred D. Taylor"
12:00|noon|"Expecting to see the yard-wide ditch we had dug at noon, we were not prepared for the twelve-foot lake which glimmered up at us."|"Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry"|"Mildred D. Taylor"
"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"“Hey, y’all,” Stacey said, standing and motioning us up. “Mama said she wanted us to take some milk and butter down to Miz Jackson before noon. We’d better get started.”"|"Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry"|"Mildred D. Taylor"
00:00|midnight|"Little Man, Christopher-John, and I took to Mr. Morrison immediately and had no objections to the cleaning. Anybody who was a friend of Papa’s was all right in our book; besides, when he was near, night men and burnings and midnight tarrings faded into a hazy distance. But Stacey remained aloof and had little to do with him."|"Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry"|"Mildred D. Taylor"
12:00|noontime|"“Come noontime though,” replied Little Willie, “T.J. was in them woods busy writing himself another set. Me and Moe seen him.”"|"Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry"|"Mildred D. Taylor"
03:30|"three-thirty in the morning"|"T.J., however, was surprisingly subdued when he settled into the wagon; I suppose that at three-thirty in the morning even T.J.’s mouth was tired. But by dawn, when the December sun was creeping warily upward shooting pale streams of buff-colored light through the forest, he was fully awake and chattering like a cockatoo. His endless talk made me wish that he had not managed to wheedle his way so speedily back into Stacey’s good graces, but Big Ma, her face furrowed in distant thoughts, did not hush him. He talked the rest of the way into Strawberry, announcing as we arrived, “Well, children, open your eyes and take in Strawberry, Mississippi!”"|"Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry"|"Mildred D. Taylor"
12:00|noon|"By noon the crowd which had covered the field during the early morning had thinned noticeably, and wagons and trucks began to pack up and head for town. After we had eaten our cold lunch of oil sausages and cornbread washed down with clabber milk, we did the same."|"Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry"|"Mildred D. Taylor"
00:00|midnight|"The day before Christmas I awoke to the soft murmuring of quiet voices gathered in the midnight blackness of morning. Big Ma was not beside me, and without a moment’s doubt I knew why she was gone. Jumping from the bed, my feet barely hitting the deerskin rug, I rushed into Mama’s room."|"Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry"|"Mildred D. Taylor"
"ap < 01:00"|"near one o’clock"|"Uncle Hammer stood also. “Guess I’ll turn in too. It’s near one o’clock.”"|"Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry"|"Mildred D. Taylor"
00:00|midnight|"Mr. Granger studied Uncle Hammer. Uncle Hammer wore, as he had every day since he had arrived, sharply creased pants, a vest over a snow-white shirt, and shoes that shone like midnight. “You right citified, ain’t you? Course you always did think you was too good to work in the fields like other folks.”"|"Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry"|"Mildred D. Taylor"
04:00|"four o’clock this morning"|"Mr. Jamison stared straight out at the road. “Jim Lee Barnett…he died at four o’clock this morning.”"|"Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry"|"Mildred D. Taylor"
