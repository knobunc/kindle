Nirdlinger, Los Angeles representative of the Western Pipe & Supply Company and for a number of years prominently identified with the oil industry here, was found on the railroad tracks about two miles north of this city shortly before midnight last night. Mr. Nirdlinger had departed on a northbound train earlier in the evening to attend his class reunion at Leland Stanford University, and it is believed he fell from the train. Police point out he had fractured his leg some weeks ago, and believe his unfamiliarity with crutches may have caused him to lose his balance on the observation platform, where he was last seen alive."|"Double Indemnity"|"James M.

"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"By four o’clock, the memos and telegrams were piled on Keyes’ desk so he had to put a weight on top of them to keep them from falling over, and he was mopping his brow and so peevish nobody could talk to him. But Norton was getting more cheerful by the minute. He took a San Francisco call from somebody named Jackson, and I could tell from what he said that it was this guy I had got rid of on the observation platform before I dropped off. When he hung up he put one more memo on top of the others and turned to Keyes. “Clear case of suicide.”"|"Double Indemnity"|"James M. Cain"
"ap ~ 10:00"|"about ten o’clock"|"I didn’t go to the inquest, Norton didn’t, and Keyes didn’t. No insurance company can afford to let a jury know, whether it’s a coroner’s jury or any other kind of jury, that a dead man is insured. It just gets murdered if that comes out. Two investigators were sent over, guys that look like everybody else and sit with the newspaper men. We got what happened from them. They all identified the body and told their story, Phyllis, the two conductors, the red-cap, the porter, a couple of passengers, the police, and especially this guy Jackson, that pounded it in that I tried to get rid of him. The jury brought in a verdict “that the said Herbert S. Nirdlinger came to his death by a broken neck received in a fall from a railroad train at or about ten o’clock on the night of June 3 in a manner unknown to this jury.” It took Norton by surprise. He really hoped for a suicide verdict. It didn’t me. The most important person at the inquest never said a word, and I had beat it into Phyllis’ head long before that he had to be there, because I had figured on this suicide stuff, and we had to be ready for it. That was the minister that she asked to come with her, to confer with the undertaker on arrangements for the funeral. Once a coroner’s jury sees that it’s a question of burial in consecrated ground, the guy could take poison, cut his throat, and jump off the end of a dock, and they would still give a verdict, “in a manner unknown to this jury.”"|"Double Indemnity"|"James M. Cain"
"~ 17:00"|"about five o’clock in the afternoon"|"After the investigators told their story, we sat around again, Norton, Keyes, and myself, in Norton’s office this time. It was about five o’clock in the afternoon. Keyes was sore. Norton was disappointed, but still trying to make it look like he had done the right thing. “Well, Keyes, we’re no worse off.”"|"Double Indemnity"|"James M. Cain"
00:00|midnight|"“They did better than that. They covered the observation car steward. He took a seat right by the door, to mark up his slips for the beginning of the trip, and he’s certain nobody was out there with Nirdlinger, because if anybody had passed him he would have had to move. He remembers Jackson going out there, about ten minutes before the train pulled out. He remembers the cripple going by. He remembers Jackson coming back. He remembers Jackson going out there again with the briefcase, and Jackson coming back, the second time. Jackson didn’t report the disappearance right away. He just figured Nirdlinger went in a washroom or something, and as a matter of fact it wasn’t till midnight, when he wanted to go to bed and he still had the briefcase that he supposed had Nirdlinger’s ticket in it, that he said anything to the conductor about it. Five minutes after that, at Santa Barbara, was where the Los Angeles yard-master caught the conductor with a wire and he impounded Nirdlinger’s baggage and began taking names. There was nobody out there. This guy fell off, that’s all. We’re sunk. It’s on the up-and-up.”"|"Double Indemnity"|"James M. Cain"
"ap 10:20"|10:20|"The lights began to look funny in front of my eyes. He started up again, checking over how Nirdlinger got knocked off. He said this guy, whoever he was, had left his car at Burbank, and dropped off the train there. He said she met him there, and they drove down in separate cars, with the corpse in one of them, to the place where they put the body on the track. He figured it up that she would have time to get to Burbank, and then get back in time to buy a pint of ice cream at the drugstore at 10:20, when she showed up there. He even had that. He was all wrong on how it was done, but he was so near right it made my lips turn numb just to listen to him."|"Double Indemnity"|"James M. Cain"
"ap ~ 04:00"|"About four o’clock"|"I spent half the afternoon trying to make up my mind whether to tell Keyes. I knew I ought to tell him, for my own protection. It was nothing that would be worth a nickel as evidence in court, and for that matter it was nothing that any court would admit as evidence, because that’s one break they give people, that they have to be tried for one thing at a time, and not for something somebody thinks they did two or three years before this happened. But it was something that would look mighty bad, if Keyes found out I knew it, and hadn’t told him. I couldn’t make myself do it. And I didn’t have any better reason than that this girl had asked me not to tell anybody, and I had promised.

"ap ~ 04:00"|"About four o’clock"|"About four o’clock I drove up through Griffith Park, and checked it over close, what I was going to do. I picked a spot for my car, and a spot for Sachetti’s car. They weren’t far apart, but the spot for my car was close to one end of the bridle path, where they ride horses in the daytime. It winds all over the hills there, but right above this place it comes out on the automobile road up above. I mean, up high in the hills. This park, they call it a park, but it’s really a scenic drive, up high above Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley, for people in cars, and a hilly ride for people on horses. People on foot don’t go there much. What I was going to do was let her get in and then start up the hill. When I came to one of those platforms where the road is graded to a little flat place so people can park and look over the valley, I was going to pull in, and say something about parking there, so we could talk. Only I wasn’t going to park. The car was accidentally on purpose, going to roll over the edge, and I was going to jump. As soon as I jumped I was going to dive into the bridle path, race on down to my car, and drive home. From where I was going to park Sachetti’s car to where I was going to run her over the edge was about two miles, by road. But by bridle path it was only a hundred yards, on account of the road winding all through the hills for an easy grade, and the bridle path being almost straight up and down. Less than a minute after the crash, before even a crowd could get there, I would be away and gone."|"Double Indemnity"|"James M. Cain"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"I drove up the hill and picked the place. It was one of the little lookouts, with room for just one or two cars, not one of the big ones. The big ones have stone parapets around them. This one didn’t have any. I got out and looked down. There was a drop of at least two hundred feet, straight, and probably another hundred feet after that where the car would roll after it struck. I practiced what I was going to do. I ran up to the edge, threw the gear in neutral, and pushed open the door. I made a note I would only half close my door when she got in, so I could open it quick. There was a chance she would grab the emergency as the car went over and save herself, and then have the drop on me. There was a chance I wouldn’t jump clear, and that I would go over the edge with her. That was O.K. On this, you have to take a chance. I ate dinner alone, at a big downtown sea-food house. The waiter knew me. I made a gag with him, to fix it on his mind it was Friday. When I finished I went back to the office and told Joe Pete I had to work. I stayed till ten o’clock.

I parked, cut the motor, took the key and turned off the lights. I walked over to Los Feliz, and from there down to Hollywood Boulevard. It’s about half a mile. I legged it right along, and got to the boulevard at 11:35. I boarded a street car and took a seat up front. When we got to La Brea it was five minutes to twelve. So far, my timing was perfect."|"Double Indemnity"|"James M. Cain"

"ap 00:00"|"twelve o’clock"|"I marched straight through, back to the auto court in the rear, where the people that live there keep their cars. Anyway, those of them that have cars. There was a collection of second, third, fourth and ninth-hand wrecks out there, and sure enough right in the middle was his. I got in, shoved the key in the ignition and started it. I cut on the lights and started to back. A car pulled in from the outside. I turned my head so I couldn’t be seen in the headlights, and backed on out. I drove up to Hollywood Boulevard. It was exactly twelve o’clock. I checked his gas. He had plenty."|"Double Indemnity"|"James M. Cain"
"ap 00:18"|12:18|"I took it easy, but still it was only 12:18 when I got back to Griffith Park. I drove up into Glendale, because I didn’t want to be more than two or three minutes ahead of time. I thought about Sachetti and how he was going to make out with his alibi. He didn’t have one, because that’s the worst alibi in the world to be home in bed, unless you’ve got some way to prove it, with phone calls or something. He didn’t have any way to prove it. He didn’t even have a phone."|"Double Indemnity"|"James M. Cain"

Then I wound down the window on the right hand side of the car, and sat there looking off in the bushes to see what it was. I must have stared out there at least a minute. Another twig cracked, closer this time. Then there was a flash, and something hit me in the chest like Jack Dempsey had hauled off and given me all he had. There was a shot. I knew then what had happened to me. I wasn’t the only one that figured the world wasn’t big enough for two people, when they knew that about each other. I had come there to kill her, but she had beaten me to it."|"Double Indemnity"|"James M. Cain"

"ap ~ 03:00"|"About three o’clock"|"About three o’clock the orderly came in with the afternoon papers. They didn’t have any of what I had told Keyes. But they had been digging into their files, after the morning story, and they had it about the first Mrs. Nirdlinger’s death, and Nirdlinger’s death, and now me being shot. A woman feature writer had got in out there and talked with Phyllis. It was she that called it the House of Death, and put in about those blood-red drapes. Once I saw that stuff I knew it wouldn’t be long. That meant even a dumb cluck of a woman reporter could see there was something funny out there."|"Double Indemnity"|"James M. Cain"

When he came back he had Norton with him, and a man named Keswick that was a corporation lawyer they called in on big cases, and Shapiro, the regular head of the legal department. They all stood around, and it was Norton that started to speak. “Huff.”"|"Double Indemnity"|"James M. Cain"

That was yesterday. I sent it out by the orderly to be registered, and around five o’clock Keyes dropped by for the receipt. It’ll be more than he bargained for, but I wanted to put it all down. Maybe she’ll see it some time, and not think so bad of me after she understands how it all was. Around seven o’clock I put on my clothes. I was weak, but I could walk. After a bite to eat I sent for a taxi and went down to the pier. I went to bed right away, and stayed there till early this afternoon. Then I couldn’t stand it any longer, alone there in the stateroom, and went up on deck. I found my chair and sat there looking at the coast of Mexico, where we were going past it. But I had a funny feeling I wasn’t going anywhere. I kept thinking about Keyes, and the look he had in his eye that day, and what he meant by what he said. Then, all of a sudden, I found out. I heard a little gasp beside me. Before I even looked I knew who it was. I turned to the next chair. It was Phyllis."|"Double Indemnity"|"James M. Cain"

She’s made her face chalk white, with black circles under her eyes and red on her lips and cheeks. She’s got that red thing on. It’s awful-looking. It’s just one big square of red silk that she wraps around her, but it’s got no armholes, and her hands look like stumps underneath it when she moves them around. She looks like what came aboard the ship to shoot dice for souls in the Rime of the Ancient Mariner."|"Double Indemnity"|"James M. Cain"
