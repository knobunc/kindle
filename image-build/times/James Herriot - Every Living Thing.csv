12:00|"twelve noon"|"As the road climbed higher I began to see the church tower and roofs of Darrowby and, at last, on the edge of the town, the gates of Mrs. Pumphrey’s beautiful home lay beckoning. I looked at my watch—twelve noon. Long practice had enabled me to time my visits here just before lunch when I could escape the rigours of country practice and wallow for a little while in the hospitality of the elderly widow who had brightened my life for so long."|"Every Living Thing"|"James Herriot"

"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"It was indeed a long night. We took turns at walking the horse when he showed signs of going down. Siegfried repeated his injections, varying the treatment between sedatives and muscular relaxants with another cautious shot of arecoline, and at five o’clock he used the stomach tube again to give magnesium sulphate. And all the time as we dosed and yawned, slumped on the hay, we looked for a genuine easing of the pain, a raising of the animal’s depression and most of all for a movement of the bowels."|"Every Living Thing"|"James Herriot"
"ap ~ 06:00"|"around six o’clock"|"Over the half-door of the box I could see the gradual disappearance of the stars and a lightening of the eastern sky. At around six o’clock, as the birds began to sing in the chestnut trees and the grey light of dawn crept into the box, Siegfried stood up and stretched."|"Every Living Thing"|"James Herriot"
03:00|"three o’clock in the morning"|"From then on, I had to live with an ever-increasing flood of requests for the services of a young man who wasn’t me. However, it was only depressing for a short time, because the compensations were enormous. As John settled in to the practice I found a miraculous easing of my life. It was rather wonderful to have an assistant, especially a good one like him. I had always liked him, but when I got a call to a calving heifer at three o’clock in the morning and was able to pass it on to him and turn over and go to sleep, I could feel the liking deepening into a warm affection."|"Every Living Thing"|"James Herriot"
"~ 17:00"|"Around five o’clock that afternoon"|"Around five o’clock that afternoon, with heavy rain sweeping along on the wind, I was drawing up outside the surgery when I froze in my seat. I was looking out at something terrible. Several of the Squire’s men were carrying a body down the street. It was John. As I got out of the car they bore him into the house and deposited him at the foot of the stairs. He seemed to be unconscious."|"Every Living Thing"|"James Herriot"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"“You forgot ’em, didn’t you! ‘Come down this afternoon,’ you said. ‘They’ll be in the box at the door for you.’ Well, I came down at three o’clock, but there was nowt in the box and nobody knew a thing about it. Ah’m bloody cross, I tell ye!”"|"Every Living Thing"|"James Herriot"

"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"“You did an’ all, and then you said, ‘At first he’ll pass exackly a handful, just like this.’ ? He cupped his hands to illustrate. “And right on two o’clock that’s what ’e did. No more, no less.”"|"Every Living Thing"|"James Herriot"
"ap 02:30"|"half past two"|"“Aye, and then you said, ‘At half past two he’ll pass just enough to fill that small shovel.’ ? Mr. Dowson hurried busily over to the house and picked up a little shovel that stood by the coal-bunker. He held it out to me. “There’s the very thing. And right on the dot by my watch he passed just the amount you said. I measured it.”"|"Every Living Thing"|"James Herriot"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"“You can believe me or believe me not. Then you said, ‘At three o’clock he’ll have a good clear-out,’ and that’s just what happened.

"ap < 02:30"|"nearly two thirty"|"However, it was no use brooding. We had to have another assistant, and since our advertisement in The Veterinary Record had been successful, there was one on his way to us at this moment. I looked at my watch.

I wasn’t surprised when, around eight o’clock, the big white flakes began to drift down and within an hour the countryside was blanketed in white. The snow stopped then and I was grateful, because a heavy fall made it almost impossible to reach some of the high farms. A shovel was essential equipment."|"Every Living Thing"|"James Herriot"

“Eight o’clock on the dot.”
At the appointed time I climbed the stair to the flat and received an effusive welcome. Calum sat me down with a drink and as he went through to the kitchen I looked round the little sitting room. It was exactly as when he walked in that first day. Other occupants had added or altered things according to their taste but Calum had not the slightest interest in carpets, curtains or furniture. The table was bare except for two sets of knives and forks and salt and pepper."|"Every Living Thing"|"James Herriot"

That sounded a bit thin to me—we’ve had a lot of petty break-ins and thieving lately—so we’ve brought him in to the station.”"|"Every Living Thing"|"James Herriot"

On that special day I invariably felt light-hearted as soon as I awoke, knowing that by midday Helen and I would be off to Brawton, free as birds. A leisurely lunch at one of the town’s splendid cafes, then we would meet my pal Gordon Rae, the vet from Boroughbridge, and his wife, Jean, fellow escapees from the telephone and the wellington boots, and we would spend the day shopping, followed by tea and the cinema. It doesn’t sound like much, but to us it was a blessed relief."|"Every Living Thing"|"James Herriot"
