He, or she, along with perhaps a dozen assistants, had rushed through Cromer Gardens at high noon, throwing crabs and periwinkles all over the streets.

They climbed high walls to dump some of the fish into gardens and onto the roofs of houses."|"Schrodinger's Cat Trilogy"|"Robert Anton Wilson"

If any attempt is made to apprehend and arrest us—any attempt at all—all the remaining bombs will be detonated at once.We demand:That President Furbish Lousewart immediately confiscate all fortunes above one million dollars;That this money, which we calculate makes a sum of approximately three trillion dollars, be distributed at once to the forty million families, who are, according to the government’s own standards, living below the poverty line, so that each poor family receives $75,000;That all government money presently invested in weapons of war and preparations for war be immediately redirected to improving schools, homes, and hospitals in poor neighborhoods, so as to make them fit for human beings;That George Washington be removed from the dollar bill and replaced by Walt Disney’s Mickey Mouse to remind people forever of the idiocy of worshiping money.A final word of warning: We have been working on this project for sixteen years and have the full capacity to do all that we say.

He tied them very firmly—and then, to her relief, no weapon was produced. He didn’t even produce his own weapon; it was entirely oral. After five orgasms, she found him sitting up and lighting a joint. In a minute, he held it to her own lips. “For the big one,” he said. She toked hungrily while he kissed and caressed her and muttered endearments—but she could still feel the ropes.
