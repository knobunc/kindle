"ap ~ 08:00"|"about eight o’clock"|"Sitting-room of the Black Bull Inn, Grindle Moor, North Yorkshire, a moorlandinn of the farmhouse type that serves as the local ‘pub’ and also takes a few guests. The room is simply furnished in the style of a north-country farmhouse sitting-room. On the left, is a long low window, deeply set, with a cushioned seat, and the sunlight is streaming in through this window. At the back, on the left, is a door that serves as an entrance to the Inn to the people staying there, but not to people who merely go for a drink or a meal. On the right at the back is the door that leads to the dining-room, the bar and the rest of the Inn, including two of the guest bedrooms. Through this door a passage can be seen. Downstage right is a slighter door, leading to two bedrooms; it opens directly on to a steep flight of stairs. Through the main door, when open, can be seen a distant glimpse of high-moorland. The fireplace of the room is presumed to be in the fourth wall. On the right is an old-fashioned sofa, and a table towards centre. A couple of shabby but comfortable easy chairs, not too large, at either side of this table, and two or three smaller chairs near walls. Near door to the dining-room is a telephone attached to the wall. It is an evening in June, about eight o’clock. The room is empty at rise of curtain, but immediately afterwards SALLY PRATT  enters bringing in some flowers. She is a pleasant-looking country-woman in her middle thirties and is nicely dressed, but wears an apron as if she were still busy with household work. She speaks in a rather loud tone and with a north-country accent, but not too broad. After a moment or two, SAM SHIPLEY enters. He is a stout, humorous, contented Yorkshireman in his sixties. He is in his shirt-sleeves and is smoking apipe. His accent is broader than his daughter’s, but not very broad."|"An Inspector Calls and Other Plays"|"J. B. Priestley"
"ap 08:30"|"half-past eight"|"SALLY: Excuse me, Mrs Ormund. But I just wanted to tell you that we have breakfast at half-past eight, if that’s not too early."|"An Inspector Calls and Other Plays"|"J. B. Priestley"

[coming forward]: That’s all right. And no tea. And no breakfast either. Just a pot of strong coffee for me – about half past nine."|"An Inspector Calls and Other Plays"|"J. B. Priestley"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"[DR GÖRTLER looks out of the door a moment longer, then leaving it wide open, crosses and goes up to his room through the staircase door. The clock chimes and strikes ten. During the final strokes, ORMUND enters followed by SAM, leaving door open behind them.]"|"An Inspector Calls and Other Plays"|"J. B. Priestley"
"ap ~ 00:50"|"about ten to one"|"REX: I don’t see anything lasting. If you ask me, we’ve had it. And you can take your choice between a lot of Trade Union officials giving themselves jobs and titles or Tory Big Business screaming to get back into the trough. All the same racket. Either way we’ve had it. We can’t last. And anyhow when the atom bombs and rockets really start falling, whichever side sends ’em, it’s about ten to one we’ll be on the receiving end here. I’ve sometimes thought of clearing out – South America, for instance, or East Africa – but somehow I feel that wouldn’t do. So I’ll take what’s coming. But before then I propose to enjoy myself."|"An Inspector Calls and Other Plays"|"J. B. Priestley"

[When curtain rises, a minute later, for opening of Scene Two, at night, several hours later, curtains are drawn across window and artificial lighting is on. This lighting should not be as general as it was in Act One, Scene Two, but more intimate, perhaps making use of large standard lamp downstage L. Door is half-open. DINAH and MRS COTTON are conferring. DINAH is holding several small shop-keeping books, while MRS COTTON is perched on arm of chair, still smoking a cigarette and holding a cup of tea. We feel that this housekeeping conference, for that is what it is, has been on some time. DINAH is puzzling over one of the small books, which she holds open  frowning at it, and MRS COTTON is watching her, and nothing is said for a few moments.]"|"An Inspector Calls and Other Plays"|"J.
