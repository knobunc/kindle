Moore, a University of Chicago pathologist, concluded from experiments that the minimum amount of time that a tick needed to attach to a guinea pig in order to infect it was one hour and forty-five minutes, and on average it had to stay in place, feeding on the host, for ten hours. Based on this research, Cooley instructed Birdseye and King to stop their work every two hours to inspect each other’s bodies for ticks. They did occasionally find a tick, but neither ever contracted spotted fever, either because of luck or because Moore was right about the necessary feeding time."|Birdseye|"Mark Kurlansky"

She didn’t like the way the midday meal used up too much of the working day and thought that all of these bad work habits explained why they were still utterly dependent on England for all their goods, which, she added, made the local shopping “most unsatisfactory.”"|Birdseye|"Mark Kurlansky"

Bob writes in his journal when the pup gets his first teeth and when he has “a copious movement” due to the use of castor oil. Finally, on May 18, 1916, Birdseye reported that the pup died at 6:00 a.m. of acute indigestion."|Birdseye|"Mark Kurlansky"
12:00|midday|"He started working in a shipping office and, at age seventeen, invented an improved bilge pump. A few years later he started a business shipping ice to the Caribbean, particularly Martinique and Cuba. He shipped it carefully insulated in hay but noticed that Caribbeans, understanding nothing about the nature of ice, let it melt as they walked through the street with it in the midday sun or even dissolved it as they attempted to store it in water. In the 1820s Tudor hired Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth, another man who had shunned education. Jarvis revolutionized the ice business, first with a saw-toothed ice cutter that made the blocks more regular and produced them more cheaply, and then with the use of sawdust for insulation. Wyeth produced a series of inventions that by the 1830s made Tudor’s facility the premier icehouse in America. Tudor’s ice, much of it cut from Henry David Thoreau’s Walden Pond, was shipped all over the world."|Birdseye|"Mark Kurlansky"

This was an age when prime fish such as salmon and halibut were being landed in enormous quantities and sold at low prices. But only the fish that had not sold while fresh was sold to the freezing companies, so frozen fish started out at a very low quality."|Birdseye|"Mark Kurlansky"
