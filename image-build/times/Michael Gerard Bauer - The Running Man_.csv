02:00|"two a.m."|"The clock on the side table glowed two a.m. Joseph twisted around to look out the window at Leytons’ house, where a faint light still shone from what Joseph imagined was Tom Leyton’s room. He was about to lie back down when a movement in the neighbours’ yard caught his eye. Someone was behind the big mulberry tree that arched over the old incinerator by the side fence. Joseph waited. The figure moved slowly to the front of the tree. Although the moonlight yielded only a vague outline, Joseph knew he was looking at Tom Leyton."|"The Running Man_"|"Michael Gerard Bauer"
00:00|midnight|"It was close to midnight, long after his mother had gone to bed, that Joseph saw the last light in their neighbours’ house go out. As he walked across Leytons’ lawn towards the stairs he recalled his first visit and the feeling of foreboding that had engulfed him. Now he felt only numb with emptiness. At the top of the stairs he opened out the portrait of Tom Leyton, slipped one edge under the bottom of the door and pushed it in."|"The Running Man_"|"Michael Gerard Bauer"
"< 00:00"|"near midnight"|"It was near midnight before Joseph went to bed. The evening had passed slowly, as he and his mother kept their fears to themselves. They watched in silence as the television news showed helicopter footage of huge tracts of mountainside lying crumbled and wasted like a child’s sandcastle. The authorities still had not released the names of the missing or injured men. After the first reports in the paper, further storms and landslides had severed communication links and made access to the area difficult."|"The Running Man_"|"Michael Gerard Bauer"
