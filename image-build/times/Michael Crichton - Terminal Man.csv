12:00|noon|"They came down to the emergency ward at noon and sat on the bench just behind the swinging doors that led in from the ambulance parking slot. Ellis was nervous, preoccupied, distant. Morris was relaxed, eating a candy bar and crumpling the wrapper into the pocket of his white jacket."|"Terminal Man"|"Michael Crichton"
15:30|"3:30 that afternoon"|"To change the subject, Morris said, ""Are we all set for three-thirty?"" At 3:30 that afternoon, Benson would be presented to the hospital staff at a special Neurosurgical Rounds."|"Terminal Man"|"Michael Crichton"

"ap 09:00"|nine|"Neurosurgical Grand Rounds, where unusual cases were presented and discussed by all the surgeons of the hospital, were normally scheduled for Thursdays at nine. Special rounds were hardly ever called; it was too difficult for the staff to get together. But now the amphitheater was packed, tier after tier of white jackets and pale faces staring down at Ellis, who pushed his glasses up on his nose and said, ""As many of you know, tomorrow morning the Neuropsychiatric Research Unit will perform a limbic pacing procedure—what we call a stage three—on a human patient."""|"Terminal Man"|"Michael Crichton"
02:00|"2 a.m."|"But after several years it was no longer wonderful. The box was inhuman and implacable, and it had come to symbolize for him the fact that he was not his own man. He was perpetually on call to some higher authority, however whimsical—a nurse who wanted to confirm a medication order at 2 a.m.; a relative who was acting up, making trouble about Mama's post-operative treatment; a call to tell him a conference was being held when he was already there attending the damned conference."|"Terminal Man"|"Michael Crichton"
"ap 06:30"|6:30|"Morris hung up. He got onto the elevator and pressed the button for the seventh floor. His beeper went off a third time. He checked his watch; it was 6:30 and he was supposedly off-duty by now. But he answered it anyway. It was Kelso, the pediatric resident."|"Terminal Man"|"Michael Crichton"
06:00|"6 a.m."|"At 6 a.m. Janet Ross was on the third surgical floor, dressed in greens, having coffee and a doughnut. The surgeons' lounge was busy at this hour. Although operations were scheduled to begin at six, most didn't get going for fifteen or twenty minutes after that. The surgeons sat around, reading the newspaper, discussing the stock market and their golf games. From time to time one of them would leave, go to the overhead viewing galleries, and look down on their ORs to see how preparations were coming."|"Terminal Man"|"Michael Crichton"

"ap 06:19"|6:19|"Ellis finished looking at the X-rays and glanced up at the clock. It was 6:19; Benson was still outside being checked by the anaesthetist. Ellis walked around the room, talking briefly to everyone. He was being unusually friendly, and Ross wondered why. She looked up at the viewing gallery and saw the director of the hospital, the chief of surgery, the chief of medicine, and the chief of research all looking down through the glass. Then she understood."|"Terminal Man"|"Michael Crichton"

"ap 01:12"|"one hour and twelve minutes"|"""Well,"" Ellis said, ""let's hook him up."" He painstakingly attached the forty fine wire leads from the two electrode arrays to the plastic unit. Then he fitted the wires down along the neck, tucked the plastic under the skin, and called for sutures. The elapsed-time clock read one hour and twelve minutes."|"Terminal Man"|"Michael Crichton"
18:00|"6 p.m."|"At 6 p.m., Roger McPherson, head of the Neuropsychiatric Research Unit, went up to the seventh floor to check on his patient. At least, that was how he thought of Benson—as his patient. A proprietary feeling, but not entirely incorrect. Without McPherson, there would be no NPS, and without an NPS, there would be no surgery, no Benson. That was how he thought of it."|"Terminal Man"|"Michael Crichton"

She looked at the chair opposite her. Then, aloud, she said, ""How're we doing?"""|"Terminal Man"|"Michael Crichton"
00:00|midnight|"She nodded. This was the final stage in Benson's treatment, and it had to be done before tranquilizers could be administered. Benson had been kept on sedation with phenobarbital until midnight the night before. He would be clearheaded this morning, and ready for interfacing."|"Terminal Man"|"Michael Crichton"
"ap ~ 05:00"|"About five"|"Richards nodded. ""How old would you say?""
""About five or six, at most.""
Benson was talking about cookies, talking about his tricycle, to Ross. Slowly, over the next few minutes, he seemed to emerge like a time-traveler advancing through the years. Finally he became fully adult again, thinking back to his youth, instead of actually being there. ""I always wanted the cookies, and she would never give them to me. She said they were bad for me and would give me cavities."""|"Terminal Man"|"Michael Crichton"

12:00|noon|"At noon, McPherson showed up for interfacing. No one was surprised to see him. In a sense, this was the irrevocable step; everything preceding it was unimportant. They had implanted electrodes and a computer and a power pack, and they had hooked everything up. But nothing functioned until the interfacing switches were thrown. It was a little like building an automobile and then finally turning the ignition."|"Terminal Man"|"Michael Crichton"

"ap 00:15"|12:15|"She looked at her watch. Christ, it was only 12:15. She had half the day ahead of her. What was it like to be a pediatrician? Probably fun. Tickling babies and giving shots and advising mothers on toilet training. Not a bad way to live."|"Terminal Man"|"Michael Crichton"
23:00|"11 p.m."|"For no particular reason, Janet Ross came back to the hospital at 11 p.m. She had gone to see a movie with a pathology resident who had been asking her for weeks; finally she had relented. They had seen a murder mystery, which the resident claimed was the only kind of movie he attended. This one featured five murders before she stopped counting them. In the darkness, she had glanced at the resident, and he was smiling. His reaction was so stereotyped—the pathologist drawn to violence and death—that she found herself thinking of the other stereotypes in medicine: the sadistic surgeons and the childish pediatricians and the woman-hating gynecologists. And the crazy psychiatrists."|"Terminal Man"|"Michael Crichton"

Benson had been quite normal—and suddenly he had lashed out against the wall, striking it viciously, picking up his chair, smashing it against the wall.

Six a.m., he thought. There wasn't much time."|"Terminal Man"|"Michael Crichton"
