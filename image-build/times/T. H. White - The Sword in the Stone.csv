It was more like a town or a village  than  any  one  man's  home,  and  indeed  it was the  village  during  all  times  of  danger.  Whenever  there  was  a  raid  or an invasion, everybody on the estate  hurried  into  the  castle,  driving  all the beasts  before  them  into  the  courts,  and  there  they  remained  until  the danger  was  over.  The  little  wattle  and  daub  cottages  nearly  always  got burned, and had to be built again afterwards with much profanity.  For  this reason  it  was  not  worth  while  troubling  to  have  a  village  church,  as  it would constantly be having to be replaced. The villagers  went  to church  in the  chapel  of the  castle.  They  wore  their  best  clothes  and  trooped  up  the street with their most respectable gait on Sundays, looking  with  vague  and dignified  looks in  all directions,  as if  reluctant  to  disclose  their  destination, and  on  week-days  they  came  to  mass  and  vespers  in  their  ordinary clothes, walking much more cheerfully.

"ap 03:00"|Three|"It ought  perhaps  to be  explained,  before  we  go  any  further,  that  in those  far-off  days,  when  there  was  actually  a  college  for  Witches  and Warlocks  under  the  sea  at  Dom-Daniel  and  when  all  wizards  were  either black  or  white,  there  was  a  good  deal  of  ill-feeling  between  the  different creeds.  Quarrels  between  white  and  black  were  settled  ceremonially,  by means of duels. A wizard's duel was run like this.  The  two principals  would stand opposite each other in some large  space  free  from  obstructions,  and await the  signal  to begin.  When  the  signal  was  given  they  were  at  liberty to  turn  themselves  into  things.  It  was  rather  like  the  game  that  can  be played  by  two  people  with  their  fists.  They  say  One,  Two,  Three,  and  at Three  they  either  stick  out  two  fingers  for  scissors,  or  the  flat  palm  for paper,  or  the  clenched  fist  for  stone.  If  your  hand  becomes  paper  when your  opponent's  become  scissors,  then  he  cuts  you  and  wins:  but  if  yours has  turned  into  stone,  his scissors  are  blunted,  and  the  win  is  yours.  The object  of  the  wizard  in  the  duel  was,  to  turn  himself  into  some  kind  of animal,  vegetable  or  mineral  which  would  destroy  the  particular  animal, vegetable or mineral which had been selected by his opponent.

Robin  had  insisted  on  this,  saying  that  no  man could shoot with another's bow any  more  than  he  could  cut  with  another's scythe. For their  midday  meal  they  had  cold  venison  pattie,  with  mead,  as also did everybody else. The outlaws drifted in for the meal like a conjuring trick.  At one  moment  there  would  be  nobody  at  the  edge  of  the  clearing, at the next half a dozen right inside it: green  or sun-burned  men  who  had silently  in  materialized  out  of  the  bracken  or  the  trees.  In  the  end  there were about a hundred of them, eating merrily and laughing. The  food  was dished out from a leafy bower, where Marian and her attendants cooked. The  outlaws  usually  posted  a  sentry  to  take  the  tree  messages,  and slept during the afternoon, partly because so much of their  hunting  had  to be  done  in  the  times  when  most  workmen  sleep,  and  partly  because generally  the  wild  beasts  take a  nap  in  the  afternoon  and  so  should  their hunters.
