"ap 04:50"|"ten minutes to five"|"Wickedly scheming, he would limp and cackle through the cold corridors of the castle, planning new impossible feats for the suitors of Saralinda to perform. He did not wish to give her hand in marriage, since her hand was the only warm hand in the castle. Even the hands of his watch and the hands of all the thirteen clocks were frozen. They had all frozen at the same time, on a snowy night, seven years before, and after that it was always ten minutes to five in the castle. Travelers and mariners would look up at the gloomy castle on the lonely hill and say, “Time lies frozen there. It’s always Then. It’s never Now.”"|"The 13 Clocks"|"James Thurber"
"ap 04:50"|"ten minutes to five"|"The Duke limped because his legs were of different lengths. The right one had outgrown the left because, when he was young, he had spent his mornings place-kicking pups and punting kittens. He would say to a suitor, “What is the difference in the length of my legs?” and if the youth replied, “Why, one is shorter than the other,” the Duke would run him through with the sword he carried in his swordcane and feed him to the geese. The suitor was supposed to say, “Why, one is longer than the other.” Many a prince had been run through for naming the wrong difference. Others had been slain for offenses equally trivial: trampling the Duke’s camellias, failing to praise his wines, staring too long at his gloves, gazing too long at his niece. Those who survived his scorn and sword were given incredible labors to perform in order to win his niece’s hand, the only warm hand in the castle, where time had frozen to death at ten minutes to five one snowy night. They were told to cut a slice of moon, or change the ocean into wine. They were set to finding things that never were, and building things that could not be. They came and tried and failed and disappeared and never came again. And some, as I have said, were slain, for using names that start with X, or dropping spoons, or wearing rings, or speaking disrespectfully of sin."|"The 13 Clocks"|"James Thurber"

I give you nine and ninety hours, not nine and ninety days, to find a thousand jewels and bring them here. When you return, the clocks must all be striking five.”"|"The 13 Clocks"|"James Thurber"
"ap 04:50"|"ten minutes of five"|"The Prince looked at the two clocks on the walls. Their hands pointed to ten minutes of five. “The hands are frozen,” said the Prince. “The clocks are dead.”"|"The 13 Clocks"|"James Thurber"
00:00|midnight|"The Duke and Hark and Listen laughed. “Time is wasting, Prince,” the Duke reminded him. “Already you have only eight and ninety hours. I wish you every strangest kind of luck.” A wide oak door suddenly opened at the end of the room, and the Prince saw lightning and midnight and falling rain. “One last word and warning,” said the Duke. “I would not trust the Golux overfar. He cannot tell what can be from what can’t. He seldom knows what should be from what is.”"|"The 13 Clocks"|"James Thurber"
"ap 05:00"|five|"The Prince glanced at Hark and at the Duke, and at a spot where he thought Listen stood. “When all the clocks are striking five,” he said, and left the room. The laughter of the Duke and Hark and Listen followed him out the door and down the stairs and into the darkness. When he had gone a few steps from the castle, he looked up at a lighted window and thought he saw the Princess Saralinda standing there. A rose fell at his feet, and as he picked it up, the laughter of the Duke and Hark and Listen increased inside the black oak room and died away."|"The 13 Clocks"|"James Thurber"

“It sails at midnight,” Hark corrected him.
“I can’t remember everything,” the Golux said. “My father’s clocks were always slow. He also lacked the power of concentration.”"|"The 13 Clocks"|"James Thurber"
