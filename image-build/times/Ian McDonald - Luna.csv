"ap 11:00"|eleven|"The legal battles were furious and, for the moon, brief. Within a lune Robson was in a Mackenzie Metals railcar hurrying across the Oceanus Procellarum, Hoang Lam Hung in the seat opposite and a squad of blades deployed at a discreet distance, serving no other purpose than to embody the power of Mackenzie Metals. The Court of Clavius had ruled: Robson Corta was a Mackenzie now. At eleven-and-some Robson could not identify the look on Hoang’s face. At thirteen he knows it as the face of a man who has been forced to betray the thing he loves. Then he saw the bright star on the horizon, the light of Crucible blazing in endless noon, and it changed from the star of welcome to the star of hell. Robson remembers the orixas of Boa Vista, their immense stone faces carved from raw rock a constant presence and reassurance that life resisted the cold brutality of the moon. Oxala, Yemanja, Xango, Oxum, Ogun, Oxossi, Ibeji the Twins, Omolu, Iansa, Nana. He can still name their counterparts among the Catholic saints and list their attributes. In the Cortas’ private religion there was little divinity, less theology and no promise of heaven or hell. Endless return. It was natural, spirits recycled as the Zabbaleen recycled the carbon, water, minerals of the discarded body. Hell was pointless, cruel and unusual. Robson still cannot understand why a god would want to punish someone forever when there was no possibility that the punishment would achieve any good."|Luna|"Ian McDonald"

At midnight on the third day the repairs are complete and Wagner and Zehra rest from their labours. The rover gleams under the floods. To the inexpert eye it is the same beaten six-wheeler towed into Hypatia main lock and pushed by its exhausted crew into the repair bay. That eye can’t see the beauty of the new modules and motors; the fresh wiring and routing; the parts custom-designed by Wagner, bespoke-printed, hand-fitted by Zehra."|Luna|"Ian McDonald"

He walked without aid or support or pause and it took him an hour to complete. After two lunes he ran the mezzanine ring. After three lunes, Lucas Corta slept there. The first night he felt a brass demon crouch on his chest and shit molten lead into his heart and lungs. The second night, the third the fourth. After fifteen nights he slept a full night with only nightmares of being trapped beneath the iron ice of a steel sea. After that he slept in three lunar gravities every night."|Luna|"Ian McDonald"

The floor dropped out of his stomach, gee forces took hold as the tether accelerated the capsule into a docking orbit with the SSTO. Lucas had made a tether transfer once before, escaping from the moon, when the Moonloop had snatched him from the top of the tower and slung him into a transfer orbit with the cycler. Acceleration had peaked at three, four lunar gravities. This was far beyond the Moonloop. Lucas felt his lips peel back from his teeth, his eyes flatten in their sockets, the blood pool in the back of his skull. He couldn’t breathe."|Luna|"Ian McDonald"

Juddering, the mirrors turn their faces to catch the sun. The mirror field blazes so bright the men in Control throw their hands up in front of their eyes before the photo-chromic glass reacts and brings the shafts of blazing, dusty light down to bearable levels. The power of the Mackenzies has always been the sun. Hadley’s mirror array had been the envy of two worlds, the summit of solar-smelting technology, but it had not been enough for Robert Mackenzie. For the fourteen days of the lunar night, the mirrors were dark, the smelter cold. He had conceived a smelter that would never go dark, that would always have the high noon sun pouring into its mirrors. He built Crucible. The Suns boast of their spire-palace, the Pavilion of Eternal Light. A cheap boast, a fortune of location and selenography. The Mackenzies engineered their endless noonday. They shaped the moon itself to create it."|Luna|"Ian McDonald"

She’s got a belt of old dirty printed money from clients, some curry noodle and moon-cakes for the festival and she’s on her way home to Ariel."|Luna|"Ian McDonald"

The legend in Barra was that he once trained to be a Catholic priest. Alexia believed it. ‘What do you think?’ He swivelled the screen to show the fighters in the cage.
‘Which one am I looking at, Seu Osvaldo?’

With cake it’s flour, sugar, fat, eggs or some other kind of liquid. Take two-fifty grams flour, two-fifty grams sugar, two-fifty grams butter, two-fifty grams eggs, which is about five. That’s your basic kilo-cake. You cream the sugar and butter. I do it by hand. It makes it personal. The fat encases the air bubbles and creates a foam. Now you beat the eggs in. Eggs have proteins that wrap around your air bubbles and stop them exploding and collapsing when they’re heated. Then you fold in the flour. You fold it in because if you beat flour too hard you’ll stretch the gluten."|Luna|"Ian McDonald"
