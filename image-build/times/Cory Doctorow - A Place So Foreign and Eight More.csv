19:01|1901|"Pa's ambassadorial mission meant that he often spent long weeks
away from home, teleporting in only for Sunday dinner, the stink of
aliens and distant worlds clinging to him even after he washed up.
The last Sunday dinner I had with him, Mama had made mashed
potatoes and corn bread and sausage gravy and turkey, spending the
whole day with the wood-fired cooker back in 1898 (actually, it was
1901 by then, but I always thought of it as 1898). She'd moved the
cooker into the horsebarn after a week of wrestling with the
gadgets we had in our 1975 kitchen, and when Pa had warned her that
the smoke was going to raise questions in New Jerusalem, she
explained that she was going to run some flexible exhaust hose
through the door into 75 and into our apt's air-scrubber. Pa had
shook his head and smiled at her, and every Sunday, she dragged the
exhaust pipe through the door."|"A Place So Foreign and Eight More"|"Cory Doctorow"

at 8:00 that morning. He was tall, like my Pa, but Pa had been as
big as an ox, and Mr Adelson was thin and wiry. He wore rumpled
pants and a shirt with a wilted celluloid collar. He had a skinny
little beard that made him look like a gentleman pirate, and used
some shiny pomade to grease his hair straight back from his high
forehead. I caught him reading, thumbing the hand-written pages of
a leatherbound volume."|"A Place So Foreign and Eight More"|"Cory Doctorow"

he paused, waited until I met his gaze. His eyebrows were at rest.
""I'm sorry about your father. I'd met him several times. He was a
good man."""|"A Place So Foreign and Eight More"|"Cory Doctorow"

flashed a clock on its chest-plate: 0800 0800 0800. It was my old
school-alarm. It snapped me back to reality. My Mama was going to
whip me raw! She must've been worried sick."|"A Place So Foreign and Eight More"|"Cory Doctorow"
