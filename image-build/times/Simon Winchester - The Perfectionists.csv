It was easy enough—if time consuming—to adjust the length of a pendulum until it ticked away at the rate of 1/86,400 of the period between two sun-at-zenith moments we call noon. Easier still to apply the equation from schooldays, of T=2π√lg where l is the length of the pendulum, g is the acceleration of gravity, and T is the time taken by each beat of the pendulum."|"The Perfectionists"|"Simon Winchester"

Each was taken to a ship and used by the crew as timekeeper, and each time, though the timekeeper offered an improvement on surmising the ships’ various positions, the accuracy of the vessel’s clock-derived longitude was wildly at variance from what the Board of Longitude demanded—and so no prize was awarded. Harrison’s genius and determination were recognized, though, and hefty grants continued to come his way in the hope that he would, in time, make a horological breakthrough. And this he did, at last, when between the four years from 1755 until 1759 he made not another clock, but a watch, a watch that has been known, since it was cleaned and restored in the 1930s, simply as H4.*"|"The Perfectionists"|"Simon Winchester"
00:00|midnight|"Among these reforms was a subject that the teenage Hattori found especially fascinating: the passage of time. The boy had developed an infatuation with clocks, a topic which in the Japan of the day was a matter of exceptional complexity. For Japanese timekeeping was unique. Clockmakers had learned the basics of mechanical horology from visiting Jesuits, but these clerics threw their hands up in puzzlement at the fugitive nature of the local version of timekeeping. Hours in Old Japan were of varying lengths. Clocks’ bell strikes were, by Western standards, strangely disarranged: six peals at sunset, nine at midnight, eight and then seven in the moments before dawn. There were different periods of time, too, that depended on the seasons and that required at least two balance mechanisms within each clock, and several faces. Even more faces (as many as six) were needed once Western time began to infiltrate the systems of old, in the days when reformists wanted to be able to tell their hour at the same moment as old-timers required to know theirs. The young Hattori, an apprentice to a Ginza clockmaker from 1873 on, was thus pitched into a ferment of variant accuracies and clashing systems that would serve him in later life far better than, at the time, he could have imagined."|"The Perfectionists"|"Simon Winchester"

It had its first run on June 4, 1896—they had to ax down the workshop door to allow the vehicle out onto the street, as Ford had forgotten how wide he had made its frame—and it soon broke down.

To determine their latitude, the distance north or south of the equator, is easy, requiring only the measurement of the altitude of the sun at midday or (in the Northern Hemisphere) the pole star at night. But determining longitude, the distance east or west around the world from the ship’s home port, is much more difficult. Longitude meridians mark the time difference between places, as the planet turns through 360 degrees every twenty-four hours, so each hour is equivalent to a drawn meridian of 15 degrees of longitude. But the time difference, and thus the longitude, can be worked out only if the time back at the home port is known by the ship at sea (its own local time being comparatively easy to determine from the sun and the stars). And for any timekeeper (on board a ship rolling violently in storms, passing through areas of fierce heat and deep cold, and with the clock never once being allowed to stop) to maintain an accurate record of this time was, to early eighteenth-century navigators, deemed well-nigh impossible."|"The Perfectionists"|"Simon Winchester"
