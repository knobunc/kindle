            judge, confronted him, but the thief stabbed him in the throat, killing him instantly—and robbing Baba of a father. The townspeople
            caught the killer just before noon the next day; he turned out to be a wanderer from the Kunduz region. They hanged him from
            the branch of an oak tree with still two hours to go before afternoon prayer. It was Rahim Khan, not Baba, who had told me
            that story. I was always learning things about Baba from other people."|"The Kite Runner"|"Khaled Hosseini"

            and turning as my relatives grunted, sighed, and snored in their sleep. I sat up. A wedge of moonlight streamed in through

            your neck. Creeks where Hassan and I skipped stones all spring turned dry, and rickshaws stirred dust when they sputtered
            by. People went to mosques for their ten raka’ts of noontime prayer and then retreated to whatever shade they could find to nap in, waiting for the cool of early evening.
            Summer meant long school days sweating in tightly packed, poorly ventilated classrooms learning to recite ayats from the Koran, struggling with those tongue-twisting, exotic Arabic words. It meant catching flies in your palm while the
            mullah droned on and a hot breeze brought with it the smell of shit from the outhouse across the schoolyard, churning dust

            so badly I had moaned. When the burly guy with the beads—the praying woman’s husband—asked if I was going to get sick, I said
            I might. Baba looked away. The man lifted his corner of the tarpaulin cover and rapped on the driver’s window, asked him to
            stop. But the driver, Karim, a scrawny dark skinned man with hawk-boned features and a pencil-thin mustache, shook his head."|"The Kite Runner"|"Khaled Hosseini"
