12:00|noon|"‘Not at the moment. I’ll be seeing you again – here or there,’ the man said with a vague and insolent confidence and was gone out of the door before Wormold thought to give him a tradecard. In the square at the top of Lamparilla Street he was swallowed up among the pimps and lottery sellers of the Havana noon."|"Our Man in Havana"|"Graham Greene"
"ap 09:30"|"half-past nine"|"At half-past nine Wormold went to Milly’s room to say good night. Here, where the duenna was in charge, everything was in order – the candle had been lit before the statue of St Seraphina, the honey-coloured missal lay beside the bed, the clothes were eliminated as though they had never existed, and a faint smell of eau-de-Cologne blew about like incense."|"Our Man in Havana"|"Graham Greene"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"‘He falls in it every night at ten o’clock. We should all be clowns, Milly. Don’t ever learn from experience.’"|"Our Man in Havana"|"Graham Greene"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"It was eleven o’clock before they found a ticket that satisfied Dr Hasselbacher’s requirements, and then as the shop which displayed it was closed until the morning there was nothing to do but have another drink. ‘Where is your appointment?’"|"Our Man in Havana"|"Graham Greene"
"> 19:00"|"after 7 p.m."|"‘Ethel, dear, telephone to D.2 and say I will not have my secretaries kept after 7 p.m. except in a national emergency. If a war has broken out or is likely to break out, say that the secretaries’ pool should have been informed.’"|"Our Man in Havana"|"Graham Greene"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"At nine o’clock Wormold set out to find his retailer. He had forgotten how abandoned the streets of Santiago were after dark. Shutters were closed behind the iron grills, and as in an occupied city the houses turned their backs on the passer-by. A cinema cast a little light, but no customer went in; by law it had to remain open, but no one except a soldier or a policeman was likely to visit it after dark. Down a side-street Wormold saw a military patrol go by."|"Our Man in Havana"|"Graham Greene"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"On his way to the hotel he was stopped by two policemen. They wanted to know what he was doing out so late.
‘It’s only ten o’clock,’ he said.
‘What are you doing in this street at ten o’clock?’"|"Our Man in Havana"|"Graham Greene"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"‘It’s only ten o’clock,’ he said.
‘What are you doing in this street at ten o’clock?’
‘There’s no curfew, is there?’"|"Our Man in Havana"|"Graham Greene"
"> 00:00"|"just after midnight"|"‘We are just going, Captain Segura,’ Wormold said.
‘Nonsense. You are my guest. It is only just after midnight.’
Wormold’s sleeve caught a glass. It fell and smashed, like the birthday party. ‘Waiter, another glass.’ Segura began to sing softly, ‘The rose I plucked in the garden,’ leaning towards Milly, turning his back on Dr Hasselbacher."|"Our Man in Havana"|"Graham Greene"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"‘No. The worst hour is two in the morning. When he wakes then, he can’t sleep for thinking, so he drinks instead.’ It astonished Wormold how quickly he could reply to any questions about his characters; they seemed to live on the threshold of consciousness – he had only to turn a light on and there they were, frozen in some characteristic action. Soon after Beatrice arrived Raul had a birthday and she suggested they should give him a case of champagne."|"Our Man in Havana"|"Graham Greene"
00:00|midnight|"‘Of course I’m anxious.’ If Raul had taken off at midnight, he would refuel just before dawn in Santiago, where the ground-staff were friendly, everyone within the Oriente province being rebels at heart. Then when it was just light enough for photography and too early for the patrol planes to be up, he would begin his reconnaissance over the mountains and the forest."|"Our Man in Havana"|"Graham Greene"
"ap < 02:00"|"nearly two"|"‘It might telescope at the wrong moment.’
‘Milly, please …’ Wormold said. ‘It’s nearly two.’
‘Don’t worry. I’m off. And I shall pray for Dr Cifuentes. It’s no joke to be shot at. The bullet went right through a brick wall. Think of what it could have done to Dr Cifuentes.’"|"Our Man in Havana"|"Graham Greene"
01:00|"one in the morning"|"‘He says he has something to do with vacuum cleaners,’ the professor said. ‘Do you think Maria, before she went away …?’
‘Why does he come here at one in the morning?’
‘You must forgive me,’ the professor said with an air of embarrassment, ‘but this is an unusual time.’ He allowed his revolver to move a little off target. ‘One doesn’t as a rule expect visitors …’"|"Our Man in Havana"|"Graham Greene"
00:00|midnight|"Rudy knocked at the door. This was the hour when he listened in for the last time; it would be midnight in London."|"Our Man in Havana"|"Graham Greene"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"‘A game of draughts. At ten o’clock. You and Beatrice must be out of the way.’"|"Our Man in Havana"|"Graham Greene"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"‘Any one of a dozen whore-houses. They are all the same, Carter. About a dozen girls to choose from. They’ll do an exhibition for you. Come on, we’ll go. They get crowded after midnight.’"|"Our Man in Havana"|"Graham Greene"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"The supercilious clerk from the Consulate appeared in the shop at five o’clock the next afternoon. He stood stiffly among the vacuum cleaners like a disapproving tourist in a museum of phallic objects. He told Wormold that the Ambassador wanted to see him. ‘Will tomorrow morning do?’ He was working on his last report, Carter’s death and his resignation."|"Our Man in Havana"|"Graham Greene"
03:30|"three-thirty in the morning"|"The K.L.M. plane was due to take off at three-thirty in the morning for Amsterdam by way of Montreal. Wormold had no desire to travel to Kingston, where Hawthorne might have instructions to meet him. The office had been closed with a final cable and Rudy and his suitcase were routed to Jamaica. The code-books were burnt with the help of the celluloid sheets. Beatrice was to go with Rudy. Lopez was left in charge of the vacuum cleaners. All the personal possessions he valued Wormold got into one crate, which he arranged to send by sea. The horse was sold – to Captain Segura."|"Our Man in Havana"|"Graham Greene"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"It was as if they spent all their remaining time in airports. Now it was the K.L.M. flight and it was three in the morning and the sky was pink with the reflection of neon-lighted stands and landing-flares, and it was Captain Segura who was doing the ‘seeing off’. He tried to make the official occasion seem as private as possible, but it was still a little like a deportation. Segura said reproachfully, ‘You drove me to this.’"|"Our Man in Havana"|"Graham Greene"
"ap < 03:15"|"nearly 3.15"|"Milly joined them, carrying Time, Life, Paris-Match and Quick. It was nearly 3.15 and there was a band of grey in the sky over the flare-path where the false dawn had begun. The pilots moved out to the plane and the air-hostesses followed. He knew the three of them by sight; they had sat with Beatrice at the Tropicana weeks ago. A loudspeaker announced in English and Spanish the departure of flight 396 to Montreal and Amsterdam."|"Our Man in Havana"|"Graham Greene"
"ap 11:25"|11.25|"‘It is a court-martial,’ Hawthorne said frostily and went into the room with the light. The clock stood at 11.25. He had been summoned for eleven."|"Our Man in Havana"|"Graham Greene"
"ap 11:35"|11.35|"At 11.35 the Colonel came out; he looked hot and angry as he strode towards the lift. There goes a hanging judge, thought Wormold. A man in a tweed jacket emerged next. He had blue eyes very deeply sunk and he needed no uniform to mark him as a sailor. He looked at Wormold accidentally and looked quickly away again like a man of integrity. He called out ‘Wait for me, Colonel’ and went down the passage with a very slight roll as though he were back on a bridge in rough weather. Hawthorne came next, in conversation with a very young man, and then Wormold was suddenly breathless because the light was green and Beatrice was there."|"Our Man in Havana"|"Graham Greene"
