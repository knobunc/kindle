We gave each other hugs, and I cried and Lacey cried, and Paul told me to stay out of the wine and to write to them if I could think of something to say that wasn't childish. When they left I walked Corky to her house around the corner, kissed her good-by, and went home."|"Red Sky at Morning"|"Richard Bradford"

Mrs. Stenopolous shushed us and we tiptoed into the kitchen. ""Your father's been delivering babies since six this morning,"" she told Steenie. ""Why do these women always wait until the snow's three feet deep before they have labor pains? He delivered four at the hospital, two at home and one in the drunk tank at the Police Station. Then an hour ago a police car radioed in to headquarters and they telephoned him to hustle out to the Texcoco Road and deliver twins in the back of a pickup."""|"Red Sky at Morning"|"Richard Bradford"
"~ 03:00"|"about three in the morning"|"It was impossible to sleep because I couldn't stop crying. I got up and put on a bathrobe and knocked on my mother's bedroom door. She didn't answer, and by listening closely I could hear her snoring. I'd never heard her do that before, and wondered if sherry did it. Back in my own room, I got one of the Max Shulman books and one of the H. Allen Smith books from the shelf and tried to cheer myself up. The story about the biggest goddamn hippopotamus in the world that sank to the bottom of the lake and never came up almost did the trick, but I couldn't concentrate very hard, and I got sleepy about three in the morning. It was difficult to get up at seven-thirty for school, and when I tried to make my own breakfast the eggs stuck to the pan because I forgot to put the margarine in first. I left the dishes for my mother. When she woke up she'd need the exercise."|"Red Sky at Morning"|"Richard Bradford"

"ap ~ 11:00"|"about eleven"|"The bus stopped in front of Montoya's Genl. Mdse. U.S. Post Office Liquors Wines, a low, crumbled building that apparently served all the needs of Río Conejo. It was about eleven; the driver told me he'd be back through around three, and to be waiting at the same place if I wanted a ride. A young girl was behind the counter inside, and I asked her, pointing down the road, if the Montoyas lived that way. She said sure, and the other way too; everyone in Río Conejo was named either Montoya or Romero. She, herself, was a Romero. I asked specifically for Amadeo Montoya, the one with a wife named Excilda and twelve or thirteen children, and she gave me directions."|"Red Sky at Morning"|"Richard Bradford"
12:00|noon|"The girls arrived on Saturdays at noon. None was under sixty, and I was required to help them from their automobiles and hold them upright while they groped for their canes or crutches. One even carried a staff, a slim black pole six feet long with a gold top. The girls hobbled and limped into the house and lowered themselves carefully into chairs and made deep rumbling noises in their bellies. The six girls, with my mother and Jimbob, made up two tables for bridge. When each of the ancient liners was berthed, I would leave and walk somewhere: to Romeo's, to Steenie's, to Rumpp's, to the movies, sometimes to Chango's house for coffee with his parents, who had begun to call me primito, or little cousin. Occasionally I took hikes through the snowy foothills with Marcia, who felt that walking kept her hips from getting too wide. ""There's nothing I can do with the basic structure of the pelvic girdle,"" she would say, ""but the flab is definitely unnecessary. Race you up the next hill; last one to the top is a gallina."""|"Red Sky at Morning"|"Richard Bradford"

Anything.' But would he listen?"""|"Red Sky at Morning"|"Richard Bradford"
"~ 02:00"|"about two in the morning"|"On the nights I stayed at Steenie's house he provided me with a bedroll, and I arranged it on the floor near his bed, which wasn't big enough for two. As part of his physical conditioning program, to make himself lean and hard for the Commandos, or the Musketeers, or whatever it was, he turned off the heat and opened all his windows at night. The bedroll, a Sears, Roebuck item designed for sultry nights in the tropics, would begin to become inadequate about two in the morning, and I'd flop around on the concrete-slab floor, and roll into a ball, seeking a warm spot, and finally wake Steenie."|"Red Sky at Morning"|"Richard Bradford"

00:00|midnight|"I drank two glasses of the Scotch, which was horrible-tasting, and filled the bottle back to its original level with tap water. It looked a little paler afterwards, but I thought it would pass inspection. Steenie stayed with the gin. At midnight we heard the cathedral bells announce the New Year, and looked for the girls, but they had locked themselves in Eleanor's bedroom. We opened Mrs. Pickens's secretary desk, wrote ""Happy New Year, with love and XXXXXXX from Steenie and Josh, January 1, 1945"" on a sheet of her expensive-looking stationery, and slipped it under the door. We congratulated ourselves by having a drink; I changed to gin. Steenie said that my switching to gin was a genuine sacrifice, and that only a great gentleman and friend would have done it. I agreed. One of the girls knocked on the inside of the bedroom door."|"Red Sky at Morning"|"Richard Bradford"
12:00|noon|"Since the Montoyas were more or less back in the chips, there were lots of people for dinner, and Excilda served the meal in shifts, starting at noon. She'd been working on the dinner for three days, cooking at night when she returned from Sagrado, and it was a feast that made an Anglo Christmas dinner look like starvation rations on Devil's Island. There were two lechoncillos—that's suckling pig, stuffed with apples and onions and corn meal—and three guajalotes asados, which were turkeys surrounded by red chiles and buried in a pit filled with hot rocks for a day or so. That was just for starters, of course. I was sitting next to Victoria at the big table, talking English to her and trying to make conversation in Spanish with an uncle, or a fifth cousin, who had no teeth, when I got a bad case of hiccups and had to go out on the portal to hold my breath and stand on my head. Don Carlos was out there, too, eating what appeared to be an elk, or dinosaur, thighbone. When I stood on my head he walked over and licked my face, and I started laughing and fell over, with my hiccups gone. It's complicated, but it's a hiccup cure I'll recommend to anyone."|"Red Sky at Morning"|"Richard Bradford"
"< 00:00"|"near midnight"|"It was near midnight when I got quietly out of the bedroll and pushed open the door to Victoria's room. There was enough light through a window to see her, sleeping on her side, her thick black hair on the pillow. It was light enough, too, to see Don Carlos lying beside her slippers, his head raised, looking at me calmly. I backed out of the room and closed the door softly. ""Here, boy,"" I whispered, ""here's your nice hamburger with the nice strychnine in it. Yum yum."" Then I got back into the bedroll, and went to sleep on the side that hurt less."|"Red Sky at Morning"|"Richard Bradford"

""Alfonso, let 'em go at four-twenty,"" Chamaco said, and left.
We stayed at the sheriffs office for an hour, reading the Wanted posters and fingerprinting each other. Steenie found a copy of the Criminal Code, and we tried to figure out what Tarzan might be wanted for. By stretching what we knew, we finally decided on Assault with a Deadly Weapon, Attempted Murder (First), Statutory Rape, Trespassing on Government Property, Burglary, Breaking and Entering, Possession of Liquor by a Minor, a possible charge of Draft-Dodging and Operating a Vehicle without a License. Unless he were asleep when Chamaco arrived, we guessed that he would add Resisting Arrest to the list."|"Red Sky at Morning"|"Richard Bradford"
