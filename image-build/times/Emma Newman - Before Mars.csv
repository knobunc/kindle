"> 03:00"|"just after three in the morning"|"“Hi,” he says into the camera, running a hand through his hair. It’s longer than he normally wears it. I suppose I’m not there to remind him to get it cut. “So, I guess you’ll either be just about to land or just arrived. I’m hoping to get a confirmation that all is well any minute now, and it’s making me worry, so I thought I’d message you. It’s . . . just after three in the morning. Mia was up earlier and I just couldn’t get back to sleep."|"Before Mars"|"Emma Newman"
03:00|"three in the fucking morning"|"“I can’t believe how far away you are,” Charlie says, looking down so all I can see is the top of his head. In the darkness of the living room, the lights of the city behind him are bright through the window and the glow from the screen plays over his hair. “I keep trying to get it straight in my head, you know? I looked for Mars through the telescope your mum lent me and I couldn’t see a bloody thing with all the light pollution, but even when I was trying to find it, I couldn’t really believe I was looking for where you are.” There’s a long pause and he sucks in a breath and I realize he’s crying. “I miss you, Anna. It’s . . . it feels like you’re dead. I know that’s total shit and it’s just that it’s like three in the fucking morning and I’m knackered, but that’s what it feels like. I’ve stopped waiting for you to come through the door at the end of the day. I’ve stopped wondering where you are when I wake up. This is . . . it’s just shit, you know? And I’m trying not to be a total dick about this, and I know why you’re doing this but . . . fuck. It’s really hard doing this without you.” He wipes his face, still hidden from view, and looks back up at the camera. “Just send me a message when you get there, okay? I know Mars Principia will ping to let me know you’re there, but I need to see your face, okay? Okay. Bye, then.”"|"Before Mars"|"Emma Newman"

"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"“Hello, Sprout!” She’s sitting by the fire, Frigg stretched out on the sofa next to her, Odin sitting on her lap. He’s so big, the top of his head is pushing her chin up and the struggle for who gets to decide where Mum’s face is allowed to rest is obviously still ongoing. “So it’s”—she squints at the clock across the room—“sometime after midnight and the wind is howling away. Can you hear it? This storm is on the way out now but it’s been a belter. These two reprobates haven’t left the house for days, have you, your majesty?” She looks down at Odin, who rubs his face against her chin and starts purring. “He’s all love and cuddles now, but you should have seen him earlier. Grumpy sod. Anyway. I got your message.Thank you, darling. You do look a little bit tired. Are they working you too hard? Is that why you haven’t sent a message to your father?”"|"Before Mars"|"Emma Newman"

"ap 02:40"|"Two hours and forty minutes"|"I can see Banks looking up the time that we went outside, but I don’t need to. I know how long I was gone and that Principia has given the only time window that could make me look like I’m lying. Two hours and forty minutes ago I was telling Banks that the storm was fake. Neither of us looked up the conditions then; we knew from the meeting that the conditions were supposed to be bad outside. Now Principia is making it look like I made an error, that by the time I stepped outside, the storm was already abating."|"Before Mars"|"Emma Newman"

We lost communications with Earth shortly afterward. Initial estimates of deaths caused by the first strikes in Europe and Norope are over eight million, with a further—”"|"Before Mars"|"Emma Newman"
"> 00:00"|"shortly after midnight"|"Elvan finds a segment filmed in the medbay, a week after my actual arrival. It looks like he’s doing a routine medical before I pull him down to kiss me as I lie on the bed. A movement that matches the one I craved when I was there after the memory erasure. The embrace is tight, passionate, like we’ve been starved of affection for so long and are gorging ourselves, feasting on that which we offer each other so enthusiastically. We part before we make love, fearful that we’ll be discovered, promising to meet that night. In silence, Elvan manipulates something in his visual field with his hand and the images speed up, pause and then cut to his quarters. He is in bed; the time stamp says it’s shortly after midnight. It has the distinct coloration caused by filming in the dark, all muted grays of varying shades."|"Before Mars"|"Emma Newman"
