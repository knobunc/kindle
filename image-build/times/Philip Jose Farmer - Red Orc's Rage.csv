"ap 05:30"|"half past five"|"Eva Grimson had arrived a few minutes before her husband came home and had started cooking supper. She had asked Jim to turn the radio down, and he had done it. He had said nothing about his troubles that afternoon. Eric Grimson had reeled in at half past five, red-faced and breathing fumes that would've floored a dragon. The first thing he had done was to turn the radio off, yelling that he didn't want that damn crap on when he was in the house. Then, of course, he had started in on Jim. Eva had been confused about it all until her husband told her of the telephone call he had gotten from the police about Jim's fight with the Freehoffer kid and the pukey mess on his clothes."|"Red Orc's Rage"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
20:30|"half past eight in the evening"|"It was half past eight in the evening. His room lights were out, but the insurance company building across the street provided a twilight strong enough for him to see the tragil. The door to his room was closed. Though it had no lock, it displayed on its hallway side a taped notice that he was ""gating."" He could hear, very faintly. Brooks Epstein chanting in Hebrew in the next room."|"Red Orc's Rage"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
"< 12:00"|"near high noon"|"Ten days later, near high noon, the Lords were on top of a lofty ridge forming a wall along the right side of a river. They had been forced to climb up its slope and go along its back until they found more level ground. ""For all we know,"" Ore told Ijim, ""the landmark could be on the other side of the ridge."""|"Red Orc's Rage"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
"ap 02:03"|"two hours and three minutes"|"Then he was back in his room. The clock indicated that he�rather, his astral soul or whatever it was�had been gone for two hours and three minutes."|"Red Orc's Rage"|"Philip Jose Farmer"

"ap 07:50"|"ten minutes to eight"|"At ten minutes to eight, he passed through the black hole in the center of the tragil. Despite Porsena's forbidding it, he planned to enter Ore. Not just once but many times during this night. And, since he dare not journey every night�too much danger of being caught�he would com- press the many into a single night."|"Red Orc's Rage"|"Philip Jose Farmer"

"ap 07:50"|"ten minutes to eight"|"Unable to withstand the pain any longer, Jim changed the mantra, and he was back in his room. The time was still ten minutes to eight. The minor hand had moved an almost imperceptible degree. Shaking from the ordeal, he got a drink of water in the bathroom and rested in the chair for a while. Then, sharply aware that he was losing time and he had many trips to go, he began droning, ""ATA MATUMA M'MATA!"" This time, the chant did not have to go on so long. Seven repetitions hurled him through the black hole. The next time, he was sure, it would only take five. The trip after that would need only three. The remaining trips would continue to take three. He did not know why. It just was that way."|"Red Orc's Rage"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
