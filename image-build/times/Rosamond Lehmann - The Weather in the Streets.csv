01:00|"1 a.m."|"What was James? He was a problem. The only male Curtis of this generation was rebellious, not inclined to conform, to settle. After the most brilliant conceit-inducing start at school, he had progressively disappointed; had failed to win the university scholarship which would have enabled him to defer the question of career for a time. Dispatched after this grave set-back to a mill-owning acquaintance of Mr. Curtis in Bristol to learn the business he had left without farewells at the end of six weeks; arriving at the front door at  1 a.m. after three days on the road, blistered, feverish, sullen. Naturally that was the end of the Bristol experiment. Naturally his wounded employer washed his hands. As for James, he explained nothing; and, though briefly bitter, not to say insolent, about mills, voiced no preferences. At home he was disagreeable and spotty, refused all invitations to tennis parties and dances, avoided everybody’s eye, burst forth for day-long solitary walks. In the evenings he sat in his bedroom, playing Delius on his portable Decca and reading poetry: perhaps writing it—nobody knew for certain: but he was known to possess a thick furtive black copy-book. It was only a phase, of course: boys did go like that. But it had seemed best, while waiting for him to come on again, to send him to a French family for a while. French was always useful; and then there was a dark implication of the advantage of removing him from the neighbourhood of Uncle Oswald, for whose society he now showed an odd mingled distaste and fascination. And then the discreet mixture of foreign emancipation and home influence provided by Monsieur et Madame Latour of Fontainebleau might be just what was needed to soothe and settle him. Certainly madame’s elaborately eulogistic, maternally sympathetic, exquisitely penned letters about him appeared to justify such a hope. As for James’s own letters, though scanty and reticent, they arrived regularly, contained no disquieting P.SS. and altogether appeared the products of a normal English youth accepting life as it was ordered for him."|"The Weather in the Streets"|"Rosamond Lehmann"

"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"The fire blazed and the lights stared behind thin, white silk, rose-wreathed shades. Olivia stretched herself upon the white wool hearthrug, between Kate and her mother, facing each other in their arm-chairs. They knitted. Stockings for the children, jumpers for the children, babies’ night-vests, coats, bootees—there was never an end. Kate had taken on and elaborated the theme unfolded in her own infancy by Mrs. Curtis. The little tables either side of the fireplace were choked now with photographs of the grandchildren at all stages: straight-fringed, neat-featured, hygienic-looking. A number of the more rococo pre-war likenesses of Mrs. Curtis’s own young—plumes, curls, ribbons, frothing frills—had been put away to make room for them. From time to time Kate laid down her needles and studied them closely, with a searching frown. From time to time Mrs. Curtis’s hands dropped and she heaved a sigh: her vast unconscious sigh. But nowadays this no longer cast a blight upon her daughters. Olivia smoked, looked at the Illustrated London News. Over her head the two pairs of hands resumed their busy conspiracy, the two voices droned peacefully on … The children, the servants, the children, Rob, Dad, James, the children …

The round table with its surface like dark gleaming ice, its silver and glass, its five-branched Georgian candlesticks, the faces, the hands, the silent, swift circulating forms of butler and footman, the light clash and clatter, the mingling voices … all existed at one remove, yet with a closeness and meaning almost painfully exciting.

"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"David came back with her mink coat, surprised, I saw, to find me talking to Lady Britton, specially when she said, “Good-night, darlin’,” and gave me a lingering kiss with her arms round my neck, saying, “David, isn’t Olivia sweet?” Then she said rather frantically, “For God’s sake come on now, if you don’t get me home soon I won’t answer for me.” He enveloped and surrounded her, soothing, important, and they started down the stairs. Half-way down she began to whimper, saying, “Oh … Oh, David … Oh …” I wondered whether to go to her, but I thought better not; I heard him say: “It’s all right, my dear, you’ll be all right … I’ve a taxi waiting …” I think he’d got more than he bargained for taking Lady Britton out. He fairly swooped her out of the door and into the taxi. It was one o’clock. I went back to the party. The more repressed people were beginning to go, the pot was boiling over nicely; people leaning and lying about, and dancing in heavy stumbling groups, looking intent. Dick had snitched that blonde called Muffet, Jasper’s property—he was glowering and glaring at Dick, his face working like the villain in an old-fashioned film, it looked so faked I wanted to laugh. Someone had been sick in the grate and someone else said, “Rum on top of whisky. Fatal …” Simon was dealing with it, looking patient as Christ on the Cross. Fat old Cora Maxwell had fallen down and cut her head open somehow, there was a crowd round her bandaging and mopping. Simon came with a glass of water and put his arm beneath her shoulders, holding her up to sip … Her red, congested face, the handkerchief tied crooked over one eye, the knot sticking askew on her peroxide mop, her fat hips and little legs prone on the floor, stumpy toes turned up, and Simon stooping above her, pale and clear, his beautiful mouth folded so gently, blinking a little, holding the glass to her lips … I found Jocelyn, he’d only just turned up from writing late, we sat in a corner on top of a table and had a quiet talk. He made a cool island in the room. He wrote down his address in the Tyrol for me, he was just off for six months to write his book; he said why didn’t I come out and join him, and do some writing too. He always thinks I could write, since those sketches I showed him. He said too I could have his room to work in after he’d gone, he wasn’t letting it, he’d post me the keys … Dear Jocelyn, you’re my friend, you make me sit quiet and consider ideas—that injustice matters and unemployment, and the power and hypocrisy of rulers, and revolutions, and Beethoven and Shakespeare and what poets think and write … Things like that, not individual relationships and other people’s copulations and clothes and motor-cars, and things … Not that it lasts … But Jasper came prowling up and put his paw on my wrist, and drew me away reluctant to dance. “The virgin,” he announced, meaning my white frock. After a bit of his usual style, clamped against him, dancing around with deep swoops and squeezes, and sharp stops, my frock clutched up at the back like when I was sixteen and always got those hard-breathing, hot-handed partners who showed the backs of one’s knees, he looked at me under his brows like a seer, more like a lecherous old bison and announced, “You’ve got a lover …”"|"The Weather in the Streets"|"Rosamond Lehmann"
"ap 02:00"|two|"“Have I?” I said. How I loathe him—all that mystic intuitive prophetic bunk and sententious blood-wisdom about Women; fancy his parents calling him Jasper of all suitably bogus names … The worst is he does hit the nail on the head by accident sometimes … “Have I?” I said, raising my eyebrows, innocently surprised; but suddenly I couldn’t bear it any longer, I must go to Rollo, there were cigarette stumps and ash everywhere, and empty bottles and marks of dirty shoes, and a pool of something on the oilcoth by the lavatory door, and everybody still going through their dreary old paces. I thought: I don’t want them, I’m superior, I’ve got someone of my own, I haven’t got to stay. I sent Jasper for a drink and ran for my cloak. The last I saw was Billy with a broom sweeping the rubbish, pulling down the paper decorations and making a heap of them in the middle of the floor and putting a match to them, and Colin with an efficient levelheaded expression squirting at them with an empty soda-water siphon. I suppose Simon saw to it … Jasper loomed up behind me as I went down the stairs, he started to follow me, muttering—but I escaped and was in the street. It was two. Would he have gone to bed? If I couldn’t see him what was I to do? I told the taxi to put me down at the corner of the street where it led into the square. I’d only once been there before, when I walked past his house out of curiosity … That part of residential London behind Bryanston Square is unknown country. There was a cold wind blowing. I shivered. There it was, Rollo’s house, number two on the corner, the hall light showing through the fan, lights in a room on the right of the door, the curtains parted a bit so that I could see in, and I saw him. Standing up by the mantelpiece, smoking a pipe. From outside the room looked warm, rich and snug—a first-class comfortable home. I saw that … I leaned over the railings from the step and just managed to knock on the bulging Regency window. The taxi I’d left went past and stared at me … Rollo, my darling, you opened the door and drew me in and shut the door again, and there we stood clasped in the hall of your house … murmuring: “Oh … I did so want to get to you …” And, “I nearly gave you up. I couldn’t have borne it if you hadn’t come …” And, “Forgive me. I’m sorry …” “It’s all right now …” Loving each other very much and both comforted. He took me into the room and I sat on his lap in the arm-chair by the fire to get warm."|"The Weather in the Streets"|"Rosamond Lehmann"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"“I’ve been foraging for refreshments,” he said. “But all the biscuits and fruit and things seem to have been put away, and I’m blessed if I know where, though it is my own house …” My own house … I wasn’t hungry. I was shivering again. He made me drink some beer from his glass, holding me close to him. We went out and found a taxi on the rank and he took me to Etty’s door. It was five o’clock when I got to bed. Dead beat … I’ve seen Rollo tired, but never without his warm, dry, vital hand, never without his clear eye and fresh ruddy skin. His health is glorious. In his arms I feel an electric glow pass from him to me. How can Nicola be an invalid, living by such a warm source of vigour? If she slept with him … But she doesn’t, of course—that’s what it is … She won’t. Poor Rollo … But I comfort him, I always will."|"The Weather in the Streets"|"Rosamond Lehmann"
"ap > 05:00"|"after five"|"He nodded his head, and lit a cigarette. I said: “Let’s go,” and jumped up and packed very energetically, wanting to get away. It was after five when we started, lugubrious swollen clouds rolling up from the west."|"The Weather in the Streets"|"Rosamond Lehmann"
"~ 00:00"|"About midnight"|"It’s funny, after that week-end there seems a gap for a long time. We didn’t see each other much, I’m sure of that. The problem of where to go got more and more acute. The snatched snips and fragments had become hateful to me—though he didn’t feel it in the same way, and once or twice went away sulking when I said no, impossible. It was getting on for spring, he gave me freesias, mimosa, tulips. It must have been in early March that Jocelyn sent me his keys as he’d promised, with a note saying he was just off to Austria, and wouldn’t I try to come out for a bit later. I rang him up and said would he mind if I lived there say for a month, and tried to do some writing after studio hours. He was delighted—telling me where he kept his sheets and towels, and about the geyser; and did I want his charwoman to do breakfast for me? I said no, I’d look after myself, but she was to come in for an hour every morning while I was out. It’s a lot of washing up that gets me down. I explained to Etty, saying I just needed a workroom of my own for a few weeks, I knew a publisher who was interested, she was thrilled of course; she’s marvellously uninquisitive and unobservant, I must say. Mother was suspicious at first, but pleased on second thoughts. She always thinks it’s such a pity I dropped Writing after being in print so much at Oxford. She thought at last I might be going to settle down and Do Something. Poor Mum; she doesn’t trust Etty, or Anna—or me either for that matter. So my tangled web was nicely woven. I didn’t say a word to Rollo. We lunched together the day I moved in. I said I’d something to show him, and directed him where to go in the car after lunch, opened the door with my own latch-key, walked him upstairs, very mystified, and ushered him in. A grand surprise. The sun was streaming in at the window, and he was so beautifully pleased and excited. I thought I’d be very happy there. I like that part of London too, off the Fulham road. After he’d gone, masses of flowers arrived, and in the evening a great hamper from Fortnum’s, full of those delicacies—fruits in brandy, foie gras, pickled figs and things—that are a bit of a worry really; one never can decide at what meal to eat them, and it seems such a shame to open the jars. A bottle of Calvados too. The sad thing was he couldn’t have dinner with me, he’d got to dine out, he’d come round afterwards, if he possibly could … Sometimes I remember what he said that time I got a glimpse of his engagement book: “They can all be scrapped.” It wasn’t often they were … He can’t help it … I couldn’t be bothered to cook dinner for myself. I had a banana and a cup of coffee and went out and saw a bad film at the Forum. I came back and sat by the gas fire and waited. About midnight the bell rang, he was there. He stayed with me an hour or two, it was heavenly to feel secure against disturbance. He left and I heard his step go down the uncarpeted stair … I felt lonely then and oppressed. The room seemed quite the wrong shape—too high—square—what? … I don’t like bed-sitting rooms, specially at night. I can’t sleep properly. The building seemed utterly empty except for me. A German couple lived on the ground floor, but in between me and them on the first floor, were empty rooms. A painter had one, but he lived in the country and only came up and used it if he had a portrait commission. He didn’t have one while I was there … And Jocelyn’s windows, large, bald, vacant with his long dismal unlined butcher-blue curtains, trailing down like a giant’s boiler-suit … He hasn’t any taste in decoration; not that he’s indifferent, he likes his room; he just hasn’t any eye. Writing young men often haven’t. Not like painters: whatever the mess and squalor their rooms are generally alive. But serious young authors like Jocelyn are apt to live in impersonal apartments with a good deal of brown and blue casement cloth, and oak sideboards, and wicker chairs their mothers have let them have from home. Not uncomfortable, or downright ugly; undeveloped more, student-like. Not puritanical exactly, but, anyway, a hint of a moral attitude … Jocelyn being against possessions at the moment, he’d given away a good many of his books, and the only things in the way of pictures were two photographs, one of Gaudier-Brzeska, one of D. H. Lawrence, cut out of books and framed in black passe-partout; and one lithograph, quite good—a nude. The walls were distempered in fawn, the bed had a Paisley shawl over it by day … Even trimmed up with Rollo’s flowers, that room never cracked a whole-hearted smile."|"The Weather in the Streets"|"Rosamond Lehmann"

Sometimes when he couldn’t have dinner with me, he’d ring the bell late, about one o’clock. I never stayed out anywhere after midnight in case he did. It was rather wearing, the waiting; often after one had struck, I’d listen for the half-hour, then two, then the half-hour again; still keyed up for the door-bell, the telephone, hearing in my brain his car come down the street and stop, sitting frozen in my chair—a listening machine … I asked him how he explained when he came late. “I go to look up old George,” he said. I knew George was an habitué of the house—Nicola’s friend—it didn’t seem safe; but he said George had had standing orders for the last ten years to provide an unhesitating alibi on all occasions with an element of doubt in them.

00:00|midnight|"What a contrast, these last ten days. Jocelyn, everything he stands for, the whole colour and temper of his mind—politically indignant and convinced, bigoted, really, so much the reverse of complacent: Europe not England his country, his point of departure in argument and discussion; his rabid class-consciousness, his ill-fitting clothes, just clothes—necessities—unrelated to him inside them, his earnest, midnight-oilish, physically arid look, his unemotional affection for me … What a contrast! … A kind of life I’ve never shared in before; anti-luxurious, a bit antiseptic, a bit humourless … but cheerful, friendly, smoothly regulated. A life of belief—that’s the true difference. Jocelyn and his kind believe in themselves, in their work, in a future they must contribute to. There’s no principle of belief in Colin, Anna and those, nor in Rollo … In Simon it’s different again, an unconscious power, without direction, or this awful moral fervour. It was a frugal life, funds barely eked out, drinks and expeditions carefully communal … No one got on anybody else’s nerves … Johann and Willi, the Austrian friends, so neat and spotless with one change of linen, so easily happy, sensitive, delicate-mannered; so much the antithesis of what is coarse or oafish … Willi three years without work, Johann’s elder brother shot in the Vienna rising … I should think more about such fates and struggles. If I were free I would, perhaps … Willi taught me some German. He’s charming, with his lazy blue eyes and ravishing teeth. Pale Johann played in the evenings on the café piano. Willi’s plump Lisel from the village came boating with us and fell in … The tow-headed child at the villa where we lodged, with his page’s haircut, his white cat, his passion for Jocelyn’s typewriter … Our long swims in that heavy peacock-blue water, the pert, theatrical little steamers, the café on the jetty, the moon on the water … Rollo’s heavenly letter coming, far the nicest he’s ever written, a poignant letter … I read it again and again, almost incredulous. Jocelyn lent me books; I began to think again about writing … Took some notes for my lake story. I should have done more if I hadn’t begun to get worried …"|"The Weather in the Streets"|"Rosamond Lehmann"

We had a glorious drive back in the dawn, eating hot dogs from an American bar.

12:00|midday|"To be alone, sick, in London in this dry, sterile, burnt-out end of summer, was to be abandoned in a pestilence-stricken town; was to live in a third-class waiting-room at a disused terminus among stains and smells, odds and ends of refuse and decay. She sank down and existed, without light, in the waste land. Sluggishly, reluctantly, the days ranged themselves one after the other into a routine. Morning: wake heavy from heavy sleep, get up, one must be sick, go back to bed; nibble a biscuit, doze, half-stupefied till midday; force oneself then to dress, each item of the toilet laborious, distasteful, the body a hateful burden. Tidy the bedroom more or less, dust a bit in the sitting-room, let in what air there was: for Mrs. Banks was on holiday, there was no one to keep one up to the mark, no sharp eye and sharper tongue to brace one or contend against. Prepare to go out for lunch. Rouge, lipstick, powder … do what one might, it wasn’t one’s own face, it wasn’t a face at all, it was a shoddy construction, a bad disguise. Walk down two side streets to the Bird Cage: morning coffee, light lunches, dainty teas, controlled by gentlewomen; blue tables, orange chairs."|"The Weather in the Streets"|"Rosamond Lehmann"

He’d be happy if he could live like this always: with someone or other for company—someone just in practical control but shelved as an exacting aggressive individual—someone being agreeable, not picking on him. He’d be a treasure to a lady invalid with cultured tastes. He’d push her chair round and round the garden, and take an interest in the bulbs, and they’d have hot scones for tea."|"The Weather in the Streets"|"Rosamond Lehmann"

Hers was so calm, restrained, and when she got my yell she sent a pre-paid telegram saying so distressed wire news at once. She’d behaved too well.

It was past five o’clock when they went up to bed.
Anna got sheets and Olivia helped her make up the camp-bed for Adrian in Colin’s room. Olivia’s own bed was already prepared, with the stone hot-water bottle in it. She had a bath in the tiny green-blistered bathroom in the middle of the steam, among the hissing, snorting pipes and the towels frayed and yellow with age and bad washing, and the cracked shaving mirror with the frame made by Anna of South of France shells."|"The Weather in the Streets"|"Rosamond Lehmann"

I depend on you …” “Thank you so much, Lady Spencer, it is kind of you …” “Good-bye, Olivia.” She hung up briskly, having kept her promise: you shall see Rollo once. (Alone. But under my auspices.
