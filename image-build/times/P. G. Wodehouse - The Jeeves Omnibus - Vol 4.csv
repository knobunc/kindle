‘Right ho,’ I said. ‘I’ll call for you at about half-past eleven.’
You are surprised? You are saying to yourself ‘Come, come, Wooster, what’s all this?’ – wondering why I was letting myself in for a beano from which I might well have shrunk? The matter is susceptible of a ready explanation."|"The Jeeves Omnibus - Vol 4"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
"ap 11:30"|eleven-thirty|"I picked her up at her flat at eleven-thirty, and found her in sombre mood, the lips compressed, the eyes inclined to gaze into space with a sort of hard glow in them. No doubt something along these lines is always the aftermath of a brisk dust-up with the heart-throb. During the taxi drive she remained about as silent as the tomb, and from the way her foot kept tapping on the floor of the vehicle I knew that she was thinking of Stilton, whether or not in agony of spirit I was, of course, unable to say, but I thought it probable. Following her into the joint, I was on the whole optimistic. It seemed to me that with any luck I ought to be successful in the task that lay before me – viz. softening her with well-chosen words and jerking her better self back to the surface."|"The Jeeves Omnibus - Vol 4"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
15:00|"three o’clock in the afternoon"|"For a moment I was under the impression that my visitor’s emotion was due to his having found me at this advanced hour in pyjamas and a dressing-gown, a costume which, if worn at three o’clock in the afternoon, is always liable to start a train of thought. But it seemed that this was not so. More serious matters were on the agenda paper."|"The Jeeves Omnibus - Vol 4"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
01:00|"one in the morning"|"I leaped perhaps six inches in the direction of the ceiling. I was appalled, and I think not unjustifiably so. I mean, dash it, a fellow who has always prided himself on the scrupulous delicacy of his relations with the other sex doesn’t like to have it supposed that he deliberately shins up ladders at one in the morning in order to kiss girls while they sleep."|"The Jeeves Omnibus - Vol 4"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
01:00|"one in the morning"|"Florence, I noticed, seemed a bit startled, too. One gathered that she hadn’t expected, when setting out for Brinkley Court, that her bedroom was going to be such a social centre. There’s a song I used to sing a good deal at one time, the refrain or burthen of which began with the words ‘Let’s all go round to Maud’s’. Much the same sentiment appeared to be animating the guests beneath Aunt Dahlia’s roof, and it was, of course, upsetting for the poor child. At one in the morning girls like a bit of privacy, and she couldn’t have had much less privacy if she had been running a snack bar on a racecourse."|"The Jeeves Omnibus - Vol 4"|"P. G. Wodehouse"

It is now some twenty minutes past one o’clock in the morning, and not a spot of action on your part. Do you expect me to sit up all night waiting for you to get around to a simple, easy task which a crippled child of six could have had all done and washed up in a quarter of an hour? I suppose this is just the shank of the evening to you dissipated Londoners, but we rustics like to get our sleep. What’s the idea? Why the delay? What on earth have you been doing all this while, you revolting young piece of cheese?’"|"The Jeeves Omnibus - Vol 4"|"P. G. Wodehouse"

It amazed me that Aunt Dahlia, presumably a free agent, should have selected this very formidable loony-doctor to chew the mid-day chop with. However, one of the first lessons life teaches us is that aunts will be aunts, so I merely shrugged a couple of shoulders."|"The Jeeves Omnibus - Vol 4"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"It was Problem A that puzzled me particularly, for ever since that hot-water-bottle episode my relations with this parent of Bobbie’s had been on the strained side. It was, indeed, an open secret that my standing with her was practically that of a rat of the underworld. I had had this from Bobbie, whose impersonation of her mother discussing me with sympathetic cronies had been exceptionally vivid, and I must confess that I wasn’t altogether surprised. No hostess, I mean to say, extending her hospitality to a friend of her daughter’s, likes to have the young visitor going about the place puncturing people’s water-bottles and leaving at three in the morning without stopping to say good-bye. Yes, I could see her side of the thing all right, and I found it extraordinary that she should be seeking me out on the telephone in this fashion. Feeling as she did so allergic to Bertram, I wouldn’t have thought she’d have phoned me with a ten-foot pole."|"The Jeeves Omnibus - Vol 4"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"I mused. It was true that I had slid down quite a number of water pipes in my time. Circumstances had often so moulded themselves as to make such an action imperative. It was by that route that I had left Skeldings Hall at three in the morning after the hot-water-bottle incident. So while it would be too much, perhaps, to say that I am never happier than when sliding down water pipes, the prospect of doing so caused me little or no concern. I began to see that there was something in this plan she was mooting, if mooting is the word I want."|"The Jeeves Omnibus - Vol 4"|"P. G. Wodehouse"

On the present occasion, held up by the Arab steed getting taken with a fit of the vapours and having to be towed to a garage for medical treatment, I didn’t fetch up at journey’s end till well past midnight. And when I rolled round to Jeeves’s address on the morrow, I was informed that he had gone out early and they didn’t know when he would be back. Leaving word for him to ring me at the Drones, I returned to the metropolis and was having the pre-dinner keg of nails in the smoking-room when his call came through."|"The Jeeves Omnibus - Vol 4"|"P.

Indeed, long before that as a general rule the conversation at the dinner table is apt to turn on the subject of how good the train service to London is, those present obviously hoping wistfully that Bertram will avail himself of it.

Ever since breakfast my guardian angel had been scaring the pants off me by practically saying in so many words that Totleigh Towers was all set to re-enter my life, and it was now clear that what he had had in mind had been the imminence of this plea to me to go there, he feeling that in a weak moment I might allow myself to be persuaded against my better judgment. The peril was now past. Totleigh Towers had made its spring and missed by a mile, and I no longer had a thing to worry about. It was with a light heart that I joined a group of pleasure-seekers who were playing Darts and cleaned them up with effortless skill. Three o’clock was approaching when I left the club en route for home, and it must have been getting on for half past when I hove alongside the apartment house where I have my abode."|"The Jeeves Omnibus - Vol 4"|"P.

There was a shrimp-like quality about him which I found most encouraging. It seemed to me that it would be an easy task to throttle him into submission, and I was getting down to it with a hearty good will when my hand touched what were plainly spectacles and at the same moment a stifled ‘Hey, look out for my glasses!’ told me my diagnosis had been all wrong.
