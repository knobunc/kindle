05:12|"5:12 A.M."|"So it is perhaps appropriate that at 5:12 A.M. on that Wednesday morning the earthquake that was born out under the ocean beyond the Golden Gate seemed to come roaring into the city, as eyewitnesses like to remember, along the four switchback miles of Washington Street."|"A Crack in the Edge of the World"|"Simon Winchester"
05:10|"5:10 A.M."|"One floor above him was Edward Plume, another patrolman working the end of his shift in City Hall’s small police office. He experienced much the same sensation, but noted the time, interestingly, as “5:10 A.M. by the station clock,” fully two minutes earlier than the time in those precise reports from central San Francisco and across the Bay (most notably the five mentioned earlier) by which history has since fixed itself."|"A Crack in the Edge of the World"|"Simon Winchester"
05:10|"5:10 A.M."|"Quite probably Officer Plume’s record of 5:10 A.M. signifies very little—other than that his police station clock was slightly slow. Except—his station was in fact a little closer to the fault and its rupture than the other observers: One could therefore expect the plowshare wave from it to rip through City Hall just a few moments before it reached the waterfront, and significantly before it reached the sleeping Professor Gilbert in his cot nine miles away across the Bay in Berkeley a few moments before. Not two minutes before: With the wave traveling at two miles a second the time difference would be barely noticeable."|"A Crack in the Edge of the World"|"Simon Winchester"
03:00|"3:00 A.M."|"The celebrity-filled Palace Hotel—where Caruso was staying and had gone to his room at 3:00 A.M.—was to be a victim, too, though, like so many of the city’s buildings, it fell not to the earthquake itself but to the subsequent fire. It stood secure at the first shock, though a passerby named Frank Ames, in the hotel’s grand courtyard, later reported that the palm trees swayed, the ground dropped beneath his feet, and the horses under the hotel’s porte cochere took off in panic. As they did so, he wrote, “I could not help noticing that the beasts’ eyes were big with terror and foam was coming from their nostrils.” The earthquake, Ames noted, seemed to be running there from east to west—the opposite way from that noted by most of the other witnesses—and “the cobblestones of Market Street seemed alive. Every one of them was moving, and the streetcar rails were twisted from their places.”"|"A Crack in the Edge of the World"|"Simon Winchester"
05:15|"5:15 A.M."|"Many of the captains of these vessels thought they had run up on the rocks. In the far north, the steam collier Wellington, for example, was under way in sixty fathoms off Point Diablo; and the steamer Alliance was in similarly deep waters close to the seismically complicated Mendocino Triple Junction. Both vessels felt a sudden huge shock, “as if we had run into rocks at high speed,” according to one of the captains. The captain of the Argo, ninety miles off Point Arena, thought he had struck a raft of submerged logs. Closer to San Francisco was the schooner John A. Campbell, doing seven knots in 2,400 fathoms about 145 miles west of Point Reyes. It was 5:15 A.M., with clear weather and a fresh north-northwesterly wind, when suddenly there came a strange sensation, “as if the vessel struck, slightly forward, and then appeared to drag over soft ground, and when aft a slight tremor was felt; and the whole lasting only a few seconds.”"|"A Crack in the Edge of the World"|"Simon Winchester"
05:15|"5:15 A.M."|"The pilot boat Gracie S. was waiting by the lightship at the bar off the Golden Gate to come alongside the German steamship Nyada and guide it to its berth; it felt a shock “as if the chain were running out of her hawser pipe,” and the German, when boarded, was white faced and shaking, convinced that he had somehow inadvertently managed to ram into a reef. The pilot boat Pathfinder made a similar report: at 5:15 A.M. a heavy bang as if running aground, even though the charts insisted there were 120 feet beneath the keel."|"A Crack in the Edge of the World"|"Simon Winchester"
05:03|"5:03 A.M."|"The single puzzling aspect of this one report is its timing: The ship’s log records the event as having occurred at 5:03 A.M.—nine minutes before the mainshock is known to have originated off Mussel Rock. It has to be assumed that the log is wrong, or that the National City’s chronometer was ill set: There seems to be no corroborating evidence of any earlier shock. But, as in all other respects the vessel’s encounter seems to have been scrupulously recorded, it does leave one to wonder if perhaps the San Andreas was misbehaving itself locally at earlier moments."|"A Crack in the Edge of the World"|"Simon Winchester"
05:06|"5:06 A.M."|"Out on the southernmost of the Farallon Islands, which stand thirty fog-shrouded miles due west of the epicenter—and so just to the west of the fault trace—there was further evidence of chronological complications. The rupture was felt there quite distinctly (and in the usual fashion, with two intense shocks, the second greater than the first), but it was felt at 5:06 A.M. This time was, moreover, confirmed by a secondary source, because at the same moment James Boyle, the U.S. Weather Bureau observer on the Farallons, was talking by telephone to his colleague, a Mr. Legler, in the bureau office in the lighthouse at Point Reyes, twenty nautical miles to the north. Legler experienced the shock wave first, about three seconds before Boyle; both men reported that objects were thrown in an easterly direction—though at the Farallon Observatory a stone weighing a hundred pounds was moved six inches just to the west of south, and it was rotated, very slightly, in a counterclockwise direction. The time for both observers was a puzzling six minutes after five o’clock—still dark out at sea, with only the vaguest hint of dawn coming up from over the land."|"A Crack in the Edge of the World"|"Simon Winchester"

The hospital dissolved into chaos when the earthquake hit, and it was thought that in the pandemonium hundreds of inmates broke loose and roamed the streets of town, like zombies. No such thing occurred, although a falling clock tower (with the clock’s hands stopped forever at 5:12:45) did kill as many as 119 people, rendering the Agnew’s tragedy one of the greatest to befall a single building.* The scenes were utterly distressing: horribly mutilated victims, bewilderment, wailing and fear on all sides, violent patients tied to trees with sheets, screeching bloody murder."|"A Crack in the Edge of the World"|"Simon Winchester"
"> 05:00"|"just after 5:00 A.M."|"At the very outer edges of the roughly circular area where the event was just discernible, and where it was remembered or recorded by humankind,* its shock waves caused no damage at all. The most northerly place where humans experienced the event appears to have been the small town of Coquille, Oregon, which lies 390 miles to the north of the Daly City epicenter. One of the town’s most prominent men, Judge Harlocker, was woken up just after 5:00 A.M. Mr. and Mrs. Wilson living nearby were awakened and noticed the cord of their electric lamp swinging back and forth. And when Mr. Wilson went to work in his jewelry store, he found that his regulator clock had stopped."|"A Crack in the Edge of the World"|"Simon Winchester"
"ap 03:59"|"one of four"|"This was the device that registered the San Francisco shock waves—one of four maintained by Jesuits around the world at the time. It was responsible for detecting the impressive set of shocks from which the earthquake’s approximate epicenter was determined. (The Shanghai instrument was replaced in 1932 by a newfangled contraption winningly known as a Galitzin-Wilip instrument, and it operated outside the great city until 1949, when the Chinese Communists turfed the Jesuits out.)"|"A Crack in the Edge of the World"|"Simon Winchester"
05:12|"5:12 A.M."|"From all of this data he was able to declare, definitively, that the shock began at 11 minutes and 58 seconds after 13 hours, Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)—in other words, two seconds before 5:12 A.M., Pacific Time, plus or minus three seconds. The place where this opening salvo was triggered was computed to be under the sea, just a short distance off the Golden Gate. And the depth of the vibrations’ beginnings—all computed from the simple geometries of the observations from these five sites—was about twelve miles, give or take about six."|"A Crack in the Edge of the World"|"Simon Winchester"
"> 05:12"|"after 5:12 A.M."|"And then there was the biggest shock—the terrifying “second shock” that so many of the observers could not fail to notice, whether they were rocked softly in their beds far away up in Oregon, or down in Anaheim, or over in Winnemucca, Nevada, or whether they were knocked flat by it in San Francisco, Santa Rosa, or San Jose. According to Lawson, it came exactly thirty seconds later, at 13h 12m 28s GMT, or at twenty-eight seconds after 5:12 A.M., Pacific Time. This shock, he went on to say, took place somewhere between the surface and twelve miles down, and at a spot close to the village of Olema, which has long considered itself—wrongly—to have been the earthquake’s epicenter (and where the locals, somewhat shiftily, still peddle hats and T-shirts to try to underline the point)."|"A Crack in the Edge of the World"|"Simon Winchester"

Later on people expressed their relief that the quake had happened when so many people were still indoors; had it occurred at noon, when crowds thronged the streets, they would have been hit by the falling brickwork, making the casualty figures unbearable. But at the time there were no thoughts of relief—instead the whole world seemed to consist only of the stunned silence of the mob, the dust-laden darkness, the half-heard cries of pain, the crashing of masonry as cornices and chimneys and walls kept on falling, falling, falling."|"A Crack in the Edge of the World"|"Simon Winchester"

Falling chimneys killed innumerable sleeping men and women that morning, most infamously (and, in a practical sense, most inconveniently) the city’s fire chief, Dennis Sullivan. It will be remembered that he had presided over the fighting of two smallish fires in the wee hours of the morning, and at about 3:00 A.M. had gone back to his wife, Margaret, and his bed in his small third-floor apartment on Bush Street between Grant and Kearny Streets, which housed on the first two floors the city’s Chemical Company No. 3."|"A Crack in the Edge of the World"|"Simon Winchester"
12:00|midday|"Over the city the wind was westerly, and, as the sun came up, it began to freshen. And the fires, some of them big and named, others small and of seeming insignificance (at least fifty were identified as having broken out in those first few hours), took hold and began to join hands with one another. And as these isolated fires became larger and larger, and joined one another to grow larger still, they began to suck more and more oxygen from the atmosphere and to create winds of their own, eddies of superheated air that sucked ever more of the islands of fire together. By midday there was a wall of flame a mile and half long to the south of Market Street, and the wall of smoke rose at least two miles up into the sky, visible across all the counties of the bay and horrifying thousands."|"A Crack in the Edge of the World"|"Simon Winchester"

The next day more trains were ordered to leave army bases in Texas, Pennsylvania, Nebraska, Iowa, and Wyoming, all loaded with equipment. Before long every single tent in the military’s possession was in San Francisco, and the largest hospital train ever made had been sent out from Virginia.

There is a vertical component, too—the Temblor Range, for example, has been caused by vertical uplift along the fault. (The reason it exists at all is that the fault does not exactly coincide here with the direction of plate motion: It is slightly skewed to one side, and as a consequence of this skewing the material bunches up, like a pleat in a carpet, as the plates move alongside each other.)

The local Kern River ran backward; fish were thrown hundreds of yards from where they swam in Tulare Lake; long zigzag cracks appeared in the ground at San Bernardino; massive ridges, five feet high and fifteen feet across, rose and started to snake through fields; artesian wells suddenly failed; the Los Angeles River was hurled out of its bed and began, if only briefly, to flow along another channel; and up on the Carrizo Plain the fault jerked so dramatically that many of the rivers coursing down from the Temblors were thrown off course by as much as thirty feet in a matter of microseconds."|"A Crack in the Edge of the World"|"Simon Winchester"

Will Rogers once remarked that it was “the city that was never a town.” At the time of its renaming it already had two newspapers, and a census conducted by one of them found that in only the first six months of American governance it had more than doubled in size. The paper noted the presence among its 459 inhabitants of a minister, three doctors, and three lawyers, together with two surveyors, a teacher, eleven farmers, seven bakers, six blacksmiths, a brewer, six brickmakers, seven butchers, two cabinetmakers, three innkeepers, four tailors, eleven merchants, a morocco-luggage maker, a weaver, a watchmaker, and no fewer than twenty-six carpenters. Less scrupulously counted were a number of “Indians, Sandwich Islanders and negroes.” The Hawaiians, said the paper, generally acted as pilots and navigators, since they had the uncanny ability to grope their way around the skerries of San Francisco Bay, no matter how thick the frequent fog. And men outnumbered women in the earliest settlement by almost three to one—a condition that would dog the city for years and lead to its later reputation as a place where most of the inhabitants would misspend their days in one kind of abandon or another."|"A Crack in the Edge of the World"|"Simon Winchester"

At four o’clock or so a stiff sea breeze sprang up, driving away the clouds that had dulled a hitherto dreary day. A westering sun could at last be seen, inching its way down behind the Golden Gate, dimming the rocks at Land’s End and Point Bonita, and making the Farallon Islands a misty silhouette on the Pacific horizon. This dusk had turned out to be a pretty one, a fitting finale to yet one more Californian day rolling to its contented close."|"A Crack in the Edge of the World"|"Simon Winchester"

It had struck early in the morning, a few minutes before eight on October 21, and killed thirty-five people. Only five of these victims were in San Francisco itself, however—the remainder died in the collapse of buildings on the far side of the Bay, in what were then small settlements like Hayward and San Leandro. And the reason for this—though it was not readily ascertained at the time—is that the rupture in the earth that caused it occurred not on the San Andreas Fault but on one of its neighbors known as the Hayward Fault, which runs exclusively up the eastern side of the Bay."|"A Crack in the Edge of the World"|"Simon Winchester"
