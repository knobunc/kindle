00:00|midnight|"Ranulph had always been a dreamy, rather delicate child, and backward for his years. Up to the age of seven, or thereabouts, he had caused his mother much anxiety by his habit, when playing in the garden, of shouting out remarks to an imaginary companion. And he was fond of talking nonsense (according to the ideas of Lud-in-the-Mist, slightly obscene nonsense) about golden cups, and snow-white ladies milking azure cows, and the sound of tinkling bridles at midnight. But children are apt, all the world over, to have nasty little minds; and this type of talk was not uncommon among the children of Lud-in-the-Mist, and, as they nearly always grew out of it, little attention was paid to it."|Lud-In-The-Mist|"Hope Mirrlees"
02:30|Vigils|"When finally the baffled Dame Marigold got up to go, the old woman cried shrilly: “Now, ma’am, remember, not a word of this to the master! He was never one that could stand being worried. He’s like his father in that. My old mistress used often to say to me, ‘Now, Polly, we won’t tell the master. He can’t stand worry.’ Aye, all the Chanticleers are wonderful sensitive.” And the unexpressed converse of the last statement was, “All the Vigils, on the other hand, have the hides of buffaloes.”"|Lud-In-The-Mist|"Hope Mirrlees"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"By seven o’clock the Chanticleers’ parlor was filled with a crowd of stout, rosy, gaily-dressed guests, chattering and laughing like a flock of paroquets. Only Ranulph was silent; but that was to be expected from a little boy of twelve years old in the presence of his elders. However, he need not have sulked in a corner, nor responded quite so surlily to the jocular remarks addressed him by his father’s guests."|Lud-In-The-Mist|"Hope Mirrlees"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"There were no more jokes that evening, and on most of the plates the cheese lay neglected; and in spite of the efforts of some of the guests, conversation flagged sadly, so that it was scarcely nine o’clock when the party broke up."|Lud-In-The-Mist|"Hope Mirrlees"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"At six o’clock a loud bell was rung outside the house, presumably to summon the laborers to supper; and, as the widow had told them it would be in the kitchen, Ranulph and Luke, both feeling very hungry, went hurrying down."|Lud-In-The-Mist|"Hope Mirrlees"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"At eight o’clock a little scrabbling noise was heard at the door. “That’s the children,” said Hazel, and she went and opened it, upon which three or four little boys came bashfully in from the dusk."|Lud-In-The-Mist|"Hope Mirrlees"
12:00|midday|"Master Ambrose Honeysuckle had finished his midday meal, and was smoking his churchwarden on his daisy-powdered lawn, under the branches of a great, cool, yellowing lime; and beside him sat his stout comfortable wife, Dame Jessamine, placidly fanning herself to sleep, with her pink-tongued mushroom-colored pug snoring and choking in her lap."|Lud-In-The-Mist|"Hope Mirrlees"
12:00|midday|"But her only answer was to look at him in agonized terror, and then to moan, “The horror of midday!”"|Lud-In-The-Mist|"Hope Mirrlees"
02:30|Vigils|"The Polydore Vigils were spending the evening there, and the whole party was engaged in trying to catch a moth — flicking at it with their pocket handkerchiefs, stumbling over the furniture, emulating each other to further efforts in the ancient terms of stag-hunting."|Lud-In-The-Mist|"Hope Mirrlees"
"ap 07:25"|7:25|"However, the apprentice he sent to Master Nathaniel was almost as respectable looking as he was himself. He wore a neat black wig, and his expression was sanctimonious in the extreme, with the corners of his mouth turned down, like one of his master’s clocks that had stopped at 7:25."|Lud-In-The-Mist|"Hope Mirrlees"
"< 00:00"|"towards midnight"|"It was this way — one night, I don’t know how it was, but I couldn’t get to sleep, and thinking that a bite, may be, of something would send me off, towards midnight I got up from my bed to go and look in the kitchen for a bit of bread. And half-way down the stairs I heard the sound of low voices, and someone said, “I fear the Chanticleers,” so I stood still where I was, and listened. And I peeped down and the kitchen fire was nearly out, but there was enough left for me to see the widow, and a man wrapped up in a cloak, sitting opposite to her with his back to the stairs, so I couldn’t see his face. Their talk was low and at first I could only hear words here and there, but they kept making mention of the Chanticleers, and the man said something like keeping the Chanticleers and Master Ambrose Honeysuckle apart, because Master Ambrose had had a vision of Duke Aubrey. And if I hadn’t known the widow and how she was a deep one and as fly as you make them, I’d have thought they were two poor daft old gossips, whose talk had turned wild and nasty with old age. And then the man laid his hand on her knee, and his voice was low, but this time it was so clear that I could hear it all, and I think I can remember every word of it, so I’ll write it down for your Worship: “I fear counter orders. You know the Chief and his ways — at any moment he might betray his agents. Willy Wisp gave young Chanticleer fruit without my knowledge. And I told you how he and that doitered old weaver of yours have been putting their heads together, and that’s what has frightened me most.”"|Lud-In-The-Mist|"Hope Mirrlees"
00:00|midnight|"“Yes, that’s the goods all right,” said Endymion Leer, “and we’ll take the other two on trust. Shut it up again, and help to hoist it on to my shoulder, and do you follow with the other two — we’ll take them right away to the tapestry-room. We’re having a council there at midnight, and it’s getting on for that now.”"|Lud-In-The-Mist|"Hope Mirrlees"
00:00|midnight|"As the clocks in Lud-in-the-Mist were striking midnight the five of them were stepping cautiously along the corridors of the Guildhall. They had no difficulty in finding the hollow panel, and having pressed the spring, they made their way along the secret passage."|Lud-In-The-Mist|"Hope Mirrlees"
02:30|Vigils|"“Why, Master Nat,” she cried, “I don’t believe you’ve felt so light-hearted since you were a boy! But these are strange times when a Chanticleer is chased out of Lud-in-the-Mist! And wouldn’t I just like to give those Vigils and the rest of them a bit of my mind!” and her old eyes flashed. “But don’t you ever get downhearted, Master Nat, and don’t ever forget that there have always been Chanticleers in Lud-in-the-Mist, and that there always will be! But it beats me how you’re to manage with only three pairs of stockings, and no one to mend them.”"|Lud-In-The-Mist|"Hope Mirrlees"

12:00|midday|"About half-way to Swan, Master Nathaniel, having tethered his horse to a tree, was reclining drowsily under the shade of another. It was midday, and the further west he rode the warmer it grew; it was rather as if he were riding backward through the months."|Lud-In-The-Mist|"Hope Mirrlees"
12:00|midday|"The widow, too, gave him a hearty welcome, when he came down to the midday meal in the big kitchen."|Lud-In-The-Mist|"Hope Mirrlees"
12:00|midday|"Two hours later after a busy morning devoted to professional visits — and, perhaps, some unprofessional one too — Endymion Leer sat down to his midday dinner. There was not a happier man in Lud than he — he was the most influential man in the town, deep in the counsels of the magistrates; and as for the dreaded Chanticleers — well, he had successively robbed them of their sting. Life being one and indivisible, when one has a sense that it is good its humblest manifestations are transfigured, and that morning the Doctor would have found a meal of baked haws sweet to his palate — how much more so the succulent meal that was actually awaiting him. But it was not fated that Endymion Leer should eat that dinner. There came a loud double knock at the door, and then the voice of Captain Mumchance, demanding instantly to be shown in to the Doctor. It was in vain that the housekeeper protested, saying that the Doctor had given strict orders that he was never to be disturbed at his meals, for the Captain roughly brushed her aside with an aphorism worthy of that eminent jurist, the late Master Josiah Chanticleer. “The Law, my good lady, is no respector of a gentleman’s stomach, so I’ll trouble you to stand out of the way,” and he stumped resolutely into the parlor."|Lud-In-The-Mist|"Hope Mirrlees"

00:00|midnight|"As Master Nathaniel listened, he knew that other people would have heard other tunes — whatever tunes through the milkman’s whistle, or the cracked fiddle of a street musician, or the voices of young sparks returning from the tavern at midnight, the Morning Stars may have happened to sing in their own particular infancy."|Lud-In-The-Mist|"Hope Mirrlees"
