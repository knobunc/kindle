"ap 09:00"|nine|"Occasionally the writer recognizes that the sentence contains a parenthetical thought but fails to discern just how much of the information is incidental, as here: “At nine she won a scholarship to Millfield, the private school, for bright children of the rich” (Evening Standard). If we removed what has been presented as parenthetical, the sentence would say: “At nine she won a scholarship to Millfield for bright children.” There should be no comma after school, because the whole of the last statement is parenthetical."|"Bryson's Dictionary for Writers and Editors"|"Bill Bryson"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"When direct questions take on the tone of a command, the use of a question mark becomes more discretionary. “Will everyone please assemble in my office at four o’clock?” is strictly correct, but not all authorities insist on the question mark there."|"Bryson's Dictionary for Writers and Editors"|"Bill Bryson"
"< 12:00"|"Before midday"|"Alzheimer’s disease, but in formal medical contexts the non-possessive form Alzheimer disease is increasingly used instead.
a.m./AM. Ante meridiem (Lat.) Before midday.
Amalienborg Palace. Residence of Danish royal family in Copenhagen."|"Bryson's Dictionary for Writers and Editors"|"Bill Bryson"
"< 12:00"|"Before midday"|"ante meridiem. (Lat.) “Before midday.” Abbr. a.m./AM; not to be confused with antemeridian (one word), meaning of or taking part in the morning."|"Bryson's Dictionary for Writers and Editors"|"Bill Bryson"
00:00|midnight|"assume, presume. The two words are often so close in meaning as to be indistinguishable, but in some contexts they do allow a fine distinction to be made. Assume, in the sense of “to suppose,” normally means to put forth a realistic hypothesis, something that can be taken as probable (“I assume we will arrive by midnight”). Presume has more of an air of sticking one’s neck out, of making an assertion that may be arguable or wrong (“I presume we have met before?”). But in most instances the two words can be used interchangeably."|"Bryson's Dictionary for Writers and Editors"|"Bill Bryson"
00:00|midnight|"2. As a past participle, awaked is preferable to awoke. Thus, “He had awaked at midnight” and not “He had awoke at midnight.” But if ever in doubt about the past tense, you will never be wrong if you use awakened."|"Bryson's Dictionary for Writers and Editors"|"Bill Bryson"
"ap 01:15"|1.15|"knot. A speed of one nautical mile an hour. A ship does eight knots or it does eight nautical miles an hour, but not eight knots an hour. A nautical mile equals 1.15 land miles, and in most contexts the reader will appreciate having that difference elucidated."|"Bryson's Dictionary for Writers and Editors"|"Bill Bryson"
"> 12:00"|"after noon"|"plutocrat. Person who has influence or power because of wealth.
p.m./PM. Post meridiem (not -ien), (Lat.) after noon.
PNC Park. Pittsburgh baseball stadium, home of the Pirates."|"Bryson's Dictionary for Writers and Editors"|"Bill Bryson"
"> 12:00"|"after noon"|"postmeridian, post meridiem. The first means related to or happening in the afternoon. The second, also pertaining to the period after noon, is the Latin term better known to most of us as the abbreviation p.m. Note the different terminal spellings."|"Bryson's Dictionary for Writers and Editors"|"Bill Bryson"
