"ap 02:10"|2:10|"Fire blight. A bacterial disease and a serious problem for both cider and table apple growers. Leaves, twigs, and branches suddenly wither and die, as though the tree had been singed with a giant blowtorch. Action must be taken when it first appears or blight can kill the entire tree. Cut off each diseased sprig or branch, sterilizing your clippers in a chlorine-water solution (2:10) between cuts, and burn the cuttings. A streptomycin antibiotic spray is available to cure this sickness."|Cider|"Annie Proulx"
