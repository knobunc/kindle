Our copy editor rented their guest cottage, and we would turn on the lighthouse lantern for midnight badminton parties. Of course, all that’s gone now.”"|"Who Could That Be at This Hour_"|"Lemony Snicket"
00:00|midnight|"It struck me that it was probably not dust but sand on the shells, so that it was likely that the younger brother was the true owner of the seashell collection. It also struck me that it was not a good time to say this. My chaperone leaned in close to me. “What you are to do,” she said, “is break into the lighthouse sometime this evening and wait inside. At midnight exactly you will open the door for me and lead me to the item in question. This must go off without a hitch, Snicket. People are watching us.”"|"Who Could That Be at This Hour_"|"Lemony Snicket"
00:00|midnight|"Theodora shook her head. “I mean someone from our organization. Wherever a chaperone goes, there is someone keeping an eye on things. You don’t know this, Snicket, but out of fifty-two chaperones, I am ranked only tenth. If I solve this case quickly, my ranking will improve. Now off you go. I’ll see you at the lighthouse at midnight.”"|"Who Could That Be at This Hour_"|"Lemony Snicket"

I don’t think that’s true. I think the statue has been in your family for a very long time, since the days of Lady Mallahan, and I think that if it were very valuable, it wouldn’t be covered in a sheet with a bunch of dusty, forgotten items. But it doesn’t matter what I think. So I’m going to stay here until midnight, when my associate will arrive, and we will take the Bombinating Beast and escape down the hill on the hawser, and then my assignment will be over.”"|"Who Could That Be at This Hour_"|"Lemony Snicket"
00:00|midnight|"“Not according to my chaperone,” I said.
“Well, in that case, what are we going to do until midnight?”
At last it was a question I could answer. “I was hoping we could have dinner,” I said. “I’ve scarcely eaten today.”"|"Who Could That Be at This Hour_"|"Lemony Snicket"

Ellington looked at me and asked the question that is printed on the cover of this book. It was the wrong question, both when she asked it and later, when I asked it myself. The right question in this case was “What was happening while I was answering the door?” but when the hinges stopped creaking, I was thinking only of the Officers Mitchum, who were standing there with matching stern eyes."|"Who Could That Be at This Hour_"|"Lemony Snicket"
