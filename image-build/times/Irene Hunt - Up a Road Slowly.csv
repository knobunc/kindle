"ap 07:00"|seven|"What I didn’t realize was that at seventeen, Laura did not have the adaptability, the readiness to forget, that Christopher and I had at seven and nine. We thought of Mother often in the early days of our new life; sometimes we cried when we were homesick for  times that were gone, for the old sense of security within our family. But the days slipped by and the memory of Mother grew fainter, the rooms of the old house that had once been awesome and fearful became familiar and pleasant; school had its compensations, Uncle Haskell was a huge joke, and Aunt Cordelia was a challenge."|"Up a Road Slowly"|"Irene Hunt"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"And so she went back year after year, teaching from nine until four o’clock, then sweeping and dusting the room after school, carrying in great buckets of coal to bank the fire for the night, arriving at school an hour early on Monday mornings during the winter months in order to get the fire started and the room warm before the children arrived."|"Up a Road Slowly"|"Irene Hunt"
12:00|noon|"I used this incident to convince Aunt Cordelia that Aggie was no proper companion for the rest of us, who were considerably younger, that we had every right to shun her company. But Aunt Cordelia was not convinced. She saw to it that Aggie was included in all of our games, and what was hardest for us to bear, that Aggie was invited to join our little circle at lunchtime. Sometimes we would try sneaking away hurriedly at noon; inevitably we would hear a stern, “Julia—Elsa—Carlotta, I believe that you girls have forgotten to invite Agnes to go with you.”"|"Up a Road Slowly"|"Irene Hunt"
"~ 22:00"|"about ten that evening"|"My fear did not become a reality, however, until about ten that evening when Bill ruffled my hair and said, “Well, Laura, hadn’t we better let Aunt Julie get her beauty sleep now? She must be a little tired after her long train ride.” And Laura said, “Yes, darling, come along. I’ll show you the room you’re to have.”"|"Up a Road Slowly"|"Irene Hunt"
12:00|noon|"Compassion was not yet aroused within me, and the better nature that loved poetry and beauty was completely overshadowed the day of my twelfth birthday. Aunt Cordelia drove her car to school that morning because she was taking the two huge angel-food cakes that she had baked and iced the night before. I was invited to cut the cakes at noon and after sliding each piece on a napkin, to place my birthday offering on each pupil’s desk. It was a poor substitute for a party, and most of the girls felt as downcast and low spirited that noon as I did."|"Up a Road Slowly"|"Irene Hunt"
15:00|"three in the afternoon"|"One day in the fall of my twelfth year, Father called Aunt Cordelia, and I remember that her face flushed and then grew pale as she stood at the old-fashioned telephone anchored against the dining room wall. I heard her say, “Why, of course, Adam; I’d like very much to see Jonathan again and to meet Mrs. Eltwing. Why don’t you bring them out Saturday, say, at three in the afternoon?”"|"Up a Road Slowly"|"Irene Hunt"
10:00|"ten that morning"|"Fortunately it was chilly enough to warrant a fire in both fireplaces, and so we laid the kindling and wood, all ready to be lighted a half hour before our guests were expected. I polished the silver coffee service and set it on a low table in front of the fire, and Aunt Cordelia brought out a collection of little cakes and rolls which she had baked at ten that morning in order that they be oven-fresh."|"Up a Road Slowly"|"Irene Hunt"
"ap 02:30"|two-thirty|"The fires were crackling brightly at two-thirty, and the reflection of flame was deep in the polished mahogany lid of Uncle Haskell’s grand piano, in the old wine decanter and the silver coffee service. Outside, the day was perfect with bright skies and the gay colors of our wooded surroundings. If Jonathan Eltwing had  ever loved this old place, it must have wakened memories for him that afternoon."|"Up a Road Slowly"|"Irene Hunt"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"Father drove up with Dr. and Mrs. Eltwing precisely at three o’clock; he knew Aunt Cordelia well enough to respect her passion for punctuality. I watched them walk up the brick-paved path to the porch where Aunt Cordelia stood waiting to greet them: Jonathan Eltwing so tall and huge as to dwarf my handsome and rather tall father; Mrs. Eltwing, a tiny, graceful woman wearing a pale gray velvet suit with a frilly blouse and a heavy gold pin at her throat. She had great, strangely brilliant eyes that dominated her tiny face and a mass of half-blonde, half-gray hair that she drew back smoothly from her forehead and wore in a great bun close to her neck. She was a lovely little creature with an air of childlike sweetness and innocence; she stood smiling and looking off into our bright woods as Jonathan Eltwing took Aunt Cordelia’s hand in both his own and stood looking at her as if he were searching for the girl he had once known. I was proud of Aunt Cordelia; she looked slim and elegant standing there in the autumn sunlight, not once losing her cool composure as she greeted Jonathan Eltwing and his wife. I noticed that Father kissed her with special tenderness as if he understood that it was a difficult moment for her."|"Up a Road Slowly"|"Irene Hunt"

00:00|midnight|"“It isn’t that, Aunt Cordelia, it isn’t the cooking at midnight or leaving the dishes. It’s just—” I tried to find the right words. “It’s just the flexibility of a way of living.”"|"Up a Road Slowly"|"Irene Hunt"

If any one of you wishes to talk with me about the assignment, you may make an appointment with me during one of my office hours.” She flipped a few cards through her fingers as the bell rang, studied the notations briefly and then added, “I should like to see Jim Ferris for a short time at eleven; Norma Grayson at four this afternoon; Julie Trelling at four-fifteen. That is all. You are dismissed.”"|"Up a Road Slowly"|"Irene Hunt"

"ap ~ 04:30"|"about four-thirty"|"I had been wondering about the same thing. “I don’t know, Brett; maybe something about my schedule for  next year.” I could hardly tear myself away at the door of my next class. “Will you meet me outside her office about four-thirty?” I asked."|"Up a Road Slowly"|"Irene Hunt"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"It was getting late when Brett finally called to ask if he could come out for a while and talk over our English assignment. He sounded sleepy and morose; I thought of what Danny had said about his having a beauty nap, but I pushed the thought aside and told him joyfully that yes, he might come out. Aunt Cordelia, who sat beside the table reading, said, “Until ten, Julia; no later.” She didn’t lift her eyes from her book."|"Up a Road Slowly"|"Irene Hunt"
"ap 10:00"|"Ten o’clock"|"Uncle Haskell disposed of me in a hurry. “Julie, my pet, I think you’d better run along now. Brett can tell you his good news tomorrow. I have an idea that Aunt Cordelia would like you safe inside. Ten o’clock comes on apace, you know.”"|"Up a Road Slowly"|"Irene Hunt"
