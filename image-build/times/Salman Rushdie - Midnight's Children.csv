When he learned of Pia's betrayal, Hanif took himself up to the roof of his apartment block and stepped out into the evening sea breeze.

How many? (he shrugs) Thirty thousand. A quarter of a million. A small percentage of the population of India. Your gang of freaks will also be smashed. With your help."|"Midnight's Children"|"Salman Rushdie"
00:00|Midnight|"Saleem The truest, deepest motive behind the declaration of a State of Emergency was the smashing and the pulverising of Midnight's Children.
