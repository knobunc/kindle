"~ 12:00"|"about 1200 hours"|"In Chapter 11 we had a four-colour problem and a five-colour theorem. On 22 July 1972 two mathematicians at the University of Illinois, Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken, announced a proof1 that every map on the plane can be coloured with four colours, resolving the long-standing question. The snag with their proof is that it involves an immense amount of computing time - they used about 1200 hours, but a check might be performed in 300 on a big machine - and a single error might destroy the proof completely. Contrary to popular opinion, computers do make errors even when their programmers do not. The problems raised by this are as much philosophical as technical (is a proof checked by a human any more likely to be accurate than one checked by computer?) and look like causing some problems in future. At the present moment, the Appel—Haken proof has not been fully checked by an independent program, although those parts that have been checked appear to be error-free. Philosophy apart, most mathematicians would probably agree that the theorem is proved provided such a check is carried out in full. The philosophical problem is an interesting one, however, because it involves the difference between a logical proof and a satisfactory one. I shall return to this once we’ve seen how it goes."|"Concepts of Modern Mathematics"|"Ian Stewart"

"ap 04:00"|4|"By writing out multiplication tables to the moduli 2, 3, 4, 5, . . . it becomes apparent that division (except by zero) is always possible if the modulus is 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, . . . and is not always possible if it is 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, . . . It doesn’t take a genius to recognize the pattern. The first list of numbers looks like the sequence of prime numbers (with no divisors other than themselves and 1); the second seems to be the composite numbers (which can be expressed as a product of two smaller ones)."|"Concepts of Modern Mathematics"|"Ian Stewart"

At exactly 9 o’clock on Monday morning he sets off up the mountain, arriving at 6 o’clock in the evening at a mountain hut, where he stays the night. At 9 o’clock the next morning he descends by the same route, arriving at the point from which he set out at 6 o’clock in the evening.

"~ 07:30"|"about prime"|"Although I have talked in terms of divisions of mathematics into various branches - algebra, topology, analysis, logic, geometry, number theory, probability — it must be realized that no exact boundaries can be drawn, and that the divisions themselves are somewhat arbitrary. When Descartes first discovered connections between geometry and algebra it was a surprise. When Galois applied the theory of groups to polynomial equations it was a surprise. When Hadamard and de la Vallée Poussin proved an important conjecture about prime numbers using analysis it was a surprise. Today mathematicians are no longer surprised by such occurrences. In fact they tend to go out looking for them. It is quite commonplace to start with a problem in analysis, turn it into topology, reduce it to algebra, and solve it by number theory."|"Concepts of Modern Mathematics"|"Ian Stewart"
