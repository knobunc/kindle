Have you ever had friends or roommates who seldom come through? They say they’ll call you and they don’t. They promise to pick you up for the game and they forget. After a while, you don’t trust them. Their commitments mean nothing. The same thing occurs when you continually make and break self-promises, such as “I’m going to get up at six tomorrow morning” or “I’m going to get my homework done right when I get home.” After a while, you don’t trust yourself."|"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens"|"Sean Covey"
"ap 04:11"|"four hours and eleven minutes"|"He told Bryce all about it. A climbing ranger named Jock Glidden had set a record on the Grand by running to the top and back in four hours and eleven minutes. “That’s absolutely impossible,” thought Bryce. “I’d like to meet this guy someday.” But as Bryce continued to do these types of runs, his times became faster and Kim kept saying, “You must go after the record. I know you could do it.”"|"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens"|"Sean Covey"
"ap 03:47"|"three hours, forty-seven minutes"|"Early in the morning on August 26, 1981, carrying a small orange backpack and a light jacket, Bryce ran to the top of the Grand and back in three hours, forty-seven minutes, and four seconds. He stopped only twice: once to take rocks out of his shoes and once to sign the register at the summit to prove he had been there. He felt marvelous! He had actually broken the record!"|"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens"|"Sean Covey"
"ap 03:30"|"three hours, thirty minutes"|"A few years later, Bryce received a surprise call from Kim. “Bryce, have you heard? Your record has just been broken.” Of course, he added, “You need to get it back. I know you can do it!” A man named Creighton King, who had recently won the heralded Pike’s Peak Marathon in Colorado, dashed to the top and back in three hours, thirty minutes, and nine seconds."|"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens"|"Sean Covey"
"ap 01:53"|"one hour and fifty-three minutes"|"Bryce took off running. As he ascended up, up, up the mountain, his heart pounded and his legs burned. Concentration was intense. Scaling the last 700 feet in twelve minutes, he reached the summit in one hour and fifty-three minutes and placed his verification card under a rock. He knew that if he were to break King’s record he would have to do it coming down. The descent became so steep at times that he was taking ten- to fifteen-foot strides. He passed some friends who later told him his face had turned purple from oxygen depletion. Another climbing party apparently knew he was going for the record because, as he passed, they yelled, “Go! Go!”"|"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens"|"Sean Covey"
"ap 03:06"|"three hours, six minutes"|"Amid cheers, Bryce returned to Lupine Meadows with bleeding knees, thrashed tennis shoes, and one horrific headache, three hours, six minutes, and twenty-five seconds after he had left.

"ap 02:58"|"two to three"|"My mom read an article that said if a young kid slept ten hours a night in a completely dark room and drank two to three extra glasses of milk a day, he could grow one to two inches more than he normally would. I believed this and followed it rigidly. After all, I needed to reach my goal of six feet, and my dad’s height of five feet ten inches wasn’t going to help me. “Dad,” I said, “I want the darkest room in the house.” I got it. Then I put towels under the door crack and over the window. No light was going to shine on me!"|"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens"|"Sean Covey"

You’ll know when you cross that line. Watching that first TV show might be just what you need to relax, and that’s okay. But then watching the second, third, or even fourth show (a rerun that you’ve seen six times) until 2 A.M. turns a relaxing evening into a wasted one."|"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens"|"Sean Covey"
"ap 11:00"|11:00|"Keeping small commitments and promises is vital to building trust. You must do what you say you’re going to do. If you tell your mom you’re going to be home at 11:00 or that you will do the dishes tonight, then do it and make a deposit. Give out promises sparingly, and then do everything you can to keep them. If you find you can’t keep a commitment for some reason (it happens), then let the other person know why. “Little sister, I’m really sorry I can’t come to your play tonight. I didn’t realize I had a debate meet. But I’ll be there tomorrow.” If you’re genuine and try to keep your promises, people will understand when something interferes."|"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens"|"Sean Covey"
