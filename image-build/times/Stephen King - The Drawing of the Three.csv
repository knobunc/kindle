Three now, three later, he said. If there is a later.
All right. Thank you."|"The Drawing of the Three"|"Stephen King"
"ap 03:00"|Three|"Still, he would have to try it. Not the stuff he really needed—or so Eddie believed—but something which might reduce his fever.
Three now, three later. If there is a later.
He put three of the pills in his mouth, then pushed the cover—some strange white stuff that was neither paper nor glass but which seemed a bit like both—off the paper cup which held the drink, and washed them down."|"The Drawing of the Three"|"Stephen King"
"ap ~ 04:00"|"around four o’clock"|"Eddie finished his tale around four o’clock on the third day of their northward journey up the featureless beach. The beach itself never seemed to change. If a sign of progress was wanted, it could only be obtained by looking left, to the east. There the jagged peaks of the mountains had begun to soften and slump a bit. It was possible that if they went north far enough, the mountains would become rolling hills."|"The Drawing of the Three"|"Stephen King"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"Sometimes Odetta disappeared. These disappearances might be a matter of hours or of days. Last summer she had disappeared for three weeks and Andrew had been ready to call the police when Odetta called him one evening and asked him to bring the car around at ten the next day—she planned to do some shopping, she said."|"The Drawing of the Three"|"Stephen King"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"Howard had been right. It sure had been one hell of a bruise, and now it was getting better. Andrew didn’t like to think what it might have looked like when it was fresh. Miz Holmes appeared promptly at ten the next morning, wearing a silk sundress with spaghetti-thin straps (this had been late July), and by then the bruise had started to yellow. She had made only a perfunctory effort to cover it with make-up, as if knowing that too much effort to cover it would only draw further attention to it."|"The Drawing of the Three"|"Stephen King"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"“Yes, Miz Holmes,” he had said, and smiled. It was a forced smile, and forcing it was not easy. That bruise wasn’t a day old; it was a week old, at least . . . and he knew better, anyway, didn’t he? He had called her every night at seven o’clock for the last week, because if there was one time when you could catch Miz Holmes in her place, it was when the Huntley-Brinkley Report came on. A regular junkie for her news was Miz Holmes. He had done it every night, that was, except last night. Then he had gone over and wheedled the passkey from Howard. A conviction had been growing on him steadily that she had had just the sort of accident she had described . . . only instead of getting a bruise or a broken bone, she had died, died alone, and was lying up there dead right now. He had let himself in, heart thumping, feeling like a cat in a dark room criss-crossed with piano wires. Only there had been nothing to be nervous about. There was a butter-dish on the kitchen counter, and although the butter had been covered it had been out long enough to be growing a good crop of mould. He got there at ten minutes of seven and had left by five after. In the course of his quick examination of the apartment, he had glanced into the bathroom. The tub had been dry, the towels neatly—even austerely—arrayed, the room’s many grab-handles polished to a bright steel gleam that was unspotted with water."|"The Drawing of the Three"|"Stephen King"

I bathed and I wanted sleep—I was getting a very bad headache, and sleep is the only medicine that’s any good for the really bad ones. But it was close on midnight, and I thought I would watch the news first. Some of us had been released, but a good many more were still in the jug when we left. I wanted to find out if their cases had been resolved."|"The Drawing of the Three"|"Stephen King"
00:00|midnight|"“Yeah,” Eddie said, “but forget that for now. I’m trying to say that, no matter what she believes, what she remembers goes right from her living room where she was sitting in her bathrobe watching the midnight news to here, with no break at all. She doesn’t have any sense that some other person took over between then and when you grabbed her in Macy’s. Hell, that might have been the next day or even weeks later. I know it was still winter, because most of the shoppers in that store were wearing coats—”"|"The Drawing of the Three"|"Stephen King"

Eddie and the gunslinger ate leftovers from the previous night’s kill. Eddie offered a portion to Detta, who again refused, telling him she knew what they wanted to do, and if they wanted to do it, they best to do it with their bare hands and stop trying to poison her. That, she said, was the coward’s way."|"The Drawing of the Three"|"Stephen King"

Something—run-off, he supposed, or flooding at some rainy season (there had been none since he had been in this world, not a drop; the sky had clouded over a few times, but then the clouds had blown away again)—had worn most of the jutting rocks away.
At nine-thirty, Odetta cried: “Stop, Eddie! Stop!”
He stopped so abruptly that she had to grab the arms of the chair to keep from tumbling out. He was around to her in a flash."|"The Drawing of the Three"|"Stephen King"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"The tide came full as the sun swooned toward the water; and at what might have been four o’clock—Odetta said so, and since she had said she was good at telling the sun (and because she was his beloved), Eddie believed her—they reached the door."|"The Drawing of the Three"|"Stephen King"

He looked like nothing so much as a little squirt who had tried to stay up until midnight on New Year’s Eve and lost the race. Then she remembered the way he and the Really Bad Man had tried to get her to eat poison food and teased her with their own, always snatching away at the last second . . . at least until they got scared she might die."|"The Drawing of the Three"|"Stephen King"

He lay there with his head in the grass, already fading toward what could be sleep or unconsciousness or death. He looked into the sky and tried to judge the time. Not noon, but the size of the puddle of shade in which he rested said noon was close. He held on a moment longer, turning his right arm over and bringing it close to his eyes, looking for the telltale red lines of infection, of some poison seeping steadily toward the middle of him."|"The Drawing of the Three"|"Stephen King"

Sunday night he brings the coke and you give him the key to the safe deposit box. Monday morning you do the routine just like Balazar said. This guy will play; he knows how it’s supposed to go.

He felt like moving; felt like slipping and sliding, bipping and bopping, shucking and jiving, scratching his scratches and cracking his crackers. He even felt his eyes wanting to slide back to the pile of brown powder, although he knew it was poison. He had fixed at ten that morning; the same number of hours had gone by since then. But if he did any of those things, the situation would change. The sallow thing was doing more than cogitating; it was watching him, trying to calculate the depth of him."|"The Drawing of the Three"|"Stephen King"
