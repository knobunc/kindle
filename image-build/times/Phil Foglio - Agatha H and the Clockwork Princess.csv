00:00|midnight|"The first report was from Doktor Øy, the minor Spark in charge of the laboratory decks. Øy was accompanied by a squat clank that scooted about upon a single small wheel, clutching a bundle of notes in its manipulators and blinking two large round lensed “eyes” that gave it an owlish look. “Some time between midnight and 2 A.M.,” Øy began, “Someone activated the Hive Engine that my Baron discovered in the possession of the late Doctor Tarsus Beetle. It had been placed in the Large Dangerous Mechanical Lab. Doctor Vg was listed as working late in that lab. So far, we have yet to find Doctor Vg.”"|"Agatha H and the Clockwork Princess"|"Phil Foglio"

She deflected arrows and sliced the tops off pikes with a sword that was easily two meters long. It wasn’t so much a battle as it was a rout."|"Agatha H and the Clockwork Princess"|"Phil Foglio"

From another inside pocket he drew out a bizarrely shaped key. “This will allow you access to the controls for the lightning moat and the drawbridge. From what I’ve been able to observe of the crowds outside, Anevka should be ready to move.” He glanced out the window and gauged the lightening sky. “We want everything done in daylight, so let her in when the tower clock strikes seven.”"|"Agatha H and the Clockwork Princess"|"Phil Foglio"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"17 Lilith, Agatha’s foster mother, had been an exuberant proponent of the preserving, canning, drying and pickling of various fruits and vegetables. Agatha had once complained that this might make sense if the Clays managed a farm, but in fact, they lived in town, and all of the produce they processed was purchased from local green-grocers. Lilith had said nothing at the time, but that night, Agatha awakened and discovered that, after midnight, her parents’ forge served as a gathering place for constructs she had never seen before. These were twisted, bizarre creations. Things that could never feel comfortable out in public, despite the Baron’s laws enforcing tolerance. They labored in the many unseen jobs offered by the University. Despite their often horrific appearance, Agatha found them to be intelligent, well-read, and urbane, in their own strange way. It was these creatures who received the bulk of the preserved food. The Clays always refused direct payment, but Agatha now understood the source of the many odd and useful things that appeared overnight upon the Clay’s doorstep."|"Agatha H and the Clockwork Princess"|"Phil Foglio"
