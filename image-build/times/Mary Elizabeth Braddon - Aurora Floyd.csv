  Chapter VI

Rejected and Accepted.




  
  


  The dinner-party at Mr.Floyd's was a very merry one; and when John Mellish and Talbot Bulstrode left the East Cliff to walk westward, at eleven o'clock at night, the Yorkshireman told his friend that he had never enjoyed himself so much in his life. This declaration must, however, be taken with some reserve; for it was one which John was in the habit of making about three times a week: but he really had been very happy in the society of the banker's family; and, what was more, he was ready to adore Aurora Floyd without any further preparation whatever.




  
  


  A few bright smiles and sparkling glances, a little animated conversation about the hunting-field and the race-course, combined with half a dozen glasses of those effervescent wines which Archibald Floyd imported from the fair Moselle country, had been quite enough to turn the head of John Mellish, and to cause him to hold wildly forth in the moonlight upon the merits of the beautiful heiress.




  
  


  I verily believe I shall die a bachelor, Talbot, he said, unless I can get that girl to marry me. I've only known her half a dozen hours, and I'm head-over-heels in love with her already. What is it that has knocked me over like this, Bulstrode? I've seen other girls with black eyes and hair, and she knows no more of horses than half the women in Yorkshire; so it isn't that. What is it, then, hey?




  
  


  He came to a full stop against a lamp-post, and stared fiercely at his friend as he asked this question.




  
  


  Talbot gnashed his teeth in silence.




  
  


  It was no use battling with his fate, then, he thought; the fascination of this woman had the same effect upon others as upon himself; and while he was arguing with, and protesting against, his passion, some brainless fellow, like this Mellish, would step in and win the prize.




  
  


  He wished his friend good night upon the steps of the Old Ship Hotel, and walked straight to his room, where he sat with his window open to the mild November night, staring out at the moon-lit sea. He"|"Aurora Floyd"|"Mary Elizabeth Braddon"
"ap 00:00"|"twelve o'clock"|"Page 110
  
  


  determined to propose to Aurora Floyd before twelve o'clock the next day.




  
  


  Why should he hesitate?




  
  


  He had asked himself that question a hundred times before, and had always been unable to answer it; and yet he had hesitated. He could not dispossess himself of a vague idea that there was some mystery in this girl's life; some secret known only to herself and her father; some one spot upon the history of the past which cast a shadow on the present. And yet, how could that be? How could that be, he asked himself, when her whole life only amounted to nineteen years, and he had heard the history of those years over and over again? How often he had artfully led Lucy to tell him the simple story of her cousin's girlhood! The governesses and masters that had come and gone at Felden Woods. The ponies and dogs, and puppies and kittens, and petted foals; the little scarlet riding-habit that had been made for the heiress, when she rode after the hounds with her cousin Andrew Floyd. The worst blots that the officer could discover in those early years were a few broken china vases, and a great deal of ink spilt over badly-written French exercises. And after being educated at home until she was nearly eighteen, Aurora had been transferred to a Parisian finishing-school; and that was all. Her life had been the every-day life of other girls of her own position, and she differed from them only in being a great deal more fascinating, and a little more wilful, than the majority.




  
  


  Talbot laughed at himself for his doubts and hesitations. What a suspicious brute I must be, he said, when I imagine I have fallen upon the clue to some mystery simply because there is a mournful tenderness in the old man's voice when he speaks to his only child! If I were sixty-seven years of age, and had such a daughter as Aurora, would there not always be a shuddering terror mingled with my love, - a horrible dread that something would happen to take her away from me? I will propose to Miss Floyd to-morrow.




  
  


  Had Talbot been thoroughly candid with himself, he would perhaps have added, Or John Mellish will make her an offer the day after.

  night. Captain Bulstrode sat near one of the open windows, watching that tranquil scene, with, I fear, very little appreciation of its beauty. He was wishing that the people would drop off and leave him alone with Aurora. It was close upon eleven o'clock, and high time they went. John Mellish would of course insist upon waiting for Talbot; this was what a man had to endure on account of some old schoolboy acquaintance. All Rugby1 might turn up against him in a day or two, and dispute with him for Aurora's smiles. But John Mellish was engaged in a very animated conversation with Archibald Floyd, having contrived with consummate artifice to ingratiate himself in the old man's favour, and the visitors having one by one dropped off, Aurora, with a listless yawn that she took little pains to conceal, strolled out on to the broad iron balcony. Lucy was sitting at a table at the other end of the room, looking at a book of beauty.2 Oh, my poor Lucy! how much did you see of the Honourable Miss Brownsmith's high forehead and Roman nose? Did not that young lady's handsome face stare up at you dimly through a blinding mist of tears that you were a great deal too well educated to shed? The chance had come at last. If life had been a Haymarket comedy, and the entrances and exits arranged by Mr. Buckstone3 himself, it could have fallen out no better than this. Talbot Bulstrode followed Aurora on to the balcony; John Mellish went on with his story about the Beverley foxhounds; and Lucy, holding her breath at the other end of the room, knew as well what was going to happen as the captain himself.




  
  


  Is not life altogether a long comedy, with Fate for the stage-manager, and Passion, Inclination, Love, Hate, Revenge, Ambition, and Avarice by turns in the prompter's box? A tiresome comedy sometimes, with dreary, talkee-talkee front scenes which come to nothing, but only serve to make the audience more impatient as they wait

  called her Lucy for the first time; but what did it matter now? His great affliction set him apart from his fellow-men, and gave him dismal privileges. Good-night, Lucy; good-night and good-bye. I - I - shall hope to see you again - in a year or two.




  
  


  The pavement of the East Cliff seemed so much air beneath Talbot Bulstrode's boots as he strode back to the Old Ship; for it is peculiar to us, in our moments of supreme trouble or joy, to lose all consciousness of the earth we tread, and to float upon an atmosphere of sublime egotism.




  
  


  But the captain did not leave Brighton the next day on the first stage of his Egyptian journey. He stayed at the fashionable watering-place; but he resolutely abjured the neighbourhood of the East Cliff, and, the day being wet, took a pleasant walk to Shoreham through the rain; and Shoreham being such a pretty place, he was no doubt much enlivened by that exercise.




  
  


  Returning through the fog at about four o'clock, the captain met Mr. John Mellish close against the turnpike outside Cliftonville.




  
  


  The two men stared aghast at each other.




  
  


  Why, where on earth are you going? asked Talbot.




  
  


  Back to Yorkshire by the first train that leaves Brighton.




  
  


  But this isn't the way to the station!




  
  


  No; but they're putting the horses in my portmanteau, and my shirts are going by the Leeds cattle-train; and




  
  


  Talbot Bulstrode burst into a loud laugh, a harsh and bitter cachinnation, but affording wondrous relief to that gentleman's overcharged breast.




  
  


  John Mellish, he said, you have been proposing to Aurora Floyd.




  
  


  The Yorkshireman turned scarlet. It - it - wasn't honourable of her to tell you, he stammered.




  
  


  Miss Floyd has never breathed a word to me upon the subject. I've just come from Shoreham, and you've only lately left the East Cliff. You've proposed, and you've been rejected.




  
  


  I have, roared John; and it's deuced hard when I promised her she should keep a racing stud if she liked, and enter as many colts as she pleased for the Derby, and give her own orders to the trainer, and I'd never interfere; - and - and Mellish Park is one of the finest places"|"Aurora Floyd"|"Mary Elizabeth Braddon"
"ap 08:45"|8.45|"Page 120
  
  


  in the county; and I'd have won her a bit of blue ribbon to tie up her bonny black hair.




  
  


  That old Frenchman was right, muttered Captain Bulstrode: there is a great satisfaction in the misfortune of others.1 If I go to my dentist, I like to find another wretch in the waiting-room; and I like to have my tooth extracted first, and to see him glare enviously at me as I come out of the torture chamber, knowing that my troubles are over, while his are to come. Good-bye, John Mellish, and God bless you. You're not such a bad fellow after all.




  
  


  Talbot felt almost cheerful as he walked back to the Ship, and he took a mutton cutlet and tomata sauce, and a pint of Moselle for his dinner: and the food and wine warmed him; and not having slept a wink on the previous night, he fell into a heavy indigestible slumber, with his head hanging over the sofa-cushion, and dreamt that he was at Grand Cairo (or at a place which would have been that city had it not been now and then Bulstrode Castle, and occasionally chambers in the Albany); and that Aurora Floyd was with him, clad in imperial purple, with hieroglyphics on the hem of her robe, and wearing a clown's jacket of white satin and scarlet spots, such as he had once seen foremost in a great race. Captain Bulstrode arose early the next morning, with the full intention of departing from Sussex by the 8.45 express; but suddenly remembering that he had but poorly acknowledged Archibald Floyd's cordiality, he determined on sacrificing his inclinations on the shrine of courtesy, and calling once more at the East Cliff to take leave of the banker. Having once resolved upon this line of action, the captain would fain have hurried that moment to Mr. Floyd's house; but finding that it was only half-past seven, he was compelled to restrain his impatience and await a more seasonable hour. Could he go at nine? Scarcely. At ten? Yes, surely, as he could then leave by the eleven o'clock train. He sent his breakfast away untouched, and sat looking at his watch in a mad hurry for the time to pass, yet growing hot and uncomfortable as the hour drew near.




  
  


  At a quarter to ten he put on his hat and left the hotel. Mr. Floyd

  made by her own white hands; but Aurora gave the half-sovereigns and the old sherry; and I'm afraid these simple cottagers liked the heiress best; although they were wise enough and just enough to know that each lady gave according to her means.




  
  


  It was in returning from a round of these charitable visits that an adventure befel the little party, which was by no means pleasing to Captain Bulstrode.




  
  


  Aurora had driven further than usual, and it was striking four as her ponies dashed past Beckenham church and down the hill towards Felden Woods. The afternoon was cold and cheerless; light flakes of snow drifted across the hard road, and hung here and there upon the leafless hedges, and there was that inky blackness in the sky which presages a heavy fall. The woman at the lodge ran out with her apron over her head to open the gates as Miss Floyd's ponies approached, and at the same moment a man rose from a bank by the roadside, and came close up to the little carriage.




  
  


  He was a broad-shouldered, stout-built fellow, wearing a shabby velveteen cut-away coat, slashed about with abnormal pockets, and white and greasy at the seams and elbows. His chin was muffled in two or three yards of dirty woollen comforter, after the fashion of his kind; and the band of his low-crowned felt hat was ornamented with a short clay pipe, coloured of a respectable blackness. A dingy white dog, with a brass-collar, bow legs, a short nose, blood-shot eyes, one ear, a hanging jaw, and a generally supercilious expression of countenance, rose from the bank at the same moment with his master, and growled ominously at the elegant vehicle and the mastiff Bow-wow trotting by its side.




  
  


  The stranger was the same individual who had accosted Miss Floyd in Cockspur Street three months before.




  
  


  I do not know whether Aurora recognized this person; but I know that she touched her ponies' ears with the whip, and that the spirited animals had dashed past the man, and through the gates of Felden, when he sprang forward, caught at their heads, and stopped the light basket-carriage, which rocked under the force of his strong hand.




  
  


  Talbot Bulstrode leapt from the vehicle, heedless of his stiff leg, and caught the man by the collar."|"Aurora Floyd"|"Mary Elizabeth Braddon"

  me at this season, and it is the only time that Felden seems like an old man's home. Your friend Bulstrode stops with us (Mellish winced as he received this intelligence), and I sha'n't think it friendly if you refuse to join our party.




  
  


  What a pitiful coward this John Mellish must have been to accept the banker's invitation, and send the Newport Pagnell1 back to the Gloucester, and suffer himself to be led away by Mr. Floyd's own man to a pleasant chamber, a few doors from the chintz-rooms occupied by Talbot! But I have said before, that love is a cowardly passion. It is like the toothache; the bravest and strongest succumb to it, and howl aloud under the torture. I don't suppose the Iron Duke2 would have been ashamed to own that he objected to having his teeth out. I have heard of a great fighting man who could take punishment better than any other of the genii of the ring, but who fainted away at the first grip of the dentist's forceps. John Mellish consented to stay at Felden, and he went between the lights into Talbot's dressing-room, to expostulate with the captain upon his treachery.




  
  


  Talbot did his best to console his doleful visitant.




  
  


  There are more women than one in the world, he said, after John had unbosomed himself of his grief - he didn't think this, the hypocrite, though he said it - there are more women than one, my dear Mellish; and there are many very charming and estimable girls, who would be glad to win the affections of such a fellow as you.




  
  


  I hate estimable girls, said Mr. Mellish; bother my affections! nobody will ever win my affections; but I love her, I love that beautiful black-eyed creature down-stairs, who looks at you with two flashes of lightning, and rides like young Challoner in a cloth habit;3 I love her, Bulstrode, and you told me that she'd refused you, and that you were going to leave Brighton by the eight o'clock express, and you didn't; and you sneaked back and made her a second offer, and she accepted you, and, damme, it wasn't fair play.

  youngest of them, burning his fingers with blazing raisins, suffering his eyes to be bandaged at the will of noisy little players at blindman'sbuff, undergoing ignominious penalties in their games of forfeits, performing alternately innkeepers, sheriff's officers, policemen, clergymen, and justices, in the acted charades, lifting the little ones who wanted to see de top of de Kitmat tee in his sturdy arms, and making himself otherwise agreeable and useful to young people of from three to fifteen years of age; until at last, under the influence of all this juvenile gaiety, and perhaps two or three glasses of Moselle, he boldly kissed Aurora Floyd beneath the branch of mistletoe, hanging, for this night only, in the great hall at Felden Woods.




  
  


  And having done this, Mr. Mellish fairly lost his wits, and was off his head for the rest of the evening; making speeches to the little ones at the supper-table, and proposing Mr. Archibald Floyd and the commercial interests of Great Britain, with three times three; leading the chorus of those tiny treble voices with his own sonorous bass; and weeping freely - he never quite knew why - behind his table-napkin. It was through an atmosphere of tears, and sparkling wines, and gas, and hot-house flowers, that he saw Aurora Floyd, looking, ah, how lovely! in those simple robes of white which so much became her, and with a garland of artificial holly round her head. The spiked leaves and the scarlet berries formed themselves into a crown - I think, indeed, that a cheese-plate would have been transformed into a diadem, if Miss Floyd had been pleased to put it on her head - and she looked like the genius of Christmas: something bright and beautiful; too beautiful to come more than once a year.




  
  


  When the clocks were striking 2 A.M., long after the little ones had been carried away muffled up in opera-cloaks, terribly sleepy, and I'm afraid in some instances under the influence of strong drink, - when the elder guests had all retired to rest, and the lights, with a few exceptions, were fled, the garlands dead, and all but Talbot and John Mellish departed, the two young men walked up and down the long billiard-room, in the red glow of the two declining fires, and talked to each other confidentially. It was the morning of Christmas-day, and it would have been strange to be unfriendly at such a time.

Fighting The Battle.




  
  


  The new year began in sadness at Felden Woods, for it found Archibald Floyd watching in the sick-room of his only daughter.




  
  


  Aurora had taken her place at the long dinner-table upon the night of Talbot's departure; and except for being perhaps a little more vivacious and brilliant than usual, her manner had in no way changed after that terrible interview in the bay-windowed room. She had talked to John Mellish, and had played and sung to her younger cousins; she had stood behind her father, looking over his cards through all the fluctuating fortunes of a rubber of long whist; and the next morning her maid had found her in a raging fever, with burning cheeks and blood-shot eyes, her long purple-black hair all tumbled and tossed about the pillows, and her dry hands scorching to the touch. The telegraph brought two grave London physicians to Felden before noon; and the house was clear of visitors by nightfall, only Mrs. Alexander and Lucy remaining to assist in nursing the invalid. The West-End doctors said very little. This fever was as other fevers to them. The young lady had caught a cold perhaps; she had been imprudent, as these young people will be, and had received some sudden chill. She had very likely over-heated herself with dancing, or had sat in a draught, or eaten an ice. There was no immediate danger to be apprehended. The patient had a superb constitution; there was wonderful vitality in the system; and with careful treatment she would soon come round. Careful treatment meant a two-guinea visit every day from each of these learned gentlemen; though, perhaps, had they given utterance to their inmost thoughts, they would have owned that, for all they could tell to the contrary, Aurora Floyd wanted nothing but to be let alone, and left in a darkened chamber to fight out the battle by herself. But the banker would have had all Saville Row1 summoned to the sick-bed of his child, if he could by such a measure

  women on horseback will be jostled and mixed up with inappropriate (lower-class, male) company. Aurora's sexual relationship with Conyers takes place in a tactful lacuna reminiscent of Gaskell's Ruth (1853), but the Victorian convention which associated women's unchaperoned riding with sexual permissiveness, together with the contemporary slang meaning of ride to indicate sexual intercourse, meant that when Aurora is absent with the handsome young groom from 2 p.m. to sunset, and returns her thorough-bred chestnut with heaving and foam-flecked sides (64), Victorian readers would have understood clearly why the heroine is hurriedly sent off to school. And while Braddon may, as Henry James put it, [save] the proprieties
24 by marrying Aurora to Conyers, the fact that this particular sexually suggestive episode occurs outside marriage says little for the heroine's chastity.




  
  


  Repeated references to Aurora's abundant black hair reinforce the heroine's association with uncontrolled sexual urges. W. Fraser Rae observed that Braddon is obsessed with Aurora's hair, which is variously described as black, blue-black, dead-black, and lastly purple-black, and as arranged in a diadem, a coronet, serpentine coils, and blue-black snakes.25 Again, specific Victorian codes are at work here: according to the conventions of heroine description, dark, abundant, and untrammelled hair represents sexual and emotional volatility. And this strong suggestion of sexual disorder works in tandem with a slew of references linking Aurora with passionate and transgressive women: Cleopatra, Lady Macbeth, Nell Gwynne, Lola Montez, and Charlotte Corday.




  
  


  Not that dark-haired sexual adventuresses are rare in nineteenthcentury literature. But Braddon goes some way towards suggesting that this Cleopatra with  a taste for horseflesh (80) will make a better wife and mother than her blonde and chaste cousin Lucy, the very embodiment of the Victorian angel. This conservative ideal is described by Talbot Bulstrode, who seeks some gentle and feminine creature spotless as her own white robes, excelling in all womanly graces and accomplishments, but only exhibiting them in the narrow circle of a home (86). Braddon makes it clear that Lucy represents the perfection of conventional womanhood: her education and manners are faultless; her emotions are impeccably controlled; she is beau-"|"Aurora Floyd"|"Mary Elizabeth Braddon"

  Her joyous gladness in the bright summer's day had forsaken her as suddenly as she had met Stephen Hargraves; that bright smile, which was even brighter than the morning sunshine, faded out, and left her face unnaturally grave.




  
  


  Good heavens! she exclaimed, how foolish I am! I am actually afraid of that man, - afraid of that pitiful coward who could hurt my feeble old dog. As if such a creature as that could do one any mischief!




  
  


  Of course this was very wisely argued, as no coward ever by any chance worked any mischief upon this earth since the Saxon prince was stabbed in the back while drinking at his kinswoman's gate, or since brave King John and his creature plotted together what they should do with the little boy Arthur.1




  
  


  Aurora walked slowly across the lawn towards that end of the house at which the apartment sacred to Mr. Mellish was situated. She entered softly at the open window, and laid her hand upon John's shoulder, as he sat at a table covered with a litter of account-books, racing-lists, and disorderly papers.




  
  


  He started at the touch of the familiar hand.




  
  


  My darling, I'm so glad you've come in. How long you've been!




  
  


  She looked at her little jewelled watch. Poor John had loaded her with trinkets and gewgaws. His chief grief was that she was a wealthy heiress, and that he could give her nothing but the adoration of his simple, honest heart.




  
  


  Only half-past one, you silly old John, she said. What made you think me late?




  
  


  Because I wanted to consult you about something, and to tell you something. Such good news!




  
  


  About what?




  
  


  About the trainer.




  
  


  She shrugged her shoulders, and pursed up her red lips with a bewitching little gesture of indifference.




  
  


  1 On 18 March 978, King Edward the Martyr was murdered at Corfe in Dorset when visiting his half-brother Ethelred and his stepmother Elfthryth. His brother's retainers came out to meet him with signs of respect, but stabbed him before he had dismounted.

  peculiar to dark-blue eyes and long black lashes; and he could not wonder what he should have for dinner without a dreamy pensiveness in the purple shadows of those deep-blue orbs. He had found the sentimentality of his beauty almost of greater use to him than the beauty itself. It was this sentimentality which always put him at an advantage with his employers. He looked like an exiled prince doing menial service in bitterness of spirit and a turned-down collar. He looked like Lara1 returned to his own domains to train the horses of a usurper. He looked, in short, like anything but what he was, - a selfish, good-fornothing, lazy scoundrel, who was well up in the useful art of doing the minimum of work, and getting the maximum of wages.




  
  


  He strolled slowly back to his rustic habitation, where he found the Softy waiting for him; the kettle boiling upon a handful of bright fire, and some tea-things laid out upon the little round table. Mr. Conyers looked rather contemptuously at the humble preparations.




  
  


  I've mashed the tea for 'ee, said the Softy;I thought you'd like a coop.




  
  


  The trainer shrugged his shoulders.




  
  


  I can't say I'm particular attached to the cat-lap, he said, laughing; I've had rather too much of it when I've been in training, - half-and-half, warm tea and cold-drawn castor-oil. I'll send you into Doncaster for some spirits to-morrow, my man: or to-night, perhaps, he added reflectively, resting his elbow upon the table and his chin in the hollow of his hand.




  
  


  He sat for some time in this thoughtful attitude, his retainer Steeve Hargraves watching him intently all the while, with that half-wondering, half-admiring stare with which a very ugly creature - a creature so ugly as to know it is ugly - looks at a very handsome one.




  
  


  At the close of his reverie, Mr. Conyers took out a clumsy silver watch, and sat for a few minutes staring vacantly at the dial.




  
  


  Close upon six, he muttered at last. What time do they dine at the house, Steeve?

  Seven o'clock, answered the Softy.




  
  


  Seven o'clock. Then you'd have time to run there with a message, or a letter, and catch 'em just as they're going in to dinner.




  
  


  The Softy stared aghast at his new master.




  
  


  A message or a letter, he repeated; for Mr. Mellish?




  
  


  No; for Mrs. Mellish.




  
  


  But I daren't, exclaimed Stephen Hargraves; I daren't go nigh the house; least of all to speak to her. I don't forget the day she horse-whipped me. I've never seen her since, and I don't want to see her. You think I am a coward, don't 'ee? he said, stopping suddenly, and looking at the trainer, whose handsome lips were curved into a contemptuous smile. You think I'm a coward, don't 'ee, now? he repeated.




  
  


  Well, I don't think you are over-valiant, answered Mr. Conyers, to be afraid of a woman, though she was the veriest devil that ever played fast and loose with a man.




  
  


  Shall I tell you what it is I am afraid of? said Steeve Hargraves, hissing the words through his closed teeth in that unpleasant whisper peculiar to him. It isn't Mrs. Mellish. It's myself. It's this, - he grasped something in the loose pocket of his trousers as he spoke, - it's this. I'm afraid to trust myself a-nigh her, for fear I should spring upon her, and cut her thro-at from ear to ear. I've seen her in my dreams sometimes, with her beautiful white thro-at laid open, and streaming oceans of blood; but, for all that, she's always had the broken whip in her hand, and she's always laughed at me. I've had many a dream about her; but I've never seen her dead or quiet; and I've never seen her without the whip.




  
  


  The contemptuous smile died away from the trainer's lips as Steeve Hargraves made this revelation of his sentiments, and gave place to a darkly thoughtful expression, which overshadowed the whole of his face.




  
  


  I've no such wonderful love for Mrs. Mellish myself, he said; but she might live to be as old as Methuselah, for aught I care, if she'd- He muttered something between his teeth, and walked up the little staircase to his bedroom, whistling a popular tune as he went.




  
  


  He came down again with a dirty-looking leather desk in his hand; which he flung carelessly on to the table. It was stuffed with"|"Aurora Floyd"|"Mary Elizabeth Braddon"

  Mrs. Powell paused, almost terrified by her unlooked-for discovery.




  
  


  What, in the name of all that was darkly mysterious, could Mrs. Mellish have to do between nine and ten o'clock on the north side of the Park - the wildly kept, deserted north side, in which, from year's end to year's end, no one but the keepers ever walked?




  
  


  The blood rushed hotly up to Mrs. Powell's pale face, as she suddenly remembered that the disused, dilapidated lodge upon this north side had been given to the new trainer as a residence. Remembering this was nothing, but remembering this in connection with that mysterious letter signed A. was enough to send a thrill of savage, horrible joy through the dull veins of the dependent. What should she do? Follow Mrs. Mellish, and discover where she was going? How far would this be a safe thing to attempt?




  
  


  She turned back and looked once more through the window of John's room. He was still bending over the papers, still in as apparently hopeless confusion of mind. There seemed little chance of his business being finished very quickly. The starless night and her dark dress alike sheltered the spy from observation.




  
  


  If I were close behind her, she would never see me, she thought.




  
  


  She struck across the lawn to the iron gate and passed into the Park. The brambles and the tangled undergrowth caught at her dress as she paused for a moment looking about her in the summer night.




  
  


  There was no trace of Aurora's white figure among the leafy alleys stretching in wild disorder before her.




  
  


  I'll not attempt to find the path she took, thought Mrs. Powell; I know where to find her.




  
  


  She groped her way into the narrow footpath leading to the lodge. She was not sufficiently familiar with the place to take the short cut which the Softy had made for himself through the grass that afternoon, and she was some time walking from the iron gate to the lodge.

  had left ajar an hour before, and sat down panting upon a little bench within, to recover her breath before she went any further. She was still sitting on this bench, when the fourth peal of thunder shook the low roof above her head, and the rain dropped from the starless sky with such a rushing impetus, that it seemed as if a huge trap-door had been opened in the heavens, and a celestial ocean let down to flood the earth.




  
  


  I think my lady will be nicely caught, muttered Mrs. Walter Powell.




  
  


  She threw her cloak aside upon the lobby bench, and went through a passage leading to the hall. One of the servants was shutting the hall-door.




  
  


  Have you shut the drawing-room windows, Wilson? she asked.




  
  


  No, ma'am; I am afraid Mrs. Mellish is out in the rain. Jarvis is getting ready to go and look for her, with a lantern and the gig-umbrella.




  
  


  Then Jarvis can stop where he is; Mrs. Mellish came in half an hour ago. You may shut all the windows, and close the house for the night.




  
  


  Yes, ma'am.




  
  


  By-the-by, what o'clock is it, Wilson? My watch is slow.




  
  


  A quarter past ten, ma'am, by the dining-room clock.




  
  


  The man locked the hall-door, put up an immense iron bar, which worked with some rather complicated machinery, and had a bell hanging at one end of it, for the frustration of all burglarious and designing ruffians.




  
  


  From the hall the man went to the drawing-room, where he carefully fastened the long range of windows; from the drawing-room to the lobby; and from the lobby to the dining-room, where he locked the half-glass door opening into the garden. This being done, all communication between the house and the garden was securely shut off.




  
  


  He shall know of her goings-on, at any rate, thought Mrs. Powell, as she dogged the footsteps of the servant to see that he did his work. The Mellish household did not take very kindly to this deputy mistress; and when the footman went back to the servants' hall, he informed his colleagues that SHE was pryin' and pokin' about sharper than hever, and watchin' of a feller like a old 'ouse-cat. Mr. Wilson was"|"Aurora Floyd"|"Mary Elizabeth Braddon"

  a cockney, and had been newly-imported into the establishment.




  
  


  When the ensign's widow had seen the last bolt driven home to its socket, and the last key turned in its lock, she went back to the drawing-room and seated herself at the lamp-lit table, with some delicate morsel of old-maidish fancy-work, which seemed to be the converse of Penelope's embroidery, as it appeared to advance at night, and retrograde by day.1 She had hastily smoothed her hair and rearranged her dress, and she looked as uncomfortably neat as when she came down to breakfast in the fresh primness of her matutinal toilette.




  
  


  She had been sitting at her work for about ten minutes when John Mellish entered the room, emerging weary but triumphant from his struggle with the simple rules of multiplication and subtraction. Mr. Mellish had evidently suffered severely in the contest. His thick brown hair was tumbled into a rough mass that stood nearly upright upon his head, his cravat was untied, and his shirt-collar thrown open for the relief of his capacious throat; and these and many other marks of the struggle he bore upon him when he entered the drawing-room.




  
  


  I've broken loose from school at last, Mrs. Powell, he said, flinging his big frame upon one of the sofas, to the imminent peril of the German-spring cushions; I've broken away before the flag dropped, for Langley would have liked to keep me there till midnight. He followed me to the door of this room with fourteen bushels of oats that was down in the cornchandler's account and was not down in the book he keeps to check the cornchandler. Why the deuce don't he put it down in his book and make it right, then, I ask, instead of bothering me? What's the good of his keeping an account to check the cornchandler if he don't make his account the same as the cornchandler's? But it's all over! he added, with a great sigh of relief, it's all over! and all I can say is, I hope the new trainer isn't honest.




  
  


  Do you know much of the new trainer, Mr. Mellish? asked Mrs. Powell, blandly; rather as if she wished to amuse her employer by the exertion of her conversational powers than for the gratification of any mundane curiosity.

  How quiet are the tragedies of real life! That dreadful scene between the Moor and his Ancient1 takes place in the open street of Cyprus, according to modern usage. I can scarcely fancy Othello and lago debating about poor Desdemona's honesty in St. Paul's Churchyard, or even in the marketplace of a country town; but perhaps the Cyprus street was a dull one, a cul-de-sac, it may be, or at least a deserted thoroughfare, something like that in which Monsieur Melnotte falls upon the shoulder of General Damas and sobs out his lamentations.2 But our modern tragedies seem to occur indoors, and in places where we should least look for scenes of horror. Who can forget that tempestuous scene of jealous fury and mad violence which took place in a second floor in Northumberland Street, while the broad daylight was streaming in through the dusty windows, and the common London cries ascending from the pavement below?3

They went upstairs and found, in a dusty solicitor's office, a hideous spectacle. Another severely wounded man (Mr. Roberts) was crouched on the floor, surrounded by evidence of a terrible fight: pools of blood, broken wine bottles, pistols, and overturned furniture. Roberts died of his wounds; Murray survived, and related his side of the story. He had been lured into the rooms on false pretences; Roberts had tried to kill him; and he had fought for his life. He had no idea why he had been attacked, but police established that Roberts had become obsessed with Murray's mistress, and had planned to kill him out of jealousy."|"Aurora Floyd"|"Mary Elizabeth Braddon"

  lodge, and to shuffle his poor lame leg wearily from one position to another in sheer discontent of mind, which, by one of those many subtle links between spirit and matter that tell us we are mortal, communicated itself to his body, and gave him that chronic disorder which is popularly called the fidgets. An unquiet fever, generated amidst the fibres of the brain, and finding its way by that physiological telegraph, the spinal marrow, to the remotest stations on the human railway.




  
  


  Mr. James suffered from this common complaint to such a degree, that as the solemn strokes of the church-clock vibrated in sonorous music above the tree-tops of Mellish Park in the sunny evening atmosphere, he threw down his pipe with an impatient shrug of the shoulders, and called to the Softy to bring him his hat and walkingstick.




  
  


  Seven o'clock,he muttered, only seven o'clock. I think there must have been twenty-four hours in this blessed summer's day.




  
  


  He stood looking from the little casement-window with a discontented frown contracting his handsome eyebrows, and a peevish expression distorting his full, classically-moulded lips, as he said this. He glanced through the little casement, made smaller by its clustering frame of roses and clematis, jessamine and myrtle, and looking like the port-hole of a ship that sailed upon a sea of summer verdure. He glanced through the circular opening left by that scented framework of leaves and blossoms, into the long glades, where the low sunlight was flickering upon waving fringes of fern. He followed with his listless glance the wandering intricacies of the underwood, until they led his weary eyes away to distant patches of blue water, slowly changing to opal and rose-colour in the declining light. He saw all these things with a lazy apathy, which had no power to recognize their beauty, or to inspire one latent thrill of gratitude to Him who had made them. He had better have been blind; surely he had better have been blind.




  
  


  He turned his back upon the evening sunshine, and looked at the white face of Steeve Hargraves, the Softy, with every whit as much pleasure as he had felt in looking at nature in her loveliest aspect.




  
  


  A long day, he said, - an infernally tedious, wearisome day. Thank God, it's over.

  quarrelling with our fate, to find at last, on wandering backwards to the source of our ill-luck, that the primary cause of all has been our own evil-doing. It was this that made Mr. Conyers stop abruptly in his reflections upon his misfortunes, and break off with a smothered oath, and listen impatiently for the wheels of the Newport Pagnell.




  
  


  The Softy appeared presently, leading the horse by the bridle. He had not presumed to seat himself in the sacred vehicle, and he stared wonderingly at James Conyers as the trainer tumbled about the chocolate-cloth cushions, arranging them afresh for his own ease and comfort. Neither the bright varnish of the dark-brown panels, nor the crimson crest, nor the glittering steel ornaments on the neat harness, nor any of the exquisitely-finished appointments of the light vehicle, provoked one word of criticism from Mr. Conyers. He mounted as easily as his lame leg would allow him, and taking the reins from the Softy, lighted his cigar preparatory to starting.




  
  


  You needn't sit up for me to-night, he said, as he drove into the dusty high road: I shall be late.




  
  


  Mr. Hargraves shut the iron gates with a loud clanking noise upon his new master.




  
  


  But I shall, though, he muttered, looking askant through the bars at the fast disappearing Newport Pagnell, which was now little more than a black spot in a white cloud of dust; but I shall sit up, though. You'll come home drunk, I lay. (Yorkshire is so pre-eminently a horse-racing and betting county, that even simple country folk who have never wagered a sixpence in the quiet course of their lives say I lay where a Londoner would say I dare say.) You'll come home drunk, I lay; folks generally do from Doncaster; and I shall hear some more of your wild talk. Yes, yes, he said in a slow, reflective tone; it's very wild talk, and I can't make top nor tail of it yet - not yet; but it seems to me somehow as if I knew what it all meant, only I can't put it together - I can't put it together. There's something missin', and the want of that something hinders me putting it together.




  
  


  He rubbed his stubble of coarse red hair with his two strong, awkward hands, as if he would fain have rubbed some wanting intelligence into his head.




  
  


  Two thousand pound! he said, walking slowly back to the cottage. Two thousand pound! It's a power of money! Why it's two"|"Aurora Floyd"|"Mary Elizabeth Braddon"
"ap > 10:00"|"A little after ten o'clock"|"Page 314
  
  


  thousand pound that the winner gets by the great race at Newmarket, and there's all the gentlefolks ready to give their ears for it. There's great lords fighting and struggling against each other for it; so it's no wonder a poor fond chap like me thinks summat about it.




  
  


  He sat down upon the step of the lodge-door to smoke the cigarends which his benefactor had thrown him in the course of the day; but he still ruminated upon this subject, and he still stopped sometimes, between the extinction of one cheroot-stump and the illuminating of another, to mutter, Two thousand pound! Twenty hundred pound! Forty times fifty pound! with an unctuous chuckle after the enunciation of each figure, as if it was some privilege even to be able to talk of such vast sums of money. So might some doating lover, in the absence of his idol, murmur the beloved name to the summer breeze.




  
  


  The last crimson lights upon the patches of blue water died out beneath the gathering darkness; but the Softy sat, still smoking, and still ruminating, till the stars were high in the purple vault above his head. A little after ten o'clock he heard the rattling of wheels and the tramp of horses' hoofs upon the high road, and going to the gate he looked out through the iron bars. As the vehicle dashed by the north gates he saw that it was one of the Mellish-Park carriages which had been sent to the station to meet John and his wife.




  
  


  A short visit to Loon'on, he muttered.I lay she's been to fetch t' brass.




  
  


  The greedy eyes of the half-witted groom peered through the iron bars at the passing carriage, as if he would have fain looked through its opaque panels in search of that which he had denominated the brass. He had a vague idea that two thousand pounds would be a great bulk of money, and that Aurora would carry it in a chest or a bundle that might be perceptible through the carriage-window.




  
  


  I'll lay she's been to fetch t' brass, he repeated, as he crept back to the lodge-door.




  
  


  He resumed his seat upon the door-step, his cigar-ends, and his reverie, rubbing his head very often, sometimes with one hand, sometimes with both, but always as if he were trying to rub some wanting sense or power of perception into his wretched brains. Sometimes he gave a short restless sigh, as if he had been trying all this time to guess"|"Aurora Floyd"|"Mary Elizabeth Braddon"
">> 00:00"|"long after midnight"|"Page 315
  
  


  some difficult enigma, and was on the point of giving it up.




  
  


  It was long after midnight when Mr. James Conyers returned, very much the worse for brandy-and-water and dust. He tumbled over the Softy, still sitting on the step of the open door, and then cursed Mr. Hargraves for being in the way.




  
  


  B't s'nc' y' h'v' ch's'n t' s't 'p, said the trainer, speaking a language entirely composed of consonants, y' m'y dr'v' tr'p b'ck t' st'bl's.




  
  


  By which rather obscure speech he gave the Softy to understand that he was to take the dog-cart back to Mr. Mellish's stable-yard.




  
  


  Steeve Hargraves did his drunken master's bidding, and leading the horse homewards through the quiet night, found a cross boy with a lantern in his hand waiting at the gate of the stable-yard, and by no means disposed for conversation, except, indeed, to the extent of the one remark that he, the cross boy, hoped the new trainer wasn't going to be up to this game every night, and hoped the mare, which had been bred for a racer, hadn't been ill used.




  
  


  All John Mellish's horses seemed to have been bred for racers, and to have dropped gradually from prospective winners of the Derby, Oaks, Chester Cup, Great Ebor,Yorkshire Stakes, Leger, and Doncaster Cup, - to say nothing of minor victories in the way of Northumberland Plates, Liverpool Autumn Cups, and Curragh Handicaps, through every variety of failure and defeat, - into the every-day ignominy of harness. Even the van which carried groceries was drawn by a slim-legged, narrow-chested, high-shouldered animal called the Yorkshire Childers, and bought, in its sunny colt-hood, at a great price by poor John.




  
  


  Mr. Conyers was snoring aloud in his little bedroom when Steeve Hargraves returned to the lodge. The Softy stared wonderingly at the handsome face brutalized by drink, and the classical head flung back upon the crumpled pillow in one of those wretched positions which intoxication always chooses for its repose. Steeve Hargraves rubbed his head harder even than before, as he looked at the perfect profile, the red, half-parted lips, the dark fringe of lashes on the faintly crimson-tinted cheeks.




  
  


  Perhaps I might have been good for summat if I had been like you, he said, with a half-savage melancholy. I shouldn't have been ashamed of myself then. I shouldn't have crept into dark corners to"|"Aurora Floyd"|"Mary Elizabeth Braddon"
"ap > 10:00"|"a little after ten o'clock"|"Page 319
  
  


  these two oases in the year's dreary circle, the spring and autumn meetings, there is none. But of abnormal and special entertainment there may be much; only known to such men as Mr. James Conyers, to whom the most sinuous alley is a pleasant road, so long as it leads, directly or indirectly, to the betting-man's god - Money.




  
  


  However this might be, Mr. Conyers bore upon him all the symptoms of having, as the popular phrase has it, made a night of it. His eyes were dim and glassy; his tongue hot and furred, and uncomfortably large for his parched mouth; his hand so shaky that the operation which he performed with a razor before his looking-glass was a toss-up between suicide and shaving. His heavy head seemed to have been transformed into a leaden box full of buzzing noises; and after getting half through his toilet he gave it up for a bad job, and threw himself upon the bed he had just left, a victim to that biliary derangement which inevitably follows an injudicious admixture of alcoholic and malt liquors.




  
  


  A tumbler of Hochheimer, he muttered, or even the third-rate Chablis they give one at a table-d'hôte, would freshen me up a little; but there's nothing to be had in this abominable place except brandy-and-water.




  
  


  He called to the Softy, and ordered him to mix a tumbler of the last-named beverage, cold and weak.




  
  


  Mr. Conyers drained the cool and lucid draught, and flung himself back upon the pillow with a sigh of relief. He knew that he would be thirsty again in five or ten minutes, and that the respite was a brief one; but still it was a respite.




  
  


  Have they come home? he asked.




  
  


  Who?




  
  


  Mr. and Mrs. Mellish, you idiot! answered the trainer fiercely.




  
  


  Who else should I bother my head about? Did they come home last night while I was away?




  
  


  The Softy told his master that he had seen one of the carriages drive past the north gates at a little after ten o'clock on the preceding night, and that he supposed it contained Mr. and Mrs. Mellish.




  
  


  Then you'd better go up to the house and make sure, said Mr. Conyers; I want to know."|"Aurora Floyd"|"Mary Elizabeth Braddon"

  surely, such a sum of money must be a huge pile of gold and silver, - a mountain of glittering coin. He had seen cheques sometimes, and bank-notes, in the hands of Langley the trainer, and he had wondered how it was that money could be represented by those pitiful bits of paper.




  
  


  I'd rayther hav't i' goold, he thought: if 'twas mine, I'd have it all i' goold and silver.




  
  


  He was very glad when he found himself safely clear of the whips and Mrs. John Mellish, and as soon as he reached the shelter of the thick foliage upon the northern side of the Park, he set to work to examine the packet which had been intrusted to him.




  
  


  Mrs. Mellish had liberally moistened the adhesive flap of the envelope, as people are apt to do when they are in a hurry; the consequence of which carelessness was that the gum was still so wet that Stephen Hargraves found no difficulty in opening the envelope without tearing it. He looked cautiously about him, convinced himself that he was unobserved, and then drew out the slip of paper. It contained very little to reward him for his trouble, only these few words, scrawled in Aurora's most careless hand: -




  
  


  Be on the southern side of the wood, near the turnstile, between half-past eight and nine.




  
  


  The Softy grinned as he slowly made himself master of this communication.

  He refastened the envelope, pressing it down with his dirty thumb to make it adhere once more, and not much improving its appearance thereby.




  
  


  He's one of your rare careless chaps, he muttered as he surveyed the letter; he won't stop t' examine if it's been opened before. What's insoide were hardly worth th' trouble of openin' it; but perhaps it's as well to know it too.

  of the pistol-cases, and replacing them upon their accustomed shelves.




  
  


  Oh, if you wish to be alone, certainly, said the ensign's widow, looking furtively at Aurora's face bending over the breech-loading revolvers, and then walking genteelly and noiselessly out of the room.




  
  


  Who was she talking to? thought Mrs. Powell. I could hear her voice, but not the other persons. I suppose it was Mr. Mellish; and yet he is not generally so quiet.




  
  


  She stopped to look out of a window in the corridor, and found the solution of her doubts in the shambling figure of the Softy, making his way northwards, creeping stealthily under shadow of the plantation that bordered the lawn. Mrs. Powell's faculties were all cultivated to a state of unpleasant perfection, and she was able, actually as well as figuratively, to see a great deal farther than most people.




  
  


  John Mellish was not to be found in the house, and on making inquiries of some of the servants, Mrs. Powell learnt that he had strolled up to the north lodge to see the trainer, who was confined to his bed.




  
  


  Indeed! said the ensign's widow; then I think, as we really ought to know about the colonel and the mulligatawny, I will walk to the north lodge myself, and see Mr. Mellish.




  
  


  She took a sun-umbrella from the stand in the hall, and crossed the lawn northwards at a smart pace, in spite of the heat of the July noontide. If I can get there before Hargraves, she thought, I may be able to find out why he came to the house.




  
  


  The ensign's widow did reach the lodge before Stephen Hargraves, who stopped, as we know, under shelter of the foliage in the loneliest pathway of the wood, to decipher Aurora's scrawl. She found John Mellish seated with the trainer, in the little parlour of the lodge, discussing the stable arrangement; the master talking with considerable animation, the servant listening with a listless nonchalance which had a certain air of depreciation, not to say contempt, for poor John's racing stud. Mr. Conyers had risen from his bed at the sound of his employer's voice in the little room below, and had put on a dusty shooting-coat and a pair of shabby slippers, in order to come down and hear what Mr. Mellish had to say.




  
  


  I'm sorry to hear you're ill, Conyers, John said heartily, with a freshness in his strong voice which seemed to carry health and"|"Aurora Floyd"|"Mary Elizabeth Braddon"

  coming in a hero. But then he is not a hero. He is stout and strongly built, with a fine broad chest, and unromantically robust health. There is more chance of his dying of apoplexy than of fading gracefully in a decline, or breaking a blood-vessel in a moment of intense emotion. He sleeps calmly, with the warm July air floating in upon him from the open window, and comforting him with its balmy breath, and he fully enjoys that rest of body and mind. Yet even in his tranquil slumber there is a vague something, some lingering shadow of the bitter memories which sleep has put away from him, that fills his breast with a dull pain, an oppressive heaviness, which cannot be shaken off. He slept until half a dozen different clocks in the rambling old house had come to one conclusion, and declared it to be five in the afternoon; and he awoke with a start to find his wife watching him, Heaven knows how intently, with her black eyes filled with solemn thought, and a strange earnestness in her face.




  
  


  My poor John! she said, bending her beautiful head and resting her burning forehead upon his hand; how tired you must have been, to sleep so soundly in the middle of the day! I have been awake for nearly an hour, watching you




  
  


  Watching me, Lolly! why?




  
  


  And thinking how good you are to me. Oh, John, John! what can I ever do what can I ever do to atone to you for all




  
  


  Be happy, Aurora, he said huskily, be happy, and and send that man away.




  
  


  I will, John; he shall go soon, dear,to-night!




  
  


  What! then that letter was to dismiss him? asked Mr. Mellish.




  
  


  You know that I wrote to him?




  
  


  Yes, darling, it was to dismiss him, say that it was so, Aurora. Pay him what money you like to keep the secret that he discovered, but send him away, Lolly, send him away. The sight of him is hateful to me. Dismiss him, Aurora, or I must do so myself.




  
  


  He rose in his passionate excitement, but Aurora laid her hand softly upon his arm.




  
  


  Leave all to me, she said quietly. Believe me that I will act for the best. For the best, at least, if you couldn't bear to lose me; and you couldn't bear that, could you, John?

  Past eight! she said; no, it's surely not so late?




  
  


  Yes, it is, Lolly, John Mellish answered, looking at his watch; a quarter past.




  
  


  Indeed! I beg your pardon, Mrs. Lofthouse; shall we go into the drawing-room?




  
  


  Yes, dear, do, said the clergyman's wife, and let's have a nice chat. Papa will drink too much claret if he tells the pig-sticking stories, she added in a confidential whisper. Ask your dear, kind husband not to let him have too much claret; because he's sure to suffer with his liver to-morrow, and say that Lofthouse ought to have restrained him. He always says that it's poor Reginald's fault for not restraining him.




  
  


  John looked anxiously after his wife, as he stood with the door in his hand, while the three ladies crossed the hall. He bit his lip as he noticed Mrs. Powell's unpleasantly-precise figure close to Aurora's shoulder.




  
  


  I think I spoke pretty plainly, though, this morning, he thought, as he closed the door and returned to his friends.




  
  


  A quarter-past eight; twenty minutes past; five-and-twenty minutes past. Mrs. Lofthouse was rather a brilliant pianist, and was never happier than when interpreting Thalberg and Benedict upon her friends' Collard-and-Collards. There were old-fashioned people round Doncaster who believed in Collard and Collard, and were thankful for the melody to be got out of a good honest grand, in a solid rosewood case, unadorned with carved glorification, or ormolu fret-work.1 At seven-and-twenty minutes past eight Mrs. Lofthouse was seated at Aurora's piano, in the first agonies of a prelude in six flats; a prelude which demanded such extraordinary uses of the left hand across the right, and the right over the left, and such exercise of

  the thumbs in all sorts of positions, in which, according to all orthodox theories of the pre-Thalberg-ite school,1 no pianist's thumbs should ever be used, that Mrs. Mellish felt that her friend's attention was not very likely to wander from the keys.




  
  


  Within the long, low-roofed drawing-room at Mellish Park there was a snug little apartment, hung with innocent rosebud-sprinkled chintzes, and furnished with maple-wood chairs and tables. Mrs. Lofthouse had not been seated at the piano more than five minutes when Aurora strolled from the drawing-room to this inner chamber, leaving her guest with no audience but Mrs. Powell. She lingered for a moment on the threshold to look back at the ensign's widow, who sat near the piano in an attitude of rapt attention.




  
  


  She is watching me, thought Aurora, though her pink eyelids are drooping over her eyes, and she seems to be looking at the border of her pocket-handkerchief. She sees me with her chin or her nose, perhaps. How do I know? She is all eyes! Bah! am I going to be afraid of her, when I was never afraid of him? What should I fear except (her head changed from its defiant attitude to a drooping posture, and a sad smile curved her crimson lips) except to make you unhappy, my dear, my husband. Yes, with a sudden lifting of her head, and reassumption of its proud defiance, my own true husband! the husband who has kept his marriage-vow as unpolluted as when first it issued from his lips!




  
  


  I am writing what she thought, remember, not what she said; for she was not in the habit of thinking aloud, nor did I ever know anybody who was.




  
  


  Aurora took up a shawl that she had flung upon the sofa, and threw it lightly over her head, veiling herself with a cloud of black lace, through which the restless, shivering diamonds shone out like stars in a midnight sky. She looked like Hecate,2 as she stood on the threshold of the French window lingering for a moment with a deep-

  laid purpose in her heart, and a resolute light in her eyes. The clock in the steeple of the village-church struck the three-quarters after eight while she lingered for those few moments. As the last chime died away in the summer air, she looked up darkly at the evening sky, and walked with a rapid footstep out upon the lawn towards the southern end of the wood that bordered the Park."|"Aurora Floyd"|"Mary Elizabeth Braddon"

  At this juncture, Captain Prodder, who, in his extreme desire to strangle his niece's companion, had advanced very close upon the two speakers, knocked off his hat against the lower branches of the tree which sheltered him.




  
  


  There was no mistake this time about the rustling of the leaves. The trainer started, and limped towards Captain Prodder's hidingplace.




  
  


  There's some one listening to us, he said. I'm sure of it this time; that fellow Hargraves, perhaps. I fancy he's a sneak.




  
  


  Mr. Conyers supported himself against the very tree behind which the sailor stood, and beat amongst the undergrowth with his stick, but did not succeed in encountering the legs of the listener.




  
  


  If that soft-headed fool is playing the spy upon me, cried the trainer, savagely, he'd better not let me catch him, for I'll make him remember it, if I do.




  
  


  Don't I tell you that my dog followed me here? exclaimed Aurora contemptuously.




  
  


  A low rustling of the grass on the other side of the avenue, and at some distance from the seaman's place of concealment, was heard as Mrs. Mellish spoke.




  
  


  That's your dog, if you like, said the trainer; the other was a man. Come on a little way further, and let's make a finish of this business; it's past ten o'clock.




  
  


  Mr. Conyers was right. The church clock had struck ten five minutes before, but the solemn chimes had fallen unheeded upon Aurora's ear, lost amid the angry voices raging in her breast. She started as she looked around her at the summer darkness in the woods, and the flaming yellow moon, which brooded low upon the earth, and shed no light upon the mysterious pathways and the water-pools in the wood.




  
  


  The trainer limped away, Aurora walking by his side, yet holding herself as far aloof from him as the grassy pathway would allow.

  The colonel dropped heavily into a luxurious easy-chair, and quietly abandoned himself to repose. Mr. Lofthouse awoke his wife, and consulted her about the propriety of ordering the carriage. John Mellish looked eagerly round the room. To him it was empty. The rector and his wife, the Indian officer, and the ensign's widow, were only so many phosphorescent spectralities, phantasm captains;1 in short, they were not Aurora.




  
  


  Where's Lolly? he asked, looking from Mrs. Lofthouse to Mrs. Powell; where's my wife?




  
  


  I really do not know, answered Mrs. Powell, with icy deliberation. I've not been watching Mrs. Mellish.




  
  


  The poisoned darts glanced away from John's preoccupied breast. There was no room in his wounded heart for such a petty sting as this.




  
  


  Where's my wife? he cried passionately; you must know where she is. She's not here. Is she up-stairs? Is she out of doors?




  
  


  To the best of my belief, replied the ensign's widow, with more than usual precision, Mrs. Mellish is in some part of the grounds; she has been out of doors ever since we left the dining-room.




  
  


  The French clock upon the mantelpiece chimed the three-quarters after ten as she finished speaking: as if to give emphasis to her words and to remind Mr. Mellish how long his wife had been absent. He bit his lip fiercely, and strode towards one of the windows. He was going to look for his wife; but he stopped as he flung aside the window-curtain, arrested by Mrs. Powell's uplifted hand.




  
  


  Hark! she said, there is something the matter, I fear. Did you hear that violent ringing at the hall-door?




  
  


  Mr. Mellish let fall the curtain, and re-entered the room.




  
  


  It's Aurora, no doubt, he said; they've shut her out again, I suppose. I beg, Mrs. Powell, that you will prevent this in future. Really,

  The lodge-door was on the latch. The constable opened it softly, and went in. A rushlight was burning upon the table, the candlestick placed in a basin of water. A bottle half filled with brandy, and a tumbler, stood near the light; but the room was empty. The constable took his shoes off, and crept up the little staircase. The upper floor of the lodge consisted of two rooms, one, sufficiently large and comfortable, looking towards the stable-gates; the other, smaller and darker, looked out upon a patch of kitchen-garden and on the fence which separated Mr. Mellish's estate from the high road. The larger chamber was empty; but the door of the smaller was ajar; and the constable, pausing to listen at that half-open door, heard the regular breathing of a heavy sleeper.




  
  


  He knocked sharply upon the panel.




  
  


  Who's there? asked the person within, starting up from a truckle bedstead. Is't thou, Muster Conyers?




  
  


  No, answered the constable. It's me, William Dork, of Little Meslingham. Come down-stairs; I want to speak to you.




  
  


  Is there aught wrong?




  
  


  Yes.




  
  


  Poachers?




  
  


  That's as may be, answered Mr. Dork. Come down-stairs, will you?




  
  


  Mr. Hargraves muttered something to the effect that he would make his appearance as soon as he could find sundry portions of his rather fragmentary toilet. The constable looked into the room, and watched the Softy groping for his garments in the moonlight. Three minutes afterwards Stephen Hargraves slowly shambled down the angular wooden stairs, which wound in a corkscrew fashion, affected by the builders of small dwellings, from the upper to the lower floor.




  
  


  Now, said Mr. Dork, planting the Softy opposite to him, with the feeble rays of the rushlight upon his sickly face, now then, I want you to answer me a question. At what time did your master leave the house?




  
  


  At half-past seven o'clock, answered the Softy, in his whispering voice; she was stroikin the half-hour as he went out.




  
  


  He pointed to a small Dutch clock in a corner of the room. His countrymen always speak of a clock as she."|"Aurora Floyd"|"Mary Elizabeth Braddon"

  remembered that he had been accompanied by Bill Jarvis, the young man from the Reindeer, and that he had ordered the young man to drive his trap to the north gates, and wait for him there.




  
  


  The constable ran to the gates upon receiving this information; but there was no vestige of the horse and gig, or of the young man. Samuel Prodder had evidently taken advantage of the confusion, and had driven off in the gig under cover of the general bewilderment.




  
  


  I'll tell you what I'll do, sir, said William. Dork, addressing Mr. Mellish. If you'll lend me a horse and trap, I'll drive into Doncaster, and see if this man's to be found at the Reindeer. We must have him for a witness.




  
  


  John Mellish assented to this arrangement. He left one of the grooms to keep watch in the death chamber, in company with Stephen Hargraves the Softy; and, after bidding the surgeon good night, walked slowly homewards with his friends. The church clock was striking twelve as the three gentlemen left the wood, and passed through the little iron gateway on to the lawn.




  
  


  We had better not tell the ladies more than we are obliged to tell them about this business, said John Mellish, as they approached the house, where the lights were still burning in the hall and drawingroom; we shall only agitate them by letting them know the worst.




  
  


  To be sure, to be sure, my boy, answered the colonel. My poor little Maggie always cries if she hears of anything of this kind; and Lofthouse is almost as big a baby, added the soldier, glancing rather contemptuously at his son-in-law, who had not spoken once during that slow homeward walk.




  
  


  John Mellish thought very little of the strange disappearance of Captain Prodder. The man had objected to be summoned as a witness, perhaps, and had gone. It was only natural. He did not even know his name; he only knew him as the mouthpiece of evil tidings, which had shaken him to the very soul. That this man Conyers this man of all others, this man towards whom he had conceived a deeplyrooted aversion, an unspoken horror should have perished mysteriously by an unknown hand, was an event so strange and appalling as to deprive him for a time of all power of thought, all capability of reasoning. Who had killed this man, this penniless good-for-nothing trainer? Who could have had any motive for such a deed? Who_____?"|"Aurora Floyd"|"Mary Elizabeth Braddon"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o'clock"|"Page 377
  
  


  The man was very seriously hurt, Lolly, her husband answered quietly.




  
  


  What man?




  
  


  The trainer recommended to me by John Pastern.




  
  


  She looked at him for a few moments in silence.




  
  


  Is he dead? she asked, after that brief pause.




  
  


  He is.




  
  


  Her head sank forward upon her breast, and she walked away, quietly returning to the sofa from which she had arisen.




  
  


  I am very sorry for him, she said; he was not a good man. I am sorry he was not allowed time to repent of his wickedness.




  
  


  You knew him, then? asked Mrs. Lofthouse, who had expressed unbounded consternation at the trainer's death.




  
  


  Yes; he was in my father's service some years ago.




  
  


  Mr. Lofthouse's carriage had been waiting ever since eleven o'clock, and the rector's wife was only too glad to bid her friends good-night, and to drive away from Mellish Park and its fatal associations; so, though Colonel Maddison would have preferred stopping to smoke another cheroot while he discussed the business with John Mellish, he was fain to submit to feminine authority, and take his seat by his daughter's side in the comfortable landau, which was an open or a close carriage as the convenience of its proprietor dictated. The vehicle rolled away upon the smooth carriage-drive; the servants closed the hall-doors, and lingered about, whispering to each other, in little groups in the corridors and on the staircases, waiting until their master and mistress should have retired for the night. It was difficult to think that the business of life was to go on just the same though a murder had been done upon the outskirts of the Park, and even the housekeeper, a severe matron at ordinary times, yielded to the common influence, and forgot to drive the maids to their dormitories in the gabled roof.




  
  


  All was very quiet in the drawing-room where the visitors had left their host and hostess to hug those ugly skeletons which are put away in the presence of company. John Mellish walked slowly up and down the room. Aurora sat staring vacantly at the guttering wax candles in the old-fashioned silver branches; and Mrs. Powell, with her embroidery in full working order, threaded her needles and snipped away the"|"Aurora Floyd"|"Mary Elizabeth Braddon"

  I will tell anything that is necessary to tell, she said; I care very little what.




  
  


  With her hand still upon her husband's shoulder, she rested her head on his breast, like some weary child nestling in its only safe shelter.




  
  


  Mrs. Powell rose, and gathered together her embroidery in a pretty, lady-like receptacle of fragile wicker-work. She glided to the door, selected her candlestick, and then paused on the threshold to bid Mr. and Mrs. Mellish good night.




  
  


  I am sure you must need rest after this terrible affair, she simpered; so I will take the initiative. It is nearly one o'clock. Good night.




  
  


  If she had lived in the Thane of Cawdor's family, she would have wished Macbeth and his wife a good night's rest after Duncan's murder; and would have hoped they would sleep well; she would have curtsied and simpered amidst the tolling of alarm-bells, the clashing of vengeful swords, and the blood-bedabbled visages of the drunken grooms. It must have been the Scottish queen's companion who watched with the truckling physician, and played the spy upon her mistress's remorseful wanderings, and told how it was the consciencestricken lady's habit to do thus and thus; no one but a genteel mercenary would have been so sleepless in the dead hours of the night, lying in wait for the revelation of horrible secrets, the muttered clues to deadly mysteries.




  
  


  Thank God, she's gone at last! cried John Mellish, as the door closed very softly and very slowly upon Mrs. Powell. I hate that woman, Lolly.




  
  


  Heaven knows I have never called John Mellish a hero; I have never set him up as a model of manly perfection or infallible virtue; and if he is not faultless, if he has those flaws and blemishes which seem a constituent part of our imperfect clay, I make no apology for him; but trust him to the tender mercies of those who, not being quite perfect themselves, will, I am sure, be merciful to him. He hated those who hated his wife, or did her any wrong, however small. He loved those who loved her. In the great power of his wide affection, all selfesteem was annihilated. To love her was to love him; to serve her was to do him treble service; to praise her was to make him vainer than the vainest school-girl. He freely took upon his shoulders every debt"|"Aurora Floyd"|"Mary Elizabeth Braddon"

At the Golden Lion.




  
  


  Mr. William Dork, the constable, reached Doncaster at about a quarter-past one o'clock upon the morning after the murder, and drove straight to the Reindeer. That hotel had been closed for a couple of hours, and it was only by the exercise of his authority that Mr. Dork obtained access, and a hearing from the sleepy landlord. The young man who had driven Mr. Prodder was found after considerable difficulty, and came stumbling down the servants' staircase in a semisomnolent state to answer the constable's inquiries. He had driven the seafaring gentleman, whose name he did not know, direct to the Doncaster station, in time to catch the mail-train, which started at 12.50. He had parted with the gentleman at the door of the station three minutes before the train started.




  
  


  This was all the information that Mr. Dork could obtain. If he had been a sharp London detective, he might have made his arrangements for laying hands upon the fugitive sailor at the first station at which the train stopped; but being merely a simple rural functionary, he scratched his stubbled head, and stared at the landlord of the Reindeer in utter mental bewilderment.




  
  


  He was in a devil of a hurry, this chap, he muttered rather sulkily. What did he want to coot away for?




  
  


  The young man who had acted as charioteer could not answer this question. He only knew that the seafaring gentleman had promised him half a sovereign if he caught the mail-train, and that he had earned his reward.




  
  


  Well, I suppose it aint so very particklar, said Mr. Dork, sipping a glass of rum, which he had ordered for his refreshment. You'll have to appear to-morrow, and you can tell nigh as much as t'other chap, he added, turning to the young man. You was with him when the shot were fired, and you warn't far when he found the body. You'll have to appear and give evidence whenever the inquest's held.

  Mr. William Dork, the constable, reached Doncaster at about a quarter-past one o'clock upon the morning after the murder, and drove straight to the Reindeer.

"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"Page 386
  
  


  Mr. Dork wrote the young man's name in his pocket-book, and the landlord vouched for his being forthcoming when called upon. Having done thus much, the constable left the inn, after drinking another glass of rum, and refreshing John Mellish's horse with a handful of oats and a drink of water. He drove at a brisk pace back to the Park stables, delivered the horse and gig to the lad who had waited for his coming, and returned to his comfortable dwelling in the village of Meslingham, about a mile from the Park gates.




  
  


  I scarcely know how to describe that long, quiet, miserable day which succeeded the night of the murder. Aurora Mellish lay in a dull stupor, not able to lift her head from the pillows upon which it rested, scarcely caring to raise her eyelids from the aching eyes they sheltered. She was not ill, nor did she affect to be ill. She lay upon the sofa in her dressing-room, attended by her maid, and visited at intervals by John, who roamed hither and thither about the house and grounds, talking to innumerable people, and always coming to the same conclusion, namely, that the whole affair was a horrible mystery, and that he heartily wished the inquest well over. He had visitors from twenty miles round his house,for the evil news had spread far and wide before noon, visitors who came to condole and to sympathize, and wonder, and speculate, and ask questions, until they fairly drove him mad. But he bore all very patiently. He could tell them nothing except that the business was as dark a mystery to him as it could be to them, and that he had no hope of finding any solution to the ghastly enigma. They one and all asked him the same question: Had any one a motive for killing this man?




  
  


  How could he answer them? He might have told them that if twenty persons had had a powerful motive for killing James Conyers, it was possible that a one-and-twentieth person who had no motive might have done the deed. That species of argument which builds up any hypothesis out of a series of probabilities may, after all, lead very often to false conclusions.




  
  


  Mr. Mellish did not attempt to argue the question. He was too weary and sick at heart, too anxious for the inquest to be over, and be free to carry Aurora away with him, and turn his back upon the familiar place, which had been hateful to him ever since the trainer had crossed its threshold."|"Aurora Floyd"|"Mary Elizabeth Braddon"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o'clock"|"Page 387
  
  


  Yes, my darling, he said to his wife, as he bent over her pillow, I shall take you away to the south of France directly this business is settled. You shall leave the scene of all past associations, all bygone annoyances. We will begin the world afresh.




  
  


  God grant that we may be able to do so, Aurora answered gravely.Ah, my dear, I cannot tell you that I am sorry for this man's death. If he had died nearly two years ago, when I thought he did, how much misery he would have saved me!




  
  


  Once in the course of that long summer's afternoon Mr. Mellish walked across the park to the cottage at the north gates. He could not repress a morbid desire to look upon the lifeless clay of the man whose presence had caused him such vague disquietude, such instinctive terror. He found the Softy leaning on the gate of the little garden, and one of the grooms standing at the door of the death-chamber.




  
  


  The inquest is to be held at the Golden Lion, at ten o'clock tomorrow morning, Mr. Mellish said to the men. You, Hargraves, will be wanted as a witness.




  
  


  He walked into the darkened chamber. The groom understood what he came for, and silently withdrew the white drapery that covered the trainers dead face.




  
  


  Accustomed hands had done their awful duty. The strong limbs had been straightened. The lower jaw, which had dropped in the agony of sudden death, was supported by a linen bandage; the eyelids were closed over the dark-violet eyes; and the face, which had been beautiful in life, was even yet more beautiful in the still solemnity of death. The clay which in life had lacked so much, in its lack of a beautiful soul to light it from within, found its level in death. The worthless soul was gone, and the physical perfection that remained had lost its only blemish. The harmony of proportion, the exquisitely-modelled features, the charms of detail,all were left; and the face which James Conyers carried to the grave was handsomer than that which had smiled insolent defiance upon the world in the trainer's lifetime.




  
  


  John Mellish stood for some minutes looking gravely at that marble face.




  
  


  Poor fellow! thought the generous-hearted young squire; it was a hard thing to die so young. I wish he had never come here. I wish"|"Aurora Floyd"|"Mary Elizabeth Braddon"
"> 22:00"|"past ten o'clock at night"|"Page 389
  
  


  The inquiry into the circumstances of the trainer's death occupied a very short time. Nothing was elicited by the brief examination of the witnesses which in any way led to the elucidation of the mystery. John Mellish was the last person interrogated, and he answered the questions put to him with prompt decision. There was one inquiry, however, which he was unable to answer, although it was a very simple one. Mr. Hayward, the coroner, anxious to discover so much of the history of the dead man as might lead eventually to the discovery of his murderer, asked Mr. Mellish if his trainer had been a bachelor or a married man.




  
  


  I really cannot answer that question, said John; I should imagine that he was a single man, as neither he nor Mr. Pastern told me anything to the contrary. Had he been married, he would have brought his wife with him, I should suppose. My trainer, Langley, was married when he entered my service, and his wife and children have occupied the premises over my stables for some years.




  
  


  You infer, then, that James Conyers was unmarried?




  
  


  Most decidedly.




  
  


  And it is your opinion that he had made no enemies in the neighbourhood?




  
  


  It is next to impossible that he could have done so.




  
  


  To what cause, then, do you attribute his death?




  
  


  To an unhappy accident. I can account for it in no other way. The path through the wood is used as a public thoroughfare, and the whole of the plantation is known to be infested with poachers. It was past ten o'clock at night when the shot was heard. I should imagine that it was fired by a poacher whose eyes deceived him in the shadowy light.




  
  


  The coroner shook his head. You forget, Mr. Mellish, he said, that the cause of death was not an ordinary gun-shot wound. The shot heard was the report of a pistol, and the deceased was killed by a pistol-bullet.




  
  


  John Mellish was silent. He had spoken in good faith as to his impression respecting the cause of the trainer's death. In the press and hurry, the horror and confusion of the two last days, the smaller details of the awful event had escaped his memory.




  
  


  Do you know any one amongst your servants, Mr. Mellish, asked the coroner, whom you would consider likely to commit an act of"|"Aurora Floyd"|"Mary Elizabeth Braddon"
"ap > 09:00"|"a little after nine o'clock"|"Page 403
  
  


  She had deceived John Mellish in the hope that the veil of deception might never be rent in twain, that the truth might be undiscovered to the end, and the man she loved spared from cruel shame and grief. But the fruits of that foolish seed, sown long ago in the day other disobedience,1 had grown up around her and hedged her in upon every side, and she had been powerless to cut a pathway for herself through the noxious weeds that her own hands had planted.




  
  


  She sat with her watch in her hand, and her eyes wandered every now and then from the gardens before her to the figures on the dial. John Mellish had left the house at a little after nine o'clock, and it was now nearly two. He had told her that the inquest would be over in a couple of hours, and that he would hurry home directly it was finished, to tell her the result. What would be the result of that inquest? What inquiries might be made? what evidence might, by some unhappy accident, be produced to compromise or to betray her? She sat in a dull stupor, waiting to receive her sentence. What would it be? Condemnation or release? If her secret should escape detection, if James Conyers should be allowed to carry the story of his brief married life to the grave, what relief, what release for the wretched girl, whose worst sin had been to mistake a bad man for a good one; the ignorant trustfulness of a child who is ready to accept any shabby pilgrim for an exiled nobleman or a prince in disguise!




  
  


  It was half-past two, when she was startled by the sound of a shambling footstep upon the gravelled pathway underneath the verandah. The footstep slowly shuffled on for a few paces; then paused, then shuffled on again; and at last a face that she hated made itself visible at the angle of the window, opposite to that against which she sat. It was the white face of the Softy, which was poked cautiously forward a few inches within the window-frame. The mastiff sprang up with a growl, and made as if he would have flown at that ugly leering face, which looked like one of the hideous decorations of a Gothic building; but Aurora caught the animal's collar with both her hands, and dragged him back.




  
  


  Be quiet, Bow-wow, she said; quiet, boy, quiet.

  The spies who hate and watch me shall not read this, she thought, as she wrote John's name upon the envelope.




  
  


  She left the letter upon the desk, and, rising from her seat, looked round the room, looked with a long lingering gaze, that dwelt on each familiar object. How happy she had been amongst all that masculine litter! how happy with the man she had believed to be her husband! how innocently happy before the coming down of that horrible storm-cloud which had overwhelmed them both! She turned away with a shudder.




  
  


  I have brought disgrace and misery upon all who have loved me, she thought. If I had been less cowardly, if I had told the truth, all this might have been avoided, if I had confessed the truth to Talbot Bulstrode.




  
  


  She paused at the mention of that name.




  
  


  I will go to Talbot, she thought. He is a good man. I will go to him; I shall have no shame now in telling him all. He will advise me what to do; he will break this discovery to my poor father.




  
  


  Aurora had dimly foreseen this misery when she had spoken to Lucy Bulstrode at Felden; she had dimly foreseen a day in which all would be discovered, and she would fly to Lucy to ask for a shelter.

  Aurora selected her plainest bonnet and a large gray cloak, and quietly put them on before the cheval glass in one of the pretty French windows.

  The spies who hate and watch me shall not read this, she thought, as she wrote John's name upon the envelope.




  
  


  She left the letter upon the desk, and, rising from her seat, looked round the room, looked with a long lingering gaze, that dwelt on each familiar object. How happy she had been amongst all that masculine litter! how happy with the man she had believed to be her husband! how innocently happy before the coming down of that horrible storm-cloud which had overwhelmed them both! She turned away with a shudder.




  
  


  I have brought disgrace and misery upon all who have loved me, she thought. If I had been less cowardly, if I had told the truth, all this might have been avoided, if I had confessed the truth to Talbot Bulstrode.




  
  


  She paused at the mention of that name.




  
  


  I will go to Talbot, she thought. He is a good man. I will go to him; I shall have no shame now in telling him all. He will advise me what to do; he will break this discovery to my poor father.




  
  


  Aurora had dimly foreseen this misery when she had spoken to Lucy Bulstrode at Felden; she had dimly foreseen a day in which all would be discovered, and she would fly to Lucy to ask for a shelter.




  
  


  She looked at her watch.




  
  


  A quarter past three, she said. There is an express that leaves Doncaster at five. I could walk the distance in the time.




  
  


  She unlocked the door, and ran up-stairs to her own rooms. There was no one in the dressing-room; but her maid was in the bedroom, arranging some dresses in a huge wardrobe.




  
  


  Aurora selected her plainest bonnet and a large gray cloak, and quietly put them on before the cheval glass in one of the pretty French windows. The maid, busy with her own work, did not take any particular notice of her mistress's actions; for Mrs. Mellish was accustomed to wait upon herself, and disliked any officious attention."|"Aurora Floyd"|"Mary Elizabeth Braddon"

  Chapter XXIX

John Mellish Finds his Home Desolate.




  
  


  The sun was low in the western sky, and distant village-clocks had struck seven, when John Mellish walked slowly away from that lonely waste of stunted grass called Harper's Common, and strolled homewards in the peaceful evening.




  
  


  The Yorkshire squire was still very pale. He walked with his head bent forward upon his breast, and the hand that grasped the crumpled paper thrust into the bosom of his waistcoat; but a hopeful light shone in his eyes, and the rigid lines of his mouth had relaxed into a tender smile a smile of love and forgiveness. Yes, he had prayed for her and forgiven her, and he was at peace. He had pleaded her cause a hundred times in the dull quiet of that summer's afternoon, and had excused her and forgiven her. Not lightly, Heaven is a witness; not without a sharp and cruel struggle, that had rent his heart with tortures undreamed of before.




  
  


  This revelation of the past was such bitter shame to him; such horrible degradation; such irrevocable infamy. His love, his idol, his empress, his goddessit was of her he thought. By what hellish witchcraft had she been ensnared into the degrading alliance, recorded in this miserable scrap of paper? The pride of five unsullied centuries arose, fierce and ungovernable, in the breast of the country gentleman, to resent this outrage upon the woman he loved. O God! had all his glorification of her been the vain-boasting of a fool who had not known what he talked about? He was answerable to the world for the past as well as for the present. He had made an altar for his idol, and had cried aloud to all who came near her, to kneel down and perform their worship at her shrine; and he was answerable to these people for the purity of their divinity. He could not think of her as less than the idol which his love had made her perfect, unsullied, unassailable. Disgrace, where she was concerned, knew in his mind no degrees.




  
  


  It was not his own humiliation he thought of when his face grew hot as he imagined the talk there would be in the country if this fatal indiscretion of Aurora's youth ever became generally known; it was"|"Aurora Floyd"|"Mary Elizabeth Braddon"
"ap 03:30"|"half-past three o'clock"|"Page 415
  
  


  in which she had been treated as a lady-like drudge than she had ever been at Mellish Park, where she was received as an equal and a guest. She had eaten the bitter bread upon which she had lived so long in a bitter spirit; and her whole nature had turned to gall from the influence of that disagreeable diet. A moderately-generous person can bestow a favour, and bestow it well; but to receive a boon with perfect grace requires a far nobler and more generous nature.




  
  


  John Mellish approached the open window at which the ensign's widow was seated, and looked into the room. Aurora was not there. The long saloon seemed empty and desolate. The decorations of the temple looked cold and dreary, for the deity was absent.




  
  


  No one here! exclaimed Mr. Mellish, disconsolately.




  
  


  No one here but me, murmured Mrs. Powell, with an accent of mild deprecation.




  
  


  But where is my wife, ma'am?




  
  


  He said those two small words, my wife, with such a tone of resolute defiance, that Mrs. Powell looked up at him as he spoke, and thought, He has seen the certificate.




  
  


  Where is Aurora? repeated John.




  
  


  I believe that Mrs. Mellish has gone out.




  
  


  Gone out! where?




  
  


  You forget, sir, said the ensign's widow reproachfully, you appear to forget your special request that I should abstain from all supervision of Mrs. Mellish's arrangements. Prior to that request, which I may venture to suggest was unnecessarily emphatic, I had certainly considered myself, as the humble individual chosen by Miss Floyd's aunt, and invested by her with a species of authority over the young lady's actions, in some manner responsible for




  
  


  John Mellish chafed horribly under the merciless stream of long words, which Mrs. Powell poured upon his head.




  
  


  Talk about that another time, for Heaven's sake, ma'am, he said impatiently. I only want to know where my wife is. Two words will tell me that, I suppose?




  
  


  I am sorry to say that I am unable to afford you any information upon that subject, answered Mrs. Powell; Mrs. Mellish quitted the house at half-past three o'clock, dressed for walking. I have not seen her since."|"Aurora Floyd"|"Mary Elizabeth Braddon"

There was plenty of time, therefore; a great deal too much time for the feverish impatience of Mr. Mellish, who would have chartered a special engine to convey him, had the railway officials been willing. There were four long hours during which he must wait, wearing out his heart in his anxiety to follow the woman he loved, to take her to his breast and comfort and shelter her, to tell her that true love knows neither decrease nor change. He ordered the dog-cart to be got ready for him at eleven o'clock. There was a slow train that left Doncaster at ten; but as it reached London only ten minutes before the mail, it was scarcely desirable as a conveyance. Yet after the hour had passed for its starting, Mr. Mellish reproached himself bitterly for that lost ten minutes, and was tormented by a fancy that, through the loss of those very ten minutes, he should miss the chance of an immediate meeting with Aurora.




  
  


  It was nine o'clock before he remembered the necessity of making some pretence of sitting down to dinner. He took his place at the end of the long table, and sent for Mrs. Powell, who appeared in answer to his summons, and seated herself with a well-bred affectation of not knowing that the dinner had been put off for an hour and a half.




  
  


  I'm sorry I've kept you so long, Mrs. Powell, he said, as he sent the ensign's widow a ladleful of clear soup, that was of the temperature of lemonade. The truth is, that I I find I shall be compelled to run up to town by the mail.




  
  


  Upon no unpleasant business, I hope?




  
  


  Oh, dear no, not at all. Mrs. Mellish has gone up to her father's place, and and has requested me to follow her, added John, telling a lie with considerable awkwardness, but with no very great remorse. He did not speak again during dinner. He ate anything that his servants put before him, and took a good deal of wine; but he ate and drank alike unconsciously, and when the cloth had been removed, and he was left alone with Mrs. Powell, he sat staring at the reflection of the wax-candles in the depths of the mahogany. It was only when the lady gave a little ceremonial cough, and rose with the intention of simpering out of the room, that he roused himself from his long reverie, and looked up suddenly."|"Aurora Floyd"|"Mary Elizabeth Braddon"

  poohed John's stable, and made light of the reputation of her namesake the bay filly, and declared that no horse that came out of the squire's stables was ever anything better than a plater or a screw.1




  
  


  The journey came to an end, only too quickly, it seemed to Aurora: too quickly, for every mile widened the gulf she had set between herself and the home she loved; every moment only brought the realization of her loss more fully home to her mind.




  
  


  I will abide by Talbot Bulstrode's advice, she kept saying to herself; indeed, this thought was the only reed to which she clung in her trouble. She was not a strong-minded woman. She had the generous, impulsive nature which naturally turns to others for help and comfort. Secretiveness had no part in her organization, and the one concealment of her life had been a perpetual pain and grief to her.




  
  


  It was past eight o'clock when she found herself alone amidst the bustle and confusion of the King's Cross terminus. She sent a porter for a cab, and ordered the man to drive to Halfmoon Street. It was only a few days since she had met Lucy and Talbot at Felden Woods, and she knew that Mr. Bulstrode and his wife were detained in town, waiting for the prorogation of the House.




  
  


  It was Saturday evening, and therefore a holiday for the young advocate of the Cornish miners and their rights; but Talbot spent his leisure amongst Blue-books and Parliamentary Minutes, and poor Lucy, who might have been shining, a pale star, at some crowded conversazione,2 was compelled to forego the pleasure of struggling upon the staircase of one of those wise individuals who insist upon inviting their acquaintances to pack themselves into the smallest given space consistent with the preservation of life, and trample upon each other's lace flounces and varnished boots with smiling equanimity. Perhaps, in the universal fitness of things, even these fashionable evenings have a certain solemn purpose, deeply hidden under considerable surfacefrivolity. It may be that they serve as moral gymnasia, in which the thews and sinews of social amenity are racked and tortured, with a view to their increased power of endurance. It is good for a man to

  needlework, and listening with patient attention to her husband's perusal of the proof-sheets of his last pamphlet. It was a noble specimen of the stately and ponderous style of writing, and it abounded in crushing arguments and magnificent climaxes, which utterly annihilated somebody (Lucy didn't exactly make out who), and most incontrovertibly established something, though Mrs. Bulstrode couldn't quite understand what. It was enough for her that he had written that wonderful composition, and that it was his rich baritone voice that rolled out the studied Johnsonese.1 If he had pleased to read Greek to her, she would have thought it pleasant to listen. Indeed there were pet passages of Homer which Mr. Bulstrode now and then loved to recite to his wife, and which the little hypocrite pretended to admire. No cloud had darkened the calm heaven of Lucy's married life. She loved, and was beloved. It was a part of her nature to love in a reverential attitude, and she had no wish to approach nearer to her idol. To sit at her sultan's feet and replenish his chibouque; to watch him while he slept, and wave the punkah2 above his seraphic head; to love and admire and pray for him, made up the sum of her heart's desire.




  
  


  It was close upon nine o'clock, when Mr. Bulstrode was interrupted in the very crowning sentence of his peroration by a double knock at the street-door. The houses in Halfmoon Street are small, and Talbot flung down his proof-sheet with a gesture expressive of considerable irritation. Lucy looked up, half sympathizingly, half apologetically, at her lord and master. She held herself in a manner responsible for his ease and comfort.




  
  


  Who can it be, dear? she murmured; at such a time, too!




  
  


  Some annoyance or other, I dare say, my dear, answered Talbot. But whoever it is, I won't see them to-night. I suppose, Lucy, I've given you a pretty fair idea of the effect of this upon my honourable friend the member for

  ask her any questions, Lucy; but make her as comfortable as you can, and give her the best room you can find for her. She will stay with us as long as she remains in town.




  
  


  Dear, dear Talbot, murmured the young Cornishman's grateful worshipper, how kind you are!




  
  


  Kind! cried Mr. Bulstrode; she has need of friends, Lucy; and, God knows, I will act a brother's part towards her, faithfully and bravely.Yes, bravely! he added, raising his head with an almost defiant gesture as he slowly ascended the stairs.




  
  


  What was the dark cloud which he saw brooding so fatally over the far horizon? He dared not think of what it was, he dared not even acknowledge its presence; but there was a sense of trouble and horror in his breast that told him the shadow was there.




  
  


  Lucy Bulstrode ran into the library, and flung herself upon her cousin's breast, and wept with her. She did not ask the nature of the sorrow which had brought Aurora an unexpected and uninvited guest to that modest little dwelling-house. She only knew that her cousin was in trouble, and that it was her happy privilege to offer her shelter and consolation. She would have fought a sturdy battle in defence of this privilege; but she adored her husband for the generosity which had granted it to her without a struggle. For the first time in her life, poor gentle Lucy took a new position with her cousin. It was her turn to protect Aurora; it was her turn to display a pretty motherly tenderness for the desolate creature whose aching head rested on her bosom.




  
  


  The West-End clocks were striking three, in the dead middle of the night, when Mrs. Mellish fell into a feverish slumber, even in her sleep, even in her sleep repeating again and again: My poor John! my poor dear love! what will become of him? my own faithful darling!"|"Aurora Floyd"|"Mary Elizabeth Braddon"

  Chapter XXXI

Talbot Bulstrode's Advice.




  
  


  Tablot Bulstrode went out early upon the quiet Sunday morning after Aurora's arrival, and walked down to the Telegraph Company's Office at Charing Cross, whence he despatched a message to Mr. John Mellish. It was a very brief message, only telling Mr. Mellish to come to town without delay, and that he would find Aurora in Halfmoon Street. Mr. Bulstrode walked quietly homewards in the morning sunshine, after having performed this duty. Even the London streets were brignt and dewy in that early sunlight, for it was only a little after seven o'clock, and the fresh morning breezes came sweeping over the house-tops, bringing health and purity from Shooter's Hill and Highgate, Streatham and Barnsbury, Richmond and Hampstead. The white morning mists were slowly melting from the worn grass in the Green Park; and weary creatures, who had had no better shelter than quiet sky, were creeping away to find such wretched resting-places as they might, in that free city, in which, to sit for an unreasonable time upon a doorstep, or to ask a rich citizen for the price of a loaf, is to commit an indictable offence.




  
  


  Surely it was impossible for any young legislator not quite worn out by a life-long struggle with the time which was never meant to be set right, surely it was impossible for any fresh-hearted properous young Liberal to walk through those quiet streets without thinking of these things. Talbot Bulstrode thought very earnestly and very mournfully. To what end were his labours, after all? He was fighting for a handful of Cornish miners; doing battle with the rampant spirit of circumlocution for the sake a few benighted wretches, buried in the darkness of a black abyss of ignorance a hundred times deeper and darker than the material obscurities in which they laboured. He was working his hardest and his best that these men might be taught, in some easy, unambitious manner, the simplest elements of Christian love and Christian duty. He was working for these poor far-away creatures, in their forgotten corner of the earth; and here, around and about him, was ignorance more terrible, because, hand-in-hand with"|"Aurora Floyd"|"Mary Elizabeth Braddon"
"ap 07:45"|"quarter before eight"|"Page 442
  
  


  Love me and pity me, dear, Aurora answered, gravely; but don't ask me any questions.




  
  


  The two women sat thus for sometime, Aurora's handsome head bent over Lucy's fair face, and her hands clasped in both Lucy's hands. They talked very little, and only spoke then of indifferent matters, or of Lucy's happiness and Talbot's parliamentary career. The little clock over the chimney-piece struck the quarter before eight they were very early, these unfashionable people and a minute afterwards Mrs. Bulstrode heard her husband's step upon the stairs, returning from his ante-breakfast walk. It was his habit to take a constitutional stroll in the Green Park, now and then, so Lucy had thought nothing of this early excursion.




  
  


  Talbot has let himself in with his latch-key, said Mrs. Bulstrode; and I may pour out the tea, Aurora, But listen, dear; I think there's some one with him.




  
  


  There was no need to bid Aurora listen; she had started from her low seat, and stood erect and motionless, breathing in a quick, agitated manner, and looking towards the door. Besides Talbot Bulstode's step there was another, quicker and heavier; a step she knew so well.




  
  


  The door was opened, and Talbot entered the room, followed by a visitor, who pushed aside his host with very little attention to the laws of civilized society, and, indeed, nearly drove Mr. Bulstrode backwards into a gilded basket of flowers. But this stalwart John Mellish had no intention of being unmannerly or brutal. He pushed aside his friend only as he would have pushed, or tried to push, aside a regiment of soldiers with fixed bayonets, or a Lancaster gun, or a raging ocean, or any other impediment that had come between him and Aurora. He had her in his arms before she could even cry his name aloud, in her glad surprise; and in another moment she was sobbing on his breast.




  
  


  My darling! my pet! my own! he cried, smoothing her dark hair with his broad hand, and blessing her and weeping over her, my own love! how could you do this? how could you wrong me so much? My own precious darling! had you learnt to know me no better than this, in all our happy married life?




  
  


  I came to ask Talbot's advice, John, she said, earnestly; and I mean to abide by it, however cruel it may seem.




  
  


  Mr. Bulstrode smiled gravely, as he watched these two foolish"|"Aurora Floyd"|"Mary Elizabeth Braddon"
"ap > 10:00"|"past ten"|"Page 454
  
  


  the road's clean enough, and your horse seems a good one to go. You can keep us in sight, I suppose?




  
  


  Yes, sir, and thank ye.




  
  


  All right, then.




  
  


  Talbot Bulstrode's thorough-breds dashed off, but the rakish-looking horse kept his ground behind them. He had something of the insolent, off-hand assurance of a butcher's horse, accustomed to whirl a bare-headed blue-coated master through the sharp morning air.




  
  


  I was right, Lolly, Mr. Mellish said, as he left the dog-cart behind.




  
  


  How do you mean, dear? asked Aurora.




  
  


  The man who spoke to us just now is the man who has been inquiring for me at Felden. He's a Yorkshireman.




  
  


  A Yorkshireman!




  
  


  Yes; didn't you hear the north-country twang?




  
  


  No: she had not listened to the man, nor heeded him. How should she think of anything but her new-born happinessthe new-born confidence between herself and the husband she loved?




  
  


  Do not think her hard-hearted or cruel if she forgot that it was the death of a fellow-creature, a sinful man stricken down in the prime of youth and health, that had given her this welcome release. She had suffered so much, that the release could not be otherwise than welcome, let it come how it might.




  
  


  Her nature, frank and open as the day, had been dwarfed and crippled by the secret that had blighted her life. Can it be wondered, then, that she rejoiced now that all need of secrecy was over, and this generous spirit might expand as it pleased?




  
  


  It was past ten when the phaeton turned into Halfmoon Street. The men in the dog-cart had followed John's directions to the letter; for it was only in Piccadilly that Mr. Mellish had lost sight of them amongst other vehicles travelling backwards and forwards on the lamp-lit thoroughfare.




  
  


  Talbot and Lucy received their visitors in one of the pretty little drawing-rooms. The young husband and wife had spent a quiet day together; going to church in the morning and afternoon, dining alone, and sitting in the twilight, talking happily and confidentially. Mr. Bulstrode was no Sabbath-breaker; and John Mellish had reason to consider himself a peculiarly privileged person, inasmuch as the"|"Aurora Floyd"|"Mary Elizabeth Braddon"

  The landlady brought the captain the steak he had ordered, and the tired traveller seated himself at one of the tables and discussed his simple meal. He had eaten nothing since seven o'clock that morning, and he made very short work of the three-quarters of a pound of meat that had been cooked for him. He finished his beer, drank his rum-and-water, smoked a pipe, and then, as he had the room still to himself, he made an impromptu couch ofWindsor chairs arranged in a row, and, in his own parlance, turned-in upon this rough hammock to take a brief stretch.




  
  


  He might have set his mind at rest, perhaps, before this, had he chosen. He could have questioned the landlady about the murder at Mellish Park; she was likely to know as much as any one else he might meet at the Crooked Rabbit. But he had refrained from doing this because he did not wish to draw attention to himself in any way, as a person in the smallest degree interested in the murder. How did he know what inquiries had possibly been made for the missing witness? There was perhaps some enormous reward offered for his apprehension, and a word or a look might betray him to the greedy eyes of those upon the watch to obtain it.




  
  


  Remember that this broad-shouldered seafaring man was as ignorant as a child of all things beyond the deck of his own vessel, and the watery highroads he had been wont to navigate. Life along shore was a solemn mystery to him, the law of the British dominions a complication of inscrutable enigmas, only to be spoken of and thought of in a spirit of reverence and wonder. If anybody had told him that he was likely to be seized upon as an accessory before the fact,1 and hung out of hand for his passive part in the Mellish Park catastrophe, he would have believed them implicitly. How did he know how many Acts of Parliament his conduct in leaving Doncaster without giving his evidence might come under? It might be high treason, lesemajesty,2 anything in the world that is unpronounceable and awful, for aught this simple sailor knew to the contrary. But in all this it was not his own safety that Captain Prodder thought of. That was of very little moment to this light-hearted, easy-going sailor. He had

  luncheon after your journey. He looked at his watch as he said this. It was half-past three, an hour after the usual time for luncheon at Mellish.




  
  


  I've been in the stables all the morning, he said. We're busy making our preparations for the York Summer.




  
  


  What horses do you run? Mr. Bulstrode asked, politely affecting to be interested in a subject that was utterly indifferent to him, in the hope that stable-talk might rouse John from his listless apathy




  
  


  What horses! repeated Mr. Mellish vaguely. I I hardly know. Langley manages all that for me, you know; andI forget the names of the horses he proposed, and _____




  
  


  Talbot Bulstrode turned suddenly upon his friend, and looked him full in the face. They had left the stables by this time, and were in a shady pathway that led through a shrubbery towards the house.




  
  


  John Mellish, he said, this is not fair towards an old friend.You have something on your mind, and you are trying to hide it from me.




  
  


  The squire turned away his head.




  
  


  I have something on my mind, Talbot, he said quietly. If you could help me, I'd ask your help more than any man's. But you can't you can't!




  
  


  But suppose I think I can help you? cried Mr. Bulstrode. Suppose I mean to try and do so, whether you will or no? I think I can guess what your trouble is, John; but I thought you were a braver man than to give way under it; I thought you were just the sort of man to struggle through it nobly and bravely, and to get the better of it by your own strength of will.




  
  


  What do you mean! exclaimed John Mellish. You can guess you know you thought! Have you no mercy upon me, Talbot Bulstrode? Can't you see that I'm almost mad, and that this is no time for you to force your sympathy upon me? Do you want me to betray myself? Do you want me to betray_____




  
  


  He stopped suddenly, as if the words had choked him, and, passionately stamping his foot upon the ground, walked on hurriedly, with his friend still by his side.




  
  


  The dining-room looked dreary enough when the two men entered it, although the table gave promise of a very substantial"|"Aurora Floyd"|"Mary Elizabeth Braddon"

  your purpose to beat about the bush; but I have no reason to do so, and therefore may as well come to the point at once. If you are sent here for the purpose of discovering the murderer of James Conyers, you can be more welcome to no one than to the master of that house.




  
  


  He pointed to the Gothic chimneys as he spoke.




  
  


  If those who employ you have promised you a liberal reward, Mr. Mellish will willingly treble the amount they may have offered you. He would not give you cause to complain of his liberality, should you succeed in accomplishing the purpose of your errand. If you think you will gain anything by underhand measures, and by keeping yourself dark, you are very much mistaken; for no one can be better able or more willing to give you assistance in this than Mr. and Mrs. Mellish.




  
  


  The detective for he had tacitly admitted the fact of his profession looked doubtfully at Talbot Bulstrode.




  
  


  You're a lawyer, I suppose? he said.




  
  


  I am Mr. Talbot Bulstrode, member of Penruthy, and the husband of Mrs. Mellish's first cousin.




  
  


  The detective bowed.




  
  


  My name is Joseph Grimstone, of ScotlandYard and Ball's Pond,1 he said; and I certainly see no objection to our working together. If Mr. Mellish is prepared to act on the square, I'm prepared to act with him, and to accept any reward his generosity may offer. But if he or any friend of his wants to hoodwink Joseph Grimstone, he'd better think twice about the game before he tries it on; that's all.




  
  


  Mr. Bulstrode took no notice of this threat, but looked at his watch before replying to the detective.




  
  


  It's a quarter-past six, he said. Mr. Mellish dines at seven. Can you call at the house, say at nine, this evening? You shall then have all the assistance it is in our power to give you.




  
  


  Certainly, sir. At nine this evening.




  
  


  We shall be prepared to receive you. Good afternoon.




  
  


  Mr. Grimstone touched his hat, and strolled quietly away under the shadow of the beeches, while Talbot Bulstrode walked back to rejoin his friend.

  Talbot laid his hand upon his friend's shoulder. You will frighten your wife if you go on in this manner, John, he said quietly. You mustn't take any notice of his agitation, my dear Mrs. Mellish.There is no cause, believe me, for all this outcry. Will you sit down by Lucy and compose yourself? It is eight o'clock, and between this and nine we have some serious business to settle.




  
  


  Serous business! repeated Aurora vaguely. She was intoxicated by her sudden happiness. She had no wish to ask any explanation of the mystery of the past few days. It was all over, and her faithful husband loved her as devotedly and tenderly as ever. How could she wish to know more than this?




  
  


  She seated herself at Lucy's side, in obedience to Talbot; but she still held her husband's hand, she still looked in his face, for the moment most supremely unconscious that the scheme of creation included anything beyond this stalwart Yorkshireman.




  
  


  Talbot Bulstrode lighted the lamp upon Aurora's writing-table, -a shaded lamp, which only dimly illuminated the twilight room, and then, taking his seat near it, said gravely




  
  


  My dear Mrs. Mellish, I shall be compelled to say something which I fear may inflict a terrible shock upon you. But this is no time for reservation; scarcely a time for ordinary delicacy. Will you trust in the love and friendship of those who are around you, and promise to bear this new trial bravely? I believe and hope that it will be a very brief one.




  
  


  Aurora looked wonderingly at her husband, not at Talbot.




  
  


  A new trial? she said inquiringly.




  
  


  You know that the murderer of James Conyers has not yet been discovered? said Mr. Bulstrode.




  
  


  Yes, yes; but what of that?




  
  


  My dear Mrs. Mellish, my dear Aurora! the world is apt to take a morbid delight in horrible ideas. There are some people who think that you are guilty of this crime!




  
  


  I!




  
  


  She rose suddenly from her low seat, and turned her face towards the lamplight, with a look of such blank amazement, such utter wonder and bewilderment, that had Talbot Bulstrode until that moment believed her guilty, he must thenceforth and for ever have been firmly"|"Aurora Floyd"|"Mary Elizabeth Braddon"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o'clock"|"Page 503
  
  


  convinced of her innocence.




  
  


  I! she repeated.




  
  


  Then turning to her husband, with a sudden alteration in her face, that blank amazement changing to a look of sorrow, mingled with reproachful wonder, she said in a low voice




  
  


  You thought this of me, John; you thought this!




  
  


  John Mellish bowed his head before her. I did, my dear, he murmured God forgive me for my wicked folly I did think this, Aurora. But I pitied you, and was sorry for you, my own dear love; and when I thought it most, I would have died to save you from shame or sorrow. My love has never changed, Aurora; my love has never changed.




  
  


  She gave him her hand, and once more resumed her seat. She sat for some moments in silence, as if trying to collect her thoughts, and to understand the meaning of this strange scene.




  
  


  Who suspects me of this crime? she said presently. Has any one else suspected me? Any one besides my husband?




  
  


  I can scarcely tell you, my dear Mrs. Mellish, answered Talbot; when an event of this kind takes place, it is very difficult to say who may or may not be suspected. Different persons set up different theories: one man writes to a newspaper to declare that, in his opinion, the crime was committed by some person within the house; another man writes as positively to another paper, asserting that the murderer was undoubtedly a stranger. Each man brings forward a mass of suppositions evidence in favour of his own argument, and each thinks a great deal more of proving his own cleverness than of furthering the ends of justice. No shadow of slander must rest upon this house, or upon those who live in it. It is necessary, therefore, imperatively necessary, that the real murderer should be found. A London detective is already at work. These men are very clever; some insignificant circumstance, forgotten by those most interested in discovering the truth, would often be enough to set a detective on the right track. This man is coming here at nine o'clock; and we are to give him all the assistance we can.Will you help us, Aurora?




  
  


  Help you! How?




  
  


  By telling us all you know of the night of the murder. Why were you in the wood that night?"|"Aurora Floyd"|"Mary Elizabeth Braddon"
"ap > 09:00"|"past nine"|"Page 505
  
  


  In a cheque?




  
  


  No; in notes.




  
  


  And that money has never been heard of since?




  
  


  No; John Mellish declared that he had never heard of it.




  
  


  Thank God! exclaimed Mr. Bulstrode; we shall find the murderer.




  
  


  What do you mean? asked John.




  
  


  Whoever killed James Conyers, killed him in order to rob him of the money that he had upon him at the time of his death.




  
  


  But who could have known of the money? asked Aurora.




  
  


  Anybody; the pathway through the wood is a public thoroughfare.Your conversation with the murdered man may have been overheard.You talked about the money, I suppose?




  
  


  Yes.




  
  


  Thank God, thank God! Ask your wife's pardon for the cruel wrong you have done her, John, and then come downstairs with me. It's past nine, and I dare say Mr. Grimstone is waiting for us. But stay, one word, Aurora. The pistol with which this man was killed was taken from this house, from John's room. Did you know that? No; how should I know it? Mrs. Mellish asked naïvely.




  
  


  That fact is against the theory of the murder having been committed by a stranger. Is there any one of the servants whom you could suspect of such a crime, John?




  
  


  No, answered Mr. Mellish decisively; not one.




  
  


  And yet the person who committed the murder must have been the person who stole your pistol.You,John, declare that very pistol to have been in your possession upon the morning before the murder.




  
  


  Most certainly.




  
  


  You put John's guns back into their places upon that morning, Aurora, said Mr. Bulstrode; do you remember seeing that particular pistol?




  
  


  No, Mrs. Mellish answered; I should not have known it from the others.




  
  


  You did not find any of the servants in the room that morning? Oh, no, Aurora answered immediately; Mrs. Powell came into the room while I was there. She was always following me about; and I suppose she had heard me talking to_____"|"Aurora Floyd"|"Mary Elizabeth Braddon"

  might have seemed dull to her but for these ever fresh scandals. She took a malicious delight in the discomfiture of her enemies.




  
  


  How badly they must have wanted you for a husband, Archy, she said, when they hate me so ferociously! Poor portionless old maids, to think that I should snatch their prey from them! I know they think it a hard thing that they can't have me hanged, for marrying a rich man.




  
  


  But the banker was so deeply wounded when his adored wife repeated to him the gossip which she had heard from her maid, who was a stanch adherent to a kind, easy mistress, that Eliza ever afterwards withheld these reports from him. They amused her; but they stung him to the quick. Proud and sensitive, like almost all very honest and conscientious men, he could not endure that any creature should dare to befoul the name of the woman he loved so tenderly. What was the obscurity from which he had taken her to him? Is a star less bright because it shines on a gutter as well as upon the purple bosom of the midnight sea? Is a virtuous and generous-hearted woman less worthy because you find her making a scanty living out of the only industry she can exercise; and acting Juliet to an audience of factory-hands, who give threepence apiece for the privilege of admiring and applauding her?




  
  


  Yes, the murder must out; the malicious were not altogether wrong in their conjectures: Eliza Prodder was an actress; and it was on the dirty boards of a second-rate theatre in Lancashire that the wealthy banker had first beheld her. Archibald Floyd nourished a traditional, passive, but sincere admiration for the British Drama. Yes, the British Drama; for he had lived in a day when the drama was British, and when George Barnwell and Jane Shore were amongst the favourite works of art of a play-going public. How sad that we should have degenerated since those classic days, and that the graceful story of Milwood and her apprentice-admirer is now so rarely set before us!1




  
  


  1 Victorian theatre was heavily influenced by continental forms (melodrama was French and German in origin) and by adaptations of continental, especially French, plays. Braddon recalls two popular eighteenth-century British plays: Nicholas Rowe's The Tragedy of Jane Shore (1714) and George Lillo's The London Merchant (1731), also known as The History of George Barnwell. The latter features an apprentice who is lured by his passion for a fallen woman, Millwood, to steal from his master."|"Aurora Floyd"|"Mary Elizabeth Braddon"

  couldn't have sold 'em all seven to the men from the works.




  
  


  No; I didn't, answered the pawnbroker after a pause. I remember now, I sold one of them a fancy sprig on a purple ground to Josephs the baker, in the next street; and I sold another a yellow stripe on a brown ground to the head-gardener at Mellish Park.




  
  


  Mr. Joseph Grimstone's face flushed hot and red. His day's work had not been wasted. He was bringing the buttons by Crosby of Birmingham very near to where he wanted to bring them.




  
  


  You can tell me the gardener's name I suppose? he said to the pawnbroker.




  
  


  Yes; his name's Dawson. He belongs to Doncaster, and he and I were boys together. I should not have remembered selling him the waistcoat, perhaps, for it's nigh upon a year and a half ago; only he stopped and had a chat with me and my missis the night he bought it.




  
  


  Mr. Grimstone did not linger much longer in the shop. His interest in the waistcoats was evidently departed. He bought a couple of second-hand silk handkerchiefs out of civility, no doubt, and then bade the pawnbroker good-night.




  
  


  It was nearly nine o'clock; but the detective only stopped at his inn long enough to eat about a pound and a quarter of beefsteak, and drink a pint of ale, after which brief refreshment he started for Mellish Park on foot. It was the principle of his life to avoid observation, and he preferred the fatigue of a long and lonely walk to the risks contingent upon hiring a vehicle to convey him to his destination.




  
  


  Talbot and John had been waiting hopefully all the day for the detective's coming, and welcomed him very heartily when he appeared, between ten and eleven. He was shown into John's own room this evening; for the two gentlemen were sitting there smoking and talking after Aurora and Lucy had gone to bed. Mrs. Mellish had good need of rest, and could sleep peacefully now; for the dark shadow between her and her husband had gone for ever, and she could not fear any peril, any sorrow, now that she knew herself to be secure of his love. John looked up eagerly as Mr. Grimstone followed the servant into the room; but a warning look from Talbot Bulstrode checked his impetuosity, and he waited till the door was shut before he spoke."|"Aurora Floyd"|"Mary Elizabeth Braddon"

  description of Stephen Hargraves had been observed there. The detective endeavoured to discover any friends or companions of the Softy; but here again he failed. The half-witted hanger-on of the Mellish stables had never made any friends, being entirely deficient in all social qualities.




  
  


  There was something almost miraculous in the manner in which Mr. Joseph Grimstone contrived to make himself master of any information which he wished to acquire; and before noon on the day after his interview with Mr. Dawson the gardener, he had managed to eliminate all the facts set down above, and had also succeeded in ingratiating himself into the confidence of the dirty old proprietress of that humble lodging in which the Softy had taken up his abode.




  
  


  It is scarcely necessary to this story to tell how the detective went to work; but while Stephen Hargraves sat soddening his stupid brain with medicated beer in a low tap-room not far off, and while Mr. Grimstone's ally kept close watch, holding himself in readiness to give warning of any movement on the part of the suspected individual, Mr. Grimstone himself went so cleverly to work in his manipulation of the Softy's landlady, that in less than a quarter of an hour he had taken full possession of that weak point in the intellectual citadel which is commonly called the blind side, and was able to do what he pleased with the old woman and her wretched tenement.




  
  


  His peculiar pleasure was to make a very elaborate examination of the apartment rented by the Softy, and any other apartments, cupboards, or hiding-places to which Mr. Hargraves had access. But he found nothing to reward him for his trouble. The old woman was in the habit of receiving casual lodgers, resting for a night or so at Doncaster before tramping further on their vagabond wanderings; and the six-roomed dwelling-place was only furnished with such meagre accommodation as may be expected for fourpence and sixpence a night. There were few hiding-places,no carpets, underneath which fat bundles of bank-notes might be hidden; no picture-frames, behind which the same species of property might be bestowed; no ponderous cornices or heavily-fringed valances shrouding the windows, and affording dusty recesses wherein the title-deeds of half a dozen fortunes might lie and rot. There were two or three cupboards, into which Mr. Grimstone penetrated with a tallow candle; but he"|"Aurora Floyd"|"Mary Elizabeth Braddon"

  lodge-keeper, long deceased; and there was one garment which bore upon it the ghastly impress of a dreadful deed that had but lately been done. This was the velveteen shooting-coat worn by James Conyers, the trainer, which, pierced with the murderous bullet, and stiffened by the soaking torrent of blood, had been appropriated by Mr. Stephen Hargraves in the confusion of the catastrophe. All these things, with sundry rubbish in the way of odd spurs and whip-handles, scraps of broken harness, ends of rope, and such other scrapings as only a miser loves to accumulate, were packed in a lumbering trunk covered with mangy fur, and secured by about a dozen yards of knotted and jagged rope, tied about it in such a manner as the Softy had considered sufficient to defy the most artful thief in Christendom.




  
  


  Mr. Grimstone had made very short work of all the elaborate defences in the way of knots and entanglements, and had ransacked the box from one end to the other; nay, had even closely examined the fur covering of the trunk, and had tested each separate brass-headed nail to ascertain if any of them had been removed or altered. He may have thought it just possible that two thousand pounds' worth of Bank of England paper had been nailed down under the mangy fur. He gave a weary sigh as he concluded his inspection, replaced the garments one by one in the trunk, reknotted and secured the jagged cord, and with a weary sigh turned his back upon the Softy's chamber.




  
  


  It's no good, he thought. The yellow-striped waistcoat isn't among his clothes, and the money isn't hidden away anywhere. Can he be deep enough to have destroyed that waistcoat, I wonder? He'd got a red woollen one on this morning; perhaps he's got the yellow-striped one under it.




  
  


  Mr. Grimstone brushed the dust and cobwebs off his clothes, washed his hands in a greasy wooden bowl of scalding water, which the old woman brought him, and then sat down before the fire, picking his teeth thoughtfully, and with his eyebrows set in a reflective frown over his small gray eyes.

  What can I say, then, about her performance of the impassioned Italian girl? She wore white satin and spangles, the spangles sewn upon the dirty hem of her dress, in the firm belief, common to all provincial actresses, that spangles are an antidote to dirt. She was laughing and talking in the white-washed little green-room the very minute before she ran on to the stage to wail for her murdered kinsman and her banished lover. They tell us that Macready began to be Richelieu1 at three o'clock in the afternoon, and that it was dangerous to approach or to speak to him between that hour and the close of the performance. So dangerous, indeed, that surely none but the daring and misguided gentleman who once met the great tragedian in a dark passage, and gave him Good morrow, Mac, would have had the temerity to attempt it. But Miss Percival did not take her profession very deeply to heart; the Lancashire salaries barely paid for the physical wear and tear of early rehearsals and long performances; how then, for that mental exhaustion of the true artist who lives in the character he represents?




  
  


  The easy-going comedians with whom Eliza acted made friendly remarks to each other on their private affairs in the intervals of the most vengeful discourse; speculated upon the amount of money in the house in audible undertones during the pauses of the scene; and when Hamlet wanted Horatio down at the footlights to ask him if he marked that,2 it was likely enough that the prince's confidant was up the stage telling Polonius of the shameful way in which his landlady stole the tea and sugar.




  
  


  It was not, therefore, Miss Percival's acting that fascinated the banker. Archibald Floyd knew that she was as bad an actress as ever played the leading tragedy and comedy for five-and-twenty shillings a week. He had seen Miss O'Neil in that very character,3 and it moved him to a pitying smile as the factory-hands applauded poor Eliza's

  Red Rover was saddled, and, after twenty loudly whispered injunctions from John, Talbot Bulstrode rode away in the evening sunlight. The nearest way from the stables to the high road took him past the north lodge. It had been shut up since the day of the trainer's funeral, and such furniture as it contained left to become a prey to moths and rats; for the Mellish servants were a great deal too superstitiously impressed with the story of the murder to dream of readmitting those goods and chattels which had been selected for Mr. Conyers's accommodation to the garrets whence they had been taken. The door had been locked, therefore, and the key given to Dawson the gardener, who was to be once more free to use the place as a storehouse for roots and matting, superannuated cucumberframes, and crippled garden tools.




  
  


  The place looked dreary enough, though the low sun made a gorgeous illumination upon one of the latticed windows that faced the crimson west, and though the last leaves of the roses were still lying upon the long grass in the patch of garden before the door out of which Mr. Conyers had gone to his last resting-place. One of the stable-boys had accompanied Mr. Bulstrode to the lodge in order to open the rusty iron gates, which hung loosely on their hinges, and were never locked.




  
  


  Talbot rode at a brisk pace into Doncaster, never drawing rein until he reached the little inn at which the detective had taken up his quarters. Mr. Grimstone had been snatching a hasty refreshment, after a weary and useless perambulation about the town, and came out with his mouth full, to speak to Mr. Bulstrode. But he took very good care not to confess that since three o'clock that day neither he nor his ally had seen or heard of Mr. Stephen Hargraves, or that he was actually no nearer the discovery of the murderer than he had been at eleven o'clock upon the previous night, when he had discovered the original proprietor of the fancy waistcoat, with buttons by Crosby, Birmingham, in the person of Dawson the gardener.

  as the grave, and had a certain phantom-like air in the dim moonlight.




  
  


  Talbot led his horse through the gates. He looked up at the windows of the lodge, as he passed, half involuntarily; but he stopped with a suppressed exclamation of surprise, at the sight of a feeble glimmer, which was not the moonlight, in the window of that upper chamber in which the murdered man had slept. Before that exclamation had well-nigh crossed his lips, the light had disappeared.




  
  


  If any one of the Mellish grooms or stable-boys had beheld that brief apparition, he would have incontinently taken to his heels, and rushed breathless to the stables, with a wild story of some supernatural horror in the north lodge; but Mr. Bulstrode being altogether of another mettle, walked softly on, still leading his horse, until he was well out of ear-shot of any one within the lodge, when he stopped and tied the Red Rover's bridle to a tree, and turned back towards the north gates, leaving the corn-fed covert hack cropping greedily at dewy hazel twigs, and any greenmeat within his reach.




  
  


  The heir of Sir John Walter Raleigh Bulstrode crept back to the lodge, almost as noiselessly as if he had been educated for Mr. Grimstone's profession, choosing the grassy pathway beneath the trees for his cautious footsteps. As he approached the wooden paling that shut in the little garden of the lodge, the light which had been so suddenly extinguished, reappeared behind the white curtain of the upper window.




  
  


  It's queer! mused Mr. Bulstrode, as he watched the feeble glimmer; but I dare say there's nothing in it. The associations of this place are strong enough to make one attach a foolish importance to anything connected with it. I think I heard John say the gardeners keep their tools there, and I suppose it's one of them. But it's late, too, for any of them to be at work.




  
  


  It had struck ten while Mr. Bulstrode rode homeward; and it was more than unlikely that any of the Mellish servants would be out at such a time.




  
  


  Talbot lingered by the wicket-gate, irresolute as to what he should do next, but thoroughly determined to see the last of this late visitor at the north lodge, when the shadow of a man flitted across the white curtain, a shadow even more weird and ungainly than such things are; the shadow of a man with a hump-back!"|"Aurora Floyd"|"Mary Elizabeth Braddon"

  outside York Castle ended the life of a man who had never been either help or comfort to any one of his fellow-creatures. There was an attempt made to set up a plea of irresponsibility upon the part of the Softy, and the sobriquet1 which had been given him was urged in his defence; but a set of matter-of-fact-jurymen looking at the circumstances of the murder, saw nothing in it but a most cold-blooded assassination, perpetrated by a wretch whose sole motive was gain; and the verdict which found Stephen Hargraves guilty, was tempered by no recommendation to mercy. The condemned murderer protested his innocence up to the night before his execution, and upon that night made a full confession of his crime, as is generally the custom of his kind. He related how he had followed James Conyers into the wood upon the night of his assignation with Aurora, and how he had watched and listened during the interview. He had shot the trainer in the back while Mr. Conyers sat by the water's edge looking over the notes in the pocket-book, and he had used a button off his waistcoat instead of wadding,2 not finding anything else suitable for the purpose. He had hidden the waistcoat and pocket-book in a rat-hole in the wainscot of the murdered man's chamber, and, being dismissed from the lodge suddenly, had been compelled to leave his booty behind him, rather than excite suspicion. It was thus that he had returned upon the night on which Talbot found him, meaning to secure his prize and start for Liverpool at six o'clock the following morning.




  
  


  Aurora and her husband left Mellish Park immediately after the committal of the Softy to York prison. They went to the south of France, accompanied by Archibald Floyd, and once more travelled together through scenes which were overshadowed by no sorrowful association. They lingered long at Nice, and here Talbot and Lucy joined them, with an impedimental train of luggage and servants, and a Normandy nurse with a blue-eyed girl-baby. It was at Nice that another baby was born, a black-eyed child a boy, I believe but wonderfully like that solemn-faced infant which Mrs. Alexander Floyd carried to the widowed banker two-and-twenty years before at Felden Woods.

He may have a mysterious female, immured in a solitary tower or a private lunatic asylum, destined to come forth hereafter to menace the name and position of the excellent lady whom the world acknowledges as his wife: she may have a husband lying dead at the bottom of a well,2 and a fatherless child nobody knows where. All this is no doubt very exciting; but even excitement may be purchased too dearly; and we may be permitted to doubt whether the pleasure of a nervous shock is worth the cost of so much morbid anatomy if the picture be true, or so much slanderous misrepresentation if it be false.




  
  


  Of particular offences, which are almost always contemporary and sometimes personal, undoubtedly the first place must be given to Bigamy. Indeed, so popular has this crime become, as to give rise to an entire sub-class in this branch of literature, which may be distinguished as that of Bigamy Novels. It is astonishing how many of our modern writers have selected this interesting breach of morality and law as the peg on which to hang a mystery and a denouement. Of the tales on our list, no less than eight are bigamy stories:Lady Audley's Secret, Aurora Floyd, Clinton Maynyard, Recommended to Mercy, The Law of Divorce,The Daily Governess,0nly a Woman,The

The Archbishop ofYork on Works of Fiction. The Times, 2 November 1864.




  
  


  The annual soirée of the Huddersfield Church Institute took place on Monday; the Bishop ofRipon in the chair.




  
  


  The Archbishop of YORK was one of the speakers, and he addressed himself to the following sentiment: That Church institutes exercise more or less directly an educational influence on their members, by giving them access to wellchosen books and periodicals. In order better to understand what useful reading was, he thought he might venture to look at what was useless reading; and he supposed if institutions of this kind were not to guide and supply the want that working men would be likely to fall in, no doubt, with the newspaper for one thing, and also for another with those stimulating narratives which went now by the somewhat barbarous term of sensational stories. These sensational stories were tales which aimed at this effect simplyof exciting in the mind some deep feeling of overwrought interest by the means of some terrible passion or crime. They went to persuade people that in almost every one of the wellordered houses of their neighbours there was a skeleton shut up in some cupboard; that their comfortable and easy-looking neighbour had in his breast a secret story which he was always going about trying to conceal; that there was something about a real will registered in Doctors'-commons,2 and a false will that at some proper moment would tumble out of some broken bureau, and bring about the dénoûment which the author wished to achieve. (Laughter.) This was the sort of food supplied in every kind of publication, from the penny story up to much larger and more important works. For those who

  meant to please; and it must do that or it does nothing.1




  
  


  Now, the reviewers who have lauded Miss Braddon's novels, apply to them only the test employed by Sydney Smith. They tell us that the plots will hardly bear criticism, that the tone is unhealthy, that the views of life are false and mischievous; but they recommend them to us notwithstanding, merely on the ground that each can be read from the first to the last page without our attention ever flagging, or our interest being abated. They are recommended, moreover, as good stimulants in these days of toil and worry, and as well fitted for relieving overtaxed brains by diverting our thoughts from the absorbing occupations of daily life.




  
  


  Others, again, take different ground. According to them the sensation tale is no novelty. They boldly avow that all great novels are as sensational as those of Miss Braddon. If called upon they would cite as examples some of the best works of Scott,2 and a few of the works of Bulwer Lytton and George Eliot. The Heart of Midlothian and Eugene Aram, Adam Bede and The Mill on the Floss, are unquestionably novels wherein there are incidents as highly coloured as in Lady Audley's Secret or Henry Dunbar.3 The difference, however, is far greater than the resemblance. These works are truthful taken as wholes, and even the startling occurrences are not at variance with experience and probability. According to Miss Braddon, crime is not an accident, but it is the business of life. She would lead us to conclude that the chief end of man is to commit a murder, and his highest merit to escape punishment; that women are born to attempt to commit murders, and to succeed in committing bigamy. If she teaches us anything new, it is

  of ugly babies to grow into handsome women, and so it was with Aurora Floyd. At seventeen she was twice as beautiful as her mother had been at nine-and-twenty, but with much the same irregular features, lighted up by a pair of eyes that were like the stars of heaven, and by two rows of peerlessly white teeth.You rarely, in looking at her face, could get beyond these eyes and teeth; for they so dazzled and blinded you that they defied you to criticise the doubtful little nose, or the width of the smiling mouth. What if those masses of blue-black hair were brushed away from a forehead too low for the common standard of beauty? A phrenologist1 would have told you that the head was a noble one; and a sculptor would have added that it was set upon the throat of a Cleopatra.




  
  


  Miss Floyd knew very little of her poor mother's history. There was a picture in crayons hanging in the banker's sanctum sanctorum which represented Eliza in the full flush of her beauty and prosperity; but the portrait told nothing of the history of its original, and Aurora had never heard of the merchant-captain, the poor Liverpool lodging, the grim aunt who kept a chandler's shop, the artificial flower-making, and the provincial stage. She had never been told that her maternal grandfather's name was Prodder, and that her mother had played Juliet to an audience of factory hands, for the moderate and sometimes uncertain stipend of four-and-twopence a night. The county families accepted and made much of the rich banker's heiress; but they were not slow to say that Aurora was her mother's own daughter, and had the taint of the play-acting and horse-riding, the spangles and the sawdust, strong in her nature. The truth of the matter is, that before Miss Floyd emerged from the nursery she evinced a very decided tendency to become what is called fast.2 At six years of age she rejected a doll, and asked for a rocking-horse. At ten she could converse fluently upon the subject of pointers, setters, fox-hounds,

At eleven she talked unreservedly of the horses in the Lenfield stables as a pack of screws;1 at twelve she contributed her half-crown to a Derby sweepstakes amongst her father's servants, and triumphantly drew the winning horse; and at thirteen she rode across country with her cousin Andrew, who was a member of the Croydon hunt. It was not without grief that the banker watched his daughter's progress in these doubtful accomplishments; but she was so beautiful, so frank and fearless, so generous, affectionate, and true, that he could not bring himself to tell her that she was not all he could desire her to be. If he could have governed or directed that impetuous nature, he would have had her the most refined and elegant, the most perfect and accomplished of her sex; but he could not do this, and he was fain to thank God for her as she was, and to indulge her every whim.

She was a fair-faced, blue-eyed, rosy-lipped, golden-haired little girl, who thought Felden Woods a paradise upon earth, and Aurora more fortunate than the Princess Royal of England, or Titania, Queen of the Fairies.2 She was direfully afraid of her cousin's ponies and Newfoundland dogs, and had a firm conviction that sudden death held his throne within a certain radius of a horse's heels; but she loved and admired Aurora, after the manner common to these weaker natures, and accepted Miss Floyd's superb patronage and protection as a thing of course.




  
  


  The day came when some dark but undefined cloud hovered about the narrow home-circle at Felden Woods. There was a coolness

  between the banker and his beloved child. The young lady spent half her time on horseback, scouring the shady lanes round Beckenham, attended only by her groom a dashing young fellow, chosen by Mr. Floyd on account of his good looks for Aurora's especial service. She dined in her own room after these long, lonely rides, leaving her father to eat his solitary meal in the vast dining-room, which seemed to be fully occupied when she sat in it, and desolately empty without her. The household at Felden Woods long remembered one particular June evening on which the storm burst forth between the father and daughter.




  
  


  Aurora had been absent from two o'clock in the afternoon until sunset, and the banker paced the long stone terrace with his watch in his hand, the figures on the dial-plate barely distinguishable in the twilight, waiting for his daughters coming home. He had sent his dinner away untouched; his newspapers lay uncut upon the table, and the household spies, we call servants, told each other how his hand had shaken so violently that he had spilled half a decanter of wine over the polished mahogany in attempting to fill his glass. The housekeeper and her satellites crept into the hall, and looked through the half-glass doors at the anxious watcher on the terrace. The men in the stables talked of the row, as they called this terrible breach between father and child; and when at last horses' hoofs were heard in the long avenue, and Miss Floyd reined in her thorough-bred chestnut at the foot of the terrace-steps, there was a lurking audience hidden here and there in the evening shadow, eager to hear and see.




  
  


  But there was very little to gratify these prying eyes and ears. Aurora sprang lightly to the ground before the groom could dismount to assist her, and the chestnut, with heaving and foam-flecked sides, was led off to the stable.




  
  


  Mr. Floyd watched the groom and the two horses as they disappeared through the great gates leading to the stable-yard, and then said very quietly, You don't use that animal well, Aurora. A six hours' ride is neither good for her nor for you. Your groom should have known better than to allow it. He led the way into his study, telling his daughter to follow him, and they were closeted together for upwards of an hour.




  
  


  Early the next morning Miss Floyd's governess departed from Felden Woods, and between breakfast and luncheon the banker paid a"|"Aurora Floyd"|"Mary Elizabeth Braddon"

  the broad terrace, with the landscape stretching wide before him, and melting vaguely away under that veil of crimson glory shed upon all things by the sinking sun; even now that he hourly, nay, almost momentarily, expects to clasp his only child in his arms, Archibald Floyd seems rather nervously anxious than joyfully expectant.




  
  


  He looks again and again at his watch, and pauses in his walk to listen to Beckenham church clock striking eight; his ears are preternaturally alert to every sound, and give him instant warning of carriage-wheels far off upon the wide high-road. All the agitation and anxiety he has felt for the last week has been less than the concentrated fever of this moment. Will it pass on, that carriage, or stop at the lodge-gates? Surely his heart could never beat so loud save by some wondrous magnetism of fatherly love and hope. The carriage stops. He hears the clanking of the gates; the crimson-tinted landscape grows dim and blurred before his eyes, and he knows no more till a pair stung him to the quick. Proud and sensitive, like almost all very honest and conscientious men, he could not endure that any creature should dare to befoul the name of the woman he loved so tenderly. What was the obscurity from which he had taken her to him? Is a star less bright because it shines on a gutter as well as upon the purple bosom of the midnight sea? Is a virtuous and generous-hearted woman less worthy because you find her making a scanty living out of the only industry she can exercise; and acting Juliet to an audience of factory-hands, who give threepence apiece for the privilege of admiring and applauding her?




  
  


  Yes, the murder must out; the malicious were not altogether wrong in their conjectures: Eliza Prodder was an actress; and it was on the dirty boards of a second-rate theatre in Lancashire that the wealthy banker had first beheld her. Archibald Floyd nourished a traditional, passive, but sincere admiration for the British Drama. Yes, the British Drama; for he had lived in a day when the drama was British, and when George Barnwell and Jane Shore were amongst the favourite works of art of a play-going public. How sad that we should have degenerated since those classic days, and that the graceful story of Milwood and her apprentice-admirer is now so rarely set before us!1

  Talbot's close-cropped hair seemed lifted from his head as he listened to this terrible address. Good heavens! what a horrible woman! The hussar's vivid imagination pictured the heir of all the Raleigh Bulstrodes receiving his infantine impressions from such a mother. She would teach him to read out of the Racing Calendar;1 she would invent a royal alphabet of the turf, and tell him that D stands for Derby, old England's great race, and E stands for Epsom, a crack meeting-place, &c. He told Miss Floyd that he had never been to Doncaster in his life, that he had never read a sporting-paper, and that he knew no more of Thunderbolt than of King Cheops.




  
  


  She looked at him rather contemptuously. Cheops wasn't much, she said: he won the Liverpool Autumn Cup in Blink Bonny's year;2 but most people said it was a fluke.




  
  


  Talbot Bulstrode shuddered afresh; but a feeling of pity mingled with his horror. If I had a sister, he thought, I would get her to talk to this miserable girl, and bring her to a sense of her iniquity.




  
  


  Aurora said no more to the captain of Hussars, but relapsed into the old far-away gaze into vacancy, and sat twisting a bracelet round and round upon her finely modelled wrist. It was a diamond bracelet, worth a couple of hundred pounds, which had been given her that day by her father. He would have invested all his fortune in Messrs. Hunt and Roskell's cunning handiwork,3 if Aurora had sighed for gems and gewgaws. Miss Floyd's glance fell upon the glittering ornament, and she looked at it long and earnestly, rather as if she were calculating the value of the stones than admiring the taste of the workmanship.




  
  


  While Talbot was watching her, full of wondering pity and horror, a young man hurried up to the spot where she was seated, and

  very pharisaical in the speech, that Captain Bulstrode would not even finish it mentally. He was thinking, This girl, who, perhaps, has been the cause of nights of sleepless anxiety and days of devouring care, is tenderly beloved by her father; while I, who am a model to all the elder sons of England, have never been loved in my life.




  
  


  At half-past six the great bell at Felden Woods rang a clamorous peal that went shivering above the trees, to tell the country-side that the family were going to dress for dinner; and another peal at seven, to tell the villagers round Beckenham and West Wickham that Maister Floyd and his household were going to dine; but not altogether an empty or discordant peal, for it told the hungry poor of broken victuals and rich and delicate meats to be had almost for asking in the servants' offices; - shreds of fricandeaux1 and patches of dainty preparations, quarters of chickens and carcasses of pheasants, which would have gone to fatten the pigs for Christmas, but for Archibald Floyd's strict commands that all should be given to those who chose to come for it.




  
  


  Mr. Floyd and his visitors did not leave the gardens till after the ladies had retired to dress. The dinner-party was very animated, for Alexander Floyd drove down from the City to join his wife and daughter, bringing with him the noisy boy who was just going to Eton, and who was passionately attached to his cousin Aurora; and whether it was owing to the influence of this young gentleman, or to that fitfulness which seemed a part of her nature, Talbot Bulstrode could not discover, but certain it was that the dark cloud melted away from Miss Floyd's face, and she abandoned herself to the joyousness of the hour with a radiant grace, that reminded her father of the night when Eli Percival played Lady Teazle2 for the last time, and took her farewell of the stage in the little Lancashire theatre.




  
  


  It needed but this change in his daughter to make Archibald Floyd thoroughly happy. Aurora's smiles seemed to shed a revivifying influence upon the whole circle. The ice melted away, for the sun had broken out, and the winter was gone at last. Talbot Bulstrode bewildered his brain by trying to discover why it was that this woman was such a peerless and fascinating creature. Why it was that, argue as he
