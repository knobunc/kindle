"< 05:00"|"Shortly before five that morning"|"The night shift passed without event as Starbug tacked its way through the asteroid belt. First watch was taken by Lister and Kryten, the second by the Cat and Rimmer. Meantime Kochanski started the laborious process of going through the navi-calcs looking for the computational error that had caused them to wind up in the wrong dimension. Shortly before five that morning, working by the eye-aching neon up in the obs room, she fell asleep on top of a pyramid of computer print-outs, and slept soundly for the next two and a half hours."|"Last Human"|"Doug Naylor"
"ap 07:00"|"Seven o'clock"|"Rimmer passed her sleeping body, then clicked down the steps that led into the mid-section and turned into the galley.
'Seven o'clock change-over. Anything to report?'
Kryten looked up from his breakfast preparations. 'It's been a moderately quiet shift, sir, apart from one small scare a couple of hours ago, when we spotted an alien invasion fleet off the port bow. Thankfully, it turned out to be one of Mr Lister's old sneezes that had congealed on the radar screen.'"|"Last Human"|"Doug Naylor"

"ap 02:59"|"One of three"|"'That's his daughter?'
'One of three, sir. Apparently she's the looker.'
'Hey, wait - what about Kriss? I'm taken.'"|"Last Human"|"Doug Naylor"
14:30|"2.30 p.m."|"Kochanski placed the bowl of porridge on the breakfast tray beside a plate of bacon and eggs. She glanced at her watch â€” 2.30 p.m. ship time; he'd probably be awake now. She climbed the steps up to Starbug's sleeping quarters. 'Hey, Frog Prince, I've brought you some breakfast. Did you sleep?' She kissed him softly on the lips."|"Last Human"|"Doug Naylor"
"ap > 03:00"|"after three"|"Six hours later, after three muscle-pummelling round-trips from Starbug to the Mayflower and back again, Kochanski's body hit the springs of her bunk. She was asleep in seconds. Noiselessly, Kryten slipped on his diving suit and set the air-lock for remote. Within minutes he was striding back across the ocean bed in the direction of the Mayflower."|"Last Human"|"Doug Naylor"
