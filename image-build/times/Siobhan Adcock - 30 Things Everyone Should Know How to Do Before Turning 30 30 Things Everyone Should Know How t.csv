    really cold outside you should remove the vent caps (carefully) to see if the

    fluid inside the battery is frozen—all batteries are filled with an

    electrolyte solution (part water, part sulfuric acid), and in weak batteries

    this fluid can freeze at about 15 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit. If you see ice

    crystals in the battery fluid, don’t try to jump the car. You have to

    thaw the battery fluid first; get the car into a warm garage and wait. In cold

    cities people often plug their cars into engine heaters overnight to keep their

    battery fluid from freezing, and if you’re in a jam, it may be worth your

    while to see if any of your neighbors have one. As a last resort, some folks

    have been known to remove the entire battery, bring it into the house, and put

    it into a tub of lukewarm water for an hour. My own father used to go out into

    the driveway with an extension cord and a carefully wielded hair dryer at 6

    A.M. on cold school days in Chicago. But by his

    own admission, that’s a little nuts."|"30 Things Everyone Should Know How to Do Before Turning 30 30 Things Everyone Should Know How t"|"Siobhan Adcock"
