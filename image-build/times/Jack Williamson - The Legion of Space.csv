I’ve known for several years that I’m going to die at eleven-seven on the morning of March 23, 1945.”"|"The Legion of Space"|"Jack Williamson"
00:00|midnight|"“I was still falling, all right. I was in the same position—but no longer on the Earth. All around me was a weird plain. It was blazing with a glare of light, pitted with thousands of craters, ringed with mountains higher than any I had ever seen. The Sun was burning down out of a blue sky dark as midnight, and full of stars. There was another body in the heavens, huge and greenish."|"The Legion of Space"|"Jack Williamson"
"ap 11:07"|eleven-seven|"Influenza, with pulmonary complications. The outlook seemed good enough, the first few days, and I knew that old John Delmar’s fighting heart had pulled him through a hundred more desperate situations. But sulfa and penicillin failed. His old heart surrendered. He knew he was going to die, and he did—quite peacefully, under an oxygen tent, on the morning of March 23. I was standing by his bed, and I looked at my watch.
The time was eleven-seven.
Whatever others may decide, I was well enough convinced, even before the proof of death. John Delmar at first wished to have his manuscripts destroyed, because his splendid scheme of a full history of the next thousand years was far from complete, but I persuaded him to leave the finished sections in my hands.

An elderly thin man, very much agitated, he called out all the Legionnaires to station them about the old walls and towers with hand proton guns. For three hours John Star lay on his stomach, watching a crumbling redoubt. But nothing happened; at midnight he was dismissed."|"The Legion of Space"|"Jack Williamson"

The ship—the one that landed last night—came from that planet of Barnard’s Star. Monstrous creatures aboard, allies of Eric’s—it was one of them that murdered Captain Otan. He’s promised them a ship-load of iron, to pay for their part. Iron is precious to them. The ship took Eric away, and Aladoree. I was—hit. Can just now walk again.”"|"The Legion of Space"|"Jack Williamson"

It was long after midnight when the last light-tube went out.
Then, until the lemon-green dawn, they waited on the platform, scanning the star-sifted purple, anxious for the blue rocket-exhausts that would brake the descending ship. But they saw no moving thing, save the faint tiny spark of Phobos, rising in the west and creeping swiftly eastward."|"The Legion of Space"|"Jack Williamson"
