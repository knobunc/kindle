19:35|"7:35 P.M."|"I was sure we’d been overdue for our landing in Quito when I woke up. Miranda said she’d looked at her watch too: but she thought we’d been halfway through the flight time. My watch had been ripped from my wrist somehow when we were in the sea. Miranda was wearing hers. It looked undamaged but it had stopped at 7:35 P.M. . . . But that was very confusing, because at 7:35 P.M. Miami time last night, our delayed flight had hardly left the tarmac. Miranda’s watch was not a reliable witness, but that didn’t prove I was right. This obviously wasn’t Quito, or anywhere in the mountains of Ecuador, but where would halfway from Florida to Ecuador put us on the map? We talked back and forth about time zones, and whether we’d remembered to change our watches, trying to work it out and getting nowhere."|"Dr. Franklin's Island"|"Ann Halam"
12:00|midday|"Our method was to walk along the beach until we came to a natural opening in the trees, then head in toward the foot of the cliff, turn north there and explore until we got stopped by a thorn thicket. Then we’d fight our way out to the beach again and repeat the process. By midday we were farther toward the headland than ever before, and we’d found a grove of wild guava trees; but the fruit we’d knocked down with our multipurpose sharpened sticks was too woody to eat. Otherwise, there was nothing to report. It was thirsty work. Even half a day trekking showed us how hopeless it would be to set out on a longer expedition without carrying lots of water."|"Dr. Franklin's Island"|"Ann Halam"

My boss doesn’t need sleep. At midnight he takes a break from work, comes out and walks around the compound, checking every building, every door, it’s a habit with him.”"|"Dr. Franklin's Island"|"Ann Halam"
