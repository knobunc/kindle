"~ 18:00"|"about six o'clock in the evening"|"Except that along about six o'clock in the evening I woke up and the car 
was stopping and I didn't know where I was, I must have slept all day, and 
the guy says to me, ""Here you are, Eden, North Carolina."""|"Eye for Eye"|"Orson Scott Card"
"< 20:30"|"near eight-thirty at night"|"It must've been near eight-thirty at night, and even the little kids still 
wasn't in bed. They must let their kids play till they get wore out and 
drop down and fall asleep by themselves. It came to me that maybe I wasn't 
so bad off growing up in an orphanage. At least I knew manners and didn't 
whip it out and pee right in front of company, the way one little boy did, 
just looking at me while I got out of the car, whizzing away like he wasn't 
doing nothing strange. Like a dog marking trees. He needed to so he done 
it. If I ever did that at the Children's Home they'd've slapped me silly."|"Eye for Eye"|"Orson Scott Card"
"ap > 09:00"|"after nine"|"But she was trying, and it wasn't all her fault, so I ate the cookie and 
drank off the last of the milk and my watch said it was after nine. Outside 
it was dusk now, and most of the kids were finally gone off to bed, and 
Daddy comes in and says, ""Papa Lem says he isn't getting any younger."""|"Eye for Eye"|"Orson Scott Card"
