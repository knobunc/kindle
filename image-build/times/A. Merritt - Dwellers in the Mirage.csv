"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"“If we camp at the base of those hills, we’ll be out of that wind,” said
  Jim. “It’s five o’clock. We ought to make it in an hour.”"|"Dwellers in the Mirage"|"A. Merritt"
"ap 10:00"|"Ten o’clock"|"We went into the tent. We had been in it before with Evalie. It had been
  empty then except for a pile of soft pelts and silken stuffs at one side. Now
  there were two such piles. We shed our clothes in the pale green darkness and
  turned in. I looked at my watch.
“Ten o’clock,” I said. “How many months since morning?”
“At least six. If you keep me awake I’ll murder you. I’m tired.”"|"Dwellers in the Mirage"|"A. Merritt"
"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"Jim left with a party of about a hundred of the pygmies about noon. I bade
  him a cheerful good-bye. If it puzzled Evalie that I took his departure so
  calmly, and asked her no questions she did not show it. But she was very
  quiet that day, speaking mostly in monosyllables abstractedly. Once or twice
  I caught her looking at me with a curious wonder in her eyes. And once I had
  taken her hand, and she had quivered and leaned toward me, and then snatched
  it away, half-angrily. And once when she had forgotten her moodiness and had
  rested against my shoulder, I had fought hard against taking her in my
  arms."|"Dwellers in the Mirage"|"A. Merritt"
00:00|midnight|"It was night. It was essential to reach the edge of the forest before the
  last third of the stretch between midnight and dawn. The hoofs of the horses
  were muffled so that no sharp ears might hear their distant tread, and the
  soldiers marched in open formation, noiselessly. Five days had passed since I
  had first looked on the fortress."|"Dwellers in the Mirage"|"A. Merritt"

  your own, sweet goddess!"|"Dwellers in the Mirage"|"A. Merritt"
