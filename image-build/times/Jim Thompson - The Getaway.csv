"ap 06:00"|"six o'clock"|"Carter ""Doc"" McCoy had left a morning call for six o'clock, and he was reaching for the telephone the moment the night clerk rang. He had always awakened easily and pleasantly; a man with not a regret for the past, and completely confident and self-assured as he faced each new day. Twelve years of prison routine had merely molded his natural tendencies into habit."|"The Getaway"|"Jim Thompson"
"ap 07:43"|"seventeen minutes of eight"|"There just wasn't much of anything stirring after that. As Charlie put it, you could have fired a machine gun down Main Street without hitting a soul. It was due to the recent changeover to daylight saving time, Charlie thought; folks hadn't got used to it yet. Maybe the clock said it was getting kind of late—seventeen minutes of eight—but it still wasn't seven to the people."|"The Getaway"|"Jim Thompson"
"ap 08:30"|eight-thirty|"""Some code, huh? Must have took Doc two or three minutes to figure out with a pair of binoculars. But just the three employees will use the code; they'll show between now and eight-thirty. The big cheese gets here about a quarter of, and he don't knock. Just rattles the door latch and says, 'Wingate, Wingate!'"""|"The Getaway"|"Jim Thompson"
08:00|"eight o'clock in the morning"|"At eight o'clock in the morning she was within sixty miles of the town. After breakfasting on the rolls and coffee she had brought with her, and a quick wash in a filling station, she felt quite rested and highspirited despite the long hours at the wheel."|"The Getaway"|"Jim Thompson"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"She began to drive slower, to glance more and more frequently at the dashboard clock and the speedometer's mileage indicator. At nine she saw a puff of black smoke spout up in the distance; then a billowing oily cloud of it. Carol nodded approvingly."|"The Getaway"|"Jim Thompson"
"ap < 09:20"|"almost nine-twenty"|"She lighted a cigarette, flipped it away after a puff or two, and stared narrowly through the windshield. Nine-fifteen—no, it was almost nine-twenty. And she hadn't got the signal yet, the winking left headlight. True, one of those distant oncoming cars had suddenly disappeared from the highway—there went another one right now—but that didn't mean anything. There were many turnoffs; up through tree-lined farm lanes, or cutting between one farm and another."|"The Getaway"|"Jim Thompson"
"ap 09:30"|nine-thirty|"""Charlie, does that train into the city leave at ninetwenty or nine-thirty? Fine, that's what I thought. No, no cab, thanks. I can use a little walk."""|"The Getaway"|"Jim Thompson"
"ap 08:50"|"ten minutes of nine"|"It was ten minutes of nine. Doc adjusted his tie and put on his suit jacket. Now it was five minutes of. He picked up the wastebasket and stepped out into the hall."|"The Getaway"|"Jim Thompson"
"ap 08:58"|"two minutes of nine"|"He picked up the wastebasket and returned to his room. It was two minutes of nine now—two minutes before the bombs were set to explode—and three or four people were gathered in front of the bank, waiting for it to open."|"The Getaway"|"Jim Thompson"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o'clock"|"""Then he shouldn't have got on either! Or he ought to've bought himself some Pullman space."" He jabbed a train check into the window clip, yanked a coupon from the ticket book and tossed it down onto the seat. ""You don't have enough money there, mister,"" he snapped at Doc. ""The first scheduled stop for this train is ten o'clock tonight."""|"The Getaway"|"Jim Thompson"
"ap 10:00"|"Ten o'clock"|"Carol's mouth tightened nervously. Ten o'clock—more than nine hours from now! They could never maintain the masquerade of the ""sleeping"" man that long. The conductor was already studying him narroweyed, turning a suspicious gaze toward Doc."|"The Getaway"|"Jim Thompson"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o'clock"|"""And there's no big hurry,"" Doc pointed out. ""I've got a hunch that our late traveling companion will go right on sleeping, undisturbed, until that ten o'clock stop. Even if they found out the nature of his slumber before then, it wouldn't matter much. The body has to be posted. That takes time, and it can't be done in just any hick village. Then there's the conductor's story of an old neck injury—along with the conductor's guilty conscience—to add confusion to the proceedings."" He laughed softly. ""If I know anything about human nature, he'll swear that our friend was alive and in good health at the time we left him."""|"The Getaway"|"Jim Thompson"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o'clock"|"With the first rays of sunlight, the manure pile began to gather heat. By ten o'clock, when Carol came suddenly awake, Doc had stripped himself naked except for his shoes and socks, and was sitting crosslegged on his pile of clothes."|"The Getaway"|"Jim Thompson"
"ap 00:00"|twelve|"Doc nodded vaguely. He refilled their glasses. In the palace tower a great bell began to toll the hour of twelve. And in the ballroom the band struck up the strains of 'Home Sweet Home.'"|"The Getaway"|"Jim Thompson"
