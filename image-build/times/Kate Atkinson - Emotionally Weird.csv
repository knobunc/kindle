"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"A MONDAY MORNING AND MY DREAMS WERE INTERRUPTED AT some unearthly hour by the doorbell ringing with a shrill urgency that implied death, tragedy or a sudden, unexpected inheritance. It was none of those things (not yet anyway), it was Terri. It was only seven o’clock and it seemed likely therefore that rather than being up early she hadn’t actually been to bed at all."|"Emotionally Weird"|"Kate Atkinson"
"ap 11:10"|"Ten minutes after eleven"|"‘BLAH, BLAH, BLAH,’ ARCHIE SAID. (OR SOMETHING LIKE that.) Ten minutes after eleven in Archie McCue’s room on the third floor of the extension to Robert Matthews’ soaring sixties’ Tower – the Queen’s Tower, although no queen was ever likely to live in it. The gloomy atmosphere was made gloomier by the absence of electricity. A candle, stuck in an empty Blue Nun bottle, burned at the window like a signal. The university was still managing to run its heating although no-one knew how – perhaps they were burning books, or (more likely) students. The room was hot and airless and I had to peel off my layers of reject golfing sweaters, one by one."|"Emotionally Weird"|"Kate Atkinson"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"When I returned at six o’clock, Bob was exactly where I had left him – the bicycling Bob had given me a misleading impression of activity, Bob was merely borrowing the bike from someone else so he could stuff the saddlebags with home-grown grass and transport them across town."|"Emotionally Weird"|"Kate Atkinson"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"‘The man’s perfectly idiotic,’ Maggie Mackenzie said and then turned to me and said irascibly, ‘Tomorrow will do for me. I want your George Eliot on my desk by five o’clock,’ she beetled her brows threateningly, ‘or else,’ and stomped off abruptly down the corridor."|"Emotionally Weird"|"Kate Atkinson"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"Seeing Martha had been a blow as I had been hoping to avoid her two o’clock creative writing tutorial, but now that she’d seen me I supposed I was going to have to put in an appearance in her class. I looked up and was startled to see Watson Grant lowering in the doorway."|"Emotionally Weird"|"Kate Atkinson"
"ap 02:00"|two|"Bob shook his head in a fish farm sort of way. ‘Wow, who thinks this stuff up? What are they on?’ We had exited the lift by now, of course, as it only takes a sentence to travel the two floors to the ground, and then a longish paragraph to reach the Students’ Union where, to a seemingly endless diet of ‘American Pie’ on the jukebox, I plied Bob with (Scotch) pie and beans in an effort to cheer him up. Terri was asleep at a table. She was wearing a long cloak and a pair of high-heeled black boots with a little astrakhan ankle-trim and had a moth-eaten black lace parasol clutched in her nerveless hand. She looked like someone Jack the Ripper would be attracted to. I told Bob to tell her to meet at two o’clock in the Tower and left him playing table football while I went to a women’s liberation meeting."|"Emotionally Weird"|"Kate Atkinson"
18:00|6.00p.m.|"At the back of the Tower a student who sold the Socialist Worker on Saturdays thrust a yellow leaflet into my hand. In crude black letters it said, ‘END THE FASCISM NOW! – All concerned meet in New Dines 6.00p.m.’ A sudden gust of wind caught it and whisked it out of my hands."|"Emotionally Weird"|"Kate Atkinson"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"We sat in the foyer discussing the dog’s whereabouts right through the two o’clock bell and the general hubbub of people going to lectures and only at ten minutes past the hour could we finally bring ourselves to make our way to Martha’s room."|"Emotionally Weird"|"Kate Atkinson"
"ap 23:55"|"five to twelve"|"It was when the bell rang at five to twelve and no-one moved that a horrible realization dawned on me – this was a two-hour seminar. I thought about fainting but that was Andrea’s usual ruse for getting out of sticky situations."|"Emotionally Weird"|"Kate Atkinson"
"ap 08:00"|"EIGHT O’CLOCK"|"UNBELIEVABLY, IT WAS ONLY EIGHT O’CLOCK WHEN I got home. I ate Cornish Wafers and Philadelphia cream cheese; I watched the news, although I turned it off when it showed trees being napalmed. I read Me and Miss Mandible and listened to After the Gold Rush; I washed out a pair of tights and sewed on a button. I ate more Cornish Wafers, but I had run out of Philadelphia. I wrote a halfhearted sentence of Henry James (James’s implication is not only that the novel is episodic and fragmented but also that it is a vehicle for far too much analytic and philosophical intrusion on the part of the author herself –) until finally I went to bed only to be woken a couple of hours later by Shug and Bob rolling in with a couple of traffic cones and a clutch of warm rolls from Cuthbert’s all-night bakery. Of my mysterious promised visitor there had been no sign at all."|"Emotionally Weird"|"Kate Atkinson"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"Bob and Shug started playing a relentless, noisy game of Diplomacy until, overcome by an attack of the munchies, they went out into the darkness on a quest for Mars Bars. The clock by the bed said six o’clock. I wondered if it was morning or night. It didn’t make any difference, I was wide awake anyway. There seemed to be nothing for it but to write."|"Emotionally Weird"|"Kate Atkinson"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"‘I want that essay on my desk at ten o’clock on Friday,’ Maggie Mackenzie said sharply, ‘or else. You’ll thank me for this later, you know.’"|"Emotionally Weird"|"Kate Atkinson"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"‘Miss Andrews,’ she said stiffly, ‘I will extend my deadline for you as you are so incompetent. You have until ten o’clock on the day after tomorrow.’"|"Emotionally Weird"|"Kate Atkinson"
"~ 11:00"|elevenses|"‘And a bit of a treat for elevenses?’ Lolly said, and together they conducted the ritual of surveying the trays of iced fancies and cream cakes."|"Emotionally Weird"|"Kate Atkinson"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"It felt very late, although the clock in reception only said nine o’clock."|"Emotionally Weird"|"Kate Atkinson"
"ap 01:15"|"quarter past one"|"The thought of Martha made me feel suddenly stricken with guilt about Terri. By Philippa’s kitchen clock it was now a quarter past one. Terri must surely be awake by now (although perhaps not) and wondering if Hank aka Buddy had gone AWOL.‘You take three words,’ Professor Cousins was explaining, ‘and you try and make a sentence from them. For example fish,’ he bowed courteously at the ruins of the salmon, ‘table and, um, let me see, erythrophobia.’"|"Emotionally Weird"|"Kate Atkinson"
12:00|mid-day|"God’s favoured time for a little chat with Mabel was in the afternoons, so once lunch was done with and the pots cleared, Mabel would sit in the ladder-back chair in the corner of the kitchen, hands folded quietly in her lap as if in a private church and wait for God to find her. Naturally, God could, if necessary, communicate at any time, even, Mabel once shyly revealed to me, when she was ‘on the WC’, which was a natural act created by God Himself. But the afternoons were the best as far as both Mabel and God were concerned, after a nice lunch – boiled bacon and salad and new potatoes and a slice of apple pie with cheese was a favourite mid-day repast (of Mabel, not God).Listening out for God was the only time her hands were idle; the rest of the time they were the busiest hands He ever fashioned. Mabel was particularly fond of knitting; sometimes she unravelled things on purpose just so that she would have something to knit back up again."|"Emotionally Weird"|"Kate Atkinson"
"> 01:00"|"past one in the morning"|"I got a lift home on the back of the farmer’s son’s tractor and walked the last few hundred yards home. I was still hot from the dancing and the falling in love and so on, and didn’t feel the cold at all. It was past one in the morning but there was a full moon – a fat, cheesy moon, more suited to a harvest than a cold spring night. The cattle in the fields were all due to calve and I could hear their restless shuffling and puffing, but other than that it was so quiet. I felt as though I was standing on the edge of something high and glorious, flexing my wings and getting ready to fly."|"Emotionally Weird"|"Kate Atkinson"
06:32|"6.32 a.m."|"The woman was finally brought to shore and logged by a pale Constable Collins at 6.32 a.m. precisely. After an undignified struggle to get her out of the boat, the policeman finally lifted her dead-weighted body ashore in his arms. He thought of the warm body of his wife still asleep in their bed in their little modern house and his sky-blue eyes clouded over. What had she meant last night when she’d rolled over in bed and stared at him unpleasantly and said she was dying of boredom? One thing was certain: it couldn’t be worse than death by drowning."|"Emotionally Weird"|"Kate Atkinson"
