"< 00:00"|"towards midnight"|"I was drunk. It was getting on towards midnight in the Jacobite bar and at my normal rate of drinking that meant I’d had about ten pints of export. Ash and Dean Watt, and another couple of old pals, Andy Langton and Lizzie Polland, had all drunk about the same as I had, but then they’d been home for their tea and they hadn’t been swilling back the Urvill’s whisky for a significant part of the afternoon."|"The Crow Road"|"Iain Banks"
00:00|midnight|"The gear was black and powerful like the night; the hollow aluminium skull of the observatory tracked the ‘scope’s single eye slowly over the rolling web of stars, or - hand-cranked - swivelled the universe about our one fixed point. Soon my head was spinning, too. The music machine played away - far away - and when I started to understand the lyrics of a Cocteau Twins song, I knew I was wrecked. The stars shone on in mysterious galactic harmonies, constellations like symphonies of ancient, trembling light; Lewis told weird and creepy stories and bizarrely apposite jokes, and the twins - hunkered over the little card-table in their quilted jackets, their night-black hair straight and shining and framing their broad-boned beautiful faces - looked like proud Mongolian princesses, calmly contemplating creation from the ribbed dome of some fume-filled yurt, midnight-pitched on the endless rolling Asian steppe."|"The Crow Road"|"Iain Banks"
"ap ~ 02:00"|"About two"|"‘Yes; very impressive.’ Kenneth kissed his sister’s cheek. How old had she been when he’d come out here with Fergus and the rest? About two, he guessed. Not old enough to come all this way on a bike. He must have been eight or nine. He wondered where Hamish had been; ill, maybe. He’d always been taking colds."|"The Crow Road"|"Iain Banks"
22:00|"ten in the evening"|"But if this is the price we have to pay for all-day opening and letting women into public bars, then I admit it may well be churlish to carp. I used to think dad was kidding about bars closing in the afternoon, and at ten in the evening (TEN, for Christ’s sake; I don’t go out until midnight sometimes!), and about some not having women’s toilets at all ... but apparently it’s all true, and scarcely a decade and a half gone."|"The Crow Road"|"Iain Banks"

04:00|"four in the morning"|"I looked at my watch. We’d been stuck here, waiting to join the main line into Queen Street, for about ten minutes. You often had to wait here while the Edinburgh trains came and went, but the delay didn’t usually last this long. The station was only five minutes away; more importantly, food was only five minutes away. I’d forgone breakfast because I hadn’t got to bed till four in the morning, lunch because I had a hangover and anyway I was late for the train, and due to the fact that it was - according to British Rail at any rate - still part of the extended Festive Period, there had been no buffet trolley on the train. I was starving. I was so hungry I’d have eaten pork scratchings. Queen Street station, a scant mile and a half away, had burgers, sandwiches, shell pies, french fries and french sticks, bridies and pasties and patties. My God, if all they had were Haggisburgers, I’d eat those."|"The Crow Road"|"Iain Banks"

It was only eight o’clock; obviously I’d conked out some time before everybody else, and they were still asleep (I had heard appropriate log-sawing-like noises coming from Hamish and Tone’s room on my way back from the bathroom). The day looked bright but cold; I laced up the Docs and went for a walk in the hills behind Gallanach."|"The Crow Road"|"Iain Banks"

The last revellers had finally been seen off at nine in the morning; they and Margot had done some cleaning up before going to bed, though Ken had anyway had a couple of hours’ sleep between three and five, when he’d fallen into a deep slumber on the wicker couch in the conservatory. The boys had gone out to play on the forestry tracks with their new bikes on what had proved a bright but cold day; Mary had got three hours’ sleep before they came back, noisily demanding to be fed."|"The Crow Road"|"Iain Banks"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"He went down through the lower hall to the kitchen, drank some water. His watch said it was two o’clock; so did the kitchen clock.

Did she think he was dangerous, was that it?"|"The Crow Road"|"Iain Banks"

"~ 12:00"|"about mid-day"|"James arrived back about mid-day. He was ... well, pretty distressed, and all the fragile defences mum, Lewis and I had been constructing for the past few days - Lewis and I joking, mum staying quiet and keeping busy - crumbled. James seemed to blame dad, blame us; blame everybody. He was ugly with anger and he was like a racing outboard in the calm little pond we’d been trying to create; the house felt hellish and we all started snapping at each other. Outside, at the back of the garden, we could hear the council digger, excavating the rest of the hole. The engine revved up and down; it sounded like a machine snoring. James wished us all dead and ran up to his room and slammed the door. It was a relief to get back out to the grave and help Jimmy Turrock apply the finishing touches."|"The Crow Road"|"Iain Banks"

12:00|mid-day|"I sipped my Bloody Mary, looking down at huge, white, piled-up clouds so bright in the mid-day sunshine they looked yellow. The plane had just levelled out and there was a smell of food; they were serving lunch further forward in the cabin. I watched the clouds for a moment, then looked at my magazine. I was on my way to London, a couple of torn-off match-book covers in my pocket, hoping to confront Mr Rupert Paxton-Marr."|"The Crow Road"|"Iain Banks"
"~ 02:00"|"about 2am"|"I’d finished the paper about 2am and printed it out. I thought about getting in the car there and then, dropping the paper through the letter-box of a pal who’d take it in to the department for me tomorrow, and then heading for Lochgair. But I was tired, and I’d already told mum I’d be down in the morning; I didn’t want to wake her by arriving in the middle of the night."|"The Crow Road"|"Iain Banks"
"ap ~ 10:00"|"about ten o’clock"|"I’d stayed in the Lochgair house over Hogmanay itself. We had plenty of drink in, and mum and I had prepared loads of food, but not many people actually visited after the bells. Verity went to bed about ten past midnight after struggling to stay awake from about ten o’clock. She had a very small glass of whisky at the bells. Some people from the village came in about one, Aunt Tone and Uncle Hamish arrived about two for half an hour of strained conversation, and some of James’s pals called in after four, but mostly it was just mum, Lewis, James and I together. James conked out about six, but Lewis and I were determined to see the dawn come up just on principle."|"The Crow Road"|"Iain Banks"

I lay there for a bit, listening to soft rain hitting the bedroom window. Maybe that was what had woken me. I turned over to go to sleep again, then suddenly started to wonder if I’d turned the computer off. I had the feeling that I had, but I couldn’t actually remember doing so. Fuck it, I thought; it would be safe enough. I rolled over onto my other side."|"The Crow Road"|"Iain Banks"
"ap 04:00"|four|"James - who’d earlier been appalled that he’d only missed the first two periods of school while the police interviewed him - arrived back at four, glowing with glory. Apparently his part in the night’s events - which I’d thought consisted largely of sticking his head round his bedroom door and being told to get back in again (and doing as he was told, for once) - had gained something in the translation at school; I suspected the gains involved the single-handed beating-off an attack by an entire gang of ninja assassins while mum and I slept."|"The Crow Road"|"Iain Banks"

The Range Rover passed through the town a little before one o’clock and continued north to Connel, waited for the traffic lights to change at the old bridge over the Falls of Lora, then crossed, negotiated some road-works and finally turned left off the road a little further on, entering the thin strip of level coastal ground that was the Connel airstrip."|"The Crow Road"|"Iain Banks"

The plane taxied to the end of the runway, faced into a wind and then took off into a five-knot south-westerly breeze, in good visibility under a five-thousand-foot cloud-base of light overcast. The forecast said the breeze would freshen and veer to the south east that evening, and the following few days would be bright and clear with a steady southerly wind of force three or four."|"The Crow Road"|"Iain Banks"

I hadn’t been able to decide whether this really was the most north-westerly point of the island - there was a place with the appropriate name of Gallan Head that might have done as well - but in the end I thought maybe it didn’t really matter that much, and anyway this headland was easier to get to."|"The Crow Road"|"Iain Banks"

We opened a bottle of Graves I had in the kitchen - after first agreeing that of course we shouldn’t - and then walked from room to room while I did my guided tour bit and pointed out the more interesting or valuable works of art, while we sipped our wine and the statues gleamed and the chandeliers glittered and the paintings glowed and the carpets spread before us like gigantic blow-ups of oddly symmetrical printed circuits."|"The Crow Road"|"Iain Banks"
