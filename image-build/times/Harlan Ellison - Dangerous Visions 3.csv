One man might get along beautifully with some mild kind of sexual relief twice a month or less. Another might normally look for it eight, nine times a day.”"|"Dangerous Visions 3"|"Harlan Ellison"
12:00|noon|"Let’s see, that Saturday, the twelfth, was the third day of three days and nights I had been slogging away at it, and at last I had it going the way I wanted to. And it seems I have these good kind friends whom we will call Joe and Selma (because I have the feeling—very strong— that you will meet them one day). And they are close and helpful and admiring (and admired) friends and they were with me all the way in my struggle, and they live in Kingston. When noon (Saturday) came and went they were here running coffee and more or less shouting encouragement, and they said never mind missing the last mail at Woodstock, they’d stick around until it was finished and run it into the central post office in Kingston where it would get off even late Saturday night. Betimes Selma had to leave but Joe stuck around. ‘Long about six Selma called to find out how it was going because now their own affairs were pressing: Joe had to take a bus to Stroudsburg where he would spend a week. He said for her to pack for him, he’d be in in plenty of time. Finally I was done and he grabbed the envelopes (one to Ashmead and one to you) and jumped in his car and beat it. I was so bushed I couldn’t sleep and spent almost the whole night glassy-eyed; when you called the next day I was something like delirious."|"Dangerous Visions 3"|"Harlan Ellison"

I wasn’t sure what the hell they were at first, see, so I went up and looked at one. It was a skinny, hairless man, all folded up in a bottle inside another bottle. Weird-looking.”"|"Dangerous Visions 3"|"Harlan Ellison"

All pertinent data on them were switched over to UTERINE SUPPLY, which clocked them in at 400 hrs GMT, day 1, yr 1989. MEDCENTRAL agreed on the time check, then switched itself off."|"Dangerous Visions 3"|"Harlan Ellison"

In some inexplicable manner this convinced him to become a writer. He returned to New York, wound up living and working in Greenwich Village and put in a stint in the hospital where he contracted something called toxic hepatitis, ran temperatures of 1060 for five days straight, hallucinating all the while, and held off interns with a bedpan while calling the Pentagon (collect, naturally, he wasn’t that nuts) and waking a general at 2 a.m., thus getting the idea for his story in this anthology—the interaction between external and internal mythical-subjective universes. Whatever the hell that means."|"Dangerous Visions 3"|"Harlan Ellison"

Then climbed out, and down to the square in front of St. Sulpice where Bo tried to knock me into the fountain."|"Dangerous Visions 3"|"Harlan Ellison"
