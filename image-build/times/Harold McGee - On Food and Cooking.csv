They derive from the Sephardic Sabbath mixed stew (called hamin, from the Hebrew for “hot”), which was put together on Friday, cooked slowly in the oven overnight, and served as a midday Sabbath meal. Eggs included in the stew shell and all, or alternatively long-simmered in water, come out with a stronger flavor and a striking, tan-colored white. During prolonged heating in alkaline conditions, the quarter-gram of glucose sugar in the white reacts with albumen protein to generate flavors and pigments typical of browned foods (see the explanation of the Maillard reaction on p. 778).

A slow oven may coagulate the surfaces so gradually that the expanding mix spills out of its dish rather than rising vertically.

"ap ~ 23:51"|"around 9 to 12"|"Creating Clarity, Color, and Flavor The real transforming agent in pidan is the alkaline material, which gradually raises the already alkaline egg from a pH of around 9 to 12 or more. This chemical stress causes what might be thought of as an inorganic version of fermentation: that is, it denatures the egg proteins, and breaks down some of the complex, flavorless proteins and fats into simpler, highly flavorful components. The disruptively high pH forces the egg proteins to unfold, and at the same time confers on them a strongly repelling negative charge. The dissolved salt, with its positive and negative ions, moderates the repulsion enough that the fine strands of widely dispersed albumen proteins are able to bond into a solid yet transparent gel. In the yolk, the same extreme conditions destroy the organized structure of the yolk spheres, and with it the usual graininess; the yolk proteins coagulate into a creamy mass. The extreme alkalinity also browns the albumen by accelerating the reaction between the proteins and the trace of glucose (see p. 89), and it greens the yolk by encouraging the formation of ferrous sulfide throughout the yolk, not just at its surface (as in hard-cooked eggs; see p. 89). Finally, the alkalinity intensifies the egg’s flavor by breaking down both proteins and phospholipids into hydrogen sulfide, distinctly animal fatty acids, and pungent ammonia (the fumes from a freshly opened egg will turn litmus paper blue)."|"On Food and Cooking"|"Harold McGee"
"~ 02:00"|"about 2.5 hours"|"Rigor Mortis
The Importance of Timing, Posture, and Temperature For a brief period after the animal’s death its muscles are relaxed, and if immediately cut and cooked will make especially tender meat. Soon, however, the muscles clench in the condition called rigor mortis (“stiffness of death”). If cooked in this state, they make very tough meat. Rigor sets in (after about 2.5 hours in the steer, 1 hour or less in lamb, pork, and chicken) when the muscle fibers run out of energy, their control systems fail and trigger a contracting movement of the protein filaments, and the filaments lock in place. Carcasses are hung up in such a way that most of their muscles are stretched by gravity, so that the protein filaments can’t contract and overlap very much; otherwise the filaments bunch up and bond very tightly and the meat becomes exceptionally tough. Eventually, protein-digesting enzymes within the muscle fibers begin to eat away the framework that holds the actin and myosin filaments in place. The filaments are still locked together, and the muscles cannot be stretched, but the overall muscle structure weakens, and the meat texture softens. This is the beginning of the aging process. It becomes noticeable after about a day in beef, after several hours in pork and chicken."|"On Food and Cooking"|"Harold McGee"

Oven “Roasting”
In contrast to the grill, the oven is an indirect and more uniform means of cooking. The primary heat source, whether flame, coil, or coal, heats the oven, and the oven then heats the food from all sides, by means of convection currents of hot air and infrared radiation from the oven walls (p. 784). Oven heating is a relatively slow method, well suited to large cuts of meat that take time to heat through. Its efficiency is especially influenced by the cooking temperature, which can be anything from 200 up to 500ºF/95–260ºC and above. Cooking times range from 60 to 10 (or fewer) minutes per pound/500 gm."|"On Food and Cooking"|"Harold McGee"
"ap 01:30"|130|"Cook the fish through with the gentlest possible heat, so that the outer portions aren’t badly overcooked. Oven baking and poaching well below the boil are two good ways to do this, after an initial and brief high-temperature treatment to brown and/or sterilize the surfaces.
Compensate for uneven thickness by cutting slashes in the thick areas every 1–2 cm. This effectively divides the thick areas into smaller portions and allows heat to penetrate more rapidly. Another strategy for relatively large portions is to cover thin areas loosely with aluminum foil, which blocks radiant heat and slows their cooking.
Check the fish early and often for doneness. Simple formulas — 10 minutes to the inch is a popular one — and past experience can get you in the vicinity of the correct time, but there’s no substitute for checking the particular piece. This can be done by measuring the internal temperature with a reliable thermometer, peering into a small incision to see whether the interior is still translucent or already opaque, pulling on a small bone to see whether the connective tissue has dissolved enough to release it, or pushing a small skewer or toothpick into the flesh to see whether it encounters resistance from coagulated muscle fibers.
Why Careful Cooking Sometimes Makes Fish Mushy Slow and gentle heating has an important place in meat cooking, and some fish — Atlantic salmon, for example — can develop an almost custard-like texture if heated gently to 120ºF /50ºC. In fish cooking, however, slow cooking can sometimes produce an unpleasant, mushy texture. This is caused by protein-digesting enzymes in the muscle cells of active fish and shellfish that help convert muscle mass into energy (p. 189). Some of these enzymes become increasingly active as the temperature rises during cooking, until they’re inactivated at 130–140ºF/55–60ºC. Mush-prone fish (see box, p. 212) are best either cooked quickly to an enzyme-killing but somewhat drying 160ºF/70ºC, or else cooked to a lower temperature and served immediately."|"On Food and Cooking"|"Harold McGee"

Abalone meat can be quite tough, in part because they apparently accumulate connective-tissue collagen as an energy reserve! Either very gentle or prolonged heating is essential; the meat toughens badly when it exceeds 120ºF/50ºC, and the collagen shrinks and compacts the tissue. Once this happens, continued simmering will eventually dissolve the collagen into gelatin and make the meat densely silken. Japanese cooks simmer abalone for several hours to obtain a more savory flavor (free amino acids apparently react to form taste-active peptides)."|"On Food and Cooking"|"Harold McGee"

Browning can be minimized by heating the juice rapidly to the boil to inactivate the browning enzymes, but of course this lends a cooked flavor to the juice. Pasteurized apple juice was first manufactured around 1900 in Switzerland, and is now one of the most important commercial fruit products in the United States.

The initial proportion of coffee to water is 1:15 for American, 1:5 for espresso. One clear lesson from the chart is that it’s always best to use too much coffee rather than too little: a strong but balanced cup can be diluted with hot water and remain balanced, but a weak cup can’t be improved. This principle can help avoid problems caused by the fact that cup and coffee scoop measures vary, and that scoops themselves are a very approximate measure (one 2-tablespoon/30-ml scoop may deliver anywhere from 8 to 12 gm coffee, depending on grind and packing)."|"On Food and Cooking"|"Harold McGee"

Of Traditional Breads
Twentieth-Century Industrialization The 20th century brought two broad trends to Europe and North America. One was a decline in the per capita consumption of plain bread. As incomes rose, people could afford to eat more meat and more high-sugar, high-fat cakes and pastries. So we now lean less heavily than did our ancestors on the staff of life. The other trend was the industrialization of bread making. Today very little bread is made in the home, and with the exception of countries with a strong tradition of buying fresh bread every day — especially France, Germany, and Italy — most bread is made in large central factories, not in small local bakeries. Mechanical aids to breadmaking, powered mixers and others, began to appear around 1900, and culminated in the 1960s in largely automated factories that produce bread in a fraction of the usual time. These manufacturing systems replace biological dough development, the gradual, hours-long leavening and gluten strengthening of the dough by yeast, with nearly instantaneous, mechanical and chemical dough development. This production method produces breads with a soft, cake-like interior, an uncrusty crust, and an uncharacteristic flavor. They are formulated to remain soft and edible in plastic bags for a week or more. Industrial breads bear little resemblance to traditional breads."|"On Food and Cooking"|"Harold McGee"
"ap 07:00"|700|"Traditional Bread Ovens Until the middle of the 19th century, bread was baked in clay, stone, or brick ovens that were preheated by a wood fire, and that could store a large amount of heat energy. The baker started the fire on the floor of the oven, let it burn for hours, cleaned out the ashes, and then introduced the loaves of dough and closed the oven door. The oven surfaces start out at 700–900ºF/350–450ºC, the domed roof radiating its stored heat from above, the floor conducting heat directly into the loaves from beneath. As the dough heats it releases steam, which fills the closed chamber and further speeds the transfer of heat to the loaves. Slowly the oven surfaces lose their heat, and the temperature declines during the bake, at the same time that the loaf is browning and therefore becoming more efficient at absorbing heat. The result is a rapid initial heating that encourages the dough to expand, and temperatures high enough to dry the crust well and generate the color and flavors of the browning reactions (p. 778)."|"On Food and Cooking"|"Harold McGee"

The dough is rested for at least an hour after the final turn, and then is rolled out for baking to a thickness of about a quarter of an inch/6 mm. This means that each layer in the dough is microscopically thin, around a thousandth of an inch or a hundredth of a millimeter. This is much thinner than paper thin, about the diameter of an individual starch granule. The dough must be cut with a very sharp knife; a dull blade will press the many layers together at the edge and restrain their expansion. When puff pastry is baked in a very hot oven, the expanding air and water vapor puff the separate layers apart from each other and cause the volume to increase by four or more times."|"On Food and Cooking"|"Harold McGee"

Glace has a thick, syrupy, sticky consistency thanks to its high gelatin content, about 25%, an intensely savory taste thanks to the concentrated amino acids, and a rounded, mellow, but somewhat flat aroma thanks to the long hours during which volatile molecules have been boiled off or reacted with each other. Meat glace is used in small quantities to lend flavor and body to sauces. Intermediate between stock and glace is demi-glace or “half-glace,” which is stock simmered down to 25–40% of its original volume, often with some tomato puree or paste to add flavor and color, and with some flour or starch to supplement its lower gelatin content (10–15%). The tomato particles and flour gluten proteins cloud the stock and are removed by skimming the stock as it reduces, and then by a final straining. The starch in demi-glace, around 3–5% of its final weight, is largely an economy measure — it gives a greater thickness with less stock reduction and loss of volume to evaporation — but it also has the advantage of sparing some of the stock’s flavor from being boiled off, and avoiding the sticky consistency of very concentrated gelatin."|"On Food and Cooking"|"Harold McGee"

Absinthe was hugely popular in late 19th-century France, and l’heure verte, “the green hour” of the afternoon when people dripped water through a sugar cube into the absinthe and caused it to cloud up, was depicted by a number of Impressionist painters and by the young Picasso. Absinthe developed a reputation for inducing convulsions and insanity, and was therefore outlawed in many countries around 1910, and replaced by simpler anise-flavored spirits.
