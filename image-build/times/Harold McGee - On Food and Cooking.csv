Country people could enjoy good fresh milk, but in the cities, with confined cattle fed inadequately on spent brewers’ grain, most people saw only watered-down, adulterated, contaminated milk hauled in open containers through the streets. Tainted milk was a major cause of child mortality in early Victorian times."|"On Food and Cooking"|"Harold McGee"

Hard-cooking is sometimes prolonged for hours to heighten color and flavor (p. 89). Chinese tea eggs, for example, are simmered until set, then gently cracked, and simmered for another hour or two in a mixture of tea, salt, sugar, and flavorings to produce a marbled, aromatic, very firm white."|"On Food and Cooking"|"Harold McGee"
12:00|midday|"Long-Cooked Eggs An intriguing alternative to the standard hard-cooked egg is the Middle Eastern hamindas (Hebrew) or beid hamine (Arabic), which are cooked for anywhere from 6 to 18 hours. They derive from the Sephardic Sabbath mixed stew (called hamin, from the Hebrew for “hot”), which was put together on Friday, cooked slowly in the oven overnight, and served as a midday Sabbath meal. Eggs included in the stew shell and all, or alternatively long-simmered in water, come out with a stronger flavor and a striking, tan-colored white. During prolonged heating in alkaline conditions, the quarter-gram of glucose sugar in the white reacts with albumen protein to generate flavors and pigments typical of browned foods (see the explanation of the Maillard reaction on p. 778). The white will be very tender and the yolk creamy if the cooking temperature is kept in a very narrow range, between 160 and 165ºF/71–74ºC."|"On Food and Cooking"|"Harold McGee"

A given weight of egg whites can’t dissolve more than about double that weight in sugar. Yet royal icing, a traditional decorative material in pastry work, is made by whipping a 4 to 1 mixture of powdered sugar and egg white for 10 or 15 minutes. Royal icing is not a simple foam — it’s a combination of a very dense foam and a paste.

"ap ~ 23:51"|"around 9 to 12"|"Creating Clarity, Color, and Flavor The real transforming agent in pidan is the alkaline material, which gradually raises the already alkaline egg from a pH of around 9 to 12 or more. This chemical stress causes what might be thought of as an inorganic version of fermentation: that is, it denatures the egg proteins, and breaks down some of the complex, flavorless proteins and fats into simpler, highly flavorful components. The disruptively high pH forces the egg proteins to unfold, and at the same time confers on them a strongly repelling negative charge. The dissolved salt, with its positive and negative ions, moderates the repulsion enough that the fine strands of widely dispersed albumen proteins are able to bond into a solid yet transparent gel. In the yolk, the same extreme conditions destroy the organized structure of the yolk spheres, and with it the usual graininess; the yolk proteins coagulate into a creamy mass. The extreme alkalinity also browns the albumen by accelerating the reaction between the proteins and the trace of glucose (see p. 89), and it greens the yolk by encouraging the formation of ferrous sulfide throughout the yolk, not just at its surface (as in hard-cooked eggs; see p. 89). Finally, the alkalinity intensifies the egg’s flavor by breaking down both proteins and phospholipids into hydrogen sulfide, distinctly animal fatty acids, and pungent ammonia (the fumes from a freshly opened egg will turn litmus paper blue)."|"On Food and Cooking"|"Harold McGee"
"~ 02:00"|"about 2.5 hours"|"Rigor Mortis
The Importance of Timing, Posture, and Temperature For a brief period after the animal’s death its muscles are relaxed, and if immediately cut and cooked will make especially tender meat. Soon, however, the muscles clench in the condition called rigor mortis (“stiffness of death”). If cooked in this state, they make very tough meat. Rigor sets in (after about 2.5 hours in the steer, 1 hour or less in lamb, pork, and chicken) when the muscle fibers run out of energy, their control systems fail and trigger a contracting movement of the protein filaments, and the filaments lock in place. Carcasses are hung up in such a way that most of their muscles are stretched by gravity, so that the protein filaments can’t contract and overlap very much; otherwise the filaments bunch up and bond very tightly and the meat becomes exceptionally tough. Eventually, protein-digesting enzymes within the muscle fibers begin to eat away the framework that holds the actin and myosin filaments in place. The filaments are still locked together, and the muscles cannot be stretched, but the overall muscle structure weakens, and the meat texture softens. This is the beginning of the aging process. It becomes noticeable after about a day in beef, after several hours in pork and chicken."|"On Food and Cooking"|"Harold McGee"

Oven “Roasting”
In contrast to the grill, the oven is an indirect and more uniform means of cooking. The primary heat source, whether flame, coil, or coal, heats the oven, and the oven then heats the food from all sides, by means of convection currents of hot air and infrared radiation from the oven walls (p. 784). Oven heating is a relatively slow method, well suited to large cuts of meat that take time to heat through. Its efficiency is especially influenced by the cooking temperature, which can be anything from 200 up to 500ºF/95–260ºC and above. Cooking times range from 60 to 10 (or fewer) minutes per pound/500 gm."|"On Food and Cooking"|"Harold McGee"

They’re arrayed in multiple layers, and greatly reinforced with strengthening and toughening connective-tissue collagen, some three to five times more than fish muscle has. Unlike the fragile collagen of fish, squid and octopus collagen is extensively cross-linked and behaves more like the collagen of meat animals."|"On Food and Cooking"|"Harold McGee"
"~ 19:00"|"around 1900"|"Apple Juice and Cider Apple juice can be either opalescent or clear depending on whether its pectins and proteins are left intact to deflect light rays. Made fresh, it will stay pale and retain its fresh flavor for about an hour, after which the darkening and aroma-modifying influences of enzymes and oxygen become evident. Browning can be minimized by heating the juice rapidly to the boil to inactivate the browning enzymes, but of course this lends a cooked flavor to the juice. Pasteurized apple juice was first manufactured around 1900 in Switzerland, and is now one of the most important commercial fruit products in the United States. Cider is still an important product in northwest Spain, western France, and England, where the traditional method was to let the fruit pulp ferment slowly through the cold winter, reaching an alcohol content around 4%."|"On Food and Cooking"|"Harold McGee"

And because they’re so delicate, the stigmas are still harvested and separated from the other flower parts by hand, with nearly 200 hours of labor required for that same 1 pound of dried saffron. Each purple-petaled flower must be harvested on the same day that it begins to open, in late autumn. Once separated, the stigmas are carefully dried, either with a 30-minute toasting over a fire (Spain), or longer times in the sun (Iran), or in a warm room or modern oven."|"On Food and Cooking"|"Harold McGee"

Most of them extract between 20 and 25% of the bean’s substance, and produce a cup containing somewhere between 1.3% and5.5% bean solids by weight. The facing chart places some of the major styles in relation to each other. Standard American filter-drip coffee is the lightest, and Italian espresso the strongest. The initial proportion of coffee to water is 1:15 for American, 1:5 for espresso. One clear lesson from the chart is that it’s always best to use too much coffee rather than too little: a strong but balanced cup can be diluted with hot water and remain balanced, but a weak cup can’t be improved. This principle can help avoid problems caused by the fact that cup and coffee scoop measures vary, and that scoops themselves are a very approximate measure (one 2-tablespoon/30-ml scoop may deliver anywhere from 8 to 12 gm coffee, depending on grind and packing)."|"On Food and Cooking"|"Harold McGee"

At around four months, the nut fills with liquid; at five, it reaches its full size and begins to develop a jelly-like meat; at seven its shell begins to harden, and it’s mature at a year. Immature coconuts, around five to seven months old, offer their own pleasures: a sweet liquid called coconut water (about 2% sugars); and a moist, delicate, gelatinous meat that’s mainly water, sugars and other carbohydrates. In the mature coconut of 11–12 months, the liquid has become less sweet and less abundant, and the meat has become firm, fatty, and white.

"~ 19:00"|"around 1900"|"The Decline and Revival
Of Traditional Breads
Twentieth-Century Industrialization The 20th century brought two broad trends to Europe and North America. One was a decline in the per capita consumption of plain bread. As incomes rose, people could afford to eat more meat and more high-sugar, high-fat cakes and pastries. So we now lean less heavily than did our ancestors on the staff of life. The other trend was the industrialization of bread making. Today very little bread is made in the home, and with the exception of countries with a strong tradition of buying fresh bread every day — especially France, Germany, and Italy — most bread is made in large central factories, not in small local bakeries. Mechanical aids to breadmaking, powered mixers and others, began to appear around 1900, and culminated in the 1960s in largely automated factories that produce bread in a fraction of the usual time. These manufacturing systems replace biological dough development, the gradual, hours-long leavening and gluten strengthening of the dough by yeast, with nearly instantaneous, mechanical and chemical dough development. This production method produces breads with a soft, cake-like interior, an uncrusty crust, and an uncharacteristic flavor. They are formulated to remain soft and edible in plastic bags for a week or more. Industrial breads bear little resemblance to traditional breads."|"On Food and Cooking"|"Harold McGee"
00:15|0.15|"Making Durum Pasta Dough and Shapes Durum pasta is made from semolina, which is milled durum endosperm with a characteristically coarse particle size, 0.15–0.5 mm across, thanks to the hard nature of durum endosperm (finer grinding causes excessive damage to starch granules). Flat pasta shapes are punched from out of a sheet of dough. Long noodles and short thick ones are formed by extruding the dough through the holes of a die at high pressure. The movement, pressure, and heat of extrusion change the structure of the dough by shearing the protein network apart, mixing it more intimately with starch granules that have been partly gelated by the heat and pressure, and allowing broken protein bonds to re-form and stabilize the new network. Noodles extruded through modern low-friction Teflon dies end up with a glossier, smoother surface, with fewer pores and cracks through which hot water can leak in and dissolved starch can leak out. They generally lose less starch to the cooking water, absorb less cooking water, and therefore have a firmer texture than the same noodle extruded through a traditional bronze die. Proponents of traditional dies prefer the rougher surface, which they say better retains the sauce in the finished dish."|"On Food and Cooking"|"Harold McGee"

In soft panning, most often applied to jellybeans, the jelly candy is rolled around in a cool pan with a glucose syrup and powdered sugar.

The most notorious herbal alcohol is absinthe, a green-tinged, anise-flavored liqueur whose main ingredient is parts of the wormwood plant, Artemisia absinthium. Wormwood has a harsh, bitter flavor and carries an aromatic compound, thujone, that in high doses is toxic not only to intestinal parasites and insects — hence the plant’s name — but also to the human nervous system, muscles, and kidneys. Absinthe was hugely popular in late 19th-century France, and l’heure verte, “the green hour” of the afternoon when people dripped water through a sugar cube into the absinthe and caused it to cloud up, was depicted by a number of Impressionist painters and by the young Picasso. Absinthe developed a reputation for inducing convulsions and insanity, and was therefore outlawed in many countries around 1910, and replaced by simpler anise-flavored spirits. Whatever toxicity wormwood had for the heavy drinker was probably exacerbated by absinthe’s high alcohol content, around 68% and nearly double the strength of most spirits. Absinthe remains legal in a number of countries and has recently enjoyed a modest and moderate revival."|"On Food and Cooking"|"Harold McGee"
