 We’re all safe and sound in Lima — not too bad a trip, although we’re a little grubby by now. We’re waiting out a slight (I hope) delay on the Iquitos leg. You wouldn’t believe it if I told you the reason. It’s six A.M. here — nine in Cabo, I guess — and I just tried calling you, but you weren’t in the room. Probably at the spa getting your nodes uncrystallized. Don’t overdo it now. I really admire your nodes the way they are.

 Nothing else to say, really — I just wanted an excuse to “talk” to you. I love you and I’m already missing you, and I’ll see you next week. Have a great time, honey.

10:00|"ten A.M."|"IT took a couple of hours, but the artillery blasts did the job. The vultures flew away, the flight loaded up and left, and by ten A.M. — about the time the attendants were handing out welcome trays of warm, tasty ham-and-cheese sandwiches, orange juice, more bad coffee, and rum cake — the plane had left the coastal plain behind, had cleared the craggy, snowy peaks of the Andes, and was beginning its long descent to the Amazon Basin and Iquitos. Gideon pressed his face to the window."|"Little Tiny Teeth"|"Aaron Elkins"
12:00|midday|"The liveliness and bustle of the city came as a surprise. Gideon had known that it was the second largest settlement on the Amazon, with a population of over a quarter million, but all the same he’d anticipated a languid, heat-frazzled sort of place, where nobody moved very fast and everybody got out of the sun at midday. Instead, careening down Calle Próspero toward their hotel, he found a tacky, colorful, hard-working town that was anything but languid. There were block after block of surplus stores, off-brand clothing shops, luggage stores, check-cashing services, hole-in-the-wall restaurants, and tobacco and liquor stores, most of them with bars on their windows but their doors wide open. Many of the merchants seemed to be out on the street arguing or chatting with passersby. If not for the absence of anything taller than three stories, he might have been on Canal Street in lower Manhattan."|"Little Tiny Teeth"|"Aaron Elkins"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"“This is the Plaza de Armas, the main square,” Phil told them after they’d pulled their luggage down from the racks at the backs of the taxis, “and that monstrosity is your hotel, the Dorado Plaza. Go freshen up, take a nap or something, and I’ll meet you right out here at, say, four o’clock, after things have cooled down. I’ll give you a quickie tour. I’d go inside with you in case there’s any problem at the desk, but they’d never let me through the door.”"|"Little Tiny Teeth"|"Aaron Elkins"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"PHIL was right about the afternoon heat. Even at four o’clock, supposedly after things had “cooled down,” the thermometer in the lobby of the Dorado Plaza read thirty-seven degrees centigrade. Approximately ninety-nine degrees Fahrenheit. And the relative humidity was even higher, according to the humidity sensor: 100 percent. The air couldn’t hold any more moisture if it tried."|"Little Tiny Teeth"|"Aaron Elkins"
"ap 05:30"|five-thirty|"By five-thirty even John was drooping from the heat, and they were all ready for a cold beer and something to eat. Gideon suggested the Gran Maloca, a nice-looking restaurant they’d passed, with white-shirted waiters visible through the windows and Visa, Master-Card, and aire acondicionado stickers on the door. But he was outvoted, as he knew he would be, by Phil and John, who opted for the open-air Aris Burgers; John because of the word burgers and Phil because it was where the motokar drivers and other “real” people ate."|"Little Tiny Teeth"|"Aaron Elkins"
"ap 06:30"|six-thirty|"He hurried on before Scofield could pursue the matter. The Adelita, the group was told, would provide them with many amenities. Their cabins would be cleaned each day, their linens replaced two times during the week. A fresh liter of drinking water would be placed in their rooms every morning. There would be three healthful meals a day, the precise timing to depend on the day’s excursions. Today’s dinner would be at six-thirty. Coffee, fruit, and more drinking water would be available twenty-four hours a day on the buffet table in the dining room. The bar would open for an hour before dinner each day, and drinks could be signed for and accounts settled at the end of the cruise."|"Little Tiny Teeth"|"Aaron Elkins"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"“Well, Arden” — Gideon saw Scofield’s jaw muscles stiffen — “let me let you in on something. Last time I knew what day it was, or even gave a shit, was probably about 1992. And I don’t wear a watch, so don’t talk to me about Tuesday at nine o’clock, man. And I got news for you. The curanderos don’t wear wristwatches either, so Tuesday at nine don’t mean anything to them either. When it’s time to go, I’ll come get you. Let me worry about it, okay? I mean, it’s not exactly like you’re going to be hard to find, is it?”"|"Little Tiny Teeth"|"Aaron Elkins"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"Gideon smiled. “I’ll admit, you’re not having much of a day so far.”
“And it’s not even six o’clock yet,” Maggie dryly observed.
“Say, Doc?” John had opened the dining room door. “Could you come on out when you have a minute?”"|"Little Tiny Teeth"|"Aaron Elkins"
12:00|midday|"After breakfast, the Adelita moored at a narrow beach topped by a thirty-foot bluff. Cisco scrambled up it and went to see about arranging a meeting with the shaman of an Ocaona settlement about two miles to the northwest, on the banks of the Punte, another of the Amazon’s hundreds of tributaries. He returned two hours later with the news that the celebrated curandero Yaminahua would be pleased to grant them an audience. He — Cisco — suggested that they each bring along at least a liter of water. For people who weren’t used to it, a four-mile round-trip jungle hike in the midday heat was going to make for a long, exhausting day."|"Little Tiny Teeth"|"Aaron Elkins"
"ap ~ 09:00"|"about nine"|"Maggie was the last to come upstairs. For the first few hours after dinner, she had been in the lower deck salon, working with a portable plant dryer that she’d set up there, processing the considerable haul of medicinal, toxic, and hallucinogenic plants that she’d collected during the hike. But at about nine, she had come up and, somewhat to Gideon’s surprise, had set down her chair next to Tim’s and Cisco’s. He could hear the three of them comparing observations on the various exotic botanicals they had encountered. Beyond them, Scofield, who, much to Gideon’s envy, had discovered an ancient, full-length, folding beach chair somewhere, lay quietly, with a pot of tea on the deck beside him. His choice of a spot at the very rear, between the guy wires that supported the smokestack and well away from the others, had made it clear that he preferred to be left alone, and he was left alone. For a while the smell of his too-sweet tobacco hung in the air but now he was sound asleep, his pipe having fallen from his hand some time before. An occasional soft, snuffling snore could be heard."|"Little Tiny Teeth"|"Aaron Elkins"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"“Right, whatever. Well, this stuff has something in it, I can tell you that. I had some after-dinner sessions with him at his house a couple of times while we were working on the book. And both times, come eight o’clock or so, he gets all wiggly and jumpy and then makes himself this tea — it’s supposed to be for some stomach problem or something, yada yada yada—”"|"Little Tiny Teeth"|"Aaron Elkins"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"“Well, all I know is, both times the guy’s completely out of it inside an hour. I had to let myself out. Once I came back the next morning at nine, and he shows up on the doorstep in the same clothes, all sleepy and dopey, with his hair all mussed and all. I mean, obviously, he’d been spaced out the whole time, probably never got out of his damn chair.”"|"Little Tiny Teeth"|"Aaron Elkins"
"> 16:00"|"a little after four in the afternoon"|"An hour earlier, at a little after four in the afternoon, after cruising most of the day, he had swung the Adelita north, leaving the broad, safe, familiar expanse of the Amazon for the narrower, endlessly winding, more oppressive Javaro River. He had quickly pulled into a narrow inlet to let off Cisco and one of the kitchen crew, the Yagua Indian Porge, neither of whom had papers that would pass inspection at the border. They would run up ahead through the jungle, and once the Adelita was safely past the checkpoint (by the grace of God) and out of sight, the boat’s dinghy would pick them up."|"Little Tiny Teeth"|"Aaron Elkins"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"At nine o’clock he slid open his window to let in the river’s night breeze — after dark, it made things cooler than the air-conditioner did — and went to bed, hoping that a long night’s sleep would pep him up. It had been a mistake not to bring any work with him. The idea had been that this was to be a genuine vacation for a change, an opportunity to relax in an interesting locale with nothing pressing on his mind to interfere with the enjoyment of the experience. It had worked for a little while, but now he had gotten fidgety. How many days were left? Two? It seemed like a long time still to go."|"Little Tiny Teeth"|"Aaron Elkins"
"ap 01:45"|1:45|"It was the stifled, piercing cry — “Ai!” — that broke through to his webbed, sleeping mind, but even as he swam unwillingly to the surface, he thought he remembered that it had been preceded by some kind of distant thumping or scraping. (He’d incorporated it into a nonsensical dream, something to do with a dying horse trying to stomp its way into its locked stall.) With his head still on the pillow, he looked at the softly glowing dial of his watch: 1:45. It was perfectly quiet now, with no sound but the hissing of the water along the side of the ship below his cabin window. Had there really been a cry, or had he been — The hollow, ponderous pa-loosh of something substantial plunging into the river dissolved the last shreds of sleep."|"Little Tiny Teeth"|"Aaron Elkins"

It was two-thirty in the morning, still pitch-black. Everybody but Scofield, who had been observed to have had a couple of pots of his “digestive” tea up on the roof earlier that night, was there now, gathered around her at their table in the dining room. They were all in walking shorts and polo shirts or tank tops, the established daily uniform of choice. Vargas had made “fresh” coffee by opening a new jar of Nescafé."|"Little Tiny Teeth"|"Aaron Elkins"
"ap 04:30"|four-thirty|"Phil, John, and Gideon were sitting in a nook at the rear of the upper deck, aft of the cabins. It was four-thirty and the first pale pink smears of the day were just beginning to show up ahead on the eastern horizon, although high in the sky, a single, torn shred of cloud was lit a flaming orange. The meeting in the dining room had broken up half an hour earlier, and the three had come up here to talk things over on their own."|"Little Tiny Teeth"|"Aaron Elkins"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"“Well, the thing with Cisco happened at two in the morning, right? What was he doing, if he wasn’t sleeping?”"|"Little Tiny Teeth"|"Aaron Elkins"
"ap ~ 05:00"|"about five o’clock"|"“I didn’t think to ask,” Phil said, and then after a moment, with some irritation: “Why would I ask that? Jeez. Anyway, they told me they’d been fishing for dorado from the bank about five o’clock yesterday afternoon when they smelled smoke. And when they climbed back up to the warehouse, they found this guy in the doorway, right in the act of setting a match to a pile of newspapers and scrap wood. A couple of other piles were already burning inside, on the wooden floor.”"|"Little Tiny Teeth"|"Aaron Elkins"
"< 02:00"|"almost two this morning"|"John looked at them with a puzzled frown. “Yeah, sure, well, that’s all great stuff, Doc, but how could it be Cisco? It can’t be.

He didn’t jump off till almost two this morning.”"|"Little Tiny Teeth"|"Aaron Elkins"
15:00|"three in the afternoon"|"“Nah, Doc, you’re not thinking,” John said. “That hike in the jungle broiled your brains a little. Now look: when Cisco called off yesterday’s trek and disappeared on us, it was maybe three in the afternoon, right?”"|"Little Tiny Teeth"|"Aaron Elkins"
"ap ~ 05:00"|"around five o’clock"|"“And the fire here at the warehouse happened around five o’clock, two hours later.”"|"Little Tiny Teeth"|"Aaron Elkins"

"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"“What time is it? It’s seven o’clock. What difference does it make what time it is?” He was brimming with impatience and enthusiasm. “Come on, you’ve been snoozing for an hour. Open your eyes, wake up — I got something to show you.
