"ap ~ 07:00"|"around seven o’clock"|"Lorraine and I went to school the following day, and we didn’t get over to the Pigman’s until that night around seven o’clock. That was because when we were heading over there at three thirty, we ran into Dennis and Norton who wanted to know where we were going. We made believe we weren’t going anywhere, so we had to go to the cemetery to have a beer with them. We drink at a special part of the cemetery called Masterson’s Tomb. That’s where all the famous Mastersons are buried, you know. It’s a fantastic place because they have acres and acres all for their own tomb, and it’s fenced in with a private road which they only open up when one of the Mastersons dies. But there is a hole in the fence at one place in the woods, and that’s where all the kids go through."|"The Pigman"|"Paul Zindel"

00:00|midnight|"I think cemeteries are one of the loveliest places to be—if you’re not dead, of course. The hills and green grass and flowers are much nicer than what you get when you’re alive. Sometimes we go there at midnight and hide behind stones to scare the @#$% out of each other."|"The Pigman"|"Paul Zindel"
11:30|"eleven thirty that morning"|"I got most of the work done in plenty of time for John and me to meet the Pigman down at the Staten Island ferryhouse by eleven thirty that morning. Mr. Pignati said he’d meet us there after he had stopped at the zoo to feed Bobo, which was fine with John. He loves to wait for people in the ferryhouse because all the bums and drunks come over. He really drives them crazy. They’ve got drunks and bums all over the Staten Island ferryhouse, but not half as many as they’ve got on the other side at South Ferry. John makes them tell their whole life story before he’ll give them a nickel."|"The Pigman"|"Paul Zindel"
"ap 11:45"|"eleven forty-five"|"The Pigman got there in time for us to get the eleven forty-five boat to Manhattan. I just had to go along on this trip to Beekman’s Department Store because John has absolutely no control over himself. If I had let him and Mr. Pignati go alone, John would have charged half the store. He wouldn’t have done it to be mean. He just isn’t used to people giving him stuff, and that’s what Mr. Pignati wanted to do."|"The Pigman"|"Paul Zindel"
"ap ~ 08:00"|"around eight o’clock"|"So things were really going along fine until one Sunday night in January when there was a snowstorm—and the Pigman had been to the zoo. John and I got over to the house around eight o’clock and were all set to watch a television show when we noticed Mr. Pignati was sad as all get out. I don’t even want to tell you this part, but one of us has to. It’s very depressing; it really is."|"The Pigman"|"Paul Zindel"
"~ 08:45"|"around eight forty-five in the morning"|"On Friday we cut school since that was the last day before Mr. Pignati was due home. We got to the house around eight forty-five in the morning, and I went right into the kitchen and started making breakfast. John wanted scrambled eggs with Sloppy-Joe sauce, and that’s what he got. I just had scrambled eggs with pizza-flavored catsup. I burned the toast a little, and that was the first of a long list of complaints from Mr. John Conlan."|"The Pigman"|"Paul Zindel"
"ap ~ 07:30"|"around seven thirty"|"Dennis came over first around seven thirty because I told him to steal a bottle of 80 proofer out of his father’s whiskey cabinet. His father’s a building inspector, and everybody who doesn’t want to be inspected too much slips him a bottle and a few bucks each month. Dennis also brought some soda mixers and two dozen glasses he got from his mother by telling her I was having a birthday party and they were needed for the lemonade."|"The Pigman"|"Paul Zindel"
"ap 07:30"|"seven thirty"|"At seven thirty Deanna Deas arrived with her best girl friend Helen Kazinski. The two of them together are known as Beauty and the Beast. Helen is so fat you need a shoehorn to get her in the door. Then a few others arrived: Jane Appling, Rocky Romano, Nick Cahill, James Moon, Marlon Brewery, Josephine Adamo, Tony Remeo, Bernie Iatoni, Barney Friman, and Janice Dickery. They were a real nice bunch, but each one of them had a problem all his own. For instance, Jane Appling is six feet two inches tall."|"The Pigman"|"Paul Zindel"
"ap ~ 10:30"|"about ten thirty"|"I waited until about ten thirty before I put my roller skates on and came tearing onto the dance floor. Melissa Dumas dug Lorraine’s pair out of the closet, and she and I did this dance you wouldn’t believe."|"The Pigman"|"Paul Zindel"
"ap ~ 11:00"|"about eleven o’clock"|"John gave the one-ring signal about eleven o’clock, which was much earlier than I had expected because I thought he’d still be unconscious. We met at the corner. He looked very disheartened."|"The Pigman"|"Paul Zindel"
"ap ~ 01:00"|"around one o’clock"|"“Lorraine and I want to know if you’d like to go to the zoo this afternoon. We thought we could meet you around one o’clock near the entrance. You know, right by the sea lions?”"|"The Pigman"|"Paul Zindel"
"ap ~ 00:30"|"around twelve thirty"|"We got to the zoo around twelve thirty, and I didn’t think the Pigman was going to show. I really didn’t. We sat on the same bench as we had last time, the one near the front gate that lets you watch the sea lions. I had my Ben Franklin sunglasses on again, and it wasn’t even sunny out, but I figured they’d be good because I wouldn’t have to look right into anyone’s eyes. One of the attendants was washing the sea-lion manure off the middle platform of the pool, and at least he was able to do that with a certain degree of proficiency. When it came to feeding them he had no imagination, but that particular task he was up to."|"The Pigman"|"Paul Zindel"

"> 18:00"|"after six P.M."|"But then we made up a new game in which the object was to keep a stranger talking on the phone as long as possible. At least twice a week we’d meet for a telephone marathon. Wednesday afternoons we’d have it at Dennis’ house because his mother goes shopping at the supermarket and his father doesn’t get home from work until after six P.M., even when he’s sober. And on Sundays we’d do it at Norton’s because his father plays golf and his mother is so retarded she doesn’t know what’s coming off anyway, but at least they didn’t mind if their kids used the house. Mine and Lorraine’s we can’t even go to. We couldn’t use the phone at Lorraine’s anyway because her mother doesn’t have unlimited service, and at my house my mother is a disinfectant fanatic. She would have gotten too nervous over all of us using her purified instrument. Another difficulty there is that my father, whom I warmly refer to as Bore, put a lock on our phone—one of those round locks you put in the first dialhole so you can’t dial. He put it on because of a little exchange we had when he called from work."|"The Pigman"|"Paul Zindel"
"ap 02:26"|"two hours and twenty-six minutes"|"The longest anyone ever lasted was Dennis, because he picked out this old woman who lived alone and was desperate to talk to anyone. Dennis is really not very bright. In fact, he talks so slowly some people think he has brain damage. But he told this woman he had called her number because he had heard she gave good advice and his problem was that he was about to die from a hideous skin disease because a rat had bitten off his nose when he was a baby and the skin grafts didn’t take. He kept her on the phone for two hours and twenty-six minutes. That was the record!"|"The Pigman"|"Paul Zindel"
"ap > 06:30"|"after six thirty"|"I didn’t get home that night until after six thirty, and I was a little scared when I found my mother there. She’s a private nurse and was supposed to be working a four-to-twelve shift that night. I never have to worry about finding my father there because he left fifteen years ago when they got a legal separation, and then he died six years ago, which made it a more permanent separation. As it is, my mother’s enough to worry about."|"The Pigman"|"Paul Zindel"
10:00|"ten o’clock in the morning"|"John had called the Pigman and made arrangements for us to meet him in front of the zoo at ten o’clock in the morning. We didn’t want to be seen walking around our neighborhood with him, but the zoo was far enough away so we knew we’d be safe once we got there."|"The Pigman"|"Paul Zindel"
"ap ~ 09:30"|"around nine thirty"|"John and I arrived around nine thirty and sat down on the benches at the entrance. The sea-lion pool is right there, and that kept John busy while I was combing my hair and polishing my Ben Franklin sunglasses. I don’t wear all crazy clothes, but I do like my Ben Franklin sunglasses because everyone looks at me when I wear them. I used to be afraid to have people look at me, but ever since I met John I seem to wear little things that make them look. He wears phony noses and moustaches and things like that. He’s even got a big pin that says “MY, YOU’RE UGLY,” and he wears that once in awhile."|"The Pigman"|"Paul Zindel"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"If my mother had ever let me have a dog, I think it would have been the happiest dog on earth. I know just how the minds of animals work—just the kind of games they like to play. The closest I ever came to having a pet was an old mongrel that used to hang around the neighborhood. I thought there was nothing wrong with sitting on the front steps and petting him, but my mother called the ASPCA, and I know they killed him.
At ten o’clock sharp, Mr. Pignati arrived.
“Hi!” he said. His smile stretched clear across his face. “Hope I’m not late?”"|"The Pigman"|"Paul Zindel"
