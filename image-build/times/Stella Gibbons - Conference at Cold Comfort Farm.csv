"> 16:00"|"just after four o’clock that afternoon"|"So just after four o’clock that afternoon Flora rang the bell of 1, Mouse Place. It had not suffered in Recent Events, but it had been shut up with Sneller as caretaker while Mrs Smiling was in the United States, and Flora had not seen it for many years. However, Mrs Smiling had friends in high and low places, and she had contrived to get the house painted. It looked fresh and elegant in the summer sunlight, and there were Sweet Williams in the metal baskets hanging from its balcony."|"Conference at Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"

I’ve got a Committee at five, I’m seeing my dentist at six (he makes an exception for me, dear man), and then down to the House. You two girls are jolly lucky,’ she added with sinister jocularity as she bustled past Sneller, who was attempting to show her out, and nearly sent him flying, ‘if your grading permits you to sit here chin-wagging! You’ – pointing a finger in a dirty glove at Flora – ‘get off on the score of having children under fourteen, I presume, but how about you’ – transferring the finger to Mrs Smiling. ‘Delicate health? Aged parents?’"|"Conference at Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"Mr Mybug seemed to want to go on talking about The Dromedary, but Flora ended their conversation by making a brief and definite arrangement to meet his train outside Beershorn Station at four o’clock on the afternoon of the following Sunday, June 16th, and rang off."|"Conference at Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"
"ap 08:30"|"half-past eight"|"Flora regretfully explained that her evening duties kept her at Cold Comfort until after dinner, but it was arranged that she should go to drink coffee at Haute-Couture Hall at half-past eight on the following evening, and Elfine then apologized that she must ride home at once to take tea with the daughters, Naomi, Rachel and Esther. (‘Jews never call their young by those adorable soft Bible names, do they?’ she observed, ‘and someone has to.’)"|"Conference at Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"On the next day, which was Tuesday, the one-day Exhibition of Transitorist Art was to be held, and throughout the morning Maser Messe slaved in a fury of creation behind locked doors, staggering out covered with dough, dye and sausage-meat at one o’clock in good time for luncheon. The rest of the delegates attended a lecture, on Angst: Its Causes and Cultivation, given by the Swedish Existentialist Greetë Grümbl (lovely fair hair and dark eyes – all wasted). Flora, glancing in at the audience while passing the Greate Kitchene window, saw them all busily scribbling notes except Mr Claud Hubris, who was scribbling a cheque for a diamond bracelet."|"Conference at Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"
"ap 02:30"|"half-past two"|"Having finished reading her letters and reflected with satisfaction that all went well at the Vicarage, she put them away in her pocket and surveyed the now animated scene in the Greate Barne, which already suggested, rather than an exhibition of modern art, airing day at the Snow-White Laundry. She had completely forgotten that the Exhibition of Transitorist Art was to open at half-past two; and while she was interestedly watching the attempts of Prue and Jane to stretch an extra large tea-cloth across the front of Woman with Child (or it may have been Woman with Wind), and reflecting that their task was made no easier by the fact that both kept their eyes modestly averted, a voice cried angrily:"|"Conference at Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"
"ap > 11:00"|"after eleven o’clock"|"That evening, after supervising the delegates’ after-dinner coffee-swigging (a harsh word, but Mr Jones and Professor Farine were never content with less than six cups apiece and most of the delegates took three), Flora wrapped herself in her old cloak of viridian-green velvet and walked across the uplands to Haute-Couture Hall, where she found that all the sons and daughters had been allowed to stay up to meet her. In reminiscences and laughter, in mutual discoveries and in the relating of family news and the laying of plans for future meetings, two hours passed in one delightful flash, and it was after eleven o’clock when, having said good-night to Hereward, who had accompanied her with a posse of dogs as far as the summit of Teazeaunt Beacon, Flora began the walk down to Cold Comfort Farm."|"Conference at Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"
"ap ~ 06:00"|"about six o’clock"|"‘Yes, there will, a magnum of it. The President of the French Republic sent it over this morning.

‘In time fer eleven o’clock church!’ said Nancy raptly.
‘My own thoughts exactly.’ Flora bestowed upon her a glance of approval, suppressing the thought that if eleven o’clock saw the Starkadders filing into church next Sunday morning, the Starkadders would be changed indeed. ‘You had better go now, Nancy,’ she continued. ‘I shall expect Reuben at midnight.’"|"Conference at Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"

Flora finished her letters, embroidered a small rodent upon a garment for her youngest daughter and read one chapter of an enjoyable stodgy novel. When she shut the book and glanced at the clock, she saw that the hour wanted twenty minutes of midnight. A distant steady roar of conversation pierced by an occasional nervous scream came from the Greate Kitchene, where the delegates were assembled, but fortunately none of them came bothering into the Green Parlour (she could not learn to think of it as the Quiete Retreate), and she was peacefully gazing out through the window, open to the warm dark night, when she saw a light, low down near the ground, moving across the Big Field."|"Conference at Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"

Now, Reuben, please, if you will just unswear that Oath you took about ploughing the land with the lone hand, we will have the male members of the family back here on Sunday morning in time for eleven o’clock church.’"|"Conference at Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"

The grandfather clock struck two.
At last, with a convulsive effort, Reuben brought out the words:"|"Conference at Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"
"ap 02:30"|"half-past two"|"‘There!’ said Flora, as the clock struck half-past two. ‘I will send these off first thing to-morrow morning (this morning, that is), as soon as Howling Post Office is open,’ and she waved the sheaf of pages at Reuben. ‘Please have the buggy ready at ten minutes to eight, Reuben, to drive me down.’"|"Conference at Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"

"ap 03:45"|"quarter to four"|"This was unfortunately true.

However, her plans were maturing successfully, and with the help of that comfort she contrived to pass unruffled through a very disturbed evening. Hacke, Messe and Peccavi suddenly decided that all their works must be instantly packed up in order to leave Sussex on the following morning, as they were due to appear at an Exhibition in Europe in a week’s time. Having gobbled their dinner even faster than usual, they all rushed down to the Greate Barne, accompanied by Riska and such of the delegates as had nothing better to do, and began strewing straw, newspaper, rope and packing-cases over the floor and taking pictures down from the walls. Then they began admiring each other’s work, and then fell to arguing, and at last, about twelve o’clock, they decided to postpone the packing until the next day, and all four curled up among the litter and went to sleep. Flora, whose services had been fussily requested earlier in the evening, had to step over their recumbent forms to extinguish the lights, which they had of course left burning."|"Conference at Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"The Party went on until seven o’clock the next morning, when the last drop of drink was swallowed and the last cigarette lit, and then there were complaints (as well there might be, only they were not the complaints that a detached observer might have been expected to make in the circumstances). Fairly early in the evening Riska and Peccavi disappeared; that was one good thing; and a little later Mr Mybug went to sleep in the copper; that was another. Peccavi had been in topping form, tripping up the dancers with trick wire flown specially from Lisbon by a friend of his who smuggled drugs, and dropping tobacco ash in the fruit-cup. Mr Mybug said that his malice was deliciously, characteristically unpredictable. Mdlle Avaler looked pure and lovely as an angel in white satin and pearls, and it was shortly after her arrival that Mr Mybug sought sanctuary from Cupid’s darts in the copper, emerging at intervals to tell everyone how amusingly cosy it was in there."|"Conference at Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"

Give – Us – the – Unsplittable!’ Dance bands, relayed from all those foreign stations which sound louder after eleven o’clock, sent forth their cacophany or their briskly indelicate songs into the pandemonium, and the Starkadder maidens, who were supposed to be handing round the food and drink, fled the scene after half an hour of it."|"Conference at Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"

No one observed her, because she was seated well above the level of the bar and the buffet, which were the highest points to which anyone’s eyes were raised; and she was even turning the pages of Charlotte Yonge’s story Hopes and Fears, a copy of which had lain at the back of the mantelpiece for some years undisturbed, and wondering if she could venture to read it by the light of the lamp in its wrought-iron lantern immediately above her head, when, chancing to glance down into the gladsome throng, she met the eyes of Peccavi, enormous, black, glittering with malice.

The room was empty. Clocks were striking midnight, and she heard far off the Comus cries and shouts of the rabble. She rapidly climbed down by the projecting iron bars at the side of the mantelpiece where bunched onions had once been hung, and, clasping Hopes and Fears to her bosom, sped through rooms lit by flickering candles and failing electric light until she reached the Greate Staircasee."|"Conference at Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"

Phoebe fluttered in at four o’clock with a tray of tea, looking like a flushed and excited sheep, and Flora partook while glancing through a book of poems called Thrush-Notes that Adam had left for her that morning. It was by E. H.-M., and contained the following dedication:"|"Conference at Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"
"ap ~ 05:30"|"About half-past five"|"Sounds floated in to her occasionally: sounds softened and made pleasant by distance. Even shouts of ‘Be careful! My vork vill broken be! Ach, vot it in Inklandt suffers!’ took on a melancholy charm, an almost Venetian cadence, as if Canaletto himself were calling across the flushed evening lagoons, when heard at a distance of four hundred yards; and numerous bumps, thuds and crashes only sounded like an air raid on some other town than one’s own. About half-past five Mr Mybug, wearing a colourful lumber-jacket, dashed in to make his farewells."|"Conference at Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"
