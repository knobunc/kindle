Dad’s office smells of pound notes, papery but metallic too. The blinds were down so it felt like evening, not ten in the morning. There’s a serious clock on the wall, exactly the same make as the serious clocks on the walls at school. There’s a photo of Dad shaking hands with Craig Salt when Dad got made regional sales director for Greenland. (Greenland the supermarket chain, not Greenland the country.)

I even thought he might be Nick Yew ’cause he was sort of stocky. But the strange thing was, if I looked at this kid directly for more than a moment, dark spaces sort of swallowed him up. The first couple of times I thought he’d gone home. But after another half loop of the lake, he’d be back. Just at the edge of my vision.

Waiting at the Pelican crossing by the closed-down beautician’s she asked me if I’d had a good day and I said, “Okay.” I asked her if she’d had a good day too and she said, “Oh, sparkling creative and deeply fulfilling, thank you.” Dead sarky, Mum can be, even though she tells me off for it. “Did you get any Valentine’s cards?” I said no, but even if I’d had some I’d’ve told her no. (I did get one but I put it in the bin. It said “Suck My Dick” and was signed by Nicholas Briar, but it looked like Gary Drake’s handwriting.) Duncan Priest’d got four. Neal Brose got seven, or so he reckons. Ant Little found out that Nick Yew’d got twenty. I didn’t ask Mum if she’d got any.

Everyone thanked Mum politely and Mum said, “You’re welcome” politely too. Dad sent me to Mr. Rhydd’s on my bike to get 7UP and Mars bars. (Mr. Rhydd told me it was the hottest day of 1982 so far.)

Gordon’s in my year at school (in a dimmer’s class) and here was my dad paying his dad. How embarrassing’s that? Gordon didn’t speak much either, so maybe he felt embarrassed too. Mum was looking stonier and stonier as the rockery in the garden and the rockery in her blueprint got more and more different. After the pond’s shell was lowered and we stopped for toasted sandwiches, Mum announced she was going into Tewkesbury to do some shopping.

"ap > 09:00"|"after nine o’clock"|"If Dad guessed I was trying to make him feel guilty, that’d give him the excuse to not let me. So after nine o’clock, I switched on the reading lamp and read Watership Down. Up to the bit where Bigwig faces up to General Wound-wort. Moths kept tapping the window. Insects crawled over the glass like skaters on ice. A key turned in the lock and Dad tripped into the room. “Ah, Jason, here you are.”"|"Black Swan Green"|"David Mitchell"

"ap 00:15"|"quarter past twelve"|"“There are none so blind, Mr. McNamara.” Mr. Nixon advanced a few steps, hands hidden behind his back. Boys shrank against the benches. “One minute ago I was speaking on the telephone to a colleague in Droitwich. Abruptly, I was obliged to apologize, and terminate the conversation. Now. Who can guess the reason?” (Every kid in the room stared very hard at the dirty floor. Even Mr. McNamara. Mr. Nixon’s stare’d’ve vaporized you if you met it.) “I ended my conversation due to the infantile braying coming from this room. Literally, I could no longer hear myself think. Now. I am not concerned about the identity of the ringleader. I do not care who roared, who hummed, who remained mute. What I care about is that Mr. McNamara, a guest in our school, will report to his peers—with just cause—that I am the headmaster of a zoo of hooligans. For this affront to my reputation, I shall punish every one of you.” Mr. Nixon lifted his chin one quarter inch. We flinched. “‘Please, Mr. Nixon! I didn’t join in! It’s not fair if you punish me!’” He dared anyone to agree, but nobody was stupid enough. “Oh, but I am not paid my stratospheric salary to be fair. I am paid my stratospheric salary to uphold standards. Standards which you”—he knit his hands together and cracked the knuckles, sickeningly—“just trampled into the dirt. In a more enlightened age, a sound thrashing would have taught you a sense of decorum. But as our masters at Westminster have deprived us of this tool, other, more onerous techniques must be found.” Mr. Nixon reached the door. “The Old Gym. A quarter past twelve. Latecomers will receive a week’s detention. Absentees will be expelled. That is all.”"|"Black Swan Green"|"David Mitchell"

Inside, seats’d been arranged in exam rows; 3KM sat on the left, 3GL on the right. “Does anyone,” Mr. Nixon began, “believe he shouldn’t be here?” Our headmaster may as well’ve said, “Does anyone wish to shoot their own kneecaps?” Nobody fell for it. Miss Glynch spoke mainly to 3GL. “You’ve let your teachers down, you’ve let your school down, and you’ve let yourself down…” Mr. Kempsey did us after. “I do not recall, in twenty-six years of teaching, feeling this sickened. You have behaved like a pack of hooligans…”

Your detention shall be repeated every lunchtime this week.” (Nobody dared groan.) “‘But sir! What is the point of this static punishment?’ The point is, that the victimization of the few—or even the one—by the many has no place in our school.”"|"Black Swan Green"|"David Mitchell"

Any doctor’ll tell yer as much.” His accent skimmed and skittered. “Blunt blades slip fierce easy. She’ll be back soon, will she?”
“Not till seven.”
“Pity, pity, don’t know when I’ll be passin’ here again. How ’bout yer fetchin’ them knives now, and I’ll make ’em nice and sharp anyway, eh? To surprise her, like. Got my stones and my tools.” He thumped a lumpy kit bag. “Shan’t take no more’n a second. Yer mam’ll be that pleased.

"ap 06:09"|six-nine|"“My dad,” said Clem Ostler, “called himself ‘Red Rex’ in prizefightin’ circles. Weren’t red-haired, weren’t polit’cal, he just liked the sound of it. Red Rex was the Goose Fair’s fighter. The bones o’ more than forty years ago, this’d be. Things was rougher an’ leaner back then. My family’d follow Mercy Watt’s old man gaff-catchin’ round the Vale of Evesham, down the Severn Valley, tradin’ horses with other Romanies an’ farmers an’ breeders an’ that. Usually a bit o’ money floatin’ round the fairs, so the men’d feel flush ’nough for a punt or two on a fight. A nearby barn’d be found, lookouts posted for gavvas if we couldn’t pay ’em off, an’ my dad’d challenge all comers. Dad weren’t the beefiest of his six brothers, but that was why, see, men’d bet stupid vonga, wads of it, on deckin’ him or on gettin’ first blood. Dad weren’t much to look at. But I’m tellin’ yer, Red Rex soaked up punches like a boulder! Slipp’rier than shit through a goose. No gloves in them days, mind! Bare-knuckle fightin’, it were. My first memories was of watchin’ Dad fight. These days those prizefighters’d be professional heavyweights or riot police or somethin’, but times was diff’rent. Now, one winter”—fresh screams from the Flying Tea Cups ride drowned Clem Ostler out for a moment—“one winter, word reached us ’bout this gigantic Welsh bastard. Monster of a man, serious, six foot eight, six-nine, from Anglesey. That was his name in all. Say ‘Anglesey’ that year, an’ everyone’d knew who yer meant. Fightin’ his way east, they said, rakin’ it in, just by smashin’ prizefighters’ skulls to eggshells. One blacksmith, name of McMahon, in Cheshire, died after half a round with Anglesey. ’Nother needed iron plates put in his skull, three or four climbed into the ring fit men an’ were carried out cripples for life. Anglesey’d been mouthin’ on how he’d hunt down Red Rex at the Goose Fair, right here, in Black Swan Green. Pulp him, skin him, string him up, smoke him, sell him to the pig farmers. Sure ’nough, when we got to our old atchin’-sen down Pig Lane, Anglesey’s people was there. Wouldn’t budge till after the fight. Twenty guineas was the prize money! Last man standin’d scoop the lot. Unheard of, back then, that sort o’money.”"|"Black Swan Green"|"David Mitchell"

Dad’d got to his office in Oxford at 8:55 A.M., and by 9:15 A.M. a security guard was escorting him off the premises. “We must tighten our belts,” says Margaret Thatcher, though she isn’t, not personally. “There is no alternative.” Greenland Supermarkets sacked Dad ’cause an expense account was £20 short. After eleven years. This way, Mum’d told Aunt Alice on the phone, they don’t have to pay Dad a penny in redundancy money. Danny Lawlor’d helped Craig Salt to stitch him up, she added. The Danny Lawlor I met in August was dead nice. But niceness isn’t goodness, I s’pose. Now he’s driving Dad’s company Rover 3200."|"Black Swan Green"|"David Mitchell"

00:00|Midnight|"“Locomotion” got all the girls doing this choo-choo dance in a snaky line. Then there was “Oops Upside Your Head,” which’s got a sort of rowing-boat dance to it. It’s not a dance for boys. “House of Fun” by Madness is, though. “House of Fun” is about buying condoms but the BBC didn’t ban it soon enough ’cause the BBC only spots secret meanings weeks after the dimmest duh-brain in Duffershire’s got it. Squelch did this electrocuted dance that more kids copied to take the piss at first, but actually it worked. (There’s a Squelch hiding in all great inventors.) Then “Once in a Lifetime” by Talking Heads came on. That was the crucial song that made it more bonzoish not to dance than to dance, so now me and Dean and Floyd did. The D.J. switched the strobe light on. Only for short bursts, ’cause strobes make your brain blow up. Dancing’s like walking down a busy high street or millions of other things. You’re absolutely fine as long as you don’t think about it. During the strobe storm, through a stormy night forest of necks and arms, I saw Holly Deblin. Holly Deblin’s got a sort of Indian goddess dance, swaying but sort of flicking her hands. Holly Deblin might’ve seen me through her stormy night forest, ’cause she might’ve smiled. (Might isn’t as good as did but it’s miles better than didn’t.) Next was “I Feel Love” by Donna Summer. John Tookey showed off this new New York craze called break dancing but went spinning out of control into a group of girls, who toppled like skittles. John Tookey had to be rescued by his mates from stabbing female heels. During Bryan Ferry’s “Jealous Guy” Lee Biggs got off with Angela Bullock. They snogged in the corner and Duncan Priest stood right by them and did his imitation of a cow giving birth. But the laughers were envious too. Angela Bullock wears black bras. Then, during “To Cut a Long Story Short” by Spandau Ballet, Alastair Nurton got off with Tracey Impney, this giant goth from Brotheridge Green. Gary Numan and Tubeway Army’s “Are ‘Friends’ Electric?” came on and Colin Pole and Mark Badbury did this glazed robot dance. “This song’s ace!” Dean yelled in my ear. “It’s so futuristic. Gary Numan’s got a friend named ‘Five’! Is that brill or what?” Dancing’s a brain the dancers’re only cells of. Dancers think they’re in charge but they’re obeying ancient orders. “Three Times a Lady” by the Commodores cleared the floor ’cept for boyfriends and girlfriends who smooched, enjoying being looked at, and snoggers who just snogged and forgot they were being looked at. Second choices were going for the third choices now. Paul White got off with Lucy Sneads. Next on was “Come on Eileen” by Dexy’s Midnight Runners. A disco’s a zoo too. Some of the animals’re wilder than they are by day, some funnier, some posier, some shyer, some sexier. Holly Deblin’d obviously gone home."|"Black Swan Green"|"David Mitchell"
