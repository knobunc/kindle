"~ 00:00"|"About midnight"|"""I took a camp bed into one of the empty rooms and lay down and tried to sleep,"" went on Snowjuice. ""About midnight I heard screaming outside. Then that great slimy fist came crashing through the window-pane and started to grope about the room. I was shaking so much I could hardly unscrew the top of the bottle. Then the fist came nearer and somehow I managed to give it a sprinkling. At once there was an awful scream, and a hissing voice said: 'That fat elephant has put you up to this, but it won't make any difference!' """|"Uncle and His Detective"|"J. P. Martin"

"~ 14:00"|"about two this afternoon"|"""Good!"" said Uncle. ""We need say no more. Now my idea of the day is this. No floral decorations. The castle will, of course, have a few flags out and electric lights from top to bottom, and the great searchlight will be working on Captain Walrus's lighthouse. After refreshments I will make a short speech of about five minutes, and everybody will be pleased and somewhat enriched when they hear it. If your Majesty will do me the favour of seeing that this gathering is announced, it will help me. Let all come about two this afternoon, and they will hear something that will do them good."""|"Uncle and His Detective"|"J. P. Martin"
