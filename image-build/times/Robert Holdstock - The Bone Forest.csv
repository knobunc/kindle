03:00|"three in the morning"|"The sound of his sons' excited shouting woke Huxley abruptly at three in the morning. His breath frosting in the freezing room, he shivered his way into his dressing gown, tugged on slippers, and walked darkly and swiftly to the boys' room."|"The Bone Forest"|"Robert Holdstock"
"ap 07:30"|"seven thirty"|"He kept this second log hidden behind the bookcase where his journals were shelved. He placed the book there now, then tugged on his Wellington boots and overcoat. It was just after dawn, seven thirty or so, and he was aware of two things: the odd silence of the day outside (no clamor from the chicken house), and the second set of tracks through the snow."|"The Bone Forest"|"Robert Holdstock"

He had danced about a fire often enough: on May eve, at the passing of the day of All Hallows. But those fires were in the village bounds. His soul fluttered, a delighted bird, at the thought of the woodland fire.

They were a shared life with the forest."|"The Bone Forest"|"Robert Holdstock"

And at ten o'clock the whole wild dance stopped.
Silence."|"The Bone Forest"|"Robert Holdstock"
