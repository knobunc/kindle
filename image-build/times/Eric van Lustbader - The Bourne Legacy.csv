"ap 06:06"|"six minutes past six"|"Martin Lindros, Deputy Director of the CIA, arrived at the Manassas estate of the late Alexander Conklin at precisely six minutes past six. He was met by the ranking Virginia State Police detective, a harried, balding man named Harris who was trying to mediate the territorial dispute that had sprung up between the state police, the county sheriff’s office and the FBI, all of whom had begun vying for jurisdiction as soon as the identities of the deceased had been discovered. When Lindros emerged from his car, he counted a dozen vehicles, three times that number of people. What was needed was a sense of order and purpose."|"The Bourne Legacy"|"Eric van Lustbader"

They had been alerted to the presence of Jason Bourne by the night manager, who had awakened from a Xanax-induced doze to see Bourne’s face staring at him from the TV screen. He had pinched himself to make sure he wasn’t dreaming, had taken a shot of cheap rye, and made his call."|"The Bourne Legacy"|"Eric van Lustbader"

The shop looked like all the other independently owned businesses in Old Town; that is to say, it had a vaguely Colonial facade. He crossed the red-brick sidewalk, pushed open the door, and went inside. The public area of the shop was divided in half by a waist-high barrier made up of a counter on the left and cutting tables on the right. The sewing machines were midway back behind the counter, manned by three Latinas who did not even glance up when he entered. A thin man in shirtsleeves and open striped vest stood behind the counter frowning down at something. He had a high, domed forehead, a fringe of light brown hair, a face with sagging cheeks and muddy eyes. His glasses were pushed up onto the crown of his scalp. He had a habit of pinching his hawklike nose. He paid no attention to the door opening but looked up as Bourne approached the counter."|"The Bourne Legacy"|"Eric van Lustbader"

It struck one and came apart at the seam. Refuse flew everywhere, sending the agents backward, coughing, their eyes streaming, arms over their faces. Bourne struck upward, shattering the light bulb, plunging the narrow space into darkness. He turned and, flicking on his flashlight, saw the blank wall at the other end of the passageway. But there was a doorway to the outside, how… ?"|"The Bourne Legacy"|"Eric van Lustbader"

Once there, he spent an hour or so scanning documents, interdepartmental memos and the like, writing e-mail responses when necessary. His phone was answered by his assistant, who logged calls and brought him messages deemed urgent by her. In this, as in all things she did for Robbinet, she was exemplary. She had been trained by him and her instincts were unerring."|"The Bourne Legacy"|"Eric van Lustbader"

This meant that Robbinet could tell her where he was lunching each day with his mistress—be it a quiet bistro or the mistress’s apartment in the fourth arrondissement. This was crucial, since Robbinet took long lunches, even by French standards. He rarely returned to the office before four, but he was often at his desk until well past midnight, in signals with his counterparts in America.

Just when did this bitch-woman sleep? he wondered as he put down the phone. He sat on the edge of his bed, facing away from Madeleine. Nothing disturbed her sleep, he thought sourly.

It had once belonged to a Russian tenor, Maxim something-or-other, but the DCI liked it because it had about it a certain mathematical elegance, an aristocratic air that could no longer be found in buildings of a younger vintage. Best of all was its sense of Old World privacy, owing to a cobbled courtyard screened by leafy poplars and a hand-worked iron fence. He sat back in the plush seat of the Lincoln Town Car, watching morosely as Washington slept on around him. Christ, at this hour only the fucking robins are up, he thought.

monks are sounding, echoing from ridge to ridge in the forested mountains; the monks he
hunted when he was with the Khmer Rouge. And the smell of, what is it? cinnamon. The
water, swirling with a malevolent current, is alive with sounds and scents from he knows
not where. It seeks to drag him down, and once again he’s sinking. No matter how hard
he struggles, how desperately he strikes out for the surface, he feels himself spiraling
down, as if weighted with lead. His hands are scrabbling at the thick rope tied around his
left ankle, but it’s so slick it keeps sliding through his fingers. What is at the end of the
rope? He peers down into the shadowy depths through which he’s sinking. It seems
imperative to him that he know what is dragging him to his death, as if that knowledge
might save him from a horror for which he has no name. He’s falling, falling, tumbling
into darkness, unable to understand the nature of his desperate predicament. Below him,
at the end of the taut rope, he sees a shape— the thing that will cause his death. Emotion
sticks in his throat like a mouthful of nettles, and as he tries to define the shape, the
musical sound comes to him again, clearer this time, not bells, something else, something
at once intimate and barely remembered. At last, he identifies the thing that’s causing him
to drown: It’s a human body. All at once, he begins to weep…. Khan awoke with a start, a whimper caught in his throat. He bit down hard on his lip, looked around the darkened cabin of the plane. Outside, all was black as pitch. He had fallen asleep even though he’d promised himself he wouldn’t, knowing that if he did he would be trapped in his recurring nightmare. He rose, went to the lavatory, where he used the paper towels to wipe the sweat off his face and arms. He felt more tired than when the flight had taken off. While he was staring at himself in the mirror, the pilot announced their airtime to Orly Airport: four hours, fifty minutes. An eternity for Khan."|"The Bourne Legacy"|"Eric van Lustbader"

His skin had gone pale; it crawled with sweat. “That is to say, I was on duty. I swear to you one moment it was there on the top of the check-in counter. It simply appeared. I didn’t see the person who brought it and neither did anyone on my staff. It was noon, check-out time, a very busy period for us.

The air was crisp and chill, the sky clear. But near the horizon a bank of thick clouds roiled and on the freshening wind the damp musk of rain came to him. Now and again a sound or a scent fired something in his damaged memory. He was certain that he had been here before, though when and on what mission he couldn’t say. Once again, as he touched the void of loss and longing, he thought of Alex and Mo so strongly he might have been able to conjure them up this very moment."|"The Bourne Legacy"|"Eric van Lustbader"

It was here, hours before the 1956 Uprising, that thousands congregated, waving Hungarian flags from which they had painstakingly and joyously cut the hammer and sickle, prior to marching on parliament. The apartment was cramped and crowded, primarily because of the concert grand piano that took up fully half the space of the living room.

For days now he’d done nothing but follow orders as his cadre of protectors flew him under cover of night to Crete, then proceeded to periodically move him from one location to another. They never stayed in one place for more than three days. He’d liked the house in Iraklion, but that too had proved boring in the end. There was nothing for him to do. They refused to bring him a newspaper or allow him to listen to the radio. As for television, there was none available, but he had to assume they would have kept him away from it, too. Still, he thought glumly, it was a damn sight better than this moldering pile of stone, with only a cot for a bed and a fire for warmth. Heavy chests and sideboards were virtually the only furniture, though the men had brought folding chairs, cots and linens. There was no plumbing; they’d made a privy in the courtyard and its stench reached all the way into the interior of the monastery. It was gloomy and dank, even at noon, and God help them all when darkness fell. Not even a light to read by, if there’d been anything to read."|"The Bourne Legacy"|"Eric van Lustbader"

It had been Deron, the artist and master forger, who’d taught Bourne the fine art of hacking into U.S Government databases. In his business, it was a necessary skill. The problem was that the CIA firewall—the software program designed to keep their data secure—was a particular bitch. In addition to its keyword changing every week, it had a floating algorithm tied into the keyword. But Deron had shown Bourne the way to fool the system into thinking you had the keyword when you didn’t, so that the program itself would supply it for you."|"The Bourne Legacy"|"Eric van Lustbader"

When the driver complied, the guard told him to open the back of the van. The guard climbed in, checked off each item on the list, then he and his partner opened every carton, checking the two chairs, credenza, cabinet and sofa bed. All the doors on the credenza and cabinet were opened, the interiors inspected, the pillows on the sofa and chairs lifted.
