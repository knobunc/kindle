"ap 06:15"|"quarter past six"|"I shivered from shoulders to toes and opened my eyes.
The hands of my brass alarm clock stood at a quarter past six.
Swinging my legs out of bed, I fished for my slippers with my toes, then, bundling myself in my bedding—sheets, quilt, and all—heaved out of bed and, hunched over like a corpulent cockroach, waddled towards the windows."|"I Am Half-Sick of Shadows"|"Alan Bradley"
12:00|noon|"“Now, then,” he said, turning to Dogger, “their lordships and ladyships will be along at noon in their motorcars. They’ll be hungry as hounds after the drive down from London, so look sharp and see that you’ve got buckets of caviar laid on.”"|"I Am Half-Sick of Shadows"|"Alan Bradley"
12:00|noon|"“Miss Wyvern has arrived,” he announced, drawing himself to attention.
“But—” I managed, “they weren’t supposed to be here until noon …”
Phyllis Wyvern! My mind was spinning. With Father away, surely I couldn’t be expected to …"|"I Am Half-Sick of Shadows"|"Alan Bradley"

"ap 04:30"|four-thirty|"At four-thirty, the doorbell rang. I had been sitting on the stairs watching the electricians as they snaked miles of black cable from the foyer to far-flung corners of the house."|"I Am Half-Sick of Shadows"|"Alan Bradley"
"ap 07:30"|seven-thirty|"“Right, then,” he said. “All present and accounted for. Jeannette and Clifford, as you were. You may stand down. We’ll be taking the principals this evening, after all. First read-through tomorrow morning at seven-thirty, costumes at nine-fifteen. Miss Trodd will hand out the sheets in two hours’ time.”"|"I Am Half-Sick of Shadows"|"Alan Bradley"

"ap 10:05"|"five past ten"|"The down train from London was due at Doddingsley at five past ten. If Clarence Mundy had been picking them up in his taxicab, Father and Aunt Felicity would be at Buckshaw within half an hour. But today, allowing for the snow and the practiced funereal pace at which the vicar usually drove, it seemed likely to be well past eleven before they arrived."|"I Am Half-Sick of Shadows"|"Alan Bradley"
"ap 01:15"|"quarter past one"|"It was, in fact, not until a quarter past one that the vicar’s Morris pulled up exhausted at the front door, piled like a refugee’s cart with various peculiarly shaped objects projecting from the windows and lashed to the roof. As soon as they climbed out of the car, I could tell that Father and Aunt Felicity had been quarreling."|"I Am Half-Sick of Shadows"|"Alan Bradley"

"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"“She wasn’t outside more’n a minute,” she had told me, wide-eyed, speaking of Mrs. Milne, the butcher’s wife. “Just long enough to ’ang the baby’s nappies on the line—that’s all it took. By four o’clock she ’ad a cough, by seven ’er ’ead was as ’ot as the Arab desert, and by the time the sun come up she was in a box and stiff as a board. Pneumonia, it was. There’s nothin’ else as’ll snatch you off like pneumonia. Makes you drown in your own juices.”"|"I Am Half-Sick of Shadows"|"Alan Bradley"

“I can’t be sure,” I said. “Midnight, perhaps, or a quarter past.”

One way or another, it was far too early to check my traps: With half the population of Bishop’s Lacey wandering about at large in the house, the old gentleman would hardly risk coming down the drawing room chimney."|"I Am Half-Sick of Shadows"|"Alan Bradley"

When my eyes snapped open it was eight minutes past midnight.
From somewhere in the house came the sound of singing."|"I Am Half-Sick of Shadows"|"Alan Bradley"
