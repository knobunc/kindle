03:00|"three in the morning"|"For Joseph Hooker, meanwhile, Erebus was proving a good home. ‘I am very happy and comfortable here,’ he wrote to his father. ‘Not very idle.’ Because they shared a similar interest in the sciences, Hooker got on well with Ross. The captain had given him space in his cabin for his plants, and ‘one of the tables under the stern window is wholly mine’. A letter to his sisters offers an intimate glimpse of their relationship. ‘Almost every day I draw, sometimes all day long and till two or three in the morning, the Captain directing me. He sits at one side of the table, writing and figuring at night, and I, on the other, drawing.’ Ross had ordered nets to be hung overboard to collect sea creatures – another plus for Hooker. ‘McCormick pays no attention to them, so they are therefore brought at once to me.’ Hooker’s one regret was that the expedition was progressing so slowly. Perhaps not surprisingly, he didn’t blame Ross’s obsession with following magnetic lines for this. Instead he criticised the Erebus’s sister ship: ‘The Terror has been a sad drawback to us, having every now and then to shorten sail for her [to allow her to catch up].’"|Erebus|"Michael Palin"
"~ 22:00"|"about 10 PM"|"Terror certainly seems to have been the more relaxed and less cerebral of the two ships at this time. In his diary, Cunningham notes the high point of the day: ‘Killed a Bullock in the afternoon and the offal which was throwed overboard attracted a Shark which we caught about 10 PM with a hook and a bait of the Bullock’s tripe. He made great resistance on being hauled inboard. He was of the blue specie and measured 9 feet 5 inches.’ The next day he noted, ‘Dissected Mr Jack Shark…and every man on board had a splendid Blow out [feast] of his carcase; his flesh was white as milk and not the least rank.’ Next day the weather was ‘extremely fine going free…Eat the last of the Shark for supper.’ By 26 February they had slowed down yet again, but Cunningham seemed unconcerned. ‘The latter part of the day becalmed,’ he wrote. ‘Felt particularly cheerful – can’t account for it.’"|Erebus|"Michael Palin"

Not one to waste a moment, Surgeon McCormick took some of his fellow officers out to celebrate their arrival by going ashore for the last night of a play called Rory O’More at the Theatre Royal.

They had reached 66°S 30′E, ‘farther south than either “French” or “Yankies”,’ noted Cunningham, with some satisfaction. Conditions were changing fast. The ships were now on the edge of pack-ice, and the temperature by day barely rose above freezing. Extra provisions were available to celebrate the New Year, and extra-cold weather gear was handed out to the crew, consisting of a box-cloth jacket and trousers, two pairs of hose, two comforters (scarves worn around the throat to protect it from cold), a pair of water boots and a woollen cap known as a ‘Welsh wig’, the Royal Navy’s equivalent of a beanie."|Erebus|"Michael Palin"
12:00|noon|"Gradually the ice thickened and progress slowed. On 8 January a violent storm brought them to a standstill. But before the storm broke, Ross had worked out – from the darkening colour reflected in the sky – that there must be open water ahead. Sure enough, by noon on the 9th they found themselves once again in open sea, making four knots in a strong breeze."|Erebus|"Michael Palin"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"Ross and his helmsman had for a while been observing a polar phenomenon known as ‘ice-blink’, by which, owing to the refraction of light, clouds and sky can appear as solid physical features. It had manifested itself most famously in 1818, when John Ross had, embarrassingly, confused clouds for mountains on his expedition to discover the Northwest Passage. Given the furore that had ensued, it’s not surprising that Sir John’s nephew should now be rather more curious, assuming that what appeared to be a long, white coastline on the horizon might well be another instance of a polar mirage. That was until, at two in the morning, Lieutenant Wood, the officer on watch, roused the captain to report the unmistakable presence of a solid land mass."|Erebus|"Michael Palin"

"ap 03:30"|330|"On 9 February, with the ice-pack to the north closing in behind the ships and threatening to trap them against the Barrier, Ross detected ‘a remarkable looking bay’, the only indentation he’d seen in the so-far-unbroken face of the ice. He decided to take the ships in. A quarter of a mile from the entrance he paused, tacking to determine the depth. It was 330 fathoms – 1,000 feet. Approaching further, it was clear that a spur of ice projecting into the water had created this deceptively protective inlet. It was a time to hold their breath. They were now closer to the base of the Great Southern Barrier than they had ever been. Looking up, they could see gigantic icicles hanging from the summit of the cliff. Cornelius Sullivan, like others, was agog. ‘All hands when they came on Deck to view this most rare and magnificent Sight that Ever the human eye witnessed Since the world was created actually Stood Motionless for Several Seconds before he Could Speak to the man next to him…Then I wishd. I was an artist or a draughtsman instead of a blacksmith and Armourer.’"|Erebus|"Michael Palin"
"< 00:00"|"Before midnight"|"The realisation must have come as a relief to Ross, but it must also have been the cause for some quiet self-satisfaction. When he came to write about it, he generously surmised that Lieutenant Wilkes must have ‘mistaken for land some of the dense well-defined clouds which so continually hang over extensive packs of ice – a mistake which we had ourselves, on many occasions, to guard against’. But even the phlegmatic Ross must surely have had the hint of a smile as he wrote about their next move: ‘Before midnight [we] gained the position of the eastern point of the supposed land, and shaped our course…under moderate sail, along the mountain range.’"|Erebus|"Michael Palin"

Carriages arrived at Government House and were directed to Ross Cove down a specially laid track, which wound through the trees to the waterside. Here Sir John had cleared the ground for a paddock, where guests could be dropped off. The two ships, bedecked with Chinese lanterns, stood a little way off the shore, joined to the bank by a bridge of boats – Erebus designated as the ballroom and Terror as the dining room and bar. Tarpaulins had been raised over the decks to provide cover. Passing between a pair of tall lamp-posts, guests approached, two abreast, through a canvas-covered arcade, decorated with flags and with branches of yellow wattle and other native plants ‘as to resemble the mouth of a grotto’, as McCormick described it in his journal, ‘so that after wending along a gloomy narrow passage for some sixty or seventy yards, a flood of light all at once burst upon them on stepping from the gangway upon the quarter deck’."|Erebus|"Michael Palin"

It took a little time for the 300 guests to negotiate the gangway from one ship to the other, but once aboard, a fine display awaited them. The sides of the ship were lined with black and scarlet cloth, with candles placed in front of the mirrors. McCormick felt that ‘[Lieutenant] McMurdo…with his customary good taste, left nothing to be desired in its decoration and certainly threw us in the Erebus into the shade.’ The chandeliers particularly caught McCormick’s envious eye: ‘tastefully formed of bright steel bayonets, which had a far more ship-shape appearance than our hired commonplace glass ones’."|Erebus|"Michael Palin"

They danced on the deck of the Erebus until six in the morning."|Erebus|"Michael Palin"
"ap < 05:00"|"just before five o’clock"|"Further tragedy struck a few days later. The home of an English woman, Mrs Robertson, was set on fire by natives, and she, her manservant and three children were all murdered. Fearing an escalation in violence, the expedition, escorted by HMS Favourite, set sail from the Bay of Islands just before five o’clock on the morning of 23 November 1841. ‘Our decks had all the appearance of a farm-yard,’ wrote McCormick, ‘…consisting of oxen, sheep, goats, pigs, and poultry, and each quarter was festooned with a line of pumpkins.’"|Erebus|"Michael Palin"
"ap 09:15"|"quarter past nine"|"Cunningham’s disgust at Irvine’s dirtiness underlines the importance of personal hygiene aboard ship. The crew were usually split into ‘divisions’, supervised by an officer who made sure that healthy standards were maintained, and with different days of the week set aside for washing, shaving and mending. Some of the officers had washbasins in their cabins, but the men would usually bathe in basins or tubs on the forecastle, if it was warm enough. The colder it became, the more the men were confined, and the more necessary it was to keep checks on cleanliness. Parry, in his first over-wintering voyage in 1821, put in place a regular system. As he described it in his journal: ‘Three quarters of an hour being allowed after breakfast for the men to prepare themselves for muster, we then beat to divisions punctually at quarter past nine when…a strict inspection of the men took place, as to their personal cleanliness and good condition as well as sufficient warmth of their clothing.’"|Erebus|"Michael Palin"

Uniquely, as Davis noted, they were ‘all up’: no one was asleep, and no one was on duty, either – the enforced confinement on the ice meant there was no need to climb rigging, or furl sails, or man the ship’s wheel, or keep lookout. The Clark Ross Expedition thus entered 1842 as a tableau in the ice, with everyone of whatever rank or station playing a part. According to Cornelius Sullivan, some of the Terror’s crew came across to Erebus and danced on the deck until five in the morning, after which there were one or two ‘Pugialistic matches in the forecastle which peaceably ended’. As Sergeant Cunningham put it, ‘Saturday Jan 1st. Was ushered in with joviality and hilarity. I hope it will go out so.’"|Erebus|"Michael Palin"

Even Ross, who airbrushed most frivolity from his later account of the expedition, was caught by the mood. ‘If our friends in England could have witnessed the scene, they would have thought, what I am sure truly was the case, that we were a very happy party.’ The festivities continued the next day, with a sort of slapstick Antarctic Olympics. There were greasy poles to climb and greased pigs to catch, and all to the raucous accompaniment of gongs (otherwise used in thick fog to keep contact with other ships) and cow-horns for trumpets."|Erebus|"Michael Palin"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"Ross was understandably worried. ‘Soon after midnight,’ he later wrote, ‘our ships were involved in an ocean of rolling fragments of ice, hard as floating rocks of granite…and the destruction of the ships seemed inevitable.’ For twenty-eight hours the fate of the two ships hung in the balance. Ross could only pray as he watched ‘our ships still rolling and groaning amidst the heavy fragments of crushing bergs, over which the ocean rolled…dashing and grinding them together with fearful violence’. ‘Each of us secured our hold,’ he recalled, ‘waiting the issue with resignation to the will of Him who alone could preserve us and bring us safely through this extreme danger.’"|Erebus|"Michael Palin"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"It wasn’t until the first day of February that there were signs of change. By the evening they could tell they were close to the edge of the ice-pack.

"> 00:00"|"Just after midnight"|"Just after midnight on 22 February they came through another gale, to hear a cry from the lookout announcing that the Great Barrier was in sight. But they still could not find a way through it. Ross persevered for a while, in the forlorn hope that he might find access, but the ice was thickening fast and he realised that the Barrier seemed to have no end. On 23 February, standing 1½ miles out from the ice-wall, Erebus waited for Terror to catch up, so that the two ships could record their position at the same time. They were at 161°W and 78°9′30″S – 6 miles further south than their previous record. Second Master Davis, aboard Terror, recounted his feelings in his letter to his sister. ‘The Erebus sounded, and we tacked in the spot she did, so that neither ship could say she was beyond the other. No one will ever beat that in this longitude, that I may safely say.’ To an extent, he was right. No other sailing ship would ever get as far south as Erebus and Terror did that day. In fact no ship of any kind reached that far south for almost sixty years. Ross, who had already reached a record 82.43°N in 1827, could now claim to have achieved a feat shared only by his shipmates Edward Bird and Thomas Abernethy: to have been further north and further south than anyone else on earth."|Erebus|"Michael Palin"
"< 01:00"|"just before 1 a.m."|"With a strengthening wind, Erebus was still making seven knots when, just before 1 a.m., James Angelly, the man at the foretop, shouted a warning from 100 feet above them. ‘All hands on deck!’ was sounded. Men asleep in their hammocks were roused, and turned out half-naked and utterly confused. Among them was John Davis. ‘I was in bed and on the sick list with my hand,’ he later wrote. ‘I had been awoken by the noise of reefing topsails, and lay awake listening. I knew something must be wrong, by the constant commands to the helmsman. At last someone regularly screamed down the fore hatchway, “All hands bear a hand on deck, every one!” – and immediately after came a crash. “Good God”, cried I, “we are foul of an iceberg.” ’"|Erebus|"Michael Palin"

After an entry for 17 April recording Divine Service, Sergeant Cunningham described the dangers of a day off. ‘They all got insensibly drunk with some deleterious drug bearing the name Rum.

That night the officers gathered aboard for a grand meal. The next morning at six o’clock the entire crew assembled to catch the high tide and haul their ship onto the beach, lie it on its side and inspect closely the damage sustained in the Antarctic. Carpenters then worked all day and night to replace timbers and restore some of the copper sheeting. Within thirty-six hours she was ready to be refloated. The same now had to be done for Terror, but that proved to be a much tougher job. As the Falklands winter tightened its grip, the work had to be carried out in wind, sleet and snow."|Erebus|"Michael Palin"
09:00|"nine a.m."|"They were still more than 5,000 miles from home, but the winds were favourable and just over two months later, on 30 August, they were within sight of St Agnes Lighthouse on the Isles of Scilly. Ross’s long account, almost at an end, records that at first light on 2 September ‘the shores of Old England came into view’. McCormick, as ever, adds a little more colour to the moment: ‘Very fine day, but with light, contrary airs. At nine a.m., upon going up on deck, I saw the land of old England again, after some four years’ absence.’ Two days later they were close to Beachy Head, and McCormick found the words to match the moment. It was a day to celebrate: ‘the sea smooth as a lake, and studded with countless vessels; whilst the line of coast, displaying the rich, golden-yellow fields of corn, some in sheaf, some still standing, altogether gave animation to the scene’. At Folkestone, Ross left his ship and caught the train to London. He went straight from the station to Somerset House, overlooking the Thames, to report to the Admiralty. Here, as he later remembered it, he received ‘the most gratifying reception from Lord Haddington, Sir William Gage and my highly valued friends Admiral Beaufort and Sir John Barrow’."|Erebus|"Michael Palin"
10:30|"half-past ten in the morning"|"At half-past ten in the morning of 19 May anchors were weighed, the ships swung through 360 degrees to make sure their compasses were working, and the Franklin expedition to the Northwest Passage finally got under way, with twenty-four officers and 110 men aboard. Crowds cheered from the dockside. Sir John waved vigorously to his family as they receded into the distance. The sight of HMS Erebus, fresh-painted black, with a distinctive white band around her hull, leading the best-supplied expedition ever to leave British shores must have given them all confidence that the best that could be done had been done."|Erebus|"Michael Palin"
04:00|"four in the morning"|"It is not recorded whether Franklin knew about this, but when Fitzjames discovered their misdemeanour he was lenient. Admitting that ‘according to the rules of the service, these men should have been severely punished’, he judged that, on this occasion, ‘Men know very well when they are in the wrong.’ At four in the morning he ordered David Bryant, the Sergeant of Marines, and Lieutenant Gore to scour the ship for any spirits and throw them overboard. It took two hours to rid the ship of illegal alcohol, but the offenders were allowed to stay with the expedition, for which they were duly grateful. In view of what lay ahead, a sterner disciplinarian than Fitzjames might have saved their lives."|Erebus|"Michael Palin"
22:00|"Ten p.m."|"One can imagine James Fitzjames at the table in his narrow cabin, about a quarter the size of the great spread of the captain’s cabin next door, but snug enough, with a bookshelf in an alcove above the bed, and on the bulkhead a picture of his closest friend and foster-father, William Coningham. He had promised Elizabeth, William’s wife, that he would keep an account of the journey for her. This was the day he was going to start. He picked up a porcupine quill and dipped it in the inkwell:
Her Majesty’s ship Erebus, at sea, June 8th 1845, Ten p.m.
You appeared very anxious that I should keep a journal for your especial perusal. Now, I do keep a journal, such as it is, which will be given to the Admiralty; but, to please you, I shall note down from time to time such things as may strike me, either in the form of a letter, or in any other form that may at the time suit my fancy."|Erebus|"Michael Palin"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"We can only be thankful that Fitzjames wrote so attractively and so diligently, by his own account regularly staying up until two in the morning to record his thoughts and observations, before going on watch at five."|Erebus|"Michael Palin"

"ap 10:30"|"half-past ten"|"That day was a significant occasion for James Fitzjames, too. In a letter to William Coningham he spoke of a possible promotion. ‘There was a talk before we left England of a brevet on this day [a brevet being a promotion without additional pay]; if this be true, I think it more than probable that I shall get the rank of captain. With this idea I took a glass of brandy and water at half-past ten and drank your health.’ He added that his habit of late-night letter-writing had not gone unnoticed, ‘for Reid has just said, scratching his head, “Why, Mr Jems, you never seem to sleep at arl; you’re always writin!” I tell him that when I do sleep, I do twice as much as other people in the same time.’"|Erebus|"Michael Palin"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"At eleven o’clock on the 25th, and with the sun just setting, Fitzjames wrote excitedly to Elizabeth Coningham: ‘I am very sleepy and tired but did not like to go to bed without writing on the first day on which we have seen Arctic land. The air is delightfully cool and bracing, and everybody is in good humour, either with himself or his neighbours. I have been on deck all day taking observations.’ His fellow officers were fishing, after a fashion. ‘Goodsir is catching the most extraordinary animals in a net…Gore and Des Voeux are over the side poking with nets and long poles, with cigars in their mouths and Osmer laughing.’ He summed up a general mood of excited anticipation: ‘We bounded along merrily, shaking hands with ourselves and making imaginary shortcuts through America to the Pacific.’"|Erebus|"Michael Palin"
04:00|"four in the morning"|"The work of transferring the Barretto’s cargo took nine days, with the men working from four in the morning until six in the evening. ‘We are fully occupied in filling up every hole and corner of the ship with stores,’ wrote Franklin. ‘I have taken into my cabin…potatoes which are packed in ten cases and store conveniently without interfering with either Mr. Goodsir’s table or my own, or another at which I think Mr. Le Vesconte will take up his position and make the charts.’ Seven of the bullocks taken on board at Stromness had perished by the time they reached Disko. Now the remaining three were slaughtered, each ship being given three or four quarters of beef to hang up in the rigging and provide fresh meat for the expedition’s first Christmas."|Erebus|"Michael Palin"

00:00|midnight|"Despite the work of loading and the daily routine of taking magnetic measurements, the young officers were having the time of their lives. ‘You’ve no conception of how happy we are,’ wrote Fitzjames. ‘Osmer has just come from on deck (midnight) and is dancing with an imaginary skipping rope. I said to him “What a happy fellow you are, always in good humour.” His answer is “Well sir, if I’m not happy here, I don’t know where else I could be.” ’"|Erebus|"Michael Palin"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"At six o’clock next morning, Sunday 13 July 1845, Erebus and Terror hauled up their anchors and set sail, north by north-west, for Baffin Bay and Lancaster Sound. Finally, they were on their own."|Erebus|"Michael Palin"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"On his return to London, Rae submitted his report to the Admiralty. The effect was shattering. A copy was rushed to Lady Franklin and reached her at two in the morning. Sophy broke the news to her. ‘No words,’ Sophy wrote later, ‘can describe the horror of that night.’"|Erebus|"Michael Palin"
12:00|midday|"The pile of evidence continued to grow. On 5 May they came across an 18-foot-long spruce tree that had been cut in half with a whipsaw, presumably for use as fuel. The next day they discovered another, smaller cairn, with a broken pickaxe and an empty tea or coffee canister inside. After spending an hour in a fruitless search for documents, they continued south, where they found a third cairn, with ‘a great quantity of gear’ strewn about. There was much to investigate here, so they pitched their tent nearby. At midday on 6 May they went to work."|Erebus|"Michael Palin"
18:45|1845|"The note might confidently have stated that all was well, but even at this stage there are signs that things were awry. For a start, Fitzjames had got his dates wrong: it was 1845–6, not 1846–7, when they wintered on Beechey Island. Richard Cyriax’s explanation is that the mistaken date was simply a slip of the pen and shows that such records were considered of very little importance. But it could be an indication that the members of the expedition had become increasingly disorientated. And the fact that Franklin himself did not write or sign the note was ominous."|Erebus|"Michael Palin"
"ap ~ 05:59"|"about one to six"|"Other circumstantial evidence would appear to support the poisoned-tin thesis. As Russell Potter emphasises, the diet would have differed quite markedly between decks. Whereas the bulk of the crew would have eaten a fairly basic diet of salt pork and hardtack, cooked by one of the company designated as mess-cook for the week, senior officers, who would have dined with the captain, would have had their own supplies, cooked by their own stewards. We know that Captain Crozier and Lieutenant Fairholme had procured goods from Fortnum & Mason, and they were almost certainly not the only ones. The officers would have had the best-quality tea, tobacco, wines and spirits – and also tinned food, then regarded as something of a luxury item. The Victory Point note records that of the deaths up till April 1848, nine were officers and fifteen were men. Bearing in mind that the proportion of officers to crew was about one to six, this is a startlingly high number of officers, and has been raised as further evidence that the tinned food could have been at fault."|Erebus|"Michael Palin"
12:00|Noon|"Absolute confirmation of the find had to wait until 7 September, when a remote operating vehicle (ROV) with a camera attached was launched into the water. The sea was becoming rougher and choppier, and visibility murkier by the moment. The suspense on the Sir Wilfrid Laurier was screwed tight, until the first video close-ups brought absolute clarification that the hulk on the seabed was indeed one of Franklin’s ships, her hull broken at the stern, but otherwise looking like it did on the day she was born. Bill Noon, captain of the Sir Wilfrid Laurier, was moved to tears. He had thought that the ice in Victoria Strait had kept them away from the discovery area, but in fact it had done exactly the opposite. ‘Somebody was pushing us to an answer,’ he said at the time. ‘Somebody had waited long enough and wanted to solve the riddle.’"|Erebus|"Michael Palin"
"~ 04:00"|"Around 4 a.m."|"Around 4 a.m. I wake from jumbled dreams and jetlag-shortened sleep to find the sun already in the sky. I check my map and see that we are steaming through Barrow Strait, one of the great highways of the Northwest Passage. By breakfast time we are off Beechey Island, which seems strangely familiar to me."|Erebus|"Michael Palin"
