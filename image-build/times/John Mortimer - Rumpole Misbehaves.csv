"ap < 01:00"|"just before one"|"The case against Wetherby was a simple one. On the date in question he telephoned the address in Flyte Street where Ludmilla Ravenskaya, a Russian immigrant, carried on her profession. His call was answered by Anna McKinnan, who acted as Miss Ravenskaya’s maid and was the main witness for the prosecution. My client left his work at lunchtime and just before one he was admitted to the house in Flyte Street for a brief, expensive and, as things turned out, totally disastrous tryst."|"Rumpole Misbehaves"|"John Mortimer"
"ap ~ 00:15"|"About a quarter past twelve"|"‘What time did you phone Flyte Street?’
‘About a quarter past twelve.’
‘You weren’t in the phone box?’"|"Rumpole Misbehaves"|"John Mortimer"
"ap < 01:00"|"Just before one"|"‘So what time did you get to the flat?’
‘Just before one.’
‘And you’ve told us about your conversation with the maid, Anna McKinnan. Did she tell you anything else you can remember?’"|"Rumpole Misbehaves"|"John Mortimer"
"ap ~ 01:30"|"About one thirty"|"‘About one thirty. I was getting worried about being late back to work. Then the maid locked me in.’"|"Rumpole Misbehaves"|"John Mortimer"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"I then sat down and saw the lonely figure on the bench look, I thought a little desperately, at the clock, from which he seemed to get some encouragement. ‘I’m looking at the time,’ he told us unnecessarily. ‘I’ll give my decision at two o’clock.’"|"Rumpole Misbehaves"|"John Mortimer"
"> 00:00"|"just after midnight"|"‘I was keeping observation from a side street just opposite when I was rewarded by the arrival of a lorry just after midnight. The garage door was left open and some men were there who helped the lorry driver unload packing cases, which were moved into the garage.’"|"Rumpole Misbehaves"|"John Mortimer"
04:00|"four a.m."|"After the garage doors were closed, Fig thought he heard male and female voices. He kept observation until four a.m., when a large van-like car, which Fig described as a ‘people carrier’, arrived. Three girls emerged from the garage and were helped into the vehicle."|"Rumpole Misbehaves"|"John Mortimer"
"~ 13:00"|"Around one pm"|"‘The most important thing,’ I told my client, ‘is to remember the times. We worked them out the last time I was here. Twelve fifteen you made a telephone call from the office. And you arrived at the flat in Flyte Street at…’
‘Around one pm.’

At four forty-five a people carrier drove up to your house in Beechwood Grove. Two girls were delivered to you. My witness will identify you as the lady who opened the door to them and let them into your house. Are you really going to tell us that they came to you for spiritual healing?’"|"Rumpole Misbehaves"|"John Mortimer"
"ap < 01:00"|"shortly before one o’clock"|"Anna McKinnan was the first, and the most dangerous, witness for the prosecution. To remind you of her evidence, she testified that Wetherby arrived at the flat in Flyte Street shortly before one o’clock. After he’d paid her £110 she told him that the young lady wasn’t with anyone else and he could go into the small sitting room and wait for her. If she didn’t appear in a reasonable time he should knock on the bedroom door and she would call for him to come in. About twenty minutes later she heard Wetherby call out. She went in and found him standing by the bed. Ludmilla was lying across the bed, and she could see red marks around her neck."|"Rumpole Misbehaves"|"John Mortimer"
