"< 19:28"|"before 1928"|"It must hold its readers engrossed, for it has overcome that strange name on the cover, “Krakow,” a city by no means well known to tourists and before 1928 never used in a book for boys and girls. And neither school histories nor legends had celebrated a king so oddly named as “Kazimir Jagiello.” But Mr. Kelly makes us share his own fascination for medieval Poland; he makes that strange, ancient city as real and exciting as he does his colorful cast of people. We are transported into a world of alchemists and armored knights, of a kind priest and a fearful villain, all seen through the eyes of young Joseph. With him, we watch the great king do justice to his family, and see the wildly dramatic end of that fateful, ancient treasure, the “Great Tarnov Crystal.”"|"The Trumpeter of Krakow"|"Eric Philbrook Kelly"
12:00|noon|"“That intoxication never left me. And later when I came back to study I did not let one day pass without spending some time within the walls of that church. I went there morning, noon, and night; late night, too, and very early morning. . . . I love it. It has sheltered every mood that my spirit has known and it has expressed every joy that there is in me.”"|"The Trumpeter of Krakow"|"Eric Philbrook Kelly"
12:00|noon|"The stranger that they had left in the mud by the roadside that morning stood by the side of the wagon with a crowd of ruffians at his heels, threatening and shouting at Pan Andrew and his wife. The stranger carried a huge club, and the ruffians, of whom he appeared to be the leader, were armed with staves and stones and were shouting angrily, as if intent on harming the man and woman above them. Pan Andrew, in facing them, had stepped in front of his wife, to shield her if stones were thrown; and the sight of the resistance, and the cries of the leader and his attackers, soon brought a huge crowd surging about the wagon, for it was now close on to noon, and the morning’s business of the market was well-nigh finished and many citizens and farmers were eating or resting in the shade of the trees about the square."|"The Trumpeter of Krakow"|"Eric Philbrook Kelly"
12:00|noonday|"“I will tell you everything,” said the father as they sat down to the noonday meal. “This oath which I have sworn is the customary oath taken by the watchman-trumpeter of the tower of the Church of Our Lady Mary. You may read it at your leisure. The music is the hymn with the broken note of which I have promised to tell you the story soon. It is played each hour from the windows in the octagon room at the top of the higher tower.”"|"The Trumpeter of Krakow"|"Eric Philbrook Kelly"
12:00|noon|"Pan Andrew fitted his key to the lock of the door leading into the inner room and threw back the bolt. Entering after his father, Joseph found himself in a small comfortable room containing a table, a bed, a small stove, and a lighted lantern hanging on the wall. About the table were three chairs, wedged rather tightly because of the lack of space, and upon the table was a huge hourglass, one of the largest that Joseph had ever seen. The sand pouring through it in a fine stream had filled the lower section almost to a level graded on the glass with a Latin “X” to designate the tenth hour. The glass was in reality a twelve-hour glass, and lines and Latin numerals had been marked upon it just after the maker had blown it into shape, when the material was still soft. This was the trumpeter’s official clock. There was on the south side of the nave roof, where the sun touched at all hours of the day, a large sundial which was read each noon, and on the north wall of the tower was a clock with one hand. This hand, which indicated the hours, was in truth a hand—a piece of metal shaped like a double fist—with fingers curled and the index pointing out to the hours."|"The Trumpeter of Krakow"|"Eric Philbrook Kelly"
02:00|"two o’clock in the morning"|"There is, then, some mischief afoot, he decided. Doorkeepers do not let honest visitors into any house at two o’clock in the morning."|"The Trumpeter of Krakow"|"Eric Philbrook Kelly"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"I am perhaps magnifying things, he finally concluded. More than likely two o’clock on the morrow was meant. Besides, I myself could give any marauder here a very warm reception—he glanced about the loft. The thought seemed to please him, for he chuckled for the space of a moment, and then turned seriously to his work."|"The Trumpeter of Krakow"|"Eric Philbrook Kelly"
02:30|vigils|"Joseph, knowing this, took to visiting him in the night vigils when it was possible, before holy days and vacations when there was no collegium on the following morning; often he would come with his father at the tenth hour of the night and remain until morning. Sometimes he would take the duties of the watchman while his father slept and sound the Heynals at each hour and inspect the city regularly from each of the tower windows in order to sound the alarm whenever a red tongue of flame leaped into the sky. Joseph had progressed each day in playing the trumpet and could now sound the Heynal as well as his father."|"The Trumpeter of Krakow"|"Eric Philbrook Kelly"
00:00|midnight|"It was a superstitious age, an age when people believed that powers of evil could be called upon, like human beings, to perform certain dark deeds—that souls of the dead forever haunted certain lonely places on earth and would answer a question if one but knew how to address them. If a black cat crossed one’s path, then bad luck was sure to follow; if an owl hooted at exactly midnight from the tower of some deserted church, then the witches were riding through the air on brooms or branches; if a dog howled in the night, it was a sign that someone living near by was about to die."|"The Trumpeter of Krakow"|"Eric Philbrook Kelly"
