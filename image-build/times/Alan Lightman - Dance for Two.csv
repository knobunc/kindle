"~ 12:00"|"Around noon"|"IT IS A SATURDAY IN MARCH. The man wakes up slowly, reaches over and feels the windowpane, and decides it is warm enough to skip his thermal underwear. He yawns and dresses and goes out for his morning jog. When he comes back, he showers, cooks himself a scrambled egg, and settles down on the sofa with The Essays of E. B. White. Around noon, he rides his bike to the bookstore. He spends a couple of hours there, just poking around the books. Then he pedals back through the little town, past his house, and to the lake."|"Dance for Two"|"Alan Lightman"
"ap < 06:00"|"SHORTLY BEFORE SIX O’CLOCK"|"SHORTLY BEFORE SIX O’CLOCK on Thursday morning, December 6, 1979, someone’s dog, let loose, ran yelping down Embarcadero Road in Palo Alto, turned right on Waverley, and dropped from fatigue and boredom near the intersection of Santa Rita Avenue, having woken all sleepers within earshot. It was still dark. Lights blinked on one by one along the animal’s path, people groped for robes and went to the toilet, and another day began."|"Dance for Two"|"Alan Lightman"
"ap 10:30"|"half past ten"|"By this time it was half past ten. Students and student-types were beginning to hang around Printer’s Inc., a bookstore on California Avenue with a coffee bar and classical music in the background. A well-fleshed man in corduroys was thumbing through Diet for a Small Planet, wondering what to serve at his vegetarian dinner party."|"Dance for Two"|"Alan Lightman"
"~ 12:00"|"Around noon"|"Guth started work with coffee. His colleagues on the third floor shared a community coffeepot for $3 a month per person. Around noon, after placing an anxious phone call about a possible job for the coming year, Guth went with two friends to lunch at the New Leaf. Afterward, back in his office, he wrote some correspondence—he did all his writing with a Radiograph pen, with its bold, neat lines—and later discussed magnetic monopoles and cosmology with a colleague. At six o’clock Guth pedaled home. Cedar, Camino de Los Robles, Monterey, Manzanita, Camino a Los Cerros. He knew the side streets on his route. In fifteen minutes he was home, had a broiled steak, medium rare, and after dinner he and his wife did laundry. He was out of underwear."|"Dance for Two"|"Alan Lightman"

Sometime between eleven and twelve o’clock, sitting at his study desk with only pen and paper, Guth discovered mathematical evidence that, contrary to previous theories, the infant universe ten billion years ago underwent a fantastically rapid expansion, just after which the matter that was to form atoms and galaxies and people came into being."|"Dance for Two"|"Alan Lightman"

19:48|"nineteen forty-eight"|"We went through a series of questions and answers, with his asking the questions and my giving the answers. He asked when I was born. “December third, nineteen forty-eight,” I replied. “You mean to tell me that you won’t be born for sixty-eight years?” he asked in a steady voice. I stopped and figured. “Yes, that’s right,” I said. “I understand. I understand,” Phineas said with a pained expression, and scribbled on his yellow pad. It went on like that for half an hour."|"Dance for Two"|"Alan Lightman"
10:13|"10:13 A.M."|"After some hasty inquiries, we walked to the telegraph office and wired Menlo Park, New Jersey, where Edison worked night and day in his lab. An hour later we got a return message, which Phineas wouldn’t let me read but which said something to the effect that we could go to hell and back unless I could help Edison with his lighting system for New York City. My attorney looked at me searchingly, and I said, “Certainly.” This was no time to lose confidence. Phineas wired back that single word, and, within another hour, we received a second message saying that Edison would be arriving on the New York & New England line at 10:13 A.M., August 16."|"Dance for Two"|"Alan Lightman"
"ap 00:33"|"twelve thirty-three"|"Then Edison arrived. “Where’s Phineas Howe?” he boomed, walking down the center aisle. The bailiff started to intercept him, but the judge raised his hand. There was a reverent hush, as everyone turned to get a glimpse of Thomas Alva Edison. Finally, a court attendant led him to our seats. Edison was a barrel-chested man with burning blue eyes. He gave me an odd look and said to Phineas, “Make this goddamned fast. I’m leaving on the twelve thirty-three.”"|"Dance for Two"|"Alan Lightman"
20:00|"8:00 P.M."|"The drawing was made on December 1 at 8:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time. Only the day before, on a Sunday, I had returned from Thanksgiving vacation and a grand dinner with my parents and brothers and cousins. After dinner, my mother, determined to be gay, placed a bossa nova album on the record player and made all of us dance with her barefoot in the living room. Now, a few evenings later, I sat anxiously with my roommates in our comfortable Ivy League dormitory room, listening to the radio. The scent of marijuana hung in the air. I imagined millions of other young men, short-order cooks in hamburger joints and gas station attendants trying to close for the night and other students in their rooms, all listening to their radios. Three hundred and sixty-six capsules were plucked from a cylindrical glass bowl in a government room in Washington, D.C. The first birthday chosen was September 14. I didn’t know anyone born on that day, but I felt sorry for the poor devils. My birth date was chosen 280 draws later. I was never called. About a quarter of my classmates ended up in some kind of military service, that year or later."|"Dance for Two"|"Alan Lightman"
