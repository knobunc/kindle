02:00|"two in the morning"|"""Well, it's two in the morning, kiddo. Another hour and I would have had the police out after you. Where were you, Ponyboy?""--- his voice was rising--- ""Where in the almighty universe were you?"""|"The Outsiders"|"S. E. Hinton"
02:30|"two-thirty in the morning"|"Nobody was around at two-thirty in the morning, and it was a good place to relax and cool off. I couldn't have gotten much cooler without turning into a popsicle. Johnny snapped up his jeans jacket and flipped up the collar."|"The Outsiders"|"S. E. Hinton"
"ap < 06:30"|"ALMOST six-thirty"|"IT WAS ALMOST six-thirty when I got home. The rumble was set for seven, so I was late for supper, as usual. I always come in late. I forget what time it is. Darry had cooked dinner: baked chicken and potatoes and corn--- two chickens because all three of us eat like horses. Especially Darry. But although I love baked chicken, I could hardly swallow any. I swallowed five aspirins, though, when Darry and Soda weren't looking. I do that all the time because I can't sleep very well at night. Darry thinks I take just one, but I usually take four. I figured five would keep me going through the rumble and maybe get rid of my headache."|"The Outsiders"|"S. E. Hinton"
