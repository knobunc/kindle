         got a name at all, drinking beer and watching a kind of stage show. At the Sphinx they had picked up a pilot from Thirty-three
         squadron, who said that his name was William. He was about the same age as Stuffy, but his face was younger, for he had not
         been flying so long. It was especially around his mouth that he was younger. He had a round schoolboy face and a small turned-up

         a line between Yanina and Karava. It pointed towards Athens, so I signalled the ‘readiness’ crew to scramble, and they took off and circled the city. Later they saw a
         Ju-88 on reconnaissance high above them, but they never caught it. It was in such a way that one worked the radar."|"Over to You"|"Roald Dahl"

         was to fly in formation low over the city in order to show the inhabitants how strong we were and how many aircraft we had. Eighteen of us took off. We flew in tight formation up and down the main streets just above the roofs of the
         houses. I could see the people looking up, shielding their eyes from the sun, looking at us as we flew over, and in one street
         I saw an old woman who never looked up at all. None of them waved, and I knew then that they were resigned to their fate.

         lips and breathed in quickly; it was cooler that way. The sun was upon our shoulders and upon our backs, and all the time
         the sweat seeped out from our skin, trickled down our necks, over our chests and down our stomachs. It collected just where
         our belts were tight around the tops of our trousers and it filtered under the tightness of our belts where the wet was very
