Early in the 20th century, before the establishment of widespread vaccination programs, it was one of the most feared illnesses, and it remains a significant cause of death in developing countries. Compared to other vaccines, the pertussis vaccine isn't actually very effective at conferring immunity to any one individual. The stan-dard infant schedule calls for four shots. After the first shot, about 30% become immune; after two, 50%; and even after all four shots have been administered, only about 90% of individuals have enough antibodies to fight off the disease."|"Liars and Outliers"|"Bruce Schneier"

Depth. More sandwich options.
Size. Larger or smaller sandwiches.
Time. Breakfast sandwiches or sandwiches for midnight snacks.
Scope. Sandwich-like things, such as hot dogs, bagels, wraps, and muffins.
Accessories. Chips and sodas, groceries.
Service. Sandwich subscriptions, delivery, free wi-fi to go along with the sandwiches.

All this makes it much more difficult to enforce the basic societal dilemmas of a market economy. On the face of it, as a seller diversifies, he is now stuck in multiple different societal dilemmas: one with the other sandwich sellers in the market, and another with—for example—chip sellers. But by tying the two products together, perhaps selling a sandwich and chips together, or offering a once-a-week chip subscription with the purchase of a sandwich subscription, he is able to play the two societal dilemmas off each other, taking advantage of both."|"Liars and Outliers"|"Bruce Schneier"
