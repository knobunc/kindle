“Hey; calm down. It’s about two and a half millennia away.”
He sat back, closing his eyes. The car started to slow down."|"The Player of Games"|"Iain M. Banks"
"< 12:00"|"before midday"|"Thinking that perhaps he’d missed something, he played a couple of more exploratory cards, and only then did the priest start
         to play for the end. Gurgeh resumed, and when the game finished before midday he held more points than anybody else."|"The Player of Games"|"Iain M. Banks"
"< 00:00"|"almost to midnight"|"After a great struggle, almost to midnight, Gurgeh finished fractionally ahead. He slept seven hours and woke up just in time
         to get ready for the next day’s play. He forced himself awake, glanding the Culture’s favorite breakfast drug, Snap, and was a little disappointed to see Ram looked just as fresh and energetic as he felt."|"The Player of Games"|"Iain M. Banks"

         At that speed even its heavy-duty displacer will only be within range for about a fifth of a millisecond, so we’re going to
         need all the help we can get. This is a very dubious situation you’re putting me and yourself in, Gurgeh. I want you to know
         I’m not very happy about it.”"|"The Player of Games"|"Iain M. Banks"
00:00|midnight|"A hushed feeling lay over the ancient fortress; a religious mood of awed anticipation which even Gurgeh would experience as
         a tangible change in the place. The swooshings of returning aircars, coming in over a damped-down swathe of forest to the
         castle, reminded Gurgeh that everybody was supposed to be in the castle by midnight, and he went back slowly, drinking in
         the atmosphere of still expectation like something precious that could not last for long, or perhaps ever be again."|"The Player of Games"|"Iain M. Banks"
00:00|midnight|"Still, he wasn’t tired; the pleasant fatigue from his swim had become just a sort of background tingle in his body, and so
         when he climbed the stairs to the level of his room, he didn’t stop, but kept going up, even as the horn sounded to announce
         midnight."|"The Player of Games"|"Iain M. Banks"
