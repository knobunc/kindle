"< 12:00"|"nearly noon"|"It was nearly noon on the second and last day of her trial. I was the final witness for the defense. Her attorney had finished questioning me. The deputy D.A. waived cross-examination, and several of the jurors looked at him with puzzled frowns. The judge said I could go."|"The Chill"|"Ross Macdonald"
12:00|noon|"“He said he had a sentimental interest. He saw it in the paper, and it reminded him of somebody. I remember thinking he must have dashed right over. The paper with the picture in it came out Sunday morning, and he came in around Sunday noon.”"|"The Chill"|"Ross Macdonald"
"ap ~ 03:00"|"Around three o’clock"|"“About what time?”
“Around three o’clock.”
“Did he have any money?”"|"The Chill"|"Ross Macdonald"
"ap 09:17"|nine-seventeen|"I looked in. Helen was lying on her side behind the door. Blood had run from a round bullet hole in her forehead and formed a pool on the tiles. It was coagulating at the edges, like frost on a dark puddle. I touched her sad face. She was already turning cold. It was nine-seventeen by my watch."|"The Chill"|"Ross Macdonald"
"ap 09:31"|nine-thirty-one|"As if we had each received a signal on a common wave-length, we turned and looked at Helen Haggerty’s body. It seemed small and lonely at the far end of the room. Our joint flight with it through cloudy space had been going on for a long time. I looked at my watch. It was only nine-thirty-one, fourteen minutes since our arrival. Time seemed to have slowed down, dividing itself into innumerable fractions, like Zeno’s space or marijuana hours."|"The Chill"|"Ross Macdonald"
00:00|midnight|"I had a pint of whisky in my bag. I was getting it out of its sock when I thought of Arnie Walters, a Reno colleague of mine who had split more than one pint with me. I put in a long-distance call to his office, which happened to be the front room of his house. Arnie was at home.
“Walters Detective Agency,” he said in a reluctant midnight voice.
“This is Lew Archer.”"|"The Chill"|"Ross Macdonald"
03:00|"three o’clock in the morning"|"“The fact that her father murdered her mother.” It was cruel to hit him with it again, on top of everything else. Still it was better for him to hear it from me than from the dreary voice that talks from under the twisted pillow at three o’clock in the morning. “Apparently he was tried and convicted in the local courts. Sheriff Crane probably gathered the evidence for the prosecution.”"|"The Chill"|"Ross Macdonald"
01:00|"one o’clock in the morning"|"“Hello, Mr. Archer. And who are you, may I ask, at one o’clock in the morning?” It wasn’t a light question. The woman sounded anxious and irritated, but she had both feelings under reasonable control."|"The Chill"|"Ross Macdonald"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"She hesitated. “Yes, if it’s important. I’ll get up an hour earlier and do my paperwork. I’ll be at home at eleven. You have my address? It’s just off the main street of Indian Springs.”"|"The Chill"|"Ross Macdonald"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"The nursing home was a beige stucco one-storied building taking up most of a narrow deep lot. I rang the bell at eight o’clock precisely. Dr. Godwin must have been waiting behind the door. He unlocked it and let me in himself."|"The Chill"|"Ross Macdonald"
11:00|"eleven o’clock in the morning"|"A rather imposing woman in a blue dress came out on the veranda. She looked me over as if I might possibly be a burglar cleverly creeping up on her house at eleven o’clock in the morning. She came down the steps and along the walk toward me. The sun flashed on her glasses and lent her searchlight eyes."|"The Chill"|"Ross Macdonald"
"ap > 09:00"|"past nine o’clock"|"“Yes, and Dolly. The child was here in the house with Constance. They’d been living with me for some months. It was past nine o’clock, and she’d already gone to bed. Constance was downstairs sewing. My sister was a fine seamstress, and she made most of the child’s clothes. She was making a dress for her that night. It got all spotted with blood. They made it an exhibit at the trial.”"|"The Chill"|"Ross Macdonald"
"ap 06:30"|six-thirty|"“I have no time to go into all that again. There are classes which must be met on Monday. If this Dr. de Falla doesn’t arrive, or proves impossible, I don’t know what to do.” He peered at his wristwatch. “I’m due at the Los Angeles airport at six-thirty.”"|"The Chill"|"Ross Macdonald"
"ap 06:30"|six-thirty|"“Yes, I phoned her mother early this morning. Dean Bradshaw asked me to perform that duty, though properly I should think it was his duty. The mother, Mrs. Hoffman, is flying out here and I have to meet her at the Los Angeles airport.”
“At six-thirty?”
He nodded dismally. “There seems to be no one else available. Both of our deans are out of town—”"|"The Chill"|"Ross Macdonald"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"“I reserved her a room at the Pacific Hotel. I could meet you there, at eight, say.”"|"The Chill"|"Ross Macdonald"
"ap 06:25"|six-twenty-five|"IT WAS A SLOW DRIVE up the coast but the fog lifted before I reached the airport, leaving a thickish twilight in the air. I parked my car at the United building. It was exactly six-twenty-five, according to the ticket the girl in the parking lot handed me. I crossed the road to the bright enormous building and found the baggage carrousel, besieged by travelers."|"The Chill"|"Ross Macdonald"
"ap < 11:00"|"nearly eleven"|"It was time I went to Reno. I looked at my watch: nearly eleven: and remembered that I would gain time on the flight west. I could still have a talk with Luke Deloney’s widow, if she was available, and get to Reno at a reasonable hour."|"The Chill"|"Ross Macdonald"
"ap 08:29"|eight-twenty-nine|"Mrs. Sally Burke lived close in on Riley Street, in the upper flat of an old two-story house. Phyllis dropped me off in front of it at eight-twenty-nine, having extracted my promise to come back and spend the night with Arnie and her. Mrs. Burke was waiting in full panoply on the upper landing: tight black sheath with foxes, pearls and earrings, four-inch heels. Her hair was mingled brown and blonde, as if to express the complexity of her personality. Her brown eyes appraised me, as I came up to her level, the way an antebellum plantation owner might look over an able-bodied slave on the auction block."|"The Chill"|"Ross Macdonald"
"ap ~ 09:00"|"about nine"|"“I don’t think so, Jud. I ran into you, or you ran into me, about nine last Friday night in Pacific Point.”"|"The Chill"|"Ross Macdonald"
00:00|midnight|"Arnie put the car in gear and as we drove west and south along the lakeshore, recounted a long story about a client he had handled for Pinkerton in San Francisco before the war. She was a well-heeled widow of sixty or so who lived in Hillsborough with her son, a man in his thirties. The son was always home by midnight, but seldom before, and the mother wanted to know what he was doing with his evenings. It turned out he had been married for five years to an ex-waitress whom he maintained, with their three small children, in a row house in South San Francisco."|"The Chill"|"Ross Macdonald"
03:00|"three o’clock in the morning"|"Phyllis was waiting for us with food and drink. We sat up in her kitchen foolishly late, getting mildly drunk on beer and shared memories and exhaustion. Eventually the conversation came full circle, back to Helen Haggerty and her death. At three o’clock in the morning I was reading aloud her translated poem in the Bridgeton Blazer about the violins of the autumn winds."|"The Chill"|"Ross Macdonald"
"ap 03:30"|"half-past three"|"I tried to tell them about the tough old drunken heartbroken cop who had sired Helen. Suddenly it was half-past three and Phyllis was asleep with her head resting like a tousled dahlia among the bottles on the kitchen table. Arnie began gathering up the bottles, carefully, so as not to wake her unnecessarily soon."|"The Chill"|"Ross Macdonald"
"~ 12:00"|"AROUND NOON"|"AROUND NOON I walked into Jerry Marks’s store-front office. His secretary told me that Monday was the day for the weekly criminal docket and Jerry had spent the morning in court. He was probably having lunch somewhere near the courthouse. Yes, Mr. Kincaid had got in touch with Mr. Marks on Sunday, and retained him."|"The Chill"|"Ross Macdonald"
"ap > 02:00"|"past two o’clock"|"It was past two o’clock, and my instinct told me this was the crucial day. I felt cut off from what was happening in the private offices of the courthouse, in the shooting gallery and laboratory where the ballistics tests were being conducted, behind the locked door of the nursing home. Time was slipping away, flowing past me like Heraclitus’ river, while I was checking up on the vagaries of old ladies."|"The Chill"|"Ross Macdonald"
"ap 02:50"|"ten minutes to three"|"I went back to the telephone booths behind the hotel lobby and called Godwin’s office. The doctor was with a patient, and wouldn’t be available until ten minutes to three. I tried Jerry Marks. His secretary told me he was still out."|"The Chill"|"Ross Macdonald"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"“Tonight at eight, at the nursing home. Dr. Godwin isn’t free till then.”"|"The Chill"|"Ross Macdonald"
"ap ~ 07:00"|"about seven o’clock"|"“We had a little emergency. Thomas McGee was arrested about seven o’clock tonight. Mr. Archer happened to be with him, and he was arrested, also.”"|"The Chill"|"Ross Macdonald"
"ap 01:00"|one|"Her eyes darted around the lobby, shyly and shamefully. There was no one in sight but the night clerk and a couple who didn’t look married renting a room from him. But Mrs. Hoffman was as nervous as a cricket on a crowded floor."|"The Chill"|"Ross Macdonald"
