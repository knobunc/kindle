"> 01:00"|"An Hour After Midnight"|"HERMANN HESSEHermann Hesse, the Nobel Prize-winning novelist, poet, and critic who enjoyed a cultlike readership among young people during the 1960s, was born in the quiet Black Forest town of Calw, Germany, on July 2, 1877. He was the son and grandson of Protestant clergymen who had served as missionaries in India. Hesse attended the parochial mission school where his father taught and later the Latin school in Göppingen. Having vowed “to be a poet or nothing at all,” the headstrong youth fled the seminary in Maulbronn at the age of fourteen. Thereafter Hesse rebelled against all attempts at formal schooling. Instead he pursued a rigorous program of self-study that focused on literature, philosophy, and history and eventually found employment at the Heckenhauer Bookshop in the university town of Tübingen.In 1899 Hesse published Romantische Lieder (Romantic Songs), his first book of poetry, and Eine Stunde hinter Mitternacht (An Hour After Midnight), a series of prose poems hailed by Rainer Maria Rilke as standing “on the periphery of art.” Hesse spent the next several years working as a clerk at bookstores in cosmopolitan Basel, where he studied art history and the writings of the Swiss cultural historian Jacob Burckhardt.Hesse brought out his first novel, Peter Camenzind, in 1904. Translated into English in 1969, this story of a failed writer who embarks on a journey to discover the world became the prototype for much of his fiction. Its success enabled him to marry and start a family in the idyllic German village of Gaienhofen. His second novel, Unterm Rad (1906; translated as Beneath the Wheel m 1968), proved equally popular. The tale of a gifted adolescent crushed by the brutal expectations of his father and teachers, it was proclaimed a “Black Forest Catcher in the Rye” by The National Observer. Hesse next pondered the sources of creativity in Gertrud (1910; translated as Gertrude in 1955), a novel of self-appraisal that strongly resembles early works by Thomas Mann. Chronic wanderlust coupled with growing discontent over his bucolic Rousseau-like existence took him on a formative trip to the East Indies in 1911. Hesse’s troubled domestic life provided the basis for Rosshalde (1914; translated as Rosshalde 1970), the classic tale of a man torn between obligations to his family and the longing for a spiritual fulfillment that exists outside the confines of conventional society. The Christian Science Monitor called it “a kind of disguised biography, an account of Hesse’s quite private turmoil on the eve of war.”The outbreak of World War I brought a sharp change in Hesse’s fortunes. An outspoken pacifist, he volunteered for service at the German consulate in Bern and devoted himself to relief work for German internees and prisoners of war. “The protest against the war, against the raw, bloodthirsty stupidity of mankind, the protest against the ‘intellectuals,’ especially those who preached war, constituted for me a bitter necessity and duty,” Hesse later observed. Yet a series of articles on war and politics written at the time alienated the generally conservative and nationalistic public that had bought his books up until then.During this same period Hesse endured two personal tragedies, the death of his father and the collapse of his marriage. In 1916 he suffered a complete nervous breakdown and entered a sanatorium near Lucerne to undergo psychoanalysis with a disciple of Carl Jung’s. Seeking isolation, Hesse settled by himself in Montagnola, a remote mountain village on the outskirts of Lugano in southeastern Switzerland, in the spring of 1919.The publication of Demian that same year (it appeared in English in 1923) brought Hesse immediate acclaim throughout Europe. Based on his experience with Jungian analysis, this breakthrough novel launched a series of works chronicling the Weg nach Innen (inward journey) that he hoped would lead to self-knowledge. In the existential tradition of Nietzsche and Dostoevsky, Hesse portrays the turmoil of a docile young man who is forced to question traditional bourgeois beliefs regarding family, society, and faith. “The electrifying influence exercised on a whole generation just after the First World War by Demian… is unforgettable,” recalled Thomas Mann. “With uncanny accuracy this poetic work struck the nerve of the times and called forth grateful rapture from a whole youthful generation who believed that an interpreter of their innermost life had risen from their own midst.” “The autobiographical undercurrent gives Demian an Existentialist intensity and a depth of understanding rare in contemporary fiction,” said the Saturday Review. “Hesse is not a traditional teller of tales but a novelist of ideas and a moralist of a high order.”“Almost all the prose works I have written are biographies of the soul,” Hesse asserted, “monologues in which a single individual is observed in relation to the world and to his own ego.” Exploring the oriental religious concepts that became central to his work, he wrote Siddhartha (1922; translated into English in 1951), which recounts the spiritual evolution of a man living in India at the time of Buddha. Perhaps more than any other of his novels, Siddhartha reflects Hesse’s belief that “the true profession of man is to find his way himself.” “For me, Siddhartha is a more potent medicine than the New Testament,” said Henry Miller; Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., deemed it Hesse’s “simplest, clearest, most innocent tale of seeking and finding.”Hesse again utilized the tools of psychoanalysis in Der Steppenwolf‘(1927’; translated as Steppenwolf in 1929), a novel that probes the “two souls” of a reclusive intellectual whose animalistic urges strive for release. Inspired by the dissolute aftermath of Hesse’s failed second marriage to a much younger woman, it is arguably his most autobiographical book, one hailed by The New York Times as “a savage indictment of bourgeois society.” Hesse pursued similar themes in Narziss und Goldmund (1930; translated as Narcissus and Goldmund 1968) by presenting parallel biographies of an ascetic monk and a rapturous man of the world. Thomas Mann called Narcissus and Goldmund “a poetic novel unique in its purity and fascination.” The New York Times Book Review agreed. “What makes this short book so limitlessly vast is the body-and-soul-shaking debate that runs through it, which it has the honesty and courage not to resolve: between the flesh and the spirit, art and scientific or religious speculation, action and contemplation, between the wayfaring and the sedentary in us.”In 1931, Hesse married for a third time and moved to a new home in Montagnola. His happiness is reflected in Die Morgenlandfahrt (1932; translated as The Journey to the East m 1957), a personal fairy tale in which he reaffirms his belief in the superiority of the realms of art and thought. With Hitler’s rise to power, Hesse (by then a Swiss citizen) began harboring Jewish refugees and blacklisted artists fleeing the Third Reich. Soon his work was declared “undesirable” in Nazi Germany. In 1932 he started writing the futuristic novel that endures as his magnum opus. Published in 1943, Das Glasperlenspiel (translated as The Glass Bead Game in 1969) takes place in the year 2400 in a Utopian land where artists and intellectuals strive to attain “perfection, pure being, the fullness of reality.” “The sublime work of [Hesse’s] old age, The Glass Bead Game [is] drawn from all sources of human culture, both East and West,” observed Thomas Mann. “This chaste and daring work, full of fantasy and at the same time highly intellectual, is full of tradition, loyalty, memory, secrecy—without being in the least derivative.” Admired as well by T. S. Eliot and André Gide, it is widely seen as the key to a full understanding of Hesse’s thought.Hesse was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1946. Krieg und Frieden, his lifelong reflections on war and politics, came out the same year; in 1971 it appeared in English as If the War Goes On. One of Europe’s grand old men of letters, Hesse spent his final years in seclusion at Montagnola compiling volumes of his poetry, essays, and correspondence. Unaware that he was suffering from leukemia, Hermann Hesse died in his sleep from a cerebral hemorrhage on August 9, 1962. “The entire work of Hesse is a poetic effort for emancipation,” said André Gide. “In each of [his books] I refind the same indecision of soul; its contours are illusive and its aspirations, infinite.” Hesse’s longtime friend and countryman Thomas Mann remarked, “For me his lifework, with its roots in native German romanticism, for all its occasional strange individualism, its now humorously petulant and now mystically yearning estrangement from the world and the times, belongs to the highest and purest spiritual aspirations and labors of our epoch.”Hesse’s call for self-realization coupled with his celebration of Eastern mysticism earned him a huge following among America’s counterculture in the decade after his death. “Rarely, since a generation of young Europeans decked themselves out in the blue frock coat and yellow vest of Goethe’s Werther, has the youth culture of an age responded so rapturously to a writer,” observed the Hesse scholar Theodore Ziolkowski in 1973. Hesse “is deeply loved by those among the American young who are questing,” wrote Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. “The wanderers of Hesse always find something satisfying—holiness, wisdom, hope.” And the London Times Literary Supplement concluded, “The Hesse we read today is in fact no longer the bittersweet elegist of Wilhelmine Germany, the anguished intellectual entre deux guerres, the serene hermit of Montagnola après Nobel. The cult has adjusted the kaleidoscope of Hesse’s works in such a way as to bring into focus a Hesse for the 1970s: environmentalist, war opponent, enemy of a computerized technocracy, who seeks heightened awareness… and who is prepared to sacrifice anything but his integrity for the sake of his freedom.”"|Siddhartha|"Hermann Hesse"
12:00|noon|"“Will you remain standing here, waiting, until day comes, noon comes, evening comes?”"|Siddhartha|"Hermann Hesse"
12:00|noonday|"When the sun rose, they were astonished to see what a great crowd of believers and onlookers had spent the night here. On all the paths of the splendid grove, monks were strolling in their yellow robes; they sat here and there beneath the trees, absorbed in contemplation or in spiritual conversation, the shady gardens like a city to behold, full of people swarming like bees. Most of these monks were setting out with their alms bowls to collect food in town for their noonday meal, the one meal of the day. Even the Buddha himself, the Enlightened One, was in the habit of going to beg for food each morning."|Siddhartha|"Hermann Hesse"
"~ 12:00"|"Around noon"|"Around noon he passed through a village. In front of the mud huts, children were rolling about in the street, playing with pumpkin seeds and shells, shouting and scrapping, but all of them ran away, shy before the unknown Samana. At the end of the village the path led through a stream, and at the edge of the stream a young woman knelt, washing clothes. When Siddhartha greeted her, she raised her head and looked up at him with a smile that made the whites of her eyes flash. He called out a blessing to her, as is customary among travelers, and asked how much farther it was to the city. She stood up and came over to him, her moist lips shimmering and beautiful in her young face. She engaged him in banter, asking if he had eaten yet and if it was true that the Samanas slept alone in the forest at night and were not allowed to have women with them. As she spoke, she placed her left foot upon his right and made the gesture a woman makes when she is inviting a man to indulge in the sort of love pleasure the instructional books call “climbing the tree.” Siddhartha felt his blood grow warm, and as his dream returned to him at this moment, he bent down before the woman and kissed the brown tip of her breast. Looking up, he saw desire in her smiling face, and her half-closed eyes beseeched him longingly."|Siddhartha|"Hermann Hesse"
">> 00:00"|"long after midnight"|"Siddhartha had spent the night in his home with dancing girls and wine, had made a show of superiority before others of his standing, though he was no longer superior, had drunk a great deal of wine, and had gone to bed long after midnight, weary and yet agitated, close to tears and despair. For a long time he sought sleep in vain, his heart full of a misery he felt he could no longer endure, full of a nausea that coursed through him like the vile, insipid taste of the wine, like the dreary all-too-sweet music, the all-too-soft smiles of the dancers, the all-too-sweet perfume of their hair and breasts. But nothing made the nausea well up in him more bitterly than did he himself He felt nausea at his perfumed hair, the smell of wine on his breath, the weary slackness and reluctance of his skin. Just as someone who has eaten or drunk too much vomits it up again in agony and yet is glad for the relief, sleepless Siddhartha yearned for a monstrous wave of nausea that would rid him of these pleasures, these habits, this whole meaningless existence and himself along with it. Only with the first rays of morning and with the first stirrings in the street outside his town house had he sunk into slumber and found a few moments of half numbness, a suggestion of sleep. During these moments he had a dream."|Siddhartha|"Hermann Hesse"
