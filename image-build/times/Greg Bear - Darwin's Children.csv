02:00|"two in the morning"|"There had been a row the night before. Mitch and Kaye and Stella, their daughter, had sat up until two in the morning in the small bedroom trying to talk it through. Stella was feeling isolated. She wanted, needed to be with young people like her. It was a reasonable position, but they had no choice."|"Darwin's Children"|"Greg Bear"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"Stella lay on her back in a bed that had been too short for over a year. At eleven, she was almost as tall as Kaye and beautiful in her slender, round-faced way, skin pale copper and tawny gold in the glow of the night-light, hair dark brown with reddish tints, same texture as Kaye's and not much longer."|"Darwin's Children"|"Greg Bear"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o'clock"|"“Stella,” she called, knocking on her daughter's bedroom door. “It's nine o'clock. We slept in.”"|"Darwin's Children"|"Greg Bear"
18:30|"six thirty in the evening"|"Trask mopped his brow with a handkerchief. “We're certainly glad to have both of you,” he said. At six thirty in the evening, the heat was slowly retreating from a high of eighty-five degrees."|"Darwin's Children"|"Greg Bear"
"ap 01:07"|107|"They held Stella and took her temperature. It was 107. Her normal temperature was 97. They frantically sponged her, working in shifts, and then moved her into the bathroom, where Kaye had filled a tub with water and ice. She was so hot. Mitch saw that she had bleeding sores in her mouth."|"Darwin's Children"|"Greg Bear"
"ap 00:50"|"Ten to one"|"“Ten to one, they want you to arrest parents who don't cooperate, get all the children where we can watch them, and do it now. Ten to one.”"|"Darwin's Children"|"Greg Bear"
"< 00:00"|"near midnight"|"“There are more out there,” said the other nurse, louder, as they walked past. “It's damned near midnight. We needed a break!”"|"Darwin's Children"|"Greg Bear"
11:00|"eleven in the morning"|"Augustine looked at his Rolex. “It's eleven in the morning there,” he said. “Can anyone in Washington get doctors out here?”"|"Darwin's Children"|"Greg Bear"
11:00|"Eleven in the morning"|"Eleven in the morning, the dashboard display said. Mitch looked left on the two-lane asphalt road and saw, about a hundred feet ahead, the red plastic strip hanging on a big old pine. He slowed and rolled down the window."|"Darwin's Children"|"Greg Bear"
22:00|"ten in the evening"|"Augustine had divided them into two teams, the first with eight students, the second with seven. Toby's team had worked first, from ten in the evening until three in the morning. Teachers and nurses carried those chosen by the team to an exercise field, laying them in rows under the blue glare of tall pole lamps, in the warm early-morning air."|"Darwin's Children"|"Greg Bear"

"ap 10:00"|"ten o'clock"|"And round into the dawn and beyond ten o'clock, the kids worked with the remaining teachers, nurses, and security officers—the bravest of the brave—carrying bodies wrapped in sheets or in the last remaining body bags, or even in doubled plastic garbage bags, out to the farthest area within the fence, the employee parking lot, where the dead were laid out between the few and scattered cars."|"Darwin's Children"|"Greg Bear"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"Middleton worked to rearrange accommodations so that they could set up a morgue in the main gymnasium, adjacent to the infirmary. By eleven, the bodies had been removed from the parking lot and placed out of the sun."|"Darwin's Children"|"Greg Bear"
12:00|noon|"At noon, Augustine fell over after stumbling, half-blind with exhaustion, between a row of inmate tents. The children carried him back to the infirmary, with the help of DeWitt."|"Darwin's Children"|"Greg Bear"
14:00|"two in the afternoon"|"At two in the afternoon, Augustine was compelled once again to go up to the office and lie down. Dicken emerged from the research lab with another bag full of specimen kits and met him there."|"Darwin's Children"|"Greg Bear"
10:00|"ten that morning"|"She knew she needed some food. She should not attend the hearing on an empty stomach, and she had not eaten since ten that morning. It was five now. Soup and sandwiches were available at a small café inside the store. But Kaye walked past the menu board without stopping, on some sort of autopilot. Her walking shoes made damp sucking sounds on the linoleum as she passed several deep aisles of bookshelves. Fluorescent lights flickered and buzzed overhead. A young man with long felted hair sat on a patched chair, half-empty knapsack crumpled in his lap, asleep. A paperback Bible lay open facedown on the arm of the chair."|"Darwin's Children"|"Greg Bear"

"ap < 05:11"|"almost five eleven"|"“So, tell us how it's-KUK done,” Celia said. She and LaShawna approached. Celia stood an inch taller than Stella, almost five eleven, and LaShawna was shorter than Miss Kinney, about five seven. Celia had the usual olive-to-brown skin and flyaway reddish hair that never seemed to know what to do or how to hold together on her head. LaShawna was darker, but not much, with finely kinked black hair that formed a slumped nimbus around her ears and down to her shoulders."|"Darwin's Children"|"Greg Bear"

"ap 11:00"|eleven|"“Perfect,” Gianelli said. He looked at a clock on the wall. It was eleven. “Where's my star witness?” He gave Kaye a lopsided smile, his expression combining both sympathy and doubt. She knew she did not look prepared. She did not feel prepared. Gianelli sneezed and walked into his office. A young male Secret Service agent closed the door and stood guard beside it, hands folded in front of him, eyes unreadable behind smoked glasses."|"Darwin's Children"|"Greg Bear"
18:00|"6 p.m."|"She glanced at her watch—6 p.m.—and looked up the roster that recorded who was in the building at this hour."|"Darwin's Children"|"Greg Bear"
"ap < 10:00"|"almost ten o'clock"|"Two and a half hours had passed; it was almost ten o'clock. Kaye had been through seven varieties of NMR, PET, and computerized tomography scans. She had been injected, shielded, injected again, rotated like a chicken on a spit, turned upside down. For a while, she wondered if Roth was bent on taking revenge for her imposition."|"Darwin's Children"|"Greg Bear"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o'clock"|"The high desert morning was warm and it was barely seven o'clock. Mitch walked across the motel parking lot, swung his bag into the battered old truck's side seat and shielded his eyes against the sun over the low, gray eastern hills. An hour to the Spent River. Half an hour to the outlying camp. He had his instructions from Eileen, and one more warning: Don't breathe a word to anyone. No students, no wives, no girlfriends, no dogs, no cats, no guinea pigs: Got it?"|"Darwin's Children"|"Greg Bear"
"ap 05:00"|"five o'clock"|"The road mesmerized him after a while, but he was jounced to full alertness when it started to get rough from washouts. The land had taken on a five o'clock stubble of trees and grass. The asphalt switched to gravel."|"Darwin's Children"|"Greg Bear"
11:00|"eleven in the morning"|"At eleven in the morning, Stella walked with all the girls from their barracks through a gate in the razor wire fence to the open field, attended by Miss Kantor and Joanie and five other adults."|"Darwin's Children"|"Greg Bear"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"Promptly at eleven, Kaye entered the Americol twentieth-floor conference room, Liz close behind. Robert Jackson was already in the room. His hair had turned salt and pepper over the years but otherwise he had not matured much either in behavior or appearance. He was still handsome, skin pale to the point of blueness, with a sharply defined nose and chin and a glossy five o'clock shadow. His quartzlike eyes, dark gray, bored into Kaye whenever they met, occasions she tried to keep to a minimum."|"Darwin's Children"|"Greg Bear"

"< 00:00"|"almost midnight"|"Eileen sat in the canvas seat of her camp chair and let out her breath in a sigh that was halfway to a shriek. But for them and the still-hidden bones, the excavation was empty. It was almost midnight. “I am dead,” she proclaimed. “I can't take this anymore. Dig ‘em out, don't dig ‘em out, keep your cool when the academics start to scrap about emergence violations. The whole goddamned human race is so primitive.”"|"Darwin's Children"|"Greg Bear"

The clock said 5:07 a.m. She could not think who could be calling her at this hour."|"Darwin's Children"|"Greg Bear"

She was hungry much of the time now, so she stood in line with the workers, hands on her stomach, trying to feel the shape beneath, but there was hardly even a bulge yet. Feeling her stomach made her a little sad. A cup of coffee would help. Caffeine made the day easier. Shevites reacted so strongly to caffeine that coffee and tea and even chocolate were only allowed between the hours of ten and five."|"Darwin's Children"|"Greg Bear"

Why go forth into the world to help an administration that had come to the table so late, after so much destruction—one of three clueless, terrible administrations in a row?"|"Darwin's Children"|"Greg Bear"
