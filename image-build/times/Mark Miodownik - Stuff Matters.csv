The supervising engineer of the building of JFK Airport noticed through routine tests that the concrete arriving on trucks before noon had good strength when it set, but that arriving just after noon was substantially weaker. Puzzled, he investigated all possible reasons for this but was unable to find the answer until he resorted to following the truck delivering the concrete on its journey to the airport. He found that around noon the driver was in the habit of taking a break for lunch and would hose the concrete with water before doing so in the belief that adding extra water would keep the concrete liquid for longer."|"Stuff Matters"|"Mark Miodownik"

"ap 10:12"|10:12|"Having collected the comet dust, the Stardust spacecraft returned to Earth, arriving back two years later. As it approached the Earth it veered away, jettisoning a Small capsule, which fell under Earth’s gravity, entering the atmosphere at a speed of 12.9 kilometers per second, the fastest re-entry speed ever recorded, and so becoming for a while a shooting star itself. After fifteen seconds of free-fall, and having reached red-hot temperatures, the capsule deployed a drogue parachute to slow down the rate of descent. A few minutes later, at a height of ten thousand feet above the Utah desert, the capsule jettisoned the drogue chute and deployed the main parachute. At this point the recovery crews on the ground had a good idea of where the capsule was going to land and headed out into the desert to welcome it back from its seven-year, four-billion-kilometer round trip. The capsule hit the sand of the Utah desert at 10:12 GMT on Sunday, January 15, 2006."|"Stuff Matters"|"Mark Miodownik"
