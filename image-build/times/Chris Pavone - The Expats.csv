She’d spent so much of her life—all of it, really—considering another question: what was it that she needed?

One of Julia’s hands was resting against the flat of her stomach, then this hand rose to her breast, cupping herself, then fell again, past stomach and down to hip, thigh. Her head was thrown back, extending her glistening neck; her eyes were hooded, open but barely, looking not at the man she was dancing with, but across the room, and not in the direction of her own disappeared husband, but in the direction, Kate knew without turning, of Dexter.

Kate had watched her struggle up the slope of the street, an interminable climb, while the woman’s mouth constantly moved, her lips pursing, her cheeks dimpling: the contortions of a native French speaker, keeping the facial muscles toned for all those nasal vowels that can be properly pronounced only with strong lips.

She’d had plenty of opportunity to learn gutter Spanish, on the streets, as well as proper Spanish, in her own home, from the low-paid babysitters whom Kate’s parents had been able to afford for after-school care, back when she and her sister were still innocent little girls, released from first or third grades at three o’clock into the waiting arms of short, round women named Rosario and Guadelupe."|"The Expats"|"Chris Pavone"
