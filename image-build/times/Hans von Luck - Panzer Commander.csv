General Gause sent word that the British had apparently been forced to make a pause, since they had to reorganize their supply routes. But another outflanking attack was expected from the legendary Lieutenant-Colonel Stirling.

Then, several officers appeared from the Nizza Battalion, which had been almost wiped out and had only one diminutive patrol fit for service that was still in action. They brought along a few bottles of Chianti and handed me letters and packets for their families in Italy, which I was to take with me. In the evening, we all squatted together under the palms.

Together with the bombing of Caen this suggested The Start of the Invasion, 6 June 1944 177 more than a commando operation. We knew the order 'to attack only on orders from the highest authority."" In spite of that, within a very short time the battalion was ready for action. Our commander, Major Waldow, was on leave. He was due back on 8 June.

The journey took longer than expected, because of the nightly supply traffic. It was not until just before nine that I was on the hills east of my combat sector. Only a few kilometers now separated me from my command post. I stopped and we searched the sky for fighters, It was very hazy over the area of operations. Everything seemed to be in order."|"Panzer Commander"|"Hans von Luck"

"~ 12:00"|"about midday"|"Back at my command post I made contact with Feuchtinger. I described the situation as it appeared to me at about midday on 18 July, and ended, “General, I believe that the whole British attack has come to a standstill, thanks to the engagement of all elements of my combat group, and thanks not least to a Luftwaffe 8.8cm battery that I found by chance at Cagny and put to use in the ground fighting. I see a great danger, however, on my right wing. If the British were to move up their infantry things would look pretty bad for my rather thin defensive front. For the moment it's all right still, but reserves ought to arrive in the course of the afternoon.”"|"Panzer Commander"|"Hans von Luck"
"< 12:00"|"before midday"|"“The Ist SS will arrive today in the late afternoon, the 12th SS not before midday tomorrow. We must hold till then.” In the late afternoon Feuchtinger came through again, “The first elements of the Ist SS have arrived. Together with them we have knocked out a lot of tanks. With, your tally the British have probably lost at least 200 tanks. I am reassured that you can hold out on the right flank. Convey my appreciation to Kurz commander of II Battalion).” In the afternoon I finally changed and at once felt better.

Our two batteries have arrived fightingsometimes parallel to the British-without loss on the hills.” Now things became critical; but the British attack was not continued and again came to a halt. It was astonishing that the attack in my sector should be so hesitant. The shock from our 8.8cm antitank guns, the few Tigers, and Becker's assault-guns seemed to have struck deep among the British. With only about 400 grenadiers left we had to hold the long front in the east."|"Panzer Commander"|"Hans von Luck"
"ap ~ 05:00"|"about five o'clock"|"Finally, about five o'clock, the first elements of the 12th SS Panzer Division arrived. A general-staff officer made contact with me, “The division has been through a costly march. We were shot up time and again by British fighters and forced into cover. The bulk of the division will be here in the course of the night. How do things look with you?” I put him in the picture and learned that my combat group was to be relieved by this division. Shortly after came the order from my own division: “in the course of the night von Luck's combat group will disengage from the enemy and hand over to the 12th SS Division. You will take up a defensive position on either side of Troarn on the east bank of the flooded Dives. Rauch's combat group will also be relieved and stationed east of the Dives.” The relief went through without difficulty. I hoped to be able to give the thoroughly overtired and battle-weary men a little rest. By “Operation Goodwood,” 18/19 July 1944 201 the late evening of 19 July it was possible to, see what the British had managed or failed to do: The little bridgehead had been extended by about 9 kilometers; Caen had now been fully occupied.
