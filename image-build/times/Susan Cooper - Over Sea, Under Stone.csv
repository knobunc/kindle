"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"“Well, he can curse away,” Barney said cheerfully. “We’ve got enough provisions for ages. I’m hungry.”
“Oh not yet, you can’t be. It’s only four o’clock.”
“Well, that’s tea-time. Anyway, when you’re on the run you eat little and often, because you daren’t ever stop for long. If we were Eskimos we’d be chewing an old shoelace. My book says—”"|"Over Sea, Under Stone"|"Susan Cooper"
"ap 02:00"|two|"“Not one name, it’s two. Que means and, only they put it on the end instead of in the middle. And o on the end is the ablative of us, so this means by with or from Marcus and Arturus.”"|"Over Sea, Under Stone"|"Susan Cooper"
"ap 09:30"|"Nine thirty"|"Mr. Withers pulled down the edges of his immaculate blazer with a precise, feminine gesture. “You’re quite right, Polly, we mustn’t be late.” He swung his white smile round the room like a lighthouse. “Vayne is our skipper—the professional on board. And an excellent chef too. You must sample his cooking tomorrow. Well now, shall we see you all down in the harbour, if the weather is fine? Nine thirty, perhaps? We will have the dinghy waiting at the quay.”"|"Over Sea, Under Stone"|"Susan Cooper"
12:00|midday|"She looked down at the bottom of the curling sheet, at the few thin wavering lines that they had thought might be a map. In the dim light of the attic there had been little there to see; but now Jane had the full white glare of midday. She bent closer, suddenly realising that there were more lines in the map than she had noticed at first; lines so faint that before she had mistaken them for cracks. And among them, fainter still, some words were written."|"Over Sea, Under Stone"|"Susan Cooper"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"“Well, perhaps this is the after-effect.” Jane’s conscience was beginning to nag. “Last night must have been an awful strain on him, what with one thing and another. I don’t think we should wake him up. It’s only nine o’clock, after all.”"|"Over Sea, Under Stone"|"Susan Cooper"
"ap ~ 11:00"|"gone eleven"|"Suddenly Great-Uncle Merry was very wide awake. He sat up straight-backed, a startling sight in his bright red pyjama jacket. “What time is it?”
“Why, ’tis gone eleven.” Mrs. Palk beamed at him.
“Where have the children gone?”"|"Over Sea, Under Stone"|"Susan Cooper"
"ap 11:30"|"half past eleven"|"“Don’t worry, I expect he’s still snoring,” Simon said. He looked at his watch. “It’s half past eleven. Let’s get down quickly before the yacht comes back. We might not be so lucky next time—if they came back under sail we shouldn’t hear them. I wonder why they didn’t last time, there’s more than enough wind.” He frowned."|"Over Sea, Under Stone"|"Susan Cooper"
"ap ~ 05:00"|"about five o’clock"|"“Oh, a long way. Th ’arbour don’t look pretty at any low tide, but it do look worse at the biggest springs. Lot of stinkin’ old mud and weed that ’ee don’t normally see. You wait till about five o’clock today. Still, I dare say you’ll be watching the carnival like everyone else then.”"|"Over Sea, Under Stone"|"Susan Cooper"
"ap < 05:00"|"nearly five o’clock"|"Jane looked at her watch. “It’s nearly five o’clock. When you’ve been in there ten minutes I’ll pull on the line twice to tell you.”"|"Over Sea, Under Stone"|"Susan Cooper"
00:00|midnight|"And then Great-Uncle Merry followed them into her mind. Where was he? Where had he gone this time? What, so near the end of the quest, could possibly have been important enough to take him away? Never for one moment did Jane think that he could have come to any harm, or have been captured by the enemy. She remembered too clearly the utter confidence with which Great-Uncle Merry had swept her into his arms on the midnight headland: “They dare not follow if I am here . . . .”"|"Over Sea, Under Stone"|"Susan Cooper"
"ap 05:12"|"twelve minutes past five"|"Jane looked at her watch. It was twelve minutes past five, and still the line in her hands was moving slowly and irregularly into the cave. She gave two strong deliberate tugs on the line. After a pause she felt it move twice in reply; but faintly. The line was two-thirds unwound; she wished she had measured it as she let it go. Time dragged by; still the line pulled insistently out of her hand, moving into the dark entrance more slowly now. The sun blazed down immovable out of the empty blue sky, and a small breeze sprang up from nowhere to lift the edges of Jane’s long loose hair."|"Over Sea, Under Stone"|"Susan Cooper"
