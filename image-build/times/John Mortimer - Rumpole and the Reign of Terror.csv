"~ 02:00"|"about two o’clock in the morning"|"The house at number 7, Royalty Avenue, near to Clapham Common, had been put up for sale and contained no furniture, pictures or indeed anything at all. It was this improbable venue that Percy, in his declining years, had apparently decided to break and enter by night. It seemed that Royalty Avenue had the remarkable privilege, unlike most streets in London, of having a police constable patrolling it at night. It was about two o’clock in the morning when PC Simpson saw Percy with his arm in an open window at the back of number 7."|"Rumpole and the Reign of Terror"|"John Mortimer"
"ap 00:30"|twelve-thirty|"‘I got a text message from Mrs Bina Singh. She’d gone through quite a serious cancer operation and I looked after her on her regular visits to the hospital. She wanted to meet me urgently at her home at twelve-thirty the next day. It was an address in Willesden. I tried ringing her on the number the hospital had, but there was no reply. So I decided to call at the Willesden house.’"|"Rumpole and the Reign of Terror"|"John Mortimer"
05:00|"five o’clock in the morning"|"Such were my thoughts as I walked through Covent Garden. Then I remembered the days when this was the fruit and vegetable market where farmers set out their produce, where the pubs were open at five o’clock in the morning and barrow boys shouted about their wares and the pavements were littered with discarded boxes and cabbage leaves. Regrettably, it had been tidied up, the market moved to a distant part of London."|"Rumpole and the Reign of Terror"|"John Mortimer"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"‘No, Mr Rumpole. You’re in luck’s way – they’re giving you a holiday tomorrow.’ This was said, I suppose, in a vain and hopeless attempt to cheer me up. The most encouraging call I had during that doleful period was from Bonny Bernard, who offered to buy me a drink at Pommeroy’s that evening at six o’clock. The time-honoured tradition of the drinks at Pommeroy’s was that they were marked down on my slate and my most loyal solicitor didn’t even bother to look as though he was fumbling for the cash. That he was undertaking to foot the bill raised my hopes of there being a big money brief somewhere in the offing."|"Rumpole and the Reign of Terror"|"John Mortimer"
"ap 04:30"|four-thirty|"‘I can’t guarantee it.’ I had to tell the truth. ‘Forecasting the result of a case is as dangerous as forecasting the winner of the four-thirty at Cheltenham.’"|"Rumpole and the Reign of Terror"|"John Mortimer"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"A fight, I thought, and who was it going to be between? Leonard and Rumpole, whom I suppose you might call the men in my life. I suddenly had an absurdly romantic picture of the Elizabethan ladies who sat holding their fans or eating sweetmeats while a couple of knights crashed swords with each other for their favours. If the Khan trial wasn’t going to be as dramatic, it couldn’t be duller than sitting in the flat with a frozen vegetable curry and the ten o’clock news."|"Rumpole and the Reign of Terror"|"John Mortimer"
