Gertie had gone out to a movie that evening with a friend identified as one Gus Ricovic and hadn’t returned to the apartment until one-thirty in the morning, at which time she discovered the body and phoned the police. The actual murder was assumed to have taken place somewhere between ten and eleven. Death had resulted from a single blow to the back of the head made by some blunt instrument, not found on the premises nor turned up in the subsequent investigation. There was no sign of forcible entry into the apartment, nor was there any indication of a fight or any other struggle.
