"ap 07:00"|seven|"""Seven, yes, seven, we always knew it was seven!"" Klapaucius eagerly agreed. ""Now will you, uh, let us go?"" he added cautiously."|"The Cyberiad"|"Stanislaw Lem"
"ap 04:00"|four|"""No! It's four! Four and only four, four from the beginning to the end of time—FOUR!!"" bellowed Trurl, growing hoarse."|"The Cyberiad"|"Stanislaw Lem"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"The machine moved away from the cave, letting in a little pale light, and gave a piercing scream:
""That's not true! It's seven! Say it's seven or I'll hit you!""
""Never!"" roared Trurl, as if he no longer cared what happened, and pebbles and dirt rained down on their heads, for the machine had begun to ram its eight-story hulk again and again into the wall of stone, hurling itself against the mountainside until huge boulders broke away and went tumbling down into the valley."|"The Cyberiad"|"Stanislaw Lem"
">> 00:00"|"Well after midnight"|"Well after midnight, the Leyden jug from which the constructors had on occasion refreshed themselves in the course of their labors was quietly taken to the headquarters of the King's secret police, where its false bottom was opened and a tiny tape recorder removed. This the experts switched on and listened to eagerly, but the rising sun found them totally unenlightened and looking haggard. One voice, for example, would say:"|"The Cyberiad"|"Stanislaw Lem"
00:00|midnight|"The bombardment began a week later, at midnight. The cannons, primed by veteran cannoneers, were aimed, muzzles raised, straight at the white star of the Emperor's empire, and they fired—not death-dealing, but life-giving missiles. For Trurl had loaded the cannons with newborn babies, which rained down upon the enemy in gooing, cooing myriads and, growing quickly, crawled and drooled over everything; there were so many of them, that the air shook with their ear-splitting ma-ma's, da-da's, kee-kee's and waa's. This infant inundation lasted until the economy began to collapse under the strain and the kingdom was faced with the dread specter of a depression, and still out of the sky came tots, tads, moppets and toddlers, all chubby and chuckling, their diapers fluttering. The Emperor was forced to capitulate to King Protuberon, who promised to call a halt to the hostilities on the condition that his son be granted Amarandina's hand in marriage—to which the Emperor hastily agreed. Whereupon the baby cannons were all carefully spiked and put away, and, to be safe, Trurl himself took apart the femfatalatron. Later, as best man, in a suit of emeralds and holding the ceremonial baton, he played toastmaster at the riotous wedding feast. Afterwards, he loaded his rocket with the titles, diplomas and citations which both the King and the Emperor had bestowed upon him, and then, sated with glory, he headed for home."|"The Cyberiad"|"Stanislaw Lem"
"ap 05:00"|five|"And at five, when they had handed him nothing, he let loose such a whistle, that their ears nearly flew off, and Klapaucius realized that the ""PHT"" of which the natives spoke with terror was indeed ""Ph.D.,"" for the pirate had obviously studied at some higher institution, like the Criminal Academy. Trurl held his head and groaned—Pugg's whistle was fully commensurate with his size."|"The Cyberiad"|"Stanislaw Lem"
"~ 12:00"|"Around noon"|"""Your Royal Highness shall have his Perfect Adviser,"" promised Trurl, and proceeded to the castle tower which Mandrillion had set aside for him as a workshop. It wasn't long before they could hear the blowing of bellows there, the ringing of hammers, the rasping of saws. The King sent spies to have a look; these returned much amazed, for Trurl had not constructed an Adviser at all, but a variety of forging, welding, cutting and wiring machines, after which he sat down and with a nail made little holes in a long strip of paper, programming out the Adviser in every particular, then went for a walk while the machines toiled in the tower all night, and by early morning the work was done. Around noon, Trurl entered the main hall with an enormous doll that had two legs and one small hand; he brought it before the King, declaring that this was the Perfect Adviser."|"The Cyberiad"|"Stanislaw Lem"
"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"""I once happened to land on the planet Legaria and, as is my custom, stayed at an inn, determined to keep to my room until I had acquainted myself more thoroughly with the history and habits of the Legarians. It was winter, the wind howled outside, and there was no one else in the gloomy building, till suddenly I heard a knocking at the gate. Looking out, I saw four hooded figures unloading heavy black suitcases from an armored carriage; they then entered the inn. The next day, around noon, the most curious sounds came from the neighboring room—whistling, hammering, rasping, the shattering of glass, and above all this noise there boomed a powerful bass, shouting without pause:"|"The Cyberiad"|"Stanislaw Lem"
12:00|noon|"Thus did the voice thunder and roar, and was answered by the rumble of bellows and the clanging of hammers on anvils, when suddenly a sneeze resounded and a great shout of triumph burst forth from four throats, then a shuffling and struggling behind the wall, and I heard a door open. Peering through a crack, I saw the strangers sneaking out into the hall and—incredibly enough—counted five of them. They all went downstairs and locked themselves in the cellar, remained there for a long time, returning to their room only that evening—once again four—and silent, as if they had been to a funeral. I went back to my books, but this business, it gave me no peace, so I resolved to get to the bottom of it. The next day at the same time, noon, the hammers started up again, the bellows roared, and that terrifying voice cried out in a hoarse bass:"|"The Cyberiad"|"Stanislaw Lem"
"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"And again a sneeze rang out, and a stifled scream, and once again they left the room on tiptoe; as before, I counted five when they went down to the cellar, four when they returned. Seeing then that I could learn the mystery only there, I armed myself with a laser pistol, and at the crack of dawn slipped down to the cellar, where I found nothing but charred and mangled bits of metal; covering myself with a clump of straw, I sat in the darkest corner and waited, until around noon I heard those now familiar shouts and hammering sounds, then all at once the door flew open and in walked four Legarians, with a fifth bound hand and foot."|"The Cyberiad"|"Stanislaw Lem"
00:00|midnight|"""Look, I have a rendezvous with Princess Octopauline tonight at midnight, behind the palace, in the grove of barb-wire bushes next to the mercury fountain—but I don't dare show up, not in this condition, I've had too much to drink, you see—but you, good stranger, why you're the spit and image of me, so please, please go in my place, kiss the Princess' hands for me and say that you're Oneiromant, and gosh, I'll be beholden to you forever and a day!"""|"The Cyberiad"|"Stanislaw Lem"
"< 00:00"|"almost midnight"|"""Right now, there's not a moment to lose, it's almost midnight, just remember—the King knows nothing of this, no one does, only the Princess and the old gatekeeper, and when he bars your way, here, put this heavy bag of ducats in his hand, and he'll let you pass!"""|"The Cyberiad"|"Stanislaw Lem"
