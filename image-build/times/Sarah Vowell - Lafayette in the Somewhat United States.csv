06:00|"six o’clock that morning"|"Meanwhile, by six o’clock that morning, a smaller column of about five thousand Brits and Hessians commanded by the Prussian baron General von Knyphausen were making haste to the Brandywine’s western bank at Chadds Ford, where Washington expected them to show up—that being the point. Knyphausen’s orders from Howe were to “amuse the Americans.” By which he meant hoodwink the Continentals into believing they were holding their own against Howe’s entire army while the bulk of it was en route to sneak up behind them. The morning fog, followed by smoke generated by artillery fire exchanged across the creek, not to mention the exasperating trees, abetted the misdirection, cloaking Knyphausen’s troops and dooming any American attempt to get an accurate British head count."|"Lafayette in the Somewhat United States"|"Sarah Vowell"
04:00|"four that morning"|"A series of cramped firefights that Sullivan described as “muzzle to muzzle” and grubby fits of man-to-man combat erupted up and down the eastern banks and across the surrounding hills and fields. A British captain who had been marching with Cornwallis since four that morning witnessed “the balls ploughing up the ground. The trees cracking over one’s head. The branches riven by the artillery. The leaves falling as in autumn by the grapeshot.”"|"Lafayette in the Somewhat United States"|"Sarah Vowell"

It still continues.” He noted, “A very severe Cannonade has began here too,” meaning near Chadds Ford, adding, “I suppose we shall have a very hot Evening.”"|"Lafayette in the Somewhat United States"|"Sarah Vowell"

But after the day’s four a.m. wake-up call and fourteen-mile hike, John André confided in his journal, “Night and the fatigue the soldiers had undergone prevented any pursuit.” While around ninety redcoats died, nearly five hundred were wounded. The Brits commandeered Birmingham Friends Meetinghouse to use as a makeshift hospital."|"Lafayette in the Somewhat United States"|"Sarah Vowell"
"ap 01:00"|one|"On October 14, 1777, Lafayette wrote to Washington, “Give me leave, dear general, to speack to you about my own business with all the confidence of a son, of a friend.” The business in question being Lafayette’s desire to command his own division, to actually be a general, as opposed to just being called one. He offered the commander his “respect” and “affection,” at a moment in time when Washington was a little lacking in both. “I’l conduct myself by your advices,” he pledged, adding, “I want to do some thing by myself, and justify that love of glory which I left to be known to the world.”"|"Lafayette in the Somewhat United States"|"Sarah Vowell"

"ap 09:30"|9:30|"I arrive too early on an icy December morning for the château to be open and decide to kill some time over a cup of tea in the village bar-tabac. The waitress and a pair of patrons seem surprised to see an outsider pop in, but they welcome me, along with my driver, an overdressed city slicker from Lyon. Given the proximity of Lafayette’s house, the townsfolk must be used to the occasional American looky-loo passing through town. Still, the place feels like enough of an old-fangled French time warp that when an elderly local comes in from the cold, the driver sizes up the new arrival and whispers with absolute certainty, “He’s here for his 9:30 white wine.” Sure enough, a glass of the stuff is placed before him on the bar. I must have some puritanical look on my face, because the driver laughs and says, “Welcome to France.”"|"Lafayette in the Somewhat United States"|"Sarah Vowell"
"ap 09:30"|9:30|"As a kindness, Monsieur Comte starts speaking French wonderfully, hilariously slowly, as though I were a brain-damaged simpleton who had imbibed too much of the 9:30 wine. We move from the original, medieval areas of the house to rooms added later and adorned with Louis-something-style chairs or, in the chamber where Lafayette was born, toile wallpaper. Comte mentions (I’m pretty sure) Lafayette’s warrior ancestors and the beloved grandmother who raised him here after his mother, distraught over her husband’s death, returned to Paris to stay with her family."|"Lafayette in the Somewhat United States"|"Sarah Vowell"

He was suddenly the richest orphan in France after his mother and her grandfather died within days of each other, adding vast lands in Brittany to Lafayette’s paternal holdings in Auvergne. So he was loaded if bereft, pointing out, “I had not thought but to lament my mother, never having experienced any need for money.”"|"Lafayette in the Somewhat United States"|"Sarah Vowell"
"~ 00:00"|"around midnight"|"Finally, after Lafayette had spent two months on the Victory “floating on this dreary plain”—land ho. Lafayette, Kalb, and a few men came ashore north of Charleston around midnight on June 13, 1777, waking up the household of Major Benjamin Huger of the South Carolina militia. Huger put them up. “I retired to rest that night rejoicing that I had at last attained the haven of my dreams,” Lafayette recalled. He went on to gush, “The next morning was beautiful. Everything around me was new to me, the room, the bed draped in delicate mosquito curtains, the black servants who came to me quietly to ask my commands, the strange new beauty of the landscape outside my windows, the luxuriant vegetation—all combined to produce a magical effect.”"|"Lafayette in the Somewhat United States"|"Sarah Vowell"
