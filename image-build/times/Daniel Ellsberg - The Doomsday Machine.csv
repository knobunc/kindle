00:00|midnight|"I remember one August night in particular, sitting in the office assigned to me, which looked out over the ocean. It was a moonless night, close to midnight. The ocean was dark outside my windows. I was reading an analysis of the optimal conditions, from a Soviet point of view, for a surprise attack. A key point, I read, would be for them to accompany ICBM and bomber attacks on SAC bases deep in our interior with carefully coordinated attacks by cruise missiles from submarines onto bases near our oceans and on command centers (outflanking our radar in the north and providing no warning, with only minutes of flight time)."|"The Doomsday Machine"|"Daniel Ellsberg"
"~ 00:00"|"about midnight"|"Since their submarines had to be on the surface for this, and considering various weather conditions, the ideal time for the attack, I read, would be in August, about midnight on a moonless night. I looked out the window at the blackness of the sea, then I glanced at my watch. I literally felt a shiver and the hair on my neck rose."|"The Doomsday Machine"|"Daniel Ellsberg"

A carrier, five destroyers, and several antisubmarine helicopters had their quarry cornered in a narrow sector of the Caribbean and were signaling, as they supposed, for it to come up and identify itself, a token of vulnerability and surrender. Otherwise they could wait it out until it had to come up amid them, running low on oxygen and electricity, to recharge its batteries."|"The Doomsday Machine"|"Daniel Ellsberg"

"ap ~ 04:00"|"approximately 400"|"In October 1947, a report on longer-run bomb requirements was sent to the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), which was now in charge of all aspects of bomb production, from the Joint Chiefs by their de facto Chairman, Admiral William D. Leahy. Two years earlier as Truman’s chief of staff, as Leahy recounted in a memoir, he had privately deplored dropping either the Nagasaki or the Hiroshima bombs on cities, believing that “in being the first to use it, we had adopted an ethical standard common to the barbarians of the Dark Ages. I was not taught to make wars in that fashion, and wars cannot be won by destroying women and children.” Now he reported to the AEC that a “military requirement exists for approximately 400 atomic bombs of destructive power equivalent to the Nagasaki bomb” to be dropped on approximately one hundred urban targets. The target date for achieving that capability for “killing a nation”187—a concept that arose in the Air Staff that prepared the recommendations—was January 1, 1953."|"The Doomsday Machine"|"Daniel Ellsberg"

For the first time that day, it occurred to me that it was my birthday. I was thirty. I remember thinking: for the rest of my life, I won’t have done anything more important than this.
