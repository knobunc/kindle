16:00|"4 p.m."|"The rest of the service passes without controversy, though there are some teary eyes when the inevitable ‘Sunshine on Leith’ strikes up on the rickety sound system, as the coffin is lowered into the ground. Terry is too cold to wait for the closing hymn. He shuffles away and heads down the street to the Guilty Lily pub, where the reception will take place. He is the first person to get to the alehouse, and it’s a relief to be in the warm on this foul, dreich day. Outside it is already pitch dark at barely 4 p.m. A sombre barmaid points to a white-clothed table full of glasses of beer, whisky and wine, and another with a buffet of traditional funeral spread; the mini sausage rolls, the ham-and-cheese sandwiches. Terry hits the toilets, doing a livener before returning to get himself a bottle of beer. As he takes up position by the bar, the mourners file in. Terry, his eyes on Maggie’s entrance, fails to notice Stevie’s discord. As she moves elegantly over to the big fireplace, on the other side of the room, he wonders how long it will take her to come his way."|"A Decent Ride"|"Irvine Welsh"
"~ 02:00"|"around 2 a.m."|"Then, in the early hours of the morning, around 2 a.m., it all stops. Nobody quite notices the precise time. Many, indeed, have forgotten all about the hurricane as they spill out of the pub, into the ghostly, rubbish-strewn avenues, and make their way unsteadily home."|"A Decent Ride"|"Irvine Welsh"
"~ 01:00"|"around 1am"|"Scotland’s smokers have been praised for their heroism, standing up to extremely inhospitable elements in the form of the devastating hurricane known dismissively as ‘Bawbag’ by locals. As the storm raged to its height around 1am, clusters of smokers spontaneously left the bars of Edinburgh’s Grassmarket, where they struck up a rousing, defiant rendition of ‘Flower of Scotland’. But instead of standing against ‘proud Edward’s Army’, as in Roy Williamson’s famed lyric, they subsistuted this with ‘Hurricane Bawbag’. Plasterer Hugh Middleton, 58, said, ‘I’ve never seen anything like it. We just roared our song out into the night. Amazingly, the hurricane seemed to die out after that. So we really did send Bawbag “homewards tae think again”. I suppose the message is that if you come to Scotland, behave yourself and you’ll be looked after. But if you step out of line . . .’"|"A Decent Ride"|"Irvine Welsh"

02:30|vigils|"Terry regularly picks up Jonty from Penicuik. He’d been relieved when he met Karen that he couldn’t recall ever riding her, although with her transformative weight escalation there was no real guarantee this was the case. It has been agreed it is not for the best that he met their mother, ailing badly up the stairs in her bed. Remarkably, in the face of his dire medical prognosis, Henry is still hanging around, Alice continuing her cheerless vigils to his side."|"A Decent Ride"|"Irvine Welsh"
12:00|Noon|"Jonty is slow and a bit simple compared to wee Gally, a smart, nippy, quick-minded, fast-talking wee guy. Though in some ways more vulnerable because of his unworldliness, as he seemed to draw bullies like a magnet, Jonty, at the same time, is more resilient than Terry’s thin-skinned boyhood friend. — Right then, lit’s git you hame, Terry says to Alice, as much to force himself out of his own ruminations than anything, then turns to Jonty. — What time’s the funeral?
— Noon. Aye sur, noon. Noon. Aye. Aye.

He finds it easier to sleep during the day than at night, with his dreams less torturous.
