"ap 11:00"|eleven|"""Aayoych,"" said Eli, blending several Yiddish and American expletives. Then he got dressed and left, turning down Avenue A, which was already a bit redolent as the early summer heat cooked the trash on the street. Furniture was placed neatly along the garbage-strewn edges of sidewalks—a special place where things were found and things were given away every day. The streetlamps in metallic paint were wrapped with paper flyers up to seven feet up the poles, like badly laid strudel dough, leaves dangling, advertisements for everything, some legal, including the exact time and place for demonstrations that had already been missed against every known form of repression. The trashy streets were occupied in shifts—different people at different hours of the day The older people, such as Eli, were out first, beaten only by those who had spent the night on the sidewalk. Then the smarts, the new young people, walked quickly to the subways to their promising jobs in other neighborhoods. At eleven, shaggy young people staggered out into the blinding sunlight looking as though they had spent the night with drugs and sex and not much food or sleep. But soon the smarts would be home from their jobs and the streets filled with the entire assortment."|"Boogaloo on 2nd Avenue"|"Mark Kurlansky"
"ap 01:02"|One-two|"These were the issues being juggled—several balls too many—in his mind while seated on a contour-molded bench on a downtown F train burrowing under Greenwich Village to a clearly un-Latin beat. It was a fox-trot. Chow Mein would have called it a Jewish beat. One-two, three and four. One-two, three and four. Suddenly the rhythm changed. Somewhere under Manhattan in a dark and barely lit tunnel of rock, the train slowed and then stopped. Nathan felt the oxygen steadily depleting, as though movement had created the oxygen, the same way fish have to keep water moving through their gills to breathe. His heart was throbbing, reverberating through the thick cavities of his frail body, shaking him, thudding loudly enough for the other passengers to hear."|"Boogaloo on 2nd Avenue"|"Mark Kurlansky"
15:00|"three in the afternoon"|"On Friday night, bakeries on Second Avenue sold challah. The one on Fourth Street was still kosher but sold out by three in the afternoon, not because that many Jews had to have their challah kosher, but because the kosher bakery did not make many, on the assumption that few kosher people were left. Since all the kosher people knew this, they bought early. By three o'clock the action shifted to the bakery on Seventh Street, which was not kosher but at least was Jewish. Once that bakery had sold its last loaf of braided egg bread, anyone who wanted challah had to resort to Chaim's. Chaim's was one of the oldest bakeries in the neighborhood, but several years earlier Chaim, having decided to spend his remaining years pondering a blue sea he never wanted to step into, had moved to Boca Raton and sold his bakery to an industrious Korean family."|"Boogaloo on 2nd Avenue"|"Mark Kurlansky"

Outside were tomatoes and snapdragons, and beyond the fence was the East Village with sirens, and rumbling cars, and people shouting, sometimes in Spanish, and in the distance—a popping noise that caught Chow Mein's attention. He heard it again. Knowing he would be asked, he looked at his watch: 11:53 P.M."|"Boogaloo on 2nd Avenue"|"Mark Kurlansky"

Her twelve o'clock patient had finally left and her lunch had arrived: a salad of mixed field greens; chicken salad with low-fat mayonnaise, bean curd, and broccoli; mixed fruit and low-fat yogurt; two fat-free blueberry muffins; and a low-cholesterol chocolate bar.

It was almost seven o'clock in the evening, a time when no one made deliveries. The truck was completely white with a hand-painted sign saying ""Tom's Grocery Delivery Service."" It was the FBI or DEA or, as the dealers like to say the DUM, the local police. If they had the budget for the trucks, why didn't they have the money to hire real sign painters?

Sonia saw the silly Raggedy Ann smile on Nathan's face and realized what he was thinking. Of course! He was right, and to her surprise she also felt very happy, though still very nauseated. She reassured him that she wanted it.
