12:00|midday|"Temp Hell that day was . . . well, hellish. I started a tally of how many times I was asked to do a particular job without anyone saying ‘please’, and was up to twenty-seven by midday. Then the intercom buzzed and the SlugMan spoke. ‘Can you come into my office for a minute,’ he said."|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
"ap 06:00"|six|"On Saturday morning I woke at six, with the sun streaming in through the window. Right. Big day today. The café’s busiest day of the week. Up and at ’em!"|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
23:00|"eleven o’clock at night"|"It was only when I’d put the cake tins into the oven (finally! I never wanted to grate a sodding carrot again, my fingers were in shreds) that my thoughts turned to the icing. That was the moment I realized we didn’t have any cream cheese. Not even a smidgen. Damn – could I get away with ordinary icing? No. Would anyone around here be open and selling cream cheese at eleven o’clock at night? No."|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"By nine o’clock I was ready. The carrot cake had been iced (icing was great – it covered up all the dimples and scorched bits of sponge, I realized), the kitchen and dining areas were spotless, I’d had a practice run with the coffee machine and reckoned I could get by on a wing and a prayer, and I’d replenished all the stock we held behind the counter. Oh, and I’d also chalked up a sign on the blackboard saying: TODAY’S SPECIAL: CORNISH CREAM TEA – £2.95. If that didn’t get the punters racing in, I didn’t know what would."|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"I had a straggle of customers to deal with – teas, coffees and a couple of rounds of toast – but it was ten o’clock before any of the other members of staff put in an appearance. Seb was first, the lad who helped out at weekends, and he looked horrified to see me there. ‘Sorry I’m late,’ he said, turning bright red. ‘I didn’t think we’d be open yet. Last week, Carl said – ’"|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"Saffron, the sulky redhead, finally showed her face by eleven o’clock, and she was slightly more efficient at least, but her customer service was the pits. Even from my hellish bacon-frazzling, toast-burning nightmare of a kitchen, I was aware of the rude, uninterested way in which she spoke to people. ‘Brown or white toast?’ she’d snap. ‘Do you want milk in that tea?’"|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
00:00|midnight|"It was the longest, hottest, most bad-tempered working day I could remember in a long time. Saffron had a stand-up row with a teenage girl who came in – her arch-enemy, apparently, not that I cared about that – and called an elderly gentleman ‘a deaf old giffer’ when he didn’t answer her ‘D’ya want milk with that?’ immediately. Carl was rude and unpleasant the entire day. We ran out of milk, we ran out of bread, we ran out of cheese and, to top it all off, Seb managed somehow to drop my cake. Yes, my carrot cake, my pride and joy, the one I’d slaved over until midnight. I felt like bursting into tears when I saw it split into umpteen spongy shards on the floor."|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"At four o’clock, just as the café was quietening down and I was starting to think about closing up for the day, Annie came in. Annie was Jo’s best friend in Carrawen Bay and I’d known her for years. She was a cuddly, squashy sort of person, with the kindest smile you could imagine. I’d been meaning to get in touch with her ever since I’d come down, but with one thing and another, I hadn’t managed to pick up the phone yet."|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
"ap 06:00"|six|"‘How about tonight, then?’ she asked. ‘We’re still at the same place – number ten Silver Street. Why don’t you come over at six? We can have some food and a good old catch-up.’"|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
"ap 06:00"|six|"‘How about tonight, then?’ she asked. ‘We’re still at the same place – number ten Silver Street. Why don’t you come over at six? We can have some food and a good old catch-up.’
‘Thanks, Annie,’ I said. ‘That would be great. I’ll see you at six.’
Annie lived in a small terraced house along a quiet road. Long plumes of feathery pampas grass swayed in one corner of her tiny front garden, and there was a collection of bone-white seashells by the front door. I rapped the brass knocker twice and waited."|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"‘It’s full-time, thirty-five hours a week, slightly better pay than you were receiving at Crossland, and they want you to start at nine o’clock on Wednesday,’ she said. ‘So shall I give them a buzz and say you’re on board?’"|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
"ap < 09:00"|"just before nine"|"On Tuesday morning, just before nine, Annie arrived with her first cake order. Both of the large cakes looked perfect – the chocolate cake had thick, glossy icing and smelled heavenly, and the lemon cake looked deliciously moist. It was all I could do not to cut off a slice of each there and then and cram them into my mouth. ‘And flapjacks too,’ she said, passing me a square tin. ‘Twenty plain, and twenty with fruit in. Let me know which go down best, for future bakes.’"|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
12:00|noon|"By noon, I was loading my case into the car with an odd sense of foreboding about leaving."|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
11:00|"eleven in the morning"|"Outside the office, I perched on a wall and dialled Carl’s mobile number. It was eleven in the morning, so he should have been in the café for the last hour, but he sounded as if I’d woken him up, once he finally answered. ‘Yeah?’ he said."|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
"ap < 08:00"|"almost eight o’clock"|"Once we arrived in Carrawen Bay it was almost eight o’clock, and becoming dusky. Lights were on in all the B&B windows along the high street and, as we drove past the pub, it looked bustling and full of life. ‘Fab,’ Amber said appreciatively. ‘It’s really pretty here. Oh wow, and there’s the beach. Gorgeous!’"|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
23:00|"eleven o’clock that night"|"By eleven o’clock that night we’d unpacked most of my stuff, cleaned up, emailed an ad for a new chef to the local press, ordered a cash-and-carry delivery online (arriving on Monday) and sunk almost two bottles of wine between us. Oh, and experimented with the dodgy liqueurs we’d discovered at the back of Jo’s drinks cabinet."|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"After a hot, drunken night of little sleep, I woke with a splitting hangover at eight o’clock and the realization that: Oh bollocks, I was meant to have gone out much earlier than this to buy the groceries we need for the next few days. And then I remembered everything that had happened all over again: Matthew and I breaking up, me moving out, the scarily big number of things I needed to do to get the café up and running . . ."|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
"ap 06:20"|"twenty past six"|"‘Hell’s bells,’ Amber groaned at twenty past six, when we had closed up for the night. ‘Well, that was a day and a half.’"|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
"ap 00:30"|twelve-thirty|"We were crazily busy that bank-holiday Monday. This wasn’t helped by three things: one, Amber and I running the show single-handed (or rather double-handed) most of the time; two, the food delivery arriving at twelve-thirty, which was of course our busiest point of the entire day; and three, my bloody sister Ruth rocking up unannounced, at the same time."|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"The rest of the afternoon passed quickly, with the pasties all but selling out. The Victoria sponge and the brownies did really well too, and we had lots of great feedback from the customers. I was almost sorry to close up at five o’clock, especially as it meant my time with Amber was practically over."|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
"ap 09:30"|Nine-thirty|"‘Cool,’ she said. ‘When do you want me to start?’
‘Tomorrow morning? Nine-thirty?’
‘I’ll be there.’"|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"I clicked off the call. Well, that was something at least. Then my phone buzzed with an incoming text. Will take you out for supper tomorrow. Pick you up at seven? R x"|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
"ap < 10:00"|"nearly ten o’clock"|"When I finally parked the car it was nearly ten o’clock and pretty much dark. I loved how much deeper and more velvety the darkness was here by the sea. There was none of the light pollution that you got in Oxford, the hazy amber glow, which meant the sky never quite hit its ultimate jet-black. Down here in the bay, the darkness all but swallowed you up: the sea was a deep, liquid black and you could smell its salty scent and hear its rhythmic rushing better than you could see it. Tonight there was a gleaming slice of moon up in the charcoal sky, and a sprinkling of bright silver stars."|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
"ap 08:30"|eight-thirty|"Ed came in at eight-thirty and began making pastry for a new batch of pasties. ‘What are we having today, chef ?’ I asked, passing him a coffee."|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"My words were like a prophecy of doom. The only person who came in before ten o’clock was the postman with a couple of letters. ‘Thanks,’ I said. ‘I don’t suppose I can tempt you with a coffee while you’re here, can I? Or a hot pasty?’"|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"Finally, at eleven o’clock, we had our first customer. It was a silver-haired lady wearing a long grey coat and a plastic see-through rainhood, which she untied and shook out, before coming over to the counter. ‘Goodness,’ she said, ‘it’s horrible out there.’"|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
"~ 11:00"|"around eleven that morning"|"Martha came in at around eleven that morning, holding hands with Jamie, and I couldn’t help comparing the two girls. Martha seemed so happy and chilled in contrast to prickly, vulnerable Phoebe. ‘Hi there,’ I said. ‘Haven’t seen you for a while. How’s half-term going?’"|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
"ap 06:40"|"twenty to seven"|"He glanced up at the wall clock and I followed his gaze. It was twenty to seven, and we’d be opening up before long. ‘Leave her be,’ he said. ‘We’ve got too much to do here to start chasing around after her.’"|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
"ap > 07:00"|"just after seven o’clock"|"The first customers to arrive, just after seven o’clock, were Annie, Martha and Jamie, and as I ushered them in, I saw the café through their eyes, and felt a huge rush of pride. The tables looked so smart with their tablecloths and flower-filled vases, and the candles and fairy lights lent the room a soft, pretty glow. ‘Isn’t this wonderful?’ Annie said, hugging me. ‘Jo would have loved what you’ve done, Evie.’"|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"By eleven o’clock we were done, and the four of us collapsed into a booth, knackered but exultant. ‘Brilliant,’ I said, high-fiving them all, aware that my face was shiny, my dress still smelled of wine, and my hair was all but standing on end from where I’d been running my fingers through it in moments of stress. I didn’t care in the slightest, though. ‘Absolutely brilliant! You all played a blinder – everyone had such a great night.’ I couldn’t quite bring myself to look at Ed. I still wasn’t sure what to make of his outburst to the press. I mean, yeah, everyone knew that chefs were prone to diva-like behaviour, but honestly. It was only the North Cornwall Gazette, for heaven’s sake, not some sleazy gossip rag trying to stitch us up, or run a damaging exposé."|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
"< 00:00"|"nearly midnight"|"By the time we’d sunk the bottle of cava and worked our way through the leftover crab pâté and French bread, mushroom risotto, salad and puddings, it was nearly midnight, and we were all flagging. ‘We’ll open a bit later tomorrow,’ I decided. ‘Is ten-thirty all right for everyone?’"|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"

"ap < 10:00"|"just before ten o’clock"|"Ed and Rachel arrived within minutes of each other just before ten o’clock, so I didn’t get the chance to press Ed on his strange behaviour and rudeness towards the press guys. He seemed in a subdued mood anyway, not up for the usual banter, and kept himself to himself. Perhaps I was being unfair on him, I thought. Perhaps I had been expecting too much. He was only helping me out for a week or two, after all – it wasn’t like he was an equal partner in the business, or had any long-term interest in it. Why should he care if some guys from the local rag had showed up? No skin off his nose what they wrote."|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
"ap ~ 03:00"|"about three"|"Ed left as usual at about three – ‘dog o’clock’ as he called it – and I watched him lope away, feeling frustrated. We hadn’t managed to speak properly all day and now he’d gone. By tomorrow I was sure it would feel too late to pick up the threads of the photographer-meltdown conversation again."|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
"ap ~ 04:00"|"around four"|"The sun came out at around four, and suddenly the beach was bathed in beautiful golden light, yet still it and the café remained quiet. A few customers had dropped by for cake and coffee, but the pace felt laid-back and easy after the frantic rushing around of Friday night. I wiped down the tables in a leisurely fashion while Phoebe and Rachel chatted behind the counter."|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
"ap ~ 11:00"|"about eleven o’clock"|"At about eleven o’clock Florence, the sweet silver-haired lady who’d been in the week before, appeared. ‘Happy birthday!’ I said, remembering in the nick of time the conversation we’d had last time. ‘What can I get you? Surely you’re going to have a piece of cake on your birthday – my treat?’"|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
"ap 07:00"|"Seven o’clock"|"‘You’re as young as you feel,’ I reminded her. ‘Oh, and Florence, if you’re at a loose end tonight, a lad in the village is having an art show here. Seven o’clock. Free wine and nibbles. Might be nice to spend your birthday evening down here?’"|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
12:00|midday|"Phoebe got increasingly excited as we neared midday, but from then onwards she sank further and further into gloom. ‘Where are they?’ she kept fretting, every half an hour or so. ‘Why aren’t they here yet?’"|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"At three o’clock, just as I thought Phoebe was about to burst into tears with every new tick of the clock, in came a well-dressed couple in their forties. The woman had the same high cheekbones and fair hair as Phoebe, only hers was styled in a chic graduated bob. The resemblance was unmistakable, though. She had a brisk, searching manner as she walked in – and then her eyes fell upon Phoebe, who had her arms full of crockery, and she let out a little cry."|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"And then all of a sudden it was seven o’clock, and the first people began arriving."|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"By nine o’clock four of Jamie’s paintings had been sold, and he’d had praise and compliments coming out of his ears. Someone had even expressed an interest in commissioning him to paint a mural in their bathroom. To say he was jubilant was a massive understatement. I was jubilant, too. The whole night had been a roaring success. Everyone seemed to have enjoyed themselves, and I had mingled my little socks off, meeting lots of friendly locals, who all kept telling me how proud Jo would have been of me, and how wonderful it was to see the café doing so well. I had invited lots of women to the café’s inaugural ‘girls’ night in’ too, including (after my fifth glass of wine) Betty, the village matriarch herself. Who would have predicted that at the start of the evening?"|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"It was difficult to stop myself from texting Amber to tell her. I so badly wanted to! But it was two in the morning, and I knew she slept with her mobile near her bed, so I’d wake her up, and then she’d probably be so monstrously pissed off with me that she wouldn’t be properly excited on my behalf. That was not a good end result for anyone."|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"Yes. Of course I should. It was absolutely right that I did. But it was two in the morning, and I couldn’t wait any longer. I needed to know everything right now, before my brain imploded with questions."|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
"ap 03:00"|"Three o’clock"|"Three o’clock came and went, and my hot chocolate sat there, undrunk and no longer fitting its description. This is what I found out: Ed had owned and managed a West End restaurant called Silvers, which served modern British cuisine with a twist, according to the online Time Out review. Its average score on the Toptable website was four stars. ‘Great food, we’ll be back,’ one reviewer had written. (Not now, they wouldn’t, I thought darkly.) As well as all that, I’d also discovered that Ed had run the place with his wife – yes, his wife – Melissa, although they had split up, since the allegations of Ed’s violence. (‘OUT OF THE FRYING PAN’ the headline in the Sun had read.) She had filed for divorce, he had filed for bankruptcy, and then they had both gone into hiding."|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
12:00|midday|"It turned out to be one of the most stressful days I’d ever had in the café. Try as I might, I couldn’t help but hope that Ed would appear and we could sort things out, but by midday miserable reality had set in, and I’d given up on him showing his face. The pasties had sold out by one o’clock, and then I got totally stressed out by all my sandwich orders, especially as we ran out of egg mayo, tuna mayo and pesto chicken in quick succession, and I had to speedily make up more batches of each. It was a hot, muggy day, the kitchen felt airless and sticky, and we had customers queuing out the door at some points, despite Rachel’s best efforts. Leah was great, but she was inevitably a bit slower, it being her first day."|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"

"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"By the time it got to five o’clock and we’d cleaned up, and Rachel and Leah had left, I sat down in a booth and absolutely bawled my eyes out. Everything came out: my tiredness, my upset at last night’s discovery, the horribleness of my confrontation with Ed first thing, and the misery that had kicked in afterwards, not to mention the three painful fat burns I had on my wrist from frying eggs all morning."|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
"ap 09:30"|nine-thirty|"Once Corrie was over, and I’d washed out the conditioner and had had a long and rather mournful chat on the phone with Amber, I felt wrung out. I really wanted an early night, but I knew that if I went to bed, then – sod’s law – there would be a knock at the door and yadda yadda. I forced myself to stay up until nine-thirty, then admitted defeat and faced up to the facts. He wasn’t coming. There wouldn’t be any knocking at my door tonight. Forget it, Evie. Go to sleep. Maybe he’ll be back tomorrow."|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
"ap ~ 11:00"|"about eleven o’clock"|"Thursday began as another crappy kind of day. Again, no sign of Ed. Again, horrible muggy weather, with barely a breath of wind to stir up the soupy air. A chef from the temping agency arrived at about eleven o’clock, which was something, though. Her name was Wendy and she was about my mum’s age, built like a wrestler with black-inked tattoos down her arms, and dyed-black hair held back with a pink plastic hair-band. ‘All right, pet,’ she said in a Marlboro-roughened northern accent when Rachel brought her into the kitchen. She stuck out a meaty paw and nearly broke my fingers with her iron grip when I shook it."|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
"ap ~ 09:00"|"about nine o’clock"|"It was about nine o’clock by now, but still as humid and oppressive as it had been all day. Someone – Annie, I think – had been saying there had been a severe weather warning on the early-evening forecast about very heavy rain in the south-west, and I could feel the thunderous conditions building in the air. The pavements were dusty and dry as I walked up the main street, and my face felt hot. I hadn’t even bothered looking in the mirror to check I looked all right, I realized, so keen was I to get over to Ed’s and talk to him. I patted my hair down as I climbed the steep main street, sending up a little prayer to the Goddess of Vanity that I didn’t look completely minging. Ah. Bay View Terrace – there it was, up on the right."|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
12:00|midday|"At midday Francis walked in, dripping wet despite the large black umbrella he carried. ‘Hello there,’ I said in surprise. ‘Everything all right? What can I get you?’"|"The Beach Cafe"|"Lucy Diamond"
