"ap 01:00"|one|"Mr. Jellyband had appealed to the company in general, who were
listening awe-struck and open-mouthed at the recital of Mr. Peppercorn's
defalcations. At one table two customers—gentlemen apparently by their
clothes—had pushed aside their half-finished game of dominoes, and had
been listening for some time, and evidently with much amusement at
Mr. Jellyband's international opinions. One of them now, with a quiet,
sarcastic smile still lurking round the corners of his mobile mouth,
turned towards the centre of the room where Mr. Jellyband was standing."|"The Scarlet Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o'clock"|"His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales had promised to be present.
He was coming on presently from the opera. Lord Grenville himself had
listened to the two first acts of ORPHEUS, before preparing to receive
his guests. At ten o'clock—an unusually late hour in those days—the
grand rooms of the Foreign Office, exquisitely decorated with exotic
palms and flowers, were filled to overflowing. One room had been set
apart for dancing, and the dainty strains of the minuet made a soft
accompaniment to the gay chatter, the merry laughter of the numerous and
brilliant company."|"The Scarlet Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"
"ap 01:00"|"one o'clock"|"The few words which Marguerite Blakeney had managed to read on the
half-scorched piece of paper, seemed literally to be the words of Fate.
""Start myself tomorrow. . . ."" This she had read quite distinctly; then
came a blur caused by the smoke of the candle, which obliterated the
next few words; but, right at the bottom, there was another sentence,
like letters of fire, before her mental vision, ""If you wish to speak
to me again I shall be in the supper-room at one o'clock precisely.""
The whole was signed with the hastily-scrawled little device—a tiny
star-shaped flower, which had become so familiar to her."|"The Scarlet Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"
"ap 01:00"|"One o'clock"|"One o'clock precisely! It was now close upon eleven, the last minuet
was being danced, with Sir Andrew Ffoulkes and beautiful Lady Blakeney
leading the couples, through its delicate and intricate figures."|"The Scarlet Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"

"ap < 11:00"|"Close upon eleven"|"Close upon eleven! the hands of the handsome Louis XV. clock upon its
ormolu bracket seemed to move along with maddening rapidity. Two hours
more, and her fate and that of Armand would be sealed. In two hours she
must make up her mind whether she will keep the knowledge so cunningly
gained to herself, and leave her brother to his fate, or whether
she will wilfully betray a brave man, whose life was devoted to his
fellow-men, who was noble, generous, and above all, unsuspecting. It
seemed a horrible thing to do. But then, there was Armand! Armand, too,
was noble and brave, Armand, too, was unsuspecting. And Armand loved
her, would have willingly trusted his life in her hands, and now, when
she could save him from death, she hesitated. Oh! it was monstrous;
her brother's kind, gentle face, so full of love for her, seemed to
be looking reproachfully at her. ""You might have saved me, Margot!"" he
seemed to say to her, ""and you chose the life of a stranger, a man you
do not know, whom you have never seen, and preferred that he should be
safe, whilst you sent me to the guillotine!"""|"The Scarlet Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"
"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"The clock was ticking so mercilessly on. It was long past midnight,
and even the Prince of Wales was thinking of leaving the supper-table.
Within the next half-hour the destinies of two brave men would be pitted
against one another—the dearly-beloved brother and he, the unknown
hero."|"The Scarlet Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"

him."""|"The Scarlet Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"

again, Lady Portarles buttonholed him and started on the subject of
pretty Mlle. Suzanne de Tournay. I knew he would not move until Lady
Portarles had exhausted on the subject, which will not be for another
quarter of an hour at least, and it is five minutes to one now."""|"The Scarlet Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"

what your ladyship is thinking about,"" he added, for evidently the fair

his intellectual conversation."|"The Scarlet Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"

I have the right to know. What happened in the dining-room at one

his whole attitude there was a remote suggestion, distinctly visible to
her, that he wished to go, and had no desire for a midnight interview."|"The Scarlet Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"
00:00|midnight|"""Nay, Madame,"" he rejoined placidly, ""but 'tis on the other foot the
shoe happens to be, and I'll warrant you'll find the midnight air more
poetic without my company: no doubt the sooner I remove the obstruction
the better your ladyship will like it."""|"The Scarlet Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"

as ever; the footsteps had retreated. Through her wide-open window the
brilliant rays of the morning sun were flooding her room with light. She
looked up at the clock; it was half-past six—too early for any of the
household to be already astir."|"The Scarlet Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"

she of Chauvelin and his schemes. He had failed to discover the identity
of the Scarlet Pimpernel, of that she felt sure. Both Lord Fancourt
and Chauvelin himself had assured her that no one had been in
the dining-room at one o'clock except the Frenchman himself and
Percy—Yes!—Percy! she might have asked him, had she thought of it!
Anyway, she had no fears that the unknown and brave hero would fall in
Chauvelin's trap; his death at any rate would not be at her door."|"The Scarlet Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"

o'clock in Lord Grenville's dining-room, when the relentless agent
of the French Government would finally learn who was this mysterious
Scarlet Pimpernel, who so openly defied an army of spies and placed
himself so boldly, and for mere sport, on the side of the enemies of
France."|"The Scarlet Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"

to keep up her courage through this weary midnight waiting."|"The Scarlet Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"

she had feared, sleep sedulously avoided her eyes. Her thoughts were of
the blackest during these long, weary hours, whilst that incessant storm
raged which was keeping her away from Percy. The sound of the distant
breakers made her heart ache with melancholy. She was in the mood when
the sea has a saddening effect upon the nerves. It is only when we are
very happy, that we can bear to gaze merrily upon the vast and limitless
expanse of water, rolling on and on with such persistent, irritating
monotony, to the accompaniment of our thoughts, whether grave or gay.
When they are gay, the waves echo their gaiety; but when they are sad,
then every breaker, as it rolls, seems to bring additional sadness, and
to speak to us of hopelessness and of the pettiness of all our joys."|"The Scarlet Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"

afternoon"|"From that moment the hours seemed less wearisome; there was less
hopelessness in the waiting; and at last, at five o'clock in the
afternoon, Marguerite, closely veiled and followed by Sir Andrew
Ffoulkes, who, in the guise of her lacquey, was carrying a number of
impedimenta, found her way down to the pier."|"The Scarlet Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"

Englishman wished to hire, and which was to have been ready for him by

in his pocket then and there, and took out a handful of gold, which he
showed to that descendant of Beelzebub, telling him that all that would
be his, if the horse and cart were ready for him by eleven o'clock."""|"The Scarlet Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"

could hear their voices, and the snorting of their horses, and now,

a body of advancing men: Desgas and his soldiers."|"The Scarlet Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"

nearer to Chauvelin, ""and I swear by Abraham, Isaac and Jacob that I
would obey your Honour most absolutely, and that I would not move from
this place until your Honour once more deigned to shed the light of your
countenance upon your humble servant; but remember, your Honour, I am
a poor man; my nerves are not as strong as those of a young soldier. If
midnight marauders should come prowling round this lonely road, I
might scream or run in my fright! And is my life to be forfeit, is some
terrible punishment to come on my poor old head for that which I cannot
help?"""|"The Scarlet Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"
