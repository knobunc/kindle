">> 00:00"|"long after midnight"|"After the dinner dishes were cleared Linny would fire up her old Land Rover and take off for Casper. She would drag in long after midnight, and sometimes, when it was very late, park down near the main road and walk in to the ranch house. The dogs never barked at her. At breakfast she always said she’d been job hunting, that the best place to find out about jobs was not in the newspapers but in the bars."|"Bad Dirt"|"Annie Proulx"
12:00|noon|"A few days later Georgina cornered Linny at noon. The girl, wearing nothing but a T-shirt and sagging, blood-spotted briefs, was at the counter, fixing her breakfast, a plate of tortillas and beans with huge amounts of fiery salsa. Fighting a hangover, Georgina suspected. Doreen was kneading bread, shooting glances at Linny. Georgina waved her out into the garden, then, as Linny sat at the table, Georgina swung her bony behind onto a stool near the counter. Her rough heels scraped the rungs."|"Bad Dirt"|"Annie Proulx"
12:00|noon|"“I hear Linny’s truck,” he said. “Better hang up. See you tomorrow noon then? O.K., love you, honey. Drive careful.”"|"Bad Dirt"|"Annie Proulx"

04:00|"4:00 a.m."|"The first trip was easy. Deb Sipple drank a beer with Björn, had the truck loaded and secured in two hours, the hay bales lined up to make two huge cylinders. On the way back he took a northern route, stopped in Albert Lea, Minnesota, a town whose crimson past has faded to pink but where Deb Sipple had no trouble finding the Electric Silo, a honky-tonk where he took on some personal freight that gave him a bad headache by 4:00 a.m. In South Dakota he stopped for four cups of coffee and a bison steak and, after a cigarette and a piece of apple pie, was feeling well enough to continue. Fiesta Punch had him unload the hay in the pasture near her main gate."|"Bad Dirt"|"Annie Proulx"
"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"The second trip was notable in every way. He got off to a bad start by picking up a female hitchhiker who told him she’d been in prison in Florida with Aileen Wuornos, the serial killer, whom she counted as her best friend. He made an excuse to stop at a service station and when, at his suggestion, she got out to use the ladies’ room, he took off. To steady his nerves he visited Albert Lea again and so missed the weather report warning of windstorms in the coming days, and when he pulled into Björn’s it was well past midnight. The hay man was not pleased and told him to sleep in his truck until daylight."|"Bad Dirt"|"Annie Proulx"
12:00|noon|"It was noon before he woke up. It took four hours to load the hay, partly because the wind was gusting to sixty, partly because Deb Sipple was distracted to find he had smoked all his cigarettes in Albert Lea and his host laughed cruelly when he asked for tobacco. Then he discovered he had forgotten to bring the tarp."|"Bad Dirt"|"Annie Proulx"
12:00|noon|"While the men cleaned the borrow ditches and culverts, cut new drainage channels, built water bars, and hauled gravel, Gilbert hacked manfully at the mud with a broken hoe, but he went to the weathered corral to play with sticks and rocks when Old Man Bunner told him to get out of his way or he’d chop off his legs. The rocks were wet. He built a play corral of mud and broken miner’s candle stems, and inside placed the rocks which were his horses. The wind cleared out the weather, and by noon it was broken blue sky."|"Bad Dirt"|"Annie Proulx"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"Half of the stores in town were closed for the holiday. Already there were clusters of people along the sidewalk although the parade didn’t start until one o’clock. In despair he drove down to Buffalo to the video store where Rod worked. It was open, the windows draped in red, white, and blue ribbons. A huge poster read:"|"Bad Dirt"|"Annie Proulx"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"In midafternoon Mitchell turned north. It was five o’clock when they hit the familiar dirt road after theFIREWORKS sign. They crossed the tracks and the terrain began to rise, a little rumpled and showing bits of dark red ledge beyond the fences. A dozen pronghorn grazed a mile away and he slowed, watching the guard duty animal throw up its head suspiciously. As they drove a billow of dust rose behind them. It was a hopeless chore, trying to keep the car clean. A small stream, known locally as a river and faced with flattened junk cars to prevent erosion in the spring floods, threaded down from the rough foothills. They could see the dark ridge, the aspen grove that marked Star Lily Ranch in the distance. A mile beyond the cattle guard they crossed the railroad tracks again, the Infiniti thumping painfully. At the fork he bore right and the road climbed, took its most beautiful turn through the heart of dappling aspen, then opened out into a series of folded meadows."|"Bad Dirt"|"Annie Proulx"
"< 12:00"|"nearly noon"|"It was nearly noon when Eugenie, making a ham and cheese casserole, heard Mitchell curse. There was the sound of shattering glass, and she guessed he’d thrown or dropped his whiskey glass on the stone hearth."|"Bad Dirt"|"Annie Proulx"
"ap 05:00"|"five-o’clock"|"The beards showed odd color and texture variations. Old Man DeBock’s whiskers were short and yellow-white. Deb Sipple’s, as crinkled as ramen noodles, came in black with streaks of grey down each side, and Wiregrass Cokendall showed thick and fiery red bristle in contrast to the anemic blond hairs of his son, Kevin. The Game & Fish warden, Creel Zmundzinski, also grew a red beard, no surprise as his hair all over was the orange-red the paint store called “Mandarin Sunset,” a color that clashed unmercifully with his official red shirt. Hard Winter Ulph, who’d been born during the blizzard of 1949 in some shack south of Wamsutter, showed jet black, pencil-straight whiskers that stuck out like the spines on a hatpin cactus. A suet-faced Englishman with the chewy name of Lobett Pulvertoft Thirkill, working on Fiesta Punch’s ranch for the winter, joined in and contributed a faceful of tan five-o’clock shadow. He was closely watched by Creel Zmundzinski, who knew that men with criminal pasts often took hired-man jobs on remote ranches, and that their warped inclinations found outlet in poaching and carnal knowledge of anything warm. By January the contestants’ facial moss had thickened and lengthened to the point where most could scratch their fingers through the underbrush and delighted to do so. Amanda Gribb complained, for the zinc counter was sprinkled with loose hairs night after night."|"Bad Dirt"|"Annie Proulx"
"> 02:00"|"after 2:00 a.m."|"It had been late, after 2:00 a.m., when he lurched in and found everything tipped over or missing. He had called the police but they seemed to think he had done it himself, disposing of the stolen goods through some seedy receiver, and they changed their minds only when the mixer and the golf clubs turned up in a Casper pawnshop and the pawnshop woman shook her head at his photograph."|"Bad Dirt"|"Annie Proulx"
05:00|"5:00 a.m."|"That night, rolled up in his sleeping bag, he heard the nearby yip and yodel of coyotes, but near morning, the 5:00 a.m. light milky in the windows, he heard deeper howling. Someone’s dog, he supposed, and got up to start the day. He had a hundred things to do in Rawlins, the nearest town with real stores."|"Bad Dirt"|"Annie Proulx"
"ap 11:45"|"Eleven forty-five"|"“Jesus,” said Buddy, sitting in a chair. He looked at his watch. Eleven forty-five. Hours to go before daylight. “You want a take Vernon Clarence to the emergency room in Rawlins? Have him looked at?”"|"Bad Dirt"|"Annie Proulx"

12:00|noon|"He spent an uneasy night, the rifle in bed with him, half-expecting to hear Rase Wham kick in the barricaded door. Hadn’t Rase said he had an AK-47? Mr. Kalashnikov’s little invention could shoot through a trailer as if it were made of rotten muslin. But Monday morning came, and with it the receding rumble of Rase’s truck as he drove to work in the near dark.
At noon Buddy went to town to call his mother. His father answered.
“Yes, your checks are here. I got them out in the truck. Your mother told me you were havin a problem. What kind a problem?”"|"Bad Dirt"|"Annie Proulx"
12:00|noon|"“Toss it,” said Bobcat, nodding at the waiting trash can. He said the same words more than a hundred times that morning, and by noon Jacky and Ringold had made a mountain of junk in the driveway. In between dragging the stuff out of the garage they took turns trying to start the old Chevy truck. They drank beer through the morning and were a little drunk, their bladders under strain despite frequent trips into the house, threading the way through canyons of weird saved trash to the only bathroom."|"Bad Dirt"|"Annie Proulx"
"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"It was past midnight when Amanda Gribb got home. She parked in front of her trailer and got out, stepping into a fresh cow pie. Something lumbered and moved at the corner of the trailer. She turned on the porch light and saw five black baldies, the remains of her precious peony plant dangling from the jaws of the closest one. She seized the broom and ran shrieking at them, and they turned and strolled into the darkness, leaving her with a turned ankle and a bad temper."|"Bad Dirt"|"Annie Proulx"

His rig’s a big stainless and jewel-tone iridescent purple Peterbilt, says ‘Redhill Bio Transport’ on the side, picture a dolphins. He probably expects a little sweetening, say a hundred or so.”"|"Bad Dirt"|"Annie Proulx"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"It was a long way to Gillette, a six-hour drive of back roads and mountain passes before she hit I-90 in Buffalo. She had cleaned out the back of her pickup and, thinking of her cargo, put on the camper top to reduce windchill. She pulled into Truck Heaven at nine, went inside, and ate the day’s special, a huge platter of French fries flanked by fried catfish, lemon wedges, and a plastic packet of mayonnaise mixed with relish masquerading as tartar sauce. The place was crowded with truckers swilling coffee and eating pie. Amanda ordered pie too, lemon meringue, which tasted like tartar sauce with sugar."|"Bad Dirt"|"Annie Proulx"
