“One forty-five,” he said, looking the coach straight in the eye.

Buy him Hersheys all the time to satisfy his craving for chocolate. Thank God Archie didn’t go in for pot or that stuff—Obie would have had to become a pusher, for crying out loud, to supply him. Obie was officially the secretary of The Vigils but he knew what the job really demanded. Carter, the president who was almost as big a bastard as Archie, said, “Keep him happy, when Archie’s happy, we’re all happy.”"|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"

02:30|Vigils|"Obie looked down at the field where the guys were skirmishing in the shadow of the goal posts. Sadness seized him. I should have gone out for football, he thought. He had wanted to—he’d been hot stuff with Pop Warner at St. Joe’s. Instead, he had ended up as Secretary of The Vigils. Cool. But, hell, he couldn’t even tell his parents about it."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"The shadows of the goal posts definitely resembled a network of crosses, empty crucifixes. That’s enough symbolism for one day, Obie told himself. If he hurried he could make the four o’clock bus to work."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"“My help?” Archie asked, feigning surprise, trying to keep any trace of mockery out of his voice. He knew now why he was here. Leon didn’t mean Archie’s help—he meant the help of The Vigils. And didn’t dare put in into words. No one was allowed to breathe a word about The Vigils. Officially, The Vigils did not exist. How could a school condone an organization like The Vigils? The school allowed it to function by ignoring it completely, pretending it wasn’t there. But it was there, all right, Archie thought bitterly. It was there because it served a purpose. The Vigils kept things under control. Without The Vigils, Trinity might have been torn apart like other schools had been, by demonstrations, protests, all that crap. Archie was surprised by Leon’s audacity, knowing his connection with The Vigils and bringing him in here this way."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"“But how can I help?” Archie asked, turning the screw, emphasizing the singular of himself and not the plural of The Vigils."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"Their eyes met, held. A showdown now? At this moment? Would that be the smart thing to do? Archie believed in always doing the smart thing. Not the thing you ached to do, not the impulsive act, but the thing that would pay off later. That’s why he was The Assigner. That’s why The Vigils depended on him. Hell, The Vigils were the school. And he, Archie Costello, was The Vigils. That’s why Leon had called him here, that’s why Leon was practically begging for his help. Archie suddenly had a terrific craving for a Hershey."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"“The Vigils will help,” Archie said, unable to contain himself any longer. He had never been able to use those words—The Vigils—aloud to a teacher, had had to deny the existence of the organization for so long that it was beautiful to use them, to see the surprise on Leon’s pale perspiring face."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"Someone snickered. Archie stiffened, shot a look at Carter, a withering look that said, tell them to cut the crap. Carter snapped his fingers, which sounded in the quiet storage room like the banging of a gavel. The Vigils were grouped as usual in a circle around Archie and the kid receiving the assignment. The small room behind the gym was windowless with only one door leading to the gymnasium itself: a perfect spot for Vigil meetings—private, the solitary entrance easily guarded, and dim, lit by a single bulb dangling from the ceiling, a 40-watt bulb that bestowed only a feeble light on the proceedings. The silence was deafening after the snap of Carter’s fingers. Nobody fooled around with Carter. Carter was the president of The Vigils because the president was always a football player—the muscle someone like Archie needed. But everyone knew that the head of The Vigils was The Assigner, Archie Costello, who was always one step ahead of them all."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"Archie let it gather. He could feel a heightening of interest in the room. It always happened this way when an assignment was about to be given. He knew what they were thinking—what’s Archie come up with this time? Sometimes Archie resented them. The members of The Vigils did nothing but enforce the rules. Carter was muscle and Obie an errand boy. Archie alone was always under pressure, devising the assignments, working them out. As if he was some kind of machine. Press a button: out comes an assignment. What did they know about the agonies of it all? The nights he tossed and turned? The times he felt used up, empty? And yet he couldn’t deny that he exulted in moments like this, the guys leaning forward in anticipation, the mystery that surrounded them all, the kid Goober white-faced and frightened, the place so quiet you could almost hear your own heartbeat. And all eyes on him: Archie."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"

02:30|Vigils|"The Goober nodded, accepting the assignment like a sentence of doom, the way all the others did, knowing there was no way out, no reprieve, no appeal. The law of The Vigils was final, everyone at Trinity knew that."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"Emile looked up suspiciously, on guard. He was never sure whether Archie Costello was serious or not. Emile never fooled around with Archie. In fact, Archie was one of the few people in the world Emile respected. Maybe even feared. Archie and The Vigils."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"Emile Janza watched the departing figure of Archie Costello. Someday, he’d be like Archie—cool, a member of The Vigils. Emile kicked at the rear tire of Carlson’s car. Somehow he was disappointed that Carlson hadn’t caught him siphoning the gas."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"

He envisioned himself being discovered here tomorrow morning, collapsed in exhaustion, a disgrace to himself and The Vigils and the school.

15:30|"three-thirty in the afternoon"|"JERRY’S MOTHER HAD DIED in the spring. They had been staying up with her nights—his father and some of his uncles and aunts and Jerry himself—since her return from the hospital. They came and went in shifts that final week, everyone exhausted and mute with sadness. Nothing more could be done for her at the hospital and she was taken home to die. She’d loved her home so much, always had some project underway—wallpapering, painting, refinishing furniture. “Give me twenty workers like her and I’d open a small factory and make a million,” his father used to joke. And then she got sick. And died. Watching her ebb away, seeing her beauty diminish, witnessing the awful alteration of her face and body was too much for Jerry to bear and he sometimes fled her bedroom, ashamed of his weakness, avoiding his father. Jerry wished he could be as strong as his father, always in control, masking his sorrow and grief. When his mother finally died, suddenly, at three-thirty in the afternoon, slipping off quietly without a murmur, Jerry was overcome with rage, a fiery anger that found him standing at her coffin in silent fury. He was angry at the way the disease had ravaged her. He was angry at his inability to do anything about saving her. His anger was so deep and sharp in him that it drove out sorrow. He wanted to bellow at the world, cry out against her death, topple buildings, split the earth open, tear down trees. And he did nothing except lie awake in the dark, thinking of her body there in the funeral home, not her anymore, but a thing suddenly, cold and pale. His father was a stranger during those terrible days, like a sleepwalker going through the motions, like a puppet being maneuvered by invisible strings. Jerry felt hopeless and abandoned, all tight inside. Even at the cemetery, they stood apart from each other, a huge distance between them even though they were side by side. But not touching. And then, at the end of the service, as they turned to leave, Jerry found himself in his father’s arms, his face pressed close to his father’s body, smelling the cigarette tobacco, the faint odor of peppermint mouthwash, that familiar smell that was his father. There in the cemetery, clinging to each other in mutual sorrow and loss, the tears came for both of them. Jerry didn’t know where his own tears began and his father’s left off. They wept without shame, out of a nameless need, and walked together afterward, arm in arm, toward the waiting car. The fiery knot of anger had come undone, unraveled, and Jerry realized as they drove back from the cemetery that something worse had taken its place—emptiness, a yawning cavity like a hole in his chest."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"LATER, ARCHIE HAD TO CONCEDE that Brother Leon had dramatized the sale too vividly and therefore put himself and The Vigils and the entire school on the spot."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"There was a lot more but Archie tuned him out. Talk, talk, talk—that’s all anybody ever heard in school. Archie squirmed uncomfortably in his seat, thinking of the Vigil meeting at which he had announced that Brother Leon had asked support for the sale and how he’d pledged the backing of The Vigils. Archie had been surprised at the ripple of doubt and skepticism from the members of The Vigils. “Christ, Archie,” Carter had said, “we never get mixed up in this stuff.” But Archie had overcome them as usual, pointing out that Leon’s need for an endorsement from The Vigils was a symbol of how powerful the organization had become. And it was only a crappy chocolate sale. But now, listening to Leon sounding as if the school was embarking on the Crusades, for crying out loud, Archie was doubtful."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"Looking at the posters and seeing his own name there, Archie plotted how his own fifty boxes would be sold. He wouldn’t dream of selling the chocolates himself. He hadn’t touched a box since his freshman days. Usually he found some willing kid who’d gladly sell Archie’s quota along with his own, figuring it was something special to be singled out by the assigner of The Vigils. This year, he’d probably spread the burden around, picking out five guys, say, and have them sell only ten boxes each. It was better than sticking one kid with the entire quota, wasn’t it?"|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"“The Vigils,” somebody else called out—giving credit where credit was due."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"When he returned to the school after practice, he found a letter scotch-taped to the door of his locker. A summons from The Vigils. Subject: Assignment."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"Everyone could see that Brother Leon was enjoying himself. This is what he liked—to be in command and everything going smoothly, the students responding to their names smartly, accepting the chocolates, showing school spirit. The Goober was depressed, thinking about school spirit. Ever since Room Nineteen had collapsed, he had lived in a state of mild shock. He awoke each morning depressed, knowing even before he opened his eyes that something was wrong, something had gone askew in his life. And then he’d remember: Room Nineteen. The first day or two had been kind of exciting. Word had gotten around that the destruction of Room Nineteen was the result of his assignment by The Vigils. Although no one mentioned the subject to him, he found himself a kind of underground hero. Even the seniors looked at him with awe and respect. Guys patted him on the ass when he passed by, an old Trinity mark of distinction. But as the days went on, an uneasiness stole across the campus. There were rumors. The place was always filled with rumors but this time they grew out of the Room Nineteen incident. The chocolate sale was postponed for a week and Brother Leon, speaking at chapel, gave a weak explanation. The Head was hospitalized, there was a lot of paperwork involved, etc. etc. There were also rumors that Leon was carrying on a quiet investigation of Room Nineteen. Poor Brother Eugene had not been seen since that devastating morning. He’d had a nervous breakdown, someone said. Others reported that there had been a death in his family and he’d been called away. Anyway, it all heaped itself upon The Goober and he found it hard to sleep at night. Despite the adulation of the guys at school, he felt as if there was some kind of distance between him and the fellows. They admired him, sure, but didn’t want to get too close in case something backfired. One afternoon, he’d met Archie Costello in the corridor and Archie had pulled him aside. “If they call you in for questioning, you know nothing,” Archie said. Goober had no way of knowing this was the kind of thing Archie loved to do—intimidate someone, get him worrying. Since then, The Goober had walked around in a state of apprehension, expecting to see his name on a Wanted sign on the bulletin board, for crying out loud. He didn’t want the adulation of the fellows anymore—he simply wanted to be The Goober, to play football and to run in the morning. He dreaded a summons from Brother Leon, wondering if he could stand up under questioning, whether he could look into those moist eyes of Brother Leon’s and actually lie to him."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
"ap 02:50"|Two-fifty|"Tubs’ left arm began to ache from the weight of the chocolates and he shifted his burden to his other arm, taking a moment to pat the reassuring bulge of his wallet. He had already sold three boxes—six dollars—but that wasn’t enough, of course. He was still desperate. He needed a hell of a lot more by tonight and nobody but nobody had bought any chocolates at the last six houses he’d visited. He had saved every cent he could from his allowance and had even sneaked a folded and greasy dollar bill from his father’s pocket last night when he arrived home, half-drunk and wobbly. He hated doing that—stealing from his own father. He vowed to return the money to him as soon as possible. When would that be? Tubs didn’t know. Money, money, money had become the constant need of his life, money and his love for Rita. His allowance barely made it possible for him to take her to the movies and for a coke afterward. Two-fifty each for the movies, fifty cents for two cokes. And his parents hated her for some reason. He had to sneak out to meet her. He had to make phone calls from Ossie Baker’s house. She’s too old for you, his mother said, when actually Tubs himself was six months older. All right, she looks old, his mother said. What his mother should have said was, she looks beautiful. She was so beautiful that she made Tubs all shaky inside, like an earthquake going on. At night in bed, he could have one without even touching himself, just thinking of her. And now her birthday was tomorrow and he had to buy her the present she wanted, the bracelet she’d seen in the window of Black’s downtown, that terrible and beautiful bracelet all sparkles and radiance, terrible because of the price tag: $18.95 plus tax. “Hon,”—she never called him Tubs—“that’s what I want most in all the world.” Jesus—$18.95 plus the 3 per cent sales tax which Tubs figured out would make a grand total of $19.52, the sales tax amounting to fifty-seven cents. He knew that he didn’t have to buy her the bracelet."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"Brother Leon had “volunteered” Brian Cochran for the position of Treasurer of the Chocolate Sale. Which meant that he’d looked around the classroom, pinned those watery eyes on Brian, pointed his finger and, voilà, as Brother Aimé said in French class, Brian was treasurer. He hated the job because he lived in fear of Brother Leon. You never knew about Leon. Brian was a senior and he’d had Leon as either a classroom teacher or as homeroom supervisor for four years and he was still uncomfortable in his presence. The teacher was unpredictable and yet predictable at the same time, which reasoning confused Brian because he wasn’t exactly a hotshot in the psychology department. It was this: you knew that Leon would always do the unexpected—wasn’t that being both predictable and unpredictable? He loved to toss surprise exams at a class—and he also could suddenly be the nice guy, not giving a test for weeks or giving a test and then throwing away the results. Or concocting a pass-fail test—he was famous for that type—where he threaded together questions that could throw a guy for a loss, with what seemed like a million possible answers. He was also quite a man with the pointer although he usually confined that kind of stuff to freshmen. If he ever pulled the pointer antics with, say, somebody like Carter, there’d be hell to pay. But not everybody was John Carter, president of The Vigils, All-Star Guard on the football team, and president of the Boxing Club. How Brian Cochran would love to be like John Carter, with muscles instead of glasses, quick with boxing gloves instead of figures."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"

02:30|Vigils|"“It’s a Vigil stunt. He’s supposed to refuse to sell chocolates for ten days—ten school days—and then accept them. Boy, those Vigils, they’re really something, aren’t they?” His head was killing him and his stomach was a sea of nausea."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"“I just can’t. I’m committed now.”
“The goddam Vigils,” Goober said.
Jerry had never heard Goober swear before. He’d always been a mild kind of kid, rolling with the punches, loose and carefree, running around the track while the other kids sat uptight during practice sessions."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"

02:30|Vigils|"Obie watched the teacher sourly. Brother Jacques was obviously bewildered. Bewildered? Hell, he was on the edge of panic. The ritual had been going on for a week now and it would continue until the cue was heard no more. In the meantime, the class would suddenly erupt into a confusion of waving arms and jogging legs, unsettling poor Brother. Of course, Brother Jacques was easy to unsettle—he was new and young and sensitive, raw meat for Archie. And he evidently didn’t know what to do about it and so he didn’t do anything, figuring apparently that the thing would run its course and why risk a futile showdown when it was obviously a prank. What else could it be? Funny, Obie thought, how everybody—the kids as well as the teachers—knew these stunts were planned or carried out by The Vigils and yet they still maintained that air of mystery, refusing to acknowledge it all. He wondered why. Obie had been involved in so many Vigil assignments that he’d lost count of them and he was continually amazed at how they got away with it all the time. In fact, he’d been getting tired of the assignments, of playing nursemaid for Archie and his trigger man as well. He was tired of being the fixer, making certain the assignment went off on schedule in order to maintain Archie’s big shot reputation. Like the Room Nineteen assignment when he’d had to creep in there and help the kid Goober take the place apart—all that work so that Archie and The Vigils would look good. Even this particular assignment involved him—if Brother Jacques failed to come up with the cue, then Obie had to find a way to feed it to him."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"Obie had nodded, disguising his disgust. What the hell was Archie involving him in an assignment at this stage of the game for? He was a senior, for crying out loud. He was secretary of the goddam Vigils, for crying out loud. Jesus, how he hated Archie, that bastard."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"“Yeah. He came flat out and said he wasn’t going to sell the junk.”
“I thought it was a Vigils thing,” Danny said tentatively.
“It was,” Kevin said, leering in triumph as his mother gave up and went into the kitchen. “But now it’s something else.” He wondered whether he was saying too much. “He was supposed to take the chocolates a couple of days ago. The assignment was over. But he still refused to take them.”"|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"An awkward silence fell between them. Kevin was in line to become a member of The Vigils next year when he became a junior. No one could be sure, of course, but there had been some hints from the guys. His best friend, Danny, knew about the possibility—and he also knew that there was a certain secrecy about The Vigils that had to be maintained. They usually avoided Vigil talk although Kevin often had inside information about assignments and stuff and he often fed it to Danny in bits and pieces, finding it hard not to show off a bit. Yet he was always afraid that Danny might say something about The Vigils to some other guys, strictly by accident, and screw up the whole situation. They had reached that point now in their conversation."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"“I don’t know,” Kevin said truthfully. “Maybe The Vigils will take some action. Maybe they don’t give a hell. But I’ll tell you one thing.”"|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"But at this minute he was getting annoyed with Obie. Where the hell was he? Sitting down on one of the bleacher seats, Archie found a sudden and unexpected peace in the deserted gymnasium. His moments of peace were becoming less frequent all the time. The Vigils—those assignments, the constant pressure. More assignments due and everybody waiting for what Archie would come up with. And Archie hollow and empty sometimes, no ideas at all. And his lousy marks. He was certain to flunk English this term, simply because English was mostly reading and he didn’t have time anymore to spend four or five hours every night reading a lousy book. Anyway, between The Vigils and worrying about his marks, he didn’t seem to have any time to himself anymore, not even time for girls, no time to hang around Miss Jerome’s, the girls’ high school across town where, when school let out for the day, you could let your eyes devour some luscious sights and usually talk one of them into the car, for a ride home. With detours. Instead, here he was every day, involved with assignments and homework, juggling all this activity and then getting stupid notes from Obie. Meet me in the gym …"|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"“Well, there’s all kinds of rumors around the school. First of all, a lot of kids think that The Vigils are in on the deal, that Renault still isn’t selling them because he’s still carrying out the assignment. Then there are some kids who know the assignment is over and think that Renault is leading some kind of revolt against the sale. They say Brother Leon is climbing the wall every day …”"|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"“We’ll see, we’ll see,” Archie said. “I don’t know whether The Vigils should get involved or not.” He yawned."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"That phony yawn irritated Obie. “Hey, look, Archie. The Vigils are involved whether you know it or not.”"|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"“Look, you told the kid to refuse the chocolates in the first place. That’s what started all this stuff. But the kid went beyond that. He was supposed to start selling after the assignment was over. So, now he’s defying The Vigils. And a lot of guys know that. We are involved, Archie, whether we want to be or not.”"|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"Obie could see that he had scored. He saw something flash in Archie’s eyes, like looking at a blank window and observing a ghost peeking out.
“Nobody defies The Vigils, Obie …”
“That’s what Renault’s doing.”"|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"Archie had that dreamy look again and his lower lip drooped. “Here’s what to do. Arrange to have Renault appear before The Vigils. Check up on the sale—get the totals, facts and figures.”"|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"“Right,” Obie said, writing in his notebook. As much as he hated Archie, he loved to see him when he was swinging into action. Obie decided to add more fuel to the flames. “Another thing, Archie. Didn’t The Vigils promise Leon way back they’d back him in the chocolate sale?”"|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
00:00|midnight|"“Look, Jerry. There’s something rotten in that school. More than rotten.” He groped for the word and found it but didn’t want to use it.

02:30|Vigils|"“The Vigils?” Jerry asked. He’d lain back on the lawn and was looking at the blue sky, the hurrying autumn clouds."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"“Perhaps you should begin with Renault,” Leon said. “I think he should be made to say ‘yes’ instead of ‘no.’ I’m convinced, Archie, that he’s become a symbol to those who would like to see the sale defeated. The malingerers, the malcontents—they always rally around a rebel. Renault must sell the chocolates. And you, The Vigils—yes, I’m saying the name aloud—The Vigils must throw their full weight behind the sale …”"|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"

02:30|Vigils|"THE SUMMONS LOOKED like a ransom note—letters cut out of a newspaper or magazine. vIgiL MeEtinG tWO-THirTy. The wackiness of the note, those crazy letters, made it seem childish and ridiculous. But that same touch of the childish also gave it an air of something not quite rational, faintly threatening and mocking. That was the special quality of The Vigils, of course, and Archie Costello."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"Thirty minutes later, Jerry stood before The Vigils in the storage room. The nearby gym was occupied by fellows either practicing basketball or boxing calisthenics and the walls echoed with thuddings, bouncings and whistles blowing, like a grotesque sound track. Nine or ten Vigil members were present, including Carter who was getting tired of this Vigil crap, especially when it meant he had to miss boxing, and Obie who looked forward to the meeting with pleasure, wondering how Archie would proceed. Archie sat behind the card table. The table was covered with a scarf of purple and gold—the school colors. In the exact center of the table: a box of chocolates."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"Archie raised his hands and silence fell. Someone in the gym fell against the wall and shouted an obscenity. Obie marveled at the way Archie ran the meetings and how The Vigils quickly took his cues. Porter hadn’t sold ten boxes, if any at all. Obie himself had only sold sixteen but had called out forty-five."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"“Renault,” Archie said, friendly, his voice conversational. “I’ll tell you something. Nothing’s personal here in The Vigils. No secrets here, understand.” He took a final suck at his thumb. “Hey, Johnson.”"|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"“See?” asked Archie. “No secrets here, Renault. Nothing personal. Not in The Vigils.”"|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"Carter blew air out of his mouth in exasperation. He was losing patience with Archie’s cat and mouse crap. He had sat here for two years watching Archie play his silly games with kids, having Archie act the big shot as if he ran the show. Carter carried the responsibility for the assignments on his shoulders. As president, he also had to keep the other guys in line, keep them psyched up, ready to help make Archie’s assignments work. And Carter wasn’t crazy about this chocolate stuff. It was something beyond the control of The Vigils. It involved Brother Leon and he didn’t trust Leon as far as he could throw him. Now, he watched the kid Renault, looking as if he was ready to faint with fright, his face pale and eyes wide with dread, and Archie having fun with him. Jesus. Carter hated this psychological crap. He loved boxing where everything was visible—the jabs, the hooks, the roundhouse swings, the glove in the stomach."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"Archie returned his attention to Jerry. “You’re getting off easy, Renault. You’ve disobeyed The Vigils. That calls for punishment. Although The Vigils don’t believe in violence, we have found it necessary to have a punishment code. The punishment is usually worse than the assignment. But we’re letting you off cheap, Renault. We’re just asking you to take the chocolates tomorrow. And sell them.”"|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"Jerry hung up. He didn’t want to hear anymore. The word “crap,” echoing now in his mind, had destroyed all illusion about her. Like meeting a lovely girl and having her smile reveal rotten teeth. But his heart was still beating wildly. Are you some kind of pervert? Maybe I am. Not a sexual pervert but another kind. Wasn’t refusing to sell the chocolates a kind of perversion? Wasn’t it crazy to go on refusing to sell the chocolates, particularly after that last warning yesterday by Archie Costello and The Vigils? And yet this morning, he had stood his ground and fired a level and positive No at Brother Leon. For the first time, the word brought exultancy to him, a lifting of the spirit."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"THEY SHOULDN’T HAVE PICKED Frankie Rollo for an assignment, of course. A junior, Rollo was insolent, a troublemaker. He was a non-participant, refusing to take part in athletics or extra-curricular activities that were so important in the Trinity scene. He seldom opened a book and never did any homework, but he managed to survive because he possessed a native and cunning intelligence. His major talent was cheating. He was also lucky. Under ordinary circumstances, he was the kind of guy Archie took pleasure in assigning, watching him bend or break. All these so-called rough characters melted into ninety-seven-pound weaklings when confronted by Archie and The Vigils. The scorn and the swagger evaporated as they stood ill-at-ease in the storage room. But not Frankie Rollo. He stood loose and easy, unintimidated."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"“Hey, you guys,” Rollo said, swiveling away from Archie and addressing the entire assembly. “I’m not a scared kid who pees his pants because the big bad Vigils call him to a meeting. Hell, you guys can’t even scare a punk freshman into selling a few lousy chocolates …”"|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"A muffled roar of approval rose from The Vigils. At last, action, physical action, something you could see with your own eyes."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"“Okay, quiet,” Carter demanded, as if he were yelling at Rollo to quit throwing up. Then he turned to Archie. “Sit down,” he said. Archie recognized the command in Carter’s voice. For a moment, he was tempted to challenge him but he realized that The Vigils had approved Carter’s action against Rollo. This was no time to have a showdown with Carter, it was time to play it cool, cool. Archie sat."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"“We’ve arrived at the moment of truth, Archie,” Carter said. “And here’s how I read it—tell me if I’m wrong. When a gross creep like Rollo comes in here and challenges The Vigils, then there’s something wrong. Very wrong. We can’t afford to have guys like Rollo thinking they can screw around with us. The word will spread and The Vigils fall apart.” Carter paused to let them imagine the dissolution of The Vigils. “Now, I said that something is very wrong. And I’ll tell you who’s wrong. We are.”"|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"Archie didn’t say anything. He was suddenly in a roomful of strangers and he decided to do nothing at all. When in doubt, play the waiting game. Watch for an opening. It would be ridiculous to disagree with Carter, of course. Word had been spreading throughout the school—the kid had refused to sell the chocolates in direct defiance of The Vigils. That’s why they had assembled here this afternoon."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|VIGILS|"Obie was eager to comply. Reaching under his chair he withdrew a poster that he had folded in two. Unfolded, the poster was about the size of an ordinary kitchen window. Obie held it up for all to see. The poster proclaimed in scrawled, scarlet letters—
SCREW THE CHOCOLATES
AND
SCREW THE VIGILS
"|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"“No,” Carter snorted. “Renault doesn’t have to go around putting up posters. He’s been saying screw The Vigils and the chocolates for weeks now. But this shows what’s happening. The word is spreading. If Renault can get away with defying us, other people are gonna try.” Finally, he turned to Archie. “Okay, Archie. You’re the brains of the outfit. And you also got us into this mess. Where do we go from here?”"|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"“You’re pushing panic buttons for nothing,” Archie said, voice quiet and casual. He knew what he must do—regain his previous status, wipe away the memory of Rollo’s defiance and prove that he, Archie Costello, was still in command. He had to show them that he could take care of both Renault and the chocolates. And he was ready for them. While Carter had been making speeches and Obie flashing his poster around, Archie’s mind had been racing, probing, testing. He always worked better under pressure, anyway. “First of all, you can’t go around beating up half the kids in the school. That’s why I usually lay off the strong-arm stuff in the assignments. The brothers would close us down in no time and the kids would really start sabotaging if we started hurting people.” Noticing Carter’s frown, Archie decided to throw him a bone—Carter still ran the meetings and as Vigils president he could be a dangerous adversary. “All right, Carter, I’ll admit you did a beautiful job on Rollo and he had it coming. But nobody gives a damn about Rollo. He can lay in his vomit till kingdom come and nobody’d care. But Rollo’s an exception.”"|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"Anticipating a deadlock on that topic, Archie changed directions. “But that doesn’t sell chocolates, Carter,” Archie said. “You told us The Vigils are linked up with the sale. Then the solution is simple. Let’s get the goddam sale over with as soon as possible. Let’s sell the chocolates. If Renault’s turning into some kind of rebel hero because he’s not selling the chocolates, how the hell is he going to look when everybody in the school is selling, except him?”"|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"“They will, Obie,” Archie predicted, “they will. Do your thing, they say, Obie, do your thing. Well, we’re going to make selling chocolates the thing to do. And The Vigils will come out on top as usual. The school will love us for it—getting rid of their chocolates. We’ll be able to write our own ticket with Leon and the brothers. Why do you think I pledged support to Leon in the first place?” Archie’s voice was gentle with assurance, the old gentleness they all recognized as Archie’s hallmark when he was sailing high, wide and handsome. They admired the way Carter had employed his fists to demolish Rollo but they felt more secure with Archie in command, Archie who was capable of surprise after surprise."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"That night at eleven o’clock the telephone rang again. Jerry figured it was his father—he was working the late shift at the drug store."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
15:00|"three o’clock this afternoon"|"It was weirder than three o’clock this afternoon. The night, the darkness outside, the apartment riddled with lamplight shadows seemed more menacing. Forget it, Jerry told himself, it always seems worse at night."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"What had happened? He wasn’t certain. There was no single reason for the sudden turnabout, the surprising upswing, the unexpected rash of sales. But the proof of the change was not only here in the figures before him but everywhere in the school itself. Brian had witnessed the feverish activity and how the chocolates had suddenly become a vogue, a fad, the way hula hoops had caught on when they were kids in the first or second grade, the way demonstrations had been the big thing a few years ago. Rumors indicated that The Vigils had adopted the sale as a special crusade. And that was possible, although Brian hadn’t made any inquiries—he always steered clear of The Vigils. However, he’d seen some of the more prominent Vigil members waylaying kids in the corridors, checking on their sales, whispering menacingly to those who had sold only a few boxes. Each afternoon, teams of fellows left the school, loaded down with chocolates. They piled into automobiles and drove off. Brian heard that the teams drove to various sections of town and invaded neighborhoods, ringing doorbells, banging on doors, a massive sales effort as if they were all encyclopedia salesmen on commission, for crying out loud. Brian heard reports that someone had gotten permission to solicit at one of the local factories—four guys had circulated through the place and sold three hundred boxes in a couple of hours. The feverish activity kept Brian hopping, maintaining the records and then rushing down to the big boards in the assembly to post the results. The hall had become the school’s focal point. “Hey, look,” a kid had yelled out during the last posting. “Jimmy Demers sold his fifty boxes.”"|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"That was the creepy aspect of the sale, the way the credit was being distributed among all the students. Brian didn’t know whether this was fair or not but he didn’t argue about methods—Brother Leon was interested in results and so was Brian. And yet Brian was made uncomfortable by the situation. A few minutes ago, Carter had walked into the office with a fistful of money. Brian treated Carter with utmost care—he was head of The Vigils."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
"ap 01:50"|one-fifty|"“Right.” Brian leaped to the task under Carter’s watchful gaze. His fingers trembled and he cautioned himself to make no mistakes. Let it be one-fifty exactly."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"Fast? Hell, they’d been juggling the sales all week long and Brian hadn’t caught on for two entire days. He was tempted now to ask Carter if the campaign had turned into a Vigils project—like one of Archie Costello’s assignments—but decided to hold down his curiosity."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
"ap 06:00"|six|"SWEET, SWEET IN THE DARK, SAFE. Dark and safe and quiet. He dared not move. He was afraid that his body would come loose, all his bones spilling out like a building collapsing, like a picket fence clattering apart. A small sound reached his ears and he realized it was himself, crooning softly, as if he were singing himself a lullaby. Suddenly, he missed his mother. Her absence formed tears on his cheeks. He hadn’t cried at all from the beating, had lain there on the ground for a few moments after the brief blackout, and then had dragged himself up and made it agonizingly to the locker room at school, walking as if on a tightrope and one misstep would send him hurtling into depths below: oblivion. He’d washed himself, cold water like liquid fingernails inflaming the scratches on his face. I won’t sell their chocolates whether they beat me up or not. And I’m not a fairy, not a queer. He had stolen away from the school, not wanting anyone to witness his painful passage down the street to the bus stop. He kept his collar up, like a criminal, like those men in newscasts being herded into court. Funny, somebody does violence to you but you’re the one who has to hide, as if you’re the criminal. He shuffled to the back of the bus, grateful that it wasn’t one of the crowded school buses but a maverick bus that appeared at odd hours. The bus was full of old people, old women with blue hair and big handbags and they pretended not to see him, sailing their eyes askew from him as he stalked to the rear of the bus, but their noses wrinkled as they caught the smell of vomit when he passed. Somehow, he’d made it home on the jolting bus, made it to this quiet room where he now sat, sun bleeding low in the sky and spurting its veins on the den window. Dusk moved in. After a while, he took a warm bath, soaking in the water. Then he sat in the dark, quiet, letting himself mend, not stirring, feeling a dull ache settle in his bones now that the first waves of pain had moved away. The clock struck six. He was glad that his father was on the evening shift, at work until eleven. He didn’t want his father to see him with these fresh cuts on his face, the bruises. Make it to the bedroom, he urged himself, undress, curl into cool sheets, tell him I came home sick, must be a virus, twenty-four-hour flu, and keep my face hidden."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"

"ap 02:30"|Two-thirty|"The telephone ruptured the night. Jerry groped upward from sleep, reaching for the sound. Instantly awake, he glanced at the alarm clock’s luminous face. Two-thirty."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"Emile swelled with pride. Was Archie talking about The Vigils? And was there really no photograph after all? What a relief that would be!"|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"Brian sighed, looking down at his fingers, tuning Leon out, letting the words fall meaninglessly on his ears. He thought of Renault, that strange stubborn kid. Was Leon right, after all? That the school was more important than any one kid? But weren’t individuals important, too? He thought of Renault standing alone against the school, The Vigils, everybody."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"Archie, the architect of the event, watched the proceedings—the stadium filling up, the kids streaming in, the slips of paper being sold, passed back and forth, the lights dispelling some of the cool of the autumn evening. He stood near the improvised stage that Carter and The Vigils had erected that afternoon under Archie’s direction—an old boxing ring resurrected from the bowels of the bleachers and restored to its former use except for the absence of ropes. The platform stood directly at the fifty-yard line close to the stands so that each kid would see everything and wouldn’t miss any of the action. That was Archie. Give them their money’s worth."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"Now, surveying his handiwork, the crowded bleachers, the frantic comings and goings as the raffle tickets were bought and sold and the directions scrawled on the tickets. Archie exulted quietly. He had successfully conned Renault and Leon and The Vigils and the whole damn school. I can con anybody. I am Archie."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"Obie, the spotlight, concentrated on Renault. Poor dumb doomed kid. He can’t win and he doesn’t know it. Not from Archie. Nobody wins from Archie. Archie, who’d been going down to defeat—what a great scene that had been, the last Vigils meeting when he’d stood there humiliated—but now he was on top again, all the chocolate sold, in charge once more, the entire school in the palm of his hand. All of which proves that the meek don’t inherit the earth. Not very original. Archie must have said it at one time or another."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"Brian Cochran was amazed but he shouldn’t have been—he was getting used to being amazed where Archie Costello was concerned. First the chocolate sale. And now this—this wacky raffle. Never anything like it at Trinity. Or anywhere. And he had to admit that he was kind of enjoying himself even though he had protested when Archie approached him this afternoon, asking him to take charge of the raffle. “You did great with the chocolates,” Archie said. The compliment melted Brian’s opposition. Besides, he was scared stiff of Archie and The Vigils. Personal survival, that’s what Brian believed in."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"“Simple, Carter, simple.” Archie reveled in the moment, basking in Carter’s admiration, Carter who had humiliated him at The Vigils meeting. Someday he’d get even with Carter but at the moment it was satisfying enough to have Carter regarding him with awe and envy. “You see, Carter, people are two things: greedy and cruel. So we have a perfect setup here. The greed part—a kid pays a buck for a chance to win a hundred. Plus fifty boxes of chocolates. The cruel part—watching two guys hitting each other, maybe hurting each other, while they’re safe in the bleachers. That’s why it works, Carter, because we’re all bastards.”"|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"Carter disguised his disgust. Archie repelled him in many ways but most of all by the way he made everybody feel dirty, contaminated, polluted. As if there was no goodness at all in the world. And yet Carter had to admit that he was looking forward to the fight, that he himself had bought not one but two tickets. Did that make him like everybody else—greedy and cruel, as Archie said? The question surprised him. Hell, he’d always thought of himself as one of the good guys. He had often used his position as president of The Vigils to keep control of Archie, to prevent him from going overboard on assignments. But did that make him one of the good guys? The question bothered Carter. That’s what he hated about Archie. He made you feel guilty all the time. Christ, the world couldn’t be as bad as Archie said it was. But hearing the shouts of the kids in the bleachers, impatient for the fight to get underway, Carter wondered."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"Carter had been doubtful about using the black box, pointing out that this was not a Vigils meeting. How can we make Archie try for the marbles?"|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"The sight of the black box stunned the gathering into a silence more deep than before. Only members of The Vigils and their victims had seen it. In the garish stadium light, the box was revealed as worn and threadbare, a small wooden container that might have been a discarded jewelry box. And yet it was a legend in the school. For potential victims, it was possible deliverance, protection, a weapon to be used against the might of The Vigils. Others doubted its existence: Archie Costello would never allow that sort of thing. But here was the black box now. Out in the open. In front of the whole frigging school. And Archie Costello looking at it, reaching out his hand to draw the marble."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"THE GOOBER ARRIVED at the last moment and made his way through the turmoil to the top of the bleachers. He’d been reluctant to come. He had washed his hands of the school and its cruelties and hadn’t wanted to witness Jerry’s daily humiliations. The school also reminded him of his own betrayals and defections. For three days, he’d been home in bed. Sick. He wasn’t at all sure whether he’d really been sick or whether his conscience had revolted, infecting his body, leaving him weak and nauseous. At any rate, the bed had become his private world, a small safe place without people, without The Vigils, without Brother Leon, a world with no chocolates to sell, no rooms to destroy, no people to destroy. But one of the guys called up and told him about the fight between Jerry and Janza. And how the raffle tickets would control the fight. The Goober had moaned in protest. The bed had become unbearable. He had tossed and turned all day, prowling the bed like an animal seeking sleep, oblivion. He didn’t want to go to the fight—Jerry couldn’t possibly win. But he couldn’t stay in bed, either. Finally, desperate, he had gotten out of bed, and dressed hurriedly, ignoring the protests of his parents. He had taken the bus across town and walked half a mile to the stadium. Now, he huddled in the seat, looking down at the platform, listening to Carter explaining the rules of the crazy fight. Terrible."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
02:30|Vigils|"Brother Jacques stalked away. Archie and Leon watched him go. Archie smiled inside. But he masked his feelings. Leon was on his side. Beautiful. Leon and The Vigils and Archie. What a great year it was going to be."|"The Chocolate War"|"Robert Cormier"
