"ap > 02:00"|"past two o’clock"|"I had thought my migraines, being so clearly psychosomatic, had been exorcized by my psychotherapy, but they returned last night with a vengeance. Where one twinge had been there now are seven. Perhaps La Busk, being an initiate to the mysteries, was able to work some countermagic to Dr. Mieris’s cure; perhaps it was simply that I stayed up past two o’clock in a fit of scribbling. I don’t yet have enough distance from it to judge whether the poem was worth such a price. Though who knows? Perhaps it was the migraine brought on the poem."|"Camp Concentration"|"Thomas M. Disch"
12:00|noon|"So much for the life of the mind; the notable event of the day was the visitation, shortly after breakfast (at noon) of the fabled Mordecai Washington. He came unannounced by any guard, knocked but didn’t wait to be invited in. “May I?” he asked, having already done so."|"Camp Concentration"|"Thomas M. Disch"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"Who I liked best was Barry Meade. I’m always pleased to meet people fatter than myself. Meade is hung up on movies, and at two o’clock, when George had to be sedated for his nap (poor George is in bad shape, but everyone I asked seems to have a different notion of the cause), he took me to the little projection room three levels down and showed me a montage he has made of McNamara’s policy speeches and screaming women, clipped out of old horror movies. Hilarity mounting to hysteria. Barry, very cool, kept apologizing for imperceptible nuances of error."|"Camp Concentration"|"Thomas M. Disch"
"ap 04:30"|4:30|"4:30: George was awake again, but he ignored me for a math book. I begin to have the feeling that, like a child visiting childless relatives for a holiday, the responsibility for my entertainment is being parceled out among them. It happened in the afternoon, at least, that I came under the care of one who was introduced to be simply as “the Bishop.” I suspect it is his dandified clothes earned him the nickname. He exposited the social order that has evolved here. In brief, it stands thus: that Mordecai, by main strength and charisma, is the unchallenged czar of a benevolent anarchy. The Bishop comes to Camp A. not out of the brig but from an Army mental hospital, where he had been two years suffering from total amnesia. He made a fascinating, droll, and scary recital of his multiple suicide attempts. He once drank a whole quart of lead paint. Yech."|"Camp Concentration"|"Thomas M. Disch"
12:00|noonday|"The cuisine. Food here is unbelievably good. Today, for example, from an immense choice of breakfasts, I had fried bananas, shined eggs in a peppery tomato sauce, sausages, hot popovers, and capuchino. At noonday, lunching with Barry Meade and the Bishop in the latter’s cell, I had a halfdozen Bluepoint oysters, a watercress salad, ortilans on a bed of wild rice, cold asparagus, and, for dessert, a dame blanche with soured whipped cream and grenadine. If ever a meal cried out for champagne it was this, but because neither of my lunch partners could or would drink, I settled on Oulmes, a Moroccan mineral water. (If I can’t have champagne, I know at least that I’m causing someone a lot of trouble.) The evening meal is the chief social opportunity of the day for most of the prisoners, and no one hurries through it. From the many excellent possibilities, I selected turtle soup; an hors d’oeuvre of sweetbreads; Caesar salad; a rainbow trout, broiled over a wood fire; rehmedaillon with a red currant sauce; roasted carrots, French beans with almonds, and a strange puffy kind of potato; and for dessert a double portion of Wienerschmarm. (I’ve been putting on weight as never before, since never before have I had a chance to eat like this day after day–or so little reason to concern myself with my quote figure unquote. I am considered a prodigy by the other prisoners, who have no better appetite than one would expect of condemned men, who are moreover deadly ill. They insist on these banquets in a spirit of perversity: “Let us eat cake!”)"|"Camp Concentration"|"Thomas M. Disch"
00:00|midnight|"Busk rose to her feet. “Pray until midnight, it’s your production. But might I ask you, as we seem to have abundant time, the purpose of these various devices? Alchemists of the classic era must certainly have got by with simpler artifacts. When I asked the same question of two engineers this afternoon, they were unable to enlighten me, or themselves, and so I had hoped that you …”"|"Camp Concentration"|"Thomas M. Disch"
