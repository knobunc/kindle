"ap << 08:00"|"well before eight o'clock"|"TONIGHT,  I  find  myself  here in a  guest house  in  the  city  of  Salisbury.  The  first day of my trip is now completed, and all in all, I must say I am quite satisfied. This expedition began this morning almost an hour later than I had planned, despite my having  completed  my  packing  and  loaded  the  Ford  with  all  necessary  items  well before eight o'clock. What with Mrs Clements and the girls also gone for the week, I  suppose  I  was  very  conscious  of  the  fact  that  once  I  departed,  Darlington  Hall would  stand  empty  for  probably  the  first  time  this  century  -  perhaps  for  the  first time since the day it was built. It was an odd feeling and perhaps accounts for why I  delayed  my  departure  so  long,  wandering  around  the  house  many  times  over, checking one last time that all was in order."|"The Remains of the Day"|"Kazuo Ishiguro"
"ap > 04:00"|"shortly  after  four  o'clock"|"I  would  suppose  it  was  shortly  after  four  o'clock  that  I  left  the  guest  house  and ventured out into the streets of Salisbury. The wide, airy nature of the streets here give  the  city  a  marvellously  spacious  feel,  so  that  I  found  it  most  easy  to  spend some hours just strolling in the gently warm sunshine. Moreover, I discovered the city  to  be  one  of  many  charms;  time  and  again,  I  found  myself  wandering  past delightful  rows  of  old  timber-fronted  houses,  or  crossing  some  little  stone footbridge over one of the many streams that flow through the city. And of course, I  did  not  fail  to  visit  the  fine  cathedral,  much  praised  by  Mrs  Symons  in  her volume.  This  august  building  was  hardly  difficult  for  me  to  locate,  its  looming spire being ever-visible wherever one goes in Salisbury. Indeed, as I was making my way back to this guest house this evening, I glanced back over my shoulder on a number of occasions and was met each time by a view of the sun setting behind that great spire."|"The Remains of the Day"|"Kazuo Ishiguro"

"~ 19:36"|"around 1936"|"As things turned out, that particular visit was simply the first of a whole series of such  'unofficial'  meetings  between  Lord  Halifax  and  the  German  Ambassador  of that  time,  Herr  Ribbentrop.  But  on  that  first  night,  Lord  Halifax  had  arrived  in  a mood of great wariness; virtually his first words on being shown in were: ""Really, Darlington, I don't know what you've put me up to here. I know I shall be sorry."" Herr  Ribbentrop  not  being  expected  for  a  further  hour  or  so,  his  lordship  had suggested to his guest a tour of Darlington Hall - a strategy which had helped many a nervous visitor to relax. However, as I went about my business, all I could hear for  some  time  was  Lord  Halifax,  in  various  parts  of  the  building,  continuing  to express his doubts about the evening ahead, and Lord Darlington trying in vain to reassure  him.  But  then  at  one  point  I  overheard  Lord  Halifax  exclaiming:  ""My goodness,  Darlington,  the  silver  in  this  house  is  a  delight.""  I  was  of  course  very pleased to hear this at the time, but what was for me the truly satisfying corollary to  this  episode  came  two  or  three  days  later,  when  Lord  Darlington  remarked  to me:  ""By  the  way,  Stevens,  Lord  Halifax  was  jolly  impressed  with  the  silver  the other night. Put him into a quite different frame of mind altogether."" These were - I recollect it clearly - his lordship's actual words and so it is not simply my fantasy that  the  state  of  the  silver  had  made  a  small,  but  significant  contribution  towards the easing of relations between Lord Halifax and Herr Ribbentrop that evening. It is probably apt at this point to say a few words concerning Herr Ribbentrop. It is, of course, generally accepted today that Herr Ribbentrop was a trickster: that it was Hitler's  plan  throughout  those  years  to  deceive  England  for  as  long  as  possible concerning  his  true  intentions,  and  that  Herr  Ribbentrop's  sole  mission  in  our country was to orchestrate this deception. As I say, this is the commonly held view and  I  do  not  wish  to  differ  with  it  here.  It  is,  however,  rather  irksome  to  have  to hear people talking today as though they were never for a moment taken in by Herr Ribbentrop - as though Lord Darlington was alone in believing Herr Ribbentrop an honourable gentleman and developing a working relationship with him.  The truth is that Herr Ribbentrop was, throughout the thirties, a well-regarded figure, even a glamorous one, in the very best houses. Particularly around 1936 and 1937, I can recall  all  the  talk  in  the  servants'  hall  from  visiting  staff  revolving  around  'the German Ambassador', and it was clear from what was said that many of the most distinguished ladies and gentlemen in this country were quite enamoured of him. It is, as I say, irksome to have to hear the way these same people now talk of those times,  and  in  particular,  what  some  have  said  concerning  his  lordship.  The  great hypocrisy of these persons would be instantly obvious to. you were you to see just a  few  of  their  own  guest  lists  from  those  days;  you  would  see  then  not  only  the extent  to  which  Herr  Ribbentrop  dined  at  these  same  persons'  tables,  but  that  he often did so as guest of honour."|"The Remains of the Day"|"Kazuo Ishiguro"
"ap 10:30"|"ten thirty"|"""I will speak to the two employees in my pantry tomorrow morning at ten thirty. I would  be  grateful  then,  Miss  Kenton,  if  you  would  send  them  along.  I  leave  it entirely to yourself whether or not you inform them beforehand as to the nature of what I am going to say to them."""|"The Remains of the Day"|"Kazuo Ishiguro"
"ap 10:30"|"Ten thirty"|"""Miss Kenton, let me suggest to you that you are hardly well placed to be passing judgements of such a high and mighty nature. The fact is, the world of today is a very  complicated  and  treacherous  place.  There  are  many  things  you  and  I  are simply  not  in  a  position  to  understand  concerning,  say,  the  nature  of  Jewry. Whereas his lordship, I might venture, is somewhat better placed to judge what is for  the  best.  Now,  Miss  Kenton,  I  really  must  retire.  I  thank  you  again  for  the cocoa. Ten thirty tomorrow morning. Send the two employees concerned, please."" It  was  evident  from  the  moment  the  two  maids  stepped  into  my  pantry  the following  morning  that  Miss  Kenton  had  already  spoken  to  them,  for  they  both came  in  sobbing.  I  explained  the  situation  to  them  as  briefly  as  possible, underlining that their work had been satisfactory and that they would, accordingly, receive  good  references.  As  I  recall,  neither  of  them  said  anything  of  note throughout  the  whole  interview,  which  lasted  perhaps  three  or  four  minutes,  and they left sobbing just as they had arrived."|"The Remains of the Day"|"Kazuo Ishiguro"
"ap < 08:00"|"a little before eight o'clock"|"The fact that I am now here, the fact that I came to be to all intents and purposes at the  mercy  of  Mr  and  Mrs  Taylor's  generosity  on  this  night,  is  attributable  to  one foolish,  infuriatingly  simple  oversight:  namely,  I  allowed  the  Ford  to  run  out  of petrol. What with this and the trouble yesterday concerning the lack of water in the radiator,  it  would  not  be  unreasonable  for  an  observer  to  believe  such  general disorganization endemic to my nature. It may be pointed out, of course, that as far as  long-distance  motoring  is  concerned,  I  am  something  of  a  novice,  and  such simple oversights are only to be expected. And yet, when one remembers that good organization and foresight are qualities that lie at the very heart of one's profession, it is hard to avoid the feeling that one has, somehow, let oneself down again. But  it  is  true,  I  had  been  considerably  distracted  during  the  last  hour  or  so  of motoring  prior  to  the  petrol  running  out.  I  had  planned  to  lodge  the  night  in  the town of Tavistock, where I arrived a little before eight o'clock. At the town's main inn,  however,  I  was  informed  all  the  rooms  were  occupied  on  account  of  a  local agricultural fair. Several other establishments were suggested to me, but though I called at each, I was met every time with the same apology. Finally, at a boarding house on the edge of the town, the landlady suggested I motor on several miles to a roadside inn run by a relative of hers - which, she assured me, was bound to have vacancies, being too far out of Tavistock to be affected by the fair. She had given me thorough directions, which had seemed clear enough at the time, and  it  is  impossible'Â·  to  say  now  whose  fault  it  was  that  I  subsequently  failed  to find any trace of this roadside establishment. Instead, after fifteen minutes or so of motoring, I found myself out on a long road curving across bleak, open moorland. On  either  side  of  me  were  what  appeared  to  be  fields  of  marsh,  and  a  mist  was rolling  across  my  path.  To  my  left,  I  could  see  the  last  glow  of  the  sunset.  The skyline  was  broken  here  and  there  by  the  shapes  of  barns  and  farmhouses  some way away over the fields, but otherwise, I appeared to have left behind all signs of community."|"The Remains of the Day"|"Kazuo Ishiguro"
"> 00:00"|"past  midnight"|"As  I  recall,  I  was  rung  for  late  one  night  -  it  was  past  midnight  -  to  the  drawing room where his lordship had been entertaining three gentlemen since dinner. I had, naturally,  been  called  to  the  drawing  room  several  times  already  that  night  to replenish refreshments, and had observed on these occasions the gentlemen deep in conversation  over  weighty  issues.  When  I  entered  the  drawing  room  on  this  last occasion,  however,  all the gentlemen  stopped  talking  and  looked  at  me.  Then  his lordship said:"|"The Remains of the Day"|"Kazuo Ishiguro"

"ap 03:00"|"three o'clock"|"My own table is on the village square side of the room and I have thus spent much of the past hour watching the rain falling on the square, and upon the Ford and one or two other vehicles stationed outside. The rain has now steadied somewhat, but it is still sufficiently hard as to discourage one from going out and wandering around the village. Of course, the possibility has occurred to me that I might set off now to meet Miss Kenton; but then in my letter, I informed her I would be calling at three o'clock, and I do not think it wise to surprise her by arriving any earlier. It would seem  quite  likely  then,  if  the  rain  does  not  cease  very  shortly,  that  I  will  remain here drinking tea until the proper time comes for me to set off. I have ascertained from the young woman who served me lunch that the address where Miss Kenton is  presently  residing  is  some  fifteen  minutes'  walk  away,  which  implies  I  have  at least another forty minutes to wait."|"The Remains of the Day"|"Kazuo Ishiguro"
"ap 07:30"|"seven  thirty"|"This  present  downpour  is  something  of  a  surprise,  since  the  day  started  with  the bright  morning  sunshine  I  have  been  blessed  with  each  morning  since  leaving Darlington Hall. In fact, the day had generally begun well with a breakfast of fresh farm eggs and toast, provided for me by Mrs Taylor, and with Dr Carlisle calling by  at  seven  thirty  as  promised,  I  was  able  to  take  my  leave  of  the  Taylors  -  who continued  not  to  hear  of  remuneration  -  before  any  further  embarrassing conversations had had a chance to develop."|"The Remains of the Day"|"Kazuo Ishiguro"
"ap ~ 09:00"|"around nine o'clock"|"It was around nine o'clock that I crossed the border into Cornwall. This was at least three hours before the rain began and the clouds were still all of a brilliant white. In fact,  many  of  the  sights  that  greeted  me  this  morning  were  among  the  most charming I  have so  far  encountered.  It  was  unfortunate,  then,  that I  could not  for much  of  the  time  give  to  them  the  attention  they  warranted;  for  one  may  as  well declare  it,  one  was  in  a  condition  of  some  preoccupation  with  the  thought  that  - barring  some  unseen  complication  -  one  would  be  meeting  Miss  Kenton  again before the day's end. So it was, then, that while speeding along between large open fields,  no  human  being  or  vehicle  apparent  for  miles,  or  else  steering  carefully through  marvellous  little  villages,  some  no  more  than  a  cluster  of  a  few  stone cottages, I found myself yet again turning over certain recollections from the past. And now, as I sit here in Little Compton, here in the dining room of this pleasant hotel with a little time on my hands, watching the rain splashing on the pavements of the village square outside, I am unable to prevent my mind from continuing to wander along these same tracks."|"The Remains of the Day"|"Kazuo Ishiguro"
"ap 08:30"|"eight thirty"|"""Now remember, my boy. I'm trusting you."" To which Mr Cardinal muttered with irritation:  ""Yes,  yes,  you  have  my  word.""  Then  their  footsteps  separated,  his lordship's going towards his study, Mr Cardinal's towards the library. At almost precisely eight thirty, there came the sound of motor cars pulling up in the courtyard. I opened the door to a chauffeur, and past his shoulder I could see some  police  constables  dispersing  to  various  points  of  the  grounds.  The  next moment, I was showing in two very distinguished gentlemen, who were met by his lordship in the hall and ushered quickly into the drawing room. Ten minutes or so later came the sound of another car and I opened the door to Herr Ribbentrop, the German Ambassador, by now no stranger to Darlington Hall. His lordship emerged to meet him and the two gentlemen appeared to exchange complicit glances before disappearing  together  into  the  drawing  room.  When  a  few  minutes  later  I  was called in to provide refreshments, the four gentlemen were discussing the relative merits of different sorts of sausage,  and the  atmosphere  seemed  on  the surface at least quite convivial."|"The Remains of the Day"|"Kazuo Ishiguro"
