I opened and closed the Velcro a few times to look at his face. Then I noticed that underneath where I cut it out it said, A memorial service will be—I couldn’t read the rest. I had to take the photograph out and piece the two parts together. A memorial service will be held Saturday, October 7, at 10 am at Central Synagogue."|"The History of Love"|"Nicole Krauss"
"ap 10:15"|"quarter past ten"|"I thought: Bruno. Why hadn’t he come? I might not have answered had he knocked. Still. No doubt he’d heard me, unless he had on his Walkman. Even then. A lamp had crashed to the floor, and I’d overturned all the chairs. I was about to go up and knock on his door when I looked at the clock. It was already quarter past ten. I like to think the world wasn’t ready for me, but maybe the truth is that I wasn’t ready for the world. I’ve always arrived too late for my life. I ran to the bus stop. Or rather, hobbled, hiked up trouser legs, did a little skip-scamper-stop-and-pant, hiked up trouser legs, stepped, dragged, stepped, dragged, etcetera. I caught the bus uptown. We sat in traffic. Doesn’t this thing go any faster? I said loudly. The woman next to me got up and moved to another seat. Maybe I slapped her thigh in my effusiveness, I don’t know. A man in an orange jacket and snakeskin-print pants stood up and started to sing a song. Everyone turned to look out the window until they realized he wasn’t asking for money. He was just singing."|"The History of Love"|"Nicole Krauss"
"ap < 01:00"|"near one"|"I wanted to ask where he’d been buried; the newspaper hadn’t said. Suddenly I was filled with regret that I’d bought my own plot so prematurely. If I’d known, I could have joined him. Tomorrow. Or the next day. I’d been afraid of being left to the dogs. I’d gone to Mrs. Freid’s stone setting at Pinelawn, and it had seemed like a nice place. A Mr. Simchik showed me around and gave me a pamphlet. I’d been imagining something under a tree, a weeping willow perhaps, maybe a little bench. But. When he told me the price my heart sank. He showed me my options, a few plots that were either too close to the road or where the grass was balding. Nothing at all with a tree? I asked. Simchik shook his head. A bush? He licked a finger and rustled through his papers. He hemmed and hawed, but finally he gave in. We may have something, he said, it’s more than you were planning to spend but you can pay in installments. It was at the far end, in the suburbs of the Jewish part. It wasn’t exactly under a tree but it was near one, near enough that during the fall some of its leaves might drift down on me. I thought it over. Simchik told me to take my time and went back to the office. I stood in the sunlight. Then I got down on the grass and rolled onto my back. The ground was hard and cold under my raincoat. I watched the clouds pass above. Maybe I fell asleep. The next thing I knew, Simchik was standing above me. Nu? You’ll take it?"|"The History of Love"|"Nicole Krauss"
19:18|1918|"“Where’s Brighton Beach?” I asked. “In England,” my mother said, searching the kitchen cabinets for something she’d misplaced. “I mean the one in New York.” “Near Coney Island, I think.” “How far is Coney Island?” “Maybe half an hour.” “Driving or walking?” “You can take the subway.” “How many stops?” “I don’t know. Why are you so interested in Brighton Beach?” “I have a friend there. His name is Misha and he’s Russian,” I said with admiration. “Just Russian?” my mother asked from inside the cabinet under the kitchen sink. “What do you mean, just Russian?” She stood up and turned to me. “Nothing,” she said, looking at me with the expression she sometimes gets when she’s just thought of something amazingly fascinating. “It’s just that you, for example, are one-quarter Russian, one-quarter Hungarian, one-quarter Polish, and one-quarter German.” I didn’t say anything. She opened a drawer, then closed it. “Actually,” she said, “you could say you’re three-quarters Polish and one-quarter Hungarian, since Bubbe’s parents were from Poland before they moved to Nuremberg, and Grandma Sasha’s town was originally in Belarus, or White Russia, before it became part of Poland.” She opened another cabinet stuffed with plastic bags and started rooting around in it. I turned to go. “Now that I’m thinking about it,” she said, “I suppose you could also say you’re three-quarters Polish and one-quarter Czech, because the town Zeyde came from was in Hungary before 1918, and in Czechoslavakia after, although the Hungarians continued to consider themselves Hungarian, and briefly even became Hungarian again during the Second World War. Of course, you could always just say you’re half Polish, one-quarter Hungarian, and one-quarter English, since Grandpa Simon left Poland and moved to London when he was nine.” She grabbed a piece of paper from the pad by the telephone and started to write vigorously. A minute passed while she scratched away at the page. “Look!” she said, pushing the paper over so I could see it. “You can actually make sixteen different pie charts, each of them accurate!” I looked at the paper. It said:"|"The History of Love"|"Nicole Krauss"
21:30|"nine-thirty at night"|"I raced down to the kitchen, but it was empty. Outside the window, in the middle of our backyard overgrown and full of weeds, was my mother. I pushed open the screen door. “Alma,” I said, catching my breath. “Hmm?” my mother said. She was holding a gardening trowel. I didn’t have time to stop and think about why she was holding a gardening trowel since it was my father, not her, who’d gardened, and since it was already nine-thirty at night. “What’s her last name?” I asked. “What are you talking about?” my mother said. “Alma,” I said impatiently. “The girl in the book. What’s her last name?” My mother wiped her forehead, leaving a smear of dirt. “Actually, now that you mention it—one of the chapters does mention a surname. But it’s strange, because while all the other names in the book are Spanish, her surname is—” My mother frowned. “What?” I said, excited. “Hers is what?” “Mereminski,” my mother said. “Mereminski,” I repeated. She nodded. “M-E-R-E-M-I-N-S-K-I. Mereminski. Polish. It’s one of the few clues Litvinoff left about where he came from.”"|"The History of Love"|"Nicole Krauss"
00:00|midnight|"A few months later, when it was learned that Isaac Babel had been killed by Moscow’s secret police, it fell to Litvinoff to write the obituary. It was an important assignment and he worked hard on it, trying to strike the right tone for a great writer’s tragic death. He didn’t leave the office until midnight, but as he walked home through the cold night he smiled to himself, believing the obituary was one of his finest. So often the material he had to work with was thin and paltry, and he had to patch something together with a few superlatives, clichés, and false notes of glory in order to commemorate the life, and bolster a sense of loss over the death. But not this time. This time it had been necessary to rise to the material, to struggle to find words for a man who had been a master of words, who had devoted his entire existence to resisting the cliché in the hope of introducing to the world a new way of thinking and writing; a new way, even, of feeling. And whose reward for his labors was death by firing squad."|"The History of Love"|"Nicole Krauss"
00:00|midnight|"Litvinoff knocked for five minutes before he finally heard his friend’s heavy steps on the other side. When the door opened, his friend stood in his bedclothes looking pale and haggard. “What happened?” Litvinoff asked. His friend shrugged and coughed, “Watch out or you’ll catch it, too,” he said, dragging himself back to bed. Litvinoff stood awkwardly in his friend’s cramped room wanting to help, but not knowing how. At last a voice came from the pillows: “A cup of tea would be nice.” Litvinoff hurried to the corner where a makeshift kitchen was set up, and banged around looking for the kettle (“On the stove,” his friend called weakly). While the water boiled, he opened the window to let in a little fresh air, and washed the dirty dishes. When he brought the steaming cup of tea to his friend, he saw that he was shivering with a fever, so he closed the window and went downstairs to ask the landlady for an extra blanket. Eventually his friend fell asleep. Not knowing what else to do, Litvinoff sat down in the only chair in the room and waited. After a quarter of an hour, a cat meowed at the door. Litvinoff let it in, but when she saw that her midnight companion was indisposed she stalked out."|"The History of Love"|"Nicole Krauss"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"As morning broke, Litvinoff saw with relief that the color had returned to his friend’s face. He was sleeping the restful sleep of recovery. When the sun had climbed to the position of eight o’clock, he stood. His legs were stiff. His insides felt scraped out. But he was filled with happiness. He folded THE DEATH OF LEOPOLD GURSKY in half. And here is another thing no one knows about Zvi Litvinoff: for the rest of his life he carried in his breast pocket the page he’d protected all night from becoming real, so that he could buy a little more time—for his friend, for life."|"The History of Love"|"Nicole Krauss"

I told him it was possible. “Well why didn’t you say! In that case her death certificate wouldn’t be here.” “Where would it be?” “New York City Department of Health, Division of Vital Records,” he said, “125 Worth Street, Room 133.

A drop of water fell in my eye. “I don’t know.” “Come on, there must be something.” I sat up in my sleeping bag, rubbed my eye, and looked at my digital watch. There’s a button you can press to make the numbers glow. It also has a built-in compass. “It’s three-twenty-four in the morning,” I said. Bird was asleep in my bed. “I know. I was just wondering. Tell me and I promise I’ll let you go back to sleep. What do you want to be?” I thought, Someone who can survive in subzero temperatures and forage for food and build a snow cave and start a fire out of nothing. “I don’t know.

For this and other reasons my stomach ached. I looked across the hall into Bird’s room. Uncle Julian was asleep with his glasses on, Volume II of The Destruction of the European Jews open on his chest. Bird received the box set as a gift from a cousin of my mother’s who lives in Paris, and who took an interest in him after we met her for tea at her hotel.

Steam rose from the snow. Josef turned to me, smiling. A beautiful child, blond with gray eyes. Gray, like the ocean on a sunless day, or the elephant I saw in the town square when I was his age.

The slide I keep in a jar on the kitchen shelf. I blow on it, drop it in, advance. The picture comes into focus. A house with a yellow door at the edge of a field. It’s the end of autumn. Between the black branches the sky is turning orange, then dark blue. Wood smoke rises from the chimney, and through the window I can almost see my mother leaning over a table.

He kneaded the balls of his feet into my calf. “Please?” he begged. I tried to think, and because I couldn’t remember anything I hadn’t already told him a hundred times, I made up something. “He liked to rock-climb,” I said. “He was a good climber. Once he climbed up a rock that was, like, two hundred feet tall. Somewhere in the Negev, I think.” Bird breathed his hot breath on my neck. “Masada?” he asked. “Could be,” I said. “He just liked it. It was a hobby,” I said. “Did he like to dance?” Bird asked. I had no idea if he liked to dance, but I said, “He loved it. He could even do the tango. He learned it in Buenos Aires. He and Mom danced all the time. He’d move the coffee table against the wall and use the whole room. He used to lift her and dip her and sing in her ear.” “Was I there?” “Sure you were,” I said. “He used to throw you up in the air and catch you.” “How’d he know he wouldn’t drop me?” “He just knew.” “What did he call me?” “Lots of things. Buddy, Little Guy, Punch.” I was making it up as I went. Bird looked unimpressed. “Judah the Maccabee,” I said. “Plain Maccabee. Mac.” “What’s the thing he called me the most?” “I guess it was Emmanuel.” I pretended to think. “No, wait. It was Manny. He used to call you Manny.” “Manny,” Bird said, testing it out. He cuddled closer. “I want to tell you a secret,” he whispered. “Because it’s your birthday.” “What?” “First you have to promise to believe me.” “OK.” “Say ‘I promise.’ ” “I promise.” He took a deep breath. “I think I might be a lamed vovnik.” “A what?” “One of the lamed vovniks,” he whispered. “The thirty-six holy people.” “What thirty-six holy people?” “The ones that the existence of the world depends on.” “Oh, those. Don’t be—” “You promised,” Bird said. I didn’t say anything. “There are always thirty-six at any time,” he whispered. “No one knows who they are. Only their prayers reach God’s ear. That’s what Mr. Goldstein says.” “And you think you might be one of them,” I said. “What else does Mr. Goldstein say?” “He says that when the Messiah comes, he’s going to be one of the lamed vovniks. In every generation there’s one person who has the potential to be the Messiah. Maybe he lives up to it, or maybe he doesn’t. Maybe the world is ready for him, or maybe it isn’t.
