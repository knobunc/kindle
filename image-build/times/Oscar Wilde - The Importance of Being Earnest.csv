"ap 05:00"|"five o'clock"|"ALGERNON. [Stiffly.] I believe it is customary in good society to take some slight refreshment at five o'clock. Where have you been since last Thursday?"|"The Importance of Being Earnest"|"Oscar Wilde"
"ap < 07:00"|"nearly seven"|"ALGERNON. Women only do that when they have called each other a lot of other things first. Now, my dear boy, if we want to get a good table at Willis's, we really must go and dress. Do you know it is nearly seven?"|"The Importance of Being Earnest"|"Oscar Wilde"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"CHASUBLE. [Bowing.] A classical allusion merely, drawn from the Pagan authors. I shall see you both no doubt at Evensong?"|"The Importance of Being Earnest"|"Oscar Wilde"
"ap 05:30"|"half-past five"|"JACK. Oh! I don't see much fun in being christened along with other babies. It would be childish. Would half-past five do?"|"The Importance of Being Earnest"|"Oscar Wilde"
"ap 04:05"|"four- five"|"JACK. You are certainly not staying with me for a whole week as a guest or anything else. You have got to leaveâ€¦ by the four- five train."|"The Importance of Being Earnest"|"Oscar Wilde"
"ap 05:30"|5.30|"GWENDOLEN. [Examines diary through her lorgnettte carefully.] It is certainly very curious, for he asked me to be his wife yesterday afternoon at 5.30. If you would care to verify the incident, pray do so. [Produces diary of her own.] I never travel without my diary. One should always have something sensational to read in the train. I am so sorry, dear Cecily, if it is any disappointment to you, but I am afraid I have the prior claim."|"The Importance of Being Earnest"|"Oscar Wilde"
"ap 05:45"|"quarter to six"|"ALGERNON. You can't possibly ask me to go without having some dinner. It's absurd. I never go without my dinner. No one ever does, except vegetarians and people like that. Besides I have just made arrangements with Dr. Chasuble to be christened at a quarter to six under the name of Ernest."|"The Importance of Being Earnest"|"Oscar Wilde"
00:00|midnight|"LADY BRACKNELL. [In a severe, judicial voice.] Prism! [MISS PRISM bows her head in shame.] Come here, Prism! [MISS PRISM approaches in a humble manner.] Prism! Where is that baby? [General consternation. The CANON starts back in horror. ALGERNON and JACK pretend to be anxious to shield CECILY and GWENDOLEN from hearing the details of a terrible public scandal.] Twenty-eight years ago, Prism, you left Lord Bracknell's house, Number 104, Upper Grosvenor Street, in charge of a perambulator that contained a baby of the male sex. You never returned. A few weeks later, through the elaborate investigations of the Metropolitan police, the perambulator was discovered at midnight, standing by itself in a remote corner of Bayswater. It contained the manuscript of a three-volume novel of more than usually revolting sentimentality. [MISS PRISM starts in involuntary indignation.] But the baby was not there! [Every one looks at MISS PRISM.] Prism! Where is that baby? [A pause.]"|"The Importance of Being Earnest"|"Oscar Wilde"
