Among the abundant new laws were several dealing with sanitation. Every Friday between May and December, every home owner was to gather the dirt, garbage, and refuse from around his house and pile it near the gutter before 10 A.M., when the city would pick it up. But many did not bother to put their trash out early in the morning."|"The Big Oyster"|"Mark Kurlansky"

A schooner would carry about seven hundred bushels, about fifty thousand pounds, through Fire Island Inlet at the most dangerous times of year, the R months. The Long Island Rail Road reached Sayville in 1868, and by 1870, some oysters were being shipped by rail. From around 1900 until World War I, the Long Island Express Company had four express oyster trains a day, a seventy-five-minute ride, at 9 A.M., 11 A.M., 2 P.M., and 5 P.M.

00:00|midnight|"The oyster-cellars, with their bright lamps casting broad gleams of red light across the street, are now in full tide, and every instant sees them swallow up at one entrance a party of rowdy and half-drunken young men, on their way to the theater, the gambling-house, the bowling-saloon, or the brothel—or most likely to all in turn—while another is vomited up the other stairway, having already swilled their fill of oysters and bad brandy, and garnished their reeking mouths each with an atrocious cigar, which the barkeeper recommended as “full-flavored.” If we step down one of these wide entrances, we shall see a long counter gorgeously decked with crystal decanters and glasses, richly carved and gilt and the wall ornamented with a voluptuous picture of a naked Venus—perhaps the more seductive from being exquisitely painted. Before the long marble bar are arranged some dozen or score of individuals, waiting their turns for liquor—while on the other side a man with his shirt sleeves rolled up and his face in a fiery glow, seems to be pulling long ribbons of julep out of a tin cup. At the other end of the room is a row of little stalls, each fitted up with its gasburner, its red curtain, its little table and voluptuous picture, and all occupied with busy eaters. In the rear of these boxes is a range of larger apartments called “private rooms,” where men and women enter promiscuously, eat, drink and make merry, and disturb the whole neighborhood with their obscene and disgusting revels, prolonged far beyond midnight. The women of course are all of one kind—but among the men you would find, if you looked curiously, reverend judges and juvenile delinquents, pious and devout hypocrites, and the undisguised libertines and debauchees. Gamblers and Fancy men, high flyers and spoonies, genteel pick-pockets and burglars, even sometimes mingle in the detestable orgies of these detestable caverns; and the shivering policeman who crawls sleepily by at the dead of night, and mechanically raps his bludgeon upon the pavement as he hears the boisterous mirth below, may be reminding a grave functionary of the city that it is time to go home to his wife and children after the discharge of his “arduous public duties.”"|"The Big Oyster"|"Mark Kurlansky"

Four nights later was the banquet in his honor at the premier hotel, City Hotel, occupying an entire block of Broadway between Cedar and Thames, with food by Gardiner’s, reputedly the city’s most elegant caterer. The first three of the extensive five courses included oysters. The first course consisted of three soups, including oyster “potage,” and fish—trout, bass, and shad—all products of the Hudson River. The second course offered six different cold dishes, including oysters in aspic, as well as roasted sirloin, saddle of mutton, goose, veal, turkeys, and capons—note the plural—and a choice of five boiled meats, including boiled turkey with oyster sauce and stewed terrapin. At last the entrées arrived, which included a total of nineteen dishes including “Oyster Pies.” Next was the game course, all from New York’s woodlands: wild turkey, canvasback ducks, venison, and bear. This was followed by the fourth course, twelve desserts and six decorative pyramids. The last course was nuts and fruit. The soups came out at seven and the nuts at midnight and Dickens left a half hour later. Americans had again lived up to their reputation for eating fast and copiously."|"The Big Oyster"|"Mark Kurlansky"

Even this, at slightly faster than seventeen oysters a minute, did not come close to the oysters-per-minute record. In the late 1870s, Rhode Island and New York champions went down to Philadelphia to take on the champions from the South. Billy Lowney, who opened oysters in the Robert Pettis shop in Providence, led the North, defeating the Southern champion by opening 100 oysters in three minutes and three seconds, establishing a new world record for 100 oysters. Most people could not pick up and put down 100 oysters in that amount of time.

"ap 05:00"|500|"The recent oyster opening contest held in Keyport, New Jersey was watched with considerable interest by those who are paying high prices to shuckers. The result of the contest was remarkable. The record time was 20 minutes and 23 seconds, and the number of oysters opened in this length of time was 500. The first prize was $300. The wholesale dealers of New York City pay their shuckers $1.00 for every thousand oysters opened. If we assume that this shucker could keep this record up for a working day of 10 hours, he would earn about $14.00, and if he worked six days a week, he would earn $84.00 per week, and the enormous salary of $336.00 per month. We do not wonder therefore that the New York oyster dealer thinks the cost of shucking is too high."|"The Big Oyster"|"Mark Kurlansky"

It was a much quieter market, with only eighty vendors who called out to passersby, hoping to get some needed business. They serviced mostly the residents of nearby tenements, who ate very little most of the week. But the poor had a tradition of feasting one day a week and on Saturdays the Catherine Market was overflowing with retail shoppers. The emphasis in the Catherine Market was on low prices and the shoppers would barter with the vendors. The Catherine Market vendors reflected the ethnic diversity that was characteristic of New York, with Jewish, Irish, and Chinese salespeople. This market died down after midnight, when the city’s poorest would quietly arrive, hoping for affordable final prices for whatever had not sold. Other markets included the sizable Center Market, with 161 stands, and Clinton, with 158, and the smaller 78-stand Tompkins, 70-stand Jefferson, 66-stand Essex, and even a little 37-stand Union Market."|"The Big Oyster"|"Mark Kurlansky"
