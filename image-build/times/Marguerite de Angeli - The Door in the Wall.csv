"> 12:00"|"past noon"|"“The village lies just yonder about an hour’s journey,” he said. “The road goes through the wood, over the downs, crosses a bridge, then winds up the hill where thou’lt find a butter cross where the market is held. Likely there’ll be nought to buy there, as ’tis past noon. Beyond the cross the road turns more northerly and there is a fork where it divides. Beyond that I know not how it goes.”"|"The Door in the Wall"|"Marguerite de Angeli"
12:00|noon|"At noon the little company stopped at the sign of the Shepherd’s Bush for ale to go with their bread and cheese. The host sat himself down beside the friar and asked how things went in London."|"The Door in the Wall"|"Marguerite de Angeli"
00:00|midnight|"“Come midnight, when ’tis darkest, I shall take yon minstrel, and thou the friar. Be sure to get the leather bag safe.

00:00|midnight|"When the midnight office was said in the church, the whole household trooped back to the Hall, where tables were spread for the feast. Platters were heaped with food and carried in by pages and esquires. A giant boar’s head came first in order, then pasties and whole suckling pigs, pigeons and geese roasted with feathers on. The meats were followed by flaming puddings and bowls of wassail, chestnuts, and apples."|"The Door in the Wall"|"Marguerite de Angeli"
