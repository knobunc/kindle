"ap 23:57"|"three minutes before twelve"|"It looked like an ordinary pot: squat and light brown, with a small amount of blue
         glaze as trim. Stephanie was not an expert potter. This pot was one of the first she
         threw, at least outside of her ceramics class in high school. Naturally, one of her
         first pots would go to Fat. She and he had a close relationship. When he’d get upset,
         Stephanie would quiet him down by supercharging him with her hashpipe. The pot was
         unusual in one way, however. In it slumbered God. He slumbered in the pot for a long
         time, for almost too long. There is a theory among some religions that God intervenes
         at the eleventh hour. Maybe that is so; I couldn’t say. In Horselover Fat’s case God
         waited until three minutes before twelve, and even then what he did was barely enough:
         barely enough and virtually too late. You can’t hold Stephanie responsible for that;
         she threw the pot, glazed it and fired it as soon as she had the kickwheel. She did
         her best to help her friend Fat, who, like Gloria before him, was beginning to die.
         She helped her friend the way Fat had tried to help his friend, only Stephanie did
         a better job. But that was the difference between her and Fat. In a crisis she knew
         what to do. Fat did not. Therefore Fat is alive today and Gloria is not. Fat had a
         better friend than Gloria had had. Perhaps he would have wanted it the other way around
         but the option was not his. We do not serve up people to ourselves; the universe does.
         The universe makes certain decisions and on the basis of these decisions some people
         live and some people die. This is a harsh law. But every creature yields to it out
         of necessity. Fat got God, and Gloria Knudson got death. It is unfair and Fat would
         be the first person to say so. Give him credit for that."|"The VALIS Trilogy"|"Philip K. Dick"
04:00|"four A.M."|"Yet in all fairness, I have to admit that God—or someone calling himself God, a distinction
         of mere semantics—had fired precious information at Horselover Fat’s head by which
         their son Christopher’s life had been saved. Some people God cures and some he slays.
         Fat denies that God slays anyone. Fat says, God never harms anyone. Illness, pain
         and undeserved suffering arise not from God but from elsewhere, to which I say, How
         did this elsewhere arise? Are there two gods? Or is part of the universe out from
         under God’s control? Fat used to quote Plato. In Plato’s cosmology, noös or Mind is persuading ananke or blind necessity—or blind chance, according to some experts—into submission. Noös happened to come along and to its surprise discovered blind chance: chaos, in other
         words, onto which noös imposes order (although how this “persuading” is done Plato nowhere says). According
         to Fat, my friend’s cancer consisted of disorder not yet persuaded into sentient shape.
         Noös or God had not yet gotten around to her, to which I said, “Well, when he did get
         around to her it was too late.” Fat had no answer for that, at least in terms of oral
         rebuttal. Probably he sneaked off and wrote about it in his journal. He stayed up
         to four A.M. every night scratching away in his journal. I suppose all the secrets of the universe
         lay in it somewhere amid the rubble."|"The VALIS Trilogy"|"Philip K. Dick"

         Platonist or otherwise, this is the sequences of words that framed me, that made me
         what I am: this is my source, this vision and report, this view of final things. I do not call myself a
         Christian but I cannot forget this view, this wonder. I remember the night I read
         that final canto of Paradiso, read it—truly read it—for the first time; I had that infected tooth and I hurt hideously,
         unbearably, so I sat up all night drinking bourbon—straight—and reading Dante, and
         at nine A.M. the next day I drove to the dentist’s without phoning, without an appointment, showed
         up with tears dripping down my face, demanding that Dr. Davidson do something for
         me . . . which he did. So that final canto is deeply impressed onto and into me; it
         is associated with terrible pain, and pain that went on for hours, into the night,
         so there was no one to talk to; and out of that I came to fathom the ultimate things
         in my own way, not a formal or official way but a way nonetheless."|"The VALIS Trilogy"|"Philip K. Dick"

         understanding in which I knew spiritual reality at last came in connection with emergency

         bourbon at that—and simply reading Dante without listening to the stereo or eating—there
         was no way I could eat—and suffering, and it was all worth it; I will never forget
         it. I am no different, then, from Timothy Archer. To me, too, books are real and alive; the voices of human beings issue forth from
         them and compel my assent, the way God compels our assent to the world, as Tim said.

         nine A.M. and I could get into my fucking car and shoot out into traffic and Dr. Davidson’s
