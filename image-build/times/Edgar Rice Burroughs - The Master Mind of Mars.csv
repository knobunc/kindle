I wanted someone with whom to talk, but your slaves knew only that you were not there Ð where you were they did not know Ð so I set out to search for you.” My heart went into my sandals. “I guessed that you were in one of the laboratories, but though I visited several I di?d not find you.” My heart arose with the lightness of a feather. “Since my own transference I have been cursed with restlessness and sleeplessness, so that I could almost wish for the return of my old corpse Ð the youth of my body harmonizes not with the antiquity of my brain. It is filled with latent urges and desires that comport illy with the serious subject matter of my mind.”"|"The Master Mind of Mars"|"Edgar Rice Burroughs"

Now, as I needed a full night for what I had in mind and as Ras Thavas walked until midnight, I was compelled to forego everything for that evening, but the following morning I persuaded him to walk early on the pretext that I should like to go beyond the enclosure and see something of Barsoom beside the inside of his laboratories and his gardens. I had little confidence that he would grant my request, yet he did so. I am sure he never would have done it had he possessed his old body; but thus greatly had young blood changed Ras Thavas."|"The Master Mind of Mars"|"Edgar Rice Burroughs"
