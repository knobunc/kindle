A few months beforehand, two geneticists had come to the White House to stand next to President Bill Clinton for an announcement. “We are here to celebrate the completion of the first survey of the entire human genome,” Clinton said. “Without a doubt, this is the most important, most wondrous map ever produced by humankind.”"|"She Has Her Mother's Laugh"|"Carl Zimmer"
"ap 01:00"|one|"Before unlocking hidden intelligence, Goddard would first need a way to scientifically measure it. He wanted to assign intelligence a number, the way doctors measured blood pressure or body temperature or weight. In Goddard’s day, doctors regularly diagnosed children as imbeciles and idiots, but they did so mostly by intuition. Goddard tried to craft a test that could drill down to the biological basis of intelligence. He guessed that the speed of the nervous system was crucial, and so he would put Vineland students in front of an electric key and tell them to tap it with their finger as fast as they could. It worked badly. Some students couldn’t even understand what he wanted them to do. Goddard tried other tests. He had the students squeeze a dynamometer as hard as they could, to thread needles, to draw straight lines. But whenever Goddard sat down to analyze the test scores, he found they didn’t hang together. A student might do well at one and miserably at another."|"She Has Her Mother's Laugh"|"Carl Zimmer"

It raised the graduation rate of children by more than 5 percent, for instance; among children with mothers who didn’t finish high school, the rate rose by more than 10 percent. But it did not help children’s intelligence test scores in the long run. At three and four years of age, their scores improved, only to drift back down by first grade."|"She Has Her Mother's Laugh"|"Carl Zimmer"
