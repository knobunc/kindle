12:00|noon|"Floodlights came on around the tank. The hatches were suspended in watery noon brightness. He felt hands under his arms and around his legs and saw the three other cosmonaut trainees vaguely from the corners of his foggy faceplate. They kicked away from the hatch complex and hauled him higher, higher to his grandmother's archaic and welcome heaven."|Eon|"Greg Bear"
"ap 01:00"|"one o'clock"|"He sat on a lightweight director's chair and propped his feet on the window frame. His dark eyes, underscored by fatigue lines, focused on a distant point at one o'clock high where the plasma tube butted up against the cap. Through the tube's diffuse glow, it was difficult to make out the hundred-meter-wide bore hole that pushed through the cap into the second chamber. The bore hole opened five kilometers above the atmosphere in the chamber."|Eon|"Greg Bear"
"ap 01:59"|"one of two"|"Lanier swung around a gentle curve and brought the truck to a stop in the middle of the street. He pointed to a large, umber-toned building on the northern edge of the greenspace. ""That's one of the libraries—one of two we're investigating now. All the others are closed off."""|Eon|"Greg Bear"
"ap 03:00"|"three o'clock"|"""Oh."" She turned her attention to the sea, a uniform expanse of rippling blue-gray, stretching north to a bank of fog against the cap. Above the gray expanse she could see the chamber's arch, and to the northwest and northeast the distant edges of the fog bank, and a shoreline at three o'clock high."|Eon|"Greg Bear"
"ap 02:00"|"two o'clock"|"""Look over your shoulder at two o'clock, Comrade Lieutenant Colonel,"" one of his men advised. Mirsky turned around and followed the line of the corporal's thickly protected arm and gloved finger."|Eon|"Greg Bear"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o'clock"|"""Ms. Hoffman says we're at your disposal, but we're to have you in Pasadena, alive and sober, by eight o'clock tomorrow morning."""|Eon|"Greg Bear"
15:00|"three o'clock in the afternoon"|"He was allowed two drinks in a fancy but ancient hangout known as the Polo Lounge, surrounded by aged relics of the bad old days of network television. By three o'clock in the afternoon, two suites in the Beverly Hills Hotel—directly opposite one another—were checked out. The agents efficiently inspected the suite where he would stay and pronounced the rooms safe with a nod to each other."|Eon|"Greg Bear"
"ap 10:15"|ten-fifteen|"At ten-fifteen, there was a light knock on his door. He opened it, and the agent who had driven the limousine from the desert landing site passed him information on two memory blocks. ""Ms. Hoffman sends these to you with her compliments,"" he said. ""We'll be just across the hall, if you need anything."""|Eon|"Greg Bear"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o'clock"|"At eight o'clock the next morning, Lanier walked across the concrete quadrangle of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, briefcase in hand, accompanied by two new agents. He enjoyed the bright sun and the increased weight more now and almost regretted the thought of spending the day in air-conditioned offices. The first of two, perhaps three scheduled sessions would take place in the VIP conference room."|Eon|"Greg Bear"
12:00|noon|"""We're scheduling a meeting with the Russians tomorrow at noon,"" Hoffman said. ""Strictly informal. They've asked that you be there. Mr. Hague's department has pushed very hard for State Department and DOD approval of the meeting. If those talks succeed, there will be other meetings below the cabinet level. And if we can convince the President before next week, perhaps a summit will be arranged."" She blinked slowly in his direction, still focusing somewhere over his shoulder—not quite the thousand-yard stare of a battle-weary veteran, but very nearly."|Eon|"Greg Bear"
14:00|"1400 hours"|"On the opposite side of the compound, a train pulled away from the elevated station. She glanced at her watch; as scheduled, the fourth chamber stop, 1400 hours. The platform was empty; none of the trains were being used for troops, only trucks. The trains were doing their automatic best to keep everything normal."|Eon|"Greg Bear"
14:00|"1400 hours"|"At the northern end of the zero bridge, Lanier glanced at his watch: 1400 hours. The marines nodded to each other and they began crossing on foot, as agreed."|Eon|"Greg Bear"
07:50|"0750 hours"|"Lanier opened his eyes and looked at his wristwatch: 0750 hours. He felt paralyzed. The voices continued in his head, back and forth. His mind was trying to cope with the intolerable—and to find his place in a new situation."|Eon|"Greg Bear"
17:00|"1700 hours"|"By 1700 hours, 6 hours after the storm's first high winds, rain fell through the dust and landed as great drops of mud. In the first compounds, people huddled in the bungalows, both alarmed and thrilled by the sudden change."|Eon|"Greg Bear"
12:00|"1200 hours"|"At 1200 hours the next day, Pogodin aimed the truck's antenna toward the southern bore hole, and Vielgorsky sent a message to Yazykov and Belozersky:"|Eon|"Greg Bear"
00:00|midnight|"Karen had not. As the door irised open, the lights came up and she entered in a very similar robe, this one a golden beige rather than midnight blue. ""Pardon my comeuppance,"" she said, smiling and lifting her hands as if to fend off a rebuff."|Eon|"Greg Bear"
00:00|midnight|"With sunset, the sky dimmed to midnight blue overhead. Where the final flat reddened edge of the sun was being swallowed by the ocean, a dark brown shadow line of cloud began, twisting and veering from the horizon to zenith, where it broke down into frothy streaks, the edge of each streak catching an electric purple gleam. Farley and Carrolson had retired an hour earlier; Frant world days were about forty hours long. Lanier was thinking steadily and was not ready for sleep. He watched the sunset from the patio, Heineman by his side. Patricia had not yet come out of her room after the conversation with Toller."|Eon|"Greg Bear"
"> 12:00"|"just past high noon"|"Walking along the edge of the canal, clutching her clavicle and considering whether or not to reactivate the traction bubble—the sun was becoming uncomfortably hot—Patricia found a road and followed it. Beyond a grove of date palms, she came upon a little, square town made of whitewashed brick, the houses as blocky as benches and about as uniform. Very few people were about; it was just past high noon, and no doubt they were all resting until the day cooled."|Eon|"Greg Bear"
