"> 00:00"|"shortly after midnight"|"Miss Crush got to her feet and came round the table to place a hand on Cribb’s sleeve. She was small and fortyish. She either used rouge, or the excitement of discovering a sensitive had gone to her cheeks. ‘If you will persist with your questions I shall try to answer them, but I really do not mind about the vase. It was taken a week ago last Saturday from the sideboard over there while I was at Dr Probert’s for a seance. The thief got in through the mews at the back of the house and opened a door by removing one of the panes, putting his arm through and unfastening the latch. The servants were in the kitchen and didn’t hear a thing— playing cards, I shouldn’t wonder. I got home shortly after midnight and heard about the broken pane when Annie, my parlour-maid, was locking up half an hour later. It wasn’t until morning that we found the vase had gone.’"|"A Case of Spirits"|"Peter Lovesey"
"ap 10:30"|"Half past ten"|"‘Half past ten,’ said Strathmore. ‘I keep a meticulous record of every seance I attend. He had a hansom waiting for him.’"|"A Case of Spirits"|"Peter Lovesey"
"ap 23:40"|"twenty minutes to twelve"|"‘It was twenty minutes to twelve. I left a few minutes after Miss Crush. Mr Nye, Miss Probert’s fiancé, had very decently gone out to call carriages for us.’"|"A Case of Spirits"|"Peter Lovesey"
19:30|"7.30 p.m."|"Admission Threepence. Gallery Twopence.
Thursday November 12th, 1885, at 7.30 p.m.
INSIDE, AS THE converted and the curious assembled, a harmonium was playing Who are these, like stars appearing, and towards the back of the hall Constable Thackeray was reporting confidentially to Sergeant Cribb on the results of his visits to police stations in Richmond and Belgravia."|"A Case of Spirits"|"Peter Lovesey"
"ap 08:30"|"half past eight"|"‘Sixty-eight point five degrees,’ said Strathmore. ‘That was five minutes ago, at half past eight.’"|"A Case of Spirits"|"Peter Lovesey"
22:20|"10.20 p.m."|"‘A drop to 196,’ said Jowett.
‘And that is at 10.20 p.m.,’ said Strathmore, writing it down.
‘He must have altered his position slightly,’ explained Probert. ‘The instrument is sensitive to the smallest fluctuations in the strength of the contact.’"|"A Case of Spirits"|"Peter Lovesey"
22:25|"10.25 p.m."|"‘Here’s a change. 188,’ reported Jowett.
‘At 10.25 p.m.,’ said Strathmore.
A log shifted in the grate. There was a sharp indrawing of breath from somebody."|"A Case of Spirits"|"Peter Lovesey"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"‘All out. Won’t be back before eleven,’ said Probert. ‘And if you’re thinking that it might have been my wife, I’d advise you to forget it. She’s so damned superstitious that she won’t put her head round the door of her room until you’re out of the house.’"|"A Case of Spirits"|"Peter Lovesey"
"ap 10:40"|"Twenty minutes to eleven"|"It was the work of a few minutes to re-establish the experiment as it had been before the interruption and close the curtain. The sitters reassembled by firelight in the library, Strathmore kneeling at Jowett’s side, pencil poised over pocket-book; Miss Crush with hands on the table and eyes rotated upwards to the ceiling; Probert leaning back in his chair with arms folded, watching the curtain; Nye, still recovering his breath, ogling Alice, who sat reflectively twisting her engagement ring.
‘Twenty minutes to eleven,’ said Strathmore.
‘A reading of 202,’ responded Jowett."|"A Case of Spirits"|"Peter Lovesey"
08:00|"eight in the morning"|"Not a living soul had approached the terrace until eight in the morning, when Cribb appeared and gave the sort of whistle a dog-owner gives when his animal lingers too long in the bushes. ‘I’ve got a job for you, Thackeray,’ he said, as if eleven hours behind a tree had not been employment at all. ‘Cut along to Sloane Square and take the Metropolitan line to Praed Street. It’s a short step from there to Homer Court. Here’s the key to number 10, Professor Quayle’s house. Let yourself in and locate Dr Probert’s missing picture in the umbrella stand. Miss Crush’s vase should be in a cabinet in the bathroom. No need to look surprised, Constable. Quayle confessed to me six hours ago. Oh, and make a list of Peter Brand’s personal effects, will you? He won’t be in his rooms. Died in mysterious circumstances last night. Lord, yes, I’ve been busy since I last saw you. I’m off to get some sleep now. Report to me at two o’clock, will you? Sharp, mind.’"|"A Case of Spirits"|"Peter Lovesey"

"ap 10:40"|"twenty minutes to eleven"|"‘That is so,’ conceded Jowett, discountenanced again. ‘What I can’t explain is why he was not killed at the instant the power was restored,’ Cribb went on. ‘If I have it correct, the experiment was set up again at twenty minutes to eleven, the current was switched on and the galvanometer reading was not exceptional. It was a full minute before the needle jumped and we pulled aside the curtain to find Brand’s body.’"|"A Case of Spirits"|"Peter Lovesey"
"ap 08:01"|"eight one"|"‘By taking the second number first. It’s the one with the square beside it, and that’s helpful. I had to say it to myself a dozen times before I got it. 9281 square. You say the digits one by one, as an illiterate would. 9 and 2 are numbers, but 8 and 1 are words, eight one, the nearest he could get in numbers to Eaton. It’s an illiterate’s way of writing 92, Eaton Square. And that, if you remember, sir, is Miss Crush’s address in Belgravia.’"|"A Case of Spirits"|"Peter Lovesey"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"The London Directory gave the address of the Life After Death Society as Albemarle Street, as respectable a location as you could hope to find. The chambers were on the second floor, appropriately enough above the Veterans’ Club. Cribb’s knock was answered by a timid-looking young woman who explained that she was only the typewriter and Mr Strathmore was at lunch. She would be obliged if Cribb would come back at two o’clock. He consulted his watch. It was a quarter to two. He handed her his bowler and said he would wait."|"A Case of Spirits"|"Peter Lovesey"

"ap 10:40"|"twenty minutes to eleven"|"‘I did. It was twenty minutes to eleven and we had a reading of 202. The next thing I recall is the door-handle turning and you arriving in the room. It gave us quite a shock, Sergeant, I can tell you.’"|"A Case of Spirits"|"Peter Lovesey"
22:20|"10.20 p.m."|"‘198, and the time is 10.20 p.m.,’ responded Jowett, from beside the galvanometer. He turned to face Miss Crush. ‘Don’t you have something to tell us, madam?’"|"A Case of Spirits"|"Peter Lovesey"

"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"Quite without warning the medium discharged himself from his trance and sat upright, a broad grin across his face. ‘Yes, Thackeray, the Other Side. Of the river, of course.

"ap 09:30"|"half past nine"|"By half past nine they were being escorted up the main staircase of Burlington House by the keeper. The galleries were not opened to the public before eleven, but he recognised and admitted the ‘detective gentlemen’ at once, for all Cribb’s care over the first principle of plain clothes work."|"A Case of Spirits"|"Peter Lovesey"
