"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"By early morning light everything had a red glow. Paradise hung low in the sky, as though it meant to touch the tips of Hell’s mountains before noon."|"Gilgamesh the King"|"Robert Silverberg"
12:00|midday|"When I returned from midday recess I found that someone had gone down to the river and captured a yellow toad, and had skewered it into the middle of my seat. It was not yet dead. To one side of it someone had drawn the face of the evil spirit Rabisu, the croucher-in-doorways, and on the other side was drawn the storm-bird Imdugud with her tongue thrust out."|"Gilgamesh the King"|"Robert Silverberg"
12:00|midday|"I pulled the toad free and turned to Bir-hurturre with it. “You seem to have left your midday meal on my seat,” I said. “Here. This is for you to eat, not for me.”"|"Gilgamesh the King"|"Robert Silverberg"
12:00|midday|"The school-father and his assistant were returning just then from their midday meal. In the blindness of my wrath I ran right into them, and they caught me and held me until I was calm. I pointed into the classroom, where Bir-hurturre and Zabardi-bunugga were staring at me and making faces with their tongues, and demanded that they be put to death at once. But the school-father replied only that I had risen from my place without permission, I had spoken to him without permission; and he gave me over to the whipping-slave to cane me for my unruliness. It was not the last time those two tormented me, and occasionally some of the others joined in, the bigger ones, at least. I found I could do nothing against any of this persecution. School-father and his assistant always took their side, and told me I must hold my tongue, I must master my temper. I wrote down the names of my enemies, both my schoolfellows and my tutors, so that I could have them all flayed alive when I was king. But when I came to understand things a little better, soon afterward, I threw those lists away."|"Gilgamesh the King"|"Robert Silverberg"
12:00|midday|"So when the midday heat had eased a little, we put on kilts of fine white linen, and he drew a narrow red stripe across my shoulders and sliced a lock of my hair, and we went together to the temple of Inanna. We passed through the rear courtyard and crossed a maze of lesser rooms—workshops and toolbins and the library where the holy tablets were stacked—and at last we came to the cloister where the temple priestesses wait to serve worshippers. “Now you will give yourself to the goddess,” my uncle told me."|"Gilgamesh the King"|"Robert Silverberg"

  THAT NIGHT"|"9
      
    
  

  THAT NIGHT I dined on golden plates in the palace of Agga the king, and so began my four-year sojourn in Kish."|"Gilgamesh the King"|"Robert Silverberg"

  THAT NIGHT"|"12
      
    
  

  THAT NIGHT I slept in the palace of the king, in the great bed of ebony and gold that had been my father’s, and Enmerkar’s before him. The family of Dumuzi had already departed from the place, all his wives, his plump doughy daughters; the gods had not granted him sons. Before I went to my bed I confirmed in their position all the officers of the kingdom, according to the tradition, though I knew I would remove most of them from office in the months to come. And I feasted most royally with them, until spilled beer ran in foaming torrents along the channels of the feasting-hall floor."|"Gilgamesh the King"|"Robert Silverberg"
00:00|midnight|"Her eyes were shining strangely, like silvery suns rising at midnight. “Marry me, Gilgamesh. Be my husband.”"|"Gilgamesh the King"|"Robert Silverberg"
12:00|midday|"“A fine idea!” I answered. I laughed to see him turn less doleful. For an hour we wrestled, and then we bathed; and then it was time for me to attend to the meeting of the assembly. By midday I had put Enkidu’s dream behind me, and I think so had he. For a moment it had darkened our lives; but it had passed like a shadow across the ground. Or so I believed."|"Gilgamesh the King"|"Robert Silverberg"
00:00|midnight|"I told no one where I was going. I did not know that myself. I did not even say that I was leaving at all. I appointed no regent; I left no instructions for what was to be done in my absence. It was a madness that was upon me. Between midnight and dawn I slipped away, taking no more with me than the little I had carried that time I had fled to Kish when I was a boy."|"Gilgamesh the King"|"Robert Silverberg"
12:00|midday|"They led me to a house of fair size close by the main temple, where I was given a white robe like theirs, and a meal of lentils and figs. I scarcely touched it; I had not eaten in so long, I suppose, that my stomach had forgotten the meaning of hunger. While I was there others of that priesthood came and went in the house to take their midday meals, and they glanced at me only casually, without speaking. Many of them seemed very old, though all were sinewy, sturdy, full of vitality. After they ate they prayed at a low altar that bore no image, and went out to work in the fields. Which is what I did also when Lu-Ninmarka and Dabbatum were done with their meal; they beckoned to me and led me outside, and put me to toil."|"Gilgamesh the King"|"Robert Silverberg"
