Bill Abbott had walked over a while ago to sit and chat with him for a few minutes on the dais, invoking murmurs from floor and galleries and a desperate craning from the press seats above their heads as members of the media tried to guess what they were saying. But they kept their voices low and against the drone of speeches nothing could be heard. It was obvious from their expressions, however, that they were not happy. The headlines were quite accurate: the resolution was on its way to passage, either late tonight or, at the latest, at the special early session already set for 9 a.m. tomorrow."|"The Promise of Joy"|"Allen Drury"

Editorials, columns, broadcasts—letters, telegrams, telephone calls—riots by NAWAC and spontaneous protests by less-organized groups—sentiment respectable and sentiment suspect—all seemed to be running two to one for intervention following his veto."|"The Promise of Joy"|"Allen Drury"

"ap < 03:00"|"one hour to four"|"Often, moreover, they are not even shot in the sequence of early, midway, and late. Some of the late ones are shot first, some of the first are shot toward the end. In this process both actors and director must maintain the correct pace and the correct pitch, so that emotions in the scene that will come early in the finished picture will rise gradually into the emotions in a scene that will come later. All of this requires a constant control by the director, a carefully phased expenditure of effort and emphasis by the actors. It is one of the things that makes of each scene a fascinating study in technique, so that in two months there is never a day but has its own special challenge, its own excitement that carries the company forward through many long and grueling hours of dramatic episodes—and what is perhaps even more wearing, the “hurry up and wait” aspects of it, as the technicians take anywhere from one hour to four to get a scene properly arranged and lighted."|"The Promise of Joy"|"Allen Drury"

For some of them, this finally proves too much. Mrs. Gwendolyn Caffritz, for instance, who fancies herself as being a trifle more important to Washington society than she perhaps is as the years go by, presently decides she isn’t getting enough attention, and departs. Some others do the same. Most, however, are good sports and stay around watching the shooting and learning about movies until champagne is finally served in the small house and they are free to leave the graceful mansion and go home."|"The Promise of Joy"|"Allen Drury"

There just isn’t time or energy, while one is going on. Here, as in Washington, the day’s activities begin on Sound Stage 14 at 8 a.m. or very shortly thereafter, and frequently last past 6 p.m.; it is a stout soul who could party every night and still arrive bright-eyed and bushy-tailed to face the jaundiced gaze of the camera every morning.
