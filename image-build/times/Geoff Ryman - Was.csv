18:59|1859|"After the Kansas were placed on the greatly reduced reservation near Council Grove, a substantial decline occurred. For example, in 1855—the year their agent described them as “A poor, degraded, superstitious, thievish, indigent” type of people—the Commissioner of Indian Affairs reported their number at 1,375. By 1859 it was down to 1,035 and in 1868 to 825. Finally, while this “improvident class of people” made plans for permanent removal to Indian Territory, an official Indian Bureau count placed their number at “about 600.” Clearly the long-range trend appeared to be one of eventual obliteration."|Was|"Geoff Ryman"

"~ 16:30"|"about four-thirty in the afternoon"|"The earth was soft, muddy, thawed. It was about four-thirty in the afternoon in late March, what had been a nice day, a sunset blur of orange and blue across a flat and featureless sky. Toto the dog sat waiting."|Was|"Geoff Ryman"
"ap 05:30"|five-thirty|"It was five-thirty when Millie got to work. Five-thirty in the morning, that is. Took the bus. Knew most everybody on it. They all worked for the studio too. She said Hello to them; they murmured back. She got a couple of minutes’ shut-eye, forehead on hand. She could feel the cough and throb of the bus through her elbow as it rested on the edge of the window."|Was|"Geoff Ryman"

05:30|"five-thirty in the morning"|"Millie had been over to their place. Lived in Santa Monica, right near her. Nice, ordinary people. Most of the people working at Culver were nice, except for the bigwigs and some of the actors. Even most of them were okay. So how many folks are wonderful at five-thirty in the morning?"|Was|"Geoff Ryman"
"ap 06:00"|"Six o’clock"|"Millie went down along the stage, into the next room. Six o’clock, there was Ray Bolger, getting a shave."|Was|"Geoff Ryman"
"ap 06:30"|six-thirty|"“Not till six-thirty,” said Millie. “I’m going to the canteen, get some breakfast. You boys want anything?”"|Was|"Geoff Ryman"
"ap 06:45"|"Six forty-five"|"Millie looked at her watch. Six forty-five. It’s cutting it fine, Kid, starting this late anyway. Too late, you hold people up."|Was|"Geoff Ryman"
"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"She put a fresh stick of gum in her mouth. Kinda kept the breath minty when you had to talk into people’s faces doing makeup. She said hi to the Monkeys as they filed out of the stage. Bill, Mark, Tomlin, she passed them all, said something to each of them. One big family. Those guys must have been working from well past midnight on top of everything else. Well, the other studios are good; we’re just better, the best. Makes people feel worth something, like they’re doing something in life."|Was|"Geoff Ryman"
"ap 06:45"|"six forty-five"|"The parking lot looked empty. Ethel swung her car around, looking at the space she was aiming at, and nearly hit an old Ford. She slammed on the brakes, reversed, wrenching the steering wheel around, slammed into forward, straightening the car, and roared back neatly into the space. Her heart was thumping. Late. Late again, darn it, she was never late, and suddenly twice in one week. Why am I always late for everything, she admonished herself. Then she looked at her watch.
It said six forty-five.
It was like a blow to the chest. What? She was an hour early. Of all the stupid…She’d misread the time. All that panic, missing her breakfast, dashing out to the car, makeup to be done later. Screaming up Sepulveda, only half noticing how empty the streets were, praising the Lord that the traffic was light for once, tearing into the lot and then thump, here she was, thump, parked in the McDonnell Douglas parking lot an hour early with nothing to do on the coldest day of the year. She looked over her shoulder. Even the chow shop on the corner hadn’t opened yet."|Was|"Geoff Ryman"

22:51|"9 to 11 p.m."|"The film was shown for the first time on 3 November 1956 from 9 to 11 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. With a 33.9 rating and a 52.7 per cent share of the audience, The Wizard of Oz did extremely well—but not as well as it did 1959, 1964, and 1965. As of July 1975, The Wizard of Oz was in 11th place on the list of the highest-rated movies ever shown on network television. (It was also in 12th place, 14th place, 16th place, 21st place, 23rd place and 25th place.)"|Was|"Geoff Ryman"
21:00|"9:00 p.m."|"In November 1956, Jonathan saw the first broadcast of the film version of The Wizard of Oz. The movie started at 9:00 p.m. and would go on until eleven. Jonathan had never before been allowed to stay up so late. He wore his red-striped pajamas and his red bathrobe. He was covered by his Indian blanket and he leaned against his mother on the gray and itchy sofa. His father passed him a cup of hot chocolate in the brown highwayman mug. Jonathan felt very adult."|Was|"Geoff Ryman"
12:00|noon|"There was no softening haze over the fields. It was a strange day, fiercely bright, but cool, very cool in a Kansas August. When a day was as fierce as that, it always meant it would be cloudy by noon. Dorothy was glad it was cool; she could walk farther. The corn would be tall; it would hide her as she walked. She could not be seen on the roads. The sunlight on the corn leaves engraved them with lines. The soil underneath was baked as firm as any roadway, in hard clumps that tickled Dorothy’s hardened feet."|Was|"Geoff Ryman"
"ap ~ 11:00"|"About eleven o’clock"|"About eleven o’clock, they moved off toward the women’s ward. From somewhere down the corridor came dim, echoing voices, murmuring or raised and querulous. They sounded like a choir that had not yet begun to sing."|Was|"Geoff Ryman"
22:51|"nine to eleven at night"|"So it was decided to wheel out the television from nine to eleven at night. The Angels, like children all over the country, were going to be allowed to stay up late to watch it. Bill, the gentle master of the TV, took the night shift for the first time."|Was|"Geoff Ryman"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"It had been happening a lot lately. Forgetting things. Jonathan climbed back down the steps. Well. It was three o’clock. He would just have to wait until Ira got home. He slumped down into his chair, in the garden by the pond."|Was|"Geoff Ryman"
05:00|"5:00 a.m."|"Jonathan needed the money. It was with a sense of dread that he showed up at 5:00 a.m. in the scanty little trailer on location in Santa Monica. He assumed he would dry again. He often did, without warning. Despite his reputation for brilliance, Jonathan would sometimes unaccountably be unable to act. It was unaccountable even to himself."|Was|"Geoff Ryman"
"ap 04:00"|four|"Bill talked about the history of Kansas. The Old West, he said, had stringent gun-control laws. You checked your firearms before you came into town. Wichita, Kansas, was the town of Wyatt Earp, of Bat Masterson, the town of all those TV shows along with Dodge City, also in Kansas. For the whole decade of the 1870s, when Wichita was one of the wildest cowtowns, the total number of people murdered in it was four. Four people killed in ten years. In Los Angeles, it was four a day."|Was|"Geoff Ryman"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"Ira still did not answer. When he was done, he seemed to sag in place. He pulled off the gloves and let them soak in bleach, and he washed his hands, and he turned around, and his face was white like a fish’s belly and stubbled with blue-black beard. He looked fat and haggard at the same time. He had been working until nine o’clock. He had been working a lot lately."|Was|"Geoff Ryman"

“Three-fifteen.”
“What’s your name?”"|Was|"Geoff Ryman"
19:03|1903|"“And up there,” said Sally, pointing. Along the top of the shelves ran a line of blue-bound papers. “We have everybody’s school reports. I even found some of mine up there. And my mother’s. But we do not have much before 1903. You see, before the levee was built, we used to have real bad floods, and almost everything was lost in the 1903 flood.” She shrugged and held up her hands. “We might have some older records down in the basement.”"|Was|"Geoff Ryman"

16:00|"four this afternoon"|"Jonathan snored. His whole face was going an unnatural brown, as if he had spent his life under a sunlamp. Beads of sweat were trickling down him, as if he were melting. Bill felt guilty. I should have taken you to the hospital, he thought. I know better. He promised his profession: Jonathan, I get you back into care by four this afternoon."|Was|"Geoff Ryman"

Bill looked at his watch: quarter past one.
Jonathan leaned over and lost all the water he had just drunk. Bill stroked his back."|Was|"Geoff Ryman"
"ap 01:30"|One-thirty|"Ahuh ahuh ahuh.
Bill eased the car to a stop. One-thirty.
“The hill,” whispered Jonathan, and pointed to the left. His skeleton hands fluttered against the window."|Was|"Geoff Ryman"
"ap 01:45"|"Quarter to two"|"They came to the lane. ROCK SPRING, said the sign. The clump of trees was at the crossroads. Bill turned right and parked the car. The lane was unpaved, white gravel, and it led in a straight line to the ziggurat hill. A row of old-fashioned telephone poles ranged along it on the left, like a line of crucifixes. Two huge farm machines stood some way away amidst the sorghum. On the other side of the lane, the field was harvested, bare earth, thrashed stalks. Everything was seen. Everything was visible.
Quarter to two. We’ve done it. Thank you, Jesus.
Bill patted Jonathan’s knee. “Come on, kiddo,” Bill said. “Let’s go see it.”"|Was|"Geoff Ryman"
