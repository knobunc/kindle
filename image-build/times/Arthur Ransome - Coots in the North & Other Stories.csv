12:00|midday|"Nowadays folk talk of cloudburst if the river lifts a couple of feet in an hour or so. Any bit of a spate that brings driftwood with it, and puts a meadow under water is a cloudburst for them, no matter if the rain’s been coming down for a week. But a real cloudburst’s more than that. It’s sudden, like the darkness when you blow out a candle. It’s more yet, like full sunshine at midday turning to a night with no moon at ten minutes past twelve. When I think of cloudbursts, I do not think of the big spates that come in the back end or in February. I bring to mind a summer day of seventy years ago, when my Jenny was maybe eight years old and I was a lad of twelve and as near as nothing saw her drowned."|"Coots in the North & Other Stories"|"Arthur Ransome"

14:00|"two o’clock in the afternoon"|"We had our bites and sat on there, saying little. It was too hot for talking. We bathed our feet in the water, but we got green moss on them, slimy, and even the water felt dead. It was maybe two o’clock in the afternoon when I knew the old Canon was right. I looked up river and saw the whole sky black behind the hills."|"Coots in the North & Other Stories"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap ~ 11:00"|"about eleven o’clock"|"“And then one morning about eleven o’clock, a hot morning in July it was, when all but the old women and the very old men were harvesting, somebody happened to look across the meadows to the village, and saw faint threads of smoke streaming up from the corners of the Starosta’s cottage, which was the biggest cottage in the village, and stood at the far end. The man threw down his sickle and set off running, shouting at the top of his voice. There was no more harvesting done that day."|"Coots in the North & Other Stories"|"Arthur Ransome"
12:00|noon|"It was noon. He had but twelve hours in which to die, unless Yvon, whose body lay in the cottage up the road, were to take the place they both had coveted. An old clock remarked the flying seconds with metallic, inevitable voice. The clock tick-tacked remorselessly towards midnight and the new year. And Luch lay on his bed, full of a feeble resentment against Jozon for being so long in taking him."|"Coots in the North & Other Stories"|"Arthur Ransome"

00:00|midnight|"For one moment he thought he was dead, so great was his relief. Then the tick-tacking of the clock gathered itself with a whirr of wheels, and he heard midnight strike. It was the New Year. He heard many steps running in the snow. The door was thrown open, and a cold wind rushed into the little room."|"Coots in the North & Other Stories"|"Arthur Ransome"
12:00|noon|"“We have,” says I, “and we work him harder than any trade union would allow anyone to work a proletariat,” says I, and I tell him about the Prince o’ Wales and King George working morning, noon and night, and Queen Mary too. I tell him a few more things that come into my head and says “Three cheers for the glorious Revolution!” and with that he remembers business and asks if I have seen a bourgeois with a yellow beard who’s going to prison for thieving, speculation and counter-revolutionary activities generally."|"Coots in the North & Other Stories"|"Arthur Ransome"
"~ 00:00"|"About midnight"|"We was coming in between the headlands just after dark when I heard a motor boat coming out in a hurry and, thinking it was coastguards coming to meet us, was preparing to repel boarders with slabs of untruthfulness, when it swung round to the east and went off all out in the way we had come. I thought it would look suspicious if we altered course or showed hurry, so I kept her going as she was and lifted up my voice and sang, putting up the alibi of a good conscience in case folk might be listening. About midnight it would be when after feeling my way in with the lead, as it was too dark to see where we were, I dropped anchor in something under six fathom."|"Coots in the North & Other Stories"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap > 05:00"|"after five o’clock"|"Mr. Jonnatt walked all round her and went off with a happy smiling face to his office at the side of the shed. The crowd drifted away. It was after five o’clock, and work was over for the day, except for the lorryman, who was to drive the lorry, and Pete’s father, who was to go with him to hand the boat over to her new owner. The lorryman drove the lorry just clear of the shed so that the big doors could be shut and went off with Pete’s father and the rest of the men."|"Coots in the North & Other Stories"|"Arthur Ransome"
