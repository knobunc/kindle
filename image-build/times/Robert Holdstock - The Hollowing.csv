16:00|"four in the afternoon"|"Richard Bradley hastened along the road to his house, at the edge of Shadoxhurst, hatless and drenched by the torrential and freezing late September downpour. The whole town had become dark. The few shops had their lights on, and at four in the afternoon this made a depressingly wintry scene. Richard was wearing only his suit, the collar of his jacket drawn tightly around his neck in a vain attempt to stop the rain coursing down his back. Bedraggled and fed up, he broke into a run as he neared his cottage, then slowed abruptly as he saw the woman dart away from the back gate towards the fields."|"The Hollowing"|"Robert Holdstock"
"ap 06:00"|six|"“Well, that sounds healthy enough.” Alex didn’t respond. “We’ll be leaving at six, if they want you there at six-thirty, so don’t lounge around reading for long.”"|"The Hollowing"|"Robert Holdstock"
"ap 06:30"|six-thirty|"“Well, that sounds healthy enough.” Alex didn’t respond. “We’ll be leaving at six, if they want you there at six-thirty, so don’t lounge around reading for long.”"|"The Hollowing"|"Robert Holdstock"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"Throughout all of this, from two in the morning to the new day, Keeton held firmly onto the crude mask, his grip tightening like a child’s when Richard tentatively tried to take it."|"The Hollowing"|"Robert Holdstock"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"“Come and see! Bring a stick. They’re all dancing with sticks around the fire.”
“Have you been out?” he whispered again. “At three in the morning?”
From the far distance the sound of drums swelled on the night breeze. It was an odd rhythm, faintly audible, a fluctuating murmur in the cold night."|"The Hollowing"|"Robert Holdstock"
06:00|"six in the morning"|"The phone woke him at six in the morning. He stumbled out onto the landing and snatched the receiver from its cradle, groggily acknowledging the caller. It was Margaret Keeton. Her husband was awake and raving. He kept asking for Alex. The specialist in charge of his case felt that this might be a last moment of lucidity before a total collapse; so could the family and friends come at once?"|"The Hollowing"|"Robert Holdstock"
"ap 03:15"|three-fifteen|"He was startled by the sounding of the church bell. It was three-fifteen. The bell rang a second time, then was silent. A moment later, the side door of the church opened, closed, and was noisily locked."|"The Hollowing"|"Robert Holdstock"
"ap 06:30"|six-thirty|"When the Red Lion opened, at six-thirty, Richard went into the lounge bar and ordered a pint. He was served by someone he didn’t know, but Ben Morris came down later and greeted him."|"The Hollowing"|"Robert Holdstock"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"At nine o’clock he rang Alice in London. She had just arrived at work and was tetchy and tired. She became almost hysterical when he told her, as simply as he could, what Helen Silverlock had implied to him, but when she heard that the boy was thirteen years old she laughed scornfully, then began to get angry. She wanted to know why he had really called her."|"The Hollowing"|"Robert Holdstock"
12:00|midday|"By midday the grey gloom had been replaced by a bright and overcast sky, a fresh wind bringing the land alive. Richard trudged in heavy boots along the bridleway towards Hunter’s Brook. He had not brought a rucksack. He intended only to look a little more closely at the wood where Helen had said she and her team were stationed."|"The Hollowing"|"Robert Holdstock"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"He took the letter to the Red Lion to be posted, had a glass of light ale, then returned home and slept well for a few hours, the result of the nocturnal distraction and alertness that had kept him awake the previous night. Nevertheless, he was up at three in the morning. He dressed quickly, then packed his rucksack with brandy, apples, sandwiches, a compass, an adventure novel, and changes of clothing; an hour later he was walking through the same heavy mist that had encompassed the land the morning before. Now, though, he walked with purpose, and at first light, when he arrived at Hunter’s Brook and found the signpost, he spread a tarpaulin on the ground, sat down, then curled up to keep himself warm."|"The Hollowing"|"Robert Holdstock"
07:00|"seven in the morning"|"Glancing at his watch, Richard realised that he had fallen asleep for three hours. It was seven in the morning."|"The Hollowing"|"Robert Holdstock"
04:00|"four in the morning"|"Richard woke with shock, yelling out into the pale dawn light. The room was cold and damp, dew-encrusted. The window was wide open and he could see rolling clouds, threatening rain. It was four in the morning. The crows were flapping and cawing in their roosts and Richard’s head was pounding as the image of Alex, reaching out to shake him awake, began to fade."|"The Hollowing"|"Robert Holdstock"
00:00|midnight|"At midnight he abandoned the vigil and went to bed. He lay awake for ages, staring at the moon, thinking of Helen and his son and the broad, good-humoured Frenchman."|"The Hollowing"|"Robert Holdstock"
