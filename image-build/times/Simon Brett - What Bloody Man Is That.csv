00:00|midnight|"George Birkitt, by contrast, gave an appalling reading. He appeared never to have seen or heard any of the lines before in his life and, from some of the readings he gave, certainly not to understand them. Even famous quotations were delivered with leaden incomprehension. George Birkitt’s approach to intonation seemed to be based on the simple rule that all personal pronouns should be emphasised. ‘I have done the deed.’ ‘How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags! What ist you do?’ Even ‘She should have died hereafter.’"|"What Bloody Man Is That"|"Simon Brett"
"ap 01:00"|one|"‘God, he’s hopeless. The money I pay him and … No, I’ve got to fly to Paris for filming on Sunday. Flight late Saturday afternoon. Car picking me up here at one.’"|"What Bloody Man Is That"|"Simon Brett"
"ap 05:30"|"Half-past five"|"Sandra looked at her watch. ‘I won’t be long. How late do you go on?’
‘Half-past five … six.’
‘Stewart was called for two.’"|"What Bloody Man Is That"|"Simon Brett"
10:00|"ten in the morning"|"‘I know he’s hoping to.’ But Charles’s optimistic prediction proved incorrect. They worked on the blocking of the Apparition Scene (which now involved much use of the stage trap-door) for the rest of the afternoon. When they broke, the director shouted out, ‘Okay. Thanks for all your hard work. Macduff murder scene prompt at ten in the morning - okay?’"|"What Bloody Man Is That"|"Simon Brett"
"ap > 08:00"|"just after eight"|"THEY DID MANAGE to get the whole play blocked by the end of rehearsal on the Friday, but only by dint of going into overtime. Most of them worked through till just after eight, because virtually the entire cast was involved in the battle scenes at the end. (Charles, incidentally, had picked up a couple more parts here - one of the soldiers in Malcolm’s army who grabs a bit of Birnham Wood, and then, with a change of allegiance which might have confused an actor of more Stanislavskian approach, one of Macbeth’s army who runs away as the tide of battle turns.)"|"What Bloody Man Is That"|"Simon Brett"
"ap 09:30"|nine-thirty|"Felicia Chatterton, who had given up remonstrating about the folly of running the play so soon, approached the exercise with her customary seriousness, and was to be found at nine-thirty on the Saturday morning in the middle of the stage, working through a series of yoga postures and breathing exercises. She felt that proper preparation was always essential in acting, even just for a first run."|"What Bloody Man Is That"|"Simon Brett"
"ap 10:15"|ten-fifteen|"What did throw his schedule into disarray, though, was the phone message that came through at ten-fifteen. George Birkitt was fog-bound in Paris. There had been no flights out of the city the previous night and, unless the weather showed a very sudden improvement, there was no chance of his putting in an appearance at that day’s rehearsals."|"What Bloody Man Is That"|"Simon Brett"
"ap 02:50"|"Ten to three"|"He swayed erratically until he had overcome the apparently insuperable problem of doing up his zip. Then he looked at his watch.
Ten to three. Ugh. He must get back to his digs.
There was no light in the passage outside. Oh no, the Stage Doorman must have thought the theatre was empty, and locked up. God, he might be stuck in there till the morning. That’d give the rest of the company a good laugh, he thought ruefully."|"What Bloody Man Is That"|"Simon Brett"
"ap 10:00"|"Ten o’clock"|"‘We must. Ten o’clock call, as ever. Somehow I’ve got to get this show on.’"|"What Bloody Man Is That"|"Simon Brett"
"ap ~ 11:30"|"about half past eleven"|"The three actresses, it transpired, were sharing a rented house some four miles from the theatre. Gavin had deposited them there together at about half past eleven. So, unless he wanted to get into elaborate conspiracy theories or imagine them walking back and breaking into the theatre, Charles could rule Lady Macduff and the two Witches out of his investigations."|"What Bloody Man Is That"|"Simon Brett"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"‘Thing is,’ she went on coarsely, ‘when Norman wants a bit, he really wants a bit. Amazing I ever get any sleep. At it till three o’clock last night he was.’ There was a note of reluctant pride in her voice."|"What Bloody Man Is That"|"Simon Brett"
"ap 11:30"|"half-past eleven"|"But at least, he reflected, that rules out both of the Phippses. If they left the bar together at half-past eleven, and were then erotically engaged till three in the morning, there was no way that either of them could have arranged the death of Warnock Belvedere."|"What Bloody Man Is That"|"Simon Brett"

"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"By six o’clock Charles Paris felt physically very tired. For a man in his fifties, whose only gesture towards keeping fit was occasionally watching athletics on television, all that rushing up and down stairs, round the back of the stage and through the auditorium had taken its toll."|"What Bloody Man Is That"|"Simon Brett"
20:00|"eight in the evening"|"HIS IMPERSONATION of Felicia Chatterton was now becoming one of John B. Murgatroyd’s party pieces. ‘But it’s just so difficult,’ he complained huskily in the dressing room on the Wednesday afternoon, ‘to try and give a full performance at this time of day. I mean, one’s body-clock is tuned to peak round eight in the evening, not straight after lunch.’"|"What Bloody Man Is That"|"Simon Brett"
