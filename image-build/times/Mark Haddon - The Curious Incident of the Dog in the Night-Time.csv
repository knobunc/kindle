It was 7 minutes after midnight. The dog was lying on the grass in the middle of the lawn in front of Mrs. Shears's house. Its eyes were closed. It looked as if it was running on its side, the way dogs run when they think they are chasing a cat in a dream. But the dog was not running or asleep. The dog was dead. There was a garden fork sticking out of the dog. The points of the fork must have gone all the way through the dog and into the ground because the fork had not fallen over. I decided that the dog was probably killed with the fork because I could not see any other wounds in the dog and I do not think you would stick a garden fork into a dog after it had died for some other reason, like cancer, for example, or a road accident. But I could not be certain about this."|"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time"|"Mark Haddon"

02:07|"2:07 a.m."|"At 2:07 a.m. I decided that I wanted a drink of orange squash before I brushed my teeth and got into bed, so I went downstairs to the kitchen. Father was sitting on the sofa watching snooker on the television and drinking scotch. There were tears coming out of his eyes."|"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time"|"Mark Haddon"
17:48|"5:48 p.m."|"Father came home at 5:48 p.m. I heard him come through the front door. Then he came into the living room. He was wearing a lime green and sky blue check shirt and there was a double knot on one of his shoes but not on the other. He was carrying an old advert for Fussell's Milk Powder which was made of metal and painted with blue and white enamel and covered with little circles of rust which were like bullet holes, but he didn't explain why he was carrying this."|"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time"|"Mark Haddon"
17:54|"5:54 p.m."|"It was 5:54 p.m. when Father came back into the living room. He said, “What is this?” but he said it very quietly and I didn't realize that he was angry because he wasn't shouting."|"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time"|"Mark Haddon"

15:30|"half past three in the afternoon"|"I have to go now. It's half past three in the afternoon. I know you always like to know exactly what time it is.

"ap 02:25"|225|"I doubled 2's in my head because it made me feel calmer. I got to 33554432, which is 225, which was not very much because I've got to 245 before, but my brain wasn't working very well."|"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time"|"Mark Haddon"
23:16|"11:16 p.m."|"But I couldn't get out of the house straightaway because he would see me, so I would have to wait until he was asleep.
The time was 11:16 p.m.
I tried doubling 2's again, but I couldn't get past 215, which was 32768. So I groaned to make the time pass quicker and not think."|"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time"|"Mark Haddon"
01:20|"1:20 a.m."|"Then it was 1:20 a.m. but I hadn't heard Father come upstairs to bed. I wondered if he was asleep downstairs or whether he was waiting to come in and kill me. So I got out my Swiss Army knife and opened the saw blade so that I could defend myself. Then I went out of my bedroom really quietly and listened. I couldn't hear anything, so I started going downstairs really quietly and really slowly. And when I got downstairs I could see Father's foot through the door of the living room. I waited for 4 minutes to see if it moved, but it didn't move. So I carried on walking till I got to the hallway. Then I looked round the door of the living room."|"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time"|"Mark Haddon"

I stayed awake until 3:47. That was the last time I looked at my watch before I fell asleep. It has a luminous face and lights up if you press a button, so I could read it in the dark. I was cold and I was frightened Father might come out and find me. But I felt safer in the garden because I was hidden."|"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time"|"Mark Haddon"
"ap 02:32"|"2 hours and 32 minutes"|"I didn't sleep very well because of the cold and because the ground was very bumpy and pointy underneath me and because Toby was scratching in his cage a lot. But when I woke up properly it was dawn and the sky was all orange and blue and purple and I could hear birds singing, which is called the Dawn Chorus. And I stayed where I was for another 2 hours and 32 minutes, and then I heard Father come into the garden and call out, “Christopher . . . ? Christopher . . . ?”"|"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time"|"Mark Haddon"
"ap 02:08"|0208|"And he said, “And can you tell me what it is?”

20:07|"8:07 p.m."|"And then the silences between the trains coming and going got longer and longer. And I could hear that there were fewer people in the little station when the train wasn't there, so I opened my eyes and I looked at my watch and it said 8:07 p.m. and I had been sitting on the bench for approximately 5 hours but it hadn't seemed like approximately 5 hours, except that my bottom hurt and I was hungry and thirsty."|"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time"|"Mark Haddon"

22:31|"10:31 p.m."|"And later on, at 10:31 p.m. I went out onto the balcony to find out whether I could see any stars, but there weren't any because of all the clouds and what is called light pollution, which is light from streetlights and car headlights and floodlights and lights in buildings reflecting off tiny particles in the atmosphere and getting in the way of light from the stars. So I went back inside."|"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time"|"Mark Haddon"
02:07|"2:07 a.m."|"But I couldn't sleep. And I got out of bed at 2:07 a.m. and I felt scared of Mr. Shears so I went downstairs and out of the front door into Chapter Road. And there was no one in the street and it was quieter than it was during the day, even though you could hear traffic in the distance and sirens, so it made me feel calmer. And I walked down Chapter Road and looked at all the cars and the patterns the phone wires made against the orange clouds and the things that people had in their front gardens, like a gnome and a cooker and a tiny pond and a teddy bear."|"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time"|"Mark Haddon"
"ap 03:12"|"3 hours 12 minutes"|"And we drove all the way to Swindon and it took 3 hours 12 minutes and we had to stop for petrol and Mother bought me a Milkybar but I didn't eat it. And we got caught in a long traffic jam which was caused by people slowing down to look at an accident on the other carriageway. And I tried to work out a formula to determine whether a traffic jam would be caused just by people slowing down and how this was influenced by (a) the density of traffic, and (b) the speed of the traffic, and (c) how quickly drivers braked when they saw the brake of the lights of the car in front coming on. But I was too tired because I hadn't slept the night before because I was thinking about not being able to do my maths A level. So I fell asleep."|"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time"|"Mark Haddon"

I took Toby out of my pocket and I let him run around and I played Minesweeper and I did the Expert Version in 174 seconds, which was 75 seconds longer than my best time."|"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time"|"Mark Haddon"
18:35|"6:35 p.m."|"And then it was 6:35 p.m. and I heard Father come home in his van and I moved the bed up against the door so he couldn't get in and he came into the house and he and Mother shouted at each other."|"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time"|"Mark Haddon"
