"~ 14:30"|"around two-thirty in the afternoon"|"ferent species. Luckily, a few simple tricks can be applied, allowing a more robust guess to be made. Two of the most essential factors are calibration of the molecular clock using reliably dated fossils and the use of an average rate of genetic drift obtained by determining the changes in a large number of different genes in a wide variety of species. The evolutionary biologist Richard Fortey provides a nice analogy in his delightful book  Trilobite!  He compares molecular clocks with an old-fashioned horologist’s shop, in which hundreds of clocks beat to their own music of time. Some have stopped completely, others tell wildly different times, but the majority indicate that the time is around two-thirty in the afternoon. While the onlooker may doubt the exact time, he will probably be satisfied that it is mid-afternoon. Similarly, the results of molecular clock calculations sometimes vary by hundreds of millions of years, according to the genes and species studied, but all indicate a substantial fuse of animal evolution during the Precambrian. The overall weight of evidence implies that the fuse lasted at least 100 million years, and possibly as much as 500 or 600 million. If this is true, the earliest animals must have been too small to leave visible fossils, so the search is on for tiny impressions measuring less than a millimetre [1/16 in] across."|Oxygen|"Nick Lane"

If the samples were recharged with fresh nutrient following the initial burst of oxygen, however, no more oxygen was released, implying that the reactions had come to an end. Although these results did not strictly rule out life, the reactions were much better explained by chemistry than by biology. But if this was the case, the chemistry of the soil must have been potent, as even the simple expedient of adding water made it fizz. After some puzzlement, the Viking team eventually concluded that the soil samples must have contained superoxides and peroxides, generated by ultraviolet rays acting on the atmosphere or on the soil itself. This conjecture has been confirmed by other analyses of the chemical composition of the rocks."|Oxygen|"Nick Lane"
"ap 07:16"|716|"According to Robert Blankenship of Arizona State University and Hyman Hartman, of the Institute for Advanced Studies in Biology at Berkeley, California, tiny changes in the structure of bacterial chlorophylls can lead to large shifts in their absorption properties. Two small changes to the structure of bacteriochlorophyll  a (which absorbs at 870 nm) are all that it takes to generate chlorophyll  d, which absorbs at 716 nanometres. In 1996, an article in  Nature  by Hideaki Miyashita and colleagues of the Marine Biotechnology Institute in Kamaishi, Japan, reported that chlorophyll  d  is the main photosynthetic pigment in a bacterium called  Acaryochloris marina, which splits water to generate oxygen. Thus, an intermediate between bacteriochlorophyll and plant chlorophyll is not only plausible: it actually exists. From chlorophyll  d  another trifling change is all that is required to produce chlorophyll  a, the principal pigment in plants, algae and cyanobacteria, which absorbs light at 680 nanometres."|Oxygen|"Nick Lane"

In contrast, a squirrel lives for a maximum of seven years, and its basal metabolic rate is five times faster: about 1 litre of oxygen per kilogram per hour. In its lifetime, it too consumes around 60 000 litres of oxygen per kilogram. The correlation holds surprisingly well for most mammals. The ‘constant’ is known as the  lifetime energy potential."|Oxygen|"Nick Lane"
