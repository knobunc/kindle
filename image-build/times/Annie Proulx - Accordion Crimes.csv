"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"Just as Pinse’s left foot touched the garnet runner of the top stair, the ching of the breakfast room bell sounded. He had come in very late, hours past midnight, after a week away at the Robinsonville levee break. He had no doubt; it had been dynamited by the malcontents he had fired from the timber contract; foreigners, all of them, observed creeping and slinking for the better part of a week. And as soon as the levee breached they’d disappeared. The damage was local, hard on the Yazoo Valley, but in the long run the silt deposit would improve the bottomland. He knew one thing; he’d rather have niggers than dago socialist rabble screaming for weekly paydays and threatening strikes and blowing up levees in revenge when they did not get what they wanted. His eyes burned. The staircase wound as did a chambered nautilus, and he walked down quickly, one hand on the banister—taking pleasure in the mild centrifugal force of the descent, the flash of his passage in silvered mirrors—stepped into the foyer, glancing at the seascape, a study of icebergs in some northern sea, hanging against the brown paper, looked through the archway at the hall stand with its coats like headless bodies, taking satisfaction in the carved chair, the electroplated card receiver with the head of Hadrian staring at the beaded doorknob. He noted the sweep of herled feathers in a jardiniere—that was new—felt the usual irritation at his squabby reflection in the hall-stand mirror. He yawned."|"Accordion Crimes"|"Annie Proulx"

00:30|"half after midnight"|"An hour and a half after midnight, under a full, cold moon, the Vigorous struck an uncharted reef and broke apart. The bow sank quickly, but the stern floated on, filled with fire that set the sugar barrels ablaze. The moonlight shone on the rolling waves and the wet faces of the drowning passengers, who cried out in six languages. Loats kicked to shore in the company of a young Dutch woman, both clinging to the headboard of the captain’s pine bed. As the headboard dipped and plunged, Loats imagined a life-saving machine, a right-angled wooden frame with an inflated rubber cushion for buoyancy, a rear propeller driven by a hand crank, another under the feet driven by pedals; and there would be a mast with a little sail, a whistle hanging from a lanyard, a signal flag, and even a lantern. But how could one light the lantern? He puzzled at it until the waves swept them into the sandy surf. He helped the woman, reeling and choking, toward a green house with smoke streaming from the chimney. All along the wet sand lay the wooden shoes of drowned Dutchmen and from the woods a bear emerged, head up into the wind, lured by the smell of burning sugar."|"Accordion Crimes"|"Annie Proulx"
00:00|midnight|"“Jesus Christ! Now dance!” shouted Beutle, starting off with comic German songs—“Die Ankunft der Grünhörner,” “Auf der Alm da steht ’ne Kuh,” and the great favorite, “Herr Loats, was ist mit deiner Tuba los?”—until the Irish had enough of it and shouted for jigs and reels that the Germans could not play, and the Americans wanted “Old Uncle Ned” and “Arkansas Traveler.” The three Germans played until midnight, the tireless Beutle pumping out accordion polkas and the tuba honking and a fine spray of sweat, caught in the gaslight’s white rays, flying from couples spinning the tight corner turn. At midnight someone tolled a bell, an Irishman fired a shotgun into the sky and the three Germans performed their most astonishing feat."|"Accordion Crimes"|"Annie Proulx"
00:00|midnight|"In Chicago Beutle drank imported Bavarian beer and smoked a twisted Spanish cigar at a beer hall, ate plates of kraut and wurst, sang drinking songs until midnight, fornicated with prostitutes, and bought a new instrument with some of his hog money, and for his wife a perforated cardboard motto, God Bless Our Home, and a selection of colored threads for working it. Loats thought of yellow pencils and sheets of coarse paper for the children and chose a tape measure holder in the shape of a hen and a bottle of THANKS A MILLION tonic for his wife who was already somewhat broken in health. He ate a plate of Chicago sausages of a strange bronze color and a flavor like kerosene. Messermacher ordered a rocking chair and one of the new bedsprings for a total of six dollars, bought a box of oranges for his children and from time to time took the cover off to inhale the fragrance."|"Accordion Crimes"|"Annie Proulx"
12:00|noon|"In autumn, trying to get the corn shocked, the three worked together in each other’s fields, especially when their boys were too young to be useful. Once when they were working at Beutle’s place, Gerti drove up at noon with the dinner pails and jugs of vinegared water. The day was warm. Beutle was working close to the noon spot, waiting for Gerti, Loats thought, probably famished. Loats and Messermacher walked down the field, unstrapping the husking pins from their right hands (for Beutle husked his corn in the field), raising and lowering their heads to get the kinks out of their necks. They saw Beutle and Gerti crawl under the wagon."|"Accordion Crimes"|"Annie Proulx"
12:00|noon|"In May, Karl, Messermacher’s son who was the telegraph operator, fell panting into the kitchen at broad noon, his clothes torn and his face bloody, his celluloid collar hanging in a jagged arc, left arm hanging useless, wrenched so badly he was never able to raise it above his shoulder again."|"Accordion Crimes"|"Annie Proulx"
07:00|"seven in the morning"|"At night he entered his other world and, accordion against his breast and his powerful voice controlling the movements and thoughts of two hundred people, he was invincible; at the restaurant he was subservient, not only to the demands of the occupation but to some cringing inner self. His day began at seven in the morning with empty coffee cups and the crumbs of sweet cakes and ended at six after the first wave of dinner plates. He knew all the day waiters; there were seven. All but one of them respected his dual nature, perhaps cursing him in the passageway to the kitchen where he shoved the tubs of dirty dishes through a window to the sinks, mocking his slowness, clumsiness, stupidity; but in the evenings and on the weekends the same men screamed with joy as they stood in the cascade of his music, touched his sleeve and spoke his name as if he were a saint. They would kiss his feet if they knew what made his music so vigorous, if they knew the green accordion’s secret—or perhaps would shove him into the great hot oven in envy."|"Accordion Crimes"|"Annie Proulx"
12:00|noon|"As soon as Abelardo dug his accordion out from the boxes of cooking pots and sheets—it was not the Majestic that he played in those days, but the little green two-row—as soon as Adina found his good shoes and rubbed them to a gloss, as soon as he changed into his blue gabardine trousers and a white shirt, they left for the engagement, an anniversary barbecue to the north of Hornet. At noon the next day when Abelardo reentered the garage, hung over and filthy from sleeping under a bush, he discovered that his wife had moved into an old trailer on the edge of the barrio. The trip to San Antonio was canceled."|"Accordion Crimes"|"Annie Proulx"

They crossed the border and arrived at the station an hour before the scheduled time of noon. The boys sat silent, clutching their instruments while Abelardo buttonholed everyone—the man with a tray of coffee, a technician festooned with odd tools, an engineer on his way down the hall, a cowboy singer, half drunk and with his fly unzipped, coming from the men’s room."|"Accordion Crimes"|"Annie Proulx"

He had a trick of looking slyly around from under lowered eyelids, never staring boldly, never letting his eyes flash. His hair was sleek and receding from his caramel-colored forehead. He came from a northern city, one could hear it in his voice. He sat quietly, his hands loosely collapsed, filling the table, as he waited for the platter of meat to come. When he was finished with the meal he placed his knife and fork on the plate in the form of a cross, lit a cigarette, holding it between forefinger and thumb of his left hand, and leaned back in the creaking chair. If he caught Abelardo’s eye he would gesture with the second finger of his right hand as a sign he wished the dirty plates carried away. One evening he made this gesture and as Abelardo grasped the edge of the soiled platter the man spoke to him in a low voice, asked Abelardo to meet him across the street—he named a bar—at six-thirty. Below the cigarette smoke Abelardo could smell a pungent herb oil, a primitive and superstitious odor."|"Accordion Crimes"|"Annie Proulx"

He opened the instrument, his fingers probed the creases of the bellows. The money was undisturbed. The shreds of fear solidified to fury.

Chris was still out under the moon somewhere, driving his taxi, was often out all night taking drunken soldiers back to the base."|"Accordion Crimes"|"Annie Proulx"
12:00|noon|"All day he vomited, all day diarrhea poured from him in a green burning stream, a consuming fever came on mixed with the scent of insect spray, his teeth crashed together, he was freezing. He wanted badly to lie down on his bed and sleep but feared the spider. Anyway it was better to lie on the couch to be near the bathroom. Thank god there was a bathroom and not like at the old Relámpago place or in the stinking colonias where the ground festered. He was glad he did not have to run through the mud to the little house, with griping bowels and heaving stomach. The buses roared.
At noon his wife called for a taxi to take them to the clinic.
“They will give you something,” she murmured. He was too wretched to argue. In that place they sat side by side on torn plastic chairs. Adina filled out the complicated forms. The room was crowded with people, wailing, coughing children, an old woman who kept passing her hand across her brow as though to stroke away some pain that lay near the surface, an emaciated boy. More people pressed in, leaning against the wall, squatting or sitting on the floor."|"Accordion Crimes"|"Annie Proulx"

Isidro and Michael did not say much, packed the instruments. He knew they were hoping they could stay the night, not have to start the thousand-mile drive against blinding truck lights back to Texas, cramped in the car, burning eyes, yawning and stopping for coffee, Isidro saying “two hours and forty minutes, hombre, we’d be on the ground.”"|"Accordion Crimes"|"Annie Proulx"

He had a job for a few months delivering white ashtray sand to luxury hotels and apartment buildings, but the concessionaire replaced him with a nephew and then there was no work. The big accordéon was in and out of the pawnshop. Besides, he disdained the drawling, mangled language and the Québécois musette style, hurried and without savor, worse than anything he’d ever heard. There was no jazz at all, and he despised the stupid reels and gigues of the carrot farmer and bûcheron, the gibberish mouth-music of crazy syllables and the way musicians danced their feet while playing. He stole a few records of Jo Privat although he had no Victrola, imagining the taste of Paris in his throat, the flavor of his old street life."|"Accordion Crimes"|"Annie Proulx"

He had been duped and cheated all his days since his cursed mother had twisted the wire hangers tight to hold his arms at his sides and slapped him to the edge of the quay and into the greasy Seine, he had been forced to Québec where they masticated the language into a sodden porridge, tricked—yes, tricked and trapped by wily redskins—into an unsavory marriage, lured to Maine, a brutally provincial cul-de-sac, with false information. He had another proof in the spring of 1937 when the planer sheared off three fingers of his right hand, leaving the index finger partially severed and, in a few days, fat and green with infection. The doctor arrived at two in the morning and after a squinting look said the kerosene lamp was worthless and he couldn’t see anything. He went out and drove his shock-sprung Buick up to the kitchen window and, in the headlight glare, examined the remaining finger."|"Accordion Crimes"|"Annie Proulx"

Wilf tuned his fiddle, the familiar bending notes as the tightening strings sought E and A and D and G, the accordion took in warm breath and at last expelled such a sonorous chord that the kitchen shook with it, the beer trembled in their glasses. They warmed up with “Smiles,” “My Blue Heaven,” “Little Brown Jug” and Dolor’s standby, “You Are My Sunshine,” then tried whatever Wilfred had worked out from listening to the radio, “Get Out of Here,” “Kansas City,” and “Dance with Me, Henry,” similar but not the same, twisted around to what he could play, and Dolor followed along, sometimes guessing wrong, but it sounded pretty good and it was getting better."|"Accordion Crimes"|"Annie Proulx"

They were exhilarated, groaning, laughing, still hearing the music, still seeing the way a roomful of people sprang and shuffled and swayed and pressed against each other because they had played the twenty songs they knew, still seeing the sparking voltage in the sink and feeling relief when Mrs. Bubbie, not dead, looked at her husband and said through stiff white lips, you pinhead."|"Accordion Crimes"|"Annie Proulx"

Enormous sensitivities prickled: loud colors, bright light, the beeping of dump trucks in reverse, slamming doors and the conversations around him scraped his nerves raw. He developed allergies to dust, mold, apples and tomatoes. He was constipated, bought packets of laxatives at the Cut Rate drugstore in Millinocket, but nothing worked. He heard of a health food store that had just opened in Portland and made the long drive to forage through the jars of blackstrap and honey, the coarse bran and dark apricot ears. He bought packets of ginseng tea and nerve tisanes but developed abdominal pain, sore throat, shooting pains in his joints. One night pain spread through his face, a dull, severe ache that was unbearable at night. It hurt to rest his cheek on the pillow but if he turned on his back the pain flowed in waves from ear to ear. His mouth was burning up, his tongue swelled until he could barely speak. He woke at two in the morning with groin pains shooting up one leg and into his abdomen, across and down the other leg, circumscribing an endless circle of pain. It hurt to urinate, to defecate. He wrote out a list of pain and suffering in a shaking, paralyzed hand and brought it to the doctors at the V.A. Hospital.

He was giving the green accordion all he could, it was breaking out breathy sobbing roars as though from a strongman’s heaving chest, it was an instrument of sweat and that big crying voice talking to them, but even with the grille off, even with the new reeds, it wasn’t right. It didn’t have the range. He didn’t like that devil’s head and the flames painted on it. He’d paid too much for it, beguiled by the reflection of his own eyes. His mind was made up. He’d bring it to Chicago and sell it to some homesick squeezer and he’d get himself a big-key strong-back like the one Clifton played, more notes than he’d know what to do with, the one the beautiful women threw their underwear at, wriggling out of damp scanties on the dance floor and hurling them at the big accordion which caught them in its folds and squeezed and kneaded the flimsy scraps of nylon, like Boozoo Chavis who at intermission sold extra-large panties printed TAKE EM OFF! THROW EM IN THE CORNER! That accordion fool, drunk and wild, fell off a barstool onto the floor and kept right on playing.

Money was rolling in big waves but not even the foam touched the black shore. All those notebooks wouldn’t save a single one from the hot pan, all those histories of black women, those invisible suffering ones at the bottom of the bag. Her apartment was filled with notebooks, yellow snapshots, studio photographs, diaries written on paper bags, ill-spelled pages of herbal cures illustrated with leaves and flowers and colored with dyes squeezed from stems and petals, a sharecrop account written on a shingle with a burnt stick, a letter printed on a piece of apron by a woman homesteader in Kansas describing the death of her husband, a thick manuscript in beautiful cursive script on pages fashioned from cut-up circus posters, My So-called Life with the O.K. Minstrel Circus, recipes written on scrap wood with a nail dipped in soot ink, the midnight thoughts of a charwoman who cleaned federal offices during the Second World War, scrawled on pages gleaned from wastebaskets, the lines of anonymous poets, scraps of lives of thousands of black women. She’d done it on her lousy salary: used-book shops, church bazaars, yard sales, dim, dusty boxes in thrift stores, trash cans and Dumpsters, asking everyone she met, you got any books or letters or whatnot about black women, any black women, everywoman? She thought of Octave and his green accordion in Chicago: was he still alive? She’d sent a letter years ago, sent it by way of Lamb, sure would like to hear you play a little zydeco on that old green accordion. Never heard. Wasn’t that the old evil thing, brothers and sisters losing each other? Wasn’t it the old, old thing, families torn up like scrap paper, the home place left and lost forever?)"|"Accordion Crimes"|"Annie Proulx"
00:00|midnight|"Yes, Dorothy, her flame-shaped blue eyes winking, asked them every week, said come over Sunday, come over Saturday, come over Friday, any day, I make a nice dinner (she made also, besides the baby-food borscht and the false steak, a fish shape from cottage cheese, canned tuna and Jell-O, with a black olive eye), bring the kids over, come over and watch the television, but they never did, and now they had their own television, a portable Philco, and paying more than three dollars on it every week, Dorothy’s invitations making no more impression than if she’d been throwing peas at the wall, except on Christmas Eve they came for the Opłatek Wigilijny and the dinner which the old woman commanded though she could do very little of the work herself now, but last year they refused to go to midnight mass, and the old woman knew they had not fasted because the little girl left so much food on her plate and whined for pizza, bunching the hay under the tablecloth and demanding to open presents, and not Sonia, not Joey, never said nothing to her. The child had the same ash-blond hair and broad cheekbones and little ski-jump nose as Dorothy. The boy she couldn’t blame, he was only a baby and anyway a boy, but the girl needed correction. She was not too young to be enrolled in the dance class and learn the old dances. She was not too young for a little dustpan and broom."|"Accordion Crimes"|"Annie Proulx"

12:00|noon|"“But he enjoyed playing the instrument, not so much for the sound it made, not for his devotion to music, not like you, my dear child, but because when he played he was the master of the situation, he was the boss. He said, ‘I work all week, the foreman tells me “do this, do that, hurry it up,” he calls me dumb hunky, he calls me stupid polack, I take it because I have six mouths to feed. I want to pull his intestines out of him with an iron hook but I do the work. In silence, because if I don’t like it there’s a hundred more waiting to take my job. But I pick up the accordion and if the foreman is there in the place, maybe with his disgusting fellow bosses and repulsive wife, he gets up and dances to my tunes and I make them hot to watch him sweat and twirl.’ So he said, the devil. He always played for money and command, never for pleasure in the kitchen or the neighbors’ enjoyment on the stoop. That’s what they did, you know, in the old days, people just made music with each other for a good time, not for money, but always there was a family that was good, they all played the instruments. On Sundays we’d have a picnic in Glowacka Park, start at noon, and you could buy a hot dog or good Polish things; I sold pierozki at these picnics and made a nice bit of money. There’d always be somebody’s polka band—two violins, you know, the bass fiddle and the clarinet, no accordion at all, they’d just play all afternoon and we’d dance. No music pages, they play from their heads, they were geniuses. You know, the dancers used to sing out a line of a song, or not even sing it, just shout it like, and the musicians they had to catch it, know it and play it back in the same key. Oh, they were so good. Well, your grandfather, he sees after a while there is some money starting to come to the polka band players and there was all kinds of places that wanted polka bands—Polish Homes, the Polish Club, not the culture evening but the Saturday night dance, little dance halls all over the place, the union halls, bars and Polka Dot restaurant, the Polish League of War Veterans, a lot of restaurants, Polonia Hall—oh, there was plenty of polka dancing, and a lot of fun, and weddings, weddings, weddings, everybody was getting married and you got to have polkas. So your grandfather decides, this is in 1926, he decides he’s going to have a polka band. So he gets a couple of fellows together, a fiddle, they don’t need the second one because they got the accordion, a clarinet, drums, and he’s very good. They picked an American name, the Polkalookas. The drum was good, pick up their feet, yes? He was a shrewdie, your grandfather. He’d take two engagements for the same night, hire some extra fellows and get both bands set up at different places, then he’d run back and forth between them and collect the money for both. It was not so old-fashioned, this music, as the polka bands in the park. No, a little faster and louder because of the accordion and the drums. And he got the idea for the Baby Polka Band, he got your father, Hieronim, only six years old, and five or six other little kids and got them all going with instruments, playing little baby polkas. A comb and paper, a triangle, they had a little girl singer, so cute. People loved this very much. But he was not happy and he drank all the money from the band playing. After a while he quit, just like that, but your father, Hieronim, he kept on, played with other bands, whoever would ask him, even though he was young, and he brought every cent he earned back to me.”"|"Accordion Crimes"|"Annie Proulx"
"ap 01:00"|one|"He came to the funeral home at dusk with men from the Polish Club, the good singers. Hieronim, soaped and shaved and dressed in a sharkskin suit, lay in his walnut case like a polished knife in a silver chest. The singers filed in and stood along the wall. To their left was a small table covered with a white cloth and on it a dish of peppermints and a saucer of cloves. The hymns and the prayers began, Hail Marys, hymns to the Mother of God, to the saints, then, after an hour, the men went out to the parking lot and drank beer and whiskey to intensify their grief, while the women said the rosary, voices elongating, drawing out the ancient words. The men filed in again with flushed faces, belching and hiking at their belts, stood once more along the wall. Darker and more morbid became the hymns, groaning pleas to God to remove the singers from the misery of the body—I am lost, I am damned, I have sinned. They sang of the damp grave, the final hour, and of sinful humans’ vain pleas for mercy: “The clock strikes one, the thread of life slips from my grasp, the clock strikes two …” There was a midnight supper of black coffee, bananas and cold pork. All through the night the singing went on, Old Man Bulas’s voice cracking and shrill under the strain, and at dawn they said the last prayers for the dead and Old Man Bulas started the Angelus, I now bid you farewell. At seven the undertaker’s men loaded Hieronim into the hearse and the singers followed in cars with the windows rolled down even though it was a raw morning, the men still singing, seeing the cold sweat of the grass, their heads aching and vocal cords so strained they sang with a kind of breathless roar."|"Accordion Crimes"|"Annie Proulx"

They had a good routine, though it was a little risky. First he came out onstage alone, but kind of reluctant, looking back offstage, dressed in his sky blue satin suit, carrying the purple glitter accordion, then he’d turn a little and the line of blue sequins she’d sewed up the pants seams flashed. He’d frown and look worried, look offstage, shake his head. Nothing obvious, just really look worried. Wait. Then, just when the judges started whispering to each other, gonna have to move on to the next one, she’d come running out in her purple satin suit with the sky blue accordion and the audience would give them a big hand even before they played a note, just glad she hadn’t loused it up for him.

And Jerry says in that sarcastic voice, ‘no, thanks, we don’t think throwing up onstage is a real great act.’ Tell you what, sweetheart, I got to get these accordions back to whence they came from before eleven. Why don’t I go back to the motel, check the kids, get the car, turn in the accordions and then I’ll come back here and we’ll have some fun. Go to mass in the morning, it’s a polka mass, right across the street, have the Polish breakfast and start back. Stop in that town, Morley, talk to the cops about our instruments.

Under the streetlight, a few hundred feet from the Polonia, something small stuck out of the snow. She picked it up, a pack of cards with a rubber band around it and a folded paper.

She whispered, I’ll be right back with something, climbed over Joey, snoring now with the open-mouth rasp of a sleeping drunk, went to the door with her purse and slipped the chain. She left it ajar. The hallway was a mess of melted snow, wadded paper, street handouts for slow-dance partners showing a photo of a bosomy girl with her mouth forming a suggestive O, ticket stubs, an empty pint bottle, crushed Coca-Cola cans, a sodden blue mitten.

He wandered around town, went into the drugstore and bought shaving cream and aspirin, in the café ordered coffee and a piece of gluey red pie the waitress said was strawberry-rhubarb, looked at western-cut shirts in the Kowboy Korner, tried on a pair of Larry Mahan boots, “handmade, hand lasted and pegged, extra-wide steel shank and a good thick sole, last you a few years,” said the clerk, grey stiff schnauzer hair, a red spot between his eyes, leaning against the wall next to a framed paper like a diploma, the Patriotic Citizens Award Given in Grateful Appreciation for Unsolicited Inspirational Patriotic Service to the Community through the Daily Display of Our National Flag, and Vergil caught on that the cloth flapping outside the show window was the corner of an immense flag secured at windows on the upper level of the building; but the boots felt strange, he didn’t like that pushing arch under his foot, and the high heel embarrassed him."|"Accordion Crimes"|"Annie Proulx"

Now it was impossible for her to breathe beneath the deep ocean of pain and she gasped and choked, “help! Nils, help, oh please, help, help me. Oh, help, help.” And in the afternoon the pain began to boil and bubble; she was a fish dropped living into a cauldron.
