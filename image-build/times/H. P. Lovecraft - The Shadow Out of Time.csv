13:00|"one in the present day"|"The story is told through the eyes of Nathaniel Wingate Peaslee, an American living in the first decade of the 20th century, who is ""possessed"" by a Yithian. He fears he is losing his mind when he unaccountably sees strange vistas of other worlds and of the Yithian library city. He also feels himself being led about by these creatures and experiences how they live. When he is returned to his own body, he finds that those around him have judged him insane due to the actions of the Yithian that possessed his body. While he was experiencing a Yithian existence in Earth's ancient past, the Yithian occupying his body was experiencing a human one in the present day."|"The Shadow Out of Time"|"H. P. Lovecraft"

I began to see strange shapes before my eyes, and to feel that I was in a grotesque room other than the classroom."|"The Shadow Out of Time"|"H. P. Lovecraft"

It was clear that I had no remembrance of my identity and my past, though for some reason seemed anxious to conceal his lack of knowledge. My eyes glazed strangely at the persons around me, and the flections of my facial muscles were altogether unfamiliar."|"The Shadow Out of Time"|"H. P. Lovecraft"

"ap 06:00"|"6 o’clock"|"It was at 6 o’clock that a hesitant, foreign voice on the telephone asked Dr Wilson to call at my house and bring me out of a peculiar faint. This call — a long-distance one — was later traced to a public booth in the North Station in Boston, but no sign of the lean foreigner was ever unearthed."|"The Shadow Out of Time"|"H. P. Lovecraft"
11:15|"11.15 A.M."|"At 11.15 A.M., 27 September, I stirred vigorously, and my hitherto masklike face began to show signs of expression. Dr Wilson remarked that the expression was not that of my secondary personality, but seemed much like that of my normal self. About 11.30 I muttered some very curious syllables — syllables which seemed unrelated to any human speech. I appeared, too, to struggle against something. Then, just afternoon — the housekeeper and the maid having meanwhile returned — I began to mutter in English."|"The Shadow Out of Time"|"H. P. Lovecraft"
"~ 03:30"|"About 3:30 a.m."|"About 3:30 a.m. a violent wind blew up, waking everyone in camp and felling three of the tents. The sky was unclouded, and the desert still blazed with that leprous moonlight. As the party saw to the tents my absence was noted, but in view of my previous walks this circumstance gave no one alarm. And yet, as many as three men — all Australians — seemed to feel something sinister in the air."|"The Shadow Out of Time"|"H. P. Lovecraft"
"ap > 05:00"|"just past five"|"It was just past five, with the bloated, fungoid moon sinking in the west, when I staggered into camp — hatless, tattered, features scratched and ensanguined, and without my electric torch. Most of the men had returned to bed, but Professor Dyer was smoking a pipe in front of his tent. Seeing my winded and almost frenzied state, he called Dr. Boyle, and the two of them got me on my cot and made me comfortable. My son, roused by the stir, soon joined them, and they all tried to force me to lie still and attempt sleep."|"The Shadow Out of Time"|"H. P. Lovecraft"
