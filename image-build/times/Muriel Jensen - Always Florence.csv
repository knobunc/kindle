10:00|"10:00 a.m."|"He awoke every morning determined to do better that day. Usually, he was shot down by 10:00 a.m. Either he got in the way of one of Dylan’s MythBusters-wannabe experiments that was eventually going to kill them all, or Sheamus burst into tears because Nate sent him back upstairs to get his jacket before letting him out to play. Sheamus was convinced there was a monster in his bedroom closet."|"Always Florence"|"Muriel Jensen"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"After doughnuts were selected and beverages poured, Clarissa, the committee’s chairwoman, started the meeting. For all the group’s frivolity, the items on the agenda were efficiently worked through one by one. By ten o’clock they’d decided to do several small projects throughout the fall to accommodate all the groups who wanted to help, culminating with one formal event with a Christmas in Old Astoria theme."|"Always Florence"|"Muriel Jensen"
12:00|noon|"Clarissa looked over her notes. “Not much. We’re agreed that we’ll have a series of small events so that all the groups that want to help us can. The high school kids are having a car wash and bake sale. The grade school kids are selling candy. The Astoria Coffee House and the Urban Café are contributing half the proceeds from a particular weekend to the cause. And the Downtown Association has agreed to devote a Saturday from noon to five where a portion of each business’s sales come to us for the food bank. What else? What’s Kiwanis doing, Nate?”"|"Always Florence"|"Muriel Jensen"
"ap 04:30"|four-thirty|"BY THE TIME Nate left the office at four-thirty, Halloween had taken over Astoria. Traditionally, businesses welcomed trick-or-treaters in the late afternoon before the Monster Bash took place. Hundreds of costumed children, their parents in tow, swooped down upon the merchants in search of treats. Jonni and Karen stood outside the office with plastic pumpkins filled with candy, seemingly having as much fun as the kids."|"Always Florence"|"Muriel Jensen"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"The living room clock chimed eight. Sheamus poked Dylan on the shoulder. “Suite Life of Zack and Cody is on.” He turned to his uncle. “Can we go watch TV before bed?”"|"Always Florence"|"Muriel Jensen"
03:34|"3:34 a.m."|"DYLAN SAT IN the middle of his bed, his flashlight aimed at the sketch he’d worked on tonight. It was 3:34 a.m. and he was wide-awake. He’d heard the phone ring and the sound of his uncle’s voice. A photographer client called all hours of the day or night because he was always in another country."|"Always Florence"|"Muriel Jensen"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"“How’s Friday morning? That’s usually a short day for me. I’ll just catch up in the afternoon.”
“Can we make it early? I have the art class at ten.”

"ap < 10:00"|"nearly ten o’clock"|"It was nearly ten o’clock. He’d brought up the card table from the basement and washed it as he’d promised Stella."|"Always Florence"|"Muriel Jensen"
"~ 20:00"|"around 8:00 p.m."|"They were all in a stupor of overindulgence when the women returned around 8:00 p.m. Nate heard them in the kitchen and was a little surprised to hear laughter, since they’d been up since 5:00 a.m. Maybe being without men was as good for them as being without women had been for him and Hunter and Dennis."|"Always Florence"|"Muriel Jensen"

"ap < 05:00"|"just before five"|"He wasn’t, and it went well. Nate packed up his briefcase just before five, feeling victorious and really, really satisfied. The IRS had accepted the Binghams’ offer and the reverse mortgage process had begun."|"Always Florence"|"Muriel Jensen"
22:00|"ten that night"|"By ten that night the Banker’s Suite, a beautiful space to begin with, was a re-creation of Christmas in Old Astoria, as the fund-raiser’s theme promised. Floor-to-ceiling photographs from the nineteenth century had been affixed to foam core and stood up against the walls as though the old downtown had been brought inside. Lights had been inserted in every window in the photos, and Bobbie had led a group of artistic volunteers in adding color to the figures visible in windows and on the street."|"Always Florence"|"Muriel Jensen"
"ap 09:11"|911|"“She died. Arrhythmia, they said. Sometimes caused by chemo drugs.” He drew a ragged breath. “She was tired and we were lying on the bed, talking baby names, and she...she suddenly couldn’t breathe. I helped her sit up, and when that didn’t help, I called 911. She died in the ambulance.”"|"Always Florence"|"Muriel Jensen"
"< 01:00"|"just before 1:00 a.m."|"On one of his trips from the front door to the kitchen, he saw the lights go out at Bobbie’s. It was just before 1:00 a.m. His cell phone rang. It was Dennis."|"Always Florence"|"Muriel Jensen"
"ap > 11:00"|"after eleven"|"RAIN BATTERED THE roof and the windows when Bobbie awoke on Sunday. It was after eleven and she could smell coffee and something mapley. Her father’s French toast, she guessed. Monet was wrapped in a tight ball against her side and she had one moment of cozy happiness until her new reality came down on her like a sledgehammer."|"Always Florence"|"Muriel Jensen"
12:00|noon|"“Liberty Cab and Shuttle is picking me up at noon tomorrow,” Bobbie said, trying to sound as though it was a good thing. “I talked to the boys this afternoon and they said you explained everything. Whatever you told them, they don’t seem to hate me. So, thank you.”"|"Always Florence"|"Muriel Jensen"
22:22|"10:22 p.m."|"She glanced at the clock: 10:22 p.m. She imagined Nate would still be up, but was reluctant to knock on the door if he wasn’t. She went to her porch and saw that his kitchen was in darkness, but a subtle, colorful glow came from the front of the house. The Christmas tree."|"Always Florence"|"Muriel Jensen"
