00:00|Midnight|"Surprisingly, during these same crucial fifteen years, Whitman saw in print only twenty-one of his poems and twenty-two short stories. His first poem, “Young Grimes,” was published in the Long Island Democrat on January 1, 1840—clearly imitative, since it followed the model of a popular poem entitled “Old Grimes,” by Albert G. Greene. “Young Grimes” is as conventional as “Old Grimes” in its rhyme, meter, religious expression, and sentimentality; there seems to be no signs of America’s great outlaw poet in its didactic lines. Even as he progressed through the decade, Whitman did not make substantial improvements to the formulaic poetry he contributed to the penny dailies. For example, “The Mississippi at Midnight,” originally published in the New Orleans Daily Crescent on March 6, 1848, bears much more similarity to Whitman’s earliest verse than to the twelve poems of the 1855 Leaves of Grass: Its forced rhyme, predictable meter, and hyper-dramatic tone suggest that Whitman had not yet found his poetic voice."|"Leaves of Grass"|"Walt Whitman"
18:48|1848|"Of the three types of New Yorkers, “commuters give the city its tidal restlessness; natives give it solidity and continuity; but the settlers give it passion,” writes E. B. White in his essay “Here Is New York” (reprinted in Lopate, Writing New York: A Literary Anthology, pp. 696-697). Whitman belonged to the third category. Though born on a Long Island farm, he discovered at an early age that the city fed his soul. When his parents moved back to the country in 1833, the fourteen-year-old boy decided to stay on alone in Brooklyn and work in the printing industry. An employer helped him acquire a card for a circulating library; on his own, he started attending the theater and participating in a debating society. Looking for work during difficult times, Whitman left New York during his late teens and early twenties to teach school on Long Island. He disliked the job and eagerly returned to the world of city journalism in 1841. Until 1848 Whitman bounced from one Brooklyn or Manhattan publisher or newspaper to the next; he reported on local news, reviewed concerts and operas, and wrote his own fledgling poems and short stories. When he was fired from his editorship of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle in 1848, Whitman made an impetuous decision to try working in New Orleans. Not surprisingly, the now-confirmed New Yorker was back within three months. Later that year, Whitman secured his position in his beloved Brooklyn by buying a Myrtle Avenue lot and building a home on the site (with a printing office and bookstore on the first floor). Though he sold this property in 1852, he continued to call Brooklyn (and occasionally, Manhattan) home until 186X, when he left to search for his brother George, who was wounded at the battle of Fredericksburg, and settled in Washington, D.C."|"Leaves of Grass"|"Walt Whitman"

Where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous 
shuddering of their hides, 
Where the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen, where andirons 
straddle the hearth-slab, where cobwebs fall in festoons from 
the rafters; 
Where trip-hammers crash, where the press is whirling its cylinders, 
Wherever the human heart beats with terrible throes under its ribs, 
Where the pear-shaped balloon is floating aloft, (floating in it 
myself and looking composedly down,) 
Where the life-car is drawn on the slip-noose, where the heat 
hatches pale-green eggs in the dented sand, 
Where the she-whale swims with her calf and never forsakes it, 
Where the steam-ship trails hind-ways its long pennant of smoke, 
Where the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the 
water, 
Where the half-burn’d brig is riding on unknown currents, 
Where shells grow to her slimy deck, where the dead are 
corrupting below; 
Where the dense-starr’d flag is borne at the head of the regiments, 
Approaching Manhattan up by the long-stretching island, 
Under Niagara, the cataract falling like a veil over my 
countenance, 
Upon a door-step, upon the horse-block of hard wood outside, 
Upon the race-course, or enjoying picnics or jigs or a good game 
of base-ball, 
At he-festivals, with blackguard gibes, ironical license, bull- 
dances, drinking, laughter, 
At the cider-mill tasting the sweets of the brown mash, sucking 
the juice through a straw, 
At apple-peelings wanting kisses for all the red fruit I find, 
At musters, beach-parties, friendly bees, huskings, house-raisings; 
Where the mocking-bird sounds his delicious gurgles, cackles, 
screams, weeps, 
Where the hay-rick stands in the barn-yard, where the dry-stalks 
are scatter‘d, where the brood-cow waits in the hovel, 
Where the bull advances to do his masculine work, where the 
stud to the mare, where the cock is treading the hen, 
Where the heifers browse, where geese nip their food with short 
jerks, 
Where sun-down shadows lengthen over the limitless and 
lonesome prairie, 
Where herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square 
miles far and near, 
Where the humming-bird shimmers, where the neck of the long- 
lived swan is curving and winding, 
Where the laughing-gull scoots by the shore, where she laughs 
her near-human laugh, 
Where bee-hives range on a gray bench in the garden half hid by 
the high weeds, 
Where band-neck’d partridges roost in a ring on the ground with 
their heads out, 
Where burial coaches enter the arch’d gates of a cemetery, 
Where winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled trees, 
Where the yellow-crown’d heron comes to the edge of the marsh 
at night and feeds upon small crabs, 
Where the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm noon, 
Where the katy-did works her chromatic reed on the walnut-tree 
over the well, 
Through patches of citrons and cucumbers with silver-wired leaves, 
Through the salt-lick or orange glade, or under conical firs, 
Through. the gymnasium, through the curtain’d saloon, through 
the office or public hall; 
Pleas’d with the native and pleas’d with the foreign, pleas’d with 
the new and old, 
Pleas’d with the homely woman as well as the handsome, 
Pleas’d with the quakeress as she puts off her bonnet and talks 
melodiously, 
Pleas’d with the tune of the choir of the whitewashed church, 
Pleas’d with the earnest words of the sweating Methodist 
preacher, impress’d seriously at the camp meeting; 
Looking in at the shop windows of Broadway the whole forenoon, 
flatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate glass, 
Wandering the same afternoon with my face turn’d up to the 
clouds, or down a lane or along the beach, 
My right and left arms round the sides of two friends, and I in the 
middle; 
Coming home with the silent and dark-cheek’d bush boy, (behind 
me he rides at the drape of the day,) 
Far from the settlements studying the print of animals’ feet, or the 
moccasin print, 
By the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish patient, 
Nigh the coffin’d corpse when all is still, examining with a candle; 
Voyaging to every port to dicker and adventure, 
Hurrying with the modern crowd as eager and fickle as any, 
Hot toward one I hate, ready in my madness to knife him, 
Solitary at midnight in my back yard, my thoughts gone from me 
a long while, 
Walking the old hills of Judæa with the beautiful gentle God by 
my side, 
Speeding through space, speeding through heaven and the stars, 
Speeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring, and the 
diameter of eighty thousand miles, 
Speeding with tail’d meteors, throwing fire-balls like the rest, 
Carrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its 
belly, 
Storming, enjoying, planning, loving, cautioning, 
Backing and filling, appearing and disappearing, 
I tread day and night such roads."|"Leaves of Grass"|"Walt Whitman"

00:00|midnight|"Stretch’d and still lies the midnight, 
Two great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness, 
Our vessel riddled and slowly sinking, preparations to pass to the 
one we have conquer‘d, 
The captain on the quarter-deck coldly giving his orders through 
a countenance white as a sheet, 
Near by the corpse of the child that serv’d in the cabin, 
The dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefully 
curl’d whiskers, 
The flames spite of all that can be done flickering aloft and 
below, 
The husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty, 
Formless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves, dabs of flesh 
upon the masts and spars, 
Cut of cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the soothe of 
waves, 
Black and impassive guns, litter of powder-parcels, strong scent, 
A few large stars overhead, silent and mournful shining, 
Delicate sniffs of sea-breeze, smells of sedgy grass and fields by 
the shore, death-messages given in charge to survivors, 
The hiss of the surgeon’s knife, the gnawing teeth of his saw, 
Wheeze, cluck, swash of falling blood, short wild scream, and 
long, dull, tapering groan, 
These so, these irretrievable."|"Leaves of Grass"|"Walt Whitman"

Give me now libidinous joys only, 
Give me the drench of my passions, give me life coarse and rank, 
To-day I go consort with Nature’s darlings, to-night too, 
I am for those who believe in loose delights, I share the midnight 
orgies of young men, 
I dance with the dancers and drink with the drinkers, 
The echoes ring with our indecent calls, I pick out some low 
person for my dearest friend, 
He shall be lawless, rude, illiterate, he shall be one condemn’d by 
others for deeds done, 
I will play a part no longer, why should I exile myself from my 
companions? 
O you shunn’d persons, I at least do not shun you, 
I come forthwith in your midst, I will be your poet, 
I will be more to you than to any of the rest."|"Leaves of Grass"|"Walt Whitman"

Banding the bulge of the earth winds the hot equator, 
Curiously north and south turn the axis-ends, 
Within me is the longest day. the sun wheels in slanting rings, it 
does not set for months, 
Stretch’d in due time within me the midnight sun just rises above 
the horizon and sinks again. 
Within me zones, seas, cataracts, forests, volcanoes, groups, 
Malaysia. Polynesia, and the great West Indian islands."|"Leaves of Grass"|"Walt Whitman"
00:00|midnight|"Always our old feuillage! 
Always Florida’s green peninsula—always the priceless delta of 
Louisiana—always the cotton-fields of Alabama and Texas, 
Always California’s golden hills and hollows, and the silver 
mountains of New Mexico—always soft-breath’d Cuba, 
Always the vast slope drain’d by the Southern sea, inseparable 
with the slopes drain’d by the Eastern and Western seas, 
The area the eighty-third year of these States, the three and a half 
millions of square miles, 
The eighteen thousand miles of sea-coast and bay-coast on the 
main, the thirty thousand miles of river navigation, 
The seven millions of distinct families and the same number of 
dwellings—always these, and more, branching forth into 
numberless branches, 
Always the free range and diversity—always the continent of 
Democracy; 
Always the prairies, pastures, forests, vast cities, travelers, Kanada, 
the snows; 
Always these compact lands tied at the hips with the belt stringing 
the huge oval lakes; 
Always the West with strong native persons, the increasing density 
there, the habitans, friendly, threatening, ironical, scorning 
invaders; 
All sights, South, North, East—all deeds, promiscuously done at 
all times, 
All characters, movements, growths, a few noticed, myriads 
unnoticed, 
Through Mannahatta’s streets I walking, these things gathering, 
On interior rivers by night in the glare of pine knots, steamboats 
wooding up, 
Sunlight by day on the valley of the Susquehanna, and on the 
valleys of the Potomac and Rappahannock and the valleys of 
the Roanoke and Delaware, 
In their northerly wilds beasts of prey haunting the Adirondacks 
the hills or lapping the Saginaw waters to drink, 
In a lonesome inlet a sheldrake lost from the flock sitting on the 
water rocking silently, 
In farmers’ barns oxen in the stable, their harvest labor done they 
rest standing, they are too tired, 
Afar on arctic ice the she-walrus lying drowsily while her cubs 
play around, 
The hawk sailing where men have not yet sail‘d, the farthest polar 
sea, ripply, crystalline, open, beyond the floes, 
White drift spooning ahead where the ship in the tempest 
dashes, 
On solid land what is done in cities as the bells strike midnight 
together, 
In primitive woods the sounds there also sounding, the howl of 
the wolf, the scream of the panther, and the hoarse bellow of 
the elk, 
In winter beneath the hard blue ice of Moosehead lake, in 
summer visible through the clear waters, the great trout 
swimming, 
In lower latitudes in warmer air in the Carolinas the large black 
buzzard floating slowly high beyond the tree tops, 
Below, the red cedar festoon’d with tylandria, the pines and 
cypresses growing out of the white sand that spreads far and 
flat, 
Rude boats descending the big Pedee, climbing plants, parasites 
with color’d flowers and berries enveloping huge trees, 
The waving drapery on the live-oak trailing long and low, 
noiselessly waved by the wind, 
The camp of Georgia wagoners just after dark, the supper-fires 
and the cooking and eating by whites and negroes, 
Thirty or forty great wagons, the mules, cattle, horses, feeding 
from troughs, 
The shadows, gleams, up under the leaves of the old sycamore 
trees, the flames with the black smoke from the pitch-pine 
curling and rising; 
Southern fishermen fishing, the sounds and inlets of North 
Carolina’s coast, the shad-fishery and the herring-fishery, the 
large sweep-seines, the windlasses on shore work’d by horses, 
the clearing, curing, and packing houses; 
Deep in the forest in piney woods turpentine dropping from the 
incisions in the trees, there are the turpentine works, 
There are the negroes at work in good health, the ground in all 
directions is cover’d with pine straw; 
In Tennessee and Kentucky slaves busy in the coalings, at the 
forge, by the furnace-blaze, or at the corn-shucking, 
In Virginia, the planter’s son returning after a long absence, 
joyfully welcom’d and kiss’d by the aged mulatto nurse, 
On rivers boatmen safely moor’d at nightfall in their boats under 
shelter of high banks, 
Some of the younger men dance to the sound of the banjo or 
fiddle, others sit on the gunwale smoking and talking; 
Late in the afternoon the mocking-bird, the American mimic, 
singing in the Great Dismal Swamp, 
There are the greenish waters, the resinous odor, the plenteous 
moss, the cypress-tree, and the juniper-tree; 
Northward, young men of Mannahatta, the target company from 
an excursion returning home at evening, the musket-muzzles 
all bear bunches of flowers presented by women; 
Children at play, or on his father’s lap a young boy fallen asleep, 
(how his lips move! how he smiles in his sleep!) 
The scout riding on horseback over the plains west of the 
Mississippi, he ascends a knoll and sweeps his eyes around; 
California life, the miner, bearded, dress’d in his rude costume, 
the stanch California friendship, the sweet air, the graves one 
in passing meets solitary just aside the horse-path; 
Down in Texas the cotton-field, the negro-cabins, drivers driving 
mules or oxen before rude carts, cotton bales piled on banks 
and wharves; 
Encircling all, vast-darting up and wide, the American Soul, with 
equal hemispheres, one Love, one Dilation or Pride; 
In arriere the peace-talk with the Iroquois the aborigines, the 
calumet, the pipe of good-will, arbitration, and indorsement, 
The sachem blowing the smoke first toward the sun and then 
toward the earth, 
The drama of the scalp-dance enacted with painted faces and 
guttural exclamations, 
The setting out of the war-party, the long and stealthy march, 
The single file, the swinging hatchets, the surprise and slaughter 
of enemies; 
All the acts, scenes, ways, persons, attitudes of these States, 
reminiscences, institutions, 
All these States compact, every square mile of these States 
without excepting a particle; 
Me pleas’d, rambling in lanes and country fields, Paumanok’s 
fields, 
Observing the spiral flight of two little yellow butterflies shuffling 
between each other, ascending high in the air, 
The darting swallow, the destroyer of insects, the fall traveler 
southward but returning northward early in the spring, 
The country boy at the close of the day driving the herd of cows 
and shouting to them as they loiter to browse by the 
roadside, 
The city wharf, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Charleston, New 
Orleans, San Francisco, 
The departing ships when the sailors heave at the capstan; 
Evening—me in my room—the setting sun, 
The setting summer sun shining in my open window, showing the 
swarm of flies, suspended, balancing in the air in the centre of 
the room, darting athwart, up and down, casting swift shadows 
in specks on the opposite wall where the shine is; 
The athletic American matron speaking in public to crowds of 
listeners, 
Males, females, immigrants, combinations, the copiousness, the 
individuality of the States, each for itself—the money-makers, 
Factories, machinery, the mechanical forces, the windlass, lever, 
pulley, all certainties, 
The certainty of space, increase, freedom, futurity, 
In space the sporades, the scatter’d islands, the stars—on the firm 
earth, the lands, my lands, 
O lands! all so dear to me—what you are, (whatever it is,) I 
putting it at random in these songs, become a part of that, 
whatever it is, 
Southward there, I screaming, with wings slow flapping, 
with the myriads of gulls wintering along the coasts of 
Florida, 
Otherways there atwixt the banks of the Arkansaw, the Rio 
Grande, the Nueces, the Brazos, the Tombigbee, the Red 
River, the Saskatchawan or the Osage, I with the spring 
waters laughing and skipping and running, 
Northward, on the sands, on some shallow bay of Paumanok, I 
with parties of snowy herons wading in the wet to seek worms 
and aquatic plants, 
Retreating, triumphantly twittering, the king-bird, from piercing 
the crow with its bill, for amusement—and I triumphantly 
twittering, 
The migrating flock of wild geese alighting in autumn to refresh 
themselves, the body of the flock feed, the sentinels outside 
move around with erect heads watching, and are from time to 
time reliev’d by other sentinels—and I feeding and taking 
turns with the rest, 
In Kanadian forests the moose, large as an ox, corner’d by 
hunters, rising desperately on his hind feet, and plunging 
with his fore-feet, the hoofs as sharp as knives—and I, 
plunging at the hunters, corner’d and desperate, 
In the Mannahatta, streets, piers, shipping, store-houses, and the 
countless workmen working in the shops, 
And I too of the Mannahatta, singing thereof—and no less in 
myself than the whole of the Mannahatta in itself, 
Singing the song of These, my ever-united lands—my body no 
more inevitably united, part to part, and made out of a 
thousand diverse contributions one identity, any more than 
my lands are inevitably united and made ONE IDENTITY; 
Nativities, climates, the grass of the great pastoral Plains, 
Cities, labors, death, animals, products, war, good and evil—
these me, 
These affording, in all their particulars, the old feuillage to me 
and to America, how can I do less than pass the clew of the 
union of them, to afford the like to you? 
Whoever you are! how can I but offer you divine leaves, that you 
also be eligible as I am? 
How can I but as here chanting, invite you for yourself to collect 
bouquets of the incomparable feuillage of these States?"|"Leaves of Grass"|"Walt Whitman"
00:00|midnight|"Yes, if you will allow me to say so, 
I, my friends, if you do not, can plainly see her, 
The same undying soul of earth‘s, activity’s, beauty‘s, heroism’s 
expression, 
Out from her evolutions hither come, ended the strata of her 
former themes, 
Hidden and cover’d by to-day’s, foundation of to-day’s 
Ended, deceas’d through time, her voice by Castaly’s fountain, 
Silent the broken-lipp’d Sphynx in Egypt, silent all those century- 
baffling tombs, 
Ended for aye the epics of Asia‘s, Europe’s helmeted warriors, 
ended the primitive call of the muses 
Calliope’s call forever closed, Clio, Melpomene, Thalia dead, 
Ended the stately rhythmus of Una and Oriana, ended the quest 
of the holy Graal, 
Jerusalem a handful of ashes blown by the wind, extinct, 
The Crusaders’ streams of shadowy midnight troops sped with the 
sunrise, 
Amadis, Tancred, utterly gone, Charlemagne, Roland, Oliver gone, 
Palmerin, ogre, departed, vanish’d the turrets that Usk from its 
waters reflected, 
Arthur vanish’d with all his knights, Merlin and Lancelot and 
Galahad, all gone, dissolv’d utterly like an exhalation; 
Pass’d! pass‘d! for us, forever pass’d, that once so mighty world, 
now void, inanimate, phantom world, 
Embroider‘d, dazzling, foreign world, with all its gorgeous 
legends, myths, 
Its kings and castles proud, its priests and warlike lords and 
courtly dames, 
Pass’d to its chamel vault, coffin’d with crown and armor on, 
Blazon’d with Shakspere’s purple page, 
And dirged by Tennyson’s sweet sad rhyme."|"Leaves of Grass"|"Walt Whitman"
00:00|midnight|"Wild, wild the storm, and the sea high running, 
Steady the roar of the gale, with incessant undertone muttering, 
Shouts of demoniac laughter fitfully piercing and pealing, 
Waves, air, midnight, their savagest trinity lashing, 
Out in the shadows there milk-white combs careering, 
On beachy slush and sand spirts of snow fierce slanting, 
Where through the murk the easterly death-wind breasting, 
Through cutting swirl and spray watchful and firm advancing, 
(That in the distance! is that a wreck? is the red signal flaring?) 
Slush and sand of the beach tireless till daylight wending, 
Steadily, slowly, through hoarse roar never remitting, 
Along the midnight edge by those milk-white combs careering, 
A group of dim, weird forms, struggling, the night confronting, 
That savage trinity warily watching."|"Leaves of Grass"|"Walt Whitman"
00:00|midnight|"But the mother needs to be better, 
She with thin form presently drest in black, 
By day her meals untouch‘d, then at night fitfully sleeping, often 
waking, 
In the midnight waking, weeping, longing with one deep 
longing, 
O that she might withdraw unnoticed, silent from life escape and 
withdraw, 
To follow, to seek, to be with her dear dead son."|"Leaves of Grass"|"Walt Whitman"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"A march in the ranks hard-prest, and the road unknown, 
A route through a heavy wood with muffled steps in the darkness, 
Our army foil’d with loss severe, and the sullen remnant 
retreating, 
Till after midnight glimmer upon us the lights of a dim-lighted 
building, 
We come to an open space in the woods, and halt by the dim 
lighted building, 
‘Tis a large old church at the crossing roads, now an impromptu 
hospital, 
Entering but for a minute I see a sight beyond all the pictures and 
poems ever made, 
Shadows of deepest, deepest black, just lit by moving candles and 
lamps, 
And by one great pitchy torch stationary with wild red flame and 
clouds of smoke, 
By these, crowds, groups of forms vaguely I see on the floor, some 
in the pews laid down, 
At my feet more distinctly a soldier, a mere lad, in danger of 
bleeding to death, (he is shot in the abdomen,) 
I stanch the blood temporarily, (the youngster’s face is white as 
a lily,) 
Then before I depart I sweep my eyes o’er the scene fain to 
absorb it all, 
Faces, varieties, postures beyond description, most in obscurity, 
some of them dead, 
Surgeons operating, attendants holding lights, the smell of ether, 
the odor of blood, 
The crowd, O the crowd of the bloody forms, the yard outside 
also fill‘d, 
Some on the bare ground, some on planks or stretchers, some in 
the death-spasm sweating, 
An occasional scream or cry, the doctor’s shouted orders or calls, 
The glisten of the little steel instruments catching the glint of the 
torches, 
These I resume as I chant, I see again the forms, I smell the odor, 
Then hear outside the orders given, Fall in, my men, fall in;
But first I bend to the dying lad, his eyes open, a half-smile gives 
he me, 
Then the eyes close, calmly close, and I speed forth to the 
darkness, 
Resuming, marching, ever in darkness marching, on in the ranks, 
The unknown road still marching."|"Leaves of Grass"|"Walt Whitman"
00:00|midnight|"While my wife at my side lies slumbering, and the wars are over 
long, 
And my head on the pillow rests at home, and the vacant 
midnight passes, 
And through the stillness, through the dark, I hear, just hear, the 
breath of my infant, 
There in the room as I wake from sleep this vision presses upon me; 
The engagement opens there and then in fantasy unreal, 
The skirmishers begin, they crawl cautiously ahead, I hear the 
irregular snap! snap! 
I hear the sounds of the different missiles, the short t-h-t! t-h-t! of 
the rifle balls, 
I see the shells exploding leaving small white clouds, I hear the 
great shells shrieking as they pass, 
The grape like the hum and whirr of wind through the trees, 
(tumultuous now the contest rages,) 
All the scenes at the batteries rise in detail before me again, 
The crashing and smoking, the pride of the men in their 
pieces, 
The chief-gunner ranges and sights his piece and selects a fuse 
of the right time, 
After firing I see him lean aside and look eagerly off to note the 
effect; 
Elsewhere I hear the cry of a regiment charging, (the young 
colonel leads himself this time with brandish’d sword,) 
I see the gaps cut by the enemy’s volleys, (quickly fill’d up, no 
delay,) 
I breathe the suffocating smoke, then the flat clouds hover low 
concealing all; 
Now a strange lull for a few seconds, not a shot fired on either 
side, 
Then resumed the chaos louder than ever, with eager calls and 
orders of officers, 
While from some distant part of the field the wind wafts to my 
ears a shout of applause, (some special success,) 
And ever the sound of the cannon far or near, (rousing even in 
dreams a devilish exultation and all the old mad joy in the 
depths of my soul,) 
And ever the hastening of infantry shifting positions, batteries, 
cavalry, moving hither and thither, 
(The falling, dying, I heed not, the wounded dripping and red 
I heed not, some to the rear are hobbling,) 
Grime, heat, rush, aide-de-camps galloping by or on a 
full run, 
With the patter of small arms, the warning s-s-t of the rifles, (these 
in my vision I hear or see,) 
And bombs bursting in air, and at night the vari-color’d rockets."|"Leaves of Grass"|"Walt Whitman"
12:00|noon|"Lo, the most excellent sun so calm and haughty, 
The violet and purple morn with just-felt breezes, 
The gentle soft-born measureless light, 
The miracle spreading bathing all, the fulfill’d noon, 
The coming eve delicious, the welcome night and the stars, 
Over my cities shining all, enveloping man and land."|"Leaves of Grass"|"Walt Whitman"
00:00|midnight|"Proud music of the storm, 
Blast that careers so free, whistling across the prairies, 
Strong hum of forest tree-tops—wind of the mountains, 
Personified dim shapes—you hidden orchestras, 
You serenades of phantoms with instruments alert, 
Blending with Nature’s rhythmus all the tongues of nations; 
You chords left as by vast composers—you choruses, 
You formless, free, religious dances—you from the Orient, 
You undertone of rivers, roar of pouring cataracts, 
You sounds from distant guns with galloping cavalry, 
Echoes of camps with all the different bugle-calls, 
Trooping tumultuous, filling the midnight late, bending me 
powerless, 
Entering my lonesome slumber-chamber, why have you 
seiz’d me?"|"Leaves of Grass"|"Walt Whitman"
00:00|midnight|"Come forward 0 my soul, and let the rest retire, 
Listen, lose not, it is toward thee they tend, 
Parting the midnight, entering my slumber-chamber, 
For thee they sing and dance 0 soul."|"Leaves of Grass"|"Walt Whitman"

midnight,

The beautiful lost swimmer, the ennuyé, the onanist, the female 
that loves unrequited, the money-maker, 
The actor and actress, those through with their parts and those 
waiting to commence, 
The affectionate boy, the husband and wife, the voter, the 
nominee that is chosen and the nominee that has fail‘d, 
The great already known and the great any time after to-day, 
The stammerer, the sick, the perfect-form’d, the homely, 
The criminal that stood in the box, the judge that sat and 
sentenced him, the fluent lawyers, the jury, the audience, 
The laugher and weeper, the dancer, the midnight widow, the red 
squaw, 
The consumptive, the erysipalite, the idiot, he that is wrong‘d, 
The antipodes, and every one between this and them in the

How, justified by it, the horrors, evils, battles of the earth! 
How the bright fascinating lambent flames of it, in every age and 
land, have drawn men’s eyes, 
Rich as a sunset on the Norway coast, the sky, the islands, and the 
cliffs, 
Or midnight’s silent glowing northern lights unreachable."|"Leaves of Grass"|"Walt Whitman"
00:00|midnight|"In midnight sleep of many a face of anguish, 
Of the look at first of the mortally wounded, (of that indescribable 
look,) 
Of the dead on their backs with arms extended wide, 
I dream, I dream, I dream."|"Leaves of Grass"|"Walt Whitman"
00:00|MIDNIGHT|"
A CLEAR MIDNIGHT
This is thy hour O Soul, thy free flight into the wordless, 
Away from books, away from art, the day erased, the lesson done, 
Thee fully forth emerging, silent, gazing, pondering the themes 
thou lovest best, 
Night, sleep, death and the stars."|"Leaves of Grass"|"Walt Whitman"
12:00|noon|"I too carol the sun, usher’d or at noon, or as now, setting, 
I too throb to the brain and beauty of the earth and of all the 
growths of the earth, 
I too have felt the resistless call of myself."|"Leaves of Grass"|"Walt Whitman"

12:00|midday|"Thanks in old age—thanks ere I go, 
For health, the midday sun, the impalpable air—for life, mere 
life, 
For precious ever-lingering memories, (of you my mother dear—
you, father—you, brothers, sisters, friends,) 
For all my days—not those of peace alone—the days of war the 
same, 
For gentle words, caresses, gifts from foreign lands, 
For shelter, wine and meat—for sweet appreciation, 
(You distant, dim unknown—or young or old—countless, 
unspecified, readers belov‘d, 
We never met, and ne’er shall meet—and yet our souls embrace, 
long, close and long;) 
For beings, groups, love, deeds, words, books—for colors, forms, 
For all the brave strong men—devoted, hardy men—who’ve 
forward sprung in freedom’s help, all years, all lands, 
For braver, stronger, more devoted men—(a special laurel ere I 
go, to life’s war’s chosen ones."|"Leaves of Grass"|"Walt Whitman"
18:55|1855|"Twenty-three poems written by Whitman were published before 1855. The awkwardness of Whitman’s language and the conventional rhyme schemes and imagery will surprise anyone familiar with the energy and independence of his mature verse. Some of these pieces (like “The Death and Burial of McDonald Clarke” and “Young Grimes”) are directly imitative of popular poems of the time; others (“The Mississippi at Midnight”) are sensationalistic; still others (“Our Future Lot,” “The Punishment of Pride”) are didactic or overtly pious. One senses the insecurities of Whitman as man and artist: Trying so hard to please the average reader of New York’s penny-daily newspapers, he has forgotten himself and his own voice."|"Leaves of Grass"|"Walt Whitman"

"|"Leaves of Grass"|"Walt Whitman"
00:00|midnight|"After an interval, reading, here in the midnight, 
With the great stars looking on—all the stars of Orion looking, 
And the silent Pleiades—and the duo looking of Saturn and 
ruddy Mars; 
Pondering, reading my own songs, after a long interval, (sorrow 
and death familiar now,) 
Ere closing the book, what pride! what joy! to find them, 
Standing so well the test of death and night! 
And the duo of Saturn and Mars!"|"Leaves of Grass"|"Walt Whitman"
12:00|Noon|"76 (p. 502) Autumn Rivulets: Like the three clusters that followed it in 1881 (“Whispers of Heavenly Death,” “From Noon to Starry Night,” and “Songs of Parting”), “Autumn Rivulets” has a title that reflects the poet’s sense of impending death. His personal history provides a clear indication of why mortality was so much on his mind at this time. Beginning in his fifties, Whitman was plagued with health problems and emotional trials: He suffered a paralytic stroke in January 18 and his mother died in May of that year; he became involved in an ill-fated relationship with Harry Stafford in 1876; and he was taken ill again in 1879 while traveling west."|"Leaves of Grass"|"Walt Whitman"
12:00|Noon|"96 (p. 595) From Noon to Starry Night: The idea of the title begins with the high noon described in the first poem (”Thou Orb Aloft Full-Dazzling“) and ends with the vision of ”A Clear Midnight“ (p. 617). The poems also follow Whitman’s career from his ”noon“ on through the evening of his life, with poems selected from the First Edition as well as new works for 1881. In addition to a feeling of time that has passed, these poems convey a sense of great distances crossed: from south to north, Spain to Colorado, and back to Whitman’s beloved Mannahatta."|"Leaves of Grass"|"Walt Whitman"

12:00|Noon|"108 (p. 618) Songs of Parting: As the title suggests, the themes of this cluster are death and departure: The poet glances backward, but also ponders his legacy and the future of America. Just as this title is a more forthright statement of Whitman’s feelings of mortality than are “Autumn Rivulets,” “Whispers of Heavenly Death,” and “From Noon to Starry Night” (the other three newly organized clusters in the 1881 Leaves of Grass), the poems in this cluster focus more directly and intensely on the themes of death and swiftly passing time."|"Leaves of Grass"|"Walt Whitman"
12:00|Noon|"Song of the Exposition, p. 351: This poem was written as a tribute to the Annual Exhibition of the American Institute in 1871. It first appeared in several newspapers, and then as a booklet entitled “After All Not to Create Only: Recited by Walt Whitman on Invitation of Managers American Institute, on Opening Their 40th Annual Exhibition, New York, Noon, September 7, 1871.” “After All, Not to Create Only” was annexed to the 1872 impression of Leaves of Grass; in 1876 it was published as “Song of the Exposition” in “Centennial Songs,” a separately published cluster annexed to Two Rivulets. An explanatory preface explaining the “impulses” that led to the poem’s initial “oral delivery” was dropped in 1881."|"Leaves of Grass"|"Walt Whitman"
12:00|Noon|"From Noon to Starry Night, p. 595: This cluster of twenty-two poems was new to the 1881 edition of Leaves of Grass, as was the “Autumn Rivulets” cluster.

12:00|Noon|"From Far Dakota’s Canons, p. 613: First appearing in the New York Tribune of June 18, 1876, as “A Death Sonnet for Custer,” the poem was included in the 1876 edition of Leaves of Grass before gaining its final position in the “From Noon to Starry Night” cluster in 1881."|"Leaves of Grass"|"Walt Whitman"

12:00|Noon|"Whitman’s rich imagery translates well into painting. The poet has been a favorite among artists since the time of Vincent van Gogh, who praised Whitman vigorously in letters to his family while he painted Starry Night (1889). Indeed, van Gogh may even have taken his title from Whitman’s poem cluster “From Noon to Starry Night,” which was published in France just before the artist began work on the famous painting."|"Leaves of Grass"|"Walt Whitman"
