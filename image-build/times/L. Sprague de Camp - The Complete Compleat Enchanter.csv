"ap 09:56"|9:56|"He seemed to have been walking for days, though he knew it could hardly be a matter of hours. Reluctantly he took one hand from his pocket and gazed at his wrist watch. It read 9:56; certainly wrong. When he held the watch to a numbed ear he discovered it had stopped. Neither shaking nor winding could make it start."|"The Complete Compleat Enchanter"|"L.

"ap > 09:00"|"after nine o’clock"|"A small noise at the door was Sverre, putting his head in for a look around and then vanishing again. Of the buxom young women nothing had been seen since they took up the wooden platters. Though the house was obviously going to bed, Shea found himself not in the least sleepy. It could hardly be much after nine o’clock. But in a world without artificial light other than that of torches, people would rise and set with the sun. Shea wondered whether he, too, would come around to that dismal habit. Probably, unless he succeeded in getting back to his own world. That was a rather upsetting thought. But, hell, he had taken the risk with his eyes open, and even if this was not the world he had expected to land in, it was still one in which his twentieth-century appliances should give him certain advantages. It would be time enough to worry when—"|"The Complete Compleat Enchanter"|"L. Sprague de Camp"
"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"It must have been around noon—Shea could only guess at the time—when Skrymir turned and waved at the biggest mountain they had yet seen. The wind carried away the giant’s words, but Thor seemed to have understood. The goats quickened their pace toward the mountain, whose top hung in cloud."|"The Complete Compleat Enchanter"|"L. Sprague de Camp"
"~ 16:30"|vespers|"“I hight Hardimour. Aye; it is even the hour of vespers, and being ladyless I am put forth from the fair entertainment within.” He smiled wryly. “And what hight you? Nay, tell me not now; for I see my dinner and bed approach, mounted on the back of a jennet.”"|"The Complete Compleat Enchanter"|"L. Sprague de Camp"
"ap 01:02"|one-two|"Thump! A rock bounced off the man’s head. The man sat down. Shea turned back to the first and just parried a cut at his head. The first kiltie was really boring in now. Shea backed another step, slipped, recovered, parried, and backed. The water tugged at his legs. He couldn’t meet the furious swings squarely for fear of snapping his light blade. Another step back, and another, and the water was only inches deep. Now! Disengage, double, one-two, lunge—and the needlepoint slid through skin and lungs and skin again. Shea recovered and watched the man’s knees sag. Down he went."|"The Complete Compleat Enchanter"|"L. Sprague de Camp"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"At ten the next morning, Shea came out of the vaultlike castle and blinked into the morning sun. Armor pressed his body in unfamiliar places. The big broadsword at his side was heavier than any he had ever handled."|"The Complete Compleat Enchanter"|"L. Sprague de Camp"
12:00|midday|"Now magicians began to pour into the hall, by window and door, so many of them Shea could not keep up with their names. The trumpet for the midday meal found him vainly trying to catch up—and also separated him from Chalmers, who was taken in tow to sit at the masters’ table."|"The Complete Compleat Enchanter"|"L.

"< 16:30"|"before vespers"|"“Would you believe it, fair lady, and you, gentles? A hart of eight brought I home, as pricksome a bit of venison as ever a man saw before vespers. A meal for the Emperor’s own majesty, one might think; make it a pie, or what will you? Nay, these base varlets must even serve it up boiled, as though ’twere salt stockfish in Lent. I gagged, but our friend Roland put down the first two bits fairly enough. At the third, me seems he must have recovered a whit of the laws of cookery, for he gave a great howl like a lion and set upon the knaves, beating in their heads with his fists. But alas, to what purpose? Not even a crack will let savor into such skulls.”"|"The Complete Compleat Enchanter"|"L. Sprague de Camp"
"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"A solemn moon came up and winked through the leaves, then settled slowly toward disappearance-point again as Shea desperately flogged his own memory and the paladin’s on the details of the vanished career. Once he thought he was going to lose his man, when Roland mentioned the name of Angelica, put down his head and wept for quite five minutes; once he thought all would come clear at once, when Shea threw in the name of the giant Ferragus, and the paladin seized a bone from the table, leaping up and shouting “Montjoie!” But that one only collapsed into babbling, and it must have been well past midnight, a poor hour for this country, when Roland once more got to his feet, and pressed the heels of both palms to his eyes."|"The Complete Compleat Enchanter"|"L. Sprague de Camp"
12:00|noon|"As the cavalcade set off through a hot sun that had already passed noon, it occurred to Shea that it would take something more than magic to make his wife try sleeping in a bed again after this."|"The Complete Compleat Enchanter"|"L. Sprague de Camp"

"~ 16:30"|"evening prayer"|"Outside the shadows were already stretching across the valley below the slope that held the encampment. Although Shea did not know when the hour of evening prayer was, he guessed it would be soon. That meant they must hurry if they wanted to catch Roger as part of the combined operation. Once the bruiser got loose with an uproar going on there would be no finding him."|"The Complete Compleat Enchanter"|"L. Sprague de Camp"
"~ 16:30"|"evening prayer"|"Shea glanced over his shoulders to see the sun sinking fast. “But we’ve got to see him before the evening prayer,” he insisted, shaking off the fingers Medoro was plucking at his sleeve with. “He’s a friend of ours. We knew him in Carena.”"|"The Complete Compleat Enchanter"|"L. Sprague de Camp"
"~ 16:30"|"evening prayer"|"“O Lord, the Prince Roger’s withers will be wrung. Yet it is written that it is better than one man should have an unhappiness, which endures only the appointed hour of God, than that two should lose their lives. Learn that if Lord Roger should be roused before the hour of evening prayer, we two should lose nothing less than our heads, for so he has sworn it by the hair of his beard.”"|"The Complete Compleat Enchanter"|"L.

12:00|noon|"She was tireless; it was he who had to ask for the first halt, and later, for another. Toward what he judged to be noon they made the third pause by the side of a little stream from which they drank and shared half one of the birds left from the previous night’s supper. The girl frowned suddenly."|"The Complete Compleat Enchanter"|"L. Sprague de Camp"
00:00|midnight|"Lemminkainen stopped his capering. “Shall a hero of my stature fear the land of frost and midnight?” he asked. “Tall you are, but lack the mighty thews of Kalevala’s heroes. You might help if the battle were with children.”"|"The Complete Compleat Enchanter"|"L. Sprague de Camp"
12:00|noon|"It was followed by more of the same. On the fifth day, the single-stick practice at noon had progressed so far that Lemminkainen himself took a hand and promptly knocked Brodsky out. It appeared to improve relations all around; the detective took it in good part, and the hero was in the best of humor that evening."|"The Complete Compleat Enchanter"|"L. Sprague de Camp"

Now I will be fighting any man in Ireland that gives me the time, but unless you are a hero it is not good to fight at five to two, and it is time that these pigs of Lagenians learned their manners. So now it is time for you to be telling me who you are and where you come from and whither bound. If you are indeed Fomorians, the better for you—King Conchobar is friends with them this year, or I might be making you by the heard shorter.”"|"The Complete Compleat Enchanter"|"L. Sprague de Camp"
12:00|noon|"The ride was smoother than the one of the previous day only because the horses went at a walk so as not to outdistance the column of retainers on foot. Conversation over the squeaking of the wheels began by being sparse and rather boring, with Cuchulainn keeping his chin well down on his chest. But he apparently liked Belphebe’s comments on the beauty of the landscape. As it came on to noon he began to chatter, addressing her with an exclusiveness that Shea found disturbing, though he had to admit that the little man talked well, and always with the most perfect courtesy."|"The Complete Compleat Enchanter"|"L.

00:00|midnight|"“What other night would it be but the Lughnasadh? Was it not for that you would be coming here? No, I forget. Forgive an old man.” He smote his brow to emphasize the extent of his fault. “Maine mo Epert was after telling me that it was myself you came to see, and you could have done no better. Come midnight when the moon is high, and I will be showing you the powers of Ollgaeth the druid.”"|"The Complete Compleat Enchanter"|"L. Sprague de Camp"
