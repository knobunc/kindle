"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"At the time Bob’s parents had dropped him off on the doorstep, Uncle Tam had had a roommate, Wayne Redpoll, with glary eyes and a rubbery mug, his features arranged around a nose so beaked that it made his eyes unmemorable. His brown hair was crinkled and violent, springing with energy. In the mornings before ten o’clock when the shop opened, he lounged around without a shirt doing crossword puzzles, tapping the pencil against his discolored teeth. His chest was strange, the nipples almost under his armpits. He was not good at the puzzles, too impatient for them, and after a few minutes would go his own way, filling in the blanks with any old word, right or wrong. Bob disliked him mildly and it was partly to vanquish him at crosswords that he began to study The Child’s Illustrated Dictionary which Uncle Tam had fished out of a box and handed to him, saying, “Happy congratulations on this great Wednesday morning.” By the time he was twelve he could do the Tuesday New York Times puzzle with a pen in less than twenty minutes, but Thursday and Friday took many hours with pencil as the clues were sly and presumed knowledge of cultural events in the dim past. All kinds of words streamed through his mind—ocelot, strabismus, plat du jour, archipelago, bemusement, vapor, mesa, sitar, boutique. Wayne tried to counter Bob’s skill by dredging up odd crossword information and explaining it to him as though that were the point of the puzzles: that crosswords had been invented in 1913 by a Liverpool newspaperman, that in 1924 they became a national craze. He generally pooh-poohed the New York Times puzzles, which, he said, were child’s play—a meaningful look at Bob—compared to the evil puzzles of the British, particularly those with cryptic clues constructed by the old masters, Torquemada, Ximenes and Azed. But this persiflage did him no good. He did not have the knack and Bob did."|"That Old Ace in the Hole"|"Annie Proulx"

Uncle Tam locked the shop at 4:30, even when customers stood beseechingly at the door as he hung up the Closed sign. The partners’ devotion to the program was extreme and they had evolved certain rituals. The coffee table was cleared of magazines and bills that had accumulated during the week. Their notebooks and pens were set out. The drinks, according to season and affordable ingredients, were to be made in the jazz-age silver penguin shaker—drinks containing coconut milk were esteemed, but coconut milk was expensive and it usually came down to a six-pack of Bud split between them. The food was peanut butter sandwiches, or carrot sticks and cheap cheese, or, if they were flush, buffalo wings or cardboard containers of tripe stew from Chickee’s place."|"That Old Ace in the Hole"|"Annie Proulx"

He could hear Bromo’s voice growling on and on in some kind of low-key manifesto. He was curious but could not make out what they were saying, even when he stood with his ear on the door. Once in a while Uncle Tam would ask a question and off Bromo would go again, long, rolling breakers of speech, saying more than Bob had heard him say in eight years. When the cookies were done he put some on a plate and brought them in but the moment he pushed the door open they both shut up, watched him put the plate down, said thank you and waited until he left before starting to talk again. He took a handful of warm cookies for himself and went up to his room.

Hugh Dough had sniggered knowingly, later inspired to do his own homework, but Francis Scott Keister was outraged on behalf of pure girlhood. A terrific fight followed, broken up by the principal. Both boys refused to say what had started it. In fact, Ad Slauter was entirely puzzled by the attack. So the feud began and had persisted over thirty years, each man coming by turn into the sheriff’s office to report the latest atrocity. Sheriff Hugh Dough would hear the complainant out and take notes, file them in the two voluminous dossiers of increasingly sophisticated criminal misdemeanor. The assaults were mostly rock-throwing and name-calling until high school when both wangled broke-down old hoopys to drive. Now buckets of paint were thrown, tires shot out, windshields broken. When Francis Scott Keister went to the Wichita Falls stock show with the 4-H group he bought a custom-designed bumper sticker that read I AM A PIECE OF SHIT and pasted it on the back of Slauter’s car. Ad Slauter responded, on the family vacation trip to Padre Island, by visiting the marina store where he stole three aerosol cans of expandable flotation foam and he used them to fill the engine compartment of Keister’s vehicle. He signed Keister up for subscriptions to gay pornographic magazines (“Bill me later”). Keister released black widow spiders on Slauter’s windowsill.

02:00|"two in the morning"|"He spent the evening with Lieutenant Abert, using his Texas road map to puzzle out the locations of the Bents’ panhandle trading posts, for the notes told him the trader brothers had built something called “the Adobe Fort” on the Canadian around 1840, and, in the spring of 1844 put up another trading post a few miles distant. Even with the big gazetteer, The Roads of Texas, he could not locate the marker streams, Bosque Grande Creek and Red Deer Creek. He supposed the map was not detailed enough or that the streams had been renamed. Later, from LaVon, he learned what he suspected, that this “adobe fort,” after the Bents abandoned it, was the famous Adobe Walls, the scene of a battle in 1874 between a war party of several hundred Comanches, Kiowas and Cheyennes (including the young Quanah Parker), led by the Comanche warrior Coyote Droppings (who claimed his medicine made him and those with him immune to bullets), and twenty-eight sharpshooter buffalo-hide hunters. The Medicine Lodge Treaty of 1867 forbade white men the right to hunt south of the Arkansas River, but white men did as they pleased. The same treaty forbade the Indians from raiding panhandle settlements, but the Indians continued to swoop down on homesteads. On this fine spring morning the Indians made a classic dawn attack. But the buffalo hunters had been awakened at two in the morning by the snap of the breaking ridgepole. They had repaired the pole and, sparked with coffee, decided to stay up and get an early start on the day. When the cry of “Indians!” came, they were awake and alert. They held off the Indians for three days. After a number of the attacking men fell, the main Indian body retreated to the ridges above Adobe Walls where they rode back and forth out of rifle range. On the third day the plainsman Billy Dixon snapped off a shot at one of the distant riders with his .50 Sharps rifle. The Indian fell dead from his horse and soon after the demoralized attackers, who had believed their strong medicine protected them from bullets, left. It was the beginning of the end, and a year later the panhandle had been ethnically cleansed of its native people. Billy Dixon’s long shot became a pillar of western myth."|"That Old Ace in the Hole"|"Annie Proulx"

Wait a minute, I’ve got it right here. ‘An unnamed woman, thought to be a disgruntled employee, entered a meeting room at Global Pork Rind and opened fire on four executives, killing one and severely wounding another. Mr. Quantum Goliath of Tokyo, the president of GPR, was at the meeting. The three survivors were taken to Denver General Hospital. The names of the deceased and injured were not given pending notification of next of kin. The woman is in custody.’ I was going to listen to the eleven o’clock news and see what they’d found out.”"|"That Old Ace in the Hole"|"Annie Proulx"

"ap 11:45"|11:45|"At 11:45, in the liquid heat, he walked out to the rodeo arena at the north end of the main street, a place of steel and wood corrals he had seen fifty times deserted and forlorn, the air pale yellow with suspended dust. Now the place thrummed with diesel pickups and stock trucks, early comers already filling the spectator bleachers, horses and bulls and calves in the stock pens. The thunderheads loomed, the darkling plain flat beneath its indigo bulk. The entranceway flew a banner announcing the 68th Woolybucket Ranch Rodeo. Barkers hawked cotton candy and cold drinks. He bought a ticket and went to the stands, picking out an aisle seat. The front row was taken up by eight assorted men, whom Bob guessed to be the monks from the Triple Cross, for they were dressed in chinos and short-sleeved shirts while the lay Woolybucket audience wore jeans and cowboy boots. Tourists wore shorts and T-shirts. The smell of food was everywhere. A turkey leg vendor roamed the aisles selling the hot meat, followed by the taco man, the barbecue rib man and the popcorn lady, then the stringy youth with a pierced cardboard tray holding towering cones of cotton candy, to Bob’s mind the second vilest confection on the planet, first place going to the candy apple. In the crowd Bob thought he saw the nurse with the flapper hair and dimpled cheeks, but when she turned he saw it was another woman. Perhaps he could see the nurse again when he met with the Chines at the hospital. Behind him someone said, “Fixin a have us a storm.”"|"That Old Ace in the Hole"|"Annie Proulx"
12:00|noon|"At noon on the dot the rodeo commenced, and Bob, surrounded by turkey leg munchers and squalling babies, stood with the rest of the crowd and took off his hat to the words of “The Cowboy’s Prayer” intoned by Rope Butt. The line of thunderheads flickered with lightning but seemed no closer. The northeast breeze freshened and people sighed with pleasure. As the crowd sat down the Grand Parade began, composed of scout troops and the children of local business owners in gaudy costumes and waving advertising flags on horses groomed to spectacular showiness, their polished hooves gleaming, brushed haunches a-shine, manes plaited in intricate designs that would excite envy in an Afro-American beauty shop. The announcer, up in his high booth, was Warnell Pue, an Old Dog regular, and he was drunk, cracking jokes about the clowns (clothed in women’s dresses chopped short at midthigh), mixing up names and even events. The contestants clustered with others from their ranches, stood leaning on the arena rails, alternately watching the action and the sky."|"That Old Ace in the Hole"|"Annie Proulx"
