"> 22:00"|"after ten in the evening"|"Mr. Lang again, the young woman says, irritated. I told you he's busy. Good afternoon, Mr. Lang. She begins closing the door. At least she remembered his name. Bennett quickly thrusts the book through the crack in the door, into her hand. She looks at it. Her frown softens. May I come back? he blurts out. She hesitates, looks again at the book, then at Bennett. A man's voice, baritone and distant, floats from a neighboring house. Try next Thursday, after ten in the evening, she says and shuts the door. Bennett strides happily around the half-gate and spends an hour walking through the cobblestone streets. On some impulse, he buys a green crystal thimble."|"Good Benito"|"Alan Lightman"
12:00|midday|"It snows. Snow is unusual for Baltimore. The streets remain buried under white blankets, the few cars that venture torth collide with each other or slide off the road. The city turns silent and white. At midday, Bennett manages to find one undaunted bus that is traveling to Fells Point. He goes to 137 Aliceanna, arriving in broad daylight for the first time in months."|"Good Benito"|"Alan Lightman"

His closet is full of white shirts, simplifying the problem of matching ensembles. The younger man coughs, places the pile of raggedy pages"|"Good Benito"|"Alan Lightman"

She always wore a white uniform in the house. When she arrived in the morning, coming in through the back of the house, she would stop in the utility room off the kitchen and change from her own clothes into the uniform hanging in the closet.

00:00|midnight|"It should be something immortal, said John, like: Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary. Bennett thoughtfully considered this proposal and shook his head no. How will we be regarded by posterity, he said, if our first message is poetry? Shouldn't we say something scientific, like the first ten digits of pi? I don't know, said John, scratching a mosquito bite. You got the tape recorder hooked up? Yep, said Bennett. The microphone was taped flush to the amplifier at the receiver. Bennett lifted his leg and pressed down the record button with a toe."|"Good Benito"|"Alan Lightman"
01:00|"One o'clock in the morning"|"One o'clock in the morning. Old man Taglia walks at this hour, unobserved, his house dark and asleep. He limps slowly in the moonlight. There is another light. He looks up to his left, toward the second-floor window."|"Good Benito"|"Alan Lightman"
01:00|"one in the morning"|"Bennett sits at his oak desk. They are so beautiful, the equations. Even visually beautiful, but especially beautiful in the mind. Their precision and power are beautiful, and as he begins to understand an equation, he gets the same feeling as seeing a moonrise over trees. In his mind, it is dark and still and then the tops of the trees on the far side of the bay begin to glow slightly, white and soft, and the white gets brighter, silhouetting the trees, and then a small piece of moon appears and the mathematics opens up and contains and shines in perfection. It is one in the morning, but he is not tired. He gains strength from himself. He does not need to go to the library, he does not need to ask other students or grown-ups for information or help. He can be here alone, in his room, with the beautiful mathematics and the moon and figure things out on his own. He can sit here naked at his oak desk with the clean, white paper and work in the absolute certainty and the solitude and perfection. Gliding through the world in his mind, he doesn't worry about his small height or his pimples or his problems with talking or his confusion at what people say. It is a world without bodies. It is a world of clear logic and grace. It is the best part of loneliness, without the sadness."|"Good Benito"|"Alan Lightman"

"ap 23:49"|"eleven to twelve"|"The subsequent conversion discussion took place in the conference room of the Holiday Inn on Summer Avenue, an unusual location chosen by Penny. Rabbi Spear didn't like this arrangement but he went along as a favor to Bennett. They were scheduled in the room from eleven to twelve. It was a very hot day in July. Outside, in the sweltering bright heat, the parched flowers drooped and even the squirrels hardly moved, their tails hanging limp. Inside, the air conditioners groaned. The future bride and groom and the rabbi sat bunched up at one end of a long table, all sweating. Rabbi Spear, now in his seventies, had begun having trouble with his legs, and a brown cane walker stood next to his satchel. He was not doing well in the heat. He had loosened his tie and taken off his jacket. He talked to Penny a few minutes, gave her several books to read, held her hand."|"Good Benito"|"Alan Lightman"

She gave countless hours to small groups of students, going over and over scenes from the plays. Here, someone didn't act angry enough. There, someone stood stiffly. Here, someone needed to wait one more beat between lines. She would take a single student aside and work with her for half an hour while everyone else waited. She paid no attention to time. When 5:30 came, someone would have to tell her. When a student needed more work, she came to the auditorium on weekends."|"Good Benito"|"Alan Lightman"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"They got to Vassar at seven and waited. The girls didn't show. This is real life, said Bill. They waited until eight and then went to a hamburger place near the college.

"~ 00:00"|"around midnight"|"The young men had actually forgotten their other mission to Vassar: to search for the nude photos taken of their freshman class at Blaine. They were certain that the photos were now in the hands of some all-women's college, like Vassar. They cringed every time they thought of those pictures and how they had lined up like sheep with their classmates, taken off their clothes as instructed, and been photographed front and back in the buff. It happened during freshman orientation week, as they were herded through the infirmary. A man wearing a tie and a look of importance had told them all that he was conducting sociological research on the relation between college performance and body type. So they stood in line, and each of the 600 of them, without a single refusal, stripped for one of the cameras. It was 1966. About a year later, the two boys were walking back from the library one evening, around midnight, when Bill suddenly slapped himself on the forehead and said, Holy shit, we were photographed nude. We let those bastards take naked pictures of us."|"Good Benito"|"Alan Lightman"

Saturdays or Sundays, Galvinston appeared. You're going all the way, Galvinston would say when he saw Bennett, You've got escape velocity.

He began staying at school every night, in his own office, closing his door. One night at midnight, Bennett was coming out of the reference room when he saw Davis emerge from his office with bloodshot eyes and a bitter look on his face. Bennett hardly recognized him. Davis said hello, an odd look of embarrassment swept over his face, and he hurried down the hall. A week later, Tarker, a third-year student, showed up with an elegant solution to the same problem Davis had been working on himself. Davis congratulated Tarker profusely. But he didn't come out of his office until the next morning. He began putting his name last on joint papers with his students, or crossing his name off altogether."|"Good Benito"|"Alan Lightman"

Baleski had been teaching a graduate course in quantum physics at Blaine for the semester and was about to return to Warsaw. Baleski could drink. Davis, however, had visited Strob-lich in Moscow and had learned how to really drink. After the first bottle, it was clear that Davis had won, but he wouldn't let Baleski bow out. He was ruthless. He played on Baleski's pride, well into the second bottle. Finally, Baleski began throwing up on the orange Navajo carpet and stumbled away, without admitting defeat."|"Good Benito"|"Alan Lightman"

The studio was on a busy street in Silver Spring, a large airy room with twenty-foot ceilings and huge north-facing windows. It was an old building with creaking floorboards.

But she began letting him drive her home, to her apartment on Lamont Street, near the navy yard. He never went in. They would sit in his car outside the apartment for an hour and watch the wavering of a streetlamp, masked and unmasked by the leaves of a tree, and she would lean her head back in the crook of his arm. Sometimes they would turn on the radio, very low, and listen to jazz. It would be ten or eleven at night."|"Good Benito"|"Alan Lightman"

She said something sleepily, and he got in his car and drove to her apartment. He didn't wait at the red lights. When he walked in, she was wearing a white cotton robe. She whispered that they had to be quiet, her roommate was sleeping. They sat on the couch. She started to cry. Just hold me, she said softly. I can't stand it any longer, he said. I know, she replied. They sat for a while without talking, just holding each other. Then she took his hand and led him into her bedroom. The next morning, she allowed him to give her the $200 she needed to release her car from the repair shop."|"Good Benito"|"Alan Lightman"
00:00|Midnight|"When he arrived home that night the house was dark. She had not waited up for him. He sat in a chair in the living room and resumed analyzing the curve in his mind. He turned on a single lamp, and the air glowed in a dim, yellow light. He must have been pondering in that low yellow light for a long time when he felt a hand on his shoulder. What time is it? she said. He looked at his watch. Midnight. She stared at him oddly. What's the matter, Bennett? she asked. Nothing, he said. You're crying, she said. He put his hand to his face, and he found it was wet. I'm all right, he said. Let's go to bed."|"Good Benito"|"Alan Lightman"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"A week later, in the middle of the night, he was awakened by the ringing of the telephone. It was her. How are you, Bennett? she said. Jesus, Penny, it's two in the morning, he said. I've swallowed twenty sleeping pills, she said."|"Good Benito"|"Alan Lightman"

Why don't you ever come to our house? she asks. Bennett looks away, to the far shore, then back to Katie. I'm going to start coming, he says, I promise. I can swim, she says. Can I get in the water and show you? Let's wait until we're back in shallow water, he says. I want to fish, shouts Katie. It's too late to fish, says Bennett. It's after six. You promised, bawls the little girl. Daddy said you would take me fishing and you promised. Yes, I did, says Bennett and smiles. Oh, goodie, says Katie.
