12:00|noon|"N: And if memory serves, if I may, I will say you were sitting at the noon position. I love first read-throughs because you get to find out what everybody’s vibe is, and who’s good, and who sucks. It’s fun—it’s like the first day of school. You find out who you’re going to be friends with. I remember whatever preconceived notions I had, I was just gobsmacked by how funny, sharp, and smart you are. Now, you know that you would have shown up prepared—you wouldn’t have just shown up and shit out a cold reading."|"The Greatest Love Story Ever Told"|"Megan Mullally"
15:00|"three o’clock in the afternoon"|"So I had all this exposure to culture. But New York was dangerous then. Seventy-second Street—it was like Beirut. Nobody EVER went that far uptown. Central Park was completely off-limits. You couldn’t set a toe in Central Park, even in the daytime. It was just discarded needles everywhere and crazy shit going down. One time a guy chased me down 66th Street between Columbus and Central Park West at three o’clock in the afternoon. We were at a full sprint. I finally ducked into the ABC building and asked for help. And this sounds like a joke, but it’s not: Ten years later I shot my first television show—The Ellen Burstyn Show—in that same building."|"The Greatest Love Story Ever Told"|"Megan Mullally"

So on Mondays I went to bed at eight, and I slept for an hour, and then my mom would wake me up, and I would watch Carol Burnett, and then go back to sleep."|"The Greatest Love Story Ever Told"|"Megan Mullally"

08:00|"eight in the morning"|"We had chapel every morning at my school. Every day at eight in the morning, you had to show up in chapel for thirty minutes. It wasn’t religious. I don’t really know what it was. It was kind of like a pep rally or something. We did sing a hymn or two, but I don’t remember much religion being brought into it. I do remember when I was in lower school they read The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe to us. So I don’t know what chapel was, exactly. But we had to go there every morning. I do know that."|"The Greatest Love Story Ever Told"|"Megan Mullally"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"Originally I wasn’t going to go to college—I was just going to go to New York and audition for Broadway shows. Then my mom said, “I’ll make a deal with you. Apply to one college, and if you get in, you’ll go, and if you don’t, you can go to New York.” We decided on Northwestern, and I remember lying on the floor of my bedroom at two in the morning and writing the most bullshit essay in the history of the world for my college application. And then I somehow got accepted. So . . . hilarious."|"The Greatest Love Story Ever Told"|"Megan Mullally"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"What I want to drive home is that in order for a marriage to succeed, the participants have to bend and be able to pick up the slack for each other, depending upon the proclivities of each spouse. Maybe one likes to rise early and one is more nocturnal, so the early riser is often tasked with business correspondence that wants to be delivered in a timely fashion, whilst the night owl will often surprise the farmer upon his rising with the large amount of work she achieved after midnight. It’s all a dance, and if one dancer is clumsy and wears a thick mustache, then the other gorgeous partner must use her grace and flexibility to compensate and cover so that the steps may be completed satisfactorily, until the climactic final lift, when his worth is suddenly revealed and fully on display as he lifts her above his head, displaying for all the world to see the swan who loves him for his simple ability to carry luggage, withstand physical pain, and grill a chop of lamb."|"The Greatest Love Story Ever Told"|"Megan Mullally"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"M: My mom had a flair for interior design. She enjoyed that, and she was good at it. It was interesting to me that she would move heavy pieces of furniture around by herself, like she was moved by the spirit to create, which is something that I now have taken to doing in my adult life . . . moving couches around at two in the morning."|"The Greatest Love Story Ever Told"|"Megan Mullally"
"ap 07:30"|7:30|"M: I don’t know if it’s the money that people begrudge. It might be that, but I think it’s other things, too. But in any event, the great part about reaching a certain level of success is that it opens doors and you get to work on cool projects with talented people—if you’re lucky. But the being-in-the-public-eye part of it is pretty dumb. It’s for the birds. There’s an old adage: The good thing about being a celebrity is that you can get a table in a restaurant. That is pretty much the best part about it. I mean, outside of the richer advantages we’ve mentioned, in terms of just the walking around in the world part—it’s nice if a restaurant is full and you say, “It’s for Nick Offerman,” and they suddenly say, “Yes, of course, Mrs. Offerman, we can fit you in at 7:30.” That part’s good."|"The Greatest Love Story Ever Told"|"Megan Mullally"
"ap 06:30"|6:30|"But this is a good example of how we deal: I was in a meeting at my shop on the east side of LA. And Megan starts texting me pictures of a strange, cute dog. And I just thought, “Oh, shit.” After the third picture, I texted back, “What’s going on?” and she texted, “Do you think you could come over to this dog adoption place? They close at seven.” And I said, “I don’t think I can—this meeting goes until 6:30.”"|"The Greatest Love Story Ever Told"|"Megan Mullally"

06:00|"six in the morning"|"N: And I think to myself, “What the fuck are you doing?” I’m leaving at six in the morning for a bunch of work away from home, and you know, there was a level of annoyance to it.
