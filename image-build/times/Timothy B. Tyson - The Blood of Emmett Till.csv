"~ 02:00"|"about two in the morning"|"It was probably the gunshot-thud of boots on the porch that pulled Reverend Moses Wright out of a deep sleep about two in the morning on Sunday, August 28, 1955. Wright was a sixty-four-year-old sharecropper, short and wiry with thick hands and a hawksbill nose. An ordained minister in the Church of God in Christ, Wright sometimes preached at the concrete-block church tucked into a cedar thicket just a half mile away; most people called him “Preacher.” Twenty-five white-tufted acres of cotton, almost ready for harvest, stretched out behind his unpainted clapboard house in a pitch-black corner of the Mississippi Delta called East Money. He had lived his entire life in the Delta, and he had never had any trouble with white people before."|"The Blood of Emmett Till"|"Timothy B. Tyson"
"~ 08:00"|"about eight o’clock that morning"|"Mamie and Emmett were to meet Uncle Moses and Wheeler at Englewood Station about eight o’clock that morning. It was practically around the corner, but even so, the whistle blew while Mamie was buying Emmett’s ticket, and they had to run to the train. “He liked to got left,” Wright said later. “If he’d taken five minutes later, he’d have missed it.” A quick kiss and he was gone, wearing his father’s silver ring engraved “L.T.” and waving to his mother from the top of the platform."|"The Blood of Emmett Till"|"Timothy B. Tyson"
02:00|"two o’clock in the morning"|"Eula Lee’s sons practiced a raw style of masculine camaraderie that revolved around guns, hunting, fishing, poker, and drinking. Boys would be boys and women would stay out of it. Carolyn said, “They did such crazy things all the time anyway, you didn’t really question what they were doing. ‘Well, you wanna go see if we can find a deer?’—you know, at two o’clock in the morning—or ‘Let’s go get so-and-so and play some cards.’ ” They shocked young Carolyn with their loud arguments over practically anything. “They did have some of the worst arguments, cuss-fights, you ever heard, with their poker games. You would think they were gonna get up and fight, yeah.” Eula Lee tried to reassure her daughter-in-law. “I would say ‘Oh, my goodness’ when I first got in the family, you know, and I thought, ‘Ooh, what’s going on, they’re getting ready to fight in there.’ And Mrs. Bryant would say, ‘Oh, don’t pay any attention to them, they’re not gon’ fight.’ ” Carolyn believed her, up to a point. “You just never knew what was coming—those kind of people. But they were hard.”"|"The Blood of Emmett Till"|"Timothy B. Tyson"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"Just after Emmett was kidnapped, Elizabeth Wright ran to the home of white neighbors to ask for help. It was not yet three in the morning. The darkness was complete, but urgency guided her steps across the fields to the distant house where the farmer and his wife slept. Perhaps she was too timid to explain herself well. Perhaps a black woman wailing at the door about a fourteen-year-old boy abducted by white men with guns frightened the couple. However Elizabeth asked for help, the wife wanted to give it but the husband would not consent, and Elizabeth returned home in tears, vowing to leave Mississippi forever. She insisted that Moses take her to her brother’s house in Sumner, so, leaving the five boys in their beds, they drove about half an hour to the home of Crosby Smith."|"The Blood of Emmett Till"|"Timothy B. Tyson"
05:00|"five in the morning"|"On the way back from the train station Moses picked up his brother-in-law Crosby Smith before driving back to Money. He intended to speak directly to the men who had threatened his life and kidnapped his nephew and ask them to return the boy—if he was still living. At about four or five in the morning, on a deserted street, the two men knocked at the back door of Bryant’s Grocery and Meat Market. Not knowing if they would be met with success or a shotgun blast, they did so with less noise than Roy and J.W. had made on the Wrights’ porch hours earlier."|"The Blood of Emmett Till"|"Timothy B. Tyson"
"ap ~ 09:00"|"about nine"|"At about nine on the morning of the kidnapping, Curtis Jones, one of the three cousins from Chicago who were staying with the Wrights, went to a neighbor’s house and called his mother, Willie Mae, to tell her the terrible news. She called Emmett’s mother: “I don’t know how to tell you. Bo.” Mamie’s mind began to race in horror. “Some men came and got him last night.” Mamie drove to her mother’s apartment at breakneck speed to share both news and anguish. Her mother alerted their church so that the congregation could pray for Emmett. Then Mamie did a curious thing, foreshadowing the boldness with which she would handle this tragedy. She started telephoning Chicago newspapers, which soon sent reporters to Alma’s apartment."|"The Blood of Emmett Till"|"Timothy B. Tyson"
"ap < 02:00"|"Just before two o’clock"|"They found nothing. Just before two o’clock they called off the search, and the sheriff left to question Roy. When Moses got home, well-meaning visitors were waiting at the house. “By Sunday noon, every Negro for miles around knew all about it,” he said. “The people kept coming and we prayed and prayed.” Rumors began to spread that J. W. Milam and Roy Bryant were the ones who had killed Reverend Wright’s nephew from Chicago."|"The Blood of Emmett Till"|"Timothy B. Tyson"

02:00|"two in the morning"|"While the Wright household prayed that Emmett was still alive, Roy Bryant slept. As Carolyn describes the scene in her memoir, when Roy came home in the early morning light, she asked him where he had been and what he and J.W. had done with the boy. This scenario supports later testimony that the brothers brought Emmett to the store for her to identify. However, it does not close the speculation about whether it was indeed Carolyn in the darkened vehicle hidden on the Wrights’ property at two in the morning who identified Emmett as the boy who had assaulted her."|"The Blood of Emmett Till"|"Timothy B. Tyson"
14:00|"two in the afternoon"|"Roy was still asleep when Sheriff Smith parked his squad car in front of Bryant’s Grocery at two in the afternoon. He woke only when he heard the pounding on the back door; then he quickly dressed and stepped outside, where the sheriff and his deputy, John Ed Cothran, were waiting. Smith and Roy got into the police car to talk. “I asked him about going down there [to the Wrights’ house] and getting that little nigger,” Smith testified. Roy acknowledged that he had done that. “I asked him why did he go down there and get that little nigger boy.” Roy said he had heard that the boy made some “ugly remarks” to his wife. He “said that he went down and got [Emmett Till] to let his wife see him to identify him, and then he said she said it wasn’t the right one, and then he said that he turned him loose.” Smith asked where they’d released Till. “He said right in front of the store. He said he went to some of his people—I don’t remember who he said just now—and he said he played cards there the rest of the night.” The sheriff arrested Roy for kidnapping and booked him into the Leflore County Jail."|"The Blood of Emmett Till"|"Timothy B.

"ap > 11:00"|"after eleven"|"By May 7, 1955, Lee had received countless death threats by phone and mail, including from one anonymous caller who said, “Nigger, you’re number one on a list of people we don’t need around here any more.” That night Lee drove downtown to pick up a suit from the dry cleaner’s for church the next day. It was after eleven, but relationships were informal among the town’s black merchants and Lee knew that his friend, who lived in the same building where he kept his dry cleaning shop, would not mind pulling a clean suit out of the back room."|"The Blood of Emmett Till"|"Timothy B. Tyson"
00:00|midnight|"Less than an hour after the midnight shotgun blasts took Lee’s life, operators for Belzoni’s telephone system reportedly began telling black customers that all of the town’s long-distance lines were in use. So Lee’s friends sped north to Mound Bayou to inform Dr. Howard, who called Representative Charles Diggs in Michigan, who called the White House. Others raced to Jackson to tell Medgar Evers and A. H. McCoy, the president of the state conference of NAACP branches. Evers assembled all the known facts for the national press. “It was clearly a political assassination,” recalled Roy Wilkins at the national office, “but the local lawmen practically pretended that nothing had happened.” In his annual report for the Mississippi state office Evers was blunt: “[Lee’s] independent business, print shop and grocery, made it difficult to squeeze him economically, so their only alternative was to kill him.”"|"The Blood of Emmett Till"|"Timothy B. Tyson"
"ap ~ 08:00"|"About eight o’clock"|"About eight o’clock on Friday night, November 25, 1955, a forty-two-year-old black woman named Savannah Luton entered Courts’s grocery store on First Street in Belzoni. “I was busy waiting on customers in my store,” Courts recalled. He greeted Luton from behind the old drink box and cash register. “I was buying a dime’s worth of coal oil and I heard this noise that sounded like firecrackers,” she said later. “I bent down to look out the window and told Mr. Courts, ‘There’s some white folks out here shooting at us.’ He didn’t even know he was shot until then.”"|"The Blood of Emmett Till"|"Timothy B. Tyson"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"Like Lee and Courts, a sixty-three-year-old African American cotton farmer named Lamar Smith decided that he would risk everything to help bring the vote to black Mississippians. About two weeks before Milam and Bryant drove to Reverend Wright’s farmhouse to take Emmett Till, Smith went to the courthouse in Brookhaven, Mississippi, to obtain more of the absentee ballots he was distributing to African Americans so that they could vote without being intimidated or attacked. It was ten o’clock on Saturday morning and the square was filled with people. At least three white men set upon the unarmed Smith as he crossed the courthouse lawn and beat him mercilessly. Then at least two of them held him while another fired a .38 revolver into his heart and, by one account, fired a second shot into his mouth. Dozens of people stood nearby. The sheriff was close enough to recognize at least one of the killers and to describe the bloodstains on the shirt of another. The FBI investigation stated flatly that his assailants killed Smith “in front of the sheriff.”"|"The Blood of Emmett Till"|"Timothy B. Tyson"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"The spectators in shirtsleeves, the sweating bottles of Coca-Cola, the roaming interracial pool of reporters, the judge’s demeanor—none of these influenced the substance of the murder trial of Roy Bryant and J. W. Milam. On Monday, September 19, the first day of the trial, selection of ten of the twelve needed jurors began promptly at nine o’clock. Sheriff Strider and Sheriff-elect Harry Dogan, who between them knew virtually everyone in the county, helped the defense lawyers vet the 125 potential jurors. That it would be an all-white jury went without saying. “No Negroes will serve on the jury,” explained the Jackson Daily News. “Women do not serve on Mississippi juries, either.”"|"The Blood of Emmett Till"|"Timothy B. Tyson"
"ap < 11:00"|"almost eleven o’clock"|"On Tuesday morning, the crowded courtroom watched attentively as the defense and prosecution set out to select the two more jurors necessary to proceed with the trial. They did not complete the process until almost eleven o’clock; the court had to call nine more prospective jurors in order to confirm the last two. The prosecution rejected six for having contributed to the defense fund of Milam and Bryant and used one of its peremptory challenges to block another. In the end nine cotton farmers, two carpenters, and an insurance salesman were selected: all men, all white. The Greenwood Morning Star described the local men as “a jury mostly composed of open-collared, sunburned farmers,” although the Memphis Commercial Appeal noted that one juror wore a necktie that first day. Judge Swango selected J. A. Shaw, one of the nine farmers, to chair the jury."|"The Blood of Emmett Till"|"Timothy B. Tyson"
12:00|noon|"This wasn’t true for the sheriff. Strider blamed all the national hullabaloo on outsiders and seemed to focus on the black press as a prime example. At the outset of each day he would walk, his blackjack protruding from his front pocket, past the table where the black press huddled and offer a cheerful “Good morning, niggers.” He interfered with their work whenever he could, reserving them only the barest minimum space, and then only at the direction of Judge Swango. “They allotted us chairs at the Jim Crow press table but during the noon recess while we were trying to get our stories filed in a Negro restaurant”—a pool hall, really—“the crowd would come in and take chairs from our table. I stood up more often than I sat down,” complained James Hicks. “We never have any trouble,” Strider told television reporters during a break, “until some of our Southern niggers go up North and the NAACP talks to them and they come back here.”"|"The Blood of Emmett Till"|"Timothy B. Tyson"
00:00|midnight|"Until he left Mississippi in late 1955, Dr. Theodore Roosevelt Mason Howard felt sure that his name topped the Citizens’ Council “death list” on which the names of his late friends George Lee and Lamar Smith had once appeared. So he kept a .357 Magnum revolver on one bedside table and a .45 semiautomatic on the other and a Thompson submachine gun at the foot of his bed. A rifle or shotgun stood in all four corners of the bedroom and in every other room in the house. His large and well-appointed home and outbuildings would be more properly called a compound; the driveway featured a guardhouse in which armed men sat twenty-four hours a day. He was not a violent man, but he intended to sleep in peace on his own property. That is why, when an African American farm worker named Frank Young showed up at the gate at midnight on the eve of the Till murder trial, the guards were reluctant to wake Howard up. But Young insisted that he had an important story to tell about Till’s murder and refused to talk with anyone but Dr. Howard."|"The Blood of Emmett Till"|"Timothy B. Tyson"
00:00|midnight|"After his midnight conversation with Young, Howard called some of his colleagues to share the new evidence. Many of the black reporters were already at the house, including Hicks, Simeon Booker, and Robert M. Ratcliffe of the Pittsburgh Courier. Howard almost certainly called Hurley, Evers, and Moore as well. All day and all night that Monday, while the court selected a jury, Howard and his crew looked for the witnesses who could confirm Young’s story and Hicks’s suspicions. The four they found agreed to come to Howard’s house the next evening to relate what they had seen. These evidential gold mines promised not only to provide eyewitness testimony linking the defendants to the murder but also to change the legal jurisdiction from Tallahatchie to Sunflower County. Such a move probably provided the best opportunity civil rights advocates had for disrupting the script of acquittals already unfolding in Sumner."|"The Blood of Emmett Till"|"Timothy B. Tyson"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"At eight o’clock Monday evening some members of the Mississippi underground conducted a strategy meeting in Mound Bayou to choose a course of action. Aside from Howard, Hurley was present, as were several African American reporters, including Hicks, Booker, and L. Alex Wilson of the Chicago Defender. They agreed that white reporters might fare better in dealing with local law enforcement officials and decided to ask John Popham of the New York Times and Clark Porteous of the Memphis Press-Scimitar to act in concert with them. All the reporters would have to agree to hold off filing any stories until after the Tuesday night meeting with the witnesses."|"The Blood of Emmett Till"|"Timothy B. Tyson"
"ap 11:15"|11:15|"It took the court well over an hour to select the two remaining jurors. After the mid-morning break, the jury was seated and District Attorney Chatham took the floor to begin his case. First he summoned these witnesses: Deputy Sheriff John Ed Cothran of Leflore County; Dr. L. B. Otken, who examined the body; C. M. Nelson, the undertaker who dispatched the body to Chicago; Deputy Sheriff Garland Melton of Tallahatchie County, who was present when the corpse was taken from the river; Chester Miller, the African American undertaker from Greenwood who initially took the body; Charles Fred Mims, who helped retrieve the body from the water; W. E. Hodges, a commercial fisherman, and his son Robert Hodges, the seventeen-year-old who initially found the body; Moses Wright; and Mamie Bradley. The defense called the same witnesses plus Roy Bryant, J. W. Milam, Carolyn Bryant, Juanita Milam, Eula Lee Bryant, and Sheriff H. C. Strider. Judge Swango called an early lunch recess at 11:15."|"The Blood of Emmett Till"|"Timothy B. Tyson"
01:00|"one in the morning"|"Sheriff Smith, who had been battling Sheriff Strider ever since Till’s body was retrieved from the Tallahatchie River, acknowledged that he had been looking for witnesses for several weeks and joined the hunt with enthusiasm. “These witnesses have a story to tell,” he said. “We’ve got to find them if it takes all night.” The teams agreed to reconvene at eight for a meeting with the witnesses. None of the expeditions went easily. Frank Young did not turn up until one in the morning and refused to talk to anyone but Howard, who was not available."|"The Blood of Emmett Till"|"Timothy B.

As Moses Wright made his way toward the front of the sweltering courtroom, quiet fell so that you could hear feet shuffling and the low whump, whump, whump of the ceiling fan. It was the third day of the trial. The authorities had brought in a hundred or so cane-bottom chairs in an effort to keep people off the windowsills and away from the faded lime-green walls. If it had been empty with a good breeze, the room would have reached ninety degrees that day; stuffed sweatbox fashion, the temperature likely reached a hundred or more. The Delta Democrat-Times called the courtroom “an oven-hot, smoke-filled room that was jammed to the walls with spectators.” The two four-blade ceiling fans seemed only to stir the cigarette smoke. Such oppressive heat discouraged movement other than the polyrhythmic batting of several dozen handheld cardboard church fans of the sort common in the South before air-conditioning."|"The Blood of Emmett Till"|"Timothy B.

Milam."|"The Blood of Emmett Till"|"Timothy B. Tyson"
"~ 14:00"|"about two that Sunday afternoon"|"Then Sheriff George Smith, at least an honorary member of that Mississippi underground that had located the new witnesses, took the stand and testified that he had found Roy Bryant sleeping at the store in Money at about two that Sunday afternoon. He’d had a long talk with Bryant in the front seat of the squad car. “I asked him why did he go down there and get that little nigger boy, and he said that he went down there and got him to let his wife see him to identify him, and then he said that she said it wasn’t the right one, and then he said that he turned him loose.”"|"The Blood of Emmett Till"|"Timothy B.

This was the most damning testimony so far, tying Milam directly to the killing of Emmett Till and showing clear evidence of murder. It also changed the place where the murder had been committed from Tallahatchie County to Sunflower County, which could have implications for jurisdiction. Buttressing Reed’s testimony were two subsequent witnesses, Mandy Bradley and Reed’s grandfather Add Reed. Both of them confirmed the eighteen-year-old’s account of that brutal morning. At 1:15 on only the second day of the trial, the state rested its case."|"The Blood of Emmett Till"|"Timothy B. Tyson"

The closing of the prosecution’s case seemed premature; at the least it left several witnesses still to be heard from. Hicks was not alone; the Mississippi underground and the black and white reporters who had helped round up the new witnesses also were surprised the others were not called. Frank Young, whose midnight visit to Dr. Howard’s place had set the underground to action, was believed to have important evidence in the case. But Young, reportedly seen outside the courthouse that morning, had disappeared. Later some would fault the prosecution for not managing the witnesses better, though it is hard to imagine that Young’s testimony would have been decisive, since Reed told essentially the same story and his grandfather and neighbor confirmed it. All five of the defense lawyers later acknowledged to an interviewer that the state had presented “sufficient evidence to convict” Milam and Bryant.

He had gone to the river at about 9:15 on August 31, he told the judge, to see the body that people claimed had belonged to Emmett Till. “Well,” he said, “it was in pretty bad shape.” The skin had “slipped on the entire body.” There was a small hole in the head and two or three serious gashes. He estimated that the body had been in the river “at least ten days, if not fifteen,” which is to say longer than the body of Till could have been in the water. He could not even swear that the corpse was that of a colored person, a point he reiterated: “At the time it was brought out of the water he was just as white as I am except for a few places.” To underscore the point he helpfully added, “If one of my own sons had been missing, I could not swear if it was my own son or not, or anyone else’s.” He had signed the death certificate, true, but he did not recall whether or not it had Till’s name on it. Strider claimed that he’d “had several reports about a negro who disappeared over there at Lambert,” but he’d gotten conflicting stories. He’d been unable to investigate further. “I have been tied up here in court.”"|"The Blood of Emmett Till"|"Timothy B. Tyson"

Judge Swango overruled the motions, maintaining that the evidence presented some questions for the jury to answer for themselves.
