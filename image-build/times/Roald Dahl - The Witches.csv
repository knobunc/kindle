Delayed Action Mouse-Maker immediately starts to vurrrk. Child starts to shrrrink. Child is starting to grow fur. Child is starting to grow tail. All is happening in prrreecisely tventy-six seconds. After tventy-six seconds, child is not a child any longer. It is a mouse!"""|"The Witches"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 09:30"|"half-past nine"|"Oh vhere have all the children gone?
Is half-past nine and as a rrrule
They're never late as this for school!'"|"The Witches"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o'clock"|"""You simmer them in frog-juice for vun hour,"" came the answer. ""But listen to me. So far I have only given you the easy part of the rrrecipe. The rrreally difficult problem is to put in something that vill have a genuine delayed action rrree-sult, something that can be eaten by children on a certain day but vhich vill not start vurrrking on them until nine o'clock the next morning vhen they arrive at school."""|"The Witches"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o'clock"|"""Of course it is,"" said The Grand High Witch. ""You can set a tventy-four-hour alarm-clock today and at exactly nine o'clock tomorrow it vill go off."""|"The Witches"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o'clock"|"""Idiots!"" shouted The Grand High Witch. ""If you are vonting a steak, you do not cook the whole cow! It is the same vith alarm-clocks. Vun clock vill make enough for a thousand children. Here is vhat you do. You set your alarm-clock to go off at nine o'clock tomorrow morning. Then you rrroast it in the oven until it is crrrisp and tender. Are you wrrriting this down?"""|"The Witches"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o'clock"|"""Excellent!"" said The Grand High Witch. ""Vhen you have mixed everything together in the mixer, you vill have a most marvellous-looking grrreen liqvid. Put vun drop, just vun titchy droplet of this liqvid into a chocolate or a sveet, and at nine o'clock the next morning the child who ate it vill turn into a mouse in tventy-six seconds! But vun vurd of vorning. Never increase the dose. Never put more than vun drrrop into each sveet or chocolate. And never give more than vun sweet or chocolate to each child. An overdose of Delayed Action Mouse-Maker vill mess up the timing of the alarm-clock and cause the child to turn into a mouse too early. A large overdose might even have an instant effect, and you vouldn't vont that, vould you? You vouldn't vont the children turning into mice rrright there in your sveet-shops. That vould give the game away. So be very carrreful! Do not overdose!"""|"The Witches"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o'clock"|"The Grand High Witch was starting to talk again. ""I am now going to prrrove to you"", she said, ""that this rrrecipe is vurrrking to perrrfection. You understand, of course, that you can set the alarm-clock to go off at any time you like. It does not have to be nine o'clock. So yesterday I am personally prrree-paring a small qvantity of the magic formula in order to give to you a public demonstration. But I am making vun small change in the rrrecipe. Before I am rrroasting the alarm-clock, I am setting it to go off, not at nine o'clock the next morning, but at half-past thrrree the next afternoon. Vhich means half-past thrrree this afternoon. And that"", she said, glancing at her wrist-watch, ""is in prrree-cisely seven minutes' time!"""|"The Witches"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 06:00"|"six o'clock"|"""Next, at six o'clock tonight, those vitches who are too old to climb trees after grrruntles' eggs vill rrree-port to my rrroom to rrree-ceive two bottles each of Mouse-Maker. My rrroom number is 454. Do not forget it."|"The Witches"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o'clock"|"""Then, at eight o'clock, all of you vill assemble in the Dining-Rrroom for supper. Vee are the lovely ladies of the RSPCC and they are setting up two long tables specially for us. But do not forget to put the cotton plugs up your noses. That Dining-Rrroom vill be full of filthy little children and vithout the nose-plugs the stink vill be unbearrrable. Apart from that, rrree-member to behave normally at all times. Is everything clear? Any questions?"""|"The Witches"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 06:00"|"six o'clock"|"""At this moment,"" I said, ""all the witches are down on the Sunshine Terrace having tea with the Manager. The Grand High Witch probably won't be back until six o'clock or just before. That's when she's going to dish out supplies of that foul formula to the ancient ones who are too old to climb trees after gruntles' eggs."""|"The Witches"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 06:00"|"six o'clock"|"""It is we ancient ones,"" said a meek voice from behind the door. ""It is six o'clock and we have come to collect the bottles that you promised us, O Your Grandness."""|"The Witches"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 08:00"|"Eight o'clock"|"My grandmother carried me back into her own bedroom and put me on the table. She set the precious bottle down beside me. ""What time are those witches having supper in the Dining Room?"" she asked.
""Eight o'clock,"" I said.
She looked at her watch. ""It is now ten-past six,"" she said. ""We've got until eight o'clock to work out our next move."" Suddenly, her eye fell upon Bruno. He was still in the banana bowl on the table. He had eaten three bananas and was now attacking a fourth. He had become immensely fat."|"The Witches"|"Roald Dahl"

""At half-past seven,"" she said, ""I shall go down to the Dining-Room for supper with you in my handbag. I shall then release you under the table together with the precious bottle and from then on you'll be on your own. You will have to work your way unseen across the Dining-Room to the door that leads into the kitchen. There will be waiters going in and out of that door all the time. You will have to choose the right moment and nip in behind one of them, but for heaven's sake be sure that you don't get trodden on or squeezed in the door."""|"The Witches"|"Roald Dahl"
