"ap < 01:00"|"nearly one o’clock"|"“Up the hill.”
“Andy, it’s nearly one o’clock.”
“You can give me twenty minutes. I’ve got things to say.”"|Catch-As-Catch-Can|"Charlotte Armstrong"
12:00|noon|"Dee herself would have been glad to pound a typewriter with somebody else’s words, but she, uprooted from her own old habits, could only flutter from library to kitchen, pretending to supervise, denying the doom of that miserable day. At noon, Clive called from the hospital."|Catch-As-Catch-Can|"Charlotte Armstrong"
"ap > 01:00"|"a little after one"|"She whirled around. By the tall clock, it was a little after one. Things for Dee to do. See about the ailing housekeeper. Talk to the doctor. And somehow do something about Pearl Dean."|Catch-As-Catch-Can|"Charlotte Armstrong"
12:00|noon|"“Yesterday, I believe, sir. Mrs. Vaughn must have made it yesterday noon.”"|Catch-As-Catch-Can|"Charlotte Armstrong"
"ap ~ 11:30"|"about eleven thirty"|"Lorraine said, quavering, “I don’t know, sir. Miss Dean came and took her away about eleven thirty, it was.”"|Catch-As-Catch-Can|"Charlotte Armstrong"
"ap 01:35"|"one thirty-five"|"She sat on the stairs. The hall clock said one thirty-five. The sun was blazing on the sand, somewhere."|Catch-As-Catch-Can|"Charlotte Armstrong"
"ap ~ 11:00"|"about eleven o’clock"|"“Yeah. I went through the kitchen about eleven o’clock on my way to take the car down and she was standing by the sink and she had a plate of it and bread and butter.”"|Catch-As-Catch-Can|"Charlotte Armstrong"
"ap ~ 11:00"|"about eleven o’clock"|"“This morning about eleven o’clock. I don’t know how much. Sidney saw her. I suppose Lorraine was with Mrs. Vaughn and she was hungry.…”"|Catch-As-Catch-Can|"Charlotte Armstrong"
00:00|Midnight|"“Yes. Yes.”
“Midnight, to be safe,” he said. “Midnight. I’ll find her.”
Dee herself began to glow. It was an illusion caused by determination. “We’ll go, right now, and find her,” Dee said."|Catch-As-Catch-Can|"Charlotte Armstrong"
"ap 01:30"|"One thirty"|"He thought he could get two or three hundred from Laila all right if he ever got up there on this damn pokey bus. One thirty already. He prided himself on having been darned nice to Laila. Clive fancied that the ladies fancied him. He was thirty. He thought of himself as tall and handsome. He thought of himself as smooth and shrewd, although a little unlucky. He had not the slightest suspicion that the inside of his sleek head was filled with the confused and childish stuff of which bad luck is made."|Catch-As-Catch-Can|"Charlotte Armstrong"
00:00|midnight|"“Now, then,” he said, “I’ve told you the facts. I’m a reputable citizen. Check with the county health office. If you can go after a criminal you can certainly pass the word and pick that girl up. I’m telling you in no uncertain terms that she has got to be in this hospital by midnight tonight. And I don’t care if you bring her in a Black Maria. Now, what are you going to do about it?”"|Catch-As-Catch-Can|"Charlotte Armstrong"
"< 00:00"|"before midnight"|"“They want her at the Greenleaf Hospital before midnight. That’s all I know.”"|Catch-As-Catch-Can|"Charlotte Armstrong"
"< 00:00"|"before midnight"|"“They want her at the Greenleaf Hospital before midnight. That’s all I know.”
“Before midnight, eh? Is there a reward or something?”
“Didn’t say.”"|Catch-As-Catch-Can|"Charlotte Armstrong"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"“We’ll go,” said Clive kindly. “I guess we can cross that bridge when we come to it.” He looked at his watch. It was two o’clock."|Catch-As-Catch-Can|"Charlotte Armstrong"
14:00|"two P.M."|"At two P.M. the blue convertible was sliding south. Dee and Andy had found out no more on that corner. Now they were doing the most sensible thing they could think to do. They were going to the Fleming house in the hope that Laila was also going there."|Catch-As-Catch-Can|"Charlotte Armstrong"
"> 15:00"|"a little after three P.M."|"And what you don’t know ain’t going to hurt you, either, he thought truculently. Hell with that pickup. It was a little after three P.M. He had ideas. He’d listened with pricked-up ears to every word he could catch between his late passengers. He hadn’t heard anything about illness or treatment. Could be it wasn’t the right girl. Could be it was, too. If so, there was a plot going on. Vince loved plots. And he knew where they had gone."|Catch-As-Catch-Can|"Charlotte Armstrong"
"ap 03:35"|"three thirty-five"|"As he let himself out of the lady’s front door, he was thinking of time. How many hours had gone by already? It was three thirty-five now. Midafternoon. If Pearl got away, and kept Laila away for the entire day tomorrow, it would probably do. He thought, if the stuff does get her, Pearl Dean will have some fun proving she didn’t know a thing about it."|Catch-As-Catch-Can|"Charlotte Armstrong"
12:00|noon|"“It couldn’t have been long ago,” said Dee. “Pearl left our house at noon.…”"|Catch-As-Catch-Can|"Charlotte Armstrong"
16:00|"four P.M."|"Andy glanced at her face. The time was four P.M. He said, grimly, “All right. We’ll take a crack at chasing her. It’s possible we can catch Pearl, at least. Which way?”"|Catch-As-Catch-Can|"Charlotte Armstrong"
"ap 04:26"|"twenty-six minutes after four"|"She faced around forward. Her hair whipped her cheek. In a very disagreeable painful way, it made sense to keep going without Andy. She meant it with all her heart, what she had said. She would find, for her love, the girl he loved. For the first time, she realized that she too was Laila’s heir. She realized Andy had thought of it. It seemed all wrong to have thought of such a thing. She thought, “I don’t know him. Nor does he know me. Nor ever shall we.” She put her bare hand in the sun, where the wind would weather it. It was twenty-six minutes after four."|Catch-As-Catch-Can|"Charlotte Armstrong"
"ap < 05:00"|"nearly five o’clock"|"She sat, massive, with her fat foot frozen on the accelerator. The car moved on, but now the noble dome of Pearl’s forehead wore a crease of stern reflection. It was nearly five o’clock. She was well out of the city. She wanted to keep the course she was on. Oh, she wanted to. Her dream of herself as the comforter, the guardian, the proxy mother was strong, but Pearl had run into some kinds of trouble before. The way of discretion rose like a rock in her path. She felt briefly resentful. She had been deceived, somehow. But there was no doubt in her mind about what she must do."|Catch-As-Catch-Can|"Charlotte Armstrong"
17:00|"five o’clock that Wednesday afternoon"|"There were eyewitnesses to what happened at the crossroads at five o’clock that Wednesday afternoon. The police, combining this testimony with a study of the skid marks later, were able to work it out quite clearly."|Catch-As-Catch-Can|"Charlotte Armstrong"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"It was just as well, she knew a moment later, that she couldn’t scream, for it wouldn’t have been becoming in a gentle old woman to scream in such a manner. She devoted herself to feeling sorry for those injured people, as sorry as only she could be, and to watching everything in sight from her position on the porch. She was glad that she had made her attendant, housekeeper, and practical nurse, Agnes Nilsson, bring her out and settle her here so early. She knew about what was scheduled to happen at seven o’clock across the street, and she had intended to enjoy that spectacle from its slightest beginnings. That was how she came to have a balcony seat for this unscheduled excitement."|Catch-As-Catch-Can|"Charlotte Armstrong"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"“Lemon Grove is the only one I’m sure of. It’s five o’clock. If we don’t catch up with them while they are still on this Lemon Grove, we’ll be sunk.”"|Catch-As-Catch-Can|"Charlotte Armstrong"
"ap 05:40"|"five forty"|"By five forty, the mess at the. crossroads was yielding to order. Some people still stood about in knots, still talking it over, but many had gone on about their business already. All the undamaged vehicles had pulled away, leaving the intersection to the wreckers, working to tear apart and tow away Pearl’s coupe, and Andy’s convertible, to haul off the Buick with the bashed bonnet The trailer, on the margin of the road, remained where it had come to rest, since it was not an obstacle to traffic."|Catch-As-Catch-Can|"Charlotte Armstrong"
"ap < 06:00"|"toward six o’clock"|"Pearl Dean and Dee, hauled off to a hospital, were hors de combat. They wouldn’t be looking for Laila for a while. Pearl Dean, he felt sure, would not live—not long. They would keep Dee; Dee was no factor. The police had no idea where to look, and Laila was hidden, and time kept passing. It was getting toward six o’clock. Getting dark. Incongruously, in the warm September weather, the sun still followed the year’s pattern and it was going down."|Catch-As-Catch-Can|"Charlotte Armstrong"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"“I don’t care.…”
“And that takes time.… We’re late. We go on the air at seven!”
“You see those wrecks, don’t you?”"|Catch-As-Catch-Can|"Charlotte Armstrong"
"ap 05:50"|"ten minutes of six"|"So he did it. Trucks and cars parked like spokes of a fan shielded him from a casual glance, as he went, fast and slippery, and hidden behind the house corner, he slipped inside. It was ten minutes of six and the light was leaving the sky."|Catch-As-Catch-Can|"Charlotte Armstrong"
"ap < 06:00"|"nearly six o’clock"|"It must be nearly six o’clock. Less than six hours to find Laila now. They couldn’t be sure of more margin than that. Stop thinking about time. Use it. Keep going. Dee put her head down and slogged along. A tentacle touched her heart as she wondered if poor Mrs. Vaughn would live."|Catch-As-Catch-Can|"Charlotte Armstrong"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"Dr. Stirling read back the name and the number, the street and the direction. “Not seven o’clock yet. Plenty of time. I’ll have that truck picked up so fast.…” And heard him sigh."|Catch-As-Catch-Can|"Charlotte Armstrong"
"ap < 07:00"|"nearly seven o’clock"|"But Frank knew now this was a dream and could not come to pass. Mike had to be told about the passenger and Frank would probably get fired. And he thought he’d better tell Mike about her pretty soon. It was getting to be nearly seven o’clock already. Time to stop and take her on a bus.…"|Catch-As-Catch-Can|"Charlotte Armstrong"
