Pick it up, put it together, nurse it through the next morning at some obscure motel, and make godamn sure no one found out what the games were or who the mess was.

That fact alone was enough to propel an agent from Brussels into a transatlantic pursuit, debts notwithstanding. A white status contact was a momentary truce; a truce generally meant that someone was about to do something drastic.

I take a great risk, pay my crew ten times their wages, but nothing is too much for a friend I admire so. You and the provocateur need only to go to the end of Pier Seven in Bastia at one o'clock this morning. My best trawler will get you to Livorno by daybreak.” “Is that its usual run?” “Naturally not. The usual port is Piombino. I pay for the extra fuel gladly, with no thought of my loss.” “That's generous of you.” “And why not? You have always been fair with me.” “And why not? You've always delivered.” Scofield reached into his pocket and took out a roll of bills. “But I'm afraid there'll be some changes. To begin with, I need two boats; one is to sail out of Bastia to the south, the other north, both staying within a -thousand yards of the coastline. Each will be met by a speedboat which win be scuttled. I'll be in one, the Russian in the other; I'll give you the signals. Once on board, he and I will both head for open water, where the two courses will be charted, the destinations known only to the captains and ourselves.” “So many complications, my friendl They are not necessary, you have my wordl” “And I'll treasure it, Silvio, but while it's locked in my heart, do as I say.” “Naturallyl” said MonteflorL swallowing. “But you must realize how this will add to my costs.” “Then they should be covered, shouldn't they?” “It gladdens me you understand.” “Oh, I do, Silvio.” The American peeled off a number of very large bills."|"The Matarese Circle"|"Robert Ludlum"

It was more than enough to get me to Genoa, where I bought clothes and a ticket on the plane to Corsica. I was in Bastia by noon the next day.” “And from there to Porto Vecchio?” “Yes. Free!” “Not exactly. God knows the prison was different, but you were still a prisoner. Those hills were your cell.” Antonia looked away. “I would have been happy there for the rest of my life. Since I was a child I loved the valley and the mountains.” “Keep the memories,” said Bray. “Dont try to go back.” She turned her head toward him. “You said one day I could! Those men must pay for what they didl You, yourself, agreed to thatl” “I said I hoped they would. Maybe they will, but let others do the work, not you.

He could not return to the rooming house several blocks away, and all his clothes except those on his back were there. In a duffle bag on the unmade bed. There was nothing else of consequence; his money as well as several dozen useful letterheads, identification cards, passports, and bank books, were all in his attach6 case. But outside of the rumpled trousers, the cheap Mackinaw jacket, and the Irish hat, he didn't have a damn thing to wear. And clothes were not merely coverings for the body, they were intrinsic to the work and had to match the work; they were tools, consistently more effective than weapons and the spoken word.

Then your moves were made by a sequence of telephone calls to the flat-my call from London was the intrusion-and with each call you gave new instructions, any deviation and the exchange was canceled. The exchange ground itself was in traffic, preferably one-way traffic, with one vehicle, one man and Antonia. Everything to take place within a time span of sixty to a hundred seconds.“ The Russian nodded. ”Noon on the Champs Elys6es, south of the Arch. Vehicle and girl taken, man and soldier bound at the elbows, thrown out at the intersection of the Place de la Concorde, and a swift, if roundabout, drive out of Paris.“ Bray put the whisky down, and walked to the hotel window overlooking Carlos Place. ”A little while ago you said you had two choices.

In a farmer's field. At night. I had no delusions of taking her into Essen and setting up a base of operations.” Scofield sat down. “The Red Brigades held Aldo Moro eight blocks away from a police headquarters in Rome. Although that's not exactly what I had in mind.” Taleniekov leaned forward. “Waverly?” “Yes.” “How? The American network is after you, the Matarese nearly trapped you; what did you have in mind? Dropping into the Foreign Office and proffering an invitation for tea?” “Waverly's to be brought here-to this room-at eight o'clock tonight.” The Russian whistled. “May I ask how you managed it?” Bray told him about Symonds. “He's doing it because be thinks whatever convinced me to work with you must be strong enough to get me an interview with Waverly.” “They have a name for me. Did he tell you?” “Yes. The Serpent.” “I suppose I should be flattered, but I'm not. I find it ugly. Does Symonds have any idea that this meeting has a hostile basis? That you suspect Waverly of being something more than England's Foreign Secretary?” “No, the reverse, in fact. When he objected, the last thing I said to him was that I might be trying to save Waverly's life.” “Very good,” said Taleniekov. “Very frightening. Assassination, like acts of terror, is a spreading commodity. They'll be alone then?” “Yes, I made a point of it. A room at the Connaught; there'd be no reason for Roger to think anything's wrong. And we know the Matarese haven't made the connection between me and the man Waverly is supposedly meeting at the MI-Six offices.” “You're certain of that? It strikes me as the weakest part of the strategy. They've got you in London, they know you have the four names from Corsica. Suddenly, from nowhere, Waverly, the consighere, is asked to meet secretly with a man at the office of a British intelligence agent known to have been a friend of Beowulf Agate. The equation seems obvious to me; why would it elude the Matarese?” “A very specific reason. They don't think I ever made contact with Symonds.” “They can't be sure you didn't.” “The odds are against it. Roger's an experienced field man; he covered himself. He was logged in at the Admiralty and later returned a blind inquiry. I wasn't picked up in the streets and we used a sterile phone. We met an hour outside of London, two changes of vehicle for me, at least four for him. No one followed.” “Impressive. Not conclusive.” “It's the best I can do. Except for a final qualification.” “Qualification7” “Yes. There isn't going to be a meeting tonight. They'll never reach this room.” “No meeting?

We can refiae the details then, coordinate signals, that kind of thing.” “Sure. That kind of thing. Where'll you go? You can stay here, if you like.” 'I think not.

You're a dead man, Senator. If they want to sacrifice you, that's their business-and yours. I suppose, but not mine.” “What the hell are you talking about? What's wrong?” “It's unacceptable. I'm not told a time and a location, I tell you and you tell them. Specifically, I give you a location and a time span, Senator. Between three and five o'clock this afternoon, at the north windows of Appleton Hall, the ones looking out over Jamaica Pond. Have you got that? Appleton Hall.” “That is the telephone number!” “You don't say. Have the windows lighted, the woman in one room, the Russian in another. I want mobility, coversation; I want to see them walking, talking, reacting. Is that clear?” “Yes. Walking... reacting.” “And, Senator, tell your people not to bother looking for me. I won't have the X-rays on me; they'll be with someone else who's been told where to send them if I'm not back at a specific bus stop by five-thirty.” “A bus stop?” “The north road below Appleton Hall is a public bus route.
