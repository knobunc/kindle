In England, Sir Charles Wheatstone and William Fothergill Cooke built detectors from magnetized needles, which would be deflected in the presence of an incoming electric current. By 1839, the Wheatstone-Cooke system was being used to send messages between railway stations in West Drayton and Paddington, a distance of 29 km. The reputation of the telegraph and its remarkable speed of communication soon spread, and nothing did more to popularize its power than the birth of Queen Victoria’s second son, Prince Alfred, at Windsor on August 6, 1844. News of the birth was telegraphed to London, and within the hour The Times was on the streets announcing the news. It credited the technology that had enabled this feat, mentioning that it was “indebted to the extraordinary power of the Electro-Magnetic Telegraph.” The following year, the telegraph gained further fame when it helped capture John Tawell, who had murdered his mistress in Slough, and who had attempted to escape by jumping on to a London-bound train. The local police telegraphed Tawell’s description to London, and he was arrested as soon as he arrived at Paddington."|"The Code Book"|"Simon Singh"

Critics had argued that because radio waves could not bend and follow the curvature of the Earth, radio communication would be limited to a hundred kilometers or so. Marconi attempted to prove them wrong by sending a message from Poldhu in Cornwall to St. John’s in Newfoundland, a distance of 3,500 km. In December 1901, for three hours each day, the Poldhu transmitter sent the letter S (dot-dot-dot) over and over again, while Marconi stood on the windy cliffs of Newfoundland trying to detect the radio waves. Day after day, he wrestled to raise aloft a giant kite, which in turn hoisted his antenna high into the air. A little after midday on December 12, Marconi detected three faint dots, the first transatlantic radio message. The explanation of Marconi’s achievement remained a mystery until 1924, when physicists discovered the ionosphere, a layer of the atmosphere whose lower boundary is about 60 km above the Earth. The ionosphere acts as a mirror, allowing radio waves to bounce off it. Radio waves also bounce off the Earth’s surface, so radio messages could effectively reach anywhere in the world after a series of reflections between the ionosphere and the Earth."|"The Code Book"|"Simon Singh"

Bletchley had more staff and resources than the Polish Biuro Szyfrów, and were thus able to cope with the larger selection of scramblers and the fact that Enigma was now ten times harder to break. Every twenty-four hours the British codebreakers went through the same routine. At midnight, German Enigma operators would change to a new day key, at which point whatever breakthroughs Bletchley had achieved the previous day could no longer be used to decipher messages. The codebreakers now had to begin the task of trying to identify the new day key. It could take several hours, but as soon as they had discovered the Enigma settings for that day, the Bletchley staff could begin to decipher the German messages that had already accumulated, revealing information that was invaluable to the war effort."|"The Code Book"|"Simon Singh"

For example, experience showed that the Germans sent a regular enciphered weather report shortly after 6 A.M. each day. So, an encrypted message intercepted at 6:05 A.M. would be almost certain to contain wetter, the German word for “weather.” The rigorous protocol used by any military organization meant that such messages were highly regimented in style, so Turing could even be confident about the location of wetter within the encrypted message. For example, experience might tell him that the first six letters of a particular ciphertext corresponded to the plaintext letters wetter.

This book was the first detailed discussion of the development of ciphers, and as such it was the perfect primer for a budding cryptographer. The Codebreakers was Hellman’s only research companion, until September 1974, when he received an unexpected phone call from Whitfield Diffie, who had just driven across the Continent to meet him. Hellman had never heard of Diffie, but grudgingly agreed to a half-hour appointment later that afternoon. By the end of the meeting, Hellman realized that Diffie was the best-informed person he had ever met. The feeling was mutual. Hellman recalls: “I’d promised my wife I’d be home to watch the kids, so he came home with me and we had dinner together. He left at around midnight. Our personalities are very different-he is much more counterculture than I am-but eventually the personality clash was very symbiotic. It was just such a breath of fresh air for me. Working in a vacuum had been really hard.”"|"The Code Book"|"Simon Singh"

Is it possible to find a one-way function that can be reversed only if the receiver has some special information? Suddenly, the mists began to clear and he had a revelation. He spent the rest of that night formalizing his idea, effectively writing a complete scientific paper before daybreak.

"ap 10:00"|10|"This is not a very high level of security, but Bob could have chosen much larger prime numbers and increased the security of his private key. For example, he could have chosen primes that are as big as 10 (this means 1 followed by 65 zeros, or one hundred thousand, million, million, million, million, million, million, million, million, million, million). This would have resulted in a value for N that would have been roughly 10 × 10, which is 10. A computer could multiply the two primes and generate N in just a second, but if Eve wanted to reverse the process and work out p and q, it would take inordinately longer. Exactly how long depends on the speed of Eve’s computer. Security expert Simson Garfinkel estimated that a 100 MHz Intel Pentium computer with 8 MB of RAM would take roughly 50 years to factor a number as big as 10. Cryptographers tend to have a paranoid streak and consider worst-case scenarios, such as a worldwide conspiracy to crack their ciphers. So, Garfinkel considered what would happen if a hundred million personal computers (the number sold in 1995) ganged up together. The result is that a number as big as 10 could be factored in about 15 seconds. Consequently, it is now generally accepted that for genuine security it is necessary to use even larger primes. For important banking transactions, N tends to be at least 10, which is ten million billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion times bigger than 10. The combined efforts of a hundred million personal computers would take more than one thousand years to crack such a cipher.
