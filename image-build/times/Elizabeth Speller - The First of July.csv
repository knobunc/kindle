Slowly, tentatively, he began to pedal, carefully at first and then, as he realized that if he went faster the machine was more inclined to stay upright, he gathered speed.

The British ultimatum had been sent and gone unanswered; at eleven o’clock this evening, there would be a formal declaration of hostilities. Politicians and military commanders were poised over their long-devised plans. Everybody knew it."|"The First of July"|"Elizabeth Speller"

A driver had dropped him in Amiens before midday, and he had only to deliver some papers and pick up a book for his colonel before the Eton dinner at 7 p.m. He had loitered, knowing what lay ahead in the next few days.

After a week of shelling, day and night, the air and the ground and the men trembling and afire: stillness. The massive mines have been detonated; he has, with a certain exultation, trapped the explosion. The moment of a landscape being altered for ever. It will be his most famous image: the convulsion of earth that looks, on film, like an elm tree in full leaf. Clouts of earth and chalk and terror are still falling, but then the barrage lifts, just like that; by coincidence, both sides ceasing fire simultaneously."|"The First of July"|"Elizabeth Speller"

Benedict was due at H.Q. at 1000 hours, and he thought he could probably get that far and have his wound dealt with properly. He got up, feeling abominably weak. There were bloodstains where he had been lying, but the bandage seemed to be dry. He needed a bath, he thought, and looked for a paper spill to light the Primus stove. He picked up some torn paper from under the discarded bottles in the long-dead cottage hearth. It seemed to have been a letter, and he could see at once that it was in Theo’s strange new handwriting. While his mind was still casting about for some justification for looking at a discarded private letter, he was already starting to read it. While the water was coming to the boil, he walked outside. What he was reading was more of a journal entry, but by a Theo who had become a stranger."|"The First of July"|"Elizabeth Speller"

He dropped to the ground, landed heavily but continued, limping slightly, through the bare garden onto the back lane and then on down between the houses, always aware that there might be a jumpy British soldier with a gun somewhere in the shadows. The town was noisy: lorries grinding their way up the main street behind the houses he was passing.

In coffins we had learned to improvise, refitting wood, and, although it was never pleasant, on some occasions also the deceased if they were of exceptional height.
