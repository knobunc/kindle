I live at 189 Broadway, the second floor. Come at … I don’t know … Come at eight.”"|"The Land of Laughs"|"Jonathan Carroll"
"ap ~ 10:00"|"Around ten o’clock"|"Around ten o’clock the doorbell rang and I got up, thinking some clown had probably torn a sink off the wall in the boys’ bathroom or thrown his roommate out the window. Living in the dormitory of a boarding school is maybe the third or fourth circle of hell. I opened the door with a halfhearted snarl ready on my lips."|"The Land of Laughs"|"Jonathan Carroll"
00:00|"twelve o’clock at night"|"I’d just stepped out of my boxer shorts when the phone rang. No one ever called me, especially not at twelve o’clock at night. The phone was on the other side of the room, so, naked, I sprang for it. Saxony let out a whoop, and unconsciously I turned and faced her. Her green panties were down around her knees, and from the look on her face, she didn’t know whether to push them down or pull them hack up."|"The Land of Laughs"|"Jonathan Carroll"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"The sky was so dark that I switched on the headlights and slowed down to forty. I had often wondered what she was like as a kid. That nice, moony-pale face in miniature. I could see her off in a dark corner of a dark living room playing with her marionettes until nine, when her mother would tell her to go to bed. White socks that were falling down, and black patent leather shoes with gold buckles."|"The Land of Laughs"|"Jonathan Carroll"
"ap 02:50"|two-fifty|"Dan scooped up some red sizzlers and put them onto an oversized yellow plate along with two dinner rolls. The grease from the ribs ran across the plate and started soaking into the rolls.
“That’ll be two-fifty, and no charge for the entertainment.”
I got two Cokes and went back to the table. A gray old woman with lined, sunken cheeks and a brown-black tooth in the front of her mouth was sitting next to Saxony and talking low and fast. I thought that was sort of odd, but Saxony listened intently to whatever the other was saying, and when I put the food down in front of her she didn’t move. A little miffed, I picked up one of the ribs. It was burning hot and I dropped it on the table. I didn’t think that I’d made that much noise, but when I looked up everyone was staring at me again. God, how I hate that. I’m the kind of person who’ll order a steak and when the waiter brings fish instead, I’ll take it just to avoid making a scene. I hate arguments in public, birthday cakes brought to you in restaurants, tripping or farting or anything out in the open that makes people stop and stare at you for the longest seconds in existence."|"The Land of Laughs"|"Jonathan Carroll"
"ap ~ 07:30"|"Around seven-thirty"|"She stood straight up, looked down the front of her overalls, and brushed off some crumbs. “Why don’t we talk about this some more, okay? Would you two like to come over to my house for dinner tonight? Around seven-thirty? Eddie told you the address and how to get there, didn’t he?”"|"The Land of Laughs"|"Jonathan Carroll"
"ap 01:00"|one|"We crossed the street and went up the walk to the house. A screen door, a natural-wood mailbox with just the name in white block letters (what incredible mail must have been in there at one time!), and a black doorbell that was as big as a checker. I pressed it and a deep chiming went off in the back of the house. A dog barked and then abruptly stopped. I looked at the floor and saw a matching brown mat that said “GO AWAY!” I nudged Saxony and pointed to it."|"The Land of Laughs"|"Jonathan Carroll"
"ap ~ 07:00"|"about seven o’clock"|"The next morning the sun sneaked into the room and on across the bed about seven o’clock. It woke me with its heat on my face. I hate to get up early when it’s not necessary, so I scrooched around and tried to find a shady spot. But Saxony had Scotch-taped herself to me during the night, so moving was hard."|"The Land of Laughs"|"Jonathan Carroll"
08:00|"eight o’clock in the morning"|"Early morning in Galen, Missouri. A few cars drove by, and I yawned. Then a little kid passed, licking an ice-cream cone and running his free hand along the top of Mrs. Fletcher’s fence. Tom Sawyer with a bright green pistachio cone. I dreamily watched him and wondered how anyone could eat ice cream at eight o’clock in the morning."|"The Land of Laughs"|"Jonathan Carroll"
"ap 02:07"|two-oh-seven|"He left and then Saxony decided to buy the Max Factor. I went to the counter to pay. While he rung it up, Mel the Druggist shook his head. “Personally, I never liked catfish. The only reason they’re always so fat is that they eat anything. Real garbage fish, you know? That will be two-oh-seven, sir.”"|"The Land of Laughs"|"Jonathan Carroll"
12:00|noon|"I got up around eight, had breakfast, and worked on the book until noon or one. Then I made up a couple of sandwiches and drove over to the hospital in time to have a leisurely lunch with Sax. That lasted until about three or four, when I went home and either did some more work if I was in the mood, or started preparing my bachelor dinner. Mrs. Fletcher offered to cook for me, but that meant having to eat with her. After dinner I would type up what I’d written that morning, then round off my day with some television or reading."|"The Land of Laughs"|"Jonathan Carroll"

00:00|midnight|"I was sitting in the kitchen at the table one night writing down some memories when the doorbell rang. I sighed and capped my pen. I had filled four sides of my long yellow paper and felt I’d only gotten started. I gaped at the pad and shook my head. “Life with Pa-Pa,” by Thomas Abbey. I got up to answer the door.
“Hi, Thomas, I’ve come to take you out on a midnight picnic.”
She was dressed all in black, ready for a commando raid."|"The Land of Laughs"|"Jonathan Carroll"
23:00|"eleven o’clock at night"|"“No, the car is all packed and you have to come with me right now. And don’t say that it’s eleven o’clock at night. That is when picnics like this get started.”"|"The Land of Laughs"|"Jonathan Carroll"
00:00|midnight|"I decided not to have an apple. She smiled. In the car’s blue darkness, her teeth were as white as the stripe on the road.
“What’s a ‘midnight picnic’?”
“You aren’t allowed to ask any questions. Sit back and enjoy the ride. You’ll see everything when we get there.”"|"The Land of Laughs"|"Jonathan Carroll"
23:00|"eleven o’clock at night"|"All alone. If something happened out there between the two of us that night, no one would ever know. There was no way Saxony would be hurt if I told a small lie about what went on in that darkness. Impossible. It was eleven o’clock at night, Anna was there and I was there and Saxony wasn’t there … and what I ended up saying was, “Yes, Anna, I love her.” Then I sighed. What the hell else could I do? Lie? Yes, I know I could have, but I didn’t. Aren’t I wonderful?"|"The Land of Laughs"|"Jonathan Carroll"
"ap 01:00"|one|"After that, until Sax came home, I spent at least part of every night at Anna’s. Either she would cook dinner (God forbid) or I would come over later and we would talk or watch television, but then inevitably we ended up in bed. Later on I would stagger out of there at one or two in the morning and drive home in my freezing car."|"The Land of Laughs"|"Jonathan Carroll"

"ap 04:10"|"ten after four"|"“Thomas?” Her voice floated into the telephone booth from another planet.

"ap 08:12"|Eight-twelve|"“It will probably be explained in the notebooks, Anna, but just how much of people’s lives did he control? I mean, does it say things like, ‘Eight-twelve Joe Smith woke up and yawned for three seconds. Then he — ’”"|"The Land of Laughs"|"Jonathan Carroll"

03:00|"three o’clock in the morning"|"How many bull sessions had I been in in my life where at three o’clock in the morning I was desperately trying to explain what life was about to a sleepy college roommate or lover? I got so caught up in all of the conflicting answers and possibilities that finally I’d end up either going to sleep or making love or being totally depressed because I realized that I didn’t know anything at all."|"The Land of Laughs"|"Jonathan Carroll"
12:00|noon|"Sausage, scrambled eggs with sour cream, fresh whole-wheat bread, and a grapefruit. I got them all out of the refrigerator and lined them up like soldiers on the Formica counter. Sax’s breakfast. By noon she would probably be gone. No more hairs in the sink, no more fights about Anna, no more Rocky and Bullwinkle on television at four in the afternoon. Christ, enough of that. I started to work on the meal like the mad chef, because I was already starting to miss her and she wasn’t even out of bed. When she came into the kitchen, she was wearing the same clothes that she’d worn the first day we met. I ended up burning three sausages."|"The Land of Laughs"|"Jonathan Carroll"

21:00|"nine at night"|"I had had enough work for one day and decided to go over to the Green Tavern for a drink. It was nine at night and the town was dead quiet. The snow was slushy in the streets, but up on the sidewalk it was still white and crunchy under your feet. A silent, nasty wind drilled through the dark. Once in a while it stopped, waited for you to come up out of your shell, and then shot back, sniggering. The telephone wires were glazed over, but when the wind gusted it shook them and the ice fell into the street in short straight pieces. By the time I got to the bar I knew I either should have stayed at home or else taken the damned car. It was that cold."|"The Land of Laughs"|"Jonathan Carroll"
"ap 11:30"|11:30|"I checked the TV Guide for late movies. Café de la Paix was on at 11:30. It was 11:25, SO I got a Coke from the icebox and some green-pepper cheese that I had bought at the market."|"The Land of Laughs"|"Jonathan Carroll"

03:30|"three-thirty in the morning"|"My eyes opened and I was wide-awake. I looked at the green glow of my watch and saw that it was three-thirty in the morning. When I click awake like that I can’t get back to sleep for a long time. I put my arms behind my head and looked into the darkness above me. The only sound was the frantic ticking of my watch and the wind blowing outside. Then there was something else. Outside. Outside in the wind and the blue-black night. I turned my head to the window. It was right there, its face and paws pressed up and squashed against the glass. Its body glowed like an unlit white candle."|"The Land of Laughs"|"Jonathan Carroll"

"ap 01:00"|one|"“No, I mean symbolically. As soon as I saw how far you had gotten, I got this idea to give you a party on the day he arrives in town in your book.

"ap 05:30"|five-thirty|"I was kidding, but her face lit up and she took both of my arms and pulled me down next to her on the couch. “Well! I guess I have to tell you the whole thing now to let you see what I have in mind. This is the way I want it, Thomas: you write the section on his arriving, all right? But you have to tell me on exactly what day you will finish it, okay? Then on the day, all of us from town will go down to the station at five-thirty and pretend that he is coming in on a train.”"|"The Land of Laughs"|"Jonathan Carroll"
"ap 05:30"|five-thirty|"“No, look, don’t say anything more. I totally understand. We’ll stay home and wait for your procession to arrive.” I smiled at her and twinked her cheek. “And I promise to be done before five-thirty on Friday.”"|"The Land of Laughs"|"Jonathan Carroll"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"I finished the scene at ten o’clock Friday morning. It was eleven and a half pages long. I brought it in to Saxony and stood in a corner of the room while she read through it. She looked up at me and gave a professional nod."|"The Land of Laughs"|"Jonathan Carroll"
"ap ~ 04:00"|"Around four o’clock"|"Around four o’clock Saxony stopped work on her newest marionette head — a bull terrier, no less — and barricaded herself in the bathroom behind her bubble bath and shampoo."|"The Land of Laughs"|"Jonathan Carroll"

"ap 05:21"|5:21|"The smell of pine and car exhaust stayed with me all the way down to the railroad crossing that I had passed hundreds of times. I looked at my watch. It was 5:21. It would take five to eight minutes to walk the street parallel to the railroad tracks all the way to the station. That would be cutting it thin, but it was exciting, and already I could feel my heart thumping hard in my chest."|"The Land of Laughs"|"Jonathan Carroll"
"ap 05:30"|5:30|"I was breathing hard and my arms pumped back and forth at my sides, pushing me forward. What would they do down there? How would they all look right at 5:30? What would … ? And then I heard it off in the distance. I stopped and my eyes blurred. There were two short hoots and then a long one. A long one that rose and stayed in the air like an eerie animal calling out to someone. I leaped off the sidewalk and into the street. The whistle blew again and I knew that it was closer, almost there, the train almost in Galen station. But passenger trains didn’t stop at Galen station anymore… . The street ended in a small circle, but I vaulted the low stone wall there and kept running. I saw the station for the first time. It was so brightly lit that you would have thought that they were filming a movie. Where had the lights come from? There were hundreds of people milling around out on the platform. I was still too far away to distinguish between any of them, but there was so much noise, voices all talking at once. Then someone yelled, “There! There!” and the voices fell away. From the blackness on the side of the station away from me, from the East, from New York and the Atlantic Ocean and Austria, a pale yellow light appeared, and when I stopped running, I saw the engine pulling into the station. I stood there and my whole body shook. The engine was so old and black, and it was puffing sparks and steam out of its stack. It lumbered in and pulled out again, hauling its gleaming silver passenger cars up parallel to the platform."|"The Land of Laughs"|"Jonathan Carroll"
"ap 05:30"|5:30|"That’s all that was really necessary, wasn’t it. Have us write a first draft that was so good that it didn’t need to be fixed or redone. Write it right up to the moment that Marshall France arrives in Galen. Go down to the train station then and see if it works, see if it comes in at 5:30 … if he comes in at 5:30. If he doesn’t, then you’ve lost nothing. If he does, all you’ve got to do is get rid of your writers, get rid of your evidence. They’re unnecessary now.
