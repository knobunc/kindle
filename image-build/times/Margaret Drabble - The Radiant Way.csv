08:00|"eight in the morning"|"Charles and Liz, naturally, did not construct the notion of a New Year’s Eve party in this spirit, as a portent, as a symbol, as a landmark in the journey of their lives. As far as Liz can
  remember the idea came upon them rather more casually, one Saturday morning in early November over breakfast. Charles and Liz rarely breakfast together, they are both far too busy: Liz often sees
  patients at eight in the morning and Charles’s working hours are wildly irregular. But at weekends, they attempt to rendezvous over the Oxford marmalade, and on this occasion had succeeded.
  Charles, eating his toast, opening his mail, had suddenly exclaimed with a parody of fury, ‘Christ, it’s the Venables again!’ ‘What have they done to you
  now?’ she had mildly enquired, looking up from a photocopy of an article on The Compulsion to Public Prayer: a study of religious neurosis in a post-Christian society which she had
  just received in her own post, and Charles had said, ‘Asked us to a New Year’s Eve party.’"|"The Radiant Way"|"Margaret Drabble"
20:22|20.22|"That was how it had been, perhaps that was where it had started, thought Liz, as she stared into past and future, before jerking herself back into the present, which now stood at 20.22. The red
  clock from the bedroom reflected in the dressing-room mirror, at an interesting, an unlikely angle. Her eyes focused upon her own image. She looked all right, she concluded, without much interest.
  She bared her teeth at herself, pointlessly. Her teeth were quite large, but there was not much she could do about that now. Her interest in cosmetics, like that of her friend Alix Bowen, was
  minimal, but, like Alix Bowen, she decided that it was after all a festive occasion, and she began at this late moment to apply a little mascara. Her mascara container, like Alix’s Fluid
  Foundation, was rarely called upon, and appeared to have dried up. She licked the curved brush, and tried again. A big black dry grainy nodule stuck itself unobligingly to her lashes. Impatiently
  she reached for a tissue and wiped it off. It left a small black smear. She licked the tissue and removed the black smear, restoring herself to her former state which had been, and still was, in
  her own view, quite satisfactory."|"The Radiant Way"|"Margaret Drabble"
20:23|20.23|"20.23. In a few minutes she would go down. She could have borrowed some mascara from her daughter Sally, but it was too late. She should have rung her mother in Northam, but it was too late.
  Seven minutes of solitude she had, and then she would descend. As she sat there, she experienced a sense of what seemed to be preternatural power. She had summoned these people up, these ghosts
  would materialize, even now they were converging upon her in their finery at her bidding, each of them willing to surrender a separate self for an evening, to eat, to drink, to talk, to exchange
  embraces, to wait for the witching hour. Soon their possible presences would become real presences, and here, under this roof, at her command, patterns would form and dissolve and form again,
  dramas would be enacted, hard and soft words exchanged, friendships formed, acquaintances renewed. The dance would be to her tune. A pity, in a way, that the dancing would be merely metaphorical:
  this was a house large enough to accommodate dancing, but their friends were not of the dancing classes, would gaze in astonishment, alarm, sophisticated horror, intellectual condemnation, at
  dancing in a private house . . . another year, perhaps, for the dancing. This year, the dying year, the social dance would suffice."|"The Radiant Way"|"Margaret Drabble"
"ap 06:30"|"half past six"|"Now Charles, he is a different case, she acknowledges. For him, weight is no longer perhaps a laughing matter. He ought to take more care. He is getting solid, even fat, and that reddish tinge
  to his face has become permanent rather than intermittent. Too many lunches, too many dinners, too many glasses of port at the club beam betrayal from Charles’s complexion, bulge from his
  shirt front. His hair is receding, too. She wonders where he is. She has not seen him since half past six, when they met in the kitchen over a salami sandwich. He was preoccupied, and spoke of
  trouble with the Home Office and a documentary on prison conditions. The fatter and balder Charles becomes, the more formidable he looks. She supposes that this is only natural. He is probably
  downstairs, knocking back a stiff gin and tonic before submitting himself to the milder offering of champagne."|"The Radiant Way"|"Margaret Drabble"

"ap 09:02"|"two minutes past nine o’clock"|"Impossible to tell, however, despite this openness, what Alix and Esther really made of Charles. They teased him, tolerated him, avoided him. Women were easily captivated by Charles, when he
  bothered to make any effort to captivate: they humbly smiled when he turned his head to pay them attention. But not Esther and Alix. They were impervious both to his charm and to his aggression:
  they had neutralized him. And so he sat there, a tame lion, drumming his fingers, while Esther and Alix and Liz his wife chattered on, about scandals and liaisons, about breaking marriages and
  delinquent children, about Ivan the terrible, about the Post-Impressionist exhibition at the Royal Academy, about the Arts Council, about the Beaubourg, about modernism in architecture, about Brian
  Bowen’s views on his reactionary boss at the Adult Education Institute, about what the word quango might be said to mean, about Kate Armstrong’s latest article on the single-parent
  family and child benefits: chatter, chatter, female chatter, unstructured, shimmering, malicious, appreciative, acute, indulgent, shifting, rapid, unpunctuated, glancing, a light bright surface
  ripple on a deeper current, and Charles sat on, biting his inner lip. ‘You don’t mean to say that this chap Edward Lazenby we keep reading about and hearing on the radio is the same
  chap as that persistent creep Teddy who used to edit Focus when we were at Cambridge?’ Esther was saying, returning to the guest list, recalling scores not settled a quarter of a
  century ago: ‘Yes, the very man, he’s a something or other in the DES, he’s a very important chap now, you ought to have a go at him,’ Liz replied, and as she spoke the
  doorbell rang, and there was the first guest, on the dot of two minutes past nine o’clock, tall, thin, grey, anxious, clutching a bunch of yellow roses, ex-priest turned analyst Joseph
  O’Toole, standing stranded on the black and white marble tiles, not knowing where to turn, how to divest himself of his coat, to whom to deliver his roses, a lost man, gazing mildly at the
  unexpected butler, waiting for the arrival of familiar Liz Headleand, who advanced upon him, took the roses, embraced him, restored him, and led him in to Charles, Alix and Esther: a quarter of an
  hour earlier she had predicted the time of his arrival accurately, to the minute, and now smiled triumphantly as she effected the introductions, a smile of complicity in which Joseph O’Toole,
  who was acutely aware of his own punctuality problem, was able with a pleasant relief to share. Here he was, safely: the party could begin."|"The Radiant Way"|"Margaret Drabble"
"ap 10:30"|"half past ten"|"By half past ten, Deirdre (Molloy) Kavanagh had parted with all her little triangles of tricoloured pastry, taken off her apron, drunk a few glasses of champagne, told several
  guests that broccoli was out of fashion, and was busily engaged in conversation with a television journalist who had just returned from making a programme for Charles in Iran. He was telling her
  about the Ayatollah, and she was telling him about her convent days. Their words fluttered between them like lubricious little doves. At Deirdre’s elbow stood the faithless Jonathan
  Headleand, who was trying to explain to his stepmother’s first husband Edgar why he’d decided, after all his protests, to follow in his father’s footsteps, while simultaneously
  trying to keep one eye on Deirdre (for whom he felt responsible) and the other on his girlfriend Kate Williams who was being harangued by a Tory backbencher about Marxist infiltration of the Open
  University. The Open University was also the subject of debate between Alix Bowen and Teddy Lazenby of the Department of Education and Science: Alix’s face was expressing a most delicate
  mixture of disbelief, disapprobation and polite attention as Teddy, somewhat indiscreetly presuming on their long, if long-interrupted, acquaintance, revealed what were clearly his own opinions on
  the inadvisability of wasting money on the education of housewives and taxi drivers. In other corners and other rooms, dozens of other topics floated gaily on the lively, slightly choppy waters,
  their pennants bobbing and fluttering in the end-of-year, the terminal breeze: the approaching steel strike, the brave new era of threatened privatization, the abuse of North Sea oil resources, the
  situation in Afghanistan, the Annan report, the prospect of a fourth television channel, the viability of Charles’s attempt to conquer the United States, the Cambridge Apostles, the disarray
  of the Labour Party, the deplorable vogue for Buck’s Fizz as a party drink, the Yorkshire Ripper, the Harrow Road murderer, the Prince of Wales. In a doorway, wedged between a
  Guardian leader writer and a Kleinian analyst, Alan Headleand and his ex-tutor Otto Werner from the LSE were debating with a fine abstraction and a noble disregard of interruption the
  question as to whether or not a television programme was a primary product or a service, and whether, by implication or extension, Charles’s production company, Global Information Network
  (Telex GIN) was allied in ideological terms with the manufacturing or the service industries: with equal commitment Esther Breuer and Jules Griffin (colleague of Liz Headleand) were discussing the
  nature of ancestral voices in schizophrenic patients and in the Homeric and Biblical epic, and the portrayal of the Holy Ghost in Anglo-Saxon manuscripts."|"The Radiant Way"|"Margaret Drabble"
23:50|"ten to midnight"|"‘Now you keep out of this,’ said Liz and Venetia simultaneously to Hargreaves, while, in another corner of the room, Deirdre Molloy lifted her voice in an Irish lament.
  ‘Mother, it’s ten to midnight!’ called Sally from the doorway, and Liz, looking around the confusion she had summoned into being, the scattered earth, the scattered people, the
  murmuring, the singing, the clustering, thought yes, this was a party, yes, this was living rather than not living, this was permitted, this was planned disorder, this was cathartic, this was
  therapeutic, this was admired misrule. ‘Piano, Aaron, piano!’ she called, and her middle stepson, with his mobile thin white clown’s face, emerged from the crowd and seated
  himself at the instrument, as Liz called to Deirdre and the butlers to fill glasses and then join the guests for a toast: Jonathan turned on the radio, the eagle-crowned clock over the marble
  mantelshelf struck, some joined hands and some did not, Aaron struck up Auld Lang Syne, Big Ben struck, some sang and some did not, voices rose straggling, pure and impure, strong and weak, tuneful
  and tuneless, there were cries and embraces. Two hundred people, solitude and self dispelled. Liz, at the magic moment, found herself unexpectedly clutching the hot hand of Ivan Warner, which
  seemed wrong but ordained: she looked for Charles, and saw that the poor man had managed to find himself in the icy palm of Lady Henrietta. Such were the random dispositions of fate. But Alix and
  Brian had found one another, and so had Otto and Caroline Werner: Esther was caught between lofty Edgar and little Pett Petrie, herself the smallest of all. Should old acquaintance be forgot, they
  sang, bravely, recklessly, tunelessly, and as the singing stopped, Ivan kissed Liz’s hand. ‘Liz,’ he said, ‘Liz, I’ve always admired your style, but this was something
  else.’"|"The Radiant Way"|"Margaret Drabble"

">> 00:00"|"long after midnight"|"Esther also left not long after midnight. Esther knew what she knew, had seen what she had seen, but like Aaron chose to say nothing. She rather thought that Charles knew what she knew, and it
  was this suspicion that prompted what was, for her, an early departure. She had planned to walk home, but accepted, on the front steps, an offer of a lift from Teddy Lazenby and his wife Delia, who
  lived in Campden Square and could easily drop her off. Esther had not seen either of them since her days at Cambridge, and listened with a connoisseur’s ear to Delia’s laments about
  time passing, times changing, the difficulties of keeping in touch. Esther, who had always been deeply bored with Delia and had no wish whatsoever to keep in touch with her, sat quietly in the
  smooth, upholstered, comfortable, large toffee-brown Volvo, which smelled of dog. She said nothing, except to give directions. She got home quickly, smoothly, easily, said good night politely, and
  went in and firmly shut the door."|"The Radiant Way"|"Margaret Drabble"
00:00|midnight|"Hints, glances, sliding words, oblique smiles, incomprehensible references. Why had she not received them earlier? Had she been too preoccupied with butlers, with introductions, with
  orchestration, with champagne? Or had the guests waited until midnight, the witching hour, before turning into swine? Pig-faced, snub-nosed, bristling broad-jowled Ivan, snouting disaster. That
  ominous expression of sympathy from pebbled-glassed Jules, who took her hand and asked her meaningfully how she was? Esther’s strange allusion to a hornet’s nest? That look of frank
  dislike and satisfaction from Antonia Haycock? That uncharacteristically and overly broad anecdote from Pett Petrie? Hilda Stark’s excessively theatrical departing conspiratorial embrace?
  That odd, bitter, comradely crack about men from Kate Armstrong? That glance of panic from her daughter Sally? All these messages had been sent forth, and she had received none of them, had
  continued to consider herself in charge, in control, the prime mover. Until, under the mirror, after many a circle and feint, after many a playful retreat and renewed approach, Ivan at last
  cornered her, and even before he opened his mouth she felt the smell of fear from herself: her pores broke open, she stood there panting slightly, her hair rising on the back of her neck in terror,
  her heated skin covered in icy sweat: ‘And when,’ asked Ivan pleasantly, ‘are you two going to make the announcement? Is it to be tonight, or do we wait?’"|"The Radiant Way"|"Margaret Drabble"

  sherry in the Westminster Suite, as she discovered that Edgar had rightly warned her that conversing with Japanese was not easy, as she ate her indifferent luncheon of Maryland chicken, as she
  listened to Professor Yamamoto speak on Spenser’s reinterpretation of Freud’s interpretation of folie à deux in the classic case of Orphan Eva and her mother, as she
  delivered her own paper, as she attempted desperately to follow the ensuing discussion, of which she could grasp only one word in ten: all through this crazy jumble of non-language and
  misunderstanding, of erudition and impenetrable obscurity, of meaningless signs and uninterpretable eye contact, the mosquitoes buzzed and nipped and drew blood. By six, at the end of the session,
  she was exhausted, demoralized. She took a taxi home. She felt herself, beneath the pricks and stings, to be growing ill. Charles had made her ill. She needed comfort, reassurance. She would ring
  Alix. She would tell Alix. She knew that in speaking to Alix her voice would find its normal level, her mind would return to its normal tuning. She could rely on Alix. But when she got back and
  dialled Alix’s number, Alix was out. Liz replaced the receiver and tried to keep calm, but she could feel panic, fever, tears approaching. Charles had gone out. To see Henrietta, to his club?
  He had left no word. She sat in her study and stared at the telephone. If I were my patient, she asked herself, would I prescribe myself a tranquillizer? Is this what people feel like when they
  request tranquillizers? She rang Esther. Esther too was out. She went back into the drawing room and poured herself a whisky and soda. She switched on the television."|"The Radiant Way"|"Margaret Drabble"

  inmates perform their Christmas entertainment. She had promised to go. They would be angry with her if she did not go. But when she got into the car at five, ready for the fifteen-mile drive across
  London, it wouldn’t start. The battery felt flat. It clicked and died on her. No life in it at all. It hadn’t been such a cold night, what had happened? She did not understand cars. She
  sat there crossly. There was absolutely no way of getting from Wandsworth to Wanley except by car, or none that did not involve at least four methods of public transport. It was not easy even by
  car. In fact, it was a ridiculous journey, and one that annoyed her regularly once a week. The car had been behaving all right the night before, when Brian had driven them back from Liz’s. It
  always behaved for Brian. She switched it on again. A faint but more hopeful splutter, this time. She switched off, quickly. She would have to get Brian. Brian wouldn’t mind being got, but he
  would laugh. Her feet were cold. Perhaps she would put on another pair of socks. But it was always so hot, in the Centre."|"The Radiant Way"|"Margaret Drabble"
"ap 08:30"|"eight thirty"|"The temperature is high in Garfield on Tuesday, 1 January 1980. Here it is party time, here also there is glitter. Alix could feel the heat at once, embodied in more than the pink and green
  balloons, the paper chains, the tinsel. Garfield, of all the institutions in which she had ever worked, was most responsive to mood, to atmosphere; it shifted and changed from day to day, from week
  to week, for it had, like the larger society of her larger imagining, its own corporate, its own embodied spirit, all the more powerful for its caging, its high barbed wire, its high walls. On some
  evenings, the place was dull, impassive, stifled, solid with boredom: on some evenings it grumbled ominously, with violence, waiting for Lights Out; on some evenings it was studious, attentive,
  solemn; and on other evenings, like this, it sang with a high, sweet, feverish erotic intensity, a claustrophobic glamour, an emotional throb. This was a sweet evening. Alix found herself embraced,
  caressed, her hand held, her hair stroked, her new striped woolly hat with its purple bobble extravagantly admired. These liberties were permitted. This was a liberal régime, the only
  régime of its kind in the country. Sometimes Alix shook off the liberties irritably, but tonight she submitted, responding to the petting, intimate, female warmth; she kissed and was kissed,
  she thanked them for their Christmas cards, she wished them a Happy New Year, she shook hands with the older women, she laughed and felt safe with her friends, she made no effort to repel their
  eager affection. (It did not always go this way: sometimes they sulked and abused her, sometimes they threatened her and one another, sometimes they would not attend class.) The wardens, Eric and
  Hannah Glover, welcomed her with more restraint but equal friendliness and introduced her to a man from the Home Office who had come to visit – well, to inspect, in effect, but the mood was
  holiday, informal, and the man from the Home Office smiled with the rest of them. There were sandwiches and cups of coffee. The half-hour’s entertainment was due to begin at eight thirty:
  some relatives, waiting now patiently in the hall, had been admitted, but were not allowed backstage to mingle. Freedom, but not too much freedom. Some of those taking part were already in costume:
  Jilly Fox was wearing what looked like an Iranian chadour, contrived from a sheet, Karen Gray was dressed up as a nurse, and Bob Saxby who taught pottery was encased in a Michelin-man spacesuit
  which he claimed was an Arctic explorer’s sleeping bag. ‘Imagine, man, trying to kip in this,’ he kept asking, to anyone who would listen, as he demonstrated the inconvenience of
  his garb. Innocent, innocent, like schoolchildren, the thieves and murderers. Toni Hutchinson stroked Alix’s arm, possessively, affectionately, wheedling out of her the story of the party of
  the night before: ‘So you wore your blue dress? And did you put your hair up? Did it stay up?’ She liked to tease Alix about her hair, which was forever wispily
  descending from its large wooden slide: Toni’s own curled neatly in angelic dyed blonde braids, and sometimes on request she had given Alix lessons in hair management, but Alix could not,
  would not learn."|"The Radiant Way"|"Margaret Drabble"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"Esther, Liz and Alix, who in Jane Austen’s day would never have met at all, met in Cambridge in 1952. Just before Christmas, when they were up for interview from their
  respective schools. Alix was applying to read English Literature, Liz to read Natural Sciences (with a view to medicine) and Esther to read Modern Languages. This should have safely prevented any
  rapport between them, but did not. There were, it is true, many awkwardnesses in their first communications, for none of them was much used to speaking to strangers, but this lack of practice was
  balanced by a strong desire on the part of all three of them to enter upon a new life in which speaking to strangers was possible. Otherwise, each had separately recognized, the future was
  circumscribed. Somehow, haltingly, over dinner in Hall (chicken, leeks and tinned spaghetti, a mixture delicious to each after years of post-war whale meat and school meals) they lurched into
  conversation, having found themselves for no good reason sitting together: Liz and Alix discovered that both came from Yorkshire, and that neither played lacrosse, nor had ever seen it being
  played, and Esther joined the discussion by volunteering that she had herself managed to avoid playing netball for the past three years on the grounds that she was too small. ‘I said I was
  unfairly handicapped, and they let me do extra Latin instead,’ she said. The fact that both Liz and Alix seemed to accept that extra Latin might be preferable to netball indicated that
  further interchange might be possible, and they continued to talk, through the fruit tart and custard, of the nature of intellectual and physical education, of matter and spirit, of Descartes
  (brought up by Esther), of T. S. Eliot (brought up by Alix) and of schizophrenia (brought up by Liz). The matter was abstract, for none of them knew anything other than abstractions, and the tone
  lofty. It was what they had expected of University, but had not hoped so soon to find. Esther, at the end of the meal, expressed her satisfaction with her new companions by inviting them to go with
  her to visit a friend already attending the college, an Old Girl of her school. They accepted with alacrity the prospect of a glimpse of the world inside, and all three of them went along dark
  portrait-hung corridors and up panelled staircases to the room of one Flora Piercy, a second year History student of considerable sophistication, who offered them a glass of wine. Had they known
  how rare such a commodity was in a woman’s college at that date, they might have been even more astonished, but in a sense, looking round Flora’s room, with its bright scatter cushions
  and Picasso prints and posters for plays at the ADC, with its invitations on the mantelpiece, with its gas fire and clutter of old shoes, with its romantic piles of what looked like lecture notes
  and essays, with its candle in a pewter stick and its wilting rose in a vase, they were beyond astonishment. The glass of wine went quickly to each head, for Alix’s family was teetotal, and
  Liz’s alcohol consumption to that date comprised perhaps three glasses of brown sherry and one (celebrating her A levels with her teacher) of Liebfraumilch: Esther seemed better connected
  with drink as with friends, but even she became confiding under the mild influence. They shared their dreams and aspirations, encouraged by the benevolent, admonitory, tutelary spirit of ample
  broad-faced Flora. ‘I would like,’ said Liz Ablewhite, after midnight, staring into the white flaming chalky cracked pitted flaring columns of the gas fire, ‘to make sense of
  things. To understand.’ By things, she meant herself. Or she thought she meant herself. ‘I would like,’ said Alix, ‘to change things.’ By things, she did not mean
  herself. Or thought she did not mean herself. ‘You reach too high,’ said Esther. ‘I wish to acquire interesting information. That is all.’"|"The Radiant Way"|"Margaret Drabble"
00:00|midnight|"They also made other friends, of course, both inside and outside their own college. Liz, like a pale convent girl too long mewed up, went wild in her first year, as she discovered the world of
  parties she had hitherto known only by reading and by hearsay: in those days, such was the imbalance between the sexes, women were much in demand as status symbols, as sleeping partners, as lovers,
  as party ballast, and Liz went out a great deal, her appearance improving dramatically as she did so. She had little money for clothes, but that did not matter; it did not even matter, much, to
  her, though sometimes she wished she had more than two dresses, one pink, one grey. She hung herself around with cheap earrings and necklaces and bangles. Her stockings were always laddered. She
  was much invited. Men accosted her on bridges, in lectures, in bookshops. She tried them all. But she never disobeyed the rules by spending a night, illicitly, out of college. Like Cinderella, she
  returned at midnight. In the mornings, in the long vacations, she worked."|"The Radiant Way"|"Margaret Drabble"
"> 00:00"|"After midnight"|"In her second year, she met Edgar Lintot. He was a conspicuous high-profiled figure, in those days, a medical student and a man of the theatre, famed for his Footlights appearances and his
  impromptu wit. Liz also dabbled with acting, and played several roles rather well – an inventive Helena in A Midsummer Night’s Dream and a curiously haunting, poignant Bellario
  in Philaster, directed by Edgar. Wounded loyalty and dignified pathos were her line on stage, although off-stage she grew increasingly self-assertive. Her social world, in Cambridge, was
  largely theatrical. After midnight, in college, she would discuss it with Alix and Esther."|"The Radiant Way"|"Margaret Drabble"

"ap < 04:00"|"nearly four"|"Her mind returns to Mrs Hood. The case of Mrs Hood interests her, for obvious reasons. Mrs Hood, as far as Liz can tell, never fantasized about her real father. Had no interest in her real
  father, until she was adult, and then her interest was only academic, it seemed. Mrs Hood admits that she had always imagined herself to be the offspring of a woman alone. Her real mother had
  preoccupied her, haunted her, exercised her imagination, woven herself into her most infantile dreams. With Liz herself, it had been otherwise. The real mother had been there, solidly absent, a
  constant and insoluble distress, a damaged being, a victim, a mystery. Too painful, too inexplicable to contemplate. So Liz, as a child, had contemplated her missing father instead. She could not
  remember him at all, although she must have been nearly four when he vanished. She had been free to invent. She had invented wonders. Wealth, gold braid, uniforms, power, magnificence. A commander.
  When the War was over, he would return gloriously, he would rescue his daughter Elizabeth (but probably not Shirley) and remove her to a fitting place, which, in her imagination, somewhat resembled
  the Alhambra Cinema on Jubilee Road. Marble and red carpet with a minaret. Her mother would at this point die, conveniently. Maybe her mother would be revealed, after her convenient death, to have
  been a princess in disguise, under a spell, bewitched. Or maybe she would be revealed not to have been Liz’s mother at all, but a serving maid, charged with the care of the royal baby by a
  wicked thief. Anyway, she would die, and Elizabeth would be free. Lady Elizabeth, Princess Elizabeth, her adoring subjects would cry, as they reached out to touch her hem and be healed."|"The Radiant Way"|"Margaret Drabble"

  Dupont in Detroit, Sir William Salmon in Washington, Dickie Fisher in Bogotá (where his reliable secretary reliably informed him it was also GMT 6 p.m.) and then he dismissed his secretary
  to fetch him a cup of coffee and rang Henrietta Latchett in London, hoping to catch her before she went out to whichever party she had chosen to grace that evening. She was in the bath, she told
  him, getting ready to go to the Venables’. He commiserated. And how was the ball the night before, he asked her. Too too too, she said. Really too. She fluted, to amuse. What did He
  talk about? enquired Charles. Reindeer and elk, said Henrietta. He’s the wildlife one, you know. Well, they have to take up something, poor things, said Charles. Moose, fluted Henrietta. He
  spoke of moose. Henrietta turned on the hot tap, and held the telephone receiver intimately for a moment to the sound of running water. I’ll speak to you tomorrow, I’ll see you next
  week, she said. She forgot to ask him how he was or what he was doing, but he didn’t notice. She lay in her hot bath. Charles rang Bill Ryan in Toronto."|"The Radiant Way"|"Margaret Drabble"

  rubber, or is it still there, hanging, haunting, burning rubber, the wrong engine note? Stephen is less rapid, more enigmatic, more tentative, but he too gathers speed under Liz’s
  acceleration, and Alix sits back and listens to them run along together: they speak of Freud and Little Hans and fear of horses, they speak of Plato’s metaphor of the harnessed horses of the
  self. It is going so well, this modest supper party, that Alix is simultaneously exhilarated, exhausted, jealous, delighted. It is one in the morning, it is time for bed, but they still gallop
  along, in step, Liz and Stephen. Well, it is done, they will have to arrange the next outing themselves, thinks Alix. She wonders if Brian is annoyed. She has never quite known what Brian thinks of

  breathlessness. Luckily there are not many stairs in New York. He has taken up jogging, and jogs round the upper West Side at seven in the morning. Diet, luckily, is a fashionable topic, and he
  cuts out (well, almost cuts out) butter, salt, milk, eggs, fat: he is told to eat raw fish. Raw fish is fashionable. He thinks he is enjoying his work, his new importance, his power, his eminence:

  waste: warmth, life, light. Projects of thrift do not attract Liz Headleand, as they attract, in different ways, her friends Alix and Esther. She does not wish to turn back, to cut back, to live in
  a reduced style as a divorced woman, although she has in her time bracingly recommended this course to others. She wishes to keep the lights on. She feels justified in this, up to a point. And it
  is not only the comfort that she needs, though that is a part of it. She is afraid that if she takes a step back, all her worldly riches will crumble, like Cinderella’s at midnight, and that
  she will find herself once more polishing the boots. Well, of course she is afraid of this, we are all afraid of this, if we have any imagination. But she is more afraid of this than most. She
  knows she is not the true princess, but only a fake princess, a scullery maid dressed up by a Cambridge scholarship and her own wits, and rescued by a dubious prince. Henrietta Latchett is the true
  princess. Blue blood flows in her veins. It is embarrassing to have to admit this, but Liz Headleand, who knows she should know better, has taken to trying to work out Henrietta Latchett’s

"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"Liz regretted her acceptance of Ivan Warner’s invitation to lunch. Lunching was usually a mistake: seeing Ivan was almost invariably a mistake. Ivan always had lunch: it
  was his job. Liz had no wish whatsoever to see Ivan, or to eat lunch. Nevertheless, here she found herself, at one o’clock on a weekday in Soho in late spring, settling herself on to a
  comfortable upholstered banquette, shaking out a large thick well-ironed dark-pink damask napkin, smiling politely, professing herself delighted to see Ivan, and allowing herself to order a Campari
  and soda. It arrived, clinking, misted, in a long-stemmed tulip glass, with a slice of orange. How had it happened? How had he managed it? She gazed at his unattractive, malevolent, highly
  coloured, smug face with curiosity. It was almost as though Ivan had some power of blackmail over her, over all those he held in thrall: but what could the secret be, when she could think of
  nothing dishonourable that he could know of her, when she knew so many dishonourable things of him? And why was it that she felt, in his company, a sense of illicit, uncomfortable pleasure, a sense
  of slightly corrupt collusion? Was the very fact of her presence, here, in this restaurant, a shared crime, did he know her distaste, her reluctance, was it because of her distaste, her reluctance,
  that he continued to press her, continued to seek her out? Or could it be that she actually wanted to be cross-questioned by Ivan Warner about her divorce proceedings, about how Charles
  was getting on in New York, about Henrietta Latchett, about the children’s response to Charles’s move? She had observed in some of her patients a guilty pleasure in surrender of
  secrets: was Ivan Warner her analyst, her therapist, her confessor? Thoughtfully, she sipped her cold bitter drink: thoughtfully, she smiled at Ivan. She had not seen him for months. Not since the
  New Year’s Eve party. There was a lot of gossip to catch up on."|"The Radiant Way"|"Margaret Drabble"

  said Ivan. She smiled more warmly. The waiter hovered, and Ivan waved him away, which caused Liz to glance surreptitiously at her watch: she had to be back by three thirty, she could tell already
  that he would try to make her late. A battle of wills. ‘Well?’ said Ivan. ‘Well?’ said Liz."|"The Radiant Way"|"Margaret Drabble"
"ap 03:30"|"three thirty"|"Ivan would not relinquish the Horror so readily. He wanted (perhaps genuinely?) to know her views: were the attacks racist as well as sexist, was it an accident that most of the victims had been
  black, what was the significance, psychologically, of the severed-head motif, was the attacker mad, and what did Liz mean by mad? Liz responded at first vaguely by saying that perhaps after all
  Esther Breuer ought to give up walking along the Harrow Road by herself late at night, but then attached herself more generously to the subject of madness and psychopathology in general and to the
  history of the McNaghten Rules in particular. Liz and her ex-husband Edgar Lintot share the view, as Liz now explained to Ivan, that not much is gained by the use of the word ‘mad’ to
  describe deviations from the norm as wide as that of Virginia Woolf, her unfortunate cousin J. K. Stephen (also, oddly, a candidate for the role of Jack the Ripper), and the supposed Horror of
  Harrow Road, but that does not mean that the rejection of the term implies that the Jack the Rippers of this world are not suffering from diminished responsibility by reason of insanity: insane
  they are, responsible they are not, and let us forget the emotive word ‘madness’ in this context. But, argued Ivan, did that mean that she and Edgar thought all murderers were
  insane and of diminished responsibility? Liz prevaricated slightly, for in fact she and Edgar are, in a sense, of this opinion, but in a sense that would need careful presentation to a layman, and
  she did not wish to see herself quoted in the press on the topic: but Ivan, to do him justice where one could, was not a man for hanging and flogging, for interminable prison sentences and short
  sharp shocks, and the severed-head business had suggested to him as strongly as it had to Liz and Edgar that the Horror of Harrow Road was probably not quite in his right mind. ‘Not that that
  makes it any nicer for the corpse,’ said Ivan, as Liz glanced again, this time ostentatiously, at her watch. ‘Ivan, I must go,’ she said, ‘I’ve got a consultation at
  three thirty, and I can’t be late.’ He rose to his feet, escorted her to the door, saw her on to the shabby, sunlit, sex-postered street: ‘It’s been a delight to see you,
  Liz,’ he said, ‘as ever’ – taking her hand, squeezing it, reaching up slightly to kiss her cheek – ‘it’s a pity we didn’t have more time, I wanted to
  ask you where you’re going to live when you’ve got rid of that great gloomy house of yours. Such a dark, depressing, lumpen-bourgeois street, I’ve always thought, haven’t
  you? You must be so glad to be able to get away at last – do keep in touch, let me know what’s happening, won’t you? You know I like to be in the know.’ And she walked

  white embroidered cloth and painted bowls and plates, huge cushions lay in heaps in a corner, there were two comfortable chairs covered (Alix recognized the material) with the old velveteen

  Hattersley, when consulted, had complicated the issue by talking about the winter solstice. Esther, who knew about iconography and saints, had failed to answer her telephone, and Alix had been

  bookshelves and desks and mantelpieces and stairs, and the washing-up machine ground its way through load after load to no visible effect. The domestic infrastructure could not support its extra
  burden and Liz, accustomed moreover to three days a week of well-paid skilled domestic help from an energetic young Polish woman, was overwhelmed by the mess, by the indifference of others to that
  mess. All the younger Headleands were assembled: Jonathan from Bury St Edmunds, with his girlfriend: Aaron from Highbury: Alan from Manchester: Sally and Stella, both of whom still officially lived
  at home with Liz. They sprawled on settees and bickered in corridors. And there was Charles, traitor Charles, sitting snoring in an armchair, full of turkey and brandy butter and Christmas pudding.
  Enjoy the peace while it lasts, Liz told herself, as she took cover in a corner behind The Times, as the dark evening thickened. She stroked her cat, also full of turkey, for comfort. The
  cat sneezed and coughed. Soon, at six, she would ring Alix, up in Leeds: poor Alix, her Christmas ruined by Brian’s father’s funeral, or rather with Brian’s inability to organize
  a funeral. It hung over them, and Brian’s father lay in the hospital morgue. For years, now, she and Alix had spoken to one another, on Christmas Day at six: it was a tradition. They had not

  Shirley. ‘But I spoke to her this morning,’ Liz began, defensively, in response to Shirley’s opening phrase, ‘It’s mother’: and then, in the ensuing silence,
  quickly replayed, re-read that phrase, that intonation, and for one wild glorious moment hoped that her mother was dead. ‘What is it?’ she asked, as Shirley said nothing.

  she, Liz Headleand, was still alive. Her forehead had turned cold and damp. Clammy. She was beginning to feel hungry. The organism, the machine, was beginning, despite all, to restore itself. She
  rang room service and ordered an omelette and chips and half a bottle of Beaujolais. Propped up, alone, in her white five-year-old nightdress, she studied the unsatisfactory nature of knowledge.
  The anti-climactic nature of knowledge. So this was it. A night of bad dreams, a day of sweat, then a desire for omelette and chips. Already she was losing interest in the riddle that had teased
  her for decades. Tomorrow she would go and stuff that old rubbish in the Ideal Boiler and put a match to it. Why bother Shirley with these shabby little speculations? Let them go up in smoke:
  guesses, suspicions, half-truths, the Royal Family, Stocklinch Hall, Miss Featherstone’s credentials, Dr Alethea Ward, and those pitiable paedophiles. She would remember no more. She would no
