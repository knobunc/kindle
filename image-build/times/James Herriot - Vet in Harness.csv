01:00|"one a.m."|"It had started with the aggressive shrilling of the bedside phone at one a.m. And it was Sunday morning, a not unusual time for some farmers after a late Saturday night to have a look round their stock and decide to send for the vet."|"Vet in Harness"|"James Herriot"
04:00|"four o’clock in the mornin’"|"“Well, every Saturday night and every market night he’s up roarin’ and sin~ till four o’clock in the mornin’.’"|"Vet in Harness"|"James Herriot"
04:00|"four o’clock in the morning"|"I stopped, wound the window down and listened in wonder. It was incredible how the noise reverberated around the quiet street and if it went on till four o’clock in the morning as the neighbours said, then they had my sympathy."|"Vet in Harness"|"James Herriot"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"But a realisation of my blessings began to return when I slid into bed and He!en, instead of shrinking away from me as it would have been natural to do, deliberately draped her feet and legs over the human ice block that was her husband. The bliss was unbelievable. It was worth getting out just to come back I glanced at the luminous dial of the alarm clock. It was three o’clock and as the Warmth flowed over me and I drifted away, my mind went back to the ewe and lambs, snug in their scented barn. They would be asleep now, I would soon asleep, everybody would be asleep."|"Vet in Harness"|"James Herriot"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"Anyway, whatever the cause, the undeniable fact remained that Percy was under siege, and as the word got around the pack increased, being augmented by several of the nearby farm dogs, a Great Dane who had made the journey from Houlton, and Magnus, the little dachschund from the Drovers’ Arms. The queue started forming almost at first light and by ten o’clock there would be a milling throng almost blocking the street. Apart from the regulars the odd canine visitor passing through would join the company, and no matter what his breed or size he was readily accepted into the club, adding one more to the assortment of stupid expressions, lolling tongues and waving tails; because, motley crew though they were, they were all happily united in the roisterous, bawdy camaraderie of lust."|"Vet in Harness"|"James Herriot"
12:00|midday|"And when I went into the kitchen I knew what I would find; the inevitable tray. It was always a tray with Mrs Dalby. The hospitable Dales people were continually asking me in for some kind of refreshment - a ‘bit o’ dinner’ perhaps, but if it wasn’t midday there was usually a mug of tea and a scone or a hunk of thick-crusted apple pie - but Mrs Dalby invariably set out a special tray. And there it was today with a clean cloth and the best china cup and saucer and side plates with sliced buttered scones and iced cakes and malt bread and biscuits. It was on its own table away from the big kitchen table."|"Vet in Harness"|"James Herriot"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"On market days the pubs stayed open from ten o’clock till five and Joe was one of the now extinct breed who took their chance to drink themselves almost insensible. The modern farmer may have a few drinks on market day but the old reckless intake is rare now."|"Vet in Harness"|"James Herriot"

"ap 10:00"|ten|"“Aye, that’s all very fine, but it’s a big expense. It’s ten bob every time you fellers walk on to ma place and that’s before you start. There’s all “‘medicines and everything on top.’"|"Vet in Harness"|"James Herriot"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"“Let’s see.’ I ran my fingers through my hair. “Perhaps you could wait till tonight and see if she recovers and if she isn’t right by say, eight o’clock you could let me know and I’d come out.’"|"Vet in Harness"|"James Herriot"
"ap ~ 03:00"|"around three o’clock"|"“Mr Biggins,’ I said. “I’ve got to be on my way. I have a lot of calls and one of them is within a mile of your farm, so I shall see your cow around three o’clock.’ I stood up to indicate that the interview was over."|"Vet in Harness"|"James Herriot"
"~ 07:00"|"around 7 a.m."|"The trouble was that in those days there were very few telephones on the farms and many of the farmers used to cycle in to the surgery when they wanted the vet; and of course farmers are inclined to rise rather early, a lot of them seemed to think that around 7 a.m. was a good time."|"Vet in Harness"|"James Herriot"
03:00|"3 a.m."|"There was Mr Coates last week. He had got me out of bed at 3 a.m. to a farrowing and when I stumbled, eyes half closed, from the car he was standing outside the piggery holding a lamp."|"Vet in Harness"|"James Herriot"
03:00|"three o’clock in the morning"|"I stared at the man. “In bed? Where the heck do you think I’d be at three o’clock in the morning?’"|"Vet in Harness"|"James Herriot"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"But the man who most blatantly ignored my nutritional requirements and actually seemed to be trying to sabotage them was Mr Grainger of Beckton. He was a fierce man in his sixties and he called to see me every Saturday evening at six o’clock. What made this particularly wearing was that Helen chose each Saturday to put on a sumptuous high tea. Maybe she wanted to remind me of my Scottish upbringing but she used to set before me things like herrings in oatmeal with mustard sauce or sole and chips or ham and eggs and fill in the spaces on the table with new-baked scones, pancakes, curd tarts, cherry cakes."|"Vet in Harness"|"James Herriot"
"ap < 08:00"|"nearly eight o’clock"|"I ran a hand through my hair. “Wait a minute. Surely it isn’t worth going about forty miles in weather like this. We’ll never get over Bowes Moor you know - in fact I heard yesterday it was blocked. Anyway, it’s nearly eight o’clock - we’d be too late.’"|"Vet in Harness"|"James Herriot"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"I followed this policy through Brough and along the lower road where the going was easier until I climbed out with a feeling of disbelief in the yard of the Pemberton Arms. It was nine o’clock."|"Vet in Harness"|"James Herriot"
"ap ~ 03:00"|"about three o’clock"|"The climax came about three o’clock one morning. As I lifted the bedside phone Mr Flaxton’s voice, with a tremor in it, came over the line."|"Vet in Harness"|"James Herriot"
"~ 16:00"|"about four o’clock in the afternoon"|"Next morning Penny was still stretched peacefully on her side and when, about four o’clock in the afternoon, she showed signs of awakening I repeated the injection."|"Vet in Harness"|"James Herriot"
06:00|"6 a.m."|"It was when I was torn from my bed one morning at 6 a.m. to attend a calving heifer at old Mr Homer’s small farm and when I got there I found there was no malpresentation of the calf but that it was simply too big. I don’t like a lot of pulling but the heifer, lying on her bed of straw, was obviously in need of assistance. Every few seconds she strained to the utmost and a pair of feet came into view momentarily then disappeared as she relaxed."|"Vet in Harness"|"James Herriot"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"“Splendid! The next match is on Tuesday evening - against Hedwick. I am playing so I’ll pick you up at six o’clock. His face radiated happiness as though I had done him the greatest favour."|"Vet in Harness"|"James Herriot"
"ap 06:06"|"six after six"|"But meanwhile I couldn’t help responding to the gallant fight Rainby were putting up. As the match went on I found we had some stalwarts in our ranks. Bert Chapman the council roadman and an old acquaintance of mine strode out with his ever present wide grin splitting his brick-red face and began to hoist the ball all over the field. At the other end Maurice Briggs the blacksmith, sleeves rolled high over his mighty biceps and the ,bat looking like a Woolworths toy in his huge hands, clouted six after six, showing a marked preference for the ravine where there now lurked some hapless member of the other team. I felt for him, whoever it was down there; the sun had gone behind the hills and the light was fading and it must have been desperately gloomy in those humid depths."|"Vet in Harness"|"James Herriot"
"ap 09:30"|"half past nine"|"“Well that’s great.’ I looked at my watch. “It’s half past nine now, I’ll get Siegfried to take over my morning round and I’ll see you before eleven.’"|"Vet in Harness"|"James Herriot"

23:00|"11 p.m."|"The clock tower showed 11 p.m. as I rolled through the market place and, turning into Trengate, I saw that the light had been turned off in our room. Helen had gone to bed. I drove round the yard at the back, put away the car and walked down the long garden. It was the end to every day, this walk; sometimes stumbling over frozen snow but tonight moving easily through the summer darkness under the branches of the apple trees to where the house stood tall and silent against the stars."|"Vet in Harness"|"James Herriot"
"ap 05:00"|"Five o’clock"|"I could hardly believe it when Siegfried rose, threw back the curtains, and the grey light of morning streamed in. I got up and stood beside him as he looked at his watch.
“Five o’clock, James,’ he said, and smiled. “We’ve done it again.’
He opened the french window and we stepped into the hushed stillness of the garden. I was taking grateful gulps of the sweet air when a single bird call broke the silence."|"Vet in Harness"|"James Herriot"

"ap 05:00"|"Five o’clock"|"Ever since then I have wondered … Five o’clock saw me hurrying into the smaliholding belonging to the Misses Dunn.

"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"Tensely I assessed my position. The next and final visit was only a couple of miles away - I could make it in ten minutes.

"ap 06:45"|"Quarter to seven"|"“Quarter to seven!’ I panted happily as I jumped into the driving seat. “I’ll get there in time now.’ I could see Helen and me standing on the Hodgson’s step and the door opening and the heavenly scent of the spareribs and onions drifting out from the kitchen."|"Vet in Harness"|"James Herriot"
