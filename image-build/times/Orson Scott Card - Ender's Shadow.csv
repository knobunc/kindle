While Nikolai helped Bean get into his suit, Wiggin had the rest of them lie down on the mats and do relaxation exercises. Bean even had time to lie down for a couple of minutes before Wiggin had them get up. 0656. Four minutes to get to the battleroom. He was cutting it pretty fine."|"Ender's Shadow"|"Orson Scott Card"
"ap 07:45"|0745|"Bean and Nikolai were already eating breakfast when Crazy Tom came to their table. “Ender says instead of fifteen minutes for breakfast, we have till 0745. And he’ll let us out of practice in time to shower.”"|"Ender's Shadow"|"Orson Scott Card"
"ap 07:45"|0745|"“Ender tells us we’ve got fifteen minutes to eat, which feels rushed and we don’t like it. Then right away he sends around the toon leaders, telling us we have till 0745. That’s only ten minutes longer, but now it feels like forever. And a shower—we’re supposed to be able to shower right after the game, but now we’re grateful.”"|"Ender's Shadow"|"Orson Scott Card"

They backed off even more, and some of them peeled away and disappeared up ladder-ways or down poles."|"Ender's Shadow"|"Orson Scott Card"
12:00|midday|"Bean was still flushed with victory when, after breakfast, he made his way to Rabbit barracks in order to meet his soldiers officially for the first time. Rabbit was on a midday practice schedule, so he only had about half an hour between breakfast and the first classes of the morning. Yesterday, when he talked to Itú, his mind had been on other things, with only the most cursory attention to what was going on inside Rabbit barracks. But now he realized that, unlike Dragon Army, the soldiers in Rabbit were all of the regular age. Not one was even close to Bean’s height. He looked like somebody’s doll, and worse, he felt like that too, walking down the corridor between the bunks, seeing all these huge boys—and a couple of girls—looking down at him."|"Ender's Shadow"|"Orson Scott Card"

All naked, but carrying the recording equipment. They even tested it, to make sure it had picked up Achilles’ confession. He heard his own voice, strong and unwavering. Proud of what he’d done. That would prove to the weaklings that he was “insane.” They would keep him alive. Until the universe bent things to his will yet again, and set him free to reign with blood and horror on Earth. Since they hadn’t let him see their faces, he’d have no choice. When all the power was in his hands, he’d have to kill everyone who was in Battle School at this time. That would be a good idea, anyway. Since all the brilliant military minds of the age had been assembled here at one time or another, it was obvious that in order to rule safely, Achilles would have to get rid of everyone whose name had ever been on a Battle School roster. Then there’d be no rivals. And he’d keep testing children as long as he lived, finding any with the slightest spark of military talent. Herod understood how you stay in power."|"Ender's Shadow"|"Orson Scott Card"
