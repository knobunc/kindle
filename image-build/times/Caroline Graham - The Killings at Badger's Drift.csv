21:00|"nine p.m."|"‘No. I looked specially.’
‘Then surely that simply indicates that she died before nine p.m.’
‘No she didn’t. Died in the night. The doctor said.’"|"The Killings at Badger's Drift"|"Caroline Graham"
"ap ~ 02:00"|"about two o’clock"|"‘Saw her bringing Benjy back from his walk about two o’clock. And before you ask, they both looked as fit as fleas.’  She looked around the room in a lost yet hopeful manner, as the newly bereft sometimes do. Unable to accept the empty space, half expecting the dead person to reappear. ‘No’ - she focused her gaze firmly on the inspector, ‘something happened after she saw the orchid and before she returned to the village, to put the discovery out of her mind. And it must have been a pretty big something, believe you me.’"|"The Killings at Badger's Drift"|"Caroline Graham"
19:00|"seven p.m."|"There was no joy from the Samaritans. Barnaby had not expected that there would be. Clam tight as usual. Which was why after a second, later telephone call he presented himself at their tiny terraced house behind Woolworth’s at seven p.m. looking worried."|"The Killings at Badger's Drift"|"Caroline Graham"
"~ 15:00"|"about three that evening"|"‘Of course not.’ She glanced at the slightly open door. Barnaby sat patiently, guessing that in a moment she would recall the helpful gesture with which the Samaritan at the desk had introduced them. Her face cleared. She said, ‘I do remember Miss Simpson’s call. We only had about three that evening . . . but not word for word.’"|"The Killings at Badger's Drift"|"Caroline Graham"
"ap < 09:00"|"almost nine o’clock"|"It was almost nine o’clock. Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby sat at the dining-room table facing a plateful of leathery  strips, black and shiny as liquorice, surrounded by coils of yellowish green paste."|"The Killings at Badger's Drift"|"Caroline Graham"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"Barnaby had turned up, at Doctor Lessiter’s suggestion, at eleven the following morning. He entered the consulting room to find the doctor seated behind his desk and as busy as a bee. All through their conversation his fingers were never still: fiddling with pencils, tidying a stack of pharmaceutical literature, pulling down his cuffs or just drumming away on his blotter. He glanced quickly at the chief inspector’s warrant card."|"The Killings at Badger's Drift"|"Caroline Graham"
"ap 03:00"|three|"‘Mm. I’ve got a hospital call at three, though, so we’d have to go straight away.’"|"The Killings at Badger's Drift"|"Caroline Graham"
"< 12:00"|"shortly before noon"|"It came back Thursday morning. Barnaby rang Doctor Bullard who turned up shortly before noon. He read the report. Barnaby watched his face with some amusement. It was, as they say, a picture. Bullard laid the report down."|"The Killings at Badger's Drift"|"Caroline Graham"
"ap ~ 02:00"|"around two o’clock"|"‘Doesn’t really matter now, does it?’ She turned away. ‘See you around two o’clock then?’"|"The Killings at Badger's Drift"|"Caroline Graham"
"ap < 09:00"|"nearly nine o’clock"|"They walked there, arms entwined, leaving her blouse and brassiere on the typewriter. They lay on the settee facing the mirror and a net-curtained window looking on to the street. When she was quite naked Alan threatened to pull the nets back. This, which should have alarmed her, made her even more excited. He seemed to know exactly what he was doing. It hardly hurt at all, not like people said it did, it just seemed to be over so quickly. She wanted more and he gave her more. After an hour someone knocked at the outer door and he smiled, touching her lips with his finger. She was sitting straddled across his knees and saw a girl in a white tennis dress, her long hair tied back with a scarf, walk past the window. It was nearly nine o’clock when they finally left."|"The Killings at Badger's Drift"|"Caroline Graham"
14:00|"two p.m."|"‘Well of course that would be very handy, but life is rarely so obliging. I think it would be best at this stage if you take the time in one block, from two p.m. to midnight.

"ap < 06:00"|"nearly six"|"‘No. It was nearly six by then. I don’t have to clock on and  off, you know. I’m not a hired hand.’ He strove to sound amused but there was a flick of temper in his voice."|"The Killings at Badger's Drift"|"Caroline Graham"
"ap 04:30"|"half-past four"|"‘Let’s see’ - she tapped her top lip with a tallow-coloured finger - ‘I was almost the last to go . . . it must have been half-past four . . . quarter to five.’"|"The Killings at Badger's Drift"|"Caroline Graham"

She comes about ten o’clock. Does the general cleaning, prepares any vegetables for dinner, cooks a light lunch, then goes about three. I cook in the evening and she will clear away and wash up when she comes the next day. I do hope Katherine will keep her on. She brings her little girl and not everyone will accept children. Oddly enough we shared her with poor Miss Simpson. She went there for an hour each morning before she came to us . . .’"|"The Killings at Badger's Drift"|"Caroline Graham"
"ap < 04:00"|"A few minutes before four o’clock"|"‘Did you happen to notice what time Miss Lacey left?’
‘A few minutes before four o’clock.’
‘Are you sure?’ Foolish question. He already felt he was in the presence of something oracular rather than merely  observant.

"ap ~ 04:45"|"around quarter to five"|"‘At work all afternoon, which my partner will confirm, left around quarter to five, drove straight home and stayed there.’"|"The Killings at Badger's Drift"|"Caroline Graham"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"‘Is it?’ Barnaby looked at the circle severely and shook his head. ‘I don’t know what the world’s coming to and that’s a fact. By four o’clock if that’s all right with you.’"|"The Killings at Badger's Drift"|"Caroline Graham"
"ap 01:00"|one|"Behind the house was a small concrete yard, many more nettles, a water butt greenly stagnant with a thick crust of slime and three black plastic bags suppurating with rubbish. There were also two small windows, the panes filmed with dust. Barnaby rubbed at one and peered through."|"The Killings at Badger's Drift"|"Caroline Graham"
"ap 03:30"|"half-past three"|"‘Mm. Katherine Lacey was seen in the village during the evening she said she didn’t go out. Judy Lessiter said she was at work all afternoon and was seen in the village shop at half-past three. Trevor Lessiter said he was at home watching cricket . . . “superb bowling” . . . and the match was cancelled. And Phyllis Cadell went rigid with fright when she saw us, then tried to cover it by some silly story about her road tax.’"|"The Killings at Badger's Drift"|"Caroline Graham"
"ap 04:45"|"quarter to five"|"Before Troy could speak Barnaby said, ‘That had occurred to me as well but, as far as we know, only Dennis Rainbird fits that description. I checked with his partner and he definitely didn’t leave work until quarter to five on the Friday. Also there seems to be no reason why he should conceal any such relationship. It’s no longer against the law.’"|"The Killings at Badger's Drift"|"Caroline Graham"
"ap 11:30"|Eleven-thirty|"‘How fortuitous.’ She beamed at them. A faint scent of carnations and orris root pervaded the interior of the car. Before Barnaby could stop her she had opened the door, climbed in and disposed herself on the back seat. ‘Now,’ she said, ‘first and before I forget, the funeral’s tomorrow. Eleven-thirty. I don’t know if you wish to come?’"|"The Killings at Badger's Drift"|"Caroline Graham"
11:00|"eleven that morning"|"‘Absolutely.’ He pulled a final finger. The crack sounded very loud in the quiet room. Suddenly the silence seemed to thicken; change character. The doctor was staring at his fingers with some surprise as if he had never seen them before. He looked at Barnaby’s grave features, at Troy and back to Barnaby again. ‘Yes. Absolutely . . . that’s right.’ But the certainty had gone. It was no longer a statement of fact. He had the air of a man who knows he’s been rumbled but doesn’t yet know how.
‘The light stopped play at eleven that morning. For the day.’
‘Oh . . . well . . . maybe it was Thursday I watched. Yes, actually it was. I remember now—’"|"The Killings at Badger's Drift"|"Caroline Graham"
"ap 05:30"|"Half-past five"|"‘Half-past five. I remember ’cause that’s when I knock off for an hour. He asked me to go and have some tea with him. He was always asking me out. You have to pretend . . . you know . . . that you like them, and then, some of them - the simple ones - they really believe you. Try to get you to meet them outside. It’s pathetic, really.’"|"The Killings at Badger's Drift"|"Caroline Graham"
21:00|"nine o’clock that same evening"|"It was nine o’clock that same evening. Phyllis Cadell stood by the chiffonier in the larger of the two sitting rooms at Tye House. She stood stock still, listening. She had gobbled her pudding so quickly she thought the other two might notice but, as was sickeningly usual, they paid close and affectionate attention only to each other."|"The Killings at Badger's Drift"|"Caroline Graham"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"‘Right. On our way then.’ The three of them left the room, Dennis clinging trustingly like a child. Barnaby followed them out. The crowd, their wildest expectations more than fulfilled, played their part to the hilt, gasping aloud and crying out. One woman said, ‘And to think I nearly stopped in to watch the six o’clock news.’"|"The Killings at Badger's Drift"|"Caroline Graham"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"‘Please . . . oh please . . .’ A young girl lugging a Uher tape recorder stepped directly in his path. ‘Are you in charge of the case?’ She sounded breathless and exhilarated as if on her way to a party. ‘Local radio,’ she added, thrusting a bulbous windsocked mike under his nose. ‘If you give me something now it will make the seven o’clock news.’"|"The Killings at Badger's Drift"|"Caroline Graham"
"ap 03:00"|three|"Both the Lessiters looked at the policemen with interest, no doubt glad of a breather. However, the doctor did not wear his air of detached attention for long. Barnaby asked where he was between three and five that afternoon."|"The Killings at Badger's Drift"|"Caroline Graham"

I expect you think that’s wicked but it’s the truth. All I could think of was, I’ve got away with it, and I’ve got Henry.

My sister had died a few months before and left me this bungalow. My last couple of weeks at the cottage were as different again. No need to stage any more rows to put me off the scent. They didn’t bother to conceal how they felt. Didn’t even seem to think there was anything wrong. It was so natural for them, you see . . . just an extension of their close feelings. They couldn’t understand why I had to leave. Why I wasn’t happy for them both. I did try once or twice considering the possibility of staying on . . . they were still my babies in a way and I had promised their mother I’d look after them, but then one day Katherine started talking about their European tour. Oh they were going here . . . they were going there . . . I don’t know where they weren’t going.
