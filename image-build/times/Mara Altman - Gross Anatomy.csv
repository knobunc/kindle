16:00|"four p.m."|"That raven-haired beauty in front of me at Vinyasa Yoga on Nineteenth Street, Thursdays at four p.m., sports actual muttonchops. But why, when I look in the mirror, do I see Roddy McDowall in Planet of the Apes? How can I rid myself of an obsession borne by women since the dawn of time? What weapon do I have to combat the societal standard that all women must be smooth, supple, hairless creatures? When will I be permitted to let my hair down? Not my head hair, but my armpit hair, my facial hair, my leg hair, that little “happy trail.” And is that even what I want?"|"Gross Anatomy"|"Mara Altman"
20:05|2005|"That’s when I decided to try “permanent reduction” methods for the first time. It was 2005 when I finally signed up for laser. Once a month, I would go to a Bangkok hospital called, I swear, Bumrungrad. I’d lie on a gurney in a brightly lit room. All blank white walls, slightly yellowed by time. A doctor would come in with gloves, goggles, and a mask on over his face. A nurse would cover my eyes with darkened goggles and swab jelly on my skin. The doctor would then spend about ten minutes zapping my face with something that looked like the suction side of a Hoover. I had to fold my tongue over my upper front teeth so that when they did my upper lip, I wouldn’t feel the pain of the laser reaching my gums or whiff the slight smell of melting enamel. After, they’d give me icepacks for my red face, which emitted so much heat that my cheek, if placed on a woman’s abdomen, could probably help relieve menstrual cramps."|"Gross Anatomy"|"Mara Altman"
"ap > 00:30"|"after half of one"|"I quit after half of one leg. I couldn’t handle the pain. A razor seemed so much more humane. I was also having trouble letting go of the hair. I hadn’t come to an understanding with my body hair yet. That is, I still didn’t really like it. I felt guilty for favoring my leg without the hair, being so thrilled with how smooth it looked—that is, until I sat down and spoke to my mother. I’d been putting it off, but it was time, since it was our last day of the trip. She would be going back to California, and I would be heading back to New York."|"Gross Anatomy"|"Mara Altman"
"ap 02:00"|two|"Dave had had a hard time getting time off work, so we had waited two and a half years after our wedding to take the Japan honeymoon of our dreams. I had spent three months planning the affair. Over eleven days, we would be visiting four bustling cities. We began busying ourselves with packing and plans of what we’d eat."|"Gross Anatomy"|"Mara Altman"
"~ 20:00"|"around 2000"|"Though crabs—blood-sucking wingless genital goblins—sound apocalyptical, we actually have them on the defensive. They are becoming endangered because of habitat destruction. In one study, “Did the ‘Brazilian’ Kill the Pubic Louse?” researchers found that the dwindling number of crab infections coincided with the wax-it-all-off trend, which began around 2000. It’s hard to get good data—people often don’t report embarrassing parasites that have staked out their perianal region—but a 2009 study from East Carolina University reported that less than 2 percent of the population harbors papillon d’amour (which is the sexy French name for crabs). “Their forests are disappearing,” Danish lice expert Kim Søholt Larsen told me. “They are endangered because they don’t have anywhere to live.”"|"Gross Anatomy"|"Mara Altman"
"ap 01:00"|one|"I stood in the parking lot, waiting for the bus to come and take me back home. Unlike in the city, there wasn’t a constant barrage of reflective surfaces. There, at every turn, you are peering at, catching peripheral glimpses of, and judging yourself. In Rosendale, you are reflected by nature—the wind hitting against your skin, skimming and informing your curves, not trying to size them up or pin them down. A fly buzzed by my ear. A strand of hair tickled my nose. The sun warmed my cheeks. I was reminded, in those surroundings, of what it feels like to be inside a body, instead of what it feels like to look at one."|"Gross Anatomy"|"Mara Altman"
12:00|midday|"In one, he noted that when we began walking upright—on only two legs instead of the customary four—we also became a lot slower. “It was dangerous to be in open habitats,” he said. “We were vulnerable.” To survive, he believes we evolved the ability to sweat so that we could forage at times of day when other animals couldn’t. “Lions, hyenas, and all the predators that like to kill can’t be active when it’s very hot,” he said. Sweating, in other words, gave us a niche. We could gather food in peace because our panting predators couldn’t handle the midday heat."|"Gross Anatomy"|"Mara Altman"
14:00|"two p.m."|"If we did talk about it openly, I tried to envision how it would go: “Rita, I can’t make it to coffee today. I’ve got that two p.m. anus-control class.”"|"Gross Anatomy"|"Mara Altman"
07:00|"seven a.m."|"I arrived at his headquarters in Laguna Beach, California, at seven a.m. on a Thursday. He’s so busy and booked with dissatisfied vulva owners that he had to meet me before his office officially opened. Before the consultation, we chatted at his desk. There was nothing in the room that gave away his profession. I had been hoping there’d be something worth noting, like a bronzed statue of his favorite vaginal creation with a placard that said “Best in Show,” but instead there were only papers, books, and a computer. Alinsod wore blue scrubs and had an affable countenance, and he always bookended his lighthearted comments with “That’s a joke I like to tell.” He also had such a sincere face—cherubic cheeks and a near-constant grin—that, and I never thought I’d say this about the arrangement of anyone’s facial features, I would immediately trust him with a scalpel near my clitoris."|"Gross Anatomy"|"Mara Altman"
13:00|"one p.m."|"After breakfast, it was finally time for what I’d come there for: the Red Tent. We constructed a literal one in the living room. It was made out of a metal frame with different swatches of red fabric tacked over the top and sides until it closely resembled a street-fair booth that would have Middle Eastern rugs for sale inside. By the time everyone arrived, it was one p.m. and there were fifteen of us spanning from age eleven to seventy-three."|"Gross Anatomy"|"Mara Altman"
14:00|"two p.m."|"Mary, a woman in her forties, washed some dishes. Her two daughters were on a sofa, chatting with each other. Another woman was sitting with a book by the window. A mom and daughter from Austin, Texas, had gone for a hike somewhere outside. At that point, it was already close to two p.m."|"Gross Anatomy"|"Mara Altman"
19:00|"seven p.m."|"Finally, at seven p.m., everyone gathered for the ritual part of the evening. We formed a circle inside the tent—some sat on the maroon sofa, others on big pillows, and a few on the wood-slated floor. For the next hour, we meditated on our ovaries and then shook maracas while we sang songs with lady-centric lyrics."|"Gross Anatomy"|"Mara Altman"
06:00|"six a.m."|"I woke up at six a.m. with the chickens clucking and the sky just beginning its transition from black to blue. I felt calm and relaxed until I stared up at the ceiling. Last night I must have been in a chia-pudding-induced coma. What did that even mean—“the woman’s way”? Maggie and I would be leaving in a few hours, so I threw off my covers and rushed to the main yurt."|"Gross Anatomy"|"Mara Altman"
"ap 10:30"|ten-thirty|"Because of my persistent harassment—“Mom, whether you like it or not, this book needs to end with two generations of women embracing their female bodies, so let’s embrace, okay?”—she found herself next to me in the car at ten-thirty on a Saturday morning in early April, bound for a nudist resort while armed with more clothes than one would pack for an Alaskan sojourn."|"Gross Anatomy"|"Mara Altman"
06:00|"six a.m."|"We climbed onto the golf cart as Sheryl pumped the gas. The narrow looping lanes were packed with mobile homes and RVs, each only feet from the next, but bedecked and made unique with flowering plants, tchotchkes, and endearing signs like “Life Is Short, Party Naked” and “Caution: Menopause at Work.” At least two hundred people live in the community permanently, while more than sixteen hundred members visit for day trips. It felt like an adult summer camp with its many facilities—tennis courts, pickleball courts, an art and sewing studio with the sign “Naked Needle Gang” hanging in front, a café, a rec hall, a gym, an indoor pool for water volleyball, and the outdoor pool area, which was our final stop. “Usually, you have to come at six a.m. to get a lounge chair,” Sheryl said. Then she looked up at the sky. “Not today.”"|"Gross Anatomy"|"Mara Altman"
12:49|"11 to 1 pm"|"They were singing “You Are My Sunshine” to a resident who had just turned ninety years old. A sign hung from her balcony: “Come by for cake from 11 to 1 pm.”"|"Gross Anatomy"|"Mara Altman"
18:00|"six p.m."|"Before we left for the day, we tried our hand at pickleball. By that time, six p.m., everyone had deserted his or her athletic pursuits for the potluck and live DJ happening down at the rec hall, so we had the place to ourselves. We slipped on our tennis shoes and went to the courts. With thirty-five extra pounds, I wasn’t tremendously agile, but I did my best, which mostly meant standing in one place while my mom ran around collecting balls that I couldn’t run and hit."|"Gross Anatomy"|"Mara Altman"
