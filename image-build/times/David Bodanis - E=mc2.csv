Only in his spare time—an hour or two in the morning, and then one full day each week—did he focus on his science. But he called that single day his ""jour de bonheur""—his ""day of happiness."""|E=mc2|"David Bodanis"
17:27|"5:27 P.M."|"Roemer didn't go along with that. In August, at the esteemed public forum of a journal all serious astronomers read, he proclaimed a challenge. Astronomy is an exact science, and even seventeenth-century tools were good enough to determine that the satellite Io was scheduled to appear from behind Jupiter on the coming November 9, sometime in the late afternoon. By Cassini's reasoning, it would be detected at 5:27 P.M. on that day. That was what he extrapolated from when it had last been clearly sighted, in August."|E=mc2|"David Bodanis"
"ap 05:27"|5:27|"Roemer declared that Cassini was going to be wrong. In August, he explained, the earth had been close to Jupiter. In November it would be farther away. There would be nothing visible at 5:27—the light, though fast, would still be on its way, since it had to travel that extra distance. Even at 5:30 or 5:35 it wouldn't have made it across the solar system. Only at 5:37 precisely would anyone be able to get their first sighting on November 9."|E=mc2|"David Bodanis"

And Cassini declared he had not been proven wrong! (Spin-doctoring was not invented in the era of television.) Cassini had lots of supporters, and support him they did. Who'd ever said Io was expected at 5:25? That had only been Roemer, they now declared. Besides, everyone realized 10's arrival time was never certain. It was so far away, so hard to see exactly, that perhaps those clouds from Jupiter's upper atmosphere were producing a distorting haze; or maybe the high angle of its orbit was what made definite observations so difficult.

06:00|"6 A.M."|"At first glance the two men seemed very different. In his many years of research, Faraday had accumulated over 3,000 paragraphs of dated notebook entries on his experiments, from investigations that began early every morning. Maxwell, however, quite lacked any ability to get a timely start to the day. (When he was told that there was mandatory 6 A.M. chapel at Cambridge University, the story goes that he took a deep breath, and said, ""Aye, I suppose I can stay up that late."") Maxwell also had probably the finest mathematical mind of any nineteenth-century theoretical physicist, while Faraday had problems with any conventional math much beyond simple addition or subtraction."|E=mc2|"David Bodanis"
12:00|Midday|"9 Quiet in the Midday Snow
The solution to what was happening inside the nucleus— and so an unveiling of matter's deeper mechanisms, which would finally allow the energy promised by E=mc to emerge—only came in 1938. It was provided by a solitary Austrian woman, sixty years old, stuck on the edge of Europe, in Stockholm; who didn't even speak Swedish."|E=mc2|"David Bodanis"
12:00|midday|"The atom was open. Everyone had been wrong before. The way in wasn't by blasting harder and harder fragments at it. One woman, and her nephew, quiet in the midday snow, had now seen that. You didn't even have to supply the power for a uranium atom to explode. Just get enough extra neutrons in there to start it off. Then it would start jiggling, more and more wildly, until the strong forces that held it together gave way, and the electricity inside made the fragments fly apart. This explosion powered itself."|E=mc2|"David Bodanis"
09:00|"9:00 A.M."|"These terms weren't hard for Heisenberg to accept. In his teens he'd been active in the wandering clubs, where young Germans hiked for days or weeks at a time through wilderness areas, getting in contact with the true roots of their nation. Often, around the campfire, they'd talk of mystical heroes, and the way their country might regenerate in a hoped-for ""Third"" Reich, to be led—in the common phrasing of the time—by a sufficiently far-seeing leader, or Fuehrer. Many youngsters grew out of this, but well into his twenties Heisenberg remained drawn to the movement, despite mocking remarks from his more grown-up or liberal colleagues. During advanced university studies he'd regularly leave a seminar and meet up with a group of teenage boys, to lead them for a long walk and if possible a full night out in the woods, before racing back, by train, just in time for his next 9:00 A.M. lecture."|E=mc2|"David Bodanis"
"~ 21:00"|"about 9 P.M."|"After being parachuted in to Norway, they met up with an advance party of a few other Norwegians, which had waited in isolated huts all winter. Together, on cross-country skis, they reached Vemork a few weeks later, at about 9 P.M. on a Sunday night."|E=mc2|"David Bodanis"
"ap ~ 02:00"|"about two"|"Outside the factory perimeter they had to rest, sharing chocolate to get some strength. There was a loud noise of turbines, for due to the orders from Leipzig and Berlin, the factory worked on a twenty-four-hour schedule. What do nine highly armed men talk about? One was teased for how he was trying to pick rations out from between his teeth without the others noticing; others spoke, more seriously now, about two young married couples they'd met on the final night before their skiing journey to Vemork. One of the parachuted fighters had been at school with the young man in one of the couples, but at first they'd been scared at coming across armed strangers: they hadn't recognized him. Then when they finally did, each side had realized it was too dangerous to talk, even though the parachuted newcomers were desperate to hear what ordinary life had been like in Norway this past year. They'd had to spend the night aware of the lamps on in the couples' cabin, and the sight of smoke from their hearth fire; busying themselves so they would have no thoughts of home; just checking rifles and grenades and explosives, and waxing their cross-country skis for this assault."|E=mc2|"David Bodanis"
"~ 01:00"|"about 1 A.M."|"At about 1 A.M., there was a slight thud; a brief flash at a few of the windows. The eighteen ""cells"" that separated out the heavy water were chest high and built of thick steel, looking a bit like overbuilt gas-fired boilers. No explosives that nine men could carry in their climb would totally destroy them. Instead, the Norwegians had set small plastic charges at the bottom of each one. The charges opened up holes, and also sent enough shrapnel flying out to cut exposed pipes."|E=mc2|"David Bodanis"
10:45|"10:45 A.M."|"The bomb went off at 10:45 A.M.; the boat was in 1,300 feet of water. The flatcars from the train broke loose in the sudden tilt, their doors bursting open. The factory worker's mother wasn't on board—her son hadn't let her out of the house—but the violinist was. There were fifty-three people on board. Most of the sturdy German guards managed to fight their way off the tumbling ship in time, but many of the women and children were pushed aside. Over a dozen passengers were caught inside."|E=mc2|"David Bodanis"

Whistling, spinning, the bomb (""an elongated trash can with fins"") had taken forty-three seconds to fall from the B-29 that released it. There were small holes around its midpoint where wires had been tugged out of it as it dropped away: this had started the clock switches of its first arming system. More small holes had been drilled farther back on its dark steel casing, in New Mexico, and those took in samples of air as the free fall continued. When it had tumbled to 7,000 feet above the ground, a barometric switch was turned, priming the second arming system."|E=mc2|"David Bodanis"

The table fell silent, as if I had said something indecent. Nedelin grinned a bit crookedly. Then he rose, glass in hand, and said: 'Let me tell a parable. An old man wearing only a shirt was praying before an icon. ""Guide me, harden me. Guide me, harden me.""
