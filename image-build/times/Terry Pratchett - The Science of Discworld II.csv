"ap 07:15"|7.15|"This strange loop has a curious effect on causality. We get up in the morning and leave the house at 7.15 because we have to get to work by 9 o’clock. Scientifically, this is a very bizarre form of causality: the future is affecting the past. That doesn’t normally occur in physics (except in very esoteric Quantum things, but let’s not get distracted). In this case, science has an explanation. What causes you to get up at 7.15 is not actually your future arrival at work. If in fact you fall under a bus and never make it to work, you still got up at 7.15. Instead of backwards causality, you have a mental model, in your brain, which is your best attempt to predict the day ahead. In that model, realised as buzzing electrons, you think that you ought to be at work by nine. That model, and its expectation of the future, exists now, or more accurately, a short time in the past. It is that expectation that causes you to get up instead of lying in and having a well-deserved snooze. And the causality is entirely normal: from past to future by way of actions taking place in the present."|"The Science of Discworld II"|"Terry Pratchett"

"< 00:00"|"before midnight"|"2 As G.K. Chesterton pointed out, fairy tales are certainly not, as modern detractors of the fantasy genre believe, set in a world ‘where anything can happen’. They existed in a world with rules (‘don’t stray from the path’, ‘don’t open the blue door’, ‘you must be home before midnight’, and so on). In a world where anything could happen, you couldn’t have stories at all."|"The Science of Discworld II"|"Terry Pratchett"
19:43|7.43pm|"The stories that evolutionary biologists tell are of the same kind, and they become science when they stop being Just-So Stories, justifications after the event, and become general principles that make predictions. These predictions are of a limited kind: ‘in these circumstances expect this behaviour’. They are not predictions of the type ‘On Tuesday at 7.43pm the first elephant trunk will evolve’. But this is what ‘prediction’ means in science: saying ahead of time that under certain conditions, certain things will happen. You don’t have to predict the timing of the experiment."|"The Science of Discworld II"|"Terry Pratchett"
