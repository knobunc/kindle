19:14|1914|"Until the Chronological Institute has completed its present
labours of revision and defined the cardinal dates in our social
evolution, it is best to refer our account of the development of
man's mind and will throughout this hectic period of human
experience to the clumsy and irrelevant computation by centuries
before and after the Christian Era, that is still current. As we
have explained more fully in a previous book [Nothing of this
is to be found in Raven's notes.--ED.], we inherit this
system of historical pigeonholes from Christendom; that arbitrary
chequerwork of hundred-year blocks was imposed upon the entire
Mediterranean and Atlantic literatures for two thousand years,
and it still distorts the views of history of all but the
alertest minds. The young student needs to be constantly on his
guard against its false divisions. As Peter Lightfoot has
remarked, we talk of the ""eighteenth century"", and we think of
fashions and customs and attitudes that are characteristic of a
period extending from the Treaty of Westphalia in C.E. [Christian
Era] 1642 to the Napoleonic collapse in C.E. 1815; we talk of the
""nineteenth century"", and the pictures and images evoked are
those of the gas-lighting and steam-transport era, from after the
distressful years of post-Napoleonic recovery to the immense
shock of the World War in C.E. 1914. The phase ""twentieth
century"", again, calls forth images of the aeroplane, the
electrification of the world and so forth; but an aeroplane was
an extremely rare object in the air until 1914 (the first got up
in 1905), and the replacement of the last steam railway train and
the last steamship was not completed until the nineteen-forties.
It is a tiresome waste of energy to oblige each generation of
young minds to learn first of all in any unmeaning pattern of
centuries and then to correct that first crude arrangement, so
that this long-needed revision of our chronology is one that will
be very welcome to every teacher. Then from the very outset he or
she will be able to block out the story of our race in
significant masses."|"The Shape of Things to Come"|"H. G. Wells"
05:00|"five o'clock in the morning"|"He had not led his expeditionary force in Europe, even
nominally, for more than five weeks. He had kept to his Norwegian
hotel, avoided his more enthusiastic associates, started a
vigorous reduction of his financial commitments, and finally
bolted home. He deserted. He left his hotel at Christiania,
stealthily, at five o'clock in the morning, and, in spite of the
pleadings of those of his party who, warned at the last minute,
tumbled out of bed to protest, he got away. Before the year was
out he had ceased even financial support, and the various men and
women who had abandoned careers and positions and faced ridicule
and odium in complete faith in his simplicity were left to find
their way back to their former niches or discover fresh ones."|"The Shape of Things to Come"|"H. G. Wells"
12:00|midday|"""When first I saw the town from a distance, with the bleak,
bare uplands about it, I was reminded of the towns, once
familiar, that were too near the battleline in France. It was
midday, and sunny, yet this colliery town was silent and so still
that it seemed under a spell."|"The Shape of Things to Come"|"H. G. Wells"

1932"|"Even before the Central European fighting in 1940 and the
subsequent years, the distribution of various disease germs was
no longer a merely theoretical possibility. Little containers,
made to look like fountain pens, were already being manufactured.
The caps could be removed to expose soluble ends, and then they
could be dropped into reservoirs or running streams. Glass bombs
also existed for use from aeroplanes, railway-train windows and
so forth, which would break on hitting water. There are specimens
in the Aldershot Museum. The enrolment and territorial
organization of medical men and trained assistants to inoculate
threatened populations went on with increasing vigour after
1932."|"The Shape of Things to Come"|"H. G. Wells"
"> 19:45"|"after 1945"|"But there was a certain hesitation about the use of disease
germs. It is easy to distribute them but hard to limit their
field of action, and if prisoners (military or civilian) were
still to be taken and towns and territory occupied, a well
launched pestilence might conceivably recoil with deadly effect
upon its users. Bacterial warfare seemed, even to the specialists
who studied it, a very improbable method for any but an
heroically vindictive population in the hour of defeat.
Nevertheless it was thought best to have it worked out. Except
for the distribution of malignant influenza in Kan-su and Shensi
by the Japanese during their efforts to tranquillize North China
in 1936, ""without proceeding to extremities"", its use was never
officially admitted. Other alleged instances of its deliberate
employment by responsible Powers have been shown by the
researches of the Historical Bureau to have been due either to
the unauthorized zeal of subordinates or to the activities of
those religious fanatics who became so prevalent during the
period of confusion after 1945. The acclimatization of the
mosquito transmitting yellow fever in India in 1950, which did so
much to diminish the population of that peninsula, has never been
explained. It is generally supposed to have been accidental."|"The Shape of Things to Come"|"H. G. Wells"
