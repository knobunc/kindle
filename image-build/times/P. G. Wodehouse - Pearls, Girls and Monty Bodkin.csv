"ap 11:30"|"half past eleven"|"The intelligent reader will recall, though the vapid and irreflective reader may have forgotten, that Mr. Butterwick, in outlining his conditions, had made the concession that a certain amount of correspondence would be permitted, and Monty had been swift to avail himself of this unexpected softening of the old buster's iron front.

The man who sneak s down and opens front doors at two in the morning is a man who you can bet your bottom dollar is all set to imitate the cry of the brown owl at the drop of a hat.’"|"Pearls, Girls and Monty Bodkin"|"P.
