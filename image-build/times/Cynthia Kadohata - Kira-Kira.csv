"ap 03:30"|3:30|"At 3:30 each afternoon, I would watch out the window until I saw Lynn walking down the street—there were no sidewalks in our small town. I would run outside to meet her. Mrs. Kanagawa said I was like Lynn’s pet dog."|Kira-Kira|"Cynthia Kadohata"
00:00|midnight|"Joe-John and I would be at a birthday party. We would never have met. Somehow or other (I was still figuring out the details), we would both end up in the bathroom together. Maybe I was admiring the shower curtain, and he came in because he spotted me from behind and liked my sweater. The door accidentally locked behind him, and we couldn’t get out. The party was so noisy that no one could hear us shouting. The window was stuck. We were in a back bathroom that rarely got used. Time passed. We talked until midnight, and then we had no choice but to sleep in the bathtub together. All night we would tell each other secrets, and then by morning we would be in love. As I said, I was still working on the details, but that’s the gist."|Kira-Kira|"Cynthia Kadohata"
04:30|"4:30 A.M."|"MY FATHER’S HOURS changed sometimes. His newest schedule was to work for ten to twelve hours, then eat and sleep a few hours at the hatchery, and then get up and work six hours. When he wasn’t working at his main hatchery, he worked at a different one in another town. My mother’s current shift ran from 4:30 A.M. to 1:30 P.M., plus three hours of overtime."|Kira-Kira|"Cynthia Kadohata"

04:30|"four thirty in the morning"|"“Insurance.” She spoke casually but was obviously very proud. I wished my father worked in an office! “I do the load for the shift that gets off at four thirty in the morning. Then my uncle brings me back during his lunchtime and I do one more load, and then my mother takes me home. I’m saving for a new school dress.”"|Kira-Kira|"Cynthia Kadohata"
19:30|"seven thirty in the evening"|"“Yes,” said my mother coolly. My mother was scared the union supporters would get them all fired, even her. She wanted a house, and she didn’t care if she couldn’t use the bathroom during work or if her fingers were so stiff that she couldn’t move them when she got home. If that’s what a house cost, she would pay the price.
“The meeting’s at seven thirty in the evening,” said Mrs. Kilgore.
“Wednesday evening is bad for me,” said my mother."|Kira-Kira|"Cynthia Kadohata"
12:00|midday|"I ran off through the field, hoping I wouldn’t get lost. But after awhile I couldn’t figure out which way I was supposed to go. It seemed to my memory that at first we’d walked north to get to the picnic site, and then we’d turned west. That meant that I should walk east and then south. But when I walked east, it seemed to me that I was going in the wrong direction. So then I looked around and tried to remember where the sun had been when we’d first entered the field earlier. I decided the sun had been before us: east. So we’d walked east first and then south? I checked to see where the sun was starting its midday descent. Then I realized it didn’t matter which way I went. I just ran."|Kira-Kira|"Cynthia Kadohata"
"ap ~ 10:00"|"about ten"|"New Year’s is the biggest holiday of the year for the Japanese. Every year since we’d lived in Georgia, Mrs. Muramoto held a big party. She served sake and mochi and a couple dozen different snacks. We would usually stay until about ten and then go home. Just before dawn I would get up and write down my hatsuyume, first dream of the new year. Then we would meet the other families and go to the empty lot nearby with our lawn chairs to watch the sunrise. Watching the first sunrise is the traditional way to celebrate New Year’s in Japan. The last few years, though, nobody had bothered getting up for the sunrise. The fathers were all too tired for such a celebration."|Kira-Kira|"Cynthia Kadohata"
"ap ~ 11:30"|"around 11:30"|"I put on my pajamas around 11:30 and lay on the floor next to Lynn’s bed. The Rabbit on the Moon looked so pretty shining in the outlet."|Kira-Kira|"Cynthia Kadohata"
