"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"On the morning of the twelfth of April 1577, a day of pale sunlight and a tender blue sky, Queen Sofie, eight and a half months pregnant with her third child, set out at nine o’clock with Elizabeth to cross the lake and spend the morning knitting. Her chosen spot was a clearing in the woods, a little shaded by some hazel bushes and rose briars, where she would set down cushions on the mossy grass. Here she was sitting, putting the finishing touches to a pair of underdrawers while Elizabeth worked upon a sock, with the coils of yarn unravelling moment by moment between them, when the Queen felt a troublesome thirst come upon her. They had brought no provisions, only the secret knitting in a wooden box, and so Queen Sofie asked Elizabeth if she would row back across the lake to the castle and return with a flagon of beer."|"Music & Silence"|"Rose Tremain"

"ap 04:30"|"half past four"|"Peter Claire is not sure what he can say in reply to this. He looks down and his long fingers caress the neck and body of his lute. The King swallows the last of the white powder, belches loudly and puts down the glass. “I shall sleep now,” he says. “I did not get any sleep last night. I went to my wife for comfort at half past four, but she sent me away. I do not know what we are come to.”"|"Music & Silence"|"Rose Tremain"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"Bror opened his eyes just after the great clock on the Koldinghus tower struck seven. Finding Christian there, holding his hand, he said: “What’s happening? Where have I been?”"|"Music & Silence"|"Rose Tremain"
00:00|Midnight|"So agreeable do I find the presence of Emilia that I have lighted upon an Idea, which may be of assistance to me on that ill-fated day when the King returns from Norway. I have told her that there are certain nights in the month when cruel fears and hauntings do enter my mind and at such times I like to have near me some gentle person with whom, if it moves me, I can hold Midnight Conversations."|"Music & Silence"|"Rose Tremain"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"He has seen the mornings empty of Charlotte. He has seen the afternoons passing in unaccustomed silence. He has seen his congregation assembled at Evensong and, though he searches for his daughter’s face among them, he knows that she is not there. He has seen himself grow old in mourning for his departed children."|"Music & Silence"|"Rose Tremain"

"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"All year round, it is cold in the cellar, yet Peter Claire feels too warm. He sits down on the chair that is habitually his when the orchestra plays or rehearses and tries to breathe slowly, so that when seven o’clock arrives she will find him calm and serene. And then, in the middle of the time when seven o’clock should still be some way off, it arrives. The church clock strikes. It seems to Peter Claire that the church clock has treacherously swallowed three or four minutes of his existence in its haste to get to the hour."|"Music & Silence"|"Rose Tremain"

And so he waits, watching the birds, but half turned towards the direction from which Emilia will arrive. The afternoon has been warm, but now, at five o’clock, there is that faint, glittery chill in the air that warns of autumn, that speaks to the human heart of endings and departures."|"Music & Silence"|"Rose Tremain"

"ap 07:10"|"ten minutes past seven"|"Emilia stares at it. The clock is stopped at ten minutes past seven.
This is the time that it will always tell.
But what does it signify? What happened at ten minutes past seven that was so important to Karen that she buried a valuable clock in the beechwoods?"|"Music & Silence"|"Rose Tremain"

When the search party returned to the house, Magdalena made them drink hot elderflower wine to warm them and said: “Marcus will not be found until he wishes to be found, so why do you wear yourselves out so uselessly?”"|"Music & Silence"|"Rose Tremain"

Content in her kitchen, chivvying her maids for breadcrumbs and dried apricots and cloves, for chestnuts and pork dripping, Magdalena kneads the goose stuffing with her powerful hands and tells herself that perhaps today, Christmas Day 1629, one era is ending and another beginning."|"Music & Silence"|"Rose Tremain"

The peasant apologises to the King that all he can offer him is water out of the rain butt. The King replies that water is the element in which Denmark floats and which gives him hope, and the man laughs again, almost doubles up with his mirth, and then coughs once more and spits once more and shakes his head, as though the thing which had been said might be the funniest jest he had ever heard told."|"Music & Silence"|"Rose Tremain"

For surely the condition of Slavery is spread through and through our Society, except that it is not termed Slavery: it is termed Duty. And chiefest among those who live in a condition of Bondage and yet call their bonds by sweet names such as Fidelity and Hope are Women. For are we not owned—as Drudges or Ornaments or a combination of both—by our Fathers and Husbands? Do we not labour and bring forth children and get no reward for this except the reward of the mewling child itself, which is no reward at all? Might we not as well pick cotton in the heat of midday as lie on our backs with our legs spread open to the branding iron? What wages have we deserved in all our terrible work and pain of the bed alone, and never got?"|"Music & Silence"|"Rose Tremain"
"ap 07:10"|"ten minutes past seven"|"Emilia has her pot of poison now, white as snow. Unable to pay the money demanded by the apothecary, she has given him, in exchange, the only thing of value that she owned: the stopped clock. The apothecary, so accustomed to working with his scales and measures, held the clock in his hands, as if the value of all things could be measured in weight alone. Then he wound it up and shook it, and this shaking of the clock set it ticking and the hands moved on from ten minutes past seven."|"Music & Silence"|"Rose Tremain"
