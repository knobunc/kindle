"ap 06:07"|Six-seven|"“Six-seven, responding par two,” responded a truck from Bloxom. “Six” was their station number, “seven” the truck number, and “par two” indicated that the truck contained a pair of firefighters. Bloxom’s truck was the first to arrive at the fire, even before Phil Kelley. The Bloxom firefighter holding the radio got out of the truck on Dennis Drive and assessed the situation. “Be advised,” he said into his radio, “structure is fully involved.”"|"American Fire"|"Monica Hesse"
"ap 08:07"|Eight-seven|"“Eight-seven, responding par two,” said Richie Bridges, a captain with Station 8, the department from the town of Tasley, as he barreled down Lankford Highway in a massive tanker."|"American Fire"|"Monica Hesse"
"ap 08:05"|Eight-five|"At Dennis Drive, Kelley saw that Beall’s engine had arrived. The two men were friends; they worked together on Wallops Island. They respected and trusted each other, and Kelley immediately ordered Beall’s team to fill a two-and-a-half-inch hose with water and start attacking the west side of the building. The plan, he’d decided, would be to put out the fire where it was most virulent, and then force the house to collapse to the ground while they doused the rest of the flames. “Eight-five,” he told Beall’s engine. “Charge that line!”"|"American Fire"|"Monica Hesse"
"< 01:00"|"nearly one in the morning"|"With the fire put out, there was no light but the headlamps from the trucks. The firefighters walked the perimeter of the scene, as they did with all fires, making sure that there were no remaining embers, nothing to catch on the nearby trees or to send a fire to the houses across the field. Again, they saw nothing unusual, nothing suspicious. When all of that patrolling was done, Kelley, who never did end up eating his birthday cake, radioed in his last update from the scene at nearly one in the morning of November 13: “Terminating command.”"|"American Fire"|"Monica Hesse"
01:30|"half past 1 a.m."|"Hasty now found herself part of another defining Accomack story. At half past 1 a.m. on November 13—twelve miles away from where Deborah Clark had called in the first fire three hours before—Hasty went to let out her dog, who wouldn’t stop barking, and saw that those old migrant camp buildings were now aflame."|"American Fire"|"Monica Hesse"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"So it would be one of those nights, Shannon thought, as she grabbed her gear again. Two calls in one night was unusual, but not unheard of, especially in the fall when people began turning on their furnaces or holding bonfires in their backyards. For Shannon, it meant it would be a night when she wouldn’t see her husband or her three boys; by now it was after midnight and they were probably asleep. She climbed back into the trucks with everyone else, and Beall called into dispatch to figure out what Tasley was getting into next."|"American Fire"|"Monica Hesse"
"ap 03:00"|three|"Houses catch on fire; it doesn’t always mean anything. It wasn’t unusual for an abandoned house or two to burn down every year. But this had been three in one night. To everyone involved, it was beginning to feel off. It felt, as Jeff Beall would later describe it to friends, like a person arriving home at the end of the day and finding windows open at his house. One open window, and a person might assume that his spouse had done it to air out the kitchen after a cooking mishap. But if all of the windows were open, it became something else, something eerie and malicious."|"American Fire"|"Monica Hesse"
06:00|"6 a.m."|"She got another nursing job, at a residential house for mentally disabled adults where she arrived by 6 a.m. to make beds and help residents through their wake-up call and breakfast. Her colleagues liked her, thought she was a fast learner and unflinching in the face of messy, intimate work. It was hard, and it didn’t pay particularly well. In that job, she almost never made more than $15,000 a year. When she talked about her private life with her colleagues, it was about her boys, whom she doted on. She complained, sometimes, that the boys’ father didn’t send regular child support, but she made do. She baked cupcakes for school fund-raisers, she bought the boys clothes from Peebles, a local department store with precisely hung jeans and collared shirts, instead of from Walmart or Rose’s, the discount chain where clothing was always sliding off hangers and sometimes had holes."|"American Fire"|"Monica Hesse"

Maybe she was wrong, maybe she hadn’t heard anything. She went to the kitchen for a drink of water. It was two or three in the morning, only a few hours before her shift at Perdue and her husband’s shift at Tyson. Now she definitely heard something. A banging on her front door—which in itself was odd; friends and family knew they always used the side entrance—and someone yelling: “Your garage is on fire!

Numbly, she realized that whoever had lit the garage on fire had also taken the time to let out the chickens.

Everybody took that advice, and shortly after, somebody else noticed a different thing: one of the features of the app was that it showed users which cities it was most popular in, a top ten list. There was a period of time in late 2012 and early 2013 when number three was New York City and number two was Los Angeles, and the number one place where people were listening for crime data on their phones was Accomack County, Virginia."|"American Fire"|"Monica Hesse"

Inside the smoky, half-redone house there were wood pilings and construction beams, flammable renovation materials that needed to be cleared away.

She looked unkempt, stripped of the armor she normally applied so carefully. A few in the panel recognized her anyway, from following the news, but to most of them she was nobody. Her face was expressionless. Some of the jury panel didn’t know what to make of her: at least one, a retired nurse, looked at the small woman surrounded by the hordes of uniformed men—deputies from both Accomack and Virginia Beach, members of the Virginia State Police—and immediately felt sorry for her."|"American Fire"|"Monica Hesse"

He would call the sheriff’s deputy and the police officer who stopped the van, and the firemen, and the officials who had performed the search of the van, and Scott Wade, the investigator who questioned Bundick, and a man from Verizon Wireless who would tell them technical things about an important call made at 11:35 p.m. on the night the defendant was arrested."|"American Fire"|"Monica Hesse"

The ones in the Walmart electronics department were more expensive than the $300 she’d allotted, so they tried a nearby GameStop, and Family Dollar, and then they went back to Walmart, which had turned out to have the best deal after all. Before they checked out, she and Charlie decided they needed a few groceries. “So when we got into the grocery section—mind you, I was the one, I was buying the items that night, I was the one who had the money—and Charlie wanted a box of Steak-umms. And to make a long story short, when we would use his money to go to the grocery store, everything had to be bought as a meal. You know, everything had to be a meal. And he picked up these Steak-umms and he said he wanted to get those and he was going to take them home and fix them. And, of course, I’m like, but you can’t do that because everything has to be a meal. You know, we’re planning our money out. We have to get enough to make meals that will last.
