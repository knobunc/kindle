    The two sides of The Hobbit are, then, fairly clear: on the one side there is modern middle-class English Bilbo, on the other the archaic world which lies behind both vulgar folk-tale and its aristocratic, indeed heroic ancestors. The former is represented by clocks and fussiness – Bilbo gasping out, ‘I didn’t get your note till after 10.45 to be precise’, and feeling he cannot leave home without a pocket-handkerchief. The latter is created by poetry and the Misty Mountains and Bilbo feeling how grand it would be to ‘wear a sword instead of a walking-stick’. Naturally the two sides are going to clash, and much of The Hobbit is about the clash of styles, attitudes, behaviour patterns – though in the end one might conclude that they are not as far apart as they first seemed, and that Bilbo has just as much right to the archaic world and its treasures as Thorin or Bard. However the pressing problem for Tolkien was perhaps not to introduce the archaic world – much of which, as has been said above, has long been familiar at least in its personnel even to child readers – as to give it intellectual coherence, to make the reader feel that it had a sort of existence outside the immediate narrative. Tolkien solved this problem, in The Hobbit, if quite differently in The Lord of the Rings, by flexible and intrusive use of the authorial voice."|"J. R. R. Tolkien"|"Tom Shippey"
12:00|noon|"There often by him would he see,

      when noon was hot on leaf and tree,

      the king of Faerie with his rout

      came hunting in the woods about

      with blowing far and crying dim,

      and barking hounds that were with him;

      yet never a beast they took nor slew,

      and where they went he never knew."|"J. R. R. Tolkien"|"Tom Shippey"
19:18|1918|"To this he added further, ‘An author cannot of course remain wholly unaffected by his experience’; but his experience, he reminded readers, probably went back further than theirs. 1914 was just as bad as 1939, if you were young then: ‘By 1918 all but one of my close friends were dead’. And ‘The Scouring of the Shire’, with its felled trees and polluted rivers, reflected a process which went back long before the austerity years of the Labour government of 1945-50, so that the chapter ‘had no allegorical significance or contemporary political reference whatsoever’. But that did not mean it meant nothing, and nor did the rejection of the World War II / nuclear weapons allegory mean that The Lord of the Rings had nothing at all to do with Tolkien’s early twentieth-century experience."|"J.

19:45|1945|"But the other reason for Niggle’s lack of success, besides trying to paint things ‘too large and ambitious for his skill’, is (and this is the reason mentioned first) that ‘he had many other things to do’. In particular he has a house, a garden, many visitors, and an annoying neighbour, Mr Parish. What, one has to wonder, if one accepts that this story is in fact an allegory, and therefore dependent on the making of equations (see pp. 162-4 above), are these supposed to represent? A good deal fits together if one remembers the particular circumstances of Tolkien’s job. He was a Professor, and an Oxford Professor. The capital letter is significant, for (as is not the case in the USA), not all faculty members at Oxford University were or are Professors: indeed few of them are, and even fewer in Tolkien’s time. A Professor is the holder of a University Chair, and in Tolkien’s time the English Faculty at Oxford had precisely three of them, the Rawlinson and Bosworth Chair of Anglo-Saxon which Tolkien held from 1925 to 1945, and the two Merton Chairs, by convention one for literature and one for language, the latter of which Tolkien held from 1945 till his retirement in 1959. These three Chairs are valuable and (it is fair to say) coveted by the very much larger number of college fellows and university lecturers – in Tolkien’s day some thirty or forty – who compete for them. (One might note that C.S. Lewis, despite the distinction of his scholarship, was one of the thirty or forty who never got one at Oxford, moving to Cambridge to take one up in 1954 when he was fifty-five.) The Chairs are valuable primarily because they are University appointments, not college appointments, and release their holders from the very time-consuming task of responsibility for providing undergraduate tutorials in colleges (in my day, some twelve to sixteen teaching hours a week). In return for this relative freedom Chairs are required to give a certain number of open lectures for undergraduates (Carpenter’s Biography says thirty-six a year, which I think should be thirty-five, five sets of seven), to teach graduate students (there were relatively few of these in Tolkien’s time), but above all to advance scholarship in their subject-areas, primarily by publication."|"J.
