00:00|midnight|"Finally, sometime close to midnight, when my eyelids had nearly given up the strain of staying open, a purring noise started over in the corner, low and vibrating, a sound you could almost mistake for a cat. Moments later shadows moved like spatter paint along the walls, catching the light when they passed the window so I could see the outline of wings. The sound swelled in the dark till the entire room was pulsating, till the air itself became alive and matted with bees. They lapped around my body, making me the perfect center of a whirlwind cloud. I could not hear myself think for all the bee hum."|"The Secret Life of Bees"|"Sue Monk Kidd"
"> 18:00"|"after 6:00 P.M."|"It was after 6:00 P.M. when I wandered back to the house from the peach stand, having sold nothing, not one peach, and found Rosaleen in the living room. Usually she would’ve gone home by now, but she was wrestling with the rabbit ears on top of the TV, trying to fix the snow on the screen. President Johnson faded in and out, lost in the blizzard. I’d never seen Rosaleen so interested in a TV show that she would exert physical energy over it."|"The Secret Life of Bees"|"Sue Monk Kidd"
10:00|"ten in the morning"|"The finish was rubbed off the sides of the picture where her thumbs had held it. Her shelf had to do with a religion she’d made up for herself, a mixture of nature and ancestor worship. She’d stopped going to the House of Prayer Full Gospel Holiness Church years ago because it started at ten in the morning and didn’t end till three in the afternoon, which is enough religion to kill a full-grown person, she’d said."|"The Secret Life of Bees"|"Sue Monk Kidd"

"ap 02:40"|2:40|"The clock read 2:40. I needed a solid plan, but I didn’t have the luxury of sitting down to think one up. I grabbed my pink canvas duffel bag, the one I’d planned to use for overnights the minute anyone asked me. I took the thirty-eight dollars I’d earned selling peaches and stuffed it into the bag with my seven best pairs of panties, the ones that had the days of the week printed across the backside. I dumped in socks, five pairs of shorts, tops, a nightgown, shampoo, brush, toothpaste, toothbrush, rubber bands for my hair, all the time watching the window. What else? Catching sight of the map tacked on the wall, I snatched it down, not bothering to pry out the tacks."|"The Secret Life of Bees"|"Sue Monk Kidd"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"At the nurses’ station a policeman leaned on the desk. He looked like somebody just out of high school, who’d flunked PE and hung out with the shop boys smoking at recess. He was talking to a girl in white. A nurse, I guess, but she didn’t look much older than I was. “I get off at six o’clock,” I heard him say. She stood there smiling, tucking a piece of hair behind her ear."|"The Secret Life of Bees"|"Sue Monk Kidd"
"ap 06:00"|six|"“Well, I imagine you’ll want to rest up like Rosaleen. Supper is at six. You like sweet-potato biscuits? That’s May’s specialty.”"|"The Secret Life of Bees"|"Sue Monk Kidd"
01:00|"one at night"|"We lived for honey. We swallowed a spoonful in the morning to wake us up and one at night to put us to sleep. We took it with every meal to calm the mind, give us stamina, and prevent fatal disease. We swabbed ourselves in it to disinfect cuts or heal chapped lips. It went in our baths, our skin cream, our raspberry tea and biscuits. Nothing was safe from honey. In one week my skinny arms and legs began to plump out and the frizz in my hair turned to silken waves. August said honey was the ambrosia of the gods and the shampoo of the goddesses."|"The Secret Life of Bees"|"Sue Monk Kidd"
10:00|"10:00 A.M."|"The Daughters of Mary started showing up in the parlor before 10:00 A.M. First was an old woman named Queenie and her grown daughter, Violet. They were dressed alike in bright yellow skirts and white blouses, though they wore different hats, at least. Next came Lunelle, Mabelee, and Cressie, who wore the fanciest hats I’d ever laid eyes on."|"The Secret Life of Bees"|"Sue Monk Kidd"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"I didn’t know if it was the emptiness, the stifling heat, or the fact it was only nine o’clock, but I couldn’t settle into sleep despite how tired I was. I peeled off my top and my underwear and lay on the damp sheets. I liked the feel of nudeness. It was a smooth, oiled feeling on the sheets, a set-free feeling."|"The Secret Life of Bees"|"Sue Monk Kidd"
08:00|"eight o’clock in the morning"|"At eight o’clock in the morning it hit 94, with the ambitious plan of reaching 103 before noon. I woke up with August shaking my shoulder, saying it was gonna be a scorcher, get up, we had to water the bees."|"The Secret Life of Bees"|"Sue Monk Kidd"

00:00|midnight|"I sat in the truck like I had frozen and the world had frozen around me. The crowd faded away, and all the cars downtown went home one by one. People closed up their stores. I stared through the windshield as if I was watching the test pattern that came on television at midnight."|"The Secret Life of Bees"|"Sue Monk Kidd"
10:00|"ten o’clock that morning"|"At ten o’clock that morning, while June was playing more songs for May, and Rosaleen was poking around in the kitchen, I sat on the back-porch steps with my notebook, trying to write everything down, but really I was watching for August. She had gone out to the wailing wall. I pictured her out there working her pain into the spaces around the stones."|"The Secret Life of Bees"|"Sue Monk Kidd"
18:00|"6:00 P.M."|"At 6:00 P.M. I was exhausted from Mary Day goings-on, and the real part hadn’t even started. I got the last thing on my list done and was headed to the honey house to get dressed, when June and Neil pulled into the driveway."|"The Secret Life of Bees"|"Sue Monk Kidd"
12:00|noon|"The Daughters and Otis arrived at noon, lugging in all manner of potluck dishes, as if we hadn’t eaten ourselves sick the night before. They tucked them into the oven to keep warm and stood around in the kitchen sneaking bites of Rosaleen’s corn fritters, saying they were the finest fritters they’d ever had the pleasure of eating, which caused Rosaleen to swell up with pride."|"The Secret Life of Bees"|"Sue Monk Kidd"
12:00|noontime|"She led the group outside for the last of the Mary Day ceremony. We paraded into the backyard, all the Daughters with tiny smudges of grease clinging to their lips. June was out there waiting for us, sitting in an armless kitchen chair, playing her cello. We gathered around her while the lights of noontime bore down. The music she played was the kind that sawed through you, cutting into the secret chambers of your heart and setting the sadness free. Listening to it, I could see my mother sitting on a Trailways bus, riding out of Sylvan, while my four-year-old self napped on the bed, not yet knowing what I would wake to."|"The Secret Life of Bees"|"Sue Monk Kidd"
22:00|"ten o’clock at night"|"That night when the katydids and tree frogs and every other musical creature were wound up and going strong, I walked around the honey house, feeling like I had spring fever. It was ten o’clock at night, and I honestly felt like I could’ve scrubbed the floors and washed the windows."|"The Secret Life of Bees"|"Sue Monk Kidd"
00:00|midnight|"I came back, and before I knew it I was involved in a full-blown cleaning frenzy. By midnight I had the place shining."|"The Secret Life of Bees"|"Sue Monk Kidd"
14:00|"2:00 P.M."|"The knock on the door came at 2:00 P.M. I was sitting in the parlor writing in the new notebook Zach had left at my door, setting down everything that had happened to me since Mary Day. Words streamed out of me so fast I couldn’t keep up with them, and that’s all I was thinking about. I didn’t pay attention to the knock. Later I would remember it didn’t sound like an ordinary knock. More like a fist pounding."|"The Secret Life of Bees"|"Sue Monk Kidd"
