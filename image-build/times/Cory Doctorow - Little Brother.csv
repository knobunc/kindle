12:00|noon|"I’d heard sirens like these before—they test the civil defense sirens at noon on Tuesdays. But I’d only heard them go off unscheduled in old war movies and video games, the kind where someone is bombing someone else from above. Air raid sirens. The wooooooo sound made it all less real."|"Little Brother"|"Cory Doctorow"
"ap 01:00"|one|"I stared at one, a young white woman with brown hair who barely looked older than me, kind of cute in a scary office-power-suit way. If you stare at someone long enough, they’ll eventually look back at you. She did, and her face slammed into a totally different configuration, dispassionate, even robotic. The smile vanished in an instant."|"Little Brother"|"Cory Doctorow"
"ap 01:00"|one|"“Are you okay?” I asked him, and my friend with the utility belt abruptly put his hand on my forehead and shoved hard, bouncing the back of my head off the truck’s metal wall with a sound like a clock striking one. “No talking,” he said as I struggled to refocus my eyes."|"Little Brother"|"Cory Doctorow"
"~ 00:00"|"gone midnight"|"I rolled out of bed. It had gone midnight and I’d heard my parents hit the sack at eleven. I grabbed the laptop and cleared some space on my desk and clipped the little LED lamps to the temples of my magnifying glasses and pulled out a set of little precision screwdrivers. A minute later, I had the case open and the keyboard removed and I was staring at the guts of my laptop. I got a can of compressed air and blew out the dust that the fan had sucked in and looked things over."|"Little Brother"|"Cory Doctorow"

02:00|"2 A.M."|"Now I was up and running, and ParanoidLinux was looking for other Xbox Universals to talk to. Every Xbox Universal comes with built-in wireless for multiplayer gaming. You can connect to your neighbors on the wireless link and to the Internet, if you have a wireless Internet connection. I found three different sets of neighbors in range. Two of them had their Xbox Universals also connected to the Internet. ParanoidXbox loved that configuration: it could siphon off some of my neighbors’ Internet connections and use them to get online through the gaming network. The neighbors would never miss the packets: they were paying for flat-rate Internet connections, and they weren’t exactly doing a lot of surfing at 2 A.M."|"Little Brother"|"Cory Doctorow"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"Believe it or not, my parents made me go to school the next day. I’d only fallen into feverish sleep at three in the morning, but at seven the next day, my dad was standing at the foot of my bed, threatening to drag me out by the ankles.

I hadn’t because I’d known what he’d say—that it was an ugly hack, that I needed to think it through better. Jolu was always figuring out how to turn my 2 A.M. ideas into real code, but the stuff that he came out with was always a little different from what I’d come up with. I’d wanted the project for myself. I’d gotten totally into being M1k3y."|"Little Brother"|"Cory Doctorow"

"ap ~ 11:30"|"around 11:30"|"I paid for the coffees and we went out. I called my parents and let them know what I was doing. Jolu’s mom insisted on making us sandwiches. We locked ourselves in his room with his computer and the code for indienet and we embarked on one of the great all-time marathon programming sessions. Once Jolu’s family went to bed around 11:30, we were able to kidnap the coffee machine up to his room and go IV with our magic coffee bean supply."|"Little Brother"|"Cory Doctorow"

20:00|8PM|"> At like 8PM they changed shifts and two new cops came in and bawled out the two cops who were there all like wtf? aren’t you doing anything here. They had a real fight and then the two old cops left and the new cops sat down at their desks and whispered to each other for a while."|"Little Brother"|"Cory Doctorow"
20:00|"8 P.M."|"Bringing along the tarpaulins and chemical glove-warmers was my idea. Jolu figured out where to get the beer—his older brother, Javier, had a buddy who actually operated a whole underage drinking service: pay him enough and he’d back up to your secluded party spot with ice chests and as many brews as you wanted. I blew a bunch of my indienet programming money, and the guy showed up right on time—8 P.M., a good hour after sunset—and lugged the six foam ice chests out of his pickup truck and down into the ruins of the baths. He even brought a spare chest for the empties."|"Little Brother"|"Cory Doctorow"
21:00|"nine P.M."|"Jolu and I each cracked beers—Anchor Steam for him, a Bud Lite for me—and clinked the bottles together, sitting down on a rock.

I’d invited all the people I really trusted. Either I was more discriminating than Jolu or less popular. Now that he’d told me he was quitting, it made me think that he was less discriminating. I was really pissed at him, but trying not to let it show by concentrating on socializing with other people. But he wasn’t stupid. He knew what was going on. I could see that he was really bummed.

02:00|"2 A.M."|"We came to 16th Street and turned down toward Mission Street. Normally that’s a pretty scary neighborhood at 2 A.M. on a Saturday night.

20:00|"8 P.M."|"I picked 8 P.M., after dinner. Mom had been bugging me about all the evenings I’d been spending out of the house until I finally spilled the beans about Ange, whereupon she came over all misty and kept looking at me like, my-little-boy’s-growing-up. She wanted to meet Ange, and I used that as leverage, promising to bring her over the next night if I could “go to the movies” with Ange tonight."|"Little Brother"|"Cory Doctorow"
23:00|"11 P.M."|"By 11 P.M. I’d had enough. Besides, my parents would be expecting me home soon. I logged out of the game and so did Ange and we lay there for a moment. I took her hand and she squeezed hard. We hugged."|"Little Brother"|"Cory Doctorow"

03:00|"3 A.M."|"There were a couple of big Wretched Daylight games every month. The organizers of the games had a good relationship with the city’s hotels and they let it be known that they’d take ten un-booked rooms on Friday night and fill them with players who’d run around the hotel, playing low-key Wretched Daylight in the corridors, around the pool, and so on, eating at the hotel restaurant and paying for the hotel WiFi. They’d close the booking on Friday afternoon, email us, and we’d go straight from school to whichever hotel it was, bringing our knapsacks, sleeping six or eight to a room for the weekend, living on junk food, playing until 3 A.M. It was good, safe fun that our parents could get behind."|"Little Brother"|"Cory Doctorow"

18:00|"6 P.M."|"But on the ground, it’s grimy and gross. Homeless people sleep on all the benches. The district is empty by 6 P.M. except for drunks and druggies, because with only one kind of building there, there’s no legit reason for people to hang around after the sun goes down. It’s more like a mall than a neighborhood, and the only businesses there are bail bondsmen and liquor stores, places that cater to the families of crooks on trial and the bums who make it their nighttime home."|"Little Brother"|"Cory Doctorow"
08:00|"8 A.M."|"Now it was rush hour and Civic Center was as busy at it could be. The Civic Center BART also serves as the major station for Muni trolley lines, and if you need to switch from one to another, that’s where you do it. At 8 A.M. there were thousands of people coming up the stairs, going down the stairs, getting into and out of taxis and on and off buses. They got squeezed by DHS checkpoints by the different civic buildings, and routed around aggressive panhandlers. They all smelled like their shampoos and colognes, fresh out of the shower and armored in their work suits, swinging laptop bags and briefcases. At 8 A.M., Civic Center was business central."|"Little Brother"|"Cory Doctorow"
