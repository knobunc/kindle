06:00|"six in the morning"|"“Miss Volker will need you there at six in the morning,” Mom said casually, “but she said you were welcome to come earlier if you wanted.”"|"Dead End in Norvelt"|"Jack Gantos"
05:00|"five in the morning"|"I must have fallen asleep because I was dreaming of Pizarro’s crazed men melting down the golden statues of people into a big pot like when you melt a plastic army man over a burner on the stove when your mother isn’t looking. That’s when my alarm clock went off. It was five in the morning. I knew I had set it for six, but after I fell asleep Mom must have reset it. I was just going to roll over and go back to sleep when she tapped my shoulder and whispered, “Jack, are you awake?”"|"Dead End in Norvelt"|"Jack Gantos"
06:30|"six-thirty in the morning"|"“Sure,” I said, and then she caught me sneaking a peek at the glowing kitchen clock which was in the shape of a giant Bayer aspirin. It was six-thirty in the morning."|"Dead End in Norvelt"|"Jack Gantos"
21:00|"nine in the evening"|"“We are grateful for her community service, especially her years as a school crossing guard where she was much loved by children. An open viewing and memorial service will be held at the Oscar Huffer Funeral Parlor next Friday from six until nine in the evening followed by a potluck buffet at the Community Center, where her exceptional needlepoint portrait of our town’s esteemed founder, Eleanor Roosevelt, will be on display.”"|"Dead End in Norvelt"|"Jack Gantos"
"~ 07:00"|"about seven o’clock in the morning"|"Life in Norvelt was pretty quiet but I could still never get any sleep. Even though it was a Sunday Mr. Spizz stopped by the house and rapped his chunky monkey knuckles crazily on the front door at about seven o’clock in the morning. “Anybody home!” he hollered. The volume on his raspy voice was stuck on maximum and he nearly blew you down like the Big Bad Wolf when he talked. He was a heavy breather on account of his asthma, which was why he didn’t fight in the war even though he had a military flattop haircut that looked like an airport for paper airplanes."|"Dead End in Norvelt"|"Jack Gantos"
00:00|midnight|"By the time he came inside Mom was up to fix him a midnight snack. “How’d the work go?” she asked, and I could hear the ping of her setting a fork on the metal-topped table."|"Dead End in Norvelt"|"Jack Gantos"
16:00|"four in the afternoon"|"“So don’t be too late,” she cautioned. “Old people like to eat dinner at four in the afternoon, and they get ornery if they get too hungry.”"|"Dead End in Norvelt"|"Jack Gantos"
12:00|noon|"For me, heaven mostly looked like the pictures in the Landmark book I read about Julius Caesar in ancient Rome. Everyone wore colorful robes and drove around in chariots and lived in massive stone buildings with tall columns and statues of famous leaders and generals and thinkers. The noon sun was always parting the clouds to show off a robin’s-egg-blue sky and people didn’t so much walk as they drifted just an inch above the all-white stone paths and roads, and they never went the wrong way because in heaven everything you did was always the right way and everything ended the way it should. For some reason the only food in heaven was bread, but the bread came in every shape you can imagine. There were tiny loaves for dolls, and warm dinner rolls, and long French bread, and braided rings of bread, and thick loaves as big and round as wagon wheels, and even entire wheat-colored cottages of crusty bread which when you lived in them were more like yeasty caves in a gigantic mountain of bread, and all you had to do in order to feed yourself in heaven was pull a hank of soft, moist bread right out of the wall. And there was never such a thing as a “last supper” because every night while you slept your bread house was made fresh all over again, and as my mother always said, if you had fresh bread each day then you’d never have a worry. And not having a worry in the world was the definition of heaven. Dad said that he wanted to move to Florida where he could buy a little piece of heaven, and Mom had said Norvelt was heaven on earth. I guess for me heaven was everything good I could imagine. It was always so beautiful to stare up at that white ceiling and imagine only clean beautiful places, where the reward for living a pure life was a great loaf of warm bread."|"Dead End in Norvelt"|"Jack Gantos"
"< 12:00"|"just before noon"|"At first she didn’t look hopeful, but once she recognized the ticket I was holding she brightened up. “We can do an even swap,” she said. “Besides, I think it is for your own good not to get into that plane. It scares me.” Then she glanced at the stove clock. It was just before noon. “But don’t make it too late, as you have to help Miss Volker sack up bags of cookies for tonight’s dinners.”"|"Dead End in Norvelt"|"Jack Gantos"
"ap ~ 02:00"|"about two o’clock"|"I dug and dug until the whole perimeter of the shelter was about as deep as my knee. By about two o’clock each afternoon I wished the Russians would bomb me out of my misery. As I shoveled I worked on my obituary. “Jack Gantos,” I said a little breathlessly, “was born at the Frick Hospital in Mount Pleasant, Pennsylvania, and raised in Norvelt, Pennsylvania, which is a town that is slowly vanishing, and like some Houdini trick it will soon be found in West Virginia. Jack was a good student but learned more from reading books than from staring out the window at school. His parents were total strangers who took him away at birth.”"|"Dead End in Norvelt"|"Jack Gantos"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"“On the other side of the school,” she said. “We’ll start with section D at ten o’clock.”"|"Dead End in Norvelt"|"Jack Gantos"
"ap 09:30"|nine-thirty|"I went back into my rebuilt igloo and gave the evening a lot of thought. Then I did a little planning and preparation and when it was nine-thirty I jumped into action. I walked into my mom’s room and kissed her good night."|"Dead End in Norvelt"|"Jack Gantos"
00:00|midnight|"“I don’t think so,” Mr. Huffer said. “Looks like she had a fit of some kind while having a midnight snack.”"|"Dead End in Norvelt"|"Jack Gantos"
12:00|"high noon"|"As usual, I drove and she talked. “Well, this is a day I’ve been waiting for a long time,” Miss Volker said, and sighed as if a great weight was off her chest. “Now it will all come down to me and him! We are the last two Norvelters standing.”
“Are you going to have a shoot-out at high noon?” I asked.
“That’s not how I operate,” she replied. “He’ll never see me coming!”"|"Dead End in Norvelt"|"Jack Gantos"
