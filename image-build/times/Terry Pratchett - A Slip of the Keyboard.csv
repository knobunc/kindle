03:00|"3 a.m."|"Will definitely get bookcases rebuilt any day now (clever idea was to prefabricate bookcase in garage, everything neatly cut, used set squares and everything, two coats varnish, then all bits brought inside, assembled with proper dowels and glue, hundreds of books in neat array. Interesting science experiment: What happens to wood that has spent weeks in cold damp garage when suddenly brought into warm dry room? At 3 a.m., learned that every bit suddenly shrinks by one eighth of an inch)."|"A Slip of the Keyboard"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|Midnight|"Stare at screen. Turn ideas over and over. Tortoises, bald head, eagles. Hmm. No, can’t be playwright, what sort of person would tortoises instantly dislike?
Midnight …
Stare at screen. Vaguely aware right hand has hit keys to open new file. Start breathing very slowly."|"A Slip of the Keyboard"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 00:30"|"half of one"|"It runs memory-resident programs like Sidekick and the in-comparable Info Select. It runs WordPerfect 4.2 (the classic version). I don’t have to look at a screen like a letterbox, or be forced to use someone else’s idea of the “right” software. It’s got a twenty-megabyte hard disk, which means you can write a novel on it and have it all there, all in one go. There’s half of one on it now."|"A Slip of the Keyboard"|"Terry Pratchett"
22:25|"10:25 p.m."|"Off on BA009, 10:25 p.m. from Heathrow. Watched Mars Attacks; shame Mars didn’t attack earlier, like before this waste of space went into production. Rowan Atkinson and Mel Smith were also in the cabin, so there was understandably a genteel air of silent gloom which meant I could get some sleep."|"A Slip of the Keyboard"|"Terry Pratchett"
05:00|"5:00 a.m."|"This was something originally dreamed up by some fans as a little chat, got bigger at the insistence of the fearsome PR lady who likes my time to be filled edge to edge, and ended up in this big hall with four hundred people. Nice bunch. Someone congratulates me on my deadpan delivery. Haven’t the heart to say that this is because bits of my body think it’s 5:00 a.m."|"A Slip of the Keyboard"|"Terry Pratchett"
12:00|Noon|"Morning doing more media, many of whom I’d met before. One keen guy conducts entire interview with the mike of his recorder plugged into the auxiliary power socket. I didn’t like to point this out, because it would be impolite, so when he found out by himself we did the interview again.
Noon: Small Mainstream Bookshop signing.
A very small shop—250 square feet or so, I’d guess, but with a very mixed and friendly queue that took up more or less the whole ninety minutes allocated. This is one of those shops where the owners seem to know half the customers by name, and probably ring them up to find out how they are if they don’t see them for a month. Couldn’t fault it. Banana daiquiri supplied, entirely unasked."|"A Slip of the Keyboard"|"Terry Pratchett"
10:00|"10:00 a.m."|"Damn—the cooling fan in the laptop has stopped working. Ring up local office of Wasabi Computers, who might be able to fix it tomorrow, except that tomorrow we’re somewhere else.… It might be a software problem, says the engineer, and there’s a fix on their bulletin board, but time is pressing.…
10:00 a.m.: Bookshop in a Mall, Outinasuburba.
Nice big queue and I eye the early arrivals carefully, espying a fan I’d met before. Explain problem. He nips off. An hour later he’s back, and slips me a disk with the freshly downloaded fix. I sign all his books. No worries."|"A Slip of the Keyboard"|"Terry Pratchett"

1:00 p.m.: Small Bookshop, Worralorrasurfa.
Still enough fans around to take the queue to about seventy-five minutes. As a charity wheeze, they can have their picture taken with me. One lady has made me an entire box of origami turtles. No worries."|"A Slip of the Keyboard"|"Terry Pratchett"
08:10|"8:10 a.m."|"Day 6
8:10 a.m.: flight to Arthur.
11:00 a.m.: Interview with Big Radio Journo (said to be first-division media). I was prepared to dislike the man but in fact we got on pretty well; he avoided the usual dumb questions and we had a decent twenty minutes. Sometimes it’s a bit embarrassing to be interviewed by a journalist who’s a fan because fan-type questions don’t work well on air (they say things like “So … is Rincewind coming back, then?” and you can hear a hundred thousand people looking at their radios and saying, “What the — is he on about?”)."|"A Slip of the Keyboard"|"Terry Pratchett"

02:00|"2:00 a.m."|"Back to the hotel, where there’s a letter in the room from the deputy manager, assuring me of his attention at all times. I wake up at 2:00 a.m. at the sound of an envelope being pushed under the door. It’s from the night manager, assuring me of his attention at all times. I think if you stay in this hotel for more than a fortnight you have to marry one of the staff."|"A Slip of the Keyboard"|"Terry Pratchett"
16:00|"4:00 p.m."|"4:00 p.m.: Small Yet Lovely Specialist Bookshop. The owner knows her stuff, so it’s always a pleasure to sign here. Long friendly queue, and there’s a bowl of black jelly beans on the signing table; it is impossible to eat only one black jelly bean. One lady had travelled more than fourteen hours on a train to get to this signing. Sent her a poster when I got home."|"A Slip of the Keyboard"|"Terry Pratchett"
12:00|Noon|"Noon: Busy signing at general bookshop; foreign authors don’t often come here, so everyone’s got everything."|"A Slip of the Keyboard"|"Terry Pratchett"
04:30|"4:30 a.m."|"Up at 4:30 a.m. for flight to Crowtown. Aargh! There’d been a much more sensibly timed flight, which got cancelled. This isn’t life in the fast lane, it’s life in the oncoming traffic."|"A Slip of the Keyboard"|"Terry Pratchett"
18:00|"6:00 p.m."|"6:00 p.m.: Off to a talk organized by one of the morning’s shops, which has managed to browbeat enough people to fit a large hall. And more signing. A few MSS dumpers, but one guy has brought in a flask of Wow-wow Sauce, made to the recipe in The Discworld Companion."|"A Slip of the Keyboard"|"Terry Pratchett"
18:30|"6:30 p.m."|"Back to the hotel for an interview. Journo and I take a taxi across the carpet to the distant sofa.
6:30 p.m.: Talk/signing.
One of the most enjoyable events of this tour. A full house—about 250 people—and I was fairly relaxed so it felt as if it was going well, and it seemed that everyone had a book/books to be signed."|"A Slip of the Keyboard"|"Terry Pratchett"

"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"Currently, I’m writing the next adult Discworld book. What I have is a title. I know that in this story there is a children’s book, and the children’s book is called Where’s My Cow? and Commander Vimes is reading to young Sam Vimes, who is just over a year old. And young Sam Vimes must be read to at six o’clock every night. No matter what the Commander of Police is doing, no matter how serious the political murder he’s investigating, he will go home to read to his little boy out of Where’s My Cow? It is important to both of them."|"A Slip of the Keyboard"|"Terry Pratchett"
06:00|"6 a.m."|"I am pleased to tell you that my heart is holding out very well, but I now intend to write only one book a year. The trouble is that would give me spare time. My wife pointed out recently that the last time we went on holiday I wrote a quarter of a book in two weeks. Well, it was in Australia. It was great. You’d get up early, the birds were singing, there was a fridge full of cold beer, it was 6 a.m., the sun was out, so I sat and wrote, it was great fun. The place we go to in Australia is a little lodge up in the rain forest, but close to the sea. There are no kids and no dogs. Why not? Because the sharks eat them. If the sharks don’t get you, the saltwater crocodiles will have a go. And if the saltwater crocodiles don’t find you, the box jellyfish will. Come on in, the water’s heaving! We like the place. What we particularly like about it is the tennis court and golf course, because it doesn’t have them."|"A Slip of the Keyboard"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"And later one of them said, “I wonder what legends will accumulate around this place in a thousand years’ time, when it’s just a mound. The villagers will probably say that at midnight you can see a team of physicists walk their rounds.” And we agreed that, if people didn’t think very carefully about warning signs, a dead and buried nuclear reactor would make the classic cursed tomb: not long after breaking into it, people would die mysteriously."|"A Slip of the Keyboard"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|Midnight|"Here in America—and in England, to a lesser extent—you can read newspaper articles and buy alleged books which treat the characters played by TV stars as if they were real people. The world has gone strange. You can’t tell the reality from the fantasy anymore. Think I’m kidding? On the racks at the supermarket are “newspapers” like the Sun, the Midnight Star, the Weekly World News. Typical lead story: Elvis has been found alive in a UFO dredged from the Bermuda Triangle. People read this stuff. It’s not even good SF. They have a vote, same as you."|"A Slip of the Keyboard"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|Midnight|"John Masefield’s Kay Harker, in The Midnight Folk and The Box of Delights, did not even need a door, just the vision to see the magical world intersecting with this one and the characters that lived with one foot in each. Writers like Diana Wynne Jones and Alan Garner let their characters wander in and out of a similar magical world—this world, seen from Chesterton’s different viewpoint."|"A Slip of the Keyboard"|"Terry Pratchett"
03:00|"three a.m."|"I can remember the click of the central heating going off and the room growing colder, but these things were happening on the horizon of my senses and weren’t relevant. I can’t remember going home with my parents, but I do remember sitting up in bed until three a.m., still reading. I don’t recall going to sleep. I do remember waking up with the book open on my chest, and finding my place, and going on reading. It took me, oh, about twenty-three hours to get to the end."|"A Slip of the Keyboard"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 01:00"|one|"Strange things began to happen. I began to get royalties, I began to get big crowds at events; at one signing a few years ago where the independent bookshop was stripped of all my titles within minutes of the beginning of an event, the crowd surged down to the nearest Barnes and Noble and did the same thing there. Who would have thought it?"|"A Slip of the Keyboard"|"Terry Pratchett"
05:00|"five in the morning"|"The song of the mushrooms woke me from my bed. And I groped my way into the laid-out clothes and crept downstairs, it being somehow wrong to put the lights on at five in the morning."|"A Slip of the Keyboard"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 05:30"|"half past five"|"In a few minutes I’ve got my ration and my solitary co-picker passes me on the way to the stile at the opposite side of the field. We nod. Speech in a mushroom field at half past five on a misty morning is sacrilege."|"A Slip of the Keyboard"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"It’s not very subtle, but I reckoned that ten o’clock at a British convention banquet (where you have ALCOHOL) was not the time for Oscar Wilde. I don’t know if I delivered this speech, but I must have said something because I got some laughs."|"A Slip of the Keyboard"|"Terry Pratchett"
22:00|2200|"And then I saw another printout underneath it which said that at 2200 my role was After Dinner Speaker, which is something you’d expect to find only in the very worst dungeon, a monster lurching around in a white frilly shirt looking for an audience. Three hours later the explorers are found bored rigid, their coffee stone cold, the brick-thick after-dinner mint melted in their hands."|"A Slip of the Keyboard"|"Terry Pratchett"
22:00|"ten p.m."|"We have a vast repository of old DVDs, so, if we’re not going out or have other plans, we pick one we haven’t played for some time. The absolute rule, however, is that I must always catch the news at ten p.m. I was a journalist once and the stain never leaves you."|"A Slip of the Keyboard"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"We are watching the clock, waiting for Keir Starmer, director of Public Prosecutions, to formally present the new guidelines on assisted suicide.
