thing had happened after this fashion. At the conclusion of the day’s cricket,
all those who had been playing in the four elevens which the school put into
the field against the old boys, together with the school choir, were
entertained by the headmaster to supper in the Great Hall. The banquet,
lengthened by speeches, songs, and recitations which the reciters imagined to
be songs, lasted, as a rule, till about ten o’clock, when the revellers were
supposed to go back to their houses by the nearest route, and turn in. This was
the official programme. The school usually performed it with certain
modifications and improvements."|"Mike at Wrykyn"|"P. G. Wodehouse"

MORNING school at Wrykyn
started at nine o’clock.
At that hour there was a
call-over in each of the form-rooms. After call-over the forms proceeded to the
Great Hall for prayers."|"Mike at Wrykyn"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"A
strangely desolate feeling was in the air at nine o’clock on the Friday
morning. Sit in the grounds of a public school any afternoon in the summer
holidays, and you will get exactly the same sensation of being alone in the
world as came to the dozen or so day-boys who bicycled through the gates that
morning. Wrykyn was a boarding-school for the most part, but it had its leaven
of day-boys. The majority of these lived in the town, and walked to school. A
few, however, whose homes were farther away, came on bicycles. One plutocrat
did the journey in a motor-car, rather to the scandal of the authorities, who,
though unable to interfere, looked askance when compelled by the warning toot
of the horn to skip from road to pavement. A form-master has the strongest
objection to being made to skip like a young ram by a boy to whom he has only
the day before given a hundred lines for shuffling his feet in form."|"Mike at Wrykyn"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
"ap 08:57"|"three minutes to nine"|"It
seemed curious to these cyclists that there should be nobody about. Punctuality
is the politeness of princes, but it was not a leading characteristic of the
school; and at three minutes to nine, as a general rule, you might see the
gravel in front of the buildings freely dotted with sprinters, trying to get in
in time to answer their names."|"Mike at Wrykyn"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
"ap 10:45"|"quarter to eleven"|"Between
ten and eleven on Wednesdays and Saturdays old Bates, the school sergeant, used
to copy out the names of those who were in extra lesson, and post them outside
the school shop. The school inspected the list during the quarter to eleven
interval."|"Mike at Wrykyn"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
12:00|midday|"Today,
rushing to the shop for its midday bun, the school was aware of a vast sheet of
paper where usually there was but a small one. They surged round it. Buns were
forgotten. What was it?"|"Mike at Wrykyn"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"IF the day happens to be
fine, there is a curious, dreamlike atmosphere about the opening stages of a
first-eleven match. Everything seems hushed and expectant. The rest of the
school have gone in after the interval at eleven o’clock, and you are alone on
the ground with a cricket bag. The only signs of life are a few pedestrians on
the road beyond the railings and one or two blazer and flannel-clad forms in
the pavilion. The sense of isolation is trying to the nerves, and a school team
usually bats twenty-five per cent better after lunch, when the strangeness has
worm off."|"Mike at Wrykyn"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
"ap 04:04"|"Four after four"|"But
from the end of school till lunch things went very wrong indeed. Joe was still
in at one end, invincible; and at the other was the great wicket-keeper. And
the pair of them suddenly began to force the pace till the bowling was in a
tangled knot. Four after four, all round the wicket, with never a chance or a mis-hit
to vary the monotony. Two hundred went up, and two hundred and fifty. Then Joe
reached his century, and was stumped next ball. Then came lunch."|"Mike at Wrykyn"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
"ap 03:45"|"quarter to four"|"Unfortunately,
on the present occasion, there was scarcely time, unless the bowling happened
to get completely collared, to make the runs. It was a quarter to four when the
innings began, and stumps were to be drawn at a quarter to seven. A hundred an
hour is quick work."|"Mike at Wrykyn"|"P. G. Wodehouse"

"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"A
comfortable, rather somnolent feeling settled upon the school. A long stand at
cricket is a soothing sight to watch. There was an absence of hurry about the
batsmen which harmonized well with the drowsy summer afternoon. And yet runs
were coming at a fair pace. The hundred went up at five o’clock, the hundred
and fifty at half-past. Both batsmen were completely at home, and the M.C.C.
third-change bowlers had been put on."|"Mike at Wrykyn"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
"ap 06:10"|"ten past six"|"“Two
hundred and twenty-nine,” said Burgess, “and it’s ten past six. No good trying
for the runs now. Stick in,” he added to Mike. “That’s all you’ve got to do.”"|"Mike at Wrykyn"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
"ap 06:30"|"Half-past six"|"From
that ball onwards all was for the best in this best of all possible worlds.
Saunders bowled no more half-volleys; but Mike played everything that he did
bowl. He met the lobs with a bat like a barn-door. Even the departure of
Morris, caught in the slips off Saunders’s next over for a chanceless hundred
and five, did not disturb him. All nervousness had left him. He felt equal to
the situation. Burgess came in, and began to hit out as if he meant to knock
off the runs. The bowling became a shade loose. Twice he was given full tosses
to leg, which he hit to the terrace bank. Half-past six chimed, and two hundred
and fifty went up on the telegraph board. Burgess continued to hit. Mike’s
whole soul was concentrated on keeping up his wicket. There was only Reeves to
follow him, and Reeves was a victim to the first straight ball. Burgess had to
hit because it was the only game he knew; but he himself must simply stay in."|"Mike at Wrykyn"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
"ap 08:54"|eight-fifty-four|"And
Burgess, with the comfortable feeling that he had managed to combine duty and
pleasure after all, wrote a note to Bob at Donaldson’s telling him to be ready
to start with the team for Geddington by the eight-fifty-four next morning."|"Mike at Wrykyn"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
"ap 01:00"|one|"In the next two matches,
accordingly, Bob figured on the boundary, where he had not much to do except
throw the ball back to the bowler, and stop an occasional drive along the
carpet. The beauty of fielding in the deep is that no unpleasant surprises can
be sprung upon one. There is just that moment or two for collecting one’s
thoughts which makes the whole difference. Bob, as he stood regarding the game
from afar, found his self-confidence returning slowly, drop by drop."|"Mike at Wrykyn"|"P. G. Wodehouse"

to when I was a kid. Too old now. Have to look after my digestion. I remember,
three years ago, when Wain’s won the rugger cup, we got up and fed at about two
in the morning. All sorts of luxuries. Sardines on sugar-biscuits. I’ve got the
taste in my mouth still. Do you remember Macpherson? Left a couple of years
ago. His food ran out, so he spread brown-boot polish on bread, and ate that. Got

woke it seemed even less attractive than it had done when he went to sleep. He
had banged his head on the pillow six times over-night, and this silent alarm
proved effective, as it always does. Reaching out a hand for his watch, he
found that it was five minutes past six."|"Mike at Wrykyn"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
"ap 06:30"|six-thirty|"And
outside in the cricket field, the massive mind of the Gazeka was filled with
rage, as it was gradually borne in upon him that this was not a question of
mere lateness— which, he felt, would be bad enough, for when he said six-thirty
he meant six-thirty—but of actual desertion. It was time, he said to himself,
that the foot of Authority was set firmly down, and the strong right hand of
Justice allowed to put in some energetic work. His comments on the team’s fielding
that morning were bitter and sarcastic. His eyes gleamed behind their
pince-nez."|"Mike at Wrykyn"|"P. G. Wodehouse"

Mike had begun to grow reconciled to his fate. The disappointment was still
there, but it was lessened. These things are like kicks on the shin. A brief
spell of agony, and then a dull pain of which we are not always conscious
unless our attention is directed to it, and which in time disappears
altogether. When the bell rang for the interval that morning, Mike was, as it
were, sitting up and taking nourishment."|"Mike at Wrykyn"|"P. G. Wodehouse"

"ap 10:30"|"Half-past ten"|"There
he paused, dusted his trousers, which had suffered on the two walls, and
strolled meditatively in the direction of the town. Half-past ten had just
chimed from the school clock. He was in plenty of time."|"Mike at Wrykyn"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
"ap 10:15"|ten-fifteen|"Now it happened that he
was not alone in admiring the beauty of that particular night. At ten-fifteen
it had struck Mr. Appleby, looking out of his study into the moonlit school
grounds, that a pipe in the open would make an excellent break in his night’s
work. He had acquired a slight headache as the result of correcting a batch of
examination papers, and he thought that an interval of an hour in the open air
before approaching the half-dozen or so papers which still remained to be
looked at might do him good. The window of his study was open, but the room had
got hot and stuffy. Nothing like a little fresh air for putting him right."|"Mike at Wrykyn"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
00:00|midnight|"Mr.
Appleby made his way out of the window and through the gate into his own
territory in a pensive frame of mind. He was wondering what would happen. He
had taken the only possible course, and, if only Wain kept his head and did not
let the matter get through officially to the headmaster, things might not be so
bad for Wyatt after all. He hoped they would not. He liked Wyatt. It would be a
thousand pities, he felt, if he were to be expelled. What would Wain do? What
would he do in a similar case? It was difficult to say. Probably talk
violently for as long as he could keep it up, and then consider the episode
closed. He doubted whether Wain would have the common sense to do this.
Altogether it was very painful and disturbing, and he was taking a rather
gloomy view of the assistant master’s lot as he sat down to finish off the rest
of his examination papers. It was not all roses, the life of an assistant
master at a public school. He had continually to be sinking his own individual
sympathies in the claims of his duty. Mr. Appleby was the last man who would
willingly have reported a boy for enjoying a midnight ramble. But he was the
last man to shirk the duty of reporting him, merely because it was one
decidedly not to his taste."|"Mike at Wrykyn"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
"ap 10:45"|"quarter to eleven"|"BAD news spreads quickly.
By the quarter to eleven interval next day the facts concerning Wyatt and Mr. Wain
were public property. Mike, as an actual spectator of the drama, was in great
request as an informant. As he told the story to a group of sympathizers outside
the school shop, Burgess came up, his eyes rolling in a fine frenzy."|"Mike at Wrykyn"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
"ap 00:30"|"half-past twelve"|"There
was, however, one exception to the general rule, one member of the school who
did not treat the episode as if it were merely an interesting and impersonal
item of sensational news. Neville-Smith heard of what had happened towards the
end of the interval, and rushed off instantly in search of Mike. He was too
late to catch him before he went to his form-room, so he waited for him at
half-past twelve, when the bell rang for the end of morning school."|"Mike at Wrykyn"|"P. G. Wodehouse"

in the air which shows that the sun is trying to get through the clouds. The
sky was a dull grey at breakfast-time, except where a flush of deeper colour
gave a hint of the sun. It was a day on which to win the toss, and go in first.

yorker from Burgess disposed of the next man before he could settle down; but
the score, seventy-four for three wickets, was large enough in view of the fact
that the pitch was already becoming more difficult, and was certain to get
worse, to make Ripton feel that the advantage was with them. Another hour of
play remained before lunch. The deterioration of the wicket would be slow

stood at half-past one. Then Ellerby, who had gone on again instead of Grant,
