So he bought a new automatic coffee machine instead of the old kettle they used in the briefs cupboard...' 'Please, Uncle Tom!' Ballard's mind was clearly on higher things than electric kettles. 'We have decided that, to give the consumer a real service, we are going to run Equity Court on strictly business lines. You may look on me as Chairman of the Board. Claude Erskine-Brown is Managing Director. He will be speaking to our new ideas on possible partnership with solicitors.' 'And how will your new ideas be answering him back?' I inquired. 'Rudely, I hope!' 'The Office Italiano.' Uncle Tom was still remembering things past. 'That was what the machine was called. It was meant to brew up the sort of inky black stuff you used to get at foreign railway stations.' I ' 'We're going to start by working proper business hours.' Erskine-Brown began to outline a bleak future. 'Nine to six and no more than an hour for luncheon! And there'll be a simple life form for you to fill in each week. So we can monitor each member's productivity.' 'How do we monitor your productivity, Claude?' I asked, ourely for information. 'By the number of years in chokey you manage to achieve for your unfortunate clients?' 'The up-to-date Office Italiano machine exploded, destroying a number of original documents, including three wills!' Uncle Tom was determined we should hear the end of his story. 'There was a most terrible stink about it. Poor old Whympering was sued for negligence.' 'We're aiming for a more streamlined, slimmed-down operation here at Equity Court.' Claude ignored the interruption and then tried, unsuccessfully, to be witty. 'Do you think you could manage a slimmed-down operation, Rumpole?' 'Very amusing, Claude. But do try to remember, tell the jokes at Chambers meetings.' 'I hope, in the future, we can get through our business in an atmosphere of quiet efficiency,' Soapy Sam Ballard rebuked us, 'without too many jokes.' 'No jokes at all, if you have anything to do with it. Bollard.' I wasn't to be put down, but then neither was Uncle Tom.
