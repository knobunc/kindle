"ap 05:00"|"Five o’clock"|"“Made some progress,” he said. He hooked the armchair up to the foot of the bed on which Bond was lying.

Wouldn’t be fair to put the stable-boy in the box. Be the death sentence for him. The veterinary has passed the horse, and the real Shy Smile was shot and burned months ago. No. I’ve got my own ideas, and they’re going to hurt the Spangled boys far more than a disbarment from the tracks. You’ll see. Anyway, five o’clock, and I’ll come and hammer on the door just in case.”"|"Diamonds Are Forever"|"Ian Fleming"
"ap 06:00"|"Six o’clock"|"And Bell had bought it. Without any hesitation. And he had asked for the $2000 to be passed to him after the day’s racing in the Acme Mud and Sulphur Baths where he went every evening to take a mud bath to keep his weight down. Six o’clock. And Leiter had promised that this would be done. And Bond now had the $2000 in his pocket and he had reluctantly agreed to help Leiter out by going to the Acme Baths to make the pay-off if Shy Smile failed to win the race."|"Diamonds Are Forever"|"Ian Fleming"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"The Negro took a slate down from the wall above Bond’s head and glanced at a clock high up on the,far wall and scribbled the time down. It was just six o’clock."|"Diamonds Are Forever"|"Ian Fleming"
"ap 06:03"|"three minutes past six"|"At three minutes past six the door opened to admit the naked, scrawny figure of Tingaling Bell. He had a sharp weasely face and a miserable body on which each bone showed. He walked cockily into the middle of the room."|"Diamonds Are Forever"|"Ian Fleming"
"~ 14:30"|"around 2.30 this afternoon"|"“Mebbe you never heard of a horse called Shy Smile, Tingaling? Mebbe you weren’t there when he was rode foul at around 2.30 this afternoon?” The voice ended on a hard edge."|"Diamonds Are Forever"|"Ian Fleming"

Find your way around and-now listen to this carefully-at just five after ten on Thursday evening go to the centre of the three blackjack tables at the Tiara on the side of the room near the bar. Got that?”"|"Diamonds Are Forever"|"Ian Fleming"

The wire-recorder noted that he picked up the telephone and asked for Miss Tiffany Case and after a pause said, “Would you please tell her that Mr James Bond called” and put back the receiver.

"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"The truth of the matter, Bond decided over coffee, was that he felt homesick for his real identity. He shrugged his shoulders. To hell with the Spangs and the hood-ridden town of Las Vegas. He looked at his watch. It was just ten o’clock. He lit a cigarette and got to his feet and walked slowly across the room and out into the Casino."|"Diamonds Are Forever"|"Ian Fleming"
00:00|midnight|"“side the pit-boss, and he was looking at Bond with bright, hard eyes like camera lenses, and the fat cigar exactly in the centre of his red lips was pointing straight at Bond like a gun. The big square body in the midnight-blue tuxedo was quite motionless and a sort of tense quietness exuded from it. It was a tiger watching the tethered donkey and yet sensing danger. The face was ivory pale, but there was a likeness to the brother in London in the very straight, angry black brows and the short cliff of wiry hair cut en brosse, and in the ruthless jut of the jaw."|"Diamonds Are Forever"|"Ian Fleming"
23:55|"five minutes to midnight"|"Bond glanced at his watch. It said five minutes to midnight. He surveyed the big room for the last time, noted that a new dealer had taken over at Tiffany Case’s table, and that there was no sign of Mr Spang, and then he walked out through the glass door into the hot stuffy night and over the lawns to the Turquoise building and let himself into his room and locked the door behind him."|"Diamonds Are Forever"|"Ian Fleming"
"~ 10:00"|"about ten o’clock in the morning"|"At about ten o’clock in the morning, after a swim and breakfast, Bond had decided to get a haircut at the barber’s shop. There were still -very few people about, and the only other customer in the shop was a large figure in a purple terrycloth bathwrap whose face, as the man lay tilted back in the chair, was hidden beneath hot towels. His right hand, dangling down over the arm of the chair, was being attended to by a pretty manicurist. She had a pink and white doll’s face and a short mop of butter-coloured hair and she squatted beside him on a low stool with a bowl full of instruments balanced on the tips of her knees."|"Diamonds Are Forever"|"Ian Fleming"
"ap 04:00"|"Four o’clock"|"But he and the’ girl had their own problems. What time was it? Bond gulped down the cool night air and tried to get his mind to work again. The moon was low. Four o’clock? Bond hunched his way painfully up the platform to the two bucket seats and somehow scrambled over and got down beside the girl."|"Diamonds Are Forever"|"Ian Fleming"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"It was eight o’clock on Sunday morning and there were few people about at the airport, but an official stopped them as they were walking in off the tarmac and led them to a side entrance where there were two young men waiting, one from Pinkertons and one from the State Department. While they chatted about the flights, their luggage was brought round and they were taken to a side door and out to where a smart maroon Pontiac was waiting, its engine purring and the blinds in the rear pulled down."|"Diamonds Are Forever"|"Ian Fleming"
"~ 16:00"|"around four in the afternoon"|"And then there were some empty hours in the apartment belonging to the Pinkerton man until, at around four in the afternoon, but with a quarter of an hour between them, they were climbing up the covered gangway into the great safe, black British belly of the Queen Elizabeth and were at last in their cabins on M deck with their doors locked against the world."|"Diamonds Are Forever"|"Ian Fleming"

12:00|midday|"It was not until the third day out that Bond and Tiffany made a date to meet for cocktails in the Observation Lounge and later to have dinner in the Veranda Grill. At midday the weather was dead calm, and after lunch in his cabin Bond had got a peremptory message in a round girlish hand on a sheet of the ship’s writing paper. It said, ‘Fix a rendez-me today. Fail not,’ and Bond’s hand had gone at once to the telephone."|"Diamonds Are Forever"|"Ian Fleming"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"IT is an intoxicating moment in a love-affair when, for the first time, in a public place, in a restaurant or a theatre, the man puts his hand down and lays it on the thigh of the girl and when she slips her hand over his and presses the man’s hand against her. The two gestures say everything that can be said. All is agreed. All the pacts are signed. And there is a long minute of silence during which the blood sings. It was eleven o’clock and there was-only a scattering of people left in the corners of the Veranda Grill, There was a soft sighing from the moonlit sea outside as the great liner scythed the black meadow of the Atlantic and, in the stern, only the slightest lope in her stride indicated a long soft swell, the slow, twelve-a-minute heart-beat of a sleeping ocean, to the two people sitting close together behind the pink-shaded light."|"Diamonds Are Forever"|"Ian Fleming"
"ap 03:00"|"Three o’clock"|"Bond looked at his watch as he ran back down the silent corridor. Three o’clock. She must have left him some time after two. Should he call the bridge? Give the alarm? A ghastly vista of explanation, suspicions, delays. “My dear Sir. That hardly seems possible.” Attempts to calm him. “Of course, Sir, we’ll do our best.” The polite eyes of the Sergeant-at-Arms who would be thinking in terms of drunkenness and crossing in love-even of someone trying to delay the ship so as to win the Low Field in the Ship’s Auction."|"Diamonds Are Forever"|"Ian Fleming"
00:00|midnight|"Bond glanced at his watch. “Looks as if midnight at full moon is the rendezvous,” he said. “And he’ll be about ten minutes late.”"|"Diamonds Are Forever"|"Ian Fleming"
"ap 11:30"|11.30|"Bond glanced down at his watch. It was 11.30.

Step on it.” And Bond had reached for his coat and had gone into the outer office where he was pleased to see his secretary registering in another bulky file with a Most Immediate tab."|"Diamonds Are Forever"|"Ian Fleming"

"ap 05:00"|"Five o’clock"|"“Not on your life,” agreed Vallance. “Or we’d have had him inside years ago. Anyway, it seems he was contacted by a friend of a friend and agreed to do a smuggling job to America for $5000. Payable on delivery. My girl asked him if it was drugs. And he laughed and said ‘no-better still, Hot Ice’. Had he got the diamonds? No. His next job was to contact his ‘guard’. Tomorrow evening at the Trafalgar Palace. Five o’clock in her room. A girl called Case. She would tell him what to do and go over with him.” Vallance got up and paced to and fro in front of the framed forgeries of five pound notes that lined the wall opposite the windows. “These smugglers generally go in pairs when big stuff is being moved. The carrier is never quite trusted, and the men at the other end like to have a witness in case anything goes wrong at the customs. Then the big men don’t get caught napping if the carrier talks.”"|"Diamonds Are Forever"|"Ian Fleming"

Get a single ticket first thing tomorrow morning. The Embassy won’t give you a visa without seeing your ticket. Car will pick you up at the Ritz at 6.30 Thursday evening. Driver will give you the golf balls. Put ‘em in your bag. And,” she looked him straight in the eye, “don’t think you can go into business for yourself with this stuff.

"ap 08:00"|"Eight o’clock"|"“I, I… that is,” she brusquely turned away from him. “Hell,” she said, but the word sounded artificial. “I’ve got nothing on Friday night.

Bond looked at his watch. “Ten to six.”
“I’ve got to get busy,” she said. With a movement of dismissal she walked towards the door. Bond followed her. With her hand on the key she turned. She looked at him, and there was confidence and almost warmth in her eyes. “You’ll be all right,” she said. “Just keep away from me in the plane. Don’t panic if anything goes wrong. If you work out okay,” the patronizing note came back to her voice, “I’ll try and get you some more of the same sort of jobs.”"|"Diamonds Are Forever"|"Ian Fleming"
"ap 06:10"|"Ten minutes past six"|"Out on the street she paused and looked at her watch. Ten minutes past six. Five minutes to go.

"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"IT was six o’clock on Thursday evening and Bond was packing his suitcase in his bedroom at the Ritz. It was a battered but once expensive pigskin Revelation and its contents were appropriate to his cover. Evening clothes; his lightweight black and white dog-tooth suit for the country and for golf; Saxone golf shoes; a companion to the dark blue, tropical worsted suit he was wearing, and some white silk and dark blue Sea Island cotton shirts with collars attached and short sleeves. Socks and ties, some nylon underclothes, and two pairs of the long silk pyjama coats he wore in place of two-piece pyjamas."|"Diamonds Are Forever"|"Ian Fleming"
"ap 06:25"|6.25|"Bond shrugged his shoulders. He glanced at his watch. 6.25. He looked round the room. Everything was ready. On an impulse, he put his right hand under his coat and drew the .25 Beretta automatic with the skeleton grip out of the chamois leather holster that hung just below his left armpit. It was the new gun M had given him ‘as a memento’ after his last assignment, with a note in M’s green ink that had said, You may need this."|"Diamonds Are Forever"|"Ian Fleming"

"ap 01:50"|"one hour and fifty minutes"|"“Final Lounge?” Cheerful start to flying the Atlantic, reflected Bond, and then they were all walking across the tarmac and up into the big Boeing and, with a burst of oil and metanol smoke, the engines fired one by one. The chief steward announced over the loudspeaker that the next stop would be Shannon, where they would dine, and that the flying time would be one hour and fifty minutes, and the great double-decker Stratocruiser rolled slowly out to the East-West runway. The aircraft trembled against its brakes as the Captain revved the four engines, one at a time, up to take-off speed, and through his window Bond watched the wing flaps being tested. Then the great plane turned slowly towards the setting sun, there was a jerk as the brakes were released and the grass on either side of the runway flattened as, gathering speed, the Monarch hurtled down the two miles of stressed concrete and rose into the west, aiming ultimately for another little strip of concrete carpet on the other side of the world."|"Diamonds Are Forever"|"Ian Fleming"
