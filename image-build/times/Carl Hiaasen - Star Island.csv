"ap 06:09"|Six-nine|"“How tall are you?” Cherry’s mother inquired. She was at a loss for conversation.
“Six-nine. And don’t fuckin’ ask if I ever played basketball.”
“Okay.”"|"Star Island"|"Carl Hiaasen"
00:00|midnight|"At midnight he retreated to his Key Biscayne condo and, as was his habit when under stress, arranged an impromptu debauch. This time the participants were three lithe dancers who were being auditioned for Cherry’s tour. Maury Lykes had spotted them in a Winnipeg theater production of High School Musical and flown them down to Florida, where they each signed a paper swearing they were eighteen years old and had simply misplaced their driver’s licenses."|"Star Island"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 02:00"|two|"So far, Cherry had been behaving herself. On the first night they’d stayed up until two, playing air hockey and taking dorky pictures with some expensive digital cameras that she had said were a gift from a famous fashion photographer. When Tanner Dane Keefe had scrolled through one of the cameras’ memory cards, he’d found some jarringly unsexy shots of Cherry snoozing on a plane with her boobs hanging out. Cherry had acted like she’d never seen the photos before and deleted them one by one, chuckling the whole time."|"Star Island"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 09:30"|"half-past nine"|"At half-past nine, the bellman called to say that Cherry’s security man was leaving the hotel lobby alone. “What’s he look like?” Bang Abbott asked."|"Star Island"|"Carl Hiaasen"

“Go away, Slim.” He went to the counter and returned shortly with a glass of grapefruit juice. “Look at all the fuckin’ pulp,” he remarked with a frown."|"Star Island"|"Carl Hiaasen"

"ap 11:00"|eleven|"“Can’t help you there. What time’s the prom?”
“Chemo will come get you at eleven. Did you find a dress?”
Ann DeLusia laughed. “We’ll make a stunning couple, don’t you think? Me and Señor Chemo.”"|"Star Island"|"Carl Hiaasen"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"“Tell him I’m here for a playdate,” Cherry bubbled.
“But it’s two in the morning.”
“Really?” Cherry slipped past the woman and entered the foyer, calling Tanner’s name."|"Star Island"|"Carl Hiaasen"
12:00|noon|"At Cherry’s insistence, the tatt on her neck became a focal point of the photographs, and Leo dutifully styled her locks in a fashion that gave generous display to the Axl-faced, half-assed zebra. At noon, Tanner Dane Keefe showed up on the set with a DVD containing all his scenes from the upcoming Tarantino film in which he portrayed a corpse-diddling longboarder with the soul of a poet. He and Cherry disappeared into her dressing room for nearly two hours, emerging only when the photo director banged on the door and threatened to give away her cover slot to Christina Aguilera, who also had a red-hot new CD on the way."|"Star Island"|"Carl Hiaasen"

"< 01:00"|"almost 1:00 a.m."|"Janet Bunterman summoned the twins to her suite for a meeting. Because it was almost 1:00 a.m., they assumed that Cherry Pye had snuck out of the hotel and done something outrageous, the usual Saturday-night crack-up."|"Star Island"|"Carl Hiaasen"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"She said, “I’m super hungry, dude.”
“It’s two in the morning. Go to sleep.”
“Nuh-uh.” Sprawled on the floor, Cherry was watching a DVD of a professional choreographer performing the stage numbers from the upcoming Skantily Klad tour. Maury Lykes had sent the disc up to the suite so that Cherry would work on her moves. She couldn’t sing a lick, but on a good night she could dance."|"Star Island"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"Chemo told Tanner Dane Keefe that it was time to leave. Cherry said she didn’t want him to go.

"ap 10:00"|ten|"Ned Bunterman scouted the room for a minibar. He wondered if it was possible that Cherry had tumbled from her crib as an infant and dented her frontal lobe. There’d been several unreliable-looking baby-sitters that he recalled.
“The shoot starts at ten,” Janet Bunterman said.
“Ten in the morning? Yuk.”"|"Star Island"|"Carl Hiaasen"

"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"On that question the sisters were split, so Chemo made an executive decision. He was in no mood to deal with the Buntermans. After dismissing the doctor, he hauled Cherry to the other bedroom and buzzed the housekeeping department, which was accustomed to mopping superstar barf from the master suites. By nine o’clock, when Ned and Janet Bunterman showed up, the carpet was dry and the stink was gone. Most importantly, Cherry had made it through the night without fatally aspirating."|"Star Island"|"Carl Hiaasen"
