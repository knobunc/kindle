Perhaps as he lay in bed, the cocaine fading and his single eye darting around the room to follow atropine hallucinations flitting into corners like ghosts, he had too many hours to imagine the prospect of a life spent groping for scraps of paper like an old man. Perhaps it was the burden of writing an exhaustive story of a single day in Dublin, a day that he insisted on narrating minute by minute and wouldn’t end until well past midnight. After three years of work, it was still only eight in the morning—and he did not have a single completed episode. Perhaps it was the strain of warfare, of never having money, of children to feed and the mounting quotidian problems he could barely manage when he was healthy. Perhaps it was guilt. Nora rushed back from Locarno to be with him in the recovery room, but the doctors refused all visitors until his emotional collapse subsided. It took three days. She wrote letters on his behalf and nursed him while his eye bled for two weeks."|"The Most Dangerous Book"|"Kevin Birmingham"

"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"But Joyce wasn’t rushing. In fact, he had begun working on the “Sirens” episode as early as 1915. Lydia Douce (with her bronze hair) and Mina Kennedy (with her golden hair) are barmaids at the Ormond Hotel, and Joyce imagined them as Sirens singing out to Ulysses as his ship passes their island. The chapter itself was a song: it was modeled after the eight-part structure of a fugue, and in those first pages Joyce adds an overture, an introduction to the musical sounds and phrases that would be repeated, contextualized and vested with meaning over the course of the chapter. In the opening of “Sirens,” the pure sound of the words is what matters. As the episode unfolds, those sounds find their locations in a narrative: the ringing steel of the horse’s hoofs carrying the viceroy past the hotel, the “long in dying” resonance of the blind man’s tuning fork, the jingle of coins in Blazes Boylan’s pocket as he leaves to see Molly Bloom in her bedroom at four o’clock—a meeting Bloom knows about. The overture requires readers to read in bewilderment as the meanings of words dissolve into their sounds. It requires readers to abandon, for a moment, their expectations of what words are supposed to do. They would have meaning in retrospect."|"The Most Dangerous Book"|"Kevin Birmingham"
20:00|"eight in the evening"|"ONE OF THE NEW VOICES was Gerty MacDowell’s. In the late fall and winter of 1919, Joyce was writing the “Nausicaa” episode in small purple notebooks bound with string while harvesting inserts from various note sheets. In “Nausicaa,” Gerty MacDowell, perhaps seventeen years old, sits on a beachside rock near a church. It is eight in the evening, and Gerty is aware that a man (Leopold Bloom) is watching her from a distance. She fantasizes that he is a gentleman in one of the sentimental novels or magazine romances she reads. Joyce wrote Gerty’s thoughts:"|"The Most Dangerous Book"|"Kevin Birmingham"
"ap 06:30"|"half past six"|"JOYCE’S RECORD of foul language began when he was seven years old. His parents sent him to a boarding school twenty miles from Dublin, and the Jesuit institution’s punishment book notes that one of the priests paddled him four times on the hands for “vulgar language.” Joyce was the youngest boy in the school. He proudly announced his age as “half past six,” and the other boys turned it into his first nickname, another kind of punishment. Words were integral to the architecture of power before Joyce could understand it. They had erotic strength not because they were filthy, but because filthy words weren’t very different from moral words. The alphabet that described his depravity also spelled out laws and commandments—the same fabric had innocent frills and shameful stains. What made their letters so thrilling for Joyce was the way they careened between innocence and guilt, the sublime and the obscene."|"The Most Dangerous Book"|"Kevin Birmingham"

Salads and baguettes circulated around the long table, and the host filled glasses with red and white wine. Only one guest was not drinking. As the man in the ill-fitting suit kept declining Spire’s repeated offers, the other guests began to watch. James Joyce turned his glass upside down to prove that he meant it. He never drank before eight in the evening. As a jest, Ezra Pound lined up all the bottles in front of Joyce’s plate in case he should change his mind. Everyone laughed, but Joyce was red with embarrassment."|"The Most Dangerous Book"|"Kevin Birmingham"

Agents arrested more than three thousand people in thirty-five cities around the country—not just in likely enclaves along the eastern seaboard, but in places like Toledo, Des Moines, Louisville and Kansas City. In New York, more than one hundred Justice Department agents paired up with plainclothes policemen and fanned out across the city in army trucks and hired cars. When harsh interrogations didn’t yield the right answers, investigators manufactured confessions of violent antigovernment conspiracies and forged suspects’ signatures. Attorney General Palmer claimed to be acting under the authority of the Espionage Act—the U.S. Senate never ratified the Treaty of Versailles, which meant that the country was still technically at war."|"The Most Dangerous Book"|"Kevin Birmingham"
15:00|15|"Technically, the book would be legal before the ruling against The Little Review was handed down, and Quinn figured Sumner and the DA were less likely to prosecute a book circulating privately than a magazine available to unsuspecting young women. A deluxe private publication could sell for as much as eight to ten dollars per copy, about four times more than the average book. At 15 to 20 percent royalties, Joyce could earn as much as two thousand dollars. All he would have to do is finish his novel before the legal clock ran out."|"The Most Dangerous Book"|"Kevin Birmingham"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"Joyce was writing the final two episodes, “Ithaca” and “Penelope,” simultaneously in the spring and summer of 1921. By then, the novel’s perspectives and voices had multiplied, the Homeric correspondences were more elaborate, Dublin’s June day was becoming a map of civilization and his characters’ flesh and blood were being subsumed into a mythology. By the time Leopold Bloom wends his way home at two in the morning, events unfold as a series of questions and answers, cold and distant, as if spoken by gods looking down upon Dublin from Olympus. In “Ithaca,” Bloom brings a weary Stephen Dedalus to his Eccles Street home after their adventure in Nighttown."|"The Most Dangerous Book"|"Kevin Birmingham"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"The final words of Ulysses would be Molly Bloom’s unbroken stream of thoughts. At three in the morning, as Bloom falls asleep next to her, his head at her feet, Molly lies awake. Unlike the clipped interior monologues elsewhere in the novel, Molly’s consciousness unspools without punctuation in eight grand movements. Joyce thought of her voice as full, relentless and indifferent, more geological than human—not only physical but an icon of physicality. Her body was spread out over the cardinal directions like some Vitruvian Woman looming in his mind, and her thoughts and memories swelled like tides. Since the bombs began falling around Trieste in 1915, the perspectives of his story had multiplied and expanded until now, nearing the end in Paris, “Penelope” completed what Joyce imagined to be his novel’s cosmic dyad. After “Ithaca” tells the story from the edge of the galaxy, “Penelope” turns back to Molly as if to the warm earth revolving in the interstellar freeze."|"The Most Dangerous Book"|"Kevin Birmingham"

Ezra Pound thought an era of civilization was over. Pound declared in The Little Review that “the Christian era came definitely to an END” when Joyce finished the drafts of the last two chapters around midnight at the end of October 1921. He celebrated the epochal change by rewriting the Julian calendar. Year One P.S.U. (Post Scriptum Ulysses) began on November first, which was now Hephaistos. December was now Zeus, January was Hermes, and so on—the index of time shifted from the Roman politicians to the Roman gods. He told Margaret Anderson to reprint the calendar in every autumn issue from 1922 onward."|"The Most Dangerous Book"|"Kevin Birmingham"

Liveright insisted that he was selling the list at its peak (it sold 275,000 copies in 1925), and Cerf had to fight an entire committee to keep his deal alive and sign the contract before his ship disembarked at one in the morning. In the end, Liveright prevailed, and the Modern Library belonged to Bennett Cerf."|"The Most Dangerous Book"|"Kevin Birmingham"

He opened up a small bookshop on Eighth Street called the New York Poetry Book Shop, which was a large room in an apartment building’s basement with a window peeking out just above street level. Roth stayed open until midnight, and he never advertised. His bookshop was unremarkable for Greenwich Village, but with a few dozen reliable patrons, he figured he could eke out a living doing what he loved. He scoured Manhattan for hidden gems and secondhand books to build his inventory, and he eventually discovered a shop in a Park Avenue basement run by a lanky old man who was a connoisseur of contemporary poetry and pornography. Roth visited the old man’s shop regularly until he found it padlocked. The old bookseller was serving ninety days on Welfare Island for selling a copy of John Cleland’s Fanny Hill to an undercover agent, so Roth sent him two dollars a week for the duration of his sentence."|"The Most Dangerous Book"|"Kevin Birmingham"

He had deals on April 29 and 30, May 5, 6, 13, 14, 28 and June 4. These were all weekends. He sent telegrams to various women—Rosamond (“you heavenly creature”), Francine (“Overwhelmed by your pulchritude Please rush rear view”), Marie (“Adoring and sex starved residents demand date of your return”).

Like Joyce, he drafted in longhand and revised repeatedly. By the time he began sketching his Ulysses verdict he was trying to establish his own legal tradition. Woolsey wasn’t going to cite Judge Hand’s definition of obscenity (the two judges didn’t get along), and he made only passing references to a handful of other decisions. “The practice followed in this case,” Woolsey stated in his overview, “is in accordance with the suggestion made by me in the case of United States v. One Book, Entitled ‘Contraception.’” And Woolsey’s Contraception decree declared that Dr. Stopes’s birth control manual “does not fall within the test of obscenity or immorality laid down by me in the case of United States v. One Obscene Book, Entitled ‘Married Love.’ ” It was Woolsey all the way through."|"The Most Dangerous Book"|"Kevin Birmingham"

Reichl, a PhD in art history, had designed everything himself—the binding, the cover, the jacket, the interior—to ensure that every aspect of Ulysses would be cohesive.

After knocking on the door, members and their friends lowered themselves through an opening resembling a manhole and descended a flight of wooden stairs into a large cellar with exposed beams latticing the ceiling. The walls were covered with goblinesque figures in orange and purple performing grotesque gymnastic feats. Golden Calf patrons watched Spanish gypsy dances, shadow plays and poetry readings. Cabaret singers and ragtime bands took their turns on the small stage, and half-drunk couples danced the Turkey Trot and the Bunny Hug, their chests pressed together until dawn. Even the women smoked cigarettes, and their hemlines were well above the ankle."|"The Most Dangerous Book"|"Kevin Birmingham"
