"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"Late in the afternoon, my father, whose name was also Phillip—Phillip Enright—returned home from the refinery where he was working on the program to increase production of aviation gas. He’d been up since two o’clock, my mother said, and please don’t ask him too many questions."|"The Cay"|"Theodore Taylor"
"ap ~ 09:00"|"about nine o’clock"|"I crawled onto the couch downstairs about nine o’clock but I couldn’t sleep. I kept thinking about the U-boats off our coast and those lake tankers with barefooted Chinese sailors on board. I guess I was waiting for the U-boats to send a shell toward Willemstad."|"The Cay"|"Theodore Taylor"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"It must have been eleven o’clock when my father returned from the refinery to get all the flashlights we had in the house. They talked in low voices, but I could hear them."|"The Cay"|"Theodore Taylor"

It sounded almost as if he were talking in his sleep, but the laughter, little bursts of it between the wheezes, was very high and strange. I couldn’t keep the cloth on his head because he was tossing from side to side."|"The Cay"|"Theodore Taylor"
"~ 12:00"|"about noontime"|"At about noontime, the mumbling got worse, and I could feel him trying to get to his feet. I clung to his arm, shouting for him to lie down again, but he threw me aside as if I weren’t there. I could hear him crashing down the hill toward the sea, the frightening laughter echoing back."|"The Cay"|"Theodore Taylor"
"< 12:00"|"toward noon"|"The sun came out strong in the morning. I could feel it on my face. It began to dry the island, and toward noon, I heard the first cry of a bird. They were returning."|"The Cay"|"Theodore Taylor"
"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"By now, I had taught myself to tell time, very roughly, simply by turning my head toward the direct warmth of the sun. If the angle was almost overhead, I knew it was around noon. If it was low, then of course, it was early morning or late evening."|"The Cay"|"Theodore Taylor"

IT WAS ABOUT NOON when I heard the bell.
It sounded like bells I’d heard in St. Anna Bay and in the Schottegat. Small boats and tugs use them to tell the engineer to go slow or fast or put the engines in reverse."|"The Cay"|"Theodore Taylor"
