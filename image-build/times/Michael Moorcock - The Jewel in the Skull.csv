"ap 11:00"|"eleven o'clock"|"'True,' Count Brass agreed. He looked up at the large wall clock that hung over the fireplace. Its golden hands showed eleven o'clock. Its huge pendulum swung slowly back and forth, casting a flickering shadow on the wall. It began to strike. 'We go to our beds early in Castle Brass,' the count said casually. 'We live the lives of country folk, I am afraid.' He rose from his chair. 'I will have a servant show you to your chambers. Your men have been placed in rooms adjoining the main suite.'"|"The Jewel in the Skull"|"Michael Moorcock"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o'clock"|"'Please show our guest to his chambers,' Count Brass told the servant. He bowed to the baron. 'Good night, Baron Meliadus. I look forward to seeing you when we break our fast at eight o'clock.'"|"The Jewel in the Skull"|"Michael Moorcock"

It responded to commands in the manner of a horse, by means of the reins attached to its curved beak, and was so graceful that never once did Hawkmoon fear falling. In spite of the bird's refusal to fly when it rained, it carried him ten times more swiftly than a horse, needing to rest only for a short time at midday and sleeping, like Hawkmoon, at night.

    The high, soft saddle, with its curved pommel, was comfortable, and from it hung panniers of provisions. A harness secured Hawkmoon in this saddle. Its long neck stretched straight before it and its great wings beating slowly, the scarlet bird bore him over mountains, valleys, forests, and plains. Hawkmoon always tried to let the bird come down near rivers or lakes where it could find food to its liking."|"The Jewel in the Skull"|"Michael Moorcock"
