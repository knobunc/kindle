Bingo receives his envelope from Wee Tots on the first of the month, it
is too often his practice, in defiance of Mrs Bingo’s expressed wishes, to
place its contents on the nose of some horse of whose speed and resolution he
has heard good reports, and such horses have a nasty habit of pausing half-way
down the stretch to pick daisies. And this had happened now. A mistaken
confidence in Sarsaparilla for the three o’clock at Ally Pally had not
only cleaned him out but had left him owing his bookie ten quid. This tenner
would have to be coughed up in the course of the next few days, and tenners in
this iron age are hard to come by."|"Nothing Serious"|"P. G. Wodehouse"

said Oofy. “I shall be here till a quarter past one. Slip me the money then,
and the ticket is yours.”"|"Nothing Serious"|"P. G. Wodehouse"

Bingo residence, being one of those houses off Wimbledon Common, takes a bit of
getting to, but he made good time there and sneaking in unobserved was able to
present himself at the club at ten minutes past one. Oofy was still there. The
five changed hands. And Bingo, who had stuck out for eight pounds ten at the
pawnbroker’s so as to have a bit of spending money, went off to the Savoy grill
to revel. There are moments in a man’s life when the club luncheon at
four-and-sixpence is not enough."|"Nothing Serious"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
22:30|"half-past ten p.m."|"So far
so good. A smooth bit of work. But it did not take Bingo long to realise that
before the revels could begin there was one rather tricky hurdle to be
surmounted. Nannie Byles, like the night, had a thousand eyes, and some pretty
adroit manoeuvring would be required if he was to get out of the house without
her spotting him. He had no desire to be called upon to explain to Mrs Bingo on
her return what he had been doing oozing off the premises in the soup and fish
at half-past ten p.m. The statement that he had been on his way to give Valerie
Twistleton a morsel of supper in her absence would, he felt, not go any too well."|"Nothing Serious"|"P. G. Wodehouse"

that everything was pretty smooth. At about ten-thirty he got up, hopped out of
the window, eased himself down the water-pipe, was fortunate enough after
waiting a short while at the garden gate to grab a passing taxi, and precisely
at eleven-fifteen he alighted at the door of Mario’s. And a few minutes later
along blew Valerie Twistleton looking charming in some soft, clinging substance
which revealed the slender lines of her figure, and the show was on."|"Nothing Serious"|"P. G. Wodehouse"

hullo, Bingo,” said Horace, “I was hoping you would look in. I wanted a word
with you. You remember that broken heart of mine? Well, it’s all right. Not
broken, after all. A complete reconciliation was effected shortly before
midnight last night at Mario’s.”"|"Nothing Serious"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
"ap 10:30"|"half-past ten"|"“No, of
course you didn’t,” said Mrs Bingo. “But Nannie declares that at half-past ten
she was walking in the garden getting a breath of fresh air, and she saw you
jump into a cab.”"|"Nothing Serious"|"P. G. Wodehouse"

12:00|mid-day|"TO a man like myself,
accustomed to making his mid-day meal of bread and cheese and a pint of bitter,
it was very pleasant to be sitting in the grill-room of the best restaurant in
London, surrounded by exiled Grand Dukes, chorus girls and the better type of
millionaire, and realizing that it wasn’t going to cost me a penny. I beamed at
Ukridge, my host, and across the table with its snowy napery and shining silver
he beamed back at me. He reminded me of a genial old eighteenth-century Squire
in the coloured supplement of a Christmas number presiding over a dinner to the
tenantry."|"Nothing Serious"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
