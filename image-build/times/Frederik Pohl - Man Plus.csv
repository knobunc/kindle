"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"There had been a time when Roger Torraway hung in the sky for two months and three weeks, along with five other astronauts. They were all dirty, horny and mostly bored. That wasn’t what made him famous. That was just “people in the news” stuff, fit for two sentences on the seven o’clock wrap-up on a dull night."|"Man Plus"|"Frederik Pohl"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"Brad did think of phoning in to see how the recalibration was going, but he really liked showering with a girl, with all the fun involved in soaping each other, and the Chero-Strip bathroom armorarium included bath oil beads, bubbles and marvelous thick towels. It was three o’clock before he decided to think about going back to work."|"Man Plus"|"Frederik Pohl"
06:00|"6:00 A.M."|"We were fully mobilized next morning, checking the circuits, cutting in the stand-bys, insuring that the automatic switchover relays were tuned to intervene at the faintest flicker of a malfunction. Brad came in at 6:00 A.M., weak but clear-headed and ready to work. Weidner and Jon Freeling were only minutes after him, although the primary job for the day was all Brad’s. They could not stay away. Kathleen Doughty was there of course, as she had been at every step, not because her duty required it but because her heart did. “Don’t give my boy a bad time,” she growled over her cigarette. “He’s going to need all the help he can get when I start on him next week.”"|"Man Plus"|"Frederik Pohl"
04:00|"0400 hours"|"The President’s jet touched down at Patrick at 0400 hours. Kayman had been dozing on a beach chair with a throw rug over his legs; he was shaken courteously awake and led to the boarding steps while refueling tankers were topping off the wing tanks in peculiarly eerie silence. There was no conversation, no banging of bronze nozzles against aluminum filler caps, only the throbbing of the tank truck’s pumps."|"Man Plus"|"Frederik Pohl"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"Now that the newspapers had it all the TV reporters had been to see her, and she had seen her own courageous face on the six o’clock report. Fem was sending someone around. The someone phoned first. She was a woman of about sixty, veteran of the lib years, who sniffed, “We never do this, interviewing somebody just because she’s somebody’s wife. But they wanted it. I couldn’t turn down the assignment, but I want to be honest with you and let you know that it’s distasteful to me.”"|"Man Plus"|"Frederik Pohl"
10:00|"ten in the morning"|"Scanyon looked thoughtfully around the table. “All right. We’ve done all we can here tonight. You’re all dismissed until eight—no, make that ten in the morning. By then I expect every one of you to have a report, no more than three minutes long, on where your own area of responsibilities stands, and what we should do.”"|"Man Plus"|"Frederik Pohl"

03:45|"quarter to four in the morning"|"It began at a quarter to four in the morning, Washington time, and the President had himself awakened to see it. “That priest,” he said, frowning, “what kind of a pilot is he? If anything goes wrong—”"|"Man Plus"|"Frederik Pohl"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"“Scanyon,” said the President, “I’m going now. Before you do anything else, I want you to take a look through the papers on your desk and find that paper and read it. Tomorrow morning, eight o’clock, I want you in my office, and then I want to know what’s happening, specifically three things. First, I want to hear that Kayman’s all right. Second, I want that living thing found. Third, I want to know the score on the computer projections, and it better be all right. So long, Scanyon. I know it’s only five in the morning, but don’t go back to bed.”"|"Man Plus"|"Frederik Pohl"
