It did so, precisely on schedule if not precisely on target, at 9:00 a.m. on July 1, 1946."|"Pacific_ The Ocean of the Future"|"Simon Winchester"

With a gigantic whoosh, it suddenly created at first a mile-wide glass-bubble sphere of water and steam and condensate and crushed coral and mud that thundered out of the mirror-calm blue of the lagoon, and out of which erupted, at fantastic speed, a perfectly symmetrical hollow column, a mile high, of millions of tons of near-white water and seafloor sand topped by a ragged cloud of spray and coral debris—and which, caught by cameras as it fell slowly back into the lagoon, remains today one of the iconic images of the time. To those enthralled by matters atomic—and many young Americans especially were utterly captivated—it was to be the perfect wall poster, to be set alongside a pouting Brigitte Bardot and Marilyn Monroe laughing at her billowing dress. The mushroom cloud had already become something of a cartoonable cliché: that there was none produced after the Baker shot—subsea detonations produce much more of a crown-shaped, cauliflower-shaped arrangement, it was realized—made for an originality, a certain coolness, the bomb as a term of art."|"Pacific_ The Ocean of the Future"|"Simon Winchester"

The iron gates guarding some terrible inferno seemed to clang wide open and unleash a ball of fire and shock waves and roarings of unimaginable speed, violence, and loudness. A white fireball four miles across was created in less than one second. A minute later, a cloud of debris ten miles tall and seven across rocketed into the sky. Ten minutes on, it was twenty-five miles tall and sixty miles across. The dawning sky lit up for hundreds of miles, and islanders from faraway atolls looked on in horror—for this was a secret test, unannounced, with no prior warnings—as a gigantic pillar of fire and smoke hurled itself into the air, a mushroom top boiling fuming orange and black miles above it, with rings of new-formed cloud expanding and coiling and writhing around it as it raced up through the layers of the atmosphere."|"Pacific_ The Ocean of the Future"|"Simon Winchester"

One could not plan a schedule to go surfing precisely at 3:00 p.m. next Thursday afternoon. Surfing really took off in the mid-fifties to mid-sixties, which I believe was the height of the fossil fuel “party.” Gasoline was twenty-five cents a gallon, a used car could be bought for twenty dollars, and they were so simple any teenager could work on them.

But whereas the President’s crew was merely imprisoned in Bermuda and then sent home, the Pueblo’s eighty-two surviving sailors were starved and tortured for the better part of a year, until the American government was compelled to make a craven apology in order to have the half-broken men set free."|"Pacific_ The Ocean of the Future"|"Simon Winchester"

The demarcation line runs through the midpoint of the river, so any bridge crossing it would, ipso facto, cross the MDL as well. There is in fact such a bridge, an unattractive concrete affair two hundred fifty feet long, with a North Korean guardhouse at the western end, a guardhouse manned by American troops at the other. It has long been known as the Bridge of No Return, since Korean War prisoners who elected to cross it for postwar repatriation were told that, once across, they could never come back. Captain Bucher and his men were brought to the western end of the structure on the chill morning of Tuesday, December 23. It was nine o’clock. They had had turnips for breakfast.

This third-generation military man, educated at West Point and Oxford, is now long dead, interred at Arlington National Cemetery. He would without doubt be astonished to see how North Korea has endured, and has so case-hardened and strengthened itself in the years since.

But just after noon on a winter’s Monday in Hong Kong, half the world away from her Scottish birthplace, the burning and twisted wreck of this mighty vessel capsized onto her starboard side and slumped down heavily into the shallow, greasy waters of the harbor, never to rise again. The Royal Mail ship Queen Elizabeth, the younger of the pair of great and graceful sister ships that had for decades dominated the grand luxe transatlantic run, had come to her most wretched and unseemly end."|"Pacific_ The Ocean of the Future"|"Simon Winchester"

That morning, barbecues were getting under way on a score of rooftops at the western end of Hong Kong Island and up on the mid-levels of Victoria Peak.

Tung, newly styled) who would become the first Chinese-appointed chief executive of what would now be called the special administrative region of Hong Kong. Mr. Tung was a shipowner, a man with no knowledge of running a country, or even part of one. But that was perhaps not the point.

The document had been signed in June 1898. The lease was for ninety-nine years.
