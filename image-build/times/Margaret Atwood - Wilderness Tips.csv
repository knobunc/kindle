12:00|noon|"It’s odd that Hilary and the other two are here at all, waitressing at Camp Adanaqui; it’s not as if they need the money. (Not like me, thinks Joanne, who haunts the mail desk every noon to see if she got her scholarship.) But it’s the doing of their mothers. According to Alex, the three mothers banded together and jumped Mrs. B. at a charity function, and twisted her arm. Naturally Mrs. B. would attend the same functions as the mothers: they’ve seen her, sunglasses pushed up on her forehead, a tall drink in her hand, entertaining on the veranda of Mr. B.’s white hilltop house, which is well away from the camp proper. They’ve seen the guests, in their spotless, well-pressed sailing clothes. They’ve heard the laughter, the voices, husky and casual. Oh God don’t tell me. Like Hilary."|"Wilderness Tips"|"Margaret Atwood"
"ap 01:00"|one|"He went back to his room and drank most of the bottle of wine. Then he phoned Mary Jo. When she’d negotiated her way as usual past the snoopy landlady on the ground floor and arrived on tiptoe at his door, he pulled her inside roughly and bent her backwards in a tipsy, mocking embrace. She started to giggle, but he kissed her seriously and pushed her onto the bed. If he couldn’t have what he wanted he would at least have something. The bristles of her shaved legs rasped against him; her breath smelled like grape bubble gum. When she began to protest, warning him again of the danger of pregnancy, he said it didn’t matter. She took this as a marriage proposal. In the event, it was one."|"Wilderness Tips"|"Margaret Atwood"
12:00|noon|"She knows he will try to ambush her in the breakfast room. She waits him out, her stomach growling. Instead of eating she packs her bag, glancing from time to time out the window. At last she sees him leaving for the bog, in the Norwegian’s car. There’s a noon bus that will get her to another bus that will get her to a train for Edinburgh. She leaves behind the tapestry bag and the unfinished sweater. It’s as good as a note."|"Wilderness Tips"|"Margaret Atwood"
12:00|noon|"They stopped at noon for a swim and lunch, and went on in the afternoon. At last they reached Little Birch, which was the first campsite for overnight. Lois and Lucy made the fire, while the others pitched the heavy canvas tents. The fireplace was already there, flat stones piled into a U. A burned tin can and a beer bottle had been left in it. Their fire went out, and they had to restart it. “Hustle your bustle,” said Kip. “We’re starving.”"|"Wilderness Tips"|"Margaret Atwood"
"ap 23:50"|"ten to twelve"|"Lois looks at her watch: it’s ten to twelve. She is the watch-minder; Lucy is careless of time. They walk up the path, which is dry earth and rocks, big rounded pinky-grey boulders or split-open ones with jagged edges. Spindly balsam and spruce trees grow to either side, the lake is blue fragments to the left. The sun is right overhead; there are no shadows anywhere. The heat comes up at them as well as down. The forest is dry and crackly."|"Wilderness Tips"|"Margaret Atwood"

"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"Marcia has almost finished typing her column into the computer when her friend Gus drifts by. He says hello to attract her attention, raises his hand in a glass-lifting motion, signals her with a finger: one o’clock. It’s an invitation to lunch, and Marcia nods. This charade goes with their shared, only half-humorous pretence that the walls have ears and that it’s dangerous for them to be seen too openly together."|"Wilderness Tips"|"Margaret Atwood"
"ap > 05:00"|"after five"|"By now it’s after five; the three homeless men are gone. Maybe they will be there tomorrow; maybe she will talk with them and write a column about life on the street or the plight of Native people in the city. If she does, it will change little, either for them or for her. They will get a panel discussion, she will get hate mail. She used to think she had some kind of power."|"Wilderness Tips"|"Margaret Atwood"
