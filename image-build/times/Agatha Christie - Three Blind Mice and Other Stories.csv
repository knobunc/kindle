"~ 02:00"|"about two in the morning"|"Truth  to  tell,  Molly  and  Giles  did  not  have  much  time  for  speculating about  their guests.  Between  them,  dinner  was  cooked, served, eaten, and  washed  up  satisfactorily.  Major  Metcalf  praised  the  coffee,  and Giles  and  Molly  retired  to  bed,  tired  but  triumphant  -  to  be  roused about two in the morning by the persistent ringing of a bell."|"Three Blind Mice and Other Stories"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o'clock"|"Mrs Boyle sat  at breakfast.  There was no  one else in the  dining-room. At  the  adjoining  table,  Major  Metcalf's  place  had  been  cleared  away. Mr  Wren's  table  was  still  laid  for  breakfast.  One  early  riser, presumably,  and  one  late  one.  Mrs  Boyle  herself  knew  definitely  that there was only one proper time for breakfast, nine o'clock."|"Three Blind Mice and Other Stories"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 07:30"|"half past seven"|"So the major was an exercise fiend. Giles had feared as much. It went with his demand for breakfast at half past seven."|"Three Blind Mice and Other Stories"|"Agatha Christie"
