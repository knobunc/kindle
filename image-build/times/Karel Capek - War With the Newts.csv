"ap < 06:00"|"Towards six o’clock"|"Towards six o’clock he again had himself taken in the boat to the kampong, and made straight for that cross between a Cuban and a Portuguese. ‘Toddy,’ he said, and that was the only word he uttered; he sat on the corrugated iron verandah with a thick glass between his thick fingers, and drank and spat and peered from beneath his bushy eyebrows at the scrawny yellow hens which were pecking heaven knows what on the trampled dirt yard between the palms. The half-breed was careful not to say anything and merely filled the glasses. Gradually the captain’s eyes became bloodshot and his fingers began to lack response. It was nearly dusk when he got to his feet and yanked up his trousers."|"War With the Newts"|"Karel Capek"

23:00|"eleven o’clock in the evening"|"The time was eleven o’clock in the evening when our ship’s captain gave orders for the national flag to be hauled down and the boats to be lowered. It was a moonlit night with a silvery haze; the little island we were heading for was, I think, Gardner Island in the Phoenix Archipelago. On such moonlit nights the Newts come up the beach and dance; you can approach them closely and they will not hear you, so intent are they on their silent collective dance. There were twenty of us, stepping ashore with our oars in our hands and, strung out in single file, we began to encircle the dark crowd that was swarming on the beach in the milky light of the moon."|"War With the Newts"|"Karel Capek"
22:00|"10 pm"|"The native population, on the other hand, is most indignant that the Newts should have been allowed to touch drowning persons of higher caste, as they regard the Newts as unclean and untouchable. A crowd of a few thousand natives collected at the harbour, demanding the expulsion of the Newts. The police has the situation under control: only three persons have been killed and one hundred and twenty arrested. By 10 pm peace was restored. The salamanders are continuing their work."|"War With the Newts"|"Karel Capek"
01:00|"one o’clock in the morning"|"That day - it was 11 November at one o’clock in the morning - a sharp earth tremor was felt in New Orleans; several shanties in the Negro quarter collapsed; people ran out into the streets in panic but the tremors did not recur; there was only a violent squall, a brief howling cyclone, which smashed windows and lifted roofs in the narrow Negro streets; a few dozen people were killed; then a heavy rain of mud descended."|"War With the Newts"|"Karel Capek"

After 4 a.m. came the first detailed report: Track between Franklin and New Iberia, seven kilometres west of Franklin, cut by water; appears that earthquake opened up deep fissure running into Vermilion Bay which has become flooded by sea. As far as has been possible to establish so far, the fissure runs from Vermilion Bay in an east-north-easterly direction, near Franklin it turns north, running into Grand Lake, extending thence further north to a line Plaquemine-Lafayette, where it ends in a small ancient lake; a second arm of the fissure connects Grand Lake to the west with Lake Napoleonville. Total length of subsidence about eighty kilometres, width two to eleven kilometres. Epicentre of earthquake was evidently here. By amazing good fortune fissure avoided all major settlements. Even so, loss of life considerable. In Franklin sixty centimetres of mud rained down, in Patterson forty-five centimetres. People from Atchafalaya Bay state that during tremor sea receded by about three kilometres, thereupon came hurtling back towards shore with wave thirty metres high. Fears that many people killed on shore. Still no contact with New Iberia."|"War With the Newts"|"Karel Capek"

The entire coast from Port Arthur (Texas) to Mobile (Alabama) was reported to have been flooded by a tidal wave during the night; there were wrecked or damaged houses everywhere. South-eastern Louisiana (from the Lake Charles - Alexandria-Natchez highway) and southern Mississippi (up to the line Jackson-Hattiesburg-Pascagoula) were covered with mud. A new inlet had opened up from Vermilion Bay approximately three to ten kilometres wide, running inland like a long zigzag fjord almost as far as Plaquemine. New Iberia seemed to have been badly affected but a lot of people could be seen shovelling away the mud that was covering houses and roads. It had been impossible to land. The heaviest loss of life was probably on the coast. Off Point au Fer a steamship was sinking, presumed to be Mexican. Near Chandeleur Islands the sea was covered with wreckage. The rain was easing throughout the region. Visibility good."|"War With the Newts"|"Karel Capek"
"> 04:00"|"after four in the morning"|"The first special editions of the New Orleans papers came out soon after four in the morning; as the day wore on later editions carried further details; by eight o’clock the papers had photographs of the stricken area and maps of the new inlet of the sea. At half past eight they published an interview on the causes of the Louisiana earthquake with Dr Wilbur R. Brownell, a leading seismologist from Memphis University. It was too soon for any definitive conclusions, the scientist stated, but it would seem that the tremors were unconnected with the volcanic activity still occurring in the Central American volcanic belt situated opposite the affected area. Today’s earthquake seemed instead to be of tectonic origin, i.e. it had been caused by the pressure of mountain masses - the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Madre on the one side and the Appalachian range on the other - on the extensive depression of the Gulf of Mexico of which the wide plain of the Mississippi delta was a continuation. The fissure now running out of Vermilion Bay was but a new and relatively insignificant rift, a minor episode in the geological downward movement that had created the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea with the arc of the Greater and Lesser Antilles, that remnant of an ancient continuous mountain range. There was no doubt that the Central American subsidence would continue, bringing new tremors, faults and fissures. It could not be ruled out that the Vermilion fissure was a mere prelude to a revival of tectonic activity centred on the Gulf of Mexico. In that event we might witness enormous geological catastrophes with almost one-fifth of the United States sinking below the sea. On the other hand, if that were to happen, we could expect, with a high degree of probability, that the sea-floor in the neighbourhood of the Antilles would begin to rise instead, or even further to the east where ancient legend spoke of a drowned Atlantis."|"War With the Newts"|"Karel Capek"

"~ 01:00"|"About one o’clock in the morning"|"About one o’clock in the morning - that was on 20 November - radio hams throughout most of Europe observed heavy interference on their receivers, just as if some new, unusually powerful transmitter had gone into operation. They found it on a wavelength of 203; there was a rushing noise as though from machinery or the waves of the sea. From that protracted unending hum suddenly came a terrible croaking voice (they all described it in similar terms: hollow, quacking, as if artificial, and simultaneously enormously magnified by a loudspeaker), and that froglike voice shouted excitedly: ‘Hello, hello, hello! the Chief Salamander speaking. Hello, the Chief Salamander speaking. Stop all broadcasting, you men! Stop your broadcasting! Hello, the Chief Salamander speaking!’ Then another strangely hollow voice asked: ‘Ready?’ ‘Ready.’ Next came a click as if a circuit was being switched, and again another unnaturally squawky voice called: ‘Attention! Attention! Attention!’ ‘Hello!’ ‘Now!’"|"War With the Newts"|"Karel Capek"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"The newspapers, of course, described this nocturnal broadcast as a ‘crude joke in poor taste’ by some pirate transmitter. Nevertheless, millions of people sat by their radio receivers the following night, waiting to hear whether that frightening, fanatic, squawky voice would speak again. It came on the air at exactly one o’clock to the accompaniment of a loud splashing and rushing noise. ‘Good evening, you people,’ it squeaked cheerfully. ‘To start with we shall play for you a recording of the Salamander Dance from your operetta Galathea.’ When the penetrating and shameless music was over the same frightful yet somehow joyful squawky voice returned. ‘Hello, you people! A moment ago the British gunboat Erebus which tried to destroy our transmitter station on the Atlantic Ocean was sunk by a torpedo. The crew were drowned. Hello, we are calling the British government: stand by your loudspeakers. The ship Amenhotep, home port Port Said, refused to hand over to us at our port of Makallah the high explosives we had ordered. She claimed to have received orders to stop all further shipments of explosives. The ship, of course, was sunk. We advise the British government to revoke that order by tomorrow morning; otherwise the ships Winnipeg, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec, all of them en route from Canada to Liverpool with cargoes of grain, will be sunk. Hello, we are calling the French government: stand by your loudspeakers. Recall the cruisers now sailing towards Senegambia. We still need to widen the newly formed inlet there. The Chief Salamander has instructed me to convey to both governments his unshakable wish to establish with them the most friendly relations. This is the end of the news. We shall now broadcast a recording of your song “Salamandria, valse érotique”.’"|"War With the Newts"|"Karel Capek"
01:00|"one o’clock at night"|"The following afternoon the ships Winnipeg, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec were sunk south-west of Mizen Head. A wave of horror swept over the world. In the evening the BBC announced that His Majesty’s Government had issued an order prohibiting the supply to the Newts of any kind of foodstuffs, chemicals, equipment, weapons or metals. At one o’clock at night an excited voice squawked on the radio: ‘Hello, hello, hello, the Chief Salamander speaking! Hello, the Chief Salamander is about to speak!’ And then came that weary, croaky, angry voice: ‘Hello, you people! Hello, you people! Hello, you people! Do you think we shall allow ourselves to be starved out? Stop your nonsense at once! Any action you take will rebound on you! In the name of all Newts everywhere I am addressing Great Britain. From now on we are imposing a total blockade of the British Isles with the exception of the Irish Free State. I am closing the English Channel. I am closing the Suez Canal. I am closing the Straits of Gibraltar to all shipping. All British ports are closed. All British ships in whatever sea they may be will be torpedoed. Hello, I am addressing Germany. I am increasing my order for high explosives tenfold. To be delivered immediately to the Skagerak main depot. Hello, I am addressing France. Speed up deliveries of the ordered torpedoes to submarine forts C-3, BFF and Ouest-5. Hello, you people! I am warning you. If you restrict deliveries of foodstuffs to us I shall commandeer them myself from your ships. I am warning you again.’ The weary voice sank to a husky, scarcely comprehensible croak. ‘Hello, hello, I am addressing Italy. Prepare to evacuate the region Venice-Padua-Udine. This is my final warning, you people. We’ve had enough of your nonsense.’ There followed a lengthy pause, with a background rushing as of a black and cold sea. Then the cheerful, squawky voice was back again: ‘And now, again from one of your recordings, we shall play that latest success, “The Triton Trot”.’"|"War With the Newts"|"Karel Capek"
18:25|"6.25 p.m."|"All preparations for the arrival of the Newts were made with the greatest possible haste; the most luxurious bathrooms were got ready in Vaduz and a special train brought in tank-wagons of sea-water for the delegates’ bath-tubs. On the platform at Buchs in the evening there would only be a so-called unofficial welcome; only the secretaries of the delegations would be present, together with the representatives of the local authorities and about two hundred journalists, photographers and film cameramen. At precisely 6.25 p.m. the Orient Express pulled into the station. From the saloon car three elegant tall gentlemen stepped out on to the red carpet, followed by a number of perfectly groomed secretaries, evidently men of the world, with heavy briefcases. ‘And where are the Newts?’ someone asked in a low voice. Two or three official personages advanced a little uncertainly towards the three gentlemen; but already the first of them said under his breath and in a low voice: ‘We are the Newt delegation. I am Professor Van Dott from the Hague. Maître Rosso Castelli, an attorney from Paris. Doctor Manoel Carvalho, an attorney from Lisbon.’ The gentlemen bowed and made their introductions. ‘So you aren’t Newts,’ the French secretary breathed. ‘Of course not,’ said Dr Rosso Castelli. ‘We are their lawyers. I am sorry - these gentlemen here are probably wanting to film the scene.’ So the smiling Newt delegation was eagerly filmed and photographed. The Legation secretaries present also showed their satisfaction. Very sensible and decent of those salamanders to send humans to represent them. It’s always easier to talk to humans. Most importantly, a certain amount of unpleasant social embarrassment is avoided."|"War With the Newts"|"Karel Capek"
