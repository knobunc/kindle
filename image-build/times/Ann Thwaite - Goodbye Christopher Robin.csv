The great successes of the 1920s were Chu Chin Chow and Hassan, glamorous and specifically exotic musical shows, which fulfilled to perfection people’s need for a good night out. In the straight theatre, the playwright’s best hope was to make people laugh. He also had to remember all sorts of practical things. Theatres were less well-disciplined places than they usually are today. ‘If yours is an 8.15 play, you may be sure that the stalls will not fill up till 8.30 and you should therefore let loose the lesser-paid members of the cast in the opening scene.’ You should be careful not to waste your jokes ‘on the first five pages of dialogue’. There would be a crackle of stiff white shirtfronts, a jingle of beaded evening bags, a shuffle of programmes as the audience settled themselves into their seats. And at the end of the evening the playwright had to remember that many people, living for instance in Chislehurst, would be catching last trains and missing the final five minutes of every play they ever saw, together, of course, with countless renderings of the national anthem."|"Goodbye Christopher Robin"|"Ann Thwaite"

"ap 01:30"|one-thirty|"There is hardly a letter of Milne’s surviving from his son’s childhood which does not mention the child, and very often he sent photographs as well. (‘Which one is Billy?’ asked J. M. Barrie, looking at two unidentified babies in October 1921. ‘I’ll come and find out. Don’t tell me.’) The reviews of Christopher’s autobiography all picked up the same impression as the Daily Mail: ‘The Christopher Robin of the stories scarcely knew the busy writer who was his father.’ That was what Christopher himself thought, looking back fifty years later: ‘If I cannot say that I loved my parents, it is only because, in those early days, I just didn’t know them well enough.’ Christopher may not think he knew his father, but his father certainly knew him. From the very beginning the child dominated the household. Inviting Edward Marsh to lunch to meet him (and ‘that great actress Athene Seyler’), Milne names the time as one-thirty. ‘It has to be 1.30, because Billy insists on his lunch at 1.’ He was then two months old. The following June J. V. Milne, the child’s grandfather, wrote to a friend: ‘Alan says he spends too much time with Billy, seeing all the work before him.’"|"Goodbye Christopher Robin"|"Ann Thwaite"
"ap 06:56"|"four till seven"|"Some people would come to feel the same way about Winnie-the-Pooh. There is no doubt at all, though the links are subtle, that The Wind in the Willows lies behind Winnie-the-Pooh and that, without it, Milne’s book might well not have been written. Milne, like Grahame, remembered his childhood as the great, good time. ‘The queer thing is,’ said Grahame, ‘I can remember everything I felt then. The part of my brain I used from four till seven can never have altered.’ Coming back to the Thames Valley wakened every recollection for Grahame. Milne had no such clearly defined childhood playground to return to, but it was all there inside his head. E. H. Shepard would report that one of the first questions Milne asked him was indeed whether he had read The Wind in the Willows. This was long before he illustrated it (not until 1931) and made the link between Grahame and Milne seem ever closer. ‘I realised even then,’ Shepard said, ‘what a very great influence it had been on him. It all seemed to come from that, and he was quite frank about it. He was an honest bloke; he had an admiration for the book.’ No wonder that when Curtis Brown wrote to him with the proposal that he should dramatise it, Milne responded like this on 15 November 1921:"|"Goodbye Christopher Robin"|"Ann Thwaite"
"~ 16:30"|Vespers|"The critic Humphrey Carpenter pointed out that there was really no need for ‘Beachcomber’ to parody the poem, not long after it first appeared. (‘Hush, hush, nobody cares! / Christopher Robin has fallen downstairs.’) ‘Vespers’ itself is intended to be an entirely ironic picture of childhood. It is interesting that in his memoir of his childhood, Christopher Milne himself disputes what he calls his father’s ‘cynical’ attitude. A. A. Milne was obviously putting it forward so strongly to counteract the general idea of ‘Vespers’ as a sentimental poem about a good little boy saying his prayers. But his son himself felt much closer to Wordsworth’s view of childhood than his father’s. He remembered ‘those first affections, those shadowy recollections’ as ‘the fountain light of all our day’. Adults, though better at disguising it, are often as heartlessly egotistic as children."|"Goodbye Christopher Robin"|"Ann Thwaite"
"~ 16:30"|Vespers|"Alan Milne gave the poem ‘Vespers’ to Daphne as a present. He told her that if she liked to get it published she could keep the money. She sent it to Vanity Fair in New York. It appeared in January 1923 and she received $50. Over the years, ‘Vespers’ proved the most lavish present Milne had ever given his wife. (One remembers that Walter de la Mare is supposed to have sent a son through Eton on the proceeds of ‘The Listeners’.) The following winter Milne would be invited to provide one of the tiny books in the library of Lutyens’s elaborate Queen’s Dolls’ House, which was to be shown at the Empire Exhibition at Wembley before finding a permanent home at Windsor. The whole scheme was ‘ineradicably silly’, Arthur Benson suggested, but it was in the nature of a royal command. It seems only George Bernard Shaw refused and ‘in a very rude manner’, according to Princess Marie Louise; Milne dutifully copied out ‘Vespers’. At least it was short. For many years afterwards there would be copies of ‘Vespers’ hanging in nurseries all over the world, with the words at the bottom: ‘Reprinted by permission from the Library of the Queen’s Dolls’ House’. Milne was already, though he did not yet know it, on his way to becoming some sort of poet laureate of the nursery."|"Goodbye Christopher Robin"|"Ann Thwaite"
"~ 16:30"|Vespers|"As soon as Lucas saw the children’s poems, he realised that they would make a splendid book when there were enough of them, and that, in the meantime, some of them should appear in Punch. It was obviously important to find the right illustrator. ‘Vespers’ had not been illustrated when it first appeared and Harry Rowntree, who drew the pictures for ‘The Dormouse and the Doctor’, was extremely good at animals (he spent days at the London Zoo), but not so much at home in the nursery. Lucas was sitting next to Shepard at the Punch Table, a sociable editorial meeting, when he suggested (so Shepard remembered) doing some drawings and seeing what Milne thought of them."|"Goodbye Christopher Robin"|"Ann Thwaite"
"ap 07:30"|7.30|"By the summer, Ken and Maud were settled at Shepton Mallet in Somerset. ‘He is very brave about it all,’ his father commented, describing how Ken sleeps ‘out of doors, in one of those revolving shelters and at 7.30 Maud comes in her dressing-gown with their early tea,’ across the damp grass. There had been some talk that J. V. Milne might join them in Somerset – he would miss them sorely in south London – but ‘Maud will have all her work looking after Ken.’ There was no suggestion that Daphne would tolerate her father-in-law."|"Goodbye Christopher Robin"|"Ann Thwaite"
"~ 16:30"|Vespers|"This was in a letter to Milne’s brother Ken. ‘Mr A’ was a source of constant interest and speculation at the time. He was, in fact, Sir Hari Singh, whose financial dealings and involvement with a Mrs Robinson were making headlines in the papers. A few days later Milne wrote: ‘The bother is that it’s no good telling you now who “Mr A” is, but of course I knew weeks ago . . . God how I see life . . . Mrs Robinson has refused an offer to appear on the films, but will merely write her life for the papers instead. I want to stand on tip-toe and scream.’ The Lascelles dedication of the extremely successful book of songs – and a further dedication in the second book of songs to the Princess Elizabeth (the present Queen) – added to the feeling that Milne was somehow the Top Children’s poet, and added to the hostile reaction that was beginning to be felt in some quarters. (Stephen Spender, for instance, whose parents had apparently been keen on keeping him from children who were rough, would later speak of the ‘pure horror’ of Christopher Robin.) Most people probably thought the dedication wholly appropriate and Milne kept his own feelings about royalty to himself most of the time. But on one occasion he could not help speaking out. He was dining at a private house and one of the other guests was Princess Marie Louise, granddaughter of Queen Victoria. It was she who had organised the Queen’s Dolls’ House not long before and she was graciously interested in A. A. Milne, whose tiny leather-bound ‘Vespers’ was in that exclusive library. ‘I talked to her for about an hour after dinner, said “Ma’am” as little as possible, put my foot in it once or twice probably, withdrew it with a loud sucking noise and continued cheerfully.’ The princess was foolish enough to lament to him ‘the objection to work shown by the lower classes’. Milne swallowed and murmured that, indeed, ‘every one of my friends would rather win £50,000 in a sweepstake than by working for it’. It was the best he could do on the spur of the moment. Her Royal Highness could perhaps hardly believe that the man she was talking to, whom, of course, she had supposed to be a gentleman, was identifying himself and his friends with ‘the lower classes’. Milne reported to Ken, ‘She didn’t say anything, but a faint twinge of pain seemed to pass across her face, as if the first violinist were playing out of tune. Very sad.’"|"Goodbye Christopher Robin"|"Ann Thwaite"
"~ 16:30"|Vespers|"Milne was not yet wary of allowing the child to become involved in the public reaction to the book. There was some discussion over whether to take him to the private view of an exhibition of Shepard’s illustrations to When We Were Very Young, but that was probably because he might not enjoy the occasion. At this stage Milne’s son had barely heard the words ‘Christopher Robin’ and most of the boys in Shepard’s illustrations were certainly not him. Their hair was much shorter for one thing, though you couldn’t always see it because of the hats. It was because of the dedication that it was his book; it was written for him. He was there, of course, in ‘Hoppity’, in ‘Buckingham Palace’, in ‘Vespers’ and in ‘Sand-between-the-toes’, and he felt he was there in some of the others. But he was not, like Tootles in Peter Pan, dazzled by being in a story. It all seemed perfectly natural. Daphne suggested it seemed no more extraordinary than it did to other children to find their pictures in the family photograph album. None of Milne’s stories of Billy at this time suggest the shy creature of Christopher Milne’s memories. It is impossible not to think that he was made shy, and his natural confidence eroded, by the attention he received in the following years. If Christopher Robin had played a minor part in When We Were Very Young, in the next book he would take a starring role."|"Goodbye Christopher Robin"|"Ann Thwaite"

"~ 16:30"|Vespers|"J. V. Milne took a particular pleasure in his son’s new kind of success. It was as if he had been waiting all the time for the children’s books. He relished every sales figure, every sign of their widespread fame (Pooh prints being given away with Home Chat, ‘Vespers’ being sung on the wireless). Alan wrote to Ken: ‘Father seems so terribly happy and excited that he makes me feel ashamed of not having made him happy before.’"|"Goodbye Christopher Robin"|"Ann Thwaite"
"~ 16:30"|Vespers|"One of Christopher’s cousins remembered the record well and thought it ‘the unacceptable face of Poohdom’. That was not so much ‘the sound of the record as the idea’. As for the record itself, ‘it was the voice of a small boy who was obviously musical – dead in tune and sweet of tone – and who was obviously giving the performance all he’d got. (Perhaps this added to my feeling that the poor child was being exploited.) There were four songs – “Vespers”, “Buckingham Palace”, “Fishing” and the one about the train brake that didn’t work.’"|"Goodbye Christopher Robin"|"Ann Thwaite"
"~ 16:30"|Vespers|"It was ‘Vespers’, however, that returned to haunt him years later when boys in the next study at Stowe would play it over and over again, remorselessly. It was ‘intensely painful’ for the singer. ‘Eventually the joke, if not the record, wore out, they handed it to me’ (the record not the joke) ‘and I took it and broke it into a hundred fragments and scattered them over a distant field.’ Years later, his cousin Angela allowed her children to hang the record on a tree, a string through the hole in the middle, and to throw things at it. One wonders how many copies remain in attics along with Ernest Lush singing ‘O for the Wings of a Dove’ and Harry Lauder’s ‘I Love a Lassie’."|"Goodbye Christopher Robin"|"Ann Thwaite"
"~ 16:30"|Vespers|"The most important thing for Alan Milne in the 1930s was his relationship with his son. As Christopher himself put it in The Enchanted Places: ‘My father, who had derived such happiness from his childhood, found in me the companion with whom he could return there.’ Not long after Ken’s death, the time had come for Olive Rand, to whom Christopher had been so devoted, to leave. At last she felt free to marry; Milne furnished her cottage, which she called Vespers, as a wedding present. At nine, Christopher was off to a boarding prep school, but in the holidays there would be no one to come between father and son, as there always had been when the boy’s first love was his nanny."|"Goodbye Christopher Robin"|"Ann Thwaite"

In short, I adore him.’ Christopher, who had described his father as ‘buttoned up all through his life’, did not of course read this letter until he came across it in my biography. It was at this point that boys in the next study at Stowe were playing the record of ‘Vespers’ over and over again on their wind-up gramophone and driving the ‘happy darling’ into despair. He was very vulnerable, but most of the time he could forget the books and the bear and get on with his work. He was an even better mathematician than his father, but his cricket, which might have helped him, did not fulfil his father’s hopes; he got no further than the Third Eleven."|"Goodbye Christopher Robin"|"Ann Thwaite"
