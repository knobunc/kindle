breakfasted, Jeeves informed me that E. Jimpson could see me
at eleven, and I thanked him and asked him to tell the garage
to send the car round at ten-forty-five."|"Aunts Aren't Gentlemen"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
"ap 01:30"|One-thirty|"'Certainly not,' I agreed. If the Drones Club tie has a fault,
it is a little on the loud side and should not be sprung suddenly
on nervous people and invalids, and I had no means of
knowing if Mrs Briscoe was one of these. 'What time is the
binge?'
'One-thirty.'
'Expect me then with my hair in a braid.'"|"Aunts Aren't Gentlemen"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
12:00|mid-day|"The afternoon had now hotted up to quite a marked extent,
and what with a substantial lunch and several beakers of
port I was more or less in the condition a python gets into after
its mid-day meal. A certain drowsiness had stolen over me, so
much so that twice in the course of my narrative the aged r.
had felt compelled to notify me that if I didn't stop yawning in
her face, she would let me have one on the side of my fat head
with the parasol with which she was shielding herself from the
rays of the sun."|"Aunts Aren't Gentlemen"|"P. G. Wodehouse"

decent inn in the place. Go there and tell him to meet me here
at three o'clock tomorrow afternoon.'"|"Aunts Aren't Gentlemen"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
"ap 03:00"|three|"'No, very short. In and out like a flash, Just had time to say
you were like a knight in shining armour riding up on a white
horse and to tell me to tell you to show up at my address
tomorrow at three on the dot, and she was off.'"|"Aunts Aren't Gentlemen"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
"ap 03:00"|"three o'clock"|"'We were, Jeeves, and I am glad to say that I no longer need
your advice. During your absence the situation has become
clarified. A meeting has been arranged and will shortly take
place, in fact here at this cottage at three o'clock tomorrow
afternoon. I, not wishing to intrude, shall be going for a walk.'"|"Aunts Aren't Gentlemen"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
"ap 02:55"|"five minutes to three"|"At five minutes to three on the following afternoon I had
girded my loins and was preparing to iris out, when
Vanessa Cook arrived. The sight of me appeared to displease
her. She frowned as if I were something that didn't smell just
right, and said:"|"Aunts Aren't Gentlemen"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
"ap 06:00"|"six o'clock"|"'Then bung him in, Jeeves. There is no one I'd rather give
audience to.'
And the hour, which was getting on for six o'clock,
produced the man.
I was struck, as before, by the intense respectability of his
appearance. He looked as though no rabbit or pheasant need
entertain the slightest tremors in his presence, and one could
readily picture him as the backbone of the choir when anthem
time came along. His gentle 'Good evening, sir' was a treat to
listen to."|"Aunts Aren't Gentlemen"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
"ap 02:15"|"two hours and a quarter"|"And, by Jove, I suddenly realized I couldn't. It would have
involved a long character analysis of Sir Watkyn Bassett,
another of my Uncle Tom, a third of Stephanie (Stiffy) Byng,
now Mrs Stinker Pinker, a fourth of Jeeves, and would have
taken about two hours and a quarter, provided he listened
attentively and didn't interrupt, which of course he would have
done."|"Aunts Aren't Gentlemen"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
"~ 17:00"|"About five in the afternoon"|"'Not if you select your time properly,' I said. 'What time was
it you made your other try?'
'About five in the afternoon.'
'As I suspected. No wonder he gave you the bum's rush.
Five in the afternoon is when a man's sunny disposition is
down in the lowest brackets. Lunch wore off hours ago, and
cocktails are not yet in sight. He isn't in the mood to oblige
anyone about anything. Cook may be a hard-boiled egg, but
dinner softens the hardest. Approach him when he is full to
the brim, and you'll be surprised. Fellows at the Drones have
told me that, applying after he had tucked into the evening
meal, they have got substantial loans out of Oofy Prosser.'"|"Aunts Aren't Gentlemen"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
