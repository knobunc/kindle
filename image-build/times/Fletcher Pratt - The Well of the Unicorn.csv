12:00|noon|"AIRAR HAD been in Naaros often enough but never with five pieces of gold and all time to himself, so it was new. He wandered among shops, was beset to avoid slops, took his noon meal in a cook-stall where he left his pack in care, and found the temptation to buy strong till the very moment of entering the shop to chaffer. Then he would reflect that he bore his only home on his back, like a turtle; therefore ended by purchasing not even what he might in another mood have wished, like a beautiful little grimoire to fit the pocket, in the Street of the Booksellers. He went near neither the street where his father's brother kept house and artisanship in the name of Fabrizius, nor the dock where the latter had told him the cog Unicorn would lie—no, death's resort, both—though from the street of the piers he could see tall masts rising and catch the pungent whiff of spices from Uravedu and the South Isles; and it was of regret that the chance to sail thither had come in such a form."|"The Well of the Unicorn"|"Fletcher Pratt"
12:00|noon|"Little enough he got out of Airar so weary, who knew nothing of these matters anyway; and they ate cold at noon, where a brook came down sharply from the shoulder of the mountain over stones, bread and meat from Rogai's saddle-bag. He stood up with an air of decision when the meal was over. ""That nag of yours,"" said he, ""is something less than a racer, but you must push her. We have a long journey to the nearest inn and it's well to remember how sea-demons beset this road by night."""|"The Well of the Unicorn"|"Fletcher Pratt"
12:00|noon|"He followed Gython through the door to find Rudr sharp enough because his noon meal was unready, and little wishful to see her so blamed, tried to distract the old man with talk of magic, sea-demons, and the other ships of the fleet. The end of that converse might have been foretold— out came the story of Meliboe the enchanter's doubledealing which Airar himself had hardly realized till he began to talk on it, with the foul things the magician had put aboard the vessels. Now Airar found himself pressed into promising that he would lay protections on all the skonar-ships of the fleet as he had on Rudr's own iulia. The prospect was little pleasing; nor were matters helped any by the arrival during the afternoon of a woman with a lined severe countenance and a tongue that seemed to wag double, who said that her house was overrun with a plague of rats and would have Airar give her a spell to drive them out. The more he tried to put her off, the longer she talked; and louder to keep her quiet he finally inscribed a bit of parchment with certain names of ill omen, as An gat, Huard,
Utesitorion, with a picture of the unhappy bergamot flower, telling her to soak it at midnight in the fat of a hog and leave it in a fall-trap."|"The Well of the Unicorn"|"Fletcher Pratt"

00:00|midnight|"Airar sat up, trying to shake from his head the fumes of wine and sleep and the thought that here was a second midnight warning to a purport heard before, though how could one ask more of Duke Roger than his proceeding at the muster? ""What's here?"""|"The Well of the Unicorn"|"Fletcher Pratt"
12:00|noon|"Now they were on harder ground, with bush, as marshedge thorn, low juniper, and an occasional yew, frosting fast with falling snow. Airar called in the picquet and a consultation was held, with some for camping against the growing blast, but Erb said gentour parties would be across the whole countryside when the weather cleared, seeking wreck and plunder from the battle. Press on, therefore, in a tighter knot; but as the hour drew maybe past a noon that none could see, it was clear that press on could be carried little farther and Svarlog had the shivers."|"The Well of the Unicorn"|"Fletcher Pratt"
00:00|midnight|"—Now you must know that the Count Vulk was at this time young, having been elect to his dignity by his eighteenth year, which is a thing almost unheard-of and only because of the great valiancy and the high name of his father. It is said also that he was the handsomest of the Vulks, tall as a tree, with hair smooth and black like midnight, gay eyes and ever a laugh in his voice, a very fortunate and perfect prince. After the great battle in the Dales, he went up to Stavorna city, where thanks were offered in the church for deliverance, and there was a banqueting afterward in the hall of the syndics. Oh, the bright plate and the clean white napkins and the brave meats they served, with music among a thousand candle-flames at that banquet, and young Vulk the merriest of all, leading in song.—"|"The Well of the Unicorn"|"Fletcher Pratt"
"ap 01:00"|one|"—By the Well, cried he, here's one that could love all night! How of it, sweetling, shall we make the song came true? And he clapped his arm round her—an evil deed, sirs and gentles, but he was young and without thought and from such we are given to learn."|"The Well of the Unicorn"|"Fletcher Pratt"
12:00|noon|"Morning come, they were on the road again and a hard road, with pents and shoulders. A croft was met by noon, high in a vale with goats grazing round. It had a thatched roof and a vacuous-faced master, who stared at all these armed soldiers in company, and would say few words to them, nor answer when there was chanted:"|"The Well of the Unicorn"|"Fletcher Pratt"
00:00|midnight|"Why?—why? There was Evadne now, the Carrhoene, and her open speech of making him her future, barely heard in the haste of preparing to meet the deese, now risen to plague his midnight thought. She was older than he, aye; yet the dusky olive of her skin and swelling breast it would be sweet to press—or would it so? Something deep down recoiled with a crawl, as though an enchantment lay on her to counter desire, not that which Meliboe had placed to draw her to him. Or that itself; a pang of pain and the thought of another drawing enchantment he himself had raised (he resolutely kept his mind from forming the name), and how he drifted along the thought of these magics, magics, and how ill each had sped at the end—the shapechange that brought Rogai only into deadly danger at Mariupol; Meliboe's spell, with death for Britgalt and his sons in the snowstorm; the evil fate of the enchanting and disenchanting of the ships against sea-demons; the night of the tower in Salmonessa (a white flash before the eyes and one must not think of that) . . . was any of all the magics good? The night in the marsh when it saved them from the Vulkings—No; for that was a treachery by Meliboe on those who trusted him; and the divination of that night had held him from going to Salmonessa, where he might have saved her."|"The Well of the Unicorn"|"Fletcher Pratt"
12:00|noon|"They were still sloping upward, with the streams running south and easterly to join the affluents of the Naar, and near one of these rills stopped for noon meat, packing up into a closer group among some shelving rocks along the bank, where the wet from the previous night was less. Airar snipped off bits of his meat for the kitten, which ate greedily, where Evimenes found him. ""I do not like it,"" said the Star-Captain, with puckering brows. ""It was full light when we passed the castella and surely they saw us. Soon or late, if that leader knows his business, we shall have gentours on our track, riding light and faster than we, with our wounded men and baggage cattle, their object being to annoy and delay till the heavy-armed come."""|"The Well of the Unicorn"|"Fletcher Pratt"
"<< 12:00"|"long before noon"|"Airar said yes to that and it was a risen meeting. They rode. The High Hills of Froy were now all round, a country little peopled save by charcoal burners and such shy folk, so it was not to be expected that many would be met; yet it was somewhat grating to have no further word from Rogai. The night camp was by the earliest of those lakes which fill all the bowls of the hills, the more particularly westward toward rainy Shalland. Guards were set well toward the rear, and next morning, as being somewhat short of victual, the more part kept camp while the rest went out to see what could be had among the trees. Airar's own bow brought in a wild pig, and there were other small items, but it was long before noon when all let themselves be engaged by Evimenes to take the trail again. Summit of day and pass came together; now they were in Shalland, and a little beyond the way swung left between a pair of hilltops to open out a lake with a lawn beside it and a house set midmost of the lawn, not very great."|"The Well of the Unicorn"|"Fletcher Pratt"
12:00|noon|"Winged Wolf under which Dalarna fell. Airar now went thoughtful. By noon they were all across but one little knot of three of Rogai's men that had not come in. As they stood together on the low farther shore, they could see some gentours caracole and brandish spears on the bank they had left."|"The Well of the Unicorn"|"Fletcher Pratt"
"ap 03:57"|"three of four"|"The Vulkings had a ligh up there behind their shot-window. Airar saw it occluded as those within let go another of their stone-hearted balls. There was a wait, then the thud-shatter as it struck down along the battlement where the torches were placed, with mocking yells from the men of Carrhoene. Pleiander was unpleased. ""They overreach us from their height,"" he cried. ""Relax winding! Astyanax, get me three of four crossbow bolts; we'll leash them together and try a fire-shaft from the catapult; the wings may carry it high enough to tiddy them a trifle."" He turned, saw Airar: ""What, still here? Go, I said; begone until you come caparisoned. All lives are valuable, even yours, since that Baron Carina yonder's evident a pretty fellow that knows his leaguers, and there'll be sword-play for all before we're done."""|"The Well of the Unicorn"|"Fletcher Pratt"
12:00|noon|"""What's here?"" he asked himself and sought Alsander. The Carrhoene was not less struck than himself and the two went at once to beg Earl Mikalegon for a full leaders' council, though it were barely noon. They were assembled after much shouting and scuttling round the court. Airar told his tale of the chance phrase while Pleiander picked his lower lip and the black brows of the Earl drew in to frown. All tried to speak at once; Mikalegon brought down his fist:"|"The Well of the Unicorn"|"Fletcher Pratt"
12:00|noon|"THAT STHENOPHON had right in keeping his ships from voyaging among the storms of autumn was soon clear; the row-galley took water heavily and by noon was almost awash below, so dangerous that Erb put her poop to the wind, which brought the prow slanting in toward the coast of Norby. The gust held steadily from north-northwest, allowing them to hang out squaresails and give some rest to those at the oars. The Carrhoenes, who use such craft by habit, might have done better with this one, but of the hundred and seven men aboard there was only one Carrhoene, and he a sergeant's servant—the rest all Dalecarles of Airar's following or free companions, with some eight women, including Evadne, the shield-girl, the Star-Captain."|"The Well of the Unicorn"|"Fletcher Pratt"
"> 12:00"|"after noon"|"Again a day and scouts said the Vulkings had come down to pitch camp soon after noon, which was against their custom, but they had surrounded it with a rapid stockade as usual. They clearly knew where Dalarna's forces lay and meant to fight right through. A force of gentours had with much difficulty been ferried westward across to the left bank of the Naar, and through the twilight began to filter among trees there, down toward Dalarna's archer-flank. Airar turned the Hestinga horsemen thither to hold them, though it meant losing part of his surprise at the center and uncovering the Skogalang men to attack by the bridges. He had not thought the Vulkings meant to find a way round, but Alsander made light of it all. ""In war the captain against is always sure to find something one's forgot. Why, down in Uravedu—"""|"The Well of the Unicorn"|"Fletcher Pratt"
