"ap 01:15"|One-Fifteen|"""I've got thirty-two men, including Lieutenant Warden, Major."" The cough of flechette guns and rattle of rifles came over the link with Young's voice. ""We're taking heavy fire from One-Fifteen and One-Seventeen, and they've cut One-Sixteen at the lift, but I blew the Morgue before they got in."""|"The Honor of the Queen"|"David Weber"

I was prepared to learn their fears were exaggerated, but after studying their intelligence reports and the public record, it's my opinion, Mr. Houseman, that they have in fact understated the case. Yes, they have a stronger industrial base, but the other side outnumbers them three-to-one, and they need most of that industry simply to survive their planetary environment! If you'd bothered to examine their library data base, or even the precis Ambassador Langtry's staff have assembled, you'd know that. You haven't, and I have absolutely no intention of allowing your uninformed opinions to color the official position of this mission."""|"The Honor of the Queen"|"David Weber"
