"ap 05:20"|five-twenty|"""The Grayson yard people confirm Alistair's original estimate,"" Truman replied. ""It's completely gone, and they can't repair it. Their Warshawski technology's even cruder than I thought, and their components simply won't mate with ours, but their standard impellers are a lot closer to our levels, and Lieutenant Anthony got with their chief shipwright before I sent Troubadour off with the freighters. By the time she gets back, the Graysons should have run up jury-rigged beta nodes to replace the damaged beta and alpha nodes. She still won't have Warshawski capability, but she'll be back up to five-twenty gees for max acceleration."""|"The Honor of the Queen"|"David Weber"
"ap 07:17"|Seven-Seventeen|"""Ma'am, I-"" The fire ahead rose to a crescendo, then died, and Talon listened to her command net. ""That's it. They're clear to Corridor Seven-Seventeen."" She gave Honor another glare. ""This time, stay behind me, Captain!"""|"The Honor of the Queen"|"David Weber"
"ap 01:15"|One-Fifteen|"""I've got thirty-two men, including Lieutenant Warden, Major."" The cough of flechette guns and rattle of rifles came over the link with Young's voice. ""We're taking heavy fire from One-Fifteen and One-Seventeen, and they've cut One-Sixteen at the lift, but I blew the Morgue before they got in."""|"The Honor of the Queen"|"David Weber"

"ap 00:57"|three-to-one|"""The reason these people are expanding their population after centuries of draconian population control, the reason they need those orbital farms, is that Masada is getting ready to wipe them out and they need the manpower to fight back. I was prepared to learn their fears were exaggerated, but after studying their intelligence reports and the public record, it's my opinion, Mr. Houseman, that they have in fact understated the case. Yes, they have a stronger industrial base, but the other side outnumbers them three-to-one, and they need most of that industry simply to survive their planetary environment! If you'd bothered to examine their library data base, or even the precis Ambassador Langtry's staff have assembled, you'd know that. You haven't, and I have absolutely no intention of allowing your uninformed opinions to color the official position of this mission."""|"The Honor of the Queen"|"David Weber"
