"ap 10:00"|"ten o'clock"|"The next day, being Sunday, began with the early morning service at the church in Shadoxhurst. At ten o'clock the Keetons returned home and packed a picnic hamper. Shortly before noon the three of them set off across Windy Cave Meadow, towards Fox Water and beyond. They followed a dry track along the dense hedgerows between adjacent farms, and very soon Tallis realized, with a combined sense of fear and excitement, that they were walking towards Ryhope Wood."|Lavondyss|"Robert Holdstock"

"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"It was a lovely evening, cool and clear, just beginning to fall towards dusk. Evensong was being tolled from the church at Shadoxhurst, the sound of the bell a faint and pleasant chime on the summer's air. Tallis went down to the Wyndbrook, Hunter's Brook, and moved slowly among the trees. She wondered whether she should take a chance and cross the unnamed field to Ryhope Wood. She longed to visit the ruined house again and she was often strongly tempted to risk that visit. But against that thought was the feeling that the house was something… something not of her. Whereas Morndun Ridge, like the alley, like Windy Cave Meadow, was a place of her own creation."|Lavondyss|"Robert Holdstock"
00:00|midnight|"But by midnight she was distressed. Because, for all of the insight—whether right or wrong—she felt most strongly for the dying man."|Lavondyss|"Robert Holdstock"
00:00|midnight|"He was gentle, now. He had been upset at midnight, and frightened too. Now, he explained to her, he was just anxious. There was something wrong with his daughter and that worried him. The way she was behaving was so unlike her. Whatever had upset her was very real to her. He had decided to do a little probing for the source of the concern."|Lavondyss|"Robert Holdstock"
12:00|mid-day|"He felt the bottoms of his feet, then tugged on his boots and stood up. ""It all begins at mid-day, doesn't it?"" And added, ""I thought so,"" as Tallis silently affirmed. ""Well, there's just time for a bite of breakfast. By the way, do you know any songs?"""|Lavondyss|"Robert Holdstock"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o'clock"|"Each of the ten dancers wore a different emblem, and was known by its name. Tallis knew them off by heart: feather, iron, bell, owl—who wore a stuffed owl's head round his neck—oak, thorn, ivy, stone, bone and the leader, fire. The leader carried a tarred torch which would be lit at nine o'clock and used in the most important of the ceremonies. Bone, the tallest and most robust of the dancing group, carried a great bone horn at his waist."|Lavondyss|"Robert Holdstock"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o'clock"|"It was nine o'clock and the real ceremonies were about to begin. The sky was still quite light but already the sparks from the dying embers of the ox-fire appeared brighter in the air, and the two floodlights had been turned on to illuminate the gray face of the church with its dark windows. A noticeable change in the atmosphere of the village occurred, the people becoming more subdued, the air more vibrant as excitement grew."|Lavondyss|"Robert Holdstock"
"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"""It will have to reckon with me,"" Cuwyn said. ""I will bring you a cut of its meat before duskfall.""
""You will be dead before noon.""
""I will survive longer than that."""|Lavondyss|"Robert Holdstock"
12:00|noon|"Ash thought about his words. At noon she cast the twigs and the bone, but they said nothing to her. She smiled and was pleased."|Lavondyss|"Robert Holdstock"
"~ 16:30"|evensong|"All too quickly the day began to fade and the church at Shadoxhurst began to toll its bell, calling for evensong. Tallis returned home and Mr. Williams began the long walk to the Manor house."|Lavondyss|"Robert Holdstock"
00:00|midnight|"III.

Soon the forest closed around her, so dense and dark in places that even as the new day broke she imagined herself still to be in a midnight realm. The character and nature of the wood changed with every furlong's riding, and the traces and butchery of battle with it. In the woods of oak she passed glades where cowled men chanted over carved wooden heads or walked about the piled armor of dead warriors. She saw oval shields, with boars and stags brilliantly gilded upon the slashed leather, broken swords, highly coloured cloaks and small chariots of wicker, broken or burned, in each of which crouched the naked form of its dead rider. There were heads hanging from branches in these places, which gleamed as if oiled. The chanting of the priests seemed to summon wings, though as Tallis skirted these Celtic shrines she could see nothing; and only heard the raucous pleasure of the crow goddess."|Lavondyss|"Robert Holdstock"
