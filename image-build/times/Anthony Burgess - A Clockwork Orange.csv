                oh oh hours"|"The next morning I woke up at oh eight
                oh oh hours, my brothers, and as I still felt shagged and fagged and fashed and
                bashed and my glazzies were stuck together real horrorshow with sleepglue, I thought
                I would not go to school. I thought how I would have a malenky bit longer in the
                bed, an hour or two say, and then get dressed nice and easy, perhaps even having a
                splosh about in the bath, and then brew a pot of real strong horrorshow chai and
                make toast for myself and slooshy the radio or read the gazetta, all on my oddy
                knocky. And then in the afterlunch I might perhaps, if I still felt like it, itty
                off to the old skolliwoll and see what was vareeting in that great seat of gloopy
                useless learning, O my brothers. I heard my papapa grumbling and trampling and then
                ittying off to the dyeworks where he rabbited, and then my mum called in in a very
                respectful goloss as she did now I was growing up big and strong:"|"A Clockwork Orange"|"Anthony Burgess"
"ap ~ 08:00"|"gone eight"|"‘It’s gone eight, son. You
                don’t want to be late again.’ So I called back:"|"A Clockwork Orange"|"Anthony Burgess"
"ap < 07:30"|"near seven-thirty"|"What happened, though, was that I woke
                up late (near seven-thirty by my watch) and, as it turned out, that was not so
                clever. You can viddy that everything in this wicked world counts. You can pony that
                one thing always leads to another. Right right right. My stereo was no longer on
                about Joy and I Embrace Ye O Ye Millions, so some veck had dealt it the off, and
                that would be either pee or em, both of them now being quite clear to the slooshying
                in the living-room and, from the clink clink of plates and slurp slurp of peeting
                tea from cups, at their tired meal after the day’s rabbiting in factory the
                one, store the other. The poor old. The pitiable starry. I put on my over-gown and
                looked out, in guise of loving only son, to say:"|"A Clockwork Orange"|"Anthony Burgess"
"~ 11:00"|"about eleven o’clock in the morning"|"That was a very queer day, O my
                brothers. The dead plott was carried off, and then everybody in the whole prison had
                to stay locked up till further orders, and there was no pishcha given out, not even
                a mug of hot chai. We just all sat there, and the warders or chassos sort of strode
                up and down the tier, now and then creeching ‘Shut it’ or ‘Close
                that hole’ whenever they slooshied even a whisper from any of the cells. Then
                about eleven o’clock in the morning there was a sort of like stiffening and
                excitement and like the von of fear spreading from outside the cell, and then we
                could viddy the Governor and the Chief Chasso and some very bolshy important-looking
                chellovecks walking by real skorry, govoreeting like bezoomny. They seemed to walk
                right to the end of the tier, then they could be slooshied walking back again, more
                slow this time, and you could slooshy the Governor, a very sweaty fatty fair-haired
                veck, saying slovos like ‘But, sir–’ and ‘Well, what can be done,
                sir?’ and so on. Then the whole lot stopped at our cell and the Chief Chasso
                opened up. You could viddy who was the real important veck right away, very tall and
                with blue glazzies and with real horrorshow platties on him, the most lovely suit,
                brothers, I had ever viddied, absolutely in the heighth of fashion. He just sort of
                looked right through us poor plennies, saying, in a very beautiful real educated
                goloss,  ‘The Government cannot be
                concerned any longer with outmoded penological theories. Cram criminals together and
                see what happens. You get concentrated criminality, crime in the midst of punishment. Soon we may be
                needing all our prison space for political offenders.’ I didn’t pony
                this at all, brothers, but after all he was not govoreeting to me. Then he said,
                ‘Common criminals like this unsavoury crowd’ – (that meant me, brothers,
                as well as the others, who were real prestoopnicks and treacherous with it) –
                ‘can best be dealt with on a purely curative basis. Kill the criminal reflex,
                that’s all. Full implementation in a year’s time. Punishment means
                nothing to them, you can see that. They enjoy their so-called punishment. They start
                murdering each other.’ And he turned his stern blue glazzies on me. So I said,
                bold:"|"A Clockwork Orange"|"Anthony Burgess"
"ap < 02:00"|"near two o’clock"|"And that was it, that was what I viddied
                quite clear was the thing to do, but how to do it I did not properly know, never
                having thought of that before, O my brothers. In my little bag of personal veshches
                I had my cut-throat britva, but I at once felt very sick as I thought of myself
                going swishhhh at myself and all my own red red krovvy flowing. What I wanted was
                not something violent but something that would make me like just go off gentle to
                sleep and that be the end of Your Humble Narrator, no more trouble to anybody any
                more. Perhaps, I thought, if I ittied off to the Public Biblio round the corner I
                might find some book on the best way of snuffing it with no pain. I thought of
                myself dead and how sorry everybody was going to be, pee and em and that cally vonny
                Joe who was a like usurper, and also Dr Brodsky and Dr Branom and that Inferior
                Interior Minister and every veck else. And the boastful vonny Government too. So out
                I scatted into the winter, and it was afternoon now, near two o’clock, as I
                could viddy from the bolshy Center timepiece, so that me being in the land with the
                old moloko plus must have took like longer than I thought. I walked down Marghanita
                Boulevard and then turned into Boothby Avenue, then round the corner again, and
                there was the Public Biblio."|"A Clockwork Orange"|"Anthony Burgess"

03:00|"three in the morning"|"I saw a great deal of drunkenness in
                Leningrad restaurants. I found this on the whole encouraging; where there’s
                drunkenness, there’s hope, for good little totalitarian machines don’t
                get drunk. The technique with obstreperous drunks was always the same – the
                unceremonious chuck-out by a gaggle of waiters: the police were never brought into
                it. That’s another thing I liked about Leningrad – the absence of police.
                Perhaps all the police are secret police, and perhaps the only crimes are political
                crimes. Certainly, there was no attempt to cope officially with the minor
                misdemeanours which fill our police-courts – drunken disorderliness, rowdyism,
                soliciting. My wife and I left the Metropole Restaurant at three in the morning
                together with a charming Finnish couple. We had been with them for several hours,
                had carried on long and intricate conversations with them, despite the lack of any
                common language at all. I asked a waiter if we could get a taxi. He said, with
                commendable intelligibility, ‘Taxi, nyet.’ Downstairs I asked
                one of the three sweating doormen. But
                they were busy coping with a loud group of stilyagi or teddy-boys, who were
                shouting and waving broken bottles and demanding to be let into the restaurant.
                There, of course, it was a taxi very much nyet. So the four of us sat on
                the pavement, singing in Finnish and English that great international song
                ‘Clementine’. We wanted the police to come, tap us on the shoulder, find
                out if we were foreigners, then speed us back to our respective ships in police
                cars. But no police came. The painted girls solicited and the teddy-boys raged and
                romped, but no police came. It is my honest opinion that there are no police in
                Leningrad."|"A Clockwork Orange"|"Anthony Burgess"
