"~ 07:30"|"about prime"|"In this chapter, we will explore what we do understand about these special numbers. In the course of this journey, we will discover how different cultures have tried to record and survey primes and how musicians have exploited their syncopated rhythm. We will find out why the primes have been used to try to communicate with extraterrestrials and how they have helped to keep things secret on the Internet. At the end of the chapter, I unveil a mathematical enigma about prime numbers that will earn you a million dollars if you can crack it. But before we tackle one of the biggest conundrums of mathematics, let us begin with one of the great numerical mysteries of our time."|"The Number Mysteries"|"Marcus du Sautoy"
"ap 02:00"|2|"If the key players for Real Madrid wear primes, then what shirt should the goalkeeper wear? Or, put mathematically, is 1 a prime? Well, yes and no. (This is just the sort of math question everyone loves—both answers are right.) Two hundred years ago, tables of prime numbers included 1 as the first prime. After all, it isn’t divisible, since the only whole number that divides it is itself. But today, we say that 1 is not a prime because the most important thing about primes is that they are the building blocks of numbers. If I multiply a number by a prime, I get a new number. Although 1 is not divisible, if I multiply a number by 1, I get the number I started with, and on that basis, we exclude 1 from the list of primes and start at 2."|"The Number Mysteries"|"Marcus du Sautoy"
"~ 07:30"|"about prime"|"For a mathematician, the most curious feature is the choice of number: 17, a prime number. Is it just a coincidence that these cicadas have chosen to spend a prime number of years hiding underground? It doesn’t seem so. There are other species of cicada that stay underground for 13 years, and a few that prefer to stay there for 7 years—all prime numbers. Rather amazingly, if a 17-year cicada does appear too early, then it isn’t out one year early, but generally four years early, apparently shifting to a 13-year cycle. There really does seem to be something about prime numbers that is helping these various species of cicada. But what is it?"|"The Number Mysteries"|"Marcus du Sautoy"
"ap 02:00"|2|"Here’s a systematic way discovered by the ancient Greeks that is very effective at finding small primes. The task is to find an efficient method that will knock out all the nonprimes. Write down the numbers from 1 to 100. Start by striking out number 1. (As I have mentioned, though the Greeks believed 1 to be prime, in the twenty-first century, we no longer consider it to be.) Move to the next number, which is 2. This is the first prime. Now strike out every second number after 2. This effectively knocks out everything in the 2 times table, eliminating all the even numbers except for 2. Mathematicians like to joke that 2 is the odd prime because it’s the only even prime . . . but perhaps humor isn’t a mathematician’s strong point."|"The Number Mysteries"|"Marcus du Sautoy"
"ap 05:00"|5|"Because 4 has already been knocked out, we move next to the number 5 and strike out every fifth number on from 5. We keep repeating this process, going back to the lowest number n that hasn’t yet been eliminated, and then striking out all the numbers n places ahead of it."|"The Number Mysteries"|"Marcus du Sautoy"
"ap 01:09"|109|"The first rule was that soap films always meet in threes at an angle of 120 degrees. The edge formed by these three walls is called a Plateau border in his honor. The second rule was about the way these borders can meet. Plateau borders meet in fours at an angle of about 109.47 degrees (cos – ⅓, to be precise). If you take a tetrahedron and draw lines from the four vertices to the center, you get the configuration of the four Plateau borders in foam. So the edges in the bulging square at the center of the cube wire frame actually meet at 109.47 degrees:"|"The Number Mysteries"|"Marcus du Sautoy"

However much you zoom in or out, these shapes seem to retain the same level of complexity. This isn’t true of all shapes. If you draw a squiggly line and zoom in and magnify a portion of it, then at some point it will begin to look quite simple.

13:00|"13 o’clock"|"Where do the cards farther down the pack go? The way to work out the location of each card is to think of a clock with 2N – 1 hours on it, so a 52-card pack is like a clock with hours from 1 to 51. If you want to know where card 32 went, then double 32, which you do by starting at hour 32 and counting 32 hours on, which gets you to 13 o’clock. To work out how many times I have to do the perfect shuffle to get all the cards back to their original position, I have to work out how many times I have to double numbers on this clock for them to return to the original position. Actually, I just have to look at the number 1 and work out how many times I have to double 1 to get back to 1. On the clock with 51 hours, here is where I get by repeatedly doubling the 1:"|"The Number Mysteries"|"Marcus du Sautoy"
"~ 07:30"|"about prime"|"A mathematical question that goes back two hundred years to the work of Gauss is this: are there infinitely many numbers N with the property that a deck with 2N cards actually needs the full number of perfect shuffles? This question turns out to be related to the Riemann hypothesis, the million-dollar question about prime numbers that concluded chapter 1. If the primes are distributed as the Riemann hypothesis predicts they are, then there will be an infinite number of packs of cards needing the maximum number of shuffles. The Magic Circle and gamblers around the world probably aren’t holding their breath waiting for the answer, but mathematicians are curious to know how primes can be related to questions of shuffling cards. It wouldn’t be surprising if they were, because the primes are so fundamental to mathematics that they pop up in the strangest places."|"The Number Mysteries"|"Marcus du Sautoy"

The magic is guaranteed to work if the number of hours on the clock is prime. It doesn’t necessarily work if you take a non-prime-number clock.
