Beyond the oysters there was clear green turtle soup. Waiters then brought radishes and olives, and Terrapin à la Maryland. The saddle of lamb Aromatic came with brussels sprouts and chestnuts, the grouse with bread sauce and currant jelly, and for dessert there was a choice of cake, cheese, coffee and Nesselrode pudding. There was more champagne. The Louis Roederer was chased by Perrier Jouet Brut and Pommery Sec.

17:00|"five o’clock in the afternoon"|"There were detailed descriptions of how to prepare the lime, followed by directions to chop the woad into small lumps with a spade, and gradually add other ingredients to water set at 195 degrees Fahrenheit. The instructions ran on for several pages. ‘The vat should be set about four or five o’clock in the afternoon, and be attended and stirred again at nine o’clock the same evening,’ before being cooled. By this stage the result should be bottle-green. The dyer was then directed up again at five in the morning, and told to add more lime or indigo to lighten the colour. Bubbles and skin and increasing thickness would denote a good fermentation, which should then be boiled again and cooled, and boiled and cooled, and more lime added, and then it was time for the wool dipping. This was where matters became complicated. You really needed two vats of woad, one two months old, the other new, and the wool should be dipped in each in turn. The temperatures of the dye should be finely held at 125°F–130°F, then cooled overnight, then heated to 155°F–165°F, and then more woad added, with more lime, bran, madder and indigo. If the vats were skilfully managed it should colour 220 pounds of wool every week; within six weeks, the dyer should have four hundred pounds of dark blue wool, two hundred of half-blue, and two of very light. But this was only attainable if the very best woad and indigo were used, and here there were problems: ‘There is probably no article more uncertain in its strength and quality than woad,’ Partridge concluded. He advised buying only the very strongest, as ‘any considerable variation in this particular will prove very disastrous to the operator, however skilful he may be in his profession, and will be altogether ruinous to a young beginner’."|Mauve|"Simon Garfield"

Whatever serves the modern dyemaker directly serves national health.’ Domagk’s work on Prontosil and the sulfa drugs in the mid-1930s is credited with prolonging the lives of Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr, and was considered so important by Alexander Fleming that in the early 1930s he temporarily prioritised work on Prontosil over his development of penicillin. Prontosil’s formula was tweaked by the French and the chemists of May and Baker in Britain, leading to new so-called M & B drugs before the war. Domagk’s work led to the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1939, but Hitler’s disapproval of the award of the 1935 Nobel Peace Prize to Carl von Ossietzky, whom he had imprisoned, led to Domagk being unable to accept his award until 1947."|Mauve|"Simon Garfield"

Judd at the National Bureau of Standards, Washington, DC, who found that Perkin and his successors had made a significant contribution to the English language. Of the 7,500 colour names identified by this time, over 100 originated directly from synthetic dyes. (That is to say, while almost all the 7,500 could be made artificially, there were over 100 names – including anthracene green and naphthalene yellow – that originated purely from the chemist’s workbench. The other sources include 528 flowers (from amaryllis to wisteria), 427 proper names of places (Antwerp brown to Zanzibar brown), 340 pure colour names (black, blue, red), 290 pigments (chrome green), 254 fruits (apricot, banana), 239 foods (brown sugar, yolk yellow), 221 peoples (Tyrian purple, Dutch blue), 214 substances (amber, asphalt), 200 personal names (Robin Hood green, Salome pink), 183 botany (acacia), 149 common things (brick red), 144 natural dyes (indigo, madder), 133 birds (bluejay) and 133 animals (buff – from buffalo). There were 125 jewels (amethyst), 123 metals (brass), 121 geographical elements (glacier blue), 117 alcoholic drinks (absinthe), 107 trees (willow green), 105 atmospherical features (aurora yellow), 83 weather aspects (smog), 82 moods (blue funk), 79 abstract things (triumph blue), 72 romance and passion (golden rapture), 64 minerals (agate), 60 old things (antique brown), 59 end-use (battleship grey), 56 fable and superstition (goblin scarlet), 55 time of day (midnight blue), 50 marine life (coral), 50 undyed textiles (ecru), 46 mythology (Bacchus), 36 ceramic (Wedgwood blue), 31 religious occupations (cardinal purple), and 20 human (nude)."|Mauve|"Simon Garfield"
