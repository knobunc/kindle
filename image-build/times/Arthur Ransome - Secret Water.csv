"ap 00:50"|"ten minutes to one"|"“Come on,” said Susan. “I set it for ten minutes to one. Daddy and Mother’ll be back and you know how Miss Powell hates people to let her cooking get cold.”"|"Secret Water"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 10:30"|"half-past ten"|"“Left arm over his head. Right arm pointing at half-past ten. … That’s T. … The next one’s H. … Both arms straight out. … That’s R. … Half a minute. …”"|"Secret Water"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap ~ 02:15"|"about a quarter past two"|"“No more talking,” said Daddy. “Finish your breakfasts. No seaman lets hot bacon and toast get cold if he can help it. And there’s no time to waste. High tide today about a quarter past two. We’ve got to be at the islands before then. All that stuff to be put aboard and we’ll have to be sailing by twelve.”"|"Secret Water"|"Arthur Ransome"
12:00|midday|"“It’ll have to do,” said John. “We can’t be far wrong now. It must be about supper time. We’ll have supper each day when the shadow falls on the supper stick. We’ll watch for midday tomorrow when the sun’s highest and the shadow’s shortest, and we’ll shove in a dinner stick too.”"|"Secret Water"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 01:02"|"one two"|"“Now,” he said, and was off, swinging each leg in a wide circle so as not to trip himself with the big oval boards on his feet. Off he went, with a loud sucking noise, as he lifted the splatchers from the mud, one two, one two, one two, one two, leaving behind him the mastodon track of enormous hoofmarks. Off he went, swinging his legs, running easily along the muddy bottom of the creek where they knew the mud was so soft that in ordinary seaboots he could not have taken a step without being bogged."|"Secret Water"|"Arthur Ransome"
"~ 03:00"|"About three o’clock in the morning"|"“Long after,” said the Mastodon. “About three o’clock in the morning. Good, good. Deeper water already. But the others oughtn’t to have waited for us. They’ve got to get across the Wade. And your boat’s deeper than mine.”"|"Secret Water"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 03:36"|3.36|"NANCY WOKE THE camp with a war cry long before the shadow on the meal-dial was anywhere near the breakfast peg. Susan, who had Nancy’s watch in her tent, saw that it was terribly early, but knew that there was no hope of getting anybody to sleep again with the sunshine pouring through the walls of the tents. Everybody but Bridget went down to the landing place and had a morning wallow, getting so muddy on their way up again that it took another wallow in the pond to get them clean. Bridget, who could not swim, did the next best thing in standing by the pond and letting the others empty bucketfuls of water over her head. John cut the day’s notch in the flagstaff. There was no sign of the Mastodon. They had breakfast. They wrote the first Report of the Secret Archipelago Expedition. Everybody signed it, and Susan put it in a stamped envelope, meaning to ask the farmer to post it next time he went to the mainland. Roger went twice to his look-out post to see if the Mastodon had come out to take up his night-line. John and Nancy were looking at the map considering what to explore next. “He said we couldn’t do much boatwork until the afternoon,” said John, looking at his tide-table. “High tide’s not till 3.36.”"|"Secret Water"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 03:30"|"half past three"|"“It’ll be low water pretty soon,” said the Mastodon. “You can’t do much in the boats. But what about this afternoon? Tide won’t be high till half past three. I’ve got to go home to get some things, and I want some more netting string from the town. Run right out. And there may be a letter from the tribe. …”"|"Secret Water"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap ~ 02:30"|"about half past two"|"“Have to when there’s no other way,” said the Mastodon. “They’re almost sure to send a letter before they leave Pin Mill. … I’ve got a pretty good plan for today,” he went on. “I’m going straight over the marshes from Speedy, easy enough with nothing to carry. But I’ll be loaded up when I come back. You know when we passed the Wade on the way home yesterday I showed you where the withies mark a channel going right in to a landing place on the mainland. You ought to have that in the map. Couldn’t you explore that while the tide’s coming up? Start from here about half past two. There’s a channel all the way in. We’ve marked a lot of it. It twists about a bit, and we’ve put marks at the bends, secret ones. You’ll see them when you’re close to them, but not from the shore. If you work your way up there, there’s a fine landing place. It’s an old barge quay really. I’ll get all my stuff there by high water and meet you there. And then we’ll load it into your boats and dump it in Speedy, and there might be just time to sail round my island before you come to supper.”"|"Secret Water"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 03:30"|"half past three"|"“It won’t be high water till half past three,” said John. “He says we ought to start about half past two to meet him at that place.”"|"Secret Water"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap ~ 02:30"|"about half past two"|"“It won’t be high water till half past three,” said John. “He says we ought to start about half past two to meet him at that place.”"|"Secret Water"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 01:00"|"One o’clock"|"“Totem and clock-tower,” said Roger. “One o’clock, too. Look at the dinner stick. We’d got it in just the right place. The shadow’s going to touch it in a minute.”"|"Secret Water"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap ~ 04:30"|"about half past four"|"John hesitated. “Go ahead,” he said. “Work up with the tide. It’s just turning. It won’t be high water till about half past four. “That’s when they’ll be coming if they do come. But we’ll have to clear out as soon as we see them.”"|"Secret Water"|"Arthur Ransome"
12:00|midday|"Steady work with the compass and surveying poles went on through the rest of the morning. They mapped the channel which, dry at low water, made Flint Island really an island when the tide came up and not just the nose of a promontory as it was shown on Daddy’s rough sketch. Before the tide came up and filled it, they made a hurried expedition along the sands beyond it, where Bridget found shells and Sinbad played with them, and they picked up good bits of driftwood for a midday fire on which to boil their kettle. There was a moment’s horror at the thought that the two explorers in Firefly would get none of the tea, but it was remembered that if they did indeed get to the town, they would be able to have something else instead. “Lapping up grog like anything,” said Roger. “I bet Nancy thought of that before she started.”"|"Secret Water"|"Arthur Ransome"
12:00|midday|"“Owl at midday,” said John, grinning, remembering something that had happened long ago. “Something’s up.”"|"Secret Water"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"The Mastodon looked up at the tide-table nailed to the wall. “High water before eight,” he said. “That means low water about two. No good in boats with a falling tide. All through the middle of the day there won’t be any water except in the main channels. Just right for doing the Wade.”"|"Secret Water"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 00:00"|"twelve o’clock"|"IT WAS A broiling hot day. The hard sharp shadow of the meal-dial was moving towards the dinner peg. Nancy’s watch, hanging on the totem, said that it was getting on for twelve o’clock, when the Wade would be dry, and the explorers would be able to cross the Red Sea, survey the road, and take the damaged rudder to the town. They were all going, except for Nancy and Peggy who had been to the town before and, full of plans for the evening, had almost turned into Eels already. Everybody wanted to see what the town was like, and it was the first chance they had had of talking to Mother on the telephone. Since breakfast they had been busy on the map. Yesterday’s work with the six boats had given them a lot to do, John fitting six sketch maps into one, Titty copying and inking, and the others explaining what those squiggles meant which nobody but the one who had drawn them could understand."|"Secret Water"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap < 02:00"|"Nearly two o’clock"|"John pointed to a clock hanging out over the street. “Gosh,” he said. “Just look at that. Nearly two o’clock. The Mastodon said the Wade’s dry for about four hours. The tide’ll be up to it again by four, and I don’t know how long the man’ll take to mend the rudder. We’ve got to get him started first. We’ll telephone while he’s doing it.”"|"Secret Water"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"Then, as always happens when people are in a particular hurry, there was difficulty in getting the right number. And when at last she had got it, and Miss Powell came to the telephone and Susan asked if she could speak to Mother, the others saw her face change. “Not till three o’clock?” she said. “Don’t let her go out again when she comes. We’ll telephone again.”"|"Secret Water"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"“Daddy and Mummy aren’t going to be at Miss Powell’s till three o’clock. Oh dear. What time did John say we had to be back at the Wade?”"|"Secret Water"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"“John,” said Susan. “Daddy and Mother aren’t there. They won’t be there till three o’clock. We’ll have to telephone again. How much time are we going to have?”"|"Secret Water"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 09:00"|"Nine o’clock"|"“Where?” said John, but did not wait for an answer. “We can’t get the map finished, and it’s your fault. Daddy’s coming for us in the morning. Nine o’clock. I told him the map wasn’t done and he said we’d have to leave it. He wants everything packed up and ready to put aboard at high tide, so as not to waste a single minute. He’d sent a message through the farmer. Didn’t you see it stuck on the stick of the meal-dial?”"|"Secret Water"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"“I’d got the rudder mended before three o’clock,” said John, “and we got Daddy on the telephone first shot, and Susan and I raced home, and there’d have been just time for me to go and settle that North West Passage if only you’d waited in the camp instead of putting Susan in a stew and making us waste hours in looking for you. And now we can never do it. It’s too late now, and the map’s a failure without it.”"|"Secret Water"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 01:00"|one|"“No good,” said John. “Savages are all right as guides, and jolly useful, but we’ve got to do a thing like that ourselves. Explorers can’t mark a passage unless they’ve been through to know it is one.”"|"Secret Water"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 07:30"|"Half past seven"|"“Half past seven. Here’s Nancy’s watch. Hang it on the totem so it won’t get forgotten.”"|"Secret Water"|"Arthur Ransome"
