Rick tries to make us play board games and Charades and Wink Murder, even though you can’t play Wink Murder with just three people, and I…’ She raised her eyebrows at me. ‘I’m the one who drinks too much and burns the turkey.’"|"Losing You"|"Nicci French"
"ap ~ 10:30"|"gone half past ten"|"‘No,’ said Eamonn.
‘It’s gone half past ten,’ she said.
‘Low tide’s in ten minutes,’ Eamonn said, as if it was the most logical response. He wrinkled his face in distaste. ‘We’re surrounded by putrid-smelling mud.’"|"Losing You"|"Nicci French"
"ap 11:00"|"Eleven o’clock"|"So I didn’t do any clearing up. I didn’t do any of her packing. I looked at my watch. It wasn’t on my wrist. Where was it? On the side of the bath? On the floor next to my bed? In a pocket somewhere? By the sink? But at that moment a sheep emerged from Charlie’s ridiculous sheep clock and bleated the hour. Eleven o’clock. No rush. So I left the room – except that I took her flip-flops off the floor to pack because she would probably forget them and I’d end up having to buy new ones."|"Losing You"|"Nicci French"
"ap 11:13"|"eleven thirteen"|"Later I would frame it but for the time being I pinned it to the fridge door with a magnet. But what to do now? What to do first among all the things that needed doing? I mentally tossed an imaginary eight-sided coin. First, I put the bag with the snorkel, the flippers, our bathing suits and towels into the back of the car, to get it out of the way. I put the dollars I’d ordered from the bank last week into my wallet. I wrote a note for the milkman, cancelling the milk for the next two weeks, rolled it up and put it into the neck of an empty bottle, which I placed outside the front door. I washed the dishes in the sink, dried and cleared them away, and swept the kitchen floor thoroughly – I wanted Renata to arrive at a tidy house. I stripped the sheets off our beds and threw them into the kitchen to deal with. At eleven thirteen by the clock on the oven, I rang Charlie again, and once more got a message."|"Losing You"|"Nicci French"

"ap 11:36"|"Eleven thirty-six"|"I ran up the stairs, away from the heat and the noise, the mess and the confusion. I saw the clock radio by my bed. Eleven thirty-six. For just a few seconds I stood by the window, staring out at the sea that was drawing closer all the time, at the grey sky that rocked gently against the grey water, the grey light falling in wide faint shafts. I could see how the wind was riffling the waves into the tightly corrugated patterns of squalls and how the sea-birds, a long way out, gathered in spiralling patterns around a lone fishing-boat, half shrouded in the faint mist."|"Losing You"|"Nicci French"
"ap 23:40"|"twenty to twelve"|"‘Hang on,’ I said. ‘I know it doesn’t sound like much time but something’s gone wrong. We’re due to go away on holiday. We’re supposed to be leaving before one and it’s twenty to twelve now. She knows about that, she’s excited about it. She had to get back – she had to pack her things. It’s not just that. She organized a surprise party for me this morning but she didn’t turn up at it. Why would that be? Something’s happened.’"|"Losing You"|"Nicci French"

He probably expected me to offer him tea but I didn’t have time for that. I pulled out a chair for him, sat down myself at the littered table and looked at him. He pushed away a bowl of crisps, pulled out a notebook and a pen, licked his finger and flipped over several pages. He wrote the date at the top, then glanced at his watch and wrote the time as well: 11.54, I read upside-down."|"Losing You"|"Nicci French"
"ap ~ 10:30"|"gone half past ten"|"I remembered Karen telling Eamonn, as he shuffled out of the door of their house in his bare feet and trench coat, that it was gone half past ten. And when I’d gone into Charlie’s room her sheep clock had sounded the hour."|"Losing You"|"Nicci French"

She had come back a couple of hours later, when the party she’d organized was starting or under way, when we were soon to go to the airport.

But how didn’t I see her?’"|"Losing You"|"Nicci French"
"ap 11:17"|"eleven seventeen"|"‘Now.’ He sat at the desk opposite us, picked up a pen, pulled a pad of paper towards him. He thought for a moment. ‘So, where are we? We know this film was taken at eleven seventeen.’"|"Losing You"|"Nicci French"

Each second was a long time, an agony of trying not to think and thinking all the time, of trying not to see her face and seeing it all the time, hearing her voice call out for me and I couldn’t help her, couldn’t go to her. I could feel the seconds ticking by, turning into minutes. I felt I was burning up with the need to act and the impossibility of doing so."|"Losing You"|"Nicci French"
"ap 01:45"|"quarter to two"|"A quarter to two. I clenched my fists, dug my nails into my palms until they hurt, walked up and down the road, the icy wind raw on my skin, like being rubbed with sandpaper. I tried to think over everything that had happened, get it all in order so I could be ready for the police: not the order of things as I had experienced them, moments of scrappy revelations, but the order of things as they must have happened. Charlie had gone to a sleepover. She had had her drink spiked, by girls who’d previously bullied her, and got horribly drunk; she’d left for her paper round at about nine but only got as far as this lonely spot."|"Losing You"|"Nicci French"
"ap 01:50"|"Ten to two"|"Ten to two. I went over to Alix in the car and asked if her phone charger was compatible with my phone, and if so would she charge it a bit for me now. Every minute of extra power would help. She turned on the engine and plugged it in, then said something comforting and platitudinous but I couldn’t reply; I literally could not bring myself to speak the words. Stones in my throat. I just stared at her through my stinging eyes and turned away. What should I do now? I had no phone, nothing to busy myself with, and the horizon was empty. My gloveless hands were freezing, my fingers numb."|"Losing You"|"Nicci French"

A woman on her bike, her hair tied back in a scarf and her coat billowing around her. She seemed to take ages to cycle by. Mahoney sat stolidly in his car. I scoured the landscape for signs of the police who were arriving from the mainland, but they didn’t come. They couldn’t get here that quickly. It was five to two."|"Losing You"|"Nicci French"

"ap 09:30"|"half past nine"|"‘Maybe. Between that. No, I know, it was nearer half past nine, twenty to ten, because Carrie’s mother said she needed to get to the shops before ten.

Anyway, we were going to go with her and buy some crisps, but then Carrie said we should bike over towards the oyster beds because there’s this boy she fancies lives near Lower Meadow Farm down there and we might see him.’ She giggled."|"Losing You"|"Nicci French"
"ap 03:20"|"twenty past three"|"The sheep clock told me it was twenty past three. In a couple of hours or so we should have been boarding the plane to Florida. I sat on the floor, among the mess, and once more stared around. Perhaps Charlie had been snatched randomly, and there were no clues or patterns. Or perhaps I would find, among the clutter of her teenage life, some sign. I began with the drawers of her desk. One by one I opened them and tipped out their contents. I picked up each object and looked at it before replacing it in the drawer."|"Losing You"|"Nicci French"
"ap < 03:45"|"nearly a quarter to four"|"‘Oh…’ said Rick. He glanced at his watch – nearly a quarter to four. I could see he was already regretting his impulsive offer. At any other time, on any other day, I would have let him off but I was merciless."|"Losing You"|"Nicci French"
"ap ~ 04:00"|"About four"|"‘How long has it been going on?’
‘About four, five months. Since the summer.’
Such a long time, I thought. So many days of keeping it from me, of deceiving me, of pretending she was somewhere else. I thought of all the little things that Charlie confided – and she’d held this back."|"Losing You"|"Nicci French"
00:00|midnight|"Without another word, he put on his helmet and started the bike. I climbed on behind him and put my arms round his waist. I tried to think: where had Charlie been, that last week of November? I couldn’t remember. The land blurred past me, I smelt the briny air. There had been a party she’d gone to with Ashleigh, and I’d collected them at midnight, but she’d seemed fine, hadn’t she? Hadn’t she? I remembered her getting into the car in her tiny grey skirt, her long legs in their ankle boots, her shining coil of hair. I closed my eyes as the wind whipped past me."|"Losing You"|"Nicci French"
"ap >> 04:00"|"well after four"|"‘Contaminating the scene?’ I said, incredulous. ‘The only reason you’ve even got a crime scene here is that I found it. What I feel is that we’re wasting time sitting about. My head’s spinning and I’m not sure what’s going on but one thing is clear. Until half an hour ago, I knew my daughter was gone and I was still hoping against all the signs that she might have just run off as some sort of adolescent rebellion. What we now know is that a girl has been killed on this island and it feels… Oh, God, don’t you understand how it feels to be sitting here in this warm car, not even driving, just sitting and watching the tide come in, and talking like this, when all the time Charlie may be out there, in danger, waiting to be rescued?’ I pointed at the large watch on Andrea Beck’s wrist. ‘Look,’ I said. ‘It’s well after four. It’s almost completely dark. It’s freezing cold. Charlie’s been gone for hours. Hours and hours. Every minute counts now, every second. And there’s a dead girl. We have to hurry.
