"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"“There will be a parley at seven o’clock,” he said at last. “In the drawing room.”"|"A Red Herring Without Mustard"|"Alan Bradley"
"> 02:00"|"past two in the morning"|"Now, hours later, I was suddenly awake. The hands of my alarm clock, which I had carefully dabbed with my own formulation of phosphorescent paint, told me that it was several minutes past two in the morning."|"A Red Herring Without Mustard"|"Alan Bradley"
02:30|"two-thirty in the morning"|"But he had a point. Father loathed the telephone, and allowed it to be used only in the most extreme emergencies. At two-thirty in the morning, it would be quicker to cycle—or even run!—into Bishop’s Lacey than to arouse Miss Runciman at the telephone exchange and ask her to ring up the sleeping Dr. Darby."|"A Red Herring Without Mustard"|"Alan Bradley"
04:00|"four in the morning"|"Inspector Hewitt would have a conniption. And I had no doubt it would be he—four in the morning or not—who responded to the doctor’s call."|"A Red Herring Without Mustard"|"Alan Bradley"
"> 02:00"|"past two in the morning"|"I knew that there would never be a better time to dig for information: Mrs. M was away from her usual post in the kitchen and Dogger seemed to be at a peak of alertness. I took a deep breath and plunged directly in: “I found Brookie Harewood in the drawing room last night,” I said. “Actually, it was past two in the morning.”"|"A Red Herring Without Mustard"|"Alan Bradley"
00:00|midnight|"But part of me knew that it was safe enough. Vanetta Harewood was a professional woman. She would no more want the midnight ramblings of her son brought to light than … than I would."|"A Red Herring Without Mustard"|"Alan Bradley"
00:00|midnight|"All I really knew about Brookie Harewood was that he was a poacher and a layabout—and that I had surprised him in his midnight prowling. That and the fact that he had claimed to have seen the Gray Lady of Buckshaw."|"A Red Herring Without Mustard"|"Alan Bradley"
12:00|noonday|"The LORD shall smite thee with madness, and with blindness, and with astonishment of heart; and thou shalt grope at noonday, as the blind gropeth in darkness, and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways: and thou shalt be only oppressed and spoiled alway, and there shall be none to save thee."|"A Red Herring Without Mustard"|"Alan Bradley"
00:00|midnight|"The dates, stewed and served with cold clotted cream, were another of Mrs. Mullet’s culinary atrocities. They looked and tasted like something that had been stolen from a coffin in a midnight churchyard."|"A Red Herring Without Mustard"|"Alan Bradley"
"ap 06:30"|six-thirty|"“The vicar tells me that the choir is in need of several extra voices, and I’ve assured him that you’d be happy to pitch in. They’ve laid on an extra practice this evening at six-thirty sharp.”"|"A Red Herring Without Mustard"|"Alan Bradley"
13:30|"one-thirty this afternoon"|"“What are you doing here?” she demanded. “No visiting until one-thirty this afternoon, and it’s only just gone—” She shot a glance at her watch, an impossibly tiny lump strapped to her wrist."|"A Red Herring Without Mustard"|"Alan Bradley"
00:00|midnight|"I suppose I had been expecting a dry-as-dust account of hellfire parsons and dozing parishioners. But what I had stumbled upon was a treasure trove of jealousy, backbiting, vanity, abductions, harrowing midnight escapes, hangings, mutilations, betrayal, and sorcery."|"A Red Herring Without Mustard"|"Alan Bradley"
00:00|midnight|"As we passed under a low brick archway, I let my mind fly back to the night I had caught Brookie in his midnight prowl of the drawing room. It was hard to believe that had been only five days ago."|"A Red Herring Without Mustard"|"Alan Bradley"
"> 00:00"|"just past midnight"|"It was just past midnight when I eased shut my bedroom door and crept silently down the curving staircase."|"A Red Herring Without Mustard"|"Alan Bradley"
00:00|midnight|"I remembered that Dogger kept a high-powered torch in the butler’s pantry for what he called “midnight emergencies,” and it took only a moment to find it."|"A Red Herring Without Mustard"|"Alan Bradley"
