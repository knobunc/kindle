12:00|noon|"Moses took his Attendant into the eerie cavelike bar. The outer walls were on step-down, almost opaque. Moses saw the hazy outlines of mountain and sky – grays and blacks. The hour was noon. The four-toed Nebishes crowded, thigmotropically, around the massive stone bar – comforted by the warm hips and elbows. Everyone wore the standard issue of loose translucent party garments. Moses ordered their layered drinks from the giddy dispenser and dialed for flambé. A tiny white fire flickered on top of their multicolored cylinders."|"Half Past Human"|"T. J. Bass"
"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"Tinker went back to work. The power cell from the inoperative craft was charged in a garage and spliced into the conductive web of the operative ship. He lined up four bowmen and four blademen to come along. Moses arrived about noon."|"Half Past Human"|"T. J. Bass"
"< 00:00"|"near midnight"|"Toothpick convulsed. His skin tickled Moses’ hand. From his nose a beam of pure white light penciled into the dark sky. It was near midnight and Sagittarius was directly overhead. Old Moon stood in the Huntercraft, puzzled. A similar pencil of light issued from Ball. A small meteor crossed the sky – a long white scratch on ebony. Another meteor, then another. Then there were hundreds of tiny white and yellow scratches, hardly more than faint curlicues that faded as fast as they appeared."|"Half Past Human"|"T. J. Bass"
"ap 02:00"|160|"Curious Nebishes crowded into the garage to hear Gitar’s song. Kaia had grown meatier – stronger with time. He sat with Gitar making a rhyme. Hypnotic music rolled at 150 hertz – entraining autonomies – locking onto cephalic rhythms. At 160 decibels they sang their five-toed songs – songs of violent passions, freedom and individual strength. The Nebishes joined in – hesitantly at first – and then with almost violent spiritual fervor."|"Half Past Human"|"T. J. Bass"
