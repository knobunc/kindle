00:00|Midnight|"Please note: neither this list nor its contents are final till midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement. The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month. A preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment and editing by those who wish to do so. To be sure you have an up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes in the first week of the next month. Since our ftp program has a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a new copy has at least one byte more or less."|"Alice Adams"|"Booth Tarkington"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"However, he did sleep intermittently, drowsed between times, and even dreamed; but, forgetting his dreams before he opened his eyes, and having some part of him all the while aware of his discomfort, he believed, as usual, that he lay awake the whole night long. He was conscious of the city as of some single great creature resting fitfully in the dark outside his windows. It lay all round about, in the damp cover of its night cloud of smoke, and tried to keep quiet for a few hours after midnight, but was too powerful a growing thing ever to lie altogether still. Even while it strove to sleep it muttered with digestions of the day before, and these already merged with rumblings of the morrow. “Owl” cars, bringing in last passengers over distant trolley-lines, now and then howled on a curve; faraway metallic stirrings could be heard from factories in the sooty suburbs on the plain outside the city; east, west, and south, switch-engines chugged and snorted on sidings; and everywhere in the air there seemed to be a faint, voluminous hum as of innumerable wires trembling overhead to vibration of machinery underground."|"Alice Adams"|"Booth Tarkington"
"ap > 07:00"|"a little after seven o’clock"|"For the second time that morning—it was now a little after seven o’clock—tears seemed about to offer their solace to Mrs. Adams. “I might have expected you to say that, Alice; you never do miss a chance,” she said, gently. “It seems queer you don’t some time miss just ONE chance!”"|"Alice Adams"|"Booth Tarkington"
17:00|"five in the afternoon"|"“Why, the poor boy’s at Lamb and Company’s all day. He doesn’t get through until five in the afternoon; he doesn’t HAVE much time.”"|"Alice Adams"|"Booth Tarkington"
"< 12:00"|"toward noon"|"Adams had a restless morning, and toward noon he asked Miss Perry to call his daughter; he wished to say something to her."|"Alice Adams"|"Booth Tarkington"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"The turf was too damp for her to kneel; she worked patiently, stooping from the waist; and when she got home in a drizzle of rain at five o’clock her knees were tremulous with strain, her back ached, and she was tired all over, but she had three hundred violets. Her mother moaned when Alice showed them to her, fragrant in a basin of water."|"Alice Adams"|"Booth Tarkington"
"ap ~ 09:00"|"about nine o’clock"|"“Doe’ want ‘ny canned peaches,” said the frank Walter, moving back his chair. “G’-night.”
“Walter! It doesn’t begin till about nine o’clock at the earliest.”
He paused, mystified. “What doesn’t?”"|"Alice Adams"|"Booth Tarkington"
"ap < 09:00"|"a little before nine o’clock"|"Alice was busy with herself for two hours after dinner; but a little before nine o’clock she stood in front of her long mirror, completed, bright-eyed and solemn. Her hair, exquisitely arranged, gave all she asked of it; what artificialities in colour she had used upon her face were only bits of emphasis that made her prettiness the more distinct; and the dress, not rumpled by her mother’s careful hours of work, was a white cloud of loveliness. Finally there were two triumphant bouquets of violets, each with the stems wrapped in tin-foil shrouded by a bow of purple chiffon; and one bouquet she wore at her waist and the other she carried in her hand."|"Alice Adams"|"Booth Tarkington"
"ap 09:30"|"half-past nine"|"Alice stayed in the “living-room” until half-past nine, when she went slowly upstairs. Her mother, almost tearful, met her at the top, and whispered, “You mustn’t mind, dearie.”"|"Alice Adams"|"Booth Tarkington"
"ap > 05:00"|"after five o’clock"|"He had already been out of the house, to walk about the small green yard; and on Monday afternoon he sent for a taxicab and went down-town, but kept a long way from the “wholesale section,” where stood the formidable old oblong pile of Lamb and Company. He arranged for the sale of the bonds he had laid away, and for placing a mortgage upon his house; and on his way home, after five o’clock, he went to see an old friend, a man whose term of service with Lamb and Company was even a little longer than his own."|"Alice Adams"|"Booth Tarkington"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"Adams devoted the latter part of that evening to the composition of his letter—a disquieting task not completed when, at eleven o’clock, he heard his daughter coming up the stairs. She was singing to herself in a low, sweet voice, and Adams paused to listen incredulously, with his pen lifted and his mouth open, as if he heard the strangest sound in the world. Then he set down the pen upon a blotter, went to his door, and opened it, looking out at her as she came."|"Alice Adams"|"Booth Tarkington"
12:00|noon|"He was out in his taxicab again the next morning, and by noon he had secured what he wanted."|"Alice Adams"|"Booth Tarkington"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"However, she finally obtained fifteen before his bedtime; and the next morning “went to market” after breakfast, leaving Alice to make the beds. Walter had not yet come downstairs. “You had better call him,” Mrs. Adams said, as she departed with a big basket on her arm. “I expect he’s pretty sleepy; he was out so late last night I didn’t hear him come in, though I kept awake till after midnight, listening for him. Tell him he’ll be late to work if he doesn’t hurry; and see that he drinks his coffee, even if he hasn’t time for anything else. And when Malena comes, get her started in the kitchen: show her where everything is.” She waved her hand, as she set out for a corner where the cars stopped. “Everything’ll be lovely. Don’t forget about Walter.”"|"Alice Adams"|"Booth Tarkington"
"ap < 08:00"|"nearly eight o’clock"|"“Time to get up, Walter. The rest of us had breakfast over half an hour ago, and it’s nearly eight o’clock. You’ll be late. Hurry down and I’ll have some coffee and toast ready for you.” There came no sound from within the room, so she rapped louder."|"Alice Adams"|"Booth Tarkington"
12:00|noon|"Emerging from the kitchen at noon, Mrs. Adams found her daughter on hands and knees, scrubbing the bases of the columns between the hall and the “living-room.”"|"Alice Adams"|"Booth Tarkington"
"ap 00:30"|"half of one"|"Lately, he had half confessed to her what a nervousness she had produced. “You make me dread the day when I’ll hear somebody speaking of you. You’re getting me so upset about it that if I ever hear anybody so much as say the name ‘Alice Adams,’ I’ll run!” The confession was but half of one because he laughed; and she took it for an assurance of loyalty in the form of burlesque."|"Alice Adams"|"Booth Tarkington"
17:00|"five in the afternoon"|"But Mr. Palmer declined the responsibility. “Up to four or five in the afternoon, perhaps,” he said. “After that, the young gentleman is as much a stranger to me as he is to my family. I’ve been wondering who she could be.”"|"Alice Adams"|"Booth Tarkington"
12:00|noon|"That morning and noon had been warm, though the stirrings of a feeble breeze made weather not flagrantly intemperate; but at about three o’clock in the afternoon there came out of the southwest a heat like an affliction sent upon an accursed people, and the air was soon dead of it. Dripping negro ditch-diggers whooped with satires praising hell and hot weather, as the tossing shovels flickered up to the street level, where sluggish male pedestrians carried coats upon hot arms, and fanned themselves with straw hats, or, remaining covered, wore soaked handkerchiefs between scalp and straw. Clerks drooped in silent, big department stores, stenographers in offices kept as close to electric fans as the intervening bulk of their employers would let them; guests in hotels left the lobbies and went to lie unclad upon their beds; while in hospitals the patients murmured querulously against the heat, and perhaps against some noisy motorist who strove to feel the air by splitting it, not troubled by any fore- boding that he, too, that hour next week, might need quiet near a hospital. The “hot spell” was a true spell, one upon men’s spirits; for it was so hot that, in suburban outskirts, golfers crept slowly back over the low undulations of their club lands, abandoning their matches and returning to shelter."|"Alice Adams"|"Booth Tarkington"

"ap 07:00"|seven|"She fell asleep, after a time, while from across the hall the bare feet still thudded over their changeless route; and she woke at seven, hearing Adams pass her door, shod. In her wrapper she ran out into the hallway and found him descending the stairs."|"Alice Adams"|"Booth Tarkington"
"~ 17:00"|"About five o’clock that afternoon"|"About five o’clock that afternoon, the old gentleman came back to Adams’s house; and when Alice opened the door, he nodded, walked into the “living-room” without speaking; then stood frowning as if he hesitated to decide some perplexing question."|"Alice Adams"|"Booth Tarkington"
