"< 15:00"|"Almost fifteen"|"Almost fifteen now, Ruth Connors knew. Out in the aluminum toolshed behind her house, surrounded by the doorknobs and hardware
         her father had found in old houses slated for demolition, Ruth sat in the darkness and concentrated until she came away with
         a headache. She would run into the house, past the living room, where her father sat reading, and up to her room, where in
         fits and bursts she would write her poetry. “Being Susie,” “After Death,” “In Pieces,” “Beside Her Now,” and her favorite—the
         one she was most proud of and carried with her to the symposium folded and refolded so often that the creases were close to
         cuts—“The Lip of the Grave.”"|"The Lovely Bones"|"Alice Sebold"
03:00|"three A.M."|"Her father drove her first to the hospital at three A.M. and then to the symposium, stopping home on the way to pick up the bag her mother had packed and left at the end of their
         driveway."|"The Lovely Bones"|"Alice Sebold"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"I could see back to an afternoon when Ruth watched her teenage cousin undress to take a bath while Ruth sat on the bathroom
         rug, locked in the bathroom so her cousin could babysit her as she’d been told. Ruth had longed to touch her cousin’s skin
         and hair, longed to be held. I wondered if this longing in a three-year-old had sparked what came at eight. That fuzzy feeling
         of difference, that her crushes on female teachers or her cousin were more real than the other girls’ crushes. Hers contained
         a desire beyond sweetness and attention, it fed a longing, beginning to flower green and yellow into a crocuslike lust, the
         soft petals opening into her awkward adolescence. It was not so much, she would write in her journal, that she wanted to have
         sex with women, but that she wanted to disappear inside of them forever. To hide."|"The Lovely Bones"|"Alice Sebold"
"ap 07:15"|7:15|"The kids loved it. The musicians and poets, the History Heads and artists, were teeming and bubbling about how to begin. They
         shoveled down their bacon and eggs at breakfast and compared the great unsolved murders of the past or thought of ordinary
         objects that could be used for fatal wounds. They began to think of whom they could plot to kill. It was all in good fun until
         7:15, when my sister walked in."|"The Lovely Bones"|"Alice Sebold"
04:00|"four A.M."|"When my father woke up at four A.M., the house was quiet. My mother lay beside him, lightly snoring. My brother, the only child, what with my sister attending
         the symposium, was like a rock with a sheet pulled up over him. My father marveled at what a sound sleeper he was—just like
         me. While I was still alive, Lindsey and I had had fun with that, clapping, dropping books, and even banging pot lids to see
         if Buckley would wake up."|"The Lovely Bones"|"Alice Sebold"
"~ 04:40"|"around 4:40 A.M."|"When the alarm had gone off to tell him to shut the blinds and then the next alarm, which told him to shut off most of the
         lights because the suburbs were asleep after that, Mr. Harvey would go down into the basement, where there were no cracks
         that light could peek through and people could point to, to say he was strange. By the time he killed me he had tired of visiting
         the crawlspace, but he still liked to hang out in the basement in an easy chair that faced the dark hole beginning halfway
         up the wall and reaching to the exposed baseboards of his kitchen floor. He would often drift off to sleep there, and there
         he was asleep when my father passed the green house at around 4:40 A.M."|"The Lovely Bones"|"Alice Sebold"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"It looked like a penlight from that distance. One white beam slowly moving out across the lawns and toward the junior high.
         My father watched it. It was after midnight now, and the moon was not full enough, as it often was, to see the outlines of
         the trees and houses. Mr. Stead, who rode his bike late at night with a flashing light on the front powered by his pedals,
         would never degrade the lawns of his neighbors that way. It was too late for Mr. Stead anyway."|"The Lovely Bones"|"Alice Sebold"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"“You’re too young to shave your legs, sweetie,” my father said.
“Grandma Lynn started shaving at eleven.”
“Buckley, will you go in your room and take the dog? I’ll be in in a while.”"|"The Lovely Bones"|"Alice Sebold"
14:00|"two in the afternoon"|"He left the house every day for an hour or two in the afternoon. He would pick up any supplies he needed and then drive out
         to Valley Forge Park and walk the paved roads and the unpaved trails and find himself suddenly surrounded by school tours at
         George Washington’s log cabin or the Washington Memorial Chapel. This would buoy him up—these moments when the children were
         eager to see history, as if they might actually find a long silver hair from Washington’s wig caught on the rough end of a
         log post."|"The Lovely Bones"|"Alice Sebold"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"She walked, clutching her side in a false cramp, and waved the boys on when they turned to notice her. She kept walking with
         her hand on her waist until they turned the corner at the far end of the block. At the edge of Mr. Harvey’s property was a
         row of tall, thick pines that had been left untrimmed for years. She sat down by one of them, still feigning exhaustion in
         case any neighbor was looking out, and then, when she felt the moment was right, she curled up in a ball and rolled in between
         two pines. She waited. The boys had one more lap. She watched them pass her and followed them with her eyes as they cut up
         through the vacant lot and back to the high school. She was alone. She calculated she had forty-five minutes before our father
         would begin to wonder when she’d be home. The agreement had been that if she trained with the boys’ soccer team, Samuel would
         escort her home and have her back by five o’clock."|"The Lovely Bones"|"Alice Sebold"
"ap > 05:00"|"after five o’clock"|"My grandmother insisted. I watched her resist the remaining slug of vodka in her glass. “I will contain my drinking until”—she
         thought hard here—“after five o’clock, and,” she said, “what the hell, I’ll stop altogether if you should find it necessary.”"|"The Lovely Bones"|"Alice Sebold"
"ap 00:00"|twelve|"Hours later, as he yawned and leaned into my mother’s lap and she finger-combed his hair, my father ducked into the kitchen
         to make cocoa and my sister and I served German chocolate cake. When the clock struck twelve and there was only distant screaming
         and a few guns shot into the air in our neighborhood, my brother was unbelieving. Disappointment so swiftly and thoroughly
         overtook him that my mother was at a loss for what to do. She thought of it as sort of an infant Peggy Lee’s “Is that all
         there is?” and then bawling."|"The Lovely Bones"|"Alice Sebold"
10:00|"ten in the morning"|"My father did a sanity check, staring at her. He was still in his robe and it was almost ninety degrees at ten in the morning,
         but she had pantyhose and makeup on. Then he noticed Hal in an undershirt out in the yard."|"The Lovely Bones"|"Alice Sebold"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"At Evensong one night, while Holly played her sax and Mrs. Bethel Utemeyer joined in, I saw him: Holiday, racing past a fluffy
         white Samoyed. He had lived to a ripe old age on Earth and slept at my father’s feet after my mother left, never wanting to
         let him out of his sight. He had stood with Buckley while he built his fort and had been the only one permitted on the porch
         while Lindsey and Samuel kissed. And in the last few years of his life, every Sunday morning, Grandma Lynn had made him a
         skillet-sized peanut butter pancake, which she would place flat on the floor, never tiring of watching him try to pick it up
         with his snout."|"The Lovely Bones"|"Alice Sebold"
"ap 00:00"|twelve|"“They’ll be okay, Dad.” At twelve, my brother had become serious and considerate. Even if he didn’t pay for the food or cook
         the meals, he managed the house."|"The Lovely Bones"|"Alice Sebold"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"When the doorbell rang at our house it was four o’clock and Hal was in the kitchen wearing one of my mother’s old white chef’s
         aprons and cutting brownies for Grandma Lynn. He liked being put to work, feeling useful, and my grandmother liked to use
         him. They were a simpatico team. While Buckley, the boy-guard, loved to eat."|"The Lovely Bones"|"Alice Sebold"
"ap 04:00"|four|"At four, my mother and father ended up standing in the same room downstairs. They had come in from opposite doorways."|"The Lovely Bones"|"Alice Sebold"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"All the dancers would slowly go inside. The song reverberated until Holly, for a final time, passed the tune over, and Mrs.
         Utemeyer, quiet, upright, historical, finished with a jig.
The house asleep by then; this was my Evensong.
"|"The Lovely Bones"|"Alice Sebold"
"ap > 10:00"|"after ten"|"It was late now, after ten, and she took an empty elevator to the fifth floor, where the hall lights had been dimmed. She passed
         the nurses’ station, behind which two nurses were quietly gossiping. She could hear the lilt and glee of nuanced rumors being
         exchanged between them, the sound of easy intimacy in the air. Then, just as one nurse was unable to suppress a high-pitched
         laugh, my mother opened my father’s door and let it swing shut again."|"The Lovely Bones"|"Alice Sebold"
"> 00:00"|"Shortly after midnight"|"Shortly after midnight, she fell asleep after trying as hard as she could to keep her eyes open. To hold on to everything
         all at once while she looked at that face, so that when he woke she could say goodbye."|"The Lovely Bones"|"Alice Sebold"
"~ 02:00"|"Around two A.M."|"Around two A.M. it began to rain, and it rained down on the hospital and on my old home and in my heaven. On the tin-roofed shack where Mr.
         Harvey slept, it was raining too. As the rain beat its tiny hammers above his head, he dreamed. He did not dream of the girl
         whose remains had been removed and were now being analyzed but of Lindsey Salmon, of the 5! 5! 5! hitting the border of elderberry.
         He had this dream whenever he felt threatened. It had been in the flash of her soccer shirt that his life had begun to spin
         out of control."|"The Lovely Bones"|"Alice Sebold"
"ap < 04:00"|"near four"|"It was near four when I saw my father’s eyes open and saw him feel the warmth of my mother’s breath on his cheek even before
         he knew she was asleep. We wished together that he could hold her, but he was too weak. There was another way and he took
         it. He would tell her the things he had felt after my death—the things that came into his mind so frequently but that no one
         knew but me."|"The Lovely Bones"|"Alice Sebold"
"~ 03:00"|"Around three A.M."|"Around three A.M., Ray had stirred. He sat up and looked at Ruth, at her long gangly limbs, at the beautiful body to which
         he had made love, and felt a sudden warmth infuse him. He reached out to touch her, and just then a bit of moonlight fell
         across the floor from the window where I had watched him sit and study for so many years. He followed it. There on the floor
         was Ruth’s bag."|"The Lovely Bones"|"Alice Sebold"
00:00|Midnight|"Ruth took the cue to shut up. She did not mention the dream that was not a dream again, even ten days later, when the story
         of my death began to travel through the halls of the school, receiving add-on nuances as all good horror stories do. They
         were hard-pressed, my peers, to make the horror any more horrible than it was. But the details were still missing—the what
         and when and who became hollow bowls to fill with their conjectures. Devil Worship. Midnight. Ray Singh."|"The Lovely Bones"|"Alice Sebold"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"At Evensong, there were all sorts of dogs. And some of them, the ones I liked best, would lift their heads when they smelled
         an interesting scent in the air. If it was vivid enough, if they couldn’t identify it immediately, or if, as the case may
         be, they knew exactly what it was—their brains going, “Um steak tartare”—they’d track it until they came to the object itself.
         In the face of the real article, the true story, they decided then what to do. That’s how they operated. They didn’t shut
         down their desire to know just because the smell was bad or the object was dangerous. They hunted. So did I."|"The Lovely Bones"|"Alice Sebold"
"ap > 04:00"|"after four o’clock"|"My brother was in the front room with his toys. My mother blessed the fact that she had gone early to buy his gifts. Lindsey
         got gloves and cherry-flavored lip gloss. My father got five white handkerchiefs that she’d ordered months ago in the mail.
         Save Buckley, no one wanted anything anyway. In the days before Christmas the lights on the tree were not plugged in. Only
         the candle that my father kept in the window of his den burned. He lit it after dark, but my mother, sister, and brother had
         stopped leaving the house after four o’clock. Only I saw it."|"The Lovely Bones"|"Alice Sebold"
