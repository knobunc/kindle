Stretched over a frame of segmented bones, membranous wings arched over his head instead of his own black feathers. A demon’s horns curled back from his temples. And he’d always been big, but not like this. Michael had a warrior’s body, strong and tall. The first time she’d seen him, Taylor had pegged him at six-four and two-twenty.

New Eden poses no more threat than the Coiling Straits, the wall, or anywhere over Horde territory. There will always be danger aboard this ship. If you can’t face New Eden, then you aren’t suited for any other dangers we face—and you aren’t suited for my lady’s crew.”"|Tethered|"Meljean Brook"
