23:50|"ten minutes to midnight"|"Christmas songs rang out from below. It was like this every year, good cheer and festivities which brought back a hundred memories at once; recollections of times when his life had meaning and purpose, of people and places his decisions had changed forever. They were all gone now. All gone. The old man considered his watch in the dark. The ghostly green hands of the watch, illuminated by radium, showed it was ten minutes to midnight. Soon it would be Christmas day, a sight he would never live to see."|"Delta Green"|"Dennis Detwiller"

00:00|midnight|"Hanging tapestries and old blue-brown barrels lined the walls, and each available space was covered in every imaginable thing—old swords, African tribal masks, a portion of a bronze boiler engine, old fishing nets, a dozen rocking horses, but most of all there were books. Hundreds of old mismatched and dusty books, stacked like cordwood in corners and on the floor, biggest to smallest, some obviously used as makeshift tables and chairs in a midnight card game, most likely by the Wermacht men who guarded the building during the evenings."|"Delta Green"|"Dennis Detwiller"
"> 00:00"|"just after midnight"|"First attempts at contact were made on the evening of March 27, 1941. Weber, Lutzen, and Schwelm cast the first three “calling stones” into the sea off the point on the Cap de la Hague on a moonless night and waited for nearly five hours. The sign, as it had been foretold in the Cthaat Aquadingen, appeared just after midnight, when the water out past the reefs began to glow a vivid greenish blue. The phenomenon lasted for more than three hours and was well documented on film by a team of Wermacht cameramen. A small Kriegsmarine craft was even sent out to collect samples of the water while it was still luminescing. As far as modern science could discern, the glowing algae discovered in the samples was a species unknown to man. Evidently a more hardy cousin to Chlorophycea, or common green algae, this odd organism contained an equivocal compound which rendered it luminescent under certain conditions. An extensive amount of the water and algae was sent to the University of Stuttgart for study."|"Delta Green"|"Dennis Detwiller"
21:37|"9:37 P.M."|"It began innocuously enough. Dr. Franz Mors, the mathematician in charge of detecting codes and ciphers within the Cthaat Aquadingen, informed his personal guard that he was going to walk the compound at 9:37 P.M. Nothing about it seemed amiss; it was his usual activity for the evening. According to the guard, he seemed “his usual self.” No one had noticed any changes in Mors’ attitudes during his study of the book. Indeed, he seemed happier than ever on the French coast."|"Delta Green"|"Dennis Detwiller"
21:35|"9:35 P.M."|"At 9:35 P.M. on the night of April 26th, 1941, something shambled from the waves and up the beach towards the small knot of Karotechia men."|"Delta Green"|"Dennis Detwiller"
00:00|Midnight|"He didn’t care if they were nancy boys or wetbacks, as long as they had money and were quiet. But what were they up to up there? You had to be careful these days. The man next door could be a spy for the Axis. Tony had seen a Republic serial not three days ago uptown, where Nazi agents had constructed a death beam using radio parts to disintegrate Manhattan. Hell, if it hadn’t been for Captain Midnight, they would have done it too. He knew it wasn’t anything like that, though. Probably only some type of wetback radio, but what for? To pick up transmissions from Cuba or wherever it was they came from?"|"Delta Green"|"Dennis Detwiller"
15:00|"three in the afternoon"|"Although it was three in the afternoon the pub was filled with people, who all looked up, not unpleasantly, at the two men when they entered. It was warm and the air smelled of bitters, beer, and roast chicken. Barnsby retired to a small table in a corner near a coat rack bursting with garments. Dozens of eyes tracked them as they sat. All the best tables, those nearest the roaring fire, were taken by the oldest or the biggest in the room, and the children sat right at the grate, shoes off, laughing and talking. Arnold liked that system. Barnsby removed his coat, but not his gloves, as usual."|"Delta Green"|"Dennis Detwiller"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"Then, pulled from the false freedom of sleep at three in the morning—a knock at the door..."|"Delta Green"|"Dennis Detwiller"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"At three in the morning, outside a dilapidated hotel on the outskirts of Boston, in the midst of a snow storm, a small boy stood solemnly outside Thomas Arnold’s door. Arnold’s first instinct after opening the door was to look beyond the child for his parents or something which would indicate the boy’s origin, but all he saw past the semi-circle of the parking lights was a copse of naked, dead trees pelted by a sheet of falling snow. Behind the child the lot was empty, and the night was cold. Arnold looked down at the kid, then down at the .45 in his own hand. Something told him to keep it out anyway. The child showed no fear, nor any other emotion for that matter. The kid considered Arnold and the gun with equal and wholly alien indifference."|"Delta Green"|"Dennis Detwiller"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"Arnold scratched his head, a movement that grounded him once more in reality—he was talking to an eight-year-old about the nature of time at three in the morning in the middle of a snow storm. All the evidence available indicated that the thing in the kid was born in another, alien form, at least 150 million years before. Arnold swallowed and cleared his throat. It seemed too small an opening to breathe through, all of a sudden."|"Delta Green"|"Dennis Detwiller"
03:00|"three A.M."|"When Arnold shut the door again the silence of the room enveloped him, but only for a second. The calm was broken by a pounding on the wall above the bed. The banging shook the cheap wall and sent a yellowed photograph of the New York City skyline crashing to the floor in an explosion of glass. A muffled voice shouted profanities at him through the thin wood, a reprimand brought on by too much alcohol or too little sleep. Apparently his neighbor had had enough of Arnold’s three A.M. conversation."|"Delta Green"|"Dennis Detwiller"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"It was nearing three o’clock when Rai hunkered down on the crest of a small rise, still beneath the endless canopy. The little Gurkha was there one moment and then vanished into the underbrush as rapidly as a rabbit going to ground. Rai let out a quiet whistle and held his hand, palm flat, up above the plants for the entire group to see. Behind Arnold, Jackson and Hauellwell placed the crate of the explosive compound, Composition B, on the ground between them and carefully unslung their submachine guns. Arnold cocked his Thompson slowly, hoping not to make too much noise; the bolt clicking seemed very loud in the stillness of the stifling heat. The DELTA GREEN team hunkered down and listened to the jungle."|"Delta Green"|"Dennis Detwiller"
12:00|mid-day|"“Good. Good.” Peaslee shot a nervous glance over his shoulder at the mouth of the cave, which Joe suddenly realized was glowing with the light of mid-day. Heat, unnoticed before, hung heavy in the dark. How long was I out? Camp thought to himself, and struggled to regain his composure."|"Delta Green"|"Dennis Detwiller"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"Night fell on the western desert and Joe Camp fell with it. It was seven and a half hours since his departure from the safety of the cave and he now understood the severe mistake he’d made venturing out in the blazing Australian sun. An hour into his march, all the strength had left his limbs, leaving him a stumbling stick-figure in an endless sea of red-brown dunes. His lips were cracked, his eyes were sunblind and his water was nearly gone. Half caught up in some mad, internal monologue, he noted his knees giving way like a man marking time, simply watching for some only marginally interesting event—in this case, the end of his life. There was no pain. In fact there was no sensation at all when he hit the sand. His body was a numb appendage, a ragged waste of rapidly dwindling liquids which would surely be used up after tonight."|"Delta Green"|"Dennis Detwiller"
00:00|midnight|"The clock hands fixed on midnight and the bell began to strike. From below him, through the floor, Lieutenant General David Leslie Cornwall could hear his family begin their revelry anew, shouting and laughing and singing as it officially became Christmas Day."|"Delta Green"|"Dennis Detwiller"
