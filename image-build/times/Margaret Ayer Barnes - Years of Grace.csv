"ap 01:00"|"one o'clock"|"It was one o'clock on a late November morning and the first Assembly ball was in full swing in the ballroom of the Blacks tone Hotel. The room was brilliantly lighted. Its gilded walls were hung with smilax and banked with palms and chrysanthemums. The floor was filled with dancers. A few elderly ladies, in full evening dress, were clustered in little groups on a row of gilt chairs, under the palms, A great crowd of young men were massed near the door. From tliat crowd, black broadcloth figures continually detached themselves, dashed into the revolving throng, tapped young women cavaherly on naked shoulders, drew them from their partners' embrace and stalked solemnly off with them."|"Years of Grace"|"Margaret Ayer Barnes"
"ap < 02:00"|"almost two o'clock"|"The lights flashed up. The darkies had vanished. The dancers, in twos and fours and sixes, took possession once more of the ballroom floor. Jane glanced at her wrist watch. It was almost two o'clock. But there if aj  Cicily! Cicily, slim and slinky in the folds of the new white velvet, passing down the receiving line, bending her dandeUon head in channing deference before the dowager hostesses.

12:00|noon|"Jane sat in the window of the Lakewood living-room, cross-stitching little brown and scarlet robins on a bib that she was making for Robin Redbreast's fourth Christmas. The Skokie Valley was a plain of spotless white. The sun was high and the sky was blue and the bare boughs of the oak trees were outlined with a crust of silvery snow that was melting, a little, in the heat of the December noon. Jenny was stretched on the sofa, intent on the pages of 'The American Kennels Gazette.' She was investigating the state of the market on Russian wolf hounds."|"Years of Grace"|"Margaret Ayer Barnes"
12:00|noon|"The second friend was a volatile young Englishman, the musical comedy star who had just finished playing the lead in 'Laugh, Lady, Laugh,' a show that had been 'packing them in,' so Jenny had informed Jane, for the last eighteen months on Broadway. Jane thought his crisp blond hair just a ripple too curly and the strength of his clear-cut jaw line a trifle weak. Nothing made a man look weaker, Jane reflected with a twinkle, than a strong chin. He was very nice and friendly, however. His name was Eric Arthur and he had a penchant  for Russian wolf hounds. He had two with him on tour, with which he walked in Central Park every day at noon. They had formed his first bond with Jenny. She had met him at a party at Pierre's and they had talked of the wolf hounds immediately."|"Years of Grace"|"Margaret Ayer Barnes"

The young Jew did not drink, and Steve, Jane was thankful to note, was behaving himself, though he rated his sister's taste in liquor much higher than her taste in decoration. By eleven all the young people were shouting the lyrics from 'Laugh, Lady, Laugh,' around the grand piano, while Eric Arthur pounded out the melody on the keys. Stephen looked fearfully tired. Jane knew she ought to take him back to the Plaza, but she did not like to leave the girls alone at a party that was going just like this. Ridiculous, of course.

Yet Jane could not really consider the engagement as  2ifait accompli  until next Wednesday morning, when Cicily's decree would be made final and Gicily, herself, would be — hateful word — free. She would be married three days later in Flora's apartment. But not until Wednesday noon, Jane told herself, firmly, would she recognize the engagement. If she did not recognize it, however, what was Albert's status in the crowded little taxi? It was terribly complicated. It was terribly sordid. Glancing from Cicily's bright, smiling countenance to Stephen's grim, constrained one, Jane could not agree with Albert's initial statement. They would not have a gay week."|"Years of Grace"|"Margaret Ayer Barnes"

Jane's tray of coffee and rolls and honey was still on the sitting-room table."|"Years of Grace"|"Margaret Ayer Barnes"
11:00|"eleven in the morning"|"Jane herself was far from feeling sleepy. She had been sitting in silence for the last half-hour on the Empire sofa in the little green sitting room, watching Stephen turn over the pages of the Paris 'Herald' and the London 'Times.' She rose, now, and followed him into their bedroom. It was rather a relief, she was thinking, to have something definite to do, even if that something was only pulling down three window-shades and raising one window and tucking a light steamer rug over Stephen's recumbent form. Stephen was looking very grim and tired. They had had a hard day, though nothing much had happened in it. At eleven in the morning Cicily had telephoned. She had telephoned to announce that her lawyer had just called her up from the courtroom to inform her that her decree had been made final. There had been no complications and the last requirement had been complied with. That was all there had been to the formal proceedings that Jane and Stephen had tragically prepared themselves to witness. Two months ago two foreign lawyers had spoken in an alien tongue. Cicily had murmured a few French words of acquiescence. A judge had entered an interlocutory judgment. To-day that judgment had been entered on the records of the Bureau of Vital Statistics. And a marriage had been dissolved."|"Years of Grace"|"Margaret Ayer Barnes"
12:00|noon|"'Have you heard from Aunt Isabel?' she asked. 'Albert had a cable from Belle this noon. She was married yesterday to Billy Winter.'
