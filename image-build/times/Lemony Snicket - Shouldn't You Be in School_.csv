"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"I slid in and squinted out the window of the roadster. The sun told me that it was about noon. It also told me that it was going to continue to beat down on Stain’d-by-the-Sea and make it blazing hot and that there was no point in arguing with it, because it was the sun and I was a boy of about thirteen. The sun was right. There was no point in arguing. The roadster puttered us through Stain’d-by-the-Sea, and I didn’t say anything more to Theodora. She called herself an intrepid personage and said that was an expression which there meant an excellent investigator, and I didn’t correct her. She called me ungrateful and I didn’t disagree. I just sat in the heat and wished for an ice cream cone. Nobody brought me one. Maybe Harold Limetta has a freezer full of the stuff, I told myself. Peppermint ice cream in particular would really hit the spot."|"Shouldn't You Be in School_"|"Lemony Snicket"
00:00|midnight|"The hallways of the Wade Academy were tricky for sneaking, but I’d had a very demanding sneaking instructor. Our final exam began early in the morning, with our instructor entering a small cabin in the middle of the woods and sitting blindfolded in a folding chair. The woods were full of crackly dead leaves, and the floor of the cabin was covered in fragile glass figurines. To pass the class we had to sneak up on him by midnight. When he arrived at the cabin that morning, the entire class was waiting for him. I’d snuck into his office the night before and shared the location of the cabin with the rest of the students so we could sneak up on him before he even arrived. I received the top grade in the class and a three-month suspension."|"Shouldn't You Be in School_"|"Lemony Snicket"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"“I’m supposed to climb to the top of the tower,” Ellington said, “and ring the bell at one o’clock sharp.”"|"Shouldn't You Be in School_"|"Lemony Snicket"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"“And where is he going to skulk,” I wondered, “at one o’clock tomorrow?”"|"Shouldn't You Be in School_"|"Lemony Snicket"
"ap > 01:00"|"Just after one o’clock"|"“Hungry’s,” I said. “Just after one o’clock. Ellington will ring the bell, so it’ll be easier to skulk away.”"|"Shouldn't You Be in School_"|"Lemony Snicket"
"ap < 01:00"|"Almost one"|"I woke up. “What time is it?”
“Almost one. You missed the all-clear. Take off your mask.”
I took off my mask."|"Shouldn't You Be in School_"|"Lemony Snicket"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"I walked around the corner with the mask in my hands, waiting for the bell. It’ll ring again, I thought. Ellington will do her part at one o’clock sharp. It didn’t ring, but I decided to skulk anyway, creeping around the corner so I could approach the school bus as quietly as possible."|"Shouldn't You Be in School_"|"Lemony Snicket"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"“That does ring a bell,” she said, and then the bell rang. I pictured Ellington in the bell tower, waiting for one o’clock sharp. Maybe she’d brought a book with her, to pass the time until one o’clock. Polly Partial blinked at me."|"Shouldn't You Be in School_"|"Lemony Snicket"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"“I did my part,” she said. “I went up to the bell tower and sat with a book until one o’clock sharp.”"|"Shouldn't You Be in School_"|"Lemony Snicket"
