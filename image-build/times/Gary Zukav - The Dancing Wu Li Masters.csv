"ap 03:00"|"3 o’clock"|"According to Einstein, this is incorrect. How can anyone say when it is “now” throughout the universe? If we try to designate “now” by the occurrence of two simultaneous events (like my arrival at the doctor’s office and my watch indicating 3 o’clock), we find that an observer in another frame of reference sees one of our events happening before the other. Absolute time, wrote Newton, “flows equably…,”7 but he was wrong. There is no single time which flows equally for all observers. There is no absolute time."|"The Dancing Wu Li Masters"|"Gary Zukav"
"ap 01:59"|"one hour fifty-nine minutes"|"At velocities above 99 percent of the speed of light particle masses increase dramatically. When the former electron accelerator at Cambridge, Massachusetts, was in operation, it received electrons from a small feeder accelerator. The electrons from the feeder accelerator were fed into the main accelerator at .99986 the velocity of light. The main accelerator then increased the velocity of these electrons to .999999996 the speed of light. This increase in velocity may look significant, but actually it is negligible. The difference between the initial velocity of the accelerated electrons and the final velocity of the accelerated electrons is the same as the difference in velocity between one automobile that can make a given trip in two hours and a faster automobile that can make the same trip in one hour fifty-nine minutes and fifty-nine seconds.7"|"The Dancing Wu Li Masters"|"Gary Zukav"
"ap 01:00"|100|"It is as if the top could spin, by some strange law that nobody understands, only at 100 revolutions per minute, 90 revolutions per minute, 80 revolutions per minute, and so on, with absolutely no exceptions in between. If our hypothetical top wants to spin slower than 100 revolutions per minute, it must jump all the way down to the next slower speed of 90 revolutions per minute. This is analogous to the situation with subatomic particles except that (1) particular types of particles forever spin at the same speed, and (2) the spin of subatomic articles is calculated in terms of angular momentum."|"The Dancing Wu Li Masters"|"Gary Zukav"
"ap 01:00"|one|"Although undifferentiated reality is inexpressible, we can talk around it (using more symbols). The physical world, as it appears to the unenlightened, consists of many separate parts. These separate parts, however, are not really separate. According to mystics from around the world, each moment of enlightenment (grace/insight/samadhi/satori) reveals that everything—all the separate parts of the universe—are manifestations of the same whole. There is only one reality, and it is whole and unified. It is one."|"The Dancing Wu Li Masters"|"Gary Zukav"
