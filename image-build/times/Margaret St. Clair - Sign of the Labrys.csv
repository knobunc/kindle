"ap 05:53"|"Seven to six"|"“I see.” Ames moved toward the door. “You work long hours, don’t you?” he said idly. “I waited for you a long time. Seven to six, you must work, or something like that.”"|"Sign of the Labrys"|"Margaret St. Clair"
"ap 05:53"|"Seven to six"|"“Seven to six!” It was my turn to laugh. “Oh, no, not even the bulldozer men, with B day to aim at, work hours like that. I don’t even work eight to five.”"|"Sign of the Labrys"|"Margaret St. Clair"
"ap 04:52"|"eight to five"|"“Seven to six!” It was my turn to laugh. “Oh, no, not even the bulldozer men, with B day to aim at, work hours like that. I don’t even work eight to five.”"|"Sign of the Labrys"|"Margaret St. Clair"
12:00|noon|"At noon, the foreman told me I could go home. As I left, I saw another of the warehouse workers moving my stack of boxes back to the south side."|"Sign of the Labrys"|"Margaret St. Clair"
"ap 07:00"|"Seven o’clock"|"Seven o’clock came, and I was still alive. Either none of the yeast cells had reached me, or I had a natural immunity."|"Sign of the Labrys"|"Margaret St. Clair"
"ap ~ 11:00"|"about eleven"|"It was a note. The note, written in pale brown ink, was quite short: “Mr. Sewell, come to the lower gallery at about eleven tonight.” It was signed with a “D”."|"Sign of the Labrys"|"Margaret St. Clair"
"ap 10:45"|"fifteen minutes to eleven"|"I ate my supper. I felt restless. I wasn’t going to go, of course. But at fifteen minutes to eleven, quite as if I had meant to go all along, I loaded fresh batteries into my flashlight and left my pad."|"Sign of the Labrys"|"Margaret St. Clair"
"~ 02:00"|"about two o’clock in the morning"|"I ate, read for a while, and crawled in between the bunk’s paper sheets. I woke about two o’clock in the morning, from an indifferent dream, to a sensation of abysmal horror and hopelessness."|"Sign of the Labrys"|"Margaret St. Clair"
"ap > 07:00"|"after seven"|"I woke after seven and a half hours. I sat up on my mattress and yawned and stretched. My muscles were a little sore, and my skin was warm. As I crawled out of the cleft, I felt a transient dizziness."|"Sign of the Labrys"|"Margaret St. Clair"
12:00|noon|"There were black moments, of course. Sometimes I would feel the blood draining from my eyes, and darkness covering me. Or I would move forward and find I had stumbled on in a mist of semi-consciousness. These times were not unwelcome to me; they were a refuge from too much light. But always the light beat against my eyes until I took up the burden of shadowless noon again."|"Sign of the Labrys"|"Margaret St. Clair"
00:00|midnight|"I sat up slowly, yawning and rubbing my face. I swung my feet over the side of the bed and stood up. “My sense of time’s confused,” I told her. “It could be either midnight, or a new day.”"|"Sign of the Labrys"|"Margaret St. Clair"
12:00|noon|"At noon I asked Jim, the one fellow worker whose name I knew, whether he thought a man could have been put in a plastic disposal bag before he was dead and then have escaped from it. He answered that it was possible, but he thought it was mighty god-damned unlikely. When they were dead, they were dead."|"Sign of the Labrys"|"Margaret St. Clair"
"ap ~ 10:30"|"about ten-thirty"|"Abruptly, about ten-thirty, when the blade of the bulldozer was pushing up a great wave of dirt, I realized what he had been talking about. I had seen him before, but he had been masked then. No wonder I hadn’t recognized him."|"Sign of the Labrys"|"Margaret St. Clair"
