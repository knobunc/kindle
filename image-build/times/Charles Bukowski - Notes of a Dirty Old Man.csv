MILTON BERLE’S COUSIN HIT ON HEAD BY FALLING ROCK. now how the hell are you going to kill yourself when they write headlines like that? I stole a paper and brought it back to the room. “guess what?” I asked. “what?” she said. “Milton Berle’s cousin was hit on the head by a falling rock.” “no SHIT?” “yeah.” “I wonder what kind of rock it was?” “I think it was a kind of round smooth yellow one.” “yeah, I think so too.” “I wonder what color eyes Milton Berle’s cousin has?” “I’d guess they’re a kind of brown, a very pale brown.” “pale brown eyes, light yellow rock.” “CLUNK!” “yeah, CLUNK!” I went out and cuffed a couple of bottles and we had a fairly nice day after all.

"~ 10:00"|"about 10 a.m."|"well, I saw Renie a few times after that but none of the times was like the first time, and we never made it together. first, I was trying to be careful on account of Miriam, and second I had built up such a thing about Renie being an Artist and a Lady that we both almost believed it ourselves. any sexual activity would have impaired the strictly impartial artist-critic relationship, and would have evolved into a possess-or-don’t-possess hassle. actually it was a hell of a lot more fun and abnormal the other way. but it wasn’t Renie who did me in. it was the little fat housewife of the garage mechanic in the back house. she came over to borrow some coffee or sugar or something about 10 a.m. one morning. she had on this loose dressing gown or whatever it was and she bent over to get the coffee or whatever from a low cupboard and the breasts fell out."|"Notes of a Dirty Old Man"|"Charles Bukowski"
16:40|"4:40 in the afternoon"|"“… i’m in this fishbowl, you understand, a vast aquarium & my fins are not strong enough to get around in this big undersea city. i do what i can, tho the magic is surely gone. i just can’t seem as yet to pull myself together out of this cold turkey state & get the ‘inspiration,’ no writing, no fucking, no damn nothing. can’t drink, can’t eat, can’t turn on. just cold turkey. so the gloom, but nothing seems to work just now. it’s going to be a long period of hibernation, a long dark night. i’m used to the sun, to the mediterranean brightness & dazzle, to living on the damn edge of the volcano, as in greece, where at least there was light, there were people, was even what is called love. now, nothing. middle-aged faces. young faces that mean nothing, that pass, smile, say hello. oh, cold gray darkness. old poet stuck in the sticks. the styx. the stinks. from doctors to hospitals, with shit specimens, piss specimens, & always the same reports — liver tests & pancreas tests abnormal: but nobody knows what to do, only i know. there is nothing to do but to snap out of this jungle, & meet some mythical young beauty — some sweet domestic thing who will take care of me, make few demands, be warm & quiet, not say too much. where is she? i couldn’t damn well give her what she wants, or could i??? it’s just possible, of course, that this is all i need. but how, where to find it? i wish i were tough. i’d be able to sit down & begin all over again, from scratch, getting it down on paper, stronger, cleaner, sharper than ever. but something has gone out of me right now, and i’m temporizing, stalling for time. the sky is black & pink and flushed at 4:40 in the afternoon. the city roars outside. the wolves are pacing in the zoo. the tarantulas are squatting beside the scorpions. the queen bee is served by the drones. the mandril snarls viciously, hurling filthy bananas & apples from its crotch at the crazy kids who taunt it. if i’m going to die, i want to come out to california, below l.a., far down the coast, on the beach somewhere, near Mexico. but that’s a dream. i’d want to do that somehow. but all the letters I get from the states are from poets & writers who have been here, on this side of the Atlantic, & they tell me how rotten it is back home, what a nasty scene, etc. i don’t know, i could never swing it, financially, since my backers are here, and they’d abandon me if i returned, as they more or less like to keep in closer contact with me. yes, the body gives, but hang on, and forgive the deadly dullness of this letter. i can’t get inspired, i can’t get worked up. i just look at doctor’s bills, & other bills, & the black sky, the black sun. maybe something will change, soon … that’s the way it is. tra la la, let’s face it without tears. cheers, friend.” Signed “X” (A well-known poet … editor)."|"Notes of a Dirty Old Man"|"Charles Bukowski"
12:00|noon|"well, my friend from London says it much better than I, but how well, how very well I know of what he speaks. and a worldful of energetic hustlers with their minds shaken awry with the pace would only condemn us for sloth or a kind of disgraceful laziness or self-pity. but it isn’t any of these things. only the man frozen in the cage can know it. but we’ll damn well have to go out of our way and wait. and wait for what? so, cheers, friends. even a dwarf can get a hard-on, and I am Mataeo Platch and Nichlos Combatz at the same time, and only Marina, my small girlchild, can bring light at the highest noon, for the sun will not speak. and up in the plaza between the terminal annex and the union station the old men sit in a circle and watch the pigeons, sit in a circle for hours and watch the pigeons and watch nothing. frozen, but I could cry. and at night we will sweat through senseless dreams. there’s only one place to go. tra la la la. la la. la."|"Notes of a Dirty Old Man"|"Charles Bukowski"
