         looked at his watch and it was almost six. In the excitement of the year’s first rain he had forgotten his tea and biscuits
         which John had brought in just before five; he picked up a biscuit and began to munch. Then he remembered that Clarke was
         coming to dinner and went to the kitchen to see what Cook was doing."|"Arrow of God"|"Chinua Achebe"

"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"‘That’s rather good,’ said Mr Clarke, and glanced at his watch again. Captain Winterbottom’s bungalow was only two minutes’
         walk away, so there was plenty of time. Before he came to Okperi Clarke had spent two months at Headquarters being broken
         in, and he would never forget the day he was invited to dinner by His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor. For some curious reason
         he had imagined that the time was eight o’clock and arrived at Government House on the dot. The glittering Reception Hall
         was empty and Clarke would have gone into the front garden to wait had not one of the stewards come forward and offered him
         a drink. He sat uneasily on the edge of a chair with a glass of sherry in his hand, wondering whether he should not even now withdraw into the shade of one of the trees
         in the garden until the other guests arrived. Then it was too late. Someone was descending the stairs at a run, whistling
         uninhibitedly. Clarke sprang to his feet. His Honour glowered at him for a brief moment before he came forward to shake hands.
         Clarke introduced himself and was about to apologize. But H.H. gave him no chance."|"Arrow of God"|"Chinua Achebe"
"ap 08:15"|eight-fifteen|"‘I was under the impression that dinner was at eight-fifteen.’ Just then his aide-de-camp came in and, seeing a guest, looked
         worried, shook his watch and listened for its ticking."|"Arrow of God"|"Chinua Achebe"
"< 12:00"|"Before midday"|"‘You are indeed fortunate,’ said Anosi to himself as he continued on his way to Umunneora to buy seed-yams from his friend.
         ‘I have already said that what this new religion will bring to Umuaro wears a hat on its head.’ As he went he stopped and
         told anyone he met what Ezeulu’s son had done. Before midday the story had reached the ears of Ezidemili whose deity, Idemili,
         owned the royal python."|"Arrow of God"|"Chinua Achebe"
12:00|midday|"When she was fully prepared Ugoye went behind her hut to the pumpkin which she specially planted after the first rain and
         cut four leaves, tied them together with banana string and returned to her hut. She put the leaves down on a stool and went
         to the bamboo shelf to examine the soup pot and the foofoo which Obiageli and Nwafo would eat at midday."|"Arrow of God"|"Chinua Achebe"
00:00|midnight|"As he awaited the arrival of his guest Mr Clarke felt not a little uneasy. One of the problems of living in a place like this
         with only four other Europeans (three of whom were supposed to be beneath the notice of Political Officers) was that one had
         to cope with a guest like Winterbottom absolutely alone. Of course this was not their first social encounter; they had in
         fact had dinner together not very long ago and things did not altogether grind to a stop. But then Clarke had been guest,
         without any responsibilities. Today he was going to be host and the onus would rest on him to keep the conversation alive,
         through the long, arduous ritual of alcohol, food, coffee and more alcohol stretching into midnight. If only he could have
         invited someone like John Wright with whom he had struck up a kind of friendship during his recent tour! But such a thing
         would have been disastrous."|"Arrow of God"|"Chinua Achebe"
"ap 06:45"|"quarter to seven"|"‘Ide try small small,’ said Cook, rubbing his smoke-inflamed eyes with his forearm. Clarke looked around vaguely and returned
         to the veranda of his bungalow. He sat down and looked at his watch again; it was quarter to seven – a full half-hour to go.
         He began to think up a number of subjects for conversation. His recent tour would have provided enough topics for the evening,
         but he had just written and submitted a full report on it."|"Arrow of God"|"Chinua Achebe"
12:00|noonday|"‘Yes, it was on the other Eke that it happened. He was returning home from the farmland he had gone to clear when it struck
         him down. Before he reached home he was trembling with cold in the noonday heat. He could no longer hold his matchet because
         his fingers were set like crooks.’"|"Arrow of God"|"Chinua Achebe"
"> 22:00"|"past ten o’clock at night"|"At first ‘Couple’ Matthew Nweke was not too worried. He had a strong personal protection which a great dibia in his village made for him during his last leave. But as he heard more and more about Ezeulu his faith in his safety began
         to weaken. In the end he held a quick consultation with the policeman who had accompanied him to Umuaro and they decided that to be on the safe side they should go and see a local dibia straight away. It was past ten o’clock at night when they arrived at the man’s house. He was called throughout the village
         The Bow that shoots at the Sky."|"Arrow of God"|"Chinua Achebe"
"> 12:00"|"a little past midday"|"It was a little past midday. Obika sat on the floor of his hut, his feet astride the stone on which he sharpened his matchet.
         Trickles of sweat ran down his face and he held his lower lip with the upper teeth as he worked. He had already used a whole
         head of salt to give greater edge to the stone; and now and again he squeezed a little lime juice on to the blade. Two emptied
         fruits lay near the stone with three or four uncut ones. Obika had been working on his new matchet at intervals during the
         past three days and it was now sharp enough to shave the hair. He rose and went outside to see it well in the light. He held
         it up before him and by twisting his wrist made it flash like a mirror in the sun. He seemed satisfied, went back into his
         hut and put it away. Then he passed through to the inner compound and saw his wife turning water from the big pot outside
         the hut into a bowl. She stood up wearily and spat as she always did nowadays."|"Arrow of God"|"Chinua Achebe"
