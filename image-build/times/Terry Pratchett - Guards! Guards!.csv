00:00|midnight|"Now a black-robed figure scurried through the midnight streets, ducking from doorway to doorway, and reached a grim and forbidding portal. No mere doorway got that grim without effort, one felt. It looked as though the architect had been called in and given specific instructions. We want something eldritch in dark oak, he’d been told. So put an unpleasant gargoyle thing over the archway, give it a slam like the footfall of a giant and make it clear to everyone, in fact, that this isn’t the kind of door that goes ‘ding-dong’ when you press the bell."|"Guards! Guards!"|"Terry Pratchett"
12:00|noon|"“I get oppressed all the time,” said Brother Doorkeeper. “Master Critchley, where I work, he oppresses me morning, noon and night, shouting at me and everything. And the woman in the vegetable shop, she oppresses me all the time.”"|"Guards! Guards!"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 00:00"|"Twelve O’clock"|"There is certainly a lot to do. When I went to see the Sgt I saw a place called, The Thieves’ Guild!! I asked Mrs Palm and she said, Of course. She said the leaders of the Thieves in the City meet there. I went to the Watch House and met Sgt Colon, a very fat man, and when I told him about the Thieves’ Guild he said, Don’t be A Idiot. I do not think he is serious. He says, Don’t you worry about Thieves’ Guilds, This is all what you have to do, you walk along the Streets at Night, shouting, It’s Twelve O’clock and All’s Well."|"Guards! Guards!"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 00:00"|"Twelve of the clock"|"Nobby sighed. Then he grunted, snatched his hourglass from his belt, and peered in at the rapidly-draining sand grains. He put it back, pulled the leather muffler off his bell’s clapper, and shook it once or twice, not very loudly.
“Twelve of the clock, “ he muttered, “and all’s well. “
“And that’s it, is it?” said Carrot, as the tiny echoes died away."|"Guards! Guards!"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 00:00"|"Twelve o’clock"|"Carrot examined it for a few seconds. Then he waved it vigorously over his head.
“Twelve o’clock!” he bellowed. “And all’s weeeeelllll!”
The echoes bounced back and forth across the street and finally were overwhelmed by a horrible, thick silence. Several dogs barked somewhere in the night. A baby started crying."|"Guards! Guards!"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 00:00"|12|"“Under arrest,” said Carrot, “with a view to the presentation of charges to whit l)(i) that on or about 18 Grune, at a place called the Mended Drum, Filigree Street, you did a) serve or b) did cause to serve alcoholic beverages after the hours of 12 (twelve) midnight, contrary to the provisions of the Public Ale Houses (Opening) Act of 1678, and l)(ii) on or about 18 Grune, at a place called the Mended Drum, Filigree Street, you did serve or did cause to serve alcoholic beverages in containers other than of a size and capacity laid down by aforesaid Act, and 2)(i) that on or about 18 Grune, at a place called the Mended Drum, Filigree Street, you did allow customers to carry unsheathed edge weapons of a length greater than 7 (seven) inches, contrary to Section Three of said Act and 2)(ii) that on or about 18 Grune, at a place called the Mended Drum, Filigree Street, you did serve alcoholic beverages in premises apparently unlicensed for the sale and/or consumption of said beverages, contrary to Section Three of the aforesaid Act.”"|"Guards!

"ap 02:00"|"Two o’clock"|"“Hah!” he shouted, at the dark alleyways. “Don’ like it, eh? Taste of your, your, your own medicine thingy. Well, now you can bootle in your trems!” He threw the empty bottle into the air.
“Two o’clock!” he yelled. “And all’s weeeellll!”
Which was astonishing news to the various shadowy figures who had been silently shadowing the four of them for some time. Only sheer puzzlement had prevented them making their attentions sharp and plain. These people are clearly guards, they were thinking, they’ve got the right helmets and everything, and yet here they are in the Shades. So they were being watched with the fascination that a pack of wolves might focus on a handful of sheep who had not only trotted into the clearing, but were making playful butts and baa-ing noises; the outcome was, of course, going to be mutton but in the meantime inquisitiveness gave a stay of execution."|"Guards! Guards!"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 00:00"|"Twelve of the Clock"|"Dearest Mother [wrote Carrot] Talk about a Turn Up for the Books. Last night the dragon burned up our Headquarters and Lo and Behold we have been given a better one, it is in a place called Pseudopolis Yard, opposite the Opera House. Sgt Colon said we have gone Up in the World and has told Nobby not to try to sell the furnishings. Going Up in the World is a metaphor, which I am learning about, it is like Lying but more decorative. There are proper carpets to spit on. Twice today groups of people have tried to search the cellars here for the dragon, it is amazing. And digging up people’s privies and poking into attics, it is like a Fever. One thing is, people haven’t got time for much else, and Sgt Colon says, when you go out on your Rounds and shout Twelve of the Clock and All’s Well while a dragon is melting the street you feel a bit of a Burke."|"Guards! Guards!"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 02:00"|"two of the clock"|"And now it was two of the clock the following morning. And all was well, apart from the rain. It was drizzling again."|"Guards! Guards!"|"Terry Pratchett"
14:00|"2 p.m."|"There are some towns in the multiverse which think they know how to have a good time. Places like New Orleans and Rio reckon they not only know how to push the boat out but set fire to the harbour as well; but compared to Ankh-Morpork with its hair down they’re a Welsh village at 2 p.m. on a wet Sunday afternoon."|"Guards! Guards!"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 07:30"|7.30|"“Mondays, 7.30, admission ten pence,” said Colon, promptly. “As for the folk-dance people-well, no problem there. You know you always wondered what Corporal Nobbs does on his evenings off?”"|"Guards! Guards!"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 05:00"|"Five of the clock"|"“Hmm.” Vimes glanced out of the window. Grey fog lagged the world with dim light. “What time is it?” he said.
“Five of the clock, sir.”
“Right. Well, before it gets dark-“"|"Guards! Guards!"|"Terry Pratchett"
12:00|Noon|"“Noon, sir. And Mr Wonse has sent a message about how you’re to be in your best armour among all the civic leaders, sir.”"|"Guards! Guards!"|"Terry Pratchett"
12:00|Noon|"Noon came. The fog didn’t lift but it did thin a bit, to allow a pale yellow haze where the sun should have been."|"Guards! Guards!"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 06:00"|"six of the clock"|"They were going to have to go out on the streets.
It was six of the clock. And all wasn’t well.
“I miss Errol, too,” said Carrot"|"Guards! Guards!"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap ~ 00:00"|"About twelve o’clock"|"“Hmm? What? Oh. Yes.” Colon shrugged. What about it, anyway? Maybe things turned out for the best. He finished the beer. “Best be off,” he said. “What time was it?”
“About twelve o’clock,” said Carrot.
“Anything else?”"|"Guards! Guards!"|"Terry Pratchett"
