"ap 01:00"|1|"SHOT GLASS
A shot is actually a measure, not just a glass style; it’s 1½ ounces. But these smaller glasses, grouped together under the name shot glasses, should be tailored to the specific drink. If you’re using it for straight-spirit shooters, I think it should be ¾ ounce or at most 1 ounce, because the idea of the shooter is a little extra something—a side dish, not the entrée—and so you don’t want a full 1½ ounces for that, which is too much alcohol. If you’re mixing a regular cocktail and dividing it into shots, with a total of maybe ¼ to ½ ounce actual hard liquor in a given serving, then a full-sized shot glass might work perfectly. But for those incorrigible types who already have a drink in front of them and say, “Oh, man, let’s do shots,” what are you going to do? A nice, thick-bottomed ¾-ounce shot glass, that’s what."|"The Essential Cocktail"|"Dale Degroff"
"ap ~ 05:45"|"about quarter to six"|"Brett did not turn up, so about quarter to six I went down to the bar and had a Jack Rose with George the bar-man. Brett had not been in the bar either, and so I looked for her upstairs on my way out, and took a taxi to the Café Select. Crossing the Seine I saw a string of barges being towed empty down the current, riding high, the bargemen at the sweeps as they came toward the bridge. The river looked nice. It was always pleasant crossing bridges in Paris."|"The Essential Cocktail"|"Dale Degroff"
"ap 05:45"|"quarter to six"|"Even if you’re not Jake Barnes being stood up at the Crillon by the love of your life, the Jack Rose is a fantastic drink at quarter to six. And I love Hemingway’s sentiment that Jake Barnes has a drink with George the bar-man, not a drink at the bar. The drink below is my adaptation for a modern palate, with the addition of simple syrup to turn it into more of a sour-style drink. The original recipe is too much about grenadine, especially now that 99 percent of the grenadine on the market is nothing more than artificially flavored and colored sugar water. Real grenadine—the original—is actually a pomegranate product and should taste like pomegranate (see Ingredient Note for homemade grenadine)."|"The Essential Cocktail"|"Dale Degroff"
"ap 05:45"|"quarter to six"|"Despite Jake Barnes’s preference for a pre-dinner Jack Rose at the Crillon, if it’s a quarter to six and you find yourself seated at a sidewalk café in Paris, and you order a drink, chances are it is—or it should be—a Kir. This white wine cocktail, with just a hint of a spirit in it, is named for Canon Felix Kir (1876–1968), who, when he was mayor of Dijon, served it to visiting dignitaries in order to boost a local product, crème de cassis. The drink was actually around long before Mayor Kir; it was then called a Blanc Cassis, after the black currant liqueur first commercially produced in the early nineteenth century in Dijon. But it was Mayor Kir who popularized the cocktail, so he deserves the name."|"The Essential Cocktail"|"Dale Degroff"
12:00|midday|"Halfway through our beers—and we were drinking pretty damn quickly—we heard a giant roar from outside, and fifteen or twenty bikes pulled up. A bunch of guys came in wearing full leather garb. The guy in front of the pack looked around the room and then at us, then back at his friends, and bellowed, “Pink Ladies all around.” That was our cue to depart. And this was just a couple years after my arrival in New York, when, as it happened, I used to order this creamy after-dinner drink sometimes because I really didn’t know what else to have—the Pink Lady was a part of pop culture, used in comic lines and plays, and I figured it had to be good. And the truth is, with the rose and cucumber notes from Hendrick’s gin rather than the big juniper London dry style, it is a good drink. Not really a midday cycling-break-in-a-leather-gay-bar drink, but for, you know, less ridiculous circumstances."|"The Essential Cocktail"|"Dale Degroff"
"ap 02:00"|two|"Of all Donn Beach’s inventions, perhaps none is more remembered than the Zombie. This terrifying-sounding cocktail immediately achieved notoriety because of the publicity-motivated rule that no customer was allowed to drink more than two on a given night. Putting aside the hype, a really well-made Zombie is a great drink. I won’t tell you the preparation is easy—it’s a multi-ingredient recipe, to say the least. And I can’t tell you this is Donn’s original recipe, because it’s not. In fact, a totally different version was published posthumously by Donn’s final wife, Phoebe, in 2001; she had cobbled together an assortment of Donn’s notes, none of which indicated that any recipe was the definitive one. Donn was not only secretive but he also, like all bartenders who take the profession seriously, constantly messed about with his recipes, improving or sometimes simply changing them to accommodate new products or the loss of a key ingredient in an existing recipe. It turns out the “definitive” published version was flawed (for example, calling for a full 6 ounces of spirits with less than 2½ ounces of juice and other ingredients, which is a monstrously strong drink), so that can’t really be the formula on which the empire was built."|"The Essential Cocktail"|"Dale Degroff"
