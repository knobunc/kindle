Others on the prog are gathering, including Mark Lawson of the Independent – one of my favourite journos, funny, informative and enthusiastic. In jest – well, partly in jest – I complain that the paper I’ve supported since the day of its birth should rap 80 Days so severely over the knuckles in Saturday’s preview, before anyone’s had a chance to see it. He asks after the name of the journalist … it was one Stephen Pope … ‘Oh, Pope Stephen, as they call him in the office.’"|"Travelling to Work"|"Michael Palin"

All that and the hint of a headache.

Day of foreboding, but deceptively pleasant here above Sunset Boulevard, probably about as far from Iraq as it’s possible to be – until you turn on the TV of course. But I don’t – yet."|"Travelling to Work"|"Michael Palin"

Even allowing for Patrick’s customary disinclination to exuberance, this is a grim leaving present. Friday night at the Odeon Haymarket was worse than any of us had ever considered. No rush to either of the early performances and only 250, considerably less than half the house, for the main evening perf. Nothing much either of us can say."|"Travelling to Work"|"Michael Palin"

The second credit is a most enormous red ‘in’."|"Travelling to Work"|"Michael Palin"

Try to view it as a friend and not a baleful technological bore itching to change my life!"|"Travelling to Work"|"Michael Palin"

Another grey day, but at least his two flatmates are installed already at 35 Jericho Street, so there’s someone to welcome him. He sounds more optimistic about this term – resigned to the flat, looking forward to work he enjoys – the Romantics – and determined to get out and involved in more things. I ask him about plans after Oxford. He still seems to like the idea of film school, but travel and writing come in there too."|"Travelling to Work"|"Michael Palin"
