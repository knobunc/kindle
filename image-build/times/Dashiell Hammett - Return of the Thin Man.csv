Writing on November 1: “I took Thyra [Samter Winslow, a Hollywood writer] to dinner last night and so I got very—not to say disgracefully—drunk . . . and so home at what hour I don’t know and too hungovery to go to the studio today.” Four days later:"|"Return of the Thin Man"|"Dashiell Hammett"

Your clients spend nine-tenths of their time doing it.” He looks at his watch, nods at the door through which the sound of music comes, says: “Or maybe for staying open after hours. Didn’t you ever tell ’em about the two o’clock closing law?”"|"Return of the Thin Man"|"Dashiell Hammett"

I don’t know whether it’s one of those half-smart tricks that you people think up, or what it is, but some guy phoned me a little while ago, all excited. He won’t tell me who he is except he claims he’s a friend of Tip’s, and he wants to know if I’m going to be home after midnight. He won’t tell me what it’s all about except that it’s something that won’t get me in a jam if I give him a square break, but he said he don’t want any monkey business, because he’s got two murder raps hanging over his head and he’s playing for keeps. That wouldn’t be some kind of charade you boys thought up, would it?”"|"Return of the Thin Man"|"Dashiell Hammett"

Nora, looking at the clock beside the bed: “One o’clock.”
