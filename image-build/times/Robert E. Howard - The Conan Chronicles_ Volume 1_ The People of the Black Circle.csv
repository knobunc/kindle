"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"‘Said the novice to the master of the art. They will not change the guard until past midnight. Should any come searching for him now, and find his body, they would flee at once to Yara, bellowing the news, and give us time to escape. Were they not to find it, they’d go on beating up the bushes and catch us like rats in a trap.’"|"The Conan Chronicles_ Volume 1_ The People of the Black Circle"|"Robert E. Howard"
00:00|midnight|"‘It will bear thrice my own,’ answered Taurus. ‘It was woven from the tresses of dead women, which I took from their tombs at midnight, and steeped in the deadly wine of the upas tree, to give it strength. I will go first - then follow me closely.’"|"The Conan Chronicles_ Volume 1_ The People of the Black Circle"|"Robert E. Howard"
00:00|midnight|"Arus the watchman grasped his crossbow with shaky hands, and he felt beads of clammy perspiration on his skin as he stared at the unlovely corpse sprawling on the polished floor before him. It is not pleasant to come upon Death in a lonely place at midnight."|"The Conan Chronicles_ Volume 1_ The People of the Black Circle"|"Robert E. Howard"
00:00|midnight|"Arus shuddered; he had never become used to the place, although he had worked there as watchman for some months. It was a fantastic establishment, the great museum and antique house which men called Kallian Publico’s Temple, with its i rarities from all over the world - and now, in the lonesomeness of midnight, Arus stood in the great silent hall and stared at the sprawling corpse that had been the rich and powerful owner of the Temple."|"The Conan Chronicles_ Volume 1_ The People of the Black Circle"|"Robert E. Howard"
"> 00:00"|"shortly after midnight"|"‘No. He bade me stop at Promero’s house. There he dismissed me, ordering me to return there for him shortly after midnight.’"|"The Conan Chronicles_ Volume 1_ The People of the Black Circle"|"Robert E. Howard"
23:30|"half an hour before midnight"|"‘Until perhaps half an hour before midnight. Then he left, saying that he was going to the Temple, and would return after he had done what he wished to do there.’"|"The Conan Chronicles_ Volume 1_ The People of the Black Circle"|"Robert E. Howard"
"< 00:00"|"before midnight"|"‘I warned him against it. But he stayed at my house as I have said, and a short time before midnight, he came along to the Temple, hiding in the shadows until the watchman had passed to the other side of the building, then letting himself in with his belt key. I watched him from the shadows of the silk shop, saw him enter the Temple, and then returned to my own house. If the diadem was in the Bowl, or anything else of great value, he intended hiding it somewhere in the Temple and slipping out again. Then on the morrow he would raise a great hue and cry, saying that thieves had broken into his house and stolen Kalanthes’s property. None would know of his prowlings but the charioteer and I, and neither of us would betray him.’"|"The Conan Chronicles_ Volume 1_ The People of the Black Circle"|"Robert E. Howard"
00:00|midnight|"Murilo felt his blood turn to ice again. He could see in this twist of fate only the sinister hand of Nabonidus, and an eery obsession began to grow on him that the Red Priest was more than human - a sorcerer who read the minds of his victims and pulled strings on which they danced like puppets. With despair came desperation. Girding a sword beneath his black cloak, he left his house by a hidden way, and hurried through the deserted streets. It was just at midnight when he came to the house of Nabonidus, looming blackly among the walled gardens that separated it from the surrounding estates."|"The Conan Chronicles_ Volume 1_ The People of the Black Circle"|"Robert E. Howard"
">> 00:00"|"long after midnight"|"‘What is the time?’
‘Not long after midnight.’
Murilo shook his head, trying to assemble his scattered wits."|"The Conan Chronicles_ Volume 1_ The People of the Black Circle"|"Robert E. Howard"
00:00|midnight|"‘A peculiar question to put to a man recovering consciousness,’ answered the priest. ‘I do not know what time it now is. But it lacked an hour or so of midnight when I was set upon.’"|"The Conan Chronicles_ Volume 1_ The People of the Black Circle"|"Robert E. Howard"
00:00|midnight|"Many died who drank of it; and in those who lived, the drinking wrought change, subtle, gradual and grisly. In adapting themselves to the changing conditions, they had sunk far below their original level. But the lethal waters altered them even more horribly, from generation to more bestial generation. They who had been winged gods became pinioned demons, with all that remained of their ancestors’ vast knowledge distorted and perverted and twisted into ghastly paths. As they had risen higher than mankind might dream, so they sank lower than man’s maddest nightmares reach. They died fast, by cannibalism, and horrible feuds fought out in the murk of the midnight jungle. And at last among the lichen-grown ruins of their city only a single shape lurked, a stunted abhorrent perversion of nature."|"The Conan Chronicles_ Volume 1_ The People of the Black Circle"|"Robert E. Howard"
"~ 00:00"|"about midnight"|"‘Sometime about midnight. Guards in the lower part of the tower, watching the stair that leads up to the cell in which he was imprisoned, heard him cry out, and rushing up the stairs, burst into the cell and found him lying as I have said. I was sleeping in the lower part of the tower as you bade me, and having seen, I came straight here, bidding the guards say naught to anyone.’"|"The Conan Chronicles_ Volume 1_ The People of the Black Circle"|"Robert E. Howard"
00:00|midnight|"But he put aside his fears and mounted to the bronze door, whose smooth surface offered no bolt or catch. Not for naught had he gained access into darksome cults, had barkened to the grisly whispers of the votaries of Skelos under midnight trees, and read the forbidden iron-bound books of Vathelos the Blind. Kneeling before the portal, he searched the sill with nimble fingers; their sensitive tips found projections too small for the eye to detect, or for less-skilled fingers to discover. These he pressed carefully and according to a peculiar system, muttering a long-forgotten incantation as he did so. As he pressed the last projection, he sprang up with frantic haste and struck the exact center of the door a quick sharp blow with his open hand."|"The Conan Chronicles_ Volume 1_ The People of the Black Circle"|"Robert E. Howard"
"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"The unechoing tones ceased, and the girls stared at each other. Then, rising, they stole forth, nor did they speak until they stood once more in Yasmela’s chamber. The princess stared out of the gold-barred windows. The moon had set. It was long past midnight. Sounds of revelry had died away in the gardens and on the roofs of the city. Khoraja slumbered beneath the stars, which seemed to be reflected in the cressets that twinkled among the gardens and along the streets and on the flat roofs of houses where folk slept."|"The Conan Chronicles_ Volume 1_ The People of the Black Circle"|"Robert E. Howard"
"~ 12:00"|"about midday"|"‘I should be lost to all shame,’ she said presently. ‘Yet each memory stings me like a slaver’s whip. I abode in Shah Amurath’s palace, until some weeks agone he rode out with his hosts to do battle with a band of invaders who were ravaging the borders of Turan. Yesterday he returned in triumph, and a great fete was made to honor him. In the drunkenness and rejoicing, I found an opportunity to steal out of the city on a stolen horse. I had thought to escape - but he followed, and about midday came up with me. I outran his vassals, but him I could not escape. Then you came.’"|"The Conan Chronicles_ Volume 1_ The People of the Black Circle"|"Robert E. Howard"
00:00|midnight|"She was undoubtedly a member of a white race, though her skin was very dark. Her square-cut hair was black as midnight, her only garment a wisp of silk about her supple hips."|"The Conan Chronicles_ Volume 1_ The People of the Black Circle"|"Robert E. Howard"
00:00|midnight|"Along the black silent tunnel Conan groped, momentarily dreading a fall into some unseen pit; but at last his feet struck steps again, and he went up them until he came to a door on which his fumbling fingers found a metal catch. He came out into a dim and lofty room of enormous proportions. Fantastic columns marched around the mottled walls, upholding a ceiling, which, at once translucent and dusky, seemed like a cloudy midnight sky, giving an illusion of impossible height. If any light filtered in from the outside it was curiously altered."|"The Conan Chronicles_ Volume 1_ The People of the Black Circle"|"Robert E. Howard"
00:00|midnight|"He found himself in a chamber, not another corridor, and was about to retrace his steps, when he heard a voice which came from behind one of the walls. There was no door in that wall, but he leaned close and heard distinctly. And an icy chill crawled slowly along his spine. The tongue was Nemedian, but the voice was not human. There was a terrifying resonance about it, like a bell tolling at midnight."|"The Conan Chronicles_ Volume 1_ The People of the Black Circle"|"Robert E. Howard"
00:00|midnight|"Then without warning the bombardment ceased. In the stillness Conan heard other noises on the landing outside - the beat of wings, and a muttering voice that was like the whining of wind through midnight branches. Then presently there was silence, but there was a new feel in the air. Only the whetted instincts of barbarism could have sensed it, but Conan knew, without seeing or hearing him leave, that the master of Dagon no longer stood outside the door."|"The Conan Chronicles_ Volume 1_ The People of the Black Circle"|"Robert E. Howard"
00:00|midnight|"There, close to the tapestried wall, she halted suddenly. Conan, watching her, wondered if she had heard the sounds that might be made by a nameless monster stealing through the midnight chambers, and his skin crawled at the thought."|"The Conan Chronicles_ Volume 1_ The People of the Black Circle"|"Robert E. Howard"
12:00|midday|"Westward they forged steadily, halting only to nibble dates and drink water at midday. Amalric fashioned a frail shelter out of his sword and sheath and the saddle blankets to shield her from the burning sun. Weary and stiff from the tossing, bucking gait of the camel, she had to be lifted down in his arms. As he felt again the voluptuous sweetness of her soft body, he felt a hot throb of passion sear through him, and he stood momentarily motionless, intoxicated with the nearness of her, before he laid her down in the shade of the makeshift tent."|"The Conan Chronicles_ Volume 1_ The People of the Black Circle"|"Robert E. Howard"
