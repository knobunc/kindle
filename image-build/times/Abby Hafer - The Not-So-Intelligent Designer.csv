Real information theorists often work with what they call “evolutionary algorithms” and “genetic algorithms” that mimic evolutionary processes. They do this as a means of finding excellent solutions to problems. They deliberately don’t try to design a solution ahead of time, but let simulated evolutionary processes involving random mutations arrive at one."|"The Not-So-Intelligent Designer"|"Abby Hafer"
