“Just under. Three fifty-seven thirty.”
She did a quick calculation. “Gives us a whole six minutes to spare. Tight.”"|"Pawn's Gambit"|"Timothy Zahn"

"ap < 05:00"|"just before five o’clock"|"It was just before five o’clock on May 23, and I was preparing to go home when Dan called me into his office. “Iris, didn’t I meet a couple of professors in the Child Development Department of Cal State Hayward down at USC last January? What were their names?”"|"Pawn's Gambit"|"Timothy Zahn"
"ap 02:00"|two|"“How about tomorrow afternoon?”
“Tomorrow’s Tuesday … yes, my last class is over at two.”
“Good. I’ll see you about two, then. Good-bye.”"|"Pawn's Gambit"|"Timothy Zahn"

"ap ~ 01:00"|"about one o’clock"|"I couldn’t legitimately deny them waiting-room space, so I let them in, hoping that what I knew would be a long wait would discourage them. Three of them did eventually get up and leave, the last one about one o’clock, with whispered apologies to their leader. But McClain stayed all the way until Dan’s last client left at five-thirty, a persistence I had to admire. I consulted briefly with Dan and he agreed to see her."|"Pawn's Gambit"|"Timothy Zahn"

"ap < 01:00"|"just before one o’clock"|"Dan and I arrived at the small lecture room where the experiment was to take place just before one o’clock. The TV and film cameras had long since been set up, and the spectators’ gallery was crammed with nearly fifty reporters and representatives of interested groups. I glimpsed Eve Unger, NIFE’s handpicked representative, and John Cooper of the Family Alliance sitting several rows apart. Near the front, in seats Dan had had reserved for them, were Ron and Susan Brady."|"Pawn's Gambit"|"Timothy Zahn"
"ap 07:58"|"seven fifty-eight"|"I leaned back in my chair and tried to relax. It was already seven fifty-eight, my watch told me, which meant Spars was due on stage in two minutes."|"Pawn's Gambit"|"Timothy Zahn"
"ap < 04:00"|"nearly four o’clock"|"“Well, that’s something, anyway.” I glanced at my watch. It was nearly four o’clock; two and a half hours since we’d left the voodoo acupuncture clinic and maybe as many as sixteen since the doll had been stolen."|"Pawn's Gambit"|"Timothy Zahn"
"ap 05:15"|Five-fifteen|"I looked at my watch. Five-fifteen, with the debate set to begin at nine. Not much time for the kind of wiring Maxwell was talking about. “You think it’ll work?” I asked Pak."|"Pawn's Gambit"|"Timothy Zahn"

Of course, with the CURL in place, all that sunlight could be just an illusion. Still, Angel could feel the warmth on her face, so it probably was real."|"Pawn's Gambit"|"Timothy Zahn"
00:00|midnight|"Unfortunately, with this particular illusion her shadow trick wouldn’t be of any use. But she didn’t need tricks anymore. She knew human nature, and she understood how the real world operated, and she knew there had to be a road somewhere across the moat to let in the midnight truckloads of supplies used to restock the prisoners’ food bins. And the logical place for the five real guards to have clustered was the spot where that road came in, where they would be going out again when their shift was over."|"Pawn's Gambit"|"Timothy Zahn"
