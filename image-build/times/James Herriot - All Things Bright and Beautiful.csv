Well we won’t be there and it’s his own fault.” He looked at the great curly-coated animal tripping along, a picture of health and energy. “Well, I suppose we’d have been wasting our time examining that dog in any case. There’s nothing really wrong with him.”"|"All Things Bright and Beautiful"|"James Herriot"

His face looked as boyish and innocent as ever but the lines of exhaustion round his eyes and mouth told an eloquent story. Last night he had travelled with the darts team from the Lord Nelson and had taken part in a gruelling match against the Dog and Gun at Drayton. The contest had been followed by a pie and peas supper and the consumption of something like twelve pints of bitter a man. Tristan had crawled into bed at 3 a.m. and was clearly in a delicate condition."|"All Things Bright and Beautiful"|"James Herriot"

The hospitable Dales people were continually asking me in for some kind of refreshment—a “bit o’ dinner” perhaps, but if it wasn’t midday there was usually a mug of tea and a scone or a hunk of thick-crusted apple pie—but Mrs. Dalby invariably set out a special tray. And there it was today with a clean cloth and the best china cup and saucer and side plates with sliced buttered scones and iced cakes and malt bread and biscuits. It was on its own table away from the big kitchen table."|"All Things Bright and Beautiful"|"James Herriot"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"It was strange that after my thoughts had been on Raynes during the day I should be called to the village at one o’clock the following morning. Crawling from bed and climbing wearily into my clothes I couldn’t help thinking of Tristan curled up peacefully in his Edinburgh lodgings far away from the troubles of practice. But I didn’t feel too bad about getting up; Raynes was only three miles away and the job held no prospect of hard labour—a colic in a little boy’s Shetland pony. And it was a fine night—very cold with the first chill of autumn but with a glorious full moon to light my way along the road."|"All Things Bright and Beautiful"|"James Herriot"

I remember when there was a great long row of ’em and the barfins and bridles hangin’ there on the stalls and the rest of the harness behind them all shinin’ on t’wall.” He transferred his plug of tobacco to the other side of his mouth and smiled. “By gaw, I were in here at six o’clock every morning feedin’ them and gettin’ them ready for work and ah’ll tell you it was a sight to see us all goin’ off ploughing at the start o’ the day. Maybe six pairs of ’osses setting off with their harness jinglin’ and the ploughmen sittin’ sideways on their backs. Like a regular procession it was.”"|"All Things Bright and Beautiful"|"James Herriot"

The queue started forming almost at first fight and by ten o’clock there would be a milling throng almost blocking the street. Apart from the regulars the odd canine visitor passing through would join the company, and no matter what his breed or size he was readily accepted into the club, adding one more to the assortment of stupid expressions, lolling tongues and waving tails; because, motley crew though they were, they were all happily united in the roisterous, bawdy camaraderie of lust."|"All Things Bright and Beautiful"|"James Herriot"
