07:00|"7 a.m."|"Daily Mass for me is at 7 a.m. Our chapel here in the Jesuit community of the Vatican Observatory overlooks the courtyard where the Pope presides; we want to be finished before he starts, so that we don’t have to compete with the singing that fills the whole palace. Most of the year, our quarters here in the Alban Hills south of Rome are quiet and almost deserted. But for 2 months, mid-July through September, they’re filled with activity as the Pope comes to escape the summer heat of Rome. Terms of Use"|"Brother Astronomer"|"Guy Consolmagno"
"ap < 09:00"|"nearly nine o’clock"|"But my own spirit is flagging. It’s nearly nine o’clock now, I’ve been at my computer for an hour and a half, and I’ve only just finished going through the mail."|"Brother Astronomer"|"Guy Consolmagno"
"ap 10:00"|"Ten o’clock"|"Ten o’clock, and a chime on my computer wakes me up. It’s time for coffee. There’s an industrial-strength cappuccino machine in our kitchen, and a number of Italians who really know how to use it."|"Brother Astronomer"|"Guy Consolmagno"
"ap 01:30"|1:30|"And before I know it, it’s 1:30. Time for pranzo. My community has the big meal of the day now: a simple but delicious feast, courses of pasta, meat, salad, and fruit. The table conversation is one of the best parts of being a Jesuit. When a half dozen Ph.D.s start talking, you feel like you’re getting university credits just for listening in. If learning is your passion, this is heaven."|"Brother Astronomer"|"Guy Consolmagno"
00:00|midnight|"I wake up again around five. Soon enough, I’ll be climbing the stairs
back to my office to work until midnight.
But for now, I spend an hour in prayer . . . contemplating . . ."|"Brother Astronomer"|"Guy Consolmagno"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"“Hmm,” he replied. “That’s kind of what I thought, too. But my editor says I have two columns to fill by five o’clock.”"|"Brother Astronomer"|"Guy Consolmagno"
04:00|"four in the morning"|"When I was a graduate student in the 1970s, studying the solar system at the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory in Arizona, I knew all about comets. I could quote the facts and figures, write the equations that described their comas and tails, and explain in painful detail their interactions with the plasma of the solar wind. I had that stuff down cold. So when my friend Bob Howell suggested that I might want to get up at four in the morning to actually see a real comet, Comet West, rising in the east, I honestly saw no reason to lose any sleep over it."|"Brother Astronomer"|"Guy Consolmagno"
"~ 04:00"|"about 4 a.m."|"But, by chance, I did wake up the next morning about 4 a.m. After a grumbling debate with myself, I decided to pull on my jeans and go outside to take a look. The Arizona morning was chilly, the stony driveway around our low-rent house was hard on my bare feet, but I dragged myself out the front door, around the side of the house, and looked to the east."|"Brother Astronomer"|"Guy Consolmagno"
16:18|1618|"But from 1577 until 1618 there had been no further naked eye comet visible in Europe. There was no way for others to see for themselves what a comet looked like. All they had were written reports and “artists’ conceptions,” the sorts of evidence that is very easy for a skeptic to discount (remember Thomas Jefferson and his attitude toward meteorites?) especially when they flew in the face of a well-established world view."|"Brother Astronomer"|"Guy Consolmagno"
"< 12:00"|"nearly noon"|"Filing out, I looked for myself. All the engines still seemed to be attached, as far as I could see. Nonetheless, we stood on the tarmac till nearly noon, dressed for Antarctica in the ever-growing heat of a Christchurch November day. Ralph, the old hand, had warned us ...we could be leaving at any moment, or the flight could be postponed several days."|"Brother Astronomer"|"Guy Consolmagno"
"> 12:00"|"a little after noon"|"But we did get off, just a little after noon. The flight was 8 hours, at 300 miles an hour, in an unpressurized, unsoundproofed military plane, sitting on benches designed to have parachutes between you and the seat, crammed together like sardines, where conversation or listening to music was impossible (the engines were so loud). And the sack lunches included packets of chocolate pudding, but no spoons. Last time I fly that airline!"|"Brother Astronomer"|"Guy Consolmagno"
"> 20:00"|"just after 8 p.m."|"It was just after 8 p.m., almost dark, by the time we reached McMurdo. Indeed, sundown was a mere ...3 months away. Well, it felt dark. It felt like night. McMurdo’s sunshine did look different in the evening."|"Brother Astronomer"|"Guy Consolmagno"
"ap 04:59"|"one to five"|"There’s not much to do in McMurdo. Outside of a bar and a coffeehouse, a library that’s open only during odd hours, and a cafeteria that’s likewise only open a few hours a day, there aren’t many places to go except to work or back to the room you share with one to five other people . . . who soon become just as sick of you as you are of them. So when Ralph was asked to talk about ALH84001, he packed the cafeteria with a full audience. He gave a good talk; he explained the science, and the controversy, in clear and (for him) relatively civil terms. Of course, afterwards, this just added to our notoriety on base."|"Brother Astronomer"|"Guy Consolmagno"
"ap 06:45"|"Quarter to seven"|"HE NEXT morning, I woke up and something seemed strange. I held the wristwatch up to my eye; but I couldn’t read it. (I wore my watch on my wrist all night, to keep it warm.) Strange; its fancy dial used to glow in the dark all night long, but now I couldn’t see a thing. In the dark. Oh. Yeah. I pushed the black sleep mask up off my eyes and peered into the 24hour yellow glow of our Scott tents. Quarter to seven, said my watch."|"Brother Astronomer"|"Guy Consolmagno"
"ap 07:30"|"seven thirty"|"We’d still wake up at seven, with hope; but the rattle of the windblown snow on the tent would give us the bad news. By seven thirty, our morning ablutions complete, Ralph or John would radio in to McMurdo. We’d leave the radio on, just to listen to him and all the other teams of scientists from around the continent with their morning check-ins."|"Brother Astronomer"|"Guy Consolmagno"
"ap 09:00"|"Nine o’clock"|"Nine o’clock was normally our time for gathering in front of John’s tent to hear the day’s plans. But on these snowy days, John and Ralph would meet alone, in John’s tent. After, Ralph would walk over to the women’s tent, explain what was happening, then come back to ours. I usually got no more than a brief digest. If I’d ask for details, Ralph would get this “didn’t I just explain this twice, first to John and René, and then to Laurie and Sara?” look."|"Brother Astronomer"|"Guy Consolmagno"
10:00|"1000 hours"|"Meanwhile, Ralph was chatting with the folks at McMurdo. “That’s a Roger,” he was saying. “Expecting the copter at 1000 hours. We’ll show the nice folks a good time.” Signing off, he nodded my way. “DVs at ten o’clock.”"|"Brother Astronomer"|"Guy Consolmagno"

"~ 02:00"|"About 2 a.m."|"Opened only when no one else was around? There was no such time! So I invented one. About 2 a.m. every morning, when I knew that René (or Ralph) was asleep, I’d wake myself up and pull out the red bag. I’d say a morning prayer and check the Ordo for the day’s scripture readings, looking them up in my tiny-print Bible. And then I’d follow a little set of prayers that Father Joep van Beeck, SJ, my retreat director back in Chicago, had put together for taking the Eucharist outside of the Mass."|"Brother Astronomer"|"Guy Consolmagno"
00:00|midnight|"The last lines felt especially appropriate here in the land of the midnight sun."|"Brother Astronomer"|"Guy Consolmagno"
00:00|midnight|"My sense of direction was, in fact, constantly turned around in Antarctica. I was used to thinking of the Sun as sitting in the southern half of the sky. Even though I knew in my head that here in the southern hemisphere the opposite was true, this instinct persisted, so that I constantly confused north and south. Indeed, at some level I would more easily believe that the Sun traveled west to east than to give up this idea that the Sun was in the south. Of course, that made midnight all the more confusing; because then, the Sun really was in the south, and it really did travel west to east."|"Brother Astronomer"|"Guy Consolmagno"
09:00|"9 a.m."|"It was 9 a.m. Christmas morning, and we were up and scurrying around the camp, doing the final packing, tying the boxes onto the Nansen sleds and roping up their canvas sides. It was time to go home."|"Brother Astronomer"|"Guy Consolmagno"
