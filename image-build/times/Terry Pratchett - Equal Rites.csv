00:00|midnight|"Granny Weatherwax didn’t sleep more than a few hours a night, as a rule, and woke again at midnight. The room hadn’t changed, although the lantern had its own little solar system of very stupid moths."|"Equal Rites"|"Terry Pratchett"
12:00|Noon|"Noon came, and gradually the light drained out of another day. She paced the floor of the kitchen aimlessly. Occasionally she would throw herself into frantic bouts of housework; ancient crusts were unceremoniously dug out of the cracks in the flagstones, and the fireback was scraped free of the winter’s soot and blackleaded to within an inch of its life. A nest of mice in the back of the dresser were kindly but firmly ejected into the goatshed."|"Equal Rites"|"Terry Pratchett"
12:00|noon|"At noon the drones returned, and Granny read in the sharp acid thoughts of the hivemind that there was no sign of Esk."|"Equal Rites"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"“You mean tobacco threadworm?” He looked wild-eyed at the stack of bales being unloaded by, now he came to think about it, a vendor with the nervous look of a midnight sprite who wants to get away before you find out what fairy gold turns into in the morning. “But he told me these had been well stored and—how do you know, anyway?”"|"Equal Rites"|"Terry Pratchett"
12:00|midday|"The midday sun beat down off the cliff and the air around Esk began to smell of bees and gin. She lay back, looking at the near-purple dome of the sky through the leaves and, eventually, she fell asleep."|"Equal Rites"|"Terry Pratchett"
">> 00:00"|"long after midnight"|"She woke up shivering. It was long after midnight and the stars looked damp and chilly; the air was full of the busy silence of the night, which is created by hundreds of small furry things treading very carefully in the hope of finding dinner while avoiding being the main course."|"Equal Rites"|"Terry Pratchett"
"~ 03:00"|"around three o’clock in the morning"|"It was really quite a short trip but one that Granny knew she would always remember, generally around three o’clock in the morning after eating rich food. She would remember the rainbow colors that hummed in the rushing air, the horrible heavy feeling, the impression that something very big and heavy was sitting on the universe."|"Equal Rites"|"Terry Pratchett"
05:00|"five A.M."|"There were some good points, she had to admit. The food was simple but there was plenty of it, and she had a room to herself somewhere in the roof and it was quite luxurious because here she could lie in until five A.M., which to Granny’s way of thinking was practically noon. The work certainly wasn’t hard. She just started sweeping until the staff realized what was expected of it, and then she could amuse herself until it was finished. If anyone came the staff would immediately lean itself nonchalantly against a wall."|"Equal Rites"|"Terry Pratchett"
