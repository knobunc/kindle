He was waiting patiently himself, looking out the hundred-and-fifth floor window over the towerscape of the People’s Republic of Haven’s capital city. Nouveau Paris had a certain tattered beauty still, even after generations of decay under the Legislaturalists’ grotesque economic policies and the strain of the long war with Manticore. From this height all you could see was the grandeur of her towers. Not the empty windows and broken lights, not the curdled rage and suspicion, the terror of the mass arrests and the cold fear of midnight disappearances. Or the worse nightmare of the People’s Courts and mob vengeance that outdid even the old gangs. Worst of all were the ones who came back from “Re-Socialization Centers.” Very quiet people who talked seldom and worked like machines. Usually they had no teeth."|"More Than Honor"|"David Weber"

Thus the Planet Manticore’s day consists of 22 hours (numbered 01:00 to 22:59) plus a 27-minute-long Comp, while Sphinx’s day consists of 25 hours (numbered 01:00 to 25:59) plus a 37-minute Comp. The planetary week is seven planetary days long in each case, and Manticore’s day is used aboard all Royal Navy vessels."|"More Than Honor"|"David Weber"
