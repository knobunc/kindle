00:00|midnight|"She looked across the waiting room at her Citizen Commissioner-translated, political watchbeast-Erasmus Fontein. He was waiting patiently himself, looking out the hundred-and-fifth floor window over the towerscape of the People’s Republic of Haven’s capital city. Nouveau Paris had a certain tattered beauty still, even after generations of decay under the Legislaturalists’ grotesque economic policies and the strain of the long war with Manticore. From this height all you could see was the grandeur of her towers. Not the empty windows and broken lights, not the curdled rage and suspicion, the terror of the mass arrests and the cold fear of midnight disappearances. Or the worse nightmare of the People’s Courts and mob vengeance that outdid even the old gangs. Worst of all were the ones who came back from “Re-Socialization Centers.” Very quiet people who talked seldom and worked like machines. Usually they had no teeth."|"More Than Honor"|"David Weber"

Thus the Planet Manticore’s day consists of 22 hours (numbered 01:00 to 22:59) plus a 27-minute-long Comp, while Sphinx’s day consists of 25 hours (numbered 01:00 to 25:59) plus a 37-minute Comp. The planetary week is seven planetary days long in each case, and Manticore’s day is used aboard all Royal Navy vessels."|"More Than Honor"|"David Weber"

17:50|1750|"By 1750 pd, the Republic-no longer “The Republic of Haven,” but now “The People’s Republic of Haven”-had become the captive of a coalition of professional politicians (indeed, politicians who had never had and were not qualified for any other career) and the Quorum, aided and abetted by a morally and intellectually bankrupt academic community and a mass media philosophically at home with the Quorum’s objectives and cowed (where necessary) by threats of blacklisting. That the Quorum could succeed in blacklisting journalists had been demonstrated in 1746 pd, in the case of Adele Wasserman, one of the last moderate journalists. Her moderation, which was actually a bit left of center by mid-17th century standards, was labeled “conservative” or, more frequently, “reactionary” by her 18th century contemporaries. She herself was called “an enemy of the common man,” “a slave of the monied powers,” and (most cutting slur then available on Haven) “a fiscal elitist,” and her employer, one of the last independent news services, was pressured into terminating her contract (for “socially insensitive and inappropriate demagoguery”) by means of an economic boycott, strikes, and governmental pressure. Her firing, followed by her subsequent relocation to the Kingdom of Manticore and a successful career as a leading theorist of the Centrist Party, was the writing on the wall for any who had eyes. Unless something quite extraordinary intervened, the current Havenite system was doomed."|"More Than Honor"|"David Weber"
