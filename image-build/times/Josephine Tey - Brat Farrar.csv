"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"Bee waited till Evensong would be over, and then walked across the fields to the Rectory. Ostensibly, she was going to tell them the news; actually she was going to pour out her troubles to George Peck. When George could withdraw his mind sufficiently from the classic world to focus it on the present one, he was a comfortable person to talk to. Unemotional and unshockable. Bee supposed that an intimate acquaintance with classic on-goings, topped-off with a cure of souls in a country parish, had so conditioned him to shocks that he had long ago become immune from further attack. Neither ancient iniquity nor modern English back-sliding surprised him. So it was not to Nancy, her friend, that she was taking her unquiet heart, but to the Rector. Nancy would wrap her round with warm affection and sympathy, but it was not sympathy she needed; it was support. Besides, if she was to find understanding it would not be with Nancy, who had forgotten Patrick's very existence, but with George Peck, who would most certainly remember the boy he had taught."|"Brat Farrar"|"Josephine Tey"
"> 16:30"|"after Evensong"|"She found the Rector where she knew he would be. Always after Evensong it was his habit to go and stare at something in the garden; usually at something at the farther end of the garden from which he could not be too easily recalled to the trivialities of social obligation. This evening he was staring at a purple lilac and polluting the fragrant air with a pipe that smelt like a damp bonfire. ""There should be a by-law against pipes like George's,"" his wife had said, and the present sample was no exception. It depressed Bee still further."|"Brat Farrar"|"Josephine Tey"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"""Bee! How nice,"" she said. ""Were you at Evensong, and did you see the latest contingent from our local school for scandalisers? Two adolescents who are 'studying the prevalent English superstitions': to wit, the Church of England. A boy, very hairy for fourteen, it seemed to me; and a girl with eleven combs keeping up her not very abundant wisps. What would you say a passion for combs was an indication of? A sense of insecurity?"""|"Brat Farrar"|"Josephine Tey"
"ap 09:30"|nine-thirty|"""You have La Parslow at nine-thirty to-morrow,"" Simon reminded her. ""I saw it in the book."""|"Brat Farrar"|"Josephine Tey"

""Too tired for breakfast at eight-thirty?""
""That sounds luxuriously late to me."""|"Brat Farrar"|"Josephine Tey"

"ap 06:00"|"six o'clock"|"Before lunch was over the first of the visitors arrived; and the steady stream went on, from after-luncheon coffee, through tea, to six o'clock drinks. They had all come to inspect Brat, but he noticed that those who had known Patrick Ashby came with a genuine pleasure in welcoming him back. Each of them had some small memory of him to recount, and all of them had kept the memory green because they had liked Pat Ashby and grieved for him. And Brat caught himself being gratified in an absurd and proprietorial way, as if some protege of his own was being praised. The light that had been shed on Simon this morning made him more than ever Patrick's champion. It was all wrong that Latchetts should have been Simon's all those years. It was Patrick's inheritance and it was all wrong that Patrick should not be here to inherit it. Patrick was all right. Patrick would not have gone sick with rage because his best girl had a better horse than he had. Patrick was all right."|"Brat Farrar"|"Josephine Tey"
"ap ~ 00:45"|"about a quarter to one"|"As Bee turned into the car park she said: ""You don't want to tail round looking at 'sea-food' for Mr. Sandal's consumption. Go away and amuse yourself, and we'll meet for lunch at the Angel about a quarter to one."""|"Brat Farrar"|"Josephine Tey"
"ap 07:29"|seven-twenty-nine|"In the first light of early morning the boy's jacket was found by a coastguard patrolling along the cliffs. Albert Potticary, the coastguard in question, gave evidence that the coat was lying about fifty yards from the cliff-edge, just where the path from Tanbitches began to descend through the gap to the harbour at Westover. It was lying a few yards off the path on the side nearer the cliff, and was weighted in its place by a stone. It was wet with dew when he picked it up, and the pockets were empty except for a note written in thin ink. The note was the one now shown him. He telephoned the news to the police and at once instituted a search for a body on the beach. No body was found. High tide the previous night had been at seven-twenty-nine, and if the boy had fallen into the water, or if he had fallen before high-water so that his body was taken out by the tide, it would not be washed up again at Westover. No one drowned in the Westover district had ever been washed up nearer than Castleton, away to the west; and most of them farther west than that. He was therefore not hopeful of finding any body when he instituted the search. It was merely routine."|"Brat Farrar"|"Josephine Tey"
00:00|midnight|"""You haven't got my favourite in your collection,"" she said, having examined his choice, and brought another tome from the shelves. And then, finding that he was totally ignorant, she took him back to the beginning and showed him the foundations-Arab, Barb, and Turk-of the finished product. By midnight there were more books on the floor than there were on the shelves but they had both had a marvellous time."|"Brat Farrar"|"Josephine Tey"
"ap 00:30"|twelve-thirty|"""In case you get lost, Brat,"" Bee said to him when he came down, ""lunch is at twelve-thirty in the luncheon tent. The last table to your left as you come in. What do you plan to do this morning? Poke the pigs?"""|"Brat Farrar"|"Josephine Tey"

"< 00:00"|"A little before midnight"|"This was perhaps the first and the last night he would ever dance with Eleanor. A little before midnight they went up together to the buffet, filled their plates, and took them to one of the little tables in the balcony. The buffet was part of the actual hotel building, and the balcony, a piece of Regency ironwork, looked down on the little garden at the side of the hotel. Chinese lanterns hung in the garden and above the tables in the balcony."|"Brat Farrar"|"Josephine Tey"
00:00|midnight|"Brat let her go and sought counsel in the bar. There was some sort of stunt in the assembly room at midnight, and the bar was deserted except for Simon, all by himself with a bottle of champagne at a table in the far corner."|"Brat Farrar"|"Josephine Tey"
"ap 07:30"|"half-past seven"|"He came back to Bures at breakfast time, and put the car in the garage. The Chequers vestibule had a littered look; it was still only half-past seven, and show people notoriously made a night of it. He went up to Number 17 and found Simon fast asleep, with all his clothes in one single heap on the floor just as he had peeled them off. He changed into his day clothes, quietly at first and then less carefully as he realised that only long shaking would awaken Simon in his present condition. He looked down at Simon and marvelled. He slept quietly, like a child. Had he grown so used to the thing after eight years that it no longer troubled him, or was it that it never had been a monstrous thing in his estimation?"|"Brat Farrar"|"Josephine Tey"
"ap 01:00"|one|"It was so like Simon, Bee thought, to be reading the list of runners at Newmarket, peppering his soup, and listening to the conversation at one and the same time."|"Brat Farrar"|"Josephine Tey"
"ap 06:00"|"six o'clock"|"Pat Ashby must have been killed between the time that old Abel met him in the early afternoon and the moment when Mr. Pilbeam had to chase Simon home for six o'clock supper."|"Brat Farrar"|"Josephine Tey"
"ap 02:00"|"two o'clock"|"It was two o'clock when he came to himself, and he went to have lunch at a small pub in the harbour. They had nothing much left, but it did not matter because he sat staring at his plate until they put the bill in front of him."|"Brat Farrar"|"Josephine Tey"
"ap 04:00"|"four o'clock"|"""And you think that I've been walking about in the rain since four o'clock because of a little joke of Simon's? You think that I came here to-night and confessed to not being Patrick because of a little joke of Simon's?"" The Rector was silent. ""Tell me, Rector, were you surprised when Pat committed suicide?"""|"Brat Farrar"|"Josephine Tey"
"< 02:00"|"towards two o'clock in the morning"|"And that, when Brat took his leave towards two o'clock in the morning, was still the Rector's opinion."|"Brat Farrar"|"Josephine Tey"
"ap 00:30"|"half-past twelve"|"The household went early to bed, still tired from their excitements at Bures, and he gave them till half-past twelve, and then prospected. There seemed to be no light anywhere. There was certainly no sound. He went downstairs and took the rope from its corner. He unlatched the dining-room window, stepped over the sill into the night, and drew it gently down again behind him. He waited for any reaction, but there was none."|"Brat Farrar"|"Josephine Tey"
07:00|"seven o'clock in the morning"|"Bee sat in the dingy cafe with a cup of slopped coffee in front of her and read the sign on the other side of the road for the hundredth time in the last forty-eight hours. The sign said: MOTORISTS. PLEASE REFRAIN FROM USING YOUR HORN. THIS IS A HOSPITAL. It was only seven o'clock in the morning, but the cafe opened at six, and there was always at least one other customer having a meal as she sat there. She did not notice them. She just sat with a cup of coffee in front of her and stared at the hospital wall opposite. She was an old inhabitant of the cafe by now. ""Better go out and have a meal,"" they would say kindly, and she would cross the road and sit for a little with a cup of coffee in front of her and then go back again."|"Brat Farrar"|"Josephine Tey"

"ap 06:00"|"six o'clock"|"So the problem of Simon was settled. Simon who, before he was fourteen, had killed his brother, calmly written a note on that brother's behalf, tossed the pen into the abyss after his brother's body, and gone home calmly to six o'clock supper when he was chased out of the smithy. Who had joined the night search for his brother on his pony, and some time during that long night had taken his brother's coat to the cliff-top and left it there with the note in the pocket. Who was now to be mourned by the countryside as a high-spirited young man of memorable charm."|"Brat Farrar"|"Josephine Tey"
"ap 02:00"|"two o'clock"|"The turning on of the wireless had been so absent-minded a gesture that she did not know that she had done it.

There were no survivors."""|"Brat Farrar"|"Josephine Tey"
19:00|"seven in the evening"|"Loding was right: it had been a wonderful briefing. For a whole fortnight, from early morning till seven in the evening, rain or shine, they had sat in Kew Gardens and rehearsed the ways of Latchetts and Clare, the histories of Ashbys and Ledinghams, the lie of a land he had never seen. And that too had been exciting. He had always been what they called ""good at exams""; and had always come to an examination paper with the same faint pleasure that an addict brings to a quiz party. And those fourteen days in Kew Gardens had been one glorified quiz party. Indeed, the last few days had had some of the tight-rope excitement that had characterised this afternoon. ""Which arm did you bowl with?"" ""Go to the stables from the side door."" ""Did you sing?"" ""Could you play the piano?"" ""Who lived in the lodge at Clare?"" ""What colour was your mother's hair?"" ""How did your father make his money, apart from the estate?"" ""What was the name of his firm?"" ""What was your favourite food?"" ""The name of the tuck-shop owner in the village?"" ""Where is the Ashby pew in the church?"" ""Go from the great drawing-room to the butler's pantry in Clare."" ""What was the housekeeper's name?"" ""Could you ride a bicycle?"" ""What do you see from the south window in the attic?"" Loding fired the questions at him through the long days, and it had been first amusing and then exciting to avoid being stumped."|"Brat Farrar"|"Josephine Tey"
