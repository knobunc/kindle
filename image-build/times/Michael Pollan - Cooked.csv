			covers. I lifted one of them and marveled at the transformation: What had been a flabby

			some muscle tone. Its skin was gorgeous: lacquered brown, the color of strong tea. The

			countless gallons of (premixed) barbecue sauce. Ed and Aubrey had put the pigs on the

11:00|"11:00 a.m."|"By now I knew the drill, or thought I did,
			and got right to work pulling pork from a nicely browned side of pig that Aubrey had
			delivered to my chopping block. There was something unexpectedly powerful about the

			Yet there is nothing Manhattan cannot absorb, and the scene didn’t take long to
			feel almost normal. I flattered myself into thinking I knew what I was doing, but it soon became clear I wasn’t in Wilson, North Carolina,
			anymore—and in fact was in way over my head. At 11:00 a.m. sharp, The Pit crew had begun
			selling sandwiches, and they sold out the first batch so quickly that the
			sandwich-making crew began calling, with mounting insistence, for more pork. I was
			chopping as fast as I could, but there was a limit to how fast you could go. Not only
			were my arms growing rubbery, but I wanted to be sure there were no little bones or bits
			of cartilage left in the meat before I released another pile of barbecue to the servers.
			What if someone chomped down on an overlooked vertebra? Manhattan might have the lowest
			number of barbecue grills per capita, but surely it has the highest number of lawyers.
			Yet the clamor from the sandwich crew wouldn’t let up. “More pork, please!
			We need more pork up here!” I was chopping pork as fast as my arms would let
			me, then pouring gallons of sauce over the pile, all the while scanning and sifting the
			meat for suspicious bits of white. As soon as I passed a sheet tray heaped with barbecue
			to the sandwich crew, Aubrey deposited another steaming pig on my chopping block, and
			the process started all over again."|Cooked|"Michael Pollan"
13:00|"1:00 p.m."|"I found out later we sold out by 1:00 p.m.,
			eight whole hogs and two thousand sandwiches snapped up in something less than two

			eight more pigs, and eventually they must have drifted off to other stands, other
			sandwiches. But I was long gone by then, eager to escape the crowd and the heat."|Cooked|"Michael Pollan"
"ap 02:50"|250|"And in fact I must confess that the best

			a gently smoldering fire gently smoldering quite that long. So, rather than keep a
			mother fire burning all that time, and then have to lift up a hot grate and shovel fresh
			coals underneath it, I take the meat off the wood fire once the temperature in the grill
			has dropped below 225˚F or so. By then, I figure the meat has received most of the
			blessing of wood smoke, the flavor of which cooked meat can’t absorb anyway. Now
			the meat just needs more heat and time: a couple more hours at 250˚F to 300˚F. And
