The ceiling has round arches and the floors are marble; the corridors are flanked by pillars, decorated with the occasional stained-glass window and fire extinguisher. In the conference room, dead men stare down from gold-framed oil paintings. The meeting starts at exactly 10:00 a.m."|"Lost in Math"|"Sabine Hossenfelder"
"ap 03:00"|three|"If one does this calculation for the standard model, the curves agree with measurements at presently accessible energies. Extrapolated to higher energies, the strengths of the forces meet at three different points (see Figure 8, top). If one adds supersymmetry, however, they meet at one point (up to uncertainty from the measurement of the low-energy values), which is called “gauge-coupling unification” (Figure 8, bottom). If there is fundamentally only one gauge symmetry, there is fundamentally also only one coupling constant, and hence the three different couplings eventually must converge. That susy makes the constants match at high energies has been one of the strongest motivations to pursue the theory. Is gauge coupling unification necessary? No. Is it pretty? It certainly is."|"Lost in Math"|"Sabine Hossenfelder"
