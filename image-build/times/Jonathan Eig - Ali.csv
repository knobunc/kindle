She composed the biography at the request of a magazine writer in 1966. “Cassius Jr’s life to me was an unusual one from other Children, and he is still unusual today,” Odessa wrote. “When a baby he would never sit down. When I would take him for a stroll in his stroller, he would always stand up and try to see everything. He tried to talk at a very early age. He tried so hard he learned to walk at 10 months old. When he was one year old he would love for some One to rock him to sleep, if not he would sit in a Chair and keep bomping his head on the back of the Chair until he would go to sleep. He did not want you to dress him or undress him. He would always crie. He wanted to feed himself when he was very young. At the age of 2 years old he always got up at 5 in the morning and throw everything Out of the Dresser’s drawer and leave the things in the middle of the floor. He loved to play in water. He loved to talks a lot and he love to eat, loved to climb up on things. He would not play with his toyes. He would take all the Pots and pan Out of the Cabienet and beat on them. He Could beat on anything and get rhythm. When a very small Child he walked upon his toes, By doing this he has Well developed Arch’s, and that is why he is so fast on his feet.”"|Ali|"Jonathan Eig"

As he prepared for the toughest opponent he’d ever met, Alonzo Johnson, Clay told anyone who would listen that he was ready for Floyd Patterson, that he, Clay, was the greatest, the soon-to-be youngest champ in history, a fighter like no other the heavyweight division had seen, too fast to be hit, too strong to be hurt. Reporters didn’t buy it. Neither did Alonzo Johnson, loser of six of eight previous fights but once a highly rated contender. Johnson managed to go the distance with Clay and made the young fighter look bad at times before losing on points. “He knocked me down once but I wasn’t hurt,” Johnson said years later, reclining in a chair in his basement, where fight posters and old black-and-white photos filled the walls."|Ali|"Jonathan Eig"
"~ 18:00"|"about 6 p.m."|"When he left the rink at about 6 p.m., it was already dark. Streetlights guided men and women on their way home from work. Across the street from the roller rink, Clay spotted a crowd on the sidewalk and decided to check it out, hoping to find “a pretty girl to say something to,” as he recalled years later in a letter. By the time he got across the street, Clay recognized what was happening. The crowd was listening to a black man in a dark suit preaching on the wisdom of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad, leader of the Nation of Islam."|Ali|"Jonathan Eig"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"Clay knew about the Nation of Islam. He could recite lyrics from Minister Louis X’s song, “The White Man’s Heaven Is the Black Man’s Hell,” and he had heard a similar street-corner speech in Harlem before his trip to Rome. But the newspaper was probably new to him; this was only the second issue of Muhammad Speaks. Clay accepted a copy, and the man in the dark suit invited him to attend a meeting at eight o’clock that evening at 27th and Chestnut Streets."|Ali|"Jonathan Eig"
16:30|"4:30 in the afternoon"|"While lying in bed one day, Clay explained his media strategy to a reporter from the Miami News. “Now take those Associated Press reporters,” he said. “I always talk to them. I don’t let them get away. Some of them send to thirty-eight papers. Ebony and Jet come around; I see them. Negroes want to know about me . . . Now take Time . . . that magazine goes to intelligent people. People who don’t go to fights much. They read about me and want to go to fights. They talk about me. And your paper. Cover all of Miami and Florida. Lots of people down there . . . Networks come around, I’m glad to see them. Millions of people watching. Only ones I had to send away is those little radio stations that put you on at 4:30 in the afternoon and nobody’s listening.” He even began the process of building his own mythology: “I was marked,” he told one reporter. “I had a big head and I looked like Joe Louis in the cradle. People said so. One day I threw my first punch and hit my mother right in the teeth and knocked one out.”"|Ali|"Jonathan Eig"

At night, Clay showed movies on a big screen, outside in the yard, with moths fluttering in the projector light beam and traffic rumbling by. Most of the time, no one paid much attention to the movie, because there was too much laughter and noise. Clay had a habit of explaining the action on the screen for the children seated around him. Only the scary movies—The Invasion of the Body Snatchers, for one—kept the racket down. When the movies were over, Clay’s entourage remained, sleeping two or three to a room. In Clay’s bedroom, a tiny oil painting of a New England harbor scene hung on one wall, along with taped-up newspaper articles about the upcoming fight. Every morning, Bundini Brown would wake Clay at 5 or 5:30 so the boxer could lace up a pair of heavy army boots, size 13EEE, and run three or four miles. After running, Clay would eat a big breakfast and head to the Fifth Street Gym, where he would hit the bags, spar a few rounds, and entertain the press corps.

Clay arrived first, as is customary for the challenger. He wore white shorts with a vertical red stripe on each side and a short white robe. Liston entered the ring looking like a giant sweat sock, his neck and shoulders wrapped in white towels, with a white terrycloth robe over the towels and a white hood over his head. He looked solemn, even bored, as he shuffled his feet and stared at the mat. The referee, Barney Felix, instructed the men to join him in the center of the ring, and Clay and Liston stepped close enough to feel each other’s breath. It was time for Liston to intimidate, as he had intimidated all his other opponents, but Clay wasn’t going for it. Liston stared ahead blankly, motionless. Clay stood straight, possibly rising slightly on his tiptoes. When Felix told the men to shake hands, they didn’t. They turned and walked to their corners."|Ali|"Jonathan Eig"

Some accounts said his weight had ballooned to 240 pounds, while others put it at 225. Either way, he had work to do, so he wore a pair of five-pound work boots and carried pound-and-a-half weights in each hand when he ran. Almost every day after his run he watched film of his first fight with Liston, and after viewing it often enough, he pinpointed the key to victory: It had come down to his ability to dodge Liston’s jabs. Once Liston realized his jabs weren’t connecting, the bigger, slower fighter had tried leading with left hooks, but that hadn’t worked either, because Ali was too fast to get caught by a lead hook. That had left Liston with no options. Unable to play the aggressor, he grew frustrated and fatigued, while Ali slammed away."|Ali|"Jonathan Eig"

But it would be the worst thing I could do to go in there with my mind all made up what to do. I been fighting since I was a child, and I do everything on instinct.

His mistake, if it can be called one, was in attempting to make a boxing match stand for something more than a fistfight. He declared his contest against Ali a holy war. Patterson said Ali had a right to believe in any religion he wanted. But, he added, “I have rights, too. I have the right to call the Black Muslims a menace to the United States and a menace to the Negro race. I have a right to say the Black Muslims stink. . . .

Ali drove her to school every morning and picked her up every afternoon. His Eldorado sat by the curb. As he drove north on Lake Shore Drive, careful to stay below the forty-five-mile-per-hour speed limit, he adjusted the small record player under the dashboard and talked more about how busy he was, how he scarcely found time for religious study. “You see, I’m a minister and I have to know these things because of the questions they ask me,” he said."|Ali|"Jonathan Eig"

Maybe I’ll never look like that again.” He asked the reporters to tell him how he looked. Was he trim? He said he was ready to be tested. He said he was running hard, sacrificing more, that he was sure he would make no mistakes in preparing. “I’m crazy with loneliness, though. Durin’ all the years I was away, I was never lonely. Oh, I had a ball, drivin’ to the colleges and stayin’ at the inns and meetin’ students, the black power groups, the white hippies.” Now he was alone, more or less, up at five, in bed by ten, hungry all the time, refusing the advances of women, and all because he was “thinkin’ of that short walk to the ring, and all those faces there, lookin’ at me and sayin’: ‘Why it’s a miracle!

The house belonged to a well-known street hustler named Gordon “Chicken Man” Williams. The guests were mostly pushers, pimps, and mobsters. Upon arrival, masked men with shotguns met them. The would-be revelers were led to the basement, stripped to their underwear, ordered to place their handguns and valuables in a pile, and spread out on the floor. When space in the basement ran out, the men and women were ordered to lie on top of one another, stacked like cordwood. By three in the morning, there were at least eighty people in the basement, including Cash Clay. Two days later, the Atlanta Journal reported that $200,000 had been stolen, although only five victims filed reports with the police.

At Madison Square Garden, where former champs Jack Dempsey, Jimmy Braddock, and Gene Tunney would be watching, ticket prices topped out at thirty dollars.

To make it work, a transmitter in the Philippines bounced a signal across the Pacific Ocean via satellite to a station in Jamesburg, California. The station in Jamesburg transmitted the signal by AT&T land lines to a telephone switching center in Manhattan, where it was rerouted to the HBO studios on 23rd Street, and then relayed by satellite to Valley Forge, Pennsylvania; beamed to a station in Fort Pierce, Florida; and delivered by microwave link to cable providers.

12:00|noon|"A few days after the fight, Ali flew to Turkey with Wallace Muhammad to meet with Muslim leaders. In an interview at the airport in Istanbul, he said he would probably retire after one more fight with George Foreman. Ali and Wallace, along with Turkey’s deputy premier Necmettin Erbakan, attended a noon prayer service at Istanbul’s celebrated Sultan Ahmet Mosque (also known as the Blue Mosque). When it was over, Ali made a big announcement: “At the urging of my leader, Wallace Muhammad, I declare that I am quitting fighting as of now and from now on I will join the struggle of the Islamic cause.”"|Ali|"Jonathan Eig"
"ap ~ 00:52"|"about eight to one"|"Still, Ali was a huge favorite, with the odds running at about eight to one. Ali was a hero, and his devotees were not ready to let him fade away. His 1977 biopic, along with its popular theme song, “The Greatest Love of All,” introduced a new generation of fans to his story. “It was the late 1970s, an eternity since Martin Luther King Jr. and the civil rights movement had died,” wrote Kevin Powell, who was eleven years old at the time, “and . . . Ali was one of the last shining symbols of a historic era of immense black pride and achievement . . . one of the only black heroes I had.” Spinks, on the other hand, was a raw, unknown talent, a mere boxer. The fight seemed so lopsided that at least one reporter wondered if it would score well enough in the ratings to top ABC’s popular TV show Charlie’s Angels, which would be on the air at the same time."|Ali|"Jonathan Eig"
05:00|"five in the morning"|"In Nassau early one morning, Ali went for a run. It was five in the morning. Roosters crowed. The sun only hinted at its arrival over the Caribbean. Ali ran for about a mile and a half, stopped to walk for a while, and then climbed into a limousine for a ride back to the hotel. His sparring sessions were equally uninspiring, according to reporters on hand. In the days before the fight, Ali refused to step on a scale; he didn’t want anyone to know how much he weighed."|Ali|"Jonathan Eig"
05:00|"five in the morning"|"Ali said he enjoyed retirement more than he had enjoyed life as a boxer. No longer did he have to wake up at five in the morning to exercise. No longer did he have to absorb punches from big, strong men. Now, all he had to do was bask in the love of his fans. Everywhere he went, people chanted his name—“Muhammad Ali Clay,” they called him in the Middle East, to differentiate him from the many Muhammad Alis who lived in Muslim countries. People tossed flowers at his passing car and laced garlands around his neck. Dignitaries presented him with expensive gifts, which Ali would often leave behind for the hotel cleaning crews. Late at night, when he couldn’t sleep, he would knock on the door of one of his traveling companions and spend hours talking about his favorite subjects: religion, power, money, and sex. “If I had one dollar from everybody that loves me,” he sometimes said, “I’d be a billionaire.” He seldom talked about boxing and engaged in surprisingly little bragging. “He was relentlessly sunny,” Kolb said. “He made you feel safe . . . Deep down, he was one of the humblest guys I ever met.”"|Ali|"Jonathan Eig"
15:50|"3:50 p.m."|"One day, Ali was hired to sit at a table and sign autographs to promote a new television enterprise—Classic Sports Network—at a cable TV convention in New Orleans. His pay was five thousand dollars for four hours. Ali did more than sign autographs. He posed for photos and performed magic tricks, and, because he spent so long with each of his fans, the line to meet him stretched far out of sight. At 3:50 p.m., when Ali’s time was almost up, the man who had hired him, Brian Bedol, began apologizing to the people standing in line and telling them that the champ would have to leave in ten minutes. Bedol heard a loud whisper from behind. “Hey boss man, what are you doing?” It was Ali. “These people are here to see me!”"|Ali|"Jonathan Eig"
"> 00:00"|"After midnight"|"Ali stayed two more hours, until everyone had an autograph or a picture. When he was done, he joined Bedol and his team for dinner—and insisted on picking up the two-thousand-dollar tab. When the meal ended, Ali invited Bedol and the others to his hotel suite, where he passed around a Bible and discussed the contradictions contained in the texts. There were thirty thousand contradictions in the Bible, he said, and he went on to offer examples. As the night stretched on, Bedol had the feeling Ali was going to mention every one, but he didn’t. He was trying to make the point that Judaism, Christianity, and Islam sprang from the same set of beliefs. Muslims, Ali explained, believed that Jewish and Christian holy books were divinely revealed, but those books had lost their integrity through countless revisions over the years, and only the Koran offered a perfect and complete account of God’s words as revealed to the prophet Muhammad. After midnight, Ali stopped talking, pushed back his chair, rose, and walked to his bedroom. After ten minutes, when Ali didn’t return, Bedol and his colleagues looked at one another and quietly exited the suite."|Ali|"Jonathan Eig"
"ap ~ 10:15"|"about 10:15"|"At about 10:15 one Saturday morning in the spring of 1994, Muhammad Ali and his brother Rahaman were eating breakfast at their mother’s house in Louisville when the doorbell rang. Odessa Clay, wearing a flowery housedress with lace trim, answered."|Ali|"Jonathan Eig"
02:30|"2:30 in the morning"|"Then, at 2:30 in the morning on July 16, three days before the opening ceremony, Sadlo received a strange phone call. It was Howard Bingham calling from Los Angeles to say that Muhammad and Lonnie wanted to thank Sadlo for what he had done. That was it. Bingham didn’t say what Sadlo had done, only that Lonnie and Muhammad appreciated it."|Ali|"Jonathan Eig"
20:30|"8:30 p.m."|"Less than eight months later, Ali was hospitalized in Phoenix for a respiratory infection. He had been hospitalized before with infections, and he had always bounced back. But this time, after a few days of treatment, his condition worsened. Lonnie phoned the children and told them to come right away. They did. At 8:30 p.m. on June 3, with his family surrounding him in Room 263 of the Scottsdale Osborn Medical Center, Ali was disconnected from the ventilator keeping him alive. He fought to breathe."|Ali|"Jonathan Eig"
21:10|"9:10 p.m."|"At 9:10 p.m., Muhammad Ali, seventy-four years old, was pronounced dead of septic shock."|Ali|"Jonathan Eig"
02:00|"2 in the morning"|"It’s 2 in the morning when Malcolm leaves the hotel and drives to his home in Queens. An FBI agent monitors his every move. Later the same day, Malcolm, his wife, and three daughters board a plane for the family’s first vacation ever. This, too, is part of Malcolm’s plan. He wants the world to see that he’s not a bomb-throwing lunatic but a father, a husband, a minister of God who believes America can and must reform. He plans to take pictures and jot notes for a newspaper feature story he’s calling “Malcolm X, the Family Man.”"|Ali|"Jonathan Eig"
