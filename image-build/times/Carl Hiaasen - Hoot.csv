"ap 01:00"|one|"“No way. The reason I asked, I saw this weird kid today at one of the bus stops. Except he didn’t get on the bus, and he’s not here at school,” Roy said, “so I figured he must not go to Trace.”"|Hoot|"Carl Hiaasen"
12:00|noon|"THREE
Officer Delinko shielded his eyes against the noon glare.
“Took you long enough,” said Curly, the construction foreman."|Hoot|"Carl Hiaasen"
05:00|"five A.M."|"On the first Monday after the alligator episode, Officer Delinko set his alarm clock for five A.M. He rolled out of bed, took a quick shower, toasted himself a bagel, and headed out for the construction site."|Hoot|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 10:04"|Ten-four|"Soon he nodded off, and the next thing he heard was the radio crackle of the dispatcher’s voice, routinely asking for his location. Officer Delinko fumbled for the microphone and recited the address of the construction site.
“Ten-four,” the dispatcher said, signing off.
Officer Delinko gradually roused himself. The squad car was hot but, oddly, it looked darker outside now than when he’d first arrived—so dark, in fact, that he couldn’t see anything, not even the construction trailer."|Hoot|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 09:30"|Nine-thirty|"“What time is it?” he asked Curly.
“Nine-thirty.”
Officer Delinko let out an involuntary whimper. Nine-thirty! He touched his finger to the windshield—the paint was dry."|Hoot|"Carl Hiaasen"

"ap 02:22"|"two hours and twenty-two minutes"|"He didn’t know how far the bears had gone, or whether they might come back to stalk him. For two hours and twenty-two minutes Roy remained as stationary as a plaster statue on that mountainside, until one of his teachers found him and led him safely back to the group."|Hoot|"Carl Hiaasen"
00:00|midnight|"“Don’t worry, we’ll get it covered. We’ll pull somebody off the midnight shift.”"|Hoot|"Carl Hiaasen"
16:30|"four-thirty in the afternoon"|"At four-thirty in the afternoon, when Officer David Delinko normally got off work, his desk was still piled high with paperwork. He had lots of forms to fill out and reports to complete about what had happened to his patrol car. He kept writing until his wrist began to ache, and at six he finally called it quits."|Hoot|"Carl Hiaasen"

"ap 04:30"|"half-past four"|"At half-past four, a red truck with a camper top drove up to the trailer. Curly pulled a yellow poncho over his glistening head and stepped out into the endless drizzle."|Hoot|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap < 05:00"|"nearly five o’clock"|"Fifteen minutes later, Roy found himself on East Oriole Avenue, at the same trailer where the foreman had hollered at him a few days before. It was nearly five o’clock, and the construction site looked deserted."|Hoot|"Carl Hiaasen"
12:00|noon|"After breakfast his father drove him to the bicycle shop to pick up his new tire, and by noon Roy was fully mobile again. An address for “L. B. Leep” was listed in the phone book, and Roy had no difficulty locating the house. It was on West Oriole Avenue, the same street as the bus stop where he’d first spotted the running boy."|Hoot|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap > 03:00"|"After three"|"After three firm knocks, the door swung open and there stood Leon Leep, all six feet nine inches of him. He wore baggy red gym shorts and a sleeveless mesh jersey that exposed a pale kettle-sized belly. Leon looked as if he hadn’t spent five minutes in the exercise room since retiring from pro basketball; all that remained of his NBA physique was his height."|Hoot|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap ~ 05:00"|"Around five o’clock"|"Around five o’clock, he nuked a frozen dinner and popped the movie into the VCR. The turkey potpie wasn’t half bad, and the cherry strudel turned out to be surprisingly tasty. Curly didn’t leave a crumb."|Hoot|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 04:30"|four-thirty|"“I’ll have to talk to my supervisor,” the clerk said, “and she’s already left for the day. The office closes at four-thirty, and it’s already, let’s see, four-twenty-seven.” For emphasis he tapped the face of his wristwatch."|Hoot|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 04:27"|four-twenty-seven|"“I’ll have to talk to my supervisor,” the clerk said, “and she’s already left for the day. The office closes at four-thirty, and it’s already, let’s see, four-twenty-seven.” For emphasis he tapped the face of his wristwatch."|Hoot|"Carl Hiaasen"
"< 00:00"|"nearly midnight"|"It was nearly midnight at the construction site. The two men stood next to the patrolman’s car, chatting casually. Both of them privately believed that the real Mother Paula’s vandal was still on the loose, but they would not share their suspicions with each other."|Hoot|"Carl Hiaasen"
12:00|Noon|"Roy had expected an emotional reaction to the news of the groundbreaking ceremony, but Mullet Fingers remained surprisingly calm, almost as if he’d been expecting it. He carefully tore out the Mother Paula’s advertisement and examined it as if it were a treasure map.
“Noon, huh?” he murmured quietly.
“That’s only twenty-four hours from now,” Roy said. “What are we going to do?”"|Hoot|"Carl Hiaasen"
12:00|noon|"“Oh, it’s definitely a current event,” Roy countered. “It’s happening tomorrow at noon, Mr. Ryan.”"|Hoot|"Carl Hiaasen"
12:00|noon|"Roy’s throat was as dry as prairie dust, and his neck felt hot.
“Anyway,” he muttered, “it’s tomorrow at noon.”
Then he sat down."|Hoot|"Carl Hiaasen"
"> 00:00"|"Shortly after midnight"|"Shortly after midnight, Officer Delinko heard Curly come out and shout his name. The foreman claimed he’d been awakened by a noise like someone climbing the fence."|Hoot|"Carl Hiaasen"
12:00|noon|"“So I guess we’re all set for noon,” Roy said. He lowered his voice. “I went to see your brother. He threw me out of the truck.”"|Hoot|"Carl Hiaasen"
10:45|"ten-forty-five A.M."|"At ten-forty-five A.M., a black stretch limousine pulled up to the empty lot at Woodbury and East Oriole. The driver got out and opened one of the doors. Nothing happened for several moments, and then a tall man with wavy silver hair emerged, squinting into the sun. He wore pressed white trousers and a dark blue blazer with an emblem on the breast pocket."|Hoot|"Carl Hiaasen"
11:50|"ten minutes to noon"|"At ten minutes to noon, Roy and Beatrice arrived; this time she rode the handlebars and he pedaled, the camera stowed safely in his backpack. They were startled to see that they weren’t the only ones to show up—the freckle-faced boy, the red-haired girl, and at least half of Mr. Ryan’s history class were already there, along with a bunch of parents."|Hoot|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 00:15"|"quarter past twelve"|"At quarter past twelve, the door of the construction trailer swung open. First to emerge was a policeman whom Roy recognized as Officer Delinko; then the bald construction foreman with the rotten temper; then a snooty-looking guy with silver hair and dorky sunglasses."|Hoot|"Carl Hiaasen"
12:00|noon|"The TV cameraman announced that the demonstration was being broadcast live on the noon news, while the photographer from the paper swooped in for a close-up of Mr. Muckle, looking drained, defeated, and suddenly very old. He braced himself on the ceremonial shovel as if it were a cane."|Hoot|"Carl Hiaasen"
06:00|"six this morning"|"His mother said, “The phone started ringing at six this morning. Your dad made me take it off the hook.”"|Hoot|"Carl Hiaasen"
