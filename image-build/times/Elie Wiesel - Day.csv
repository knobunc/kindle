Wait for the red light to become green, for the flow of cars to stop, for the policeman who was directing traffic to raise his hand, for the cab driver, unaware of the role he was going to play in a moment, to reach the appointed spot. We had to wait for the director’s cue.
I turned around. The clock in the TWA window said 10:25.

"ap 06:00"|six|"MOISHE is a smuggler. He too comes from Sighet. We were friends. Every morning at six, ever since we were eight years old, we met in the street and, lantern in hand, we walked to the cheder, where we found books bigger than we. Moishe wanted to become a rabbi. Today he is a smuggler and he is wanted by every police force in Europe. In the concentration camp he had seen a pious man exchange his whole week’s bread rations for a prayer book. The pious man passed away less than a month later. Before dying he had kissed his precious book and murmured, “Book, how many human beings have you destroyed?” That day Moishe had decided to change the course of his existence. And that’s how the human race gained a smuggler and lost a rabbi. And it isn’t any the worse off for it."|Day|"Elie Wiesel"
