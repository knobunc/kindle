His wife and Fern were discussing a Thomas Gray poem. He  thought he knew the one they were talking about but as he formed some words to join the conversation, death stepped into the room and came to him: Henry walked up the steps and into the tiniest of houses, knowing with each step that he did not own it, that he was only renting.  He  was  ever  so  disappointed;  he  heard  footsteps  behind  him  and  death  told  him  it  was Caldonia, coming to register her own disappointment. Whoever was renting the house to him had promised a thousand rooms, but as he traveled through the house he found less than four rooms, and all  the  rooms  were  identical  and  his  head  touched  their  ceilings.  “This  will  not  do,”  Henry  kept saying to himself, and he turned to share that thought with his wife, to say, “Wife, wife, look what they done done,” and God told him right then, “Not a wife, Henry, but a widow.” It was several minutes before Caldonia and Fern knew Henry was no more and they went on talking about a widowed white woman with two slaves to her name on a farm in some distant part of Virginia, in a place near Montross where her nearest white neighbors were miles and miles away."|"The Known World"|"Edward P.

They waited on the road that Sunday and about noon Rita, the second mother to Henry, came out with the boy.  His  groom  clothes  belonged  to  Robbins  so  he  came  out  to  his  parents  barefoot  and  in  some secondhand clothes that Robbins had thrown in for free because the Townsends had never been late with a payment. There was nothing to do but for the boy to get into the back of the wagon after he and Rita had hugged good-bye. “I see you later, Rita,” Mildred said. “I see you later,” Rita said. “I see you later, Rita,” Henry said. What would amaze all involved was that Robbins never suspected the Townsends,  and Henry, who became as  close to Robbins as Robbins’s own son  Louis, would never  say  a  word.  Rita  came  out  into  the  road,  which  she  knew  she  was  not  supposed  to  do,  and stood with her arms folded when she was not waving bye-bye to the boy. The moment the wagon took  off,  she  began  to  vomit,  and  all  she  could  think,  between  the  tears,  was  how  much  she  had enjoyed that dinner, now lost to the road. And she vomited again–thinking that this time it was that little  breakfast  of  one  stolen  egg  and  a  slice  of  an  old  pig’s  ear  that  would  have  been  green  in another hour or two if she hadn’t cooked it.

She wiped her tears and then she began to run, and in the moments it took for the sun to go behind another cloud, she had caught up with the wagon and had hold of the back of it. Augustus wasn’t driving the wagon very fast because he had his  family  together  again  and  all  time  was  now  spread  out  before  him  over  the  valley  and  the mountains forever and ever. Henry soon took hold of Rita’s other hand. Augustus and Mildred were facing ahead, toward home. “Daddy,” Henry said quietly as he watched Rita. His legs dangling off the  edge  of  the  wagon,  he  alone  was  facing  back,  toward  the  Robbins  plantation.  “Daddy.” Augustus turned in his seat and saw Rita. “What you doin, woman?”"|"The Known World"|"Edward P.

It was a little after six in the morning. One rooster crowed, then another, and then another. The four people took the box and the sticks out to the wagon. “Fill these here with water,” Augustus said, handing two flasks to Henry before stepping back  to  consider  the  box.  Augustus  put  a  clean  rag  with  a  few  biscuits  next  to  the  right  of  where Rita’s head would go. Augustus moved a stick just a bit and put the filled flasks in the space on the other  side  of  where  her  head  would  be.  He  was  surprised  at  the  ease  of  how  he  worked,  no trembling of the hands, as if he had been born just to put a woman in a box and send her to New York. He believed whistling inside or outside the house was bad luck, but right then as he worked, he was tempted to whistle. Finally, he turned to Rita, held out his hand and helped her up onto the wagon and into the box. Before he nailed her in, Mildred said, “Rita, honey,  I see  you in the bye and bye. Lord willin.” Rita said, “Mildred, baby, I see  you one day in the bye and bye. The Lord wouldn’t hurt us so we couldn’t see each other in the bye and bye.” Rita held on to the stick with Adam and Eve holding up their descendants, and that was the last the three of them ever saw of her."|"The Known World"|"Edward P.

She did not know this history of eons about herself; there was only the feeling in her bones that for some time she had been venturing into a place unknown, and that feeling made her hope for a road that would not cut too deeply into her feet and her soul. To live to see fifty was a wish she was beginning to dare to have. My name is Delphie and I’m fifty years old. Count em. Start at one and count em. One Delphie, two Delphie, three Delphie … Before she had reached forty her only wish was that the world would be kind to her daughter, Cassandra, or Cassie as some people called her. Now a second wish was beginning to creep up on her, and she was afraid that wishing to see fifty might make God turn his back on the first wish about her daughter. God might say: Make up your mind about them wishes, Delphie, I ain’t got all day and you ain’t got but one wish comin to you. Delphie said to Moses, “We gon leave here?

But he himself had believed, had hoped from the moment of the knock at his door at two that morning. “Augustus, I’m sorry, but Mistress say to say to you that Master Henry dead,” Bennett had said, holding his pass in one hand and the lantern in the other so his face might be seen in the darkness. Augustus had believed in Caldonia, had always believed in her, having seen from the beginning a light in her that had failed in his own son born into slavery. But the light was not  in  her  words.

Henry  Townsend  had  not  been  a  master  long  enough  for  his  adult  slaves  to  die  and populate the cemetery. In that slave cemetery there was Peter, the man run over by the horses, and there  was  Sadie,  a  fairly  new  purchase  by  Henry  at  the  time  of  her  death.

How ready he had been, at ease, legs powerful, heart desperate to beat under another moon and sun. He sat down again and put the doll inside his shirt and leaned over to pick up another piece of wood. It was nearing nine-thirty. As he took up the knife, Alice came out of her cabin and danced down the lane and stood before him with her hands on  her  hips.  They  had  rarely  spoken  because  nothing  she  said  ever  made  sense.  “Whatcha  makin now?” she said, surprising him. “Somethin for my boy.” “Well,  you just make it good, make it to last,” Alice said. He waited for her to follow up with some nonsense, but she just stood as she had been.

He ate most of the hoe cakes he brought with him, thinking the problem was a body rebellious due to hunger. He stopped as often as he could to collect himself but each time he started  up  again,  he  was  weaker  than  before.  At  about  seven  miles  he  was  nearly  reduced  to crawling, and at the eighth mile he collapsed. He awoke, stretched out in the road, to hear a slow horse coming his way. Uncertain which way the horse was coming from, he began crawling toward the side of the road where tall grass waited. He parted the grass and made a place for himself and heard the horse come up and stop. It was William Robbins on Sir Guilderham. “Whatever you are, I know you are there,” Robbins said. “Come out if you’re nigger, and if you are white, tell me your name and I’ll leave you to it.”"|"The Known World"|"Edward P.

Sam, the man with one ear, lived on at the Robbins’s plantation. He had a cabin to himself, which Robbins had permitted even after the overseer had said it would spoil him. “Once he learned right from wrong, he gave me good work,” Robbins said to the overseer. Sam was still grabbing and frightening little children. The grown-ups knew it was a habit that they could do nothing about, so they tried to teach the children to avoid him. “Give him not even so much as a good mornin or  a good night. Wave from way over yonder when he speak to you and be on your way.” On  his  way  to  the  Townsend  place  on  Tuesday  morning,  Oden  Peoples  the  Cherokee  met Sheriff John Skiffington and told him he had been hired by Henry after one of his slaves had run away.  Skiffington  had  in  his  saddlebag  a  month-old  letter  from  his  cousin  Counsel  Skiffington  in North  Carolina.  The  letter  swore  by  a  woman  in  Amelia  County  who  had  a  cure  for  stomach ailments, which John Skiffington had suffered from since he was a boy. Counsel had always teased John about his “woman’s stomach” but he had never thought his cousin’s pain was not real. John had set out for an overnight trip to the woman in Amelia, but hearing about Elias running away, he decided to go with Oden Peoples, one of his patrollers. A runaway slave was, in fact, a thief since he  had  stolen  his  master’s  property–himself.  They  arrived  about  9:30.  Moses  and  one  other  man took Elias from the field and Oden sliced off about a third of his ear as everyone, including Henry, stood in the lane. Elias had his head down all the while except when Oden pulled it up to get the razor to do a better job. All of the lobe and then some. Oden always carried a pouch with a pepper poultice, which he blended with vinegar and mustard and a little salt–a proven remedy to halt the bleeding  of  even  those  who  seemed  to  have  more  blood  than  other  men.  “The  bleeders,”  Oden called them. Elias lowered his head again and stood with his hands at his side, refusing to hold the poultice in place.

Any later than that and he will have  failed  the  first  lesson.”  She  did  not  say  that  he  himself  should  tell  Henry  for  she  knew  he would not go and take a message from a woman not his equal to a man who was not his equal."|"The Known World"|"Edward P.

She  was  prepared  to  give  no  answer  if  he  asked  what  she  meant  by  that,  but Anderson said nothing. She listened to the word untainted  echo in her head, thinking that it was the first time she had used it in a long time. “When he could read and write, I opened my library to him, but most of the books did not hold him the way I thought they might have. He was a man, of course, and not a child given to luxuriating. He read, enjoyed, and presented himself for the next one. He would take a book back to his land. Where he got the time to read, I do not know because the word I received  was  that  he  was  working  on  the  house  all  day  long.”  That  August  day  with  Anderson,  a man  and  a  woman,  hand  in  hand,  walked  by  and  she  waved  to  them  and  the  couple  waved  back."|"The Known World"|"Edward P.

I am partial to neither, but I must reveal them to my students  nevertheless.”  She  turned  to  Anderson  and  tipped  her  head  back  somewhat  so  that  her whole face was visible. She continued, “I could not break him of his diction. Sometimes he spoke the way I wanted him to speak, but there were so many times when he spoke the way a man had to speak who had been twenty years in the field. His own father spoke that way as well.” The day Robbins saw him wrestling with Moses, Henry Townsend reached his parents a little after seven that evening. Mildred and Augustus were awake and he was glad. He had stayed away and not told them about the purchase of Moses or that he had started building a house. Part of him just  wanted  to  surprise  them  about  the  new  house.  Part  of  him  had  been  afraid  to  tell  them  about Moses.  But  Henry  was  weary  in  the  mind  after  what  Robbins  had  said  to  him  and  thought  that sharing the story of his house and Moses would be a good way to pass the evening before sleep. He found them at the kitchen table and Mildred stood and covered his face with kisses. Augustus was playing with one of the dogs, tugging gently at its ears. “Leave off now,” he told the dog as he rose and the dog sidled away. Augustus and Henry kissed on the mouth, a habit born in those days when Henry  and  Robbins  traveled  about,  a  way  of  pulling  Henry  back  into  the  family.  The  day  of  the wrestling the family had not been together in nearly two months."|"The Known World"|"Edward P. Jones"

Robert  had  a  collection  of  antique  European  pistols  that  he loved  to  show  anyone  he  felt  was  capable  of  enjoying  them  without  letting  envy  intrude.  His problem was that most men envied, so he could not show the pistols the way he wanted. Robbins, a good friend to Colfax, did not envy and they often enjoyed them together, sometimes well into the night.  Skiffington  also  did  not  envy.  Colfax’s  sons  thought  the  pistols  no  more  than  toys.  So  he loved when Skiffington visited because they could, together, with such care, take down the pistols one  by  one  from  the  cabinet  Augustus  Townsend  had  made  and  admire  what  some  German  or Italian had crafted a long time ago as if his life had depended upon it."|"The Known World"|"Edward P.
