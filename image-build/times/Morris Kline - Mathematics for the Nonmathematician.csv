In prehistoric times, which means roughly before 4000 B.C., several civilizations at least learned to think about numbers as abstract concepts. That is, they recognized that three sheep and three arrows have something in common, a quantity called three, which can be thought about independently of any physical objects. Each of us in his own schooling goes through this same process of divorcing numbers from physical objects. The appreciation of “number” as an abstract idea is a great, and perhaps the first, step in the founding of mathematics."|"Mathematics for the Nonmathematician"|"Morris Kline"

12:00|noon|"We have described what is meant by the latitude and longitude of any point on the earth’s surface, but how do we determine the latitude and longitude for any given point P? (After all, we cannot penetrate to the center of the earth to measure the angles POV and VOW.) There are numerous methods available. We shall describe a simple one just to see that the latitude and longitude of places on the earth can be determined. Suppose we seek the latitude of some point P (Fig. 7–15). On the day of the spring equinox, that is about March 21, the sun is in the plane of the equator and, at noon on that day, it is also in the plane of the meridian of longitude. For a person at P, the overhead direction is PA, and the direction to the sun is PZ′. Now the sun is so far away that PZ′ and VZ can be taken to be parallel lines. Then angle 2 equals the angle of latitude POV because they are alternate interior angles of parallel lines. But angle 1 equals angle 2 because they are verticle angles. Hence angle 1 equals the latitude of P. But angle 1 can be measured. It is the angle between the direction of the sun and the overhead direction at P. Thus the latitude of P can be determined."|"Mathematics for the Nonmathematician"|"Morris Kline"

Thus the position of P1 would be determined by two numbers, the length OQ1 and the length Q1P1. The length OQ1 which is 3 in Fig. 12–1, is called the abscissa of P1, and the length P1Q1, which is 5 in Fig. 12–1, is called the ordinate. The line OX is called the X-axis, and the line OY, which is perpendicular to OX and which shows the direction in which Q1P1 is taken, is called the Y-axis."|"Mathematics for the Nonmathematician"|"Morris Kline"
20:00|"0 to 20"|"There are two mathematical and physical facts involved in this event which require some elaboration. First of all there is the matter of time. As the person travels, time elapses. Mathematically this time is represented by a variable, t, say, and the values of t increase continually as the trip goes on. If time is measured from the instant at which the man starts out and if he has been traveling for 20 minutes, say, then t varies from 0 to 20. We also speak of the 20 minutes as an interval of time or an amount of time. We have, of course, referred to and used this mathematical representation of time right along. It is important now, however, to recognize that the collision of automobile and tree does not last an interval of time but occurs in what is called an instant. Many other events take place at an instant or are instantaneous. A lightning flash is instantaneous or at least happens so fast that we describe it as happening at an instant. The clock strikes at an instant. A bullet strikes a target at an instant."|"Mathematics for the Nonmathematician"|"Morris Kline"

These numbers seem to be approaching, or getting closer to, the fixed number 128. Hence we take 128 to be the speed of the falling body at t = 4. This number is called the limit of the set of average speeds. We should note that the instantaneous speed is not defined as the quotient of distance and time. Rather it is the limit approached by average speeds as the intervals over which these average speeds are computed approach zero."|"Mathematics for the Nonmathematician"|"Morris Kline"
