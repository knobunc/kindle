That done, he would smugly add the job to his Crimes Solved graph and get back to arse-creeping the Brigadier—yet another triumph for law and order reduced to a colonic toehold.

And another thing—those six cars outside Dr Matthews’s place in Arcadia Avenue.

The Group Areas Act had placed it within Trekkersburg’s sole non-white zone which meant it did the job of ten streets elsewhere in the town. So there were always plenty of people about from sunrise until curfew shortly before midnight, and plenty of them with nothing to do either except stand around. It was easy to remain unnoticed. You could submerge yourself in a jostling crowd around the game played with Coke bottle tops. Or you could sit on the kerb and shuffle your feet in the gutter with the others who never earned a glance from passers-by. You just took off your tie, turned your jacket inside out to show the satin lining like a farm boy, and went to work. It was a cinch, especially after twilight."|"The Steam Pig"|"James McClure"

And they overlooked the fact that most of them had attempted to join the CID, only to fail on probation. Sergeant Grobbelaar was a case in point.
