23:00|"eleven p.m."|"There was garbage in the streets.
The alarm sounded at eleven p.m.
He reached out for it, groping in the darkness, finding the lever and pressing it against the back of the clock. The buzzing stopped. The room was very silent. Beside him, he could hear May’s even breathing. The windows were wide open, but the room was hot and damp, and he thought again about the air conditioning unit he’d wanted to buy since the Summer began. Reluctantly, he sat up and rubbed hamlike fists into his eyes."|"Cop Hater"|"Ed McBain"
"ap 11:10"|eleven-ten|"He had timed every step of the operation, and so he knew just how long it took to shave, just how long it took to dress, just how long it took to gulp a quick cup of coffee. He took oft his wrist watch before he began shaving, leaving it on the washbasin where he could glance at it occasionally. At eleven-ten, he began dressing. He put on an Aloha shirt his brother had sent him from Hawaii. He put on a pair of tan gabardine slacks, and a light poplin windbreaker. He put a handkerchief in his left hip pocket, and then scooped his wallet and change off the dresser."|"Cop Hater"|"Ed McBain"
"ap 11:30"|eleven-thirty|"“Uhm,” she said, and then she rolled over into the pillow. He sneaked a last look at her from the doorway, and then went through the living room and out of the house. He glanced at his watch. It was eleven-thirty. Right on schedule, and damn if it wasn’t a lot cooler in the street."|"Cop Hater"|"Ed McBain"
"ap 11:41"|"eleven forty-one"|"At eleven forty-one, when Mike Reardon was three blocks away from his place of business, two bullets entered the back of his skull and ripped away half his face when they left his body. He felt only impact and sudden unbearable pain, and then vaguely heard the shots, and then everything inside him went dark, and he crumpled to the pavement."|"Cop Hater"|"Ed McBain"
"ap 11:56"|"eleven fifty-six"|"Another citizen found him at eleven fifty-six, and went to call the police. There was very little difference between the citizen who rushed down the street to a phone booth, and the citizen named Mike Reardon who lay crumpled and lifeless against the concrete."|"Cop Hater"|"Ed McBain"
"ap 00:19"|12:19|"“Just don’t mess it up for the Lab boys. I’m taking off.” The assistant m.e. glanced at his watch. “For the benefit of the timekeeper, it’s 12:19.”"|"Cop Hater"|"Ed McBain"
01:00|"one a.m."|"At one a.m., on the morning of July 24th, while a colleague named Mike Reardon lay spilling his blood into the gutter, David Foster was earning his salary by interrogating the man he and Bush had picked up in the bar knifing."|"Cop Hater"|"Ed McBain"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"“I want to call my wife,” he said.
“At two in the morning?” Carella asked incredulously.
“What’s the matter with that?” Bush wanted to know. He was suddenly antagonistic."|"Cop Hater"|"Ed McBain"
03:00|"3:00 A.M."|"It was there on the morning of July 24th at 3:00 A.M. It was there in full force because the heat of the day had baked it into the walls. It hit Carella as he and Bush entered the building. He snorted through his nostrils and then struck a match and held it to the mailboxes."|"Cop Hater"|"Ed McBain"
16:00|"4:00 P.M."|"THE PISTOL PERMIT was on Steve Carella’s desk when he reported for work at 4:00 P.M. on the afternoon of July 24th.

“At three in the morning,” the uniformed cop added.
“Okay,” Carella said. “Thanks.”"|"Cop Hater"|"Ed McBain"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"“We decided it ain’t wise to sit in parked cars at three in the morning. There’s always some cop who’s got to fill his pinch book.”"|"Cop Hater"|"Ed McBain"
00:00|midnight|"Thinking of her, thinking of the progression of slow traffic lights which kept him from racing to her side, he cursed Ballistics Reports and Coroner’s Reports, and people who shot cops in the back of the head, and he cursed the devilish instrument known as the telephone and the fact that the instrument was worthless with a girl like Teddy. He glanced at his watch. It was close to midnight, and she didn’t know he was coming, but he’d take the chance, anyway. He wanted to see her."|"Cop Hater"|"Ed McBain"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"“Well, you know, we discussed it. Mike preferred staying up, but I have two children, and I’m beat when it hits ten o’clock. So he usually compromised on those nights, and we both got to bed early—at about nine, I suppose.”"|"Cop Hater"|"Ed McBain"

15:42|"3:42 P.M."|"At 3:42 P.M. on July 25th, the Ballistics report reached Carella’s desk. The shells and bullets found at the scene of Mike Reardon’s death had been put beneath the comparison microscope together with the shells and bullets used in the killing of David Foster."|"Cop Hater"|"Ed McBain"
12:00|"twelve noon"|"THE HEAT on that July 26th reached a high of 95.6 at twelve noon. At the precinct house, two fans circulated the soggy air that crawled past the open windows and the grilles behind them. Everything in the Detective Squad Room seemed to wilt under the steady, malignant pressure of the heat. Only the file cabinets and the desks stood at strict attention. Reports, file cards, carbon paper, envelopes, memos, all of these were damp and sticky to the touch, clinging to wherever they were dropped, clinging with a moist limpidity."|"Cop Hater"|"Ed McBain"
00:00|midnight|"“What time?”
“Close to midnight.”
“I don’t remember.”"|"Cop Hater"|"Ed McBain"
04:00|"four a.m."|"Carella checked with the men Ordiz had named. Each of them was willing to swear that he’d been at the poker game from ten-thirty on the night of July 23rd, to four a.m. on the morning of July 24th. Ordiz’ landlady reluctantly admitted she had spent the night of the 24th and the morning of the 25th in Ordiz’ room. Ordiz had solid alibis for the times someone had spent killing Reardon and Foster."|"Cop Hater"|"Ed McBain"
"ap 08:45"|8:45|"Since Bush lived in another suburb—Calm’s Point, west and a little south of Riverhead—they chose to meet at Headquarters at 8:45, fifteen minutes before the lineup began. Carella was there on the dot."|"Cop Hater"|"Ed McBain"
"ap 08:50"|8:50|"At 8:50, Bush strolled up. That is to say, he more or less crawled onto the pavement and slouched over to where Carella was standing and puffing on a cigarette."|"Cop Hater"|"Ed McBain"
03:00|"three a.m."|"“Diamondback, Two,” the Chief of Detectives said. “Pritchett, Virginia, 34. Struck her quote husband unquote about the neck and head with a hatchet at three a.m. in the morning. No statement.”"|"Cop Hater"|"Ed McBain"
22:24|"10:24 P.M."|"“Majesta, One,” the Chief of Detectives said. “Bronckin, David, 27. Had a lamp outage report at 10:24 P.M. last night, corner of Weaver and 69th North. Electric company notified at once, and then another lamp outage two blocks south reported, and then gunfire reported. Patrolman picked up Bronckin on Dicksen and 69th North. Bronckin was intoxicated, was going down the street shooting out lamppost fixtures. What about it, Dave?”"|"Cop Hater"|"Ed McBain"

00:00|midnight|"But Hank and he had talked a lot in the quiet hours of the midnight tour, and Hank had many times described Alice in the black nightgowns she wore to bed. And try as he might, Carella could not disassociate the separate concepts of black: black as a sheer and frothy raiment of seduction; black as the ashy garment of mourning."|"Cop Hater"|"Ed McBain"
