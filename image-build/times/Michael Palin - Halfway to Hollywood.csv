He stands like a great bird, eyes flicking around, his lean frame held back almost apologetically. He welcomes me into his office with some kind words about what he’s seen, then a group of about eight or nine Columbia hacks are brought in. All seem very quiet and respectable and deferential. Young – mostly my age or less. Ken Blancato, the creative publicity head, is neat and trim and looks like a hairdresser. They don’t immediately strike me as an intimidatingly forceful team. Very well-behaved in the presence of their president, behind whose desk is a shelf full of maybe 40 screenplays.

The year of Living Dangerously continues: after ‘Troubles’, it’s clear that ‘AF’ will not go. Talked to Anne Bancroft, who sounds nicer and more sympathetic each time we speak. She says she doesn’t think I’ve yet made my mind up what it’s about. The latest draft showed I could write – the writing even better than the second draft. But it’s like a fine suit of clothes, without ‘the nakedness’, as she describes it, beneath. She says she’s a perfectionist, but it’s that sort of criticism which is worthwhile."|"Halfway to Hollywood"|"Michael Palin"
