"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"“What time should I be ready?” I asked.
Matsu laughed. “We’ll leave before noon.”

"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"“I’ll see you at ten o’clock,” I said, but I wasn’t sure if she had heard me as she hurried down the road."|"The Samurai's Garden"|"Gail Tsukiyama"
"> 12:00"|"after noon"|"I rose early and dressed warm, thinking we would get an early start, but we didn’t leave till late, and it was after noon by the time we reached Tarumi. Many of the villagers were also making their way up the mountain to the shrine. I could see that through the torii gates and near the shrine, a crowd had already gathered. I looked around at what were now familiar faces, looking for Keiko and her family. Matsu also seem to be looking around for someone, whom I could only guess to be Kenzo. I’d hoped the silence between them would disappear with the New Year, but it remained. They had not spoken since the incident at the house, and though Matsu was quiet about what he felt, I could often feel his sadness."|"The Samurai's Garden"|"Gail Tsukiyama"
12:00|noon|"“She didn’t used to be an early riser,” Matsu said. Then suddenly embarrassed by how he might know, added, “When they were girls, she and Tomoko would have slept until noon, if they had been allowed.”"|"The Samurai's Garden"|"Gail Tsukiyama"
"ap ~ 03:00"|"around three o’clock"|"“I see.” Keiko stood silent for a moment, then looked up at me and asked, “Can you meet me tomorrow afternoon around three o’clock at the Tama Shrine?”"|"The Samurai's Garden"|"Gail Tsukiyama"
12:00|midday|"THE COURTYARD WAS STILL QUIET SO EARLY IN THE morning, the neighborhood just waking as Neighbor Lau’s rooster began to crow. The air was already warm, a taste of the heat and humidity that would be unbearable by midday. Seven-year-old Tao knew he had little time to climb the kapok tree before he’d be discovered. He glanced down at the gnarled roots of the tree and felt strangely comforted, a reminder of the crooked ginger roots his ma ma sliced and boiled into strong teas for her headaches, or when his ba ba complained of indigestion."|"The Samurai's Garden"|"Gail Tsukiyama"
12:00|noon|"The light in the waiting room shifted as the sky darkened by noon, bathing the room in shadows. Kai Ying wondered if it had begun to rain outside. It had now been over three hours since they’d brought Tao to the hospital and he was rushed to an examining room. Where was he now? Was he going to be all right? The abrupt nurse at the desk wouldn’t tell her anything and simply said, “Go sit, the doctor will find you when he’s ready,” and waved her away."|"The Samurai's Garden"|"Gail Tsukiyama"
