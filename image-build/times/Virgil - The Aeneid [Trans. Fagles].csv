00:00|midnight|"Jove had spoken. Mercury made ready at once 
to obey the great commands of his almighty father. 
First he fastens under his feet the golden sandals, 
winged to sweep him over the waves and earth alike 
with the rush of gusting winds. Then he seizes the wand 
that calls the pallid spirits up from the Underworld 
and ushers others down to the grim dark depths, 
the wand that lends us sleep or sends it away, 
that unseals our eyes in death. Equipped with this, 
he spurs the winds and swims through billowing clouds 
till in mid-flight he spies the summit and rugged flanks 
of Atlas, whose long-enduring peak supports the skies. 
Atlas: his pine-covered crown is forever girded 
round with black clouds, battered by wind and rain; 
driving blizzards cloak his shoulders with snow, 
torrents course down from the old Titan’s chin 
and shaggy beard that bristles stiff with ice. 
Here the god of Cyllene landed first, 
banking down to a stop on balanced wings. 
From there, headlong down with his full weight 
he plunged to the sea as a seahawk skims the waves, 
rounding the beaches, rounding cliffs to hunt for fish inshore. 
So Mercury of Cyllene flew between the earth and sky 
to gain the sandy coast of Libya, cutting the winds 
that sweep down from his mother’s father, Atlas. 
Soon 
as his winged feet touched down on the first huts in sight, 
he spots Aeneas founding the city fortifications, 
building homes in Carthage. And his sword-hilt 
is studded with tawny jasper stars, a cloak 
of glowing Tyrian purple drapes his shoulders, 
a gift that the wealthy queen had made herself, 
weaving into the weft a glinting mesh of gold. 
Mercury lashes out at once: “You, so now you lay 
foundation stones for the soaring walls of Carthage! 
Building her gorgeous city, doting on your wife. 
Blind to your own realm, oblivious to your fate! 
The King of the Gods, whose power sways earth and sky—
he is the one who sends me down from brilliant Olympus, 
bearing commands for you through the racing winds. 
What are you plotting now? 
Wasting time in Libya—what hope misleads you so? 
If such a glorious destiny cannot fire your spirit, 
[if you will not shoulder the task for your own fame,] 
at least remember Ascanius rising into his prime, 
the hopes you lodge in Iulus, your only heir—
you owe him Italy’s realm, the land of Rome!” 
This order still on his lips, the god vanished 
from sight into empty air. 
Then Aeneas 
was truly overwhelmed by the vision, stunned, 
his hackles bristle with fear, his voice chokes in his throat. 
He yearns to be gone, to desert this land he loves, 
thunderstruck by the warnings, Jupiter’s command . . . 
But what can he do? What can he dare say now 
to the queen in all her fury and win her over? 
Where to begin, what opening? Thoughts racing, 
here, there, probing his options, turning 
to this plan, that plan—torn in two until, 
at his wits’ end, this answer seems the best. 
He summons Mnestheus, Sergestus, staunch Serestus, 
gives them orders: “Fit out the fleet, but not a word. 
Muster the crews on shore, all tackle set to sail, 
but the cause for our new course, you keep it secret.” 
Yet he himself, since Dido who means the world to him 
knows nothing, never dreaming such a powerful love 
could be uprooted—he will try to approach her, 
find the moment to break the news gently, 
a way to soften the blow that he must leave. 
All shipmates snap to commands, 
glad to do his orders. 
True, but the queen—
who can delude a lover?—soon caught wind 
of a plot afoot, the first to sense the Trojans 
are on the move . . . She fears everything now, 
even with all secure. Rumor, vicious as ever, 
brings her word, already distraught, that Trojans 
are rigging out their galleys, gearing to set sail. 
She rages in helpless frenzy, blazing through 
the entire city, raving like some Maenad 
driven wild when the women shake the sacred emblems, 
when the cyclic orgy, shouts of “Bacchus!” fire her on 
and Cithaeron echoes round with maddened midnight cries."|"The Aeneid [Trans. Fagles]"|Virgil
00:00|midnight|"So, driven by madness, beaten down by anguish, 
Dido was fixed on dying, working out in her mind 
the means, the moment. She approaches her grieving 
sister, Anna—masking her plan with a brave face 
aglow with hope, and says: “I’ve found a way, 
dear heart—rejoice with your sister—either 
to bring him back in love for me or free me 
of love for him. Close to the bounds of Ocean, 
west with the setting sun, lies Ethiopian land, 
the end of the earth, where colossal Atlas turns 
on his shoulder the heavens studded with flaming stars. 
From there, I have heard, a Massylian priestess comes 
who tended the temple held by Hesperian daughters. 
She’d safeguard the boughs in the sacred grove 
and ply the dragon with morsels dripping loops 
of oozing honey and poppies drowsy with slumber. 
With her spells she vows to release the hearts 
of those she likes, to inflict raw pain on others—
to stop the rivers in midstream, reverse the stars 
in their courses, raise the souls of the dead at night 
and make earth shudder and rumble underfoot—you’ll see—
and send the ash trees marching down the mountains. 
I swear by the gods, dear Anna, by your sweet life, 
I arm myself with magic arts against my will. 
“Now go, 
build me a pyre in secret, deep inside our courtyard 
under the open sky. Pile it high with his arms—
he left them hanging within our bridal chamber—
the traitor, so devoted then! and all his clothes 
and crowning it all, the bridal bed that brought my doom. 
I must obliterate every trace of the man, the curse, 
and the priestess shows the way!” 
She says no more 
and now as the queen falls silent, pallor sweeps her face. 
Still, Anna cannot imagine these outlandish rites 
would mask her sister’s death. She can’t conceive 
of such a fiery passion. She fears nothing graver 
than Dido’s grief at the death of her Sychaeus. 
So she does as she is told. 
But now the queen, 
as soon as the pyre was built beneath the open sky, 
towering up with pitch-pine and cut logs of oak—
deep in the heart of her house—she drapes the court 
with flowers, crowning the place with wreaths of death, 
and to top it off she lays his arms and the sword he left 
and an effigy of Aeneas, all on the bed they’d shared, 
for well she knows the future. Altars ring the pyre. 
Hair loose in the wind, the priestess thunders out 
the names of her three hundred gods, Erebus, Chaos 
and triple Hecate, Diana the three-faced virgin. 
She’d sprinkled water, simulating the springs of hell, 
and gathered potent herbs, reaped with bronze sickles 
under the moonlight, dripping their milky black poison, 
and fetched a love-charm ripped from a foal’s brow, 
just born, before the mother could gnaw it off. 
And Dido herself, standing before the altar, 
holding the sacred grain in reverent hands—
with one foot free of its sandal, robes unbound—
sworn now to die, she calls on the gods to witness, 
calls on the stars who know her approaching fate. 
And then to any Power above, mindful, evenhanded, 
who watches over lovers bound by unequal passion, 
Dido says her prayers. 
The dead of night, 
and weary living creatures throughout the world 
are enjoying peaceful sleep. The woods and savage seas 
are calm, at rest, and the circling stars are gliding on 
in their midnight courses, all the fields lie hushed 
and the flocks and gay and gorgeous birds that haunt 
the deep clear pools and the thorny country thickets 
all lie quiet now, under the silent night, asleep. 
But not the tragic queen . . . 
torn in spirit, Dido will not dissolve 
into sleep—her eyes, her mind won’t yield tonight. 
Her torments multiply, over and over her passion 
surges back into heaving waves of rage—
she keeps on brooding, obsessions roil her heart: 
“And now, what shall I do? Make a mockery of myself, 
go back to my old suitors, tempt them to try again? 
Beg the Numidians, grovel, plead for a husband—
though time and again I scorned to wed their like? 
What then? Trail the Trojan ships, bend to the Trojans’ 
every last demand? So pleased, are they, with all the help, 
the relief I lent them once? And memory of my service past 
stands firm in grateful minds! And even if I were willing, 
would the Trojans allow me to board their proud ships—
a woman they hate? Poor lost fool, can’t you sense it, 
grasp it yet—the treachery of Laomedon’s breed? 
What now? Do I take flight alone, consorting 
with crews of Trojan oarsmen in their triumph? 
Or follow them out with all my troops of Tyrians 
thronging the decks? Yes, hard as it was to uproot 
them once from Tyre! How can I force them back to sea 
once more, command them to spread their sails to the winds? 
No, no, die! 
You deserve it—
end your pain with the sword! 
You, my sister, you were the first, won over by my tears, 
to pile these sorrows on my shoulders, mad as I was, 
to throw me into my enemy’s arms. If only I’d been free 
to live my life, untested in marriage, free of guilt 
as some wild beast untouched by pangs like these! 
I broke the faith I swore to the ashes of Sychaeus.”"|"The Aeneid [Trans. Fagles]"|Virgil
12:00|"high noon"|"Trading words, as Dawn in her rose-red chariot 
crossed in mid-career, high noon in the arching sky, 
and they might have spent what time they had with tales 
if the Sibyl next to Aeneas had not warned him tersely: 
“Night comes on, Aeneas. We waste our time with tears. 
This is the place where the road divides in two. 
To the right it runs below the mighty walls of Death, 
our path to Elysium, but the left-hand road torments 
the wicked, leading down to Tartarus, path to doom.”"|"The Aeneid [Trans. Fagles]"|Virgil
"ap 01:00"|one|"Yet it is the hero himself who plays, at times inverting, at times asserting, the most consequential range of Homeric roles throughout the poem, until in his climactic action—killing Turnus—Aeneas resembles, at one and the same moment, an Achilles avenging the death of a cherished comrade, a Hector defending his homeland successfully, and an Odysseus winning his rightful bride by killing her suitor, reclaiming his kingdom, and laying the groundwork for its future. And Aeneas’ range of Homeric roles within the Aeneid reflects his possible roles in later history as well. For he prefigures, in his tenuous way, Romulus the founder and Augustus the first emperor of Rome, and as some may see the ancient hero, a modern hero in the making."|"The Aeneid [Trans.
