"ap 04:35"|"four hours and thirty-five minutes"|"""Mabel""—Mr. Platter glanced at the clock on the wall—""we've been looking for four hours and thirty-five minutes. And not a sign of them. If they're still in this house, they'd be inside the walls, under the floor ... anywhere! Remember that bit of loose floorboard I hitched up?"""|"The Borrowers Avenged"|"Mary Norton"

now ... well, that wouldn't be very nice, not murder, dear. Might involve the police—"" As he did not reply at once, she added lamely, ""If you see what I mean..."""|"The Borrowers Avenged"|"Mary Norton"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"No, this was it! They had arrived: she heard the church clock, much nearer now, striking the hour of nine. She could see her father and Spiller splashing about in the shallows 
among the pebbles, and between them was Spiller's soapbox lid, bobbing emptily as Pod made it fast to a root."|"The Borrowers Avenged"|"Mary Norton"
"< 00:00"|"just before midnight"|"""Enough,"" said Pod, reaching up as she leaned forward, and catching her under the arms. ""We got in here just before midnight—didn't you hear the clock? That's the way ... let yourself go. That's right!"""|"The Borrowers Avenged"|"Mary Norton"
"ap 04:00"|four|"Arrietty helped her father replace the bits of tiling (Spiller, in his sudden way, had silently disappeared). After this, there seemed nothing more to do, so, feeling tired, she decided to join her mother in their comfortable, makeshift bed. Before she fell asleep, she heard the church clock strike four. Only four o'clock in the afternoon! But all the same, it had seemed a long, long day."|"The Borrowers Avenged"|"Mary Norton"

"ap 02:00"|two|"A sudden whirring from the church tower announced that the clock was about to strike. She turned quickly, swaying slightly on her slender branch. The clock struck two. Two o'clock! It couldn't be! Where had the morning gone? Her parents must be out of their minds with worry. And Spiller must have arrived by now to bring them their luncheon. And, what was worse, she had forgotten to tell her parents that Peagreen might appear."|"The Borrowers Avenged"|"Mary Norton"

"ap 00:00"|twelve|"When the church clock struck twelve, Arrietty pulled up three tiny radishes and a lettuce seedling, and they began to make their way towards Peagreen's home. They had to hide once when they saw Whitlace trundling a wheelbarrow filled 
with rhododendrons along the path: he was heading for the church. Arrietty felt a sad little pang because she realized that her beloved Miss Menzies might be at the church by now but that she, Arrietty, would not be there—even to watch her from a distance."|"The Borrowers Avenged"|"Mary Norton"
"ap 05:00"|five|"When at last Timmus rejoined them, the clock was striking five. He looked very hot and dirty. Arrietty thought she had better take him home. ""But the church is full of ladies,"" protested Peagreen."|"The Borrowers Avenged"|"Mary Norton"
"ap ~ 06:00"|"about six o'clock"|"""I've no idea. Until they've finished the flowers, I suppose. I thought that, at about six o'clock, I'd climb that high box tree. You can see everything from there. All the comings and goings..."""|"The Borrowers Avenged"|"Mary Norton"

"ap 11:30"|Eleven-thirty|"""Eleven-thirty,"" agreed Mr. Platter. He did look very tired. He glanced down at his tools and around at the table. ""I think I'll leave this stuff here for tonight. No point in taking tools and bringing 'em down again: I've got to put these locks right, anyway."""|"The Borrowers Avenged"|"Mary Norton"
"ap 02:00"|two|"Much later that night, when Arrietty had climbed in through the partly opened grating and tumbled into their arms, Pod and Homily forgot the anxious hours of waiting and the dark unspoken dreads. There were tears, but they were tears of joy. The church clock had struck two without being heeded before she had answered all their questions."|"The Borrowers Avenged"|"Mary Norton"
