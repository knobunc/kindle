"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"The Shell had its own messenger service. Every morning, every lunchtime, and at six o’clock each evening, Jacob the Postperson called to see if Milena had any messages."|"The Child Garden"|"Geoff Ryman"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"His mind had been opened up. He remembered everything, was unable to forget anything. He went from door to door passing messages, reminding people that someone wanted his razor back or that the bus was leaving at three o’clock. He was a way of saving paper. It seemed that he could only talk in an unvarying string of formulae."|"The Child Garden"|"Geoff Ryman"
"ap 01:00"|"One o’clock"|"‘She asks if you would like to have lunch with her this afternoon. One o’clock by the front steps of the National. Should I tell her that is all right?’"|"The Child Garden"|"Geoff Ryman"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"But that would be beneath her high standards.
‘Tell Ms Patel,’ said Milena, ‘that one o’clock will be fine.’
Milena found herself considering what to wear. It was summer and the sky was bright. She would need to shelter from the sun if her complexion was to be preserved. She had two pairs of trousers, one white, one black. She decided to wear the white, with a long-sleeved, high-neck blouse. She also took her gloves and parasol."|"The Child Garden"|"Geoff Ryman"
18:00|"six this evening"|"Milena was still panting, a queasy trail of sweat on her forehead. ‘Fine. Great. Can you come somewhere with me at six this evening?’"|"The Child Garden"|"Geoff Ryman"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"At one o’clock the next afternoon, she went to the steps and Rolfa was not there."|"The Child Garden"|"Geoff Ryman"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"At six o’clock, she and Jacob went to the Graveyard and there was only silence. They waited hidden like mice for the singing to begin. The darkness deepened. Finally they edged their way towards the desk, and peeked out between the costumes."|"The Child Garden"|"Geoff Ryman"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"‘It’s an invitation,’ said Milena. ‘For dinner at eight o’clock tomorrow evening.’ She passed him the card. ‘With Rolfa’s family.’"|"The Child Garden"|"Geoff Ryman"
"ap 10:30"|10.30|"Across the river, on the face of the Shell-Mex, the hands of a giant clock were still. They had been still since the Blackout, the Revolution, ninety-seven years before. Tonight the hands would move, tonight at 10.30. There was enough metal now. The electricity would flow again, at first along the North Bank of the Thames only. But after that?"|"The Child Garden"|"Geoff Ryman"

12:00|midday|"It is rising up over mountains like some new flowering sun. In other places below, at midday, it is misty, high up in blue sky, pale like a daylight moon, pink-white, its shadows the same blue as the sky around it. It will be a pink glow behind monsoons in the south, where I can see them sweeping in arcs over the coastline. And in the east, it will be setting like the sun, streaks of cloud across its face, which it will pinken. In some places, the sun will shine through it, as if the sun wore a collar. Or a crown. Half the world will look up and see it and wonder at the way it shines, and it is shining out of my head, out of memory."|"The Child Garden"|"Geoff Ryman"
12:00|noon|"The sky above was still fierce and blue and flawless, and from all around the horizon, there came a murmuring of song. The streets and yards were empty; it was high, hot noon and everyone was sleeping in the shade. It had been a beautiful summer. No rain for weeks. Already the air was beginning to smell of the urine of animals."|"The Child Garden"|"Geoff Ryman"
12:00|noon|"‘And the hologramming,’ said Cilla. ‘Tell me about that. It was noon here. Low dark clouds. And then it started to rain flowers! And there was that beautiful music! All around us in the air.’"|"The Child Garden"|"Geoff Ryman"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"Milena remembered approaching a pond, and the ground ahead seethed. Hundreds of frogs lolloped into the brackish water. Overhead, marauding herons circled. It was seven o’clock and already the heat was like a hammer. Already Milena was drenched in sweat, her lips were cracked and her throat dry. Children sat, disconsolate on the banks, feeding on sunlight, no longer bothering to chase the herons away."|"The Child Garden"|"Geoff Ryman"
12:00|noon|"Beatrice and Dante walked across Westminster Bridge Road and into the Cut: the Cut that no longer existed, the Cut in the Summer of Song. There were all the old familiar faces; the boy with the Hogarth face; the slim clothseller and his pretty wife; the seller of mirror lenses. They were a chorus. For the first time, the narrative was sung. They sung about the sun at the meridian, noon on the heights of Purgatory."|"The Child Garden"|"Geoff Ryman"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"She saw the children. They had been given viruses to educate them. From three weeks old they could speak and do basic arithmetic. By ten, they had been made adults, forced like flowers to bloom early. But they were not flowers of love. They were flowers of work, to be put to work. There was not time."|"The Child Garden"|"Geoff Ryman"
