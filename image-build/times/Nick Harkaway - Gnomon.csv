00:00|midnight|"In a private villa at Elounda, as part of this healing process, I commission a foam party. My shark picture is projected on to the walls and I arrange for a special Kyriakos cocktail with blue Curaçao and shark fin ice cubes. There is a six-foot ice-luge in the shape of a nude male diver, suitably heroic but still recognisably me, reaching down like God in Michelangelo’s painting to bless the shark. Branded vodka is poured into the back of the statue’s scuba tank and flows freely from his partly engorged penis. I also fly in a group of adventurous art students from Camberwell and pay them to paint the same tableau across the naked abdomens of five Crazy Horse girls. At midnight, two artists and a dancer persuade me to take off my clothes – thank God I’ve been on a fitness jag so my body is muscular beneath a layer of fat, and I can tell myself I look titanic rather than obese – and they shave me from neck to ankle right there on the leather sofa and wash me in Cristal. At which point the whole night really kicks off, and it’s a carnage of oral sex and orifices and everyone has a great time. I personally get laid on top of the ice luge, roaring and thrusting as my balls brush the melting ice and my arsehole gets very cold, but my partner is totally into it. She’s screaming and yessing as if she’s never had an orgasm before, and that makes me feel pretty fantastic."|Gnomon|"Nick Harkaway"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"I am invincible, in the bank as in the sack. The shark swims in the markets, in the exchanges, in my balls. There are no castles I cannot storm. Day upon day upon night upon night, I invest Megalos’s money – and that of a growing number of other clients – and I am unstoppable. The Patriarch, for his part, is evidently something of a mover and a shaker, albeit only in a moral sense. I find him on the front page of my newspaper brokering a labour agreement, then on the eleven o’clock news talking about the duty to the motherland. His profile is enhanced by a rumour that he’s made some very smart investment calls recently, with a new – unnamed – advisor."|Gnomon|"Nick Harkaway"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"Tubman blows an actual raspberry. ‘For God’s sake, Mielikki,’ he says, ‘don’t be daft. Glad to help. But,’ he adds, as she prepares another round of apology, ‘don’t waste any more breath being charming about it. I hate charm.’ And so she has to promise to come directly, which is what they both knew would happen. A moment later, her terminal opens a sidebar and she can watch his schedule emptying for the rest of the morning. Each cancellation makes a noise like a very polite burp. In place of the various colour codes – delivery, maintenance, weekly management session, even his much-needed eleven o’clock break – the Witness loads a silver bar tagged with her own name. Tubman glances off to one side, no doubt seeing the same thing, and winces."|Gnomon|"Nick Harkaway"
00:00|midnight|"The Chamber, as described, is perfectly circular in plan, and domed. It is written that the supplicant enters from below to see the smiling face of the goddess drawn upon the ceiling in a tracery of silver against a midnight mosaic of lapis lazuli. Into this dome are set diamonds in the pattern of the constellations. Around the walls are the images of the four cardinal souls: two men, a woman and a fourth which might be either, and they are scattered across history. Along with the Goddess, they are the bridge between the divine world and the temporal one, and all of them, even her, are concealed in the shadow of the Pentemychos, itself concealed, so that this is the most invisible of pantheons. The divine Mother touches the other four with spirit, and they in turn give her: matter to be shaped as earth; the flow of time without which there is no life; harmony, lest the making unravel itself; and death, so that no one thing shall overrun the others. Here, in this place, angels can be birthed, demons shattered, and miracles made like loaves of bread for market. With the right knowledge, an alchemist working within the Chamber might produce an elixir to offset age and return youth to one who drinks it; transform sickness into abundance; heal any injury and even raise the dead; but the greatest gift of the Chamber is the eternal Alkahest, the Universal Solvent that will free any prisoner and dissolve not only all solid matter but also oaths, curses, kingdoms, years and centuries, even damnation itself. In a very real sense, the Alkahest is the power of God. Armed with it, one might undo the first sin and make the world a new heaven, pull down the sky, or seal the abyss forever and preserve What Is from What Is To Come. The Alkahest is the ink in which Isis writes the book of destiny. It is the tears that fell from the Virgin’s eyes on the day of the Crucifixion."|Gnomon|"Nick Harkaway"
"ap 03:00"|three|"The nurse pronounces her well enough to be badly behaved and notes that this is a good sign. He reiterates the general infuriating injunction to take it easy and departs. She waits until the Witness informs her he has left the building, then wraps both arms around the bucket and shakes it, watching the ping pong ball as it clatters and jumps. It isn’t as satisfying as the long drop of her tennis ball or the tactile thud as it lands in her palm, but it won’t roll away if she drops it and force her to get up when she doesn’t want to. Nor does it suggest the flexible physical laws of dream. She puts the bucket aside and flicks on the pen torch. On, off. Once, twice, three, four, five times, because her instinct is to stop at three, and dreams use precisely the recollection of habit to construct a facade of the real."|Gnomon|"Nick Harkaway"
"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"‘We turn broadly unconnected data into narratives, narratives into data we can understand and work with. We investigate, and strive to influence, the sense of the world people invest in every morning when they choose their route to work, so that they actually get there sometime before noon. We have to know what they’re thinking and then give them the information they haven’t yet realised they want, so that they know which method will serve them best. Quite often, of course, they take one route over and over again, out of habit. Not much to be done there. But there are what you might call floating voters, people who are actively looking for the most efficient journey, or the most relaxed. I always envy those ones: soft seat commuters. It strikes me as a very good way to live. They’re generally employed by newer firms with flexible hours, they take their work home with them, show a high index of satisfaction. They live longer, too, and there’s no measurable difference in income distribution across the group … Well. One day, perhaps, I shall retire to one of those companies. But that’s what we do. We help people in their chosen direction. We remind them to ask themselves where they want to go and how they want to get there, and then we help them do it the right way. But the important thing is the how: by creating and understanding narratives and what they are inside the brain and where they touch the real world.’"|Gnomon|"Nick Harkaway"
00:00|midnight|"OUTSIDE THE HOUSE, something flashes firework bright. My ears hurt, in the burning way they did long ago when I was twenty and contracted an infection from a midnight swim. The window ripples and bows inward like a soap bubble. I watch it stretch: a long, endless second as it bulges towards some plastic limit. Then it screams. I have never heard glass scream before. I discover in this moment that the sound is beautiful even as it is appallingly painful. Screaming glass is transcendent, the lamentation of lovers frozen in different fragments and now tumbling apart. The shriek barges so deeply into my ears that I can feel it in my stomach, and then I stop hearing at all and the window goes white as one layer of the laminate is pulverised, absorbing the force of the explosion as it should – as it is designed to do. Laying itself down."|Gnomon|"Nick Harkaway"

Because obviously I can get sheepshit during the day, I mean, who fucking can’t? But what if I’d had a sheepshit emergency and, just because no one mentioned to me about the wanker shop, I couldn’t drown this person at all and I had to wait until the next day and, you know, the urge had passed off? Because that would have been a tragedy. Do you have to be on the wanker email list, or is it one of those paper mailshots that comes through the door every so often? You know: carpenter can make you shelves, handsy guitar teacher ten quid an hour, and by the way here’s where you can get fucking pig’s blood to throw in someone’s fucking face at fucking midnight. Because if there’s a wanker shop I’m going in there right now and I’m buying all their stock and I am going to the police station and I am going to drown that little fuck right fucking now!’"|Gnomon|"Nick Harkaway"

"~ 10:00"|"gone ten in the morning"|"Neith opens her eyes again, briefly disorientated. She’s at Hunter’s house, but this is her bedroom. She remembers closing her eyes in Lönnrot’s chair. Did she fall asleep on the spot? No. No, of course. She worked through, searched the room and found nothing, just more of Hunter’s clothes in the cupboards. After that, she joined Donovan looking at books until gone ten in the morning. Vaguely, she recalls the brown fog around the edges of her vision, and telling Baskin to get her a car. She must have been half-asleep climbing her own stairs. She’s still dressed."|Gnomon|"Nick Harkaway"

No bloated sense of importance like yours truly, didn’t bother to remember the technical stuff. Carrington was strictly diggers and clippers. Dog-end in the mouth, always. We used to drink together, and that was not a good thing the following day. It was always the full monty: drink, smoke, dance on the table, girls in feathers. Get thrown out at five a.m. and plenty of donnybrook with the bouncers. He loved affray.’"|Gnomon|"Nick Harkaway"

Neith, recalling her recent moment of midnight fear and the image of Lönnrot’s hand reaching out to her from the mirror, feels a spasm of sympathy. Smith, too, seems to be having that unpleasant mammalian response to silence and occlusion: the itchy and unwelcome sense of an invisible watcher."|Gnomon|"Nick Harkaway"

She takes a night tram, sitting behind the curl of the rear stairs on the upper deck, looking backwards along the track, feeling everything wrong slip away into the red glow of the rear lights. For the first time in her own memory of herself, she is singing, something wordless and complex that cycles endlessly around itself. Perhaps it is an instinctive camouflage, or a warning to anyone boarding the tram that she’s not looking to share the view. It is almost 4 a.m., and she is going to visit a friend."|Gnomon|"Nick Harkaway"

It was no better than six in the morning and I had slept hardly at all in the last day. The lulling scent of eucalyptus, the perfume of the place still definitive though mixed now with the fumes of automobiles and aircraft rather than the scent of grazing goats in the streets, was calling me to my bed. Well, that would have to wait, because the Emperor simply did not. I took as much time as I dared to make myself presentable, which was not much, and the footman drove me to the palace."|Gnomon|"Nick Harkaway"

17:00|"five in the afternoon"|"That night I dreamed of Alem Bekagn for the first time in a long, long while. It was narrow and terribly hot, and filled with the sound of others screaming and weeping. However I answered his questions, the lean fellow with that relentless obsequiousness of manner, he still had his men break one finger bone each day in a vise. They came for me with great punctuality at five in the afternoon, so that the pain kept me awake all night and it grew harder and harder to feed myself or drink. My tongue swelled and my breath stank. Much of this is true, but in this version, in the end, I did not escape my cell. Instead I died in a corner between sunrise and sunset, choking on the awful lizard dryness that had at last become so large that I could not breathe. They put out my corpse, but no one came to take it away. Michael was never born and nor was Annie. My whole world never was, and that was the worst of it, that my extinction at that wrong moment kills not only my future but my hope."|Gnomon|"Nick Harkaway"
