"> 21:00"|"after nine P.M."|"“Tetchy?” said Vimes. “A tetchy god? What, he complains about the noise their kids make? Objects to loud music after nine P.M.?”"|"Monstrous Regiment"|"Terry Pratchett"
12:00|midday|"They saw no one else on the road until midday, when the party was marching through a landscape of low hills; the sun had boiled away some of the clouds and, for a moment at least, summer was back—moist and sticky and mildly unpleasant, like a party guest who won’t go home."|"Monstrous Regiment"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"“Are there any more questions?” said Blouse, looking along the line. “Jolly good, then. We leave by the last boat, at midnight. Carry on, Sergeant…for now. What was the other thing…oh, yes. And I shall need a batman.”"|"Monstrous Regiment"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 06:00"|six|"“Capital. Report to my quarters in the inn at six, Private Perks. Carry on, Sergeant.”"|"Monstrous Regiment"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"“I’m sure there’s something you wouldn’t!” said Polly, and turned and ran. As she made it out into the cold night air, a plaintive voice behind her called out, “I’m off at eight o’clock!”"|"Monstrous Regiment"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"“I see,” he said. “Well, you heard the lieutenant. The boat leaves at midnight. We should be well down the Kneck by Wednesday’s dawn. Get a few hours sleep if you can. Tomorrow’s going to be a long day, if you’re lucky.”"|"Monstrous Regiment"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap ~ 11:00"|"gone eleven"|"Polly could tell time by the fire. You got a feel for how long a fire burned, and the logs on this one were gray with ash over the glow beneath. It was gone eleven, she decided."|"Monstrous Regiment"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|Midnight|"“Ah, Perks, thank you,” said the lieutenant, sitting up. “Midnight, is it?”"|"Monstrous Regiment"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 08:20"|"eight…twenty"|"“Haha, nice one, sir!” said Jackrum. “No, sir. What he does, sir, is assess situations, sir. I don’t understand it myself, sir, not being a big thinker, but the proof of the pudding, sir, is in the eating of same, and last night we were jumped by eight…twenty Zlobenian troopers, sir, and the lieutenant just assessed the situation in a flash and skewered five of the buggers, sir. Like a kebab, sir. Mild as milk to look at, but rouse him and he’s a whirlwind of death. Of course, you did not hear it from me, sir.”"|"Monstrous Regiment"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"“Oh well, he tried,” said Jackrum. “With any luck he’s in a nice warm cell and they’ve found him a pair of long pants. Get your kit together, lads. We’ll creep around and into our lines and you’ll be snug in bed by midnight.”"|"Monstrous Regiment"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 05:00"|"Five o’clock"|"“Five o’clock, then,” said the soldier and ambled off down the corridor."|"Monstrous Regiment"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 05:30"|"half past five"|"“My ‘nom de guerre,’” said Blouse. “I still haven’t found a way out of the lower areas but the guards all have keys and I shall have his key in my hand by half past five! Pardon?”"|"Monstrous Regiment"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"The room chosen for the tribunal was a ballroom. More than half the Keep had been taken back, Polly learned, but the distribution of ground was erratic. The alliance still held the central buildings, and the armory, but was entirely surrounded by Borogravian forces. The current prize to fight for was the main gate complex, which hadn’t been built to withstand attack from inside. What was happening out there now was a brawl, a midnight bar fight but on a huge scale. And, since there were various war engines atop the towers now occupied by either side, the Keep was shooting at itself, in the finest traditions of the circular firing squad."|"Monstrous Regiment"|"Terry Pratchett"
