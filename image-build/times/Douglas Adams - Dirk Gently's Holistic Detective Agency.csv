"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"It was seven o’clock. Many of the figures were heading for the college dining hall which divided First Court from Second Court, and from which warm light, reluctantly, streamed. Two figures in particular seemed ill-matched. One, a young man, was tall, thin and angular; even muffled inside a heavy dark coat he walked a little like an affronted heron."|"Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency"|"Douglas Adams"
"ap 08:47"|8.47|"“Oh, Susan, hi, it’s Gordon,” he said, cradling the phone awkwardly on his shoulder. “Just on my way to the cottage. It’s er, Thursday night, and it’s, er… 8.47. Bit misty on the roads. Listen, I have those people from the States coming over this weekend to thrash out the distribution on Anthem Version 2.00, handling the promotion, all that stuff, and look you know I don’t like to ask you this sort of thing, but you know I always do anyway, so here it is."|"Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency"|"Douglas Adams"
04:00|"four o’clock in the morning"|"He continued to lie there, like someone lying awake at four o’clock in the morning, unable to put their mind to rest, but unable to find anything to do with it. He realised that he had just had something of a shock, which might account for his inability to think clearly, but didn’t account for his ability actually to think at all."|"Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency"|"Douglas Adams"
"ap 11:45"|"Eleven forty-five"|"He wiped his forehead with the arm of his oldest and greasiest sweater. There had been a nasty moment when his life had flashed before his eyes but he had been too preoccupied with falling and had missed all the good bits. Most of the good bits had involved Susan, he realised. Susan or computers. Never Susan and computers—those had largely been the bad bits. Which was why he was here, he told himself. He seemed to need convincing, and told himself again.
He looked at his watch. Eleven forty-five.
It occurred to him he had better go and wash his wet and dirty hands before he touched anything. It wasn’t the police he was worried about, but Susan’s terrifying cleaner. She would know."|"Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency"|"Douglas Adams"
04:00|"four o’clock in the morning"|"The horror of hollowness lay on him, the horror of lying ceaselessly and forever awake at four o’clock in the morning."|"Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency"|"Douglas Adams"
"ap 08:30"|eight-thirty|"“Sunday night, then, Mrs Bluthall, Sunday night at eight-thirty. You know the address. Yes, I’m sure Miss Tiddles will appear, as I’m sure will your cheque book. Till then, Mrs Bluthall, till then.”"|"Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency"|"Douglas Adams"
"ap > 01:00"|"just after one o’clock"|"The wooden toggle on the end of the blind cord knocked a few times against the window, but otherwise all was now silent. The metronome was still. He glanced at his watch. It was just after one o’clock."|"Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency"|"Douglas Adams"
01:00|"one o’clock in the morning"|"“I should think it bloody did. It would have interested you strangely if you’d had to get the bloody thing down a bloody winding staircase at one o’clock in the morning as well. What the hell are you doing here?” said Sergeant Gilks, wearily."|"Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency"|"Douglas Adams"
"ap 08:47"|8:47|"“It’s, er, Thursday night, and it’s, er… 8:47. Bit misty on the roads. Listen, I have those people from the States coming over this weekend…”"|"Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency"|"Douglas Adams"
"ap 08:47"|8.47|"“Stop the tape,” said Gilks sharply and glanced at his watch. “Three minutes and twenty-five seconds since he said it was 8.47.” He glanced up at Dirk again. “Stay here. Don’t move. Don’t touch anything. I’ve made a note of the position of every particle of air in this room, so I shall know if you’ve been breathing.”"|"Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency"|"Douglas Adams"
20:46|"8.46 pm"|"“Irritatingly, this seems to put your client completely in the clear,” said the sergeant. “Cellnet have confirmed that the last call made from the car was at 8.46 pm last night, at which point your client was lightly dozing in front of several hundred witnesses. I say witnesses, in fact they were mostly students, but we will probably be forced to assume that they can’t all be lying.”"|"Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency"|"Douglas Adams"
