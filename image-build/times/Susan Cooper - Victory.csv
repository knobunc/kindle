That was when Mr. Carroll and Tommy began to light the fire and heat water for the men’s breakfast. After that the whole day was full of messy, reeking work, through dinner at noon, supper at four o’clock and bedtime at eight. As boys we were classified as “idlers”—a poor joke, considering how hard we worked. Idlers are the lowest form of life in the Royal Navy: the people who do all the jobs that have nothing to do with sailing the ship. And as third-class boys—there were three classes—we were the lowest of the low."|Victory|"Susan Cooper"

"ap 06:30"|six-thirty|"Sunshine is spilling around the edges of the blinds into the cheery yellow-white bedroom. It’s early morning: six-thirty, her alarm clock tells her. She lies there on her back for a little while, looking at the picture on the wall at the foot of her bed: a framed photograph of her mother and father on a beach somewhere. They are laughing, and in her father’s arms is a chubby smiling baby. The baby is Molly, though it looks rather like Donald."|Victory|"Susan Cooper"

Nobody wakes her up. They slip off her shoes and pull a quilt over her, and leave her there, sleeping in England."|Victory|"Susan Cooper"
12:00|midday|"So now, at midday dinnertime and at supper, I would run down from the galley to the lower gundeck, where there was a roar of voices as the wooden mess tables were unhooked to swing down from the ceiling between the great cannons. The grog issue came right after dinner and supper, so these were the most cheerful times of the day. The men sat at benches on either side of the table; I sat on a barrel, at the end. They took turns weekly to be mess cook, the one responsible for bringing the food from the galley, and I used to go with each one of them; I was still a cook’s boy, after all, and that was useful even if Mr. Carroll was in a bad mood. I helped to clean up too; the mess tables had to be spotless for inspection."|Victory|"Susan Cooper"

It has a voice, a metallic but soothing female voice which speaks from the ceiling and tells them that this is the 9:08 train for Portsmouth Harbour, and adds a list of the stations at which it will stop on the way. Molly feels a twitch of excitement as they begin to move. She is sitting next to the window. Grandad is beside her, reading The Times."|Victory|"Susan Cooper"
