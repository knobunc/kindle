"ap 03:00"|three|"So I did. And nobody believes this part, but it’s true. A few days later, I was up at three on a Wednesday morning sitting in the depressing camper with the naked light bulb burning through the dark around me, and I saw an ad for the job of my dreams. It read: “Tour the world. Fly around in style. Be an international flight attendant. Applications accepted on Monday and Tuesday only. No one considered after that day.”"|"Flying by the Seat of My Pants"|"Marsha Marks"
"ap ~ 09:00"|"about nine"|"There were still several hours until the place opened for business and I could call them, so I decided to drink a little tea and then take a nap. I adjusted my light bulb and used a candle to boil a cup of water to make tea, which I drank with a lot of sugar. I went back to sleep until about nine, when it would be safe to call about the job."|"Flying by the Seat of My Pants"|"Marsha Marks"
09:00|"9:00 a.m."|"At exactly 9:00 a.m., I let myself into the house, avoiding the cat sitting on the stove, the three-legged dog on the couch looking out the window at the hamster, and the meat-eating fish. I got the phone, which had a very long cord, and pulled it out to the camper. I needed privacy as I dialed (literally) for dollars."|"Flying by the Seat of My Pants"|"Marsha Marks"

19:00|"seven in the evening"|"I would leave at seven in the evening and get home at eight in the morning, and then I would try to get some sleep before working the next night. However, I never did get sleep because we had a neighbor named Greeta who was ninety years old and suffering from dementia."|"Flying by the Seat of My Pants"|"Marsha Marks"

13:00|"one in the afternoon"|"In those days we didn’t have cell phones, so I lived with a beeper. Later, as I got more seniority, I moved to Call-in Reserve, which meant I could make a call in the morning and another one in the afternoon to see if Scheduling had a trip planned for me. Finally, I got to the place where I could Hold-a-Line. Holding-a-Line meant that I knew a full two weeks before any given month which days I would be flying and what trips I would be flying. But every year for the first twenty years of my flight career, I dreamed of becoming a Spud."|"Flying by the Seat of My Pants"|"Marsha Marks"
"ap 03:00"|three|"The term Spud was first brought to my attention by a flight attendant who walked up and warned me to stay out of the flight attendant lounge between the hours of three and four each afternoon."|"Flying by the Seat of My Pants"|"Marsha Marks"

23:30|"11:30 p.m."|"Our pilots were late arriving in Atlanta, delaying our takeoff a bit. Then, just as the pilots announced we were ready for pushback, a flash of lightning lit the sky near our aircraft. All takeoff times were delayed, and an hour later, the airport was shut down. Here I was—barely conscious—on the airplane with all the passengers, sitting at the gate for two hours. Finally at 11:30 p.m., we took off. I have very little memory of that flight. My coworker said she couldn’t believe how awake I seemed. And that I appeared to function normally."|"Flying by the Seat of My Pants"|"Marsha Marks"
"ap 03:18"|"three hours and eighteen minutes"|"I looked in the extra luggage closet. It was three feet deep and nineteen inches wide, and I thought, I can fit in here.

"~ 04:45"|"around 4:45 a.m."|"By around 4:45 a.m. on the way back to Atlanta, the entire plane was sleeping, except for the flight attendants, who were mostly going about their duties quietly. Except for the young one, Suzy New Hire. She was spinning out of control with excitement about the job and her life and her new boyfriend and her old boyfriend and where she was going on vacation and what she was going to fix for dinner when she got back home. Just listening to the speed with which words tumbled out of her mouth made me tired."|"Flying by the Seat of My Pants"|"Marsha Marks"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"I realized that Suzy New Hire had been getting progressively more talkative after midnight. As I looked at her in my exhausted state, she reminded me of a helicopter with the blades spinning at full speed."|"Flying by the Seat of My Pants"|"Marsha Marks"
