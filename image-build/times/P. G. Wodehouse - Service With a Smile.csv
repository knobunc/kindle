no sudden outbreak of foppishness that had wrought this change in the ninth
earl’s outer crust, turning him into a prismatic sight at which pigmen blinked
amazed. As he had explained to Myra Schoonmaker on encountering her mooning
about in the hall, he was wearing the beastly things because he was going to
London on the 10.35 train, because his sister Connie had ordered him to attend
the opening of Parliament. Though why Parliament could not get itself opened
without his assistance he was at a loss to understand."|"Service With a Smile"|"P. G. Wodehouse"

shortly after the start of any journey he always fell into a restful sleep. The

of Paddington station, as promised by the railway authorities, whose word is
their bond, at 11.45, and at 12.10 he was lying back in his seat with his eyes
closed, making little whistling noises punctuated at intervals by an occasional
snort. Lord Ickenham, accordingly, was able to talk to the junior member of the

sleeper who seldom failed to enjoy his eight hours. And if he had not woken and
been unable to doze off again, he would not have lain in bed musing on the
Church Lads. And if he had not mused on the Church Lads, he would not have

instructed Beach to take the law into his hands, we shall probably never know,

world, it is inevitable that Beach, unable to bear the shame of exposure, will
hand in his portfolio and resign office, and you will lose the finest butler in
Shropshire. And there is another thing. Emsworth will unquestionably confess
that he inflamed the man and so was directly responsible for what happened, and
one can see the County looking very askance at him, pursing their lips, raising
their eyebrows, possibly even cutting him at the next Agricultural Show.
Really, Lady Constance, if I were you, I think I would reconsider this idea of
yours of giving Bill Bailey the old heave-ho. I will leave the castle on the
2.15, if you wish, though sorry to go, for I like the society here, but Bailey,
I’m afraid, must stay. Possibly in the course of time his winning personality
will overcome your present prejudice against him. I’ll leave you to think it
