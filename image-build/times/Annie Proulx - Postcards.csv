He probably wouldn’t be able to start it again at midnight when the Comet dosed, but he didn’t care now and a kind of impatient joy sent him skidding around the gravelly curves, running the intersection stop sign. He didn’t see any lights coming. He rushed toward the Comet’s warmth."|Postcards|"Annie Proulx"

Cucumber turned his head toward the light and Loyal saw the blood tracking from black nostrils, the wet shirt shining with blood, the water around Cucumber’s knees washed with blood. Cucumber opened his mouth and his pale tongue crept from between his bloody teeth."|Postcards|"Annie Proulx"

He rummaged then, not in Mr. Plute’s office which was locked with two keys, but in Mrs. Cutter’s desk, taking the file cabinet keys and two of her Smith Brothers’ cough drops to suck on while he read the letters and studied the office accounts ledger, then into Perce’s cubicle to go through the folder of outstanding claims and put red mental asterisks in the corners of two cases. The Hakey business where old man Hakey told his daughter’s boyfriend to take a powder and then, lo and behold, at midnight Hakey’s Farm Feeds & Seeds burst into flame. The volunteer fire department couldn’t get the fire truck started. That one stank of arson. And what about this. Cattle auctioneer, Ruben Quilliam. House burned. Nothing really obvious, but Quilliam’s wife had just divorced him, and maybe he’d been drunk and set the house on fire to show her. He’d look around, talk to Quilliam’s neighbors. Perce was too soft; he had these claims ticketed for payment."|Postcards|"Annie Proulx"

"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"At nine o’clock on Saturday morning Mernelle was drying the cereal bowls and thinking what to say to Jewell. The sink gave off its odor. She might say ‘I am getting away from the sink.’ Or, ‘What am I supposed to do, rot here in this place?’ Her clothes were ready. The blue skirt, a deep violet blue that had hardly faded from hanging on the line, and the white blouse with the buttons shaped like tiny pearl hearts. She had a lemon put aside; when she washed her hair, lemon juice in the rinse water would give it a red tone. ‘“Little spitfire,”’ she whispered to herself, thinking of some movie. She could say ‘You and Da lived like pigs. I want a nice place like Mrs. Weedmeyer’s that fixed up the Batchelder dump. A shower with a glass door. Carpets. Silverware with roses on the handles and matching plates with blue rims and a golden stripe.’"|Postcards|"Annie Proulx"

It was higher, he knew it. He loaded the station wagon before Matitia was awake and was at his office at eight. The last patient came at noon and then he was on his way. But once at the camp he felt uncertain. It was as if the road between his two lives was the realest thing of all, as if the journey counted more than arriving at the end."|Postcards|"Annie Proulx"

Once, after he’d been out all day and the next night, Loyal found him by the sound of a shot from Bullet’s scarred old 30.06. He answered the shot and hiked until he met him toiling up a dry wash with flapping shoe soles, cradling a broken wrist in an improvised sling."|Postcards|"Annie Proulx"
12:00|noon|"The beans came along well the second year. Before he harvested them Loyal wanted to fence off the yard and set out a triple row of Scotch pines for a new windbreak. The old poplars were shredded and broken with age. Jase came skulking in unbidden one noon to help him build fence. Loyal was startled to see him, thought the poor bugger must have pulled himself together at last after months of therapy at the VA hospital. They worked in silence through the day, the scrape and chunk of the posthole auger, Little Girl’s gallop stirring up beetles. Loyal looked over at Jase again and again. He knew how to set posts. There was a fluidity in the shift of muscle that drew his eyes. He must have come out enough to work for old Shears lately; face and torso were a sore red. The silvery hair was knotted up in a club under the ranch hat. In the late blaze of afternoon Loyal called it quits."|Postcards|"Annie Proulx"

He could barely hear the wind, but he could feel it in the tremor of the bed. The window was covered with something, something like a choke of willow in spring runoff. He went to it and stared, drawn face reflecting in the glass, recognized tumbleweed, tumbleweed massed up against the second-story window."|Postcards|"Annie Proulx"
12:00|noon|"She was in Littleton at noon, tired and thirsty. She spent fifteen minutes looking for a luncheonette. She had the beginning of a headache. It was a longer trip than it looked on the map. The heavy sky loured. A glass of ginger ale would do good. Maybe a chicken sandwich while she studied her map. It was still a treat to go into a place and order what she liked, then pay for it with her own money."|Postcards|"Annie Proulx"

At one and six-tenths miles a ragged gravel road cut southeast. She turned onto it. Not a breath of wind. The dark sky, the chewed spruce of the idiot strip and behind it rough hills choked with brambles and popple trash depressed her. She was tired. Cold seeped into the Beetle. Probably be close to four and starting to get dark when she reached the top of Mount Washington. What time did they close the shop where you got the bumper stickers? But she was so close it would be a shame not to try. An adventure, going up Mount Washington in the near dark. And coming down again. Don’t let it rain, she thought, glad she had the new brakes."|Postcards|"Annie Proulx"

"ap 08:30"|eight-thirty|"Ray switched on the television set. The blue rectangle swelled out at them and the crooked figures shimmied through desperate snowfall. The images held their attention like flames in a fireplace. At eight-thirty Mernelle went into the kitchen to make Ovaltine and cut the pie, still as warm as sleeping flesh. She arranged the dessert plates, white with blue rims and gold leaves, on the tray, poured the pink-tinged Ovaltine into the cups that matched the plates. Against the sound of the storm she made a chinking of china, played the silver sound of spoons. In the living room Ray set up the little table, spread the yellow cloth on it. She set the tray down gently. They watched the flickering story, their forks muffled in crust and cream. The sight of his empty knees rent her. If there’d been kids they would be putting them to bed about now. Ray would tell the bedtime story. ‘Once upon a time there was a little girl who lived on a farm at the top of a tall, tall hill. Her name was Ivy Sunbeam MacWay, better known as Sunny to all and sundry. Even on Sunday.’"|Postcards|"Annie Proulx"
"~ 16:00"|"Around four in the afternoon"|"Saturday night in Bite the Dust was Saturday night. Around four in the afternoon the parking lot started filling with mufflerless pickups. Dogs in the passenger seats, in the bed. When the aqua pickup, painted with leftover swimming pool paint, pulled in, every dog in the parking lot began to bark and strain forward. He’d seen it working up and down the mountain road on Cloves’s ranch."|Postcards|"Annie Proulx"

On the other side of the pool the garden yawned with caves of shadow, early heat ricocheted off leaves, ferns arched, petals unfurled. Pala might sleep until ten. He never shook the early rising habit. He got up and walked toward the garden, carrying the white cup in his artificial hand with its perfect plastic nails."|Postcards|"Annie Proulx"

Those two rancid objects used to sit with you were still so drunk they weren’t hung over yet. They thought we wanted to go out for more bear.

I know we got a problem, because I can see Jack’s profile bob every few seconds.’ She was imitating now, showing how Jack had sat in the truck, jerked by his body’s mad will. ‘He still had the hiccoughs. He come in carrying some prescription that was supposed to quiet them down, some kind of sleeping pill, I think. Loyal he took those things, and can you believe he had the hiccoughs all night long, even while he was half knocked out from the pills. I had to get up and go deep on the couch in the living room the bed would shake so hard each time he’d spasm, but then I got real worried about him, whether he would swallow his tongue or what because he was dozing real heavy, so I’m up all night drinking coffee, pacing the floor and hearing that damn “hic, hic, hic!”’ As if she had only noticed the weeds around the porch she began to pull at them, let them drop where they fell."|Postcards|"Annie Proulx"

He told her about Cucumber drowning in a mine, midnight driving with Bullet over dangerous passes when the headlights failed, the mountain lion. He, who had talked little, talked much, swelled to a glowing huckster selling stories of his life. At two in the morning, Starr nodding off, wanting nothing but sleep and silence, he stopped. They were tired of each other, each longed for the relief of solitude. He said he would sleep on the daybed beside the stove. The kitchen sunk of cigarettes."|Postcards|"Annie Proulx"

The clock by the bed. Tick. Tick. The energy-conserving automatic switch at 5:00 P.M. The flies knocking against the ceiling. The birds that smashed into their own reflections in the windows. The wind. No, the wind was an outside noise. Mice in the walls. Sounded like a western town, Mice-in-the-Walls, Montana. O.k., that was it for the inside."|Postcards|"Annie Proulx"
