"ap 02:35"|"two hours and thirty-five minutes"|"It had taken two hours and thirty-five minutes to play those nine holes—a death trek for a golfer debilitated by social reticence and acute swing-thought anxieties. Yet somehow I’d endured—hitting from the tips, no less—without the aid of sedatives or booze. No tirades, seizures, casualties or collateral damage."|"The Downhill Lie"|"Carl Hiaasen"
14:00|"2  p.m."|"Woods and Davis Love III teed off at 2  p.m. sharp, with Feherty and me in brisk pursuit. The Firestone South course is famously long and lushly maintained, and the stroll would have been lovely if it weren’t for the gummy, sweltering weather. Feherty sullenly reported that he was in gastric distress; still, he traveled the fairway like it was carpeted with hot coals, and keeping up was a challenge. Behind Tiger and Phil Mickelson, he is arguably the third-biggest celebrity at PGA tournaments. Fans hollered his name constantly, and tugged at him for autographs."|"The Downhill Lie"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 06:58"|"two of seven"|"This morning I hit only two of seven fairways, but I return home to cheerier headlines: Ohio congressman Bob Ney, that thieving suckfish, is pleading guilty to corruption charges in hopes that a judge will show mercy."|"The Downhill Lie"|"Carl Hiaasen"
04:00|"4 a.m."|"A wake-up call at 4 a.m. from my throbbing hip. Once the sun is up, I ride out to Quail Valley with Bill Becker."|"The Downhill Lie"|"Carl Hiaasen"
17:44|"sixteen of eighteen"|"By the time I departed Tiburon, the state of my demoralization was complete and seemingly irreversible. I’d missed sixteen of eighteen greens, posting only two pars on the way to another rancid 100. The most exhilarating moment came when I almost flipped the cart while speeding along a board-walk toward the 17th tee."|"The Downhill Lie"|"Carl Hiaasen"
03:30|"3:30 a.m."|"A low-pressure system rumbled through overnight—I put the exact time as 3:30 a.m., because that’s when my knee and hip began to play dueling bongos. My grandmother wasn’t making up stories when she said she could track barometer fluctations by the pain in her arthritic joints."|"The Downhill Lie"|"Carl Hiaasen"
13:48|"twelve of fourteen"|"Another dubious achievement: I hit twelve of fourteen fairways, yet post just one measly par. This requires creative ineptitude with the irons."|"The Downhill Lie"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 05:59"|"one of six"|"On No. 16, the elevated two-hundred-yard par-3, I banged a 5-iron about twenty-five feet past the cup, then three-putted for another wasted opportunity. Leibo did the same—one of six exasperating three-putts for him. Usually a wizard with the blade, he seemed vexed by Quail Valley’s slick greens. “It’s like putting on the top of my head,” he muttered, tapping his shiny dome."|"The Downhill Lie"|"Carl Hiaasen"
02:00|"2  a.m."|"from Dr. Bob Rotella, I finally drifted off to sleep. Serenity and self-confidence did not embrace me. By 2  a.m. I was wide-awake again, tossing restlessly and tormented by flashbacks of sh_ _ _ _ _  wedges."|"The Downhill Lie"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 06:30"|6:30|"Every time I closed my eyes I saw myself banana-slicing a drive into the big lake on No. 9. In desperation I took half an Ambien, which turned out not to be a brilliant move. When the alarm beeped at 6:30, I was a zombie."|"The Downhill Lie"|"Carl Hiaasen"
