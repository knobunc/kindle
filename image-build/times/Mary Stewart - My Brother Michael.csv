"ap 10:30"|"Half past ten"|"He spoke quickly, so quickly that I realised afterwards he must have followed my rapid French only sketchily, and was pouncing on a phrase that made sense – the sense he wanted to hear. The key still swung on his finger-tip as if it was hot and he wanted to drop it. He said: ‘That is it. This café. A young lady sitting alone. Half past ten. But I am late. You are Simon’s girl, yes?’"|"My Brother Michael"|"Mary Stewart"
"ap 00:00"|"twelve o’clock"|"At twelve o’clock, when nobody had appeared to claim the car, I thrust my plate aside, and set myself to consider that other possibility as coolly as I could."|"My Brother Michael"|"Mary Stewart"
"> 12:00"|"past noon"|"The sun beat down. Wherever the trees stood near the road the shade fell like a blessing. It was not long past noon, and the heat was terrific. The only relief was the breeze of the car’s movement, and the cloudy heads of the great olives sailing between the road and the great brazen bowl of the sky."|"My Brother Michael"|"Mary Stewart"
11:00|"eleven that morning"|"I sat back, relaxed and at ease for the first time since eleven that morning, while below us the breeze ran with white feet over the billowing olives, and beside us, along the high hot road, the sun beat the smell of dust out of the red earth, and the rock glowed and sent the heat back like blast."|"My Brother Michael"|"Mary Stewart"
"ap ~ 04:20"|"about twenty past four"|"‘Then that’s settled.’ He glanced at his wrist. ‘It’s about twenty past four now. Shall we say an hour? I’ll report back at five thirty. Right?’"|"My Brother Michael"|"Mary Stewart"
"ap 05:30"|"five thirty"|"‘Then that’s settled.’ He glanced at his wrist. ‘It’s about twenty past four now. Shall we say an hour? I’ll report back at five thirty. Right?’"|"My Brother Michael"|"Mary Stewart"
"ap < 07:00"|"nearly seven"|"‘As reparation for suspecting me of – whatever you did suspect me of.’ We were climbing through the twisting streets of Chrissa, and as we passed a lighted shop he glanced at his wrist. ‘It’s nearly seven now. Could you bear to dine in half an hour’s time – say at half past seven?’"|"My Brother Michael"|"Mary Stewart"

"ap 07:30"|Seven-thirty|"Seven-thirty was certainly an outrageously early hour for dining in Greece, and only one other of the tables under the plane trees was occupied, and that, too, by English people. Simon Lester wasn’t there yet, so I sat down under one of the trees from whose dark boughs hung lights, which swung gently in the warm evening air. I saw Simon then below the terrace railing, making one of an extremely gay and noisy group of Greeks which surrounded a fair boy in the garb of a hiker, and a very small donkey almost hidden under its awkwardly loaded panniers."|"My Brother Michael"|"Mary Stewart"
"ap 08:30"|"half past eight"|"‘I’ll call for you at half past eight.’ He gave me his sudden smile. ‘Good night, Camilla. And thank you.’"|"My Brother Michael"|"Mary Stewart"
"ap > 07:00"|"a little past seven o’clock"|"The sun was already hot and bright, though it was only just a little past seven o’clock. I walked along the village street to post my letter, then turned into the steep way that climbs between terraced streets to the mountainside above."|"My Brother Michael"|"Mary Stewart"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"It was still only eight o’clock when I left my seat and walked down the Sacred Way from the temple to the edge of the precinct, where a thick rank of pines keeps it from the road below. I went along the path under the pines, then down to the museum which sits in a curve of the road. I already seemed to have been up and about for so long that it was a surprise to find the doors still shut. There was a man in guide’s uniform sitting under the trees on the other side of the road, so I crossed over to speak to him."|"My Brother Michael"|"Mary Stewart"
"ap 09:30"|"half past nine"|"‘The museum?’ he said in answer to my query. ‘I am afraid it doesn’t open till half past nine. But would you like a guide now for the ruins, no?’"|"My Brother Michael"|"Mary Stewart"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"‘Why people should adopt that disgustingly self-righteous tone whenever they manage to achieve breakfast before eight o’clock I do not know,’ said Simon. He leaned across the car and opened the door for me. ‘Come along, then, let’s go. Unless of course you’d like to drive?’"|"My Brother Michael"|"Mary Stewart"
"ap ~ 07:00"|"about seven o’clock"|"‘Yes, at about seven o’clock. He went up past the graveyard through those pines as if he was going further up the hill.’"|"My Brother Michael"|"Mary Stewart"
12:00|noon|"‘Good,’ said Stephanos, and turned to go on. He and Simon forged ahead once more, and Niko and I took up our positions in the rear.
It must have been getting on for noon when we neared the corrie.
We left the track some way beyond the fall of rock and turned, in Stephanos’ unfaltering wake, up into a markless desert of rock and dry earth. Sometimes we trudged upwards through sienna-coloured dust strewn cruelly with small boulders, and sometimes we walked more easily across great serrated flanges of the white and living rock. The sun was at its height and the heat was intense. The air wavered with it till the whole vast sweep of rock seemed to pulsate. If it hadn’t been for the cool breeze that blew steadily at that height, it would have been insupportable."|"My Brother Michael"|"Mary Stewart"
19:46|1946|"Stephanos said, through a mouthful of cake: ‘That is so. There were three or four shocks that year. It was 1946. The villages were not affected, but a lot of rock was moved up here.’ He jerked his head towards the cliff. ‘This is not the only place of its kind. All along this ridge there are places where the tremors, and then the weather, have taken bites out of the hill. What the earthquake starts, the ice and snow don’t take many winters to finish. There are three, four, five hollows, much like this one, where very little trace of the original cliff-face remains. Only the goat-track that we came down on … see? There the cliff itself has not been moved, but you see the rocks piled against it as high as a ruined church. Oh yes, I told you, Kyrie Simon, that a man who was not always out on the hill would soon miss his landmarks.’"|"My Brother Michael"|"Mary Stewart"
"ap 07:20"|"twenty past seven"|"She came towards me. She moved like a model, hips thrown forward and knees close. She stood between me and the edge of the cliff in one of the attitudes you see in fashion drawings – one hip out, toes at twenty past seven, one thin hand gesturing with the cigarette. Any minute now she would open her mouth and let the tip of her tongue appear."|"My Brother Michael"|"Mary Stewart"
03:00|"three o’clock in the morning"|"IT must have been close on three o’clock in the morning when something woke me. My room was second from the end of the long corridor, next to Danielle’s, and at the opposite end from the outer door, near which were the rooms of the two men. The Dutch painter had gone that day, so we four were the only occupants of the studio."|"My Brother Michael"|"Mary Stewart"
"ap > 06:00"|"after six"|"IT can’t have been much after six when Simon woke me. I had sleepily answered ‘Come in’ to his knock before I remembered that I was no longer in the hotel, and this was not likely to be a chambermaid with a cup of tea. As I turned my head, looking, still sleepy-eyed, towards the door, it opened, Simon didn’t come in, but I heard his voice."|"My Brother Michael"|"Mary Stewart"
00:00|Midnight|"Madam, Will You Talk?
Wildfire at Midnight
Thunder on the Right"|"My Brother Michael"|"Mary Stewart"
