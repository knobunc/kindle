  steps. Ordinarily I would have been in bed and asleep, but there was a case
  in which I was much interested, and Braile, my assistant, had telephoned me
  of certain developments which I wished to observe. It was a night in early
  November. I paused for a moment at the top of the steps to look at the
  brilliancy of the stars. As I did so an automobile drew up at the entrance to
  the hospital."|"Burn, Witch, Burn!"|"A. Merritt"

  with me for the past week. He has not been ailing in the least. Tonight we
  were talking in my apartments, eating a late and light dinner. He was in high
  spirits. In the middle of a word, he stopped, half-turned his head as though
  listening; then slipped from his chair to the floor. When I bent over him he
  was as you see him now. That was precisely half after midnight. I brought him
  here at once.”"|"Burn, Witch, Burn!"|"A. Merritt"

"ap ~ 02:00"|"about two"|"When I awoke, the nightmarish oppression still lingered, though not so
  strongly. It was about two when we began the autopsy. I lifted the sheet from
  Peters’ body with noticeable hesitation. I stared at his face with amazement.
  All diabolism had been wiped away. It was serene, unlined—the face of a
  man who had died peacefully, with no agony either of body or mind. I lifted
  his hand, it was limp, the whole body flaccid, the rigor gone."|"Burn, Witch, Burn!"|"A. Merritt"
"ap ~ 10:00"|"about ten o’clock"|"It was then, I think, that I first felt full conviction I was dealing with
  an entirely new, or at least unknown, agency of death, whether microbic or
  otherwise. As a rule, rigor does not set in for sixteen to twenty-four hours,
  depending upon the condition of the patient before death, temperature and a
  dozen other things. Normally, it does not disappear for forty-eight to
  seventy-two hours. Usually a rapid setting-in of the stiffening means as
  rapid a disappearance, and vice versa. Diabetics stiffen quicker than others.
  A sudden brain injury, like shooting, is even swifter. In this case, the
  rigor had begun instantaneously with death, and must have completed its cycle
  in the astonishingly short time of less than five hours—for the
  attendant told me that he had examined the body about ten o’clock and he had
  thought that stiffening had not yet set in. As a matter of fact, it had come
  and gone."|"Burn, Witch, Burn!"|"A. Merritt"

  Darnley’s home. He had been working late, and had been summoned to her

  the patient lying upon her bed, and had at once been struck by the expression
  of terror on her face and the extraordinary limpness of her body. He
  described her as blonde, blue-eyed—”the doll type.”"|"Burn, Witch, Burn!"|"A. Merritt"

"ap 04:00"|four|"Nov. 7. Queer how difficult it is to keep to my resolution
  not to return to Madame Mandilip. It makes me so restless! Last night I had a
  terrifying dream. I thought I was back in that room. I could see it
  distinctly. And suddenly I realized I was looking out into it. And that I was
  inside the mirror. I knew I was little. Like a doll. I was frightened and I
  beat against it, and fluttered against it like a moth against a windowpane.
  Then I saw two beautiful long white hands stretching out to me. They opened
  the mirror and caught me and I struggled and fought and tried to get away. I
  woke with my heart beating so hard it nigh smothered me. Di says I was crying
  out: “No! No! I won’t! No, I won’t!” over and over. She threw a pillow at me
  and I suppose that’s what awakened me.



  Today I left the hospital at four, intending to go right home. I don’t know
  what I could have been thinking about, but whatever it was I must have been
  mighty preoccupied. I woke up to find myself in the Subway station just
  getting on a Bowling Green train. That would have taken me to the Battery. I
  suppose absentmindedly I had set out for Madame Mandilip’s. It gave me such a
  start that I almost ran out of the station and up to the street. I think I’m
  acting very stupidly. I always have prided myself on my common sense. I think
  I must consult Dr. Braile and see whether I’m becoming neurotic. There’s no
  earthly reason why I shouldn’t go to see Madame Mandilip. She is most
  interesting and certainly showed she liked me. It was so gracious of her to
  offer me that lovely doll. She must think me ungrateful and rude. And it
  would please Di so. When I think of how I’ve been feeling about the mirror it
  makes me feel as childish as Alice in Wonderland or Through the Looking
  Glass, rather. Mirrors or any other reflecting surfaces make you see queer
  things sometimes. Probably the heat and the fragrance had a lot to do with
  it. I really don’t know that Madame Mandilip wasn’t reflected. I was too
  intent upon looking at myself. It’s too absurd to run away and hide like a
  child from a witch. Yet that’s precisely what I’m doing. If it weren’t for
  that girl—but she certainly is a neurotic! I want to go, and I just
  don’t see why I’m behaving so."|"Burn, Witch, Burn!"|"A. Merritt"
"ap ~ 02:00"|"about two o’clock"|"Nov. 13. This is the first time I have felt like writing
  since that dreadful case of Mr. Peters on the morning of the 10th. I had just
  finished writing about Di’s doll when the hospital called to say they wanted
  me on duty that night. Of course, I said I would come. Oh, but I wish I
  hadn’t. I’ll never forget that dreadful death. Never! I don’t want to write
  or think about it. When I came home that morning I could not sleep, and I
  tossed and tossed trying to get his face out of my mind. I thought I had
  schooled myself too well to be affected by any patient. But there was
  something—Then I thought that if there was anyone who could help me to
  forget, it would be Madame Mandilip. So about two o’clock I went down to see
  her. Madame was in the store with Laschna and seemed surprised to see me so
  early. And not so pleased as usual, or so I thought but perhaps it was my
  nervousness. The moment I entered the lovely room I began to feel better.
  Madame had been doing something with wire on the table but I couldn’t see
  what because she made me sit in a big comfortable chair, saying, “You look
  tired, child. Sit here and rest until I’m finished and here’s an old picture
  book that will keep you interested.” She gave me a queer old book, long and
  narrow and it must have been very old because it was on vellum or something
  and the pictures and their colorings were like some of those books that have
  come down from the Middle Ages, the kind the old monks used to paint. They
  were all scenes in forests or gardens and the flowers and trees were the
  queerest! There were no people or anything in them but you had the strangest
  feeling that if you had just a little better eyes you could see people or
  something behind them. I mean it was as though they were hiding behind the
  trees and flowers or among them and looking out at you. I don’t know how long
  I studied the pictures, trying and trying to see those hidden folk, but at
  last Madame called me. I went to the table with the book still in my hand.
  She said, “That’s for the doll I am making of you. Take it up and see how
  cleverly it is done.” And she pointed to something made of wire on the table.
  I reached out to pick it up and then suddenly I saw that it was a skeleton.
  It was little, like a child’s skeleton and all at once the face of Mr. Peters
  flashed in my mind and I screamed in a moment of perfectly crazy panic and
  threw out my hands. The book flew out of my hand and dropped on the little
  wire skeleton and there was a sharp twang and the skeleton seemed to jump. I
  recovered myself immediately and I saw that the end of the wire had come
  loose and had cut the binding of the book and was still stuck in it. For a
  moment Madame was dreadfully angry. She caught my arm and squeezed it so it
  hurt and her eyes were furious and she said in the strangest voice, “Why did
  you do that? Answer me. Why?” And she actually shook me. I don’t blame her
  now, although then she really did frighten me, because she must have thought
  I did it deliberately. Then she saw how I was trembling and her eyes and
  voice became gentle and she said, “Something is troubling you, my dear. Tell
  me and perhaps I can help you.” She made me lie down upon a divan and sat
  beside me and stroked my hair and forehead and though I never discuss our
  cases to others I found myself pouring out the whole story of the Peters
  case. She asked who was the man who had brought him to the hospital and I
  said Dr. Lowell called him Ricori and I supposed he was the notorious
  gangster. Her hands made me feel quiet and nice and sleepy and I told her
  about Dr. Lowell and how great a doctor he is and how terribly I am in love
  in secret with Dr. B-. I’m sorry I told her about the case. Never have I done
  such a thing. But I was so shaken and once I had begun I seemed to have to
  tell her everything. Everything in my mind was so distorted that once when I
  had lifted my head to look at her I actually thought she was gloating. That
  shows how little I was like myself! After I had finished she told me to lie
  there and sleep and she would waken me when I wished. So I said I must go at
  four. I went right to sleep and woke up feeling rested and fine. When I went
  out the little skeleton and book were still on the table, and I said I was so
  sorry about the book. She said, “Better the book than your hand, my dear. The
  wire might have snapped loose while you were handling it and given you a
  nasty cut.” She wants me to bring down my nurse’s dress so she can make a
  little one like it for the new doll."|"Burn, Witch, Burn!"|"A. Merritt"

  dismiss my thoughts, I tried to read. I was too restless, and soon gave it
  up. Like the room in which Ricori lay, my study is at the rear, looking down
  upon the little garden. I walked to the window and stared out, unseeingly.
  More vivid than ever was that feeling of standing before a blank door which
  it was vitally important to open. I turned back into the study and was
  surprised to find it was close to ten o’clock. I dimmed my light and lay down

  his station beside Ricori. Bill drew up a chair, and sat facing me. I thrust
  my hand into my pocket and clutched the knotted cord, closed my eyes, emptied
  my mind of all thought, and relaxed. In abandoning, at least temporarily, my
  conception of a sane universe I had determined to give that of Madame
  Mandilip’s every chance to operate.
Faintly, I heard a clock strike one. I slept.
Somewhere a vast wind was roaring. It circled and swept down upon me. It
  bore me away. I knew that I had no body, that indeed I had no form. Yet I
  was. A formless sentience whirling in that vast wind. It carried me into
  infinite distance. Bodiless, intangible as I knew myself to be, yet it poured

  hell. But they ain’t seen her go, an’ they pass the buck to the boys in
  front."|"Burn, Witch, Burn!"|"A. Merritt"
"ap ~ 11:00"|"about eleven o’clock"|"“Then about eleven o’clock one of the relief lads comes in with worse
  news. He says he’s down at the foot of Broadway when a coupe turns the corner
  an’ driving it is the gal. He can’t be mistaken because he’s seen her in the
  doll joint. She goes up Broadway at a clip. He sees there ain’t nobody
  trailing her, an’ he looks around for a taxi. Course there’s nothing in sight
  —not even a parked car he can lift. So he comes down to the gang to ask
  what the hell they mean by it. An’ again nobody’s seen the gal go.”"|"Burn, Witch, Burn!"|"A. Merritt"
"ap ~ 04:00"|"about four o’clock"|"“I take a couple of the boys an’ we start out to comb the neighborhood to
  find out where she stables the coupe. We don’t have no luck at all until
  about four o’clock when one of the tails—one of the lads who’s been
  looking—meets up with me. He says that about three he sees the gal
  —at least he thinks it’s the gal—walking along the street around
  the corner from the joint. She’s got a coupla big suitcases but they don’t
  seem to trouble her none. She’s walking quick. But away from the doll joint.
  He eases over to get a better look, when all of a sudden she ain’t there. He
  sniffs around the place he’s seen her. There ain’t hide nor hair of her. It’s
  pretty dark, an’ he tries the doors an’ the areaways, but the doors are
  locked an’ there ain’t nobody in the areaways. So he gives it up an’ hunts
  me."|"Burn, Witch, Burn!"|"A. Merritt"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"“I lock the place up again, an’ go back to the boys. I watch with ‘em the
  rest of the night. Not a light in the doll joint. But nigh eight o’clock, the
  gal shows up inside the shop and opens up!”"|"Burn, Witch, Burn!"|"A. Merritt"

"ap 07:00"|seven|"At seven I arose and ate a full and excellent dinner, deliberately
  drinking at least twice the amount of wine I ordinarily permit myself,
  finishing with strong coffee. When I arose from the table I felt distinctly
  better, mentally alert and master of myself once more—or so I believed.
  I had decided to apprise Ricori of my instructions to McCann concerning the
  abduction of the girl. I realized that this was certain to bring down upon me
  a minute catechism concerning my visit to the doll-shop, but I had formulated
  the story I intended to tell -"|"Burn, Witch, Burn!"|"A. Merritt"
"ap 09:30"|nine-thirty|"“At any rate, I’ve told you the essentials. And I’m dead tired. I’m going
  to take a bath and go to bed. It’s now nine-thirty. If the girl does come out
  it won’t be before eleven, probably later. I’m going to sleep until McCann
  fetches her. If he doesn’t, I’m going to sleep all night. That’s final. Save
  your questions for the morning.”"|"Burn, Witch, Burn!"|"A. Merritt"
