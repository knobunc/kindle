00:00|midnight|"Nevia, the home planet of the marauding space-ship, would have appeared
peculiar indeed to Terrestrial senses. High in the deep red heavens a
fervent blue sun poured down its flood of brilliant purplish light upon
a world of water. Not a cloud was to be seen in that flaming sky, and
through that dustless atmosphere the eye could see the horizon—a
horizon three times as distant as the one to which we are
accustomed—with a distinctness and clarity impossible in our Terra's
dust-filled air. As that mighty sun dropped below the horizon the sky
would fill suddenly with clouds and rain would fall violently and
steadily until midnight. Then the clouds would vanish as suddenly as
they had come into being, the torrential downpour would cease, and,
through that huge world's wonderfully transparent, gaseous envelope, the
full glory of the firmament would be revealed. Not the firmament as we
know it—for that hot blue sun and Nevia, her one planet-child, were
many light-years distant from Old Sol and his numerous brood—but a
strange and glorious firmament containing not one constellation familiar
to earthly eyes."|Triplanetary|"E. E. _doc_ Smith"
12:00|noon|"""Look here, girl; you've got to learn how to sleep. You're all in. Your
eyes look like you'd been on a Martian picnic and you didn't eat half
enough breakfast. You've got to sleep and eat to keep fit. We don't want
you passing out on us, so I'll put out this light, and you'll lie down
here and sleep until noon."""|Triplanetary|"E. E. _doc_ Smith"
"ap 04:11"|"four hours, eleven minutes"|"""Thank God you're alive, and twice that the ship works!"" he exclaimed.
""You've been gone four hours, eleven minutes, and forty-one seconds, but
never mind about abstract theorizing. Get back here, to Pittsburgh, as
fast as you can drive. That Nevian vessel or another like her is mopping
up the city, and has destroyed half the Fleet already!"""|Triplanetary|"E. E. _doc_ Smith"
