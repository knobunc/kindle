"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"The Black Pearl opened the gate. She laughed suddenly, a little scuddering of dry leaves. “You won’t live past midnight on the streets. Get out.” The gate clanged shut with more force than necessary. “You are already dead.”"|"Ombria in Shadow"|"Patricia A. McKillip"
12:00|noon|"Mag, who did not consider herself human, moved easily in and out of the various places where Ombria crumbled into its past. By the time she was seven, she knew doors all over the city. There was the little worm-eaten gate in the sagging wall behind the stables in the yard of the Raven’s Eye Inn. There was the shadow at the end of Glover’s Alley, which Mag’s sharp eyes noticed never changed position, morning or noon. There was the gaudy patch of sunflowers beside the west gate of the palace of the Prince of Ombria, that did nothing all day long but turn their golden-haired, thousand-eyed faces to follow the sun. The Prince of Ombria, whom Faey called the Reprobate, never bothered with what stood outside his iron gates on their graceful, gargantuan stalks and sometimes peered over his wall. If Faey wanted spare eyes, Mag knew how to grow them. The door to the undercity lay in the midst of the sunflowers: a hole between roots where what looked like some animal’s den was the top of an ancient chimney. Steps leading down to the sea from the docks led farther than anyone guessed. Street drains, unused cellars, holes beneath steps, were doors that even the city urchins had discovered. Mag saw them sometimes, flitting through fingers of light from drains and broken windows and holes above their heads, exploring the secret streets, sitting on the walls of roofless houses, eating stolen apples or searching the rooms for treasure that lay just beyond their eyesight, in the moment just beyond their steps. They never eluded Faey’s notice, and she never let them stay, as often as they planned to take up residence in the quiet, warm, secret place and fill a ruined city with a tattered population of waifs. They would get uneasy as the upper light began to fade, start glancing over their skinny shoulders and scratching for nonexistent fleas. Faey made the stones they threw into streams echo across vast distances; she made the old joists and chimneys whisper; she sent the icy breath of something snoring in a cellar curling around their ankles, so that they scrabbled with relief back up to the dangerous twilight of Ombria."|"Ombria in Shadow"|"Patricia A. McKillip"
12:00|noon|"“I want you to go above. I need certain things. Don’t be long; we’ll have work by noon. Those who fear Domina Pearl’s housekeeping will be scattering through the city looking for protective charms.”"|"Ombria in Shadow"|"Patricia A. McKillip"
00:00|midnight|"But Kyel had vanished along with that beautiful young woman in sapphire heels who had danced with a prince. She was as dead as Royce was, she knew. That’s what the courtiers would think, having seen her abandoned in Ombria at midnight. Murdered, or locked in some dingy room above a tavern on the water where the Black Pearl’s ships docked. Either way, dead to their world."|"Ombria in Shadow"|"Patricia A. McKillip"
"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"But what exactly could she do that would bring her most consistently into Kyel’s presence? She tried to remember her previous life, while responding to the details and demands of the present. The crowd, trying to drink its way past the uncertainty and peril of the changing rule, kept her working long past midnight. With some regard for her poor feet, her father put her behind the bar to wash mugs for a while. She gave that idea scant thought: stuck in the palace kitchens, she would never see the child-prince. She wouldn’t dare wear the starched aprons and caps of those who carried trays here and there, even if she could talk her way into such a position. One hard-eyed glance from Domina Pearl, and she would find herself among the crabs at the bottom of the harbor. She had to attract no attention, no interest from anyone."|"Ombria in Shadow"|"Patricia A. McKillip"
12:00|noon|"Mag had come to explore the palace, to find its disused passageways, its hiding places, the secrets known to harried servants and mice that everyone else had forgotten. She wanted to know the palace as she knew the streets of Ombria. She wanted to be able to disappear into it, to disguise herself so well that she might appear, to the most acute eye, of no more interest than a noon shadow or a fire iron."|"Ombria in Shadow"|"Patricia A. McKillip"
00:00|midnight|"Mag lay awake later, listening for Faey’s snores. The gypsy was unusually quiet for hours. Finally, when the Watch on the streets cried midnight, Mag heard a delicate, sea-shell snoring echoing through the house. She slipped out of bed, walked barefoot to Faey’s room, avoiding the slats and steps that creaked. The door was open. Faey had fallen asleep with a candle burning. An Illustrated Book for Gardeners lay open across her face. The room, untidy at best, was a formidable chaos of half-visible things: furniture that could not possibly fit in it, great wardrobes, the corners of massive tables, other beds. Clothing or fabric was strewn everywhere; shoes from several centuries lay piecemeal and without partners all over the floor. The skins of slain animals along with their heads hung across mirrors, upside down from wardrobe doors. They watched Mag, tiny candle fires in their eyes. Even the grate seemed full of oddments, illusions, as if every painting from which Faey had ever borrowed her bedchamber were all crowding into the room at once."|"Ombria in Shadow"|"Patricia A. McKillip"
"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"Lydea, wondering, returned books neatly to the shelves, except for the book on basic mathematics, which she took with her to her room. The halls were silent at that hour before noon, but for the occasional passing bundle of rich and colorful laundry that had been removed quickly from sight in the upper world to be transported to the lower through the servants’ halls. She remembered Mag, then, waiting in her room or not waiting, as the mood had seized her. Lydea quickened her step, expecting either Mag or a lack of Mag to greet her beyond her door."|"Ombria in Shadow"|"Patricia A. McKillip"
00:00|midnight|"She glimpsed an impossibility ahead of her, as a window in a room she reeled into gave her a sight of Ombria far below, the crooked, winding streets she had fled down in the night spread out like a maze between the palace and the sea. A tall man with hair the color of ivory moved away from the window to slip through a shadowed doorway in the wall. “Ducon,” she whispered, with barely strength enough to shape the name. Shadow lay as deep and stark as midnight sea across the door."|"Ombria in Shadow"|"Patricia A. McKillip"
12:00|midday|"The Prince of Ombria and his governess sat together on his bed, gazing at the array of puppets spread across the vast expanse of silk. The prince, who had just finished his midday meal, looked heavy-eyed and drowsy. But he still stifled his yawns, and his hands moved busily among the puppets, choosing, discarding, until they pounced finally on the moon with her crystal eyes and her hands shaped like stars."|"Ombria in Shadow"|"Patricia A. McKillip"
