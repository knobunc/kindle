00:00|midnight|"""Northerner,"" continued the first voice, ""know that we are the ancient master thieves of Lankhmar, and that we needs must have the lost brain, which is his skull, of our brother Ohmphal. You must bring it to us before the stars of midnight next shine overhead. Else you will be sought out and your life drawn from you."""|"Swords Against Death"|"Fritz Leiber"
00:00|midnight|"""You must bring the skull without fail,"" echoed the second voice.
""Before next midnight,"" came another.
""The jewels must be in the skull; not one must be held back from us."""|"Swords Against Death"|"Fritz Leiber"
00:00|midnight|"Fissif nodded, and added, ""He seemed to be in a fever. Struggled against his bonds and muttered words. Something about 'next midnight.' He repeated that three times. The rest was in an outlandish tongue."""|"Swords Against Death"|"Fritz Leiber"
00:00|midnight|"""'Next midnight,' Master,"" answered Fissif, becoming obsequious himself."|"Swords Against Death"|"Fritz Leiber"
00:00|midnight|"Their import was this: _If you do not bring the jeweled skull to what was Krovas' and is now Slevyas' chamber by next midnight, we will begin to kill the Northerner._"|"Swords Against Death"|"Fritz Leiber"
00:00|midnight|"Again next night the fog crept into Lankhmar. Sounds were muffled and torches ringed with smoky halos. But it was not yet late, although midnight was nearing, and the streets were filled with hurrying shopkeepers and craftsmen, and drinkers happily laughing from their first cups, and sailors new on leave ogling the shopgirls."|"Swords Against Death"|"Fritz Leiber"
12:00|noon|"But the old woman took no notice of this and repeated stubbornly, ""Let me in, I say. I read the future. It's cold in the street and the fog freezes my old throat. Let me in. This noon a bat came flapping and told me portentously of events destined for the dweller in this house. My old eyes can see the shadows of things which are not yet. Let me in, I say."""|"Swords Against Death"|"Fritz Leiber"
00:00|midnight|"Slowly the Mouser began to ascend the stair, leaning heavily on the cane and stopping every few steps as if to recover his breath. It was not easy for him to go at such a snail-like pace, with midnight so near. But he had already failed three times in attempts to enter this well-guarded house, and he knew that the slightest unnatural action might betray him. Before he was halfway up, the husky voice gave a command and a dark-haired serving woman, in a black silk tunic, hurried down, her bare feet making little noise on the stone."|"Swords Against Death"|"Fritz Leiber"
00:00|midnight|"But thoughts of Fafhrd and the skull were uppermost in his mind, and he knew that midnight was close at hand. He learned much of Ivlis: for one thing, that she hated Slevyas almost more than she feared him. But the information he most wanted eluded him."|"Swords Against Death"|"Fritz Leiber"
00:00|midnight|"The upper bowl of the crystal water clock was almost empty. Fafhrd stolidly watched the twinkling drops form and fall into the lower bowl. He was on the floor with his back to the wall. His legs were tied from knee to ankle, his arms laced behind him with an equally unnecessary amount of cordage, so that he felt quite numb. To either side of him squatted an armed thief.
When the upper bowl emptied it would be midnight.
Occasionally his gaze shifted to the dark, disfigured faces which ringed the table on which the clock and certain curious instruments of torture rested. The faces were those of the aristocrats of the Thieves' Guild, men with crafty eyes and lean cheeks, who vied with one another as to the richness and greasiness of their finery. Flickering torches threw highlights of soiled reds and purples, tarnished cloth of silver and gold. But behind their masklike expressions Fafhrd sensed uncertainty. Only Slevyas, sitting in the chair of dead Krovas, seemed truly calm and self-possessed. His voice was almost casual as he interrogated a lesser thief who knelt abjectly before him."|"Swords Against Death"|"Fritz Leiber"
00:00|midnight|"""How can you dare keep them?"" questioned Ivlis. ""Are you not afraid of brown bones at midnight?"" She shuddered and eyed the Mouser with a certain solicitude."|"Swords Against Death"|"Fritz Leiber"
12:00|midday|"""And then he bid us patch the sails and make the sloop shipshape. By midday we were flying west at a speed even greater than we had made during the storm, but so long were the swells and so swift did they move with us that we could only climb five or six in a whole day. By the Black Idols, but they were long!"|"Swords Against Death"|"Fritz Leiber"
"< 12:00"|"Toward midday"|"Toward midday he found a waterhole, lay down to drink and rest a little. A short way back he had again seen Fafhrd's prints. Now he noted another set in the soft earth; not Fafhrd's, but roughly parallel to his. They were at least a day older, wide-spaced, too, but a little wobbly. From their size and shape they might very well have been made by the guide's sandals; the middle of the print showed faintly the mark of thongs such as he had worn about the instep."|"Swords Against Death"|"Fritz Leiber"
00:00|midnight|"""Your friend's body is poised on the brink of life. If you handle it roughly it may overbalance. If you strip off the bandages he will only die the quicker. You cannot help him."" Then, reading the Mouser's question, ""No, there is no antidote."" Then hastily, as if he feared to take away all hope, ""But he will not be defenseless against them. He is strong. His ghost may be strong, too. He may be able to weary them out. If he lives until midnight he may return."""|"Swords Against Death"|"Fritz Leiber"
00:00|midnight|"The Mouser fetched a stubby, heavy-wicked candle from the cabin and fixed it in a small horn lantern that was proof against the wind. Hanging at the stern it pushed back the darkness a little, not much. Until midnight it was the Mouser's watch. After a while Fafhrd slumbered."|"Swords Against Death"|"Fritz Leiber"
"ap 03:00"|Three|"""Three in a night,"" she cried. ""You have killed the third. It is well, falconer."""|"Swords Against Death"|"Fritz Leiber"
"ap 01:00"|one|"Fafhrd followed as they receded. He felt a stirring of interest ... and of other feelings. To meet his own supernatural mentor alone might be only a bore and a mild nervous strain; but it would be hard for anyone entirely to repress a shiver of awe at encountering at one and the same time both Ningauble of the Seven Eyes and Sheelba of the Eyeless Face."|"Swords Against Death"|"Fritz Leiber"
