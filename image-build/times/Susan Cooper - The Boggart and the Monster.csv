By two separate special messengers, arranged at huge cost which he hoped would be reimbursed, he had sent his first pictures of the Monster to the Glasgow Herald and his first videotape to Scottish Television, with a careful stipulation that he himself was to keep the world rights of each.

“Very reasonable,” said Mr. Maconochie, and he wrote her a check, being a careful and reactionary man who did not approve of credit cards."|"The Boggart and the Monster"|"Susan Cooper"

It’s just a couple of seals.”"|"The Boggart and the Monster"|"Susan Cooper"
