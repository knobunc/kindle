"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"The sun climbed higher and higher. He plowed for two more hours, then paused again to rest his team. He looked up, feeling strong pangs of hunger. Must be about noon. His home, half a mile away, was a handsome three-room log house with a lean-to barn and a sod smokehouse, nestling snugly in a clearing surrounded by oak, hickory, and blackjack. A column of gray smoke curled from the stone fireplace, and Jeff knew his mother was busy cooking among her pots and ovens there."|"Rifles for Watie"|"Harold Keith"
10:00|"ten o’clock in the morning"|"There would be fat bacon, corn bread in pone, dandelion greens, wild honey, and fried onions from the new garden. Jeff sighed resignedly. No dinner for him today. His mother had packed a big piece of cold corn pone and given him a bottle of water from the spring. But, boylike, he had eaten all the pone at ten o’clock in the morning and now he was hungry again."|"Rifles for Watie"|"Harold Keith"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"They sat up that night until nine o’clock while Jeff told them all about his new life in the army. To Jeff’s surprise, his father remembered Clardy from the Mexican War."|"Rifles for Watie"|"Harold Keith"
03:00|"three o’clock in the morning"|"The bugles blew at three o’clock in the morning. Jeff didn’t hear them but when the orderly sergeant shook him, he got right up, washed his eyes in cold water, and began to pack."|"Rifles for Watie"|"Harold Keith"
12:00|noon|"One night Jeff wrote to his parents, “We eat breakfast early and supper late to lose the flies. But at noon the flies get as much of it as we do.” He hoped to mail the letter when they reached Springfield. The government stage would take it back to Fort Leavenworth and it would go south from there by mule train to Sugar Mound, near Jeff’s home, where his folks would get it when they came to buy supplies."|"Rifles for Watie"|"Harold Keith"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"Although he had marched all day in the torrid heat, Jeff walked sentry all night. At nine o’clock his eyes began to feel heavy, at eleven he was nodding, at midnight he was dozing on his feet and went to the cook’s mess to get a cup of hot coffee so he could stay awake, helping himself to the pot on the fire. As he stood drinking, he heard the cooks snoring loudly as they slept on quilts under the stars. Then he heard a voice, calling his name."|"Rifles for Watie"|"Harold Keith"

04:00|"four o’clock in the morning"|"Just thinking about it the rest of the night helped keep him awake. Relieved at four o’clock in the morning, he slept in his uniform a couple of hours before the army started marching again. Noah awakened him ten minutes before they lined up. Jeff was tired and logy. He just had time to wash his eyes in cold water and swallow some cold bacon and fried potatoes Noah had saved for him when he heard the cavalry bugles."|"Rifles for Watie"|"Harold Keith"
"< 12:00"|"just before noon"|"When the army marched into the streets of Springfield just before noon, the town was in a near panic. It was August 9, 1861. Everybody knew a battle would soon be fought. The whole town seemed frightened. All afternoon Jeff watched the excitement and the confusion, while the soldiers lay resting on the grass beneath several gigantic oak trees in the shady town square. Merchandise and household goods were being loaded into wagons, ready for flight. People were cooping their chickens, harnessing their teams, calling to their children. Storekeepers and citizens presented food and tobacco lavishly to the soldiers. Everybody was afraid that if the rebels won, they would ravish the town."|"Rifles for Watie"|"Harold Keith"
01:00|"one o’clock in the morning"|"At one o’clock in the morning by Millholland’s big silver watch, they stopped in the roadside grass and rested a couple of hours. Jeff checked the priming and the hammer on his musket, then lay down on the rough ground and slept. At three o’clock he felt a hand shaking his shoulder and heard the sergeant’s voice whispering in his ear."|"Rifles for Watie"|"Harold Keith"

12:00|noon|"Three months later he wasn’t so fortunate. On a balmy day in January, Captain Clardy ordered all guns cleaned for a noon inspection."|"Rifles for Watie"|"Harold Keith"
"< 00:00"|"nearly midnight"|"Turning on his side, he shut his eyes and clenched his teeth. Although he still hadn’t lost his desire to fight in battle, he was torn with loathing for all the cruelty and tyranny that accompanied war. Sleep didn’t come to him until nearly midnight."|"Rifles for Watie"|"Harold Keith"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"It was two o’clock. Jeff didn’t know it was Sunday until he dug the tiny calendar memorandum out of his shirt pocket. December 7, 1862, it read. Impatiently he peered hard ahead into the timber held by the Confederates. All he could see was trees."|"Rifles for Watie"|"Harold Keith"
"< 00:00"|"before midnight"|"Dark was falling. It was growing colder, too. Now they were sorry they had thrown away their coats. Union soldiers were breaking up fence rails to feed their fires. The firelight flared brightly in the soft Arkansas dusk. At the rate the rails were disappearing, Jeff knew the entire fence would be gone before midnight."|"Rifles for Watie"|"Harold Keith"
12:00|noon|"At noon they reached Cane Hill, where a month earlier a battle had been fought. They were told there would be a short rest and that they might visit the rebel hospital, if they wished."|"Rifles for Watie"|"Harold Keith"
00:00|midnight|"He pulled up the collar on his long coat and tried to walk around the puddles. As usual, it didn’t look good for the infantry. However, as they kept moving southward, there was less and less snow until soon it had all disappeared and the roads became firmer and smoother. They marched until midnight, rested until dawn, and after a breakfast of hot coffee, cold bacon and the hated hardtack, began walking again."|"Rifles for Watie"|"Harold Keith"
"~ 10:00"|"About ten o’clock in the morning"|"But now a new species of torture awaited them. About ten o’clock in the morning they struck the head of Cove Creek. The stream grew wider and deeper as the snow melting in the mountains emptied hundreds of noisy rivulets into it, and meandered in so many loops and curves that the road crossed it thirty-seven times."|"Rifles for Watie"|"Harold Keith"
22:00|"ten o’clock that night"|"Jeff was surprised how well the infantry bore the frequent wettings. It was amazing how much you could stand when you had to. The constant marching with the wind to their backs kept them from growing chilled. They marched until ten o’clock that night, then built great log fires on the bank to dry their wet clothing. The bugles sounded reveille at three o’clock next morning, and after a breakfast of dried peas and hot coffee, they resumed the punishing trek. They plodded through the noon hour without food. The valley had widened now, and the road crossed the creek less often. Hunger was their main discomfort."|"Rifles for Watie"|"Harold Keith"

03:00|"three o’clock in the morning"|"The army was ravenously hungry. They had been marching without food since three o’clock in the morning. Soon they broke ranks, and four thousand Union soldiers were helping themselves to whatever they could find. Jeff, Noah, Bill, and Stuart Mitchell, foraging in a side street, had immediate luck. They ran into a Negro who had emerged from a deserted brick store, carrying a large ham."|"Rifles for Watie"|"Harold Keith"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"At one o’clock he was relieved and crawled between his blankets high on the bluff overlooking the town. Most of the soldiers were sleeping. Behind him Jeff could hear their snores and their measured, heavy breathing. He was just dozing off when somebody shook his shoulder roughly."|"Rifles for Watie"|"Harold Keith"
"ap ~ 02:00"|"about two"|"David pointed back up the road. “It’s only about two, three days behind us.”"|"Rifles for Watie"|"Harold Keith"
"< 23:00"|"an hour before midnight"|"It was stiflingly hot. Wearily Jeff slapped at a mosquito. His uniform, stiff with dirt and dust, chafed, and his body smelled of stale sweat. His musket was heavy. Switching it to the opposite shoulder, he wished he could have drawn the duty on top of the bluff, where there was a breeze. Although it was an hour before midnight, and everything was black as pitch, it seemed to him the night was very much alive."|"Rifles for Watie"|"Harold Keith"
01:00|"one o’clock in the morning"|"Shortly after the sentries had called one o’clock in the morning, Blunt emerged from the tent. Walking to the fire, he stooped, lifting a small kettle off it. He poured a steaming dark-colored liquid into a small metal cup. Adding sugar which he took from an envelope in his shirt pocket, he raised the cup to his bearded lips as though to drink from it."|"Rifles for Watie"|"Harold Keith"
"ap 02:00"|two|"Gaping, Jeff shrank back into the darkness. He hoped the general hadn’t seen him. When he finally got to bed at two, he heard raindrops pattering timidly on his tent and then swelling into a steady deluge."|"Rifles for Watie"|"Harold Keith"
"< 12:00"|"almost noon"|"Obeying a whim, he took Dixie along. It was almost noon. The day was hot and humid. He jogged the dun slowly so the dog could stay up. It would be a good outing for her. With an air of mingled discouragement and keen expectancy, he trotted into the outskirts of the town."|"Rifles for Watie"|"Harold Keith"
"~ 00:00"|"about midnight"|"Moving slowly, Mrs. Washbourne shut the door behind him. “Mr. Bussey, first of all, I want to thank you sincerely for your thoughtfulness in connection with my son Lee’s death. It has been a sad time for all of us. Belle Lisenbee and Mr. Hicks got here about midnight with Lee’s body. They had to awaken us. Of course, nobody slept any more that night. They stayed until the next morning, and Mr. Hicks dug the grave. We buried Lee on the same hillside where he and Lucy used to play with their sleds when they were children. It was God’s will, I suppose, that my son died so young, but it has been very hard for me to bear.”"|"Rifles for Watie"|"Harold Keith"
00:00|midnight|"They started at midnight. There was a full moon. This time they went west instead of east. Avoiding the fords again, they swam the Arkansas six miles west of the fort. Although the river was falling, Jeff gasped once as the water rose to his knees and spilled into his boots when the dun stepped into a deep hole and had to swim. But they got across safely. On the rebel side, Orff divided the patrol into pairs. With a brief handshake, they separated, riding in different directions."|"Rifles for Watie"|"Harold Keith"
12:00|noonday|"Watie rolled to his feet with a lithe, catlike motion that would have done credit to a far younger man. Now that the firelight glimmered squarely on him, Jeff saw that he was a little, dark-skinned Indian with a square face and a flat nose. He looked more like a full-blood than a mixed-blood. Jeff was never so disappointed in his life. He had always imagined Watie to be a big, sinister fellow. Instead, he looked like some gentle old Indian farmer taking a noonday nap under a tree."|"Rifles for Watie"|"Harold Keith"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"He found out next afternoon. At four o’clock they were mustered for pay. It was the first pay muster in two years, Hooley said. After a review and inspection, Boudinot himself acted as paymaster. Most of the money he had brought, Watie ordered spent to relieve the needs of the destitute rebel refugee families. But each trooper received a month’s salary, too. Jeff looked curiously at the crisp, new green bank notes, two fives and five ones."|"Rifles for Watie"|"Harold Keith"
"< 12:00"|"shortly before noon"|"His family lived in Kansas and would be squarely in the path of the proposed raid. He worried about that all the way back from Cabin Creek. He didn’t want a Watie raid hitting his father’s farm. He drove back one of the captured Federal wagons, bringing with him blankets, shawls, sugar, and Union coffee for the Jackmans and a little bit of everything for Hooley, who had survived the long horseback ride from Pheasant Bluff and was recovering in the hospital at Boggy Depot. Arriving at Boggy Depot shortly before noon, he unhitched the big, black Union mules, watered them, unharnessed them, and staked them out to graze. Walking to a nearby creek, he stripped off his dirty clothing, took a bath and felt refreshed."|"Rifles for Watie"|"Harold Keith"
12:00|noon|"“I’ll deal with nobody but Watie.” He looked at the sun, low in the west, and scowled. “I said noon. Where is he?”"|"Rifles for Watie"|"Harold Keith"
12:00|noon|"At noon he came to a wide road with deep ruts made by wagons. He knew it was the road running east from Perryville to Fort Smith. It was an important landmark and he felt a little encouraged, knowing he was roughly halfway to the fort."|"Rifles for Watie"|"Harold Keith"
