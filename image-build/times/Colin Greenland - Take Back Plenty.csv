"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"Tabitha’s headset suddenly locked into an ambient channel and began to tinkle with tinny salsa. Irritated, she snatched out the earpiece and let the set dangle round her neck. She had to get a move on if she was going to make it to the city before noon. Hoisting her bag, she sidestepped a cargo float, waded through a crowd of squabbling Perks and elbowed between two Alteceans and a city guide they were trying to haggle. Stepping high in the light gravity and brandishing the bag before her, she ploughed her way out into the open air."|"Take Back Plenty"|"Colin Greenland"
"ap 02:50"|two-fifty|"She cleared her throat. “Well, we’ll have to take our chance on Plenty. But I need the two-fifty in advance.” She looked at the clock. “To pay the fine.”"|"Take Back Plenty"|"Colin Greenland"
"ap 02:50"|Two-fifty|"Tabitha drank some more coffee. “Expensive joke,” she said.
“Well, let’s see. Two-fifty.”
“Three with the port tax and stuff. Three-seventy-five with fuel.”"|"Take Back Plenty"|"Colin Greenland"
00:00|midnight|"Humans are inquisitive creatures by nature. Not everyone was content to remain an unenlightened beneficiary of a superior technology. But even those who tried to think their way in were obliged to retreat, baffled. Ace hackers on clandestine projects for ruthless outfits like Frewin Maisang Tobermory were taken away at midnight in unmarked ambulances after collapsing with mysterious new conceptual diseases and cognitive dysfunctions. Some ingrates and irresponsible rumour-mongers tried to implicate the Eladeldi in these abrupt disappearances, which made no sense at all. The Eladeldi were never known to involve themselves in medical matters."|"Take Back Plenty"|"Colin Greenland"
00:00|midnight|"Someone understood them. Indeed, their power to agitate whole regions of Central Africa and parts of South America was remarkable. Cults were revived, savage midnight duels enacted. Entire armies deserted and vanished; to labour as slaves, some said, at first in a doomed attempt to develop a site on Venus, and after on the most monstrous orbital ever built."|"Take Back Plenty"|"Colin Greenland"

“At eight!”

"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"“I mean to say,” he continued smoothly, “Contraband is our name. Our performing name.” He said this as if it were obvious, as if he were explaining something self-evident to a small child. “We are a performing group. A group of artists. We have an engagement at eight o’clock tonight at the Mercury Garden.”"|"Take Back Plenty"|"Colin Greenland"
05:00|"five in the morning"|"It was on Earth. You were at Brasilia Port, I was a few kilometres down the road at a cheap motel. I was asleep. The clerk came and banged on the door. It was five in the morning. She said, “Capitan Jute? Telephon for you,” she said. Which was weird, because nobody knew I was there. I’d just biked down the road and chosen a place at random."|"Take Back Plenty"|"Colin Greenland"
"ap < 03:00"|"nearly three"|"Squatting and dusting off her hands, Tabitha contemplated it. It was longer than she remembered: a couple of metres, nearly three, and most of a metre in diameter. It was padded vinyl on the outside, rigid metal underneath. That, and the weight, almost made her think it might be gold after all. Did you ship gold in padded cylinders? She had no idea. There was a place where it was supposed to have labels on it, but somebody had taken them off. She wondered how you opened it."|"Take Back Plenty"|"Colin Greenland"
00:00|midnight|"“Around the shoulder of Jove they whirl,” he said, fantasising. “A hundred jewels flung like seeds across the black field of night! One by one they reach velocity and wink out of existence. There goes the Tredgolds’ Behemoth! Across the open net the cheers ring out! Next the Frazier Asterak Roublov ironclads, Kanzan and Jitoku, one so close after the other the bets will never be decided. Before anyone can catch their breath, the Frasque mass cradles start to sparkle and spin, by twos and threes, disappearing in the darkness like snowflakes on a December midnight. Then at last, in one wild flare of incoherent light, the small fry that have bobbed along in the swirl, all vanish at once — to re-emerge a few weeks later, strung out along a million-metre arc of the lip of Saturn’s well!”"|"Take Back Plenty"|"Colin Greenland"
12:00|noon|"Not that the face of Venus is not fair, especially on a first approach. So thick is its purulent, yeasty atmosphere, so dank and condensed the air, that each climactic zone is a stain of a different colour, shimmering and changing as the huge day dawns, intensifies and wanes. Venus is a chameleon with the range of the peacock, the kingfisher, the butterfly. At the shining edge of the world, in advance of the slow, smouldering terminator, white Niobe wakes tinted with apricot or mauve, while further along Eisila already glows orange as fresh fire, blotted with the black smears of thunderheads. In the white heat of the unimaginable noon, the Mare Evita Peron blazes like molten gold, incandescent and steaming; the Jezebel Basin is a spill of turquoise ink, flecked with viridian foam. Perelandra Planitia slumbers, stretched out in the torpid afternoon, its taut uplands sparkling with spikes and splinters of rainbow. Evening has claimed Asteria, its crumpled tracts of fog like burnished bronze in the last reach of the sun."|"Take Back Plenty"|"Colin Greenland"
"ap 00:48"|"twelve to one"|"It was boring at first, though, because I had to take the Mandebras circulating, so they could show their faces at all the right parties, avoid the wrong ones conspicuously, and create a stir by turning up at one or two where they weren’t expected. All the time news was coming in. “The Duluth at twelve to one!” “Tell Hyun-seng Tredgold the Behemoth has gone!”"|"Take Back Plenty"|"Colin Greenland"
