"ap 05:00"|five|"The poor little hobbit sat down in the hall and put his head in his hands, and wondered what had happened, and what was going
         to happen, and whether they would all stay to supper. Then the bell rang again louder than ever, and he had to run to the
         door. It was not four after all, it was five. Another dwarf had come along while he was wondering in the hall. He had hardly
         turned the knob, before they were all inside, bowing and saying “at your service” one after another. Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, and Gloin were their names; and very soon two purple hoods, a grey hood, a brown
         hood, and a white hood were hanging on the pegs, and off they marched with their broad hands stuck in their gold and silver
         belts to join the others. Already it had almost become a throng. Some called for ale, and some for porter, and one for coffee,
         and all of them for cakes; so the hobbit was kept very busy for a while."|"The Hobbit"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"
"~ 12:00"|"About midday"|"But at last unexpectedly they found what they were seeking. Fili and Kili and the hobbit went back one day down the valley
         and scrambled among the tumbled rocks at its southern corner. About midday, creeping behind a great stone that stood alone
         like a pillar, Bilbo came on what looked like rough steps going upwards. Following these excitedly he and the dwarves found
         traces of a narrow track, often lost, often rediscovered, that wandered on to the top of the southern ridge and brought them
         at last to a still narrower ledge, which turned north across the face of the Mountain. Looking down they saw that they were
         at the top of the cliff at the valley’s head and were gazing down on to their own camp below. Silently, clinging to the rocky
         wall on their right, they went in single file along the ledge, till the wall opened and they turned into a little steep-walled
         bay, grassy-floored, still and quiet. Its entrance which they had found could not be seen from below because of the overhang
         of the cliff, nor from further off because it was so small that it looked like a dark crack and no more. It was not a cave
         and was open to the sky above; but at its inner end a flat wall rose up that in the lower part, close to the ground, was as
         smooth and upright as masons’ work, but without a joint or crevice to be seen. No sign was there of post or lintel or threshold, nor any sign of bar or bolt or key-hole; yet they did
         not doubt that they had found the door at last."|"The Hobbit"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"
00:00|midnight|"Nor did he. Balin was overjoyed to see the hobbit again, and as delighted as he was surprised. He picked Bilbo up and carried
         him out into the open air. It was midnight and clouds had covered the stars, but Bilbo lay with his eyes shut, gasping and
         taking pleasure in the feel of the fresh air again, and hardly noticing the excitement of the dwarves, or how they praised
         him and patted him on the back and put themselves and all their families for generations to come at his service."|"The Hobbit"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"
12:00|noon|"“Now I will make you an offer. I have got my ring and will creep down this very noon—then if ever Smaug ought to be napping—and
         see what he is up to. Perhaps something will turn up. ‘Every worm has his weak spot,’ as my father used to say, though I am
         sure it was not from personal experience.”"|"The Hobbit"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"
12:00|midday|"Naturally the dwarves accepted the offer eagerly. Already they had come to respect little Bilbo. Now he had become the real
         leader in their adventure. He had begun to have ideas and plans of his own. When midday came he got ready for another journey
         down into the Mountain. He did not like it of course, but it was not so bad now he knew, more or less, what was in front of
         him. Had he known more about dragons and their wily ways, he might have been more frightened and less hopeful of catching this one napping."|"The Hobbit"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"
00:00|midnight|"“Look!” said one. “The lights again! Last night the watchmen saw them start and fade from midnight until dawn. Something is
         happening up there.”"|"The Hobbit"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"
00:00|midnight|"“I daresay; but I am bound here till midnight,” grumbled the fat dwarf. “A sorry business altogether. Not that I venture to
         disagree with Thorin, may his beard grow ever longer; yet he was ever a dwarf with a stiff neck.”"|"The Hobbit"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"
00:00|midnight|"“Off you go!” said Bilbo. “I will wake you at midnight, and you can wake the next watchman.”"|"The Hobbit"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"
00:00|midnight|"“Thank you very much I am sure,” said Bilbo with a bow. “But I don’t think I ought to leave my friends like this, after all
         we have gone through together. And I promised to wake old Bombur at midnight, too! Really I must be going, and quickly.”"|"The Hobbit"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"
"<< 00:00"|"well before midnight"|"Puzzled but cheered, Bilbo hurried on. He was guided to a safe ford and set across dry, and then he said farewell to the elves
         and climbed carefully back towards the Gate. Great weariness began to come over him; but it was well before midnight when
         he clambered up the rope again—it was still where he had left it. He untied it and hid it, and then he sat down on the wall
         and wondered anxiously what would happen next."|"The Hobbit"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"
00:00|midnight|"At midnight he woke up Bombur; and then in turn rolled himself up in his corner, without listening to the old dwarf’s thanks
         (which he felt he had hardly earned). He was soon fast asleep forgetting all his worries till the morning. As a matter of
         fact he was dreaming of eggs and bacon."|"The Hobbit"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"
"~ 12:00"|"About midday"|"About midday the banners of the Forest and the Lake were seen to be borne forth again. A company of twenty was approaching.
         At the beginning of the narrow way they laid aside sword and spear, and came on towards the Gate. Wondering, the dwarves saw
         that among them were both Bard and the Elvenking, before whom an old man wrapped in cloak and hood bore a strong casket of
         iron-bound wood."|"The Hobbit"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"
12:00|noon|"“Not so hasty!” said Bard. “We will give you until tomorrow. At noon we will return, and see if you have brought from the
         hoard the portion that is to be set against the stone. If that is done without deceit, then we will depart, and the elf-host
         will go back to the Forest. In the meanwhile farewell!”"|"The Hobbit"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"
"ap 04:00"|four|"“If ever you are passing my way,” said Bilbo, “don’t wait to knock! Tea is at four; but any of you are welcome at any time!”"|"The Hobbit"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"If he was surprised, they were more surprised still. He had arrived back in the middle of an auction! There was a large notice
         in black and red hung on the gate, stating that on June the Twenty-second Messrs Grubb, Grubb, and Burrowes would sell by
         auction the effects of the late Bilbo Baggins Esquire, of Bag-End, Underhill, Hobbiton. Sale to commence at ten o’clock sharp.
         It was now nearly lunchtime, and most of the things had already been sold, for various prices from next to nothing to old
         songs (as is not unusual at auctions). Bilbo’s cousins the Sackville-Bagginses were, in fact, busy measuring his rooms to
         see if their own furniture would fit. In short Bilbo was “Presumed Dead”, and not everybody that said so was sorry to find
         the presumption wrong."|"The Hobbit"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"
"ap 10:30"|"half past ten"|"“My dear fellow,” said he, “whenever are you going to come? What about an early start?—and here you are having breakfast, or whatever you call it, at half past ten! They left you the message, because they could
         not wait.”"|"The Hobbit"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"
11:00|"11 a.m."|"“Thinking it unnecessary to disturb your esteemed repose, we have proceeded in advance to make requisite preparations, and
         shall await your respected person at the Green Dragon Inn, Bywater, at 11 a.m. sharp. Trusting that you will be punctual,"|"The Hobbit"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"Very puffed he was, when he got to Bywater just on the stroke of eleven, and found he had come without a pocket-handkerchief!"|"The Hobbit"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"
12:00|mid-day|"Long days after they had climbed out of the valley and left the Last Homely House miles behind, they were still going up and
     up and up. It was a hard path and a dangerous path, a crooked way and a lonely and a long. Now they could look back over the
     lands they had left, laid out behind them far below. Far, far away in the West, where things were blue and faint, Bilbo knew
     there lay his own country of safe and comfortable things, and his little hobbit-hole. He shivered. It was getting bitter cold
     up here, and the wind came shrill among the rocks. Boulders, too, at times came galloping down the mountain-sides, let loose
     by mid-day sun upon the snow, and passed among them (which was lucky), or over their heads (which was alarming). The nights
     were comfortless and chill, and they did not dare to sing or talk too loud, for the echoes were uncanny, and the silence seemed
     to dislike being broken—except by the noise of water and the wail of wind and the crack of stone."|"The Hobbit"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"
"ap 01:00"|one|"Now you can understand why Gandalf, listening to their growling and yelping, began to be dreadfully afraid, wizard though
         he was, and to feel that they were in a very bad place, and had not yet escaped at all. All the same he was not going to let
         them have it all their own way, though he could not do very much stuck up in a tall tree with wolves all round on the ground below. He gathered the huge pine-cones from the branches of the tree. Then he set one alight with bright blue fire,
         and threw it whizzing down among the circle of the wolves. It struck one on the back, and immediately his shaggy coat caught
         fire, and he was leaping to and fro yelping horribly. Then another came and another, one in blue flames, one in red, another
         in green. They burst on the ground in the middle of the circle and went off in coloured sparks and smoke. A specially large
         one hit the chief wolf on the nose, and he leaped in the air ten feet, and then rushed round and round the circle biting and
         snapping even at the other wolves in his anger and fright."|"The Hobbit"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"
"> 12:00"|"after midday"|"All that morning they were busy with preparations. Soon after midday they ate with Beorn for the last time, and after the
         meal they mounted the steeds he was lending them, and bidding him many farewells they rode off through his gate at a good
         pace."|"The Hobbit"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"
12:00|noon|"Still the next morning dawned bright and fair again. There was an autumn-like mist white upon the ground and the air was chill, but soon the sun rose red in the East and the mists vanished, and while the shadows were still
         long they were off again. So they rode now for two more days, and all the while they saw nothing save grass and flowers and
         birds and scattered trees, and occasionally small herds of red deer browsing or sitting at noon in the shade. Sometimes Bilbo
         saw the horns of the harts sticking up out of the long grass, and at first he thought they were the dead branches of trees.
         That third evening they were so eager to press on, for Beorn had said that they should reach the forest-gate early on the
         fourth-day, that they rode still forward after dusk and into the night beneath the moon. As the light faded Bilbo thought
         he saw away to the right, or to the left, the shadowy form of a great bear prowling along in the same direction. But if he
         dared to mention it to Gandalf, the wizard only said: “Hush! Take no notice!”"|"The Hobbit"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"
00:00|midnight|"He had picked his way stealthily for some distance, when he noticed a place of dense black shadow ahead of him, black even
         for that forest, like a patch of midnight that had never been cleared away. As he drew nearer, he saw that it was made by
         spider-webs one behind and over and tangled with another. Suddenly he saw, too, that there were spiders huge and horrible
         sitting in the branches above him, and ring or no ring he trembled with fear lest they should discover him. Standing behind
         a tree he watched a group of them for some time, and then in the silence and stillness of the wood he realised that these
         loathsome creatures were speaking one to another. Their voices were a sort of thin creaking and hissing, but he could make
         out many of the words that they said. They were talking about the dwarves!"|"The Hobbit"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"
