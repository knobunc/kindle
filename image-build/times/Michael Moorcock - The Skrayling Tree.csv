"ap 02:58"|"two before three"|"The swirl of the sea had a new quality I couldn’t identify. There was even a different note to a light wind from the west.
         I mentioned it to Ulric. Half asleep, enjoying his brandy and soda, he smiled. It was the action of Auld Strom, the avenging
         hag, he said. Hadn’t I read the guide? The Old Woman was the local English name for the unpredictable bore, a twisting, vicious
         current which ran between the dozens of little islands in the Sound and could sometimes turn into a dangerous whirlpool. The
         French called her Le Chaudron Noir, the black cauldron. Small whaling ships had been dragged down in the nineteenth century,
         and only a year or two before three vacationing schoolgirls in a canoe had disappeared into the maelstrom. Neither they nor
         their canoe had ever been recovered."|"The Skrayling Tree"|"Michael Moorcock"

         silver. I followed Klosterheim with my eyes as far as I could, but he was soon hidden in the brushy shadows."|"The Skrayling Tree"|"Michael Moorcock"
"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"The wind came back before noon and blustered at us from every angle, as if trying to uproot us from our uneasy balance on
         the mountain face and hurl us into valleys now entirely obscured by thick, pale cloud. We kept our gloved fingers tight in
         the cracks of the rock face and took no chances, advancing step by careful step."|"The Skrayling Tree"|"Michael Moorcock"
12:00|noon|"By noon we had yet to see a sign of White Crow. Bes kept moving steadily towards the mountains, following the gentle curves
         of the landscape. Sometimes we could see for miles across the rolling drumlins. At other times we traveled through shallow
         valleys. Occasionally Bes paused, lifting her wide, curving tusks against the sky, her relatively small ears moving to follow
         a sound. Satisfied, she would then move on."|"The Skrayling Tree"|"Michael Moorcock"
12:00|midday|"We sighted Las Cascadas at midday, approaching her from the harbor side. At first the island fortress was like a mirage, a
         series of silver veins twinkling in the sunlight. Then it became clear those veins ran down the sides of cliffs formed by
         the crater of an enormous volcano. There were no evident signs of a harbor entrance, only the still lagoon within. It seemed
         to me that this mysterious island could only be occupied from the air or from below, and such supernatural forces were no
         longer summonable."|"The Skrayling Tree"|"Michael Moorcock"
