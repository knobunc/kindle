"ap 10:11"|10-11|"“An engaging, down-to-the-minute retelling of May 10-11, 1941 . . . Part military history, part chronicle of survivors’ memories, and part moving tribute to London, the result is reminiscent of Richard Collier’s The City That Would Not Die, but is a captivating and important contribution in its own right. True to his journalistic roots, Mortimer opens by introducing a large cast of characters, most of whom he personally interviewed. The experiences of those who were in and around London that fateful night drive the narrative. . . . Mortimer offers great insight into the intricacies of World War II London, its population, physical layout, architecture, and history, as well as the complexities of German and British warplanes and weaponry of the period."|"The Longest Night"|"Gavin Mortimer"

On Woolwich Arsenal, the country’s largest munitions factory, and then on the docks that proliferated along  the banks of the Thames. But this was a day not just for military and industrial targets, this was a special day. Saturday, September 7, 1940, was the day Hitler had chosen to launch his attack on the British people. This was the beginning of the Blitz. Bombs spewed out of aircraft and fell with murderous intensity on London’s East End. People in the boroughs of East Ham and West Ham, in Stepney and Poplar and in Whitechapel, died easily in the later summer sunshine. There were 430 dead as night edged in, and elsewhere across London people watched with bemusement: Why, they asked each other, was the sun setting in the east as well as the west?

It was shortly after eight o’clock on the morning of May 10, 1941, but Jeschonnek didn’t apologize. Hitler had been on the phone from his summer residence in Berchtesgaden. He wanted London bombed, tonight.  The RAF attacks on Bremen and Hamburg must not be allowed to go unanswered. Jeschonnek passed the message to Sperrle, reminding him that the bombers of Feldmarschall Kesselring’s Air Fleet Two were at his disposal, as Kesselring was in Poland. The telephone call was brief.

Multiplied by eight, and each Heinkel that taxied down the grassy L-shaped runway at Vannes was carrying 1,152 incendiary bombs. The canisters had all been preselected, which meant once they were over their target the navigator (also the bomb aimer in a Heinkel) wouldn’t have to concern himself with selecting the time interval for release. Once he pressed the bomb release button one canister would fall every fifty meters.

Stepney was already burning well. “Left, hard left,” he said, as if he were giving directions on an afternoon punt on the river. A large building caught his eye. A warehouse. His thumb pressed down on the button with precise calmness. “Bomb gone.” The 1,000-kilogram bomb hurtled toward Stepney with the electrical charge running through into the two spring-loaded plungers. As it fell at 500 miles per hour the charge went into a resistor, down into a condenser, into another resistor, and stopped at the firing condenser. Seconds after leaving the Heinkel the 1,000-kilogram bomb landed on Stepney; the impact activated a trembler switch, which made the contact, which fired the gaine, which detonated the bomb.

Two months earlier he’d requested a “water supply and hose for the chapel roof . . . 20 stirrup pumps, ladders, 40 buckets and also [water] tanks and sandbags.” None of these requests had been granted on May 6, prompting the archbishop to issue a fierce rebuke to the Civil Defense.

It was either a gross error of judgment by the bomb aimer or an attempt to lighten their load and shake off a British night fighter. The bomb landed in the back garden of 183 Keith Road. John and Selina Curtis and their three children, Alf, Elsie, and John, as well as their daughter-in-law, Ethel, still enjoying a family knees-up, were all killed.

At about 12:45 a.m. they changed their minds. Gathering up some blankets, the three of them left their house, walked along Clement’s Road, and turned right into Keeton’s Road. They quickened their step. The uneven drone of the bomber’s engine grew louder. They broke into a trot. The aircraft seemed right above them. They started running as fast as they could. They reached the gate to the shelter. Two security guards jumped in front of them. “Stop there! Stop there!” they yelled. Gladys heard a “strange whizzing sound, it wasn’t a whistle.” The bomb dropped on top of the shelter. The lucky ones were those killed instantly, blown apart or their lungs shattered by the blast. The unlucky ones were those like Gladys’s friend Tom Gill (surname changed at Gladys Jenner’s request). He had returned on leave hoping to go to the pictures, but as all his friends were spending the night in the shelter he’d come along to catch up on all the gossip. “We stayed in the gatehouse,”  remembers Gladys. “The security men all knew my dad so they made us tea and told us to wait with them but we could hear what was going on.” They heard the clangor of bells and they heard the shrieks of the dying. “Amid all the screaming I remember hearing Tom’s pleas, ‘Let me die,’ he was saying, ‘I know what’s happened to me. Please let me die.’ Rescue workers dug through the rubble with their hands, looking for his legs.”"|"The Longest Night"|"Gavin Mortimer"

Even a hard-boiled American journalist and a ditzy Hollywood actress were shocked by the enormity of what lay before them. This was one of England’s greatest churches. It was on this spot that Danish Vikings had married their English women in the ninth century. Christopher Wren had erected the church in 1680, with its oak pillars crowned with cherubs and its stalls carved with angels. Dr. Johnson had worshipped under its lead roof and he was depicted on the stained glass windows along with Boswell, Goldsmith, Burke, and the Cockney flower girls who for centuries had sold posies of violets outside the church.

Bombs from the same canister also dropped onto the roof of the red-brick neo-Gothic library, illuminating with their white-blue flames the immaculate lawns of the Inn below. Inside the library were 70,000 law books and the ghosts of seven prime ministers, from Robert Walpole to Herbert Asquith. “It was quite tricky to get up onto the roof,” says Lew. “It wasn’t that high but we had to get up over the battlements and chimney stacks onto a flat ledge.” They maneuvered the turntable ladder into position, avoiding the big bay windows, and “ran up the ladder onto the roof carrying buckets of sand to put on the incendiaries.” Lew remembers that there was a discussion about whether to rig up a pulley to get the sand up on the roof or to continue doing it manually. “But we didn’t have enough men or enough time to do that. There was only one pump at the library because the rest were fighting other fires. We just knew that we had to put those ruddy incendiaries out because once they take hold, that’s it.”"|"The Longest Night"|"Gavin Mortimer"

As more bombs fell, the Inn’s head porter, Mr. Ivey, directed his firewatchers toward the static water tanks sunk into the Inn’s terrace. A sergeant-major in the Coldstream Guards during the first war, Ivey was delighted to be back in action. With calm authority he led a charge toward the demented flames engulfing the east side of the South Square along Gray’s Inn Road. They kept charging until the water in the static tanks ran dry. Then Ivey ordered his men to fill buckets from the hot water taps in the Robing Room, and he fortified them with mugs of cider drawn from a cask in the cellar under the hall. But their courage was to no avail. By 3 a.m. the chapel with its small glazed turret had burned to the ground. The hall followed, 347 years after Shakespeare’s  Comedy of Errors had been performed there, and in the library all that remained of 32,000 books was a towering pile of ashes."|"The Longest Night"|"Gavin Mortimer"

At the Cherry Garden Pier, a few hundred yards west of the Redriff Estate, HMS Tower, the base ship of the Royal Navy Auxiliary Patrol, whose job it was to defend the Thames, was holed by a high-explosive bomb. The dead and wounded littered her decks as she sunk into the glutinous mud of the river.

Incendiaries plopped and hissed and sizzled and pursued him down the road. “I thought to myself, ‘I’ve had enough of this’ and I started to trot down the road.” Joe turned right and made his way into Hillingdon Street just behind Walworth Road. “My cousins lived there and they had a decent shelter made out of concrete which I thought would be safe.” Joe banged on the front door but there was no answer. “I went into the backyard and looked around but there was no one there so I went back onto the street and ducked into one of the street shelters in John Ruskin Street.”"|"The Longest Night"|"Gavin Mortimer"

It was 3 a.m. and his 3.7-inch AA gun had fired scores of rounds at aircraft whose range he and his crew detected by their crude Mark I radars. Behind them were piled thirty wooden boxes, each one containing two more twenty-eight-pound shells. The ground all around was knee deep in empty shell cases, smoke still rising from those just fired. All the time three bombardiers kept up a steady flow of fresh ammunition to replace the shells being fired. “We’d fired so many rounds that the paint had burned off the barrels,” recalls Bill. “But at least the gun’s hydraulic oil hadn’t boiled out which sometimes happened.” The loader shoved the next shell in the breech with his leather mittens. It was punched up automatically and then fired. “You wouldn’t know if you’d brought down a plane,” says Bill, “because there were so many people firing you didn’t know who’d hit what.” Sometimes they fired and “a Very light would burst, which was an identification from one of our night fighters.” The gunners muttered darkly about the Brylcreem boys thousands of feet above them. “The RAF were a bloody nuisance at times,” reflects Bill. “A target came into view and then one of our fighters would come buzzing after it.”"|"The Longest Night"|"Gavin Mortimer"

It had been terribly exciting at first for Madeleine Henrey and her Old Etonian husband, Robert, camped in the corner of their flat with their baby between them listening to incendiaries clattering onto the cobbled streets of Shepherd Market. They had “done their bit” chasing incendiaries along with the wardens and firewatchers and other residents. Everyone was pulling their weight, remembered Madeleine, even Shepherd Market’s prostitutes, whose towering heels caught in the cobbles as “still with fur coats [they] ran hither and thither with pitchers of water.” An incendiary landed on a draper’s store and soon wardens were climbing in through the smashed shopfront to salvage what they could. “Dozens of boxes of silk stockings and newly delivered lingerie were piled under an archway,” recalled Madeleine, “but as courtesans returned with their pitchers the boxes disappeared as if by magic.” Soon the fire had spread to Sunderland House, a grandiose building all crystal chandeliers and Chippendale furniture, built by the American industrialist William K. Vanderbilt as a wedding present to his daughter when she married the Duke of Marlborough. As the flames swarmed over the house a firewatcher howled in helpless fury, “This building is doomed! It was built on consecrated ground, on the site of May Fair Chapel!” Madeleine glared at the man with French disdain. “This philosophical outburst in the face of so much danger staggered me for it was clear that soon the building would become a raging blaze.” Seeing this particular fight was lost Madeleine returned to check on her baby. As she did she “saw a young woman, Winifred Berry, who lived in our block of flats, calmly painting the scene from her sitting-room window.”"|"The Longest Night"|"Gavin Mortimer"

In the control room of 22 Station in Burdett Road, Florrie Jenkins was matted with dust “that had come through the ventilation shaft of the control room.” Throughout the night she and the other firewomen had remained at their desks logging calls against a backdrop of violent thuds, some more distant than others. “A couple of times bombs dropped so close the whole building shook and the discs on the board that represented our engines fell onto the floor.” Florrie picked up the discs and tried to remember which number went on which hook. She returned to her desk and told herself her old mum was fine, probably curled up in her bed in Coutts Road, just round the corner from the fire station. Then shortly before dawn her mobilizing officer, Mr. Nash, took Florrie to one side. “I think you better pop home,” he told her, “some stuff has come down on Coutts Road.” Florrie flew out of the station. The blue police box on the corner had taken a direct hit and several of the shops on the other side of the road were gutted by fire. Florrie started up Burdett Road but at the top a police cordon  barred her way. “Sorry, love,” a policeman told her, “there’s a UXB in Coutts Road.” “So I went back down Burdett Road and tried to get to my house that way,” says Florrie. “But there was another cordon at the bottom. By this time I couldn’t care less about the police so I went under the cordon and into Coutts Road.

It was just before 7:30 a.m. as he headed west up Fleet Street. “I hardly met a soul,” he told his daughter in a letter, “except long convoys of AFS mobile water units.” He encountered one other journalist, Paul Mitchell, a fellow Australian working for the Sydney Morning Herald. “He said ‘you ought to see Aldywych and Catherine Street just near the Waldorf [Hotel].’” Hughes hurried on to Catherine Street, where he stared in disbelief at a “hole about 50ft wide and 20ft deep.” “Opposite Australia House a big building, Accident & General, was on fire and all the roadway was impassable with huge blocks of masonry. On the other side at the corner of Norfolk Street and the Strand, a big building had been hit by a H.E. and had fallen into the road. That horrible death mask mark (as I always call it) of a big bomb—a pall of horrible dirty-looking dust—hung over everything.”"|"The Longest Night"|"Gavin Mortimer"

I studied the great tower where the world famous clock strikes the hours . . . it was just on eight o’clock. As the hour hand crept on to the figure eight there wasn’t a sound. Big Ben, for the first time since the war, had been reduced to silence by the Hun at last!”"|"The Longest Night"|"Gavin Mortimer"

St. Thomas’s Hospital was ablaze, the livid colour of the sky extended from Lambeth to St. Paul’s, flames were visible all along the Embankment, there was smoke rising thickly  as far as the eye could see. After no previous raid has London looked so wounded the next day.” Colville returned home, breakfasted, “then rang up the P.M. at Ditchley and described what I had seen.

A crew arrived after an arduous journey through the night from Oxford, guided every step of the way by the flames over London. They were too late to save the church or the Inner Temple library or hall. Lamb Building, too, was beyond redemption. Residents attempted to rescue what they could from the offices still threatened by the flames. In the treasury office the subtreasurer, Roy Robinson, and his wife removed fittings and furniture. “I found my  husband struggling to remove a picture from the wall,” recalled Mrs. Robinson. “I said, ‘Well, he’s dead anyway and it is no use killing yourself to save him.’ In spite of this I think the picture was saved.”"|"The Longest Night"|"Gavin Mortimer"

More canteen vans flooded into the City now, dishing out food and hot drinks to the dazed firemen. Reinvigorated, the firemen renewed their efforts but the fires wanted Faraday House. On one of the fireboats anchored in the Thames below Queen Victoria Street they were pumping water up from the river and feeding it to the firemen on the shore through their hose. That in itself had been a bitter struggle, a duel against the dark clotted mud revealed at low tide on the Thames. One of the firemen, Dick Helyer, remembered that “you had to get your hose to the water’s edge, try to get it over the mud and have a line to give it to the chaps on the shore to pull it ashore, but the mud used to come up to our knees and you had a hell of a job.”"|"The Longest Night"|"Gavin Mortimer"

Trees and hedges were festooned with articles of clothing blown out of homes. Quentin Reynolds had finished surveying the ruins; now he watched deadpan Londoners sifting through the detritus of their city. Gone, he noticed, was the complacency so evident during the autumn of 1940, the “We can take it, Jerry” bravado that had captured the imagination of the American journalists. “I walked around the still burning streets of London on Sunday morning,” he wrote to his readers. “The streets were filled with grim-faced, sullen-looking men and women. They were through ‘taking it.’ They wanted to give it. Every bomb that the Nazis dropped during the night carried germs with it—germs of hatred. I could feel the hatred rising from the ruins infecting everyone. Tight-lipped men and women stared at the debris of treasured landmarks and you could feel the hatred of Nazi barbarism emanating from them.”"|"The Longest Night"|"Gavin Mortimer"

Musicians from the London Philharmonic Orchestra arrived at the stage door early in the morning for a 10 a.m. rehearsal of the Summer Concert scheduled for the afternoon. “There’ll be no rehearsal here this morning,” the hallkeeper told them. One of the musicians, a horn player, asked about the instruments. “They’ll be ashes by now,” replied the hallkeeper. A cellist said he would see for himself and moved toward the door. “You can’t,” the hallkeeper told him. “It’s a blazing red-hot furnace at the end of the passage.” Instead the cellist gave a fiddler a leg up through a window. He disappeared inside and returned a few minutes later with “a scorched leather case.” It was claimed by a horn player, who opened the case and took out his French horn. “I’ll fix it up and see if it works,” he said. “I bet it’s as good as it ever was.” He played a few notes from Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony, First Movement. “Never say die!” he declared, grinning at his colleagues. The rest of the orchestra foraged through the litter of their instruments. Cedric Sharp took away the corpse of his £600 cello, determined to restore it, but the magnificent Italian double bass of Adolf Lotter, the London Symphony Orchestra’s principal, was a chunk of charred wood and strings. One of them took a sign from the caretaker’s office and hung it on one of the entrance doors: “All seats sold out.”"|"The Longest Night"|"Gavin Mortimer"

For months they had filled their bathtubs early each evening with the regulation five inches, a private reservoir for just such an emergency. In Hackney and Peckham and Paddington the water mains had run dry; in Bermondsey, too, where Gladys Jenner and her mother had returned to their home in Clement’s Road. “We’d stayed in the guardhouse until the all clear went,” she recalls. “Then they told us to go home and get our heads down for a few hours.” The old tub was in the scullery and the hot water of the previous night was now as chilly as the outside temperature. With no gas to heat a saucepan of water, Gladys doused herself with cold water. “We had some breakfast and then at around 10 a.m. we began to hear reports from last night from friends.”"|"The Longest Night"|"Gavin Mortimer"

Perhaps she hadn’t scrambled over the wall to douse a livid incendiary in her neighbor’s garden. “The events of the previous night seemed as incredible as the fantasies of a nightmare,” she told herself. Then the phone rang; it was a friend checking she was all right.

In some ways I was more apprehensive and frightened waiting for her to answer than I was fighting fires. My imagination began to run riot if she didn’t pick the phone up straight away.” Lew’s wife and two-year-old son were safe in Willsden. “In fact, they didn’t have a clue about the extent of the damage because that part of north London hardly got hit. They could just see these big black clouds over the center and asked what they were. I just told them we’d had a bit of excitement last night.” Wembley had enjoyed a peaceful night’s sleep and now wondered why the papers were late. In the south of the city a couple out for a morning constitutional on Streatham Common chased scraps of burned paper as they fluttered from the sky. “The paper was falling until midday,” one of them wrote in her diary. “The Common looked like Hampstead Heath after a Bank Holiday and it was the same as far as Morden and Epsom.”"|"The Longest Night"|"Gavin Mortimer"

There had been no rehearsal and the musicians were playing borrowed instruments but that didn’t matter. The audience needed music to balm their wounded psyche.
