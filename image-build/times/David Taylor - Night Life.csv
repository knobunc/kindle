"~ 00:00"|"around midnight"|"“Give it a chance. He always hits around midnight. It’s quarter to.” Cassidy was an impatient man who was trying to teach himself how to wait. He was shorter than his partner, broad shouldered and strong, but whip thin as if the motor running inside consumed everything as it entered."|"Night Life"|"David Taylor"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"“Yeah, I’m sure.” Holden flicked his cigarette toward the ashtray on Cassidy’s desk, and missed. He was a stocky man in his midforties with a five o’clock shadow that was dark an hour before its appointed time."|"Night Life"|"David Taylor"
"ap 04:51"|nine-to-five|"The big circular bar at Toots Shor’s was packed three deep. Saloon noise—the laughter, the shouted talk, the rattle of ice in glasses—and saloon smoke always lifted Cassidy. He and Orso shouldered to a place at the bar and Al, the bartender, brought him a heavy pour of Jack Daniel’s and Orso a martini without asking. You did not go to Toots Shor’s for the food. You could get a decent steak and baked potato, a lobster, a chop, or oysters if you wanted them, but Toots Shor’s was a watering hole. You came to Shor’s to drink. A couple of pops on the way home from the office, or after dinner at a restaurant with clients, then to Toots’s to round out the evening. It was a place for sportswriters and reporters, for Hemingway, Ruark, and other literary boozers, for Yankees and Giants when the teams were playing home games, for fighters from the Garden a few blocks over, for actors and wiseguys, and for businessmen who had surrendered to the nine-to-five but were still trying to hold on to some part of who they had planned to be in their dangerous hours. Women were allowed, but if a man showed up with his wife too many times, the frost was obvious and he had a hard time getting served. Showgirls, models, secretaries got some slack, but it was a man’s world."|"Night Life"|"David Taylor"
10:00|"ten in the morning"|"Members of the subcommittee sat behind a hedge of microphones at a long table that faced another long table where those called would sit to face their inquisitors. Aides leaned over the shoulders of the committee members and pointed out crucial passages in papers the august men shuffled importantly for the cameras. Senator McCarthy sat at the table’s middle. He had the heavy, florid face of a drinker, and even at ten in the morning his beard was dark. His dark, thinning hair was oiled to his skull, and his suit was rumpled. Roy Cohn sat at his shoulder and looked out over the crowd with his heavy lidded, empty eyes."|"Night Life"|"David Taylor"
"ap > 08:00"|"after eight"|"Cassidy stood back as a woman in a white mink coat came out of the Copacabana. He and the doorman watched in admiration as she stilted up 60th Street on impossibly high heels. He went in and nodded to the bartender and stopped near the maître d’s desk at the entrance to the dining room. It was after eight and the big room was three-quarters filled with men in tuxedos and women in evening dresses and jewelry listening to Harry Belafonte in his early set in front of a small orchestra. The cigarette girl was making a delivery to a table near the door. She saw Cassidy and winked and then bent over just enough so the man buying cigarettes could appreciate the view down her top. She thanked him for the tip and then swayed toward Cassidy. She was dressed as an island beauty, a flowered sarong around her hips, and fake fruit held in her hair by a bright bandana. Her lips were glossy and as red as blood. “Hi, Michael. Long time, no see.”"|"Night Life"|"David Taylor"
00:00|midnight|"“How are you, Francie?”
“I’m as good as they get. And I’m off at midnight.”
Jules Podell, the manager, appeared at Cassidy’s elbow. Podell was a sleepy-eyed thug in an expensive tuxedo. “Francie, there’s a guy on table six trying to get your attention.”"|"Night Life"|"David Taylor"
"ap 05:09"|"five nine"|"Bonner was built like a bulldozer, five nine, two hundred and ten pounds, square, low to the ground, indestructible. His head was a block with mismatched eyes, one blue, one hazel, a small nose, a thick-lipped mouth, and fine white hair buzzed short. He had the look of someone who had been slapped together from spare parts. He had put in his twenty more than five years ago, but everyone knew Alfie Bonner would be a cop till something or someone killed him."|"Night Life"|"David Taylor"

He wanted to get this done, and another guy in the mix would cancel it for the night. The bartender asked him for the third time if he wanted another, so he ordered a refill that he didn’t want, and that pissed him off too. He left it half finished and went out and watched Amado from the street. Amado gave up at ten, and Fraker tailed him home and then broke into a panel truck parked among other panel trucks in a vacant lot off Christopher Street and watched Amado’s building until everyone settled in for the night. An occasional taxi went by, but it was late and there was little traffic. After midnight the waiters and cooks left the restaurant on the corner and walked east toward the subway station at West 4th carrying brown bags of leftover food and talking softly in Spanish."|"Night Life"|"David Taylor"

Dylan poured rum from the pint in her leather bag into their coffee. A couple of late-shift cabbies played gin rummy at one of the red Formica tables in the back while a third read the bulldog edition of the Daily News. A young drunk in a rumpled tuxedo with wine stains on his ruffled shirt quietly sang Cole Porter songs to his date, a pretty girl in a dark blue silk dress who slept openmouthed with her head cradled on her arms."|"Night Life"|"David Taylor"
"ap 02:30"|"two thirty"|"Three days of rain, and then the sun came out. Cassidy found May Stiles in her office, a booth in the coffee shop across the street from the Cortland Hotel. She was dressed in a gray linen business suit with red accents. Her makeup was perfect, and her blond hair was held back with tortoiseshell clips that matched her glasses. She looked like the middle-aged businesswoman she was, but there was little chance she would be mentioned in Forbes or BusinessWeek. A glass of iced tea sweated onto a folded napkin. There was a telephone at her elbow on the Formica tabletop. She held the receiver against her ear with her shoulder while she leafed through a small black notebook. Cassidy waited while she finished the call. “I’m sorry, Mr. Smith, Claudine isn’t available today. She has classes. Lorette would be happy to accommodate you in the usual way.” A cigarette bobbed at the corner of her mouth while she talked. She raised her eyebrows at Cassidy and offered the other side of the booth with a nod. Cassidy slid in. “How about Alana? She speaks of you very highly. Fine, then. Alana at two thirty. The usual arrangements.” She cut off the call with her finger, then let the button up and dialed. “How’re you doing, Cassidy?” Someone answered the phone. “Sweetie? That guy Smith. The one with the funny dick. Two thirty. Room six oh one. Key’s at the desk.” She hung up and made a note in her book, and then looked up at Cassidy. “What’s up? I see that shit Franklin’s back on the job. I wish you’d been on the sixth floor that night.”"|"Night Life"|"David Taylor"
12:00|midday|"Cassidy studied the Maxfield Parrish mural on the wall of the King Cole Bar of the St. Regis Hotel and sipped a Bloody Mary. Old King Cole didn’t look particularly merry, but maybe Parrish had caught him on a bad day. There were only a few other midday drinkers, four businessmen at a table calling for another round, a solitary hunched over a martini at the end of the bar, and three out-of-town women surrounded by shopping bags, drinking mimosas and showing each other the loot from their store raids along Fifth Avenue. Leah arrived ten minutes late and slipped onto the stool next to him. She leaned to kiss him on the cheek and ordered a whiskey sour."|"Night Life"|"David Taylor"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"“Hey, you don’t know Frank. When he wants something, he gets it done. I want you to stop by rehearsal, let everyone know I’m okay. It would be good if you could stick around and watch the eleven o’clock number. I don’t know if it’s right. I like the song, but I don’t know. It doesn’t seem to fire. Go take a look. Tell me what you think.”"|"Night Life"|"David Taylor"
10:00|"ten in the morning"|"Lieutenant Tanner came up the stairs and into the squad room. Uncharacteristically, he wore a suit and his tie was pulled up tight under his collar, and he looked more weary and harassed than a man should at ten in the morning. “Cassidy, Orso, in my office, please.”"|"Night Life"|"David Taylor"

Cassidy pushed his way through the crowd toward the door and then stopped in the shadows among the tables when he saw his father at the bar. He was with a group of four people who were laughing at something he said, and unless she had turned into a twenty-five-year-old blonde, his mother was not the woman with her hand in his father’s pants pocket. He could tell they were theater people. Their clothes were tailored beyond the edge of fashion, hair longer than most, laughter louder, gestures and faces animated to reach the back of the house. So, what now? Out through the kitchen the way Billie Holiday had gone, catch a cab, home in ten minutes, and no one the wiser. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Stick it to him. See the surprise. See the guilt. The whiskey daring him."|"Night Life"|"David Taylor"

He walked south two blocks, and the only car he saw was a taxi that slowed hopefully and then went on when he made no gesture. The lobbies of the big apartment buildings were lighted, and uniformed doormen dozed in leather chairs behind brass-fitted doors. He turned east and found Susdorf and Cherry sitting on the granite stoop of a town house. They both showed the resentful air of men who had been pulled from sleep. Susdorf nodded. Cherry sneered."|"Night Life"|"David Taylor"

Cassidy lit his fortieth cigarette of the day. It burned his mouth and throat, and he stubbed it out. He scrubbed his face with the flat of his hand, but it did nothing to chase his tiredness.

A set malfunctioned, or maybe an actress, or maybe he lost track of time, it was never clear, but he missed the appointment.

"ap 03:00"|three|"For reasons he still did not understand, Cassidy moved the clock to the bureau where it could not be seen from the bed, and in doing so changed what his mother had done from an act of optimism to one of despair, and in some ways he let his father off the hook, because Tom Cassidy never suspected Joan’s calibrations, never knew that by being on time he could have changed death into life. The coroner’s estimate of her time of death was imprecise, which allowed Tom Cassidy to believe that she had killed herself early in the afternoon so that he would find her dead when he came at three. He did not understand that she meant to seduce him. He assumed that she had killed herself to punish him and had arranged for him to find her body."|"Night Life"|"David Taylor"

The interior was dim, and Cassidy waited inside the door until his eyes adjusted. The music stopped a moment after he came in, so he knew someone had hit the button to warn the men dancing together in the back room to break it up. There was a city ordinance against people of the same sex dancing, a law for the most part ignored but kept on the books in case a raid on a queer bar was needed at election time to reassure the good citizens that deviance would not be tolerated. He moved to the bar, ignoring the men past the arch at the far side of the room who now stood talking together in the awkward poses of people surprised in the act. It was six o’clock, and the place was filling up with men from the midtown office buildings. They wore suits and ties and buttoned-down shirts, polished wingtips, the gray flannel uniform of the day. Camouflage. It was tough being queer in America. Maybe in the arts you could get away with it, but otherwise you had to live a clandestine life and present a false front to the world. If you were found out, it would destroy you. You would lose everything, job, friends, family. It was worse than being a Communist."|"Night Life"|"David Taylor"
