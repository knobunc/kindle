"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"Sometimes there was a compulsion which drew Ira Claffey from his plantation and sent him to walk the forest.

The long-leaved pines themselves, their banks of dark green plush in milky distance, with the outer tips of pine needles touched by autumnal tan, and yet this tan was invisible until you came close. Sunflowers, the little susie flowers still blooming spiritedly; sodden cornfields shrunken merciless, every ragged stalk of fodder soaked with mist; sandy, clayey bare spots in yard and gardens standing out silvery—intense spots, never casual, but seeming to have been cleared and stamped recently, and for a special purpose . . . eight o’clock in the morning, as told by his silver watch, with the sun burning low and solid in a cloudless sky but with farthermost groves still fogged; jack-oaks half green and looking withered and scrofulous; the scrub swamp gums well turned at this date, and some of them burning in artificial pinks; tulip trees half green; some of the buttonwoods verdant as in summer."|Andersonville|"MacKinlay Kantor"

He had wasted a good hour and a half in his wanderings and musings, and in conversing with the military party. He considered it wasted, because for the first time in—when?—the forest had not granted him the peace and food he sought. A prison, here where always there had been the green pleasure of growth, or water having its way with lichens—the blessing of gum, pine cones, sly animals feeding, rare birds meeting their kind? Let them build their prison someplace else, he’d have none of it. He knew the President, or had known him slightly seventeen years before. He should go to Richmond (but it would cost a sight of cash, and cash was not plentiful in these days) and utter a protest. He should take a firm stand, if this supercilious young captain sought to preëmpt any of the Claffey acres."|Andersonville|"MacKinlay Kantor"

A good two-thirds of the Brimstones were dug, and by noontime the hands would doubtless be ready to start in on the Hayti yams, which they preferred for the table, and which it was easier to raise as fare for the slaves because the Hayti yams were more prolific and they stored well. Common yams were the most prolific of all, but had rather a pumpkinish flavor. Ira couldn’t abide growing them."|Andersonville|"MacKinlay Kantor"

French dogs were a race apart: not like American dogs, not like Southern American dogs, with their long ears and jaunty scratching and their loose addiction to raccoons or brawling, or their fondness for copulation in the open dusty roads. French dogs marched in harness, they took tight little steps, they seemed to sniff in French, they carried the pinned-up ears of one breed, the ruffles of another, the hard-curled tails of still another heritage; they were indubitably French—they gestured with their strange tails as they met and conversed—"|Andersonville|"MacKinlay Kantor"

Put the tobacco in cold water—about the size of that crockful, over there on the bench; then throw in four or five shovels of hot oak ashes, and let the mixture set awhile before you give it to the mule. Ask master or overseer to use his watch; ask him to tell you when fifteen minutes had passed. Then the solution was ready to use, and better not use more of it than a chunk bottle full at one time.

But their muscles scarcely recognized the demand put upon them. There was always a demand upon their muscles, an order calling for bending, stooping, lifting, toting, kneeling, bearing, squatting, digging, heaping, covering, flailing. Jonas was thirty-eight or so, Jem perhaps the same age (nobody knew) and Coffee in his youngest prime. They were the sole male active survivors of a troop which once had thronged the cotton rows, cornfields, pig-pens, goober patches, wood brakes. Nowadays they performed any and every task, dreaming no further ahead than the cold potatoes of noon, hot potatoes of night, the boiled turnips, the tasty chew of pork, the picked game bones, the dog yelling that here were squirrels . . . dreaming certainly no further ahead than the next turkey gobble or Christmas gift or yielding of a giggling shiny body in a bed or down a fence-row."|Andersonville|"MacKinlay Kantor"
12:00|noon|"At noon the Claffey hands sprawled in solid sunlight, protected from wind by the bulk of a broken tree, warm as toast and with a few flies bothering them. Preparations for the stockade were more extensive than people of the countryside had dreamed. Parties of impressed laborers kept arriving all forenoon—also soldiers, with wagons containing ragged tent flies beneath which some of the workers would be housed temporarily. Labor was being brought from points as far as a day’s journey distant; the Claffey people said, I wouldn’t do it, reckon I’d run off, not sleep in these here woods but put for home and my own good bed. They saw a young captain master riding around on a sorrel horse; rumor said that also there were a major master and an old colonel master somewhere about, but none of the Claffey contingent saw them. Axe parties were kept toiling while the diggers had their nooning, in order to have progressed well ahead of the shovels. A certain grim if slatternly efficiency was now apparent in the whole enterprise."|Andersonville|"MacKinlay Kantor"
12:00|midday|"As he returned slowly to his home at an hour approaching midday, the chorus of axes, shouts, songs, whistles, bellows and thuds came steadily louder, the nearer Ira approached to the Sweetwater branch and astounded hills hemming it. What ugliness—to know that there would soon be a prison adjacent to one’s dooryard! He supposed that prisons were necessary, but the thought of this stockade pained him before it was even made. He counseled himself that he should be glad there was a prison—and in such a healthy area as this—for a prison meant that the young fellows who’d be placed in it were living still; they were not extinct as the Claffey boys were extinct, but they were breathing and able to walk around, even restrained by the fence of massacred pine trees. If there were no places of military detention it would mean that every individual who yielded to superior force was slaughtered when he yielded. That would be a massacre in truth."|Andersonville|"MacKinlay Kantor"

He had released every slave (excepting trained carpenters) drawn from a plantation where there were less than five male hands; he had released half of all the rest. This left a crew of not more than forty hands still hewing fallen pines and planting them in the five-foot trench. Ira Claffey had never begged the return of Jem, Coffee and Jonas, but he welcomed them; now his hands were plowing and planting diligently, happy also at having hot rations prepared by their wives, no longer reduced to cold fare at noon. The ridges sustained a comparative silence; the chopping, the whoops of ox-drivers echoed only sporadically. A portion of the fence near the southwest corner remained to be set in place; the rest of the structure towered in a raw parallelogram enclosing seventeen or eighteen acres. A narrow strip at the south was Claffey land, the balance was requisitioned from the neighbors. Posts, so recently the trunks of living pines, had been coarsely stripped and squared to be planted tightly side by side. A dense odor of fresh gum occupied the air; it was sweet to smell; and blue smoke drifted by day from smouldering fires where stumps and roots were charring, and at night there was a devilish glow. Underbrush—there had been little of it to begin with—was scorched off. Less than twenty trees still lived within the area, most of these of little account as to size."|Andersonville|"MacKinlay Kantor"

Ira lifted Deuce to the high bed, Badger’s old bed. At the foot of the bed Deuce curled gratefully, glorying in close contact with his master. With care Ira kept his feet to the left side, that he might not disturb the dog on top of the covers. Deuce went to rest in the early morning hours. When Ira awakened belatedly after seven o’clock, roused by sounds from below, the old dog was still curled as he had been hours before. Perhaps the heartworms had reached his gentle heart at last; he was fourteen. Ira had bought the pup especially for Suthy when the boy was ten, but forever Deuce regarded Ira as his one-and-only. Ira Claffey dressed quietly, in respect to the friend who lay upon his bed. Strangely he found a sweetness and warmth in this death, in the manner of its coming. Had he cried, Death, withdraw? It did not seem possible now, when one considered the gift and its healing permanent perfection. He carried the friend down to the library and placed him on the couch, covered with the old cloak; then he went to tell the others. Harrell Elkins said, Poor creature. He must have perished of pure happiness at being allowed to sleep with you. Lucy went to the library and cried softly, lifting the cloak to stroke Deuce’s white hair, thinking of her brothers as she did it. Poppy, maybe he can hunt with them now. In the Hereafter.

What had those boys read about in the newspaper? A Rebel retreat, a brazen Northern lie?

Later he was challenged by hangers-on; he stood with docility while they ripped out his pockets and found nothing except an uneven set of small flat grayish stones which he used to play checkers with, with Sergeant Colony. The roughs threw the stones away, biffed Edward Blamey until his ear rang and seemed deafened; they swaggered off toward the gate.

And the very earth which was earth no longer, but instead a wet blanket of fecal matter laid across the rounded ribs of the sad punctured world—this apology for earth made its own conversation around Chickamauga; the unseen pools bubbled and stank, the bubbles came out of them as if forced by slow bellows underneath, and worms were working in that slime, or phantom snakes or toads. The bubbles popped, swallowed themselves, the smell came thickening."|Andersonville|"MacKinlay Kantor"
22:50|"twenty-two fifty"|"Together or singly they stole other things. The post adjutant owned a slab shack to which only he had the key, and rumor claimed that the shack was stuffed with good things to be sold at fancy prices to prison sutlers. Floral Tebbs watched sharply whenever he passed this structure on a slight incline above the road. He observed that it was set on posts, but that a very small person—one of his size or Irby’s—might snake his way between the squat pilings and perhaps gain entry from beneath. Boards had been nailed tightly to the sleepers, ambition was thwarted to begin with. Later Flory discovered by candlelight, and with Mackey and Irby lying along the ground outside to shield the candle’s flare— He discovered that one of the sleepers was worm-eaten. You could practically push the nails out with your fingers, or at least with a claw-hammer if one might be filched. In time this too was accomplished, and, under cover of the trampling and barking of a thousand new prisoners arriving in one night, the nails were dispensed with. Irby and Flory got into the adjutant’s shack and passed things out to Mackey Nall beneath the floor. They made several raids before an investigation disclosed the nature and manner of this burglary, though not the perpetrators thereof; then the floor was rebuilt and a guard was stationed at the building twenty-four hours a day. Nevertheless the scrawny freebooters had made off with red pepper, honey, salt, saleratus, half a bushel of onions worth sixty dollars Secesh per bushel, an entire box of tobacco worth twenty-two fifty; and to crown their achievement they had drained away several quarts of precious sorghum from a vast barrel which was believed to be worth the startling sum of three hundred and twenty-five dollars—not Secesh, but in greenbacks."|Andersonville|"MacKinlay Kantor"

Flory had never fired the musket; they had no gunnery range, no targets; he wondered if truly the kick was worse than the kick of Coral’s shotgun.

Coral had caught a string of catfish that morning, and the widow fried balls of cornmeal to go with them. There were turnip greens and pork as well, but Laurel declined all invitations to join her family at table. The rest ate eagerly, greasily, washing down their feast with quantities of okra coffee. Zoral gagged on a fish-bone and choked himself into purple regurgitation before his mother could extract the bone. Through this excitement Laurel did not lift her head from her work, she did not leave her bench and basket. Her gown was finished before two o’clock, fashioned from pieces of calico sent by Effie Dillard. Waist and skirt did not match—the one was of a green pattern, the other of gray—but to Laurel they were measureless beauty and pride. What you a-doing there, Sissy? inquired Captain Ox Puckett when he came stamping in. By Ned, ain’t you a regular little Betsy Ross, like they claim stitched a flag for General Jackson or somebody! Soon Ox and the Widow Tebbs had retired to The Crib, Coral was asleep on his bed, and Zoral was a train growling back and forth in front of a chicken-coop depot. Laurel crammed her new gown into the bull-grass basket and carried off soap, shampoo and rose oil which Lucy had given her. She took also two torn towels, reasonably clean, and some scraps of underclothing. Not even to Lucy could she have expressed her desire to be fresh and scented and neatly put together, in body and hair and dress alike. Passion was in her, her eyes snapped with it as she darted across the field behind the old Rambo homestead next door and sought upper reaches of Little Sweetwater."|Andersonville|"MacKinlay Kantor"

Gulls roosted far out on an island little more than a shoal, for the sea was calmer than usual and there was dry space for them to roost upon. They settled in white and dark and golden throngs as the last sun caught them (the boy thought of angel throngs). He looked away from the sea and island and sitting gulls, and progressed homeward along the shore path . . . it was like a moorland of his ancestors’ past, with wraiths to be avoided if one traveled when the fog came in. The boy walked on, carrying his heavy wooden tool-kit slung by a wide strap over his shoulder, for at seventeen he was close to being an expert at his craft, and had been repairing a dory that afternoon. Again he looked to the east, and there they were, there they were, rising. Some matter had caused dissent or alarm among the gulls, they boiled up like masses of dark leaves flung in October. Sun was down and hidden, no longer were the seabirds colored or angelic with natural cream or ivory. They flaked in a storm-cloud of black fragments, whirled in a peevish choir, their penetrating squall came across the crush of waves on rocks.

Down through fig boughs and blackberry vines, down through shadows where fat grass-green lizards held up their gargoyle heads in alarm and then scooted away. Down to the altars thirty meters below. Roofs of both chapels had fallen in—an earthquake was believed to have shaken the huge squared blocks apart, some hundreds of years since—and thin silky moss waved like miniature fields of wheat on the rich slimed slabs. No other people, no spectators, no ghosts . . . the priest knelt before the damp seeping altar with its defaced fresco depicting San Jorge above; he prayed briefly. Nathan Dreyfoos stood with straw hat in his hand, watching, listening to the flutter of birds in fig branches far overhead, the increasing flutter of speedy little bats in stalagmited caverns beyond San Jorge’s ruined altar. Sun was low behind the mountains, soon it would be evening, Nathan’s watch said that it was almost seven o’clock . . . but coolness coming from these fissures was never implacable, never born of decay.

Those soldiers laughed after he was outside, or as he was going out; he heard what they said; they knew well that Eric was not eighteen; in fact, one of them didn’t think that Eric was even sixteen.

He jerked and whined in his sleep, and then his wound would hurt him so badly that he’d get up and limp around outside the shebang and blunder against neighboring shebangs or step upon sleeping men, and would be cursed and pummeled. Someone told him that ground oak ashes would expel the maggots from his wound, and he begged Eric to buy oak ashes for him. Finally Eric found an old man among the guards who said that he could burn some oak and fetch the ashes for ten dollars Confed. When the twelve o’clock round of calls issued from the stockade’s rim that night, Eric must be lying in wait in blackness, just next to the deadline in front of the old guard’s booth. The guard would toss down a cord with a stone attached to the end, and Eric should fasten his currency to the cord; the guard would pull it up, and then he would toss out the cord a second time with the packet of ground-up ashes attached. . . .

The Fiedenbrusters attended one church, the Manns another, so there was not even a glimpse of Katty to be caught in the wet of noon. In afternoon Willie put an old piece of blanket over his head in lieu of mackintosh, and walked to the Fiedenbruster place where things were dismal in the extreme. The two youngest boys were sick abed with whooping-cough and you could hear them whooping like animals or Indians or something as you sat in the sitting room. Wempkie and Marta insisted on keeping their elders company, and Katrine was indignant about this, and spoke shortly to her sisters and her face became colored as always when she was angry. She sat and looked out of the little window and Willie thought she was mad at him. He suggested Authors—the Fiedenbruster girls owned a set of the cards, each card decorated with imposing pictures of Dickens and Wordsworth and Shakespeare and folks like that; if Marta asked Wempkie for Love’s Labour’s Lost, Number Two, and Wempkie didn’t have it, then when it came your turn you could say, Marta, do you happen to have Midsummer Night’s Dream, Number Two? Sometimes Authors was a jolly business; but Mrs. Fiedenbruster wouldn’t let them play on this day because it was Sunday. She said, No, mein Kinder, hickory nuts you can crack."|Andersonville|"MacKinlay Kantor"
00:00|midnight|"Willie was born to hardihood, for all his small size; Titus Cherry was not, for all his impressive bulk. Cherry wore a cap which would drop down on most other people’s ears. He had a mane of hair black as a crow’s back at midnight in the dark of the moon, and thick rounded eyebrows of the same material. His pale green eyes were slightly crossed, one of them was always looking off somewhere over the mountains. Once he rowed with Sergeant Buford about fatigue duty which Tite felt he hadn’t deserved; one word led to another, and finally Tite said slowly, Well, I’ll say no more. Dasn’t make any proper argument with you—the kind I’m honing to make—long as you got them stripes on your sleeve. Buford was a gingery man who stood nearly as tall as Cherry and had served six years with Regulars in the Indian country. Also it was rumored that he was experienced in the prize ring. He said to Tite Cherry, If it’s stripes that’s bothering you, bub, they’re easy taken off. So the two of them walked down behind the quartermaster’s wagons and a grove which shielded them; they went with half the company following and making bets. Sergeant Buford took off his jacket, stripes and all, and began to roll up the sleeves on his tough freckled arms. Tite Cherry just stood observing the sergeant and kind of smiling at him while his left eye searched upper regions of the trees. Then, without removing his own jacket, he stolled over to the tailboard of one of the wagons. There stood a barrel of flour, all filled up, top nailed on solid. Usually it took four men to load or unload one of those barrels—two in the wagon, two on the ground. Tite dropped the tailboard on its chains and—standing beside it, with everyone watching with their jaws hanging open—he put his right arm halfway around that barrel and began to pull . . . pulled the barrel right over to the edge and past.

Clouds had gloomed and pressed low as if challenging the slivers atop the fence to rip them open; so in time they were ripped. Willie lay half submerged in a pool, close to the deadline on the steep north slope. Oilcloth covered the upper portion of his body, and stiffly he held his thin elbows immobile and pressed his palms up to tilt the long-punished fabric. The ill-favored ill-flavored storm distributed its substance into his mouth, flowing over cracks in his lips, filling cracks inside his mouth which felt like the cracks in a plaster wall."|Andersonville|"MacKinlay Kantor"
12:00|midday|"Enthusiastically Cato wrote to Ira Claffey, telling him of his plan and inviting Ira’s assistance and generosity. The minister had not been informed of Lucy’s little march with wenches and baskets, and her inability to reach the stockade. He thought, as many well-intentioned people have often thought, that he had conceived of a particularly glossy charity—a bounteous impulse instigated by God, no doubt, but still a personal mercy. He wrote: If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food— The General Epistle of James eludes me for the moment, Brother Ira. Puss is asleep upon my Bible, and I shall not disturb her, since she may be dropping kits before nightfall. Last time she had them in the drawer containing my drawers and stockings! But what think you of the proposal? Neighbor Stancil has promised the lend of his big wagon, with a four-mule team; and he a Methodist! The Dennards, Lindsays and Nunns all express themselves as willing to give; and I should think a few bushels might also be got from the Lockridges and others, perhaps more than a mere few bushels; they might donate plenteously. Have you green corn enough and to spare? What of your cabbages and the general collard situation? I have set Buff to pulling turnips that they may be scrubbed. A further suggestion comes from Mrs. McCrary: her own dear child languished last year on an isle at the North, without sufficient coverings for his poor body; and she has sat with me, and we have explored God’s opinion, or have attempted. Since the lad is now among The Blest (but they did have shelter; he died in a barracks, twas said) the lady has possessed an overpowering intent to find favor Aloft by exhibiting true Christian mercy to his enemies. She is assembling his entire stock of shirts, jackets, pantaloons and the like, to be offered to destitute Northrons. As we have observed, there is prevailing raggedness at Anderson, in some cases amounting to nakedness and resulting indecency. Poor as we have become in this struggle for Independence, and to repel invading hordes, I should think a goodly supply of serviceable clothing might be gotten together if each gave his mite. I myself am contributing boots—which pinch me, I admit, but might not pinch some shoe-less Yankee. But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. Mrs. Dillard goes flying about, attempting to collect medicines; and such a small stock can be assembled; and she dare not rob her own closet too grievously, since her attention is demanded by many ailing persons now and again. But boots, potions, turnips, green corn, undershirts or melons: all seem of value, all I should believe would be received thankfully by the lads there, misguided into cruelty though they have been. Now, dear Brother, what of the military who are in command? Will they see fit to admit of our charity? I grow alarmed at considering what has come to me of the superintendent and the general commanding: both obstreperously and insistently profane, tis said. I have not heard that either is addicted to The Bottle, but that they take a particular delight in cursing; and also this is reported of the troops under them. However, I should think that if we were to seek not permission in advance, but were to appear bag and baggage and basket, they would be bound to accept our small offering for the unfortunates perforce. Since many of the items are spoilable. Ah, also: Mr. Marshall has promised a pig. Though I had to fling Testament at him for an hour to get it! The pig must be butchered promptly before our departure. One cannot speculate as to the weather; but I should hazard an opinion that, all things being equal, and you receiving no advices to the contrary, our little caravan might arrive by Friday midday. If not on Friday, look to see us on Saturday. Mrs. Dillard is bound to come on for the distribution, and shall be accompanied by a few other ladies, I make little doubt. Do not feel that you must feed them, Brother, or the rest of us; but we shall pay our respects, and hope to gather up your own donation. Word has reached us of the miraculous spring bursting forth there. Could it be the same spring where you were wont to wander, and where we have sat many times; and where I told you of the Highland Presbyterians at Darien; and where in turn you told me of the so-called Dorchester Puritans, your own kinfolk in Liberty County, of more than a century since? Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. Puss is still upon the Bible, but I need no reference. As a mere child I was enamored of Exodus, and all the dramatic events therein, and the building of the tabernacle, and what was a cubit? Theology should be awarded early to a youth, that he remember; but often I was naughty and put aside my Catechism, and loved to watch the Hebrews at their fights. Ah, me. My pen has been trailing about; but should that not be the privilege of an old man’s pen? I wish it were yam time. Then we might assemble a quantity. Perhaps we can perform further philanthropy in the autumn. I have neglected to tell you that Neighbor Pace (Baptist) is giving carrots; and little Neddy Hinchley has just made an errand to inform me that his mother will contribute what fruit is left to her in all this hotness. Sakes, as your Lucy would say, what a scorcher is today! Heaven be praised that our dear Sister Veronica is no longer called upon to endure Earthly miseries; but sleeps, knowing no misfortune, and in fully justified hope, I am convinced, of a Glorious Resurrection. I pray for you daily, Brother, and please to include me in your prayers. Until the oncoming of our charitable migration, then. In Brotherly Faith & Hope, Yrs, C. Dillard."|Andersonville|"MacKinlay Kantor"

Shoes and clothing had scarcely been prepared for distribution, along with the freight of vegetables, when the Americus procession ambled down the lane from the west. It consisted of three vehicles: the Dillards ahead in their gig, followed by a carriage containing three ladies of Americus; also young Dr. Pace, with empty sleeve pinned against his coat. He had been struck by a piece of solid shot in 1862. The Stancil wagon brought up the rear.

He had some business to do at the local bank and with a couple of folks whose property was mortgaged to him, so he went and did it. He hadn’t eaten a bite all that day, and began to feel weak although he wasn’t truly hungry. He went into Wilkins’s and bought some crackers and cheese and salted codfish, and sat in his buggy beside the free-flowing town trough while he ate. It was shady there under the elms, and it was a good place to eat a luncheon however belated. He could drink from the wet-moss-draped old pipe, drinking from the stream before it fell into the stone trough below.

Dawn came gray, cooler than the dawn of yesterday; clouds were still soaked and soaking; at five-thirty o’clock, as time was told by the few watches still remaining to those hordes, no true light was discernible . . . clouds roosting above the eastern fence . . . barest hint of morning, perhaps imagined. At the bottom of the perpendicular shaft, knotted rags tightened once more in measurement, a new knot was counted."|Andersonville|"MacKinlay Kantor"

"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"The eight o’clock call came droning from stations beyond. It was relayed immediately from Station Number Three on Flory’s right. Station Number Three, the guard called, eight o’clock and all’s well. Flory stood with feet apart, frail hands clenched around his musket barrel. He put a special agony into the news he squawked abroad: Station Number Four, eight o’clock, and Atlanta’s gone to hell!"|Andersonville|"MacKinlay Kantor"
00:00|midnight|"At midnight his light slumber was disturbed by an unprecedented screaming of engine whistles at the Anderson station, where the side track switch was jammed; a train waiting there could not enter upon the main line until repairs were effected. Ira went to his window. The valley glowed red with those same baleful flames which had shone in February, though tonight flames were fewer. It was one thing to guard prisoners being fetched into Andersonville, quite another thing to watch and guard them on their way to be Exchanged. . . ."|Andersonville|"MacKinlay Kantor"
"ap ~ 02:00"|"About two o’clock"|"About two o’clock in a white night Ira Claffey was awakened by a persistent pounding at the front door on the gallery below his room. Seldom had he been routed out at unearthly hours except as a prelude to catastrophe. There was the time the quarters burned at the McWhorter place, the time a black child was snake-bitten while walking in her sleep, the time Uncle Arch Yeoman’s simple-minded daughter put her right hand into the hot stove because she had stolen money from her father’s purse with that right hand, and she recollected a Biblical injunction she’d heard preached. Veronica Claffey walked to doom in nighttime. The news of Moses Claffey’s death had come at night. Also a train was wrecked at night on the line north of Anderson with several people killed and many injured. Ira took up no robe but hurried down in his nightshirt. Apprehensively he drew back the two bolts."|Andersonville|"MacKinlay Kantor"
"ap ~ 04:00"|"about four o’clock"|"Mrs. Dillard fetched everything from febrifuge to Peckham’s Cough Balsam, from emenagogue tincture to female laxative and anodyne pills. She must have cleared two shelves of her medicine closet. She shared the concern of Elkins: it appeared that she would lose her patient about four o’clock of the first afternoon. She worked in frenzy to stimulate the child’s heart action and circulation. She reported, when Cousin Harry was able to look in the next morning, that Laurel was mending. Harry did not share this hopeful opinion. But when the girl lived still, two days following, he asked Mrs. Dillard what witches’ remedies she had employed."|Andersonville|"MacKinlay Kantor"
"~ 16:00"|"About four o’clock in the afternoon"|"About four o’clock in the afternoon Ira took leave of Lucy and Mrs. Dillard; Harry Elkins was on duty at the hospital. Ira walked to Anderson Station carrying his own carpetbag; there was no meanness about this nowadays; his hands were at work getting winter wood, he did not wish to take one hand from his task. Ira sat on the tailboard of a collapsed wagon almost until dusk: the train had been long delayed between Albany and Americus."|Andersonville|"MacKinlay Kantor"
12:00|noon|"Old Mrs. Bile died the next morning, and Mrs. Dillard was driven back to the Claffeys’ at noon by a Bile nephew. Effie’s mind was filled with recollections of a peaceful passing; she thought of agèd death as a release from all sin and pain, a glorification to be envied; she continued in busy thought, concerning herself also with Heaven, and the notion of her own children and grandchildren reveling there. In this mood she scarcely recollected that Lucy and Harrell Elkins had spent a night to threaten chastity. She presumed that she knew a gentleman when she saw one, and a lady as well. She knew that no gentleman such as Elkins would presume to dishonor a pure young lady, that no pure young lady such as Lucy would presume to desire to be dishonored."|Andersonville|"MacKinlay Kantor"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"The Dillards arrived at the plantation Tuesday evening, accompanied by Laurel Tebbs, who had acquired the art of blushing whenever spoken to. She carried with pride a puckered bag of black silk, complete with drawstrings. This feminine delight had been given her by one of the neighboring Dennards of Americus, who found it among the effects of a recently deceased aunt. It now contained a pocket handkerchief actually dampened with cologne, and a square looking glass which said on the back: Compliments of Beglois & Sons, Cotton Brokers, Savannah, Ga. These things were Laurel’s personal property, she would not have parted with them under any circumstances. She had also a pill-box containing seven imitation garnet buttons which had come off an old gown of Mrs. Effie’s, and were a present to Laurel’s mother. Laurel was driven in style to the Tebbs place. Mrs. Dillard refused to allow her to spend the night there: she was sure that the widow must have retrogressed since October, she said that someone would call for Laurel at eight. . . . With Laurel safely bedded in Moses Claffey’s old room, the rest stayed round the fire a while. Cato Dillard quoted liberally from the Directory For Worship."|Andersonville|"MacKinlay Kantor"
"ap 02:04"|Two-four|"This one, he said. Two-four, of course. We called it Gilderoy. Reckon it’s about a kind of fable. . . . And this, he said. Two-four as well. We called it Adam Bell’s March, and it goes clear back. Now this, said Abijah Parker, and his fingers were limber—you would not have known that they were elderly fingers, that joints were stiffening as joints of the agèd must. They were so fluid, notes which sped were fluid and oily. . . . Called that one the Turkey Gobbler. So you thought of turkeys running wild, their burnished necks metallic in the woods, spurred feet fleeing. You heard the rifle sound: a man in buckskin clothes had shot a turkey, shot him dead. . . . Haste To The Wedding, said old Mr. Parker. You thought of a frontier wedding, people dancing as fiddles whined."|Andersonville|"MacKinlay Kantor"
12:00|noon|"Well, said Joe Jew, shrugging. A good apple turnover would be so much better; but I am next door to a beggar, so I cannot be a chooser, and no dinner did I have this noon. Nothing but work, work, work, peddle, peddle, peddle! He complained for a moment more; but he accepted the parcel of buns, and passed the wonderful whistle down to the boy. Merry did not even see him drive away, he did not realize that Joe Jew was gone. He stood graven, caressing the magic tube. He tried to remember what Mr. Abijah Parker had told him; he tried to remember how Mr. Parker’s fingers looked on the fife, how he held it. This was different; but it was the same, because there were six holes. And anyone who could learn to play on such a whistle could, Merry was sure, learn to play upon a fife. He sat again on the step, no longer in collapse. He remembered . . . six holes . . . all closed for the first note. Then lift this third finger of the right hand for the next note. Now—up with the second finger as well . . . now up with the first finger. Loose shrill notes crawled softly if uncertainly. Soon Merry was playing the scale. It would not be long . . . oh, mercy and delight . . . it didn’t sound like a fife: the music was thinner, more birdlike. But the same tunes could be played, and in the same way."|Andersonville|"MacKinlay Kantor"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"Through the next hawking, eagling, rolling years he taught him. Oh, yes: The Raw Recruit. Oh, yes: The Huntsman Hornpipe. Oh, yes: Granny Will Your Dog Bite? It was as if rough shrilling voices of a hundred deerskin melodists had lain compressed within the tube which Merry Kinsman learned to play; only his weaving fingers might let them loose. When at eleven he was forced to servitude under Miller Adams, it was tragedy worse than the punishment he received in his grain sack episode, far worse than slaps or slavery . . . it was molten agony poured within his being . . . Mr. Adams would not tolerate his whistle at the mill. Mr. Adams told him to take that wretched thing home and never bring it back, or he’d fling it clean over the mill race into the Susquehanna. He said that only idle boys would sit around, blowing on a thing like that. (In fact, for Mr. Adams’s money, no one except idle folk make any music at all. He held fiddlers in especial scorn, and would not let his daughters go into any home where fiddling and jigging were permitted. Therefore, as so often occurs, both daughters managed to get into trouble, and had to be married; and neither was happy in her enforced matrimony.)"|Andersonville|"MacKinlay Kantor"
"ap 06:08"|Six-eight|"I hain’t forgotten!
Six-eight! The drums’ll catch us.
Merry’s fife was pressed into his hands, his hands were grown strong again. Uncle Bijah played the first three notes alone, then Merry joined him. They strode off together through the smoke, drums thudding and booming beside and behind them."|Andersonville|"MacKinlay Kantor"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"Mortality at Camp Lawton was enormous despite improved internal conditions. Prisoners died of wounds, they died because Andersonville had wounded them. . . . Within the stockade nothing was known concerning Sherman’s advance. No fresh fish came to carry news; no fish had come excepting unfresh fish from Andersonville. Winder established grotesque but effective penalties, forbidding the circulation of gossip on the Sherman situation to any of the prisoners. Therefore they were not hard to handle when, at three o’clock of a drizzly morning in late November, the first detachments were routed out and herded to the cars. Within a day or two the entire living population of the stockade had been removed to Savannah. At first it was thought that they could be left there with safety. This was not to be: Sherman aimed at Savannah."|Andersonville|"MacKinlay Kantor"
"< 12:00"|"nearly noon"|"Early he had requested an audience with General Winder. The desired permission was slow in coming: Winder wanted to know why the damn captain didn’t talk to the adjutant instead, about whatever it was he wanted to talk about. Having progressed through echelons, it was nearly noon when at last Sam was permitted to tap his transparent knuckles against the old man’s door, and to be growled at after he had entered and closed the door."|Andersonville|"MacKinlay Kantor"

12:00|noontime|"Coral stood examining the house and The Crib and the whole area with suspicion. Couldn’t see a mule under the trees. Ma might be entertaining, but he considered it unlikely. She had entertained through practically the entire night; now it was nigh onto noontime, and doubtless she would be asleep. What with Flory messing with the soldiers, and Laurel gone to the Dillards’, the Tebbs family was surely eating high on the hog these days. Coral suspected that his mother was suffering in some degree from the Venus’ curse, for he had seen her dosing herself out of mysterious bottles. But always she was in good humor; it didn’t seem to interfere with her entertaining of visitors. With all the troops in the neighborhood (far less than in previous months, after that big batch of Yanks was taken away in September—but still hundreds and hundreds of those Georgia Reserves) and with citizens traveling in droves, to get away from Bill Sherman— Sure enough! High on the hog. Two less mouths to feed: just Ma and himself and the baby—and the old lady had a sight of shinplasters which he had seen, and he reckoned that she had more tucked away that he hadn’t seen. Once in awhile she even gave him money without his asking for it. She said, Coral, sonny, I do feel so shameful bad bout that foot of your’n. Now you take this currency, and go you down to Uncle Arch’s and buy yourself a nice plug tobacco."|Andersonville|"MacKinlay Kantor"
12:00|midday|"In the afternoon, having disregarded his midday meal, Ira carried the artificial limb back to the Rambo site, lugging it in a grain sack. Coral Tebbs, scowling and frightened and sulky, was there with Naz Stricker. Like the other boy he found it difficult to believe that Ira Claffey could award such traitorous benevolence. Coral thought that if he were Ira he should wish to kill all Yankees in wholesale revenge. Ira had not lost a limb, he did not belong to the Lodge, he had not been fighting at that wheatfield place. Ira recognized their mutual attitude but said nothing in explanation, because he could not explain the whole thing, not even to himself. He could not say, Yes, once I too was a soldier. In Mexico. I was wounded painfully; I thought that I would lose my leg; for years I had to tie dressings about the wound each day, and let them fill up, and throw them away; until at last a surgeon’s probe brought out the remaining loose bits of bone, and those bits had turned black as coal."|Andersonville|"MacKinlay Kantor"
12:00|midday|"The paper was folded, pinned within the pocket of Jonas’s shirt, and baskets of food were put aboard the cart. Ira gave Jonas an old tobacco bag with strings drawn tight, containing dimes and quarters. He thought that Confederate scrip might suddenly be of no value whatsoever, but feared to have Jonas exhibiting dollars in some wayside store; quickly he might be robbed, indeed probably he would be robbed sooner or later. So goodbye to the Tiger mule and the cart as well. But could Ira sit down to a midday meal and think of these people wandering with empty bellies, the children wailing? No, no, his arm must reach to feed them over whatever distance it could reach, his wheels and hoofs should bear them forward."|Andersonville|"MacKinlay Kantor"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"They said that to put it baldly they were skirmishing for a bottle of liquor. They had been working hard and traveling far, and they didn’t have to report to Captain Noyes until five o’clock, and what about a bottle of mountain dew?"|Andersonville|"MacKinlay Kantor"
