Long in the habit of rising early, she said she would be with her father by seven. She would stay until three, when Fay would come to sit until eleven; Fay could ride the streetcar back in the safe company of the nurse, who lived nearby. And Mrs. Martello said she would take on the private duty late shift for the sake of one living man, that Dr. Courtland. So the pattern was set."|"The Optimist's Daughter"|"Eudora Welty"

"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"AT THE INEVITABLE HOUR, Laurel started from her bed and went downstairs in her dressing gown. It was a clear, bright seven o’clock, with morning shadows dappling the shine of the floors and the dining room table. And there was Missouri, standing in her hat and coat in the middle of the kitchen."|"The Optimist's Daughter"|"Eudora Welty"

"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"Laurel looked over their heads, to where the Chinese prints brought home by an earlier generation of missionary McKelvas hung in their changeless grouping around the mantel clock. And she saw that the clock had stopped; it had not been wound, she supposed, since the last time her father had done duty by it, and its hands pointed to some remote three o’clock, as motionless as the time in the Chinese prints. She wanted to go to the clock and take the key from where her father kept it—on a small nail he’d hammered, a little crookedly, into the papered wall—and wind the clock and set it going at the right time. But she could not spare the moment from his side. She felt as though in death her father had been asked to bear the weight of that raised lid himself, and hold it up by lying there, the same way he’d lain on the hospital bed and counted the minutes and the hours to make his life go by. She stood by the coffin as she had sat by his bed, waiting it out with him. Unable to hear the ticking of the clock, she listened to the gritting and the hissing of the fire."|"The Optimist's Daughter"|"Eudora Welty"

Wendell had possession of his old black hat. He came up to Laurel and said, “Young lady, I carried you some Bigbee pecans. I thought you might not harvest their like around here. They’re last year’s.” He held onto his parcels while he explained that he had sat up most of last night, after walking to the crossroads to flag down the bus at three this morning, and had shelled the nuts on the way, to keep awake. “Where I got lost was after I got inside of Mount Salus,” he said, giving the box to Laurel. “That’s the meats. You can just throw the shells away for me,” he added, handing her the sack. “I didn’t like to leave ’em in that nice warm seat for the next passenger.” He carefully dusted his hands before he turned toward the casket."|"The Optimist's Daughter"|"Eudora Welty"
12:10|"ten minutes past noon"|"IN THE PARLOR, the fire had mercifully died out. Missouri and Miss Tennyson got all the chairs back into place in the two rooms here and the dining room, and the crowd of bridesmaids had succeeded among them in winding the clock on the mantel and setting the hands to the time—only ten minutes past noon—and starting the pendulum."|"The Optimist's Daughter"|"Eudora Welty"

"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"Tish’s youngest son was still at home. “He won’t come out, though,” Tish had said. “He has company. A girl came in through his bedroom window—to play chess with him. That’s what she said. I think she’s the same one who came in through his window last night, close to eleven o’clock. I saw car lights in the driveway and went to see. They call him every minute. Girls. He’s fifteen.”"|"The Optimist's Daughter"|"Eudora Welty"

12:00|noon|"Laurel held the board tightly. She supported it, above her head, but for a moment it seemed to be what supported her, a raft in the waters, to keep her from slipping down deep, where the others had gone before her.
From the parlor came a soft whirr, and noon struck.
Laurel slowly lowered the board and held it out level between the two of them."|"The Optimist's Daughter"|"Eudora Welty"
