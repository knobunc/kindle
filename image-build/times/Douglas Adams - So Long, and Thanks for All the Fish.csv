"ap 10:30"|ten-thirty|"It was ten-thirty when he arrived, a fact he discovered from the steamed and greasy window of the Horse and Groom pub, in which there had hung for many years a battered old Guinness clock which featured a picture of an emu with a pint glass jammed rather amusingly down its throat."|"So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish"|"Douglas Adams"
00:00|midnight|"The wind flicked about a little, like the tail of a horse that’s trying to decide what sort of mood it’s in tonight, and a bell somewhere chimed midnight."|"So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish"|"Douglas Adams"
"ap 01:32"|"one … thirty-two"|"“At the third stroke it will be one … thirty-two … and twenty seconds.”"|"So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish"|"Douglas Adams"
"ap 01:32"|"one … thirty-two"|"“At the third stroke it will be one … thirty-two … and thirty seconds.”"|"So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish"|"Douglas Adams"
"ap 01:32"|"one … thirty-two"|"“At the third stroke it will be one … thirty-two … and forty seconds.”"|"So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish"|"Douglas Adams"
"ap 01:32"|"one … thirty-two"|"He looked into the tiny sleeping quarters.
“ … one … thirty-two …”
It sounded a bit muffled. There was a towel hanging over one of the speakers. He took down the towel."|"So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish"|"Douglas Adams"
"ap 01:33"|"one … thirty-three"|"He waited for the green light to show and then opened the door again onto the new empty cargo hold.
“ … one … thirty-three … and fifty seconds.”
Very nice."|"So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish"|"Douglas Adams"
"ap 01:34"|"one … thirty-four"|"He then went and had a last thorough examination of the emergency suspended animation chamber, which was where he particularly wanted it to be heard.
“At the third stroke it will be one … thirty-four … precisely.”
He shivered as he peered down through the heavily frosted covering at the dim bulk of the form within. One day, who knew when, it would wake, and when it did, it would know what time it was. Not exactly local time, true, but what the heck."|"So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish"|"Douglas Adams"
"ap 01:34"|"one … thirty-four"|"He tiptoed out and returned to the control cabin.
“ … one … thirty-four and twenty seconds.”
The voice sounded as clear as if he were hearing it over a phone in London, which he wasn’t, not by a long way."|"So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish"|"Douglas Adams"
"ap 01:59"|"One … fifty-nine"|"For twenty minutes he sat and merely watched as the gap between the ship and Epun closed, as the ship’s computer teased and kneaded the numbers that would bring it into a loop around the little moon, close the loop and keep it there, orbiting in perpetual obscurity.
“One … fifty-nine …”
His original plan had been to close down all external signaling and radiation from the ship, to render it as nearly invisible as possible unless you were actually looking at it, but then he’d had an idea he preferred. It would now emit one single continuous beam, pencil thin, broadcasting the incoming time signal to the planet of the signal’s origin, which it would not reach for four hundred years, traveling at light-speed, but where it would probably cause something of a stir when it did."|"So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish"|"Douglas Adams"
"ap 02:13"|"two … thirteen"|"As his tiny little cigar tube of an escape craft zipped out on the beginning of its three-day journey to the orbiting space station Port Sesefron, it rode for a few seconds a long pencil-thin beam of radiation that was starting out on a longer journey still.
“At the third stroke, it will be two … thirteen … and fifty seconds.”
He giggled and sniggered. He would have laughed out loud but he didn’t have room."|"So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish"|"Douglas Adams"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"That night, at home, as he was prancing round the house pretending to be tripping through cornfields in slow motion and continually exploding with sudden laughter, Arthur thought he could even bear to listen to the album of bagpipe music he had won. It was eight o’clock and he decided he would make himself, force himself, to listen to the whole record before he phoned her. Maybe he should even leave it till tomorrow. That would be the cool thing to do. Or next week sometime."|"So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish"|"Douglas Adams"
"ap > 06:00"|"Just after six"|"Just after six he returned to Fenchurch’s house in the alleyway, clutching a bottle of champagne."|"So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish"|"Douglas Adams"
"ap 04:00"|four|"“At four he got up and went to the bathroom again. He opened the door to the bathroom …” and so on."|"So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish"|"Douglas Adams"
17:00|"five o’clock in the afternoon"|"The giant robot had lurched back aboard the ship at lunchtime, and now it was five o’clock in the afternoon and no further sign had been seen of it. Much had been heard—more grindings and rumblings from deep within the craft, the music of a million hideous malfunctions; but the sense of tense expectation among the crowd was born of the fact that they tensely expected to be disappointed. This wonderful extraordinary thing had come into their lives, and now it was simply going to go without them."|"So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish"|"Douglas Adams"
