06:00|"6 a.m."|"And on this third day the whole thing was still a blur. We had been wakened as on my first morning by the hideous 6 a.m. clattering of dustbin lids; I hadn’t really expected the silvery tones of a bugle but I found this totally unromantic din intolerable. However, at the moment my only concern was that we had completed the circuit of the park. The gates were only a few yards ahead and I staggered up to them and halted among my groaning comrades."|"All Things Wise and Wonderful"|"James Herriot"
06:30|"6:30 a.m."|"This 6:30 a.m. walk to breakfast was just about the worst part of the day, when my morale was low and thoughts of home rose painfully."|"All Things Wise and Wonderful"|"James Herriot"
09:30|"9:30 a.m."|"I was due to start Lord Hulton’s tuberculin test at 9:30 a.m. and as I drove round the back of the Elizabethan mansion to the farm buildings nearby I felt a pang of misgiving; there were no animals in sight. There was only a man in tattered blue dungarees hammering busily at a makeshift crush at the exit to the fold yard."|"All Things Wise and Wonderful"|"James Herriot"
"ap 09:30"|"nine thirty"|"“It’s too bad for me, old chap,” he said, spraying a few matchsticks around and dropping flakes of tobacco on the stone flags. “I did promise to be ready for nine thirty but those blasted animals just won’t cooperate.”"|"All Things Wise and Wonderful"|"James Herriot"
"ap 05:30"|"five thirty"|"I looked at the alarm clock. It was five thirty. A horrible time, truncating the night’s slumber yet eliminating any chance of a soothing return to bed for an hour before the day’s work. And I hated turning out even more since my marriage. Helen was lovely to come back to, but by the same token it was a bigger wrench to leave her soft warm presence and venture into the inhospitable world outside."|"All Things Wise and Wonderful"|"James Herriot"
"ap > 07:00"|"after seven"|"My aching muscles were slow to obey as I soaped and towelled myself and pulled on my shirt. Fastening my watch round my wrist I saw that it was after seven and I could hear the farm men clattering in the yard outside as they began their morning tasks."|"All Things Wise and Wonderful"|"James Herriot"
"ap > 06:00"|"after six o’clock"|"I couldn’t see much point in viewing this perfectly healthy animal again but I promised to call. I had a busy day and it was after six o’clock before I got round to The Laurels. There were several cars in the drive and when I went into the house I saw that Mrs. Rumney had a few people in for drinks; people like herself—upper class and of obvious refinement. In fact I felt rather a lout in my working clothes among the elegant gathering."|"All Things Wise and Wonderful"|"James Herriot"
"ap ~ 03:00"|"about three o’clock"|"We got into my car. It was a Sunday, about three o’clock and the streets were quiet. He led me up the cobbled yard and opened the door of one of the houses."|"All Things Wise and Wonderful"|"James Herriot"
12:00|midday|"However, the sausage and mash wasn’t at all bad and Tristan was lavish with his helpings. The three of us cleaned our plates pretty thoroughly, because morning is the busiest working time in practice and I was always famished by midday."|"All Things Wise and Wonderful"|"James Herriot"
"ap ~ 07:00"|"about seven o’clock"|"We finished our drinks and Siegfried immersed himself in the Veterinary Record as savoury smells began to issue from the kitchen. It was about seven o’clock when Tristan put his head round the door."|"All Things Wise and Wonderful"|"James Herriot"

"ap ~ 05:00"|"About five o’clock"|"It was dark when I left the farm. About five o’clock on a late December day, the light gone early and the stars beginning to show in a frosty sky. I drove slowly, the enormous finger jutting upwards from the wheel, pointing the way between the headlights like a guiding beacon. I was within half a mile of Darrowby with the lights of the little town beginning to wink between the bare roadside branches when a car approached, went past, then I heard a squeal of brakes as it stopped and began to double back."|"All Things Wise and Wonderful"|"James Herriot"
06:00|"6 a.m."|"The whole London phase is blurred in my memory. Possibly because everything was so new and different that the impressions could not be fully absorbed, and also perhaps because I was tired most of the time. I think we were all tired. Few of us were used to being jerked from slumber at 6 a.m. every morning and spending the day in continual physical activity. If we weren’t being drilled we were being marched to meals, to classes, to talks. I had lived in a motor car for a few years and the rediscovery of my legs was painful."|"All Things Wise and Wonderful"|"James Herriot"
14:00|"2 p.m."|"But it was no good. I am normally a law-abiding citizen but I had not a single scruple. I had to see Helen. A surreptitious study of the timetables revealed that there was a bus at 2 p.m. which got to Darrowby at five o’clock, and another leaving Darrowby at six which arrived in Scarborough at nine.

14:00|"two o’clock in the afternoon"|"At first I couldn’t see a way of getting to the bus station at two o’clock in the afternoon because we were never free at that time, but my chance came quite unexpectedly. One Friday lunchtime we learned that there were no more classes that day but we were confined to the Grand till evening. Most of my friends collapsed thankfully on to their beds, but I slunk down the long flights of stone stairs and took up a position in the foyer where I could watch the front door."|"All Things Wise and Wonderful"|"James Herriot"

It was after midnight, with a biting wind swirling across the empty square, and I was so cold and bored that it was a relief even to slap the butt of my rifle in salute as a solitary officer went by."|"All Things Wise and Wonderful"|"James Herriot"
02:00|"two o’clock in the morning"|"All this passed through my mind as I stood on the frozen ground outside the Grand Hotel at two o’clock in the morning. I looked up at that venerable edifice, my eyes glittering fiendishly, half from the cold and half from the deranged spark of my recovered humour. I felt my rigid lips creak apart, and my head tilt back to aim at what I took to be Flt Lieut. Barnes’s window. “Woof!” I roared into the night “Woof! Woof!”"|"All Things Wise and Wonderful"|"James Herriot"

"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"There was one time I would have agreed with him wholeheartedly. It was nine o’clock on a filthy wet night and I was still at work. I gripped the steering wheel more tightly and shifted in my seat, groaning softly as my tired muscles complained."|"All Things Wise and Wonderful"|"James Herriot"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"The cough seized me again, racking my body, threatening to dislodge my eyeballs. It was a temptation to report sick but I hadn’t done it yet. Most of the lads stuck it out till they had roaring fevers before going sick and by now, at the end of February, nearly all of them had spent a few days in hospital. I was one of the few who hadn’t. Maybe there was a bit of bravado in my stand—because most of them were eighteen- or nineteen-year-olds and I was a comparatively old man in my twenties—but there were two other reasons. Firstly, it was very often after I had got dressed and been unable to eat breakfast that I felt really ill. But by then it was too late. You had to report sick before seven o’clock or suffer till next day."|"All Things Wise and Wonderful"|"James Herriot"
"> 12:00"|"Shortly after midday"|"Shortly after midday Mr. Bartle rang to say Jasper showed signs of returning spasms and before sitting down to lunch I rushed round to his house and repeated the barbiturate injection.

">> 00:00"|"well after midnight"|"It was well after midnight when I came sleepily out into the darkness. I felt drained. Watching the life of the friendly, clever, face-licking animal flicker as he lay inert and unheeding had been a tremendous strain, but I had left him sleeping—still anaesthetised but breathing deeply and regularly. Would he wake up and start the dread sequence again? I didn’t know and I couldn’t stay any longer. There was a practice with other animals to attend to."|"All Things Wise and Wonderful"|"James Herriot"
"ap 07:30"|"seven thirty"|"But my anxiety jerked me into early wakefulness next morning. I tossed around till seven thirty telling myself this wasn’t the way to be a veterinary surgeon, that you couldn’t live like this.

But now I felt a pang of regret as I looked over the heads at the wide beautiful bay stretching beneath its cliffs to the far headland, the sand clean-washed and inviting, the great blue expanse of sea shimmering and glittering and over everything the delicious sea-smell of salt and seaweed, raising memories of holidays and happy things lost in the war."|"All Things Wise and Wonderful"|"James Herriot"

At Darrowby I would have been dashing out to start the long day’s driving round the countryside, but here almost all the work was done at the practice house."|"All Things Wise and Wonderful"|"James Herriot"
19:00|"7 p.m."|"During the day I tried not to think about it but the knowledge that somewhere in the neighbourhood there was an ailing bulldog that I could not succour was worrying. I just hoped it was nothing fatal.

“Is that t’vet?” The voice was gruff and grumpy."|"All Things Wise and Wonderful"|"James Herriot"
"ap 05:30"|"five thirty"|"Little things like that enlivened the week but the tension still mounted as I awaited the return of Kim. And even when the seventh day came round I was still in suspense because the Gillards did not appear at the morning surgery.

"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"We went on like that for about two hours; bending, lifting, bending, lifting and shuffling forward without an instant’s respite. One of the strongest impressions I had gained when I first came into country practice was that farming was the hardest way of all of making a living, and now I was finding out for myself. I was about ready to throw myself down on the stubble when Mrs. Edwards came over the field with her young son and daughter. They carried baskets with the ingredients for our ten o’clock break; crusty apple tart and jugs of cider."|"All Things Wise and Wonderful"|"James Herriot"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"I pulled my chair closer to the blaze. There was always a lot of night work in our kind of practice but maybe I would be lucky.

“No, just you and Len. I’ll see you at ten o’clock.”
Next day the sun was warm on my back as I laid out my equipment on a small field near the house.
