He was what is commonly known as a safe man, not exactly brilliant, but plodding and tenacious to an extraordinary degree.

I pulls over to the curb, and the tall gent he gets out and stands on the curb and speaks in to the other one.

But the sum total of the knowledge he had gained was not great. In the first place, it was evident that the deceased was Mr. Coburn himself. It appeared that he was accompanied by a Miss Coburn, whom the manageress believed to be his daughter. He had been heard addressing her as Madeleine. The two had arrived in time for dinner five days previously, registering “F. Coburn and Miss Coburn,” and had left about eleven on the morning of the murder. On each of the four days of their stay they had been out a good deal, but they had left and returned at different hours, and, therefore, appeared not to have spent their time together. They seemed, however, on very affectionate terms. No address had been left to which letters might be forwarded, and it was not known where the two visitors had intended to go when they left.

One of the men alighted, bade good-night to his companion, and told the driver to proceed to King’s Cross, where his friend would settle up.

I told the chap to come back for me at six, and I walked down the river and did a bit of prospecting. The works were shut, and by keeping the mill building between me and the manager’s house, I got close up and had a good look round unobserved—at least, I think I was unobserved.

Both were carrying dust coats. Mr. Coburn drew the door to, and they walked towards the mill and were lost to sight behind it.

The men in the cabin were making a move. Coburn finished his whisky, and he and Henri rose to their feet.
“Well,” the former said, “There’s one o’clock. We must be off.”
The others stood up also, and at the same moment Hilliard crept once more up the ladder to the bridge and crouched down in the shadow of the chart-house. Hardly was he there when the men came out of the cabin to the deck beneath the bridge, then with a brief exchange of “Good-nights,” Coburn and the lorry driver passed down the ladder, crossed the gangway and disappeared behind a stack of pit-props on the wharf. Bulla with a grunted “’Night” descended the port steps and Hilliard heard the door leading below open and shut; the starboard deck lamp snapped off, and finally the captain’s door shut and a key turned in the lock.
