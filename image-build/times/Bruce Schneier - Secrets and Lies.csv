01:00|"1:00 A.M."|"Denial-of-service attacks can be preludes to criminal attacks. Burglars approach a warehouse at 1:00 A.M. and cut the connection between the burglar alarm and the police station. The alarm rings, and the police are alerted that the connection has been broken. Burglars retreat a safe distance and wait for the police to arrive. Police arrive and find nothing. (If the burglars are inventive, they cut the connection in some way that isn’t obvious.) Police decide that it’s a problem with the system, and the warehouse owner decides to deal with it in the morning. Police leave. Burglars reappear and steal everything."|"Secrets and Lies"|"Bruce Schneier"
02:00|"2:00 A.M."|"Closer to home, it’s a common auto-theft technique to set a car alarm off at 2:00 A.M., 2:10, 2:20, 2:30 ... until the owner turns the alarm off to appease the angry neighbors. In the morning, the car is gone."|"Secrets and Lies"|"Bruce Schneier"

05:00|"5.5 hours"|"Dictionary attacks used to be hard, because computers were slow. They’re much easier now, because computers are a lot faster. L0phtcrack is an example of a password recovery hacker tool that is optimized for Windows NT passwords. Windows NT contains two password functions: a stronger one designed for NT, and a weaker one that is backward- compatible with older networking login protocols. The weaker one is case-insensitive, and passwords can’t be much stronger than seven characters (even though they may be longer). L0phtcrack makes easy work of this password space. On a 400-MHz Quad Pentium II, L0phtcrack can try every alphanumeric password in 5.5 hours, every alphanumeric password with some common symbols in 45 hours, and every possible keyboard password in 480 hours. This is not good."|"Secrets and Lies"|"Bruce Schneier"
09:00|"9:00 in the morning"|"This protocol has some nice properties. The long-term secrets of Alice and Bob, which are kind of like passwords, are never sent through the network. On the minus side, this system needs a Kerberos server to operate;the Kerberos server is a trusted third party. This can mean a bottleneck in the system at 9:00 in the morning, when everyone is trying to log on to their computer."|"Secrets and Lies"|"Bruce Schneier"
23:00|"11:00 P.M."|"It’s much like the pizza delivery attack: Alice doesn’t like Bob, so she calls a hundred pizza delivery parlors and, from each one, has a pizza delivered to Bob’s house at 11:00 P.M. At 11, Bob’s front porch is filled with 100 pizza deliverers all demanding their money. It looks to Bob like the pizza Mafia is out to get him, but the pizza parlors are victims, too. The real attacker is nowhere to be seen."|"Secrets and Lies"|"Bruce Schneier"
03:00|"3:00 A.M."|"What this means is that if you assume that network attacks are comparatively rare, the base rate fallacy implies that your tests have to be really good to screen out all of the false positives. An IDS that habitually pages you at 3:00 A.M. with a problem that turns out not to be a problem—an all-night Quake game, or a new Internet application, or whatnot—is going to get turned off pretty quickly."|"Secrets and Lies"|"Bruce Schneier"
17:00|"5 P.M."|"If guards patrol the offices every 15 minutes, then the safe only has to withstand attack for a maximum of 15 minutes. If the safe is in an obscure office that is only staffed during the day, then the safe has to withstand 16 hours of attack: from 5 P.M. until 9 A.M. the next day (much longer if the office is closed during holiday weekends). If the safe has an alarm on it, and the guards come running as soon as the safe is jostled, then the safe only has to survive attack for as long as it takes for the guards to respond."|"Secrets and Lies"|"Bruce Schneier"

01:00|"100 hours"|"Two, the analysis is not controlled. Contests are random tests. Do ten people, each working 100 hours to win the contest, count as 1,000 hours of analysis? Or did they all try the same dozen attacks? Are they even competent analysts, or are they just random people who heard about the contest and wanted to try their luck? Just because no one wins a contest doesn’t mean the target is secure . . . it just means that no one won."|"Secrets and Lies"|"Bruce Schneier"
12:00|midday|"This is one of the principles behind proxy firewalls; there’s no point in broadcasting to the world valid hostnames and usernames. This is also the principle behind bespoke network countermeasures—network burglar alarms, honey pots, and similar countermeasures—the network administrator knows how the network works, and what people should be doing. When someone pokes around in a fake dormant account, for example, the administrator should know that it is an attacker. An attacker shouldn’t know what types of equipment are running where, what protocols are allowed under what conditions, and what ports are open under what conditions. I am amazed by the number of servers, applications, and protocols that announce themselves to the world: “Hello! I am randomserviceV2.05.” Many hacking tools scan for particular versions of software running on particular machines ...known to have particular vulnerabilities. If networks are unpredictable, attackers won’t be able to wander around so freely. Without this kind of information, it’s much harder to profile a target and determine what attacks to try. It’s the difference between walking in a sunny meadow at midday and a briar patch at midnight."|"Secrets and Lies"|"Bruce Schneier"
