"ap 02:30"|2.30|"Apart from his genius in the arts of imprisonment, the jailer made a strong impression with his love of stars and planets, which he talked about incessantly while feeding the dogs. He often knocked off at 2.30 and made his way to the Griffith Observatory, where he liked to fall asleep in the planetarium beneath the whirling cosmos. He was a twenty-six-year-old part-time employee with a good sense of what was visible and not visible to the naked eye. He was especially fascinated by the cool, distant, impervious stars and I’d say he was my first American friend. He worried about proximity, judging everything by how near or how far it was from him. Animals and outer space are excellent hobbies for such a person, for each is useful and comforting to humans with more than a passing interest in loneliness. Much of his conversation was about space animals, the poor beasts regularly sent into the sky as part of the respective space programmes of the United States and the Soviet Union. He enjoyed spending his afternoons thinking about those legions of chimps, monkeys, and macaques floating about the solar system, fulfilling man’s need to discover. The jailer’s natural patriotism led him to stress the American side of things: it was all happening in those years, so we heard a lot about Able and Miss Baker, the two monkeys who were the first creatures to travel into space and return, but there were many others – Sams, Hams, Enoses, Goliaths – shooting into the sky on Little Joe 2 as part of the Mercury programme, dozens of profoundly reluctant beasts gaining altitude, going sub-orbital, lost in space."|"The Life and Opinions of Maf the Dog, and of His Friend Marilyn Monroe"|"Andrew O'Hagan"
"ap 07:14"|7.14|"Up on the landing, Nick Gurdin was already shouting at his wife. I would soon discover that Nick spent most of his time upstairs, where he kept the bottles, and where the television was never off. I’m afraid Nick was a buffoon of long standing. He was always pasty-faced, the sort of man who sweated gently, like a girl crying. Everything in his life was to do with respect or rather its absence: he inspired none and he got none, he didn’t know why, and the situation drove him backwards into his deepest hollows, where he drank by himself in San Fernando bars and thought of new ways to deploy his growing hatred. If he’d lived in New York and worked in an office, he might have thrived as the typical, over-martini’d, cheating husband, leaving every night on the 7.14 to White Plains, a smudge of lipstick high on his neck and a tide of lies to see him through to the next day. But Nick was with Muddah and Muddah was in Hollywood. And in Hollywood Nicky Boy was forced to take early retirement. Upstairs, I could hear him berating his wife for leaving him without sufficient funds to see him through the day. She mentioned something about work at the studio. Carpentry work. A candle flickered in the alcove as he shouted again. I pulled myself up with my paws in an effort to inspect the gaudy seats of the chairs in the hall."|"The Life and Opinions of Maf the Dog, and of His Friend Marilyn Monroe"|"Andrew O'Hagan"
"> 23:00"|"after 11 p.m."|"She wanted out at the corner of 44th and Broadway. The pharmacy was open all hours and we skipped into its methylated environs, the car going on a block to wait for us. We were way off course, but that was always part of the excitement. In the pharmacy, Marilyn caused looks you wouldn’t believe: she thought it would help to wear sunglasses but they only picked her out and made a show of her. I walked past the toothpaste and the mouthwash, sniffing out the perfumes. But after a minute I took my chance and ran out the door again. There was lots going on, especially at the theatres. The St James: Becket starring Laurence Olivier and Anthony Quinn. The Hudson: Toys in the Attic, a new play by Lillian Hellman, with Maureen Stapleton, Robert Loggia, and the long-serving Irene Worth. The Majestic: Camelot with Richard Burton and Julie Andrews, ‘the hit musical of the season’, an explosion down there of bright lamps and what I imagined were deep Arthurian greens. It must have been after 11 p.m. because the theatres were closed and the people who passed were sealed in their overcoats and a little high on cocktails."|"The Life and Opinions of Maf the Dog, and of His Friend Marilyn Monroe"|"Andrew O'Hagan"

12:00|midday|"You can’t drive on Wilshire without thinking of the Roman Empire. Maybe just in the summer, when a layer of warped heat hovers over the road, the straight road that goes from civilisation to the sea. I thought of grapes. I thought of olives. I thought of tough guys in sandals. There was also a sense that the humid day might give way at any moment to annihilation, not Gaulish arrows but Russian missiles, raining down on the scene of enjoyment from a perfect blue sky. The palm trees shivered in the midday sun. Marilyn had me on her lap in the back of this long black car and we were cheerful, ready for chicken in a bun. ‘The last thing like this I’m going to eat, okay buddy?’"|"The Life and Opinions of Maf the Dog, and of His Friend Marilyn Monroe"|"Andrew O'Hagan"
"~ 23:00"|"around 11 p.m."|"We arrived at the party around 11 p.m., too late for supper but in very good time for scraps. It was a stand-up thing anyhow, which dogs understand, and Marilyn’s arrival caused no fuss. Kim Novak smiled from the corner and said ‘hi’ with a pretty cascade of fingers. Lawford had that preposterous, theatrical, very English way of greeting old friends, where he pretended he had been waiting the whole night just for you. It was a trick he had learned from his father, Sir Sydney Lawford: how to exude passionate interest without a scintilla of real personal involvement. They say Peter’s mother dressed her boy as a girl for the first ten years of his life, which explained a number of things about Peter quite neatly and sympathetically. He spent his life devising scenes of great moment that he could preside over whilst enjoying a secret absence. He beamed and took Marilyn by the hand. Someone gave her a glass of champagne and I stared up at Lawford with admiration. I loved him in Son of Lassie, the RAF pilot helped to safety across the snows of Norway  by a dog whose eyes blazed with the strange existentialist  thinking of Martin Heidegger. The dog was living for the  moment, unsure whose side to be on, but Lawford made  himself a likeable project and convinced the dog to gain its  freedom by throwing off reason and morality. I gather this  is not how the film is usually described, but I think Lawford  must have agreed with my memory of it because he lifted me  out of Marilyn’s arms with a whoosh of recognition. ‘Good  Lord,’ he said. ‘You’ve brought the dog. Is this the Frank dog?’"|"The Life and Opinions of Maf the Dog, and of His Friend Marilyn Monroe"|"Andrew O'Hagan"
"ap ~ 06:00"|"around six o’clock"|"That night the Mexican film people threw a party for Marilyn at the Grand Hotel. We made our way there around six o’clock, when a flag was lowered in a huge solemn square, and it seemed part of the ongoing splendour of insurrection that history’s cries for freedom and equality should lead in time to a bourgeois hotel. That is often the way with human struggles, I’ve noticed: they start in barrios and rowdy cafes and they end in the grand rooms of plush hotels, or in fetid palaces, bordered by guards and grey sofas. The contradiction seemed very earthy at the Grand Hotel, very much at home, jungle vegetation and overhead fans working together to stir the air. ‘Of course!’ the manager seemed to say, there is a necessary distinction between the glorious masses and the chosen few. In one smiling sweep we moved from the pavement – the popping cameras, the beautiful faces shouting ‘Maraleen, Maraleen’ – to a staircase of white marble. The big shots of the Mexican film industry were looking over the banister, Marilyn lifting me, cocking her head, my eyes dazzled by the men’s smiles and some bright Tiffany glass."|"The Life and Opinions of Maf the Dog, and of His Friend Marilyn Monroe"|"Andrew O'Hagan"
