"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"“An odd thing happened last night. I went in at two o’clock to settle my dear comfortably, as I always do, and she was lying there awake. But she must have been dreaming, for as soon as I got into the room she said, ‘The photograph. I must have the photograph.’"|"Sad Cypress"|"Agatha Christie"
05:00|"five in the morning"|"“She’s not a bad sort, really, but all nurses annoy me; they always will think that you’d like a ‘nice cup of tea’ at five in the morning!” She paused. “What’s that? Is it the car?”"|"Sad Cypress"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"“I’ve been making some sandwiches. Won’t you come up and have some? It’s just on one o’clock, and it’s such a bother to have to go home for lunch. I got enough for three on purpose.”"|"Sad Cypress"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap ~ 01:00"|"about one o’clock"|"“Elinor Carlisle was staying at the local pub. In the street she met the former housekeeper, Mrs. Bishop. Mrs. Bishop suggested coming up to the house to help her. Elinor refused—rather over-vehemently. Then she went into the grocer’s shop and bought some fish paste, and there she made a remark about food poisoning. You see? Perfectly innocent thing to do; but, of course, it tells against her! She went up to the house, and about one o’clock she went down to the Lodge, where Mary Gerrard was busy with the District Nurse, a Nosey Parker of a woman called Hopkins, helping her, and told them that she had some sandwiches ready up at the house. They came up to the house with her, ate sandwiches, and about an hour or so later I was sent for and found Mary Gerrard unconscious. Did all I could, but it was no good. Autopsy revealed large dose of morphine had been taken a short time previously. And the police found a scrap of a label with morphia hydrochlor on it just where Elinor Carlisle had been spreading the sandwiches.”"|"Sad Cypress"|"Agatha Christie"
03:00|"3 a.m."|"“Well not while I was on duty! Nurse O’Brien relieved me at 3 a.m., and she may have fetched him before the end; but, if so, she didn’t mention it to me.”"|"Sad Cypress"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 01:00"|"One o’clock"|"“When did you go to your dinner?”
“One o’clock, sir.”
“And you didn’t see anything—any man hanging about—or a car outside—anything like that?”"|"Sad Cypress"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap > 02:00"|"after two"|"“My car: It wasn’t my car! I was over Withenbury direction that morning. Didn’t get back till after two.”"|"Sad Cypress"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap ~ 09:00"|"about nine o’clock"|"“The following morning about nine o’clock, just as I was preparing to leave the house.”"|"Sad Cypress"|"Agatha Christie"
