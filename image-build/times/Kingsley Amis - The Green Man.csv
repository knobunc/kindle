successive guests tried to rape the chambermaid, called for a priest at 3 a.m.,
wanted a room to take girlie photographs in, were found dead in bed. A party of
sociology students from Cambridge, rebuked for exchanging obscenities at
protest-meeting volume, poured beer over young David Palmer, my trainee
assistant, and then staged a sit-in. After nearly a year of no worse than
average conduct, the Spanish kitchen porter went into a heavy bout of Peeping
Tom behaviour, notably but not at all exclusively at the grille outside the
ladies’ lavatory, attracted the attention of the police and was finally
deported. The deep-fat fryer caught fire twice, once during a session of the
South Hertfordshire branch of the Wine and Food Society. My wife seemed lethargic,
my daughter withdrawn. My father, now in his eightieth year, had another

there was nobody else to inform: my father’s brother and sister had died

parked the Volkswagen in the broad main street of the town and remembered
playing cricket with him on the sands at Pevensey Bay in, good God, 1925 or
1926. Once I had been out first ball and he had praised me afterwards for my
sportsmanship in accepting this with a good grace. While I waited, then was
dealt with, at the registry, I thought about that daily round of his in the
village, and wished I had accompanied him on it just once more than I had. By
the time I reached the undertakers’, my mind was on his first stroke and his
recovery from it, and in the bank I tried to imagine what his mental life had
been like afterwards, with sufficient success to send me straight across to the
George and Dragon at eleven thirty sharp. I had had just enough attention to

been his supervisor at St Matthew’s, and see if he could arrange that he and

managed one of any sort: I was too strung up. With me, this is normally an
altogether unpleasant state, but fluctuating within it now was a tinge of
amorous expectancy. I looked at my face in the glass. It was all right really:
on the pale side, a bit red under the eyes, and that ageing division between
chin and jaw at least as perceptible as ever; but physically not unpresentable.
What I had against it was its sameness and its continuity, always available
with its display of cheap sternness and furtive worry, always a partner to
unnecessary and unavoidable questioning. Timing it just right, my heart gave
one of its lurches and, following up dependably, the pain in my back, which I
had not thought about since the morning, turned itself on. I retaliated

what I might term shallow alcoholic amnesia, a man can be quite easily reminded
of what he has temporarily forgotten. The deeper sort blots out memory beyond
recall. This was the case here: I was prepared to believe that I had conversed
with Thomas Underhill’s ghost last night, but I would never know what it had
been like to do so. I might do better next time; it seemed to me there was
going to be a next time. If so, I must try to clear up some obscurities:
exactly what, for instance, the ‘proof’ of Underhill’s survival after death was
supposed to prove, and also what it might consist of. The idea that he had been
carrying or wearing some kind of giant silver brooch ‘behind his head’ was
unhelpfully bizarre; I recognized that, like most of those whose midnight
selves write notes to their daytime selves, I had thought some vital points too
obvious and memorable to be worth the trouble of recording. At a future
meeting, too, I might establish whether my account of trying to touch what I
had seen and heard was a brilliant attempt to describe the indescribable or a
straightforward result of drunken uncertainty about relative distances. Other
questions could be cleared up at once, such as why I had written on a past

habituate myself to, and left the apartment, picking up a lightweight raincoat on
the way. This —camouflage, not protection from the weather—I put on and
buttoned up to the chin before hurrying downstairs and out at the side door. In
the open, there was plenty of movement to and fro, and plenty of standing
about, too; as I waited in the shadows for a clear moment, I congratulated
myself on having allowed plenty of time. At last a man half-lifted a girl into
a car I considered he was much too young to own, and drove off, leaving the
car-park empty of people. I scuttled across to the Volkswagen and got away
without being seen, feeling light-headed in a more literal sense than I would
have imagined possible, had I ever considered the matter: the parts of my brain
usually reserved for thinking seemed to have been invaded by some gas, of low
atomic weight but not otherwise tricky to handle—helium, perhaps, rather than
hydrogen."|"The Green Man"|"Kingsley Amis"
"ap < 03:00"|"nearly three o’clock"|"I
pulled myself together. ‘Sorry. Who was it? Some farm boy on his way home from
a drink. They come in pretty odd shapes and sizes round here. Anyway, he
couldn’t possibly have recognized you, so don’t worry about it. It’s … good
God, it’s nearly three o’clock. I’ll take you home.’"|"The Green Man"|"Kingsley Amis"

"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"It was
a case of trying, more than succeeding, because it had been so hard to connect
anything about his burial with anything about him, or because I had four o’clock
on my mind (though it did not feel like that), or because the recently living
take so long to start seeming really dead, or because of something to do with
Jack’s pills. Cold and unmeaningful phrases circled in my brain: he had gone
off easy, he had given me life, he had been a good age, he was at peace, he had
done his best for me, he had seen his son and grandson settled, he must have
known it would come (as if that were a comfort). And he had gone to a better place,
he was dead in the body but not in the spirit—not easy to find more of the same
to add, nor even to try to find a meaning in anything of the sort, not
nowadays. It sounded as if, it felt as if, for every imaginable wrong reason,
that fool of a rector had been right. And yet I had meant what I had said to
him about evidence of survival in Underhill’s case. A different case, then, a
far-off one, concerning a man who was not a man at all, only a name and words
and bones and perhaps, no, certainly, an apparition. Immortality seemed either
too exotic or too crude a concept to be fitted into somebody one had known for
so long in the flesh. It might be possible to work on this from the other end,
so to speak—try to make Underhill more real to myself, more of a person, more
of a presence, however remote, in the same kind of way as my father was a
presence."|"The Green Man"|"Kingsley Amis"

small clock-face she wore at her wrist said four twenty-two. I looked at my own

there’s something else I’d like you to do for me. I want everybody in bed and

Joyce is never any problem, and if you could try to get Nick off in good time,
that would be a great help to me.’"|"The Green Man"|"Kingsley Amis"
00:00|midnight|"The
last thing was getting hold of David and asking him to see to it that the few
expected outside diners and drinkers were similarly off the premises by
midnight. The resident guests could not actually be sent to their rooms, but
they were unlikely to feel like prolonged carousing in the bar the night after
a funeral so close by. I supposed, at least, that talking to David would be the
last thing, until I almost literally ran into Joyce and Diana in the car-park."|"The Green Man"|"Kingsley Amis"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"While
they got slowly into the Mini-Cooper, I got quickly into the Volkswagen,
reflecting on Diana’s silence during the last exchange. I had never before
known her to be content with less than about a two-thirds share of any
conversation, however brief. And her whole demeanour over those dozen seconds
had been docile, almost subservient. Whatever had happened between those two
had had plenty of time to happen, I decided when I looked at my watch and found
that the time was exactly eight o’clock."|"The Green Man"|"Kingsley Amis"
23:52|"eight minutes to midnight"|"It was
eight minutes to midnight. Just nice time, I said to myself. Indoors,
everything was quiet and in darkness. Splendid. I went to the bar and fetched a
tumbler, a siphon of soda and a bottle of Glen Grant, took a weak drink and a
pill, and settled down in the public dining-room to wait the remaining two
minutes. I sat at a corner table in the part where Underhill’s parlour had
been, with just the one heavily shaded light in front of me turned on, out of
consideration to him. I was almost directly facing the window at which he was
accustomed to make his appearances, with the hall door diagonally opposite.
The night was warm, but not humid."|"The Green Man"|"Kingsley Amis"
00:00|midnight|"Very
faintly, I heard the church clock in the village begin striking midnight. I
could not remember whether, with clocks that do not strike the quarters, the
first note or the last signified the hour. Nothing happened, at any rate,
while the clock was striking. And nothing happened after it had finished,
either. I waited. The clock must be fast. But my own watch said two and a bit
minutes after twelve."|"The Green Man"|"Kingsley Amis"

"ap 10:00"|ten|"By ten
past I had decided that I had got the whole thing wrong, I had misunderstood
Underhill’s message, it had not been a message at all, I had been mistaken
about the freshness of the ink, he had just been seeing if I could be fooled
into keeping this appointment, he had been joking. But I was not going to give
him up yet. I sat there, unable to find any way of helping the time to pass.
Through my mind went thoughts of Joyce, and Amy, and Diana, and my father, and
Margaret, and the young man, and death, and ghosts, and drink, and Joyce again,
and Amy again. In my current (perhaps precarious, but remarkably durable)
state of detachment, all these topics struck me as very interesting but of no
personal moment whatever, like, say, the New England whaling industry in the
nineteenth century being considered by an intelligent and imaginative Grimsby
trawlerman of our own time."|"The Green Man"|"Kingsley Amis"
"ap 00:57"|"three minutes to one"|"I went
on not looking at my watch for much longer than I would have thought was
possible. Then I did. It was three minutes to one. Fine. To wait an hour was as
much as politeness and sanity demanded. I poured a short weak drink and sipped
it deliberately. As faintly as before, but, it seemed to me, more distinctly,
the church clock sounded, and I got up to go."|"The Green Man"|"Kingsley Amis"
"> 12:00"|"just after midday"|"‘Physically, there’s
nothing to worry about,’ said Jack just after midday. ‘That’s a perfectly
healthy sleep she’s in now. No evidence of concussion. No fever. And those cuts
and bruises are quite minor. Psychologically, well, I doubt if there’s much
grounds for anxiety there either, not immediately anyway, though I must admit
I’m a bit out of my depth with sleepwalking. Are you sure it was
sleepwalking?’"|"The Green Man"|"Kingsley Amis"
18:00|"6 p.m."|"I went
downstairs in search of David and found him in the front bar, an
all-too-popular rendezvous on Sunday mornings. It was full of middle-aged men
in Caribbean shirts drinking pints of bitter, and less straightforwardly
middle-aged women in floral trouser-suits drinking Pimm’s. They were all
talking as if from one side of a busy street to the other, but quietened down
and stared into their drinks when they saw me, out of respect for the bereaved,
or the insane. David was in the middle of taking an order from a party of six
that included a pair of identically dressed identical twin queers, and looked
as though he had had trouble getting that far. He greeted me apprehensively, no
doubt hoping, with some justification, that I was not about to ask him to do
anything along the lines of preparing a room for Count and Countess Dracula,
and cheered up a good deal when I did no more than tell him Amy’s wishes and
say I would be resuming charge at 6 p.m. (I had determined to finish everything
by then.)"|"The Green Man"|"Kingsley Amis"
"~ 03:00"|"about three this morning"|"‘I
haven’t had a chance to clear up all the crap,’ said the rector. ‘We got back
about three this morning, and I just made morning service with a big low on.
Oh, Cliff dear, could you turn it down a bit? I’m afraid Cliff and I are sort
of hooked on Benjie again. He does get to one, doesn’t he?’"|"The Green Man"|"Kingsley Amis"
"ap > 03:00"|"past
three o’clock"|"At past
three o’clock on a Sunday, the public dining-room was empty. We went in by way
of the kitchen without being observed, and I at once locked the door to the
hall. In quite a businesslike fashion, the rector put his suitcase on a
serving-table, took out his vestments or whatever one calls them, plus some
other odds and ends, accoutred himself with them and produced a book."|"The Green Man"|"Kingsley Amis"
