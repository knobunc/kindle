"ap < 03:00"|"Just before three"|"The rest of the afternoon was consumed by staff conferences and a typically silly birthday party for one of the station’s veteran cameramen. Just before three, somewhat later than usual, she left the building hurriedly and drove to her daughter’s school in Pacific Heights."|"Sure of You"|"Armistead Maupin"
"ap 05:00"|five|"Presidio Hill was a pricey “alternative” institution, which placed special emphasis on creative development and one-on-one guidance. At five, Shawna was the youngest kid in Ann’s Class (that was what they called it, never kindergarten), and her classmates included, among others, the daughter of a famous rock star and the son of a celebrity interviewer for Playboy magazine."|"Sure of You"|"Armistead Maupin"

"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"Soon enough, Harry did retire to the bedroom, leaving his masters to snooze on the sofa. Michael drifted off to a rising chorus of foghorns and the occasional screech of tires down in the Castro. At eleven o’clock he was jolted awake by his beeper, prickly as a needle in the darkness."|"Sure of You"|"Armistead Maupin"
"ap 02:00"|two|"“Is she here today?”
D’or shook her head. “Not till two.”

"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"In the kitchen his wife was shelling peas, looking raw-boned and Sally Fieldish in her Laura Ashley apron. When he kissed the nape of her neck, he caught a whiff of her ripe six o’clock smell and felt totally, stupidly, in love with her."|"Sure of You"|"Armistead Maupin"
"ap 05:00"|five|"“We could,” she said. “But it’s five for dinner…six counting Puppy…and somebody’s gotta dish it out. I just thought it would be more convenient.”"|"Sure of You"|"Armistead Maupin"
12:00|NOON|"AT NOON THE NEXT DAY BRIAN AND THACK TOOK A bag lunch to the top of Strawberry Hill, the island in the middle of Stow Lake. (Typically, a hassle with the nursery suppliers in Half Moon Bay had caused Michael to drop out at the last minute.) As Brian looked out over the dusty greenery of the park, Thack ripped open the Velcro closure of his wallet and produced a joint."|"Sure of You"|"Armistead Maupin"
"ap 01:30"|one-thirty|"They left the park at one-thirty and took a bus up Twenty-fifth Avenue to the nursery. Thack would walk from there to a house off Geary he was assessing for the preservation people. When the bus stopped at Balboa, a pair of teenagers boarded with noisy ceremony. Some gut instinct told Brian to brace himself for trouble."|"Sure of You"|"Armistead Maupin"
"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"It was agreed that they’d arrive at the restaurant in two cars: Mary Ann, Brian, and Burke in Mary Ann’s Mercedes; Michael and Thack in their VW. There was also the minor matter of a baby-sitter, and Nguyet, as usual, required nothing less than a bald-faced bribe before consenting to stay at the house past midnight. Brian, typically, knew next to nothing about the Rands, so while Burke was in the bathroom, Mary Ann dug into her stash of Interviews and gave her husband a hasty briefing."|"Sure of You"|"Armistead Maupin"

09:00|"nine o’clock in the morning"|"Anna avoided this gentle harassment by staring at the big greasy clock on the wall of the Mermaid. Eventually she asked: “What time is it in San Francisco?”
Mona did some quick arithmetic. “Uh…nine o’clock in the morning.”
“Oh, good.” Anna rose suddenly and gave Stratos an apologetic look. “Would you be a dear and keep my daughter company for about ten minutes?”"|"Sure of You"|"Armistead Maupin"
12:00|noonday|"THEIR VILLA, LIKE MOST OF THE HOUSES AROUND IT, was a two-story stone building with a red-tile roof and big pine shutters that could be battened against the noonday sun. There was a kitchen (which they never used), a terrace dripping with dusty wisteria, and a pair of huge, high-ceilinged bedrooms overlooking the Aegean. When Mona awoke in hers, it usually took her a while to determine whether it was morning or late afternoon, since she hardly ever missed a siesta."|"Sure of You"|"Armistead Maupin"

"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"When Mona woke to the three o’clock church bells, the air was much cooler, and there were fat, bruised clouds lolling outside her window. This had been her last siesta; tomorrow she’d be back in Athens, sitting on her luggage, waiting for her flight to Gatwick. Wilfred had insisted on meeting her plane, so she felt compelled to be strict about her schedule."|"Sure of You"|"Armistead Maupin"

"ap < 10:00"|"just before ten"|"He left the building just before ten and walked down the hill to the park, where he wandered amid people frolicking with Frisbees and dogs. Three years of daily fretting had left him overrehearsed for this moment, but it still seemed completely unreal. He had vowed not to rail against the universe when his time came. Too many people had died, too many he had loved, for “Why me?” to be a reasonable response. “Why not?” was more to the point."|"Sure of You"|"Armistead Maupin"
