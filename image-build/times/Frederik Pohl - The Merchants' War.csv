"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"The lounge began to fill with senior staff for the eleven o’clock briefing session, and one of the first to arrive was my roommate and rival, Hay Lopez. I jumped up and got his coffee-sub for him, and he looked at me with suspicion. Hay and I were not friends. We shared a duplex suite: I had the top berth. There were real good reasons for us not to like each other. I could imagine how he had felt, all those months, listening to Mitzi and me in the bunk above. I didn’t have to imagine, really, since I had come to know what it was like to hear sounds from below."|"The Merchants' War"|"Frederik Pohl"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"The Embassy had a hundred and eight on the duty roster—the Veenies were always after us to cut the number in half, but the Ambassador fought them off. He knew what those extra sixty people were there for—of course, so did the Veenies. I was maybe tenth or eleventh in the hierarchy, both because of my consular duties and my side assignment as Morale Officer. This meant that I was the one who selected commercials for the in-house TV circuits and—well—kept an eye on the other hundred and seven for Conservationist leanings. That didn’t take much of my time, though. We were a hand-picked crew. More than half of us were former Agency personnel, and even the consumers were a respectable bunch, for consumers. If anything, some of the young ones were too loyal. There’d been incidents. A couple of the Marine guards, just weeks before, had got a little too much pop-skull into them and flashed eye-resonating commercials at three of the natives with their hand weapons. The Veenies were not amused, and we’d had to put the Marines under house arrest for deportation. They weren’t present now, of course; the eleven o’clock briefing was only for us twenty-five or so seniors. I made sure there was a place next to me when Mitzi came in, late as usual; she glanced at Hay Lopez, sulking by the window, then shrugged and sat down to join the conversation."|"The Merchants' War"|"Frederik Pohl"

  At eight o’clock the next morning I was sitting in the conference room of the prison, across from the Veenie Immigration and Passport Control bureaucrat. “Nice to see you again, Tarb,” he said, unsmiling."|"The Merchants' War"|"Frederik Pohl"

06:00|"six A.M."|"Harriman was all smiles and hospitality once I’d given him what he wanted—or thought he wanted. He insisted I spend the night in his pied-à-terre in the Polar town. I slept badly, having refused his offer of a nightcap or several—I didn’t intend to take chances on spilling information I didn’t want him to have. Also, all night long I kept waking up with that panicky agoraphobic feeling you get when you’re in a place that’s too large. Crazy Veenies! They have to fight for every cubic foot of living space, and yet Harriman had three whole rooms! And in an apartment he didn’t use more than ten nights a year! So I got up early the next morning and by six A.M. I was standing in line at the airport check-in counter. Ahead of me was a teenage Veenie with one of those “patriotic” tee shirts that say Hucks Go Home on the front and No *DV*RT*S*NG on the back—as though “advertising” were a dirty word! I wouldn’t give him the satisfaction of looking at him, so I turned away. Behind me was a short, slim black woman who looked vaguely familiar. “Hello, Mr. Tarb,” she said, amiably enough, and it turned out she was familiar enough—a local fire inspector or something back at the port. She’d toured the Embassy a few times, checking for violations."|"The Merchants' War"|"Frederik Pohl"
"ap 03:30"|"three hours and a half"|"And that was the last I saw of the Chief of Station, and almost the last I saw of anything at all for quite a while—two years and a bit— because the next morning I was hustled out of bed by two Embassy guards, bundled into a station car, hurried to the port, packed into a shuttle. In three hours I was in orbit. In three hours and a half I was lying in a freezer cocoon, waiting for the sleepy drug to put me out and the chill-down to start. The space liner was not due to start its main engines for another nine orbits—more than half a day—but the Ambassador had given orders to get me put away. And get me put away they did."|"The Merchants' War"|"Frederik Pohl"
07:00|"seven A.M."|"It was seven A.M., local time. There weren’t too many people in the terminal yet, which was a plus, but the minus that balanced that in the equation was the lack of baggage handlers. Mitzi trailed sulkily after me to the baggage claim, and there I got a surprise. The surprise’s name was Valentine Dambois, Senior Vice-President and Associate General Manager, pink cheeks, twinkly blue eyes, plump figure jiggling as he hurried across to greet us."|"The Merchants' War"|"Frederik Pohl"
09:00|"Nine A.M."|"Nine A.M. Bright and early. I paid off my pedi-cab, pulled the soot-extractor plugs out of my nostrils and strutted into the main lobby of the huge Taunton, Gatchweiler and Schocken Agency Tower."|"The Merchants' War"|"Frederik Pohl"
"ap 09:58"|two-to-ten|"They all seemed like good ideas. Whether anything would have been left of them in the cold light of dawn I do not know, but I had a powerful reinforcement.

07:00|"seven A.M."|"So I cleaned up quick and got out of the room fast, and by seven A.M. I was up on the campus of Columbia A&P University, poring through the catalog readout and signing up for courses. There were plenty of electives that would count for credit toward the master’s; I picked a sampling of the most interesting. History. Mathematics—that’s sampling techniques, mostly. Even creative writing. I figured that that might be an easy credit, mostly, but I also had it in the back of my mind that if the copy job in Intangibles didn’t come through there might be some use to it. If I weren’t going to be allowed to write anything real, at least I could bang out a few novels. Admittedly, there’s no big bucks there. But there’s always a market, because there’s always a few misfits in the world who can’t get it together enough to watch sports or follow the stories on Omni-V, so they can’t think of anything better to do than read. I’d tried it myself, a time or two, calling up some of the old classics on the tube. It’s a little flaky, but the market is there and it’s no disgrace to pick up some loose change catering to it."|"The Merchants' War"|"Frederik Pohl"
"ap ~ 08:00"|"About eight"|"I decided to deal with it. I didn’t want to kick the habit, because actually each Mokie-Koke in itself was a pretty good thing. They’re actually rather a taste-tingling blend of really good chocolate-type flavoring, along with synthetic coffee extract and some of those cocaine analogues to give it zip. Makes a nice drink. The thing was not to stop, but only to cut down. Put that way, it was a simple problem in schedule making and logistics, like when you schedule an optimal mix of consumer impacts for your advertising spots. Forty Mokes a day was ridiculous. About eight, I reckoned, would be just enough. I’d keep that little lift you get every time, but I wouldn’t jade my taste buds."|"The Merchants' War"|"Frederik Pohl"

What I could do was go back to some tried and true procedures of the past—always good, sometimes overlooked by the new people—and by four that afternoon I had completed my rough. I pulled the spool out of the console and charged into Haseldyne’s office. “Take a look, Des,” I ordered, plugging it into his reader. “Of course this is only preliminary.

Briskly they obeyed; they knew they were on a streak. I reinforced that knowledge. “Let’s talk about money,” I said, and dead silence said they were listening intently. “The job of congressman pays as much as a junior copysmith. Even alderman pays not much less.” There was a sound—not a gasp, but a sort of suspension of breathing as each one of them contemplated the kind of wage that would lift them right out of the consumer class in a single bound. “That’s just salary. That’s only the beginning. The gravy part is the retainers and the consultancies and the directorships—” I didn’t have to say the bribes —“that go along with the position. They can be really big. How big? Well, I happen to know of two senators that sock away as much pay as an account executive.” Thrill from the crowd, and this time the gasps were real. “I’m not going to ask you if you want that, because I don’t think there are any crazy people in this room today. I’m going to tell you how to get it. Three things. Keep your noses clean. Work hard. Do what you’re told.

I forced myself to daydream of the time when I’d be up there on the fifty-fifth floor, with a window in my corner office, and maybe a stall shower … and then, at last, they did it. They made their move. They made it that very Friday, at a quarter past four in the afternoon. I was out at a halfway house for recovering psychoneurotics, looking for an appellate court judge candidate, and when I got back to the Tower it was in an uproar. Everybody was whispering to everybody else, and everybody’s face was thunderstruck.

The kind of news I wanted wasn’t the usual thing—the goggling, blinking, grinning couple who’d won “Consumer of the Month” in Detroit, or the President’s speeches, or the story of six pedicabs destroyed, with loss of eleven lives, when the spire fell off the old Chrysler Building and flattened half a block of Forty-second Street: I mean the real news, the “World of Advertising” report and the daily lineage and spot-time charts. That news came on at six o’clock in the morning, because of the fact that we were halfway around the world, and so I had no hope of seeing it unless I pressed my luck and took yet one more night in the divisional R&R—and, of course, managed to wake myself up in time to get down to the lounge.
