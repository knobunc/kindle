Deer Lick lay on a narrow country road some ninety miles north of Baltimore, and the funeral was scheduled for ten-thirty Saturday morning; so Ira figured they should start around eight. This made him grumpy. (He was not an early-morning kind of man.) Also Saturday was his busiest day at work, and he had no one to cover for him. Also their car was in the body shop. It had needed extensive repairs and Saturday morning at opening time, eight o’clock exactly, was the soonest they could get it back. Ira said maybe they’d just better not go, but Maggie said they had to. She and Serena had been friends forever. Or nearly forever: forty-two years, beginning with Miss Kimmel’s first grade."|"Breathing Lessons"|"Anne Tyler"

"ap 07:00"|seven|"They planned to wake up at seven, but Maggie must have set the alarm wrong and so they overslept. They had to dress in a hurry and rush through breakfast, making do with faucet coffee and cold cereal. Then Ira headed off for the store on foot to leave a note for his customers, and Maggie walked to the body shop. She was wearing her best dress—blue and white sprigged, with cape sleeves—and crisp black pumps, on account of the funeral. The pumps were only medium-heeled but slowed her down some anyway; she was more used to crepe soles. Another problem was that the crotch of her panty hose had somehow slipped to about the middle of her thighs, so she had to take shortened, unnaturally level steps like a chunky little windup toy wheeling along the sidewalk."|"Breathing Lessons"|"Anne Tyler"
"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"“Do you suppose Jesse could have been listening?” Maggie asked. The thought had just occurred to her.
“Jesse? At this hour? He’s doing well if he’s up before noon.”
Maggie didn’t argue with that, although she could have. The fact was that Jesse was an early riser, and anyhow, he worked on Saturdays. What Ira was implying was that he was shiftless. (Ira was much harder on their son than Maggie was. He didn’t see half as many good points to him.) She faced forward and watched the shops and houses sliding past, the few pedestrians out with their dogs. This had been the driest summer in memory and the sidewalks had a chalky look. The air hung like gauze. A boy in front of Poor Man’s Grocery was tenderly dusting his bicycle spokes with a cloth."|"Breathing Lessons"|"Anne Tyler"
06:00|"six o’clock in the morning"|"Serena used to say Ira was a mystery. That was a compliment, in those days. Maggie wasn’t even dating Ira, she was engaged to someone else, but Serena kept saying, “How can you resist him? He’s such a mystery. He’s so mysterious.” “I don’t have to resist him. He’s not after me,” Maggie had said. Although she had wondered. (Serena was right. He was such a mystery.) But Serena herself had chosen the most open-faced boy in the world. Funny old Max! Not a secret in him. “This here is my happiest memory,” Max had said once. (He’d been twenty at the time, just finishing his freshman year at UNC.) “Me and these two fraternity brothers, we go out partying. And I have a tad bit too much to drink, so coming home I pass out in the back seat and when I wake up they’ve driven clear to Carolina Beach and left me there on the sand. Big joke on me: Ha-ha. It’s six o’clock in the morning and I sit up and all I can see is sky, layers and layers of hazy sky that just kind of turn into sea lower down, without the least dividing line. So I stand up and fling off my clothes and go racing into the surf, all by my lonesome. Happiest day of my life.”"|"Breathing Lessons"|"Anne Tyler"

The alarm bell jangled and the code blared over the loudspeaker: “Dr. Red in Room Two-twenty.” This happened in the middle of activity hour—an inconvenient time because the patients were so scattered. Those with any manual dexterity were down in the Crafts Room, knotting colored silk flowers. Those too crippled—Mr. Gabriel, for instance—were taking an extra session of P.T. And of course the bedridden were still in their rooms. They were the easy ones."|"Breathing Lessons"|"Anne Tyler"
19:55|"nineteen fifty-five"|"“That was what they were playing when Max first told me how he felt about me,” Serena said. She lifted a corner of her shawl and delicately blotted the shiny places beneath her eyes. “October twenty-second, nineteen fifty-five. Remember? The Harvest Home Ball. I came with Terry Simpson, but Max cut in.”"|"Breathing Lessons"|"Anne Tyler"
09:00|"nine in the morning"|"This was at the Silver Threads Nursing Home, which hadn’t yet officially opened. It was a brand-new, modern building off Erdman Avenue, with three long wings and one hundred and eighty-two windows. Each of the larger windows had twelve panes of glass; the smaller windows had six. And in the left-hand corner of each pane was a white paper snowflake reading KRYSTAL KLEER MFG. CO. These snowflakes clung to the glass with a force that Maggie had never seen before or since. Whatever substance held them on, she thought later, should have been adopted by NASA. If you peeled off the top layer of paper a lower, fuzzy layer remained, and if you soaked that in hot water and then scraped it with a razor blade there were still gray shreds of rubbery glue, and after those were gone the whole pane, of course, was a mess, finger-printed and streaky, so it had to be sprayed with Windex and buffed with a chamois skin. For one whole summer, from nine in the morning till four in the afternoon, Maggie scraped and soaked and scraped again. The tips of her fingers were continually sore. She felt her nails had been driven back into their roots. She didn’t have anyone to talk to while she worked, because she was the only window-washer they’d hired. Her sole company was the radio, playing “Moonglow” and “I Almost Lost My Mind.”"|"Breathing Lessons"|"Anne Tyler"

"ap 02:00"|two|"Since she’d mailed the letter Monday, it would probably reach Ira’s father Tuesday. So his answer could come on Thursday. She hurried through her work Thursday morning in a fever of impatience. At lunch hour she phoned home, but her mother said the mail hadn’t arrived yet. (She also said, “Why? What are you expecting?” which was the kind of thing that made Maggie long to get married and move out.) At two she phoned again, but her mother said there’d been nothing for her."|"Breathing Lessons"|"Anne Tyler"

Serena drove because Anita said she was too nervous, and since Serena’s skirt billowed over so much of the seat, Maggie and Anita sat in back. Anita was talking nonstop and sprinkling cigarette ashes across the lap of her shiny peach mother-of-the-bride dress. “Now that I think of it Serena I can’t imagine why you’re holding your reception in the Angels of Charity building which is so damn far away and every time I’ve tried to find it I’ve gotten all turned around and had to ask directions from passing strangers …”"|"Breathing Lessons"|"Anne Tyler"

Besides, her thoughts were on something else now. She was caught by an unexpected, piercingly physical memory of bringing the infant Leroy in to Fiona for her 2 a.m. feeding—that downy soft head wavering on Maggie’s shoulder, that birdlike mouth searching the bend of Maggie’s neck inside her bathrobe collar, and then the close, sleep-smelling warmth of Jesse’s and Fiona’s bedroom. “Oh,” she said without meaning to, and then, “Oh!” For there in Mrs. Stuckey’s yard (hard-packed earth, not really a yard at all) stood a wiry little girl with white-blond hair that stopped short squarely at her jawline. She had just let go of a yellow Frisbee, which sailed shuddering toward their car and landed with a thump on the hood as Ira swung into the driveway."|"Breathing Lessons"|"Anne Tyler"
"ap 06:30"|six-thirty|"“You’ll do it? You will? Oh, Jesse, I’m so glad! Let’s say six-thirty,” she told him. “Bye!” and she hung up before he could proceed to some further, more resistant stage."|"Breathing Lessons"|"Anne Tyler"
"ap 08:45"|"quarter till nine"|"Monday morning she went to work as usual at seven but begged off sick at a quarter till nine and drove to Whitside Avenue. The clinic was a remodeled store of some kind, with a curtained plate-glass window. She spotted it first not by its street number but by the knot of picketers outside. There were three women, several children, and a small, dapper man. THIS CLINIC MURDERS THE INNOCENT, one sign said, and another showed a blown-up photo of a beautiful smiling baby with GIVE HER A CHANCE printed in white across her mop of black curls. Maggie parked in front of an insurance agency next door. The picketers glanced over at her and then went back to watching the clinic."|"Breathing Lessons"|"Anne Tyler"
03:00|"3 a.m."|"Daisy and her friends forgot Mrs. Perfect entirely and camped in Maggie’s living room—five dumbstruck, enchanted little girls reverently eyeing Fiona’s stomach. And Fiona played up to them, sometimes inviting them to her room to admire her growing layette, after which she might seat them one by one at the mirror and experiment with their hair. (Her sister was a beautician and had taught Fiona everything she knew, Fiona said.) Then in the evening, if Jesse’s band had an engagement somewhere, he and Fiona would go out together and not return till 2 or 3 a.m., and Maggie, half waking, would hear their whispers on the stairs. The lock on their bedroom door would click stealthily and Maggie would sink back into sleep, contented."|"Breathing Lessons"|"Anne Tyler"

Once, he didn’t even eat supper—just left the minute she told him she wasn’t coming with him, although it was barely 6 p.m. Then Fiona didn’t eat, either, but sat there at the table playing with her food, a tear slipping down her cheek from time to time, and afterward she put on the hooded windbreaker that didn’t button over her stomach anymore and she went for a long, long walk. Or she might have gone to visit her sister; Maggie had no idea.

Daisy reported that Ira was fixing a pancake supper. “No green vegetable?” Maggie asked. “Where’s the green vegetable?” Ira got on the phone to assure her that he was serving spiced crab-apple rings on the side. “Spiced crab-apple rings are not green, Ira,” Maggie said. She felt herself growing weepy. She ought to be at home supervising her family’s nutrition; she ought to be storming the labor room to comfort Fiona; she ought to take Jesse in her arms and rock him because he was nothing but a child still, much too young for what was happening to him. But here she stood, clutching a salty-smelling receiver in a public phone hutch. Her stomach felt all knotted and tight. It hadn’t been so long since she was a patient in the labor room herself, and her muscles recalled it exactly."|"Breathing Lessons"|"Anne Tyler"

He walked Leroy during her fussy spells, and he left his warm bed to burp her and then carry her back to Maggie’s room after the two o’clock feeding. And once, when Maggie took Fiona shopping, he spent a whole Saturday morning solely in charge, returning Leroy none the worse for wear, although the careful way he had dressed her—with her overall straps mistakenly clamping down her collar, severely mashing the double row of ruffles—made Maggie feel sad, for some reason. He claimed that he had never wanted a boy at all; or if he had, he couldn’t remember why. “Girls are perfect,” he said. “Leroy is perfect. Except, you know …”"|"Breathing Lessons"|"Anne Tyler"
