12:00|noon|"Not long after I finished my fish, the sun was squarely overhead. I have never become completely accustomed to a sun that moves across the sky. We speak here of the Long Sun we left and this Short Sun to which we have come; but it seems to me that the difference implied by the change of shape is small, while the difference between this sun which moves and that one which does not is profound. At home, that part of the sun that was directly overhead always appeared brightest; to east and west it was less bright, and the farther you looked the dimmer it became. At noon, the sun here does not look very different; but the Long Sun is fixed, and seems to speak of the immortality of the human spirit. This Short Sun is well named; it speaks daily of the transitory nature of all it sees, drawing for us the pattern of human life, fair at first and growing ever stronger so that we cannot help believing it will continue as it began; but losing strength from the moment it is strongest."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
12:00|noon|"When I left home, I had promised myself that by noon I would tie up at the wharf in New Viron, having supposed, or hoped at least, that the west wind would last. It had been weakening since midmorning, and while I washed my fork and little, red-brown plate, it died away altogether. I lay down in the shade beneath the foredeck and slept."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"< 12:00"|"Nearly noon"|"Nearly noon, although I am writing by lamplight. Gusts that would lay the sloop on her beam ends rock my cracker-box palace, whistling through every lattice and shutter. Green was bigger than a man’s thumb last night when it rose over the willow in the garden, and I was reminded that my people here call it the Devils’ Lantern. Seeing it, I thought only of the inhumi, and not of the storms and the tides, which I in my folly imagined would mean nothing to us in this inland place. I needed a good lesson, and I am getting it, and the whole unhappy town of Gaon with me. Between gusts, I hear my elephant trumpeting in his stall."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"> 12:00"|"A little after noon"|"A little after noon, as I recall, we passed Lizard. Course due north, wind moderate and west by south. I had promised myself that I would stand far out, and I did, and likewise that I would not peer ashore in the hope of catching sight of Nettle or the twins. That promise, as I quickly discovered, was worth very little. I stared, and stood upon the gunwale, and stared some more, and waved. All of it was to no purpose, since I saw no one."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
12:00|noon|"It was noon before we reached it, pushed along at times by faint breezes that never lasted long, and handicapped almost as often by others. I jumped from the sloop to make her fast, and found myself on a moist and resilient turf that was not grass, and that stretched its bright green carpet not merely to the edge of the salt sea, but beyond the edge, extending some considerable distance underneath the water, where it had been crushed and torn by our prow. Nowhere was there a tree, a stump, or a stone-or anything else that I could tie the sloop to. I sharpened a couple of sticks of the green firewood we had gotten the day before, drove them deeply into the soft turf with a third, and moored to them."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
00:00|midnight|"Her face was beautiful, strong, and foreign. By that last, I mean that I had never before seen anyone with her sharp chin, very high cheekbones, and tilted eyes. Her skin was as white as foam in those days, which made her lips a blazing scarlet and her midnight-blue eyes darker than the night. I noticed her nakedness first, as I suppose any man would, and then the length of her legs and the womanly contours of her body, and only then the gold she wore. It was not until she released her hold on the backstay and waved, very shyly and tentatively, with her left hand that I realized that her right arm had been amputated just below the shoulder. “Hello?” Her voice was just above the threshold of audibility. And again: “Hello?”"|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
12:00|noon|"Soon I was to gaze upon the sea goddess of the Vanished People. Perhaps she was Scylla in another form, as Silk once confided to me that Kypris was becoming another form of the Outsider, whose many forms had spoken to Silk that unforgettable noon on the ball court as a crowd speaks, while one whispered to his right ear and another to his left."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"The wind picked up before noon, and we cracked along in a way that had me plotting to spread more sail. I was ever a careful, cautious sailor, as I have implied. But the cautious sailor must avoid the sunken rock of overcaution, and it was apparent that additional sail would speed us on our way without endangering us."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
12:00|midday|"He volunteered to read my future in the stars. I declined, pointing out that it was midday and that even if he went outside he would not be able to see them. He insisted that he knew their positions even when he could not, unrolling a score of big charts, and launching into a convoluted recitation that nobody understood."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
00:00|midnight|"Somewhere she is singing for me at this moment, singing as she used to before Krait came. I hear her, as I do almost every day, although she must surely be many hundreds of leagues away. I hear her-and when I do not I dream of my home beside the sea. Of it and of you, Nettle my darling, my only dearest, the sweetheart of my youth. But if ever I find my way back to it (as Seawrack has beyond any question found her way back to the waves and the spume, the secret currents, and her black, wave-washed rocks) there will come a stormy midnight when I throw off the blankets, although you and the twins are soundly sleeping. I will put out then in whatever boat I can find, and you will not see me more. Do not mourn me, Nettle. Every man must die, and I know what death I long for."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"He pointed west again. “See that notch in the mountains?”
I nodded. It was ten leagues at least.
“A little river runs through there, coming pretty well straight toward us. If you look carefully, you can see the sun on it through the trees here and there.”"|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 12:00"|"About noon"|"About noon (squinting up at the sun every chance I got kept me very conscious of the passage of time) we struck the little river and stopped to drink. Its water was clean and cold and good. Seawrack asked, “Are we going to follow this now?” and I told her we were."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
12:00|noon|"A note reports that four of our prisoners have killed themselves. This must be stopped. I have ordered the remaining prisoners brought here to me by noon tomorrow. I want another look at them."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"Second, they think the whole war is a plot to make them lose their land. They are small farmers for the most part, just like our own troopers, and one of them accused Evensong (Chota) to her face, calling her the Man’s woman and making her furiously angry. She tried to get me to have him killed. I told her he is precious to me, and have asked for a truce instead."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"As I penned that last, it struck me that I ought to send for the head gardener as well. I have been wondering how I could get a spade, and a bar of some kind to pry up the stones. He can supply them both, and it should be safer than having Evensong buy them for me in the market. I have seen him at work often, a silent old man with a faded blue headcloth and a big white mustache. Both the younger gardeners are away fighting, and he will be having a difficult time of it, poor old fellow. He should be eager to get on my good side."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"I had just gotten into bed and closed my eyes, when here was Evensong slipping under the bedclothes beside me, quite naked except for a good deal of the sandlewood scent I gave her the other day. I thought that she must have hidden in my room when I believed she had gone out, and told her sternly that she must not do it; but she says she climbed in through a window. She wanted to go too, and since I had already told her something about the other matter I said she could. Her gratitude knew no bounds."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"We rose before the sun, dressed, got a little fruit to eat on the way, and were off. I had asked Hari Mau to find me a trooper who knew the forest, and he had-but Merciful Molpe, he was only a boy. He had a slug gun and swore that he was fifteen, but I would guess him thirteen at most. It was crowded on the elephant with my six guards (all big men) and their weapons, Evensong, “Trooper“ Darjan, and me. I was glad to get off."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"It seemed that the elephant had little experience of such places, but he learned his business quickly. After the first hour or so, he was going faster than Darjan, so that Darjan, whom we had brought along to guide us, was in danger of being trodden flat. I had told Mahawat to watch me and go where I did, but the elephant learned how to do that before Mahawat did, keeping the tip of one trunk touching my headcloth and padding along behind me with surprisingly little noise. We had struck the tent before setting out; but Evensong and my guards had a rough time of it just the same, having to lie flat on the platform and fend off the limbs and twigs any way they could."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"I got back up then, very glad of a chance to sit down after all the walking I had done, and told Mahawat he would have to get us back under the trees where we could not be seen. Mahawat agreed, but the elephant did not. When he realized that we wanted him to go back into the forest, he rebelled, charging up the road like an eight-legged talus while trumpeting with both trunks in a way that I found frightening myself and that absolutely terrified poor Evensong. I suppose I have heard as many women scream as most men have, and I may even have heard more than most men, having heard a good many wounded Trivigaunti troopers when Nettle and I fought for General Mint; but Evensong’s scream is in a class by itself. It is louder and shriller than the scream of any other woman I have ever met with, and it lasts two or three times longer."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"Nettle, I know that you will never read this, nor would I wish you to; but I am going to pretend you will. Try to imagine us, my six guards, Evensong, Mahawat, and me (with Darjan lost in the dust behind us), holding on to anything and everything in reach and every one of us about to fall off, as we rounded a turn in the road and found ourselves among three or four hundred Hannese lancers."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"Evensong came. This time I watched her slip through my window. When peace returns (if it does) I’m going to have another sentry in the garden. Or bars on these windows. Bars would be more practical, I suppose, but I cannot forget how I hated the bars on the windows of my manse."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"As I now have. We will go soon. I will wake Evensong and give her the note I have prepared, a blank piece of paper with a seal. She will leave by the window, bring her note to the sentry at my door, and demand to be admitted. He will refuse. I will open my door (pretending that their voices have awakened me), look at her paper, get dressed, and leave with her. We will meet the head gardener at the lower gate."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"Evensong is as young-I would not be surprised if she were a year or two younger. Nettle was never beautiful or even pretty, but my heart melted each time she smiled. It would melt again if I could see her smile tonight."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"I have been pacing up and down this big bedroom. This palatial bedroom my oppressors built for me. Pacing in my slippers, so as not to wake Evensong or let the guard at my door know I am awake. When I came here I was a prisoner-a prisoner who was respected, true. I was treated with great kindness and even reverence by Hari Mau and his friends, but I was a prisoner just the same. I knew it, and so did they."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"Lastly, Evensong and all the people of Han. Say that she counts only as a wife, that she means no more to me than Chandi. Does she mean less? She has a mother and a father, brothers and sisters, two uncles and three aunts, all of whom she loves. They are at the mercy of a tyrant, and if Gaon loses or surrenders they will remain at his mercy."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"Before I begin, however, I ought to write about what the three of us did last night. That, at least, will not take long. Everything went as planned-Evensong bringing the note, and so on. The head gardener was there to meet us, leading a scrawny, docile old cow. Off we splashed through the warm rain. Prying up the stone was a good deal more difficult than I had anticipated, I having seen four workmen handle those stones without much trouble. I do not think the gardener and I could have managed without Evensong’s help. With it, we scarcely got it up. He dug. He has been digging all his life, and he knows his business."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"Evensong and I tried to talk to her. (I had meant for Evensong to keep watch, but it was raining so hard that I could scarcely see the cow. She could not have seen someone coming until he bumped into her.) It was hopeless; the inhuma was too weak to speak a word. I put her on the cow’s back and pressed her mouth to the unlucky cow’s neck. I have washed my hands a dozen times since."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"The rain stopped in an instant, the way rain often does here. At one moment it was pouring. At the next the only drops that fell were those that trickled from the roofs of the shops around the market square. At that instant the inhuma slipped off the old cow’s back, and when her feet touched stone there was no inhuma. In her place stood a woman a little taller than Evensong, an emaciated woman with burning eyes whose hairless skull somehow conveyed the impression of lank reddish hair. I put my chain around her neck and snapped the lock, and for an instant felt something quite different."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"We did, and before the work was complete Evensong and I were ready to jump out of our skins when Mehman dropped his spade. I had intended to talk to the inhuma there, but had assumed that the rain would continue; it would have been madness to do it when the rain had stopped. After a little discussion we decided to go to Mehman’s cottage, at the farther end of my garden."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"He and Evensong waited outside while I explained what I had learned from Krait on Green. I tapped the window when I had finished, and they came in again. “Will you do whatever we tell you, if I release you?” I asked the inhuma. “Or shall I make good on my threat?”"|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"She said nothing in reply, her face buried in her hands-a naked, hairless, reptilian thing in woman’s shape, stripped for the moment of all her pride. Mehman and Evensong positioned their chairs a half step behind mine and sat in silence, watching her."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"“Tea for the rani?” He bowed to Evensong; when I was newly come it never occurred to me that my wives would be awarded the title of the ruler of Trivigaunte."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"“Tea for the rani?” He bowed to Evensong; when I was newly come it never occurred to me that my wives would be awarded the title of the ruler of Trivigaunte.
Evensong nodded and smiled, and Mehman bowed again and bustled away.
“I’d ask you how long you were in the ground under that stone, if I thought you knew,” I told our prisoner, “but I don’t see how you could.”"|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"She shook her head more vigorously, so much so that the chain clanked and rattled. “It would be worth nothing at all as long as I have to wear this. Take it away, and my oath will bind me.”
I got out the key, but Evensong caught my hand.
The inhuma began, “You were surprised that I didn’t want to know why you had-had…”"|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"“I wasn’t free. You had locked this thing around my neck. Take it away.”
Motioning for Evensong to remain where she was, I did.
“I will obey you in all things, Rajan,” the inhuma declared. She rubbed her neck as if the chain had chafed it, and although they were faint I could see scales where pores should have been. I glanced at the window, and found that it was gray now instead of black."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"Evensong made a little sound of displeasure. “I don’t like it either,” I said, “but what else can I do? Kill her after she’s fought for us?”"|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"Evensong said, “Pehla showed me one of those. They catch insects with their tongues.”"|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"Evensong introduced herself. I explained to her that I had not inquired about the inhuma’s name because I knew that any name she gave us would be false, at which the inhuma said, “Then my name in this town of yours shall be False. Is that how you say it?” Mehman came in just then with my water, soap, and towel. “I have no tray, Rajan. I am shamed.”"|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"“Look at him carefully. Neither Evensong nor I are typical of the mass of people here, but he is. He is a typical citizen of our town, tall and dark, with a nose, eyes, mouth, and so on quite a bit like mine.”"|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"Evensong said, “Suppose another inhuma comes here and hurts someone. We might think it was her.”"|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"“We might indeed. Because we might she will warn the other inhumi to keep away, if she is wise. Jahlee, Evensong is from a different town, a foreign town called Han, with which our own town is at war. She is a young woman of Han, more attractive than most.”"|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"The starved and empty eyes fastened upon Evensong’s face. “I understand, Rajan.”"|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"“I am your slave. But it would be better if I had clothes.” With both hands, she smoothed her starved body, a body that appeared wholly human. “A wig or headdress of some sort, too. Powder, rouge, and scent.”
I glanced at Evensong, who nodded and hurried out.
“A few gauds, Rajan, if it’s not asking too much.”"|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"Mehman re-entered with a steaming teapot and two cups, and I assured him that Evensong would be back soon."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"“When you have done something sufficiently impressive that you feel that word of it is bound to reach me, return here. My palace is in the same garden as this cottage. If it’s a court day, come to court. If it isn’t, ask for Evensong, who is also called Chota.”"|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"“See that they do not. If what you have done really is a major stroke, you and I, with Mehman here and Evensong, will rescue a second member of your race just as the three of us rescued you, and on the same conditions. He or she will be sent against the Horde of Han exactly as you are being sent. When either of you achieves a major success, a third will be rescued. And so on.”"|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"Soon after that, Evensong returned. She had a crimson silk gown over one arm and was carrying two elaborately inlaid boxes. “There are shoes in here,” she told Jahlee, handing her one, “and a good ivory bracelet and my second-best ivory ring. Women in Han don’t wear a lot of brass bangles the way women do here.”"|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"“That’s not the good perfume you gave me,” Evensong told me. “It’s what they gave me in Han when they sent me here.” As she spoke, a heavy, spicy fragrance filled the room. “You don’t need that much,” she cautioned Jahlee."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"“Here’s a woman’s traveling hat.” Evensong opened the other box and took it out. It was wide and flat, rather like an oversized saucer or a wide soup bowl of tightly plaited white straw turned upside down."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"“Most people are still asleep.” I turned to Evensong. “Will you give her that box to keep the cosmetics in?”"|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"She did, favoring the humble woman and her little son with a flashing smile in which no actual teeth were to be seen, and running across the soft green grass with one hand clapped to the traveling hat and Evensong’s gown flowing and floating around her."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"His daughter looked askance at Evensong and me, plainly dressed and soaked to the skin, before bowing almost to the ground."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"Evensong surprised me by saying, “She is a thief and worse than a thief.”"|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"My wound seems worse, Evensong says from the rain but I think it is actually from the strain of lifting that big flagstone in the market. Maybe it is for the best that we have no news about Jahlee."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"There was a long silence after that. Sinew took advantage of it to get himself another strip of smoked meat, and I am going to take advantage of it now to get a little sleep before Jahlee and Evensong come."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
00:00|midnight|"Heavy rain from midnight on, which gave us good cover. I did not go out or even get up this morning, although my wound seems better-breakfast in bed from a tray, and so forth. Hari Mau talked with me as I lay in bed, stamping up and down the room and more than ready to fall upon the Hannese that very moment. He had ridden half the morning with a rain-soaked, bloodstained bandage where his white headcloth ought to be, and is planning a major attack as soon as the rainy season ends. Our enemies are weaker than they look, he says, and I pray to the Outsider and any other god who may read this that he is correct. He swears that if I could talk with his new prisoners I would agree."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"I have sent Evensong to buy a boat for me, telling her that it will be used by a spy whose identity I cannot reveal. When she has come back and the palace is asleep, I will go. I am still too ill to ride far, I fear; but I will be able to manage a small boat, or hope I will."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"No, I most certainly will not. Evensong may return from her errand at any minute. She can tell me where it is docked, and I will give her an hour to get to sleep. An hour at most, then I will leave Gaon forever."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"Having written that, I cannot help adding that the very same things might be said with equal justice about the people of Han. They are argumentative and love to shout their displeasure at others (I have seen something of it in Evensong) but that does not mean they are vindictive, and in fact they are the exact reverse, quick to laugh and forgive everything and be friends again. They deserve a far better government than the Man’s."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"Still no Evensong. I have been talking with Oreb, who has flown over this entire whorl-or says he has. When we fall silent I can hear Seawrack, faint and far, her voice keeping time with the beating of the waves."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"If Evensong can climb up, I can climb down, surely, weak though I feel. I will leave my door locked, and they will think I am sleeping late. Very likely no one will venture to knock before noon, and by then I will be far away. When this account halts in the middle of a word, you are to understand that Evensong has returned with news of the boat that I sent her to buy."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"If Evensong can climb up, I can climb down, surely, weak though I feel. I will leave my door locked, and they will think I am sleeping late. Very likely no one will venture to knock before noon, and by then I will be far away. When this account halts in the middle of a word, you are to understand that Evensong has returned with news of the boat that I sent her to buy."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"“Bad thing!” says Oreb. “Thing fly!” So there are inhumi about, just as in Pajarocu. I do not believe they will attack Evensong, whom they all know. But what a thought! If only we protected one another, they would all be idiots or worse. As it is, they always get enough to keep them going."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"I put my head out the window and tried to see them, although I would have been horrified if I had. The azoth is in my sash, next to Princess Choora. (I wonder how she likes her company?) No needier, but that should be more than enough. I am inclined to take my sword as well. I cannot cut firewood on a boat with the azoth-it would sink her at the first attempt. When I’m not using my sword, I can stow it on the boat, provided Evensong finds one for me. How I wish that I had the black-bladed sword the Neighbor gave me now!"|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"I wish that I had been able to choose the boat for myself, too. Evensong’s choice will be too large, almost certainly. Sinew crossed the western sea in a boat that would scarcely carry Nettle and me, with a few bales of paper."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"If Evensong does not buy one at all, I will send somebody else tomorrow night. Jahlee? Old Mehman would surely be better. The inhumi do not understand such things, even when they make use of them."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"Oreb has been pulling my hair. “Go now? Go Silk?” (Or perhaps it is “Go, Silk!” I cannot be sure.) I feel exactly as he does, but Evensong still has not returned. I am going to try to snatch an hour’s sleep."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"He swore that he would, and we shook hands; and after that I hugged him as I had when he was a child.
Evensong has returned!
Just a moment ago I heard the sentries at the main entrance challenge her, and her reply. Time presses."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"Evensong has bought me a boat that sounds like it is exactly the sort I need. She smiled proudly as she described it, and even borrowed this quill and a sheet of paper so that she could sketch it for me, small enough for me to handle alone and even row if need be, with a little shelter like a hut at the waist, and a mast that can be taken down, or put up by one man to spread a small sail. It is newly painted, she says; crimson and black, which in Han are thought to be the luckiest colors."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"After what I wrote last night, what right do I have to take up the quill again? None, to be honest; but it will be two or three pages at most. I am going to write as long as we are in quiet water, but no longer. Evensong wants to trim the little sail and steer, and this is an opportunity for her to learn. (I am pretending not to watch her.)"|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"What Nettle will make of Evensong-or make of me for bringing her home with me-I cannot conceive; and yet I am very glad that she is here. I have told her several times (too many, she says) that I am not the ruler of New Viron. She said she always wanted to be a farmer’s wife. I explained that I am no farmer, that I tried farming and failed at it, that my wife and I have built a mill where we make paper. And she told me that was even nicer."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"We have lines, hooks, long cane poles, sinkers and bobbers, and even a landing net. It appears that the previous owner used this boat for fishing, mostiy. I have baited my hook with a scrap I pulled from the meat Evensong bought, and we shall see."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"“May Scintillating Scylla and all the gods smile upon you, my daughter,” I told Evensong a moment ago. It is Scylsday; and I am an augur of Viron once more, at least in appearance, having left off my headcloth and shortened my hair with Choora. I never went to the schola, but I heard so much about it as a boy that at times I feel I did, for a year or three at least, long, long ago."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"Evensong keeps us to the middle, or wherever the current is strongest, leaning her slight weight this way or that against the steering oar. “Good boat,” Oreb repeats; and then “Fish heads?” The banks are lined with trees so tall that I cannot catch sight of the summits of the mountains, trees that might almost be the savage trees of Green, although it may be only that the summits are lost in mist. Just before the fish bit, I saw something better, a felwolf that had come to the river to drink."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"< 16:30"|"before Evensong"|"This quill is exactly like the ones I used to tie in bundles of thirteen for my father, binding each bundle tightly but not too tightly and knotting the soft blue twine. I wish I had seen the bundle before Evensong cut it for me and put the quills into the old pen case I brought here."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"With nothing better to do than fish and catalogue the slow changes of the river, I have been thinking about my sons-about Krait on the lander, particularly. They caught him and forced open his mouth. I saved him, and thought that I had lost him forever when he joined the other inhumi barricaded in the cockpit. I wish that he were here now, here in this little boat with Evensong and me."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"Evensong asks if it will be all right to stop when she sees a clearing. She wants to prepare my fish for us and cook some rice, she says. If I am any judge of women, she really wants to try the pots and pans she bought for us, enough to cook for all the men on Strik’s big boat. In any case, I said she might; it will be hours before she sights the perfect spot, I feel sure, and we will both be hungry."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"“Fly good!” He flew from my shoulder to Evensong’s and back, a graphic demonstration."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"I offered to take over the steering and give Evensong a chance to rest, if she would tend my pole; but she refused. “You won’t stop no matter how pretty the place is, and I’m hungry.”"|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"I look at Evensong sleeping, and think again: yellow and pink are the most beautiful of colors. We cooked and ate, and made love among the flowers. I will catch another fish or two for her while she sleeps. We will eat a second time under the stars, and sleep. Rise early and travel on. I wish I could be certain that New Viron is on the coast of the sea to which this Nadi of ours runs. I believe it must be, but I cannot be sure."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"“This is very bad.” Evensong shook her head; she may have been frightened-no doubt she was-but her impassive face showed nothing."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"As we embraced beside the fire, Evensong whispered, “You know their secret. You could destroy them.”"|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"I believe he shrugged; the Short Sun was nearly dead ahead then, and in the near darkness of Number One Freight Bay it was difficult to be sure. “There are only two needlers, and I’ve bent some needles in one.”
Evensong shook my shoulder. “You must tell me.”
“I won’t break my oath. My son confided it to me as he lay dying. If I were to betray him now, I would have to die, too, because I couldn’t live with myself.”"|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"“It was a mere lie at first, Evensong. Something to tell people in Wichote and Pajarocu who wanted to know why Krait was with us. It remained a lie as long as there was no danger to Krait but me, and none to me but Krait. Once the lander took off everything changed, and Krait and I discovered that we merely supposed we had been lying.”"|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"“Krait tried to divert the lander to the Whorl, but he couldn’t-it was already too late. He promised me that Sinew and I would not be drained. On Green they have thousands of human slaves whose blood they take only rarely, as long as the slaves can work and fight for them.”
Evensong trembled in my arms.
“Krait told me why they have to have it as he lay dying. He didn’t intend to give me power over them, you understand. I’m certain he wasn’t thinking of that in his final moments. He was thinking of the thing that linked him to me, and me to him-of the bond of blood between us.”"|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"Evensong murmured, “Tell me. You must tell me, my husband. My only ever lover. You must tell me tonight.”"|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"They were circling above us, I knew, and sometimes they flew so low that I could actually feel the wind from their wings upon my face. I decided that they might well overhear anything we said, and I counseled myself to keep that in mind each time I spoke.
“You must tell me!” Evensong demanded.
“I must not-that is the truth, the fact of our situation. They know that I know; I’ve proved it to them. They also know that you don’t, that you know where the others are buried but do not know the secret they would die to protect. They have to kill me, or feel that they do, even though I’ve sworn never to reveal it.”"|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"Eventually we went back to the boat and lay down in its little hut of plaited straw, leaving our fire to die. Evensong fell asleep almost at once. I prayed, not on my knees as I felt I should (the hut was too low for that) but lying on my back next to her. Every so often I crawled outside with my azoth, looked up the sky, fingered the demon, and crawled back into the hut as before. Tired as I was (and I was very tired, having slept for only an hour that afternoon), I was striving to convince myself that I was protecting us-protecting her-in some unclear way."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
12:00|noon|"Last night I dreamed that Pig, Hound, and I ran into an abandoned house to get out of the rain. It seemed familiar, and I set off to explore it. I saw a clock-I think the very large one that stood in the corner of my bedroom in Gaon-and the hands were on twelve. I knew that it was noon, not midnight, although the windows were as black as pitch. I turned away, the clock opened, and Olivine stepped out of it. “This is where you lived with… This is where you lived with Hyacinth,” she told me. Then Hyacinth herself was beside me in sunshine. Together we were chopping nettles from around the hollyhocks. Hyacinth was fourteen or fifteen, and already breathtakingly lovely; but in some fashion I knew that she was terribly ill and would soon die. She smiled at me and I woke. For a long time the only thing I could think of was that Hyacinth was dead."|"On Blue's Waters"|"Gene Wolfe"
