“Just be home for dinner at seven.”
“Okay.”"|"Necessary Roughness"|"Marie G. Lee"
"ap 06:00"|six|"“Let me remind you, gentlemen,” said Coach, as we all lay sprawled out like lawn ornaments. Kearny made us get up and move around. “Our first game is next week. Two-a-days start tomorrow. Kindly get your butts to the locker room before six.”"|"Necessary Roughness"|"Marie G. Lee"
05:30|"five thirty in the morning"|"At five thirty in the morning it is dark. Like opaque dark. I thrashed around for my football stuff, clothes to change into, grabbed my book bag, and headed downstairs."|"Necessary Roughness"|"Marie G. Lee"
"ap 05:45"|"five forty-five"|"I was out the door by five forty-five. The back of my teeth felt a little fuzzy—I’d forgotten to brush them. No big deal. In football, a certain amount of seasoning is required."|"Necessary Roughness"|"Marie G. Lee"
"ap 01:02"|One-two|"“Hup!” Jimmi ran out. I charged. His waist felt like a tree. It was like bringing down a water buffalo. One-two. I did it."|"Necessary Roughness"|"Marie G. Lee"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"“Hey, Chan.” An unexpectedly deep voice behind me. ALL-PRO. “Sorry to break up the party, but Leland’s going back into town. Didn’t you say you needed to get back in before eleven?”"|"Necessary Roughness"|"Marie G. Lee"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"“Hey, Chan.” An unexpectedly deep voice behind me. ALL-PRO. “Sorry to break up the party, but Leland’s going back into town. Didn’t you say you needed to get back in before eleven?”
I checked my watch. It was ten forty-five.
Abogee and O-Ma would be coming back from the store around eleven thirty."|"Necessary Roughness"|"Marie G. Lee"

08:00|"eight in the morning"|"Opening day. I had been at Froggie’s since eight in the morning polishing, stacking, mopping—you name it. I ran hot water through the Slurpee machine and the most amazing iridescent colors came out."|"Necessary Roughness"|"Marie G. Lee"
"ap 07:30"|"seven thirty"|"A fair number of people came in that day to check out the store, and everyone bought something, at least a quart of milk or some bread. Young and I worked until seven thirty; then O-Ma came in to take over."|"Necessary Roughness"|"Marie G. Lee"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"“We’re going to have a conditioning workout tomorrow at eight,” said Kearny. “So go home early and get some sleep.”"|"Necessary Roughness"|"Marie G. Lee"
00:00|midnight|"I think the store must have been doing halfway decent, because Abogee hired a night manager, Greg, so that Froggie’s 24-Hour Express could start living up to its full name. Before, we were closing at midnight. O-Ma also declared that she would take Young and me to the mall in Little Moon Bay so we could get real jackets, now that the temperature was only in the forties and fifties during the day. I said I’d wait for my letter jacket, which, the coaches said, we juniors would get early this year so we could wear them to the state tournament. God willing."|"Necessary Roughness"|"Marie G. Lee"
"ap 07:30"|"seven thirty"|"“We’re doing the dinner a little earlier this year so you juniors can get your letter jackets. Also, because we want you to spend a little quality time with your old men before we concentrate on practice. It will be this Saturday at the VFW, seven thirty. That means coats and ties, for the uninitiated.”"|"Necessary Roughness"|"Marie G. Lee"
"ap 03:00"|three|"After the morning practice I was half asleep all day.
When I woke up at three, it was time to do it all over again.
After that I just wanted to soak in Mrs. Knutson’s tub. Sometimes Young would sit outside the door talking or playing me a new song she’d learned."|"Necessary Roughness"|"Marie G. Lee"
"ap ~ 01:00"|"about one o’clock"|"When O-Ma and Abogee came home at about one o’clock, we were still up playing. They were like, oh, you’re still up, but they seemed glad to see us, like the vision of Young and me playing cards in the living room of a borrowed home was just about the best thing in the world."|"Necessary Roughness"|"Marie G. Lee"
"ap 05:30"|"five thirty"|"“She’s out with Donna,” O-Ma said. “She should be home by five thirty.”"|"Necessary Roughness"|"Marie G. Lee"
"ap 05:45"|"five forty-five"|"*  *  *
At five forty-five O-Ma joked about withholding dinner from Young.
But she didn’t return by six, or six thirty. She was never late. Always “on the dot,” as Mrs. Knutson would say. She always called."|"Necessary Roughness"|"Marie G. Lee"
"ap 05:30"|"Five thirty"|"Five thirty. Time to go to practice. Two-a-days and weight training. We have a long journey ahead of us, Coach said in my dream. Might as well enjoy the ride."|"Necessary Roughness"|"Marie G. Lee"
"ap 07:00"|"Seven o’clock"|"I blinked. Football didn’t mean the same thing to me anymore. What was different? I was tired. So tired.
Seven o’clock. Time to get up for school.
Seven thirty. Need to leave for school."|"Necessary Roughness"|"Marie G. Lee"
