She had read the mail to decide which of the approximately three to four hundred pieces warranted personal answers and had prepared an hour-by-hour summary of the week. Renira was British, and her voice could emasculate a phone caller by the final syllable of “Hello?” As a media figure, Banion believed it was his duty to have a listed telephone number. As a practical matter, he found this a colossal nuisance."|"Little Green Men"|"Christopher Buckley"

Now, while you were on the phone with Mr. Stimple, Mr. Mint called with another date. American Free-Ranging Poultry Farmers. He says they’re rather lefty.”"|"Little Green Men"|"Christopher Buckley"

"ap < 01:00"|"just before one o’clock"|"On Saturday, just before one o’clock, Banion was changing in the men’s locker room, ruminating on the Sunday segment he had taped yesterday with Erhardt Williger. The topic—Russia, naturally. Williger, former secretary of state, and now adviser to nations and corporations the world over, took the view that President Blebnikov’s belligerent, irredentist growlings about taking Alaska back were just to placate the hard-liners in his own party. He had no intention of sending the Russian fleet willy-nilly across the water. “Anyvey,” Williger said in his plummy Hungarian accent, “From vat I have seen, I am not convinced deir Navy could make it across the Volga River, much less de Bering Strait.”"|"Little Green Men"|"Christopher Buckley"

She had called his hotel room all night long, getting no answer. The next morning, Banion explained to her that after his speech to the car dealers, he’d been too afraid to spend the night alone in his room—what if the aliens came back for him? He stayed all night in the hotel’s lobby, hovering nervously near cleaning women, night clerks, and other nonplussed security personnel, who, toward 4:00 A.M., finally alerted the assistant manager that one of the guests was acting strangely and might suddenly produce a gun and start shooting up the lobby."|"Little Green Men"|"Christopher Buckley"
