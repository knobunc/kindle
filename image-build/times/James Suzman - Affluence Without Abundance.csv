"ap ~ 01:50"|"around 150"|"Throughout the military occupation of Nyae Nyae, around 150 Ju/’hoansi out of a total adult population of some 1,000 people served in the South African army at any one time. All who joined up pocketed the equivalent of $600 USD every month in addition to various combat bonuses. This translates into around $2,000 USD per month by 2015 standards. All of this income was disposable. No Ju/’hoansi in Nyae Nyae had regular overheads like rent, school fees, or a utility bill. Additionally, because the military also provided military families in Nyae Nyae with food rations in the form of maize porridge, oil, sugar, and meat, they also didn’t have to spend much on food. Despite this, only a few soldiers saved any of their money. Many blew the bulk of their salaries within hours of being issued them by the paymaster general in cash-stuffed brown envelopes. With the bottle shop usually the first stop after the paymaster’s truck, many Ju/’hoan soldiers recall paydays when they awoke in the night to discover they were penniless, with nothing to show for the preceding month’s soldiering."|"Affluence Without Abundance"|"James Suzman"
17:50|1750|"European ambitions for land and labor could not tolerate the presence of people disinterested in trade or formalized labor exchange. By 1750 the colony had expanded several hundred miles inland. By then most of the fifteen thousand or so indigenous Khoisan living in the southern Cape at the time the Dutch arrived had been driven away or wiped out by disease, most notably a small pox epidemic that struck in 1713. The few who remained were attached to European households as slaves, herders, and domestic servants."|"Affluence Without Abundance"|"James Suzman"
17:00|"17.1 hours"|"Lee also wanted to get a better sense of how hard the Ju/’hoansi worked to get their food as part of a simple energy input and output equation. He established that on average during this survey period healthy adult Ju/’hoansi worked 17.1 hours per week on food collecting, with that number skewed upward by hunting trips, which almost always took up much more time than gathering excursions. For women, the workweek rarely exceeded twelve hours."|"Affluence Without Abundance"|"James Suzman"
19:04|1904|"In spring of 1904 the German zoologist, linguist, anatomist, and philosopher Leonard Schultze was having the adventure of a lifetime. He had spent several months traveling to German South-West Africa (now Namibia). In addition to evaluating the fishing potential of Namibian coasted waters on behalf of the German colonial office, he hoped to collect a range of zoological specimens to take back to Germany. But his plans were upset by the outbreak of war that year as the German colonial authorities sought at first to subdue and then exterminate the two most powerful peoples in central Namibia, the Nama and the Herero. The Nama were descendants of indigenous cattle- and sheep-herding populations in the Cape of Good Hope on Africa’s southern tip. By 1904, they had adopted Western dress, weapons, and religion. The Herero were a pastoralist people who had dominated much of central Namibia from the eighteenth century onward. Determined not to let what became the most brutal colonial genocide of the twentieth century ruin his trip, Schultze reported cheerfully that instead of collecting zoological specimens while battle raged he would instead “make use of the victims of the war to take parts from fresh native corpses” for the “study of the living body.”"|"Affluence Without Abundance"|"James Suzman"
