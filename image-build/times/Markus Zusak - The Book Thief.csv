"< 12:00"|"just before
  midday"|"They held hands.

  

  A final, soaking farewell was let go of, and they turned and left the cemetery, looking back
  several times.

  

  As for me, I remained a few moments longer.

  

  I waved.

  

  No one waved back.

  

  Mother and daughter vacated the cemetery and made their way toward the next train to
  Munich.

  

  Both were skinny and pale.

  

  Both had sores on their lips.

  

  Liesel noticed it in the dirty, fogged-up window of the train when they boarded just before
  midday. In the written words of the book thief herself, the journey continued like
  everything had happened.

  

  When the train pulled into the Bahnhof in Munich, the passengers slid out as if from a
  torn package. There were people of every stature, but among them, the poor were the most easily
  recognized. The impoverished always try to keep moving, as if relocating might help. They ignore
  the reality that a new version of the same old problem will be waiting at the end of the tripthe
  relative you cringe to kiss.

  

  I think her mother knew this quite well. She wasnt delivering her children to the higher echelons
  of Munich, but a foster home had apparently been found, and if nothing else, the new family could
  at least feed the girl and the boy a little better, and educate them properly.

  

  The boy.

  

  Liesel was sure her mother carried the memory of him, slung over her shoulder. She dropped him.
  She saw his feet and legs and body slap the platform.

  

  How could that woman walk?

  

  How could she move?

  

  Thats the sort of thing Ill never know, or comprehendwhat humans are capable of.

  

  She picked him up and continued walking, the girl clinging now to her side.

  

  Authorities were met and questions of lateness and the boy raised their vulnerable heads. Liesel
  remained in the corner of the small, dusty office as her mother sat with clenched thoughts on a
  very hard chair.

  

  There was the chaos of goodbye.

  

  It was a goodbye that was wet, with the girls head buried into the woolly, worn shallows of her
  mothers coat. There had been some more dragging.

  

  Quite a way beyond the outskirts of Munich, there was a town called Molching, said best by the
  likes of you and me as Molking. Thats where they were taking her, to a street by the name of
  Himmel."|"The Book Thief"|"Markus Zusak"
"ap 01:00"|one|"Shed heard it several times in the past few years.

  

  Communist.

  

  There were boardinghouses crammed with people, rooms filled with questions. And that word. That
  strange word was always there somewhere, standing in the corner, watching from the dark. It wore
  suits, uniforms. No matter where they went, there it was, each time her father was mentioned. She
  could smell it and taste it. She just couldnt spell or understand it. When she asked her mother
  what it meant, she was told that it wasnt important, that she shouldnt worry about such things.
  At one boardinghouse, there was a healthier woman who tried to teach the children to write, using
  charcoal on the wall. Liesel was tempted to ask her the meaning, but it never eventuated. One
  day, that woman was taken away for questioning. She didnt come back.

  

  When Liesel arrived in Molching, she had at least some inkling that she was being saved, but that
  was not a comfort. If her mother loved her, why leave her on someone elses doorstep? Why?
  Why?

  

  Why?

  

  The fact that she knew the answerif only at the most basic levelseemed beside the point. Her
  mother was constantly sick and there was never any money to fix her. Liesel knew that. But that
  didnt mean she had to accept it. No matter how many times she was told that she was loved, there
  was no recognition that the proof was in the abandonment. Nothing changed the fact that she was a
  lost, skinny child in another foreign place, with more foreign people. Alone.

  

  The Hubermanns lived in one of the small, boxlike houses on Himmel Street. A few rooms, a
  kitchen, and a shared outhouse with neighbors. The roof was flat and there was a shallow basement
  for storage. It was supposedly not a basement of adequate depth. In 1939, this wasnt a
  problem. Later, in 42 and 43, it was. When air raids started, they always needed to rush down the
  street to a better shelter.

  

  In the beginning, it was the profanity that made an immediate impact. It was so vehement
  and prolific. Every second word was either Saumensch or Saukerl or
  Arschloch. For people who arent familiar with these words, I should explain. Sau,
  of course, refers to pigs. In the case of Saumensch, it serves to castigate, berate, or
  plain humiliate a female. Saukerl (pronounced saukairl) is for a male. Arschloch
  can be translated directly into asshole. That word, however, does not differentiate between the
  sexes. It simply is.

  

  Saumensch, du dreckiges! Liesels foster mother shouted that first evening when she refused
  to have a bath. You filthy pig! Why wont you get undressed? She was good at being furious. In
  fact, you could say that Rosa Hubermann had a face decorated with constant fury. That was how the
  creases were made in the cardboard texture of her complexion.

  

  Liesel, naturally, was bathed in anxiety. There was no way she was getting into any bath, or into
  bed for that matter. She was twisted into one corner of the closetlike washroom, clutching for
  the nonexistent arms of the wall for some level of support. There was nothing but dry paint,
  difficult breath, and the deluge of abuse from Rosa.

  

  Leave her alone. Hans Hubermann entered the fray. His gentle voice made its way in, as if
  slipping through a crowd. Leave her to me.

  

  He moved closer and sat on the floor, against the wall. The tiles were cold and unkind.

  

  You know how to roll a cigarette? he asked her, and for the next hour or so, they sat in the
  rising pool of darkness, playing with the tobacco and the cigarette papers and Hans Hubermann
  smoking them.

  

  When the hour was up, Liesel could roll a cigarette moderately well. She still didnt have a
  bath."|"The Book Thief"|"Markus Zusak"
"ap > 02:00"|"just after two oclock"|"Hans Hubermann sat sleepy-eyed on the bed and Liesel would cry into his sleeves and breathe him
  in. Every morning, just after two oclock, she fell asleep again to the smell of him. It was a
  mixture of dead cigarettes, decades of paint, and human skin. At first, she sucked it all in,
  then breathed it, until she drifted back down. Each morning, he was a few feet away from her,
  crumpled, almost halved, in the chair. He never used the other bed. Liesel would climb out and
  cautiously kiss his cheek and he would wake up and smile.

  

  Some days Papa told her to get back into bed and wait a minute, and he would return with his
  accordion and play for her. Liesel would sit up and hum, her cold toes clenched with excitement.
  No one had ever given her music before. She would grin herself stupid, watching the lines drawing
  themselves down his face and the soft metal of his eyesuntil the swearing arrived from the
  kitchen.

  

  STOPTHATNOISE, SAUKERL!

  

  Papa would play a little longer.

  

  He would wink at the girl, and clumsily, shed wink back.

  

  A few times, purely to incense Mama a little further, he also brought the instrument to the
  kitchen and played through breakfast.

  

  Papas bread and jam would be half eaten on his plate, curled into the shape of bite marks, and
  the music would look Liesel in the face. I know it sounds strange, but thats how it felt to her.
  Papas right hand strolled the tooth-colored keys. His left hit the buttons. (She especially loved
  to see him hit the silver, sparkled buttonthe C major.) The accordions scratched yet shiny black
  exterior came back and forth as his arms squeezed the dusty bellows, making it suck in the air
  and throw it back out. In the kitchen on those mornings, Papa made the accordion live. I guess it
  makes sense, when you really think about it.

  

  How do you tell if somethings alive?

  

  You check for breathing. The sound of the accordion was, in fact, also the announcement of
  safety. Daylight. During the day, it was impossible to dream of her brother. She would miss him
  and frequently cry in the tiny washroom as quietly as possible, but she was still glad to be
  awake. On her first night with the Hubermanns, she had hidden her last link to him The
  Grave Diggers Handbookunder her mattress, and occasionally she would pull it out and
  hold it. Staring at the letters on the cover and touching the print inside, she had no idea what
  any of it was saying. The point is, it didnt really matter what that book was about. It was what
  it meant that was more important."|"The Book Thief"|"Markus Zusak"
00:00|midnight|"The last time she saw her brother.

  

  The last time she saw her mother.

  

  Sometimes she would whisper the word Mama and see her mothers face a hundred times in a
  single afternoon. But those were small miseries compared to the terror of her dreams. At those
  times, in the enormous mileage of sleep, she had never felt so completely alone.

  

  As Im sure youve already noticed, there were no other children in the house.

  

  The Hubermanns had two of their own, but they were older and had moved out. Hans Junior worked in
  the center of Munich, and Trudy held a job as a housemaid and child minder. Soon, they would both
  be in the war. One would be making bullets. The other would be shooting them.

  

  School, as you might imagine, was a terrific failure.

  

  Although it was state-run, there was a heavy Catholic influence, and Liesel was Lutheran. Not the
  most auspicious start. Then they discovered she couldnt read or write.

  

  Humiliatingly, she was cast down with the younger kids, who were only just learning the alphabet.
  Even though she was thin-boned and pale, she felt gigantic among the midget children, and she
  often wished she was pale enough to disappear altogether.

  

  Even at home, there wasnt much room for guidance.

  

  Dont ask him for help, Mama pointed out. That Saukerl. Papa was staring out the
  window, as was often his habit. He left school in fourth grade.

  

  Without turning around, Papa answered calmly, but with venom, Well, dont ask her, either. He
  dropped some ash outside. She left school in third grade.

  

  There were no books in the house (apart from the one she had secreted under her mattress), and
  the best Liesel could do was speak the alphabet under her breath before she was told in no
  uncertain terms to keep quiet. All that mumbling. It wasnt until later, when there was a
  bed-wetting incident midnightmare, that an extra reading education began. Unofficially, it was
  called the midnight class, even though it usually commenced at around two in the morning. More of
  that soon. In mid-February, when she turned ten, Liesel was given a used doll that had a missing
  leg and yellow hair.

  

  It was the best we could do, Papa apologized.

  

  What are you talking about? Shes lucky to have that much, Mama corrected him.

  

  Hans continued his examination of the remaining leg while Liesel tried on her new uniform. Ten
  years old meant Hitler Youth. Hitler Youth meant a small brown uniform. Being female, Liesel was

  Each Wednesday and Saturday, Papa would walk Liesel there and pick her up two hours later. They
  never spoke about it much. They just held hands and listened to their feet, and Papa had a
  cigarette or two.

  

  The only anxiety Papa brought her was the fact that he was constantly leaving. Many evenings, he
  would walk into the living room (which doubled as the Hubermanns bedroom), pull the accordion
  from the old cupboard, and squeeze past in the kitchen to the front door.

  

  As he walked up Himmel Street, Mama would open the window and cry out, Dont be home too
  late!

  

  Not so loud, he would turn and call back.

  

  Saukerl! Lick my ass! Ill speak as loud as I want!

  

  The echo of her swearing followed him up the street. He never looked back, or at least, not until
  he was sure his wife was gone. On those evenings, at the end of the street, accordion case in
  hand, he would turn around, just before Frau Dillers corner shop, and see the figure who had
  replaced his wife in the window. Briefly, his long, ghostly hand would rise before he turned
  again and walked slowly on. The next time Liesel saw him would be at two in the morning, when he
  dragged her gently from her nightmare.

  

  Evenings in the small kitchen were raucous, without fail. Rosa Hubermann was always talking, and
  when she was talking, it took the form of schimpfen. She was constantly arguing and
  complaining. There was no one to really argue with, but Mama managed it expertly every chance she
  had. She could argue with the entire world in that kitchen, and almost every evening, she did.
  Once they had eaten and Papa was gone, Liesel and Rosa would usually remain there, and Rosa would
  do the ironing.

  

  A few times a week, Liesel would come home from school and walk the streets of Molching with her
  mama, picking up and delivering washing and ironing from the wealthier parts of town. Knaupt
  Strasse, Heide Strasse. A few others. Mama would deliver the ironing or pick up the washing with
  a dutiful smile, but as soon as the door was shut and she walked away, she would curse these rich
  people, with all their money and laziness.

  

  Too gschtinkerdt to wash their own clothes, she would say, despite her dependence on
  them.

  

  Him, she accused Herr Vogel from Heide Strasse. Made all his money from his father. He throws it
  away on women and drink. And washing and ironing, of course.

  

  It was like a roll call of scorn.

  

  Herr Vogel, Herr and Frau Pfaffelhrver, Helena Schmidt, the Weingartners. They were all guilty of
  something.

  

  Apart from his drunkenness and expensive lechery, Ernst Vogel, according to Rosa, was constantly
  scratching his louse-ridden hair, licking his fingers, and then handing over the money. I should
  wash it before I come home, was her summation.

  

  The Pfaffelhrvers scrutinized the results. Not one crease in these shirts, please, Rosa imitated
  them. Not one wrinkle in this suit. And then they stand there and inspect it all, right in front
  of me. Right under my nose! What a Gsindelwhat trash.

  

  The Weingartners were apparently stupid people with a constantly molting Saumensch of a
  cat. Do you know how long it takes me to get rid of all that fur? Its everywhere!

  

  Helena Schmidt was a rich widow. That old cripplesitting there just wasting away. Shes never had
  to do a days work in all her life.

  

  Rosas greatest disdain, however, was reserved for 8 Grande Strasse. A large house, high on a
  hill, in the upper part of Molching.

  

  This one, shed pointed out to Liesel the first time they went there, is the mayors house. That
  crook. His wife sits at home all day, too mean to light a fireits always freezing in there. Shes
  crazy. She punctuated the words. Absolutely. Crazy. At the gate, she motioned to the girl. You
  go.

  

  Liesel was horrified. A giant brown door with a brass knocker stood atop a small flight of steps.
  What?

  

  Mama shoved her. Dont you what me, Saumensch. Move it.

  

  Liesel moved it. She walked the path, climbed the steps, hesitated, and knocked.

  

  A bathrobe answered the door.

  

  Inside it, a woman with startled eyes, hair like fluff, and the posture of defeat stood in front
  of her. She saw Mama at the gate and handed the girl a bag of washing. Thank you, Liesel said,
  but there was no reply. Only the door. It closed.

  

  You see? said Mama when she returned to the gate. This is what I have to put up with. These rich
  bastards, these lazy swine . . .

  

  Holding the washing as they walked away, Liesel looked back. The brass knocker eyed her from the
  door.

  

  When she finished berating the people she worked for, Rosa Hubermann would usually move on to her
  other favorite theme of abuse. Her husband. Looking at the bag of washing and the hunched houses,
  she would talk, and talk, and talk. If your papa was any good, she informed Liesel every
  time they walked through Molching, I wouldnt have to do this. She sniffed with derision. A
  painter! Why marry that Arschloch ? Thats what they told memy family, that is. Their
  footsteps crunched along the path. And here I am, walking the streets and slaving in my kitchen
  because that Saukerl never has any work. No real work, anyway. Just that pathetic
  accordion in those dirt holes every night.

  

  Yes, Mama.

  

  Is that all youve got to say? Mamas eyes were like pale blue cutouts, pasted to her face.

  

  Theyd walk on.

  

  With Liesel carrying the sack.

  

  At home, it was washed in a boiler next to the stove, hung up by the fireplace in the living
  room, and then ironed in the kitchen. The kitchen was where the action was.

  

  Did you hear that? Mama asked her nearly every night. The iron was in her fist, heated from the
  stove. Light was dull all through the house, and Liesel, sitting at the kitchen table, would be
  staring at the gaps of fire in front of her.

  

  What? shed reply. What is it?

  

  That was that Holtzapfel. Mama was already out of her seat. That Saumensch just spat on
  our door again.

  

  It was a tradition for Frau Holtzapfel, one of their neighbors, to spit on the Hubermanns door
  every time she walked past. The front door was only meters from the gate, and lets just say that
  Frau Holtzapfel had the distanceand the accuracy.

  

  The spitting was due to the fact that she and Rosa Hubermann were engaged in some kind of
  decade-long verbal war. No one knew the origin of this hostility. Theyd probably forgotten it
  themselves.

  

  Frau Holtzapfel was a wiry woman and quite obviously spiteful. Shed never married but had two
  sons, a few years older than the Hubermann offspring. Both were in the army and both will make
  cameo appearances by the time were finished here, I assure you.

  

  In the spiteful stakes, I should also say that Frau Holtzapfel was thorough with her spitting,
  too. She never neglected to spuck on the door of number thirty-three and say,

  hand, he would turn around, just before Frau Dillers corner shop, and see the figure who had
  replaced his wife in the window. Briefly, his long, ghostly hand would rise before he turned
  again and walked slowly on. The next time Liesel saw him would be at two in the morning, when he
  dragged her gently from her nightmare.

  

  Evenings in the small kitchen were raucous, without fail. Rosa Hubermann was always talking, and
  when she was talking, it took the form of schimpfen. She was constantly arguing and
  complaining. There was no one to really argue with, but Mama managed it expertly every chance she
  had. She could argue with the entire world in that kitchen, and almost every evening, she did.
  Once they had eaten and Papa was gone, Liesel and Rosa would usually remain there, and Rosa would
  do the ironing.

  

  A few times a week, Liesel would come home from school and walk the streets of Molching with her
  mama, picking up and delivering washing and ironing from the wealthier parts of town. Knaupt
  Strasse, Heide Strasse. A few others. Mama would deliver the ironing or pick up the washing with
  a dutiful smile, but as soon as the door was shut and she walked away, she would curse these rich
  people, with all their money and laziness.

  

  Too gschtinkerdt to wash their own clothes, she would say, despite her dependence on
  them.

  

  Him, she accused Herr Vogel from Heide Strasse. Made all his money from his father. He throws it
  away on women and drink. And washing and ironing, of course.

  

  It was like a roll call of scorn.

  

  Herr Vogel, Herr and Frau Pfaffelhrver, Helena Schmidt, the Weingartners. They were all guilty of
  something.

  

  Apart from his drunkenness and expensive lechery, Ernst Vogel, according to Rosa, was constantly
  scratching his louse-ridden hair, licking his fingers, and then handing over the money. I should
  wash it before I come home, was her summation.

  

  The Pfaffelhrvers scrutinized the results. Not one crease in these shirts, please, Rosa imitated
  them. Not one wrinkle in this suit. And then they stand there and inspect it all, right in front
  of me. Right under my nose! What a Gsindelwhat trash.

  

  The Weingartners were apparently stupid people with a constantly molting Saumensch of a
  cat. Do you know how long it takes me to get rid of all that fur? Its everywhere!

  

  Helena Schmidt was a rich widow. That old cripplesitting there just wasting away. Shes never had
  to do a days work in all her life.

  

  Rosas greatest disdain, however, was reserved for 8 Grande Strasse. A large house, high on a
  hill, in the upper part of Molching.

  

  This one, shed pointed out to Liesel the first time they went there, is the mayors house. That
  crook. His wife sits at home all day, too mean to light a fireits always freezing in there. Shes
  crazy. She punctuated the words. Absolutely. Crazy. At the gate, she motioned to the girl. You
  go.

  

  Liesel was horrified. A giant brown door with a brass knocker stood atop a small flight of steps.
  What?

  

  Mama shoved her. Dont you what me, Saumensch. Move it.

  

  Liesel moved it. She walked the path, climbed the steps, hesitated, and knocked.

  

  A bathrobe answered the door.

  

  Inside it, a woman with startled eyes, hair like fluff, and the posture of defeat stood in front
  of her. She saw Mama at the gate and handed the girl a bag of washing. Thank you, Liesel said,
  but there was no reply. Only the door. It closed.

  

  You see? said Mama when she returned to the gate. This is what I have to put up with. These rich
  bastards, these lazy swine . . .

  

  Holding the washing as they walked away, Liesel looked back. The brass knocker eyed her from the
  door.

  

  When she finished berating the people she worked for, Rosa Hubermann would usually move on to her
  other favorite theme of abuse. Her husband. Looking at the bag of washing and the hunched houses,
  she would talk, and talk, and talk. If your papa was any good, she informed Liesel every
  time they walked through Molching, I wouldnt have to do this. She sniffed with derision. A
  painter! Why marry that Arschloch ? Thats what they told memy family, that is. Their
  footsteps crunched along the path. And here I am, walking the streets and slaving in my kitchen
  because that Saukerl never has any work. No real work, anyway. Just that pathetic
  accordion in those dirt holes every night.

  

  Yes, Mama.

  

  Is that all youve got to say? Mamas eyes were like pale blue cutouts, pasted to her face.

  

  Theyd walk on.

  

  With Liesel carrying the sack.

  

  At home, it was washed in a boiler next to the stove, hung up by the fireplace in the living
  room, and then ironed in the kitchen. The kitchen was where the action was.

  

  Did you hear that? Mama asked her nearly every night. The iron was in her fist, heated from the
  stove. Light was dull all through the house, and Liesel, sitting at the kitchen table, would be
  staring at the gaps of fire in front of her.

  

  What? shed reply. What is it?

  

  That was that Holtzapfel. Mama was already out of her seat. That Saumensch just spat on
  our door again.

  

  It was a tradition for Frau Holtzapfel, one of their neighbors, to spit on the Hubermanns door
  every time she walked past. The front door was only meters from the gate, and lets just say that
  Frau Holtzapfel had the distanceand the accuracy.

  

  The spitting was due to the fact that she and Rosa Hubermann were engaged in some kind of
  decade-long verbal war. No one knew the origin of this hostility. Theyd probably forgotten it
  themselves.

  

  Frau Holtzapfel was a wiry woman and quite obviously spiteful. Shed never married but had two
  sons, a few years older than the Hubermann offspring. Both were in the army and both will make
  cameo appearances by the time were finished here, I assure you.

  

  In the spiteful stakes, I should also say that Frau Holtzapfel was thorough with her spitting,
  too. She never neglected to spuck on the door of number thirty-three and say,
  Schweine! each time she walked past. One thing Ive noticed about the Germans:

  

  They seem very fond of pigs."|"The Book Thief"|"Markus Zusak"
19:36|1936|"As we both know, Liesel wasnt on hand on Himmel Street when Rudy performed his act of childhood
  infamy. When she looked back, though, it felt like shed actually been there. In her memory, she
  had somehow become a member of Rudys imaginary audience. Nobody else mentioned it, but Rudy
  certainly made up for that, so much that when Liesel came to recollect her story, the Jesse Owens
  incident was as much a part of it as everything she witnessed firsthand.

  

  It was 1936. The Olympics. Hitlers games.

  

  Jesse Owens had just completed the 4 100m relay and won his fourth gold medal. Talk that he was
  subhuman because he was black and Hitlers refusal to shake his hand were touted around the world.
  Even the most racist Germans were amazed with the efforts of Owens, and word of his feat slipped
  through the cracks. No one was more impressed than Rudy Steiner.

  

  Everyone in his family was crowded together in their family room when he slipped out and made his
  way to the kitchen. He pulled some charcoal from the stove and gripped it in the smallness of his
  hands. Now. There was a smile. He was ready.

  

  He smeared the charcoal on, nice and thick, till he was covered in black. Even his hair received
  a once-over.

  

  In the window, the boy grinned almost maniacally at his reflection, and in his shorts and tank
  top, he quietly abducted his older brothers bike and pedaled it up the street, heading for Hubert
  Oval. In one of his pockets, hed hidden a few pieces of extra charcoal, in case some of it wore
  off later.

  

  In Liesels mind, the moon was sewn into the sky that night. Clouds were stitched around it.

  

  The rusty bike crumbled to a halt at the Hubert Oval fence line and Rudy climbed over. He landed
  on the other side and trotted weedily up toward the beginning of the hundred. Enthusiastically,
  he conducted an awkward regimen of stretches. He dug starting holes into the dirt.

  

  Waiting for his moment, he paced around, gathering concentration under the darkness sky, with the
  moon and the clouds watching, tightly.

  

  Owens is looking good, he began to commentate. This could be his greatest victory ever. . .
  .

  

  He shook the imaginary hands of the other athletes and wished them luck, even though he knew.
  They didnt have a chance.

  

  The starter signaled them forward. A crowd materialized around every square inch of Hubert Ovals
  circumference. They were all calling out one thing. They were chanting Rudy Steiners nameand his
  name was Jesse Owens.

  

  All fell silent.

  

  His bare feet gripped the soil. He could feel it holding on between his toes.

  

  At the request of the starter, he raised to crouching positionand the gun clipped a hole in the
  night.

  

  For the first third of the race, it was pretty even, but it was only a matter of time before the
  charcoaled Owens drew clear and streaked away.

  

  Owens in front, the boys shrill voice cried as he ran down the empty track, straight toward the
  uproarious applause of Olympic glory. He could even feel the tape break in two across his chest
  as he burst through it in first place. The fastest man alive.

  

  It was only on his victory lap that things turned sour. Among the crowd, his father was standing
  at the finish line like the bogeyman. Or at least, the bogeyman in a suit. (As previously
  mentioned, Rudys father was a tailor. He was rarely seen on the street without a suit and tie. On
  this occasion, it was only the suit and a disheveled shirt.)

  

  Was ist los? he said to his son when he showed up in all his charcoal glory. What the hell
  is going on here? The crowd vanished. A breeze sprang up. I was asleep in my chair when Kurt
  noticed you were gone. Everyones out looking for you.

  

  Mr. Steiner was a remarkably polite man under normal circumstances. Discovering one of his
  children smeared charcoal black on a summer evening was not what he considered normal
  circumstances. The boy is crazy, he muttered, although he conceded that with six kids, something
  like this was bound to happen. At least one of them had to be a bad egg. Right now, he was
  looking at it, waiting for an explanation. Well?

  

  Rudy panted, bending down and placing his hands on his knees. I was being Jesse Owens. He
  answered as though it was the most natural thing on earth to be doing. There was even something
  implicit in his tone that suggested something along the lines of, What the hell does it look
  like? The tone vanished, however, when he saw the sleep deprivation whittled under his fathers
  eyes.

  

  Jesse Owens? Mr. Steiner was the type of man who was very wooden. His voice was angular and true.
  His body was tall and heavy, like oak. His hair was like splinters. What about him?

  

  You know, Papa, the Black Magic one.

  

  Ill give you black magic. He caught his sons ear between his thumb and forefinger.

  

  Rudy winced. Ow, that really hurts.

  

  Does it? His father was more concerned with the clammy texture of charcoal contaminating his
  fingers. He covered everything, didnt he? he thought. Its even in his ears, for Gods sake. Come
  on.

  

  On the way home, Mr. Steiner decided to talk politics with the boy as best he could. Only in the
  years ahead would Rudy understand it all when it was too late to bother understanding
  anything."|"The Book Thief"|"Markus Zusak"
02:00|"2 A.M."|"A 2 A.M. CONVERSATION

  Is this yours?

  Yes, Papa.

  Do you want to read it?

  Again, Yes, Papa.

  A tired smile.

  Metallic eyes, melting.

  Well, wed better read it, then."|"The Book Thief"|"Markus Zusak"
00:00|midnight|"Four years later, when she came to write in the basement, two thoughts struck Liesel about the
  trauma of wetting the bed. First, she felt extremely lucky that it was Papa who discovered the
  book. (Fortunately, when the sheets had been washed previously, Rosa had made Liesel strip the
  bed and make it up. And be quick about it, Saumensch! Does it look like weve got all day?)
  Second, she was clearly proud of Hans Hubermanns part in her education. You wouldnt think
  it, she wrote, but it was not so much the school who helped me to read. It was Papa.
  People think hes not so smart, and its true that he doesnt read too fast, but I would
  soon learn that words and writing actually saved his life once. Or at least, words and a
  man who taught him the accordion . . .

  

  First things first, Hans Hubermann said that night. He washed the sheets and hung them up. Now,
  he said upon his return. Lets get this midnight class started.

  

  The yellow light was alive with dust.

  

  Liesel sat on cold clean sheets, ashamed, elated. The thought of bed-wetting prodded her, but she
  was going to read. She was going to read the book.

  

  The excitement stood up in her.

  

  Visions of a ten-year-old reading genius were set alight.

  

  If only it was that easy.

  

  To tell you the truth, Papa explained upfront, I am not such a good reader myself.

  

  But it didnt matter that he read slowly. If anything, it might have helped that his own reading
  pace was slower than average. Perhaps it would cause less frustration in coping with the girls
  lack of ability.

  

  Still, initially, Hans appeared a little uncomfortable holding the book and looking through
  it.

  

  When he came over and sat next to her on the bed, he leaned back, his legs angling over the side.
  He examined the book again and dropped it on the blanket. Now why would a nice girl like you want
  to read such a thing?

  

  Again, Liesel shrugged. Had the apprentice been reading the complete works of Goethe or any other
  such luminary, that was what would have sat in front of them. She attempted to explain. I when .
  . . It was sitting in the snow, and The soft-spoken words fell off the side of the bed, emptying
  to the floor like powder.

  

  Papa knew what to say, though. He always knew what to say.

  

  He ran a hand through his sleepy hair and said, Well, promise me one thing, Liesel. If I die
  anytime soon, you make sure they bury me right.

  

  She nodded, with great sincerity.

  

  No skipping chapter six or step four in chapter nine. He laughed, as did the bed wetter. Well, Im
  glad thats settled. We can get on with it now.

  

  He adjusted his position and his bones creaked like itchy floorboards. The fun begins.

  

  Amplified by the still of night, the book openeda gust of wind.

  

  Looking back, Liesel could tell exactly what her papa was thinking when he scanned the first page
  of The Grave Diggers Handbook. As he realized the difficulty of the text, he was clearly
  aware that such a book was hardly ideal. There were words in there that hed have trouble with
  himself. Not to mention the morbidity of the subject. As for the girl, there was a sudden desire
  to read it that she didnt even attempt to understand. On some level, perhaps she wanted to make
  sure her brother was buried right. Whatever the reason, her hunger to read that book was as
  intense as any ten-year-old human could experience.

  

  Chapter one was called The First Step: Choosing the Right Equipment. In a short introductory
  passage, it outlined the kind of material to be covered in the following twenty pages. Types of
  shovels, picks, gloves, and so forth were itemized, as well as the vital need to properly
  maintain them. This grave digging was serious.

  

  As Papa flicked through it, he could surely feel Liesels eyes on him. They reached over and
  gripped him, waiting for something, anything, to slip from his lips.

  

  Here. He shifted again and handed her the book. Look at this page and tell me how many words you
  can read.

  

  She looked at itand lied.

  

  About half.

  

  Read some for me. But of course, she couldnt. When he made her point out any words she could read
  and actually say them, there were only threethe three main German words for the. The whole page
  must have had two hundred words on it.

  

  This might be harder than I thought.

  

  She caught him thinking it, just for a moment.

  

  He lifted himself forward, rose to his feet, and walked out.

  

  This time, when he came back, he said, Actually, I have a better idea. In his hand, there was a
  thick painters pencil and a stack of sandpaper. Lets start from scratch. Liesel saw no reason to
  argue.

  

  In the left corner of an upturned piece of sandpaper, he drew a square of perhaps an inch and
  shoved a capital A inside it. In the other corner, he placed a lowercase one. So far, so
  good.

  

  A, Liesel said.

  

  A for what?

  

  She smiled. Apfel.

  

  He wrote the word in big letters and drew a misshapen apple under it. He was a housepainter, not
  an artist. When it was complete, he looked over and said, Now for B.

  

  As they progressed through the alphabet, Liesels eyes grew larger. She had done this at school,
  in the kindergarten class, but this time was better. She was the only one there, and she was not
  gigantic. It was nice to watch Papas hand as he wrote the words and slowly constructed the
  primitive sketches.

  

  Ah, come on, Liesel, he said when she struggled later on. Something that starts with S. Its easy.
  Im very disappointed in you.

  

  She couldnt think.

  

  Come on! His whisper played with her. Think of Mama.

  

  That was when the word struck her face like a slap. A reflex grin. SAUMENSCH! she shouted,
  and Papa roared with laughter, then quieted.

  

  Shhh, we have to be quiet. But he roared all the same and wrote the word, completing it with one
  of his sketches.

  Over the next few weeks and into summer, the midnight class began at the end of each nightmare.
  There were two more bed-wetting occurrences, but Hans Hubermann merely repeated his previous
  cleanup heroics and got down to the task of reading, sketching, and reciting. In the mornings
  early hours, quiet voices were loud.

  

  On a Thursday, just after 3 p.m., Mama told Liesel to get ready to come with her and deliver some
  ironing. Papa had other ideas.

  

  He walked into the kitchen and said, Sorry, Mama, shes not going with you today.

  

  Mama didnt even bother looking up from the washing bag. Who asked you, Arschloch? Come on,
  Liesel.

  

  Shes reading, he said. Papa handed Liesel a steadfast smile and a wink. With me. Im teaching her.
  Were going to the Amper upstream, where I used to practice the accordion.

  

  Now he had her attention.

  

  Mama placed the washing on the table and eagerly worked herself up to the appropriate level of
  cynicism. What did you say?

  

  I think you heard me, Rosa.

  

  Mama laughed. What the hell could you teach her? A cardboard grin. Uppercut words. Like
  you could read so much, you Saukerl.

  

  The kitchen waited. Papa counterpunched. Well take your ironing for you.

  

  You filthy She stopped. The words propped in her mouth as she considered it. Be back before
  dark.

  

  We cant read in the dark, Mama, Liesel said.

  

  What was that, Saumensch?

  

  Nothing, Mama.

  

  Papa grinned and pointed at the girl. Book, sandpaper, pencil, he ordered her, and accordion!
  once she was already gone. Soon, they were on Himmel Street, carrying the words, the music, the
  washing.

  

  As they walked toward Frau Dillers, they turned around a few times to see if Mama was still at
  the gate, checking on them. She was. At one point, she called out, Liesel, hold that ironing
  straight! Dont crease it!

  

  Yes, Mama!

  

  A few steps later: Liesel, are you dressed warm enough?!

  

  What did you say?

  

  Saumensch dreckiges, you never hear anything! Are you dressed warm enough? It might get
  cold later!

  

  Around the corner, Papa bent down to do up a shoelace. Liesel, he said, could you roll me a
  cigarette?

  

  Nothing would give her greater pleasure.

  

  Once the ironing was delivered, they made their way back to the Amper River, which flanked the
  town. It worked its way past, pointing in the direction of Dachau, the concentration camp.

  

  There was a wooden-planked bridge.

"ap > 03:00"|"Just past three oclock"|"Finishing The Grave
  Diggers Handbook.

  

  Escaping the ire of Sister Maria.

  

  Receiving two books for Christmas.

  

  December 17.

  

  She remembered the date well, as it was exactly a week before Christmas.

  

  As usual, her nightly nightmare interrupted her sleep and she was woken by Hans Hubermann. His
  hand held the sweaty fabric of her pajamas. The train? he whispered.

  

  Liesel confirmed. The train.

  

  She gulped the air until she was ready, and they began reading from the eleventh chapter of
  The Grave Diggers Handbook. Just past three oclock, they finished it, and only the final
  chapter, Respecting the Graveyard, remained. Papa, his silver eyes swollen in their tiredness and
  his face awash with whiskers, shut the book and expected the leftovers of his sleep. He didnt get
  them.

  

  The light was out for barely a minute when Liesel spoke to him across the dark.

  

  Papa?

  

  He made only a noise, somewhere in his throat.

  

  Are you awake, Papa?

  

  Ja.

  

  Up on one elbow. Can we finish the book, please?

  

  There was a long breath, the scratchery of hand on whiskers, and then the light. He opened the
  book and began. Chapter Twelve: Respecting the Graveyard.

  

  They read through the early hours of morning, circling and writing the words she did not
  comprehend and turning the pages toward daylight. A few times, Papa nearly slept, succumbing to
  the itchy fatigue in his eyes and the wilting of his head. Liesel caught him out on each
  occasion, but she had neither the selflessness to allow him to sleep nor the hide to be offended.
  She was a girl with a mountain to climb.

  

  Eventually, as the darkness outside began to break up a little, they finished. The last passage
  looked like this:

  

  We at the Bayern Cemetery Association hope that we have informedand entertained you in the
  workings, safety measures, and duties of grave digging. We wish you every success with your
  career in the funerary arts and hope this book has helped in some way.

  

  When the book closed, they shared a sideways glance. Papa spoke.

  

  We made it, huh?

  

  Liesel, half-wrapped in blanket, studied the black book in her hand and its silver lettering. She
  nodded, dry-mouthed and early-morning hungry. It was one of those moments of perfect tiredness,
  of having conquered not only the work at hand, but the night who had blocked the way.

  

  Papa stretched with his fists closed and his eyes grinding shut, and it was a morning that didnt
  dare to be rainy. They each stood and walked to the kitchen, and through the fog and frost of the
  window, they were able to see the pink bars of light on the snowy banks of Himmel Streets
  rooftops.

  

  Look at the colors, Papa said. Its hard not to like a man who not only notices the colors, but
  speaks them.

  

  Liesel still held the book. She gripped it tighter as the snow turned orange. On one of the
  rooftops, she could see a small boy, sitting, looking at the sky. His name was Werner, she
  mentioned. The words trotted out, involuntarily.

  

  Papa said, Yes.

  

  At school during that time, there had been no more reading tests, but as Liesel slowly gathered
  confidence, she did pick up a stray textbook before class one morning to see if she could read it
  without trouble. She could read every word, but she remained stranded at a much slower pace than
  that of her classmates. Its much easier, she realized, to be on the verge of something than to
  actually be it. This would still take time.

  

  One afternoon, she was tempted to steal a book from the class bookshelf, but frankly, the
  prospect of another corridor Watschen at the hands of Sister Maria was a powerful enough
  deterrent. On top of that, there was actually no real desire in her to take the books from
  school. It was most likely the intensity of her November failure that caused this lack of
  interest, but Liesel wasnt sure. She only knew that it was there.

  

  In class, she did not speak.

  

  She didnt so much as look the wrong way.

  

  As winter set in, she was no longer a victim of Sister Marias frustrations, preferring to watch
  as others were marched out to the corridor and given their just rewards. The sound of another
  student struggling in the hallway was not particularly enjoyable, but the fact that it was
  someone else was, if not a true comfort, a relief.

  

  When school broke up briefly for Weihnachten, Liesel even afforded Sister Maria a merry
  Christmas before going on her way. Knowing that the Hubermanns were essentially broke, still
  paying off debts and paying rent quicker than the money could come in, she was not expecting a
  gift of any sort. Perhaps only some better food. To her surprise, on Christmas Eve, after sitting
  in church at midnight with Mama, Papa, Hans Junior, and Trudy, she came home to find something
  wrapped in newspaper under the Christmas tree.

  

  From Saint Niklaus, Papa said, but the girl was not fooled. She hugged both her foster parents,
  with snow still laid across her shoulders.

  

  Unfurling the paper, she unwrapped two small books. The first one, Faust the Dog, was
  written by a man named Mattheus Ottleberg. All told, she would read that book thirteen times. On
  Christmas Eve, she read the first twenty pages at the kitchen table while Papa and Hans Junior
  argued about a thing she did not understand. Something called politics.

  

  Later, they read some more in bed, adhering to the tradition of circling the words she didnt know
  and writing them down. Faust the Dog also had pictureslovely curves and ears and
  caricatures of a German Shepherd with an obscene drooling problem and the ability to talk.

  

  The second book was called The Lighthouse and was written by a woman, Ingrid Rippinstein.
  That particular book was a little longer, so Liesel was able to get through it only nine times,
  her pace increasing ever so slightly by the end of such prolific readings.

  

  It was a few days after Christmas that she asked a question regarding the books. They were eating
  in the kitchen. Looking at the spoonfuls of pea soup entering Mamas mouth, she decided to shift
  her focus to Papa. Theres something I need to ask.

  

  At first, there was nothing.

  

  And?

  

  It was Mama, her mouth still half full.

  

  I just wanted to know how you found the money to buy my books.

  

  A short grin was smiled into Papas spoon. You really want to know?

  

  Of course.

  

  From his pocket, Papa took what was left of his tobacco ration and began rolling a cigarette, at
  which Liesel became impatient.

  

  Are you going to tell me or not?

  

  Papa laughed. But I am telling you, child. He completed the production of one cigarette,
  flipped it on the table, and began on another. Just like this.

  

  That was when Mama finished her soup with a clank, suppressed a cardboard burp, and answered for
  him. That Saukerl, she said. You know what he did? He rolled up all of his filthy
  cigarettes, went to the market when it was in town, and traded them with some gypsy.

  

  Eight cigarettes per book. Papa shoved one to his mouth, in triumph. He lit up and took in the
  smoke. Praise the Lord for cigarettes, huh, Mama?

  

  Mama only handed him one of her trademark looks of disgust, followed by the most common ration of
  her vocabulary. Saukerl.

  

  Liesel swapped a customary wink with her papa and finished eating her soup. As always, one of her
  books was next to her. She could not deny that the answer to her question had been more than
  satisfactory. There were not many people who could say that their education had been paid for
  with cigarettes.

  

  Mama, on the other hand, said that if Hans Hubermann was any good at all, he would trade some
  tobacco for the new dress she was in desperate need of or some better shoes. But no . . . She
  emptied the words out into the sink. When it comes to me, youd rather smoke a whole ration,
  wouldnt you? Plus some of next doors.

  

  A few nights later, however, Hans Hubermann came home with a box of eggs. Sorry, Mama. He placed
  them on the table. They were all out of shoes.

  

  Mama didnt complain.

  

  She even sang to herself while she cooked those eggs to the brink of burndom. It appeared that
  there was great joy in cigarettes, and it was a happy time in the Hubermann household.

  

  It ended a few weeks later."|"The Book Thief"|"Markus Zusak"
"ap 04:30"|four-thirty|"People lined the streets as the youth of Germany marched toward the town hall and the square. On
  quite a few occasions Liesel forgot about her mother and any other problem of which she currently
  held ownership. There was a swell in her chest as the people clapped them on. Some kids waved to
  their parents, but only brieflyit was an explicit instruction that they march straight and
  dont look or wave to the crowd.

  

  When Rudys group came into the square and was instructed to halt, there was a discrepancy. Tommy
  Mller. The rest of the regiment stopped marching and Tommy plowed directly into the boy in front
  of him.

  

  Dummkopf ! the boy spat before turning around.

  

  Im sorry, said Tommy, arms held apologetically out. His face tripped over itself. I couldnt hear.
  It was only a small moment, but it was also a preview of troubles to come. For Tommy. For
  Rudy.

  

  At the end of the marching, the Hitler Youth divisions were allowed to disperse. It would have
  been near impossible to keep them all together as the bonfire burned in their eyes and excited
  them. Together, they cried one united heil Hitler and were free to wander. Liesel looked
  for Rudy, but once the crowd of children scattered, she was caught inside a mess of uniforms and
  high-pitched words. Kids calling out to other kids.

  

  By four-thirty, the air had cooled considerably.

  

  People joked that they needed warming up. Thats all this trash is good for anyway.

  

  Carts were used to wheel it all in. It was dumped in the middle of the town square and dowsed
  with something sweet. Books and paper and other material would slide or tumble down, only to be
  thrown back onto the pile. From further away, it looked like something volcanic. Or something
  grotesque and alien that had somehow landed miraculously in the middle of town and needed to be
  snuffed out, and fast.

  

  The applied smell leaned toward the crowd, who were kept at a good distance. There were well in
  excess of a thousand people, on the ground, on the town hall steps, on the rooftops that
  surrounded the square.

  

  When Liesel tried to make her way through, a crackling sound prompted her to think that the fire
  had already begun. It hadnt. The sound was kinetic humans, flowing, charging up.

  

  Theyve started without me!

  

  Although something inside told her that this was a crimeafter all, her three books were the most
  precious items she ownedshe was compelled to see the thing lit. She couldnt help it. I guess
  humans like to watch a little destruction. Sand castles, houses of cards, thats where they begin.
  Their great skill is their capacity to escalate.

  

  The thought of missing it was eased when she found a gap in the bodies and was able to see the
  mound of guilt, still intact. It was prodded and splashed, even spat on. It reminded her of an
  unpopular child, forlorn and bewildered, powerless to alter its fate. No one liked it. Head down.
  Hands in pockets. Forever. Amen.

  

  Bits and pieces continued falling to its sides as Liesel hunted for Rudy. Where is that
  Saukerl?

  

  When she looked up, the sky was crouching.

  

  A horizon of Nazi flags and uniforms rose upward, crippling her view every time she attempted to
  see over a smaller childs head. It was pointless. The crowd was itself. There was no swaying it,
  squeezing through, or reasoning with it. You breathed with it and you sang its songs. You waited
  for its fire.

  

  Silence was requested by a man on a podium. His uniform was shiny brown. The iron was practically
  still on it. The silence began.

  

  His first words: Heil Hitler!

  

  His first action: the salute to the Fhrer.

  

  Today is a beautiful day, he continued. Not only is it our great leaders birthdaybut we also stop
  our enemies once again. We stop them reaching into our minds. . . .

  

  Liesel still attempted to fight her way through.

  

  We put an end to the disease that has been spread through Germany for the last twenty years, if
  not more! He was performing now what is called a Schreiereia consummate exhibition of
  passionate shoutingwarning the crowd to be watchful, to be vigilant, to seek out and destroy the
  evil machinations plotting to infect the mother-land with its deplorable ways. The immoral! The
  Kommunisten ! That word again. That old word. Dark rooms. Suit-wearing men. Die
  Judenthe Jews!

  

  Halfway through the speech, Liesel surrendered. As the word communist seized her, the
  remainder of the Nazi recital swept by, either side, lost somewhere in the German feet around
  her. Waterfalls of words. A girl treading water. She thought it again. Kommunisten.

  

  Up until now, at the BDM, they had been told that Germany was the superior race, but no one else
  in particular had been mentioned. Of course, everyone knew about the Jews, as they were the main
  offenderin regard to violating the German ideal. Not once, however, had the communists
  been mentioned until today, regardless of the fact that people of such political creed were also
  to be punished.

  

  She had to get out.

  

  In front of her, a head with parted blond hair and pigtails sat absolutely still on its
  shoulders. Staring into it, Liesel revisited those dark rooms of her past and her mother
  answering questions made up of one word.

  

  She saw it all so clearly.

  

  Her starving mother, her missing father. Kommunisten.

  

  Her dead brother.

  

  And now we say goodbye to this trash, this poison.

  

  Just before Liesel Meminger pivoted with nausea to exit the crowd, the shiny, brown-shirted
  creature walked from the podium. He received a torch from an accomplice and lit the mound, which
  dwarfed him in all its culpability. Heil Hitler!

  

  The audience: Heil Hitler!

  

  A collection of men walked from a platform and surrounded the heap, igniting it, much to the
  approval of everyone. Voices climbed over shoulders and the smell of pure German sweat struggled
  at first, then poured out. It rounded corner after corner, till they were all swimming in it. The
  words, the sweat. And smiling. Lets not forget the smiling.

  

  Many jocular comments followed, as did another onslaught of heil Hitlering. You know, it
  actually makes me wonder if anyone ever lost an eye or injured a hand or wrist with all of that.
  Youd only need to be facing the wrong way at the wrong time or stand marginally too close to
  another person. Perhaps people did get injured. Personally, I can only tell you that no one died
  from it, or at least, not physically. There was, of course, the matter of forty million people I
  picked up by the time the whole thing was finished, but thats getting all metaphoric. Allow me to
  return us to the fire.

  

  The orange flames waved at the crowd as paper and print dissolved inside them. Burning words were
  torn from their sentences.

  

  On the other side, beyond the blurry heat, it was possible to see the brownshirts and swastikas
  joining hands. You didnt see people. Only uniforms and signs.

  

  Birds above did laps.

  

  They circled, somehow attracted to the glowuntil they came too close to the heat. Or was it the
  humans? Certainly, the heat was nothing.

  

  In her attempt to escape, a voice found her.

  

  Liesel!

  

  It made its way through and she recognized it. It was not Rudy, but she knew that voice.

  

  She twisted free and found the face attached to it. Oh, no. Ludwig Schmeikl. He did not, as she
  expected, sneer or joke or make any conversation at all. All he was able to do was pull her
  toward him and motion to his ankle. It had been crushed among the excitement and was bleeding
  dark and ominous through his sock. His face wore a helpless expression beneath his tangled blond
  hair. An animal. Not a deer in lights. Nothing so typical or specific. He was just an animal,
  hurt among the melee of its own kind, soon to be trampled by it.

  

  Somehow, she helped him up and dragged him toward the back. Fresh air.

  

  They staggered to the steps at the side of the church. There was some room there and they rested,
  both relieved.

  

  Breath collapsed from Schmeikls mouth. It slipped down, over his throat. He managed to
  speak.

  

  Sitting down, he held his ankle and found Liesel Memingers face. Thanks, he said, to her mouth
  rather than her eyes. More slabs of breath. And . . . They both watched images of school-yard
  antics, followed by a school-yard beating. Im sorryfor, you know.

  

  Liesel heard it again.

  

  Kommunisten.

  

  She chose, however, to focus on Ludwig Schmeikl. Me too.

  

  They both concentrated on breathing then, for there was nothing more to do or say. Their business
  had come to an end.

  

  The blood enlarged on Ludwig Schmeikls ankle.

  

  A single word leaned against the girl.

  

  To their left, flames and burning books were cheered like heroes."|"The Book Thief"|"Markus Zusak"
"ap > 03:00"|"after three"|"The dark came in pieces, and with the cigarette brought to an end, Liesel and Hans Hubermann
  began to walk home. To get out of the square, they would walk past the bonfire site and through a
  small side road onto Munich Street. They didnt make it that far.

  

  A middle-aged carpenter named Wolfgang Edel called out. Hed built the platforms for the Nazi big
  shots to stand on during the fire and he was in the process now of pulling them down. Hans
  Hubermann? He had long sideburns that pointed to his mouth and a dark voice. Hansi!

  

  Hey, Wolfal, Hans replied. There was an introduction to the girl and a heil Hitler. Good,
  Liesel.

  

  For the first few minutes, Liesel stayed within a five-meter radius of the conversation.
  Fragments came past her, but she didnt pay too much attention.

  

  Getting much work?

  

  No, its all tighter now. You know how it is, especially when youre not a member.

  

  You told me you were joining, Hansi.

  

  I tried, but I made a mistakeI think theyre still considering.

  

  Liesel wandered toward the mountain of ash. It sat like a magnet, like a freak. Irresistible to
  the eyes, similar to the road of yellow stars.

  

  As with her previous urge to see the mounds ignition, she could not look away. All alone, she
  didnt have the discipline to keep a safe distance. It sucked her toward it and she began to make
  her way around.

  

  Above her, the sky was completing its routine of darkening, but far away, over the mountains
  shoulder, there was a dull trace of light.

  

  Pass auf, Kind, a uniform said to her at one point. Look out, child, as he shoveled some
  more ash onto a cart.

  

  Closer to the town hall, under a light, some shadows stood and talked, most likely exulting in
  the success of the fire. From Liesels position, their voices were only sounds. Not words at
  all.

  

  For a few minutes, she watched the men shoveling up the pile, at first making it smaller at the
  sides to allow more of it to collapse. They came back and forth from a truck, and after three
  return trips, when the heap was reduced near the bottom, a small section of living material
  slipped from inside the ash."|"The Book Thief"|"Markus Zusak"

  Another benign visit to the mayors house.

  

  All was lovely.

  

  Until.

  

  When Liesel next visited, minus Rudy, the opportunity presented itself. It was a pickup
  day.

  

  The mayors wife opened the door and she was not holding the bag, like she normally would.
  Instead, she stepped aside and motioned with her chalky hand and wrist for the girl to
  enter.

  

  Im just here for the washing. Liesels blood had dried inside of her. It crumbled. She almost
  broke into pieces on the steps.

  

  The woman said her first word to her then. She reached out, cold-fingered, and said,
  Wartewait. When she was sure the girl had steadied, she turned and walked hastily back
  inside.

  

  Thank God, Liesel exhaled. Shes getting it. It being the washing.

  

  What the woman returned with, however, was nothing of the sort.

  

  When she came and stood with an impossibly frail steadfastness, she was holding a tower of books
  against her stomach, from her navel to the beginnings of her breasts. She looked so vulnerable in
  the monstrous doorway. Long, light eyelashes and just the slightest twinge of expression. A
  suggestion.

  

  Come and see, it said.

  

  Shes going to torture me, Liesel decided. Shes going to take me inside, light the fireplace, and
  throw me in, books and all. Or shell lock me in the basement without any food.

  

  For some reason, thoughmost likely the lure of the booksshe found herself walking in. The
  squeaking of her shoes on the wooden floorboards made her cringe, and when she hit a sore spot,
  inducing the wood to groan, she almost stopped. The mayors wife was not deterred. She only looked
  briefly behind and continued on, to a chestnut-colored door. Now her face asked a question.

  

  Are you ready?

  

  Liesel craned her neck a little, as if she might see over the door that stood in her way.
  Clearly, that was the cue to open it.

  

  Jesus, Mary . . .

  

  She said it out loud, the words distributed into a room that was full of cold air and books.
  Books everywhere! Each wall was armed with overcrowded yet immaculate shelving. It was barely
  possible to see the paintwork. There were all different styles and sizes of lettering on the
  spines of the black, the red, the gray, the every-colored books. It was one of the most beautiful
  things Liesel Meminger had ever seen.

  

  With wonder, she smiled.

  

  That such a room existed!

  

  Even when she tried to wipe the smile away with her forearm, she realized instantly that it was a
  pointless exercise. She could feel the eyes of the woman traveling her body, and when she looked
  at her, they had rested on her face.

  

  There was more silence than she ever thought possible. It extended like an elastic, dying to
  break. The girl broke it.

  

  Can I?

  

  The two words stood among acres and acres of vacant, wooden-floored land. The books were miles
  away.

  

  The woman nodded.

  

  Yes, you can.

  

  Steadily, the room shrank, till the book thief could touch the shelves within a few small steps.
  She ran the back of her hand along the first shelf, listening to the shuffle of her fingernails
  gliding across the spinal cord of each book. It sounded like an instrument, or the notes of
  running feet. She used both hands. She raced them. One shelf against the other. And she laughed.
  Her voice was sprawled out, high in her throat, and when she eventually stopped and stood in the
  middle of the room, she spent many minutes looking from the shelves to her fingers and back
  again.

  

  How many books had she touched?

  

  How many had she felt?

  

  She walked over and did it again, this time much slower, with her hand facing forward, allowing
  the dough of her palm to feel the small hurdle of each book. It felt like magic, like beauty, as
  bright lines of light shone down from a chandelier. Several times, she almost pulled a title from
  its place but didnt dare disturb them. They were too perfect.

  

  To her left, she saw the woman again, standing by a large desk, still holding the small tower
  against her torso. She stood with a delighted crookedness. A smile appeared to have paralyzed her
  lips.

  

  Do you want me to?

  

  Liesel didnt finish the question but actually performed what she was going to ask, walking over
  and taking the books gently from the womans arms. She then placed them into the missing piece in
  the shelf, by the slightly open window. The outside cold was streaming in.

  

  For a moment, she considered closing it, but thought better of it. This was not her house, and
  the situation was not to be tampered with. Instead, she returned to the lady behind her, whose
  smile gave the appearance now of a bruise and whose arms were hanging slenderly at each side.
  Like girls arms.

  

  What now?

  

  An awkwardness treated itself to the room, and Liesel took a final, fleeting glance at the walls
  of books. In her mouth, the words fidgeted, but they came out in a rush. I should go.

  

  It took three attempts to leave.

  

  She waited in the hallway for a few minutes, but the woman didnt come, and when Liesel returned
  to the entrance of the room, she saw her sitting at the desk, staring blankly at one of the
  books. She chose not to disturb her. In the hallway, she picked up the washing.

  

  This time, she avoided the sore spot in the floorboards, walking the long length of the corridor,
  favoring the left-hand wall. When she closed the door behind her, a brass clank sounded in her
  ear, and with the washing next to her, she stroked the flesh of the wood. Get going, she
  said.

  

  At first, she walked home dazed.

  

  The surreal experience with the roomful of books and the stunned, broken woman walked alongside
  her. She could see it on the buildings, like a play. Perhaps it was similar to the way Papa had
  his Mein Kampf revelation. Wherever she looked, Liesel saw the mayors wife with the books
  piled up in her arms. Around corners, she could hear the shuffle of her own hands, disturbing the
  shelves. She saw the open window, the chandelier of lovely light, and she saw herself leaving,
  without so much as a word of thanks.

  

  Soon, her sedated condition transformed to harassment and self-loathing. She began to rebuke
  herself.

  

  You said nothing. Her head shook vigorously, among the hurried footsteps. Not a goodbye. Not a
  thank you. Not a thats the most beautiful sight Ive ever seen. Nothing! Certainly, she was a book
  thief, but that didnt mean she should have no manners at all. It didnt mean she couldnt be
  polite.

  

  She walked a good few minutes, struggling with indecision.

  

  On Munich Street, it came to an end.

  

  Just as she could make out the sign that said STEINER SCHNEIDERMEISTER, she turned and ran
  back.

  

  This time, there was no hesitation.

  

  She thumped the door, sending an echo of brass through the wood.

  

  Scheisse!

  

  It was not the mayors wife, but the mayor himself who stood before her. In her hurry, Liesel had
  neglected to notice the car that sat out front, on the street.

  

  Mustached and black-suited, the man spoke. Can I help you?

  

  Liesel could say nothing. Not yet. She was bent over, short of air, and fortunately, the woman
  arrived when shed at least partially recovered. Ilsa Hermann stood behind her husband, to the
  side.

  

  I forgot, Liesel said. She lifted the bag and addressed the mayors wife. Despite the forced labor
  of breath, she fed the words through the gap in the doorwaybetween the mayor and the frame to the
  woman. Such was her effort to breathe that the words escaped only a few at a time. I forgot . . .
  I mean, I just . . . wanted, she said, to . . . thank you.

  

  The mayors wife bruised herself again. Coming forward to stand beside her husband, she nodded
  very faintly, waited, and closed the door.

  I forgot, Liesel said. She lifted the bag and addressed the mayors wife. Despite the forced labor
  of breath, she fed the words through the gap in the doorwaybetween the mayor and the frame to the
  woman. Such was her effort to breathe that the words escaped only a few at a time. I forgot . . .
  I mean, I just . . . wanted, she said, to . . . thank you.

  

  The mayors wife bruised herself again. Coming forward to stand beside her husband, she nodded
  very faintly, waited, and closed the door.

  

  It took Liesel a minute or so to leave.

  

  She smiled at the steps."|"The Book Thief"|"Markus Zusak"
"ap < 02:00"|"Just before two oclock"|"You could argue that Liesel Meminger had it easy. She did have it easy compared to Max
  Vandenburg. Certainly, her brother practically died in her arms. Her mother abandoned her.

  

  But anything was better than being a Jew.

  

  In the time leading up to Maxs arrival, another washing customer was lost, this time the
  Weingartners. The obligatory Schimpferei occurred in the kitchen, and Liesel composed
  herself with the fact that there were still two left, and even better, one of them was the mayor,
  the wife, the books.

  

  As for Liesels other activities, she was still causing havoc with Rudy Steiner. I would even
  suggest that they were polishing their wicked ways.

  

  They made a few more journeys with Arthur Berg and his friends, keen to prove their worth and
  extend their thieving repertoire. They took potatoes from one farm, onions from another. Their
  biggest victory, however, they performed alone.

  

  As witnessed earlier, one of the benefits of walking through town was the prospect of finding
  things on the ground. Another was noticing people, or more important, the same people,
  doing identical things week after week.

  

  A boy from school, Otto Sturm, was one such person. Every Friday afternoon, he rode his bike to
  church, carrying goods to the priests.

  

  For a month, they watched him, as good weather turned to bad, and Rudy in particular was
  determined that one Friday, in an abnormally frosty week in October, Otto wouldnt quite make
  it.

  

  All those priests, Rudy explained as they walked through town. Theyre all too fat anyway. They
  could do without a feed for a week or so. Liesel could only agree. First of all, she wasnt
  Catholic. Second, she was pretty hungry herself. As always, she was carrying the washing. Rudy
  was carrying two buckets of cold water, or as he put it, two buckets of future ice.

  

  Just before two oclock, he went to work.

  

  Without any hesitation, he poured the water onto the road in the exact position where Otto would
  pedal around the corner.

  

  Liesel had to admit it.

  

  There was a small portion of guilt at first, but the plan was perfect, or at least as close to
  perfect as it could be. At just after two oclock every Friday, Otto Sturm turned onto Munich
  Street with the produce in his front basket, at the handlebars. On this particular Friday, that
  was as far as he would travel.

  

  The road was icy as it was, but Rudy put on the extra coat, barely able to contain a grin. It ran
  across his face like a skid.

  

  Come on, he said, that bush there.

  

  After approximately fifteen minutes, the diabolical plan bore its fruit, so to speak.

  

  Rudy pointed his finger into a gap in the bush. There he is.

  

  Otto came around the corner, dopey as a lamb.

  

  He wasted no time in losing control of the bike, sliding across the ice, and lying facedown on
  the road.

  

  When he didnt move, Rudy looked at Liesel with alarm. Crucified Christ, he said, I think we might
  have killed him! He crept slowly out, removed the basket, and they made their
  getaway.

  

  Was he breathing? Liesel asked, farther down the street.

  

  Keine Ahnung, Rudy said, clinging to the basket. He had no idea.

  

  From far down the hill, they watched as Otto stood up, scratched his head, scratched his crotch,
  and looked everywhere for the basket.

  

  Stupid Scheisskopf. Rudy grinned, and they looked through the spoils. Bread, broken eggs,
  and the big one, Speck. Rudy held the fatty ham to his nose and breathed it gloriously in.
  Beautiful.

  

  As tempting as it was to keep the victory to themselves, they were overpowered by a sense of
  loyalty to Arthur Berg. They made their way to his impoverished lodging on Kempf Strasse and
  showed him the produce. Arthur couldnt hold back his approval.

  

  Who did you steal this from?

  

  It was Rudy who answered. Otto Sturm.

  

  Well, he nodded, whoever that is, Im grateful to him. He walked inside and returned with a bread
  knife, a frying pan, and a jacket, and the three thieves walked the hallway of apartments. Well
  get the others, Arthur Berg stated as they made it outside. We might be criminals, but were not
  totally immoral. Much like the book thief, he at least drew the line somewhere.

  

  A few more doors were knocked on. Names were called out to apartments from streets below, and
  soon, the whole conglomerate of Arthur Bergs fruit-stealing troop was on its way to the Amper. In
  the clearing on the other side, a fire was lit and what was left of the eggs was salvaged and
  fried. The bread and Speck were cut. With hands and knives, every last piece of Otto
  Sturms delivery was eaten. No priest in sight.

  

  It was only at the end that an argument developed, regarding the basket. The majority of boys
  wanted to burn it. Fritz Hammer and Andy Schmeikl wanted to keep it, but Arthur Berg, showing his
  incongruous moral aptitude, had a better idea.

  

  You two, he said to Rudy and Liesel. Maybe you should take it back to that Sturm character. Id
  say that poor bastard probably deserves that much.

  

  Oh, come on, Arthur.

  

  I dont want to hear it, Andy.

  

  Jesus Christ.

  

  He doesnt want to hear it, either.

  

  The group laughed and Rudy Steiner picked up the basket. Ill take it back and hang it on their
  mailbox.

  

  He had walked only twenty meters or so when the girl caught up. She would be home far too late
  for comfort, but she was well aware that she had to accompany Rudy Steiner through town, to the
  Sturm farm on the other side.

  

  For a long time, they walked in silence.

  

  Do you feel bad? Liesel finally asked. They were already on the way home.

  

  About what?

  

  You know.

  

  Of course I do, but Im not hungry anymore, and I bet hes not hungry, either. Dont think
  for a second that the priests would get food if there wasnt enough to go around at home.

  

  He just hit the ground so hard.

  

  Dont remind me. But Rudy Steiner couldnt resist smiling. In years to come, he would be a giver of
  bread, not a stealerproof again of the contradictory human being. So much good, so much evil.
  Just add water.

  

  Five days after their bittersweet little victory, Arthur Berg emerged again and invited them on
  his next stealing project. They ran into him on Munich Street, on the way home from school on a
  Wednesday. He was already in his Hitler Youth uniform. Were going again tomorrow afternoon. You
  interested?

  

  They couldnt help themselves. Where?

  

  The potato place.

  

  Twenty-four hours later, Liesel and Rudy braved the wire fence again and filled their sack.

  

  The problem showed up as they made their getaway.

  

  Christ! shouted Arthur. The farmer! It was his next word, however, that frightened. He called it
  out as if hed already been attacked with it. His mouth ripped open. The word flew out, and the
  word was ax.

  

  Sure enough, when they turned around, the farmer was running at them, the weapon held
  aloft.

  

  The whole group ran for the fence line and made their way over. Rudy, who was farthest away,
  caught up quickly, but not quickly enough to avoid being last. As he pulled his leg up, he became
  entangled.

  

  Hey!

  

  The sound of the stranded.

  

  The group stopped.

  

  Instinctively, Liesel ran back.

  

  Hurry up! Arthur called out. His voice was far away, as if hed swallowed it before it exited his
  mouth.

  

  White sky.

  

  The others ran.

  

  Liesel arrived and started pulling at the fabric of his pants. Rudys eyes were opened wide with
  fear. Quick, he said, hes coming.

  

  Far off, they could still hear the sound of deserting feet when an extra hand grabbed the wire
  and reefed it away from Rudy Steiners pants. A piece was left on the metallic knot, but the boy
  was able to escape.

  

  Now move it, Arthur advised them, not long before the farmer arrived, swearing and struggling for
  breath. The ax held on now, with force, to his leg. He called out the futile words of the
  robbed:

  

  Ill have you arrested! Ill find you! Ill find out who you are!

  

  That was when Arthur Berg replied.

  

  The name is Owens! He loped away, catching up to Liesel and Rudy. Jesse Owens!

  

  When they made it to safe ground, fighting to suck the air into their lungs, they sat down and
  Arthur Berg came over. Rudy wouldnt look at him. Its happened to all of us, Arthur said, sensing
  the disappointment. Was he lying? They couldnt be sure and they would never find out.

  

  A few weeks later, Arthur Berg moved to Cologne.

  

  They saw him once more, on one of Liesels washing delivery rounds. In an alleyway off Munich
  Street, he handed Liesel a brown paper bag containing a dozen chestnuts. He smirked. A contact in
  the roasting industry. After informing them of his departure, he managed to proffer a last pimply
  smile and to cuff each of them on the forehead. Dont go eating all those things at once, either,
  and they never saw Arthur Berg again.

07:00|"7 a.m."|"For the next year, Hans was lucky that he didnt revoke his membership application officially.
  While many people were instantly approved, he was added to a waiting list, regarded with
  suspicion. Toward the end of 1938, when the Jews were cleared out completely after Kristallnacht,
  the Gestapo visited. They searched the house, and when nothing or no one suspicious was found,
  Hans Hubermann was one of the fortunate:

  

  He was allowed to stay.

  

  What probably saved him was that people knew he was at least waiting for his application
  to be approved. For this, he was tolerated, if not endorsed as the competent painter he
  was.

  

  Then there was his other savior.

  

  It was the accordion that most likely spared him from total ostracism. Painters there were, from
  all over Munich, but under the brief tutorage of Erik Vandenburg and nearly two decades of his
  own steady practice, there was no one in Molching who could play exactly like him. It was a style
  not of perfection, but warmth. Even mistakes had a good feeling about them.

  

  He heil Hitlered when it was asked of him and he flew the flag on the right days. There
  was no apparent problem.

  

  Then, on June 16, 1939 (the date was like cement now), just over six months after Liesels arrival
  on Himmel Street, an event occurred that altered the life of Hans Hubermann irreversibly.

  

  It was a day in which he had some work.

  

  He left the house at 7 a.m. sharp.

  

  He towed his paint cart behind him, oblivious to the fact that he was being followed.

  

  When he arrived at the work site, a young stranger walked up to him. He was blond and tall, and
  serious.

  

  The pair watched each other.

  

  Would you be Hans Hubermann?

  

  Hans gave him a single nod. He was reaching for a paintbrush. Yes, I would.

  

  Do you play the accordion, by any chance?

  

  This time, Hans stopped, leaving the brush where it was. Again, he nodded.

  

  The stranger rubbed his jaw, looked around him, and then spoke with great quietness, yet great
  clarity. Are you a man who likes to keep a promise?

  

  Hans took out two paint cans and invited him to sit down. Before he accepted the invitation, the
  young man extended his hand and introduced himself. My names Kugler. Walter. I come from
  Stuttgart.

  

  They sat and talked quietly for fifteen minutes or so, arranging a meeting for later on, in the
  night."|"The Book Thief"|"Markus Zusak"
"ap 01:03"|103|"Max Vandenburg was born in 1916.

  

  He grew up in Stuttgart.

  

  When he was younger, he grew to love nothing more than a good fistfight.

  

  He had his first bout when he was eleven years old and skinny as a whittled broom handle.

  

  Wenzel Gruber.

  

  Thats who he fought.

  

  He had a smart mouth, that Gruber kid, and wire-curly hair. The local playground demanded that
  they fight, and neither boy was about to argue.

  

  They fought like champions.

  

  For a minute.

  

  Just when it was getting interesting, both boys were hauled away by their collars. A watchful
  parent.

  

  A trickle of blood was dripping from Maxs mouth.

  

  He tasted it, and it tasted good.

  

  Not many people who came from his neighborhood were fighters, and if they were, they didnt do it
  with their fists. In those days, they said the Jews preferred to simply stand and take things.
  Take the abuse quietly and then work their way back to the top. Obviously, every Jew is not the
  same.

  

  He was nearly two years old when his father died, shot to pieces on a grassy hill.

  

  When he was nine, his mother was completely broke. She sold the music studio that doubled as
  their apartment and they moved to his uncles house. There he grew up with six cousins who
  battered, annoyed, and loved him. Fighting with the oldest one, Isaac, was the training ground
  for his fist fighting. He was trounced almost every night.

  

  At thirteen, tragedy struck again when his uncle died.

  

  As percentages would suggest, his uncle was not a hothead like Max. He was the type of person who
  worked quietly away for very little reward. He kept to himself and sacrificed everything for his
  familyand he died of something growing in his stomach. Something akin to a poison bowling
  ball.

  

  As is often the case, the family surrounded the bed and watched him capitulate.

  

  Somehow, between the sadness and loss, Max Vandenburg, who was now a teenager with hard hands,
  blackened eyes, and a sore tooth, was also a little disappointed. Even disgruntled. As he watched
  his uncle sink slowly into the bed, he decided that he would never allow himself to die like
  that.

  

  The mans face was so accepting.

  

  So yellow and tranquil, despite the violent architecture of his skullthe endless jawline,
  stretching for miles; the pop-up cheekbones; and the pothole eyes. So calm it made the boy want
  to ask something.

  

  Wheres the fight? he wondered.

  

  Wheres the will to hold on?

  

  Of course, at thirteen, he was a little excessive in his harshness. He had not looked something
  like me in the face. Not yet.

  

  With the rest of them, he stood around the bed and watched the man diea safe merge, from life to
  death. The light in the window was gray and orange, the color of summers skin, and his uncle
  appeared relieved when his breathing disappeared completely.

  

  When death captures me, the boy vowed, he will feel my fist on his face.

  

  Personally, I quite like that. Such stupid gallantry.

  

  Yes.

  

  I like that a lot.

  

  From that moment on, he started to fight with greater regularity. A group of die-hard friends and
  enemies would gather down at a small reserve on Steber Street, and they would fight in the dying
  light. Archetypal Germans, the odd Jew, the boys from the east. It didnt matter. There was
  nothing like a good fight to expel the teenage energy. Even the enemies were an inch away from
  friendship.

  

  He enjoyed the tight circles and the unknown.

  

  The bittersweetness of uncertainty:

  

  To win or to lose.

  

  It was a feeling in the stomach that would be stirred around until he thought he could no longer
  tolerate it. The only remedy was to move forward and throw punches. Max was not the type of boy
  to die thinking about it.

  

  His favorite fight, now that he looked back, was Fight Number Five against a tall, tough, rangy
  kid named Walter Kugler. They were fifteen. Walter had won all four of their previous encounters,
  but this time, Max could feel something different. There was new blood in himthe blood of
  victoryand it had the capability to both frighten and excite.

  

  As always, there was a tight circle crowded around them. There was grubby ground. There were
  smiles practically wrapped around the onlooking faces. Money was clutched in filthy fingers, and
  the calls and cries were filled with such vitality that there was nothing else but this.

  

  God, there was such joy and fear there, such brilliant commotion.

  

  The two fighters were clenched with the intensity of the moment, their faces loaded up with
  expression, exaggerated with the stress of it. The wide-eyed concentration.

  

  After a minute or so of testing each other out, they began moving closer and taking more risks.
  It was a street fight after all, not an hour-long title fight. They didnt have all day.

  

  Come on, Max! one of his friends was calling out. There was no breath between any of the words.
  Come on, Maxi Taxi, youve got him now, youve got him, Jew boy, youve got him, youve got
  him!

  

  A small kid with soft tufts of hair, a beaten nose, and swampy eyes, Max was a good head shorter
  than his opposition. His fighting style was utterly graceless, all bent over, nudging forward,
  throwing fast punches at the face of Kugler. The other boy, clearly stronger and more skillful,
  remained upright, throwing jabs that constantly landed on Maxs cheeks and chin.

  

  Max kept coming.

  

  Even with the heavy absorption of punches and punishment, he continued moving forward. Blood
  discolored his lips. It would soon be dried across his teeth.

  

  There was a great roar when he was knocked down. Money was almost exchanged.

  

  Max stood up.

  

  He was beaten down one more time before he changed tactics, luring Walter Kugler a little closer
  than hed wanted to come. Once he was there, Max was able to apply a short, sharp jab to his face.
  It stuck. Exactly on the nose.

  

  Kugler, suddenly blinded, shuffled back, and Max seized his chance. He followed him over to the
  right and jabbed him once more and opened him up with a punch that reached into his ribs. The
  right hand that ended him landed on his chin. Walter Kugler was on the ground, his blond hair
  peppered with dirt. His legs were parted in a V. Tears like crystal floated down his skin,
  despite the fact that he was not crying. The tears had been bashed out of him.

  

  The circle counted.

  

  They always counted, just in case. Voices and numbers.

  

  The custom after a fight was that the loser would raise the hand of the victor. When Kugler
  finally stood up, he walked sullenly to Max Vandenburg and lifted his arm into the air.

  

  Thanks, Max told him.

  

  Kugler proffered a warning. Next time I kill you.

  

  Altogether, over the next few years, Max Vandenburg and Walter Kugler fought thirteen times.
  Walter was always seeking revenge for that first victory Max took from him, and Max was looking
  to emulate his moment of glory. In the end, the record stood at 103 for Walter.

  

  They fought each other until 1933, when they were seventeen. Grudging respect turned to genuine
  friendship, and the urge to fight left them. Both held jobs until Max was sacked with the rest of
  the Jews at the Jedermann Engineering Factory in 35. That wasnt long after the Nuremberg Laws
  came in, forbidding Jews to have German citizenship and for Germans and Jews to intermarry.

  

  Jesus, Walter said one evening, when they met on the small corner where they used to fight. That
  was a time, wasnt it? There was none of this around. He gave the star on Maxs sleeve a backhanded
  slap. We could never fight like that now.

  

  Max disagreed. Yes we could. You cant marry a Jew, but theres no law against fighting one.

  

  Walter smiled. Theres probably a law rewarding itas long as you win.

  

  For the next few years, they saw each other sporadically at best. Max, with the rest of the Jews,
  was steadily rejected and repeatedly trodden upon, while Walter disappeared inside his job. A
  printing firm.

  

  If youre the type whos interested, yes, there were a few girls in those years. One named Tania,
  the other Hildi. Neither of them lasted. There was no time, most likely due to the uncertainty
  and mounting pressure. Max needed to scavenge for work. What could he offer those girls? By 1938,
  it was difficult to imagine that life could get any harder.

  

  Then came November 9. Kristallnacht. The night of broken glass.

  

  It was the very incident that destroyed so many of his fellow Jews, but it proved to be Max
  Vandenburgs moment of escape. He was twenty-two.

  

  Many Jewish establishments were being surgically smashed and looted when there was a clatter of
  knuckles on the apartment door. With his aunt, his mother, his cousins, and their children, Max
  was crammed into the living room.

  

  Aufmachen!

  

  The family watched each other. There was a great temptation to scatter into the other rooms, but
  apprehension is the strangest thing. They couldnt move.

  

  Again. Open up!

  

  Isaac stood and walked to the door. The wood was alive, still humming from the beating it had
  just been given. He looked back at the faces naked with fear, turned the lock, and opened the
  door.

  

  As expected, it was a Nazi. In uniform.

  

  Never.

  

  That was Maxs first response.

  

  He clung to his mothers hand and that of Sarah, the nearest of his cousins. I wont leave. If we
  all cant go, I dont go, either.

  

  He was lying.

  

  When he was pushed out by the rest of his family, the relief struggled inside him like an
  obscenity. It was something he didnt want to feel, but nonetheless, he felt it with such gusto it
  made him want to throw up. How could he? How could he?

  

  But he did.

  

  Bring nothing, Walter told him. Just what youre wearing. Ill give you the rest.

  

  Max. It was his mother.

  

  From a drawer, she took an old piece of paper and stuffed it in his jacket pocket. If ever . . .
  She held him one last time, by the elbows. This could be your last hope.

  

  He looked into her aging face and kissed her, very hard, on the lips.

  

  Come on. Walter pulled at him as the rest of the family said their goodbyes and gave him money
  and a few valuables. Its chaos out there, and chaos is what we need.

  

  They left, without looking back.

  

  It tortured him.

  

  If only hed turned for one last look at his family as he left the apartment. Perhaps then the
  guilt would not have been so heavy. No final goodbye.

  

  No final grip of the eyes.

  

  Nothing but goneness.

  

  For the next two years, he remained in hiding, in an empty storeroom. It was in a building where
  Walter had worked in previous years. There was very little food. There was plenty of suspicion.
  The remaining Jews with money in the neighborhood were emigrating. The Jews without money were
  also trying, but without much success. Maxs family fell into the latter category. Walter checked
  on them occasionally, as inconspicuously as he could. One afternoon, when he visited, someone
  else opened the door.

  

  When Max heard the news, his body felt like it was being screwed up into a ball, like a page
  littered with mistakes. Like garbage.

  

  Yet each day, he managed to unravel and straighten himself, disgusted and thankful. Wrecked, but
  somehow not torn into pieces.

  

  Halfway through 1939, just over six months into the period of hiding, they decided that a new
  course of action needed to be taken. They examined the piece of paper Max was handed upon his
  desertion. Thats righthis desertion, not only his escape. That was how he viewed it, amid the
  grotesquerie of his relief. We already know what was written on that piece of paper:"|"The Book Thief"|"Markus Zusak"
19:33|1933|"Max Vandenburg was born in 1916.

  

  He grew up in Stuttgart.

  

  When he was younger, he grew to love nothing more than a good fistfight.

  

  He had his first bout when he was eleven years old and skinny as a whittled broom handle.

  

  Wenzel Gruber.

  

  Thats who he fought.

  

  He had a smart mouth, that Gruber kid, and wire-curly hair. The local playground demanded that
  they fight, and neither boy was about to argue.

  

  They fought like champions.

  

  For a minute.

  

  Just when it was getting interesting, both boys were hauled away by their collars. A watchful
  parent.

  

  A trickle of blood was dripping from Maxs mouth.

  

  He tasted it, and it tasted good.

  

  Not many people who came from his neighborhood were fighters, and if they were, they didnt do it
  with their fists. In those days, they said the Jews preferred to simply stand and take things.
  Take the abuse quietly and then work their way back to the top. Obviously, every Jew is not the
  same.

  

  He was nearly two years old when his father died, shot to pieces on a grassy hill.

  

  When he was nine, his mother was completely broke. She sold the music studio that doubled as
  their apartment and they moved to his uncles house. There he grew up with six cousins who
  battered, annoyed, and loved him. Fighting with the oldest one, Isaac, was the training ground
  for his fist fighting. He was trounced almost every night.

  

  At thirteen, tragedy struck again when his uncle died.

  

  As percentages would suggest, his uncle was not a hothead like Max. He was the type of person who
  worked quietly away for very little reward. He kept to himself and sacrificed everything for his
  familyand he died of something growing in his stomach. Something akin to a poison bowling
  ball.

  

  As is often the case, the family surrounded the bed and watched him capitulate.

  

  Somehow, between the sadness and loss, Max Vandenburg, who was now a teenager with hard hands,
  blackened eyes, and a sore tooth, was also a little disappointed. Even disgruntled. As he watched
  his uncle sink slowly into the bed, he decided that he would never allow himself to die like
  that.

  

  The mans face was so accepting.

  

  So yellow and tranquil, despite the violent architecture of his skullthe endless jawline,
  stretching for miles; the pop-up cheekbones; and the pothole eyes. So calm it made the boy want
  to ask something.

  

  Wheres the fight? he wondered.

  

  Wheres the will to hold on?

  

  Of course, at thirteen, he was a little excessive in his harshness. He had not looked something
  like me in the face. Not yet.

  

  With the rest of them, he stood around the bed and watched the man diea safe merge, from life to
  death. The light in the window was gray and orange, the color of summers skin, and his uncle
  appeared relieved when his breathing disappeared completely.

  

  When death captures me, the boy vowed, he will feel my fist on his face.

  

  Personally, I quite like that. Such stupid gallantry.

  

  Yes.

  

  I like that a lot.

  

  From that moment on, he started to fight with greater regularity. A group of die-hard friends and
  enemies would gather down at a small reserve on Steber Street, and they would fight in the dying
  light. Archetypal Germans, the odd Jew, the boys from the east. It didnt matter. There was
  nothing like a good fight to expel the teenage energy. Even the enemies were an inch away from
  friendship.

  

  He enjoyed the tight circles and the unknown.

  

  The bittersweetness of uncertainty:

  

  To win or to lose.

  

  It was a feeling in the stomach that would be stirred around until he thought he could no longer
  tolerate it. The only remedy was to move forward and throw punches. Max was not the type of boy
  to die thinking about it.

  

  His favorite fight, now that he looked back, was Fight Number Five against a tall, tough, rangy
  kid named Walter Kugler. They were fifteen. Walter had won all four of their previous encounters,
  but this time, Max could feel something different. There was new blood in himthe blood of
  victoryand it had the capability to both frighten and excite.

  

  As always, there was a tight circle crowded around them. There was grubby ground. There were
  smiles practically wrapped around the onlooking faces. Money was clutched in filthy fingers, and
  the calls and cries were filled with such vitality that there was nothing else but this.

  

  God, there was such joy and fear there, such brilliant commotion.

  

  The two fighters were clenched with the intensity of the moment, their faces loaded up with
  expression, exaggerated with the stress of it. The wide-eyed concentration.

  

  After a minute or so of testing each other out, they began moving closer and taking more risks.
  It was a street fight after all, not an hour-long title fight. They didnt have all day.

  

  Come on, Max! one of his friends was calling out. There was no breath between any of the words.
  Come on, Maxi Taxi, youve got him now, youve got him, Jew boy, youve got him, youve got
  him!

  

  A small kid with soft tufts of hair, a beaten nose, and swampy eyes, Max was a good head shorter
  than his opposition. His fighting style was utterly graceless, all bent over, nudging forward,
  throwing fast punches at the face of Kugler. The other boy, clearly stronger and more skillful,
  remained upright, throwing jabs that constantly landed on Maxs cheeks and chin.

  

  Max kept coming.

  

  Even with the heavy absorption of punches and punishment, he continued moving forward. Blood
  discolored his lips. It would soon be dried across his teeth.

  

  There was a great roar when he was knocked down. Money was almost exchanged.

  

  Max stood up.

  

  He was beaten down one more time before he changed tactics, luring Walter Kugler a little closer
  than hed wanted to come. Once he was there, Max was able to apply a short, sharp jab to his face.
  It stuck. Exactly on the nose.

  

  Kugler, suddenly blinded, shuffled back, and Max seized his chance. He followed him over to the
  right and jabbed him once more and opened him up with a punch that reached into his ribs. The
  right hand that ended him landed on his chin. Walter Kugler was on the ground, his blond hair
  peppered with dirt. His legs were parted in a V. Tears like crystal floated down his skin,
  despite the fact that he was not crying. The tears had been bashed out of him.

  

  The circle counted.

  

  They always counted, just in case. Voices and numbers.

  

  The custom after a fight was that the loser would raise the hand of the victor. When Kugler
  finally stood up, he walked sullenly to Max Vandenburg and lifted his arm into the air.

  

  Thanks, Max told him.

  

  Kugler proffered a warning. Next time I kill you.

  

  Altogether, over the next few years, Max Vandenburg and Walter Kugler fought thirteen times.
  Walter was always seeking revenge for that first victory Max took from him, and Max was looking
  to emulate his moment of glory. In the end, the record stood at 103 for Walter.

  

  They fought each other until 1933, when they were seventeen. Grudging respect turned to genuine
  friendship, and the urge to fight left them. Both held jobs until Max was sacked with the rest of
  the Jews at the Jedermann Engineering Factory in 35. That wasnt long after the Nuremberg Laws
  came in, forbidding Jews to have German citizenship and for Germans and Jews to intermarry.

  

  Jesus, Walter said one evening, when they met on the small corner where they used to fight. That
  was a time, wasnt it? There was none of this around. He gave the star on Maxs sleeve a backhanded
  slap. We could never fight like that now.

  

  Max disagreed. Yes we could. You cant marry a Jew, but theres no law against fighting one.

  

  Walter smiled. Theres probably a law rewarding itas long as you win.

  

  For the next few years, they saw each other sporadically at best. Max, with the rest of the Jews,
  was steadily rejected and repeatedly trodden upon, while Walter disappeared inside his job. A
  printing firm.

  

  If youre the type whos interested, yes, there were a few girls in those years. One named Tania,
  the other Hildi. Neither of them lasted. There was no time, most likely due to the uncertainty
  and mounting pressure. Max needed to scavenge for work. What could he offer those girls? By 1938,
  it was difficult to imagine that life could get any harder.

  Isaac stood and walked to the door. The wood was alive, still humming from the beating it had
  just been given. He looked back at the faces naked with fear, turned the lock, and opened the
  door.

  

  As expected, it was a Nazi. In uniform.

  

  Never.

  somehow not torn into pieces.

  

  Halfway through 1939, just over six months into the period of hiding, they decided that a new
  course of action needed to be taken. They examined the piece of paper Max was handed upon his
  desertion. Thats righthis desertion, not only his escape. That was how he viewed it, amid the
  grotesquerie of his relief. We already know what was written on that piece of paper:"|"The Book Thief"|"Markus Zusak"
"ap > 08:30"|"just after eight-thirty"|"When a Jew shows up at your place of residence in the early hours of morning, in the very
  birthplace of Nazism, youre likely to experience extreme levels of discomfort. Anxiety,
  disbelief, paranoia. Each plays its part, and each leads to a sneaking suspicion that a less than
  heavenly consequence awaits. The fear is shiny. Ruthless in the eyes.

  

  The surprising point to make is that despite this iridescent fear glowing as it did in the dark,
  they somehow resisted the urge for hysteria.

  

  Mama ordered Liesel away.

  

  Bett, Saumensch. The voice calm but firm. Highly unusual.

  

  Papa came in a few minutes later and lifted the covers on the vacant bed.

  

  Alles gut, Liesel? Is everything good?

  

  Yes, Papa.

  

  As you can see, we have a visitor. She could only just make out the shape of Hans Hubermanns
  tallness in the dark. Hell sleep in here tonight.

  

  Yes, Papa.

  

  A few minutes later, Max Vandenburg was in the room, noiseless and opaque. The man did not
  breathe. He did not move. Yet, somehow, he traveled from the doorway to the bed and was under the
  covers.

  

  Everything good?

  

  It was Papa again, talking this time to Max.

  

  The reply floated from his mouth, then molded itself like a stain to the ceiling. Such was his
  feeling of shame. Yes. Thank you. He said it again, when Papa made his way over to his customary
  position in the chair next to Liesels bed. Thank you.

  

  Another hour passed before Liesel fell asleep.

  

  She slept hard and long.

  

  A hand woke her just after eight-thirty the next morning.

  

  The voice at the end of it informed her that she would not be attending school that day.
  Apparently, she was sick.

  

  When she awoke completely, she watched the stranger in the bed opposite. The blanket showed only
  a nest of lopsided hair at the top, and there was not a sound, as if hed somehow trained himself
  even to sleep more quietly. With great care, she walked the length of him, following Papa to the
  hall.

  

  For the first time ever, the kitchen and Mama were dormant. It was a kind of bemused, inaugural
  silence. To Liesels relief, it lasted only a few minutes.

  

  There was food and the sound of eating.

  

  Mama announced the days priority. She sat at the table and said, Now listen, Liesel. Papas going
  to tell you something today. This was seriousshe didnt even say Saumensch. It was a
  personal feat of abstinence. Hell talk to you and you have to listen. Is that clear?

  

  The girl was still swallowing.

  

  Is that clear, Saumensch?

  

  That was better.

  

  The girl nodded.

  

  When she reentered the bedroom to fetch her clothes, the body in the opposite bed had turned and
  curled up. It was no longer a straight log but a kind of Z shape, reaching diagonally from corner
  to corner. Zigzagging the bed.

  

  She could see his face now, in the tired light. His mouth was open and his skin was the color of
  eggshells. Whiskers coated his jaw and chin, and his ears were hard and flat. He had a small but
  misshapen nose.

  

  Liesel!

  

  She turned.

  

  Move it!

  

  She moved, to the washroom.

  

  Once changed and in the hallway, she realized she would not be traveling far. Papa was standing
  in front of the door to the basement. He smiled very faintly, lit the lamp, and led her
  down.

  

  Among the mounds of drop sheets and the smell of paint, Papa told her to make herself
  comfortable. Ignited on the walls were the painted words, learned in the past. I need to tell you
  some things.

  

  Liesel sat on top of a meter-tall heap of drop sheets, Papa on a fifteen-liter paint can. For a
  few minutes, he searched for the words. When they came, he stood to deliver them. He rubbed his
  eyes.

  

  Liesel, he said quietly, I was never sure if any of this would happen, so I never told you. About
  me. About the man upstairs. He walked from one end of the basement to the other, the lamplight
  magnifying his shadow. It turned him into a giant on the wall, walking back and forth.

  

  When he stopped pacing, his shadow loomed behind him, watching. Someone was always
  watching.

  

  You know my accordion? he said, and there the story began.

  

  He explained World War I and Erik Vandenburg, and then the visit to the fallen soldiers wife. The
  boy who came into the room that day is the man upstairs. Verstehst? Understand?

  

  The book thief sat and listened to Hans Hubermanns story. It lasted a good hour, until the moment
  of truth, which involved a very obvious and necessary lecture.

  

  Liesel, you must listen. Papa made her stand up and held her hand.

  

  They faced the wall.

  

  Dark shapes and the practice of words.

  

  Firmly, he held her fingers.

  

  Remember the Fhrers birthdaywhen we walked home from the fire that night? Remember what
  you promised me?

  

  The girl concurred. To the wall, she said, That I would keep a secret.

  

  Thats right. Between the hand-holding shadows, the painted words were scattered about, perched on
  their shoulders, resting on their heads, and hanging from their arms. Liesel, if you tell anyone
  about the man up there, we will all be in big trouble. He walked the fine line of scaring her
  into oblivion and soothing her enough to keep her calm. He fed her the sentences and watched with
  his metallic eyes. Desperation and placidity. At the very least, Mama and I will be taken away.
  Hans was clearly worried that he was on the verge of frightening her too much, but he calculated
  the risk, preferring to err on the side of too much fear rather than not enough. The girls
  compliance had to be an absolute, immutable fact.

  

  Toward the end, Hans Hubermann looked at Liesel Meminger and made certain she was focused.

  

  He gave her a list of consequences.

  

  If you tell anyone about that man . . .

  

  Her teacher.

  

  Rudy.

  

  It didnt matter whom.

  

  What mattered was that all were punishable.

  

  For starters, he said, I will take each and every one of your books and I will burn them. It was
  callous. Ill throw them in the stove or the fireplace. He was certainly acting like a tyrant, but
  it was necessary. Understand?

  

  The shock made a hole in her, very neat, very precise.

  

  Tears welled.

  

  Yes, Papa.

  

  Next. He had to remain hard, and he needed to strain for it. Theyll take you away from me. Do you
  want that?

  

  She was crying now, in earnest. Nein.

  

  Good. His grip on her hand tightened. Theyll drag that man up there away, and maybe Mama and me,
  tooand we will never, ever come back.

  

  And that did it.

  

  The girl began to sob so uncontrollably that Papa was dying to pull her into him and hug her
  tight. He didnt. Instead, he squatted down and watched her directly in the eyes. He unleashed his
  quietest words so far. Verstehst du mich? Do you understand me?

  

  The girl nodded. She cried, and now, defeated, broken, her papa held her in the painted air and
  the kerosene light.

  

  I understand, Papa, I do.

  

  Her voice was muffled against his body, and they stayed like that for a few minutes, Liesel with
  squashed breath and Papa rubbing her back.

  

  Upstairs, when they returned, they found Mama sitting in the kitchen, alone and pensive. When she
  saw them, she stood and beckoned Liesel to come over, noticing the dried-up tears that streaked
  her. She brought the girl into her and heaped a typically rugged embrace around her body.
  Alles gut, Saumensch?

  

  She didnt need an answer.

  

  Everything was good.

  

  But it was awful, too."|"The Book Thief"|"Markus Zusak"
"ap 03:00"|"three oclock"|"When Liesel looked back on the events of her life, those nights in the living room were some of
  the clearest memories she had. She could see the burning light on Maxs eggshell face and even
  taste the human flavor of his words. The course of his survival was related, piece by piece, as
  if he were cutting each part out of him and presenting it on a plate.

  

  Im so selfish.

  

  When he said that, he used his forearm to shield his face. Leaving people behind. Coming here.
  Putting all of you in danger . . . He dropped everything out of him and started pleading with
  them. Sorrow and desolation were clouted across his face. Im sorry. Do you believe me? Im so
  sorry, Im so sorry, Im!

  

  His arm touched the fire and he snapped it back.

  

  They all watched him, silent, until Papa stood and walked closer. He sat next to him.

  

  Did you burn your elbow?

  

  One evening, Hans, Max, and Liesel were sitting in front of the fire. Mama was in the kitchen.
  Max was reading Mein Kampf again.

  

  You know something? Hans said. He leaned toward the fire. Liesels actually a good little reader
  herself. Max lowered the book. And she has more in common with you than you might think. Papa
  checked that Rosa wasnt coming. She likes a good fistfight, too.

  

  Papa!

  

  Liesel, at the high end of eleven, and still rake-skinny as she sat against the wall, was
  devastated. Ive never been in a fight!

  

  Shhh, Papa laughed. He waved at her to keep her voice down and tilted again, this time to the
  girl. Well, what about the hiding you gave Ludwig Schmeikl, huh?

  

  I never She was caught. Further denial was useless. How did you find out about that?

  

  I saw his papa at the Knoller.

  

  Liesel held her face in her hands. Once uncovered again, she asked the pivotal question. Did you
  tell Mama?

  

  Are you kidding? He winked at Max and whispered to the girl, Youre still alive, arent you?

  

  That night was also the first time Papa played his accordion at home for months. It lasted half
  an hour or so until he asked a question of Max.

  

  Did you learn?

  

  The face in the corner watched the flames. I did. There was a considerable pause. Until I was
  nine. At that age, my mother sold the music studio and stopped teaching. She kept only the one
  instrument but gave up on me not long after I resisted the learning. I was foolish.

  

  No, Papa said. You were a boy.

  

  During the nights, both Liesel Meminger and Max Vandenburg would go about their other similarity.
  In their separate rooms, they would dream their nightmares and wake up, one with a scream in
  drowning sheets, the other with a gasp for air next to a smoking fire.

  

  Sometimes, when Liesel was reading with Papa close to three oclock, they would both hear the
  waking moment of Max. He dreams like you, Papa would say, and on one occasion, stirred by the
  sound of Maxs anxiety, Liesel decided to get out of bed. From listening to his history, she had a
  good idea of what he saw in those dreams, if not the exact part of the story that paid him a
  visit each night.

  

  She made her way quietly down the hallway and into the living and bedroom.

  

  Max?

  

  The whisper was soft, clouded in the throat of sleep.

  

  To begin with, there was no sound of reply, but he soon sat up and searched the darkness.

  

  With Papa still in her bedroom, Liesel sat on the other side of the fireplace from Max. Behind
  them, Mama loudly slept. She gave the snorer on the train a good run for her money.

  

  The fire was nothing now but a funeral of smoke, dead and dying, simultaneously. On this
  particular morning, there were also voices."|"The Book Thief"|"Markus Zusak"
"ap > 03:30"|"just after three-thirty"|"Tommy Mllers ears.

  

  Franz Deutscherthe irate Hitler Youth leader.

  

  Rudys inability to stay out of things.

  

  If only Tommy Mller hadnt disappeared for seven hours on one of the coldest days in Munichs
  history, six years earlier. His ear infections and nerve damage were still contorting the
  marching pattern at the Hitler Youth, which, I can assure you, was not a positive thing.

  

  To begin with, the downward slide of momentum was gradual, but as the months progressed, Tommy
  was consistently gathering the ire of the Hitler Youth leaders, especially when it came to the
  marching. Remember Hitlers birthday the previous year? For some time, the ear infections were
  getting worse. They had reached the point where Tommy had genuine problems hearing. He could not
  make out the commands that were shouted at the group as they marched in line. It didnt matter if
  it was in the hall or outside, in the snow or the mud or the slits of rain.

  

  The goal was always to have everyone stop at the same time.

  

  One click! they were told. Thats all the Fhrer wants to hear. Everyone united. Everyone
  together as one!

  

  Then Tommy.

  

  It was his left ear, I think. That was the most troublesome of the two, and when the bitter cry
  of Halt! wet the ears of everybody else, Tommy marched comically and obliviously on. He could
  transform a marching line into a dogs breakfast in the blink of an eye.

  

  On one particular Saturday, at the beginning of July, just after three-thirty and a litany of
  Tommy-inspired failed marching attempts, Franz Deutscher (the ultimate name for the ultimate
  teenage Nazi) was completely fed up.

  

  Mller, du A fe! His thick blond hair massaged his head and his words manipulated Tommys
  face. You apewhats wrong with you?

  

  Tommy slouched fearfully back, but his left cheek still managed to twitch in a manic, cheerful
  contortion. He appeared not only to be laughing with a triumphant smirk, but accepting the
  bucketing with glee. And Franz Deutscher wasnt having any of it. His pale eyes cooked him.

  

  Well? he asked. What can you say for yourself?

  

  Tommys twitch only increased, in both speed and depth.

  

  Are you mocking me?

  

  Heil, twitched Tommy, in a desperate attempt to buy some approval, but he did not make it
  to the Hitler part.

  

  That was when Rudy stepped forward. He faced Franz Deutscher, looking up at him. Hes got a
  problem, sir

  

  I can see that!

  

  With his ears, Rudy finished. He cant

  

  Right, thats it. Deutscher rubbed his hands together. Both of yousix laps of the grounds. They
  obeyed, but not fast enough. Schnell! His voice chased them.

  

  When the six laps were completed, they were given some drills of the rundrop downget upget down
  again variety, and after fifteen very long minutes, they were ordered to the ground for what
  should have been the last time.

  

  Rudy looked down.

  

  A warped circle of mud grinned up at him.

  

  What might you be looking at? it seemed to ask.

  

  Down! Franz ordered.

  

  Rudy naturally jumped over it and dropped to his stomach.

  

  Up! Franz smiled. One step back. They did it. Down!

  

  The message was clear and now, Rudy accepted it. He dived at the mud and held his breath, and at
  that moment, lying ear to sodden earth, the drill ended.

  

  Vielen Dank, meine Herren, Franz Deutscher politely said. Many thanks, my gentlemen.

  

  Rudy climbed to his knees, did some gardening in his ear, and looked across at Tommy.

  

  Tommy closed his eyes, and he twitched.

  

  When they returned to Himmel Street that day, Liesel was playing hopscotch with some of the
  younger kids, still in her BDM uniform. From the corner of her eye, she saw the two melancholic
  figures walking toward her. One of them called out.

  

  They met on the front step of the Steiners concrete shoe box of a house, and Rudy told her all
  about the days episode.

  

  After ten minutes, Liesel sat down.

  

  After eleven minutes, Tommy, who was sitting next to her, said, Its all my fault, but Rudy waved
  him away, somewhere between sentence and smile, chopping a mud streak in half with his finger.
  Its my Tommy tried again, but Rudy broke the sentence completely and pointed at him.

  

  Tommy, please. There was a peculiar look of contentment on Rudys face. Liesel had never seen
  someone so miserable yet so wholeheartedly alive. Just sit there andtwitchor something, and he
  continued with the story.

  

  He paced.

  

  He wrestled his tie.

  

  The words were flung at her, landing somewhere on the concrete step.

  

  That Deutscher, he summed up buoyantly. He got us, huh, Tommy?

  

  Tommy nodded, twitched, and spoke, not necessarily in that order. It was because of me.

  

  Tommy, what did I say?

  

  When?

  

  Now! Just keep quiet.

  

  Sure, Rudy.

  

  When Tommy walked forlornly home a short while later, Rudy tried what appeared to be a masterful
  new tactic.

  

  Pity.

  

  On the step, he perused the mud that had dried as a crusty sheet on his uniform, then looked
  Liesel hopelessly in the face. What about it, Saumensch?

  

  What about what?

  

  You know. . . .

  

  Liesel responded in the usual fashion.

  

  Saukerl, she laughed, and she walked the short distance home. A disconcerting mixture of
  mud and pity was one thing, but kissing Rudy Steiner was something entirely different.

  

  Smiling sadly on the step, he called out, rummaging a hand through his hair. One day, he warned
  her. One day, Liesel!

  

  In the basement, just over two years later, Liesel ached sometimes to go next door and see him,
  even if she was writing in the early hours of morning. She also realized it was most likely those
  sodden days at the Hitler Youth that had fed his, and subsequently her own, desire for
  crime.

  

  After all, despite the usual bouts of rain, summer was beginning to arrive properly. The
  Klar apples should have been ripening. There was more stealing to be done."|"The Book Thief"|"Markus Zusak"
"ap 04:10"|"ten past four"|"Unlike most people engaged in the various arts of thievery, Viktor Chemmel had it all. He lived
  in the best part of Molching, high up in a villa that had been fumigated when the Jews were
  driven out. He had money. He had cigarettes. What he wanted, however, was more.

  

  No crime in wanting a little more, he claimed, lying back in the grass with a collection of boys
  assembled around him. Wanting more is our fundamental right as Germans. What does our
  Fhrer say? He answered his own rhetoric. We must take what is rightfully ours!

  

  At face value, Viktor Chemmel was clearly your typical teenage bullshit artist. Unfortunately,
  when he felt like revealing it, he also possessed a certain charisma, a kind of follow
  me.

  

  When Liesel and Rudy approached the group by the river, she heard him ask another question. So
  where are these two deviants youve been bragging about? Its ten past four already.

  

  Not by my watch, said Rudy.

  

  Viktor Chemmel propped himself up on an elbow. Youre not wearing a watch.

  

  Would I be here if I was rich enough to own a watch?

  

  The new leader sat up fully and smiled, with straight white teeth. He then turned his casual
  focus onto the girl. Whos the little whore? Liesel, well accustomed to verbal abuse, simply
  watched the fog-ridden texture of his eyes.

  

  Last year, she listed, I stole at least three hundred apples and dozens of potatoes. I have
  little trouble with barbed wire fences and I can keep up with anyone here.

  

  Is that right?

  

  Yes. She did not shrink or step away. All I ask is a small part of anything we take. A dozen
  apples here or there. A few leftovers for me and my friend.

  

  Well, I suppose that can be arranged. Viktor lit a cigarette and raised it to his mouth. He made
  a concerted effort to blow his next mouthful in Liesels face.

  

  Liesel did not cough.

  

  It was the same group as the previous year, the only exception being the leader. Liesel wondered
  why none of the other boys had assumed the helm, but looking from face to face, she realized that
  none of them had it. They had no qualms about stealing, but they needed to be told. They
  liked to be told, and Viktor Chemmel liked to be the teller. It was a nice
  microcosm.

  

  For a moment, Liesel longed for the reappearance of Arthur Berg. Or would he, too, have fallen
  under the leadership of Chemmel? It didnt matter. Liesel only knew that Arthur Berg did not have
  a tyrannical bone in his body, whereas the new leader had hundreds of them. Last year, she knew
  that if she was stuck in a tree, Arthur would come back for her, despite claiming otherwise. This
  year, by comparison, she was instantly aware that Viktor Chemmel wouldnt even bother to look
  back.

  

  He stood, regarding the lanky boy and the malnourished-looking girl. So you want to steal with
  me?

  

  What did they have to lose? They nodded.

  

  He stepped closer and grabbed Rudys hair. I want to hear it.

  

  Definitely, Rudy said, before being shoved back, fringe first.

  

  And you?

  

  Of course. Liesel was quick enough to avoid the same treatment.

  

  Viktor smiled. He squashed his cigarette, breathed deeply in, and scratched his chest. My
  gentlemen, my whore, it looks like its time to go shopping.

  

  As the group walked off, Liesel and Rudy were at the back, as theyd always been in the
  past.

  

  Do you like him? Rudy whispered.

  

  Do you?

  

  Rudy paused a moment. I think hes a complete bastard.

  

  Me too.

  

  The group was getting away from them.

  

  Come on, Rudy said, weve fallen behind.

  

  After a few miles, they reached the first farm. What greeted them was a shock. The trees theyd
  imagined to be swollen with fruit were frail and injured-looking, with only a small array of
  apples hanging miserly from each branch. The next farm was the same. Maybe it was a bad season,
  or their timing wasnt quite right.

  

  By the end of the afternoon, when the spoils were handed out, Liesel and Rudy were given one
  diminutive apple between them. In fairness, the takings were incredibly poor, but Viktor Chemmel
  also ran a tighter ship.

  

  What do you call this? Rudy asked, the apple resting in his palm.

  

  Viktor didnt even turn around. What does it look like? The words were dropped over his
  shoulder.

  

  One lousy apple?

  

  Here. A half-eaten one was also tossed their way, landing chewed-side-down in the dirt. You can
  have that one, too.

  

  Rudy was incensed. To hell with this. We didnt walk ten miles for one and a half scrawny apples,
  did we, Liesel?

  

  Liesel did not answer.

  

  She did not have time, for Viktor Chemmel was on top of Rudy before she could utter a word. His
  knees had pinned Rudys arms and his hands were around his throat. The apples were scooped up by
  none other than Andy Schmeikl, at Viktors request.

  

  Youre hurting him, Liesel said.

  

  Am I? Viktor was smiling again. She hated that smile.

  

  Hes not hurting me. Rudys words were rushed together and his face was red with strain. His
  nose began to bleed.

  

  After an extended moment or two of increased pressure, Viktor let Rudy go and climbed off him,
  taking a few careless steps. He said, Get up, boy, and Rudy, choosing wisely, did as he was
  told.

  

  Viktor came casually closer again and faced him. He gave him a gentle rub on the arm. A whisper.
  Unless you want me to turn that blood into a fountain, I suggest you go away, little boy. He
  looked at Liesel. And take the little slut with you.

  

  No one moved.

  

  Well, what are you waiting for?

  

  Liesel took Rudys hand and they left, but not before Rudy turned one last time and spat some
  blood and saliva at Viktor Chemmels feet. It evoked one final remark."|"The Book Thief"|"Markus Zusak"
01:00|"One in the morning"|"Liesel placed The Dream Carrier beneath her jacket and began reading it the minute she
  returned home. In the wooden chair next to her bed, she opened the book and whispered, Its a new
  one, Max. Just for you. She started reading. Chapter one: It was quite fitting that the entire
  town was sleeping when the dream carrier was born. . . .

  

  Every day, Liesel read two chapters of the book. One in the morning before school and one as soon
  as she came home. On certain nights, when she was not able to sleep, she read half of a third
  chapter as well. Sometimes she would fall asleep slumped forward onto the side of the bed.

  

  It became her mission.

  

  She gave The Dream Carrier to Max as if the words alone could nourish him. On a Tuesday,
  she thought there was movement. She could have sworn his eyes had opened. If they had, it was
  only momentarily, and it was more likely just her imagination and wishful thinking.

  

  By mid-March, the cracks began to appear.

  

  Rosa Hubermannthe good woman for a crisiswas at breaking point one afternoon in the kitchen. She
  raised her voice, then brought it quickly down. Liesel stopped reading and made her way quietly
  to the hall. As close as she stood, she could still barely make out her mamas words. When she was
  able to hear them, she wished she hadnt, for what she heard was horrific. It was reality."|"The Book Thief"|"Markus Zusak"
"ap > 10:00"|"just after ten oclock"|"Liesel?

  

  I said everythings good.

  

  Shivering, she climbed from the mattress. Stupid with fear, she walked through the hallway to
  Max. After many minutes at his side, when everything slowed, she attempted to interpret the
  dream. Was it a premonition of Maxs death? Or was it merely a reaction to the afternoon
  conversation in the kitchen? Had Max now replaced her brother? And if so, how could she discard
  her own flesh and blood in such a way? Perhaps it was even a deep-seated wish for Max to die.
  After all, if it was good enough for Werner, her brother, it was good enough for this Jew.

  

  Is that what you think? she whispered, standing above the bed. No. She could not believe it. Her
  answer was sustained as the numbness of the dark waned and outlined the various shapes, big and
  small, on the bedside table. The presents.

  

  Wake up, she said.

  

  Max did not wake up.

  

  For eight more days.

  

  At school, there was a rapping of knuckles on the door.

  

  Come in, called Frau Olendrich.

  

  The door opened and the entire classroom of children looked on in surprise as Rosa Hubermann
  stood in the doorway. One or two gasped at the sighta small wardrobe of a woman with a lipstick
  sneer and chlorine eyes. This. Was the legend. She was wearing her best clothes, but her hair was
  a mess, and it was a towel of elastic gray strands.

  

  The teacher was obviously afraid. Frau Hubermann . . . Her movements were cluttered. She
  searched through the class. Liesel?

  

  Liesel looked at Rudy, stood, and walked quickly toward the door to end the embarrassment as fast
  as possible. It shut behind her, and now she was alone, in the corridor, with Rosa.

  

  Rosa faced the other way.

  

  What, Mama?

  

  She turned. Dont you what Mama me, you little Saumensch ! Liesel was gored by the speed of
  it. My hairbrush! A trickle of laughter rolled from under the door, but it was drawn instantly
  back.

  

  Mama?

  

  Her face was severe, but it was smiling. What the hell did you do with my hairbrush, you stupid
  Saumensch, you little thief ? Ive told you a hundred times to leave that thing alone, but do you
  listen? Of course not!

  

  The tirade went on for perhaps another minute, with Liesel making a desperate suggestion or two
  about the possible location of the said brush. It ended abruptly, with Rosa pulling Liesel close,
  just for a few seconds. Her whisper was almost impossible to hear, even at such close proximity.
  You told me to yell at you. You said theyd all believe it. She looked left and right, her voice
  like needle and thread. He woke up, Liesel. Hes awake. From her pocket, she pulled out the toy
  soldier with the scratched exterior. He said to give you this. It was his favorite. She handed it
  over, held her arms tightly, and smiled. Before Liesel had a chance to answer, she finished it
  off. Well? Answer me! Do you have any other idea where you might have left it?

  

  Hes alive, Liesel thought. . . . No, Mama. Im sorry, Mama, I

  

  Well, what good are you, then? She let go, nodded, and walked away.

  

  For a few moments, Liesel stood. The corridor was huge. She examined the soldier in her palm.
  Instinct told her to run home immediately, but common sense did not allow it. Instead, she placed
  the ragged soldier in her pocket and returned to the classroom.

  

  Everyone waited.

  

  Stupid cow, she whispered under her breath.

  

  Again, kids laughed. Frau Olendrich did not.

  

  What was that?

  

  Liesel was on such a high that she felt indestructible. I said, she beamed, stupid cow, and she
  didnt have to wait a single moment for the teachers hand to slap her.

  

  Dont speak about your mother like that, she said, but it had little effect. The girl merely stood
  there and attempted to hold off the grin. After all, she could take a Watschen with the
  best of them. Now get to your seat.

  

  Yes, Frau Olendrich.

  

  Next to her, Rudy dared to speak.

  

  Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, he whispered, I can see her hand on your face. A big red hand. Five
  fingers!

  

  Good, said Liesel, because Max was alive.

  

  When she made it home that afternoon, he was sitting up in bed with the deflated soccer ball on
  his lap. His beard itched him and his swampy eyes fought to stay open. An empty bowl of soup was
  next to the gifts.

  

  They did not say hello.

  

  It was more like edges.

  

  The door creaked, the girl came in, and she stood before him, looking at the bowl. Is Mama
  forcing it down your throat?

  

  He nodded, content, fatigued. It was very good, though.

  

  Mamas soup? Really?

  

  It was not a smile he gave her. Thank you for the presents. More just a slight tear of the mouth.
  Thank you for the cloud. Your papa explained that one a little further.

  

  After an hour, Liesel also made an attempt on the truth. We didnt know what wed do if youd died,
  Max. We

  

  It didnt take him long. You mean, how to get rid of me?

  

  Im sorry.

  

  No. He was not offended. You were right. He played weakly with the ball. You were right to think
  that way. In your situation, a dead Jew is just as dangerous as a live one, if not worse.

  

  I also dreamed. In detail, she explained it, with the soldier in her grip. She was on the verge
  of apologizing again when Max intervened.

  

  Liesel. He made her look at him. Dont ever apologize to me. It should be me who apologizes to
  you. He looked at everything shed brought him. Look at all this. These gifts. He held the button
  in his hand. And Rosa said you read to me twice every day, sometimes three times. Now he looked
  at the curtains as if he could see out of them. He sat up a little higher and paused for a dozen
  silent sentences. Trepidation found its way onto his face and he made a confession to the girl.
  Liesel? He moved slightly to the right. Im afraid, he said, of falling asleep again.

  

  Liesel was resolute. Then Ill read to you. And Ill slap your face if you start dozing off. Ill
  close the book and shake you till you wake up.

  

  That afternoon, and well into the night, Liesel read to Max Vandenburg. He sat in bed and
  absorbed the words, awake this time, until just after ten oclock. When Liesel took a quick rest
  from The Dream Carrier, she looked over the book and Max was asleep. Nervously, she
  nudged him with it. He awoke.

  

  Another three times, he fell asleep. Twice more, she woke him.

  

  For the next four days, he woke up every morning in Liesels bed, then next to the fireplace, and
  eventually, by mid-April, in the basement. His health had improved, the beard was gone, and small
  scraps of weight had returned.

  

  In Liesels inside world, there was great relief in that time. Outside, things were starting to
  look shaky. Late in March, a place called Lbeck was hailed with bombs. Next in line would be
  Cologne, and soon enough, many more German cities, including Munich.

  

  Yes, the boss was at my shoulder.

  

  Get it done, get it done.

  

  The bombs were comingand so was I."|"The Book Thief"|"Markus Zusak"
02:00|"two that night"|"From other shelters, there were stories of singing Deutschland ber Alles or of
  people arguing amid the staleness of their own breath. No such things happened in the Fiedler
  shelter. In that place, there was only fear and apprehension, and the dead song at Rosa
  Hubermanns cardboard lips.

  

  Not long before the sirens signaled the end, Alex Steinerthe man with the immovable, wooden
  facecoaxed the kids from his wifes legs. He was able to reach out and grapple for his sons free
  hand. Kurt, still stoic and full of stare, took it up and tightened his grip gently on the hand
  of his sister. Soon, everyone in the cellar was holding the hand of another, and the group of
  Germans stood in a lumpy circle. The cold hands melted into the warm ones, and in some cases, the
  feeling of another human pulse was transported. It came through the layers of pale, stiffened
  skin. Some of them closed their eyes, waiting for their final demise, or hoping for a sign that
  the raid was finally over.

  

  Did they deserve any better, these people?

  

  How many had actively persecuted others, high on the scent of Hitlers gaze, repeating his
  sentences, his paragraphs, his opus? Was Rosa Hubermann responsible? The hider of a Jew? Or Hans?
  Did they all deserve to die? The children?

  

  The answer to each of these questions interests me very much, though I cannot allow them to
  seduce me. I only know that all of those people would have sensed me that night, excluding the
  youngest of the children. I was the suggestion. I was the advice, my imagined feet walking into
  the kitchen and down the corridor.

  

  As is often the case with humans, when I read about them in the book thiefs words, I pitied them,
  though not as much as I felt for the ones I scooped up from various camps in that time. The
  Germans in basements were pitiable, surely, but at least they had a chance. That basement was not
  a washroom. They were not sent there for a shower. For those people, life was still
  achievable.

  

  In the uneven circle, the minutes soaked by.

  

  Liesel held Rudys hand, and her mamas.

  

  Only one thought saddened her.

  

  Max.

  

  How would Max survive if the bombs arrived on Himmel Street?

  

  Around her, she examined the Fiedlers basement. It was much sturdier and considerably deeper than
  the one at 33 Himmel Street.

  

  Silently, she asked her papa.

  

  Are you thinking about him, too?

  

  Whether the silent question registered or not, he gave the girl a quick nod. It was followed a
  few minutes later by the three sirens of temporary peace.

  

  The people at 45 Himmel Street sank with relief.

  

  Some clenched their eyes and opened them again.

  

  A cigarette was passed around.

  

  Just as it made its way to Rudy Steiners lips, it was snatched away by his father. Not you, Jesse
  Owens.

  

  The children hugged their parents, and it took many minutes for all of them to fully realize that
  they were alive, and that they were goingto be alive. Only then did their feet climb the
  stairs, to Herbert Fiedlers kitchen.

  

  Outside, a procession of people made its way silently along the street. Many of them looked up
  and thanked God for their lives.

  

  When the Hubermanns made it home, they headed directly to the basement, but it seemed that Max
  was not there. The lamp was small and orange and they could not see him or hear an answer.

  

  Max?

  

  Hes disappeared.

  

  Max, are you there?

  

  Im here.

  

  They originally thought the words had come from behind the drop sheets and paint cans, but Liesel
  was first to see him, in front of them. His jaded face was camouflaged among the painting
  materials and fabric. He was sitting there with stunned eyes and lips.

  

  When they walked across, he spoke again.

  

  I couldnt help it, he said.

  

  It was Rosa who replied. She crouched down to face him. What are you talking about, Max?

  

  I . . . He struggled to answer. When everything was quiet, I went up to the corridor and the
  curtain in the living room was open just a crack. . . . I could see outside. I watched, only for
  a few seconds. He had not seen the outside world for twenty-two months.

  

  There was no anger or reproach.

  

  It was Papa who spoke.

  

  How did it look?

  

  Max lifted his head, with great sorrow and great astonishment. There were stars, he said. They
  burned my eyes.

  

  Four of them.

  

  Two people on their feet. The other two remained seated.

  

  All had seen a thing or two that night.

  

  This place was the real basement. This was the real fear. Max gathered himself and stood to move
  back behind the sheets. He wished them good night, but he didnt make it beneath the stairs. With
  Mamas permission, Liesel stayed with him till morning, reading A Song in the Dark as he
  sketched and wrote in his book.

  

  From a Himmel Street window, he wrote, the stars set fire to my eyes."|"The Book Thief"|"Markus Zusak"
"ap 04:00"|"four oclock"|"Soon, Rosa was behind her. What do you want here? You want to spit on my kitchen floor
  now, too?

  

  Frau Holtzapfel was not deterred in the slightest. Is that how you greet everyone who
  shows up at your front door? What a Gsindel.

  

  Liesel watched. She was unfortunate enough to be sandwiched between them. Rosa pulled her out of
  the way. Well, are you going to tell me why youre here or not?

  

  Frau Holtzapfel looked once more at the street and back. I have an offer for you.

  

  Mama shifted her weight. Is that right?

  

  No, not you. She dismissed Rosa with a shrug of the voice and focused now on Liesel. You.

  

  Why did you ask for me, then?

  

  Well, I at least need your permission.

  

  Oh, Maria, Liesel thought, this is all I need. What the hell can Holtzapfel want with me?

  

  I liked that book you read in the shelter.

  

  No. Youre not getting it. Liesel was convinced of that. Yes?

  

  I was hoping to hear the rest of it in the shelter, but it looks like were safe for now. She
  rolled her shoulders and straightened the wire in her back. So I want you to come to my place and
  read it to me.

  

  Youve got some nerve, Holtzapfel. Rosa was deciding whether to be furious or not. If you
  think

  

  Ill stop spitting on your door, she interrupted. And Ill give you my coffee ration.

  

  Rosa decided against being furious. And some flour?

  

  What, are you a Jew? Just the coffee. You can swap the coffee with someone else for the
  flour.

  

  It was decided.

  

  By everyone but the girl.

  

  Good, then, its done.

  

  Mama?

  

  Quiet, Saumensch. Go and get the book. Mama faced Frau Holtzapfel again. What days suit
  you?

  

  Monday and Friday, four oclock. And today, right now.

  

  Liesel followed the regimented footsteps to Frau Holtzapfels lodging next door, which was a
  mirror image of the Hubermanns. If anything, it was slightly larger.

  

  When she sat down at the kitchen table, Frau Holtzapfel sat directly in front of her but faced
  the window. Read, she said.

  

  Chapter two?

  

  No, chapter eight. Of course chapter two! Now get reading before I throw you out.

  

  Yes, Frau Holtzapfel.

  

  Never mind the yes, Frau Holtzapfels. Just open the book. We dont have all day.

  

  Good God, Liesel thought. This is my punishment for all that stealing. Its finally caught up with
  me.

  

  She read for forty-five minutes, and when the chapter was finished, a bag of coffee was deposited
  on the table.

  

  Thank you, the woman said. Its a good story. She turned toward the stove and started on some
  potatoes. Without looking back, she said, Are you still here, are you?

  

  Liesel took that as her cue to leave. Danke schn, Frau Holtzapfel. By the door, when she
  saw the framed photos of two young men in military uniform, she also threw in a heil
  Hitler, her arm raised in the kitchen.

  

  Yes. Frau Holtzapfel was proud and afraid. Two sons in Russia. Heil Hitler. She put her
  water down to boil and even found the manners to walk the few steps with Liesel to the front
  door. Bis morgen?

  

  The next day was Friday. Yes, Frau Holtzapfel. Until tomorrow.

  

  Liesel calculated that there were four more reading sessions like that with Frau Holtzapfel
  before the Jews were marched through Molching.

  

  They were going to Dachau, to concentrate.

  

  That makes two weeks, she would later write in the basement. Two weeks to change
  the world, and fourteen days to ruin it."|"The Book Thief"|"Markus Zusak"
"> 23:00"|"just after 11 p.m."|"At just after 11 p.m. that same night, Max Vandenburg walked up Himmel Street with a suitcase
  full of food and warm clothes. German air was in his lungs. The yellow stars were on fire. When
  he made it to Frau Dillers, he looked back one last time to number thirty-three. He could not see
  the figure in the kitchen window, but she could see him. She waved and he did not wave
  back.

  

  Liesel could still feel his mouth on her forehead. She could smell his breath of goodbye.

  

  I have left something for you, hed said, but you will not get it until youre ready.

  

  He left.

  

  Max?

  

  But he did not come back.

  

  He had walked from her room and silently shut the door.

  

  The hallway murmured.

  

  He was gone.

  

  When she made it to the kitchen, Mama and Papa stood with crooked bodies and preserved faces.
  Theyd been standing like that for thirty seconds of forever."|"The Book Thief"|"Markus Zusak"
"ap 01:17"|"one seventeen"|"When the fourth game of dominoes was completed, Rudy began to stand them up in lines, creating
  patterns that wound their way across the living room floor. As was his habit, he also left a few
  gaps, in case the rogue finger of a sibling interfered, which it usually did.

  

  Can I knock them down, Rudy?

  

  No.

  

  What about me?

  

  No. We all will.

  

  He made three separate formations that led to the same tower of dominoes in the middle. Together,
  they would watch everything that was so carefully planned collapse, and they would all smile at
  the beauty of destruction.

  

  The kitchen voices were becoming louder now, each heaping itself upon the other to be heard.
  Different sentences fought for attention until one person, previously silent, came between
  them.

  

  No, she said. It was repeated. No. Even when the rest of them resumed their arguments, they were
  silenced again by the same voice, but now it gained momentum. Please, Barbara Steiner begged
  them. Not my boy.

  

  Can we light a candle, Rudy?

  

  It was something their father had often done with them. He would turn out the light and theyd
  watch the dominoes fall in the candlelight. It somehow made the event grander, a greater
  spectacle.

  

  His legs were aching anyway. Let me find a match.

  

  The light switch was at the door.

  

  Quietly, he walked toward it with the matchbox in one hand, the candle in the other.

  

  From the other side, the three men and one woman climbed to the hinges. The best scores in the
  class, said one of the monsters. Such depth and dryness. Not to mention his athletic ability.
  Damn it, why did he have to win all those races at the carnival?

  

  Deutscher.

  

  Damn that Franz Deutscher!

  

  But then he understood.

  

  This was not Franz Deutschers fault, but his own. Hed wanted to show his past tormentor what he
  was capable of, but he also wanted to prove himself to everyone. Now everyone was in the
  kitchen.

  

  He lit the candle and switched off the light.

  

  Ready?

  

  But Ive heard what happens there. That was the unmistakable, oaky voice of his father.

  

  Come on, Rudy, hurry up.

  

  Yes, but understand, Herr Steiner, this is all for a greater purpose. Think of the opportunities
  your son can have. This is really a privilege.

  

  Rudy, the candles dripping.

  

  He waved them away, waiting again for Alex Steiner. He came.

  

  Privileges? Like running barefoot through the snow? Like jumping from ten-meter platforms into
  three feet of water?

  

  Rudys ear was pressed to the door now. Candle wax melted onto his hand.

  

  Rumors. The arid voice, low and matter-of-fact, had an answer for everything. Our school is one
  of the finest ever established. Its better than world-class. Were creating an elite group of
  German citizens in the name of the Fhrer. . . .

  

  Rudy could listen no longer.

  

  He scraped the candle wax from his hand and drew back from the splice of light that came through
  the crack in the door. When he sat down, the flame went out. Too much movement. Darkness flowed
  in. The only light available was a white rectangular stencil, the shape of the kitchen
  door.

  

  He struck another match and reignited the candle. The sweet smell of fire and carbon.

  

  Rudy and his sisters each tapped a different domino and they watched them fall until the tower in
  the middle was brought to its knees. The girls cheered.

  

  Kurt, his older brother, arrived in the room.

  

  They look like dead bodies, he said.

  

  What?

  

  Rudy peered up at the dark face, but Kurt did not answer. Hed noticed the arguing from the
  kitchen. Whats going on in there?

  

  It was one of the girls who answered. The youngest, Bettina. She was five. There are two
  monsters, she said. Theyve come for Rudy.

  

  Again, the human child. So much cannier.

  

  Later, when the coat men left, the two boys, one seventeen, the other fourteen, found the courage
  to face the kitchen.

  

  They stood in the doorway. The light punished their eyes.

  

  It was Kurt who spoke. Are they taking him?

  

  Their mothers forearms were flat on the table. Her palms were facing up.

  

  Alex Steiner raised his head.

  

  It was heavy.

  

  His expression was sharp and definite, freshly cut.

  

  A wooden hand wiped at the splinters of his fringe, and he made several attempts to speak.

  

  Papa?

  

  But Rudy did not walk toward his father.

  

  He sat at the kitchen table and took hold of his mothers facing-up hand.

  

  Alex and Barbara Steiner would not disclose what was said while the dominoes were falling like
  dead bodies in the living room. If only Rudy had kept listening at the door, just for another few
  minutes . . .

  

  He told himself in the weeks to comeor in fact, pleaded with himselfthat if hed heard the rest of
  the conversation that night, hed have entered the kitchen much earlier. Ill go, hed have said.
  Please, take me, Im ready now.

  

  If hed intervened, it might have changed everything."|"The Book Thief"|"Markus Zusak"

"ap 09:00"|"nine oclock"|"Not counting the glass of champagne the previous summer, Hans Hubermann had not consumed a drop
  of alcohol for a decade. Then came the night before he left for training.

  

  He made his way to the Knoller with Alex Steiner in the afternoon and stayed well into the
  evening. Ignoring the warnings of their wives, both men drank themselves into oblivion. It didnt
  help that the Knollers owner, Dieter Westheimer, gave them free drinks.

  

  Apparently, while he was still sober, Hans was invited to the stage to play the accordion.
  Appropriately, he played the infamous Gloomy Sundaythe anthem of suicide from Hungaryand although
  he aroused all the sadness for which the song was renowned, he brought the house down. Liesel
  imagined the scene of it, and the sound. Mouths were full. Empty beer glasses were streaked with
  foam. The bellows sighed and the song was over. People clapped. Their beer-filled mouths cheered
  him back to the bar.

  

  When they managed to find their way home, Hans couldnt get his key to fit the door. So he
  knocked. Repeatedly.

  

  Rosa!

  

  It was the wrong door.

  

  Frau Holtzapfel was not thrilled.

  

  Schwein! Youre at the wrong house. She rammed the words through the keyhole. Next door,
  you stupid Sankerl.

  

  Thanks, Frau Holtzapfel.

  

  You know what you can do with your thanks, you asshole.

  

  Excuse me?

  

  Just go home.

  

  Thanks, Frau Holtzapfel.

  

  Didnt I just tell you what you can do with your thanks?

  

  Did you?

  

  (Its amazing what you can piece together from a basement conversation and a reading session in a
  nasty old womans kitchen.)

  

  Just get lost, will you!

  

  When at long last he came home, Papa made his way not to bed, but to Liesels room. He stood
  drunkenly in the doorway and watched her sleep. She awoke and thought immediately that it was
  Max.

  

  Is it you? she asked.

  

  No, he said. He knew exactly what she was thinking. Its Papa.

  

  He backed out of the room and she heard his footsteps making their way down to the
  basement.

  

  In the living room, Rosa was snoring with enthusiasm.

  

  Close to nine oclock the next morning, in the kitchen, Liesel was given an order by Rosa. Hand me
  that bucket there.

  

  She filled it with cold water and walked with it down to the basement. Liesel followed, in a vain
  attempt to stop her. Mama, you cant!

  

  Cant I? She faced her briefly on the steps. Did I miss something, Saumensch? Do you give
  the orders around here now?

  

  Both of them were completely still.

  

  No answer from the girl.

  

  I thought not.

  

  They continued on and found him on his back, among a bed of drop sheets. He felt he didnt deserve
  Maxs mattress.

  

  Now, lets seeRosa lifted the bucketif hes alive.

  

  Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!

  

  The watermark was oval-shaped, from halfway up his chest to his head. His hair was plastered to
  one side and even his eyelashes dripped. What was that for?

  

  You old drunk!

  

  Jesus . . .

  

  Steam was rising weirdly from his clothes. His hangover was visible. It heaved itself to his
  shoulders and sat there like a bag of wet cement.

  

  Rosa swapped the bucket from left hand to right. Its lucky youre going to the war, she said. She
  held her finger in the air and wasnt afraid to wave it. Otherwise Id kill you myself, you know
  that, dont you?

  

  Papa wiped a stream of water from his throat. Did you have to do that?

  

  Yes. I did. She started up the steps. If youre not up there in five minutes, you get another
  bucketful.

  

  Left in the basement with Papa, Liesel busied herself by mopping up the excess water with some
  drop sheets.

  

  Papa spoke. With his wet hand, he made the girl stop. He held her forearm. Liesel? His face clung
  to her. Do you think hes alive?

  

  Liesel sat.

  

  She crossed her legs.

  

  The wet drop sheet soaked onto her knee.

  

  I hope so, Papa.

  

  It felt like such a stupid thing to say, so obvious, but there seemed little alternative.

  

  To say at least something of value, and to distract them from thoughts of Max, she made herself
  crouch and placed a finger in a small pool of water on the floor. Guten Morgen,
  Papa.

  

  In response, Hans winked at her.

  

  But it was not the usual wink. It was heavier, clumsier. The post-Max version, the hangover
  version. He sat up and told her about the accordion of the previous night, and Frau

  Her papa was still away.

  

  Shed completed three more reading sessions with a devastated woman. On many nights, shed watched
  Rosa sit with the accordion and pray with her chin on top of the bellows.

  

  Now, she thought, its time. Usually it was stealing that cheered her up, but on this day, it was
  giving something back.

  

  She reached under her bed and removed the plate. As quickly as she could, she cleaned it in the
  kitchen and made her way out. It felt nice to be walking up through Molching. The air was sharp
  and flat, like the Watschen of a sadistic teacher or nun. Her shoes were the only sound on
  Munich Street.

  

  As she crossed the river, a rumor of sunshine stood behind the clouds.

  

  At 8 Grande Strasse, she walked up the steps, left the plate by the front door, and knocked, and
  by the time the door was opened, the girl was around the corner. Liesel did not look back, but
  she knew that if she did, shed have found her brother at the bottom of the steps again, his knee
  completely healed. She could even hear his voice.

  

  Thats better, Liesel.

  

  It was with great sadness that she realized that her brother would be six forever, but when she
  held that thought, she also made an effort to smile.

  

  She remained at the Amper River, at the bridge, where Papa used to stand and lean.

  

  She smiled and smiled, and when it all came out, she walked home and her brother never climbed
  into her sleep again. In many ways, she would miss him, but she could never miss his deadly eyes
  on the floor of the train or the sound of a cough that killed.

  

  The book thief lay in bed that night, and the boy only came before she closed her eyes. He was
  one member of a cast, for Liesel was always visited in that room. Her papa stood and called her
  half a woman. Max was writing The Word Shaker in the corner. Rudy was naked by the door.
  Occasionally her mother stood on a bedside train platform. And far away, in the room that
  stretched like a bridge to a nameless town, her brother, Werner, played in the cemetery
  snow.

  finish on a positive note for the book thief.

  

  At the beginning of April, Hans Hubermanns plaster was trimmed to the knee and he boarded a train
  for Munich. He would be given a week of rest and recreation at home before joining the ranks of
  army pen pushers in the city. He would help with the paperwork on the cleanup of Munichs
  factories, houses, churches, and hospitals. Time would tell if he would be sent out to do the
  repair work. That all depended on his leg and the state of the city.

  

  It was dark when he arrived home. It was a day later than expected, as the train was delayed due
  to an air-raid scare. He stood at the door of 33 Himmel Street and made a fist.

  

  Four years earlier, Liesel Meminger was coaxed through that doorway when she showed up for the
  first time. Max Vandenburg had stood there with a key biting into his hand. Now it was Hans
  Hubermanns turn. He knocked four times and the book thief answered.

  

  Papa, Papa.

  

  She must have said it a hundred times as she hugged him in the kitchen and wouldnt let go.

  

  Later, after they ate, they sat at the kitchen table long into the night and Hans told his wife
  and Liesel Meminger everything. He explained the LSE and the smoke-filled streets and the poor,
  lost, wandering souls. And Reinhold Zucker. Poor, stupid Reinhold Zucker. It took hours.

  

  At 1 a.m., Liesel went to bed and Papa came in to sit with her, like he used to. She woke up
  several times to check that he was there, and he did not fail her.

  

  The night was calm.

  

  Her bed was warm and soft with contentment.

  return, she stood and studied the moving pile of mournful Jewslooking for Max. If nothing else,
  it alleviated the pain of simply watching.

  

  Thats a horrible thought, she would write in her Himmel Street basement, but she knew it
  to be true. The pain of watching them. What about their pain? The pain of stumbling shoes
  and torment and the closing gates of the camp?

  

  They came through twice in ten days, and soon after, the anonymous, prune-faced woman on Munich
  Street was proven absolutely correct. Suffering had most definitely come, and if they could blame
  the Jews as a warning or prologue, they should have blamed the Fhrer and his quest for
  Russia as the actual causefor when Himmel Street woke later in July, a returned soldier was
  discovered to be dead. He was hanging from one of the rafters in a laundry up near Frau Dillers.
  Another human pendulum. Another clock, stopped.

  were firm, and Michael Holtzapfel jumped from the
  chair as if it were a cliff.

  

  So many people chased after me in that time, calling my name, asking me to take them with me.
  Then there was the small percentage who called me casually over and whispered with their
  tightened voices.

  

  Have me, they said, and there was no stopping them. They were frightened, no question, but they
  were not afraid of me. It was a fear of messing up and having to face themselves again, and
  facing the world, and the likes of you.

  

  There was nothing I could do.

  

  They had too many ways, they were too resourcefuland when they did it too well, whatever their
  chosen method, I was in no position to refuse.

  

  Michael Holtzapfel knew what he was doing.

  

  He killed himself for wanting to live.

  

  Of course, I did not see Liesel Meminger at all that day. As is usually the case, I advised
  myself that I was far too busy to remain on Himmel Street to listen to the screams. Its bad
  enough when people catch me red-handed, so I made the usual decision to make my exit, into the
  breakfast-colored sun.

  

  I did not hear the detonation of an old mans voice when he found the hanging body, nor the sound
  of running feet and jaw-dropped gasps when other people arrived. I did not hear a skinny man with
  a mustache mutter, Crying shame, a damn shame . . .

  

  I did not see Frau Holtzapfel laid out flat on Himmel Street, her arms out wide, her screaming
  face in total despair. No, I didnt discover any of that until I came back a few months later and
  read something called The Book Thief. It was explained to me that in the end, Michael
  Holtzapfel was worn down not by his damaged hand or any other injury, but by the guilt of
  living.

  

  In the lead-up to his death, the girl had realized that he wasnt sleeping, that each night was
  like poison. I often imagine him lying awake, sweating in sheets of snow, or seeing visions of
  his brothers severed legs. Liesel wrote that sometimes she almost told him about her own brother,
  like she did with Max, but there seemed a big difference between a long-distance cough and two
  obliterated legs. How do you console a man who has seen such things? Could you tell him the
  Fhrer was proud of him, that the Fhrer loved him for what he did in Stalingrad? How
  could you even dare? You can only let him do the talking. The dilemma, of course, is that such
  people save their most important words for after, when the surrounding humans are unlucky enough
  to find them. A note, a sentence, even a question, or a letter, like on Himmel Street in July
  1943.

  

  MICHAEL HOLTZAPFEL THE LAST GOODBYE Dear Mama,
  Can you ever forgive me? I just couldnt stand it any longer.
  Im meeting Robert. I dont care what the damn Catholics say about
  it. There must be a place in heaven for those who have been
  where I have been. You might think I dont love you because of
  what Ive done, but I do. Your Michael

  

  It was Hans Hubermann who was asked to give Frau Holtzapfel the news. He stood on her threshold
  and she must have seen it on his face. Two sons in six months.

  

  The morning sky stood blazing behind him as the wiry woman made her way past. She ran sobbing to
  the gathering farther up on Himmel Street. She said the name Michael at least two dozen times,
  but Michael had already answered. According to the book thief, Frau Holtzapfel hugged the body
  for nearly an hour. She then returned to the blinding sun of Himmel Street and sat herself down.
  She could no longer walk.

  

  From a distance, people observed. Such a thing was easier from far away.

  

  Hans Hubermann sat with her.

  

  He placed his hand on hers, as she fell back to the hard ground.

  

  He allowed her screams to fill the street.

  

  Much later, Hans walked with her, with painstaking care, through her front gate, and into the
  house. And no matter how many times I try to see it differently, I cant pull it off. . . .

  

  When I imagine that scene of the distraught woman and the tall silver-eyed man, it is still
  snowing in the kitchen of 31 Himmel Street."|"The Book Thief"|"Markus Zusak"
