"ap 01:00"|one|"Hawkmoon was attacked by some six swearing axemen who tried to press in against him and stop him from wielding his deadly sword, but the young Duke of Koln kicked out at one, elbowed another aside, and brought his blade straight down into the mask-helmet of another, splitting both helm and skull so that brains oozed through the fissure when he'd tugged his sword free. The sword became rapidly blunted with so much work, until at last heÂ was using it more as an axe than anything else. He wrenched a fresh sword from the hand of one of his attackers but kept his own. With the new sword he thrust, with the old he hacked."|"The Mad God's Amulet"|"Michael Moorcock"
