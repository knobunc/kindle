"ap > 05:00"|"After five"|"After five or more minutes of marinating in repeated tests, I let the air back in. The bubbles mostly disappeared, because the air pressure now exceeded the pressure inside the bubbles, and the meat pieces promptly sank."|"What Einstein Told His Cook 2"|"Robert L. Wolke"
08:00|"8.6 hours"|"In Paula’s examples, if the fast method roasts for 3 hours (hf = 3) at a temperature Tf =375, the energy break-even point hs for slow roasting at temperature Ts = 180 comes out to be 8.6 hours, and the energy break-even point for slow roasting at temperature Ts = 250 comes out to be 5.1 hours."|"What Einstein Told His Cook 2"|"Robert L.
