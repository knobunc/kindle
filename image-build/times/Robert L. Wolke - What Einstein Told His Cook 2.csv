"ap > 05:00"|"After five"|"After five or more minutes of marinating in repeated tests, I let the air back in. The bubbles mostly disappeared, because the air pressure now exceeded the pressure inside the bubbles, and the meat pieces promptly sank."|"What Einstein Told His Cook 2"|"Robert L. Wolke"
"ap ~ 01:50"|"about 150"|"Barbecuing, on the other hand, consists of long (several hours), slow, relatively low-temperature cooking—300 to 350ºF (about 150 to 180ºC) or even lower—with the food confined in a pit or some sort of enclosure along with a (generally) smoky fire. Think of beef or pork ribs, pork shoulder, or brisket being slathered with top-secret sauces by men wearing cowboy hats. I’ll stick to grilling here."|"What Einstein Told His Cook 2"|"Robert L. Wolke"
"ap 01:25"|125|"Note that we are talking here about so-called hot smoking. At 125 to 220°F (52 to 104ºC), the foods are not only infused with smoke flavor but also cooked to some extent. Commercial smokehouses also employ so-called cold smoking (see chapter 8), where the temperature of the food, such as bacon, is not allowed to exceed about 90 to 100°F (32 to 38°C). Liquid smoke (see chapter 8) is also often used."|"What Einstein Told His Cook 2"|"Robert L. Wolke"
