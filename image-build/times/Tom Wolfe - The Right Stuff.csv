Every evening at bases all over America, there were military pilots huddled in officers clubs eagerly cutting the right stuff up in coded slices so they could talk about it. What more compelling topic of conversation was there in the world? In the Air Force there were even pilots who would ask the tower for priority landing clearance so that they could make the beer call on time, at 4 p.m. sharp, at the Officers Club. They would come right out and state the reason. The drunken rambles began at four and sometimes went on for ten or twelve hours. Such conversations! They diced that righteous stuff up into little bits, bowed ironically to it, stumbled blindfolded around it, groped, lurched, belched, staggered, bawled, sang, roared, and feinted at it with self-deprecating humor.

Why not get the cars and go out for a little proficiency run? It seemed that every fighter jock thought himself an ace driver, and he would do anything to obtain a hot car, especially a sports car, and the drunker he was, the more convinced he would be about his driving skills, as if the right stuff, being indivisible, carried over into any enterprise whatsoever, under any conditions. A little proficiency run, boys! (There’s only one way to find out!) And they would roar off in close formation from, say, Nellis Air Force Base, down Route 15, into Las Vegas, barreling down the highway, rat-racing, sometimes four abreast, jockeying for position, piling into the most listless curve in the desert flats as if they were trying to root each other out of the groove at the Rebel 500—and then bursting into downtown Las Vegas with a rude fraternal roar like the Hell’s Angels—and the natives chalked it up to youth and drink and the bad element that the Air Force attracted.

he and Glennis saddled up a couple of Pancho’s dude-ranch horses and went for a romp, a little rat race, in the moonlight. This was in keeping with the military tradition of Flying & Drinking and Drinking & Driving, except that this was prehistoric Muroc and you rode horses. So Yeager and his wife set off on a little proficiency run at full gallop through the desert in the moonlight amid the arthritic silhouettes of the Joshua trees. Then they start racing back to the corral, with Yeager in the lead and heading for the gateway. Given the prevailing conditions, it being nighttime, at Pancho’s, and his head being filled with a black sandstorm of many badly bawled songs and vulcanized oaths, he sees too late that the gate has been closed. Like many a hard-driving midnight pilot before him, he does not realize that he is not equally gifted in the control of all forms of locomotion. He and the horse hit the gate, and he goes flying off and lands on his right side. His side hurts like hell."|"The Right Stuff"|"Tom Wolfe"

The sky turned a deep purple and all at once the stars and the moon came out—and the sun shone at the same time. He had reached a layer of the upper atmosphere where the air was too thin to contain reflecting dust particles. He was simply looking out into space. As the X–I nosed over at the top of the climb, Yeager now had seven minutes of … Pilot Heaven … ahead of him. He was going faster than any man in history, and it was almost silent up here, since he had exhausted his rocket fuel, and he was so high in such a vast space that there was no sensation of motion. He was master of the sky. His was a king’s solitude, unique and inviolate, above the dome of the world. It would take him seven minutes to glide back down and land at Muroc. He spent the time doing victory rolls and wing-over-wing aerobatics while Rogers Lake and the High Sierras spun around below."|"The Right Stuff"|"Tom Wolfe"

from 35,000 feet somewhere up there in the blue over the desert and know that some True Brother had commenced his rocket launch … in the X–I, the X–IA, the X–2, the D–558-1, the horrible XF–92A, the beautiful D–558-2 … and to know that he would soon be at an altitude, in the thin air at the edge of space, where the stars and the moon came out at noon, in an atmosphere so thin that the ordinary laws of aerodynamics no longer applied and a plane could skid into a flat spin like a cereal bowl on a waxed Formica counter and then start tumbling, not spinning and not diving, but tumbling, end over end like a brick … In those planes, which were like chimneys with little razor-blade wings on them, you had to be “afraid to panic,” and that phrase was no joke. In the skids, the tumbles, the spins, there was, truly, as Saint-Exupéry had said, only one thing you could let yourself think about: What do I do next? Sometimes at Edwards they used to play the tapes of pilots going into the final dive, the one that killed them, and the man would be tumbling, going end over end in a fifteen-ton length of pipe, with all aerodynamics long gone, and not one prayer left, and he knew it, and he would be screaming into the microphone, but not for Mother or for God or the nameless spirit of Ahor, but for one last hopeless crumb of information about the loop: “I’ve tried A! I’ve tried B! I’ve tried C! I’ve tried D! Tell me what else I can try!” And then that truly spooky click on the machine. What do I do next? (In this moment when the Halusian Gulp is opening?) And everybody around the table would look at one another and nod ever so slightly, and the unspoken message was: Too bad! There was a man with the right stuff. There was no national mourning in such cases, of course. Nobody outside of Edwards knew the man’s name. If he were well liked, he might get one of those dusty stretches of road named for him on the base. He was probably a junior officer doing all this for four or five thousand a year. He owned perhaps two suits, only one of which he dared wear around people he didn’t know. But none of that mattered!—not at Edwards—not in the Brotherhood."|"The Right Stuff"|"Tom Wolfe"

They were young, lovely, juicy, frisky—and there were so many of them, at all hours, every day of the week! And they were not prostitutes, despite the accusations made later. They were just … well, just young juicy girls in their twenties with terrific young conformations and sweet cupcakes and loamy loins. They were sometimes described with a broad sweep as “stewardesses,” but only a fraction of them really were. No, they were lovely young things who arrived as mysteriously as the sea gulls who sought the squirming shrimp. They were moist labial piping little birds who had somehow learned that at this strange place in the high Mojave lived the hottest young pilots in the world and that this was where things were happening. They came skipping and screaming in through the banging screen doors at Pancho’s—and it completed the picture of Pilot Heaven. There was no other way to say it.

After the examination, like everyone who has ever been through the procedure, Conrad now feels as if there are eighty-five pounds of barium in his intestines and they are about to explode. The Smocks inform him that there is no john on this floor. He’s supposed to pick up the tube that is coming out of his rectum and follow an orderly, who will lead him to a john two floors below.

Conrad is intensely aware of that fact, because he is now hunched over so far that his eyes hit the orderly at about calf level. He’s hunched over, with his tail in the breeze, scuttling like a crab after a pair of red cowboy boots. Out into a corridor they go, an ordinary public corridor, the full-moon hunchback and the red cowboy boots, amid men, women, children, nurses, nuns, the lot.

"ap 03:23"|"three hours and twenty-three minutes"|"Other men would no doubt go farther into space, into earth orbit and beyond. But they, in turn, would be chosen from the first men to fly suborbitally; so the first astronaut would be the one the world remembered. When a man realized something like that, there was no use being shy about the opportunity he had. Glenn had not gotten this far in his career by standing still in a saintly fashion and waiting for his halo to be noticed. When he reached Korea, flying strafing and bombing missions in support of Marine ground troops, he realized that the biggest accolade was being assigned to Air Force fighter squadrons, on loan (like Schirra), for air-to-air combat up at the Yalu River. So he had gone after that assignment and had gotten it and had shot down three MiGs during the last few days of the war. As soon as the war ended, he realized that flight test was the hot new arena and had gone straight to his superiors and asked to be assigned to the Navy’s Patuxent River Test Pilot School, and they sent him there. He had been in flight test barely three years when he dreamed up the F8U transcontinental run. He dreamed it up himself, as a major in the Marines! Although everyone knew it was possible, no one had ever made a sustained coast-to-coast flight at an average speed of greater than Mach 1. Glenn developed the whole scheme, the aerial rendezvous with three different AJ1 refueling tankers, the way he would dive down to 22,000 feet to meet them, the whole thing. He pulled it off on July 16, 1957, flying from Los Angeles to Floyd Bennett Field in New York, in three hours and twenty-three minutes. The word was that there were some test pilots who
were put out because he got the assignment. They seemed to think they had done the major test work on the F8U, and so forth and so on. But it was his idea! He got it launched! If he hadn’t put himself forward, it wouldn’t have happened at all. Last year, 1958, it was obvious to him that all the services were working on the problems of manned space flight. There was no Project Mercury yet, and no one knew who would be running the show when a manned program began. All he knew was that it was not likely to be the Marines but he wanted to play a part in it. So he had himself assigned to the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics. He volunteered for runs on the Navy’s human centrifuge machine at Johnsville, Pennsylvania, exploring the high g-forces associated with rocket flight. By March of this year, 1959, just a month before the seven of them were selected as astronauts, he had been at the McDonnell Aircraft plant in St. Louis as a representative of the Bureau of Aeronautics on a NASA Mockup Review Board, reviewing progress of the manufacture of the Mercury capsule. He didn’t know just how the seven of them were selected … but obviously all that hadn’t hurt his chances."|"The Right Stuff"|"Tom Wolfe"
20:00|1960|"At that, Walker’s place looked like a little bit of heaven compared to Bob White’s. But then, on the surface, Walker and White were different in every respect. White, who was a major, was the Air Force’s prime pilot for the X–15 project. He was the eternally correct and reserved Air Force blue-suiter. He didn’t drink. He exercised like a college athlete in training. He was religious. He was an usher in the Roman Catholic chapel of the base and never, but never, missed Mass. He was slender, black-haired, handsome, intelligent—even cultivated, if the truth were known. And he was terribly serious. He was not a beer-call fighter jock. Not many people picked out Bob White to just shoot the breeze with. White and his family lived on the base itself at 116 Thirteenth Street in a miserable grid of military housing plots known as the Wherry housing section. Or it had been known as Wherry at the outset. By 1960 it was usually referred to as Weary housing. Children grew up there thinking that Weary housing was the real name. Parked out front of White’s place was an unpainted Model A Ford. The Air Force, being the newest branch of the service, was strong on instant tradition. This old junker, the Ford, was bestowed, as an ironic sculpture of the Right Stuff, upon whomever was the number-one Air Force test pilot at Edwards. Scott Crossfield, the prime pilot for the manufacturer, North American, had completed the first phase of testing the X–15, checking out the power system and basic aerodynamics. White and Walker had been chosen to
push the rocket plane to its outer limits, which were envisioned as speeds in excess of Mach 6, or about 4,000 miles per hour, and, more important, an altitude of 280,000 feet. Just where “space” began was a matter of definition that had never been fully resolved. But fifty miles up was generally accepted as the boundary line. There was very little atmosphere left at that altitude; in fact, once a ship reached 100,000 feet, there was not enough air remaining to provide aerodynamics. The X–15’s target of 280,000 feet was 53 miles up."|"The Right Stuff"|"Tom Wolfe"
"ap 03:19"|3.19|"On May 7 Walker had cut loose the X–15 on its first real speed run with the Little Engine and reached Mach 3.19 or 2,111 miles an hour, just a shade faster than Mel Apt’s world record of 2,094 miles an hour in the X–2. On May 19 Bob White took the X–15 on its first bid for maximum altitude with the Little Engine and reached 109,000 feet, which was 17,000 feet under Iven Kincheloe’s record in the X–2. And that was another point that everybody should have known about … and didn’t. Kinch and Mel were now dead. Mel Apt died just a few minutes after he set his world speed record, the victim of a demon that was waiting especially for rocket ships reaching speeds of Mach 2 or more in the thin air up around 70,000 feet: instability in the yaw or roll axis … followed by an uncontrollable tumble. Sometimes it took the form of “inertia coupling,” which usually occurred when a pilot tried to bank a rocket ship and it snapped into a full roll and then began pitching and yawing—and rolling violently. This would throw it end over end. Some pilots felt that the formal term “inertia coupling” added damned little to your understanding of the phenomenon. The ship simply “uncorked” (as Crossfield liked to put it) and lost all semblance of aerodynamics and fell out of the sky like a bottle or a length of pipe. There was no way to maneuver out of a rocket-plane tumble. The pilot took a furious beating from the g-forces and from being thrown about the cockpit. The more he experimented with the controls, the worse fix he was in. Yeager had been the first rocket pilot to go through this particular hole in the supersonic envelope, and it was during the flight in the X–IA in which he set a speed record of Mach 2.42. He was battered unconscious and fell seven miles before hitting the denser atmosphere at 25,000 feet and coming to and managing to put the ship into a spin. That was good; a mere spin he knew how to get out of, and he survived. Kinch went into a tumble during
his record flight and came out of it at low altitude, as Yeager had done. That was just twenty days before Mel Apt augered in. Mel went into the wild tumble and tried to eject, but wasn’t able to complete the sequence in the X–2. Yeager had always figured it was useless to try to punch out of a rocket plane. Crossfield called it “committing suicide to keep from getting killed.” Inertia coupling nearly killed Kit Murray in 1954, when he set an altitude record of 94,000 feet in the X–IA, and it had hit Joe Walker twice, once in the XF–102 and again in the X–3."|"The Right Stuff"|"Tom Wolfe"

Mel Apt died just a few minutes after he set his world speed record, the victim of a demon that was waiting especially for rocket ships reaching speeds of Mach 2 or more in the thin air up around 70,000 feet: instability in the yaw or roll axis … followed by an uncontrollable tumble. Sometimes it took the form of “inertia coupling,” which usually occurred when a pilot tried to bank a rocket ship and it snapped into a full roll and then began pitching and yawing—and rolling violently. This would throw it end over end. Some pilots felt that the formal term “inertia coupling” added damned little to your understanding of the phenomenon. The ship simply “uncorked” (as Crossfield liked to put it) and lost all semblance of aerodynamics and fell out of the sky like a bottle or a length of pipe. There was no way to maneuver out of a rocket-plane tumble. The pilot took a furious beating from the g-forces and from being thrown about the cockpit. The more he experimented with the controls, the worse fix he was in. Yeager had been the first rocket pilot to go through this particular hole in the supersonic envelope, and it was during the flight in the X–IA in which he set a speed record of Mach 2.42. He was battered unconscious and fell seven miles before hitting the denser atmosphere at 25,000 feet and coming to and managing to put the ship into a spin. That was good; a mere spin he knew how to get out of, and he survived. Kinch went into a tumble during
his record flight and came out of it at low altitude, as Yeager had done. That was just twenty days before Mel Apt augered in. Mel went into the wild tumble and tried to eject, but wasn’t able to complete the sequence in the X–2. Yeager had always figured it was useless to try to punch out of a rocket plane. Crossfield called it “committing suicide to keep from getting killed.” Inertia coupling nearly killed Kit Murray in 1954, when he set an altitude record of 94,000 feet in the X–IA, and it had hit Joe Walker twice, once in the XF–102 and again in the X–3."|"The Right Stuff"|"Tom Wolfe"
"ap 03:31"|3.31|"Joe Walker was feeling good. In August he had pushed the X–15 just about as fast as the Little Engine could take it, to a new world speed record of Mach 3.31, or 2,196 miles per hour. After he landed it on Rogers Lake, he cut loose with a cowboy yell that startled everyone on the radio circuit: “Yippeeeee!” That was Joe Walker. A week later Bob White went up in the X–15 and set a new altitude record of 136,500 feet, or slightly more than twenty-five miles. It had been a perfect flight. It was as much as you could expect from the Little Engine. The conditions had been almost precisely the conditions of space flight. He took the ship up in a ballistic arc, the same sort of arc the Mercury-Redstone vehicle was supposed to go on … someday … He experienced five g’s during the rocket thrust on the way up. An astronaut in Mercury was supposed to experience six. He was weightless for two minutes as he came up over the top of the arc. An astronaut was supposed to be weightless for five minutes. At 136,500 feet the air was so thin, White had no aerodynamic control at all. It was absolutely silent up there. He could see for hundreds of miles, from Los Angeles to San Francisco."|"The Right Stuff"|"Tom Wolfe"
"< 12:00"|"shortly before noon"|"When they fired the rocket, shortly before noon, it climbed at a slightly higher angle than it was supposed to, driving Number 61 back into his couch with a force of seventeen g’s, i.e., seventeen times his own weight, five g’s more than anticipated. His heart rate shot up as he strained against the force, but he didn’t panic for a moment. He had been through this same sensation many times on the centrifuge. As long as he just took it and didn’t struggle, they wouldn’t zap all those goddamned blue bolts into the soles of his feet. There were a lot worse things in this world than g-forces … He was weightless now, hurtling toward Bermuda, and they flashed the lights in his cubicle, and the ape’s pulse returned to normal,
to no more than what it was on the ground. The usual shit was flowing. The main thing was to keep ahead of those blue bolts in the feet! … He started pushing the buttons and throwing the switches like the greatest electric Wurlitzer organist who ever lived, never missed a signal … Then the Mercury retro-rockets were fired, automatically, and the capsule came down through the atmosphere at the same angle at which it had gone up. Another 14.6 g’s hit Number 61 on the way down, making him feel as if his eyeballs were coming out of his head. He had been through so-called eyeballs-out g’s, too, many times, on the centrifuge. It could get a lot worse. There were worse things than feeling as if his eyeballs were coming out … The goddamned zap plates on his feet, for a start … So far as mere space flight was concerned, Number 61 was fearless. The beast had been operantly conditioned, aerospatially desensitized."|"The Right Stuff"|"Tom Wolfe"
"< 09:30"|"nearly 9:30 a.m."|"Light the candle! he says. The words of Chuck Yeager himself! The voice of the rocket ace! Oddly enough, it seemed to do the trick. Realizing
the astronaut’s irritation, they began wrapping up the process and declaring their systems “go.” It was nearly 9:30 a.m. by the time the countdown entered its last minute. Shepard’s periscope began automatically retracting inside the capsule, and he remembered that he had put in the gray filter to cut out the sunlight. If he didn’t remove it, he wouldn’t be able to see any colors in flight. So he started moving his left hand toward the periscope, but his left forearm hit the abort handle. Shit! That was all he needed now! Fortunately, he had barely brushed it. The abort handle was the equivalent of the ejection seat cinch ring in an airplane. If the astronaut sensed some catastrophe that the automatic system had not picked up, he could turn the handle and the escape tower rocket would fire and pull the capsule free of the Redstone rocket and bring it down by parachute. That was all he needed—the world waits for the first American spaceman, and Shepard gives them an exhibition of a little man popping up a few thousand feet in a thimble and floating down by parachute … He could see it all in a flash … Another Popped Cork fiasco … The hell with changing the filter. He would look at the world in black and white. Who cared? Don’t fuck up. That was the main thing."|"The Right Stuff"|"Tom Wolfe"
09:45|"quarter of ten in the morning"|"What inna namea—the g-forces were building up too fast! This
wasn’t the way it happened on the centrifuge! The g-forces were coming up so fast, driving him back so deep into his seat, he knew he couldn’t complete the maneuvers he was supposed to make on the fly-by-wire system. Whether he did them or not on this flight would make no difference as far as his own safety was concerned. This was practice for orbital flights. In orbital flights the one thing the astronaut would be able to do would be to hold the capsule at the proper attitude, the proper angles, if the automatic system malfunctioned. Nevertheless—he was behind on the checklist! Falling behind put you on the threshold of fucking up … Soon he wouldn’t be able to control the capsule’s attitude with the manual controls or the fly-by-wire. The g-forces would be too severe for him to use his arms. So he switched back to automatic, forgetting to shut off one of the manual buttons when he did so … He was behind on the checklist! The simulation had crossed him up! He was supposed to have more time than this! He was in no danger whatsoever—but how could real life vary this much from the simulation! Looking for those motherless stars and color bands had thrown him off!—eaten up time! But even so, the buildup of the g-forces came smoothly. The capsule began to swing from side to side as it came through the denser and denser layers of atmosphere, but it was not nearly as rough a ride as the same interval in the centrifuge. He was lying on his back again. If he looked up, he looked straight toward the sky. He tensed his calves and the muscles of his abdomen to counteract the g-forces … just as he had a thousand times on the centrifuge … He forced his breath out in grunts as the g’s pressed down on his chest … He grunted out the g readings as they rose on the dial … “Uhhsix … uh seven … uhh eight … uhh nine …” Then he kept repeating, kept grunting out the word “Ohhkay … Ohhkay … Ohhkay … Ohhkay … Ohhkay … Ohhkay … Ohhkay” … to let the ground know that the g-forces were on top of him but that he was all right. He could see nothing except indigo out the portholes. He didn’t even bother looking. He kept staring at the instrument panel at the big lights that would show the parachutes were coming out. They would come out automatically. The first green light came on. The drogue chute, the parachute that pulled the main chute out, had deployed. Now Shepard could see it through the periscope. He could see the needle pass 20,000 on his altimeter. Why doesn’t it— At 10,000 feet the main chute came
out, as he could see through the periscope. Then it filled and the jolt slammed him back into his seat once more. A kick in the butt! For reassurance! He knew he had it made. The capsule swayed from side to side under the parachute, but there was nothing to it. He was lying on his back. The landing bag was right underneath his back. He started undoing his knee straps. Get out of all these goddamned straps, hoses, and wires. That was the main thing. He took his face seal hose and oxygen exhaust hoses off his helmet. Through the periscope he could see he was coming closer and closer to the water. It was sunny out there. He was near Bermuda. The ships were all nearby. He could hear them clearly on the radio. Then the blunt end of the capsule hit the water. It was right under his back. The impact drove him back into his seat yet again. It was just like they said it would be! It was about the same jolt you get when you land on the deck of an aircraft carrier. No more than that. The capsule keeled over to the right. The right-hand window was underwater. But he could look out the other one and see his yellow dye marker on the surface of the water. It was released automatically. It made a big yellow stain, so that the rescue helicopters could spot the capsule better. Shepard was busy trying to get himself out of the rest of the rig. Get free! He broke the neck ring seal off his helmet so that he could get the helmet off. He kept looking at the window that was underwater. The capsule was supposed to right itself. The goddamned window stayed underwater. Gurgling! He kept looking all around it for signs of water seeping in. He couldn’t see any but he could hear it. It had finally started seeping in on the ape’s flight. The goddamned capsule was not made for the water. What a way to blow the whole thing this would be. Bobbing around in the goddamned water in a bucket. The capsule slowly came up vertical. The helicopter was already overhead radioing for instructions. He had it made as long as he didn’t fuck it up getting out of the capsule. He opened the door at the top of the capsule, the neck, with a cable device and pulled himself up. A tremendous burst of sunlight hit him, sunlight on the open sea. It was barely quarter of ten in the morning. He was forty miles from Bermuda on a sunny day out in the Atlantic. The noise of the helicopter overhead obliterated every other sound. The crewmen were lowering a rescue sling, which looked like an old-fashioned horse collar, the kind they used to put on dray horses. It
was a big helicopter, an industrial type. It had already hooked onto the capsule and pulled it up out of the water. There were some Marine Corps crewmen inside the helicopter. The noise was overwhelming. They kept staring at him and smiling. It was that glistening look."|"The Right Stuff"|"Tom Wolfe"
"ap 05:27"|5.27|"One night just before the flight, when he was in the cocktail lounge evening out the strain a bit, who should Gus run into but Joe Walker. NASA had given Joe a few days off from Edwards to attend the launch, and so here he was. By this time, July 1961, Walker and Bob White had been flying up a storm in the X–15. In April, White had set a new speed record of Mach 4.62, which was just over 3,000 miles an hour, and in May Joe Walker had topped that by going Mach 4.95, and White had come right back in June and flown Mach 5.27. The X–15 now had the Big Engine, the XLR–99, with its 57,000 pounds of thrust. The True Brothers were ready to go all-out toward their goal of exceeding Mach 6 and an altitude of more than fifty miles … in piloted flight. Piloted! These developments could be found in the press … if one cared to look for them … but they were obscured by Gagarin’s flight, followed by Shepard’s flight … the single combat for the heavens. As a matter of fact, Joe Walker had taken the X–15 to Mach 4.95, the highest speed in the history of aviation, on the same day that Kennedy addressed Congress to propose the race for the moon … Next to the notion of a moon voyage Walker’s Mach 4.95 was pretty pedestrian stuff. But surely the truth would dawn on them eventually! It was with that in mind … the simple truth! … that Joe Walker happened to run into Gus Grissom at the Holiday Inn’s cocktail lounge."|"The Right Stuff"|"Tom Wolfe"
"ap ~ 01:50"|"around 150"|"Gus seemed like a pretty relaxed man all the way around. He would get a little irritated at the engineering sessions he sat in on during the last couple of weeks before the flight and would give them a few gusgruff growls if they seemed to want to tinker with this and that at the last minute, but that seemed to be sheer eagerness to get on with the flight. There was even a bit of the old boondock Edwards broomstick-and-baling wire spirit about the whole thing. Just two nights before the flight it dawned on one of the doctors that they had never made provisions for a urine receptacle for Gus, to avoid the sort of thing Shepard had experienced. That was a hell of a note. They figured they could make do with an ordinary rubber condom for the receptacle. But what would hold it in place and keep it from coming off? Dee O’Hara, the nurse, helped out. She drove into Cocoa Beach and bought a panty girdle, and they rigged that up with the condom. The goddamned girdle gave you a hell of a tight grip on the groin, but Gus figured he could get by with it. All in all, he seemed pretty loose, a test pilot of the old school. He even had a foretaste of the mental atmosphere of the real thing, just as Shepard had. On July 19 he was inserted into the capsule, and the hatch was
sealed, when the flight was canceled because of bad weather. The flight finally took place on July 21. Judging by his pulse rate and respiration, which were transmitted via his body sensors, Gus was more nervous than Shepard during the countdown. These rates, taken by themselves, didn’t mean a great deal, however, and no one would have thought twice about it except for what happened at the end of the flight. The flight itself was very nearly a duplicate of Shepard’s, except that Grissom’s capsule had a window, not just a periscope, giving him a much better view of the world, and he had a more sophisticated hand controller. His pulse stayed up around 150 throughout the five minutes he was weightless—Shepard’s pulse had never reached 140, not even during liftoff—and went up to 171 during the firing of the retro-rockets before the re-entry through the earth’s atmosphere. The informal consensus among the program’s doctors was that if an astronaut’s pulse rate went above 180, the mission should be aborted. The capsule splashed down almost precisely on target, just as Shepard’s had, within three miles of the recovery ship, the carrier Randolph. The capsule hit the water, then keeled over on one side, just as Shepard’s had, and took its own sweet time righting itself. Grissom thought he heard a gurgling noise inside the capsule—as had Shepard—and began looking for water seeping in, but didn’t see any. The recovery helicopter, designated Hunt Club I, was over the capsule within less than two minutes. Grissom was still in the seat, resting on his back, as he had been at the outset of the flight, and the capsule was bobbing around in the water."|"The Right Stuff"|"Tom Wolfe"
"ap 05:21"|5.21|"This time, out at Edwards, the True Brothers didn’t even derive a chilly smile from the fact that once more in the exalted Project Mercury an ape would be taking the first flight. An ape would make the first orbit of the earth for the U.S.A. The prestige of Project Mercury had by now rendered such considerations meaningless. On October 11, at Edwards, Bob White had made an extraordinary flight in the X–15—and the country hardly noticed. White took the X–15 up to 217,000 feet with the Big Engine—and the press merely nodded perfunctorily. So a man had just flown very high in an airplane; how interesting; and that was that. The fact that White was on top of a rocket, the same sort of rocket as the Redstone or the Atlas, the fact that his flight to 217,000 feet was in effect piloted space flight—none of this was likely to impress Kennedy or the public amid the panic over Titov and the space gap. White had gone forty miles up, ten miles short of the arbitarily set boundary of “space.” The XLR—99, the Big Engine, had delivered 57,000 pounds of thrust, just 21,000 short of the thrust of the Redstones that took Shepard and Grissom aloft. White’s speed reached Mach 5.21, or 3,647 miles an hour; Shepard’s and Grissom’s rocket velocities were only slightly greater, about 5,180 miles per hour. White was weightless for three minutes during his tremendous arc over the top, as compared to Shepard’s and Grissom’s five minutes. White saw all the things that Shepard and Grissom saw (and Shepard, only barely) … including the entire blue band of atmosphere at the horizon of the earth. Above all, White was a pilot. He controlled his plane’s ascent. He used hydrogen-peroxide thrusters to control his attitude once the air became too thin for aileron control—the same system of hydrogen-peroxide thrusters that Shepard and Grissom had used—and he did it all without benefit of any automatic
backup. And he brought the ship back down through the earth’s atmosphere himself … and landed it himself on the holy plateau of Edwards … on the dome of the world. A rocket pilot (quoth the brethren), but the national press barely noticed."|"The Right Stuff"|"Tom Wolfe"

The curtains were pulled, somewhat unaccountably, inasmuch as it was nine o’clock in the morning, but it all looked very cozy. In point of fact, the lawn, or what was left of it, looked like Nut City. There were three or four mobile units from the television networks with cables running through the grass. It looked as if Arlington had been invaded by giant toasters. The television people, with all their gaffers and go-fers and groupies and cameramen and couriers and technicians and electricians, were blazing with 200-watt eyeballs and ricocheting off each other and the assembled rabble of reporters, radio stringers, tourists, lollygaggers, policemen, and freelance gawkers. They were all craning and writhing and rolling their eyes and gesturing and jabbering away with the excitement of the event. A public execution wouldn’t have drawn a crazier mob.

"ap 01:25"|1.25|"It was all very smooth, much smoother than the centrifuge … just as Shepard and Grissom said it would be. He had gone through the same g-forces so many times … he hardly noticed them as they built up. It would have bothered him much more if they had been less. Nothing novel! No excitement, please! It took thirteen seconds for the huge rocket to reach transonic speed. The vibrations started. It was just as Shepard and Grissom said: it was much gentler than the centrifuge. He was still lying flat on his back, and the g-forces drove him deeper and deeper into the seat, but it all felt so familiar. He barely noticed it. He kept his eyes on the instrument panel the whole time … All quite normal, every little needle and switch in the right place … No malevolent instructor feeding Abort problems into the loop … As the rocket entered the transonic zone, the vibration became intense. The vibrations all but obliterated the roar of the engines. He was entering the area of “max q,” maximum aerodynamic pressure, in which the pressure of the shaft of the Atlas forcing its way through the atmosphere at supersonic speed would reach almost a thousand pounds per square foot. Through the cockpit window he could see the sky turning black. Almost 5 g’s were driving him back into his seat. And yet … easier than the centrifuge … All at once he was through max q, as if through a turbulent strait, and the trajectory was smooth and he was supersonic and the rumble of the rocket engines was more muffled than ever and he could hear all the little fans and recorders and the busy little kitchen, the humming little shop … The pressure on his chest reached 6 g’s. The rocket pitched down. For the first time he could see clouds and the horizon. In a moment—there it was—the Atlas rocket’s two booster engines shut down and were jettisoned from the side of the shaft and his body was slammed forward, as if he were screeching to a halt, and the g-forces suddenly dropped to 1.25, almost as if he were on earth and not accelerating at all, but the central sustainer engine and two smaller engines were still driving him up through the atmosphere … A flash of white smoke went up past the window … No! The escape tower was firing early—but the
JETTISON TOWER light wasn’t on! … He didn’t see the tower go … Wait a minute … There went the tower, on schedule … The JETTISON TOWER light came on green … The smoke must have been from the booster rockets as they left the shaft … The rocket pitched back up … going straight up … The sky was very black now … The g-forces began pushing him back into his seat again … 3 g’s … 4 g’s … 5 g’s … Soon he would be forty miles up … the last critical moment of powered flight, as the capsule separated from the rocket and went into its orbital trajectory … or didn’t … Hey! … All at once the whole capsule was whipping up and down, as if it were tied to the end of a diving board, a springboard. The g-forces built up and the capsule whipped up and down. Yet no sooner had it begun than Glenn knew what it was. The weight of the rocket on the launch pad had been 260,000 pounds, most of it oxidizer and fuel, the liquid oxygen and RP-1 fuel. This was being consumed at such a furious rate, about one ton per second, that the rocket was becoming merely a skeleton with a thin skin of metal stretched over it, a tube so long and light that it was flexing. The g-forces reached six and then he was weightless, just like that. The sudden release made him feel as if he were tumbling head over heels, as if he had been catapulted off the end of that same springboard and was falling through the air doing forward rolls. But he had felt this same thing on the centrifuge when they ran the g-forces up to seven and then suddenly cut the speed. At the same moment, right on schedule … a loud report … the posigrade rockets fired, throwing the capsule free of the rocket shaft … the capsule began its automatic turnabout, and all the proper green lights went on in front of him, and he knew he was “through the gate,” as they said."|"The Right Stuff"|"Tom Wolfe"

It was an absolute mass of electric lights, and south of it there was another one, a smaller one. The big mass was the city of Perth and the smaller one was a town called Rockingham.

Well, it was up to the Pilot now … to aim the capsule correctly for re-entry … The other was a warning about excess cabin water. It built up as a by-product of the oxygen system. Nevertheless, he pressed on with the checklist. He was supposed to exercise by pulling on the bungee cord and then take his blood pressure. The Presbyterian Pilot! He did it without a peep. He was pulling on the bungee and watching the red lights when he began sailing backward into the sunrise again. Two hours and forty-three minutes into the flight, his second sunrise over the Pacific … seen from behind through a periscope. But he hardly watched it.

Some of them seemed to be miles away. A huge field of them, a galaxy, a microuniverse. No question

He was really no longer in the mood for sightseeing. He was starting to think about the sequence of events that would lead to the retrofiring over the Atlantic after he had been around the world one more time. He had to fight both the thrusters and the gyros now. He kept releasing and resetting the gyros to see if the automatic attitude control would start functioning again. It was all out of whack. He would have to position the capsule by using the horizon as a reference. He was sailing backward over America. The clouds began to break. He began to see the Mississippi delta.

14:45|"2:45 in the afternoon"|"Oh, pretty good. It wasn’t Yeager, but it wasn’t bad. He was inside of one and a half tons of non-aerodynamic metal. He was a hundred thousand feet up, dropping toward the ocean like an enormous cannonball. The capsule had no aerodynamic qualities whatsoever at this altitude. It was rocking terribly. Out the window he could see a wild white contrail snaked out against the blackness of the sky. He was dropping at a thousand feet per second. The last critical moment of the flight was coming up. Either the parachute deployed and took hold or it didn’t. The rocking had intensified. The retropack! Part of the retropack must still be attached and the drag of it is trying to flip the capsule … He couldn’t wait any longer. The parachute was supposed to deploy automatically, but he couldn’t wait any longer. Rocking … He reached up to fire the parachute manually—but it fired on its own, automatically, first the drogue and then the main parachute. He swung under it in a huge arc. The heat was ferocious, but the chute held. It snapped him back into the seat. Through the window the sky was blue. It was the same day all over again. It was early in the afternoon on a sunny day out in the Atlantic near Bermuda. Even the landing-bag light was green. There was nothing even wrong with the landing bag. There had been nothing wrong with the heat shield. There was nothing wrong with his rate of descent, forty feet per second. He could hear the rescue ship chattering away over the radio. They were only twenty minutes away from where he would hit, only six miles. He was once again lying on his back in the human holster. Out the window the sky was no longer black. The capsule swayed under the parachute, and over this way he looked up and saw clouds
and over that way blue sky. He was very, very hot. But he knew the feeling. All those endless hours in the heat chambers—it wouldn’t kill you. He was coming down into the water only 300 miles from where he started. It was the same day, merely five hours later. A balmy day out in the Atlantic near Bermuda. The sun had moved just seventy-five degrees in the sky. It was 2:45 in the afternoon. Nothing to do but get all these wires and hoses disconnected. He had done it. He began to let the thought loose in his mind. He must be very close to the water. The capsule hit the water. It drove him down into his seat again, on his back. It was quite a jolt. It was hot in here. Even with the suit fans still running, the heat was terrific. Over the radio they kept telling him not to try to leave the capsule. The rescue ship was almost there. They weren’t going to try the helicopter deal again, except in an emergency. He wasn’t about to attempt a water egress. He wasn’t about to hit the hatch detonator.

12:00|noon|"The seven pilots and their wives thought they had seen every sort of parade there was, but this one was sui generis. There were thousands of people lining the streets. They did not make a sound, however. They stood there four and five deep at the curbs, sweating and staring. They sweated a river and they stared ropes. They just stared and sweated. The seven lads, each in his emblazoned convertible, were standing up grinning and waving, and the wives were smiling and waving, and the children were smiling and looking around—everyone was doing the usual—and the crowds just stared back. They didn’t even smile. They looked at them with a morose curiosity, as if they were prisoners of war or had come from Alpha Centauri and no one was sure whether or not they comprehended the local lingo. Every now and then some very old person would wave and yell something hearty and encouraging, but the rest were just planted there in the sun like tarbabies. Of course, anyone fool enough to stand around in the asphalt mush of Downtown at noon watching a parade was obviously defective to begin with. The parade plowed on, however, through wave after wave of catatonia and rippling lassitude."|"The Right Stuff"|"Tom Wolfe"

there and shook her ancient haunches at the seven single-combat warriors. It was electrifying. It was quite beyond sex, show business, and either the sins or rigors of the flesh. It was two o’clock in the afternoon on the Fourth of July, and the cows burned on, and the whiskey roared goddamned glad to see you and the Venus de Houston shook her fanny in an utterly baffling blessing over it all."|"The Right Stuff"|"Tom Wolfe"

You hit the sack in Hangar S about ten or eleven the night before, and they woke you up about three in the morning, in the dark, and they took you out to the rocket and they laid you down on a contoured couch for two, three, four hours while they tuned in all the systems for the lift-off. You didn’t have a damned thing to do, really, during most of this; so why not catch up on all the sleep you’d missed?"|"The Right Stuff"|"Tom Wolfe"

"ap ~ 08:00"|"about eight"|"By the moment of lift-off there was quite a circus in progress out front of Gordo’s house in Timber Cove. The Genteel Beast was outdoing itself in the death-watch department. One of the television networks had erected a
stupendous aerial on the lawn of a house across the way, a gigantic thing, about eight stories high, the better to beam to the world live pictures of the house inside which Astronaut Cooper’s wife, Trudy, was maintaining her anxious vigil in front of the TV set. Milling around underneath the aerial and in the street and on the sidewalks was the biggest mob of reporters and camera crewmen you could imagine. Slovenly but nevertheless seemly they were. They treated Trudy Cooper, in their coverage, as if she had stepped right out of Life magazine, as if she were wearing a pageboy bob and playing “Moonlight in Vermont” on the old upright in the family room to keep up the spirits of herself and the children while Gordon’s life was on the line in the longest American mission yet."|"The Right Stuff"|"Tom Wolfe"
"~ 19:30"|"about 7:30 p.m."|"Gordo’s flight was to last thirty-four hours, meaning that Trudy would undergo the longest siege by the Beast and have the most protracted danger wake yet. Two sets of wives came by. Louise Shepard brought most of the other Original Seven wives in her convertible. Later on, some of the Other Nine wives came by—Jim Lovell’s wife Marilyn, Ed White’s wife Pat, Neil Armstrong’s wife Jan, and John Young’s wife Barbara. Everybody tried to listen to Gordo’s transmissions from the capsule over a high-frequency radio receiver Wally Schirra had loaned Trudy. It was the receiver that had been in Wally’s capsule during his flight. But about all you could get out of it was static. So they went out on the patio in the back, out of sight of the Animal, and watched the television coverage of the flight, off and on, and ate devil’s-food cake. In the true spirit of the wake, friends and neighbors had brought over food. During his ninth orbit, which began about 7:30 p.m., Gordo was supposed to try to go to sleep for a few hours, and Trudy decided that she and their two daughters, Jan and Cam, should try to get some rest, too. In the morning Gordo was still up there, twenty-four hours into the flight, and the Beast
was still outside the door, and the danger wake was going strong. About noon, as Gordo began his last four orbits, you could tell from the television reports that his capsule was beginning to develop electrical problems. During the next-to-last orbit they became worse. It now appeared as if Gordo would have to line up the capsule for re-entry manually, without any assistance from the automatic control system at all. Trudy received a telephone call from Deke Slayton. He told her that she and the children shouldn’t worry, because Gordo had practiced completely manual re-entries many times on the procedures trainer. “This is what we wanted to do anyway,” he said."|"The Right Stuff"|"Tom Wolfe"

"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"When Yeager had departed in 1954, Pancho’s had still been standing. Today the base was loaded with military and civil-service personnel, every GS-type in the manual, working for the Air Force, for NASA, even for the Navy, which had a small piece of the X–15 program. At four o’clock it was worth your life to be heading upstream during the mad rush from the air conditioners in the office buildings to the air conditioners in the tract homes in Lancaster."|"The Right Stuff"|"Tom Wolfe"
"ap 04:00"|400|"At 40,000 feet Yeager began his speed run. He cut in the afterburner and it slammed him back in his seat, and he was now riding an engine with nearly 16,000 pounds of thrust. As soon as the Machmeter hit 2.2, he pulled back on the stick and started the climb. The afterburner would carry him to 60,000 feet before exhausting its fuel. At precisely that moment he threw the switch for the rocket engine … terrific jolt … He’s slammed back in his seat again. The nose pitches up to 70 degrees. The g-forces start rising. The desert sky starts falling away. He’s going straight up into the indigo. At 78,000 feet a light on the console … as usual … the main engine overheating from the tremendous exertion of the climb. He throws the switch, and shuts it down, but the rocket is still accelerating. Who doesn’t know this feeling if he doesn’t! The bastards are fantastic! … One hundred thousand feet … He shuts down the rocket engine. He’s still climbing. The g-forces slide off … makes you feel like you’re pitching forward … He’s weightless, coming over the top of the arc … 104,000 feet … It’s absolutely silent … Twenty miles up … The sky is almost black. He’s looking straight up into it, because the nose of the ship is pitched up. His angle of attack is still about 50 degrees. He’s over the top of the arc and coming down. He pushes the sidearm control to bring down the nose of the ship. Nothing
happens … He can hear the thruster working but the nose isn’t budging. It’s still pitched up. He hits the thruster again … Shit! … She won’t go down! … Now he can see it, the whole diagram … This morning at 108,000 feet the air was so thin it offered no resistance and you could easily push the nose down with the thrusters. At 104,000 feet the air remains just thick enough to exert aerodynamic pressure. The thrusters aren’t strong enough to overcome it … He keeps hitting the reaction controls … The hydrogen peroxide squirts out of the jet on the nose of the ship and doesn’t do a goddamned thing … He’s dropping and the nose is still pitched up … The outside of the envelope! … well, here it is, the sonofabitch … It doesn’t want to stretch … and here we go! … The ship snaps into a flat spin. It’s spinning right over its center of gravity, like a pinwheel on a stick. Yeager’s head is on the outer edge of the circle, spinning around. He pushes the sidearm control again. The hydrogen peroxide is finished. He has 600 pounds of fuel left in the main engine but there’s no way to start it up. To relight the engine you have to put the ship nose down into a dive and force air through the intake duct and start the engine windmilling to build up the rpms. Without rpms there’s no hydraulic pressure and without hydraulic pressure you can’t move the stabilizer wings on the tail and without the stabilizer wings you can’t control this bastard at the lower altitudes … He’s in a steady-state flat spin and dropping … He’s whirling around at a terrific rate … He makes himself keep his eyes pinned on the instruments … A little sightseeing at this point and it’s vertigo and you’re finished … He’s down to 80,000 feet and the rpms are at dead zero … He’s falling 150 feet a second … 9,000 feet a minute … And what do I do next? … here in the jaws of the Gulp … I’ve tried A!—I’ve tried B!—The damned beast isn’t making a sound … just spinning around like a length of pipe in the sky … He has one last shot … the speed brakes, a parachute rig in the tail for slowing the ship down after a highspeed landing … The altimeter keeps winding down … Twenty-five thousand feet … but the altimeter is based on sea level … He’s only 21,000 feet above the high desert … The slack’s running out … He pops the speed brake … Bango!—the chute catches with a jolt … It pulls the tail up … He pitches down … The spin stops. The nose is pointed down. Now he only has to jettison the chute and let her
dive and pick up the rpms. He jettisons the chute … and the beast heaves up again! The nose goes back up in the air! … It’s the rear stabilizer wing … The leading edge is locked, frozen into the position of the climb to altitude. With no rpms and no hydraulic controls he can’t move the tail … The nose is pitched way above 30 degrees … Here she goes again … She’s back into the spin … He’s spinning out on the rim again … He has no rpms, no power, no more speed chute, and only 180 knots airspeed … He’s down to 12,000 feet … 8,000 feet above the farm … There’s not a goddamned thing left in the manual or the bag of tricks or the righteousness of twenty years of military flying … Chosen or damned! … It blows at any seam! Yeager hasn’t bailed out of an airplane since the day he was shot down over Germany when he was twenty … I’ve tried A!—I’ve tried B!—I’ve tried C! … 11,000 feet, 7,000 from the farm … He hunches himself into a ball, just as it says in the manual, and reaches under the seat for the cinch ring and pulls … He’s exploded out of the cockpit with such force it’s like a concussion … He can’t see … Wham … a jolt in the back … It’s the seat separating from him and the parachute rig … His head begins to clear … He’s in midair, in his pressure suit, looking out through the visor of his helmet … Every second seems enormously elongated … infinite … such slow motion … He’s suspended in midair … weightless … The ship had been falling at about 100 miles an hour and the ejection rocket had propelled him up at 90 miles an hour. For one thick adrenal moment he’s weightless in midair, 7,000 feet above the desert … The seat floats nearby, as if the two of them are parked in the atmosphere … The butt of the seat, the underside, is facing him … a red hole … the socket where the ejection mechanism had been attached … It’s dribbling a charcoal red … lava … the remains of the rocket propellant … It’s glowing … it’s oozing out of the socket … In the next moment they’re both falling, he and the seat … His parachute rig has a quarter bag over it and on the bag is a drogue chute that pulls the bag off so the parachute will stream out gradually and not break the chute or the pilot’s back when the canopy pops open during a high-speed ejection. It’s designed for an ejection at 400 or 500 miles an hour, but he’s only going about 175. In this infinitely expanded few seconds the lines stream out and Yeager and the rocket seat and the glowing red
socket sail through the air together … and now the seat is drifting above him … into the chute lines! … The seat is nestled in the chute lines … dribbling lava out of the socket … eating through the lines … An infinite second … He’s jerked up by the shoulders … it’s the chute opening and the canopy filling … in that very instant the lava—it smashes into the visor of his helmet … Something slices through his left eye … He’s knocked silly … He can’t see a goddamned thing … The burning snaps him to … His left eye is gushing blood … It’s pouring down inside the lid and down his face and his face is on fire … Jesus Christ! … the seat rig … The jerk of the parachute had suddenly slowed his speed, but the seat kept falling … It had fallen out of the chute lines and the butt end crashed into his visor … 180 pounds of metal … a double visor … the goddamned thing has smashed through both layers … He’s burning! … There’s rocket lava inside the helmet … The seat has fallen away … He can’t see … blood pouring out of his left eye and there’s smoke inside the helmet … Rubber! … It’s the seal between the helmet and the pressure suit … It’s burning up … The propellant won’t quit … A tremendous whoosh … He can feel the rush … He can even hear it … The whole left side of the helmet is full of flames … A sheet of flame goes up his neck and the side of his face … The oxygen! … The propellant has burned through the rubber seal, setting off the pressure suit’s automatic oxygen system … The integrity of the circuit has been violated and it rushes oxygen to the helmet, to the pilot’s face … A hundred percent oxygen! Christ! … It turns the lava into an inferno … Everything that can burn is on fire … everything else is melting … Even with the hole smashed in the visor the helmet is full of smoke … He’s choking … blinded … The left side of his head is on fire … He’s suffocating … He brings up his left hand … He has on pressure-suit gloves locked and taped to the sleeve … He jams his hand in through the hole in the visor and tries to create an air scoop with it to bring air to his mouth … The flames … They’re all over it … They go to work on the glove where it touches his face … They devour it … His index finger is burning up … His goddamned finger is burning! … But he doesn’t move it … Get some air! … Nothing else matters … He’s gulping smoke … He has to get the visor open … It’s twisted … He’s encased in a little broken globe dying in a cloud of his own fried flesh … The stench of it! … rubber
and a human hide … He has to get the visor open … It’s that or nothing, no two ways about it … It’s smashed all to hell … He jams both hands underneath … It’s a tremendous effort … It lifts … Salvation! … Like a sea the air carries it all away, the smoke, the flames … The fire is out. He can breathe. He can see out of his right eye. The desert, the mesquite, the motherless Joshua trees are rising slowly toward him … He can’t open his left eye … Now he can feel the pain … Half his head is broiled … That isn’t the worst of it … The damned finger! … Jesus! … He can make out the terrain, he’s been over it a million times … Over there’s the highway, 466, and there’s Route 6 crossing it … His left glove is practically burned off … The glove and his left index finger … he can’t tell them apart … they look as if they exploded in an oven … He’s not far from base … Whatever it is with the finger, it’s very bad … Nearly down … He gets ready … Right out of the manual … A terrific wallop … He’s down on the mesquite, looking across the desert, one-eyed … He stands up … Hell! He’s in one piece! … He can hardly use his left hand. The goddamn finger is killing him. The whole side of his head … He starts taking off the parachute harness … It’s all in the manual! Regulation issue! … He starts rolling up the parachute, just like it says … Some of the cords are almost melted through, from the lava … His head feels like it’s still on fire … The pain comes from way down deep … But he’s got to get the helmet off … It’s a hell of an operation … He doesn’t dare touch his head … It feels enormous … Somebody’s running toward him … It’s a kid, a guy in his twenties … He’s come from the highway … He comes up close and his mouth falls open and he gives Yeager a look of stone horror …"|"The Right Stuff"|"Tom Wolfe"
