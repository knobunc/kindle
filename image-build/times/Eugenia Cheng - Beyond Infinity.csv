However, this famous fraction is only an approximation to π and was handy in the days before there were calculators, let alone calculators on phones with a π button. π and 22/7 only agree in the first two decimal places, 3.14. This is perfectly good enough for whenever I need π in my daily life (which mostly involves scaling cake recipes up or down), but it’s very far from being mathematically equal.

I was very excited to be number 6 in the queue, and after spending all day as number 6 I had become quite good friends with number 5. (Numbers 7 and 8 were my parents.) In this case it really matters what order everyone arrives in. I arrived that early because I really wanted to be at the very front, and after queueing for thirteen hours, I didn’t really want anyone to push in front of me.

Even if we hit the target for a while, we’ll eventually start missing again: as we add more fractions on, the total keeps growing enough that we’ll eventually fall off the other end of the target. It heads toward infinity, despite the fact that the amount we’re adding on each time seems to become negligible. Note that the fact that the total keeps growing doesn’t automatically mean we’ll fail the target test. After all, when we add 1/2
and then 1/4 and then 1/8 and so on, the total is also growing. It’s just growing slowly enough that we never make it past 1.

This means that the area represented here is “infinite.” What this really means is that no matter how big a number we think of, if we go far enough down the graph (bigger and bigger n), we can find a place where the area up to that point is definitely bigger than the number we thought of.
