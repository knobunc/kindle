"ap 11:00"|eleven|"I awoke a little before eleven, having dreamed of moving spots. With the sorting and freezing almost done, Anna was exhorting the postdocs to start cleaning. As I got up to help, I noticed that all of us except Rudi were wearing stonewashed jeans. They were in all the stores then, so there was nothing obviously extraordinary about this. After my sun-scorched days in termite land, though, the pants looked like exoskeletons, protecting us from thorns and sun. Reproductively, they identified us to fellow members of the species “mall shopper,” signaling sexy industriousness to potential mates."|Underbug|"Lisa Margonelli"
08:00|"8:00 a.m."|"ALL OF THIS was far in the future when I visited the lab in winter 2014. Before I caught the train back to Maine, Kirstin offered to show me the TERMES robots again. In the lab they still sat under the poster of the big, dented termite’s head. The little TERMES were outwardly unchanged, but they had recently crossed a threshold of reliability. One morning Kirstin had turned them on at 8:00 a.m. and watched them do four thousand alignments correctly, building their little walls. By the end of the day they had the dependability and low error rate they needed to be taken seriously."|Underbug|"Lisa Margonelli"
05:00|"five in the morning"|"Scott sighed, placed his cursor over Termite Two, and clicked his mouse. He’d been mapping the glow since five in the morning, reviewing time-lapse photos taken every thirty seconds. Outside, the dawn was a glorious lavender, but he didn’t notice. Click by click Termite One transferred dyed water to other termites in the dish. Hmph, Scott sniffed. “More kissing.” He clicked and advanced the video, muttering, “One point five minutes later and their mouthparts are still touching.” The dye spread across the dish, transferred from mouth to mouth, causing termite after termite to wink on. This wasn’t only about water, though. They tilted their heads; they ran their mouthparts over the carrier’s antennae, grooming them. They stroked the water bearer’s flank. They even seemed to grovel."|Underbug|"Lisa Margonelli"
"< 00:00"|"near midnight"|"At the end of the trip, I drove the SUV down the Las Vegas strip near midnight. Colored lights slid off the car, drunk people tripped across the crosswalk in front of us, and I felt gloomy. Phil was leaning forward intently in the passenger seat, craning his head to look down and then up at the buildings. He was watching the people and the lights with such unguarded delight that he even called his wife to exclaim, waking her up. I said something predictably sour about this being a waste of electricity to get people to give up their money. No, Phil argued. People came here to the desert and built this out of nothing. It’s a monument to what humans can do if they feel like it. Las Vegas was a proxy for SCIENCE, that combination of hope and problem solving and luck and money. It was nice to look at the lights from this angle, and I felt much more generous than usual as we watched the fountains at the Bellagio burp flirtily while the sound system played “Hey, Big Spender!”"|Underbug|"Lisa Margonelli"
