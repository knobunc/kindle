cheating a bit by lifting the guard slightly, to get a better edge on
the metal he was turning. It was perverse, he thought, but in his
role as shop steward he'd bawl out anybody who tried to cut corners
by flouting the safety regulations in this way. Risk losing some
fingers for a bonus for a bunch of rich shareholders living in Surrey
or somewhere? Fuck that, he was mad. But it was the job, the process
of actually doing it. It was your own world and you lived almost

lived in the same scheme, the man getting off at the stop
before him. The guy was about five-ten, with short brown hair and
busy eyes. As Duncan recalled, he usually had a cheery, earthy
demeanour, at odds with his looks: conventionally handsome enough to
be accompanied by narcissism. Now, though, the man stood before him

I want this to be over. You take
too much because you want to feel or see something different, but
only for a short time. I can't take this because I've got to the
point that I'm not learning anything through it. It's just another
fuckin struggle. What the fuck is staying awake for days and days
meant to teach me? Like when we were kids in the summer and we would
spin and spin in front of the flats until we had some daft trippy
blackout and then we'd lie panting, sick and dizzy on the grass. The
grown-ups, sittin out in the sun, would tell us to stop. They knew we
were only fucking ourselves up and that no higher consciousness
awaited. There was a time when I thought that they were trying to
stop us from gaining entry into a secret world, but now I know that
they just couldn't be bothered cleaning up after all those sick,
puking little cunts. But I'm doing it again, lying to myself in the
name of oblivion. I want to see and feel less, rather than more,
that's why I'm off my tits. Bottom line: I'm fucking up and for no
apparent reason."|Glue|"Irvine Welsh"

yes, Scots, wherever I go. All sound heids n aw. California,
Thailand, Sydney, New York. Not just hanging out, not just havin it,
not even just living it. They're fucking well running the show; legal
or illegal, corporate or crustie, all that wasted entrepreneurial
talent, free as fuck, accents not a consideration, showing the locals
how to do it. Australia was different, it really was the last
frontier. So many heads had ended up here, after the dream had been
smashed by the not police and the black-ecomony drug-dealing nutters
which the Thatcher years
had thrown up. Britain felt old and shoddy, strangely even more so
with its New Labour and its modernisation, its wine bars and coke-snorting media and
advertising ponces everywhere. It only took one glum 'time gentlemen
please' to send the citizens of Cool Britannia scuttling home for the
last bus or Tube before the stroke of midnight. That old fist of

the Ingliston gig was a watershed for Kathryn, so was the Gauntlet
one for Terry. When they'd headed off, he'd deliberately left his
jacket over the back of a chair in the pub. He'd never keep shagging
cool young lassies like Lisa dressing like a twat. He resolved to
make more of an effort to slim down, kick those Häagen-Dazs,
white-pudding supper and masturbation
sessions into touch. Somewhere along the line, he realised, he'd lost
a bit of pride in himself. And it didn't necessarily mean dressing up
like a poof, because Ben Sherman was back now. He'd had his first one
at ten. Maybe this was the indication of a Juice Terry revival in
middle age. Get a haircut as well. It grew so quickly, but a number
one or two every other Saturday would be cool, if he could lose the
weight. Buy some Ben Shermans, new jeans. Do over a fuckin clathes
shop! Maybe a leather bomber jacket like Birrell's. He had to admit
that was smart. New Terry, New Clathes."|Glue|"Irvine Welsh"
