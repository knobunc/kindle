of her social status, in a commanding position on one of the steep hills
behind Lyme Regis, would no doubt seem today almost intolerable for its
functional inadequacies. Though the occupants in 1867 would have been quite
clear as to who was the tyrant in their lives, the more real monster, to
an age like ours, would beyond doubt have been the enormous kitchen range
that occupied all the inner wall of the large and ill-lit room. It had
three fires, all of which had to be stoked twice a day, and riddled twice
a day; and since the smooth domestic running of the house depended on it,
it could never be allowed to go out. Never mind how much a summer's day
sweltered, never mind that every time there was a southwesterly gale the
monster blew black clouds of choking fumes--the remorseless furnaces had
to be fed. And then the color of those walls! They cried out for some light
shade, for white. Instead they were a bilious leaden green--one that was,

dark face in Lyme that morning. Ernestina had woken in a mood that the
brilliant promise of the day only aggravated. The ill was familiar; but
it was out of the question that she should inflict its consequences upon
Charles. And so, when he called dutifully at ten o'clock at Aunt Tranter's
house, he found himself greeted only by that lady: Ernestina had passed
a slightly disturbed night, and wished to rest. Might he not return that
afternoon to take tea, when no doubt she would be recovered?"|"The French Lieutenant's Woman"|"John Fowles"
"ap 01:00"|one|"This was the echinoderm,
or petrified sea urchin. They are sometimes called tests (from the Latin
testa, a tile or earthen pot); by Americans, sand dollars. Tests vary in
shape, though they are always perfectly symmetrical; and they share a pattern
of delicately burred striations. Quite apart from their scientific value
(a vertical series taken from Beachy Head in the early 1860s was one of
the first practical confirmations of the theory of evolution) they are
very beautiful little objects; and they have the added charm that they
are always difficult to find. You may search for days and not come on one;
and a morning in which you find two or three is indeed a morning to remember.
Perhaps, as a man with time to fill, a born amateur, this is unconsciously
what attracted Charles to them; he had scientific reasons, of course, and
with fellow hobbyists he would say indignantly that the Echinodermia had
been ""shamefully

neglected,"" a familiar justification
for spending too much time in too small a field. But whatever his motives
he had fixed his heart on tests."|"The French Lieutenant's Woman"|"John Fowles"

that he had wandered more slowly than he meant. He unbuttoned his coat
and took out his silver half hunter. Two o'clock! He looked sharply back
then, and saw the waves lapping the foot of a point a mile away. He was
in no danger of being cut off, since he could see a steep but safe path
just ahead of him which led up the cliff to the dense woods above. But
he could not return along the shore. His destination had indeed been this
path, but he had meant to walk quickly to it, and then up to the levels
where the flint strata emerged. As a punishment to himself for his dilatoriness
he took the path much too fast, and had to sit a minute to recover, sweating
copiously under the abominable flannel. But he heard a little stream nearby
and quenched his thirst; wetted his handkerchief and patted his face; and
then he began to look around him."|"The French Lieutenant's Woman"|"John Fowles"
"~ 16:30"|"evening prayer"|"The second, more expectable
item on Mrs. Poulteney's hypothetical list would have been: ""Her voice.""
If the mistress was defective in more mundane matters where her staff was
concerned, she took exceedingly good care of their spiritual welfare. There
was the mandatory double visit to church on Sundays; and there was also
a daily morning service--a hymn, a lesson, and prayers--over which the
old lady pompously presided. Now it had always vexed her that not even
her most terrible stares could reduce her servants to that state of utter
meekness and repentance which she considered their God (let alone hers)
must require. Their normal face was a mixture of fear at Mrs. Poulteney
and dumb incomprehension--like abashed sheep rather than converted sinners.
But Sarah changed all that. Hers was certainly a very beautiful voice,
controlled and clear, though always shaded with sorrow and often intense
in feeling; but above all, it was a sincere voice. For the first time in
her ungrateful little world Mrs. Poulteney saw her servants with genuinely
attentive and sometimes positively religious faces. That was good; but
there was a second bout of worship to be got through. The servants were
permitted to hold evening prayer in the kitchen, under Mrs. Fairley's indifferent
eye and briskly wooden voice. Upstairs, Mrs. Poulteney had to be read to
alone; and it was in these more intimate ceremonies that Sarah's voice
was heard at its best and most effective. Once or twice she had done the
incredible, by drawing from those pouched, invincible eyes a tear. Such
an effect was in no way intended, but sprang from a profound difference
between the two women. Mrs. Poulteney believed in a God that had never
existed; and Sarah knew a God that did."|"The French Lieutenant's Woman"|"John Fowles"
02:30|matins|"But we must now pass to the
debit side of the relationship. First and foremost would undoubtedly have
been: ""She goes out alone."" The arrangement had initially been that Miss
Sarah should have one afternoon a week free, which was considered by Mrs.
Poulteney a more than generous acknowledgment of her superior status vis-a-vis
the maids' and only then condoned by the need to disseminate tracts; but
the vicar had advised it. All seemed well for two months. Then one morning
Miss Sarah did not appear at the Marlborough House matins; and when the
maid was sent to look for her, it was discovered that she had not risen.
Mrs. Poulteney went to see her. Again Sarah was in tears, but on this occasion
Mrs. Poulteney felt only irritation. However, she sent for the doctor.
He remained closeted with Sarah a long time. When he came down to the impatient
Mrs. Poulteney, he gave her a brief lecture on melancholia--he was an advanced
man for his time and place--and ordered her to allow her sinner more fresh
air and freedom."|"The French Lieutenant's Woman"|"John Fowles"
"ap 01:00"|"one o'clock"|"Later that night Sarah might
have been seen--though I cannot think by whom, unless a passing owl--standing
at the open window of her unlit bedroom. The house was silent, and the
town as well, for people went to bed by nine in those days before electricity
and television. It was now one o'clock. Sarah was in her nightgown, with
her hair loose; and she was staring out to sea. A distant lantern winked
faintly on the black waters out towards Portland Bill, where some ship
sailed towards Bridport. Sarah had seen the tiny point of light; and not
given it a second thought."|"The French Lieutenant's Woman"|"John Fowles"
02:30|matins|"Dr. Grogan was, in fact,
as confirmed an old bachelor as Aunt Tranter a spinster. Being Irish, he
had to the full that strangely eunuchistic Hibernian ability to flit and
flirt and flatter womankind without ever allowing his heart to become entangled.
A dry little kestrel of a man, sharp, almost fierce on occasion, yet easy
to unbend when the company was to his taste, he added a pleasant astringency
to Lyme society; for when he was with you you felt he was always hovering
a little, waiting to pounce on any foolishness--and
yet, if he liked you, it was always with a tonic wit and the humanity of
a man who had lived and learned, after his fashion, to let live. There
was, too, something faintly dark about him, for he had been born a Catholic;
he was, in terms of our own time, not unlike someone who had been a Communist
in the 1930s--accepted now, but still with the devil's singe on him. It
was certain--would Mrs. Poulteney have ever allowed him into her presence
otherwise?--that he was now (like Disraeli) a respectable member of the
Church of England. It must be so, for (unlike Disraeli) he went scrupulously
to matins every Sunday. That a man might be so indifferent to religion
that he would have gone to a mosque or a synagogue, had that been the chief
place of worship, was a deceit beyond the Lymers' imagination. Besides
he was a very good doctor, with a sound knowledge of that most important
branch of medicine, his patients' temperament. With those that secretly
wanted to be bullied, he bullied; and as skillfully chivvied, cosseted,
closed a blind eye, as the case required."|"The French Lieutenant's Woman"|"John Fowles"
"ap 10:30"|"half past ten"|"The two gentlemen, the tall
Charles with his vague resemblance to the late Prince Consort and the thin
little doctor, finally escorted the ladies back to their house. It was
half past ten, the hour when the social life of London was just beginning;
but here the town was well into its usual long sleep. They found themselves,
as the door closed in their smiling faces, the only two occupants of Broad
Street. The doctor put a finger on his nose. ""Now for you, sir, I prescribe
a copious toddy dispensed by my own learned hand."" Charles put on a polite
look of demurral. ""Doctor's orders, you know. Dulce est desipere, as the
poet says. It is sweet to sip in the proper place."""|"The French Lieutenant's Woman"|"John Fowles"

o'clock"|"Lyell, let me interpose,
was the father of modern geology. Already Buffon, in the famous
Epoques
de la Nature of 1778, had exploded the myth, invented by Archbishop
Ussher in the seventeenth century andrecorded solemnly in countless editions
of the official English Bible, that the world had been created at nine
o'clock on October 26th, 4004 B.C. But even the great French naturalist
had not dared to push the origin of the world back further than some 75,000
years. Lyell's Principles of Geology, published between 1830 and 1833--and
so coinciding very nicely with reform elsewhere-- had burled it back millions.
His is a largely unremembered, but an essential name; he gave the age,
and countless scientists in other fields, the most meaningful space. His
discoveries blew like a great wind, freezing to the timid,but invigorating
to the bold, through the century's stale metaphysical corridors. But you
must remember that at the time of which I write few had even heard of Lyell's
masterwork, fewer believed its theories, and fewer still accepted all their
implications. Genesis is a great lie; but it is also a great poem; and
a six-thousand-year-old womb is much warmer than one that stretches for
two thousand million. Charles was therefore interested--both his future
father-in-law and his uncle had taught him to step very delicately in this
direction--to see whether Dr. Grogan would confirm or dismiss his solicitude
for the theologians. But the doctor was unforthcoming. He stared into his
fire and murmured, ""They have indeed."""|"The French Lieutenant's Woman"|"John Fowles"

did was eat less than their masters, whatever their lack of gastronomic
propriety--the boots greeted him with the news that his master had gone

have been penetrated with tragedy, since when Aunt Tranter (who kept uncivilized
rural hours) came down to the kitchen only a minute later, she found Mary
slumped in a collapse of tears at the kitchen table. The deaf cook's sarcastic
uplift of her chin showed there was little sympathy there. Mary was interrogated;
and Aunt Tranter soon elicited, in her briskly gentle way, the source of
misery; and applied a much kinder remedy than Charles had. The maid might
be off till Ernestina had to be attended to; since Miss Ernestina's heavy
brocade curtains customarily remained drawn until ten, that was nearly
three hours' grace. Aunt Tranter was rewarded by the most grateful smile
the world saw that day. Five minutes later Sam was to be seen sprawling

For the twenty-ninth time that
morning Sam caught the cook's eye, directed his own to a row of bells over
the kitchen door and then eloquently swept them up to the ceiling. It was
noon. One might have thought Sam glad to have a morning off; but the only
mornings off he coveted were with more attractive female company than that
of the portly Mrs. Rogers.
""'E's not 'imself,"" said
the dowager, also for the twenty-ninth time. If she felt irritated, however,
it was with Sam, not the young lord upstairs. Ever since their return from
Lyme two days before, the valet had managed to hint at dark goings-on.
It is true he had graciously communicated the news about Winsyatt; but
he had regularly added ""And that ain't 'alf of what's a-foot."" He refused
to be drawn. ""There's sartin confidences"" (a word he pronounced with a
long i) ""as can't be yet spoken of, Mrs. R. But things 'as 'appened my

They arrived at the White Lion
just before ten that night. The lights were still on in Aunt Tranter's
house; a curtain moved as they passed. Charles performed a quick toilet
and leaving Sam to unpack, strode manfully up the hill. Mary was overjoyed
to see him; Aunt Tranter, just behind her, was pinkly wreathed in welcoming
smiles. She had had strict orders to remove herself as soon as she had
greeted the traveler: there was to be no duenna nonsense that evening.

follows, that as new species in the course of time are formed through natural
selection, others will become rarer and rarer, and finally extinct. The
forms which stand in closest competition with those undergoing modification

They had arrived in Lyme just
before two. For a few minutes Charles took possession of the room he had
reserved. Again he paced up and down, but now in a nervous agony, steeling
himself for the interview ahead. The existentialist terror invaded him
again; perhaps he had known it would and so burned his boats by sending
that letter to Sarah. He rehearsed again the thousand phrases he had invented
on the journey from Exeter; but they fled through his mind like October
leaves. He took a deep breath, then his hat, and went out.
Mary, with a broad grin as
soon as she saw him, opened the door. He practiced his gravity on her.
""Good afternoon. Is Miss Ernestina at home?"" But before she could answer
Ernestina herself appeared at the end of the hall. She had a little smile."|"The French Lieutenant's Woman"|"John Fowles"

In fairness to Charles it must
be said that he sent to find Sam before he left the White Lion. But the
servant was not in the taproom or the stables. Charles guessed indeed where
he was. He could not send there; and thus he left Lyme without seeing him
again. He got into his four-wheeler in the yard, and promptly drew down
the blinds. Two hearse-like miles passed before he opened them again, and
let the slanting evening sunlight, for it was now five o'clock, brighten
the dingy paintwork and upholstery of the carriage.
It did not immediately brighten
Charles's spirits. Yet gradually, as he continued to draw away from Lyme,
he felt as if a burden had been lifted off his shoulders; a defeat suffered,
and yet he had survived it. Grogan's solemn warning--that the rest of his
life must be lived in proof of the justice of what he had done--he accepted.
But among the rich green fields and May hedgerows of the Devon countryside
it was difficult not to see the future as fertile--a new life lay ahead
of him, great challenges, but he would rise to them. His guilt seemed almost
beneficial: its expiation gave his life its hitherto lacking purpose. An
image from ancient Egypt entered his mind--a sculpture in the British Museum,
showing a pharaoh standing beside his wife, who had her arm round his waist,
with her other hand on his forearm. It had always seemed to Charles a perfect
emblem of conjugal harmony, not least since the figures were carved from
the same block of stone. He and Sarah were not yet carved into that harmony;
but they were of the same stone."|"The French Lieutenant's Woman"|"John Fowles"

blank. Then she called for Betsy Anne, who appeared and was severely cross-examined
by her mistress ... that is, until Charles abruptly left."|"The French Lieutenant's Woman"|"John Fowles"

In re Miss Ernestina Freeman

We are instructed by Mr.

request you to attend at
these chambers at 3 o'clock this coming Friday. Your failure to attend
will be

regarded as an acknowledgment
of our client's right to proceed.

Charles took the letter to his
own solicitors. They had handled the Smithson family affairs since the
eighteenth century. And the present younger Montague, facing whose desk
the confessed sinner now shamefacedly sat, was only a little older than
Charles himself. The two men had been at Winchester together; and without
being close friends, knew and liked each other well enough.

Harry?"""|"The French Lieutenant's Woman"|"John Fowles"
"ap 03:15"|"quarter past

Charles and Montague were ushered into a funereal waiting room in one of
the Inns of Court. Charles felt it was something like a duel; Montague
was his second. They were made to cool their heels until a quarter past
three. But since this preliminary penance had been predicted by Montague,
they bore it with a certain nervous amusement."|"The French Lieutenant's Woman"|"John Fowles"
