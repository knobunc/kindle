23:00|twenty-three|"For a few moments, he watched Beirut stream past him: the people flickering into the booths from unknown places; the crowds flowing past him on foot, now that the slidewalks had been turned off for the night. Then the clocks began to strike twenty-three. Louis Wu straightened his shoulders and stepped out to join the world."|Ringworld|"Larry Niven"
"< 00:00"|"before midnight"|"In Resht, where his party was still going full blast, it was already the morning after his birthday. Here in Beirut it was an hour earlier. In a balmy outdoor restaurant Louis bought rounds of raki and encouraged the singing of songs in Arabic and Interworld. He left before midnight for Budapest."|Ringworld|"Larry Niven"
"< 00:00"|"before midnight"|"In Budapest were wine and athletic dances, natives who tolerated him as a tourist with money, tourists who thought he was a wealthy native. He danced the dances and he drank the wines, and he left before midnight."|Ringworld|"Larry Niven"
"< 00:00"|"toward midnight"|"But it was wearing on toward midnight. Louis Wu found a transfer booth, inserted his credit card in the slot and dialed for Sevilla."|Ringworld|"Larry Niven"
00:01|"one minute past midnight that morning"|"He'd started it at one minute past midnight that morning. Why not. His friends were in every time band. There was no reason to waste a single minute of this day. There were sleep sets all over the house for fast, deep cat naps. For those who hated to miss anything there were wakeup drugs, some with interesting side effects, others with none."|Ringworld|"Larry Niven"
"< 00:00"|"a few minutes before midnight"|"And a few minutes before midnight, Louis Wu had walked into a transfer booth, dialed, and disappeared."|Ringworld|"Larry Niven"
"ap 01:00"|One|"""I've had four children myself,"" said Louis Wu. ""One by lottery. You'd have met three of them if you'd come twelve hours earlier."""|Ringworld|"Larry Niven"
"> 17:00"|"A little after seventeen"|"""Oh boy. What time is it?""
""A little after seventeen.""
""I've been a bad host. How goes the party?"""|Ringworld|"Larry Niven"
"ap 03:00"|three|"""Four kzinti? Not three?""
""My mistake. I miscounted. It was three.""
""Forgive me, Louis."" The puppeteer exposed his other head as far as the eye. ""My manic phase has ended. I am in the depressive leg of my cycle."""|Ringworld|"Larry Niven"
"ap 08:00"|0800|"""Excuse me,"" said the puppeteer. ""Report to Outback Field, Australia, tomorrow at 0800. Bring personal possessions not to exceed fifty pounds Earth weight. Louis, you will do the same. Ahh —"" The puppeteer raised his heads and howled."|Ringworld|"Larry Niven"
"ap 02:00"|"two o'clock"|"The pilot's cabin was crowded. Louis hunched over the instrument panel, protecting buttons ftm the puppeteer's careless hooves.
""Spectroanalysis… yes. Now the blue-and-yellow double at two o'clock…
""I have my bearings. Swing to 348, 72."""|Ringworld|"Larry Niven"
12:00|"high noon"|"""You wouldn't. It's been too long since you had a sun. These orbiting rectangles must be there to separate night from day. Otherwise it would always be high noon on the ring."""|Ringworld|"Larry Niven"
12:00|noon|"Louis was bone tired. He mounted his flycycle and looked about him, wondering if he had forgotten anything. He saw Teela staring straight upward, and even through the mist of exhaustion he saw that she was horrified.
""There ain't no justice,"" she swore. ""It's still noon!""
""Don't panic. The —"""|Ringworld|"Larry Niven"
12:00|noon|"""Louis! We've been working for a good six hours, I know we have! How could it be still noon?"""|Ringworld|"Larry Niven"
12:00|noonday|"The shadows were funny; the light was funny. Louis looked up and found a white sliver of noonday sun. Stupid, he told himself as he waited for the tears to stop. His reflexes were faster than his brain."|Ringworld|"Larry Niven"
12:00|noon|"""No,"" said Teela. She stood naked on the blanket and stretched her arms to the noon sun. ""It feels good. Do you know that I've never seen you naked in daylight?"""|Ringworld|"Larry Niven"
12:00|noon|"They flew beneath a fading sliver of noon sun. The Ringworld showed above itself in glowing blue stripes, brighter every minute."|Ringworld|"Larry Niven"
12:00|noon|"Louis had flown all night and well into the morning. He wasn't sure how long. The motionless noon sun was a psychological trap; it either compressed or stretched time, and Louis wasn't sure which."|Ringworld|"Larry Niven"
00:00|midnight|"Through that gap Louis saw a horizontal band of jet black, eight inches broad and three feet off the ground. He looked beyond it, looked for a similar strip of baby blue chocked with midnight blue rectangles; and he found it."|Ringworld|"Larry Niven"
12:00|noon|"The sky would always be overcast this close to the Eye storm. In the gray-white noon light they filed toward a vertical black cloud tens of stories high."|Ringworld|"Larry Niven"
