12:00|noon|"A column of smoke rose thin and straight from the cabin
chimney. The smoke was blue where it left the red of the clay. It
trailed into the blue of the April sky and was no longer blue but
gray. The boy Jody watched it, speculating. The fire on the
kitchen hearth was dying down. His mother was hanging up pots and
pans after the noon dinner. The day was Friday. She would sweep
the floor with a broom of ti-ti and after that, if he were lucky,
she would scrub it with the corn shucks scrub. If she scrubbed
the floor she would not miss him until he had reached the Glen.
He stood a minute, balancing the hoe on his shoulder."|"The Yearling"|"Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings"

them, he’ll learn to have a heart as black as midnight.”"|"The Yearling"|"Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings"
12:00|"high
noon"|"Jody settled himself halfway up the live oak. Penny and Julia
disappeared. The shade of the oak was cool. A light breeze moved
through its leaves. Jody’s shaggy hair was wet. He pushed it out
of his eyes and wiped his face on his blue sleeve, then settled
himself to quiet. Silence took over the scrub. Far away a hawk
cried shrilly and was gone. No bird stirred in any branches. No
creature moved or fed. No bees droned, or any insect. It was high
noon. Everything living was resting in the heat of the sun’s
meridian. Everything except Penny and old Julia, who moved now
somewhere among the scrub oaks and the myrtle. Bushes crackled
below him. He thought his father was returning. He almost
betrayed himself with a quick movement. A bleat sounded. A fawn
was moving from under the protection of a low clump of palmettos.
It must have been there all the time. Penny had known. Jody held
his breath."|"The Yearling"|"Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings"
12:00|noon|"Penny said, “We got to noon somewhere, and a deer is mighty
like to run over us right here. When you noon, you jest as good
to noon where the game walks.”"|"The Yearling"|"Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings"
"ap < 10:00"|"nearly ten o’clock"|"There was not a field of sweet potatoes, but an endless sea.
Jody looked behind him at the rows he had finished hoeing. They
were beginning to make a respectable showing, but the rows
unfinished seemed to stretch to the horizon. The July heat
simmered on the earth. The sand was scalding to his bare feet.
The leaves of the sweet potato vines curled upward, as though the
dry soil, and not the sun, were burning them. He pushed back his
palmetto hat and wiped his face with his sleeve. By the sun, it
must be nearly ten o’clock. His father had said that if the sweet
potatoes were hoed by noon, he might go in the afternoon to see
Fodder-wing, and get a name for the fawn."|"The Yearling"|"Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings"

12:00|noon|"The buckets alone were heavy. They were of hand-hewn cypress,
and the ox-yoke from which they hung was of white oak. Jody hung
the yoke over his shoulders and trotted down the road. The fawn
loped after him. The sink-hole was dark and still. There was more
sunlight in the early morning and at evening, than at noon, for
the thick leaves of the trees cut off the overhead sun. The birds
were still. Around the sandy rim of the sink-hole they were
nooning and dusting themselves. In late afternoon they would fly
down for water. The doves would come, and the jorees, the
red-birds and the bee-martins, the mocking-birds and the quail.
He could not be too hurried to run down the steep slope to the
bottom of the great green bowl. The fawn followed and they
splashed together across the pool. The fawn bent its head to
drink. He had dreamed of this."|"The Yearling"|"Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"At nine o’clock Buck stirred and lit a candle. At ten o’clock
a horse and rider clattered into the yard. It was Penny on old
Cæsar. He dropped the reins over its head and came into the
house. Pa Forrester, as head of the house, rose and greeted him.
Penny looked about at the dark faces. The old man pointed to the
half-open bedroom door."|"The Yearling"|"Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings"

12:00|noon|"The sun laid a heavy hand on the scrub and on the clearing. Ma
Baxter’s bulk suffered with the heat. Penny and Jody, lean and
clean-limbed, felt the temperature only in an increasing
reluctance to move rapidly, or often. They did the chores
together in the morning, milked the cow, fed the horse, chopped
wood for cooking, brought water from the sink-hole, and then were
through until the evening. Ma Baxter cooked hot dinner at noon,
then banked the fire on the hearth with ashes; and supper was
cold, consisting of the noon surplus."|"The Yearling"|"Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings"
12:00|noon|"The morning of the sixth day was exactly like the others.
Since they would be drenched in any case, Penny and Jody stripped
to their breeches and went to the field with sacks. They worked
until noon in the down-pour, pulling the slippery pods from the
bushes. They came in for a hurried dinner and went back again
without troubling to change their clothes. They covered most of
the field. The hay, Penny said, was a total loss, but they would
do what they could to save the peas. Some of the pods were
mature. They spent the evening and late into the night shelling
the peas, sticky and mouldering. Ma Baxter built up a slow fire
on the hearth and spread out the peas close to the heat to dry.
Jody was awakened several times in the night by the sound of some
one going out to the kitchen to replenish the fire."|"The Yearling"|"Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings"
00:00|midnight|"They turned back to the camp-fire. It glowed comfortingly in
the darkness. The midnight was still. The stars were so bright
that when they looked away from the fire, they could see the
water shining in the ponds. The air was cool. Jody wished that he
could camp always like this, with his father. All that he lacked
was Flag beside him. Penny moved the torch across the Forresters.
Buck threw his arm across his face, but slept on. Mill-wheel was
flat on his back. His black beard lifted and fell with his heavy
breathing."|"The Yearling"|"Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings"
00:00|midnight|"All the food animals, deer and turkey, squirrel and ‘possum,
were so scarce that a day’s hunt might produce nothing. The
unfriendly animals had suffered as heavy losses. At first Penny
thought that this would be of advantage. It became plain almost
at once that the result was to make the remaining killers
hungrier and more desperate because of their own shortened food
supply. He became alarmed for the Baxter hogs and built a pen for
them inside the lot. All the family went together to the woods
and gathered acorns and scrub palmetto berries for the hogs.
Penny set aside a measure of the new corn for fattening them. A
few days later a stamping and squealing sounded in the lot at
midnight. The dogs, aroused, ran barking and Penny and Jody
pulled on their breeches and followed with a torch. The fattest
barrow was missing. The kill had been made so neatly that there
was no sign of struggle. A small trail of blood led across the
lot and over the fence. It had required a large animal to kill
and carry a heavy hog so handily. Penny took a hasty look at the
tracks."|"The Yearling"|"Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings"
"> 12:00"|"after noon"|"Cæsar accepted his load patiently. He seemed to have no
fear of the yearling bear, as he had had of the large one. Penny
walked ahead, leading him. Jody felt as fresh as though the day
were only beginning. He ran in front. The dogs trailed behind. It
was not much after noon when they reached the clearing. Ma Baxter
was not expecting them so soon. She heard them and came to the
gate to meet them. She shaded her eyes against the sun. Her heavy
face lightened at sight of the game."|"The Yearling"|"Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings"
"< 12:00"|"toward
noon"|"The licorice had long been swallowed. It was getting on toward
noon and he was famished."|"The Yearling"|"Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings"
12:00|noon|"The cold food at noon tasted better than most hot dinners.
They sat and ate and rested under the good strong sun. They
loosened their jackets. When they rose to go on, the knapsacks
seemed heavy for a time, then they became once more accustomed to
them. It seemed for a time that old Slewfoot meant either to make
a wide circle back to Forresters’ or Baxter’s Island, or to
continue straight across the scrub to new feeding grounds on the
Ocklawaha."|"The Yearling"|"Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings"
12:00|"high noon"|"The impetus sent them forward again. At high noon they came up
with the quarry. He had decided, at long last, to stop and fight
it out. The dogs had him at bay. He swayed sideways on his thick
short legs, growling and baring his teeth. His ears were laid
flat in his fury. When he turned his back for further retreat,
Julia nipped at his flanks and Rip rounded him to spring for his
shaggy throat. He slashed at them with great curved claws. He
backed away. Rip swung behind him and sunk his teeth in a leg.
Slewfoot squealed shrilly. He wheeled with the swiftness of a
hawk and raked the bulldog to him. He caught him up in his
fore-paws. Rip yelped in pain, then fought gamely to keep the
jaws above him from closing on his backbone. The two heads tossed
back and forth, snarling and snapping, each trying for the
other’s throat while protecting his own. Penny lifted his gun. He
took steady aim and fired. With Rip hugged to his breast, old
Slewfoot dropped. His killing days were done."|"The Yearling"|"Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"They reached the river at nine o’clock and bellowed for the
ferry. Across the river, they rode on to the church. It was
lighted. Horses and wagons and oxen and carts were tethered to
the trees in the yard."|"The Yearling"|"Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings"
12:00|noon|"He bolted his dinner at noon and hurried back to the planting.
He worked so fast that a couple of hours would finish it the next
morning. He sat at Penny’s bedside after supper, chattering like
a squirrel. Penny listened gravely, as always, but his responses
were sometimes detached and vacant, and his thoughts were
elsewhere. Ma Baxter kept stonily to herself. Dinner and supper
had both been meager and indifferently cooked, as though she took
her revenge from behind her own citadel, the cook-pot. Jody
paused for breath. In the hammock, a whip-poor-will called.
Penny’s face brightened."|"The Yearling"|"Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings"
