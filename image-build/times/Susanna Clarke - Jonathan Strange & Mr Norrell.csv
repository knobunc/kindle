The news which Mr Honeyfoot and Mr Segundus had brought seemed to have drawn out all the gentlemen in the city who had ever peeped into a book of magic — and York was still, after its own fashion, one of the most magical cities in England; perhaps only the King’s city of Newcastle could boast more magicians."|"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell"|"Susanna Clarke"

Whether he had intended it or not Mr Norrell’s magic had spread beyond the Cathedral close and into the city. Three statues from the west front of the Cathedral had been taken to Mr Taylor’s workshops to be mended. Centuries of Yorkshire rain had worn down these images and no one knew any longer what great personages they were intended to represent. At half past ten one of Mr Taylor’s masons had just raised his chisel to the face of one of these statues intending to fashion it into the likeness of a pretty saintess; at that moment the statue cried out aloud and raised its arm to ward off the chisel, causing the poor workman to fall down in a swoon. The statues were later returned to the exterior of the Cathedral untouched, their faces worn as flat as biscuits and as bland as butter."|"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell"|"Susanna Clarke"

Looking out of the window he saw a great lamp-lit chaos of people, carriages and horses. Thinking that everyone else must find the London streets as confusing as he did, he naturally fell into the supposition that his coachman and footman had lost their way and, banging on the roof of the carriage with his stick, he cried, “Davey!

His friends were almost frantic. One of those friends, Lady Winsell, went to Bath where, at a concert of Italian music, she made the acquaintance of some people called Wintertowne, a widow and her daughter. A week later Lady Winsell wrote to Sir Walter: “It is exactly what I have always wished for you. Her mother is all for a great marriage and will make no difficulties — or at least if she does then I rely upon you to charm them away. As for the money! I tell you, my dear friend, when they named the sum that is to be hers, tears sprang into my eyes! What would you say to one thousand a year? I will say nothing of the young person herself — when you have seen her you shall praise her to me much more ably than ever I could to you.” At about three o’clock upon the same day that Mr Drawlight attended the recital by the Italian lady, Lucas, Mr Norrell’s footman, knocked upon the door of a house in Brunswick-square where Mr Norrell had been summoned to meet Sir Walter. Mr Norrell was admitted to the house and was shown to a very fine room upon the first floor."|"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell"|"Susanna Clarke"

Two men ran out to catch the horses’ heads and the light from the oil-lamp above the steps shewed the crowd to be a dozen or so of Mrs Wintertowne’s servants all on the look-out for the magician who was to bring back their young lady. Human nature being what it is, I dare say there may have been a few among them who were merely curious to see what such a man might look like.

Even then the new manservant had to wait some moments more while the butler talked out his surprize that Mr Strange should ask for sherry-wine, a thing he hardly ever took.

Mr Redeshawe observed that the most important individuals among them, both men and women, were gorgeously attired in gold and silver armour and that they rode white rabbits — which were to them as elephants are to us. When he asked what they were doing, one brave soul among them climbed up to his shoulder and bellowed in his ear that they intended to fight a battle according to the rules of Honoreé Bonet and Mr Redeshawe’s carpet was exactly suited to their purpose because the regularity of the patterns helped the heralds determine that each army was positioned correctly and took no unfair advantage over the other. However Mr Redeshawe did not chuse that a battle should be fought upon his new carpet and so he took a broom and …No, wait!”Lady Pole stopt and suddenly covered her face with her hands. “That is not what I wished to say!”"|"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell"|"Susanna Clarke"

Not for many hundreds of years had their art been held in such high regard. Many attempts to win the war had ended in disaster and magic now seemed the greatest hope Britain had. There were gentlemen from the War Office and all the various boards and offices of the navy who were most anxious to employ Mr Norrell and Mr Strange. The press of business at Mr Norrell’s house in Hanover-square was often so great that visitors were obliged to wait until three or four in the morning before Mr Strange and Mr Norrell were able to attend to them.

Carts bearing wounded men were lined up against a wall while the officer in charge sent men to seek out the hospital and other places to receive them. Meanwhile five or six plain-faced, capable-looking nuns had arrived from one of the convents and were going about among the wounded men giving them draughts of fresh milk from a tin cup.

Though it was a little after noon he had not yet found the time to shave and dress and was sitting in his dressing-gown amid a litter of books, papers, breakfast plates and coffee cups. A letter he wanted was missing and so he went to look for it. On entering the drawing-room he was surprized to find someone there."|"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell"|"Susanna Clarke"

Immediately those regiments which had been quartered inside the city marched out of the Namur Gate and down the road that led to Quatre Bras.

He collected together his silver dish; half a dozen books of magic; a pair of pistols; a light summer coat with a number of unusually deep pockets; a dozen hard-boiled eggs; three flasks of brandy; some pieces of pork pie wrapped in paper; and a very large silk umbrella."|"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell"|"Susanna Clarke"

Just before noon drums and fierce singing were heard in the distance.

Mrs Honeyfoot still had a great deal of the schoolgirl in her and she caught up her husband’s hands and danced around the breakfast-table with him as the only possible means of expressing what she felt. Then she took Mr Segundus’s hands and danced around the table with him, and when both magicians protested against any more dancing, she continued by herself. Mr Segundus’s only regret (and it was a very slight one) was that Mr and Mrs Honeyfoot did not feel the surprize of the thing quite as he intended they should; their opinion of him was so high that they found nothing particularly remarkable in great ladies wishing to establish schools solely for his benefit."|"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell"|"Susanna Clarke"

Mrs Evans, Davey’s mother, pressed me to stay with them and come home the next day, but Evans and I talked it over and we both agreed that all would be well providing I left instantly and came home by the most direct way possible — in other words I should ride up to the Dyke and cross over into England before the storm was upon me.”1"|"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell"|"Susanna Clarke"

But Bullbridge said that they were not the bells of St George’s — that the bells he had heard were many, and that St George’s had but one.

00:00|midnight|"It grieves me to tell you that I now have better grounds for the uneasiness I told you of in my last letter.2 I have done everything I can think of to break the bars of her black prison, but without success. There is no spell that I know of that can make the smallest dent in such ancient magic. For aught I know there is no such spell in the whole English canon. Stories of magicians freeing captives from Faerie are few and far between. I cannot now recall a single one. Somewhere in one of his books Martin Pale describes how fairies can grow tired of their human guests and expel them without warning from the brugh; the poor captives find themselves back home, but hundreds of years after they left it. Perhaps that is what will happen. Arabella will return to England long after you and I are dead. That thought freezes my blood. I cannot disguise from you that there is a black mood upon me. Time and I have quarrelled. All hours are midnight now. I had a clock and a watch, but I destroyed them both. I could not bear the way they mocked me. I do not sleep. I cannot eat. I take wine — and something else. Now at times I become a little wild. I shake and laugh and weep for a time — I cannot say what time; perhaps an hour, perhaps a day. But enough of that. Madness is the key. I believe I am the first English magician to understand that. Norrell was right — he said we do not need fairies to help us. He said that madmen and fairies have much in common, but I did not understand the implications then, and neither did he. Henry, you cannot conceive of how desperately I need you here. Why do you not come? Are you ill? I have received no replies to my letters, but this may mean that you are already on the road to Venice and this letter may perhaps never reach you."|"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell"|"Susanna Clarke"

Flora had fallen into habits of quiet and solitude. If her aunt spoke to her she answered cheerfully enough, but few indeed were the conversations that she began. In Venice Flora had been the chief instigator of all their pleasures; now she simply fell in with whatever projects of exploration Aunt Greysteel proposed. She preferred those occupations that require no companion. She walked alone, read alone, sat alone in the sitting-room or in the ray of faint sunshine which sometimes penetrated the little courtyard at about one o’clock. She was less open-hearted and confiding than before; it was as if someone — not necessarily Jonathan Strange — had disappointed her and she was determined to be more independent in future."|"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell"|"Susanna Clarke"

The Pillar of Darkness had been seen from many parts of the city, moving across the face of the sea. Its surface had flickered and twists and spirals of Darkness had darted in and out, so that it appeared to be made of black flames. How Strange had contrived to cross over the water — whether he had travelled in a boat, or whether his passage had been purely magical — was not known. The storm by which he had tried to hide his approach had not been conjured up until he got to Strà , eight miles from Padua."|"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell"|"Susanna Clarke"

00:00|midnight|"But such thoughts as these provided only a temporary comfort. The house was too silent, the darkness too magical. He was too aware of the servants gathered together sociably in one place, and the two magicians doing God-knew-what in another place, and himself, alone, in a third place. There was an old longcase clock that stood in one corner of the room, a last remnant of Mr Norrell’s childhood home in York. This clock had, like all the others in the house, turned to midnight when Strange arrived. But it had not done so willingly; it protested very volubly against such an unexpected turn of events. Its ticking was all askew; it seemed to be drunk — or possibly in a fever — and from time to time it made a sound that was remarkably like an indrawn breath; and every time it did so Lascelles thought that Strange had entered the room and was about to say something."|"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell"|"Susanna Clarke"
00:00|midnight|"Sometime later the servants left Hurtfew (there was no saying exactly how much later it was — their pocket-watches, like the clocks, had all turned to midnight). With baskets and valises slung over their arms and knapsacks on their backs, they led the horses by the halter. There were also two donkeys and a goat who had always lived in the stables because the horses found him agreeable company. Lascelles followed at a distance; he had no desire to appear part of this rag-tag and bobtail procession, but neither did he want to be left alone in the house."|"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell"|"Susanna Clarke"

Once there was quite a crowd of young people present which naturally led to dancing. It was all very delightful but often Mr Honeyfoot and Mr Segundus would slip away to discuss the one thing which really interested both of them — why was there no more magic done in England? But talk as they would (often till two or three in the morning) they came no nearer to an answer; and perhaps this was not so very remarkable, for all sorts of magicians and antiquarians and scholars had been asking the same question for rather more than two hundred years."|"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell"|"Susanna Clarke"
"ap 02:30"|"half past two"|"The York magicians had all looked over the letter and expressed their doubts that any body with such small handwriting could ever make a tolerable magician. Then — with some slight regret for the wonderful library they would never see — they had dismissed the other magician from their thoughts. But Mr Honeyfoot said to Mr Segundus that the importance of the question, “Why was there no more magic done in England?” was such that it would be very wrong of them to neglect any opening. Who could say? — the other magician’s opinion might be worth having. And so he wrote a letter proposing that he and Mr Segundus give themselves the satisfaction of waiting on the other magician on the third Tuesday after Christmas at half past two. A reply came very promptly; Mr Honeyfoot with his customary good nature and good fellowship immediately sent for Mr Segundus and shewed him the letter. The other magician wrote in his small handwriting that he would be very happy in the acquaintance. This was enough. Mr Honeyfoot was very well pleased and instantly strode off to tell Waters, the coachman, when he would be needed."|"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell"|"Susanna Clarke"
