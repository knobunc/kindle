23:00|twenty-three|"Despite herself her thoughts now drifted towards her son. He was not a bit like his father, except in his open, sunny nature that so readily charmed everyone he met. Archie had been typical of the Army officer coming from good landed-gentry stock. After herself, hunting, shooting and fishing had been his passions, and on any polo ground he had been a joy to watch. Johnny cared for none of those things. He took after her family, in nearly all of whom a streak of art had manifested itself. In Johnny’s case it had come out as a flair for line and colour, and at twenty-three his gifts had already opened fine prospects for him with a good firm of interior decorators. But that meant his living in London. He could only come out to her once a year, and she could not afford to take long holidays in England."|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"The end of the war had left her in a mental vacuum. Three years had elapsed since Archie’s death, so she had come to accept it and was no longer subject to bouts of harrowing despair. But her job was finished and Johnny had just gone up to Cambridge; so she was now adrift without any absorbing interest to occupy the endless empty days that stretched ahead. Nearly six years of indifferent meals, taken at odd hours while working, often till after midnight, on Top-Secret projects that demanded secretarial duties of the most conscientious type, had left her both physically and mentally exhausted; so when it was learned that the villa had not been damaged or looted of its furniture, her friends had insisted that she should go south to recuperate."|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"
"ap > 01:00"|"A little after one o’clock"|"Then, last night the mystery had deepened still further. Molly was a light sleeper. A little after one o’clock she had been roused by the sound of a loose stone rattling down the steep slope of a garden path. Getting out of bed she went to the window. The moon was up, its silvery light gleaming in big patches on the cactus between the pine-trees, and there was the girl just going down the short flight of steps that led from her little terrace to the road."|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"
00:00|midnight|"Why, Molly wondered, when she never went out in the daytime, should she go out at night? It could hardly be that she was in hiding, because she spent the greater part of each day on the terrace, where she could easily be seen from the road by anyone passing in a car. The obvious answer seemed to be that she had gone out to meet someone in secret; but she had been neither fetched in a car nor returned in one, and she had not been absent quite long enough to have walked into St Raphael and back. Of course, she could have been picked up by a car that had been waiting for her round the next bend of the road, or perhaps she had had an assignation at one of the neighbouring villas. In any case, this midnight sortie added still further to the fascinating conundrum of what lay behind this solitary young woman having taken a villa on the Corniche d’Or."|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"
"< 12:00"|"a little before midday"|"It was a little before midday and the sun was strong enough now to tan anyone who was not used to it. As she made her way down the garden path that zigzagged among spiky cactus and strange-shaped succulents she saw a little green lizard run up the trunk of a tall palm-tree, and on reaching the terrace at the bottom she made a mental note that enough roses were in bloom in the bed behind it to furnish her with another bowl. Out in the road she walked along under the tall retaining wall of rough-hewn rock that supported both her garden and those of several medium-sized villas situated on the same slope. At intervals along it hung festoons of large-flowered yellow jasmine and purple bougainvillea. The scent of flowers, mingled with that of the primeval pine-wood among which the villas had been built, was delicious. For the ten-thousandth time the thought crossed her mind that never could she bring herself to leave it and face another English winter."|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"
"> 12:00"|"after midday"|"For a moment the girl’s face remained closed and secretive, then she replied, ‘Yes. I had been for a walk. I sleep most of the afternoon and go for a walk every night. I don’t know why, but I’ve always felt listless after midday; then, as darkness falls, I seem to wake up and want to do things.’"|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"
21:45|"nine forty-five in the evening"|"‘Really! That seems to fit my case.

"ap ~ 06:30"|"about half-past six"|"‘I don’t think there’s much more to tell, Johnny. During the past three days I’ve seen quite a bit of her. She is still nervous of going out in the daytime but, quite illogically, she doesn’t seem to mind at night. On Sunday I always dine out for a change, so yesterday afternoon I suggested that she should come with me to the Reserve at St Raphael. She said she would rather not, but about half-past six she turned up here and asked if she might change her mind. Of course I said “Yes”, and I’m sure she thoroughly enjoyed herself.’"|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"

"ap 07:20"|"twenty-past seven"|"Christina did change her mind, and returned at twenty-past seven dressed to accompany them to the Carlton. As she stepped from the half-darkness of the garden into the lighted room, both Molly and John had difficulty in hiding their astonishment. She was wearing a long frock of oyster satin. It was backless, strapless and low cut, to display her good neck and shoulders to the best advantage, but at the moment she had draped over them a short cape of dark skunk. Neither of them had seen her before in anything but very ordinary and rather girlish day clothes; so the difference in her appearance was quite striking. It made her look several years older and entirely sophisticated—a change that was further stressed by a new expression in her face and a much brisker manner."|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"

"~ 00:30"|"About half an hour after midnight"|"‘I’ll say she has.’ John brought the drink over to his mother, and went on, ‘About half an hour after midnight she suggested that I should take her to the Casino to do a spot of gambling. I hedged a bit at first; as on the one hand I would have liked an excuse not to dance with her any more for the time being, while on the other I didn’t particularly want to go to the rooms, because you know how it has always been with me. I can make money if I work for it, but I never seem to have any luck at the tables.’"|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"

I’ve known that chap Fleury, the under-manager, for years. All I had to do was to ask for him and say we’d forgotten to bring our passports. It was a safe bet that he would pass me in, and anyone else who was with me. So, on the basis that if “Paris was worth a Mass” my chastity must be worth a couple of thousand francs, I agreed. By a quarter to one we were in the Casino. And what do you think happened then?’"|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"‘At least we now have good reason to suppose that the Canon is not to be trusted. No clergyman who had a proper respect for his cloth would show himself in the gambling-rooms of a Casino—anyhow after midnight—and his being a friend of de Grasse makes him suspect in the highest degree. I wouldn’t mind betting the serial rights of my next book that the story he told Christina about an accident to her father was a pack of lies, and designed solely to lure her away from her villa. Then, this invitation of de Grasse’s: he and his wife are not the sort of people to spend their time showing young girls the beauties of the Riviera. It is all Lombard Street to a china orange that the Canon put him up to asking her to St Tropez for some nefarious purpose of his own.’"|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"
"ap 02:30"|"half-past two"|"That afternoon there was to be a Battle of Flowers at St Maxime. As they had planned to go to it, they set off there immediately after lunch. The little town was only about fifteen miles away; so by half-past two John had parked the car and they were installed in the seats for which Molly had already secured tickets. Their chairs were in the front row facing the sea, with only a temporary barrier of chestnut-pale fence railing them off from the promenade down which the procession would come; and while they waited for it they could scarcely prevent their gaze from frequently coming to rest on the white houses of St Tropez, which lay in the shelter of the headland just across the bay. Both of them were wondering how Christina was faring there, and although John endeavoured to engage his mother’s attention, he did not succeed in doing so until the sounds of the town band in the distance heralded the beginning of the fête."|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"
"ap 04:30"|"half-past four"|"In every carriage the girls had big baskets of surplus flowers, with which to pelt the onlookers, and everyone in the crowd had a supply of similar ammunition bought from the gaily-dressed flower vendors. At a slow walk the colourful procession passed along between the barriers, while to and from both sides hundreds of little bunches of mimosa, stock, short-stemmed narcissi and carnation heads sailed up into the bright sunlight, thrown by the laughing girls and applauding people. To give the audience ample opportunity to enjoy the spectacle to the full, at intervals of about a quarter of an hour the procession passed and re-passed three times; so it was half-past four before the battle was finally concluded."|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"
"ap < 06:00"|"just before six"|"Molly thought his reasoning sound, so she did not press her suggestion. In consequence, having collected the car, instead of heading west, they headed east for home, arriving there just before six.

But Christina was still absent."|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"
"ap ~ 03:30"|"about half-past three"|"More perturbed than ever for the girl’s safety, Molly mounted the steep path to her own house, to be met in the hall by Angele, who told her that at about half-past three the English mademoiselle who lived next door had telephoned, but had left no message. When John came in they discussed the situation again, but there seemed nothing they could do, as to have appealed to the police on the bare facts that a girl had gone out to lunch with friends and failed to return home by six o’clock would have been laughable."|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"

There, the road made a hairpin bend round the deep narrow gulf, then wound its way along the peninsula that had St Tropez as its seaward end.

In the hush of midday, with sunlight dappling the grass through leaves unstirred by a breath of wind, it was a truly sylvan spot, having that spell-like quality which made them almost expect that a nymph or faun would peep out at them from behind one of the trees at any moment. Instinctively feeling that they could find no more delightful place in which to picnic, they turned into the orchard without exchanging a word, and, sitting down under one of the trees a little way from the road, unpacked their lunch."|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"

Try to consider our prospects dispassionately. Jules has the best part of an hour’s start of us. If he meant to take her to the yacht and the crew were only waiting till he got her on board to put to sea, they will have sailed long before we get there. We couldn’t have caught them, even if we had set off the moment we discovered her disappearance. On the other hand, he could not have been certain that he would succeed in getting hold of her, or if he did at what hour he would be able to pull it off; so the odds are that he would not have ordered his crew to stand by from half-past eight till dawn, and will have to collect them.’"|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"

Jules must know all about the slowness of police procedure when the applicant for help can produce no definite evidence that any crime has been committed; so up till about eleven o’clock he can afford to snap his fingers at us.

John gave a quick glance at his watch. It was a quarter-past three. That told him that she might have run between forty to fifty miles along the coast, but in which direction he had no means of guessing. Obviously this was no time to argue; so he slid off the bunk, placed himself between the two sailors, so that the three of them formed an Indian file, and in this manner allowed himself to be escorted up on deck."|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"

A dinghy was lowered, Sergeant Bouvet and the captain of the vessel were taken leave of with warm thanks for their help, and the shore party were landed on a flat shelf of rock at the foot of the right-hand promontory, from which visitors to the hotel bathed in summer."|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"
"> 03:30"|"after half-past three this morning"|"Again John looked at Christina, and again she nodded.

"ap 10:30"|"half-past ten"|"After a glance at his watch, C.B. said, ‘It is half-past ten; so if John and I are to get to England today, we ought to be moving. I wonder which is the best bet for an aircraft, Nice or Marseilles?’"|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"‘Nice is some thirty kilometres nearer,’ replied Malouet, ‘and there is a plane that leaves at one o’clock for London.

C.B. sent a telegram to his office, asking that his car should be sent to meet him at Northolt; then, as there was still a quarter of an hour to spare, they had drinks and some delicious snacks at the airport bar."|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"When the time came to say goodbye, John and Christina both tried to make light of the matter; and he jokingly told her that when he met her at the prison gates on Monday he would have his pockets sewn up, as it was certain that by then she would have become a real old lag. Since they were in public he made no attempt to kiss her, but their eyes held one another’s in a long glance as they parted. Malouet watched with her until the plane had taken off, then they returned to the car and did the last four miles in to the centre of Nice. By two o’clock Christina’s name had been entered on the prison register, and, now a number, she was being escorted by a fat, garlic-breathing wardress to a cell."|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"North of London the earliest daffodils and almond-trees were not yet out, so there was no colour in the gardens, and the branches of the trees still displayed their winter bareness. The skies were grey, a chill wind was blowing and the rain lashed against the windows of the car; so their sixty-mile drive was a depressing contrast to the one through a smiling land of summer they had taken only that morning. It was already dark when at six o’clock they entered Colchester."|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"
"ap 08:30"|"half-past eight"|"There was, however, still a chance that something might be learned at Beddows’ home, so at half-past eight they got out the car again and took the road leading east out of Colchester to Walton-on-the-Naze."|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"
00:00|midnight|"When John had driven the car in under the trees, C.B. murmured in his most conspiratorial voice, ‘Now listen, partner. This bird may be dangerous. If he catches me out all sorts of unpleasant things might happen to yours truly. I don’t want you to start anything prematurely, because if matters go well I may be with him for a considerable time. But if I am not out of his house by midnight you are to go along to the village, telephone the police, then come in to get me.’"|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"
21:45|"nine forty-five that evening"|"‘You might as well suggest that I should attempt to stop the stars in their courses,’ snapped the Canon. ‘The 6th of March is her birthday. At nine forty-five that evening she comes of age. If she is not under my control by then the hopes that I have cherished for years will be dashed.’"|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"
12:00|midday|"‘Yes. As a matter of fact I was still one of his disciples, so with him at the time.’ C.B. was on safer ground now, as he had actually had a first-hand account of this grim affair from one of Crowley’s young men, and he went on: ‘The attempt took place in Paris. Crowley made up a coven, so including himself there were thirteen of us; and in this instance we were naturally all males. We were staying at an hotel on the Left Bank. The proprietor was an initiate, and it was quite a small place; so we took the whole premises for the night, and all the servants were got rid of from midday to midday. There was a big room at the top of the house which seemed just the thing for the purpose. In the afternoon we moved out every scrap of furniture and cleaned it with the utmost thoroughness. Then in the evening all of us assisted at the purificatory rites; but fortunately as it turned out, Crowley had decided that only his senior disciple, a chap who had taken the name of McAleister, should assist him at the actual evocation."|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"‘At ten o’clock the rest of us robed them, then left them there, and Crowley locked the door behind us. He had already issued strict injunctions that whatever sounds we might hear coming from the room, even if they were cries for help, we were in no circumstances to attempt to enter it; as such cries might be a trick of Pan’s made in an endeavour to evade him, and any interruption of the ritual would render the spell abortive. We had fasted all day, so our associate, the landlord, had prepared an excellent cold buffet for us downstairs in the dining-room. It wasn’t a very exciting meal, as all of us were aware of the magnitude of the task the Master Therion had set himself. We had great confidence in his powers, but it was probably several centuries since any adept had had the audacity to attempt to summon the Horned God in person, so we were naturally a bit nervy."|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"
00:00|midnight|"‘It was just on midnight when we heard the first noises upstairs. There were thumpings and shouts, then all Hell seemed to break loose. Piercing screams were mingled with what sounded like sacks of potatoes being flung about. We had the impression that the whole building was rocking. In fact it was, as the chandelier above us began to swing, the glasses jingled on the sideboard and a picture fell from the wall with a loud crash. It was like being in the middle of an earthquake, and the room in which we were sitting had suddenly become icy cold."|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"‘At last that miserable night ended. Dawn came and we began to hope that Crowley would soon come down, his fat face beaming with triumph, to make our fears seem ridiculous; but he didn’t. We waited till seven o’clock. There was still not a sound from the top of the house, so by then we felt that we were no longer justified in evading the issue. All the same, we didn’t exactly run upstairs, as by that time we were feeling pretty apprehensive about what we might find when we got there. For a moment or two all eleven of us stood huddled on the top of the landing, listening; but with the early morning noises coming up from the street we could not definitely make out any sound coming from the room. Someone suggested that after their exhausting ordeal Crowley and McAleister might still be sleeping, and the idea gave us fresh hope for the moment; but another fellow knocked hard on the door, and there was no reply. That left us with no alternative but to break down the door.’"|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"
"ap 10:30"|"half-past ten"|"Within a few moments he had fully regained his composure and his mind was once more working with its accustomed lucidity. A glance at his wrist-watch showed him that it was close on half-past ten, so he had been in the house for an hour and a quarter. The time, he felt, had been remarkably well spent, as he had achieved far more than he had hoped to do when he had, on the spur of the moment, decided to make this reconnaissance. He had found out not only that even prison was no certain sanctuary for Christina, but also the steps the Canon would take to get her out, and by offering himself as their instigator had now ensured that they would not be taken. By the time Copely-Syle discovered that his visitor had been an impostor it would be too late for him to make the arrangements necessary to secure Christina’s release from prison during the night of the 5th, and if she remained there until the 6th it would then be too late for him to get her back to England on her birthday. More, by his skilful winning of the Black Magician’s confidence, C.B. had become privy to the foul and terrible operations in which he was engaged, and had a good prospect of being able to render them abortive."|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"

Even should someone enquire for you during the next half-hour, if they are told that you have already left I do not believe for an instant that they would risk breaking in without some concrete reason for supposing that harm has befallen you. To do so would ruin your own success, had you managed to carry through your imposture; so before taking any action they would certainly go back to the inn to make quite sure you had not returned there. You are as much my creature now as any of the homunculi, and there is no power in the world that can prevent my doing what I like with you.’"|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"

It would be a great mistake to put you on the line unnecessarily early, in case someone stumbled on you.

He had already dismissed the idea that he might be rescued by John as in the highest degree unlikely. He had told John that if he was not out of the house by midnight he was to telephone the police and come in to find him. But by midnight, if the train was punctual, he would have been dead for fifty-five minutes; and John would certainly not attempt to force his way in more than an hour before the time he had been given. For all he knew, matters were going excellently and, as the Canon was certain to recognise him as Ellen’s friend, his premature entry, seeking C.B., might have thrown a spanner in the works at their most promising point.

It was an excellent principle. That’s the way to keep one’s nerve, and if it wasn’t for the fact that the Canon and his pals must be on the qui vive I’d make myself go back into that crypt.

The rain had eased a little and in one quarter of the dark heavens the moon was now trying to break through between banks of swiftly drifting cloud. The light it gave was just enough to outline dimly the irregularities of the building, parts of which were four hundred years old, and it glinted faintly on its windows. No light showed in any of them, neither was there now any sound of a wireless; but as it was still only a little after eleven o’clock C.B. feared that the Jutson couple might not yet have gone to sleep; so he continued to move with great caution."|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"

In consequence, in the car with John at the wheel once more, they collected their bags from the Weavers Arms and drove to the market town. There John dropped C.B. off at the police station and went on to book rooms and order dinner at the Red Lion."|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"By then it was getting on for eight o’clock. Soon afterwards C.B. came in and they sat down to dine. While they ate, in low voices they reviewed the situation, and could not escape the fact that they had far graver grounds for depression than they had had when dining there the night before. Then, their only cause for gloom had been that their journey appeared to have been rendered futile by their failure to locate Beddows through his office. Now they had found him, but he had refused them his help. They had also found out a great deal about the Canon; above all, that he was not merely seeking to corrupt Christina but, if he could get hold of her, meant to kill her."|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"
"ap 01:00"|one|"Beddows shook his head. ‘Of course not! I could hardly bear to look at one, and it would burn me if I touched it. As it was I had to be mighty careful when I poured the Holy water out: if I had spilt any on my hands it would have scalded me.’"|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"‘Yes. We’ve been lucky here in finding that the Jutsons go to bed early; but it’s only just eleven o’clock; so that servant of the Canon’s may still be up. I had thought of going to the front door and knocking him out as soon as he answered it. We would be almost sure of having the free run of the place then, as it is most unlikely that anyone who performs the Canon’s tricks would have any other servants living in; but the door to the crypt is of iron and has a Chubb lock. As Copely-Syle keeps the key to it on him we wouldn’t be able to get in that way; so I think we would do better to ignore the Egyptian and go straight in down the chimney.’"|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"
"ap 11:19"|"nineteen minutes past eleven"|"‘No. It is now nineteen minutes past eleven. Allowing for going and coming back, and our reconnaissance round the house before we went in, we could not have been in the crypt much more than seven minutes.’"|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"Soon after midnight they left the table and went out to the car. As Beddows stowed his suitcase in the back he said, ‘I’ve never done the Government down more than I’ve had to; but this is a case in which I have no scruples. It may need big money to finance bringing Copely-Syle to book; so we can’t afford to observe currency restrictions. Fortunately, I’ve always kept a tidy sum in my wall-safe against an emergency; so I was able to pack the best part of three thousand pounds in fivers into a couple of pairs of shoes.’"|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"
"ap 00:25"|"twenty-five past twelve"|"At twenty-five past twelve the night porter let them into the Red Lion. He booked Beddows a room on the same floor as the others, and entered an order from C.B. to call them all at a quarter to five. Before they went upstairs C.B. telephoned his office and asked the night duty officer to ring Northolt, and use all the pull he could to secure three seats on the plane leaving for Nice at 7.16. Then they went up to their rooms, got the worst of the dirt off themselves with a quick wash, and, mentally exhausted from the strain of the past few hours, fell asleep as soon as their heads touched their pillows."|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"

"ap 04:45"|"quarter to five"|"When C.B.’s bedside telephone rang, he roused out of a deep sleep and picked up the receiver. It was the night porter, who said: ‘Your call, sir. It’s a quarter to five and about half an hour ago I took a telephone message from your office. It was to report a telegram which reads “Special stop Despatched from Police Headquarters Nice at nought hours twenty stop Christina removed from prison without authority twenty-three hours fifteen stop Has since disappeared without trace stop Signed Malouet.”’"|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"
"ap > 11:30"|"a little after half-past eleven"|"‘Thank you,’ said C.B. quietly; but as he hung up, his face was grim. In a few minutes he would have to break it to John that, although they had braved such fearful perils during the earlier part of the night they had, after all, failed to save Christina. Beddows had abjured Satan at a little after half-past eleven. By about eighteen minutes the Canon had beaten them to it again."|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"
"ap 07:40"|"twenty minutes to eight"|"In spite of the delay, which held up the take-off until twenty minutes to eight, the flying conditions were so good that the aircraft made up most of the lost time, and they came down in the brilliant sunshine of Nice at ten past one. Molly and Malouet were both there to meet them and, after Beddows had been introduced, the elderly ex-inspector said: ‘I regret to say I have no news for you; but one gets as good a lunch at the airport restaurant here as anywhere in Nice; so I have booked a table. While we eat I will tell you all that is known of the most extraordinary occurrence last night.’"|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"

"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"The ex-inspector gave him a pitying look. ‘Is it likely that we should have neglected them, Monsieur; or that they are such fools as to have exposed themselves?

"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"John jumped up and left the table to telephone. When he returned a few minutes later he said, ‘I got on to Jules at the Capricorn, and he has agreed to see me at four o’clock. Mother, you’ll drive me over, won’t you? And I’d like Mr Beddows to come with us. He has certain arguments which I think might induce Jules to talk.’"|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"
"ap 05:30"|"half-past five"|"At half-past five John ordered a round of drinks. In the next hour he knocked back five double Martinis. As he ordered a sixth Molly laid a hand on his arm and said: ‘Johnny, haven’t you had enough—anyhow for the time being?’"|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"
"ap 06:45"|"quarter to seven"|"It was a quarter to seven when a page came to their table and said that Count Jules de Grasse would like to see them upstairs. Molly went out to the car; the two men hurried over to the lift. As soon as Jules had let them into the suite he said: ‘I think I have the information you want; but there is one proviso that I must make before I go any further. I require you both to give me your word of honour that you will not inform the police, either directly, or indirectly through your friends who brought them to the Ile de Port Cros, if I enable you to make use of the tip-off I have secured.’"|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"‘Good! I accept your promises; but even so it is unnecessary that you should know your final destination for the next hour or two. It is enough for me to tell you that the job is to be done up in the hills behind Nice. Drive back towards the city, but do not enter it. Across the Var and about two kilometres past the airport you will come to a turning that leads inland up to the little town of St Pancrace. Outside the church there you will find two men waiting for you. The taller of the two has a red beard. They are your guides, and will take you to the spot where the Canon and his friends are meeting. But I should warn you that you have none too much time. The meeting is due to start at nine o’clock.’"|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"
"ap 09:45"|"nine forty-five"|"‘It would be,’ Beddows muttered. ‘Christina’s birth hour is nine forty-five, and they would want to perform the … the actual sacrifice as near that time as possible.’"|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"
"ap 08:30"|"half-past eight"|"The streets of St Maxime and Fréjus hardly caused John a check, but he had to slow down to go through Cannes, and by then the sun was setting. When they passed Antibes the sky behind them was a rich glow of orange and salmon pink which by the time they crossed the River Var had faded to a few streaks. It was half-past eight and the light had gone as they wound their way up the hill into St Pancrace."|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"John drew a quick breath. ‘Then they are nearly an hour ahead of us! I was told that the meeting was not due to start till nine o’clock. It can’t be much more than twenty-to, and they may have started already.’"|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"The arrival of the police at the inn an hour before had resulted in the good woman who ran it keeping it open a little later than usual, and it was still not yet eleven o’clock when the stretcher party arrived there. In the public room a warm fire was glowing in the stove, and Christina, now fully conscious again, was made comfortable in borrowed wraps beside it. C.B. ordered coffee laced with cognac for them all to warm them up, and when John carried two cups over to the corner where Christina was sitting the others discreetly took theirs to the far end of the room."|"To the Devil, a Daughter"|"Dennis Wheatley"
