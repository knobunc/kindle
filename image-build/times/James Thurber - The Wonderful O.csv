00:00|midnight|"“What is this woeful wood?” croaked Littlejack, lost and all alone in another part of the forest. The dark was deep as midnight all around. “Whence comes this humming and this buzzing?” wailed Littlejack. And then he saw the source of the ominous sounds: locusts and hornets and dragonflies, yellowjackets and honeybees. They came in clouds and hosts and squadrons. “Black never thought of little things,” mourned Littlejack, “when he was issuing edicts.” He groped his way slowly into an outlandish grove, but there his way was clogged by a growth of toadstools and mushrooms and monkshood and bloodroot, foxglove, wolfbane and aconite, orchids and opium poppies, and the roots of mandragora. Spanish moss drooped down and Spanish bayonets shot up. “What are these woeful worts?” muttered Littlejack, now up to his ankles and his knees in worts: bloodwort, dragonwort, goutwort, hogwort, holewort, hoodwort, lousewort, moonwort, moorwort, scorpionwort, throatwort, toothwort, and woundwort."|"The Wonderful O"|"James Thurber"

And on this stroke a curious phenomenon occurred. Upon the ground, and all around, appeared a score of objects, each one different from the others."|"The Wonderful O"|"James Thurber"

“It’s noon,” cried Black, and all the people echoed, “Noon!”
Then they heard the ringing of a distant bell, sounding near and sounding nearer, ringing clear and ringing clearer, till all the sky was filled with music as by magic."|"The Wonderful O"|"James Thurber"

And all the crew saw things that weren’t there as they clambered aboard the ship and set her gloomy sails, and headed slowly out to sea. And then, beyond the far horizon, the great O storms began to rage and roar, the hurricanes,* the typhoon and the monsoon, the cyclone and tornado, and there were cloudbursts and waterspouts and fog and snow, and whirlpools and maelstroms, and other odd phenomena, each with its O. The night came on and in the light of lightning there were those on shore who saw, or thought they saw, the head of the giant Orion rising out of the sea. And there were those on shore who saw, or thought they saw, the vengeful ships of the great explorers: Columbus, De Soto, Cortez and Balboa, and all of the others since Jason and since Noah."|"The Wonderful O"|"James Thurber"
