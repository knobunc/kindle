"ap ~ 06:00"|"around six o‘clock"|"The facts of the case were alarmingly simple. It happened around six o‘clock one weekday evening when the Tube station was crowded with released office workers. There had been numerous cases of dipped-into handbags, emptied hip pockets and pinched purses at that particular station, so the railway police were inconspicuously alert. Two of them were present in the lift when Mr Hornby, a company director who prided himself on his use of public transport, felt a fluttering disturbance in his breast pocket and found his wallet flown away. Being an old-fashioned sort of company director he called out ‘Stop, thief!’ and the railway policeman in the lift detained the passengers. Trevor Timson was unhesitantly  denounced by a witness who said she saw him take the wallet, which was then found intact in his half-open shoulder bag. It contained three hundred pounds in crisp twenties."|"Rumpole and the Primrose Path"|"John Mortimer"
"ap 04:00"|"four o‘clock"|"So, after everyone had had a share of the New Bullingham warm welcome, Archie Prosser, the latest arrival at our Chambers, rose and opened his case. The story of the Underground station was told again in detail. Mr Hornby, the company director, entered the witness box and identified his stolen wallet, which was wrapped in cellophane and labelled ‘Prosecution Exhibit A’, being handled carefully as it had been examined for fingerprints. With some reluctance and a great deal of delay, the prosecution had agreed to providing the fingerprint evidence which had given me, when I read it, a good deal of quiet satisfaction. We had started after lunch  and by four o‘clock the New Bullingham beamed at us and said, ‘Would it suit the convenience of you two gentlemen if we stop now and we hear the chief prosecution witness in the morning?’ We beamed back and told him that would suit our convenience perfectly."|"Rumpole and the Primrose Path"|"John Mortimer"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"‘Certainly. I went back to my flat in the Gloucester Road. I had supper with my wife in the kitchen. A chop, I think. And baked jam roll. We watched the ten o’clock news and went to bed early. That is my private life.’ I have to admit, I was growing impatient with this journalist who didn’t seem to be interested in bloodstains. ‘There’s your story. Make what you like of it. I’m not Sir Mike Smedley. I don’t want to sue anyone for writing about how I spend my evenings.’"|"Rumpole and the Primrose Path"|"John Mortimer"
"ap 10:30"|Ten-thirty|"‘Perhaps you’ll deal with that issue in the morning, Mr Rumpole? Very well. Ten-thirty tomorrow.’ Phillida clearly felt her day’s work was done."|"Rumpole and the Primrose Path"|"John Mortimer"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"‘Oh, her.’ He seemed to know exactly whom I meant. ‘I don’t think she’s going to count much, is she? Sorry. Got to dash. I’ve got some calls to make before two o’clock.’"|"Rumpole and the Primrose Path"|"John Mortimer"
"ap 10:30"|Ten-thirty|"‘Very well, then. Ten-thirty tomorrow morning. But if there’s no further news of Miss Brewster then,’ the Judge was determined, ‘we’ll have to go on with the remaining eleven.’"|"Rumpole and the Primrose Path"|"John Mortimer"
12:00|midday|"Kathleen had spent the night before her disappearance from the Jury in West Heath Road, where she had put Cameron to bed. Early in the morning, however, the phone rang and a man’s voice announced briskly that he was Cameron’s father and he would be round to collect his son at midday. He wanted Cameron’s clothes packed and the boy ready to travel. If there were things that couldn’t be easily transported they would be sent for later. The man had then rung off, as though he was in a considerable. hurry and expected his instructions to be carried out to the letter."|"Rumpole and the Primrose Path"|"John Mortimer"
04:00|"four a.m."|"But on that morning when Cameron was to be taken from her, Kathleen Brewster forgot the trial. She had no time to worry about her failure to appear in the Jury box. She phoned Dick Catford, the ageing guitarist, and Christine, who had got home at four a.m. from the Candy Crocodile but was glad to be called up for the protection of Pam’s son. Kathleen also rang the local police, warning them of the proposed abduction of a child. The weary voice listening to her at first said it was a matrimonial dispute with which the police couldn’t become concerned. Later she was able to get in touch with another department, which promised to send a social worker, who never arrived. Cameron was collected by another friend from the Candy Crocodile, who offered to take him for lunch at McDonald’s and then to The Lord of the Rings at the Odeon Swiss Cottage. Short of nailing up the doors and borrowing a shotgun, Kathleen and her friends felt they could do no more."|"Rumpole and the Primrose Path"|"John Mortimer"
"ap 23:45"|"quarter to twelve"|"Access to Pam’s flat was to be discovered down a dark and slippery flight of steps from the front of a large Edwardian  house. A door in the area led into her basement flat. At a quarter to twelve, Christine and Dick the guitarist were waiting behind an open bedroom door, while Kathleen stood bravely by the entrance. At exactly twelve o’clock a man came down the steps into this area."|"Rumpole and the Primrose Path"|"John Mortimer"

She was telling me that she saw a man emerge from the back door. Two o‘clock in the morning under a full moon. Isn’t that right, Lady Sloper?’"|"Rumpole and the Primrose Path"|"John Mortimer"
