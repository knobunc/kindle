22:00|"ten o’clock that evening"|"As the owl hooted, Hilda breathed deeply. Sleep eluded me. I went through Hussein Khan’s story again. He had received a phone call, he said, when he was at his parents’ restaurant. (He had answered the phone himself, so there was no one to confirm the call.) It had been, it seemed, from a girl who said she was the senior tutor’s secretary and that the tutor wanted to meet him in the university library at ten o’clock that evening to discuss his future."|"Rumpole at Christmas"|"John Mortimer"
"ap 09:30"|"nine thirty"|"He had arrived at the William Morris building at nine thirty and had told Mr Luttrell, the man at the main reception area, that he was there to meet the senior tutor at the library. He said that when he had arrived at the library, the tutor wasn’t there and that he had waited for over an hour and then gone home, having never been near Honoria Glossop’s office."|"Rumpole at Christmas"|"John Mortimer"
21:30|"nine thirty that evening"|"Luttrell, the receptionist, was a smart, precise, self-important man with a sharp nose and a sandy moustache who clearly regarded his position as being at the centre of the university organization. He remembered Hussein Khan coming at nine thirty that evening, saying he had an appointment with the senior tutor, and going up to the library. At quarter to ten the Glossops had arrived. Ricky had gone with his wife to her office, but had left about fifteen minutes later. ‘He stopped to speak to me on the way out,’ Luttrell told Soapy Sam, ‘which is why I remember it well.’"|"Rumpole at Christmas"|"John Mortimer"

"ap ~ 11:00"|"Around eleven o’clock"|"After that, the evening at William Morris University followed its horrible course. Around eleven o’clock, Hussein Khan left, complaining that he had wasted well over an hour, no senior tutor had come to talk to him, and that he was going back to his parents’ restaurant in Golders Green. After that Ricky telephoned the reception desk saying that he couldn’t get any reply from his wife’s office and would Mr Luttrell please go and make sure she was all right. As we all know, Mr Luttrell went to the office, knocked, opened the door, and was met by the ghastly spectacle which was to bring us all together in Court Number One at the Old Bailey."|"Rumpole at Christmas"|"John Mortimer"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"Mr Rumpole did not agree. Mr Rumpole wanted Miss Sue Blackmore to be present in the flesh and he was ready to cross-examine her at length. And so we parted, expecting the trial of Hussein Khan for murder to start again at two o’clock."|"Rumpole at Christmas"|"John Mortimer"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"But Khan’s trial for murder didn’t start again at two o’clock or at any other time. I was toying with a plate of steak and kidney pie and a pint of Guinness in the pub opposite the Old Bailey when I saw the furtive figure of Sam Ballard oozing through the crowd. He came to me obviously heavy with news."|"Rumpole at Christmas"|"John Mortimer"
"ap 10:30"|"Ten thirty"|"‘Your schedule. Ten thirty at Uxbridge. In the case of Timson. Wasting police time. You want a printout?’"|"Rumpole at Christmas"|"John Mortimer"
12:00|midday|"Despite the Bug’s confidence, no van full of supper had arrived before I went to sleep or next morning. At midday Hilda and her friend Dodo arrived to find, on the kitchen table, only the frozen turkey pasties, the chips, peas and packets of toffee ice-cream which I had managed to dredge up from the now depleted shop which was alone open on the corner of Froxbury Mansions."|"Rumpole at Christmas"|"John Mortimer"
"ap ~ 10:00"|"Around ten o’clock"|"Accordingly I went to Pommeroy’s Wine Bar and thought about life with the help of a bottle of the old Château for a while, then went back to chambers. Around ten o’clock, I was surprised to hear a key turn in the front-door lock, followed by footsteps in the passageway. I waited for a minute and then emerged into the darkness and made for the clerk’s room, from which odd noises had started emerging."|"Rumpole at Christmas"|"John Mortimer"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"‘They must have done it after midnight when everyone else was asleep.’"|"Rumpole at Christmas"|"John Mortimer"
"~ 01:00"|"around one in the morning"|"‘What sort of time was that?’ I asked him.
‘I suppose it was around one in the morning.’
‘Had she been to bed?’"|"Rumpole at Christmas"|"John Mortimer"
"ap 02:30"|"two thirty"|"Someone, I wasn’t sure who at the time, had been in touch with the police and two officers were to come at two thirty to interview all the guests. Meanwhile two constables were sent to guard us. Hilda and I wanted to get out of what had now become a Hall of Doom and I asked for, and got, permission to walk down to the village. The young officer in charge seemed to be under the mistaken impression that barristers don’t commit murder."|"Rumpole at Christmas"|"John Mortimer"
"ap 02:30"|"two thirty"|"Hilda seemed pleased to be bought a large gin and tonic. Knowing that the wine on offer might be even worse than Pommeroy’s, I treated myself to a pint of stout.
‘We don’t have to be back there till two thirty,’ I told her.
‘I wish we never had to be back.’"|"Rumpole at Christmas"|"John Mortimer"
"~ 01:00"|"about one in the morning"|"Oriana gave her statement clearly and well. The trouble was that it did little to diminish or contradict the evidence against her. Yes, the Minchingham Hall health farm was in financial difficulties. Yes, Airlie had told her he was leaving her all his money, and she didn’t improve matters by adding that he had told her that his estate, after many years as a successful stockbroker, amounted to a considerable fortune. Yes, she got up at about one in the morning because she thought she heard a noise downstairs, but, no, she didn’t find anything wrong or see anybody. She passed the steam room and didn’t think it odd that it was in use as Airlie would often go into it when he couldn’t sleep at night. No, she saw nothing jamming the door and she herself did nothing to prevent the door being opened from the inside."|"Rumpole at Christmas"|"John Mortimer"
18:00|"six p.m."|"The DI and the DS laughed at this and once more Oriana gave a faintly amused smile. The turnips told us that they planned to be back again at six p.m. and that until then the witnesses would be carefully guarded and would not be allowed to leave the Hall."|"Rumpole at Christmas"|"John Mortimer"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"Oriana made a request. A school choir with their music master were coming to sing carols at four o’clock. Would they be allowed in? Rather to my surprise DI Britwell agreed, no doubt infected by the spirit of Christmas."|"Rumpole at Christmas"|"John Mortimer"
"ap < 06:00"|"nearly six o’clock"|"When it was nearly six o’clock Detective Inspector Britwell arrived. He asked me to bring Oriana into the dining hall and I went with her to hear the result of any further action he might have taken. It came, shortly and quickly."|"Rumpole at Christmas"|"John Mortimer"
