Thanks to my editor, John Parsley, who believed in my work from the beginning, shaped it with patience and insight, and guided the book almost to the end. Thanks to Reagan Arthur for all her support and enthusiasm, to Michael Noon for pulling everything together, to Barbara Perris for her thoughtful copyediting, and to Gabriella Mongelli for her good-humored replies to even my crankiest emails. I’m grateful to Lauren Velasquez, Carrie Neill, and Elizabeth Garriga for making sure this book wasn’t swamped by the media tides."|"The Water Will Come"|"Jeff Goodell"
"~ 02:00"|"about 2 a.m."|"Of course, the boom went bust. The Internal Revenue Service investigated Florida speculators, the Better Business Bureau exposed Florida con artists, journalists touted Florida scandals. And then, as if Mother Nature were getting her revenge for the blasting and draining of South Florida, at about 2 a.m. on September 18, 1926, a Category 4 hurricane slammed into Fisher’s newly minted paradise. “Miami Beach was isolated in a sea of raving white water,” journalist Marjory Stoneman Douglas wrote. Winds hit 128 miles per hour, turning utility poles into flying spears. Roofs Frisbeed off buildings. A ten-foot storm surge flooded Miami Beach. Homes floated off their foundations. When the water retreated, the streets were covered in sand, as were lobbies of swanky oceanfront hotels. The hurricane’s final toll: 113 people dead, 5,000 homes destroyed or damaged."|"The Water Will Come"|"Jeff Goodell"
"~ 17:00"|"about 5 p.m."|"We touched down in Kotzebue at about 5 p.m. The president was greeted on the tarmac by Reggie Joule, the mayor of the Northwest Arctic Borough; then we climbed into our assigned vehicles in the motorcade for the short drive to the high school. We rolled by flimsy weather-beaten houses with American flags hanging in the windows and broken dogsleds in the front yards. You could sense the hardship of life in a place where it gets down to 100 degrees below zero (with wind chill) in the long, dark winters and where the nearest road to civilization is 450 miles away."|"The Water Will Come"|"Jeff Goodell"
"~ 20:30"|"about 8:30 p.m."|"A moment later, Deese left to join the president, who was heading back to his armored SUV. At about 8:30 p.m., we motorcaded back to the airport and the president bounded up the steps to Air Force One. A small group of Alaskans waved at him from behind a chain link fence and shouted goodbyes. He had been in the Arctic for about four hours—but that was four hours more than any other president had committed. As I took my seat on Air Force One, I noticed that the president was already seated in his leather chair at the conference table on the plane, still wearing his Iditarod hat. He said to his staff, “Let’s get to work.”"|"The Water Will Come"|"Jeff Goodell"
"ap 01:00"|one|"On the East Coast, at least four key military bases are at risk from sea-level rise and storm surges, including Eglin Air Force Base, the largest air force base in the world, which is on the Florida Panhandle. Up in Alaska, the problems are thawing permafrost and coastal erosion that is accelerating with higher tides. The air force’s early-warning radar installations, which help the United States keep a close watch on anything lobbed our way from North Korea or Russia, have been hit particularly hard by coastal erosion. At one radar installation, forty feet of shoreline has been lost, endangering the reliability of the radar."|"The Water Will Come"|"Jeff Goodell"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"At nine the next morning, just as the next cycle of king tides was about to hit, Henry Briceño, a geologist at Florida International University, picked me up in his well-worn silver Honda Civic. The trunk was full of ice chests and plastic bottles and scientific gear. Briceño, then seventy, who was born in Venezuela and worked there as a scientist until he was run out of the country by dictator Hugo Chávez, looked like he was on his way home from the hardware store, wearing a green polo shirt with a big water stain on it, khaki pants, and beat-up hiking shoes. He was a specialist in water quality, and by the time he picked me up, he had already been working for several hours, driving around to check on teams of grad students taking water samples across Miami Beach."|"The Water Will Come"|"Jeff Goodell"
"ap ~ 06:00"|"about six"|"In the twentieth century, the oceans rose about six inches. But that was before the heat from burning fossil fuels had much impact on Greenland and Antarctica (about half of the recorded sea-level rise in the twentieth century came from the expansion of the warming oceans). Today, seas are rising at more than twice the rate they did in the last century. As warming of the Earth increases and the ice sheets begin to feel the heat, the rate of sea-level rise is likely to increase rapidly. A 2017 report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, the United States’ top climate science agency, says global sea-level rise could range from about one foot to more than eight feet by 2100. Depending on how much we heat up the planet, it will continue rising for centuries after that. Although there is still some uncertainty about these forecasts, many scientists I’ve talked to now believe that the high-end projections are likely to increase as they get a better understanding of ice dynamics. Temperature-wise, the trend lines are rising: 2016 was the hottest year on record, and as I’m writing this, the Arctic is thirty-six degrees warmer than normal."|"The Water Will Come"|"Jeff Goodell"
