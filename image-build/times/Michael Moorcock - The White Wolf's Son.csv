"~ 15:00"|"about three o’clock in the afternoon"|"I had quite a decent game running in the Castle, but by about three o’clock in the afternoon I had begun to wonder about going
         back for tea or continuing down to the river. Then I heard a sharp crack from the direction of the woods above and assumed
         that the quarry was blasting, though I hadn’t noticed the usual warning siren. When there were no further explosions, I swung
         my feet from the platform and continued on down the grassy bank from the dirt path to the river. Taking off my shoes on the
         bank, I waded into the clear water and was soon absorbed in seeking out whatever swam over the pebbles."|"The White Wolf's Son"|"Michael Moorcock"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"“Would four o’clock suit you?” Elric hoped he could get some further clue from Gaynor. The man was arrogant enough to reveal
         himself by accident."|"The White Wolf's Son"|"Michael Moorcock"
12:00|noon|"Nearby, the victorious machine descended to land. We wondered what the fight had been about. Rather than run, we thought it
         best to wait and see what would happen. The plane extended hydraulic legs and sank down onto them, for all the world like
         a settling bird. She stopped her engines and emitted a massive hiss of steam. The canopy slid back, and the crew of heavily
         suited and masked pilots and gunners climbed out. Once on the ground, they took off their masks and, shading their eyes against
         the noon sun, stood waiting for us as we approached."|"The White Wolf's Son"|"Michael Moorcock"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"With Monsieur Zodiac I watched the six o’clock news. I was growing impatient, wanting Mum and Dad, Alf and Gertie, to come
         home in the expectation that our visitor would confide more in them. I might not be allowed to stay in the sitting room, but
         Tower House’s accoustics were so good that I’d be bound to hear the important bits of whatever was said, even if I kept out
         of sight on the landing which led to my room."|"The White Wolf's Son"|"Michael Moorcock"
12:00|noon|"When Kushy still hadn’t returned by noon the next day, I became sure he was dead or captured. If they tortured him, they’d
         learn where I was. The plight of the blind albino boy was still on my mind. I couldn’t just leave him. He had asked for help.
         Taking the blanket from the cot, I left the hovel and made my way out into the creaking, tottering streets. First I must find
         food. Then I must find the Sebastocrater. At least I would be able to tell him that Klosterheim had tricked him, and maybe
         I could find and recruit Lord Renyard to help save the boy."|"The White Wolf's Son"|"Michael Moorcock"
00:00|midnight|"By midnight I had reached the black marble avenue which ran roughly from east to west with a huge Greek palace in the middle,
         at the top of which burned a massive single light, illuminating much of the city around it. From a new perspective I was looking
         at the Sebastocrater’s monolithic home."|"The White Wolf's Son"|"Michael Moorcock"
