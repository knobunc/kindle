"< 12:00"|"toward noon"|"The terrain softens, grows red...The light within the mist brightens...A new wind, from behind, a growing warmth...The air breaks apart...
Sky of pale lemon...Orange sun rushing toward noon...
A shudder! A thing not of my doing, totally unanticipated...The ground moves beneath us, but there is more to it than that. The new sky, the new sun, the rusty desert I have just now entered—all of them expand and contract, fade and return. There comes a cracking sound, and with each fading I find Star and myself alone, amid a white nothingness—characters without a setting. We tread upon nothing. The light comes from everywhere and illuminates only ourselves. A steady cracking noise, as of the spring thaw come upon a Russian river I had once ridden beside, fills my ears. Star, who has paced many shadows, emits a frightened sound."|"The Courts of Chaos"|"Roger Zelazny"
