"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"Let’s start with the title, The Friends of Eddie Coyle. Eddie Coyle has no friends. Eddie barely has acquaintances. Eddie Coyle is our hopeless, helpless, hapless Everyman in the Boston criminal underworld of 1970. He might be the worst guide ever, because he is utterly out of his depth. Or, on second thought, maybe he’s the best guide ever, because most of the people who swim in this sea are out of their depth, which is how they end up on the ten o’clock news or on a metal slab, doing ten-to-twelve on C Block, or hanging from a post office wall. In Eddie Coyle’s world, no one is out to screw anyone on purpose; it just happens that way. No one wakes up trying to do bad or put a hurt on anyone; they’re just trying to get by, and sometimes getting by means leaving a fair share of accidental wreckage in your wake. But rest assured, it’s nothing personal."|"The Friends of Eddie Coyle"|"George V. Higgins"

Then for him to call me and tell me she called. I’ll leave a number. I’ll do that before nine.

"ap 08:45"|"forty-five minutes past eight"|"Next to the door to the vault, Sam Partridge had his field of vision contracted to include only two objects. There was a small clock set into the steel door of the vault. It stood at forty-five minutes past eight. There was no second hand. The minute hand did not appear to be moving. Eighteen inches away from the clock, down two feet from its eye-level location, there was the black-gloved hand of the spokesman. It held, very steadily, a heavy revolver. Sam saw that there was some kind of a rib on the barrel, and that the handle was molded out to cover the top of the hand that held it. He saw touches of gold inside the black metal of the cylinders. The hammer of the revolver was drawn back to full cock. The minute hand did not seem to have moved."|"The Friends of Eddie Coyle"|"George V. Higgins"

“Eight-forty-eight,” Sam said absently.
In July they had taken the children to New Hampshire and rented a cottage on a palette-shaped pond north of Centerville. They had rented a boat one morning, an aluminum rowboat, with a small motor, and he had taken the children fishing while his wife slept. Around eleven they had come in because his son wanted to go to the bathroom. They beached the rowboat and the children ran up the gravel slope to the tall grass, and through the tall grass in the sunshine to the cabin. Sam had removed a string of four pickerel from the boat and placed it on the gravel. He had bent back to lift out the rods and the tackle box and the thermos of milk and the sweaters. He straightened up with the articles and turned toward where he had placed the fish."|"The Friends of Eddie Coyle"|"George V. Higgins"

About a hundred and sixty. Black hair, fairly short. Sideburns. Suede jacket. Levi’s, blue Levi’s. Brown suede boots with fringe on them.
