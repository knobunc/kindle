Amazing, in fact, that the boy hadn’t broken down even more while telling it. Would that come, or wouldn’t it? Or had it come in the night, perhaps nights before, when the boy was in London or alone at the house of Mme. Boutin, his mind in terror of an imagined judgment from somewhere? Or had the few seconds of tears, today before lunch, been enough? There were boys (and girls) aged ten or so in New York, who had witnessed murder, murdered in gangs their contemporaries or strangers, but Frank was hardly that type. Such guilt as Frank’s would show itself in some way, some time.

Tom intended to go to Fontainebleau before ten, get the tickets, and tell Heloise that it was a most urgent job for Reeves Minot, which he had learned about by telephone during the night, something like that. There was no telephone in Heloise’s room, and with her door closed, she could not hear the telephone in his room or in the living room downstairs. Awful news continued on the television set, and Tom postponed any kind of speech to Heloise."|"The Boy Who Followed Ripley"|"Patricia Highsmith"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"“Oh—I’d say in three days. Maybe Sunday, Monday.” Tom was dressed and having a second coffee and toast in the living room. “I’ll take off in a few minutes to see about the tickets. And I hope the news is good, darling, by ten.”"|"The Boy Who Followed Ripley"|"Patricia Highsmith"

Frank had won a toy bear at a throwing-game stall outside a beerhall, and Tom was now carrying the little brown bear, the symbol of Berlin. Tom had been to Romy Haag’s on his last visit to Berlin. It was a bar-disco, slightly touristy, and with a late show of transvestites."|"The Boy Who Followed Ripley"|"Patricia Highsmith"

Half-drawn glasses of beer, at least eight, stood lined up beside the beer taps, awaiting customers. The Germans took several minutes to draw a beer properly, a fact which Tom appreciated. Tom and Frank chose their food from a counter offering homemade soups, ham, roast beef and lamb, cabbage, fried or boiled potatoes, and half a dozen kinds of bread."|"The Boy Who Followed Ripley"|"Patricia Highsmith"

Was Frank taking a morning walk? Tom shrugged. Had he made himself shrug? Had it been involuntary? What if the boy ran into trouble on the street, got spoken to by some alert policeman? “May I ask your name? May I see your passport or identification?” Was there an umbilical cord between him and Frank? No. Or if so, cut it, Tom thought. It was going to be cut tomorrow, anyway, when the boy took the plane for New York.

If the kidnappers managed to seize him, they could get some more money, and Tom tried to imagine Heloise getting his ransom money together—how much, a quarter of a million?—and asking her father— Good Lord, no! Here Tom had to laugh into his pillow. Would Jacques Plisson cough up money for son-in-law Tom Ripley? Not bloody likely!

Peter said he could come to Eric’s between ten-thirty and eleven.
MAX LAID OUT his drag offerings in Eric’s living room like a salesman displaying something which would probably interest the customer, though this was the only outfit Max had brought. “This is my best one,” Max said in German, clumping around the living room in his boots and black leather gear, spreading the long gown to best advantage against himself."|"The Boy Who Followed Ripley"|"Patricia Highsmith"

There were at least ten other figures in long-dress drag, Tom noticed, but now Tom was looking around for Max. With infinite slowness, Tom extracted a cigarette from his handbag and lit it, in no hurry to catch the eye of a barman and order a drink, for the nonce. It was now a quarter past eleven, and Tom looked around—especially at the bar where it would be logical for someone to ask a barman about a Joey—but so far Tom did not see anyone who could by any stretch of the imagination be called straight, and he assumed the kidnappers were."|"The Boy Who Followed Ripley"|"Patricia Highsmith"

Gaby lived in the building with some other people who employed her, and she had insisted on coming in at seven this evening after her late shopping to “arrange” what she had bought for Reeves’s guests. “I’m lucky, she likes me,” Reeves said. “Finds my place more interesting than where she sleeps—in spite of that damned bomb here. Well, she happened to be out at the time it hit.”"|"The Boy Who Followed Ripley"|"Patricia Highsmith"
"ap > 06:00"|"just after six"|"When they got back to Reeves’s at just after six, Reeves was not home, but he had left a message in the middle of the neatly made bed in the guest room: “Back at seven or before. R.” Tom was glad Reeves was still out, because he wanted to speak with Frank alone."|"The Boy Who Followed Ripley"|"Patricia Highsmith"
"ap ~ 10:00"|"around ten"|"“Lufthansa,” said Frank, picking up the telephone directory. “What time, around ten tomorrow morning?”"|"The Boy Who Followed Ripley"|"Patricia Highsmith"
"ap 09:15"|9:15|"Reeves came in as Frank was fixing the time for tomorrow: 9:15 takeoff. Frank gave the names, Ripley and Andrews."|"The Boy Who Followed Ripley"|"Patricia Highsmith"
12:00|noon|"On the plane going to Paris, Tom noticed that Frank’s hair had grown so long, it was falling partly over his cheek where the mole was. Frank had not had a haircut since the middle of August, which was the time Tom had advised Frank to let it grow. Between noon and one o’clock, he would be delivering Frank to Thurlow and Johnny Pierson at the Lutetia. Tom had reminded Frank, last evening at Reeves’s, that he ought to see about getting a genuine passport, unless Thurlow had had the wit to bring his passport or ask his mother to send it from Maine."|"The Boy Who Followed Ripley"|"Patricia Highsmith"

"ap 04:00"|four|"A female friend, Tom noticed. “Tell her I’ll be home this afternoon, maybe around—oh, by four, I hope.

14:18|14:18|"Tom laughed, and leaned against the Wagnerian interior. Two floors down, a man and woman got on, the woman with a perfume that made Tom cringe, though perhaps it was expensive. Her yellow-and-blue striped dress certainly looked expensive, and her black patent leather pumps reminded Tom of the one, or maybe two, that he had left in the kidnappers’ flat in Berlin. A surprising find for the neighbors or the police, Tom supposed. In the lobby, Tom reclaimed their suitcases, but felt that he didn’t breathe until he was standing on the pavement, waiting for the doorman to get a taxi. One came almost at once, letting off two women, and Tom and Frank took it, bound for the Gare de Lyon. They could make the 14:18 with a few minutes to spare, which was nice, as it avoided the awful wait for the next train at 5 p.m. or so. Frank was gazing out the window with eyes at once intense and dreaming, his body stiff as a statue. In fact, Tom thought of a statue of an angel, one of the dazed but supportive figures at the sides of church doors. At the station, Tom bought first-class tickets, and a copy of Le Monde from the newsstand by the trains."|"The Boy Who Followed Ripley"|"Patricia Highsmith"

"ap ~ 08:00"|"Around eight"|"Around eight, Tom called Frank down for dinner, and opened two beers for them. Frank had not been asleep, but Tom hoped he had had a nap. Tom caught up on Heloise’s family news: her mother was quite all right now, no operation necessary, but the doctor had put her on a regime of no salt and no fats, the time-honored French prescription, Tom thought, when the doctor didn’t know what else to say or do. Heloise said she had rung up her family that afternoon to say she would not have her usual date with them tonight, because Tom had just come back."|"The Boy Who Followed Ripley"|"Patricia Highsmith"
"ap 00:45"|"twelve forty-five"|"“I have reservations for a twelve forty-five takeoff from Roissy tomorrow,” Thurlow said. “Can you see that Frank makes that? Is he there? I’d like to speak with him.”"|"The Boy Who Followed Ripley"|"Patricia Highsmith"

Heloise’s present, the blue handbag, was on his desk now, still in its white plastic bag. It was in a box, and Tom decided to smuggle the box to her room some time tomorrow morning, so that she would find it after he had gone. Five past eleven now. Tom went downstairs to ring Thurlow, even though there was a telephone in his room."|"The Boy Who Followed Ripley"|"Patricia Highsmith"
"ap ~ 10:00"|"around ten"|"“His wishes, yes.”
“Okay, Tom. I’ll see you tomorrow around ten then.”
Tom took another warm shower, and looked forward to sleeping. Just that morning he had been in Hamburg, and what was dear old Reeves doing at this moment? Making another deal with someone over cool white wine in his apartment? Tom decided to leave all his packing until the morning."|"The Boy Who Followed Ripley"|"Patricia Highsmith"
"ap ~ 07:00"|"about seven"|"In bed and with the light out, Tom found himself pondering the generation gap, or trying to. Didn’t it turn up in every generation? And didn’t generations overlap, so that one could never point out a definite twenty-five year period of change? Tom tried to imagine what it was like for Frank to have been born when the Beatles were getting started in London (after Hamburg), then making their American tour, and changing the face of pop songs, to have been about seven when a man landed on the moon, when the United Nations as a peacekeeping organization was beginning to be laughed at and to be used. And before that, the League of Nations, hadn’t it been? Ancient history, the League of Nations, which had failed to stop Franco and Hitler. Every generation seemed to have to turn loose of something, and then try desperately to find something new to hang onto. Now for the young it was gurus sometimes, or Hare Krishna, or the cult called the Moonies, and pop music all the time—social protesters sang to their souls sometimes. Falling in love, however, was out of date, Tom had heard or read somewhere, but he had not heard it from Frank. Frank was perhaps exceptional in even admitting that he was in love. “Play it cool, no strong emotions” was the tenet of youth. A lot of young people didn’t believe in marriage, just in living together and having children sometimes."|"The Boy Who Followed Ripley"|"Patricia Highsmith"
"ap > 09:00"|"a little after nine"|"Tom could not buy a France-Dimanche, the gossip sheet, at the Moret station, but it was the first thing he did when they arrived at the Gare de Lyon. It was only a little after nine, and Tom paused in the station to give the paper a look. He found Frank Pierson on page two, with the familiar old passport picture in one column instead of spread over two or more. MISSING AMERICAN HEIR WAS ON HOLIDAY IN GERMANY said the headline. Tom looked through the column, worried about finding his own name, but it was not there. Had Ralph Thurlow finally done a commendable piece of work? Tom felt relieved."|"The Boy Who Followed Ripley"|"Patricia Highsmith"
12:00|noon|"“Not quite sure, sir. Sounded as if she might’ve had a slight heart attack. I know they sent for the doctor. This was at noon today. Your mother telephoned. I drove down yesterday with her and we stayed the night at the apartment. She wanted to meet you in New York.” Eugene smiled. “I’ll just go get the car. Back in two minutes.”"|"The Boy Who Followed Ripley"|"Patricia Highsmith"
"ap > 05:00"|"just after five"|"Tom ordered a beer and a cheese sandwich on rye. It was now just after five, and the trip was going to take about three hours, someone had said. Thurlow sat beside Eugene in seats nearer the pilot. Tom looked out of his window and watched New York drop below them."|"The Boy Who Followed Ripley"|"Patricia Highsmith"
"~ 02:00"|"about two in the morning"|"Frank sank himself in another book, one he had taken from his room. Tom tried to snooze. It seemed the best thing to do, in view of the fact they all might be up late tonight. For Tom, Frank, and Thurlow, also Johnny, it was about two in the morning. Thurlow was already asleep, Tom saw."|"The Boy Who Followed Ripley"|"Patricia Highsmith"
"ap 06:00"|six|"This was the friend Lily liked, according to Frank. Lily was saying that Tal had work this afternoon, so probably couldn’t arrive until six. “And I have to see about taking off,” Tom said. “I thought of staying a day or so in New York.”"|"The Boy Who Followed Ripley"|"Patricia Highsmith"
"ap 04:00"|four|"From his room Tom telephoned the Hotel Chelsea in Manhattan, and asked if they had a single room for that night. A friendly voice said they could probably manage it with a little bit of Irish luck. That was good enough. Tom thought he should take his leave after lunch. Some neighbors called the Hunters were coming at four, Lily had said, because they were very fond of Frank and wanted to see him. Tom supposed that the Pierson household could get him some kind of transportation to Bangor, whence he could take a plane to New York."|"The Boy Who Followed Ripley"|"Patricia Highsmith"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"Johnny devoted himself to his food, and said only something to his mother about a girl called Christine possibly coming at seven, and he didn’t know whether they would go somewhere for dinner or stay in."|"The Boy Who Followed Ripley"|"Patricia Highsmith"
"ap 03:00"|three|"By three, Tom had made his arrangements, reserved a place on an early evening flight from Bangor to Kennedy Airport, and Eugene would drive him to Bangor. Tom packed his suitcase but did not close it. He went into the hall and tapped on Frank’s slightly open door. There was no answer. Tom pushed the door wider and went in. The room was empty and tidy, the bed probably having been made by Evangelina. On Frank’s desk sat the Berlin bear, some twelve inches high, its beady brown eyes ringed with yellow, its mouth jolly though closed. Tom remembered Frank’s amusement at the handwritten sign: 3 WÜRFE 1 MARK. Frank had thought Würfe a funny word for throws, because it sounded like something to eat, or maybe a dog’s bark. How had the little bear survived a kidnapping, a murder, a couple of airplane trips, and come out looking as fluffy and cheerful as ever? Tom had wanted to ask Frank to join him for another walk to the cliff. Tom had the feeling that if he could get the boy used to the cliff, though “used” wasn’t quite the right word for it, Frank’s guilt might be diminished."|"The Boy Who Followed Ripley"|"Patricia Highsmith"
"ap 04:15"|"quarter past four"|"“Around five.” Tom saw by his wristwatch that it was a quarter past four. “I don’t feel like saying good-bye to Susie,” Tom said."|"The Boy Who Followed Ripley"|"Patricia Highsmith"
"ap < 05:00"|"nearly five"|"Frank was not in the room. The gramophone cover was off, with a record on it, but the machine was not turning. Tom saw that it was the Lou Reed Transformer, the second side, which Heloise had put on at Belle Ombre. Tom glanced at his watch: nearly five, and he and Eugene were supposed to leave at five. Probably Eugene was downstairs at the back of the house where the servants’ quarters seemed to be."|"The Boy Who Followed Ripley"|"Patricia Highsmith"

00:00|midnight|"He arrived at the Hotel Chelsea by midnight. People were singing in the lobby, which had a square fireplace and black-and-white plastic sofas, chained to the floor against theft. The lyric was a limerick, Tom recognized, and amid much laughter the Levi’s-clad boys and a few girls were trying to fit it to guitar music. Yes, there was a room for Mr. Ripley, said the tweedy man behind the desk. Tom glanced at the oil paintings on the walls, some donated by clients who couldn’t pay their bills, Tom knew. He had a general impression of tomato red. Then he went up in an old-fashioned elevator."|"The Boy Who Followed Ripley"|"Patricia Highsmith"
"< 02:00"|"nearly two in the morning"|"He went into a corner snack shop which had stools at a counter, and ordered a hamburger and a coffee. He did not want to sit down, and standing up was certainly permitted. Two black customers were having an argument over a bet they had made, over the possible crookedness of the bookie they had both used. It sounded fantastically complicated, and Tom stopped listening. He could ring up a couple of friends in New York tomorrow, he thought, just to say hello. The idea, however, did not attract him. He felt lost and purposeless, awful. He ate half the hamburger, drank half of the weak coffee, paid, and went out, and walked up to Forty-second Street. Now it was nearly two in the morning."|"The Boy Who Followed Ripley"|"Patricia Highsmith"
"~ 09:00"|"around nine in the morning"|"Tom thought of ringing Heloise, since it would be around nine in the morning there, and didn’t. He realized that he was shattered. Shattered. And how had he escaped a punch in the ribs from the sailors in that bar? Tom realized that he had been lucky once again. He fell into bed, not caring when he woke up."|"The Boy Who Followed Ripley"|"Patricia Highsmith"
21:00|"9 p.m."|"Only by 9 p.m. the next evening did Tom regain some kind of composure, a sense of returning to himself. The engines had started on the airplane, and he seemed suddenly to wake up, as if he were home already. He felt happy, or happier, and he was escaping from—what? He had acquired another suitcase, at Mark Cross this time, as Gucci had become so ultra snob, Tom was inclined to boycott it, and the new suitcase was full of things he had bought: a sweater for Heloise, an art book from Doubleday’s, a blue-and-white striped apron for Mme. Annette with a red pocket on which was printed OUT TO LUNCH, plus a small gold pin, also for Mme. Annette because her birthday was soon, the pin in the shape of a flying goose with little spiked reeds of gold below, a good-looking passport case for Eric Lanz. Tom had not forgotten Peter in Berlin. He would look for something special for him in Paris. Tom watched Manhattan’s fairyland of lights gently rising and falling with the plane’s movement, and he thought of Frank being buried soon in the same body of land. When the American coast was out of sight, Tom closed his eyes and tried to fall asleep. But he kept thinking of Frank, and finding it hard to believe that the boy was dead. It was a fact, and yet that fact was something that Tom could not make real as yet. He had thought sleep would be a help, but he had awakened this morning with the same sense of fantasy about Frank’s death—as if he might look now across the plane’s aisle and see Frank sitting there, smiling at him, surprising him. Tom had to remember the white sheet over the stretcher. No intern would pull a sheet all the way over someone’s head, unless the person beneath was dead."|"The Boy Who Followed Ripley"|"Patricia Highsmith"
"ap 00:30"|twelve-thirty|"She couldn’t believe that he was at Charles de Gaulle Airport, and he couldn’t believe that she was so close. “I can be in Moret at twelve-thirty easily. I just looked it up.” Tom was suddenly smiling. “Everything okay?”"|"The Boy Who Followed Ripley"|"Patricia Highsmith"
"ap 00:31"|"Twelve thirty-one"|"“I was there such a short time!” Tom replied. “Just two days! I’ll tell you about it when I see you. Twelve thirty-one.”"|"The Boy Who Followed Ripley"|"Patricia Highsmith"
