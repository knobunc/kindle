        overslept again and it was almost noon. After a quick breakfast, I hurried down to the 
        paper."|"The Rum Diary"|"Hunter S. Thompson"
"ap < 11:30"|"almost eleven-thirty"|"I looked at my watch. It was almost eleven-thirty. “Where's the scooter?” I asked."|"The Rum Diary"|"Hunter S. Thompson"
"ap 09:30"|nine-thirty|"Yeamon stared after it. “Is that the last one?”
“Yep,” I replied. “Next flight's at nine-thirty tomorrow morning.”
After a pause he said, “Well, I guess we should head back.”"|"The Rum Diary"|"Hunter S. Thompson"
"ap < 01:30"|"almost one-thirty"|"It was almost one-thirty when we came to the end of the highway and turned off to 
        Fajardo. The town was dark and there wasn't a soul on the streets. We rounded the empty 
        plaza and drove down toward the ferry dock. There was a small hotel about a block away and 
        I stopped in front of it while he went in to get a room."|"The Rum Diary"|"Hunter S. Thompson"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"In a few minutes he came out and got into the car. “Well,” he said quietly, “I'm okay. 
        The ferry leaves at eight.”"|"The Rum Diary"|"Hunter S. Thompson"
"ap 11:30"|eleven-thirty|"At eleven-thirty I caught a bus in front of the hotel. It was crowded and I had to stand. 
        The air in the bus was like steam, but no one else seemed to mind. Every window was 
        closed, the smell was unbearable, and by the time we got to the Plaza Colon I was dizzy 
        and soaked with sweat."|"The Rum Diary"|"Hunter S. Thompson"
00:00|midnight|"Moberg said nothing. He looked sick enough to be in a hospital. I later learned that he'd 
        come into the newsroom at midnight, raving drunk, and pissed on the teletype machine. On 
        top of that, we'd been scooped on a waterfront stabbing and Moberg had the police beat. 
        Lotterman cursed him again, then turned on Sala, who had just come in. “Where were you 
        last night, Sala? Why don't we have any pictures of this stabbing?”"|"The Rum Diary"|"Hunter S. Thompson"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"Sala looked surprised. “What the hell? I finished at eight -- you expect me to work 
        twenty-four hours a day?”"|"The Rum Diary"|"Hunter S. Thompson"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"I spent the rest of the day in the library, and left at eight. On my way out of the 
        building I met Sala coming in. “What are you doing tonight?” he asked."|"The Rum Diary"|"Hunter S. Thompson"
"ap 07:30"|seven-thirty|"I spent the rest of the day doing rewrites. Just as I was leaving, Tyrrell called me over 
        and said I had an early assignment at the airport the next morning. The mayor of Miami was 
        coming in on the seven-thirty flight and I had to be there for an interview. Rather than 
        take a cab, I decided to borrow Sala's car."|"The Rum Diary"|"Hunter S. Thompson"
00:00|midnight|"It turned out to be an excellent evening. The couple from New York reminded me of 
        something I had not seen in a long time. We talked of yachts, which I knew because I had 
        worked on them in Europe, and which they knew because they came from a world where 
        everyone seemed to own one. We drank white rum, which Sanderson said was much better than 
        gin, and by midnight we were all drunk enough to go down to the beach for a naked swim."|"The Rum Diary"|"Hunter S. Thompson"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"After living there a week I'd established a fairly strict routine. I would sleep until 
        ten or so, depending on the noise level in the street, then take a shower and walk up to 
        Al's for breakfast. With a few exceptions, the normal workday at the paper was from noon 
        until eight in the evening, give or take a few hours either way. Then we would come back 
        to Al's for dinner. After that it was the casinos, an occasional party, or simply sitting 
        at Al's and listening to each other's stories until we all got drunk and mumbled off to 
        our beds. Sometimes I would go to Sanderson's and usually there were people there to drink 
        with. Except for Segarra and the wretched greedhead Zimburger, almost everyone at 
        Sanderson's was from New York or Miami or the Virgin Islands. They were buyers or builders 
        or sellers in one way or another, and now that I look back on it I don't recall a single 
        name or face out of the hundred or so that I met there. Not a distinctive soul in the lot, 
        but it was a pleasant, social kind of atmosphere and a welcome break from those dreary 
        nights at Al's."|"The Rum Diary"|"Hunter S. Thompson"

"ap < 06:00"|"just about six"|"About six hours later, I found out that it did make a difference, although not in the way 
        I had meant. After breakfast I walked with Chenault to the bank, then I went to work. It 
        was just about six when Yeamon came back from wherever he had been all afternoon. I 
        nodded to him, then watched with mild curiosity as Lotterman called him over to the desk. 
        “I want to talk to you about that emigration story,” he said. “Just what in hell are you 
        trying to put over on me?”"|"The Rum Diary"|"Hunter S. Thompson"
