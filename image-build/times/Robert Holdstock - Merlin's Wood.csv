"ap 01:00"|one|"Four days after the interment, Martin dressed warmly against the chill weather and walked through the drizzle up the path to the cemetery. He had had a restless night, waking at one point to the sound of movement downstairs. Half dreaming, half alert, he had imagined that someone was prowling about the house, at one point even entering the bedroom where he lay. Indeed, in the morning he found the back door swinging free, and the signs of sandwich-making. Not knowing his mother’s routine, nor lifestyle, he was not unduly concerned by this intrusion."|"Merlin's Wood"|"Robert Holdstock"
00:00|midnight|"When I first arrived in your home, I didn’t believe in the people on the path. I thought you were all crazy, dancing around at midnight, describing thin air as if there were human figures in it. I used to watch you from the garden. I was watching you the night Seb danced into the frightened people, the week before he died. You thought I was in bed asleep, but I never slept in the middle night; I was too frightened. There were too many prowlings and breathings, too many noises, and I was new to the house, and my new father still scared me a bit, even though I had no reason to be frightened."|"Merlin's Wood"|"Robert Holdstock"
09:00|9am|"There was a note from her, discarded on the sideboard. It read, ‘Hi early riser! 9am. Gone to Vannes for clothes food hair a few special little things. No idea how long I’ll be. Hope you’re having fun.’"|"Merlin's Wood"|"Robert Holdstock"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"It was after midnight before Rebecca crept into bed. She was naked and bitterly cold. She pressed her feet against the complaining man, warming her hands on his stomach, laughing as Martin struggled. They soon relaxed below the covers and eventually turned to face each other, kissing gently, savouring the fumes of garlic and cider."|"Merlin's Wood"|"Robert Holdstock"
"> 22:00"|"after ten at night"|"It was after ten at night before he arrived back at Broceliande. He was surprised to find Jacques sitting, half-dozing by the wood stove, the television tuned to a riotously unfunny gameshow."|"Merlin's Wood"|"Robert Holdstock"
"ap ~ 09:00"|"about nine o’clock"|"‘I’m not sure. She was upset about something. Asked me to come and look after Daniel. I’ll be off, now, if you don’t mind. It’s been longer than I expected. That’s not a complaint,’ he added hastily. ‘Any time. You know that. It’s just that my joints, these days, do seem to like bed by about nine o’clock. Goodnight, Martin.’"|"Merlin's Wood"|"Robert Holdstock"
00:00|midnight|"Rebecca came home at midnight. She was dishevelled and distressed, the hem of her skirt filthy, her boots caked with mud. There was moisture on her greying hair, and apple blossom, which Martin picked away."|"Merlin's Wood"|"Robert Holdstock"
12:00|midday|"With four days to Christmas, the church bell intoned the dawn hour to signal Winter’s Deep. From all over the region, people came by car and cart to the church on the hill, arriving for midday, wrapped well against the frost. The sky was brilliant azure, the sun low to the south and west. The forest of Broceliande glistened whitely. Breath hung in the air, streamers of mist behind each walking human shape. When noon came, the congregation, spread around the base of the hill, joined hands. Daniel, between his parents, laughed as the whole circle stepped carefully, with many a collapse, many a trip, much humour, once around the hill, while the priest lit the fire at the porch entrance and the flame streamed high into the crisp day."|"Merlin's Wood"|"Robert Holdstock"

"~ 04:00"|"about four in the morning"|"At about four in the morning, as the storm abated slightly, Martin woke from a deep, disturbed sleep. He was sprawled on a blanket, by the still-warm stove, using a cushion as a pillow. He became aware of someone crouching by him, a hand on his back, and he turned over quickly, looked up to see Rebecca, dimly lit by the night-light in the hall. She was wet around the eyes and lips, feeling blindly in the dark. When he reached for her she grasped for him and twisted below him, murmuring sounds."|"Merlin's Wood"|"Robert Holdstock"
"> 12:00"|"after midday"|"She screeched with indignation, fleeing from her bedroom into the small sitting room. By the dock on the mantelpiece she learned that it was after midday. She had slept … she had slept fifteen hours!"|"Merlin's Wood"|"Robert Holdstock"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"The bells, the hammering of sticks, the whine of the violin, the Jack Tar sound of the accordion.
And at ten o’clock the whole wild dance stopped.
Silence."|"Merlin's Wood"|"Robert Holdstock"
00:00|midnight|"Thomas, confused by the strange midnight encounter, shivered in his clothing. ‘Last night. I’ve always seen and smelled them.’"|"Merlin's Wood"|"Robert Holdstock"
00:00|midnight|"Why did the fire, in this midnight forest, call to him so much? Why was there such comfort in the thought of the warm glow from the piled branches, and the noisy prattle, and laughter, of those who clustered in its shadowy light? He had danced about a fire often enough: on May eve, at the passing of the day of All Hallows. But those fires were in the village bounds. His soul fluttered, a delighted bird, at the thought of the woodland fire. The smell of autumn, the touch of night’s dew, the closeness to the souls of tree and plant; timeless eyes would watch the dancers. They were a shared life with the forest."|"Merlin's Wood"|"Robert Holdstock"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"The sound of his sons’ excited shouting woke Huxley abruptly at three in the morning. His breath frosting in the freezing room, he shivered his way into his dressing gown, tugged on slippers, and walked darkly and swiftly to the boys’ room."|"Merlin's Wood"|"Robert Holdstock"
"ap 07:30"|"seven thirty"|"He kept this second log hidden behind the bookcase where his journals were shelved. He placed the book there now, then tugged on his Wellington boots and overcoat. It was just after dawn, seven thirty or so, and he was aware of two things: the odd silence of the day outside (no clamour from the chicken house), and the second set of tracks through the snow."|"Merlin's Wood"|"Robert Holdstock"
00:00|midnight|"‘You came home at midnight,’ she said, a smile touching her pale features. She closed the book, keeping a finger at the page. ‘You went out again before dawn.’"|"Merlin's Wood"|"Robert Holdstock"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"At eleven o’clock Jennifer announced that she was retiring for the night, and as she walked past him paused, held out her hand. ‘Are you coming?’"|"Merlin's Wood"|"Robert Holdstock"
00:00|midnight|"He went through their drawers, where clothes were crushed and crumpled, apple-cores rotted, penny dreadfuls were concealed, and rock hard ends of sandwiches – made for midnight feasts – nestled side by side with pictures torn from magazines."|"Merlin's Wood"|"Robert Holdstock"
