Maybe they didn’t rape my mother, maybe they just hit her, or use something to mess with her pussy and then have him watch them do it. Maybe they said no bitch you too old fi fuck, that deh pussy for Jesus now. Or maybe this is just me at near midnight, standing here in stupid high heels, my feet killing me because I spent all day killing my feet. And all I can do is listen to my mind go crazy. The son of a bitch didn’t come out once. Not even once. Maybe I have it wrong. Maybe I was memorable, too memorable, and he saw me from a window and sent a message not to let that girl in. Maybe I was a lousy lay or too good a lay, something about me that said to him, Boy, you better stay inside and don’t get involved with that one, that Nina Burgess. Maybe he even remembered my name. Or maybe not. My heels and my feet are covered in dust."|"A Brief History of Seven Killings"|"Marlon James"

Men maybe. Men change at eleven when there’s some defenceless woman around. Part of me is thinking that is bullshit and maybe I just need something to get frightened over. My high school teacher used to warn us not to dress like sluts and fear rape all the time. We wrote a note in left-hand writing with crayon one day and slipped it in her desk drawer. It was months before she found it and read, As if even a blind man would rape—before she realized she was reading out loud."|"A Brief History of Seven Killings"|"Marlon James"

I don’t know how long I’ve been skipping, but I can hear my feet tap tap tapping and my head decides to laugh at how stupid I must look and Wee Willie Winkle runs through the town, Upstairs, downstairs, in his nightgown jumps into my head and stays there. Tapping at the window, crying through the lock, Are the children in their beds? It’s now eight o’clock! Wee willie—cho r’asscloth."|"A Brief History of Seven Killings"|"Marlon James"

I do, and there are other things I’ll do too if only you’ll get some ice. I run out naked, and giggling, it’s five in the morning. Tiptoe down the corridor like Wee Willie Winkle. The dead have a smell but so does the killer. My death took two, one to demand it and the other to make it so. Before I flew over the banister there was lemongrass and wet dirt, the crunch of a footstep on floors clean as mirrors."|"A Brief History of Seven Killings"|"Marlon James"

"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"So they stop the car. I don’t bother to say I need to get home. I know what they are thinking. Any woman walking with one shoe on Hope Road after midnight couldn’t possibly need to get anywhere. Maybe this election was called a little too quick. Maybe communism isn’t so bad, I hear there is no such thing as a sick Cuban or a Cuban with bad teeth. And maybe it’s a sign that we getting sophisticated or something that every now and then the news is read in Spanish. I don’t know. I don’t know anything except that even I am getting bored waiting on these police to leave me in a ditch somewhere. I wish I was afraid. A part of me knows that I am supposed to be afraid and wishes it; after all, what does it say about the kind of woman I am if I’m not? They are both leaning on the car, blocking my door. I could get out on the other side right now and run, but I don’t. Maybe they are not going to rape me. Maybe they are going to do something and that thing, good or bad, maybe even good, sure beats the nothing that I have been doing all day and all night. This is morning though. This is his fault, his security guard’s fault, this whole goddamn peace concert’s fault. The country. God. Whatever beyond God, goddamn I wish they would get over with it already."|"A Brief History of Seven Killings"|"Marlon James"

More than five minutes. They’re not just quiet with me, but with each other, like what I said took away anything they would want to say to each other or to me. I don’t say sorry, after all what was a woman to think when two strange men drive her to some place she doesn’t know and didn’t ask to go? At midnight where all she can do is hope that when she scream the dark don’t suck it out."|"A Brief History of Seven Killings"|"Marlon James"

"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"I open the slide door and let traffic in. The problem with New Kingston is that reggae is too far away. I never had this problem when I stayed downtown where music, some jam session or some concert, always bubbled up. But damn brother, this is 1976, almost 1977. People from the embassy who I don’t even know started telling me to not go below Crossroads after a certain time, people who’ve lived here for five years, and yet still sweat before noon. You can’t trust somebody who tells you how much they loved your column about The Moody Blues. I’ve never written any column about The Moody fucking Blues.

He took me to the Turntable Club up Red Hills Road, another one of those streets that the hotel concierge gives a strict time limit on how long a person of caucasoid extraction (her words, not mine, swear to God) should consider himself safe. We passed a line of boys roasting chicken in oil drums with the smoke hazing straight across the road. Men and women sitting in cars, standing by the roadside, eating pan chicken and soft white bread, closing their eyes with big grins, as if nobody should be getting this kind of bliss at three in the morning. Seems nobody here heard there’s a curfew. Funny that we should end up at the Turntable Club because the last time I was here I was trailing Mick Jagger. Dude was going batshit crazy over all the stone-ass foxes in the club and all his favourite colour, black. The driver asks me if I’ve ever been to Turntable and as much as I don’t want to be a smartass, I hate when they think I’m just some ignorant cracker."|"A Brief History of Seven Killings"|"Marlon James"

I want to go back to Hope Road to just stand there by the gate and scream and scream and scream until he either opens the gate or calls the police. And if he calls the police I’ll just spend the night in jail and come back out and scream and scream again. He’s going to help me, damn it, because if I could help myself I wouldn’t give a fuck about him and his “Midnight Ravers” song either. And he’s going to give me money, enough money so that I would shut the fuck up, enough money that I can go to the U.S. Embassy through the back door and leave with three visas because Kimmy won’t want one and fuck her. Fuck her. Fuck her. Fuck her. There’s at least ten more years stuck in the back of my mouth that I’m finally letting out and fuck all who don’t care.

But don’t fucking act like half the stuff you wrote about you didn’t fucking cause. At least I didn’t pick up his shitty technique for bugging a place. He’s probably still joking in whichever country will have him about that time in Ecuador, when the Villa Hilda Hotel maids walked in on him on top of that dinner table trying to bug Manuel Araujo.

The line has been lapping around the entire block ever since Pan Am suspended services between Kingston and the mainland. Weak gesture right on the same level as Jamaica’s women vowing to hold back their sexual services until the government made concrete changes.

I watch him wobbling to the side of the pool, wanting to cry so bad, his mouth twisting into it and he’s huffing through his nose, but he looks around and sees me. Bad enough to cry while a stranger watches, but there’s no way the little fat fuck is going to cry in front of his brother. I want to laugh at the little motherfucker but figure he should catch a break. Besides, I’m here waiting on this prick, thinking about what happened thirty minutes ago. Eleven a.m. December 3, 1976. The exact half hour I got fired from Rolling Stone. At least I think I was fired. It was like this. I got a phone call."|"A Brief History of Seven Killings"|"Marlon James"

Somewhere in the U.S. with a wife by now or at least a girlfriend who knows where he’s coming from and who didn’t give a moment’s pause the first time he brought up oral sex. He must be married by now. I don’t know what that means, the man that got away. One time I was cleaning up my parents’ house because they went on a trip and I thought to surprise them. I’m arranging my father’s fishing equipment in the back room when his tackle box fell. Inside it was a letter he wrote in red ink on yellow legal paper. It took me thirty years to write this letter, that’s how he started it. The woman that got away is what I was thinking.

She behaving like the little girl in the house. She didn’t say a thing to me and I certainly wasn’t about to say anything to her, even though I had to bite my lip to not ask if Ras Trent deh ’pon the premises. She opened the door looking away the whole time, as if she was only letting in a cool breeze. She can kiss me ass, is what me thinking. And it’s getting easier and easier to think it.

Still, he’s got balls of a brass monkey telling all these Jamaicans to go fuck themselves when they honked at him. Me, I just sunk in the seat, half not wanting anybody to see me in a car with Mark Lansing—not that anybody would recognize me—and half hoping that if anybody shoots the slug will hit him first.

The driver’s pissed, glancing behind him and then at her, then at me, then driving off. Only when he’s driving off do I realize he’s heading off into serious darkness. Headlights roll past on the street. I forgot that it’s past eight. They’ve turned on lights on the second floor. The gate closes. I’m kinda sure that I’ve been waiting outside this gate forty-five minutes now but honestly I’ve lost count. Do you know where my friend is? I say to empty space.

I haven’t run track since high school so why would I need them? At some point I stopped running from my parents’ house, maybe when I ran out in the road and that first car slammed the brakes and told me about me bombocloth.

But leave it to providence, sooner or later in the stretch of a day some man will remind you. My heart is pumping again. Pumping hard. That might be because I can finally see Hope Road. Cars and buses cut across my view, east to west, west to east. I’m running again. Hope Road can’t hit and run me fast enough. I don’t know why, but I just have to run, I have to run now. Maybe his car is driving out, maybe he’s set to go to Buff Bay, maybe somebody coming to see him and will take up his time, maybe he just finished rehearsing “Midnight Ravers” and is finally, finally remembering what I look like. I just have to get there now. That one year running track did not come back and it’s my lungs that feel like it’s going to burst, not my heart. But I can’t stop, I almost run into Hope Road, making a sharp right and going still. Your mother and father won’t want it, another me is saying and it’s slowing me down. Fuck her.

They say he coming, they say it right there on the wall, that poster with the Singer pointing to the sky, Smile Jamaica a public concert, Sunday December 5 at five p.m. He beat death like Lazarus, like Jesus. People in the park talking, already people coming, walking right past me, the madman on the bench, and saying that they hope police going deal with me so that decent people don’t have to abide by no stinking madman. They come from early in the morning, people waiting for him. I blink and see them running in and out of the people and coming for me. They look like babies but one have three eyes and one have teeth so long they hang out of it mouth and one have two eye but no mouth and one have bat wings. Last night after me get ’way from Josey Wales somebody start chase me again. They chase me all the way up Duke Street to the park. No, last night me catch a sleep ’pon the railroad tracks. No, last night me did fall asleep in the Garbagelands because Josey Wales was shooting at me and me only wake up because somebody set my heap on fire. I don’t know if this is two nights since I shoot him or one. But the newspaper wouldn’t take two days to tell the world that the Singer get shot and live. That not even gunman can silence him.

Coming home in the sun, three p.m., Montego Bay feels like Miami, you never been to Miami, Kim Clarke. But still, coming home, going home I hope Chuck isn’t there. That was harsh.

Just because you don’t sleep doesn’t mean you don’t dream, there’s something my mother never told me. Last night I could have killed a kid. There was this gate and it was just some rusty gate but I knew I had to get through it. The only way forward is through. Who said that? I had to get through it, if I didn’t I would die, get cut open, sliced with a knife from the neck right down to labia with me screaming all the time, I just had to get through the fucking gate. And there was this kid at the gate, one of those children you see in movies where you can’t tell if it’s a boy or a girl. Maybe he was white but white like linen not skin. And the whole time I could see the white alarm clock about to hit two a.m. and the four walls around me, two glass windows, even the sky outside, but I could also see the gate, and I could hear Chuck snoring but I could also see the kid and I could look down and see slashed-up flesh where my feet was supposed to be. I had run my feet off. And I wanted to go through the gate and this kid was blocking it with this look, not threatening but confident, smarmy, cocky—Chuck would have said cocky. And I took this knife that I had and grabbed him by the hair and lifted him up and drove the knife in his heart and because the blood was blue I didn’t feel bad about stabbing him again and again and every time the knife went through his skin it’s like his flesh was too tough and the knife bent in a different direction than where I aimed and the kid was screaming and laughing and screaming and the only thing to do was pull out the knife and saw his head off and throw it away. And scream as I ran to the gate. Then I woke up. But I wasn’t asleep."|"A Brief History of Seven Killings"|"Marlon James"

Ignore the firecrackers even though this is way too early in December for firecrackers. Look at the man, face already going dark in the eight o’clock but coming towards you and you can’t move. He’s looking at you, undressing you, auditioning you. Listen to screams coming from the back and police siren coming from up the road and the gun right in front of your face. Once you started running you never stopped. You packed a purple suitcase and ran away from December 3, 1976, because fuck that day that the Lord had made and everything was terrible in it. You think you’re going to run to America, but the man has already worked out right down to the last rent cheque how he will soon run away from you. And this man, the man in the photo.

The men were all Wang Gang or ex–Wang Gang members and associates who infiltrated the Green Bay JDF training range where they opened fire on the few soldiers who were there that morning for target practice. Maybe they had planned revenge to get back at them for patrolling their community with too much heavy manners. Or maybe they heard there was a lightly guarded arsenal of new weapons for the taking.

He noticed that I stared too long and he wasn’t about to forget that I cut my own question in half. Jamaicans have a way of looking at you when they finally dig that you’re the kind of white boy who catches on quick. They hold the look too, because then they’re wondering for just how long have you been catching on and have they been saying too much.

A man and a woman run to they house but Josey follow close and clip the two right by they door. Man open fire and shoot up all playing domino, two man try to run but got trap in the bullet dance. Woman grabbing pickney and running. The posse run from house to house, fence to fence, sticking they hand over the zinc and ratatatat. Where the men be? Nineteen gunmen run and fire, people running mad like ants. Josey Wales walk, he never run. He see a target, consider it, walk up slow and kill. Posse men mark a pattern in the zinc with bullet. Somebody shoot a pickney. The woman screaming too loud and bawling too long so Josey walk up to her and put the gun right the back of her head. Josey and the posse draw away from Rema, twelve people dead. Police draw down on Copenhagen City and take away two gun, but that is all. Nobody can touch the don."|"A Brief History of Seven Killings"|"Marlon James"
19:49|"Nineteen forty-nine"|"You know something though? Balaclava never did so bad depending on where you lived or who you live with. It’s not like every day some baby dead or some people get their face eaten off by rats or anything. I mean, things wasn’t good. Wasn’t good at all. But still me can remember certain morning just going out and laying down in the grass, just pure green grass, and watch hummingbird and butterfly dance over me. Nineteen forty-nine me born. I always feel that when my mother give birth she was already on her way to England and just throw me off the ship. Don’t care so much that both Daddy and Mummy check out, but why them have to leave me with this half-coolie face? Even my Rasta brethren laugh ’bout it, saying when the Black Star Liner finally come to take us to Africa, they going have to chop me in half. Man, what you know about the Jamaica runnings? Sometimes I think being a half coolie worse than being a battyman. This brown skin girl look ’pon me one time and say how it sad that after all God go through to give me pretty hair him curse me with that skin. The bitch say to me all my dark skin do is remind her that me forefather was a slave. So me say me have pity for you too. Because all your light skin do is remind me that your great-great-grandmother get rape. Anyway, Balaclava."|"A Brief History of Seven Killings"|"Marlon James"
"ap 09:10"|nine-ten|"Dig this, I was back in Chicago, after promising a few goons I would never come back, because this last rubout, five years ago, was kind of a mess. This made man from Southside that grew into a bloated check that the mob wanted cashed. Picked up the tab at Denny’s and talked business. They said how’s about five hundred bucks and you and your broski Paco rub out this dude named Eustace. Eustace? Him some kinda faggot? Paco said. Mob guy didn’t answer. It was simple enough: At nine-ten on Tuesdays his wife stepped out for choir practice while he sat down with his own projector, in the basement, cigar in one hand dick in the other, while he jacked himself silly to Cherry Poppers 1–4. Paco bailed because he said he’s a thief, not a killer. Made it halfway down the basement before the guy heard me, but with one hand on his johnson and the other way up somewhere most men don’t think about, there was no hand to draw for the gun. I couldn’t stop shooting. The noise was so loud at first I didn’t hear the wife screaming. She ran away and I ran after, praying she did not reach the door. She reached the door and ran out screaming. So there we were, running down Martin Street, she in her nightie and bunny slippers screaming like her throat half cut, me behind her. Popped her off in the middle of the road, just as two station wagons passed. One stopped so I fired into the rear windshield and kept firing until they drove off and crashed into a tree seventy yards or so. With shit done I had to leave Chicago."|"A Brief History of Seven Killings"|"Marlon James"

Two floors and an attic. I’ve been picking locks since I was seven. The real trick was the steps, I was hoping they had all that tacky fur shit, which would mask any creaks. They didn’t give me any details, like how many rooms were in the house, so I had to do this the hard way."|"A Brief History of Seven Killings"|"Marlon James"

Dark wood cupboards went all the way around, one of which opened up to show Wheaties, Corn Flakes and Life cereal. A man, not much different from Brown Suit, was at the head of the table like Big Poppa or some shit, reading the newspaper and making lines with a red marker. Two boys on either side of him, one looking older with a moustache he was spending too much time Vaselining. Boy was cute and could’ve sworn he winked, but his ears were Alfred Neuman Mad magazine big. The other boy made me wish I had a dad who didn’t call me a fucking fruit every time I tried to grow my hair long back at twelve."|"A Brief History of Seven Killings"|"Marlon James"

Mind you know, Alex Pierce, Jamaica can shoot through your veins and it become like every dark sweet thing that not good for you. But me done with talking in riddle. The thing is, unless you did know where to look for me, there is no way you could have find me. Yeah, yeah, you’re concerned about the fall of the peace process, so tell me something, how you plan to learn anything about it if you not been in the country since 1978? Me surprised you even hear about it, since you never was on the rock when it happen. So you going talk to Lucy? Brethren, you no serious. Lucy is the key. Me and she is the only people from the peace council still alive. You going have to track her down in Jamaica, my youth. You ever wonder how come we two still alive while everybody else dead? Of course not, until right now, you did think it was only one. Remember, you know, on paper me supposed to dead too. Everybody get killed and depending who you talk to, that include the Singer.

"ap 08:00"|eight|"It felt good to hang up on the bitch. Focus. I’m across the street waiting to take this Jamaican out. Except I haven’t figured out how exactly yet. I don’t even know if this should be a one-man job, in fact it shouldn’t when so many things are up for grabs. I don’t even know if he’ll be alone in his house. Nobody has come or gone for hours, I think but I don’t know since it’s still too dark for the lights to come on. I’m really walking in there blind and stupid, as if this wasn’t part of Griselda’s fucked-up plan to begin with. Take the man out, but if he also takes me out that’s just a fucking bonus. It’s only eight. Even if he’s there he couldn’t be asleep. The best thing to do was wait until he leaves and take him out in the street. But if he is what she said he is, there’s no way he’d be alone on the street, which might be why these Miami boys gave me the Uzi after all. This was getting fucking complicated. Nothing to do but wait till a reasonable hour and move in. Screw on the silencer. Pick the lock, scope out the room, sweep and take him out. Maybe all you need to be a pro is to think like one. All Iceman-like."|"A Brief History of Seven Killings"|"Marlon James"

Oh yeah, Alex Pierce, how long you think it take me to find out what I need to know about you? Thinking that because you live on Bedford and Clifton that you is hardcore. Two-thirty-eight Clifton Place, right? First-floor apartment, no, wait, second-floor—I forget that you Americans don’t use ground floor. Haha. Everybody on your street black and dressed like they auditioning for Thriller and you one looking like you playing for the Eagles. You is something, Alex Pierce, make me guess, is me comparing you to the Eagles that piss you off. But me wrong ’bout you. You not leaving in five minutes.
