12:00|noonday|"• The God’s name was Bondru Dharm, which, according to the linguists who had worked with the Owlbrit before the last of them died, meant something to do with noonday. Noonday Uncovered was the most frequent guess, though Noonday Found and Noonday Announced were also in the running. Only a handful of the Owlbrit had been still alive on Hobbs Land when it was settled by Hobbs Transystem Foods. All but one of them had died soon thereafter, so there hadn’t been a lot of opportunity to clarify the meanings of the sounds they made."|"Raising the Stones"|"Sheri S. Tepper"
12:00|noon|"“The ruins and a few words and phrases of their language we’ve adopted as localisms,” admitted Horgy. “Names for places and things. Creely, that’s a kind of local fish. Bondru, that means noon. We can make only an approximation of their sounds I’m afraid. We can’t really duplicate their language vocally.”"|"Raising the Stones"|"Sheri S. Tepper"
12:00|noon|"• Beside the ruined temple north of Settlement One, shallow in the soil lay Birribat Shum. Shallow he lay, with fragments of roots and crumbs of leaves on his eyes, with particles of sand between his toes, with the small creatures of the soil at work upon his hands where skin gave up its chemistry cell by cell. In the soil lay Birribat Shum, shallow in the soil, with the sunwarm earth over him and the shaded depths below, moisture rising beside him and in him, gasses bubbling up into the porous dirt, a daily percolation as sun rose and hung above at noon and set. In the soil lay Birribat Shum when night came and the earth cooled and all things sank down, as though snuggling more deeply into the bed of earth, only to rise and percolate once more with the dawn. In the soil lay Birribat Shum, and the soil ate him."|"Raising the Stones"|"Sheri S. Tepper"
13:00|"One that afternoon"|"“How often does he do this?” asked Dern Blass, who had come to Settlement One that afternoon, disguised as a peddler, in response to certain rumors he had heard. “How often does he sit out here talking to himself?”"|"Raising the Stones"|"Sheri S. Tepper"
"ap 03:00"|Three|"Harribon had never heard of Bubble Lake or Cloudbridge. Besides, he hadn’t come to look at scenery. So far as he knew, no one ever went anywhere on Hobbs Land to look at scenery. What he wanted to know would be in the settlement, anyhow, so he went first to the barns and equipment yards, looking for nothing in particular. He found nothing in particular. People seemed to be fully occupied, not hurrying, but not wasting time either. They greeted him, introduced themselves, seemed pleased to see him, but didn’t stand around looking for an excuse not to work. He stood for a while in the door of the main tractor shed, watching a man and woman working on a fertilizer pump. She was doing the repair. He was fetching and carrying. Harribon saw her put out her hand for a tool and the tool being slapped into it, then the hand again and another tool. He watched for some little time, then left, realizing only after he’d left that the two hadn’t exchanged a word. That’s the kind of teamwork he envied. He saw it sometimes at Three, but it was a rare and wonderful commodity."|"Raising the Stones"|"Sheri S. Tepper"
12:00|Noon|"“He was raised fifteen days ago,” said Saturday. “Between the tenth and the eleventh hour of the day watch. Like his predecessor, he was Noon Discovered.” She laughed, the others laughing with her. “It’s a pun,” she told Harribon. “Or maybe a riddle. Bondru Dharm means ‘Noon Discovered.” so Birribat is also Bondru Dharm.”"|"Raising the Stones"|"Sheri S. Tepper"
"< 12:00"|"just before noon"|"“It isn’t that so much. More this business of their identifying themselves as the Ones Who. I keep rememevery every ten days or so. Saturday Wilm called ahead for an appointment with Horgy and arrived at his office just before noon. She had come alone. Horgy’s reputation was such that she felt she would get a better hearing if she went by herself, and Horgy was probably, so she and Gotoit had agreed, not at all dangerous to someone her age. In furtherance of the mission, however, she had paid particular attention to her dress and appearance."|"Raising the Stones"|"Sheri S. Tepper"
02:30|vigils|"None of the Topmen had a problem with it. The visitation committee was. well-accepted, not only by the few sick and injured, but also by the people of the settlements. Many of them were particularly touched by the little ritual the children worked up of keeping all-night vigil at the gravesides of those who died. Though there were only a few who were sick, there were always accidents, always fatalities. As time went on, the committee conducted vigils in every one of the settlements except One and Three."|"Raising the Stones"|"Sheri S. Tepper"
02:30|vigils|"It was the first Zilia had heard of it. She had not looked at Horgy’s report on innovations, and though Dern Blass had been interested in the proliferation of Hobbs Land Gods, no one had mentioned vigils at recent meetings. “At the grave?” she asked, amazed. Graveside services were unknown. Only the family or those appointed for the duty took bodies to a grave or to whatever other form of disposal was used. This, a Baidee custom which had become accepted Systemwide, was almost never contravened. The Baidee considered the body simply as something to be disposed of, a leftover, not’ something to focus community attention upon. It was customary for families to dispose of bodies, quickly though respectfully, even before memorials were conducted."|"Raising the Stones"|"Sheri S. Tepper"
02:30|vigils|"“I’ll say,” agreed Jep. “I’m tired. This is the last one.”
“No more vigils,” said Saturday. “I’ll sort of miss the singing.”
“No reason for vigils,” Jep shook his head. “Not anymore.”"|"Raising the Stones"|"Sheri S. Tepper"

“No reason for vigils,” Jep shook his head. “Not anymore.”
“I’ve got four left,” said Saturday, peering into her knapsack. “I cut fifteen when we raised Birribat. We used ten in the settlements and one here, so I’ve got four left. Why did I do that?”"|"Raising the Stones"|"Sheri S. Tepper"
02:30|vigils|"The lights in the street threw long shadows across the empty churchyard. To one side of it the silent crypt loomed, mysterious and awesome in the dim light, the iron grating across its door locking away the world of the dead. Saturday had spent too many nights on vigils to be impressed. It was only a tomb, only a door. Sam used the wire to open the lock while Saturday kept watch. It took him no time at all. With the door half-shut behind them, Sam put the dull spade to the hard-packed ground and, cursing under his breath, began to lay the moist, heavy clods aside. Even inside the tomb, the earth was damp, as it seemed to be everywhere in Voorstod."|"Raising the Stones"|"Sheri S. Tepper"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"They came after midnight, when the lights of the city were out, down the dark streets in undulant processions. A snake the length of several houses, green as emeralds, with Gharm capering after it, making a happy noise on bells and cymbals and tiny drums. A roof-high bird stalking behind the snake, brooding violet veils of feather sprouting from its wings. And again, Gharm behind, singing."|"Raising the Stones"|"Sheri S. Tepper"

12:00|noon|"Maintenance of Doors was an Authority responsibility. The Bureau of Doors, unlike other Authority subdivisions, had a well-earned reputation for actually working. Its people were trained to a fare-thee-well, and they liked to be kept busy. By noon the station outside Serena had been informed by the Bureau that Hobbs Land had no functioning Doors and was therefore unavailable. By midway in the afternoon, the import center at Chowdari was aware that Thyker was under embargo."|"Raising the Stones"|"Sheri S. Tepper"
