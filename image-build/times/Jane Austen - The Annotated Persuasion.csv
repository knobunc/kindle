He would go, though I told him how ill I was. He said he should not stay out long; but he has never come back, and now it is almost one. I assure you, I have not seen a soul this whole long morning.”"|"The Annotated Persuasion"|"Jane Austen"

"> 12:00"|"past noon"|"The first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night, but to this Mr. Musgrove, for the sake of his horses, would not consent; and when it came to be rationally considered, a day in the middle of November would not leave much time for seeing a new place, after deducting seven hours, as the nature of the country required, for going and returning. They were consequently to stay the night there, and not to be expected back till the next day’s dinner. This was felt to be a considerable amendment; and though they all met at the Great House at rather an early breakfast hour, and set off very punctually, it was so much past noon before the two carriages, Mr. Musgrove’s coach containing the four ladies, and Charles’s curricle, in which he drove Captain Wentworth, were descending the long hill into Lyme, and entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself, that it was very evident they would not have more than time for looking about them, before the light and warmth of the day were gone."|"The Annotated Persuasion"|"Jane Austen"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"Anne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown, or a cap, would not be liable to any such misuse, when a knock at the door suspended every thing. “A knock at the door! and so late! It was ten o’clock. Could it be Mr. Elliot? They knew he was to dine in Lansdown Crescent. It was possible that he might stop in his way home, to ask them how they did. They could think of no one else. Mrs. Clay decidedly thought it Mr. Elliot’s knock.” Mrs. Clay was right. With all the state which a butler and foot-boy could give, Mr. Elliot was ushered into the room."|"The Annotated Persuasion"|"Jane Austen"

"ap 01:30"|"one thirty"|"27. Lady Russell’s change of attitude reflects her knowledge of how much a woman’s youthfulness determined her marital eligibility. One reason was the premium placed on women’s beauty and the focus on youthful bloom as the basis of beauty. Another reason was that bearing children was the main function of a wife, which meant men preferred a bride in a state of maximum fertility (there were no medical treatments then for infertility). Thus even a woman in her early twenties could be less desirable than one in her late teens, while a woman in her late twenties was rapidly losing her eligibility, and one thirty or older had generally lost her chance."|"The Annotated Persuasion"|"Jane Austen"

20:07|twenty-seven|"59. Most of the characters who dance in Jane Austen’s novels are young people, who would naturally be more drawn to what she calls in Emma “the felicities of rapid motion,” and who would have more strength for it (each pair of dances, which is what people would be expected to stand up for at a minimum, would last half an hour, and whole balls could last many hours). Yet Anne, at twenty-seven and in apparent good health, would still be perfectly fit for participating—this fitness is what helps inspire the question. The answer suggests that she has even ceased dancing at the local balls given by her elder sister, but it is doubtful this answer resulted from careful reflection. It may be Captain Wentworth’s presence that helps keep Anne off the floor. The answer also keeps him from conceiving that at least part of the reason for her playing the instrument rather than dancing is her wish and willingness to be helpful to others."|"The Annotated Persuasion"|"Jane Austen"
