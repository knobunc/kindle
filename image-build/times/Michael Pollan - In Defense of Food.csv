"ap 01:00"|one|"There are many things you could say about this intricate loaf of “bread,” but note first that even if it managed to slip by your great grandmother (because it is a loaf of bread, or at least is called one and strongly resembles one), the product fails every test proposed under rule number two: It’s got unfamiliar ingredients (monoglycerides I’ve heard of before, but ethoxylated monoglycerides?); unpronounceable ingredients (try “azodicarbonamide”); it exceeds the maximum of five ingredients (by roughly thirty-six); and it contains high-fructose corn syrup. Sorry, Sara Lee, but your Soft & Smooth Whole Grain White Bread is not food and if not for the indulgence of the FDA could not even be labeled “bread.”"|"In Defense of Food"|"Michael Pollan"
