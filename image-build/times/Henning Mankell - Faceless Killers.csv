05:13|"5:13 AM"|"The incoming telephone call was recorded by the Ystad police at 5:13 AM. It was taken by an exhausted officer who had been on duty almost without a break since New Year’s Eve. He had listened to the stammering voice on the phone and thought that it was just some deranged senior citizen. But something had sparked his attention nevertheless. He started asking questions. When the conversation was over, he hesitated for just a moment before lifting the receiver again and dialing a number he knew by heart."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
02:00|"two AM"|"Kurt Wallander was asleep. He had stayed up far too long the night before, listening to recordings of Maria Callas that a good friend had sent him from Bulgaria. Again and again he had returned to her Traviata, and it was close to two AM before he finally went to bed. By the time the ring of the telephone roused him from sleep, he was deep in an intense erotic dream. As if to assure himself that he had only been dreaming, he reached out and felt the covers next to him. But he was alone in the bed. Neither his wife, who had left him three months earlier, nor the black woman with whom he had just been making fierce love in his dream, was present."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 07:28"|"Seven twenty-eight"|"When the ambulance had vanished down the gravel road, Wallander and Peters went outside. Norén was wiping his face with a handkerchief. The dawn was slowly approaching. Wallander looked at his wristwatch. Seven twenty-eight."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"His father reluctantly let himself be persuaded. “Come at seven. I’ll have time to see you then.”
“I’ll be there at seven. See you.”
Wallander hung up and pushed the button to block incoming calls."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"

"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"At ten o’clock everyone gathered in his office. Rydberg had been called in from the crime scene and was sitting on a Windsor chair by the window. A total of seven police officers, sitting and standing, filled the room. Wallander phoned the hospital and managed to extract the information that the old woman’s condition was still critical."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 10:40"|"twenty minutes to eleven"|"“Well,” he said, “what are we waiting for? Let’s get started.”

Without really making a decision, he shoved Verdi’s Requiem into the tape deck. He had expensive speakers in the car, and the magnificent tones surged against his eardrums. He drove off and turned right, down Dragongatan toward Osterleden. A few leaves whirled across the road, and a bicyclist strained against the wind. The clock on the dashboard said it was six. Hunger was gnawing at him again, and he crossed the main road and turned in at OK’s Cafeteria. I’ll change my eating habits tomorrow, he thought. If I get to Dad’s place a minute past seven, he’ll accuse me of abandoning him."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"

"ap 07:55"|"five minutes to eight"|"At five minutes to eight he walked back in the same glass doors he had walked out of two hours earlier. Ebba nodded at him."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 08:41"|"nineteen minutes to nine"|"They sat in silence for a moment, each lost in his own thoughts. They could no longer hear the drunk out in the hall.
It was nineteen minutes to nine.
“You can just picture it,” Wallander said after a while. “The only clue the police have to the double murder in Lenarp is that the perpetrators are probably foreigners.”"|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap > 05:00"|"Just after five"|"That night Wallander slept uneasily. Just after five he awoke with a start. His mouth was dry, and he had dreamed that somebody was trying to strangle him. When he realized that he wouldn’t be able to go back to sleep, he got up and made some coffee."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 06:30"|"six thirty"|"At six thirty he got dressed and searched for a long time before finding the heavy sweater he was looking for."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"

"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"“I want you to come to the meeting first,” said Wallander. “Then you can drive over to Limhamn.”
At ten o’clock they were all gathered in Wallander’s office.
The run-through was very brief. Wallander told them what the woman had said before she died. For the time being, this piece of information was not to be disclosed. No one seemed to have any objections."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 10:45"|"quarter to eleven"|"Martinson was put on the computer to search for foreign criminals. The officers who were going to continue with the questioning in Lenarp went on their way. Wallander assigned Svedberg to concentrate on the Polish family, who were presumably in the country illegally. He wanted to know why they were living in Lenarp. At quarter to eleven Rydberg left for Limhamn to look up the sailmaker."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 00:15"|"quarter past twelve"|"Then he sat down at his desk and asked Ebba to start putting through calls. For over an hour he spoke with various reporters. But there was no word from the girl from the local radio station.
At quarter past twelve Norén knocked on the door.
“I thought you were going to Lenarp,” Wallander said, surprised."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 00:45"|"quarter to one"|"At quarter to one he left the police station. He had to visit an old friend he hadn’t seen in many, many years."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
03:00|"three o’clock in the morning"|"The investigative meeting was long. Everyone agreed that Lars Herdin’s testimony was a breakthrough. Now they had a direction to go in. At the same time they went over everything that had been learned from the conversations with the residents of Lenarp, and the people who had telephoned the police or responded to the questionnaire they had sent out. A car that had driven through a town just a few kilometers from Lenarp at high speed late on Sunday night attracted special attention. A truck driver who had started a trip to Göteborg at three o’clock in the morning had encountered the car going around a tight curve and had almost been hit. When he heard about the double murder he started thinking, and then he called the police. He wasn’t sure, but after going through pictures of various cars he decided it was probably a Nissan."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"It was already six o’clock by the time the meeting was over. Wallander realized that all his colleagues were now on the offensive. There was palpable optimism now, after Lars Herdin’s visit."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap > 07:00"|"Just after seven"|"Just after seven he put the paper aside. He had suddenly realized that the TV people had never called back. He asked the switchboard whether Ebba had left any message before she went home."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 02:50"|"ten minutes to three"|"The glow-in-the-dark hands on his wristwatch were pointing at ten minutes to three. Oddly enough, he did not feel in the least tired. It had been almost twelve thirty by the time he got away from the police station that night. The last person to call him had been a man who refused to give his name. He had proposed that the police join forces with the domestic nationalist movements and chase all the foreigners out of the country once and for all. For a moment Wallander had tried to listen to what the anonymous man was saying. Then he had slammed down the receiver, called the switchboard, and had all incoming calls held. He turned off the lights in his office, walked down the silent corridor, and drove straight home. When he unlocked his front door, he had decided to find out who on the police force had leaked the confidential information. It wasn’t really his business at all. If conflicts arose within the police force, it was the duty of the chief of police to intervene. In a few days Björk would be back from his winter vacation. Then he could take over. The truth would have to come out."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"

"ap 06:30"|"six thirty"|"At six thirty he was back at the police station. He exchanged a few words with the duty officer and learned that the stormy night had been peaceful at least. A tractor-trailer rig had tipped over outside Ystad, and a building under construction had blown down in Skårby. That was all."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 07:45"|"Quarter to eight"|"He looked at his watch. Quarter to eight. He picked up the phone and dialed the number of Rydberg’s house. After ten rings he hung up. Rydberg was on his way."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"

"ap 00:45"|"quarter to one"|"At quarter to one he was back at the station. Since he had once again eaten too fast, he had an attack of diarrhea and ran to the toilet. When his stomach had settled somewhat, he turned in the press release to one of the office clerks and then headed for Näslund’s room."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"

"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"He tossed the parking ticket into the glove compartment and thought once again about how good-looking she was. Good-looking and charming. Then he thought about the roll he’d just eaten. It was three o’clock before Thomas Naslund called in. By that time Wallander had already decided to postpone the trip to Kristianstad to the next day."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 08:30"|"half past eight"|"“Come back afterwards and we’ll do an update,” said Wallander.
It was half past eight when Wallander and Rydberg finished.
“What do you think?” asked Wallander as they gathered up their papers."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"< 00:00"|"a few minutes to midnight"|"He woke up with a start a few hours later because he was cold.
His watch showed a few minutes to midnight.
He felt dejected about waking up. Now he’d have another sleepless night."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap < 04:00"|"almost four o’clock"|"It was almost four o’clock by the time Wallander could leave the hospital. His bandages were too tight, and he still felt sick from the smoke he had inhaled."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"At eight o’clock Wallander woke up because somebody was pounding a sledgehammer inside his head. When he opened his eyes, he became aware of the throbbing in his temples. He had once again dreamed of the unknown black woman who had visited him before in his dreams. But when he stretched out his hand for her, Sten Widen was suddenly standing there with the whiskey bottle in his hand, and the woman had turned her back on Wallander and gone off with Sten instead."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 08:00"|"Eight o’clock"|"“Then how about the Central? What time?”
“Eight o’clock?”
“I’ll be there.”"|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 09:30"|"nine thirty"|"By nine thirty everything had returned to normal. By then he had already managed to give the director of the refugee camp a fierce lecture about the sloppy supervision of the refugees who occupied the barracks. The director, who was short and plump and radiated a large measure of apathetic laziness, had vigorously defended himself by insisting that he had followed the rules and regulations of the Immigration Service to the letter."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 06:45"|"quarter to seven"|"He drove straight home, made some tea, and crawled into bed. When he woke up several hours later, the teacup was standing next to his bed untouched. It was quarter to seven. He was feeling a little better after getting some sleep. He threw out the cold tea and made coffee instead. Then he called his father."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"

"ap 06:59"|"one minute to seven"|"The thought got him excited. Again he wondered whether he should call up Anette Brolin. But he couldn’t talk himself into it. Angrily he sat down on the floral-patterned sofa and switched on the TV. It was one minute to seven. He rolled through to one of the Danish channels, where the news broadcast was just about to start."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap < 09:00"|"almost nine o’clock"|"It was almost nine o’clock. Again he was tempted to call Anette Brolin. But he resisted. He had no idea what he would say to her. And maybe her husband would answer the phone."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 07:15"|"quarter past seven"|"At quarter past seven he laid the suit on the back seat and drove off. A thick cloud cover hung over the town."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 07:40"|"Twenty to eight"|"The rental car from Göteborg didn’t fit into the picture. Maybe it had nothing to do with the case at all.
He looked at his watch. Twenty to eight. Thursday, January eleventh.
Instead of driving straight to his father’s house, he went a few kilometers past it and turned off on the little gravel road that wound through rolling sand dunes up toward Båckakra, Dag Hammarskjöld’s estate, which the statesman had bequeathed to the Swedish public. Wallander left the car in the empty parking lot and walked up the hill; from there he could see the sea stretched out below."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 08:00"|"Eight o’clock"|"“We made a date yesterday.”
“Eight o’clock, you said.”
“Good grief, I’m only eleven minutes late.”"|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"At nine o’clock he went through the door of the police station and left his suit with Ebba, who promised to have it cleaned and pressed by that afternoon."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"At ten o’clock he called a meeting for all the team members who weren’t out. The ones who had seen the spot on the news the night before shared his indignation. After a brief discussion they agreed that Wallander should write a sharp rebuttal and distribute it on the wire service."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 09:00"|"Nine o’clock"|"“Nine o’clock at the Hotel Svea in Simrishamn,” said Boman. “A cup of coffee to start the day with.”"|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap < 01:00"|"almost one o’clock"|"He dropped the letter off to be typed and went into the lunchroom for coffee. He hadn’t had time to think about food yet.

"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"“Preferably before ten on Monday,” she said. “The rest of the day I have detention hearings and negotiations in district court.”
They settled on nine o’clock.
Wallander watched her as she disappeared down the corridor."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 03:30"|"half past three"|"Once during the war, in the fall of 1943, he had been taken to district court in a case of assault and battery. But he had been acquitted. Someone had dug up a copy of the report, and Wallander read through it carefully. But he could see no reasonable motive for revenge. It seemed to have been an ordinary quarrel that led to blows at Erikslund community center.
At half past three Ebba brought in his dry-cleaned suit.
“You’re an angel,” he said."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"He spent the time until five o’clock filling in a soccer lottery coupon, making an appointment to have his car serviced, and thinking through the important interviews for him the following day.

"ap 05:03"|"three minutes after five"|"At three minutes after five Thomas Naslund stuck his head in the door."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap < 07:00"|"just before seven"|"After a quick shower he made it to Malmö just before seven. He found a parking space near Stortorget and went down the steps to Kock’s Tavern. He would toss back a couple of drinks before he met Mona at the restaurant of the Central Hotel."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"The last thing Kurt Wallander felt like was a laughing policeman as he stepped into the Svea Hotel in Simrishamn at seven o’clock on Friday morning. An almost impenetrable mixture of snow and rain was falling over Skane, and water had seeped through his shoes on his way from the car to the hotel."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 06:15"|"six fifteen"|"Wallander went into his apartment and polished off the last of an almost empty bottle of whiskey. Then he fell asleep for several hours, lying on top of his bed. Without thinking, without dreaming. At six fifteen he got into his car again, after giving himself a cursory shave."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"Göran Boman was punctual. At the stroke of nine he entered the dining room."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
04:13|"four thirteen in the morning"|"“On March 9, 1951, she gave birth to a son at Kristianstad’s maternity ward. At four thirteen in the morning, to be exact.

It was three fifteen. Once again it had started to rain.
"|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap < 05:00"|"almost five o’clock"|"Kurt Wallander stood freezing in the pouring rain. It was almost five o’clock, and the police had rigged floodlights around the murder scene. He watched two ambulance attendants who came squishing through the mud with a stretcher. They were taking away the dead Somali. When he looked at the sea of mud he wondered whether even as skillful a detective as Rydberg would be able to find any tracks."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"“He was killed at precisely one o’clock,” he said. “The director was listening to the wire-service news on the radio when she heard the noise. There were two shots. But you know that already. He was dead before he hit the ground. It seems to have been regular buckshot. Gyttorp brand, I think. Nytrox 36, probably. That’s about all.”"|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
21:00|"nine o’clock that night"|"At nine o’clock that night the team met in the lunchroom. Wallander thought that everyone except Naslund still looked surprisingly alert. Näslund had a cold and a fever but stubbornly refused to go home."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 11:30"|"eleven thirty"|"Wallander went back to his office and put his feet up on his desk. It was eleven thirty. Slowly he let his thoughts fall into place. First he methodically replayed in his mind the murder outside the refugee camp. Had he forgotten anything? Was there any hole in Rydberg’s account of the events, or something else that they ought to be working on right away?"|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"> 00:00"|"just after midnight"|"When he finished his list, he stood up and stretched. It was just after midnight. Out in the corridor he could hear Hanson talking with Martinson, but he couldn’t hear what they were saying."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"

"ap 03:45"|"quarter to four"|"He yawned. It was quarter to four. He was too tired to think about his father. He was just afraid that the social worker at the hospital wouldn’t be able to come up with a good solution."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"

“How come he discovers it at four in the morning?”

After a great deal of effort, he managed to set the alarm function on his watch. He was going to allow himself two hours of sleep. When the beeping sound on his wrist woke him up, he had a slight headache. The first thing he thought about was his father. He took a few headache tablets out of the first-aid kit he found in a cupboard and washed them down with a cup of lukewarm coffee. Then he stood there for a long time, trying to decide whether he should take a shower first or call his sister in Stockholm. Finally he went down to the officers’ locker room and got into the shower. His headache slowly faded. But he felt weighed down with weariness as he sank onto the chair behind his desk. It was seven fifteen. He knew that his sister was always up early. And she picked up the phone almost as soon as it started ringing. As gently as possible he told her about what had happened."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 09:15"|"nine fifteen"|"It was nine fifteen when he entered the room in the Malmö police station where the man who had had his car stolen was waiting for him. Before Wallander went in to see the man, he talked to the officer who had taken the report of the theft."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
04:00|"four in the morning"|"“Tell me what happened,” he said. “At four in the morning you discovered your car was missing.”"|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
12:00|noon|"He continued on to Ystad. It was noon. On his way in he ran into a temp who was on her way out to lunch. He asked her to pick up a pizza for him."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"Without taking off his overcoat, Wallander sat down and called his sister again. They decided that he would pick her up at Sturup airport at ten o’clock the following morning."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
12:00|noon|"It was noon. Rydberg said that he might as well handle the surveillance until midnight. Wallander gave him the address."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
00:00|midnight|"It was noon. Rydberg said that he might as well handle the surveillance until midnight. Wallander gave him the address."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"At four o’clock an old woman was hit by a car and killed in Bjäresjö. Svedberg, who had returned from the gravel pit, led the investigation, even though Wallander had promised him the afternoon off."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"Näslund called at five o’clock, and Wallander could hear that he was tipsy. He wanted to know whether anything was happening, or whether he could go to a party in Skillinge. Wallander told him to go ahead."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"At eight o’clock he read through Svedberg’s report on the fatal accident in Bjäresjö. He could see at once that there was no question of any kind of criminal proceedings. The woman had stepped right out into the road in front of a car traveling at a low speed. The farmer who was driving the car was not at fault. All the eyewitness accounts agreed. He made a note to see to it that Anette Brolin read through the investigation report after the autopsy on the woman was done."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"At ten o’clock he left the police station. It was cold and the wind was blowing in gusts. The sky was clear and filled with stars. Still no snow. He went home and put on heavy long underwear and a woolen cap. Absentmindedly he also watered the drooping plants in the kitchen window. Then he drove to Malmö."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap > 11:00"|"Just after eleven"|"Just after eleven he pulled out onto E14 again and drove the last stretch to Malmö. He suddenly started to doubt the value of the assignment he had given Rydberg and himself. How justified was he in trusting his intuition? Shouldn’t Hanson’s and Rydberg’s objections have been enough for him to drop the idea of this nighttime stakeout?"|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap > 11:00"|"a few minutes past eleven"|"It was a few minutes past eleven thirty when he turned onto a cross street near the yellow row house where Rune Bergman lived. He pulled his cap over his ears as he stepped out into the cold night. All around him were dark houses. In the distance he heard the screech of car tires. He kept to the shadows as much as possible and turned down the street called Rosenallé."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"“Not much in twelve hours,” replied Rydberg. “At four o’clock he went over to a local store to buy groceries. Two hours later he came out to close the gate, which had blown open. But he’s definitely on guard. I think you may be right after all.”"|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
00:03|"Three minutes past midnight"|"He vanished without a sound. Wallander stood still for a moment, looking at the yellow house. Lights were on in two of the windows, one on the lower floor and one upstairs. The curtains were drawn. He looked at his watch. Three minutes past midnight. Rydberg had not returned. So everything must be quiet at the police station in Ystad."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 00:50"|"ten minutes to one"|"The next time he looked at his watch, it was only ten minutes to one. It was going to be a long night. He was already feeling cold. He tried to make the time pass by studying the starry sky. When his neck started to hurt, he resumed his pacing."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 01:30"|"one thirty"|"At one thirty the light on the ground floor went out. Wallander thought he could hear a radio on the second floor."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 01:55"|"five minutes to two"|"At five minutes to two a car drove past. Immediately followed by another one. Then it was quiet again."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 02:55"|"five minutes to three"|"At five minutes to three the light was turned off. Wallander listened for the radio. But everything was quiet. He flapped his arms to keep warm."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 04:30"|"four thirty"|"It took him almost twenty minutes to make his way back to the car. He saw the hands of the train station clock pointing to four thirty."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"

"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"“At three o’clock we’ll decide about the detention order,” said Anette Brolin. “I’ll be at home until then.”"|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"At ten o’clock Wallander returned to the building that was covered in sacking and construction scaffolding. To assist him he had four plainclothes policemen from Lund."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"At ten o’clock on the dot they got out of the car and crossed the street. One officer stayed at the outside door of the building. There was an intercom system, but it was out of order. Wallander jimmied the door open with a screwdriver."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"> 15:00"|"after three that afternoon"|"Right after three that afternoon he was formally put under arrest and assigned a public defender. The charge was murder or accessory to murder."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"At four o’clock Wallander questioned Valfrid Ström’s wife briefly. She was still in shock, but she answered his questions. He found out that Ström dealt in importing exclusive automobiles."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"Wallander was greatly relieved that Björk was back and could take charge of dealing with the media. His face was stung and burned, and he was very tired. By six o’clock he finally had time to call Martinson and talk to his sister. Then he drove over and picked her up. She was startled when she saw his battered face."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 10:15"|"ten fifteen"|"After Björk had left, Wallander sat down at his typewriter and typed up a comprehensive report about the capture of Rune Bergman and Valfrid Ström. He made a special effort to compile a report that Anette Brolin would not object to. It took him over two hours. At ten fifteen he pulled the last page out of the typewriter, signed it, and took the report over to Rydberg."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"“Dad seems better,” she said. “They don’t think he’s slipping into chronic senility. Maybe it was just a temporary period of confusion. We agreed to try regular home care. I was thinking about asking you to drive us out there around noon today. If you can’t do it, maybe I could borrow your car.”"|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"“All the other details will have to wait,” said Wallander. “We’ll start with these and meet again at five o’clock.”"|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap > 00:00"|"a few minutes past twelve"|"At a few minutes past twelve he set off for the hospital.

"< 14:00"|"almost two in the afternoon"|"It was almost two in the afternoon when Wallander pulled up in front of the county council’s main building in Malmö. On the way he had stopped at the motel restaurant in Svedala for a quick lunch. He parked his car and went into the large lobby."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 04:30"|"four thirty"|"By four thirty Wallander was back at the station. Neither Rydberg nor Martinson was around. He went over to the prosecutor’s office. The girl at the reception desk smiled."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"“Is she in her office?”
“She’s in district court until five o’clock.”
Wallander headed back. In the corridor he ran into Svedberg."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 05:10"|"ten minutes past five"|"At ten minutes past five Martinson and Rydberg were in Wallander’s office. He thought that Rydberg still looked tired and worn-out. Martinson was in a bad mood."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"
"ap 11:30"|"eleven thirty"|"“That’s exactly what’s such a mystery,” said Martinson. “Both of them claim that he didn’t go into town that day. And yet we know that he went to two different banks between eleven thirty and one fifteen. He must have been away from home at least three or four hours that day.”"|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"

It was one-thirty when he finally crawled between the cool sheets.
His loneliness in bed felt worse than ever."|"Faceless Killers"|"Henning Mankell"

She came alone, without the Kenyan medical student, and Wallander met her at the train station. Ebba had sent a friend of hers over the day before to give his apartment on Mariagatan a major cleaning. And he finally felt that he had his daughter back. They took a long walk along the beach by Osterleden, ate lunch at Lilla Vik, and then stayed up talking till five in the morning.
