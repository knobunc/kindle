tractor-wheels. He ate large pieces of bread and very small pieces of cheese.
He had nothing to drink, for his only Thermos had got smashed by the jolting of
the tractor two weeks before, and in wartime, for this was in January 1942, you
could not buy another anywhere. For about fifteen minutes he sat on the ground
in the shelter of the wheel and ate his lunch. Then he got up and examined his

in the evening, I came off duty and drove back to my flat for a shower and a
change of clothes. It was the hottest time of year in Bombay, and even after
sundown the heat was like an open furnace. If you sat still in a chair and did
nothing, the sweat would come seeping out of your skin. Your face glistened
with dampness all day long and your shirt stuck to your chest. I took a long
cool shower. I drank a whisky and soda sitting on the veranda, with only a
towel round my waist. Then I put on some clean clothes. At ten minutes to
seven, I was outside the Royal Palace Hall in Acacia Street. It was not much of
a place. It was one of those smallish seedy halls that can be hired
inexpensively for meetings or dances. There was a fair-sized crowd of local
Indians milling round outside the ticket office, and a large poster over the
entrance proclaiming that THE INTERNATIONAL THEATRE COMPANY was performing
every night that week. It said there would be jugglers and conjurers and
acrobats and sword-swallowers and fire-eaters and
snake-charmers and a one-act play entitled The
Rajah and the Tiger Lady. But above all this and in far the largest

point of practising with the candle every morning and
every evening. Often he practised at midday as well.
For the first time in his life he was throwing himself into something with
genuine enthusiasm. And the progress he made was remarkable. After six months,
he could concentrate absolutely upon his own face for no less than three
minutes without a single outside thought entering his mind."|"The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Six More"|"Roald Dahl"
"< 00:00"|"near midnight"|"At this point, he decided the time had come to test himself
with the cards. He was in the living-room of his London flat when he made this
decision and it was near midnight. He got out a pack of cards and a pencil and
paper. He was shaking with excitement. He placed the pack upside down before
him and concentrated on the top card."|"The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Six More"|"Roald Dahl"

it. It took four weeks to get his time down from ten seconds to nine, and five
more weeks to go from nine to eight. But at this stage, hard work no longer
bothered him. His powers of concentration had now developed to such a degree
that he was able to work for twelve hours at a stretch with no trouble at all.
And he knew with absolute certainty that he would get there in the end. He
would not stop until he did. Day after day, night after night, he sat crouching
over the cards with his stop-watch beside him, fighting with a terrible
intensity to knock those last few stubborn seconds off his time."|"The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Six More"|"Roald Dahl"

"ap 07:30"|seven-thirty|"Apart from the masters, there was another man in the school who frightened us
considerably. This was Mr Pople.
Mr Pople was a paunchy,
crimson-faced individual who acted as school-porter, boiler superintendent and
general handyman. His power stemmed from the fact that he could (and he most
certainly did) report us to the headmaster upon the slightest provocation. Mr Pople's moment of glory came
each morning at seven-thirty precisely, when he would stand at the end of the
long main corridor and ""ring the bell"". The bell was huge and made of
brass, with a thick wooden handle, and Mr Pople would swing it back and forth at arm's length in a
special way of his own, so that it went clangetty-clang-clang,
clangetty-clang-clang, clangetty-clang-clang. At the sound of the bell,
all the boys in the school, one hundred and eighty of us, would move smartly to
our positions in the corridor. We lined up against the walls on both sides and
stood stiffly to attention, awaiting the headmaster's inspection."|"The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Six More"|"Roald Dahl"

scene, and during this time, Mr Pople
would conduct a ceremony so extraordinary that to this day I find it hard to
believe it ever took place. There were six lavatories in the school, numbered
on their doors from one to six. Mr Pople, standing at the end of the long corridor, would have
in the palm of his hand six small brass discs, each with a number on it, one to
six. There was absolute silence as he allowed his eye to travel down the two
lines of stiffly-standing boys. Then he would bark out a name, ""Arkle!"""|"The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Six More"|"Roald Dahl"

duty. Nobody asked them if they might or might not be ready to move their
bowels at seven-thirty in the morning before breakfast. They were simply
ordered to do so. But we considered it a great privilege to be chosen because
