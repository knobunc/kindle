18:00|"six p.m."|"“Hello, Roland’s voice mail. If it’s still secure, meet me at the Marriott suite you rented, tonight at six p.m. Bye.” She stabbed the “off” button on her phone viciously then remarked to the air, “Be there or be dead meat.”"|"The Hidden Family"|"Charles Stross"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"“Hello yourself.” The nurse at the desk glanced up. “Visiting hours run until eight,” she commented, “you’ve got an hour. Who are you looking for?”"|"The Hidden Family"|"Charles Stross"
"ap 01:00"|"One o’clock"|"One o’clock. Miriam blinked, suddenly dizzy. Her buttocks ached from the hard stool, she was hungry, and she needed the lavatory. She stood up and put the notebook PC away, then headed for the toilet—an outhouse in the backyard. Afterwards she slipped out the front door in search of lunch. Of such elements were a working day made."|"The Hidden Family"|"Charles Stross"
"ap 06:30"|six-thirty|"Early evening, a discreet restaurant on the waterfront, glass windows overlooking the open water, darkness and distant lights. It was six-thirty precisely. Miriam nervously adjusted her bra strap and shivered, then marched up to the front desk."|"The Hidden Family"|"Charles Stross"
01:00|"One o’clock in the morning"|"One o’clock in the morning. Ring ring … “Hello?” Roland’s voice was furred with sleep."|"The Hidden Family"|"Charles Stross"
04:00|"four o’clock in the morning"|"“You were in New London all along,” he said, accusingly. “Staying in the Grange Mouth Hotel. Into which you checked in at four o’clock in the morning the day after the incident.”"|"The Hidden Family"|"Charles Stross"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"“Yes, well, as I told the thief-taker’s sergeant, I dined in town then caught the last train, and my carriage threw a wheel on its way from the railway station. And I stayed with it because cabs are thin on the ground at two o’clock.”"|"The Hidden Family"|"Charles Stross"
00:00|midnight|"“Humph.” Smith looked disappointed, to her delight. Gotcha! she thought. She’d set off from her office in Cambridge at midnight, floored the accelerator all the way down the near-empty interstate, and somehow managed not to pick up any speeding tickets. There were no red-eye flights in New Britain, nor highways you could drive along at a hundred five miles an hour with one hand on the wheel and the other clutching an insulated mug of coffee. In fact, the fastest form of land travel was the train—and as she’d be happy to point out to the inspector, the last train she could have caught from Boston to arrive in New London before 4 a.m. had left at eight o’clock the night before."|"The Hidden Family"|"Charles Stross"

"ap 01:00"|one|"“I know he’s called one.” Olga looked at Miriam suspiciously. “That’s most unusual. Is it your fault?”"|"The Hidden Family"|"Charles Stross"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"Mike wandered along to the vending machine, passing a couple of suits from the public liaison office, and collected a mug of coffee. Traffic was bad this morning, really bad. And he hadn’t shaved properly either. It was only nine but he already had a five o’clock shadow, adding to his bearish appearance. Don’t mess with me."|"The Hidden Family"|"Charles Stross"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"Pete was already nose-deep in paperwork that had come in the morning mail when Mike finally made it to his desk. Pete was a morning guy, always frazzled by six o’clock—when Mike was just hitting his stride. “Tell me the news,” Mike grunted. “Anything happening?”"|"The Hidden Family"|"Charles Stross"
00:00|midnight|"“Shut up and listen, girl.” Miriam shut up abruptly and stared at her. Iris was watching her with a peculiar intensity. “You are by damn going to tell me everything. Especially who’s after you, so that I know who to watch for. Because anyone who tries to get at you through me is going to get a very nasty surprise indeed, love.” For a moment, Iris’s eyes were icy-cold, as harsh as the assassin in the orangery at midnight, two days before. Then they softened. “You’re all I’ve got left,” she said quietly. “Humor your old ma, please? It’s been a long time since anything interesting happened to me—interesting in the sense of the Chinese proverb, anyway.”"|"The Hidden Family"|"Charles Stross"
"ap 00:00"|"twelve o’clock"|"It was twelve o’clock, and all the church bells in Boston were chiming noon."|"The Hidden Family"|"Charles Stross"
12:00|noon|"It was twelve o’clock, and all the church bells in Boston were chiming noon."|"The Hidden Family"|"Charles Stross"
12:00|noon|"Miriam’s fleeting look of puzzlement seemed to reassure him. “Well that’s good,” he said genially. “Excuse me while I fetch the aqua regia: If this is pure I can advance you, oh, ten pounds immediately and another, ahum—” He picked up the gold bar and placed it on the balance behind him. “—sixty two and eight shillings by noon tomorrow.”"|"The Hidden Family"|"Charles Stross"
00:00|midnight|"“Indeed you may.” She smiled, surreptitiously pushing back her glove to check her watch. “I believe I have half an hour to spare before I must depart. My carriage turns back into a pumpkin at midnight.”"|"The Hidden Family"|"Charles Stross"
"ap < 11:00"|"nearly eleven"|"Paulette glanced at the window. “It’s nearly eleven, for Pete’s sake! You want I should pull an overnighter?”"|"The Hidden Family"|"Charles Stross"
"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"The next morning Paulette arrived back at the house around noon, whistling jauntily. “I did it!” she declared, startling Miriam out of the history book she was working up a headache over. “We move in tomorrow!”"|"The Hidden Family"|"Charles Stross"
18:00|"six that evening"|"At six that evening, she walked through the gathering gloom to Burgeson’s shop and slipped inside. The shop was open, but empty. She spent a good minute tapping her toes and whistling tunelessly before Erasmus emerged from the back."|"The Hidden Family"|"Charles Stross"
"ap 03:05"|"three five"|"“And don’t forget the paycheck.” Miriam nodded. “Listen, I found one good thing out about the far side. Gold is about as legal there as heroin is here, and vice versa. I’m getting about two hundred pounds on the black market for a brick weighing sixteen Troy ounces, worth about three thousand, three five, dollars here. A pound goes a lot further than a dollar, it’s like, about two hundred bucks. So three and a half thousand here buys me the equivalent of forty thousand over there. Real estate prices are low, too. The place I need to buy on the far side is huge, but it should go for about a thousand pounds, call it equivalent to two hundred grand here. In our own Boston it’d be going for upwards of a million, easily. But gold is worth so much that I can pay for it with five bars of the stuff—about eighteen thousand dollars on this side. I’ve found an, uh, black-market outlet who seems reasonably trustworthy at handling the gold—he’s got his angles, but I know what they are. And it is amazingly easy to set up a new identity! Anyway, if I play this right I can build a front as a rich widow returning home from the empire with a fortune and then get the far side money pump running.”"|"The Hidden Family"|"Charles Stross"
"ap 11:42"|"eleven-forty two"|"“First message, received yesterday at eleven-forty two: Miriam? Oh, Sky Father! Listen, are you alright? Phone me, please.” It was Roland, and he didn’t sound happy. Anguish rose in her chest. Roland—she didn’t let the thought reach her tongue. “It’s urgent,” he added, before the click of the call ending."|"The Hidden Family"|"Charles Stross"
"ap 09:12"|nine-twelve|"“Second message, received yesterday at nine-twelve: Miriam, dear? It’s me.” Iris, she realized. There was a pause. “I know I haven’t been entirely candid with you, and I want you to know that I bitterly regret it.” Another, much longer pause and the sound of labored breathing. Miriam clutched the phone to her ear like a drowning woman. “I’ve … something unexpected has come up. I’ve got to go on a long journey. Miriam, I want you to understand that I am going to be alright. I know exactly what I’m doing, and it’s something I should have done years ago. But it’s not fair to burden you with it. I’ll try to call you or leave messages, but you are not to come around or try to follow me. I love you.” Click."|"The Hidden Family"|"Charles Stross"
