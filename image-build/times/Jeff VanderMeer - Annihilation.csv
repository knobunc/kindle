00:00|midnight|"But all such questions would be for later, in the light of the surface. Mechanically,
         like a golem, I just took photographs of key phrases—even as the surveyor thought
         I was clicking pictures of blank wall, or off-center shots of the main fungal words—to
         put some distance between myself and whatever I might think about these variants.
         While the main scrawl continued, and continued to unnerve:… in the black water with the sun shining at midnight, those fruit shall come ripe
            and in the darkness of that which is golden shall split open to reveal the revelation
            of the fatal softness in the earth …"|Annihilation|"Jeff VanderMeer"
"< 12:00"|"almost noon"|"It was almost noon by the time I reached the lighthouse. I had been careful to drink
         water and have a snack on my journey, but I still arrived weary; perhaps the lack
         of sleep had caught up with me. But then, too, the last three hundred yards to reach
         the lighthouse were tension-filled, as I kept remembering the surveyor’s warning.
         I had a gun out, held down by my side, for all the good it would do against a high-powered
         rifle. I kept looking at the little window halfway up its swirled black-and-white
         surface, and then to the large panoramic windows at the top, alert for any movement."|Annihilation|"Jeff VanderMeer"

00:00|midnight|"I had lingered too long and would have to travel through the dark to make it back
         to base camp. If I kept up a steady pace, I might make it back by midnight. There
         was some advantage in arriving at an unexpected hour, given how I had left things
         with the surveyor. Something also warned me against staying at the lighthouse overnight.
         Perhaps it was just the unease from seeing the strangeness of the psychologist’s wound
         or perhaps I still felt as if a presence inhabited that place, but regardless I set
         out soon after gathering up my knapsack full of supplies and my husband’s journal.
         Behind me lay the increasingly solemn silhouette of what was no longer really a lighthouse
         but instead a kind of reliquary. As I stared back, I saw a thin green fountain of
         light gushing up, framed by the curve of the dunes, and felt even more resolve to
         put miles between us. It was the psychologist’s wound, from where she lay on the beach,
         glowing more brightly than before. The suggestion of some sped-up form of life burning
         fiercely did not bear close scrutiny. Another phrase I had seen copied in her journal
         came to mind: There shall be a fire that knows your name, and in the presence of the strangling
            fruit, its dark flame shall acquire every part of you."|Annihilation|"Jeff VanderMeer"
