00:00|midnight|"They had eleven hours to kill before the operation started at midnight. The other men, ignoring a huge TV set, started a card game on the sundeck; they were all in bathing suits. Pippi smiled at Cross and said, “Shit, I forgot about the swimming pool.”"|"Last Don"|"Mario Puzo"
"~ 00:00"|"around midnight"|"After the meal, Pippi took Cross on a reconnaissance in the stolen car. They drove to the western-style restaurant and coffee shop farther down the Pacific Coast Highway where they would find Theo. The surveillance reports showed that on Wednesday nights Theo, on his way to Oxnard, had made a habit of stopping at the Pacific Coast Highway Restaurant at around midnight for coffee and ham and eggs. That he would leave about one in the morning. That night a surveillance team of two men would be tailing him and would report by telephone when he was on the way."|"Last Don"|"Mario Puzo"

"ap 11:30"|eleven-thirty|"Cross and Pippi sat on the sundeck waiting for the phone call. There were five cars in the driveway, all black, shining in the moonlight like bugs. The six men from the Enclave continued their card game, playing with silver coins: nickels, dimes, and quarters. Finally at eleven-thirty the phone call came: Theo was on his way from Brentwood to the restaurant. The six men got in three cars and drove away to take up their appointed posts. Pippi and Cross got into the stolen car and waited another fifteen minutes before they left. Cross had in the pocket of his jacket a small .22 pistol, which, though it had no silencer, only gave off a sharp little pop; Pippi carried a Glock that would make a loud report. Ever since his only arrest for murder, Pippi always refused to carry a silencer."|"Last Don"|"Mario Puzo"
"ap 00:30"|twelve-thirty|"Cross looked at his watch. It was twelve-thirty. They had to wait another fifteen minutes. Suddenly Pippi hit his shoulder. “He’s early,” Pippi said. “Go!”"|"Last Don"|"Mario Puzo"
"~ 03:00"|"about three in the morning"|"“I remember one night about three years ago,” Cross said to Dante. “The Rustler had a great streak at the crap table. I think he won over a hundred grand. It was about three in the morning. And when the pit boss took his chips to the cage, the Rustler jumped up on the crap table and pissed all over it.”"|"Last Don"|"Mario Puzo"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"After she left, Cross felt free. It was a weakness to be so much in love, but satisfied lust gave him confidence. At three in the morning he made his last tour of the casino."|"Last Don"|"Mario Puzo"
12:00|noon|"Andrew Pollard was the first to arrive in Las Vegas. He flew from L.A. on the noon flight, relaxed by one of the Hotel Xanadu’s huge pools, gambled small-time craps for a few hours, then was secretly whisked into Cross De Lena’s penthouse office suite."|"Last Don"|"Mario Puzo"
00:00|midnight|"“I’ve met him,” Cross said. “I want you to do one other thing. Lend me your Pacific Ocean Security ID for a couple of hours. You’ll have it back in time to catch the midnight flight to L.A.”"|"Last Don"|"Mario Puzo"
"ap 07:00"|"Seven o’clock"|"“Seven o’clock,” Pollard said. “Two of my men will come to pick you up and bring you to the meeting place. They will stay with her to be her bodyguards. Two of my best men, armed. Just so you won’t get any funny ideas.”"|"Last Don"|"Mario Puzo"
19:00|"seven that evening"|"At seven that evening, when Lia Vazzi arrived at the hotel with one of his soldiers, Skannet was waiting for him and ready to go immediately. Skannet was dressed very neatly in a boyish way. He wore heavy blue jeans, a faded blue denim shirt, and a white sports jacket. He had shaved carefully, and his blond hair was combed straight back. His red skin seemed paler, his face softened by the paleness. Lia Vazzi and his soldier showed Skannet their forged Pacific Ocean Security IDs."|"Last Don"|"Mario Puzo"
15:00|"three in the afternoon"|"Senator Warren Wavven and his entourage of three male aides were checked into their Xanadu Villa at three in the afternoon. As usual, he had traveled in an unmarked limo and without any sort of escort. At five, he summoned Cross to his Villa."|"Last Don"|"Mario Puzo"

I’ve devoted my attention in the last few years to passing legislation that would make gambling legal all over the United States. Even the provision to make sports gambling legal. I think I finally have the votes in the Senate and the House. The money in the trunk will swing some key votes. It is five, isn’t it?”"|"Last Don"|"Mario Puzo"
"ap 05:00"|five|"“It’s five,” Cross said. “And money well spent. Now, what’s the bad news?”"|"Last Don"|"Mario Puzo"
16:00|"four P.M."|"Bantz said into the phone, “I just wanted to confirm our appointment for four P.M. Yes, we’ll talk about your script next week.” He hung up the phone and gave Deere a sly smile."|"Last Don"|"Mario Puzo"

00:00|midnight|"Ernest and Kenneth had become friends on Ernest’s first visit to Hollywood almost twenty years before. Ernest had suffered an excruciating toothache at the dinner of a producer who was courting him for the rights to one of his books. The producer had called Kenneth at midnight, and Kenneth had rushed to the party to drive Ernest to his office to treat the infected tooth. Then he had driven Ernest to his hotel, instructing him to come back to the office the next day."|"Last Don"|"Mario Puzo"
00:00|midnight|"Ernest later commented to the producer that he must have a lot of clout for a dentist to make a house call at midnight. The producer said no, Kenneth Kaldone was just that kind of a guy. A man with a toothache was to him like a man drowning, he had to be rescued. But also Kaldone had read all of Ernest’s books and loved his work."|"Last Don"|"Mario Puzo"
00:00|midnight|"“Not really,” Kenneth said. “Unless you keep the mask on for a couple of days and maybe not even then. Of course, pure nitrous oxide will kill you in fifteen to thirty minutes. In fact about once a month I have a little midnight party in my office, carefully selected ‘beautiful people.’ All my patients, so I have their blood work. All healthy. The nitrous turns them on. Haven’t you felt sexual under the gas?”"|"Last Don"|"Mario Puzo"
00:00|midnight|"Kenneth said with wry humor, “I’m sure she’d forgive you. Why don’t you come by the office tomorrow at midnight? It’s really a lot of fun.” He saw Ernest looking scandalized and said, “Nitrous is not cocaine. Cocaine makes women sort of helpless. Nitrous just loosens them up. Just come as you would go to a cocktail party. You’re not committed to any action.”"|"Last Don"|"Mario Puzo"
00:00|midnight|"“Yes,” Athena said. Then she clapped her hands together, her green eyes shining. “Meanwhile, let’s have some fun. Let’s take care of ourselves. We’ll go upstairs and shower and jump into bed. We’ll make mad passionate love for hours. Then I’ll cook us a midnight supper.”"|"Last Don"|"Mario Puzo"
"ap ~ 08:00"|"About eight"|"“When?” Cross asked.
“About eight last night,” Petie said. “Giorgio called for you.”
Cross thought, While I was making love, my father was lying in the morgue. He felt an extraordinary contempt for his moment of weakness, an overwhelming shame. “I have to go,” he said to Athena."|"Last Don"|"Mario Puzo"
00:00|midnight|"He said nothing of this when he spent the night with her that night in Malibu. After they had made love and she was cooking their midnight supper, she said, “I wasn’t very good today, was I?” She gave him her catlike grin, which always sent a shock of pleasure through him. “I didn’t want to show you my best moves,” she said. “I knew you’d be standing there trying to figure me out.”"|"Last Don"|"Mario Puzo"
10:00|"ten in the morning"|"They went from the plane to a small hotel off Georges-Mandel Avenue. They had a suite with two separate bedrooms, one for Cross and one for Athena and Bethany, the sitting room between them. It was ten in the morning; Athena removed her wig and makeup and changed her clothes. She could not bear to be homely in Paris."|"Last Don"|"Mario Puzo"
12:00|noon|"At noon the three of them were in the doctor’s office, a small chateau set on its own grounds and enclosed by an iron fence. There was a guard at the gate, and after checking their names he let them in."|"Last Don"|"Mario Puzo"
"ap 04:00"|four|"At four, Cross was back in the doctor’s sitting room. They were waiting for him. Bethany was poring over the book of painting, Athena was pale, the only physical sign that Cross knew could not be acting. Bethany was also gobbling a plate of pastries, and the doctor took it away from her, saying something in French. Bethany did not protest. A nurse came then to take her to the playroom."|"Last Don"|"Mario Puzo"

At which the guests hooted derisively and made vulgar remarks. All in high spirits and good humor."|"Last Don"|"Mario Puzo"
00:00|midnight|"At midnight they gathered together in the huge dining room of the Santadio mansion. Pippi had a suitcase full of Rolex watches (genuine, not knockoffs). There was also a large Japanese kimono studded with hand-painted sexual scenes of Oriental lovemaking."|"Last Don"|"Mario Puzo"
"ap 03:00"|three|"The Messalina people would not begin to arrive until three, and then he would see Athena for the last time if things went wrong.

She shot a double for Stallings and used a shadow over his face for disguise. It was nearly three in the afternoon before the camera truck, the huge mobile trailers that served as homes on the set, the mobile catering kitchens, the wardrobe trailers and vehicles carrying weapons of the time before Christ, rolled into Vegas. Many others came as well, because Cross had treated this occasion in the Old Vegas style."|"Last Don"|"Mario Puzo"

Only Cross declined, claiming pressure of duties at the Hotel on this special night."|"Last Don"|"Mario Puzo"
17:00|"five P.M."|"Skippy Deere outlined the story with great enthusiasm. Nobody could sell a nonexistent property better. In a moment of pure exhilaration, he picked up the phone and, before Bantz could protest, invited the detective to the five P.M. cocktail party. Losey asked if he could bring a friend, and Deere assured him he could, assuming it was a girlfriend. Skippy Deere, as a producer of films, liked to mix different worlds together. You never knew what miracle might emerge."|"Last Don"|"Mario Puzo"

There was a premiere seating section that consisted of soft armchairs with a telephone console in the middle. There was one empty seat with a wreath of flowers bearing Steve Stallings’s name. The other seats held Claudia, Dita Tommey, and Bobby Bantz and his companion, Johanna, Melo Stuart and Liza. Skippy Deere immediately took possession of the phone."|"Last Don"|"Mario Puzo"
