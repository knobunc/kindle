the fact that this book clearly states that cats should have short
names you don't mind yelling to the neighbourhood at midnight, The
Unadulterated Cat is dedicated to:"|"The Unadulterated Cat"|"Terry Pratchett"
"~ 00:00"|"around midnight"|"Which
brings us to the most important consideration in the naming of cats:
never give a cat a name you wouldn't mind shouting out in a strained,
worried voice around midnight while banging a tin bowl with a spoon.
Stick to something short."|"The Unadulterated Cat"|"Terry Pratchett"

o'clock"|"No,
not a thing. You might think you can, but that is because you've
misunderstood what's going on. You
think it's the cat turning up obediently at the back door at ten
o'clock on the dot for its dinner. From the cat's point, a blob on
legs has been trained to take a tin out of the fridge every night."|"The Unadulterated Cat"|"Terry Pratchett"

comes, but not accompanied by Real cat. Familiar midnight
performance, standing outside back door banging plate with spoon and
calling out cat's name in squeaky voice, you know how you do, in
tones that you hope will attract cat while not waking neighbours.
Fancy takes hold, fears of lorries, foxes, traps float across mind.
	Answer rises with dreadful inevitability, like boiling milk. Take
torch, put on dressing gown, pad through dewy grass to picture window
of neighbour's house. Cat is sitting dribbling on dining table,
watching vibrating gerbil colony, which is going mad. 	Treadmills are
squeaking frantically in the night."|"The Unadulterated Cat"|"Terry Pratchett"

Car screams into service area car park. Near-hysterical man staggers
out with plastic bowl, spoon, lurches around the car park trying to
look as nonchalant as is possible concurrent with banging a bowl with
a spoon and shouting 'Pusspaws!' in a strained falsetto (he was not,
at that time, a paid-up member of the Campaign; if he had been, he'd
have been wise to this sort of event and would have changed the cat's
name to something like 'Wat!' or 'Zip!) An hour goes past. Leaves
telephone number with least unsympathetic of the waitresses, drives
back, visions of family pet laminated to fast lane ..."|"The Unadulterated Cat"|"Terry Pratchett"

theories don't come into it. Real cats are survivalists. They've got
it down to a fine art. What other animal gets fed, not because it's
useful, or guards the house, or sings, but because when it does
get fed it looks pleased? And purrs. The purr is very important. It's
the purr that does it every time. It's the purr that makes up for the
Things Under the Bed, the occasional pungency, the 4 a.m. yowl."|"The Unadulterated Cat"|"Terry Pratchett"
