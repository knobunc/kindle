15:00|"three o'clock in the afternoon"|"An inn, of course, was a place you came to at night (not at three o'clock in the afternoon), preferably a rainy night—wind, too, if it could be managed; and it should be situated on a moor (""bleak,"" Kate knew, was the adjective here). And there should be scullions; mine host should be gravy-stained and broad in the beam with a tousled apron pulled across his stomach; and there should be a tall, dark stranger—the one who speaks to nobody—warming thin hands before the fire. And the fire should be a fire—crackling and blazing, laid with an impossible size log and roaring its great heart out up the chimney. And there should be some sort of cauldron, Kate felt, somewhere about—and, perhaps, a couple of mastiffs thrown in for good measure."|"The Borrowers Afield"|"Mary Norton"
12:00|mid-day|"It was a weary traipse. Their only adventure was at mid-day, when they rested after a frugal luncheon of rain-sodden, over-ripe blackberries. Homily, lying back against the bank, her drowsy eyes fixed on the space between a stone and a log, saw the ground begin to move: it streamed past the gap, in a limited but constant flow."|"The Borrowers Afield"|"Mary Norton"
"< 12:00"|"Toward mid-day"|"Toward mid-day, they smelt a savory smell—the gamey smell of stew: it would drift toward them as the wind veered and then, tormentingly, would drift away."|"The Borrowers Afield"|"Mary Norton"
