"ap ~ 00:55"|"approximately five-to-one"|"""Yes, Ma'am."" Ortiz nodded and glanced down, tapping keys to scroll through the notes in her memo pad, then looked back up. ""This next portion is the real reason I asked ATC to make the main tank available to us, Ma'am. What you're about to see is a recreation of the relevant portion of the actual engagement, drawn from the sensor logs of all surviving units of Task Group Hancock-Zero-Zero-One. There are holes in the data, due to the task group's heavy losses, but we've been able to fill most of them by interpolating captured data from Admiral Chin's dreadnoughts. Using that information, ATC's computers have generated the equivalent of a combat information center display at a time compression of - "" Ortiz glanced back at her memo pad "" - approximately five-to-one, beginning shortly before Admiral Sarnow was wounded."""|"Field of Dishonor"|"David Weber"

The empathic 'cats had always been able to sense human emotions, but as far as she knew, no other human had ever been able to sense a 'cat's emotions in return. She certainly hadn't been able to do so, not with any reliability, until two T-years ago, and her sensitivity to Nimitz's feelings was still growing.
