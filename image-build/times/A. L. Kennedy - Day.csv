"ap 10:56"|10.56|"But at 10.56, down he’d gone. He’d been standing to attention in a mocked-up Appell: everyone out on parade for the fake Nazis and a camera grinding by on rails, peering at the ranks in one direction and then sneaking back like an untrusting sergeant, inspecting them again. Meanwhile, the actors had this or that to say and this or that to do – he was too far away to catch the details. Then along came 10.56 and the colour dropped out of his morning, while his head pulled him down and forward through the usual, opening hole and he tried to slacken out his limbs, to roll into the impact he wouldn’t feel."|Day|"A.

"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"That Sunday morning in September, the weather so good, looking set for an Indian summer, and the church bells sounding and a conscious stillness up beyond them, a sweet ache of a day – he wouldn’t forget any part of it. He’d sat with his ma in the kitchen – she couldn’t go to chapel because of the pain in her leg and that wasn’t good, it made a familiar rawness in at the back of his thoughts, still Alfred and his ma, they kept things cheery. They were fine. They were being comfy together and they’d eaten their sausage, eggs and bacon, not talking much because they never had to, and everything today could be late and slow – they’d get away with that – and they were having extra toast – he didn’t know then she made the best bread he’d ever taste – and the house would be at rest for another two hours, at least. The back door was open and the smell of their last roses coming in and a wedge of sunshine fallen down into the hall with the cat lying in it and purring, you could tell by the set of his head before you even heard a sound. Then Chamberlain comes on the wireless and Alfred had never liked him, never taken to the tone of him – the way he seemed like some thin, grey relative you wouldn’t want to sit with, all his sentences fading away and breaking if his voice went low and everything being so sad and hard for him, even though there were other people in the world who weren’t enjoying themselves that much. Like the Czechs. Or the Poles. You could bet they weren’t happy. But here was Chamberlain in the Cabinet room – which Alfred imagined to be like a kind of parlour: Mansion Polish and china dogs – and he was saying in his pretty accent that he’d had a bitter blow and there was nothing else for it now but to be at war. He’d needed to hear from the Germans by eleven o’clock and eleven o’clock was gone. Which suited Alfred nicely, thanks ever so much."|Day|"A. L. Kennedy"
19:00|"seven this evening"|"As they did, Alfred stretched up to meet the idea of himself standing, which seemed a little slower than it had been at seven this evening. ‘I’ll get . . . the same.’"|Day|"A. L. Kennedy"
"ap 00:00"|twelve|"‘I’ll find it.’ He didn’t for a moment think he could.
‘At twelve?’
‘I’ll be there.’"|Day|"A. L. Kennedy"
"ap > 06:00"|"past six"|"And when you trip the bell on the door, it’s past six and he’s waiting inside a deserted shop. You suspect the place may have been empty all day – he does not look inviting."|Day|"A. L. Kennedy"
15:00|"1500 hours"|"Miles gives Hanson the nod and it’s the Bastard who explains that you’ll rendezvous at 1500 hours and there’ll be a kind of service before they take the last of your Pluckrose away, boxed up like cod."|Day|"A. L. Kennedy"
"ap < 06:00"|"nearly six o’clock"|"‘No, I’m just thinking . . . would tomorrow do? I could come tomorrow. I mean, it’s nearly six o’clock now. Are you all right? Are you hurt? Is there something –’"|Day|"A. L. Kennedy"
16:30|16.30|"‘Clean that bloody mess up, will you.’ Chiefy in a rush. ‘Don’t just stand there. Inspection at 16.30 tomorrow.’ And he two-sixed their man off."|Day|"A. L. Kennedy"
"ap ~ 09:00"|"about nine o’clock"|"Vasyl caught Alfred about nine o’clock, ran across the junction between huts that a bright and patriotic spark had christened Charing Cross – but after the one in Glasgow, apparently. ‘I saw when you were talking to that German cunt.’ A kind of anguish in the Ukrainian’s face and the evening falling down at his shoulder – colours heating, deepening."|Day|"A. L. Kennedy"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"‘Almost time.’ As she leads you towards a wall, a complication of dark, carved wood, stonework. ‘Evensong. Just what I could do with.’ Chap in a long blue shift nodding and waving you along to a side door and the church within the church, what she tells you is the choir."|Day|"A. L. Kennedy"
"~ 16:30"|evensong|"The evensong rubbish hadn’t seemed so bad then. I’d slung it back up to the boys – couldn’t do any harm."|Day|"A. L. Kennedy"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"So at five o’clock, they had settled down to eat, looking about themselves and finding they had almost all made the same decision to change out of their uniforms and make the best they could of their civvies. Shoes had been polished, hair fussed at, shirts ironed – they seemed to have become both less and more military and were quiet with each other, as if they were not quite who they’d thought."|Day|"A. L. Kennedy"
"ap < 10:00"|"almost ten o’clock"|"As had been planned, Alfred didn’t get up to sing until it was almost ten o’clock. Hovering in the wings while ‘Yours’ and ‘That Lovely Weekend’ got hooted briskly across a table full of more and less empty bottles. The audience, he could feel, was admiring, but not exactly entertained. And by now they were fairly drunk."|Day|"A. L. Kennedy"
"> 20:00"|"past eight in the evening"|"It’s past eight in the evening before you reach the shop. Walking up the street towards it, the passers-by with no idea of where you’ve been, the smell of somewhere else on your skin: it makes you feel younger and excitable for about as long as it takes to rap and then batter on the door, stir up Ivor from his wireless in the back room."|Day|"A. L. Kennedy"
"ap > 00:00"|"past twelve"|"And a little later, you will go back over to Ivor’s shop and find it still closed, although – when you check – it’s past twelve. You will rap on the glass until he shambles round between the shelves and lets you in."|Day|"A. L. Kennedy"
