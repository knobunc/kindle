12:00|noon|"“The sun,” he said. “As it rises, the heat drives the mists back
into the valleys, forces them to surrender the mountains they’ve conquered during
the night. The mists sink, and one by one the peaks come into view. By noon the
whole range is visible for miles and miles. There’s nothing like it on Earth, or
anywhere else.”"|"A Song for Lya"|"George R. R. Martin"
"< 00:00"|"Nearly midnight"|"September 18
Nearly midnight. No sign of the Charon. What’s wrong?
Nothing, probably. These schedules are never precise. Sometimes
as much as a week off. So why do I worry? Hell, I was late getting here myself.
I wonder what the poor guy I replaced was thinking then?"|"A Song for Lya"|"George R. R. Martin"
12:00|noon|"Kabaraijian smiled. “I never thought you did. If you do hear anything,
though, let me know. We’re not going to go without a fight.” He looked at Cochran.
“What are you doing here so early? Usually you’re not up until the crack of noon.”"|"A Song for Lya"|"George R. R. Martin"

slow and easy. It was two A.M. before I pulled into town. The exit ramp, like the
rest of the road, was cracked and darkened. And there was no sign to mark it."|"A Song for Lya"|"George R. R. Martin"
"~ 00:00"|"around midnight"|"Yet, around midnight, there was a peculiar whistling sound in
the distance. It built quickly, until it was right on top of me, and then faded
away equally fast."|"A Song for Lya"|"George R. R. Martin"
"< 12:00"|"toward noon"|"So Lya and I enjoyed the scenery, or as much as we could enjoy
during the five-minute flight from spaceport to Tower. The aircar was whisking down
the main street at treetop level, stirring up a breeze that whipped the thin branches
as we went by. It was cool and dark in the interior of the car, but outside the
Shkeen sun was riding toward noon, and you could see the heat waves shimmering from
the pavement. The population must have been inside huddled around their air conditioners,
because we saw very little traffic."|"A Song for Lya"|"George R. R. Martin"
