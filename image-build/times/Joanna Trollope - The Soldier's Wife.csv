"ap ~ 03:30"|"about three thirty"|"She wasn’t sure how she would have got through the day, if it hadn’t been for Franny. Franny just appeared, after breakfast, and looked at the girls and said, ‘Round to mine, babies,’ to the twins, and ‘I need you,’ to Isabel, and then she said to Alexa, ‘I’ll bring them back about three thirty.’"|"The Soldier's Wife"|"Joanna Trollope"
"ap 07:45"|"seven forty-five"|"Alexa pulled the door shut until there was only a crack for the light from the landing to shine through. She stood for a moment, eyes closed, collecting herself, and then she walked slowly down the narrow landing and even more slowly down the stairs. Dan had said that he hoped – hoped – to be home by seven. It was now seven forty-five. She had promised herself that she would greet him without a hint of reproach, however late he was, not least because she wanted to talk to him – the kind of talking that required both participants in the conversation to focus – about Isabel."|"The Soldier's Wife"|"Joanna Trollope"

"ap 01:47"|"one forty-seven"|"The digital clock on the front of the radio by her side of the bed read one forty-seven in angular green numbers. Beside her, on his back, one arm flung above his head and one down by his side, where it had slipped an hour ago from resting on her hip, Dan lay in apparently profound and tranquil sleep. Shortly after midnight, he had begun twitching and muttering in his sleep and had let out a yelp or two, and then laughed, and Alexa had put her arms round him and held him, and said the soothing and anodyne things she said to the twins, until he relaxed against her and then turned to lie on his back, like a knight on a tomb, one hand on her hip. She had lain, still and wakeful, beside him for over an hour until the urge to turn over became irresistible and she had rolled gently away, feeling his hand slip limply from her and lie against her back as impersonally as if it had nothing to do with either of them."|"The Soldier's Wife"|"Joanna Trollope"

02:00|"two in the morning"|"Almost an hour further on into this long night and she was still awake. When Dan had been away and she couldn’t sleep, Alexa had devised rules to prevent herself picturing a situation she could only imagine in a landscape she could only imagine and Dan, in some terrible state of mind, or body, or both, in the thick of it. But tonight, with his physical presence heavily beside her, no anxiety-prevention rules seemed to hold any sway over her scurrying mind. She should not have confided in George about the lost job. Or if she had, she should not have emphasized that she had decided not to take it because of the exigencies of Army life. Neither should she have described the visit to try and rescue Isabel, or blamed Dan’s skewed priorities for the failure of that mission. George had stood beside her at the sink, drying the pans and utensils she had dumped, dripping, on to the draining board, and listened. She might have consoled herself by reminding herself that Dan had gone back to the garrison yet again, because of some trouble in the blocks, and that George could always have indicated that he didn’t want to hear any more, but two in the morning was no time for consolation of any kind. She had abused George’s affection for her, and she had been disloyal to Dan, and she felt terrible about both. Almost as terrible, in fact, as she did about not getting a job because she was in no position to accept it."|"The Soldier's Wife"|"Joanna Trollope"
21:00|"nine o’clock at night"|"‘You can tell me,’ George said. ‘I’ve been a soldier and I’ve been in charge of them. What took you behind the wire at nine o’clock at night?’"|"The Soldier's Wife"|"Joanna Trollope"

George put the duster down. ‘We need to leave at two forty.’

"< 12:00"|"before midday"|"When the telephone had rung mid-morning, Elaine had supposed that it would be her friend Verity, calling to confirm matinée tickets for the National Theatre. Verity had said she would ring before midday, and she was the kind of person who telephoned when she said she would, as well as being the kind of person who made arrangements, down to the smallest detail, months in advance of any activity, and became personally offended at the mere suggestion of any subsequent change. Plans made with Verity could be relied upon with utter confidence to work, but also carried an undertone of menace."|"The Soldier's Wife"|"Joanna Trollope"

"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"‘No,’ he said, ‘I really don’t.

"ap 02:22"|"Two twenty-two"|"He picked up his wristwatch from the bedside table and peered at the illuminated dial. Two twenty-two. He put the watch down and closed his eyes with resolution. If only – if only the two of them hadn’t looked, that evening, in their various ways, so lonely."|"The Soldier's Wife"|"Joanna Trollope"
20:00|"Eight o’clock at night"|"She felt the same now, walking up Procter Street and Drake Street towards Theobald’s Road. If she could set aside her feelings about Dan and somehow manage to banish, just for a few hours, the toothache of anxiety about Isabel, she could, perhaps, be for this evening the person she really was, under all the onion layers of relativity in her life. She would, she thought, stop somewhere and buy wine and flowers. Eight o’clock at night, and there were places still open all around her, selling wine and flowers. Life, she thought, needn’t stop just because darkness had fallen. Any kind of darkness, in fact."|"The Soldier's Wife"|"Joanna Trollope"

"ap 10:29"|"ten twenty-nine"|"So here he was, in barrack-room dress, in the drive of Ranpur House, at ten twenty-nine. The house reared up above him, solidly, uncompromisingly Edwardian, red brick with cream stone trimmings, the drive darkly shaded by a funereal stand of larch trees. On the sill of the bay window of the sitting room, he could see a jade tree in an oriental pot and two soapstone elephants tramping towards it, one on either side. Mack liked things symmetrical. It was probably one reason for choosing Mary as his wife. She was very pretty in as tidy a way as their sitting-room ornaments."|"The Soldier's Wife"|"Joanna Trollope"
"ap < 09:00"|"almost nine o’clock"|"It was almost nine o’clock when Alexa heard the car wheels crunching on the drive. Dan had texted to say that they were having tea, and then again a bit later to say that they were in a pub, and then a third time to say that they were bringing fish and chips home with them. In the meantime, she and Isabel had bathed the twins and read to them, put appropriately unfeminine sheets on Isabel’s bed for George, and had several stilted small conversations in which any real communication was rendered impossible by Alexa’s strenuous efforts not to ask questions."|"The Soldier's Wife"|"Joanna Trollope"
