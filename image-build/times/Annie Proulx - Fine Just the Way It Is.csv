The slippers were a gift from his only granddaughter, Beth, married to Kevin Bead. Beth was important to him. He had made up his mind to tell her the ugly family secret. He would not leave his descendants to grapple with shameful uncertainties. He was going to clear the air. Beth was coming on Saturday afternoon with her tape recorder to help him get it said. During the week she would type it into her computer and bring him the crisp printed pages. He might have been nothing more than a ranch hand in his life, but he knew a few things."|"Fine Just the Way It Is"|"Annie Proulx"

00:00|midnight|"Duane Fork, the Devil’s demon secretary, rushed around readying the suite of offices. He sprinkled grit and dust on the desktops, gravel on the floor, pulled closed the heavy red velvet drapes and sprayed the room with Eau de Fumier. Precisely on the dot of midnight he heard the familiar hoof steps coming down the hallway and drew up to attention."|"Fine Just the Way It Is"|"Annie Proulx"
12:00|noon|"“Still think it was the right way to do, but we sure need some chink. I’m ridin to talk with Bunk in a few days, see can I get hired on again.” He pulled on his dirty digging pants still spattered with mud from the three-day job of the privy pit. “Don’t git me no dinner. I’ll dig until noon and come in for coffee. We got coffee yet?”"|"Fine Just the Way It Is"|"Annie Proulx"
"~ 00:00"|"Around midnight"|"She woke one morning exhausted and sweaty and went down to the Little Weed hoping for night-cooled water. There was a dark cloud to the south and she was glad to hear the distant rumble of thunder. In anticipation she set out the big kettle and two buckets to catch rainwater. The advance wind came in, thrashing tree branches and ripping leaves. The grass went sidewise. Lightning danced on the crest of Barrel Mountain, and then a burst of hail swallowed up the landscape in a chattering, roaring sweep. She ran inside and watched the ice pellets flail the river rocks and slowly give way to thrumming rain. The rocks disappeared in the foam of rising water. Almost as quickly as it had started the rain stopped, a few last hailstones fell and against the moving cloud the arc of a double rainbow promised everything. Her buckets were full of sweet water and floating hailstones. She stripped and poured dippers of goose-bump water over her head again and again until one bucket was nearly empty and she was shaking. The air was as cool and fresh as September, the heat broken. Around midnight the rain began again, slow and steady. Half awake she could hear it dripping on the stone doorstep."|"Fine Just the Way It Is"|"Annie Proulx"
"~ 12:00"|"Around noon"|"“Look like you kept pretty good,” he said. But the cat sniffed at the bacon, went to the door and, when he opened it, returned to the woods. “Probly shacked up with a bobcat,” he said, “got the taste for wild meat.” Around noon he saddled the horse and headed for the McLaverty cabin."|"Fine Just the Way It Is"|"Annie Proulx"
12:00|noontime|"The head office, seeing production, income and profits slump because they could not keep workers on, hired a cook who had worked for an Italian restaurant. The food improved dramatically, but there was still an exodus. The cook ordered exotic ingredients that were delivered by a huge Speedy Food truck. After the driver delivered the cases of sauce and mushrooms, he parked in the shade of the big sagebrush to eat his noontime bologna sandwich, read a chapter of Ambush on the Pecos Trail and take a short nap. Three drillers coming in from the day shift noticed the truck idling in the shade. They noticed it again the next morning on the way to the rig. A refrigerator truck, it was still running. A call came three days later from the company asking if their driver had been there. The news that the truck was still in the sagebrush brought state troopers. After noticing spots of blood on the seat and signs of a struggle (a dusty boot print on the inside of the windshield), they began stringing crime-scene tape around the truck and the sagebrush."|"Fine Just the Way It Is"|"Annie Proulx"
"ap ~ 03:00"|"Around three o’clock"|"They spent the day driving from one homestead site to another, horned larks running before them on the roads, flying up only at the last moment. They walked over acres of level ground that seemed much the same to Helen. Around three o’clock they stopped and rested in the shade of the car. Bewley took a dripping basket from the back. Inside were three apples, chunks of melting ice, six bottles of beer and two of sarsaparilla. Bewley and Hi each drank two beers. Helen walked to a draw out of sight of the car to relieve herself, and as she started back she saw the two men were doing the same, standing side by side, separated by a polite distance of eight or ten feet."|"Fine Just the Way It Is"|"Annie Proulx"

She put them in the oven at seven, aiming at midafternoon. Verla brought side dishes and relishes—pickled black walnuts, red pepper relish, vinegar pie and a dish of Hattie Bailey, which she and Helen remembered from Thanksgiving at their paternal grandmother’s house."|"Fine Just the Way It Is"|"Annie Proulx"
"ap 04:00"|four|"He picked her up at four on Sunday morning and drove north. By sunrise she had figured it out: “Seven Devils?” He nodded. And he was right. She had never been on the Dice Roll trail.

"~ 12:00"|"Around noon"|"After several miles of level ground the trail began to climb and twist in a steep stairway of roots and rocks. Snowmelt had scoured it out to slick earth packed around bony flints. Around noon the trail broke into an explosion of wildflowers—columbine, penstemon, beautiful Clarkia, chickweed and Indian paintbrush. Delighted by the alpine meadow and a few banks of snow packed into clefts on the north sides of slopes, she looked down at a small lake. The scene was exquisitely beautiful. But even here it was not as cool as she had expected. The sun was strong and a cloud of gnats and mosquitoes warped around her in elliptical flight. She ate her lunch sitting in the shade of a giant boulder. She did not miss Marc."|"Fine Just the Way It Is"|"Annie Proulx"
"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"On the next day around noon she reached a church-size rock about a hundred feet from a tan lake, really more cliff than rock, an interlocking system of glistening pink house-size chunks of granite cracked and fractured into blocks and shelves so huge a few young pines had found enough soil to keep them alive. Their forcing roots would split the rock in time. The ground between the cliff and the lake was littered with a talus of fallen boulders. A few miles away bare scree-covered slopes protruded from the gnarled krummholz, marking the trail’s maximum height. She did not want to hike up there in late afternoon, to be forced by darkness to camp in the lightning zone. Even now torn grey clouds slid over the naked peaks. The map showed the tallest as “Tolbert Mountain.” The sun was halfway down the western sky. She would quit for the day and camp here. She eased off her backpack and let it drop heavily to the trail. It made a hard clank. The trail here crossed a vast sheet of granite half a mile wide. To be free from the familiar weight was a luxury and she stretched."|"Fine Just the Way It Is"|"Annie Proulx"
12:00|noon|"The sun’s warmth, so pleasant and grateful, became heat, burning her exposed arms, her neck and face. The eagles screamed overhead. By noon her smarting skin and clamorous thirst overshadowed the injured leg. Her eyes were scratchy and hot, and she had to blink to see the distant scree cones that seemed to pulse in the heat. By sunset those naked peaks had changed to heaps of glowing metal shavings. Several times throughout the day she imagined Marc’s approach and called out to him. A fox ran up toward the snowbank with something in its mouth."|"Fine Just the Way It Is"|"Annie Proulx"
"ap > 09:00"|"past nine o’clock"|"For Verl Lister everything turned on luck, and he had experienced very little of the good kind. His secret boyhood dream had been to become a charismatic radio man meeting singing personalities, giving the news, announcing songs, describing the weather. All of this grew from a small, cheap radio he had earned as a boy selling Rosebud salve, riding ranch to ranch on an aged mare. At night, forbidden to listen past nine o’clock, he put it under the covers and turned it whisper low, listening to honey-voiced Paul Kallinger on a high-watt border station, the lonely hearts club ads, pitches for tonics and elixirs, yodeling cowboys, and, by the time he was in his teens, Wolfman Jack of scandalous sex talk and panting and howls. Yet he never wanted to be like Wolfman Jack. Kallinger was his ideal."|"Fine Just the Way It Is"|"Annie Proulx"

"ap ~ 04:00"|"around four o’clock"|"He seemed a little excited, putting steaks in a Pyrex dish and shaking Tabasco and Texas barbecue sauce onto them, sprinkling coarse salt and pepper. He made a long, rectangular fire on the ground, cowboy style, saying it would burn down to a good bed of coals. He told Dakotah to get some potatoes ready for baking. Dakotah caught some of his excitement; it was a vacation from Bonita and her rules, a kind of picnic for her and Verl. But around four o’clock the real reason for the steaks showed up—Harlan, Verl’s brother who worked for the Bureau of Land Management in Crack Springs. Harlan was short and muscular and very quiet. His hair was longer than Verl’s. He wore brown plastic-framed glasses. Whenever he visited conversation died away and they all stared at the curtains or picked at their cuticles until someone, usually Bonita, said, “Well, I got to get somethin done,” rose and left the room. But now, without Bonita, a kind of conversation sprang up between the two brothers, a discussion of an old schoolmate who had been indicted for embezzling the town’s Arbor Day tree fund. While the fire sank into shimmering coals they sat on the ground and drank the whiskey, then Verl laid the two steaks directly on the coals. Clouds of fragrant smoke spread out and after a minute he stabbed the meat with a long-handled fork and turned it over. Black coals and ash stuck to the charred steaks. Harlan held out a tin pie pan and Verl got the meat onto it. They went into the kitchen. Neither of them said anything to Dakotah until she put the baked potatoes on the table with the butter dish. She had figured out that the steaks were only for the men."|"Fine Just the Way It Is"|"Annie Proulx"
12:00|noon|"The next morning was somewhat easier; they could all drink hot coffee. Mourning, grief and loss were somehow eased by hot, black coffee. But still no one could eat. At noon Dakotah left Verl and Bonita and went for a walk up the pine slope. A new power line ran through the slashed trees."|"Fine Just the Way It Is"|"Annie Proulx"
