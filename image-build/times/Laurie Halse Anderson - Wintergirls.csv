Practice starts at five.”

"ap 01:20"|1:20|"“Oh, God.”
From 1:20 to 2:55, she hung up fifteen times.

"ap 07:30"|7:30|"I walk back to my car, get in, turn on the heat, and wipe  my  face  on  my  shirt.  7:30.  Emma  is  done  with French now and is unpacking her violin. She’ll spend too much time rosining her bow, and not enough tuning the strings. The Winter Concert is coming up in a few weeks, and she doesn’t know the songs yet. I should help her with that."|Wintergirls|"Laurie Halse Anderson"
"ap 07:35"|7:35|"Cassie thought heaven was a fairy tale for stupid people. How can you find a place you don’t believe in? You can’t. So where does she go now? What if she comes back, eyes on angryfire?
7:35. Time to go to school and stop thinking.
No Honors Option for me, not this year. I am Contemp World Lit, Soc Sci 12—The Holocaust, Physics, Trig (again), and Lunch. No gym, thanks to a magic note from Dr. Parker. There are asterisks next to my name and footnotes that explain the situation."|Wintergirls|"Laurie Halse Anderson"
"ap > 06:30"|"After six thirty"|"“What time is it?”
“Duh,” says Emma. “After six thirty.”
My room smells like dirty laundry and old candles, not spices or burnt sugar. I plant my face in the pillow."|Wintergirls|"Laurie Halse Anderson"
"ap 09:11"|911|"I  spin  away  from  him,  squeezing  my  eyes  shut.  Everything in my body hurts, like I have the flu, or the air seeping out of room 113 infected me with something. My heart slams against its bone cage, over and over, blood seeping down to the cracks in the ground.
“I checked for a pulse,” he continues. “Called 911.”
“Stop it,” I whisper."|Wintergirls|"Laurie Halse Anderson"
"ap 02:00"|two|"I take a whole wheat roll (96) out of the basket and two buttery Brussels sprouts (35), even though I hate them. In jenniferland I am An Example and must take at least two bites of everything. I set the roll on the edge of the plate, Brussels sprouts at two and four o’clock, equidistant. I stand up so I can reach the cheesy potatoes and plop a disgusting orange spoonful (70) next to the turkey."|Wintergirls|"Laurie Halse Anderson"

Just as I’m ready to head down to the basement to burn away my leg muscles until the sun comes up to exercise mod-erately for twenty minutes so I’ll sleep better, Dad comes clumping down the stairs and into the kitchen. I hear the refrigerator open, then a long spray of whipped cream."|Wintergirls|"Laurie Halse Anderson"
"ap 05:45"|5:45|"No. It’s the sheet trapped over my face. I rip it off and get out of the bed as fast as I can. The house is dark, 5:45."|Wintergirls|"Laurie Halse Anderson"

"ap 10:00"|ten|"I did win one thing today. I shot the moon in hearts and beat Elijah. I’m picking him up at ten tomorrow. Neither one of us is up to the memorial service at the funeral home.

00:00|Midnight|"I sit behind the mountain of individually wrapped marshmallow treats. The band is playing either “Silent Night” or “It Came Upon a Midnight Clear.” I scan up and down the hall. Cassie has not popped up, not yet. There’s no snow in sight. It does smell like gingerbread, but that’s because of the bake sale. I don’t think she’s coming, not with her face stapled to the bulletin board like a WANTED"|Wintergirls|"Laurie Halse Anderson"
"ap 10:00"|"Ten o’clock"|"He picks up the magic wand and tilts it so the sparkles run down the inside, perfectly sealed in plastic. “Ten o’clock, two days after Christmas.”"|Wintergirls|"Laurie Halse Anderson"
00:00|midnight|"Elijah: I played cards with Charlie until midnight and decided to go downtown. Cassie saw me walking by and opened the door, crying her eyes out and babbling about Lia being mad at her, Lia won’t answer. I told her to sleep it off. She wouldn’t leave me alone until I wrote down your  phone  number  and  promised  to  give  you  her  message. I got out of there as fast as I could."|Wintergirls|"Laurie Halse Anderson"

She nods once, eyes staring into the storm."|Wintergirls|"Laurie Halse Anderson"

"ap 02:00"|two|"At two I turn on the television and knit, back and forth, back and forth, making the half knots and twists that pull it all together on the long needles. I knit the afternoon away. I knit reasons for Elijah to come back. I knit apologies for Emma. I knit angry knots and slipped stitches for every mistake I ever made, and I knit wet, swollen stitches that look awful. I knit the sun down."|Wintergirls|"Laurie Halse Anderson"
00:00|midnight|"No games this time. No midnight exercise parties in the shower for me. No dumping my food in the plants or sticking it in my underwear or bribing an attendant to lie about my intake. I avoid the drama of the girls still neck-deep in the snow, running away from the pain as fast as they can. I hope they figure it out."|Wintergirls|"Laurie Halse Anderson"
