Futurist Edmond Kirsch to announce discovery that will change the face of science forever."|Origin|"Dan Brown"
"ap 08:15"|"eight fifteen"|"“Through those doors, Edmond Kirsch has constructed an ‘experiential space’ in which to present his dynamic multimedia presentation tonight. It is fully automated by computers and will be streamed live around the entire world.” She paused to check her gold watch. “Tonight’s event is carefully timed, and Edmond has asked that I get you all inside so we can begin precisely at eight fifteen, which is only minutes away.” She pointed to the double doors. “So if you would, ladies and gentlemen, please move inside, and we will see what the amazing Edmond Kirsch has in store for us.”"|Origin|"Dan Brown"
"ap 07:59"|"one of eight"|"THE SZÉCHENYI CHAIN Bridge—one of eight bridges in Budapest—spans more than a thousand feet across the Danube. An emblem of the link between East and West, the bridge is considered one of the most beautiful in the world."|Origin|"Dan Brown"
"ap 07:30"|"seven thirty"|"The next morning, at seven thirty, Ambra found herself on a television soundstage, engaged in a surprisingly comfortable on-air chat with the three charming Telediario hosts. She was so caught up in her enthusiasm for the Guggenheim that she barely noticed the television cameras and the live studio audience, or remembered that five million people were watching at home."|Origin|"Dan Brown"
00:00|midnight|"Five nights ago, Ávila had been asleep in his modest apartment when he was awoken by the loud ping of an arriving text message on his cell phone. “It’s midnight,” he grumbled, hazily squinting at the screen to find out who had contacted him at this hour."|Origin|"Dan Brown"
00:00|midnight|"The basilica’s sun-dappled forest of trees was gone, transformed into a midnight jungle of shadows and darkness—a gloomy stand of striated columns stretching skyward into an ominous void."|Origin|"Dan Brown"
03:00|"three a.m."|"“Seventeen minutes,” Winston replied. “That would place the broadcast at the top of the hour—three a.m. here, and prime time across America.”"|Origin|"Dan Brown"
03:00|"3 a.m."|"A press release from Edmond Kirsch’s camp has just confirmed that his widely anticipated scientific discovery—withheld in the wake of the futurist’s assassination—will be streamed live to the world at the top of the hour (3 a.m. local time in Barcelona)."|Origin|"Dan Brown"
13:00|"one p.m."|"“It does not include me,” Winston replied matter-of-factly. “I am preprogrammed to self-delete at one p.m. on the day after Edmond’s death.”"|Origin|"Dan Brown"
"ap 01:00"|"One o’clock"|"“It makes perfect sense. One o’clock is the thirteenth hour, and Edmond’s feelings about superstition—”"|Origin|"Dan Brown"
13:00|"one p.m."|"“Excellent. You would, of course, need to call before I am deleted at one p.m.”"|Origin|"Dan Brown"
12:00|noon|"AS THE PALACE clocks struck noon, Mónica Martín gathered her notes and prepared to walk out to Plaza de la Almudena and address the assembled media."|Origin|"Dan Brown"
12:00|midday|"Sitting in a private cable car, suspended halfway up the mountain, Robert Langdon gazed down at the lush wooded landscape beneath him, relieved to be out of the city. I needed a change of perspective, he thought, savoring the calmness of the setting and the warmth of the midday sun."|Origin|"Dan Brown"
12:00|midday|"“Winston, stop. That’s morbid.” How much farther is this cable car ride? Langdon suddenly felt cramped in the tiny cabin. Ahead he saw only towers and cables as he squinted into the bright midday sun. I’m boiling, he thought, his mind spiraling in all kinds of strange directions now."|Origin|"Dan Brown"
13:00|"one p.m."|"According to Langdon, Edmond had created within E-Wave an astoundingly advanced AI program—“Winston”—that had been programmed to self-delete at one p.m. on the day following Kirsch’s death. Minutes ago, at Langdon’s insistence, Dr. Valero had been able to confirm that a significant sector of E-Wave’s databanks had indeed vanished at precisely that time. The deletion had been a full data “overwrite,” which rendered it irretrievable."|Origin|"Dan Brown"
