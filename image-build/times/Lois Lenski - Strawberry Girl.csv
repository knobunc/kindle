"ap ~ 05:00"|"about five"|"Mrs. Slater’s reply was followed by the clatter of dishes and the crying of the baby. A smaller girl, about five, came out and climbed up on her father’s lap."|"Strawberry Girl"|"Lois Lenski"
12:00|noon|"During recess they all played together as if they were old friends. At noon, Birdie and Dovey and Dan sat together under the live oak tree and ate their dinner. Other family groups were scattered here and there. Birdie opened the dinner bucket. It contained a bottle of cane syrup, pieces of fried rabbit and cooked hominy grits. They ate the grits with a spoon. They poured syrup from the bottle into the cover of the bucket and dipped their biscuits in it."|"Strawberry Girl"|"Lois Lenski"
12:00|noonday|"At noonday, the preacher announced in a loud voice: “Dinner on the grounds!” and everybody was dismissed. In the piney woods behind the church were rough board tables, covered with table cloths. The women opened their baskets and spread out their rations, all the delicious dishes of the Florida backwoods. There was food for everybody—fried chicken, rabbit, squirrel, ham, sweet potatoes, cowpeas, grits and gravy, cakes and pies, corn bread and biscuit and plenty of cane syrup. Everybody ate heartily, laughed and joked, and talked in loud voices."|"Strawberry Girl"|"Lois Lenski"

“Shoestring says they come out at twelve o’clock each day,” said Dan.
“Don’t believe it!” scoffed Birdie. “How they know what time it is?”"|"Strawberry Girl"|"Lois Lenski"

12:00|midday|"Birdie pounded Osceola and rode faster. When she reached home, she pulled up the horse and stared. The house was still standing, unharmed. The stepladder still stood by the outer wall, half of which shone pearly white in the midday sun. Pa and Buzz had come back and she saw with relief that they had the fire under control. It had moved far over to the right, beyond the farm buildings, into the scrub."|"Strawberry Girl"|"Lois Lenski"
