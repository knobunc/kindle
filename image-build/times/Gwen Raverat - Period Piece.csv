I still now feel that there is an unnatural gap in the landscape, where Foster's Mill used to stand before it was pulled down; and I find it hard to believe that the boys, who now sit fishing on the parapet, have no idea that there once was a great mill behind them. We used to spend many hours watching the fat corn-sacks being hauled up by a pulley into the overhanging gable, sometimes from a barge, but more often from the great yellow four-horse wagons, which stood beneath the trapdoor. The sacks butted the trapdoors open with their own noses, and the doors fell to, with a loud clap, behind them. At night there was a watchman in the mill who used to divert himself by trying to play the flute. It was a doleful sound to hear at three in the morning, especially as he had not advanced very far in his studies. My father, always a bad sleeper, was much worried by his aimless tootlings, but felt it would be cruel to protest; however, in the end, they came to an agreement which suited them both."|"Period Piece"|"Gwen Raverat"

And on Saturdays, market days, the farmers came trotting by in their traps; and the carriers' carts plodded in with their slow horses from villages as much as fifteen miles away. Sometimes they were hooded carts, sometimes they were just open carts, with planks for seats, on which sat twelve cloaked and bonneted women, six a side, squeezed together, for the interminable journey. As late as 1914 I knew the carrier of Croydon-cum-Clopton, twelve miles from Cambridge; his cart started at 6.30 in the morning and got back about ten at night. Though he was not old, he could neither read nor write; but he took commissions all along the road—a packet of needles for Mrs. This, and a new teapot for Mrs. That—and delivered them all correctly on the way back."|"Period Piece"|"Gwen Raverat"

It was terrifying for her, poor young thing, to walk out before all those hawk-eyed matrons; and to remember to be ready for the hostess to 'catch her eye' at the end of dinner. This was the signal for the ladies to gather up their belongings and to sweep demurely out of the room, leaving the gentlemen to their wine. And it was worst of all for her in the drawing-room, where the ladies all fell into intimate, low-voiced conversations about their illnesses, their children and their servants; for she had as yet no illnesses, nor children, and knew very little about servants. At the end—about 10.15—no one could leave until the bride rose; and cases have been known of the bride being so petrified by fear that, after a long wait, the kindest of the elder ladies had to rise and propel her into doing her duty."|"Period Piece"|"Gwen Raverat"

Some people had special dishes sent in from the college kitchens, but my mother considered that extravagant.

In those days no one ever went to St. Pancras by the Great Eastern Railway if they could help it; and Liverpool Street was unknown to the genteel. The early start put a great strain on the whole household. Sometimes the Bull bus came to fetch my mother; it went round the town picking up such people as had bespoken its services. It cost sixpence, luggage and all. But sometimes the bus was booked up, and then a fly from the Bull yard was ordered to come at 8 o'clock. But when red-faced Ellis drove up to the door, my mother was nowhere near being ready. Once, when she was leaving to catch the boat-train for New York, she was still in her nightdress when Ellis came; and she caught the train, too. If not actually in her nightdress when he came, she was always still in her bedroom; perfectly calm, though all the three maids, and Nana, and I, were running about to fetch things and to help her to dress; while my father stood at the foot of the stairs, watch in hand, looking worried, and calling up in his patient voice: 'Maud, you'll miss the train.' Of course she had not attempted breakfast, and I used to put slices of buttered toast on the seat of the cab for her. This was important, as her day's work was so absorbing, that she never had time for lunch, and used to come home in the evening quite famished and worn out. When she was in the fly I used to hand in through the window her boots and a button-hook, so that she could put them on as she went; while she gave me in exchange her slippers to take back."|"Period Piece"|"Gwen Raverat"

Uncle William said: 'One day at Down I made some flippant and derogatory remarks about the committee which was prosecuting Eyre. My father instantly turned on me in a fury of indignation, and told me I had better go back to Southampton [from whence he had just come].

I did not play well and was always afraid of coming in on the wrong beat after counting 153 empty bars. However, Mr. Dent and Clive Carey, who were the conductors, were very kind to me, and I dare say I did not do very much harm. One evening the friend, who generally went with me, did not turn up. I was not supposed to go out alone after dinner, but I thought that silly, and anyhow if they didn't know, they wouldn't mind. So I went off alone, rather nervously. Well, I was coming quietly home again by myself just about ten o'clock, and there was nobody at all to be seen, as I turned into the narrow darkness of Silver Street.

Certainly, after this, he continually expected the worst about everything; though, from various stories of his childhood I have the impression that he had always been of a melancholy temperament. It was natural enough that he should have a horror of childbirth and illness, but his melancholy went deeper than that. He was difficult to cheer in his moods of heaviness; he seemed to have no spring of hope in him.

Then each of the team was solemnly given a glassful of sweet and sticky port, and we rushed straight from the table out to the hockey-field. I found the port extremely nasty and difficult to swallow; and everyone complained that it made them feel sick; still, it was an honour to get it, so we drank it gratefully.
