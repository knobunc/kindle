Across his mind there passes a momentary genuine annoyance with the President for having created such a mess as naming Bob Leffingwell to State is almost certainly going to be, but the thought is presently dismissed as he gives himself a last approving inspection and prepares to go in town for a little politickin’.

Still, we hope the Senate will take its time and satisfy itself completely as to the nominee’s qualifications. In this area, in this era, the country cannot afford a mistake.” “We’d like to see this one given plenty of thought,” the News said. “We’ve seen much to praise in Bob Leffingwell’s record, and also plenty to criticize. We’ve done both, as we deemed necessary. Now we say to the Senate: take it easy and make sure you’re right.

It was a shrewd if somewhat incomplete appraisal of the appointment, an assessment of its world and domestic political implications, and a suggestion for certain actions to be taken in the event of favorable action by the Senate. After it left his desk the Ambassador called home and reminded his wife that they were to attend the party at Mrs. Harrison’s that night. She did not particularly want to go and neither did he, but they knew it was both a duty and an opportunity: a chance to spend an evening with people they despised, to whom they felt infinitely superior, and to whose destruction and that of their country the Ambassador and his lady were implacably and inescapably dedicated.

She would be flying in with Celestine Barre at four-thirty, and would he be good enough to call Raoul Barre at the French Embassy and tell him so? Both ladies wanted orchids for Dolly’s party, so he could order hers at once, and don’t forget to tell Raoul the same.

A few clerks and secretaries drifted in, the parliamentarian and his assistant stood at one of the doors talking, the clerk of the Senate and the sergeant-at-arms stood talking at another, the first reporters waiting to see Bob Munson wandered into the well of the Senate and stood about exchanging chaff. At his desk on the majority side, Dave Grant, secretary to the Majority, busied himself with papers and made last-minute calls to senatorial offices advising the expected schedule of business for the day, and at his desk on the minority side Bert Hallam, secretary to the Minority, did the same. Above in the public galleries the tourists settled themselves in an excited, peering bustle, a few senatorial wives and special guests entered the family gallery to the Chair’s left, a few dark-skinned individuals of indeterminate nationality took their places in the diplomatic gallery directly across from him, a few reporters came into the press gallery directly above and behind him. From his personal office across the Senators’ lobby, behind the chamber, Harley Hudson peeped out quickly and then went in again, but not before several tourists had spotted him and exclaimed delightedly to one another. The press corps grew in front of Bob Munson’s desk and in front of that of Warren Strickland of Idaho, the Minority Leader, directly across the center aisle. Paul Hendershot of Indiana, the first Senator to appear, came on the floor like some bright old peering bird and took his seat toward the back of the room; he was followed quickly by Cecil Hathaway of Delaware, John Baker of Kentucky, Bob Randall of New Jersey, and Powell Hanson of North Dakota. For a moment the four of them stopped to talk, a little knot of laughing, congenial men, then broke up and went to their respective desks. Murfee Andrews of Kentucky, loaded down with books and documents, came in prepared to do battle on the pending Federal Reserve bill; he was followed by his two principal antagonists, Taylor Ryan of New York and Julius Welch of Washington, looking fully as determined as he. It was ten minutes to noon on the day of the Leffingwell nomination and the Senate, with the exception of minor changes here and there, looked exactly as it had at ten minutes to noon in 1820, 1890, 1910, 1935, 1943, or any other time. As if by concerted agreement the Majority Leader entered down the center aisle, the Minority Leader entered from the side, and the press moved in on them both as they shook hands and gave one another friendly greeting while the tourists stared and twittered up above."|"Advise and Consent"|"Allen Drury"

In private homes from Chevy Chase to Falls Church and from Westmoreland Circle to Forest Heights, department heads, agency employees, clerk-typists, secretaries, professional people, military folk, members of the press, lobbyists and what-have-you, and their wives were putting last-minute touches on the parties to which they had invited other department heads, agency employees, clerk-typists, secretaries, professional people, military folk, members of the press, lobbyists, and what-have-you, and their wives. Out among the embassies the Belgians, the Ceylonese, the Rumanians, and the Dutch were getting ready to entertain at lavishly decorated, lavishly catered receptions that would be attended by representatives of all the other embassies in town with which at the moment, they happened to be on speaking terms. In hundreds of giant apartment houses thousands of government girls were about to descend in thousands of self-operated elevators to meet thousands of government boys for a night on the town; and on Ninth Street and other drab haunts of Washington’s incorrigibly small-town sin, little aimless groups of sailors, soldiers, airmen, and marines from nearby bases had just begun to wander about looking for wine, women, and a place in which to enjoy them. Under the swinging chandeliers in the great white portico at Vagaries the Cadillacs, the Chryslers, the Chevvies, and the Fords were driving up to discharge their chattering, self-important cargo, the men encased in tuxedoes like a stream of glistening beetles, the women gussied-up fit to kill."|"Advise and Consent"|"Allen Drury"

Three orchestras were playing, one in the enormous living room, one in the great glassed-in sun porch and one in the ballroom upstairs, and there was a sort of loud, reverberating roar flooding the mansion, compounded of three different popular tunes going loudly at the same time, the thump of feet dancing, chandeliers tinkling, ice clinking, and everywhere amiable voices, getting increasingly loud and fuzzy, talking, talking, talking. He could sense already from the relaxed and easy tone of things that the party was very likely going to last until three, if not later, and as the two ambassadors got their drinks and he switched quietly to plain ginger ale he decided that much could be done about the nomination before it was over. At the door he saw Orrin and Beth Knox arriving with Brigham and Mabel Anderson, to be followed immediately by Lafe Smith, traveling alone, and Seab Cooley, arriving with Arly and Helen Richardson. Crystal Danta came in with Hal Knox, George and Helen Keating followed and in a moment Tom and Anna August entered just ahead of the Ryans, the Welches, and the Andrews, who, their official differences on the Federal Reserve bill forgotten, arrived together in a merry group. Elsewhere in the room he could see Alexander and Mary Chabot of Louisiana talking animatedly to Allen and Evelyn Whiteside, and in the crush on the great winding staircase toward which he was leading his two companions he saw Winthrop of Massachusetts and his horsey, charming wife talking to Victor and Hazel Ennis, who looked hearty and a little tight, while behind them Fred Cahill of Missouri was struggling upwards with four drinks clutched desperately in his hands toward his wife and Luis and Concepci6n Valdez of New Mexico, who were hemmed in at the top of the stairs. The Senate was well represented already, and would be more so before long. He waved heartily to them all across the surging crowd and was about to take his captive diplomats up the stairs to Dolly’s private study when he felt a nudge and looked around to find the Majority whip and their ebullient colleague from West Virginia beaming at his side."|"Advise and Consent"|"Allen Drury"

There had been three before it, and there were many after, but those who attended that night looked back upon it fondly as one of Dolly’s greatest triumphs. It is true, of course, that a number of people, including two Cabinet officers, three four-star generals, half a dozen distinguished members of the press, and a whole clutch of prominent civil servants proved beyond all doubt that they could get just as drunk and just as mean and just as sloppy as, say, the president of the bank and the head of Rotary and the editor of the local paper at the country club dance back home; but on the whole it was a good crowd that enjoyed itself in a good way, liquid but happy. It was a party at which you could see, among other things, the tubby little Dean of the Washington Cathedral buttonholing the Vice President of the United States to give him an earful on how vital it was that the Senate confirm Bob Leffingwell; and the Chief Justice arguing vehemently with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on the same subject; and the counselor of the Embassy of Bolivia discussing it earnestly with the counselor of the Embassy of Ghana; and the wives of a hundred different officials, as interested and astute as their husbands, tossing it back and forth to one another in little gracefully catty and perceptive exchanges. It was a party at which the caterer’s representative informed the hostess shortly after midnight that as of that hour her guests had consumed one hundred quarts of bourbon, fifty-seven quarts of scotch, two hundred cases of ginger ale and soda, five hundred pounds of ice, and approximately $5,000 worth of hors d’oeuvres, turkey, ham, chicken, celery, olives, salads, and marrons glacés."|"Advise and Consent"|"Allen Drury"

12:00|noon|"“Very well, Senator,” Brigham Anderson said shortly. “I’d suggest we all calm down here. I can understand the witness’ impatience in the face of a long and exhaustive interrogation; I can also, I must tell him candidly, understand something of the bafflement, disappointment, and annoyance with which many of his answers have been received by the subcommittee. But it is true, as the Senator from Vermont says, that millions of his countrymen are watching these proceedings; and they will make their judgment, as we must make ours in the immediate matter of his confirmation. The morning is getting on, there is a session of the Senate we all wish to attend at noon, I am the only member remaining to question, and I really will be brief. I would suggest again, therefore as I said, that we all calm down. Is that agreeable to you, Mr. Leffingwell?”"|"Advise and Consent"|"Allen Drury"

By the introduction of a comment here, a question there, once even a short, sharp exchange of his own with Tom August and Lafe Smith, he managed to keep the pot boiling; and during the lulls in the debate conferred quietly on the floor and in the cloakrooms with some twenty-five of his colleagues, getting from at least seventeen of them considerable indications of support. And when the session ran late with unexpected trivia—Jack McLaughlin of Georgia felt he had to speak for an hour on price supports for peanuts, Marshall Seymour of Nebraska was mad at the Federal Trade Commission for another hour and a half, and Newell Albertson of West Virginia spoke for three hours more on the necessity for a shake-up in the Bureau of Mines—he went downstairs for one of the potluck dinners put together by the Senate Restaurant for night sessions and spent it at a table with John Winthrop and John DeWilton encouraging those gentlemen in their suspicions of the nominee. So it was not wasted effort, he reflected as the bell rang for adjournment at ten twenty-three and the great light in the Capitol dome that always burns above the town for a night session went out; but it was not until he had returned to his apartment in the Sheraton-Park and was beginning to think about bed that he had any real idea at all of how he would proceed on the morrow.

These were Bob Leffingwell’s applauders, the eager laughers, occasionally the surreptitious and bitter hissers. Opposed to them was a scattering of middle-aged women, equally earnest, equally belligerent; their settled and prosperous husbands; a few professional people who might be lawyers or doctors; here and there, in both camps, a few genuine, wild-eyed fanatic types who had long since passed the point of no return on Bob Leffingwell and all other matters. Through the crowd ran a leaven of bright-eyed, pink-cheeked, freshly-scrubbed young servicemen from some nearby base, looking awed and baffled and puzzled by it all. Aside from these, Seab could see, it was a gathering that wanted blood, and he thought with a rather grim satisfaction that he had some for it."|"Advise and Consent"|"Allen Drury"

10:00|"10 a.m."|"Only one immediate worry keeps coming back to nag him, and that is the thought that just possibly he had acted a little too hastily last night when, upon receipt of James Morton’s call, he had telephoned the wire services and announced that the Leffingwell hearing would be reopened at 10 a.m. tomorrow. This action was taken on his own and without consultation with anyone else on the subcommittee or anyone else in the Senate, and as such it was to some degree an uncharacteristic action, one of the few impulsive and uncareful moments in a life which has not known many. Underlying his attempt to enjoy the day is the uneasy thought that possibly he had moved too fast and may regret it. Yet such had been the desperate urgency of James Morton’s call, and so deep its anguished intensity, that he had perforce been swept into the conviction that it was genuine; and when he had called the number back within ten minutes to check for sure, the man had displayed an even greater anxiety. This had strengthened his own general tendency to be essentially a lone wolf, and he had felt further that in this case there were party matters involved, the commitment of the President and the Majority Leader to the nominee, all the matters of party prestige and political standing now riding on the shoulders of Robert A. Leffingwell, which he felt imposed an obligation upon him not to divulge his reasons to the press or anyone else until he could have a chance to discuss them at the White House. Compounding this reaction also was his shock and surprise, for he had been coming around in his own mind to a point where he could actively support the nominee. Now all bets are off, and there is, indeed, the very strong probability that he will move into active opposition."|"Advise and Consent"|"Allen Drury"

Given the character he had, he could have taken no other course.

It had been a rough fifteen hours, for all that they had seemed outwardly to affect him so little, and for all that it had been only Celestine, who in her silent way had recognized the full extent of the mental turmoil he had been going through. This was the biggest act of political defiance he had ever committed, the biggest single act of will he had ever displayed on the national scene, the first time he had ever stood out alone against the overwhelming weight of the White House, the party, the press, and a major portion of domestic and world opinion; and it was not an easy thing to do, however much an innate iron and strength of character had come to his assistance. He still had no great fear of the consequences, for he still felt he had a good case to make, and he still felt thoroughly capable of weathering whatever might come as a result of his actions; but this did not make it any easier to undergo, inside. Along with the stubbornness, the integrity of character, the impassive unyielding calm and tolerance there also went a very real sensitivity and a heart that could be bruised much more easily than the world knew. He didn’t like to be going against popular opinion, he didn’t enjoy being pilloried in the press, he didn’t want to think he was giving trouble to his party and his friends. It did not make it more pleasant to feel that he was right in it, even though he managed to maintain for the most part an air that convinced most who saw him that he was armored in righteousness and undaunted in his convictions.

Tommy Davis, for all ordinary purposes one of the kindliest of men, wouldn’t knowingly have hurt a fly; but he was walking forward down the long corridors of the Office Building now in the certain knowledge, which he tried his best not to think about, that he might well be about to hurt a fellow being, knowingly, a great deal. He told himself with a little shiver that it was only in obedience to the highest imperatives that he could even imagine such a thing—because so much depended upon Bob Leffingwell, because the crisis in the world was so acute, because speedy confirmation was so necessary if that crisis was to be helped toward a peaceful conclusion. These were the reasons, utterly genuine, utterly sincere, springing from the highest integrity and devotion to country, which were propelling the Justice, a citizen whose life and calling were dedicated to helping his fellow men, upon an errand that might well destroy a fellow man. The contemplation of so violent an affront to his own decency and kindly nature was causing a profound and desperately inward-arguing unhappiness as he walked along; and it was with a troubled expression he could not completely conceal that he came to Senator Munson’s door and found it, to his surprise, surrounded by the press."|"Advise and Consent"|"Allen Drury"

His expression was completely noncommittal, however, and so was his greeting when he came by with his tray a little later and went on to the back row of tables reserved for Senators. There he found that Orrin and Lafe had been joined by Dick Suvick of Alaska, which cramped conversation some, and so the meal passed in an equally noncommittal fashion.

Orrin called once, to say that he was sure his own skepticism earlier was probably unwarranted, and to offer the reassurance that all was well, something Brig knew he really didn’t mean, but he was amused and touched by the consideration. The proprietor of Meet the Press called and asked him to appear on Sunday afternoon, and after a moment’s thought he agreed, for surely everything would be in the clear by then. Lafe called twice, once to say much the same thing Orrin had, and once to repeat a joke he thought Brig might feel like laughing at; he did, and appreciated not only the joke but the friendship and concern behind it. Somewhere around three, struck by a sudden thought, he tried to reach Tommy Davis and kid him out of whatever had been troubling him last night, but the Justice’s secretary, after an awkward hesitation, said he wasn’t in.

Fortunately the black mood had been too black to last; before long his native courage, stubbornness and tenacity had begun to reassert themselves. So someone knew, the one thing he had hoped no one in the world, particularly the world of Washington, would ever know, and in some way apparently connected with the nomination someone was making use of it. Was that enough to make him give in? If he had been able to reach the President when he tried, it might have been; he was glad now that he had failed, for the delay had given him the chance to recover. It had taken him quite a while, fighting all alone with the television babbling on senseless and unnoticed across the room, to decide that he would not give in that easily; it was almost midnight before he reached that conclusion. When he did it was final. He decided then with a fatalistic acceptance of the consequences that he knew he would not change, that his obligation to the country—the country, in whose name they all were acting, the country, which imposed upon them all a single high duty pursued through paths as many and various as the men who owed loyalty to it—was such that he could not abandon his position, no matter what the pressures were or might become."|"Advise and Consent"|"Allen Drury"

More immediately and much more imperatively for the sake of peace in his own house, he must reconcile the situation with his wife; and shortly after midnight this became possible, for she came back in, red-eyed and exhausted, accepted, or seemed to accept, his calm statement that the call had been nothing but the evil mouthings of a crank, and clung to him crying bitterly at her lack of faith in him and her leaving when he needed her; too late to recapture the moment when she might have put their marriage on a basis it had never known, but not too late for his purpose of restoring their life together to some basis of rational stability from which to repel any further attacks that might be made upon it in the ugly turn of events that had now come about in the nomination."|"Advise and Consent"|"Allen Drury"

Possibly, he said, he might go on up to the Hill to the office and try to get caught up a little, so if she woke and found him gone she would know where he was. When she wanted to know what there was to do there on Sunday, he said vaguely, “Oh, there are letters and things.” She started up the stairs and then turned back abruptly and kissed him, hard. “I’m here,” she said, as though it proved something.

Dolly was called and consulted; said she was canceling the reception but thought they should go ahead with the rest of it as Orrin and Stanley suggested; after a while Hal and Crystal agreed reluctantly and went off, much troubled, to bed, Hal to his room and Crystal back to the Westchester, where she said she would make some coffee and sit up for her father. A call came from Brig’s brother in Salt Lake City that he would be flying in in the morning, and Stanley volunteered to meet him and assist during the day Monday with the many details of liquidating the remnants of a life.

On its suspended platform at the far end of the hall the band played, “California Here I Come,” the University of Illinois “Fight Song,” and now and again “Dixie,” with all its burden of poignancy and memory that do things to the American heart no other music can.

He had tried desperately to see Harley and Howie in the interval, had reached the latter for a noncommittal but fairly encouraging two minutes, but Harley was remaining aloof. When the roll began Harley was on the platform, as though wishing to speak, which caused great excitement in the Amphitheater; but he did not, the roll started; Michigan continued to stand firm for its Governor, Ohio did the same; Wisconsin broke and went to the Governor, but Minnesota came over to Senator Knox.

"> 03:00"|"Shortly after 3 a.m."|"Shortly after 3 a.m. Harley came to Orrin’s suite, trailed by most of the press, who considered it highly significant that he was coming to see the Senator first. The Senator thought so too, and when they were finally alone he did his best to be persuasive. It was not an hour or a situation in which tired and exhausted and ambitious men could give much time to being circuitous with each other, so he tried to be frank but friendly. “Governor,” he said, “I think I’m going to win, and I’d like to have you with me.” Harley had given him a hesitant smile and Orrin had felt his good will, the kindly, rather bumbling, but essentially good personality. At the moment, however, it was a personality that knew it held strong cards. “I’d like to be with you, Senator,” Harley said, “but I wonder if I should do it for nothing.” “I said when I got off the train that I would make no deals for the nomination,” Orrin replied. “Did you mean it?” Governor Hudson had inquired, rather dryly, and Orrin had given him a sudden smile. “Do you really think I didn’t?” he asked, and he would say for Harley that he had stopped smiling and looked respectful. “I believe you did,” he said, “but under the circumstances—” And his voice had trailed away. “He said the same thing,” Orrin had said with just a trace of sarcasm. “Maybe there’s better hunting there.” Harley Hudson had smiled. “I’m going to see him after I leave here,” he said, “and maybe there is. Still and all, I would like to do the right thing—if I can.” Senator Knox had turned away, for this was a decision he had made months ago, and as far as he knew, none of his delegates had been bought with any pledge of Federal preferment. “I’m sorry,” he said, staring out the window across almost-deserted Lake Shore Drive to the dim emptiness of Lake Michigan beyond. “Certain fundamentals a man has to stand by in this world. I’m standing by that. I hope you’ll be with me tomorrow morning.” The Governor of Michigan had given him a long look and a firm hand shake before they had gone back out to face the blinding flashbulbs and the television cameras and put off with bland and friendly wisecracks the eager questions of the press. “I hope I will be able to,” Harley had said as they opened the door. “I hope everything works out.”"|"Advise and Consent"|"Allen Drury"

There was a roar of boos from his opponent’s supporters, swiftly drowned out in a roaring demonstration for him. Instantly apprised of this development in his room in the Stockyards Inn, the Governor of California five minutes later did the same, touching off an equally wild counter-demonstration that for a few moments threatened mayhem all around. By dint of energetic gaveling and a blaring assist from “Dixie” by the band, the chairman managed to restore order after ten minutes, directed the calling of the roll, and the secretary once more began, “A—la—bama!” Two minutes later Arizona yielded to Ohio, and Governor Sheppard blandly cast his entire delegation for the Governor of California. For a howling interval the contest seemed to be over; but abruptly there was an angry stir and fuss over by the California standard, a red-faced delegate grabbed the microphone and began bellowing for recognition. When it came he shouted something furiously unintelligible and profane, and then wound up, more slowly, loud and clear. He and thirty of his fellow delegates, he announced in high dudgeon, were tired of being bossed, and they were going to vote for Senator Knox, and they didn’t give a damn what happened to them. A hall which had produced all the sound human lungs could make found that it could produce even more. Somehow the roll was completed, the secretary and the tally clerks went into a huddle, the room that had been filled with insane noise an instant before became so still only the hurrying, sibilant clatter of a thousand typewriters and the ringing of their little bells in the press section broke the silence. The secretary stepped forward and in a trembling voice once more announced a deadlock.

They would be needed a little later on, he thought with a sigh, for the clock was moving toward noon and the toughest thing he had ever had to do as Majority Leader was steadily coming closer as the session neared. He was not entirely ungrateful or unhappy, difficult though he knew their talk would be, when Mary buzzed and told him that the minutes remaining before the session would be filled by a visit from the senior Senator from Illinois.

Marshall as usual was full of sharp comments that he liked to think were funny but weren’t, particularly today, and Orrin found it hard not to take his head off. However, by a series of grunts and “Unh-hunhs” and a pretense of leafing through the papers in his briefcase he managed to complete the trip without an open breach with the insufferable old joker. And after all, he told himself ironically, he needed his vote. Inspired by this thought, he changed his attitude abruptly as they got off the car, linked his arm through Marshall’s, and chatted away with him vigorously as they made their way to the Senators’ elevator and up to the floor. “How to win friends and influence people,” Victor Ennis murmured in some surprise. “I don’t care what a fool you are, I need your lousy vote,” Dick Mclntyre murmured in return. “Well,” Vic said with sudden seriousness, “he’s got mine. How about you?” “I’m watching my mail,” Senator Mclntyre said candidly. “It’s beginning to run two-and three-to-one against Leffingwell. He’ll probably have mine, too.” “He’ll probably have a good many,” Senator Ennis said. “Enough?” inquired Dick Mclntyre. “We shall see,” said Vic Ennis."|"Advise and Consent"|"Allen Drury"

Many Senators were in black, voices were hushed, people moved about quietly with subdued and sober greetings. The press gallery was crowded, too, and there as everywhere in the room there was an atmosphere of somber expectation, as though people felt instinctively that today there was much more at stake, and much more to be expected, than on the usual day of eulogies for a dead Senator.

By ten-thirty, when Lafe called to suggest they share a cab, he had received more than five hundred wires and almost one hundred special-delivery letters. Of these close to four hundred were approving; the remainder, with varying degrees of abuse and vituperation, were not. Lafe reported essentially the same.

As the morning hour dragged on and various Senators put editorials, clippings, and contributions from constituents into the Record—“Oh, help dear America in her hour of need/We are blessed with our great Senator Hugh B. Root indeed,” began one characteristic entry from New Mexico, modestly offered by the Senator of the same name—there was a steady procession of Senators to his desk. He was the logical man to fall heir to the Majority Leader’s abandoned pledges, and by 1 p.m. when the routine business was at last concluded he could count a solid total of forty-seven votes, four votes short of the fifty-one vote majority necessary in the one hundred-man Senate. This was a gain of fourteen over the thirty-three votes in opposition noted in Bob’s calculations as of Monday, and he had no doubt at all that he could pick up the other four. What he wanted to do, of course, was pick up many more than that and make it a really devastating repudiation of the President. He had no doubts on that score either, for following Senator Munson’s withdrawal from the fray the supporters of the nominee appeared to have pretty well lost heart. Powell was much too junior to rally the necessary strength, Arly was finding himself trapped in his own reputation for erratic cussedness, and elsewhere on the floor his own lieutenants, Seab and Lafe and Warren Strickland chief among them, were at work with an organized zeal that was picking up adherents hourly.

At the door he met Lafe just as he turned away from a confidential chat with Bessie Adams of Kansas. “I’m going to the White House,” he said, and the junior Senator from Iowa grinned. “Give him hell,” he said. “We’ll mind the store.”"|"Advise and Consent"|"Allen Drury"

In between the [Laughter] there had been a most damaging speech against Robert A. Leffingwell, and it was in full awareness that he had his work cut out for him that the senior Senator from Arkansas thoughtfully sought recognition from the Chair.

By order of his successor the Mansion was thrown open to the public on Friday, and all day long, in an endless line two abreast, shuffling and slow, native and foreign and black and white, they moved patiently up the curving drive, under the portico, into the East Room and around the candle-lit catafalque and slowly, slowly, out the door and down the other drive and out the East Gate. It was estimated by the press, which kept round-the-clock vigil as the day passed and the night came on and the city went fitfully to sleep and the dawn came again, that more than 200,000 people passed through 1600 Pennsylvania on this last farewell; and when the coffin on its horse-drawn caisson moved out the West Gate at 10 a.m., turned and started along Pennsylvania Avenue with its procession of sleek black limousines following behind, it was estimated that more than a million more lined the route."|"Advise and Consent"|"Allen Drury"

The senior Senator from South Carolina, author of the severest and perhaps the only truly honest expression of opinion the press had received on that hectic midnight—“He was an evil man, and the Lord has rendered judgment upon him”—sat silent, bland, and unblinking as they rode along, his face impassive; men did not dare imagine what he might be thinking in that shrewd, unforgiving old mind. The Speaker too was silent, lost in thoughts of his own, not sad, not happy, simply accepting what time and politics had brought and planning how best he might adjust to the new personality in the White House. In their car following, the Majority Leader of the Senate caught from time to time the eye of the Minority Leader of the Senate, and between them there passed on several occasions a look of mingled regret, relief, and concern, regret as one regrets the passing of any major force of nature terrible and magnificent in its ability for good and its capacities for evil, relief that they no longer had to deal with him, concern for the pleasantly undistinguished man who had taken his place and now bore all their hopes."|"Advise and Consent"|"Allen Drury"

He felt that at the moment Harley needed plenty of good advice, for all his outward calm in the cortege this morning. Orrin could not forget the daze in which he had taken the oath, white and stunned, shortly after midnight in the oval office at the White House. The Chief Justice, hastily routed out of bed, had administered the awesome words in the presence of everyone who could possibly crowd into the room, and Harley’s response had been barely audible. Many people had cried, and the new Chief Executive had looked as though he might,, too. He had started to say something and then stopped, overcome; finally, “I want you all to know I shall do my best” was all he could manage.

His home office furniture was utilitarian—filing cabinets, a bookcase, a reading desk supporting an ancient copier, a table where he read and sorted reference materials, and a sturdy desk with typewriter hard against the wall farthest from the window. Items of interest relevant to whatever he was working on—postcards, photos, maps, menus—were tacked to the walls in an ever-changing collage. Books, with pages of interest marked by metal tabs in assorted colors, were arranged in easy reach. Everything within his sight or reach was directly related to the project at hand—no distractions, nothing unnecessary, was allowed within his sphere. He’d rise early, eat a Spartan breakfast, then disappear into his office; from that moment until noon the only evidence of his existence was the sound of his typewriter. Uncle Al did allow himself vacations between novels, and he traveled a great deal when conducting research, but when the time came to write, he put six hours a day, six days a week, of butt-in-chair work into every project. My family lived in Florida and the room across the hall from mine was his bachelor apartment—a large room with its own bath and porch—where he stayed several weeks a year.

Al had that streak in him and so indulged me. I let my passion for music grow, and was prone to excited discussions of some act I had seen at the “legendary 9:30 Club,” after CBGB in New York perhaps the most famous punk/New Wave club on the East Coast. For old timers, I am talking about the “real” one, a hole in the wall painted all black, now gone, not its successor which is very nice but not glorious, the way the old one was. One time Al made a serious suggestion that I take him. There might be a story there. I am sorry I never figured out a way to pull that one off. It would have been something to see."|"Advise and Consent"|"Allen Drury"
"~ 09:00"|"about 9 a.m."|"Under the spur of my own determination and Ken’s lively interest—he offered me an advance of $500 and a contract on the strength of the first two chapters, but I turned it down because I knew it would be a long book and some native caution, compounded by a newspaperman’s caution, made me leery of signing on any dotted lines until I was really sure I could carry it through. I went home and in late September or early October of 1957 began steady writing. I soon found that I was falling into what is apparently my personal writing pattern, to write form about 9 a.m. to noon or 1 p.m. on most days (sometimes, of course into afternoon or evening if things really get rolling well, but normally the pattern as stated), at a clip of about 1,500 words a day. At this pace I had finished the first section of Advise and Consent, Bob Munson’s Book, 247 mss. pages, by the end of the year and on January 1, 1958 sent it to Ken. He immediately offered me an advance of $2,500 and a contract, and being by then sure that the momentum could carry me forward, I signed. I wrote steadily until mid-November of 1958, at which time I was able to send Ken a wire that I had reached those magic words “The End.”"|"Advise and Consent"|"Allen Drury"
