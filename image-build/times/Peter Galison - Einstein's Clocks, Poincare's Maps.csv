"ap 07:00"|"7 o’clock"|"Einstein believed that physicists would only find consistency by sorting out the measurements of space and time. To make spatial measurements, a coordinate system is needed—by Einstein’s lights, a system of ordinary rigid measuring rods. For example: this point is two feet along the x-axis, three along the y, and fourteen up the z-axis. So far, so good. Then came the surprising part, the reanalysis of time that contemporaries like the mathematician and mathematical physicist Hermann Minkowski saw as the crux of Einstein’s argument.4 As Einstein put it: “We have to take into account that all our judgments in which time plays a role are always judgments of simultaneous events. If, for instance, I say, ‘That train arrives here at 7 o’clock,’ I mean something like this: ‘The pointing of the small hand of my watch to 7 and the arrival of the train are simultaneous events’.”5 For simultaneity at one point, there is no problem: if an event located in the immediate vicinity of my watch (say, the train engine pulling up beside me) occurs just when the small hand of the watch reaches the seven, then those two events are obviously simultaneous. The difficulty, Einstein insisted, comes when we have to link events separated in space. What does it mean to say two distant events are simultaneous? How do I compare the reading of my watch here to a train’s arrival at another station there at 7 o’clock?"|"Einstein's Clocks, Poincare's Maps"|"Peter Galison"
15:00|"3:00 P.M."|"Figure 1.1 Central Clock Coordination. In his 1905 paper on special relativity, Einstein introduced—and rejected—a scheme of clock coordination in which the central clock sent a signal to all other clocks; these secondary clocks set their times when the signal arrived. For example, if the central clock sent its time signal at 3:00 P.M., each secondary clock synchronized its hands to that same 3:00 P.M. when the pulse arrived. Einstein’s objection: the secondary clocks were at different distances from the center so close clocks would be set by the arriving signal before distant ones. This made the simultaneity of two clocks depend (unacceptably to Einstein) on the arbitrary circumstance of where the time-setting “central” clock happened to be."|"Einstein's Clocks, Poincare's Maps"|"Peter Galison"
"ap 00:00"|12:00|"Having knocked the straw out of this straw man, young Einstein proposed a better system: let one observer at the origin A send a light signal when his clock says 12:00 to B at a distance d from A; the light signal reflects off B and returns to A. Einstein has B set her clock to noon plus half the round-trip time. A two-second round-trip? Then Einstein has B set her clock to noon plus one second when she gets the signal. Assuming that light travels just as fast in one direction as the other, Einstein’s scheme amounts to having B set her clock to noon plus the distance between the two clocks divided by the speed of light. The speed of light is 300,000 kilometers per second. So if B is 600,000 kilometers from A when B receives the light signal, she sets her clock to 12:00:02, noon plus two seconds. If B were 900,000 kilometers away from A, B would set her clock to 12:00:03 when she gets the signal. Continuing in this way, A, B, and anyone else participating in this coordination exercise can all agree that their clocks are synchronized. If we now move the origin, it makes no difference: every clock is already set to take into account the time it takes for a light signal to arrive at the clock’s location.

19:10|1910|"By Einstein’s own account, the recognition that synchronizing clocks was necessary to define simultaneity was the final conceptual step that let him conclude his long hunt, and that—time coordination—is the subject of this book. Indeed, Einstein judged the alteration of time in relativity theory to be that theory’s most striking feature. But his assessment did not immediately carry the day, even among those who counted themselves as Einstein’s backers. Some embraced relativity after experiments on the deflection of electrons seemed to lend it support. There were those who used the theory only when physicists and mathematicians had reworked it into more familiar terms that did not put so much stress on the relativity of time. Through tense meetings, exchanges of letters, articles and responses, by 1910 a growing number of Einstein’s colleagues were pointing to the revision of the time concept as the salient feature. In the years that followed, it became canonical for both philosophers and physicists to hail clock synchronization as a triumph in both disciplines, a beacon of modern thought."|"Einstein's Clocks, Poincare's Maps"|"Peter Galison"
"ap 07:00"|"7 o’clock"|"Let’s return to Einstein’s central inquiry. Invoking what may seem a quaintly metaphorical thought experiment, Einstein wanted to know what was meant by the arrival of a train in a station at 7 o’clock. I have long read this as an instance of Einstein asking a question that (as Einstein put it) was normally posed “only in early childhood,” a matter that he, peculiarly, was still asking when he was “already grown up.”16 Was this the naïveté of the isolated genius? Such riddles about time and space appear, on this reading, to be so elementary as to lie below the conscious awareness of professional scientists. But was the problem of simultaneity, in fact, below the threshold of mature thought? Was no one else in 1904–1905 in fact asking what it meant for an observer here to say that a distant observer was watching a train arrive at 7 o’clock? Was the idea of defining distant simultaneity through the exchange of electric signals a purely philosophical construct removed from the turn-of-the-century world?"|"Einstein's Clocks, Poincare's Maps"|"Peter Galison"
12:00|noon|"What time do the map makers make it out to be in Berlin when it is noon in Paris? What time is it down the line when the train pulls into Bern? In posing such questions, Poincaré and Einstein seem, at first glance, to be asking questions of stunning simplicity. As was their answer: two distant events are simultaneous if coordinated clocks at the two locations read the same—noon in Paris, noon in Berlin. Such judgments were inevitably conventions of procedure and rule: to ask about simultaneity was to ask how to coordinate clocks. Their proposal: Send an electromagnetic signal from one clock to the other, taking into account the time the signal takes to arrive (at approximately the speed of light). A simple idea of breathtaking consequences for concepts of space and time, for the new relativity theory, for modern physics, for the philosophy of conventionalism, for a world-covering network of electronic navigation, for our very model of secure scientific knowledge."|"Einstein's Clocks, Poincare's Maps"|"Peter Galison"
"~ 19:00"|"around 1900"|"Amidst this cacophony of voices, this book aims to show how the synchronizing of clocks became a matter of coordinating not just procedures but also the languages of science and technology. The story of time coordination around 1900 is not one of a forward march of ever more precise clocks; it is a story in which physics, engineering, philosophy, colonialism, and commerce collided. At every moment, synchronizing clocks was both practical and ideal: gutta-percha insulator over ironclad copper wire and cosmic time. So variously construed was time regulation that it could serve in Germany as a stand-in for national unity, while in France at the same moment it embodied the Third Republic’s rationalist institutionalization of the Revolution."|"Einstein's Clocks, Poincare's Maps"|"Peter Galison"
19:01|1901|"Yet Einstein’s path to coordinated time was very different from Poincaré’s. Einstein’s vision was less ameliorist. Framing himself as a heretic and an outsider, Einstein scrutinized the physics of the fathers not to venerate and improve, but to displace. Einstein saw the coordination of time, and indeed his physics and his philosophy more generally, as part and parcel of the same critical reevaluation of the founding assumptions of the disciplines. Einstein did not move methodically from one aspect of time coordination to another. Most elements of his approach to relativity theory were already in place before he even touched the problem of time; for example, by 1901 he had already dismissed the ether that Poincaré had struggled so hard to maintain. Einstein’s engagement with critical works at the boundary of physics and philosophy were by then long-standing, and at the patent office, he and his fellow inspectors had been dissecting the machinery of time for three years. So in May 1905, when Einstein began defining simultaneity by way of electrocoordinated clocks, it was not, as it was for Poincaré, a matter of distinguishing “apparent” from “true” time alongside a quasi-fictional ether. For Einstein clock coordination was the turn of the key that would at last set in motion the theory machine that he had struggled for a decade to assemble. There was no ether; there were actual fields and particles, and there were but real times given by clocks."|"Einstein's Clocks, Poincare's Maps"|"Peter Galison"

Despite the presence of ever-more-vigilant clock tenders on the ships to protect the ticking freight, the measured time difference from the United States to England was, impossibly, different from that from England to the United States. Something on the high seas was confounding the clocks. Astronomers suspected that temperature was probably the culprit, with the lower temperatures far offshore slowing the clockworks. This meant that if a lethargic clock set sail at 1:00 P.M. from Cambridge, Massachusetts, it would arrive in Europe showing that Cambridge time was earlier than it really was and induce British map makers, relying on the clocks arriving in England, to put Cambridge, Massachusetts, to the west of its actual location. Conversely, a slow-running seagoing clock set initially in Liverpool would suggest to the Americans that Liverpool time was earlier than it was, so the New World map makers would draw their maps with Liverpool to the west and therefore closer to the shores of North America. Testing, calculating, and interpolating did little to help. Crowding the ship with more supervisors, better temperature compensators, and superior clocks just spewed out additional conflicting data. Unable to measure the number that mattered most, the longitude difference between North America and Europe, map makers despaired."|"Einstein's Clocks, Poincare's Maps"|"Peter Galison"

18:48|1848|"It was not just the astronomers and map makers who cared about the rapid dispersal of simultaneity. Trains had schedules to maintain, and by 1848–49 railroads began forming voluntary associations to fix, by convention, the time on which they ran. For much of New England that meant that all trains on or after 5 November 1849 were to adopt the “true time at Boston as given by William Bond & Son, No. 26 Congress Street.”23 Any railroad not already in this common time system soon was motivated to be so. On 12 August 1853, two trains of the Providence and Worcester line slammed into each other at a blind curve. Fourteen people died, and newspapers blamed the tragedy on a conductor with an itchy finger on the throttle and a slow watch at his side. With another bad-watch disaster just a few days earlier, train lines found themselves under immense pressure to coordinate their clocks. Telegraphically transmitted time became a standard railroad technology.24"|"Einstein's Clocks, Poincare's Maps"|"Peter Galison"
18:52|1852|"Partly pushing the observatories, partly pushed by them, train supervisors, telegraph operators, and watchmakers accelerated the electrical coordination of clocks both in England and in the United States. By 1852, directed by the Astronomer Royal, British clocks were sending electrical signals over telegraph lines both to public clocks and to railways.25 Soon the Americans were, too. Summing up the status of their time effort, the director of the Harvard College Observatory boasted in late 1853 that the “beats of our clock can, in effect, be instantly made audible at any telegraph station within several hundred miles of this Observatory.”26 During the 1860s and 1870s, coordinated time reached deeper into the cities and train system. Hailed in the press, visible in the streets, studied in observatories and laboratories, the synchronized clock was anything but rarified science. Its capillary extension into train stations, neighborhoods, and churches meant that synchronized time intervened in peoples’ lives the way electric power, sewage, or gas did: as a circulating fluid of modern urban life. Unlike other public services, time synchronization depended directly on scientists. By the end of the 1870s, the Harvard College Observatory was but one site sending time, though for a few years its service was one of the largest. Idiosyncratic developments in Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Greenwich, Paris, or Berlin set each apart.27"|"Einstein's Clocks, Poincare's Maps"|"Peter Galison"
12:00|noon|"Shortly after those first experiments on electrical time, Harvard Observatory hired a telegraph line to distribute to Boston the time its astronomers had determined by the measurement of the stars. By 1871, the observatory director was charging for the service, hoping to install a prominent clock “so that the public can see and learn to appreciate the method of communicating time.”28 Returns were good: in 1875, the service netted $2,400, a yield sufficiently large that the observatory hired a proprietor for its time business.29 In 1877, Harvard’s Observatory director assigned graduate student Leonard Waldo to manage the time service. By then the Cantabrigians had invested over $8,000 in instruments, clocks, and telegraph lines. Now they needed customers. Using their telegraph to trigger its noon start, Waldo planned to drop a large copper time ball down a mast on top of one of Boston’s higher buildings. He hoped that this public display, visible both to landlubbers and navigators, would dramatically boost the observatory’s recognition. So would a major recruitment of railways. Jewelers and clockmakers too were needed as time clients, not to speak of private individuals who clamored (or ought to, according to Waldo) for precision time. Waldo hoped a widening clientele would persuade big manufacturers that time really was money, or at least was worth buying.

From this master clock, time would course through the region on two circuits in addition to the main one linking the observatory, the Boston Fire Department, and the city of Boston. In the unlikely event that the Observatory clock failed, Waldo promised his time-hungry customers that they would receive a back-up signal from clockmakers William Bond & Sons. All day long, at two-second intervals, pulses shot out from the Observatory, skipping, for identification purposes, every minute’s fifty-eighth second, while every fifth minute the service would omit the pulses that would normally go out on the thirty-fourth to sixtieth seconds.31"|"Einstein's Clocks, Poincare's Maps"|"Peter Galison"

And he, at least in June 1879, equivocated before he came to back a plan for unification.43 On the one side, he was being pressed by the scientists’ continental scale of action: they wanted the whole country under the rule of a single time convention. On the other, he and the railroads had to accommodate ordinary people who were used to operating on local time. So he compromised, settling for the status quo that nailed time along the tracks to the big cities they served. In June 1879, Abbe dismissed Allen’s antique attachment to calling it twelve o’clock when the sun happened to be near the meridian. “The advantages of uniform time far outweigh the first week’s awkwardness of the proposed change. Abolish old times is the watchword.”44"|"Einstein's Clocks, Poincare's Maps"|"Peter Galison"

When the earth rotated so that meridian line C crossed the hour hand’s line of sight to the sun, it would be C o’clock everywhere. When D crossed that imaginary line, it was D o’clock everywhere. Every clock in the world would display the same time simultaneously. If Big Ben said it was C:30:27 (meaning 30 minutes and 27 seconds past C o’clock), then so would a clock at Times Square or downtown Tokyo, the “electric telegraph affording the means of securing perfect synchronism all over the earth.” Here was a scale of electric time unification that dwarfed even continental America. To accommodate local sensibilities, Fleming hatched watchmaking schemes. One allowed the user to rotate the whole watch face so the wearer’s local noon (say, for example, F or Q, depending on location) stood at the top. Another design provided side-by-side clock faces, one for local, the other for terrestrial time.47"|"Einstein's Clocks, Poincare's Maps"|"Peter Galison"

This opposition was not, as Allen sometimes suggested, based on a reactionary attachment to the removal of God’s own noonday sun. Protesters uniformly accepted the principle of a railroad-and-telegraph-determined simultaneity. There were, after all, already effective time zones carved out by railroads from the Atlantic to the Pacific. A railroad guide in September 1883, for example, showed some forty-seven lines running on New York time while thirty-six took time from Chicago’s clocks, while Philadelphia’s clocks governed another thirty-three.60 Every train line accepted the conventionalism of time. This fundamental feature of late-nineteenth-century time was so deeply hammered into rails and wires that it was as present to time-zone protesters as it was to boosters. What then did the dissenters dispute? One newspaper article, defending a single national time, targeted the observatories, where astronomers, in charge of far-flung outposts, had grown fat feeding time to regions; local simultaneity had become “the meat upon which these star-gazers feed.” Another anti-standard time complaint came from an almanac publisher: sunrise and sunset times would be thrown into a cocked hat by time unification.61 Most protesters simply disputed the dividing lines of conventional simultaneity, their antizonism grounded in the convenience of local train schedules, or regional, national, or universal time.

During the seven weeks that the survey crew lived and worked in their Irish shack by the sea, they saw four days without rain and only a single clear night. “The observations were, in general, made during the intervals of showers; and it was an event of frequent occurrence for the observer to be disturbed by a copious fall of rain while actually engaged in noting the transit of a star.” Time sentries at the other end of the line in Newfoundland had it worse. Telegraphic Surveyor George Dean spied nothing, not a single glimpse of the sun, moon, or stars."|"Einstein's Clocks, Poincare's Maps"|"Peter Galison"
"ap 04:55"|"4 hours, 55 minutes"|"In tiny, far-flung observatories, the American, British, and French sentries of time took their readings from the skies and matched them against the pulses from their cables. Stars told each station its local time, cables whispered to them of time somewhere else. It was devilishly hard work, demanding precision results, strong cables, and orchestrated teamwork. One of de Bernardières’ French collaborators perched his station near the ruins of the city of Chorillos, just south of Lima. Another waited by his telegraph in the observatory of the naval school in Buenos Aires. Linking up the various wires, de Bernadières began signaling electrically from Valparaiso to Panama. All along the route, relay men struggled to keep the signal moving without a break: the tiny current tickling the mirror; reflected light flickering. As soon as he saw the light spot move, the operator would relaunch the signal. Starting on 18 January 1883, while the Americans were still readying crates in Washington for their expedition along the coast of Peru and Argentina, the French team seized three excellent astronomical and electrical evenings. Just after their last measurement, the submarine cable into Panama snapped, severing communication between their minuscule observatory and Paris. But they had results: the longitude of the flagpole over the stock market of Valparaiso stood 4 hours, 55 minutes, and 54.11 seconds earlier than the Montsouris time room thousands of miles to the east."|"Einstein's Clocks, Poincare's Maps"|"Peter Galison"

That origin arc would set one nation’s capital at the symbolic center of every global map.

On Thursday 15 February 1894, a young French anarchist, Martial Bourdin, bought a ticket from Westminster Bridge to Greenwich. According to one of two observatory assistants, when chatting in the lower computing room, the pair “were suddenly startled by a loud explosion, the detonation of which was sharp and clear. . . . I immediately remarked to Mr. Hollis, ‘That is dynamite! Spot the time’.” Trained to observe by the clock, they duly recorded the detonation at 4:51. When a policeman arrived at the detonation scene in the park below the observatory, he found Bourdin dying. The anarchist had lost his hand and received a massive blow of explosive and bomb fragments. For years, doubt lingered about Bourdin’s motives; anarchists suspected a police setup; others saw in it one more in the long series of French anarchist strikes, including one on the Chamber of Deputies in Paris (December 1893) and another in a Paris café just three days before Bourdin’s demise. Joseph Conrad’s version of the events in his 1907 work The Secret Agent remains the canvas on which these events have been seen: a dark sketch of dupes, manipulators, and careerists from which no one emerges unsullied. In Conrad’s world the conniving First Secretary of a Foreign Power insisted on an attack that would frighten the class enemies beyond murder: “The demonstration must be against learning—science. The attack must have all the shocking senselessness of gratuitous blasphemy.” It must strike at the mysterious scientific heart of material prosperity. “‘Yes,’ he continued with a contemptuous smile. ‘The blowing up of the first meridian is bound to raise a howl of execration.’”8"|"Einstein's Clocks, Poincare's Maps"|"Peter Galison"

Or rather, in the face of fierce protests from the public, the navigators, and the scientists, Poincaré refused to engage the debate at all, instead proposing to resolve the problem with the technical legerdemain of a reforming Polytechnician. On 7 April 1897, Poincaré brought the commission a table he had prepared that displayed each proposed system, the kinds of multiplications required (ignoring factors of ten) to express angles, to convert time to angles for expressing longitude (degrees per hour of the earth’s rotation), and to convert angles from the old 360-degree system to the proposed decimal ones. For example, to express an angle of a circle and a half (1.5 rotations) in the 100-division system, there’s no conversion factor at all: once the factors of ten are taken into account, you just have 150 units. No mental arithmetic, the multiplier is just 1. For the 400-division system, 1.5 circles would be 600 units; to get from 1.5 to the 6 in that 600 (the additional multiplication by 100 requiring no brainpower), you need to multiply by 4. The second column tells how to switch from parts of the circle into time: if the whole circle is 100 units, you need to multiply by 24 to get hours—100 units of rotation equals a full twenty-four-hour day. If the circle is 400 units, you need to multiply by 6 to get hours. Finally, to switch back into the old 360-degree circle, you would (for the 400-unit circle) just multiply by the factor 9, whereas a 100-unit circle required multiplication by 36."|"Einstein's Clocks, Poincare's Maps"|"Peter Galison"

"> 19:05"|"after 1905"|"By the time Poincaré and Lorentz put these worries on paper, both saw the essentials of their physics in mortal danger—their hunt for an explanation of the microphysics of the electron, their long struggle to instantiate the relativity principle, and their never-ending quest to specify the status of the ether. In the early years after 1905, some physicists assimilated the new theory to an older ambition to find an electrical explanation for all physics. Others seized the mathematics, ignoring the reformation of time. But in the end, the greatest threat did not emerge from the magnets, tubes, and photographic plates of Kaufmann’s study of how fast electrons were deflected by electric and magnetic fields or work at any other laboratory. Though the “true relations” of his physics survived, in the long term Poincaré’s vision of the time and space of modern physics—one that prized the ether as an ineliminable framework for intuitive mathematized understanding, one that sharply split true from apparent time—lost its place in the canonical presentation of physics. An unknown twenty-six-year-old physicist at the Bern patent office was to offer a different path to understanding, one that threw aside electron structure, the ether, and the distinction between “apparent” and “true time.” Instead he wired a coordinated clock into the theory not as an aid to the physical interpretation of local time but as the capstone of the relativistic arch."|"Einstein's Clocks, Poincare's Maps"|"Peter Galison"
"~ 18:48"|"around 1848"|"The clock-world famous Matthäus Hipp found welcome in Switzerland. Blacklisted in his native Württemberg for his republican and democratic advocacy around 1848, his trade was in time machines of every sort. He developed electrically maintained pendula so regular that they far surpassed mechanical ones: a heavy pendulum swung freely except when it needed an electromagnetic boost. Alongside such electrical timepieces, Hipp perfected recording clocks that radically altered experimental psychology. Collaborating with physicists and astronomers, he tracked the transmission speeds of nerves, telegraphs, and light, thereby inventing, altering, and producing new ways to use electricity and clocks to materialize time. Though he worked closely with scientists (especially Swiss astronomer Adolphe Hirsch), Hipp was more artisan-entrepreneur than mathematician-savant. Founder of telegraph and electrical apparatus factories in Bern and later Neuchâtel and Zurich, Hipp took his company from the establishment of the first network of public electric clocks in Geneva (1861) to ever greater prominence. In 1889 Hipp’s firm became A. De Peyer and A. Favarger et Cie; from then to 1908 the concern extended the range of their mother clocks beyond the dominion of observatories and railways to steeple clocks and even to the wake-up clocks inside hotels.2 With the march of time into every street, engineers needed methods to extend indefinitely the number of units that could be branched together. A flood of patents followed, perfecting relays and signal amplifiers."|"Einstein's Clocks, Poincare's Maps"|"Peter Galison"

Together the three founded their “Akademie Olympia,” an informal club for discussing philosophy or whatever else aroused their curiosity. Solovine: “We would read a page or a half a page—sometimes only a sentence—and the discussion would continue for several days when the problem was important. I often met Einstein at noon as he left his desk and renewed the discussion of the previous evening: ‘You said . . . , but don’t you think . . . ?’ Or: ‘I’d like to add to what I said yesterday. . . .’”33"|"Einstein's Clocks, Poincare's Maps"|"Peter Galison"
00:00|midnight|"Up for discussion by the Olympia Academy was also Karl Pearson, the Victorian mathematician-physicist known for his contributions to statistics, philosophy, and biology. But intriguingly Pearson, drawing on Mach as well as the German philosophical tradition, also put the naive reading of “absolute time” under the critical microscope. Einstein and his academicians would have found in Pearson’s 1892 Grammar of Science another sharply critical assessment of the relation of all observable clocks to Newton’s absolute time: “[T]he hours on the Greenwich astronomical clock, and ultimately on all ordinary watches and clocks regulated by it, will correspond to the earth turning through equal angles on its axis.” So all clock time is ultimately astronomical time. But many factors could alter the great earth-clock in its rotation—tides, for example. “Absolute, true, mathematical time,” as Newton called it, is something we use to describe our sense impressions (a “frame,” as Pearson put it). “But in the world of sense-impression itself [absolute intervals of time] have no existence.” Watching stars cross the spider lines of our transit instruments from one midnight to the next on two different occasions, we notice that the average person registers roughly the same sequence of sense impressions. Fine, says Pearson. Assign those two midnight-to-midnight intervals the designation “equal.” But we should not fool ourselves; this has nothing to do with absolute time: “The blank divisions at the top of and bottom of our conceptual time-log are no justification for rhapsodies on the past or future eternities of time, for rhapsodies which, confusing conception and perception, claim for these eternities a real meaning in the world of phenomena, in the field of sense impression.”37"|"Einstein's Clocks, Poincare's Maps"|"Peter Galison"
19:02|1902|"What about time? By 1902 Lorentz had long since been experimenting with fictional mathematical variations in the way the time variable t would be defined for an object moving in the ether. With Poincaré’s and other physicists’ further articulation, the notion of a fixed ether had gained ground. As we know, Poincaré had (first ignoring the ether altogether and then for systems explicitly moving through it), interpreted simultaneity through light-signal-coordinated clocks. Though his use of the ether changed, Poincaré never wavered from his conviction that the ether was enormously valuable as a tool for thinking, a condition for the application of productive intuition. He never equated “apparent time” (time measured in a moving frame) with “true time” (time measured at rest in the ether).45"|"Einstein's Clocks, Poincare's Maps"|"Peter Galison"

Fairly typical of the kind of electrochronometric work blossoming in the decade after 1900 was Colonel David Perret’s novel receiver that would detect and use a direct-current chronometric signal to drive an oscillating armature. It was issued Swiss patent number 30351 on 12 March 1904. Favarger’s own receiver did the opposite: it took an alternating current from the mother clock and turned it into the unidirectional motion of a toothed wheel. The request for this patent—later used widely—was stamped “received” on 25 November 1902 and was issued on 2 May 1905 after a long, but not entirely unusual, evaluation period. There were patents that specified systems for clocks to activate remotely placed alarms, while other submissions targeted the distant electromagnetic regulation of pendula. There were proposals for time to travel over telephone lines—even systems that sent time by wireless. Other patents advanced schemes to monitor railroad departures and arrivals or to display the time in different time zones. Yet others specified how remotely run electrical clocks could be protected from atmospheric electricity or how electromagnetic time signals could be silently received.

Agostinelli, applying from Terni (patent 29073, issued 1904) proposed an “Installation with Central Clock for Indicating the Time Simultaneously in Several Places Separated from One Another, and with Bells for Calling Automatically at Predetermined Times.” There were patent applications by huge electrical combines like Siemens (“Motherclock Relay,” number 29980, issued 1904) and patents by smaller but still important Swiss firms like Magneta (patent 29325, submitted 11 November 1903, issued 1904), which manufactured the remotely set clocks gracing the Federal Parliament Building in Bern. A Bulgarian took out a patent in early 1904 for a mother clock and its electrical secondaries.

Instead of a wholly abstracted “Einstein philosopher-scientist”—lost in theory while absentmindedly merely earning his keep in the patent office—we can recognize him also as “Einstein patent officer-scientist,” refracting the underlying metaphysics of his relativity theory through some of the most symbolized mechanisms of modernity. The train arrives in the station at 7:00 P.M. as before, but now, after our long voyage through time and space, we can see it was not just Einstein who was worried about what this means in terms of distant simultaneity. No, determining train arrival times by using electromagnetically coordinated clocks was precisely the practical, technological issue that had been racking North America and Europe for the last thirty years. Patents were racing through the system, improving the electrical pendula, altering the receivers, introducing new relays, and expanding system capacity. Time coordination in the Central Europe of 1902–05 was not merely an arcane thought experiment; rather, it critically concerned the clock industry, the military, and the railroads as well as a symbol of the interconnected, sped-up world of modernity.

From this swirl, only around 1909 did Einstein’s articulation of time rise haltingly, contentiously, but then powerfully. (Even then there were some physicists, such as Ebenezer Cunningham in Cambridge, England, who read Einstein’s relativity very differently; he was certainly not the only physicist who while enthusiastic about the new theory did not take coordinated clocks to be the main event in the great drama of relativity.)73"|"Einstein's Clocks, Poincare's Maps"|"Peter Galison"

It was brass tubes with fragile, suspended mirrors, and it was global control of “universal time.” It was vast lengths of copper cable protected by heavy gutta-percha insulation, lying a mile under the ocean and served by brass telegraph keys inside crude observatory shacks; it was also the phantasmagorical reach of empire. Surveyors and astronomers pored over personal equations, calculating and correcting measurements through simultaneity on their way to the map, the final, prized product of their longitude work. But clock coordination was also the assembly of synchronized clocks strung together like beads along a continent-spanning chain through Europe, Russia, and North America. This fusion of technology and science drew together (though often in all-out struggle) Swiss horlogiers, American train schedulers, British astronomers, and members of the German General Staff. At one extreme, time synchronization represents technology conditioning humdrum daily procedure at every two-bit whistle-stop. As such it is a substantial part of the thick social history of the New England or Brandenburg countryside. At the other extreme, it stands for the symbolic reach of modernity that had mayors, physicists, and philosophers, pronouncing on the conventionality of time while poets payed homage to the annihilation of space by speed.
