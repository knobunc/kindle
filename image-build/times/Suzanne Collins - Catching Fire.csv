my new house in the Victor's Village. The reporters, the camera crews, even
Effie Trinket, my old escort, will have made their way to District 12 from the
Capitol. I wonder if Effie will still be wearing that silly pink wig, or if
she'll be sporting some other unnatural color especially for the Victory Tour.
There will be others waiting, too. A staff to cater to my every need on the
long train trip. A prep team to beautify me for public appearances. My stylist
and friend, Cinna, who designed the gorgeous outfits that first made the
audience take notice of me in the Hunger Games."|"Catching Fire"|"Suzanne Collins"

“They're collecting me at

“Shouldn't you look better?”

mood. “Maybe a ribbon in your hair or something?” He flicks my braid with his

the night Peeta fell to his knees and proclaimed his undying love for me in
front of the cameras in the Capitol, was the night the uprising began. It was
an ideal cover. Our Victory Tour interview with Caesar Flickerman was mandatory
viewing. It gave the people of District 8 a reason to be out on the streets
after dark, gathering either in the square or in various community centers
around the city to watch. Ordinarily such activity would have been too
suspicious. Instead everyone was in place by the appointed hour, eight o'clock,
when the masks went on and all hell broke loose."|"Catching Fire"|"Suzanne Collins"
12:00|noon|"My mother lets me sleep
until noon, then rouses me to examine my heel. I'm ordered to a week of bed
rest and I don't object because I feel so lousy. Not just my heel and my
tailbone. My whole body aches with exhaustion. So I let my mother doctor me and
feed me breakfast in bed and tuck another quilt around me. Then I just lie
there, staring out my window at the winter sky, pondering how on earth this
will all turn out. I think a lot about Bonnie and Twill, and the pile of white
wedding dresses downstairs, and if Thread will figure out how I got back in and
arrest me. It's funny, because he could just arrest me, anyway, based on past
crimes, but maybe he has to have something really irrefutable to do it, now
that I'm a victor. And I wonder if President Snow's in contact with Thread. I
think it's unlikely he ever acknowledged that old Cray existed, but now that
I'm such a nationwide problem, is he carefully instructing Thread what to do?
Or is Thread acting on his own? At any rate, I'm sure they'd both agree on
keeping me locked up here inside the district with that fence. Even if I could
figure out some way to escape—maybe get a rope up to that maple tree branch
and climb out—there'd be no escaping with my family and friends now. I told
Gale I would stay and fight, anyway."|"Catching Fire"|"Suzanne Collins"

Caesar Flickerman, speaking before a standing-room-only crowd in front of the

He introduces Cinna, who became an overnight star with his costumes for me in
the Games, and after a minute of good-natured chitchat, we're directed to turn
our attention to a giant screen."|"Catching Fire"|"Suzanne Collins"
12:00|noon|"I see now how they could photograph
me yesterday and present the special tonight. Initially, Cinna designed two
dozen wedding gowns. Since then, there's been the process of narrowing down
the designs, creating the dresses, and choosing the accessories. Apparently, in
the Capitol, there were opportunities to vote for your favorites at each stage.
This is all culminating with shots of me in the final six dresses, which I'm
sure took no time at all to insert in the show. Each shot is met with a huge
reaction from the crowd. People screaming and cheering for their favorites,
booing the ones they don't like. Having voted, and probably bet on the winner,
people are very invested in my wedding gown. It's bizarre to watch when I think
how I never even bothered to try one on before the cameras arrived. Caesar
announces that interested parties must cast their final vote by noon on the
following day."|"Catching Fire"|"Suzanne Collins"

over to the beach that borders the lightning section, and head into the jungle.
Beetee's still too weak to hike up the slope on his own, so Finnick and Peeta
take turns carrying him. I let Johanna lead because it's a pretty straight shot
up to the tree, and I figure she can't get us too lost. Besides, I can do a lot
more damage with a sheath of arrows than she can with two axes, so I'm the best
one to bring up the rear."|"Catching Fire"|"Suzanne Collins"

humans, so I take down three easily. The sound of the ten o'clock wave reminds
me I should get back, and I return to the others and clean my kill. Then I draw

of sorts, squatting on the ground, eating our jungle food, waiting for the bolt
that signals noon. At Beetee's request, I climb up into the canopy as the
clicking begins to fade out. When the lightning strikes, it's dazzling, even
from here, even in this bright sunlight. It completely encompasses the distant
tree, making it glow a hot blue-white and causing the surrounding air to
crackle with electricity. I swing down and report my findings to Beetee, who
seems satisfied, even if I'm not terribly scientific."|"Catching Fire"|"Suzanne Collins"

the wire. Since it's his weapon and the rest of us have to defer to his
knowledge so entirely, there's the odd feeling of being let out of school
early. At first we take turns having naps in the shadowy edge of the jungle,
but by late afternoon everyone is awake and restless. We decide, since this
might be our last chance for seafood, to make a sort of feast of it. Under
Finnick's guidance we spear fish and gather shellfish, even dive for oysters. I
like this last part best, not because I have any great appetite for oysters. I
only ever tasted them once, in the Capitol, and I couldn't get around the
sliminess. But it's lovely, deep down under the water, like being in a
different world. The water's very clear, and schools of bright-hued fish and
strange sea flowers decorate the sand floor."|"Catching Fire"|"Suzanne Collins"

to be about nine, we leave our shell-strewn camp, cross to the twelve o'clock

us out of the arena from the moment the Quell was announced. The victor
tributes from 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 11 had varying degrees of knowledge about it.
Plutarch Heavensbee has been, for several years, part of an undercover group
aiming to overthrow the Capitol. He made sure the wire was among the weapons.
Beetee was in charge of blowing a hole in the force field. The bread we
received in the arena was code for the time of the rescue. The district where
the bread originated indicated the day. Three. The number of rolls the hour. Twenty-four.
The hovercraft belongs to District 13. Bonnie and Twill, the women I met in the
woods from 8, were right about its existence and its defense capabilities. We
are currently on a very roundabout journey to District 13. Meanwhile, most of
the districts in Panem are in full-scale rebellion."|"Catching Fire"|"Suzanne Collins"

"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"If I feel ragged, my prep
team seems in worse condition, knocking back coffee and sharing brightly
colored little pills. As far as I can tell, they never get up before noon
unless there's some sort of national emergency, like my leg hair. I was so
happy when it grew back in, too. As if it were a sign that things might be
returning to normal. I run my fingers along the soft, curly down on my legs and
give myself over to the team. None of them are up to their usual chatter, so I
can hear every strand being yanked from its follicle. I have to soak in a tub
full of a thick, unpleasant-smelling solution, while my face and hair are
plastered with creams. Two more baths follow in other, less offensive,
concoctions. I'm plucked and scoured and massaged and anointed until I'm raw."|"Catching Fire"|"Suzanne Collins"

before the Training Center, we bubble our way through a list of questions.
Caesar Flickerman, in his twinkling midnight blue suit, his hair, eyelids, and
lips still dyed powder blue, flawlessly guides us through the interview. When
he asks us about the future, Peeta gets down on one knee, pours out his heart,
and begs me to marry him. I, of course, accept. Caesar is beside himself, the
Capitol audience is hysterical, shots of crowds around Panem show a country
besotted with happiness."|"Catching Fire"|"Suzanne Collins"

pulls out a gold watch on a chain from a vest pocket. He flips open the lid,
sees the time, and frowns. “I'll have to be going soon.” He turns the watch so
I can see the face. “It starts at midnight.”"|"Catching Fire"|"Suzanne Collins"

"ap 01:00"|"one o'clock"|"We travel through the
streets of the Capitol in a car with darkened windows. Behind us, another car
brings the prep teams. The throngs of people celebrating are so thick it's slow
going. But Effie has this all down to a science, and at exactly one o'clock we
are back on the train and it's pulling out of the station."|"Catching Fire"|"Suzanne Collins"
"< 12:00"|"toward noon"|"It must be getting on
toward noon now and the days are so short. No point in being in the woods after
dark if you don't have to. I stamp out the remains of my little fire, clear up
the scraps of food, and tuck Cinna's gloves in my belt. I guess I'll hang on to
them for a while. In case Gale has a change of heart. I think of the look on
his face when he flung them to the ground. How repelled he was by them, by me ..."|"Catching Fire"|"Suzanne Collins"
