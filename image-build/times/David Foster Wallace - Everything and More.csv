It’s rather more like the strange and abstract sort of potentiality by which a perfect copy of Michelangelo’s Pieta21 potentially exists in a block of untouched marble. Or, ∞-wise, the way anything that occurs cyclically (or, in A.’s term, “successively”)—like say its being 6:54 A.M., which happens every day like clockwork—is for Aristotle potentially infinite in the sense that an endless periodic recurrence of its being 6:54 A.M. is possible, whereas the set of all 6:54 A.M.s cannot be actually infinite because the 6:54s are never all going to coexist; the periodic cycle is never going to be “complete[d].”22"|"Everything and More"|"David Foster Wallace"
"ap 06:54"|6:54|"You can probably see how all this is going to play out w/r/t the Dichotomy. Again, though, it’s a little tricky. The statue and 6:54 analogies won’t quite work here. Yes, the interval AB and/or the set of all subintervals or points between A and B is not ‘actually infinite’ but only ‘potentially infinite’; but here the sense in which Aristotle means ‘AB is potentially infinite’ is closer to the idea of, say, infinite precision in measurement. Which can be illustrated thusly. My eldest niece’s current height, which is 38.5″, can be fixed more precisely at 38.53″; and with a more controlled environment and sophisticated equipment it could obviously be ascertained more and more exactly, to the 3rd, 11th, nth decimal place, with n being, potentially, ∞—but only potentially ∞, because in the real world there’s obviously never going to be any way to achieve true infinite precision, even though ‘in principle’ it’s possible. In pretty much just this way, for Aristotle AB is ‘in principle’ infinitely divisible, though this infinite division can never actually be performed in the real world."|"Everything and More"|"David Foster Wallace"
06:54|"6:54 A.M."|"(IYI Final bit of complication: For the most part, what Aristotle calls “Number” (meaning mathematical quantities in general) apparently is potentially infinite not in the way measurement is potentially infinite but in the way the set of all 6:54 A.M.s is potentially infinite. For instance, the set of all integers is potentially infinite in the sense that there is no largest integer (“In the direction of largeness it is always possible to think of a larger number”); but it is not actually infinite because the set doesn’t exist as one completed entity. In other words, numbers for Aristotle compose a successive continuum: there are infinitely many but they never coexist (“One thing can be taken after another endlessly”).)"|"Everything and More"|"David Foster Wallace"
06:54|"6:54 A.M."|"22 IYI Like so much of Aristotle, this is not immediately clear. The thing here is that ‘coexist’ basically means ‘all exist at the same time,’ which the 23-hour-and-59-minute gap between each recurrence of 6:54 A.M. (these gaps being packed into the very definition of ‘6:54 A.M.’) renders impossible. In essence, this Succession → Noncompletion thing is also Aristotle’s argument for why capital-T Time is potentially but not actually infinite, which in turn preempts certain Lamp-type paradoxes about eternity and first and last moments."|"Everything and More"|"David Foster Wallace"
05:00|lauds|"The reason Russell lauds him w/r/t the problem of infinitesimals is the same reason Weierstrass gets top billing in the Arithmetization of Analysis. He is the first to give a wholly rigorous and metaphysically untainted theory of limits. Because it’s important, and underlies the way most of us are now taught calc in school, let’s at least quickly observe that Weierstrass’s definition of limits replaces Abel/Bolzano/Cauchy’s natural-language terms like ‘approaches a limit’ and ‘becomes less than any given quantity’ with the little epsilon and delta and the ‘| |’ brackets of absolute value. A great fringe benefit of Weierstrass’s theory is that it characterizes limits and continuity in such a way that either can be defined in terms of the other. See for example his definition of continuous function, which is still the industry standard 150 years later65: f(x) is continuous at some point xn if and only if, for any positive number ε, there exists a positive δ such that for any x in the interval |x − xn| < δ, |f(x) − f(xn)| < ε.*"|"Everything and More"|"David Foster Wallace"
