"ap 00:00"|twelve|"Barend came in, a whirlwind of shampoo and too much deodorant. She didn't look at him, knowing he would be freshly turned out for the evening, his hair a new, dubious experiment. He sat down at the breakfast counter. 'So, how are you, Ma? What's cooking?' So jovial.'Dinner,' said Milla, resigned.'Oh. I'm not eating here.'She knew that. Christo probably wouldn't either.'Ma, you're not going to use your car tonight, are you.' In the tone of voice he had perfected, that astonishing blend of pre-emptive hurt and barely disguised blame.'Where do you want to go?''To the city. Jacques is coming. He's got his licence.''Where in the city?''We haven't decided yet.''Barend, I have to know.' As gently as possible.'Ja, Ma, I'll let you know later.' The first hint of annoyance breaking through.'What time will you be home?''Ma, I'm eighteen. Pa was in the army when he was this old.''The army had rules.'He sighed, irritated. 'OK, OK. So ... we'll leave at twelve.''That's what you said last week. You only got in after two. You're in Matric, the final exams ...''Jissis, Ma, why do you always go on about it? You don't want me to have any fun.''I want you to have fun. But within certain limits.'He gave a derisory laugh, the one that meant he was a fool to put up with this. She forced herself not to react.'I told you. We will leave at twelve.''Please don't drink.''Why do you worry about that?'She wanted to say, I worry about the half-bottle of brandy I found in your cupboard, clumsily hidden behind your underpants, along with the pack of Marlboro's. 'It's my job to worry. You're my child.'Silence, as if he accepted that. Relief washed over her. That was all he wanted. They had got this far without a skirmish. Then she heard the tap-tap of his jerking leg against the counter, saw how he lifted the lid off the sugar bowl and rolled it between his fingers. She knew he wasn't finished. He wanted money too.'Ma, I can't let Jacques and them pay for me.'He was so clever with his choice of words, with the sequence of favours asked, with his strategy and onslaught of accusation and blame. He spun his web with adult skill, she thought. He set his snares, and she stepped into them so easily in her eternal urge to avoid conflict. The humiliation could be heard in her voice. 'Is your pocket money finished?''Do you want me to be a parasite?'The you and the aggression were the trigger, she saw the familiar battlefield ahead. Just give him the money, give him the purse and say take it. Everything. Just what he wanted.She took a deep breath. 'I want you to manage on your pocket money. Eight hundred rand a month is ...''Do you know how much Jacques gets?''It doesn't matter, Barend. If you want more you should ...''Do you want me to lose all my friends? You don't want me to be fucking happy.' The swearword shook her, along with the clatter of the sugar bowl lid that he threw against the cupboard.'Barend,' she said, shocked. He had exploded before, thrown his hands in the air, stormed out. He had used Jesus and God, he had mumbled the unmentionable, cowardly and just out of hearing. But not this time. Now his whole torso leaned over the counter, now his face was filled with disgust for her. 'You make me sick,' he said.She cringed, experiencing the attack physically, so that she had to reach for support, stretch out her hand to the cupboard. She did not want to cry, but the tears came anyway, there in front of the stove with a wooden spoon in her hand and the odour of hot olive oil in her nose. She repeated her son's name, softly and soothingly.With venom, with disgust, with the intent to cause bodily harm, with his father's voice and inflection and abuse of power, Barend slumped back on the stool and said, 'Jesus, you are pathetic. No wonder your husband fucks around.'The member of the oversight committee, glass in hand, beckoned to Janina Mentz. She stood still and waited for him to navigate a path to her. 'Madam Director,' he greeted her. Then he leaned over conspiratorially, his mouth close to her ear: 'Did you hear?'They were in the middle of a banqueting hall, surrounded by four hundred people. She shook her head, expecting the usual, the latest minor scandal of the week.'The Minister is considering an amalgamation.''Which Minister?'' Your Minister.''An amalgamation?''A superstructure. You, the National Intelligence Agency, the Secret Service, everyone. A consolidation, a union. Complete integration.'She looked at him, at his full-moon face, shiny with the glow of alcohol, looking for signs of humour. She found none.'Come on,' she said. How sober was he?'That's the rumour. The word on the street.''How many glasses have you had?' Light-hearted.'Janina, I am deadly serious.'She knew he was informed, had always been reliable. She hid her concern out of habit. 'And does the rumour say when?''The announcement will come. Three, four weeks. But that's not the big news.' 'Oh.''The President wants Mo. As chief.'She frowned at him.'Mo Shaik,' he said.She laughed, short and sceptical.'Word on the street,' he said solemnly.She smiled, wanted to ask about his source, but her cellphone rang inside her small black handbag. 'Excuse me,' she said, unclipping the handbag and taking out her phone. It was the Advocate, she saw.'Tau?' she answered.'Ismail Mohammed is in from the cold.'"|Trackers|"Deon Meyer"
00:30|"half past twelve that night"|"Milla lay on her side in the dark, knees tucked up to her chest. Beyond weeping she made reluctant, painful discoveries. It seemed as though the grey glass, the tinted window between her and reality, was shattered, so that she saw her existence brilliantly exposed, and she could not look away.When she could no longer stand it, she took refuge in questions, in retracing. How had she come to this? How had she lost consciousness, sunk so deep? When? How had this lie, this fantasy life, overtaken her? Every answer brought greater fear of the inevitable, the absolute knowledge of what she must do. And for that she did not have the courage. Not even the words. She, who had always had words, in her head, in her diary, for everything.She lay like that until Christo came home, at half past twelve that night. He didn't try to be quiet. His unsteady footsteps were muffled on the carpet, he switched on the bathroom light, then came back and sat down heavily on the bed.She lay motionless, with her back to him, her eyes closed, listening to him pulling off his shoes, tossing them aside, getting up to go to the bathroom, urinating, farting.Shower, please. Wash your sins away.Running water in the basin. Then the light went off, he came to bed, climbed in. Grunted, tired, content.Just before he pulled the blankets over himself, she smelled him. The alcohol. Cigarette smoke, sweat. And the other, more primitive smell.That's when she found the courage."|Trackers|"Deon Meyer"

SafeHouse, Gardens, Cape TownDate and Time: 7 August 2009, 17.52M: I want to enter the program, Williams. Like in now.W: I understand, Ismail, but. . .M: No 'buts'. Those fuckers wanted to shoot me. They won't stop at trying.W: Relax, Ismail. Once we've debriefed you ...M: How long is that going to take?W: The sooner you calm down and talk to me, the sooner it will be done.M: And then you'll put me in witness protection?W: You know we look after our people. Let's start at the beginning, Ismail. How did it happen?M: I heard them talking . . .W: No, how did they find out you were working for us?M: I don't know.W: You must have some sort of idea.M: I ... Maybe they followed me . . .W: To the drop?M: Maybe. I was careful. With everything. For the drop I did three switch backs, got on other trains twice, but...W: But what?M: No, I.. . you know ... After the drop ... I thought... I dunno ... Maybe I saw someone. But afterwards ...W: One of them?M: Could be. Maybe.W: Why did they suspect you?M: What do you mean?W: Let's suppose they followed you. They must have had a reason. You must have done something. Asked too many questions? Wrong place at the wrong time?M: It's your fault. If I could have reported via the cellphone, I would have been there still.W: Cellphones are dangerous, Ismail, you know that.M: They can't tap every phone in the Cape.W: No, Ismail, only those that matter. What have the cellphones to do with this?M: Every time I had to report, I had to leave. For the drop.W: What happened after the drop?M: My last drop was Monday, Tuesday, the shit started, there was a discreet silence between them. At first I thought it was some other tension. Maybe over the shipment. Then yesterday I saw, no, it was only when I was around that they got like that. Subtle, you know, very subtle, they tried to hide it, but it was there. Then I began to worry, I thought, better keep my ears open, something's wrong. And then this morning, Suleiman sat in council and said I must wait in the kitchen with Rayan ...W: Suleiman Dolly. The 'Sheikh'.M: Yes.W: And Rayan . . . ?M: Baboo Rayan. A dogsbody, a driver. Just like me. We worked together. Anyway, Rayan never said a word to me, which is really strange. And then they called Rayan in too, for the very first time, I mean, he's a dogsbody like me, we don't get called in. So I thought, let me listen at the door, because this means trouble. So I went down the passage and stood there and heard the Sheikh . . . Suleiman . . . when he said, 'We can't take any risks, the stakes are too high.'W: The stakes are too high.M: That's right. Then the Sheikh said to Rayan: 'Tell the council how Ismail disappears'.W: Go on.M: There's no going on. That's when they caught me.W: How?M: The Imam caught me at the door. He was supposed to be inside. They were all supposed to be inside.W: So you ran.M: I ran, yes, and the fuckers shot at me, I'm telling you, these people are ruthless. Intense.W: OK. Let's go back to Monday. At the drop you talked about 'lots of sudden activity' .. .M: The last two weeks, yes. Something's brewing.W: Why do you say that?M: The Committee used to meet once a week, for months. Now suddenly, it's three, four times. What does that tell you?W: But you don't know why.M: Must be the shipment.W: Tell me again about the phone call. Suleiman and Macki.M: Last Friday. Macki phoned the Sheikh. The Sheikh stood up and went into the passage so that I couldn't hear everything.W: How did you know it was Macki?M: Because the Sheikh said, 'Hello, Sayyid'.W: Sayyid Khalid bin Alawi Macki?M: That's him. The Sheikh asked Macki as he was walking away, 'Any news on the shipment?' And then he said, 'September', like he was confirming it.W: Is that all?M: That's all I heard of their conversation. Then the Sheikh came back and told the others, 'Bad news'.W: Bad news. Do you know what that means?M: How would I know? It could be because the shipment is small. Or the timing is wrong. It could be anything.W: And then?M: Then they left, the Sheikh and the two Supreme Committee members. They went off to the basement. Then you must know, it's top secret.W: Would you say the shipment is coming in September? Is that the conclusion you came to?M: Best guess.W: Is that a'yes'?M: That is what I think.W: And the shipment. Have you any idea what it is?M: You know, if it is Macki, it's diamonds.W: What does the Committee want with diamonds, Ismail?M: Only the Supreme Committee knows that.W: And no one else talked about it?M: Of course they talked about it, on the lower levels. But that is dicey intel, you know that.W: Where there's smoke . . . What did the lower levels say?M: They said it was weapons. For local action.W: What do you mean?M: That was the rumour. They wanted to bring in weapons. For an attack, here. For the first time. But I don't believe that.W: A Muslim attack? In South Africa?M: Ja. Here. Cape Town. The fairest Cape."|Trackers|"Deon Meyer"
"ap > 09:00"|"After 9"|"2 August 2009. Sunday.On the sixth floor of the Wale Street Chambers, in the director's office of the PIA, the Presidential Intelligence Agency, Janina Mentz studied the transcript with focused attention. When she had finished, she took off her glasses and placed them on the desk. She raised her hands to rub her eyes.She hadn't slept well, the news of the previous evening gnawed at her, the amalgamation rumour. Strange enough to be true. Or partially true. And what would become of her?She was seen as an Mbeki appointment. The former president had created the PIA. Although Mentz had not picked sides in the leadership struggle, although she and her people did excellent work, the stigma clung. On top of that she was new, only three months as director, no proven record with which to negotiate for a new position. And she was white.How much of the rumour was true? Mo Shaik as head of the superstructure? Mo, brother of Shabir, the convicted, corrupt Shabir, former friend of the new president. Anything was possible.So many years of service. So much struggling and striving, so much hard work to get here. Only to lose it all? No.Janina Mentz lowered her hands and put on her glasses. She reached for the Ismail Mohammed interview again. What she, what the PIA needed to survive, was an Exceptional Alarm. A Big Threat, a Sensitive Issue. And here it was, sent by the gods. Her responsibility was to exploit it.She turned to her computer and searched for the historical reports in the database.Report: South African Muslim Extremism revisited Date: 14 February 2007Compiled by: Velma du Plessis and Donald MacFarland1. Qibla in a new guiseQibla was established in 1980 by radical Imam Achmed Cassiem to promote the establishment of an Islamic state in South Africa, using the Iranian revolution as its model. During the 1980s, Qibla sent members to Libya for military training, and in the 1990s, operatives trained in Pakistan and fought alongside Hezbollah in South Lebanon. After 9/11, it also recruited fighters to send to Afghanistan.Because of the clampdown on related organisation People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (PAGAD) between 1998 and 2000, and the arrest of over one hundred Qibla supporters for violent offenses, including murder, Qibla all but disappeared.In its place, a new, and far more secretive organisation was created. It is called The Supreme Committee.3 August 2009. Monday.Milla Strachan pulled the key out of the lock, pushed the front door open, but did not immediately enter. She stood a while, her body motionless, her dark eyes unfocused for a moment. Beyond the open door the rooms of the apartment were empty. No curtains, no furniture, just a worn wall-to-wall carpet of washed-out beige.Still she hesitated at the door, as though some great force held her back, as though she were waiting for something.Then in one swift movement she bent down, picked up the large travel cases on either side of her and stepped through the door.She put the luggage down in the bedroom, conscious of the depressing emptiness. When she had been here on Saturday, the former tenant's furniture had filled it still, stacks of cardboard boxes for the hasty trip to Germany, called back on short notice to an aid organisation's head office. 'I am so grateful that someone saw the advertisement, this is such a crisis. You won't be sorry, look at the view,' the woman had said and pointed at the window. It looked out on Davenport Street in Vredehoek - and a thin slice of the city and the sea, framed by the blocks of flats opposite.Milla had said she wanted the flat, she would sign the lease agreement.'Where are you from?' the woman asked.'Another world,' Milla answered quietly.The three of them sat around the round table in Mentz's office, each noticeably different. The director had a strong face, despite the large, wide mouth, lipstick free. The severe steel-rimmed spectacles, hair tied back, conservative outfit, loose, grey and white, as if she wanted to hide her femininity. Faint, old traces of acne down her jaw disguised with foundation, slender fingers without rings, nails unpainted. Her expression was mostly inscrutable.Advocate Tau Masilo, Deputy Director: Operational and Strategy. Forty-three, fiat-bellied, colourful braces, matching tie, just a touch of flamboyance. The facial features strong, with gravitas, intense eyes, hair short and neat. Masilo's staff referred to him as 'Nobody' - from the phrase 'nobody's perfect'. Because in their eyes, Tau Masilo, phlegmatic and accomplished, was perfect. He was SeSotho, but he spoke five other South African languages effortlessly. Mentz had hand- picked him.And then, Rajkumar, Deputy Director: Information Systems. The Indian with his long black hair down to his tailbone. Mentz had inherited him.Rajkumar's saving grace was his phenomenal intellect and his insight into electronics and digital communication, because he was fat to an extreme degree, over-sensitive, and socially inept. He sat with his forearms on the table, pudgy fingers intertwined, staring intently at his hands as if he were totally captivated by them.Mentz got up slowly. 'Any other evidence?'Rajkumar, ever ready and keen: 'The Supreme Committee's email traffic - there is a definite escalation. I think Ismail is right, they're cooking up something. But I have my doubts about the target...''Tau?''What bothers me are the reports from Zim. Macki is no longer a player - he and Mugabe can't stand each other.''Possibly not. Perhaps directly from Oman, perhaps from another source. Angola is a possibility.''And the fact that they are planning something in the Cape?' Mentz asked.'I agree with Raj. Firstly: local terror would make their partners very unhappy. Hamas and Hezbollah are very grateful for our government's sympathy and support. Secondly: how do they benefit? What is the purpose? I can't see anything logical they can achieve through that. Thirdly: what would the motive be? Now?''Afghanistan,' said the Advocate. 'That's the new flashpoint. The mujahideen need more weapons and supplies, but how can they obtain them? Pakistan is working closely with the USA, blocking all the holes. NATO is keeping an eagle eye on traffic out of the Middle East. Thanks to the pirates, Somalia is no longer an option.''Price of opium is down too,' said Rajkumar. 'Taliban cash flow is not what it used to be.''So where do you send your supplies from?' asked Masilo and answered his own question: 'From here.''How?''I don't know. By ship?''Why not?' asked Rajkumar. 'Afghanistan has no coastline, but Iran has.''Then why not ship the arms from Indonesia. Lots of angry Muslims there.''Good point. Perhaps because that is what the US will be thinking too. They have a big naval presence ...'They looked towards Mentz. She nodded, pushed the papers into a neat pile in front of her. 'And yet, according to Ismail they are talking about a local attack ...''On the lower levels.''You know how information filters down from the top, Raj.' She looked at Masilo. 'How easy is it going to be for us to replace Ismail Mohammed?''Not easy. Ismail's escape ... it made them jittery. They don't meet in Schotschekloof any more, we still have to ascertain where their new hide-out is. If there is one.''That's a priority, Tau. Track them down. I want Ismail replaced.''That will take time.''You have less than a month.'He shook his head. 'Ma'am, they weren't a priority for three or four years. It's a closed circle, Ismail was inside already.''There must be someone inside that we can ... reach.''I'll prepare a list.''Raj, why can't you read their email?''They're using an encryption we've never seen before. It might be a variant of 128 bit, but the bottom line is, we can't crack it. We will continue to sniff every package. Sooner or later, they will make a mistake and forget to encrypt. It happens. Eventually.'She thought for a while before she spoke: 'There is something brewing here, gentlemen. All the signs are there. The email traffic, the sudden action against Ismail, the rumours, the so-called shipment, after two years of quiet. I want to know what it is. If you need more people or resources, talk to me. Tau, double our surveillance. I want someone in Ismail's place, I want weekly progress reports, I want focus and commitment. Thank you for coming in early.' I.She went to fetch two more suitcases, then the sleeping bag and the air mattress out of the white Renault Clio she had parked in the street. Outside she felt self-conscious. What did the people here think? A forty-year-old woman moving in alone. That vague anxiety in her, undefined, lurking there like a slumbering reptile just below the surface of the water.She unpacked her clothes into the built-in cupboards of cheap white melamine. In the bathroom the little white cabinet above the basin was too small for all her things. When she pushed the door closed, it caught her in the mirror - almost a stranger. Black hair, between long and short, not well styled. Not dyed, the grey hairs visible. The sallow Mediterranean skin, wrinkles at the corners of the eyes, two creases at the corners of the mouth. No make-up, lifeless, tired. An awakening, God, Milla, no wonder - you let yourself go, what man would stay with you?She turned around swiftly, went to inflate the mattress.In the bedroom she sat on the floor and unrolled it, putting the valve between her lips. Words ran through her, as always, too many.Some of those words she would write in her diary: I am here because the woman in the mirror failed in a small way, day after day. Like holding a rope in my hands, the invisible weight on the other side of the cliff just heavy enough to slide down little by little, until the end slipped through my fingers. The cause, I know now, lay just here under my skin. In the texture of my tissue, in the twisting of my DNA. Simply made this way. Unfit. Unfit despite my best efforts and all my good intentions. Unfit because of my attempts and intentions. An inherent, inescapable, deep-rooted, total, frustrating, miserable unsuitability: I cannot be a wife to that man. I cannot be a mother to that child. And the strong possibility that I can't be a wife to anyone, that I am generally, simply unsuited to be a wife and a mother.From her handbag, her cellphone began to ring. She closed the mattress valve carefully, deliberately. She guessed it was Christo. Her ex-husband. For all practical purposes.The envelope had reached him.She took the cellphone out of her handbag and checked the screen. It was Christo's number at work.He would be sitting in his office with her letter in front of him. And the documents from the attorney, drawn up in a hurry on Saturday afternoon. Christo would have the door closed, that angry expression on his face, that you-fucking-miserable-stupid-woman version. The swearwords would be damming up. If she answered his call he would open the sluice gates with: 'Jissis, Milla.'She stared at the screen, her heart thumping, hands trembling. She lowered the phone back into her bag. The screen glowed inside with an unholy light.Eventually the ring went over to voicemail, the light dimmed. She knew he would leave a message. Cursing.She turned away from the handbag and made a decision: she would change her number. Before she sat down beside the mattress again, the phone beeped to say she had a message.5 August 2009. Wednesday.They came to deliver the Ardo fridge late that afternoon. When they had left, Milla stood listening to its reassuring hum. She inspected its chunky shape and thought, here is something to hold on to. The first, solid shield against going back, against being swallowed up, against the fear of a formless future. This was a new unease she felt, the anxiety over money. A bed, a couch, table, chairs, desk, curtains, everything was ordered, a small fortune.Her nest egg, her modest inheritance, had shrunk quite considerably.She would have to find work. Urgently. For the money. But also for the liberation of it."|Trackers|"Deon Meyer"

"ap ~ 10:14"|"around 10.14"|"At around 10.14 on the Wednesday morning of the second of September, the red Toyota Corolla with an Eastern Cape registration number stopped in front of 16A Chamberlain Street. The house was one of six single-storey semi-detached houses, each painted a different bright colour. Number 16A was an indescribable pinky-purple, with red-painted tops on the two pillars of the equally red garden gate. A coloured man and woman in their thirties took their time getting out of the car, stretching, as if the journey had been long and wearying, before approaching the little gate and entering.

She felt comfortable, as though she were developing a style, the working woman adapted to the informality of the Report Squad. She sat behind her computer at a quarter to nine, reading her first News This Week, the titbits from Limpopo and Mpumalanga. There was an air of expectation in the office. Theunie, one of the two bald men who were both very comfortable with the respectful Afrikaans address form of 'Oom', had said there was Something Big brewing, because Bigfoot had summoned Mother, a definite omen.Oom Theunie and his nicknames. 'Mother' was Mrs Killian, 'Bigfoot' referred to Rajkumar, the fat Indian, whom he also called 'AS', short for 'Abominable Snowman', or 'The Incredible Bulk', or sometimes just 'The Bulk'.Milla he called 'Carmen', Jessica, 'Freia' (or 'The Goddess' when referring to her in the third person), Don MacFarland, the other old man in the team, was 'Mac' of' Mac the Wife'. 'Why ""Mac the Wife""?' she had asked.Don answered her himself. 'Because I'm gay, my dear.'At a quarter to nine Mrs Killian hurried in and called them together with a bundle of thin folders in her hand.'The Bulk has spoken,' said Oom Theunie.'Theunie, you are going to write the executive summary, the rest of you will be doing addenda.' She handed Milla a folder. 'Your subject is Johnson Chitepo, see if you can find something more recent on the Internet, and let Theunie explain how the format works. Jess, you will be doing Sayyid Khalid bin Alawi Macki...''Who?''It's all in here, but it's badly dated. Interesting man. Don, I'm giving you the important stuff.''Of course you are.''Qibla, the Supreme Committee, al-Qaeda, and a brand new subject.

She is such an enigma, with her looks she could have been a model.Highlight of the day: the tango. I struggled with it. Then Mr Soderstrom said the tango is four legs, two bodies, one heart. 'Most dances,' he quoted someone, 'are for people who are falling in love. The tango is a dance for those who have survived it, and are still a little angry about having their hearts so badly treated.' Then I understood.10 September 2009. Thursday.They stood staring at the TV screen with grim faces. Rajkumar was the only one sitting. Quinn and Masilo stood.They watched the video footage of the members of the Supreme Committee arriving within minutes of each other - Suleiman Dolly the last one - and entering the front door of 15 Chamberlain Street.Via the EAM in the satellite dish support they heard the men talking. The sound was hollow and fuzzy. Rajkumar's team would use programming to refine it later. But it was still good enough to hear the extremists greeting each other, light-heartedly enquiring about each other's health inside the house.'Come. The agenda this morning is short.' It was probably Suleiman Dolly's voice coming over the system, and the three observers pricked up their ears. Hope burgeoned.'That's understandable, Sheikh,' said another Committee member.'Why haven't we had any news yet? We've run out of time,' said another.'We must just have faith,' said Dolly.'Allahu Akbar.''Come, let us go,' said Dolly.Quinn looked at Masilo.'Does that mean what I think it means?' asked Rajkumar. 'Hang on,' said Masilo.Over the loudspeakers came the sound of feet shuffling. 'They are moving,' said Raj and looked at the blueprints of number 15, which were spread out in front of the big TV screen. The question was, where to? And how well the EAM would work. The loudspeakers fell silent'Shit,' said Raj. 'They're going down to the basement.' Quinn adjusted the volume. There was a hissing, very faint echoes of a man's voice, but indecipherable.'Would you be able to filter that?' asked Quinn. Rajkumar shook his head, very disappointed. 'Probably not.' They stood and listened to the speakers, till the last shred of hope evaporated.'Come on, Raj,' said Masilo, encouragingly. 'We all knew the chances were going to be slim. They are not stupid.''I know. But fuck knows, we need a break. I mean, we deserve it. Just a bit of luck.''All things come to those who wait,' said Tau Masilo. Rajkumar completed the saying in his usual, pessimistic manner. 'They come, but often come too late.'11 September 2009. Friday.Janina Mentz was on her way to the office of the Minister of Safety and Security, three blocks away, for their
eleven o'clock appointment.She walked erect, full of confidence, in the rain. She had prepared well. In her briefcase was The Report. But that was just the final planting of the seed. First she had to do the spadework, the much more important preparation of the seedbed. She had planned the process, visualised it: the Minister, a jovial man with shaven head and an easy smile, would receive her cordially and ask her to take tea with him. She would accept with thanks. She would sit down, take her time opening the combination locks of the briefcase, take out the file, but keep it on her lap.He would ask how things were with her, and the Agency. She would say things were going particularly well, thank you, Mr Minister. And thank you for making time on such short notice, but I wanted to bring this to your attention as quickly as possible. Especially in the light of recent events.She would wait for his reaction, for the raising of an eyebrow and freezing of his smile. Then she would say, choosing her words carefully, that it was a sensitive issue. Too ... awkward to discuss at the weekly Security Meeting.She would let that sink in. The Minister was a clever man. He would draw the necessary conclusions. Perhaps she would help things along a little by emphasising that only the PIA had access to this information (with a nod in the direction of the file). That it was consequently safe.And then she would tell the Minister that it had to do with arms dealing.She would depend on the baggage connected to the last term, baggage that the ruling party and the candidate for the new intelligence superstructure could not shake off. And on the latest controversy, so timeously unleashed by the Opposition. That ought to make the Minister's heart rate speed up. Janina Mentz was depending on it.Again she would delay, before she made the next, complex revelation.Sir, there are Muslim extremists involved. And all indications that they are planning an act of terrorism in Cape Town. Using imported weapons ...That would give him something to ruminate over.We are going to focus all possible resources on this, because we are so aware of what a difficult position this could place the President.The Minister would understand what the 'difficult position' meant. Given the arms sales to Iran and Libya.And then she would slowly raise the file from her lap and place it solemnly on his desk. As if she bore a great weight.Should you want to discuss this case in any way once you have studied the detail, I am at your service twenty-four hours a day.Before the Parliament Street crossing Janina Mentz lifted her briefcase to look at her wristwatch. A little too early. She slowed her pace, holding the umbrella tightly while the cold front raged around her."|Trackers|"Deon Meyer"

'So?''So, do I include it?''Of course. Spy the Beloved Country, even if it hurts.' 'OK.'Report: Criminal Gangs of the Cape FlatsDate: 14 September 2009Compiled by: Milla Strachan and Donald MacFarland  BackgroundIn the last decade of the Apartheid-era, gang-related activities in the former Cape Province were limited mostly to the former coloured group areas, especially in the lower socio-economic neighbourhoods of the Cape Flats.The type and extent of their crimes was relatively limited, mainly as a result of international isolation, limitation by the Group Areas Act, and aneffective, experienced police force with extensive powers, including detention without trial and dubious interrogation methods.This situation began to change subtly in the early nineties, when the former SA Police Force was used more and more for suppression of political unrest. Street gangs could relax, accelerate their recruitment and systematically expand their activities, which up till then were small-scale and limited.It was in fact the transition to a democratic government in 1994, and the major changes in the following six years, that gave organised crime the opportunity to move from a cottage industry to international players. The following factors apply:Post 1994: Opening of borders and international influxDispensing with strict border control, and South Africa's re-entry to international trade resulted in an influx of foreign tourists, currency and investment, which included the most notorious players in trans-national organised crime. It was primarily the syndicates from Nigeria, Russia, China, Italy and Colombia who saw the opportunities, and who rapidly established themselves, mainly in Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town.It is estimated that more than 100,000 Nigerian nationals illegally entered South Africa in that period, and settled here.Existing infrastructureDespite the country's isolation, the South Africa of 1994 possessed excellent infrastructure - a highly efficient banking service, excellent telecommunications networks, and extensive road-, rail-, and air-links.Crime syndicates benefited just as much from these as the foreign investors and legal new businesses.In addition, there was already a basic framework of organised crime in place, in the form of the gangs of the Cape Peninsula. Heroin and cocaine in particular began flooding into the country, and found an existing basic handling and distribution network, however unsophisticated.The smuggling of, and trade in, other drugs, arms, ivory, wood, precious stones, abalone and humans, increased gradually.A weakened police force and modern legislationIn the midst of the influx of trans-national crime syndicates, from 1994 to 1998 the former SAP transformed into the new South African PoliceServices (SAPS). Ironically, the consequences of this process would be considered one of the key factors in the rise of organised crime in the Western Cape in particular.Affirmative Action, a high percentage of resignations and retirements of senior officers, retraining and redeployment, alteration of structures and transfers not only led to massive loss of experience within police ranks, but also seriously harmed trust between members and general morale within the Service. Infighting, frustration, obstruction and politicisation contributed to the SAPS taking its eye off the ball of organised crime.Legislation on criminal procedure, founded on modern, humanitarian, and internationally acceptable human rights principles, also followed during this period, forcing law enforcers to respect the rights of suspects, change arrest protocols and interrogation techniques considerably (including a total shift from the so-called confession formula - read physical intimidation - of the Apartheid-era).To a large degree, crime intelligence collapsed as a result of this, and had to be rebuilt from the ground up.The result was a window of opportunity for organised crime, which was utilised fully.PAGAD, CORE and POCAWith the police paralysed, civilian resistance to crime in the coloured areas exploded. The most famous of these was PAGAD (People against Gangsterism and Drugs), the Muslim pressure group that initiated vigilantism against gang bosses in the Cape Flats in 1996.Marches on drug houses, shooting incidents, assaults and elimination of leaders seriously interfered with existing gangs, destroyed command structures, and dramatically limited criminal activities.It was an evolutionary process for gang leaders - only the strongest survived. The remaining syndicate bosses reacted by forming the Community Outreach Forum, or CORE. The name was deliberately cynical, and had nothing to do with the community whatsoever. It was a consolidation and regrouping, and, for the first time in their history, organised crime bosses agreed to cooperate. They set up a small, effective executive committee, which, within months, had streamlined money laundering, smuggling and international cooperation and taken them to new heights of professionalism and secrecy.The other consequence of PAGAD's behaviour was that the senior management of the gangs moved out of the coloured community and into traditional white neighbourhoods - and expanded their activities to these areas as well. The sale, especially of cocaine and marijuana, among others, found a new market.A final factor was the parliamentary acceptance of the POCA (Prevention of Organised Crime Act), wide-reaching legislation that also gave the State the power to confiscate the assets of gang leaders and their confederates.The Restless RavensThe Restless Ravens were a relatively small, but very effective street gang that in the early nineties mainly operated in Manenberg, Bonteheuwel, Bishop Lavis, Heideveld, Surrey and Primrose Park.Their leader was the ruthless, ambitious and highly intelligent Willem (Willy) 'Tweetybird' de la Cruz (53), who had by then already served two terms in jail, for assault (1978-1981), and robbery (1983-1988). He owed his nickname to his hobby, the breeding of budgies, but also from the ritual of placing a living bird in the mouth of traitors after he had killed them.De la Cruz and the Restless Ravens profited largely from the chaos that PAGAD caused in 1996. Particularly because they were small and therefore seen as less of a threat, PAGAD generally left them in peace. Not only did the Restless Ravens survive this period, but as a result of the vigilantism, they acquired new recruits and new territories.De la Cruz was also one of the founding members of CORE, and with his good negotiation and networking skills he played a key role in the alliance. He also recognised, from an early stage, the threat of the POCA laws and the application of them through the special investigation unit, the Scorpions.His fear that authorities would seize his considerable financial and property assets led him to make two important appointments - each one a confidant whom he had met in prison.The first was an accountant, the former bookkeeper Moegamat Perkins, (49, sentence for fraud served out from 1982-1988), who had to ensure that the assets of the Ravens were, firstly, not in the name of de la Cruz, and secondly, structured so that confiscation was well-nigh impossible.The second appointment was that of a 'general', a strongman who could assert the Ravens' authority through murder, assault and intimidation, but also a counterweight to ensure that the influence of the accountant, Perkins, was limited. His choice fell on Terrence Richard Baadjies (50, 'Terry','Terror', 'The Terrorist' - sentenced to a young offenders' institution at age 15 for murder, later serving jail time for dealing in forbidden substances, assault with intent, and manslaughter).Both appointments were master strokes. When the Scorpions, and especially the SAPS Unit for Organised Crime, seized nearly R200 million in gang assets in the Cape Peninsula in the period 2000 to 2006, the Restless Ravens were untouchable. With Terror and his soldiers always ready to take over disadvantaged syndicates' business through violent means, the Restless Ravens developed into one of the most successful criminal organisations during the same period. De la Cruz's prominence in CORE was also boosted.Recruitment of young coloured men from the Cape Flats into the Ravens was also helped considerably by the socio-economic deterioration of that community since 1994. Some of the most important factors are:The drug Tik (Methamphetamine, or 'Meth'): 91 % of all Tik dependents are coloured - with an average age of 16.6 years.18% of all coloured youths between the ages of 14 and 34 are in jail for crimes.21.8% of coloured youths at age 16 are not at school. 48% of the coloured community are economically inactive, or unemployed. (Of a total of 2.7 million, 975,000 are economically inactive and 340,000 unemployed.)In conclusion:The success of the Restless Ravens (and their POCA evasion) has attracted just the sort of attention they wished to avoid. According to a recent report in Die Burger (28 August 2009) the new provincial DA government in the Western Cape has given instructions that a special prosecutor be appointed to investigate the activities of the gang - with an eye to charges of tax evasion."|Trackers|"Deon Meyer"

'So?''So, do I include it?''Of course. Spy the Beloved Country, even if it hurts.' 'OK.'Report: Criminal Gangs of the Cape FlatsDate: 14 September 2009Compiled by: Milla Strachan and Donald MacFarland  BackgroundIn the last decade of the Apartheid-era, gang-related activities in the former Cape Province were limited mostly to the former coloured group areas, especially in the lower socio-economic neighbourhoods of the Cape Flats.The type and extent of their crimes was relatively limited, mainly as a result of international isolation, limitation by the Group Areas Act, and aneffective, experienced police force with extensive powers, including detention without trial and dubious interrogation methods.This situation began to change subtly in the early nineties, when the former SA Police Force was used more and more for suppression of political unrest. Street gangs could relax, accelerate their recruitment and systematically expand their activities, which up till then were small-scale and limited.It was in fact the transition to a democratic government in 1994, and the major changes in the following six years, that gave organised crime the opportunity to move from a cottage industry to international players. The following factors apply:Post 1994: Opening of borders and international influxDispensing with strict border control, and South Africa's re-entry to international trade resulted in an influx of foreign tourists, currency and investment, which included the most notorious players in trans-national organised crime. It was primarily the syndicates from Nigeria, Russia, China, Italy and Colombia who saw the opportunities, and who rapidly established themselves, mainly in Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town.It is estimated that more than 100,000 Nigerian nationals illegally entered South Africa in that period, and settled here.Existing infrastructureDespite the country's isolation, the South Africa of 1994 possessed excellent infrastructure - a highly efficient banking service, excellent telecommunications networks, and extensive road-, rail-, and air-links.Crime syndicates benefited just as much from these as the foreign investors and legal new businesses.In addition, there was already a basic framework of organised crime in place, in the form of the gangs of the Cape Peninsula. Heroin and cocaine in particular began flooding into the country, and found an existing basic handling and distribution network, however unsophisticated.The smuggling of, and trade in, other drugs, arms, ivory, wood, precious stones, abalone and humans, increased gradually.A weakened police force and modern legislationIn the midst of the influx of trans-national crime syndicates, from 1994 to 1998 the former SAP transformed into the new South African PoliceServices (SAPS). Ironically, the consequences of this process would be considered one of the key factors in the rise of organised crime in the Western Cape in particular.Affirmative Action, a high percentage of resignations and retirements of senior officers, retraining and redeployment, alteration of structures and transfers not only led to massive loss of experience within police ranks, but also seriously harmed trust between members and general morale within the Service. Infighting, frustration, obstruction and politicisation contributed to the SAPS taking its eye off the ball of organised crime.Legislation on criminal procedure, founded on modern, humanitarian, and internationally acceptable human rights principles, also followed during this period, forcing law enforcers to respect the rights of suspects, change arrest protocols and interrogation techniques considerably (including a total shift from the so-called confession formula - read physical intimidation - of the Apartheid-era).To a large degree, crime intelligence collapsed as a result of this, and had to be rebuilt from the ground up.The result was a window of opportunity for organised crime, which was utilised fully.PAGAD, CORE and POCAWith the police paralysed, civilian resistance to crime in the coloured areas exploded. The most famous of these was PAGAD (People against Gangsterism and Drugs), the Muslim pressure group that initiated vigilantism against gang bosses in the Cape Flats in 1996.Marches on drug houses, shooting incidents, assaults and elimination of leaders seriously interfered with existing gangs, destroyed command structures, and dramatically limited criminal activities.It was an evolutionary process for gang leaders - only the strongest survived. The remaining syndicate bosses reacted by forming the Community Outreach Forum, or CORE. The name was deliberately cynical, and had nothing to do with the community whatsoever. It was a consolidation and regrouping, and, for the first time in their history, organised crime bosses agreed to cooperate. They set up a small, effective executive committee, which, within months, had streamlined money laundering, smuggling and international cooperation and taken them to new heights of professionalism and secrecy.The other consequence of PAGAD's behaviour was that the senior management of the gangs moved out of the coloured community and into traditional white neighbourhoods - and expanded their activities to these areas as well. The sale, especially of cocaine and marijuana, among others, found a new market.A final factor was the parliamentary acceptance of the POCA (Prevention of Organised Crime Act), wide-reaching legislation that also gave the State the power to confiscate the assets of gang leaders and their confederates.The Restless RavensThe Restless Ravens were a relatively small, but very effective street gang that in the early nineties mainly operated in Manenberg, Bonteheuwel, Bishop Lavis, Heideveld, Surrey and Primrose Park.Their leader was the ruthless, ambitious and highly intelligent Willem (Willy) 'Tweetybird' de la Cruz (53), who had by then already served two terms in jail, for assault (1978-1981), and robbery (1983-1988). He owed his nickname to his hobby, the breeding of budgies, but also from the ritual of placing a living bird in the mouth of traitors after he had killed them.De la Cruz and the Restless Ravens profited largely from the chaos that PAGAD caused in 1996. Particularly because they were small and therefore seen as less of a threat, PAGAD generally left them in peace. Not only did the Restless Ravens survive this period, but as a result of the vigilantism, they acquired new recruits and new territories.De la Cruz was also one of the founding members of CORE, and with his good negotiation and networking skills he played a key role in the alliance. He also recognised, from an early stage, the threat of the POCA laws and the application of them through the special investigation unit, the Scorpions.His fear that authorities would seize his considerable financial and property assets led him to make two important appointments - each one a confidant whom he had met in prison.The first was an accountant, the former bookkeeper Moegamat Perkins, (49, sentence for fraud served out from 1982-1988), who had to ensure that the assets of the Ravens were, firstly, not in the name of de la Cruz, and secondly, structured so that confiscation was well-nigh impossible.The second appointment was that of a 'general', a strongman who could assert the Ravens' authority through murder, assault and intimidation, but also a counterweight to ensure that the influence of the accountant, Perkins, was limited. His choice fell on Terrence Richard Baadjies (50, 'Terry','Terror', 'The Terrorist' - sentenced to a young offenders' institution at age 15 for murder, later serving jail time for dealing in forbidden substances, assault with intent, and manslaughter).Both appointments were master strokes. When the Scorpions, and especially the SAPS Unit for Organised Crime, seized nearly R200 million in gang assets in the Cape Peninsula in the period 2000 to 2006, the Restless Ravens were untouchable. With Terror and his soldiers always ready to take over disadvantaged syndicates' business through violent means, the Restless Ravens developed into one of the most successful criminal organisations during the same period. De la Cruz's prominence in CORE was also boosted.Recruitment of young coloured men from the Cape Flats into the Ravens was also helped considerably by the socio-economic deterioration of that community since 1994. Some of the most important factors are:The drug Tik (Methamphetamine, or 'Meth'): 91 % of all Tik dependents are coloured - with an average age of 16.6 years.18% of all coloured youths between the ages of 14 and 34 are in jail for crimes.21.8% of coloured youths at age 16 are not at school. 48% of the coloured community are economically inactive, or unemployed. (Of a total of 2.7 million, 975,000 are economically inactive and 340,000 unemployed.)In conclusion:The success of the Restless Ravens (and their POCA evasion) has attracted just the sort of attention they wished to avoid.

I had finished my big breakfast with gusto; the filter coffee tasted rich and strong. Emma was still eating her fresh scones with jam and cream, slowly and with obvious pleasure. A pot of tea stood waiting. Her skin glowed and there was a blush to her cheeks, because only two hours earlier we had been entangled on the sheets of my bed. Now she was describing the book she was reading in a voice that was always deeper than her delicate figure suggested. On the perfect bow of her lip, a fleck of cream, like a snowflake.It was all too good to be true, because I am Lemmer. The gods must have woken, because a faint sound, deep, mechanical, grew louder, until Emma stopped talking and turned her head. Tannie Wilna, the heart and soul of the Red Pomegranate, came in from the kitchen wiping her hands on her skirt. 'Do you hear that too?'We listened as the rolling thunder grew, the direction clearer. An invasion via the Carnarvon Road.We all looked out on the wide traffic circle around the church. The village seemed to pause, people tumbled out of the general dealer, out of the farmers co-op. A group of coloured children came running from the direction of the church hall, their shouts drowned in the cacophony. They pointed excited fingers up the street.A dramatic entry on the traffic circle, at nine o'clock: outlandish creatures of chunky chrome, steel and black. Long leather tassels fluttering from handlebars and saddlebags, four Harley Davidsons - the riders in shades and stupid helmets, garish bandanas pulled over their mouths and noses, arms and legs stretched to reach the pedals and handlebars. They disappeared behind the church, followed the curve around to the restaurant and pulled up in front of it. They shoved the back ends of the bikes towards us, neatly in line, the front wheels pointing to the street. A final revving of the engines, an ear-splitting racket, stands kicked out and the bandanas pulled down.Merciful silence.The number plates were tiny. I read them in order. NV ME. BOY'S TOY. LOUD, PROUD. And HELLRAZOR. All from the Cape.NV ME climbed down from his throne, unbuckled his helmet, pulled off the fingerless leather gloves, then the tasselled leather jacket. He had steel grey hair, stylishly and expensively trimmed, and a boyish face full of confidence. The T-shirt somewhat tight.He cast an imperious gaze across Loxton. 'Fucking one-horse town,' was his verdict, pronounced for all to hear.The labourers from the shop sidled up, the children came running.All four riders had their feet on solid ground, leather trousers, shiny black boots, adorned with silver baroque. All were on the fib-side of forty. Number two was big, maybe two metres tall, number three was short and small with a ratface. Number four was average, but sporty.'Stand back! You can look, but no touching,' Steel Grey ordered the children.They stared at him wide-eyed, but kept their distance.The Knights of Harley trooped in, led by Steel Grey, followed by Ratface and Sporty. The Big Guy covered the rear. A pecking order.'Good morning,' Tannie Wilna said, 'welcome to Loxton,' with the affectionate warmth she offered everybody.They inspected her and her restaurant. 'Do you have any beer?' Steel Grey asked, unimpressed.Emma turned back to me, shaking her head slightly and ate her scone.'Unfortunately we are not licensed, but the bottle store is just across the way. I'll send Mietjie over quickly. Please, sit down ...' and she held out her hand to the large table for six.Steel Grey checked me over once. Ratface eyed Emma speculatively.They sat down. The back of Sporty's T-shirt read 'If you can read this, the bitch fell off.?Tannie Wilna brought them menus. 'What beer do you prefer?''Black Label,' said Steel Grey. 'Cold.''Run over and fetch us four Black Labels from Zelda, please,' Tannie Wilna said to Mietjie. 'Ask her for the cold ones.''Make that twelve, Aunty,' said Steel Grey.'Lots of drinking to do,' said the Big Guy.'The Thirstland Trek,' said Ratface, court jester to the House of Harley. They all laughed. Hu-hu-hu. Comrades.Mietjie went out on her errand. A moment's silence.Outside four coloured people rode by on a donkey cart towards Beaufort, the hooves clip-clopping on the tar. Sporty watched them, and said, 'Back roads.' The others guffawed again, some in-joke. They began a conversation, voices louder than necessary so that we, the audience, could listen.Emma gave me a small, nostalgic smile, acknowledging that our magic moment was over."|Trackers|"Deon Meyer"
"ap 23:55"|"Five to twelve"|"Lotter looked like a middle-aged rock star. Balding, the hair he still had all gathered into a ponytail, with round spectacles on a gypsy face. 1 le shook my hand with a friendly smile, took my black sports bag and walked over to the aircraft. It was incredibly small, a toy plane in white, red and blue, with a Perspex bubble dome over the cabin, two seats, and a slim joystick where you would have expected something more substantial. It looked like the sort referred to in news bulletins as a microlight, usually followed by the word 'crashed'.Emma inspected it curiously, caught up in what she had just referred to as my 'fun adventure'.Diederik Brand came to stand beside me. 'You don't have to worry, Lotter is an international champion.'It wasn't how he flew that worried me, but what he flew. I held my tongue.'This is just in case,' Brand said, and passed me a package wrapped in a grimy cloth.I smelled gun oil, and started to unwrap it.He put a hand over it. 'I would wait until you're in the air ...' and he cast a significant look at Emma. 'I don't want to upset her.''Is there something I should know?''You know how it is on our roads,' he said.I hesitated. My Glock 37, with ten .45 GAP rounds in the magazine, was in my sports bag. I didn't need anything else. But Diederik Brand had already turned away and walked towards the deathtrap. He clapped his hands, 'Come on, you must get moving.'I checked my watch. Five to twelve.Two hours ago my life had been a breeze."|Trackers|"Deon Meyer"
"ap 02:20"|"twenty past two"|"At twenty past two we came in low over the sewerage works and the graveyard, with the town on our right. Lotter touched down as light as a feather, with casual ease, made a U-turn and taxied back to the eastern end, then right on a pipe-stem access road to a collection of low buildings and hangars. He stopped and opened the clips of the cabin dome. Heat flowed in thick and heavy."|Trackers|"Deon Meyer"
"ap 02:45"|"quarter to three"|"The only shelter from the excruciating sun was four forlorn, almost leafless trees. I put my bag down and searched for a little bit of shade, leaned against a rough trunk. My shirt was stuck to my back, sweat stung my eyes. I had no hat.I checked my watch.

I got to my feet and took it out of my trouser pocket, hoping it was Diederik Brand. There was a lot I had to say to him.It was Oom Joe van Wyk. Of Loxton. 'Lemmer, ou maat, I hear Diederik has got you into something.''Yes, Oom,' addressing him in the Karoo vernacular.'Did he pay you up front?''I don't know, Oom Joe, he's working through my employer.''Oh. No, that's all right then. And what must you do for him?''I'm not at liberty to say.''Ay, that Diederik,' he laughed his happy laugh. 'Well then, sterkte, Lemmer, ou maat,' he wished me well as his 'old friend'. 'Tante Anna sends her regards.'At ten to four my phone rang again. Oom Ben Bruwer, the builder in Loxton, the man who I had consulted about my rotting roof. 'So, you're working for Diederik Brand.' A reproach.'Only for a day or two, Oom.'He chewed over the information. 'Nonetheless, if I were you I would ask for a deposit.

'Have you been waiting long, Oom?'The le Riche family were a Loxton legend.My knowledge was limited, from bits of stories told here and there. They farmed out on the Pampoenpoort Road, merino
sheep on 6,000 hectares, no labourers on the farm. The family did everything themselves - father, mother, two sons and a daughter. Like their parents, the children were sinewy and tough.Lourens, the oldest, was a final-year agricultural student at Stellenbosch. He paid for his own studies, taking every possible opportunity to earn a few rand. Like this one. I wondered if he had got his money up front. But I didn't ask because I was sticky with sweat, hot and angry.'Oom Diederik said you would be here around five o'clock,' he explained his time of arrival as he pulled away. 'So I took a nap, because we're going to pull an all-nighter.' His face was angular: high forehead, a determined chin, easy smile. 'Did you have a good flight, Oom?'It was the innocence in his voice that stopped me from taking out my frustration on him. I felt the refreshing air conditioning, angled the vent in the instrument panel towards me, turned the knob of the fan up and said, 'No, not really. And you don't have to call me Oom.''OK, Oom.'I shifted the sports bag into the space behind the seats, put on my seat belt and settled into the seat.'Diederik was a bit vague about our schedule.''We are going to get something to eat in town now, Oom, because we are loading tonight after dark.

"ap 05:00"|five-o'clock|"I was expecting a clandestine smuggling rendezvous in the dark, with people sneaking about and urgent whispering somewhere in the thick bush. What we got was the brightly lit, busy yard of an irrigation farm on the banks of the Limpopo River.A dozen black labourers sat and talked loudly on the concrete edge of a long steel shed, waiting. On the tailgate of a white Land Cruiser sat two white men in khaki shorts, khaki-and-green shirts, long socks, short work boots. As we drove into the yard, they jumped off. One was young, early twenties, the other well into his forties.Lourens stopped. We climbed out. The white men approached. 'Lourens?' asked the older, and stretched out his hand.'That's me, Oom.''Wickus Swanepoel,' he pronounced the 'W' as a 'V', 'and this is my son, Swannie.''And this is Oom Lemmer ...'We shook hands. They were two big men with five-o'clock-shadows, farmers' tans, identical snub noses, and bushy eyebrows. Pa Wickus's leather belt was slung low to accommodate a beer belly.'Their truck is waiting at the border, over there,' he said, and pointed north. 'Are you ready?''Yes, we're ready, Oom.'Wickus looked at his son. 'Tell them they can come. Make sure they have deflated the tyres. And that they know about the poles.'Swannie took a cellphone out of his shorts pocket and phoned. His father said, 'We thought it better to wait for dark before they came across. Just in case.'Just in case, I thought. Diederik's words.The son was talking on the cellphone: 'Cornel, you can come across, they are here. Have you let air out of your tyres?''Turn your truck around so long,' Wickus said to Lourens. 'And open the back doors.''Right, Oom,' Lourens said. 'How long will it take?''They are just here, across the river, in the orchards on the Zim side. If they don't get stuck in the bloody sand they will be here now-now.'Lourens got into the Mercedes.'They're coming, Pa,' said Swannie, the son.'Did you tell them to look out for the marker poles?''No, Pa. But they say they can see our lights.''No, oh Koot, that's just like a woman, the lights won't help fuck all if they don't watch the markers.''Don't worry, Pa.'Lourens turned the Mercedes around so the nose pointed back in the direction we had come. Wickus Swanepoel walked over to where the labourers sat talking. He gave orders in their language. They stood up and came closer. Wickus gave more orders and pointed at some thick metal bars that lay in the doorway of the shed. Half of the labourers went over and got them.Lourens switched off the Mercedes, jumped down and slid open the bolts of the rearmost grey steel doors.'I hear they have a Bedford, might be a little lower than your load bed, if so we will get out the pulleys,' said Wickus.'I hear them, Pa,' said Swannie.The rumble of a diesel engine could be heard out of the darkness, at high revs.'Oh hell,' said Wickus, 'I hope the bugger knows how to drive in sand.'Lourens came closer. We stood four in a row, eyes to the north in the direction of the noise. 'Sand is loose this time of year,' said Wickus. 'Soft. Powder. River is dry. If they haven't let down the tyres they will get stuck. Then we're stuffed.''Don't worry, Pa.''Someone has to fokken worry.''Listen, they're through.'The engine's revs were lower now, more controlled.'So why doesn't he put his lights on?''Don't worry, Pa.''Stop saying that to me.''But we don't have to worry, Pa. We have all the permits this side.''Those people still have to bugger off back to Zim tonight, and they don't have papers.'Then we saw the lorry, an old Bedford, appear out of the dark at the furthest extent of the lighted circle.'Thank God,' said Wickus Swanepoel. 'It's an old RL.''Pa?''Was about the only Bedford with four-wheel drive,' his father said, as the lorry stopped in front of us. It looked like an old military vehicle, the green paint bleached and worn, but there was nothing wrong with the engine. A black driver sat behind the wheel, yellow vest, muscular arms, cigarette in mouth.The passenger door opened. A woman jumped down lightly. She ignored us, moved straight to the back of the vehicle, which was covered by a dirty grey tarpaulin. She began untying ropes.'Hell's bells!' said Pa Wickus, fervent, but under his breath. Because at first sight she was spectacular. Shoulders, arms and legs had the muscular definition of an athlete. Pitch black hair pulled back in a careless ponytail, the neck long and elegant, a fine sheen of perspiration on the honey skin, her face dominated by strong, high cheekbones. Lara Croft of the Limpopo, in boots, tight khaki shorts, and a sleeveless white T-shirt that clearly displayed her generous breasts.'Cornel?' asked Swannie, the son. He sounded overjoyed to connect the voice on the telephone with this apparition.She looked at him. 'Come and help,' she ordered.Swannie didn't move at once. 'Flea?' he asked astonished. 'Flea van Jaarsveld?'She bristled. 'I don't know you.''We were in primary school together,' said Swannie, with a tone of deep gratitude that he had a connection to her. 'Jissie, Flea, you've changed.''My name's Cornel. Are you going to help, or just stand there looking?' she said, and turned her attention back to removing the tarpaulin.'Man, it's so great to see you again.' And Swannie went right over to help her."|Trackers|"Deon Meyer"
"ap 09:40"|"twenty to ten"|"We got away at twenty to ten. Flea threw a blood-red travel bag and the doctor's bag in the cab, climbed up after them, and made herself at home in the passenger seat. As I climbed up after her, she looked at me. 'Are you coming too?' Not exactly jubilant about the possibility.'This is Oom Lemmer,' was all that Lourens
said. Then he took out two big soft cushions and put them over the hump between the two seats, stowed her baggage, arranged the cushions properly, one on her seat and one behind her back.The Swanepoels stood outside, beside my window, with eyes only for her. 'You know where we are now, Cornel. Come and visit,' Wickus Swanepoel called out hopefully. Beside him, his son approved the invitation with a vigorously nodding head, the bushy brows raised high in enthusiasm. Then they waved one last time and we drove away into the darkness."|Trackers|"Deon Meyer"

By two o'clock we should be 300 kilometres from here, maybe a bit more ...'She took them in silence, lowered her legs, and studied the uppermost document, a white sheet of paper with columns of places and distances. She unfolded the map and compared the two, her slender finger finding direction on the spider web of roads over Vaalwater, Rustenburg, Ventersdorp ... until she looked up at him. I couldn't see her face, but I could hear the frown in her voice: 'This is one helluva obscure route. Why don't we just take the Nl?'For the first time I saw the ghostly line of an old scar on her neck. It curled from below her left ear and under her hair, a fine pattern like the outline of a bird's wing, only one shade lighter than her skin.'Oom Diederik wants us to stay off the main routes. And ...''Why?' Sharp and accusatory.'Weighbridges,' Lourens said, but calm and controlled.'Weighbridges?''Long distances are all about average speed, and nothing breaks your average speed like a weighbridge. At every weighbridge you lose plus-minus an hour, and there are five between Musina and Kimberley if we take the N1 and the N12. In any case, this route is almost a hundred kilometres shorter.'I was proud of him: he would not let himself be intimidated, his tone of voice was relaxed, he was not looking for her approval, merely giving information courteously and pleasantly. Impressive for a young man already blindly in love.She traced the route with her finger again, shook her head. 'No. We will have to drive via Bela-Bela. I need light when I sedate them.'He looked where her finger pointed. 'All right,' he said. 'We'll stop there.'She folded up the map, smugly, as if she had won this round. She put it on top of the dashboard, in the hollow behind the cup holders, drew her legs up again and dropped her head onto her knees to discourage further communication.It was going to be an interesting trip.The cornerstone of my profession was the art of reading people. To identify threats, to understand the one you protected, to predict situations and prevent them. It had become a habit, a ritual, sometimes a game, to watch and listen and patch the bits of incidental information together into a profile that was continually adapted and expanded, every time one step closer to the truth. The problem, I had learned over two decades, was that we are deceitful animals. We skilfully weave a false front, often extensive and complex, fact and fiction in a delicate blend to accentuate the good and acceptable, and to hide the bad.The art was to analyse the front as well, since that largely exposed what was hidden behind it.There was a great deal that betrayed Flea van Jaarsveld: this attitude of irritable superiority. The deliberate distance she maintained between herself and us. The exaggerated use of learned medical terminology. Her nickname. The insistence that she was now Cornel - ten to one her own twisting of Cornelia, as it sounded much more dignified. Add to that the choice of clothing that needlessly accentuated her assets. Because she was pretty, despite the slight deficiencies. Or perhaps because of those negligible imperfections.The majority of Body Armour's clientele were attractive people who had grown up in wealth. They generally had an effortless assumption of privilege, a natural distance from the common crowd, an ease with, and often a concealing of, beauty.In shrill contrast with Flea.

Another way of saying 'you can get out of this'.But it was the physical flowering that would have been the breakthrough.

Clever and pretty is a strong platform from which to launch yourself.And she had.So she would have advanced to this point with fierce determination, and now had the realistic expectation of a Good Catch.

"ap 02:45"|"two forty-five"|"There is a place I go. I found it as a child, a no-man's-land, a refuge. It has protective walls, but it is not a room. Not an open space, but I can see and hear the comforting sea. I am aware of where my body is, the pain faraway and faint, but I am not there. I know my eyes are hard, they say I don't fear my father's beatings, I endure them, because I have slipped away, one step removed. I am quiet, I don't plead, I don't weep, I don't cry out. My faint smile says hit me some more, come on, lay it on me. One day I'll be back. To offload. To dish it out.I found my place, looked him in the eye as he cocked his gun. Grinned.He stood like that for a long time, finger on the trigger.Then he shook his head. 'You are a mad man.' He lowered his gun. 'I know where to find you.' He walked away. 'Let's go,' he shouted.I didn't move. Just lay there in no-man's-land.I heard them drag Snake's corpse off somewhere, then their footsteps moved away from us. Car doors slammed. Engines revved, tyres crunched, gravel clipping against the truck, clouds of dust bloomed. I heard them drive off, saw the lights disappear one after the other, until the darkness descended on us like sweet mercy. Flea van Jaarsveld sobbed quietly. One despairing breath tore through Lourens.I looked up at the stars, watched how they brightened gradually.The drone of vehicles died away at last.Then I came back. In my own time. I sat up in the road. Did not see Flea.I stood up. Sore, shaky on my feet. I walked over to where Lourens had knelt. I found them both there in the dark. She had her arms around him, her hand stroked the back of his head, comforting. He just sat.I gathered our things. Everything was inside out, strewn across the road. My Glock tossed aside. I found a torch among the scattered belongings, went looking for the MAG. It was gone.I walked around the Mercedes. Tyres were fine. They had left the cap off the diesel tank. I found it behind the wheel and tried to twist it on. Something was in the way - a long wire, bent double, with a hook on the end. I pulled it out and threw it into the veld.Inspected the cab. Every compartment with a cover was open. More mess. I tidied up, closed everything. Fetched everything that was outside and packed it all away. Lourens and Flea must have nothing to remind them of what had happened.The rhinos were unhappy, they jostled and stamped and fidgeted. I looked at my watch. Twenty to two. Between half past one and two I have to inject them again.I loaded everything that had been outside back into the cab. Went over to Lourens and Flea. They were still sitting like that.'I'll drive,' I said, quietly. 'We have to go. The rhinos must be injected.'Flea got up. She pulled Lourens by the shoulder. He got up. They walked to the passenger door. His head was bowed, in a daze.I got behind the wheel, slammed the door and waited for them. Then I started the engine, struggled with the gears, switched on the lights and pulled slowly away. Concentrated, trying to get the feel of the vehicle, the full extent of its weight. Tried not to blame myself, but unsuccessfully. I should have protected them. I should never have jumped out. I should have jumped out sooner. We should have stopped, called the police. I should have confronted our pursuers, a few hours before, when there were only two or three.I should have protected them.I should have started shooting, created chaos.We were outnumbered. There was only so much I could do, alone.Why had Diederik sent me along?I should have protected them.Thirty kilometres further, Lourens asked in a whisper, 'Do you have the proper licence, Oom?' his voice was without expression.'No.''I'll be all right soon.'At Vaalwater, under the bright lights of a petrol station, she clambered over the cages and injected one rhino, and then the other.Petrol attendants watched us with wary, shifting eyes. There was blood on my face.I let them fill up with diesel, checked over the truck again. Everything seemed right. I went to the restroom. Saw myself in the mirror, looked bad. One eye swollen, a deep cut on the eyebrow. Flecks of Snake's brain on my ear. I washed thoroughly and for a long time.In the cafe I bought four litres of Coke, they needed sugar.Lourens said: 'I will drive.''Soon,' I said and made him drink some cola. 'You can navigate.'At two forty-five, we drove out of town. His voice was emotionless as he gave directions.I wanted to talk to them. I wanted to tell them fear was not a disgrace. I wanted to explain to them how violence and fear stripped you of your dignity, that you mustn't allow that to happen. I wanted to explain trauma to them, the process, the mechanisms to fight it. Like revenge.I couldn't find the words.Eventually Lourens fished out his CDs from a compartment. He chose one and pushed it into the player, turned up the volume. I looked at the cover. Arsis.

"ap 06:00"|"six o'clock"|"They slept, for two hours.I understood the process Lourens was working through. The closeness of death, the shock of a first confrontation with brutality. The inability to understand or accept that people were capable of such violence. That the world really was a place where the most violent ruled. I was eight years old when my father began to beat me. To punish my mother for her unfaithfulness. A child learns more quickly, adapts more easily if he knows no other life. But Lourens was the product of a stable, loving family that had given him self worth and pride, love and respect for others.That had all been snatched away.Seventy kilometres before Rustenburg the sun came up, angled from the left, so that I had to fold down the sun visor. Lourens woke up.'How do you feel?' I asked.'Better, thank you, Oom. Ready to drive.' There was a false note to his enthusiasm.I stopped and got out. Throbbing headache, left eye swollen shut, aching body, but hopefully the worst of the damage was a cracked rib. In front of the truck Lourens put a hand on my arm. 'Oom, there's nothing we could have done.'I looked at him, saw the earnest expression. I merely nodded.As we pulled away, Flea woke up with a start, checked her watch and picked up the map. 'Ventersdorp,' she said. 'At six o'clock I must inject them again.'I made him stop at a garage in Rustenburg so we could use the restrooms. I wanted to see if there was blood in my urine.There was none. Flea emerged from the cafe with two brown paper bags. When we drove out again she took out a packet of painkillers for me, sandwiches, coffee and Coke. She plied Lourens with food and drink. There was a determined air about her, an inner strength."|Trackers|"Deon Meyer"

00:00|midnight|"While Flea was injecting the animals, I inspected the cages. There were no hiding places. The frame and bars were solid steel, the floor was a single layer of wooden planks with no space underneath.I rolled under the truck. There were many options, but Inkunzi's henchmen would have searched diligently. I had the advantage of daylight, but found nothing.What could be so valuable that it warranted the effort of orchestrating a midnight hijacking with five vehicles and twelve men? What would you bring from the north of Zimbabwe, where there was nothing, a land stripped bare?Before we got back in, Flea quizzed me with raised eyebrows. I shook my head, as I had no answers.We drove. She got a conversation going again, as though she considered it her responsibility. I stared at the landscape drifting past, trying to make sense of it all. The key was the transfer on the Swanepoel's farm. Was there someone who was not involved, who didn't help to push or pull to move the cages across?No.Wickus had been shouting orders from the ground, Flea had been standing on the roof of the Mercedes. Swannie on the Bedford, with half the labourers, while Lourens and myself and the remainder of the men had been pulling on the ropes to shift the rhinos centimetre by centimetre.Everyone busy, groaning, sweating, focused. The more clearly I recalled the scene, the more certain I became - there had been no chance to transfer anything else, to hide it, attach it.My cellphone beeped in my pocket. I took it out. An SMS. From Emma. SEE YOU TONIGHT ON D'S FARM. MISSING YOU SO MUCH XXX.Relief flooded over me, too late I realised Flea was also staring at the little screen.She looked at me and her crooked smile said she had gained new insight."|Trackers|"Deon Meyer"

He started to brake.Flea drew a breath to say something.'I'll be quick,' I countered."|Trackers|"Deon Meyer"
"ap 11:16"|"sixteen minutes past eleven"|"Before I went in I made sure. The number plate on the motorbike closest to the door read NV ME.I found them in the little bar, all four on high stools, beer in hand, laughing about something. Hu-hu-hu. I went up to Steel Grey and put my hand on his shoulder.'Are you sober?' I asked.He looked around irritably, then scowled at my swollen eye, the bruises, trying hard to place me.'Who mugged you?' he asked. All four were staring at me now.'Are you sober? I can't bliksem you if you're drunk.''Loxton,' said Ratface. 'Yesterday ...'He could remember. They were sober enough. I pulled Steel Grey by the tassels on his leather jacket, so that he had to get down off his stool. The tassels tore off. 'Hey!' he said and swung at me. An amateur.I dodged the blow. 'You called Emma le Roux a scrawny bitch,' I said.'Leave him alone,' said the Big Guy, coming at me.I hit Steel Grey. There was a lot in that blow. My dilemma at Emma's declaration of love, the stomach-turning flight, hours in the Musina sun, a night of humiliation, pain all over my body, the frustration of unanswered questions.He dropped. Like a stone.I turned to the Big Guy. 'Come on,' I said.At sixteen minutes past eleven I climbed back into the cab of the Mercedes, experiencing a sense of release, a weight unburdened, a brief taste of paradise.'Thank you,' I said.Lourens spotted the blood on my hand and put two and two together. 'Those guys from yesterday?''How did you know?''Nicola told me over the phone yesterday, before lunchtime already He heard about it from Oom Diederik.' No secrets in the Bo-Karoo.I just shook my head.'I thought they were your friends,' said Flea.'I think the friendship is over.'The expression on Lourens's face gradually changed, the laughter crept over him, until he threw back his head, and the hilarity infected Flea, until they were both in gales of laughter. I wanted to smile, even though my sore face protested, because it was then I knew they would get over last night."|Trackers|"Deon Meyer"

'Kinky.''Morning, Antjie.''Diederik Brand said he doesn't have your number, but would you phone him urgently. He sounded a little alarmed.'

06:00|"six this morning"|"Without a word, and with a triumphant gleam in his eye, Diederik handed me something. As large as his thumb, pink, it formed a pocket. It looked like the snipped-off corner of some container. I took it from him. Plastic. Soft, pliable, strong.I felt it, looked at the rhino again, my brain too sluggish to process it all.'It was lying here,' he pointed to where the long grass grew lushly in a spot moistened by the leaking windmill beside the gate.He watched me while I tried to process this.'Wait...' I said, because I couldn't make sense of it. I sniffed the plastic. Nothing.'She's gone,' said Brand.I tried to keep up with him. 'When?''Some time in the night. She had supper with us yesterday. Then Marika showed her to her room and she said ""goodnight"" and shut the door. When I got here at six this morning, the cages were open and the animals were out. I went to call her, but her room was empty. She had used the bath, but not the bed.''Wait, wait, wait...' Gears ground in my head. 'Flea let them out last night?' Last night when the cages were finally on the ground she had explicitly said, 'Leave them like that.' When Diederik asked why, she had answered that the rhinos' sight was poor. 'They will break the fences if they come out at night. Tomorrow morning we can open up. Only after nine. By then they will be accustomed to the smells and sounds.''Cornel,' Diederik said.'That's what I meant.''She must have kept them in the cages so she could get these things off,' said Diederik. 'And I think she hoped they would hide away somewhere this morning, so she could buy more time.''Shit,' I said as I began to understand.'I've just called Ehrlichmann on his satellite phone. He says when they loaded the animals in Zim they were as healthy as they could be. Angry and wild, but no skin disease in sight. She must have stuck the plastic on during the trip. Look carefully, they rolled in the mud beside the trough this morning, look at those dark marks on their skin - everywhere they had those sores. I think the glue is irritating them a bit.''Only along the top,' I said.'What?''The sores. They were only on the upper sides of the rhino. Over the neck and back and quarters. Where she could reach them through the bars from above.'He grinned and nodded. 'You have to admit it's clever.'I looked at the bit of plastic again. 'But what was in them?''God knows. But that's what the hijackers were after.''Has to be.''You owe me an apology, Lemmer.''She was working for you, Diederik ...''No! I don't know her at all. Ehrlichmann got her. He pays her.''And he says he knows nothing about these things?''I told you, he was shocked on the phone.''Did you ask Ehrlichmann if she had anything with her when they loaded in Zim?''No.''How do you know he's not part of this whole thing?''Why would he admit the rhinos were healthy?'Good point. 'I want to talk to him.''It's a satellite phone. Calls cost a fortune. What does it matter? The rhinos are here, safe ... Everyone has been paid. You, Lourens, Nicola ...Yes, we've been tricked by a girl, but where's the real harm? I mean, by next week your bruises will be gone.''It matters to me, Diederik. And to Lourens le Riche. Come ...' I began to move.'You still owe me an apology.''You forged documents that could have done Nicola a lot of damage. Lourens and I might have spent the night in jail.' And, I could have added, I am on parole.He looked at the ground, guilty. Possibly afraid I would tell Nicola about his sins.'Diederik, how did you get hold of the MAG-7?''I... it's a long story.' With a shake of his head that said he wasn't going to say.'Have you paid my boss?'The dimples had disappeared. He nodded sourly. 'Come, let's get this over with.'We walked in silence. The extent of Flea van Jaarsveld's deception slowly settled over me.Just before we went in through the farmhouse door, something else occurred to me: how had she left the farm? 'Diederik, it's sixty kilos to town ...''It's ten kilos just to the next major gravel road, Lemmer. And she was tired, I could see.''Did you hear anything? A car?''You can only hear vehicles once they come through the poort...' he said, pointing to where the road emerged from a cleft in the ridge. Then he said: 'Ay, that Cornel,' and he laughed his dimpled laugh, shaking his head."|Trackers|"Deon Meyer"

I worked with Diederik Brand to get the rhinos here.'The moment of silence again, the signal bouncing through space. 'This is not a secure line.' Rhodesian accent, modulated, slow and patient.'I need to come and see you.''Why?'Because I wanted to look him in the eye, to see if he was lying. 'Diederik didn't tell you?''Tell me what?' he asked, very careful.'The ... our cargo.

"ap 09:45"|"quarter to ten"|"Sleepless. Emma's scent was still on my bed, the house incomplete without her, as if the structure and the spaces sensed her absence. I missed her.I would drive down to Cape Town, stand in front of her and lay my life out before her, so that she could say that she just couldn't deal with it. Then I would live with the consequences. No other choice.But first I would go looking for Flea and Inkunzi. Get my Glock. And answers.I thought of all the unanswered questions, relived the past seventy- two hours, searching for sense, a tangle of interwoven events, knotted threads and wires. I picked at it, tugging at ends here and there, and only pulled the knot tighter.

I missed her.I would drive down to Cape Town, stand in front of her and lay my life out before her, so that she could say that she just couldn't deal with it. Then I would live with the consequences. No other choice.But first I would go looking for Flea and Inkunzi. Get my Glock.

"< 00:00"|"just before midnight"|"Ehrlichmann shook his head. 'I'm not. Back in 1998, Mugabe and Chitepo had one big problem: they didn't have the technical know- how to extract the diamonds. But in Africa, carrion is always guaranteed to attract the scavengers. Enter Mr Sayyid Khalid bin Alawi Macki, a businessman and mining magnate from Oman, with all the technical expertise needed for the job. Within a week, they had created a joint venture between Osleg, the business wing of the Zimbabwean armed forces, the Zim government, and Macki. And our Mr Macki, apparently, is the one with ties to al-Qaeda. Through his many companies, he not only launders money for the terrorists, but also directly supplies, funds, arms, and equips them. So now you will understand how difficult it has become for Chitepo to get rid of the diamonds. Everybody has been watching, including the CIA. All the usual channels are blocked, all the border posts are being monitored. According to the bush telegraph, Chitepo is getting more and more desperate to sell the diamonds, and time is running out. For him, for Mugabe, for Zimbabwe. I mean, who knows where this new coalition government will lead? It's every man for himself now, and even they are watching each other like hawks ... Anyway, that night, during the Big Barbecue, Johnson Chitepo was spending a lot of time with Cornel. As a matter of fact, when I left just before midnight, they were sitting, just the two of them, heads together, very deep in discussion. And I think I know what they were talking about. I mean, she would have been perfect - a South African, white, no obvious ties to smuggling. And using the rhinos ... Well, that's very, very clever.'"|Trackers|"Deon Meyer"

"ap > 00:20"|"after twenty past twelve"|"I had a long wait.Just after twenty past twelve I heard the bedroom door open. He switched on the light and closed the door. I stayed seated, pointing the shotgun at the entrance to the wardrobe.Strips of light shone through the slats. Suddenly the sound of the TV, a soccer channel, the sound just loud enough that I could not hear his movements.Three minutes later, water began to run next door. Sounded like the shower. This was the perfect Kodak moment. I gave him enough time to get the water temperature right and get in. I stood up, picked up the camera, switched it on, choosing the auto mode. Held it in my left hand, the MAG in my right, stepped out, walked across to the door leading to the passage, turned the key to lock it. Then I went into the bathroom.Inkunzi was in the shower, his back to me, busy soaping himself. Broad shoulders, strong arms, good muscle definition. The scars of old knife fights.He was singing softly in Zulu.I raised the camera, let it auto-focus. Aimed the MAG.'Julius!' I called out quietly.His head jerked around. I clicked, the flash catching his indignation.He swore, annoyance turning to rage. I clicked again, pushed the camera in my pocket and held the gun firmly in both hands, lifting it to my shoulder and aiming for his face.'Blast from the past,' I said.'What?' The water was still streaming over him, his face still dumbfounded.'Close the taps.'He took a while to gather his wits, and turn the water off.'Another MAG-7,' I said. 'Not very accurate. But at this distance it will blow your knee away. So we are going to have a quiet little chat, but if I hear anyone outside I will start shooting. Do you understand?'He was uncomfortable in his nakedness, exposed, his red eyes showed he had been drinking. There was still dark bruising on his slightly swollen mouth and nose from our previous encounter.'Sit,' I said.He sank slowly to his knees, keeping his hands high. Sensible. He sat down, instinctively angled so that his private parts were shielded.He looked at me with calm hatred. 'You are a dead man.''That's one of the things we must talk about Julius. No one needs to know about this ... uncomfortable moment between us. Oh, before I forget...' I took out the camera, aimed so that the barrel of the gun and Inkunzi were in the picture and took another photograph.He cursed, colourfully and at length.'If I ever get the idea you are looking for me, or for anyone that I know, I will put these up at the Bull Run, the Sandton police station, I will put them on your X5's windscreen, I will send them to the tabloids and to every rival and accomplice you have, and I will put them on the Internet. And I will tell everyone who wants to know how easy it was to tame the Bull in his own kraal. On the other hand, if you want to keep our chat confidential, you have my complete cooperation.'I let him chew over that, but didn't get a positive response. His face showed only hatred.'Come on, Julius, you have a reputation to uphold. Especially after Flea van Jaarsveld, also known as Cornel, fooled the both of us.'I saw his recognition at the name.'The diamonds were on the lorry,' I said.Surprise. 'You lie.''Remember the sores on the rhinos, those sickly pink growths? Plastic, all along, Inkunzi. The diamonds were inside them. I had to go all the way to Zimbabwe yesterday before I could work it out. But you knew about the cargo. The important thing is, I want you to ask yourself why I went to all this trouble to come here tonight if I already knew about the diamonds. Why would I lie? The truth is, Flea has taken something from me, and I want it back. You want the stones. We can help each other.'He digested this, straightened up a little. 'Give me my bathrobe,' he said, his voice reasonable, pointing at a white garment hanging from a hook against the wall. Negotiation is give and take. I tossed it at him. He draped himself in it. 'How can we help each other?' The change of gear was too rapid. I didn't trust him.'Help me track her down.'He laughed without humour.'Funny?''Impossible.''Nothing is impossible. How did you know about the diamonds?''Let me get dressed first.''That is not going to happen.''Then it will be a long night.''Only if you have lost interest in the diamonds.''I don't negotiate in a shower.'I liked the shower. It reduced his options. But I would have to let him restore some dignity. As long as I kept him away from the gun safe in the walk-in wardrobe. 'Come,' I said, 'but slowly.'He rose, and put the bathrobe on. I walked backwards into the big bedroom. He followed me.'I want a smoke.' He gestured at his bedside cabinet where a pack of Camels and a Zippo lighter lay beside a bunch of keys.I nodded, keeping the MAG trained on him, and moved across to the couch against the window. Inkunzi had closed the curtains behind it. I sat down. He tapped out a cigarette, lit it, sat on the bed.'The ashtray ...' He pointed at the coffee table in front of me, where there was a heavy glass one.'Use the carpet.' I didn't want to give him anything he could throw at me.He blew smoke through his nose. Angry.'How did you know about the diamonds?'He drew deeply on the cigarette, stared at it, seeming deep in thought. 'I hear a lot of stories.''It's a story you must have heard in great detail, because you knew exactly where to find us.''There are Zimbabweans on my team.'My team. The sport of organised crime.'And they heard about Flea and Johnson Chitepo?'He gave me a look, impressed. 'You know a lot.''Not enough.'He rested his elbows on his knees, bent over away from me, as if he were thinking. Drew on his cigarette, blew the smoke out in a long slow stream. 'We heard about a deal. Chitepo and some others. The first story was it was coming through the Kruger Park. Then, a day before the time, we heard it was one Cornel van Jaarsveld behind the plan, and they were coming across the border near Musina. In a Bedford truck. Later that night, they said no, it's a Mercedes.''How did they know?''The man who Cornel hired to drive the Bedford. But first he had to get away from you before ...'The driver of the Bedford, the man in the yellow vest, muscular arms, cigarette in his mouth. I put two and two together. 'She made him wait in Kwekwe so she could stick the diamonds on the rhinos first. That's why you didn't know.'Inkunzi just nodded.'And you heard nothing else? Who were the people Chitepo made his deal with?''I don't know.' But he was lying. I let it go for now.'And then you just let us go, without encouraging Flea to tell you where the diamonds were? It doesn't make sense to me.'He shrugged.'Come on, Julius. Why didn't you shoot me? Why didn't you torture Flea just a little? You're not the kind of guy who has a problem with violence.'He had finished the cigarette. He looked around for a place to dispose of the stub. He wasn't keen to answer my question, which confirmed my suspicions.'You knew who the final buyer was, Julius. You knew where she was going. And the only reason you were prepared to let us go was so you could put Plan B into action. But Plan B was not as profitable or as easy as Plan A ...''I want to put this down,' he waved the stub at the bedside cabinet.'Slowly.'He stretched out an arm, put the stub down carefully beside the bunch of keys so that it stood upright, the glowing end upwards. Then he pressed a finger on something in the bunch of keys and the alarm began to wail in the roof above us and he looked at me and said, 'You're fuckin' dead.'He threw the keys at me and jumped up, moving towards the wardrobe.I ignored his projectile, pulled the trigger.Nothing happened."|Trackers|"Deon Meyer"

My man is the relief driver, he says they have to take the back roads, they have to keep away from the roadblocks, so it will take all day to get to the border. They can't be there before five o'clock at the earliest.JS: And they are coming through the Musina border? Beit Bridge?(Unknown): No, Inkunzi, they are smuggling, they won't go through the border post. My man says, some illegal crossing, somewhere between Beit Bridge and the Botswana border, we think Mapungubwe National Park, it is the obvious place.JS: You think? You fucking think?(Unknown): Please, Inkunzi, this Colonel did not tell my man where. But there are not many roads for a big truck on your side. Look at the maps.JS: You sure it's a Bedford?(Unknown): Dead sure, Inkunzi. 26 September 2009. Saturday.Once everyone had taken their place in the Ops Room, Masilo said: 'Listen to me very carefully We have only one goal - to intercept the diamonds. And we have only one chance. The operators in the field are totally dependent on us. They cannot intercept Julius Shabangu and his troops unless we tell them exactly where to go. So I want absolute professionalism, absolute focus. If you get tired, if you lose concentration, come and tell me and we will bring in a relief. There is a great deal riding on this. A great deal.'Then they set to work. The audio feed was relayed so they could listen to Julius Inkunzi's cellphone when he used it, so they could keep in contact with the seven teams of PIA operators - a team for each possible route in the Musina area, and an extra team as backup.They listened to Shabangu directing his people and their vehicles like a general.'He has ten vehicles,' said an audio surveillance operator.'He wants the diamonds real bad,' said Rajkumar.At twelve-thirty p.m., after a one-sided telephone conversation, Quinn reported: 'There is no South African who goes by the rank and surname of a Colonel van Jaarsveld who has entered Zim in the past six months. We have twelve van Jaarsvelds crossing the border, nine men, three women.'Advocate Tau Masilo murmured something inaudible, took a deep breath and said: 'Bring me the original sound file.'"|Trackers|"Deon Meyer"

At a quarter to one he took the headset off and asked: 'I want the details of all the van Jaarsvelds with names starting with a ""C"" or a ""K"".''I'll print it,' said Quinn.Everyone in the room looked at Masilo expectantly.'Might not be a rank, might be a name, badly pronounced,' he said.'Aah,' said Rajkumar."|Trackers|"Deon Meyer"

He held the receiver out to Masilo.'Theunie ...? We have a woman with the name of Cornelia Johanna. Is it possible that she would be called Cornel? Or something?' Masilo listened a while, said, 'Thank you,' and put down the phone. 'Cornelia Johanna van Jaarsveld. Her ID number is on the list. Get a home address, get people there. I want to know everything there is to know.'"|Trackers|"Deon Meyer"
"ap 03:10"|"ten past three"|"The day was a slow poison, gradually paralysing everyone. Tension, boredom, frustration. At ten past three, a little excitement.Over the loudspeaker, Shabangu's voice as he answered his cellphone: 'Stop fucking calling me.''Ouboet, I am just as tired as you are. Let's get this thing behind us ...''Fuck you,' said Shabangu, and ended the call.The operator who had sent Quinn the original sound files, looked up and grinned. 'Becker,' he whispered.Quinn nodded.'Who?' Rajkumar and Masilo asked in unison.Before they could answer, there was another call. Becker again. 'Ouboet, I'm not going to stop calling until this thing ...'Shabangu: 'Where did you get this fucking number?''One of your men gave it to me.''Which one?''He says his name is Kenosi.'Shabangu cursed over the ether in Zulu, a stream of words that cracked like a whip. Then: 'I'm going to come and get you.'' Ouboet, bring the money when you come.''Fuck you, Boer.'' Ouboet, should I rather come to your house? Kenosi told me where you ...'The call was abruptly cut off by Shabangu.The surveillance operator laughed. 'Guy's got nerve.''What the hell was that all about?' asked Masilo.'Who is this guy?' Raj asked again.Shabangu's voice interrupted them again: Becker was calling a third time. 'Fuck off, just fuck off, I will not answer again.'End of call.'You know about this man?' asked Masilo.They filled him in, briefly, about the white man who wanted his money back, apparently after a car hijacking.'Why must I only hear about this now?'Before anyone could explain, an operator said: 'Guys, we have a problem.'Everyone looked at him.'Shabangu has just sent an SMS. It reads: ""Cellphone now off. Call Thato.'""''Shit,' said Rajkumar. 'Shit, shit, shit.''That's it. He's off-line.''What are the implications?' asked Masilo.'Big,' said Rajkumar. 'Bad. He's been our primary, the number we've been tracking.''Can we intercept the other numbers, the recipients of the SMS?'Rajkumar jumped up, waddled over to the door. 'We need more equipment in that area. It's going to take hours. I'll get on it.'Tau Masilo slowly lowered his head into his hands. 'Beckett? Is that his name? Will no one rid me of this turbulent priest?''No,' said Quinn. 'Becker. His name is Lukas Becker.'"|Trackers|"Deon Meyer"

Not one of the PIA's seven teams on the Zimbabwe and Botswana borders had seen a Bedford truck.Masilo did not hide his disappointment. In them, in everything.Suddenly in a clear, optimistic tone an operator said: 'Shabangu is back on-line.''Thank God,' said Rajkumar and took another bite of his hamburger.'Amen,' said Quinn, quietly.'SMSs coming in.''Read them to us.''The first says, ""Mercedes 1528"".'Quinn Googled the message. 'Second SMS is just numbers.' 'Read them!''S23 54.793 E28 27.243.''Jesus,' said Masilo, and looked at Quinn: 'GPS coordinates.' 'Mercedes 1528 is a truck ...' Quinn added. 'Shit,' said Rajkumar, putting his hamburger aside hurriedly, his fingers dancing across the keyboard to pinpoint the coordinates. 'The coordinates are way south of the border ... way south, shit, T-junction where the R518 and the D579 join.''Then let's get people down there. Now.'

It is dated the fourteenth of October. If I can't prevent the terrorist attack, I will leave. If I am successful, it will be up to you to decide whether you accept this or not.'Mentz stared at him, her expression impenetrable.'We can't trace Willem de la Cruz or Terrence Richard Baadjies.' Masilo's monotone betrayed his weariness, his resignation. 'We suspect they have gone somewhere to receive the consignment of diamonds. We also suspect that de la Cruz is only waiting to complete the trade with the Supreme Committee before he flees to South America. Consequently, we are monitoring all international flights from Cape Town and Oliver Tambo Airport. We have liaised with traffic authorities in the Western Cape; they will hold every Mercedes 1528 truck that stops at a weighbridge on the way to Cape Town, until one of our agents has searched it. We have intensified the surveillance and tracking of Suleiman Dolly, Shaheed Latif Osman, Ebrahim Laattoe and Baboo Rayan. The reaction unit is ready if there is any contact between the Supreme Committee and the Restless Ravens. The operation to gain access to the computer system of Consolidated Fisheries will take place on Monday just after midnight.'Still Mentz sat there, sphinx-like.'Currently, we are investigating the feasibility of a plan to insert an electro-acoustic microphone in the cellar of 15 Chamberlain Street. The only way is to keep Baboo Rayan away from the house for at least an hour, possibly by a sham robbery of the cafe he visits every morning. It will have to be done with great circumspection as we don't know what security measures are in place inside the Committee's house. Finally: we will maintain the surveillance of Julius Shabangu until the thirteenth of October.'Then he turned and walked out."|Trackers|"Deon Meyer"

They went in through the gate and walked purposefully up to the front door.One technician began unrolling the telephone cord while he examined the wall of the house speculatively as though he intended to install something there. The other crouched down at the front door, his back to the street so that passers-by could not see what he was doing. He opened the toolbox and took out the fibre optic scope. It was a long, thin tube, called a snake cam at the PIA. He slowly pushed the end of the fibre optic scope under the front door, his eyes on the colour screen in the box.Then he moved the point of the scope back and forth to see as much of the interior as possible."|Trackers|"Deon Meyer"

And Mr Soderstrom, her instructor, had the insight not to say anything before the end, didn't make her do school steps, didn't give her pause to breath, or think.Only once the hour was over, did he say: 'Miss Strachan, that was magnificent.'Milla, with the bloom of exertion and pleasure on her cheeks, suddenly realised what she had achieved. 'It was,' she said. Emotion welled up in her, euphoria. 'Thank you,' she added, 'do I say that enough?'She took off her dance shoes, said goodbye, picked up her handbag and walked out with an energetic bounce, the bag swinging gaily, down the steps, through the banking corridor, out, the evening quiet and lovely. She walked across the access road to her Renault.Someone called her name.She turned her head, her heart still light and full.Lukas Becker walked across the tarmac towards her.A laugh seemed to bubble up inside Milla, the knowledge that this meeting was meant to be and that it was good and right, and she said, 'Hello,' and waited.'I was just on my way to Woollies, and I saw you go in ...'She just stood there smiling.'So I decided to ambush you, in the hope that you would come out thirsty, tired and vulnerable,' with enough caution and courage in his tone.'You waited a whole hour for me?''Actually only the last ten minutes.

But with all due respect, Janina, we are going to need more than that.''Such as?''The nature and scale of the threat. Especially concerning the international implications.''Unfortunately, we are not in a position to give you much more at this time. But if you can help us find the vessel, and we unearth any intelligence the CIA might be interested in, I give you my word that we will pass it along.''Janina, that's not going to cut it.''That is a real pity. I would have thought it the ideal opportunity for the CIA to ... regain our trust.''I'm not following you.''I'm sure you do, but it's not all that important right now. May I ask you to take the request, as it stands, to Langley?''Are there trust issues I'm not aware of, Janina?''I honestly don't know what you are aware of, Bruno.

'Does it really matter? Now the CIA knows we know about him?''Probably not. What bothers me, is why he was still so eager to shake off our tails.''The Americans have their own agenda.''Which I cannot fathom. I went through all the transcripts and reports again and, in my mind, there is only one scenario that fits.''And that is?'The Advocate referred to his notes. 'Their records show that Becker flew from Baghdad to London on 12 September, and the same evening to Johannesburg, where he landed on the morning of 13 September. The SAPS file says his hired car was hijacked just before nine o'clock that same morning in Sandton. He phoned Bull Shabangu for the first time on 18 September, and asked for his money. That was the only subject of all their conversations. And we have a recording from 6 October, when Osman told Suleiman Dolly in Chamberlain Street that ""Shabangu told him I've got his money. Tweetybird or me."" Now, let's assume the hijacking was genuine. And let us examine the manner of his contact with Shabangu and Osman. There is only one conclusion we can draw. There was something in that hijacked car. Something that Becker and the CIA want back very badly. And it's not money.'Mentz nodded, slowly.A knock on Masilo's door.'Come in ...'Quinn opened it and put his head through. He saw Mentz. 'Morning, ma'am.''Morning, Quinn.''Shall I come back later?''No,' Masilo said. 'Any news?''It's Miss Jenny. She is opening a bunch of reports and documents on the system.''Which ones?''Shabangu, the Supreme Committee, PAGAD, Tweetybird, organised crime. She seems to be following a trail.'Mentz was the first to respond. 'That's good news,' she said. 'She's doing it for him. For Becker. That means he will contact her again.'"|Trackers|"Deon Meyer"

Janina, I have a report from Langley, and I'm happy to say we are making progress. Let me briefly attempt to explain what they've tried to do. Step one was to make absolutely sure The Madeleine is not running LRIT and AIS, and I can confirm that it definitely isn't. The last record of a signal from this ship was received on 22 September at 23.30, from waypoint S13 34.973 W5 48.366, which is about one thousand five hundred miles west-northwest of Walvis Bay, in the Atlantic Ocean. Then it just stopped transmitting.Went off the radar completely. We've checked with the SOLAS authorities, and they say they duly notified the owners of the vessel, but got no response ...''It's a dummy corporation. All the registration details are bogus.''So we gathered. Step two was to plot all LRIT-silent vessels of the right size against possible matches for satellite imagery, and we identified sixteen potential candidates, of which fourteen have already been vetted through hi-res visual material - we've found some pretty interesting specimens, some smugglers in the Andaman and South China Sea, one ship being held by Somali pirates, but the majority are experiencing equipment problems, and are all accounted for. The last two are a bit of a problem. Adverse weather conditions, bad visibility from space ...''Where are they?''North Atlantic, I'll have to check. Grand Banks, something like that. The weather should clear within the next twelve hours, and we'll be ready.''Bruno, I can't thank you enough.'"|Trackers|"Deon Meyer"

It meant either that they weren't there, or a bit further behind, and that was all she needed.

Mrs Killian, thank you for phoning. Just ask them to tidy up everything, please.''I will pass the message on. They want you to sign for delivery.

It must be here.''Wait,' said Milla and walked down the steps to the wooden deck, where two men with beers in their hands stood at the gangway of a yacht. She heard them speaking English. 'Could you tell me where we can find the Oceana Power Boat Club?'
'You've got it wrong,' said Bruno Burzynski. 'They are not after our soccer team. It's a coincidence of dates. Our intelligence indicates something entirely different.''And what would that be?'For the first time Burzynski looked uncomfortable. 'I'm sorry, but I'm not at liberty to share that with you.'Mentz made a sound of scornful disgust.'So we can call off Tuesday's security measures?' asked Masilo. 'You don't want your soccer team protected?''Go ahead.'Masilo shook his head in bewilderment.Mentz broke the silence. 'Let me try and figure this out. You were very keen to talk to us when you thought we had Osman,' she said.Burzynski did not react.'And the only thing you really want now, is the new electronic identity of The Madeleine. Which means you don't need us once you've found the ship.'Burzynski stared at the table. Mentz walked towards them slowly, with growing certainty in her voice. 'You've got a boarding team standing by, haven't you? What are they, Bruno? Navy Seals? Did you bring in your own little fast boats, or did you buy them here? Chartered a few choppers? Because you're planning on taking the ship. And telling us about it afterwards.''That's absurd.''No, it's not,' said Janina Mentz, and sat down at the table. 'And that begs the question: what is on that ship that is so valuable that you would risk a huge diplomatic row, that you would sacrifice your relationship with us and with our government?''You've got it wrong,' he said, but she heard the faint traces of discomfort in his voice.'I've got it right. At last.' Janina reached for the telephone, drew it closer and called a number. Burzynski followed her movements with his eyes. 'Raj,' she said into the instrument, 'we've just given the new AIS identity to the CIA. How long would it take them to find The Madeleine?'She listened, then said, 'I see. You have four hours to decode the hard drive. Can you do it? ... Good.'Mentz slammed the phone down and smiled at Burzynski.'Hard drive?' asked Burzynski.' What hard drive?''What's the cargo on The Madeleine?' Janina Mentz shot back."|Trackers|"Deon Meyer"

'There are too many people here.'At 21.38 they were standing in front of the Radisson Hotel, looking out over Granger Bay harbour, brightly lit. There were peopleeverywhere: on the balconies of restaurants, on the walkways of the long, narrow quays, on the decks of the yachts that lay in long rows, masts and tackle in line.'Is this the right place?' Milla asked.He looked at the cellphone again. 'According to the GPS coordinates. It's here. Definitely.''They'll only be here at two. That's another four hours ...'Becker pointed at a party on the deck of a yacht. 'Those people will still be here at two o'clock... I should have written the coordinates down.''OPBC,' said Milla. 'Is that a navigational term?'He shook his head. 'I don't know. Let me Google it.'She watched him connect via his cellphone, and search.The very first result was 'Oceana Power Boat Club'. He activated the link. A website opened, a small photo of the sea in the foreground, cranes and the buildings of Sea Point in the background.

The CIA man walked up and down the opposite wall, restlessly, holding his cellphone to his ear. He kept repeating, 'Uh-huh', with varying pauses, his face betraying nothing.He rang off, turned back to the table and sat down. His elbows on the table, his hands open in a gesture of conciliation. 'You have to talk to her, Tau.''She won't budge, Bruno. Not unless you tell her what the cargo is.'For the first time the tension showed on Burzynski's face. He made a gesture of frustration and helplessness: 'I can't, it's not my decision, and this thing is so fucking politicised, so fucking invested . . .''That's not going to cut it.'Burzynski regained control, his body still. He leaned back in his chair, visibly tired. 'I know.' Extract: A Theory of Chaos, Coronet, 2010, p. 317The last half-hour before they came was the most difficult.The ache in my body from lying too long on the invisible, unknowable discomforts of the grass tufts and stones, the nagging, gnawing uncertainty, the doors opening in my head, unlocked by Markus's half confession, so that I thought of my own sins, submerged for so long.On a grassy bank opposite a small-boat harbour, in the middle of the night, I remembered Cassie.Casper. Eighteen years ago. Ten months before I met Frans. A year before I fell pregnant. Casper, the music student, the cellist, taking the same extra class as me. Cassie the vulnerable, Cassie the ugly, Cassie of the crooked teeth and small protruding ears, who made advances like a whipped dog. Cassie the annoying, with his nervous chat without context, his abrupt silences, yet I didn't have the courage to drive him away. It made me feel good, there was something sacrificial, something noble and altruistic in allowing Cassie his conversations, the development of the appearance of a friendship.Cassie, who wanted more and more, who phoned, who followed me around, who asked for me at the hostel reception, until it all became too much, saturation point, the night of craziness. I stormed down the stairs, grabbed him by the hand, marched him off to his little flat. I closed the door behind us, and standing there in front of him, I took off all my clothes. Bare in front of him, naked, on display. I watched Cassie, his eyes flickering from my breasts to my pubis, the slackness of his mouth, his disbelief, his gratitude, his sudden lust, his transformation from lapdog to guard dog. Like my mother, I had given expression to an impulse, a compulsion, a liberation, and like her, I found pleasure in it. It was a moment of light and darkness. And truth.I would not let him touch me."|Trackers|"Deon Meyer"

One had a cellphone to his ear.Milla tracked his every move.At one o'clock the second wave arrived. A panel van stopped in front of the gate. The passenger door opened, a man got out, disappeared in front of the vehicle. Appeared again as he opened the gates, first the right, then the left. He remained standing as the panel van drove in, waited until the dark blue bakkie reappeared, then he also passed through the gateway. He closed them again, but did not lock them.The rear door of the panel van opened. Six, seven, eight men climbed out, each holding a weapon.

He remained standing as the panel van drove in, waited until the dark blue bakkie reappeared, then he also passed through the gateway. He closed them again, but did not lock them.The rear door of the panel van opened. Six, seven, eight men climbed out, each holding a weapon. She recognised the shape: AK-47s like the one that lay in front of her.A big man stood and pointed, gave orders, the others walked to the bakkie, offloaded some equipment, cylindrical, big and bulky.They moved purposefully, everyone seemed to know what to do.

He experienced a measure of tension within himself. For the first time in his career someone had to pay directly for his services. And it was six, seven years since he'd last done investigative work himself, in the front line. 'It's like riding a bicycle,' Jack Fischer had said two months ago during the recruitment interview, 'you just get back on again.'He hoped it was true.Tanya Flint appeared in the doorway. 'May I come in?''Of course,' he said, standing up, waiting for her to sit down. He saw her look around, take in her surroundings. The room was still bare, the dark wood wall units empty. The only personal items were the leather folder for his notepad, his briefcase with two sandwiches in it, and the framed photo on the desk.'It's my first day,' he said, by way of explanation.'Oh. Then I'm lucky.'He wasn't sure what she meant.She pointed at the photo. 'Your family?''My wife and my ... stepchildren.' He'd never liked the word.'She's very pretty.''I think so too.'An uncomfortable silence. He flipped open the leather folder in front of him. Inside it was a pen and an A4 writing pad. At the top of each page, in silver letters, stood Jack Fischer and Associates, pale, like a watermark. He slid the pen from its loop and clicked the nib out, at the ready.She unclasped her handbag, on her lap, and took out a photo and a notebook. She handed him the photo. Postcard size, in full colour, of a man in his thirties. The sandy hair trimmed in a short brush cut, braai tongs in one hand, bare chested, outside, laughing. An open, boyish face.

Not love at first sight, but there was a connection, a natural ease with each other. She liked his sense of humour, the way he laughed, his respectfulness towards her, from the beginning. 'He was so considerate.' And, with a small longing laugh: 'His shirt was always hanging out, even though he tucked it in a hundred times a day.'

12:00|Noon|"The Atlantic Bus Company's Woodstock depot was in Bromwell Street, opposite the industrial area, next to the Metro railway line. Joubert had to stop at the gate and sign in with the security guard before he could drive in. The low office building was in the middle of the big, fenced area. Row upon row of blue buses, a workshop and giant fuel tanks behind them. A train rumbled towards Muizenberg as Joubert got out. Heat rose from the tar, the smell of diesel and oil heavy in the air.There was no reception. He walked all the way to the end of the corridor before he found an office with Neville Philander, Depot Manager on the door. He knocked.'Come in,' a voice called out.Joubert opened the door. Philander held a hand over a telephone mouthpiece and said: 'I'll be with you in a minute,' and then, into the receiver: 'Recovery are on their way, Jimmy, just hang in there ... No, I've got people here, I have to go. OK, bye ...' He put the phone down, stood up, offered his hand and said: 'You're the private eye?'He would have to get used to this. He walked into the air-conditioned office and shook the tall coloured man's hand. 'I am. Mat Joubert.''Neville Philander. Please sit, it's all a bit crazy here at the moment...'The telephone rang again. Philander stood up, walked to the door, shouted down the corridor: 'Santasha, hold the calls, I've got someone here.''OK, lovey,' a woman's voice called back. Philander sat down again. 'Madhouse, I tell you. Where were we? You probably want to know about Danie ...''If you can tell me.''HQ says it's OK. Tanya put in an official request.''I don't want to waste your time. Just two things really: did Danie Flint have any trouble at work, and did he, in the month before his disappearance, behave strangely in any way, any differently?''There's always trouble here at work. Are you ex SAPS?''I am.''Thought so. You've got that look. Ja, well, Danie was area manager, there's usually four of them, it's a tough job ...'The phone on his desk began to ring again. 'Jesus,' he said, jumping up, and shouting down the corridor again: 'Santasha, please!''Sorry, Neville, my mistake, lovey ...'He came back to his chair. 'Look here, the area manager's job is to manage his drivers, and his routes. Danie was Atlantic North, so everything from here to Atlantis, including Milnerton, Montague Gardens, Killarney, Du Noon, Richwood, Table View, Blouberg, Melkbos, not your biggest area, but with all the work on the N1 and the interchanges, it's also a fuck-up, I'm telling you. Anyway, the main problem is the drivers, because one half cause trouble and the other half complain, and your area manager fires at least three or four every month, so if you come ask me if he had conflict at work, then I'm gonna tell you ""for sure"", there's conflict here, but Danie could handle it. He was good with people, he's a communicator, he had respect, he never played whitey or threw his weight around, if you know what I mean. Between you and me, he was the most popular of the four, so I don't think ...'The telephone rang again. Philander looked at it, then at the open door. It stopped.'Sorry, Neville, sorry, lovey ...''Jirre,' said Philander, 'I'm telling you, ABC stands for Asylum By the Cape, you gotta be crazy to work here. I'm one man short and management doesn't want to take on any more, in case Danie pops out of the woodwork, you know? What else can I tell you?''His wife said there was a strike here last year.''Ja, that's another story, went on for two weeks, company-wide ...''About pay?''No. Our Driver Risk Management Programme. But Danie was on the sidelines, it was managed by Mr Eckhardt and those guys.''Mr Eckhardt?''Mr Francois Eckhardt, Chief Operations Officer. Anyway, the strike was bad for us, but there wasn't any conflict here, we just sat and waited every day.''Danie's behaviour before he vanished? Did you spot anything ... abnormal?''You tell me what's normal, there's no such thing here, you see for yourself how it is. Anyway, it's hard to say. The area managers are on the road most of the time, especially in the morning and the afternoon, checking out the routes, the rest of the time it's admin in their offices, there's no time to socialise, so I wouldn't have noticed really.

Put it through.' Then to Joubert. 'This normally means trouble, you'll have to excuse me.'Joubert stood up. 'His marriage?'The phone began to ring. 'How would I know?' and he shook Joubert's hand.'Neville, are you going to pick up or what?''Jirrel said Neville. He put his hand on the phone.'Off the record?'Joubert nodded.'She's a bit of a nissen, that Tanya ...''Neville!'Before Joubert could ask what a 'nissen' was, Philander picked up the phone."|Trackers|"Deon Meyer"

"ap 04:30"|"half past four"|"He drove back to Virgin Active, because it was on his way home to Milnerton. There was no sense in going back to the city in the rush- hour traffic. And it was half past four - he wanted to get the feel of how busy the place was in the late afternoon, at the time Flint disappeared.There were a great deal fewer parking spaces. He found one and stopped, sat a while watching. Then he opened Tanya's file with the contact numbers and went through the list of people. One name caught his eye: Inspector Keyter, SAPS, Tableview. In her thorough way, Tanya Flint had written down the case number beside it.Could it be Jamie, the detective constable who had joined the Serious and Violent Crimes Unit before that was also disbanded? Most likely, since if he recalled correctly Keyter had been promoted from Table View. And Tanya Flint had talked about a detective who fiddled with his fringe.He took the file along with him, got out, locked the Honda and walked to the police station. The south-easter was well under way, blowing up his jacket flaps and forcing him to hold the folder tightly to his chest.Table View had never been one of his favourite police stations. He and Margaret had lived nearby in Frere Street after they were married, before she began buying up old houses and renovating them. From time to time he had to pick up faxes or forms at the police station, or go in for computer access. Even then there were already too many cowboys, too much attitude.The charge office was hot, and fairly busy. He waited his turn, asked if Jamie Keyter was available. Not Jay-mie, if he remembered correctly, but Jaa-mie. The black constable said he would go and check. A little while later he came back and said: 'The inspector is coming.'Joubert waited to one side, out of the way. He wished he could loosen his tie, that he'd left his jacket in the car. For five minutes he stood and listened, at the border post where two worlds met, the public and the police. Every police station had its own rhythms, its ownatmosphere and sounds. The complainants' voices, some angry, others defeated. Out of an office somewhere came the loud words of an argument. Telephones ringing, the patient footsteps of the three uniforms manning the counter, generally soothing and reassuring, bending over to help fill in statements, probably on their feet for six hours, their movements slow, going through the routine motions.Then Keyter arrived with a scowl on his face for whoever had come to bother him, until he saw Joubert. His body language changed in an instant. 'Sup?' he said, like a man with a guilty conscience.'Jamie,' said Joubert and put out his hand. 'I'm not with the Service any more.'Keyter shook his hand, taken aback. 'Sup?' he said, the information too unexpected to process. Joubert could see that he hadn't changed much. Still wearing tight golf shirts, sleeves stretched over bulging biceps. Today's was black with the silver Nike logo on the chest, to go with black jeans and black Nike trainers.'Friday was my last day. I'm with Jack Fischer and Associates now.''Oh. Oka-a-ay,' Something in his tone that made Joubert's hackles rise.'I'm working on a fifty-five. One Danie Flint who disappeared last year. His wife said it was your case.''Danie Flint?' He scratched his head.'Last year, late November. His car was abandoned here at Virgin Active.'A light went on. 'Oh, right. That one.' He looked at Joubert expectantly.'I just wanted to ask you if you had any insights to share, Jamie.''Insights, Sup?''I'm not a Sup any more, Jamie.''OK... I'll have to get the dockets, but if I remember correctly ... There was nothing. The guy was just gone.'Joubert suppressed a sigh. 'Yes, apparently that was the original problem. Did you speak to anyone at his work?''I... No, I mean, the guy ... There wasn't... Sup, you know how things are, the guys go fishing with their pals, they don't tell the old lady ... I mean, his car was here ...'Joubert nodded, put his hand in the inside pocket of his jacket. Keyter'S eyes followed the movement with wary eyes. Joubert took outhis wallet, extracted a business card and gave it to the detective. 'If you remember something, or find something, Jamie . . .''OK, Sup, I'll call you right away.''I'm not Sup any more ...'"|Trackers|"Deon Meyer"
"ap > 06:00"|"after six"|"He sat in the Honda and watched his theory being systematically confirmed.The parking lot filled up, people walked to the gym with sports bags, or to the library, with books in their arms. There were short periods when it was quiet, two or three minutes where something could have happened to Danie Flint if the attacker was very confident and efficient. But a struggle here, a fight that went unnoticed, seemed increasingly improbable.He sat there till after six, and thought of Jamie Keyter and the Flint dossier. He knew the way things were with detectives at stations, even the lazy ones like Keyter - too many cases, too little time, so there was always something that fell through the cracks. Tanya was right, missing adults were not always a priority, unless there was obvious proof of a crime. Otherwise they fell in the category of domestic conflict, he had dealt with countless numbers as a uniformed policeman. Thirty years ago.Lord, how time flies.He drove to Milnerton, to Tulbach Street where he and Margaret had been living for the last six months, their fifth house in five years, but he didn't mind, because she took so much pleasure in her 'projects'. She would go looking for a real bargain, a solid house in a good neighbourhood that had fallen into disrepair, 'worst house in a good neighbourhood' was her motto. Then she renovated it with her keen insight and good taste, smartened it up, and when she was done, they would move in. A house sold more easily if there were people living in it, activity, aromas from the kitchen, tasteful furniture in the rooms. When she was expecting potential buyers, she would put vanilla in the oven, or bake a cake, and put on some cheerful music at a low volume, make sure the house was cool in summer, or warm in winter, with a fire in the grate. She was already in the process of buying the next one, in 'lower Constantia, she could get it for next to nothing in this slow market."|Trackers|"Deon Meyer"

"ap 01:05"|"One five"|"As he recorded his kilometres on the computer system, he thought how it wasn't a game to Tanya Flint. He'd seen her financial position. This extreme focus on money made him uncomfortable. He would have to sit down with Jack and tell him how he felt. But first he must attend to his responsibilities.He phoned Tanya. She sounded tired. 'I talked to Mr Eckhardt, he said you can go through Danie's office any time, they'll do everything they can to help, we have full access. You must just arrange it with Neville.'Joubert thanked her, then told her of his plan to test the Audi for fingerprints.'How much will it cost?''I'll find out and get back to you.''Do you think it's necessary? Shouldn't we wait for the cellphone's plot?''That might be a good idea.'After he had rung off, he phoned Jannie Cordier, the forensic technician, explaining who he was and what he wanted.'I'm full today, but I can fit you in this evening.' A high, excitable voice.'What will it cost?' Joubert asked.'Do you want the car done inside and out?''Please.''One five, plus 600 for every set of prints you want identified.''I'll let you know.'Then he made an appointment for 12.00 with Neville Philander at the Atlantic Bus Company depot, reached for the list of phone numbers that Tanya Flint had compiled, and began phoning her husband's friends. He asked the same questions, over and over: did Danie behave strangely in the weeks before he disappeared? Did he mention any problems, in his work, his marriage? Did he have enemies? Was he involved in any arguments or fights? Did he have any reason to disappear? And the answers, offered enthusiastically and helpfully, were consistent. Danie was 'a lovely person'. Danie was happy, cheerful, always the same. Loyal, everyone's friend. Danie was a 'party animal', 'the life of the party', he lived for his wife and his work and to party, party, party.When he had dealt with the last call, he leaned back in his chair and pondered the phenomenon of the sanctification of the victim. It was a common syndrome, driven by the guilt of surviving, and the universal never-speak-ill-of-the-dead piety that so bedevilled a policeman's work, as it papered over all the cracks. And there always were cracks.At eleven he phoned Mrs Gusti Flint, Danie's mother, to ask whether he could talk to her. 'You are very welcome,' she said. 'I'm here all day,' and she gave him an address in Panorama."|Trackers|"Deon Meyer"
"ap ~ 06:00"|"About six o'clock"|"Mat Joubert sat in front of Danie Flint's computer with his head in his hands, and considered doing things his way. He knew it had implications. He knew it went against the grain, against his better judgement. Three decades of experience had taught him it was wiser to work according to the rules, because doing otherwise always came back to bite you.What he should do was go to Jack Fischer and say no, he didn't agree with this policy of milking clients. Honest and straight, that was the only way he knew.But he also knew he wasn't the fastest detective in the world, he was slow and methodical, worrying too much about detail. What would he say if Jack said, 'Then you must work faster'? He couldn't deny his weaknesses.Then he remembered Jack Fischer saying he must pressure Dave Fiedler, the cellphone plotter, for a discount. That implied at least the right to control costs, and he took out Bella van Breda's business card, the young woman with the glasses and the blush. Bennie Griessel's neighbour. He called her, first had to explain who he was before he could describe his problem.'I can try,' she said.'The problem is, my client's budget...What will it cost?''That depends. If you wait until I've finished this afternoon, I won't charge anything.''No, no, you can't do it for free ...''Let's see if I can find anything first...''What time do you finish?''About six o'clock.''Can I pick you up?''Please.'He wrote down her work address, rang off and walked to NevillePhilander to ask if he could come back in the late afternoon."|Trackers|"Deon Meyer"

Irascible, impatient.'Can we talk?'De Waal moved so that he could see. He recognised Mat Joubert, shut his eyes, shook his head and sighed. 'No, oh, Jissis.''Social visit,' said Joubert.'Like hell,' said de Waal, scrabbling around on the seat till his fingers closed around a small pair of pliers and he disappeared behind the instrument panel again. Joubert guessed the boss of Decible Demons must be installing a radio or taking one out. On the window fronting Voortrekker Street was the promise: Mad About Car Audio, Crazy Prices, Insane Sound. That must be Mrs de Waal's clever marketing. Vaatjie's talents lay elsewhere.'I don't know anything.''I want your skill, not your information.''What for?''I have a drawer that needs opening.''Get Kallie van fucking Deventer.''I'm not in the Service any more, Vaatjie.'That stopped him. He dived out from under the panel, extricated himself from the interior with surprising speed and stood up. He was half Joubert's height, but broader. His head was as round as a ball, the frown just a single crease in the high forehead. 'Why?' he asked, and wiped his hands on his overalls.'Retired.''But why?' Hands at his sides, just as much a cartoon character as he had been when Joubert knew him at high school.'It was time to go.''And now?''Now I'm in the private sector.'The eyes flicked from Joubert to the reception desk where Vaatjie's wife was sitting out of earshot behind a computer.'I'm not in that line any more.' Meaning housebreaking, his first career.'But you still know how to work a lock. And I don't see customers lining up outside here.''Times are tough, friends are few.''Two hundred rand for five minutes' work.''You're fucking crazy. I don't work for peanuts.''What's your price, Vaatjie?''Five hundred.''It was good seeing you again,' Joubert said, and turned to go. 'At that price I can get a locksmith.'He was nearly at the door when Vaatjie called: 'Three hundred.''Two-fifty,' said Joubert over his shoulder.A moment of silence. 'OK. Fucking OK.'"|Trackers|"Deon Meyer"

Then she said: 'Why? What's happened?'He had been expecting the question, but he wasn't going to tell her. 'Nothing has happened. I'm just trying to be as thorough as possible.''No. Absolutely not,' she said with a barely suppressed indignation. 'Danie knew I'm a widow.'Who lives in luxury, Joubert thought. 'So he definitely didn't ask you for a loan?' His cellphone began ringing. He took it out of his pocket.'No. But I still have the feeling there's a reason you're asking me.''Mrs Flint, I have another call, thank you very much.''I have the right to know ...'He ended the call, because he recognised the number on his cellphone. It was Tanya Flint. He answered.'Tanya?''You had better come and look at this,' she said. There was something in her voice, an urgency.'Where are you? What's happened?''I'm at work. Someone has ...

'If you help me.'The older woman thought it through before nodding slowly, turning around and going to fetch the information. She came back with thefolder already open. '179 Green Park Road in Monte Vista,' she said. 'And there is his cellphone number.' She put the documents down on the counter, so that he could see them.He wrote down the details. 'Is that the date he signed the contract?''That's right.'October twenty-eighth. The day Danie Flint had gone to collect his new, second-hand Porsche.'Did he arrive here with the Porsche?''He parked it just in front there.' The younger woman pointed a finger at where Joubert's car was, right in front of the office. 'I remember him well, because of the fancy car. A boy's face, wouldn't hurt a fly, full of jokes. He stood there and told me his garage at home was too full now, he would have to add more space. Could take six months.''And the rent is 3,000 rand?' Joubert pointed at the amount at the bottom of the account.'No. It's 1,500 deposit, and 1,500 per month.''How did he pay?''It must have been cash, because there isn't a credit card slip stapled to this.'He looked at his timeline. Flint had only begun making cash withdrawals from his secret account on the third of November, and according to Tanya's financial tables he couldn't have done that from their ordinary account. Then his eye fell on the entry for 29 October. Deposit of R147,000.Add 3,000 and you have a round R150,000."|Trackers|"Deon Meyer"

He shook it off. This was not the service.'A moment, Jack?'Fischer looked up. 'Of course, of course. Take a chair.'When he had settled himself in one of the large chairs opposite Jack, he said: 'Jack, there's something here that worries me.''Tell me.''What do we do if Tanya Hint doesn't have more than 30,000 rand?''I thought you were nearly finished with the case?''It might take a couple more days. Maybe more. She has fourteen hours left, if I don't book any travelling expenses. What do we do if it is not enough?'Fischer leaned back, smiled at Joubert in a fatherly manner. 'I told you, they always find the money.''And if she really can't?'The smile disappeared. 'Of course she can. How much money is in the account you discovered?''You know it could be months before she has access to that money. If it isn't connected to a crime.''But it's security. And she has the house, the cars ... Doesn't she have some sort of business too? What about policies? If they have a mortgage bond, there must be a life insurance policy on the husband. Come on, Mat, you know she'll make a plan.'He considered Fischer's point of view. 'I want to clarify the principle,' he said. 'Let's say she tries everything, but still can't raise the money. Or she can only get it in a month's time ...''She'll get it, Mat.''Jack, theoretically. Let's just say.'Fischer's patience was wearing thin. 'We don't work with theories. We select clients, we don't accept them if they can't pay.''Has there ever been a single client who said ""I just can't carry on""?''I won't say there was never ...''What was the policy?''We handle each case on merit.''Jack, you're evading the question.'Fischer threw his hands in the air, his face reddening. 'You keep harping on this. What for?'Mat Joubert leaned forward, his shoulders loomed. But he kept his voice even. 'Because before I left here this afternoon, Fanus Delport said, ""Now don't you go making too much progress"". Because at morning parade ...''He was joking, fuck, Mat, where's your sense of humour?''It's the context, Jack. You're the one who wanted me to get her bank statements electronically so we could book Fanus's hours too. ""Double time"", so we could milk her. It's the norm here. At morning parade no one asked how any cases were progressing. It was all ""how much money did you make?"" ""Did you book your kilometres?"" ...''How the fuck do you think you run a business?' Aggressive. 'This isn't a charity here. There are salaries and infrastructure. Do you know how much the office rent is every month? And our telephone account? You tell me, how do we pay for that if we just start working for people for nothing, a bloody free-for-all? You tell me.''Free-for-all? Who said anything about free-for-all?' Joubert felt hisown temper rising. He took a deep breath, shook his head and said: 'That's not the point.''Well if you're so fucking smart, tell me what the point is'It took him a while to regain control: 'The point is, if I'm this close to a solution after two days, and she doesn't have the money, I want you to tell me to carry on. Finish the job.''You know as well as I do, ""this close"" means nothing. What if the case takes another week or so? Or a month? Where do you draw the line?''Jack, we're not fools. We know how long something will take, we know how far or how close we are to a breakthrough. And I'm telling you now, I need another three days for this. Four, maximum. To either solve it, or to know it can't be solved. She can pay for two days. Surely we can afford to give her two days free. Or on credit. Or something.''Have you got a thing on with her? Is that what this is about?'Mat Joubert rose out of his chair, ready to smack Fischer with the back of his hand.What saved him was Jack's reaction, suddenly rolling his chair backwards, raising his arm defensively, the cowardliness of it.It made Joubert stop, fight for control, get it into his head that his whole future hung in the balance.He stood there for a long time, then turned and walked to the door.Jack said nothing.He was out of the office and halfway down the passage when he stopped and went back. Fischer's hand reached out for the telephone. Joubert ignored it. 'I left the Service because I didn't count any more, Jack,' he said, his voice very quiet now. 'I felt it was unjust. Because I believe we do count. All of us. Tanya Flint as well. Especially Tanya Flint. Because she borrowed 30,000 rand to hire us. Not to enrich herself. Not to go and buy some or other meaningless thing. But to do her duty by her husband. And now it's turning out to be a hell of a painful process, but she has more guts than you and I together, Jack. She wants to get this done. And I'm telling you tonight, if Tanya Flint says she's tried everything and she can't raise more money, then I will finish her case. For all I care, you can subtract the cost from my salary.'"|Trackers|"Deon Meyer"

Mildred, receptionist at Jack Fischer and Associates: 'Mr Fischer would like to know if you are coming back to the office today?''I don't know.''Please hold on.'She put him on hold, elevator music tinkling in the background. Then Jack was on the phone, his voice jovial. 'Mat, looks like you're hot on the trail?' As though nothing had happened last night.'I am, Jack. There's good progress ...''Excellent, excellent, happy to hear that. Mat, Fanie and I have been talking this morning. We discussed the whole thing. From all angles. Financial. Human aspect, that's important to us, Mat. Very important. We would like to meet Mrs Vlok halfway ...'Joubert choked back the impulse to correct Fischer.'... so we thought, we'll give her one day free. Under the circumstances. Right thing to do.

"ap < 06:00"|"nearly six o'clock"|"Jerome Apollis, the bus driver, was forty-three years old. He had fat cheeks and a beer belly, and he was frightened. The proximity of the detectives, the looming presence of Mat Joubert, and the serious circumstances made him look with great anxiety from Bessie Heese to Butshingi, October and eventually at Joubert, where his gaze stayed fixed.They sat in Neville Philander's office, the room too small for comfort. 'Don't worry,' said Bessie Heese. She looked just as professional as the previous day. And fresh, though it was nearly six o'clock. 'The police just want to ask you what you can remember about the twenty-ninth of September,' and she pointed at Philander's computer, where they had shown him the video. Without freezing the image.'I remember well.''Can you tell us about it?' Johnny October asked, his voice respectful and caring. 'It would be a big help to us.'Apollis licked his lips repeatedly, lifted his hands in innocence. 'Mr Flint said it was not an issue. When he saw the video. He said it wasn't my fault.''I understand,' said October. 'We're not saying it was your fault. But we really want to know what happened that day.''And where,' said Joubert.Apollis just stared at him.'Mr Apollis ...' October urged.Apollis dragged his eyes from Joubert, focused on Bessie Heese, a safe haven. 'It was between Atiantis and the R27. Just after the turn- off.' He wiped perspiration from his brow.'Which turn-off?''The road to the shooting range. There was a sign, but it's gone now a long time.''In which direction were you driving?' Joubert asked.'Towards the sea. To the R27.' And then he stopped.'Go on, Jerome.''The Mercedes. They were driving slowly. I wanted to pass. I had my flicker on already. That's why I was so close. I had to wait for the oncoming traffic. Then they stopped suddenly. For nothing. So I bumped him. At the back. On the boot. Behind. We both stopped. I got out, and they ...''Did you see anything strange?' asked October.'No, sir,' he answered, a little bewildered.'Then you got out.''We all got out. Then the one who had been sitting in front... No, the one with the nose, who had been sitting in the back, he came towards me. Then the other one said no, wait, wait, wait. Then they first looked at the damage. I told them, right then. I said, you just stopped, for no reason. The one man said, don't worry, it wasn't my fault, everything was fine. So I said no, I have to make a report. Then he looked at the bus and said no, there's no damage to the bus, and they wouldn't make a fuss, don't worry ...''Where were they standing? Where did each of you stand while this conversation was going on?' asked Butshingi, head down, writing frantically.'We stood between the car and the bus.''Did any one of them touch the boot?''It was four months ago,' said Apollis.'Jerome, if you can't remember, we won't blame you,' said Bessie Heese, soothingly.'I... I think ... the big one with the face. Maybe he stood with his hand on the boot like this.''And then?''Then they said I must go. I said no, I have to get names and telephone numbers, because Mr Flint will want a report. Then that one got sort of angry, and he said ...''Which one?''The one sitting in front.''Which side in front?''Passenger side.''And he said ... ?''He said, I better not mess around, he said he would fix it, but I better go then. Then I said no, they don't understand, it's not that easy with the DRMP. Then he got angry, he threatened me, he would tell the big one to hit me moer toe, get in my effing bus, sorry madam, but he said eff off. Now. So I got in the bus and as I drove away, I phoned Mr Flint and told him the whole story. He said, Jerome, don't worry, if they don't want to make a case and there's nothing wrong with the bus, I know your record is clean. Then, the next afternoon, when I was finished, Mr Flint came to me and said he had watched the video, and he could see what happened, my record would stay clean. And that's the whole story, madam, on my word of honour.''I know, Jerome. You have nothing to worry about.''But then why are all the police here, madam?'"|Trackers|"Deon Meyer"

"ap 06:10"|"ten past six"|"At ten past six they found the first body.It was a shallow grave, in the middle of the triangle, scarcely a metre below the fine sand.Joubert knelt beside October and Butshingi, watching the forensics team in the soft morning light carefully scrape away the sand from the body with their hand-brooms and brushes. Others were busy widening the hole, taking buckets of sand away to pour carefully in a heap.'A woman,' said October in surprise. Recognised by the sandals on her feet, the shape of her body. The grey-white sand clung to her. Forensics brushed it solemnly and carefully from her face. The features were unrecognisable, thanks to three bullet wounds. Only the long, black hair in a plait, undamaged.'They didn't even cover her.'A minute later a constable pulled the yellow bag out of the sand. October, wearing rubber gloves, opened it, found a woman's purse, and inside it, a driver's licence.'Cornelia Johanna van Jaarsveld,' October read out quietly.The surprise was the second body. It lay barely a metre from the woman, at the same depth, but with a black plastic bag wound tightly around his upper body. Only when forensics had cut it away, did October recognise him.'Jinne,' he said, astounded. 'It's Tweetybird.'"|Trackers|"Deon Meyer"

You know, the one Danie Flint was using to blackmail Terror? You're in it, large as life.''I don't know Flint.''You helped to bury him, Mannas, down at Montagu's Gift.
