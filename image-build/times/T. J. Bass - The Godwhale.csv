Ferrite cores warmed up as he ran up and down the roof ramp of one of the hangers. The dish antenna was cold. He ran three hundred feet up to the rim – a convex track tilted at fifteen degrees. He circled a quarter mile and descended the ramp. Warming ferrite increased efficiency. Larry felt exhilaration. He clocked a 7:45 mile around the periphery of the landing pad. Legs ran smoothly. Arms tired."|"The Godwhale"|"T. J. Bass"

Sweat dampened his palms and armpits. ‘Contact in one hour thirty-seven minutes,’ his voice barked over the deck speakers. ‘Stay alert. The Greater ARNOLD has an axe and is battle-conditioned.

By noon he had caught up with the main mass of wreckage – numerous rafts and dome fragments. He picked up a familiar blanket, small and tattered. When he found his home raft he ran the bow of the canoe up on to it and crawled out, weeping. His hands moved across the familiar textures. A broken harpoon was wedged deep. The blood-stains told their story. He sat through the night, face cradled in his arms. A small nosy fish searched through the debris."|"The Godwhale"|"T. J. Bass"
