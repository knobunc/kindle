12:00|noon|"“I think,” said the tourist, “that I would like a little rest now. It was a long crossing. And then perhaps you would care to call back at noon and we can take a look at the city.”"|"The Color of Magic"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"Ymor’s headquarters were in the Leaning Tower at the junction of Rime Street and Frost Alley. At midnight the solitary guard leaning in the shadows looked up at the conjoining planets and wondered idly what change in his fortunes they might herald."|"The Color of Magic"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 07:50"|"ten minutes to eight of the clock"|"The very small demon imprisoned within looked up from its tiny abacus and scowled. “It lacks but ten minutes to eight of the clock,” it snarled. The lid slammed shut, almost trapping the Weasel’s fingers."|"The Color of Magic"|"Terry Pratchett"
12:00|noonday|"The sound of hoofbeats died away, leaving the air to the hum of bees and the occasional rustle of butterfly wings. There was another sound, too, a strange noise for the bright time of noonday."|"The Color of Magic"|"Terry Pratchett"
12:00|noonday|"Twoflower and Hrun looked around the little hollow where they had made their noonday halt. Then they looked at each other."|"The Color of Magic"|"Terry Pratchett"
12:00|noon|"At noon, in a wide green meadow on the lush tableland that was the top of the impossibly balanced Wyrmberg, the dragons and their riders formed a wide circle. There was room beyond them for a rabble of servants and slaves and others who scratched a living here on the roof of the world, and they were all watching the figures clustered in the center of the grassy arena."|"The Color of Magic"|"Terry Pratchett"

00:00|midnight|"It was midnight on the Disc and so, therefore, the sun was far, far below, swinging slowly under Great A’Tuin’s vast and frosty plastron. Rincewind tried a last attempt to fix his gaze on the tips of his boots, which were protruding over the rim of the rock, but the sheer drop wrenched it away."|"The Color of Magic"|"Terry Pratchett"

Because down there was the head of an elephant as big as a reasonablysized continent. One mighty tusk cut like a mountain against the golden light, trailing a widening shadow toward the stars. The head was slightly tilted, and a huge ruby eye might almost have been a red supergiant that had managed to shine at noonday."|"The Color of Magic"|"Terry Pratchett"

There was the same pale sheen around her lips. She looked about fifteen, and very frightened."|"The Color of Magic"|"Terry Pratchett"
