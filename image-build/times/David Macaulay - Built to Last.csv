Due to the slope of the site and the instability of the soil, it had been necessary first to construct a large vaulted basement under almost half of the building. It wasn't until October 15, 1600, that Agha and Bey finally toured the finished structure. In the all-important kitchen, they found the staff of the imaret busily preparing the midday meal. Smoke from beneath great cauldrons of simmering soup rose toward the carefully placed vents that rested on two of the four domes. The other two had been capped by window-filled cupolas to admit more light into the space. As workers scurried back and forth with food for the tables and fuel for the fires, the smell of freshly baked bread, bubbling soup, and rich spices filled the air."|"Built to Last"|"David Macaulay"
