"ap > 08:00"|"A little past eight"|"He looked at his watch in the light of the street lamp. “A little past eight,” he noted. The theatres are busy. Would you care to accompany me on an excursion, Doctor?”"|"The West End Horror"|"Nicholas Meyer"
02:00|"two this night"|"“You chose only two this night,” I pointed out as he inserted the key in the front door lock and began to fiddle and twist with it “How did you know which to bring?”"|"The West End Horror"|"Nicholas Meyer"
"ap 00:15"|"quarter past twelve"|"“My dear Shaw,” Holmes remonstrated forcefully, “I don’t know how you can have learned of Mr. Singh’s arrest—the newsboys are hawking it, very likely—but if you have nothing better to do than rouse mine honest neighbours at a quarter past twelve, I suggest you come along with us. Cabby!”"|"The West End Horror"|"Nicholas Meyer"
"> 01:00"|"after one in the morning"|"“I did not envisage your calling upon him after one in the morning,” I hastened to point out. “In any case, the man’s not a specialist in tropical diseases.”"|"The West End Horror"|"Nicholas Meyer"
"ap < 02:00"|"almost two o’clock"|"It was almost two o’clock when the cab deposited us before Dr. Moore Agar’s imposing residence in Harley Street Remarking that our intrusion was not likely to be rendered less irritating to Dr. Agar by our waiting, Holmes proceeded up the steps and rang the night bell vigourously several times. It took some moments before a light appeared in one of the overhead windows, followed shortly thereafter by another on the floor above. In another few moments the door was opened by the housekeeper, an elderly woman, half asleep, who stood upon the threshold in her nightcap and dressing gown."|"The West End Horror"|"Nicholas Meyer"
"ap 05:00"|five|"“I’ve tried my hand at five and collected eight hundred rejections among them. No, I shall continue as critic and pamphleteer, occasionally turning out a play of my own on the side. Did either of you gentlemen happen to attend a performance of Widowers’ Houses a year or two back?”"|"The West End Horror"|"Nicholas Meyer"
12:00|noon|"I really ought to be at work,” Shaw growled as he sat down with us at the Holbom and eyed askance the Masonic tiling with which the establishment was decorated. “I’ve two pieces due by noon tomorrow, and I haven’t begun either of ‘em yet.” In spite of which statement he showed no disposition to leave."|"The West End Horror"|"Nicholas Meyer"
12:00|midday|"We sat in silence for some moments, awaiting our meal and listening to the hubbub around us: the chat of the many customers crowding the restaurant at midday, the clatter of cutlery, and the incessant swinging of the doors that led to the kitchen. Holmes paid no attention to the chaos, but sat lost in thought, his eyes closed and his chin sunk upon his breast. With his great hawk’s bill of a nose, he resembled nothing so much as some sleeping bird of prey."|"The West End Horror"|"Nicholas Meyer"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"“Sir Arthur engages the singers. Sir Arthur is not here at the moment, as you have quite possibly divined. Sir Arthur is either at cards with some of his titled friends or else at the Lyceum, where he is wasting his talents on incidental music for Irving’s new Macbeth. It would be too much to ask him for the overture to our piece before opening night, but I daresay he will deign to have it ready by then. Perhaps Sir Arthur will even find time to coach the singers once or twice before we open, but I am not sure.” Now he turned and spoke to the company. “Here, everybody!” he cried, “go and have your supper. We shall continue at eight o’clock sharp with Act One from the sausage-roll number. Go on and eat, my dears; there’s nothing of consequence that need detain you here, and you must keep up your strength!”"|"The West End Horror"|"Nicholas Meyer"
"ap 07:45"|"fifteen minutes of eight"|"At this hour Simpson’s was by no means full. We were recognised at once by Mr. Crathie and experienced no difficulty in obtaining a table. It wanted fifteen minutes of eight, granting us some moments for private reflection regarding the unexpected turn events had taken. I, for one, did not feel in the least like eating. I was aware, however, of an overpowering thirst and ordered a brandy and a carafe of water. The brandy burned along my throat like fire, and I found I could not swallow enough water."|"The West End Horror"|"Nicholas Meyer"
"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"“Good morning!” she called cheerily, noticing us. ‘Tickets do not go on sale before noon, you know—though you are quite right to be here early; they’ve been going like hot cakes all week!”"|"The West End Horror"|"Nicholas Meyer"
