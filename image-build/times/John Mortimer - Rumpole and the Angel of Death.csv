All right, Tricia – that’s what she calls herself – Tricia is going to say that she saw a man in a red shirt in the driveway of the Eyles’s house, Wayleave Manor. She heard you shout at Mrs Eyles. Well, we all know about that. Now comes the interesting bit. At about one o’clock in the afternoon of the day before the meet she’d been out for a hack and was riding home past Fallows Wood – that’s where Dorothea Eyles met her death."|"Rumpole and the Angel of Death"|"John Mortimer"

The sabbing was to be made the occasion of a holiday outing and a night spent in the country. When they had got their rucksacks and sleeping-bags out of the van, Roy, Angela, Sebastian and Judy retired to the pub in Wayleave where real ale was obtainable and they used it to wash down vegetable pasties and salads until closing-time at three. Janet Freebody had things to do in the cottage, exercise books to correct and dinner to think about, so she didn’t join the party in the pub. Neither did Den. He said he wanted to go for a walk and so set off, according to Roy, apparently to commune, in a solitary fashion, with nature. This meant that he was alone and unaccounted for at one o’clock when Tricia was going to swear on her oath that she saw him coming out of Fallows Wood with a coil of wire."|"Rumpole and the Angel of Death"|"John Mortimer"

"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"‘Really! Of all the cockeyed clients. I’ve had some dotty ones but never one that didn’t want to be proved innocent before.’ It was early in the morning and the hotel had only been serving the continental breakfast.

"ap 02:30"|two-thirty|"‘What is the single most important fact about this case, Members of the Jury? The fact which I ask you to take with you into your room and put first and last in your deliberations. It’s just this: Mrs Eyles met her death half a mile from any point where the hunt had been. If Dennis Pearson intended to kill her, how did he lure her away to that remote woodland path? Did he offer her a date or an assignation? Did he promise to give her the winner of the two-thirty at Cheltenham? Or did he say, “Just gallop along the track in Fallows Wood and you’ll probably be killed by a bit of tight wire I stretched there yesterday lunchtime”? How did he organize not only that she should be killed, but that she should go so far out of her way to meet her death? It was impossible to organize it, was it not, Members of the Jury? Doesn’t that mean that you must have doubts about Dennis Pearson’s guilt?"|"Rumpole and the Angel of Death"|"John Mortimer"

You know, looking round this bar, I can see a good many people I’ve acted for when they were charged with various offences.

"ap ~ 11:00"|"about eleven o’clock"|"‘And what time did the film end?’ Claude asked.
‘I think it was about eleven o’clock time.’
‘And what happened after that?’"|"Rumpole and the Angel of Death"|"John Mortimer"
"ap 10:45"|"ten forty-five"|"‘That would seem to follow, Mr Rumpole.’ A weary and sepulchral voice came from the Bench, apparently inviting Rumpole to get on with it and not waste time. At which my husband, with elaborate courtesy, said, ‘Thank you, my Lord. Thank you for that helpful interruption in favour of the Defence. Now, Beazley, you say you and your wife were watching a war film at ten forty-five?’"|"Rumpole and the Angel of Death"|"John Mortimer"
"ap ~ 09:00"|"about nine o’clock"|"The evidence was at its worst when Mrs Beazley came back with the treacle tart and cream. ‘Mr Skelton always had a sweet tooth, bless him, and I make treacle tart according to my own recipe which, he said, couldn’t be beaten.’ She had no doubt about what she heard. Michael was standing up and shouting at his father, ‘I’ve got a whole long life to lead and you might die quite soon.’ There was a sudden, awful silence and then Mrs Beazley went on. ‘They just looked at each other and neither of them said anything. I set the plates for their dessert and just got out as quick as I could.’ When she came back to clear away at about nine o’clock, the dining-room was empty and she thought they had probably gone into the drawing-room. (Mr Skelton always liked the coffee served with the pudding.) Then she settled down to watch her favourite war film and knew no more until her husband told her that he’d telephoned for the police and an ambulance was on its way."|"Rumpole and the Angel of Death"|"John Mortimer"
"ap > 11:00"|"after eleven"|"Rumpole always told me that if a witness was telling the truth you should keep the cross-examination short. I don’t know why he told me that, Dodo. He could hardly have thought that I’d ever be in a position to cross-examine anybody. So he was clearly anxious to get Mrs Beazley out of the witness-box as quickly as possible. He established the fact that Michael might have left the house after dinner and not returned until after eleven, and then he let her go. Danny turned his head and whispered in my ear, ‘He hasn’t even challenged her evidence about Michael saying his father might die quite soon. The strongest evidence against us and Rumpole hasn’t even contradicted it!’ It seemed to me he spoke more in sorrow than in anger."|"Rumpole and the Angel of Death"|"John Mortimer"
"ap 10:45"|"ten forty-five"|"I’ll spare you all the gory details, Dodo. Rumpole particularly enjoyed himself with the forensic evidence. He seems to regard himself as the greatest living authority on bloodstains. There was blood of his father’s group on Michael’s hands, his shirt cuffs, on one of his sleeves and on the head of the golf club. Rumpole seemed to be suggesting that the blood got on Michael’s clothes when he knelt down to examine his father’s wounds, and I thought that he had made a bit of headway with this theory, in spite of the gloomy interventions of the learned Judge. ‘I thought your client didn’t want to be a doctor, Mr Rumpole,’ was one of them. ‘I don’t know why he would have been so anxious to examine the wounds.’ Rumpole also got the scene of the crime officer to agree that the grandfather clock in the hall had fallen over and stopped at ten forty-five, which probably would have been the time of the attack. He also established that it was a Saturday, and that Skelton had been playing golf and had left his bag of clubs in the hall, so his assailant wouldn’t have had far to look for a weapon."|"Rumpole and the Angel of Death"|"John Mortimer"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"At four o’clock Claude got to his feet and asked to raise a matter. He told the Judge that the Defence had filed an alibi notice stating that Michael Skelton was in the woods reading a poem he had written to some New Age travellers. However, Mr Rumpole had failed to give the Prosecution the names of the witnesses they intended to call to support this so-called alibi."|"Rumpole and the Angel of Death"|"John Mortimer"
"< 00:00"|"near midnight"|"It was a hot night in late summer, near midnight apparently, when the Constants got the telephone call. It was too hot, Sheena said, and anyway they were too worried to sleep. When the phone rang, Steve looked at it, frozen, expecting the worst news. Sheena took a deep breath and grabbed it. She said she felt a moment of relief when she didn’t hear the voice of Superintendent Greengross. What she heard was much fainter, a woman’s voice, with an attempt at disguise, as though the caller were speaking through a handkerchief. ‘Nineteen Swansdown Avenue,’ was all it said. ‘You’d better get there quick.’ Later, the call was traced to a phone box at the end of nearby Swansdown Avenue. Later still, Sheena said that she thought she recognized the mystery voice."|"Rumpole and the Angel of Death"|"John Mortimer"

I thought of them for a long time and then I rang Bonny Bernard and asked him to send round copies of every piece the Trumpet had published about Sheena Constant and the Little Boy Lost. There was something in one of them, I felt sure, which was of great importance for me to remember. And then, to complete the story, I told him to get all they had written about Tina Santos."|"Rumpole and the Angel of Death"|"John Mortimer"
"ap 03:00"|three|"The Psychic Shop was open at three the next afternoon when I pushed open the door. What on earth did I think I was doing? When young Argent called me Sherlock Rumpole, had the title completely unhinged me? Was I trying to outdo the incomparable Fig Newton, or was this a mission of such delicacy that I didn’t feel I could leave it to him? I had nothing in Court and for the day I was no longer a barrister; in fact I had put on the old tweed jacket, grey flannel bags and comforting Hush Puppies to prove it. I was an anonymous old man after information. If I was rumbled, I had my cover-story pat. I had just dropped in for a clairvoyant reading because I was seriously interested in the future."|"Rumpole and the Angel of Death"|"John Mortimer"

"ap ~ 05:45"|"approximately five forty-five"|"George Freeling was forty-three years old, with a wife and two children in Buckhurst Hill. He worked as a middle manager at Netherbank, a huge glass and concrete tower which dwarfed a Wren church not far from the Mansion House. Each night at approximately five forty-five Mr Freeling joined the population explosion which surged away from their computer screens and, leaving the world’s markets to enrich or ruin their clients, struggled down the tube. On the evening in question the platform for the eastbound Central Line resembled the Black Hole of Calcutta. Most of the sufferers at least had a safe journey home but George Freeling, standing on the edge of the platform, fell in front of the train as it rattled out of the darkness on its way from St Paul’s. He was found to have been shot in the back: a revolver with a silencer and a single blue glove made of polyester and wool were lying between the lines and beside his dead body."|"Rumpole and the Angel of Death"|"John Mortimer"
"ap < 11:00"|"Almost eleven"|"Walking back to the hotel in the moonlight, I looked at my watch. Almost eleven on a Saturday night. It seemed a long time since I and Peter Fishlock had been met at the airport by Betsi Hoprecht, who had stood tall and fair-haired above the smaller, darker inhabitants of Alsace-Lorraine waiting for their loved ones. She had taken us in charge, kept us going on a tour round the monuments, and arranged the dinner at the Kammerzell House at which we were to meet the gallant band who sat shoulder to shoulder, consuming choucroute and fighting for the Rights of Man. I had felt safe in Betsi’s hands, relieved of the painful process of decision. Now I was on my own, crossing the cathedral square, and I decided to see the astronomical clock put on its hourly performance."|"Rumpole and the Angel of Death"|"John Mortimer"
"ap 01:00"|one|"It was a short walk to the Hotel D’Ange Rouge, and from my bedroom I could still hear the odd calls of love from the backpackers who loitered round the cathedral or staggered home singing. I lay in bed reading the written brief to the Court of Human Rights, a somewhat long document prepared by Fishlock with an analysis of all the British cases on bias. The Judges were welcome to it. What I profoundly hoped would stir them out of their international coma would be the Rumpole address, the rallying cry against injustice, the devastating destruction of Billy Bloxham with which I expected to win the day. I heard the cathedral clock strike one and then I turned out my light."|"Rumpole and the Angel of Death"|"John Mortimer"
"ap 01:30"|"half past one"|"The Tokay d’Alsace tasted of grapes, a gentle flavour far removed from the chemical impact of Pommeroy’s Reasonable White. The sun shone on the restaurant terrace, it glittered on the glasses and ice-bucket, and was warm on our faces. Around us the tops of the pinkish, plastered houses bulged like huge bosoms, kept in place by the ribbons of dark oak. Their steep tiled roofs were pierced with the eyes of numberless dormer windows. Flowers clambered round a well in the centre of the square and, on the slender, sand-coloured church steeple, the clock stood at half past one. We had filled the minibus and now occupied another long restaurant table. The rimless professor was there, as was the man in the consular service and his gardener wife. Jeremy Jameson was there, smiling with a mixture of defiance and guilt. He had come downstairs late, buttoning his shirt, which was not satisfactorily tucked into his crumpled linen trousers. Poppy was smiling, sipping Tokay, and reading the Mail on Sunday, hot from the morning plane and greeted by her like a missing child."|"Rumpole and the Angel of Death"|"John Mortimer"
"~ 12:00"|"around midday"|"When, after what seemed a lifetime of alternating bursts of boredom and terror, we got to Kingslake, it proved to be a greenish-grey Regency house in a poor state of repair – and full of draughts, I should imagine – with gumboots in the hallways. Dodo and Hilda had been gossiping about various mistresses and ex-pupils from their old school, and this less than fascinating conversation continued as we paid our duty call to the dahlias and chrysanthemums in the wide herbaceous border. It was around midday and the alcohol content in the Rumpole blood had fallen to a dangerous point. Muttering something about a search for the gents, I stole away through the rose garden and down the gravel paths between the greenhouses which looked in dire need of a lick of paint."|"Rumpole and the Angel of Death"|"John Mortimer"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"I’ll admit I was rather distracted that breakfast time in the kitchen of our so-called mansion flat in the Gloucester Road. I was trying to gain as much strength as possible from a couple of eggs on a fried slice, pick up a smattering of the events of the day from the wireless and make notes in the case of Dr Ireton, with whom I had a conference booked for five o’clock. My usual calm detachment about that case was unsettled by the discovery that the corpse in question was that of Judge Chippy with whom I had shared so many a friendly jar. There was little time to spare before I had to set off for a banal matter of receiving a huge consignment of frozen oven-ready Thai dinners in Snaresbrook."|"Rumpole and the Angel of Death"|"John Mortimer"
