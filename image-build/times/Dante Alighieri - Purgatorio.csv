For the Church, the four daytime hours listed above (tierce, sext, none, and vespers) would be supplemented by three additional predaylight or postdaylight hours: matins with lauds (see Purg.

"ap 01:12"|1:12|"43–51   At first, because of the distortion brought about by its great distance from the viewers, the source of the unusual light that fills the forest is wrongly identified as seven golden trees. The sense of lines 46–47 is clearer if we recall that Dante subscribed to a theory of perception that distinguished brightness and color, the “proper objects” of sight, about which it cannot err, from such secondary features as size, shape, number, movement and motionlessness, etc., which were considered the “common objects” of perception—common, that is, to several “mingled senses” (47). As they approach, and as Dante and Matilda advance toward them, the outlines of the bright objects become clearer, and Dante’s power of perception—the power that presents sense impressions to the brain, “the power that offers reason matter” (49)—judged them correctly to be seven lighted candelabra. (Though he earlier took them for trees, other details of the vision suggest that Dante may have had in mind not seven branching candelabra, but seven candlesticks, each with a single lit candle. The Latin version of the Book of Revelation, which could be said to contain the seed of his invention, has the word candelabra, which is translated in the King James version as “candlesticks”: “And I turned to see the voice that spake within me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks” [Rev. 1:12].) At the same time as the form of the candelabra becomes unmistakable, and for the same reason, what had seemed at first a melody (23) and then distinctly a song (36) becomes to Dante’s ear an intelligible sequence of syllables forming the Hebrew word “Hosanna,” the cry with which the multitude greeted Christ as he entered Jerusalem on the occasion commemorated on Palm Sunday (see Matt. 21:9).

St. John, too, was instructed more than once to record the contents of his vision. (See, for example, Rev. 1:11: “What thou seest, write in a book.”) Beatrice’s words to Dante—her first since she instructed him to raise his downcast head and look upon her, midway through Canto XXXI (67–69)—mark the beginning of yet another “act” in the symbolic drama of sacred history.

We are reminded that ever since it first rose over the shoulders of the mountain in Inferno I, the sun has often served as a symbol of God and of the illumination of Divine Wisdom. It is appropriate that it should appear at its brightest as the journey toward purification approaches its end. [return to English / Italian]"|Purgatorio|"Dante Alighieri"
