Of course, since Dante is writing from the perspective of 1300, he is careful to avoid jumping ahead of that time, but his knowledge of events between 1300 and the time when he is writing allows him to exploit the resources of prophecy.

III, vi, 2–3), there are two modes of measuring the hours: the “temporal hours…used by the Church” are hours that divide day and night into twelve hours each, hours that increase or diminish in length as the length of day and night, respectively, diminishes or increases with changing seasons; the other mode measures “equal hours,” dividing the sum of day and night, whatever the respective length of day and night, into twenty-four equal hours. For the Church, the four daytime hours listed above (tierce, sext, none, and vespers) would be supplemented by three additional predaylight or postdaylight hours: matins with lauds (see Purg. I, 115–117, note); prime, the hour of sunrise; and compline (see Purg. VIII, 1–6 and 13, note). Together, these formed the seven canonical hours, times of day canonically appointed for offices of devotion. Since Dante places his journey so close to the vernal equinox, the discrepancy between “temporal hours” and “equal hours” is of little account in the Comedy."|Purgatorio|"Dante Alighieri"
