"ap 11:00"|eleven|"At the stroke of eleven on a cool April night, a woman named Joey Perrone went overboard from a luxury deck of the cruise liner M.V. Sun Duchess. Plunging toward the dark Atlantic, Joey was too dumbfounded to panic."|"Skinny Dip"|"Carl Hiaasen"
03:30|"Three-thirty in the morning"|"“Exactly what time did your wife leave the stateroom?” the detective asked.
“Three-thirty in the morning,” Chaz said.
The specificity of the lie was important to ensure that the rescue operation would focus on the wrong swatch of ocean. The ship’s location at 3:30 a.m. would have been approximately seventy miles north of the spot where he’d tumbled his wife overboard."|"Skinny Dip"|"Carl Hiaasen"

03:30|"three-thirty in the morning"|"Perfect, Chaz thought. “Look, Joey was happy last night,” he said, not quite as insistently. “Why else would she dash out at three-thirty in the morning to go dancing on the deck?”"|"Skinny Dip"|"Carl Hiaasen"
03:30|"3:30 a.m."|"Before the Sun Duchess had departed Key West, Chaz had checked the weather radar on TV at a famous bar called Sloppy Joe’s. He had known that the skies would be clear by 3:30 a.m., the fabricated time of his wife’s disappearance."|"Skinny Dip"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 05:00"|five|"Joey couldn’t help but giggle. “You married six waitresses?”
“Actually, it was five. The last one was a TV producer.”
“Oh, Mick—”"|"Skinny Dip"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"< 00:00"|"nearly midnight"|"They were having coffee at a truck-stop diner on Road 84. It was nearly midnight and Rolvaag was in a hurry to go deal with the rats that might or might not be scampering loose inside his car."|"Skinny Dip"|"Carl Hiaasen"
12:00|noon|"“As of tomorrow noon, yeah. They’ll keep one chopper up until sunset, but that’s mainly for show,” Rolvaag said."|"Skinny Dip"|"Carl Hiaasen"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"At first, Red Hammernut had been wary of Chaz’s audacious proposition, but soon he’d come around. It was he who was now phoning Chaz at three in the morning at the Marriott."|"Skinny Dip"|"Carl Hiaasen"
12:00|noon|"“Why, sure. What the hell else could it be?” Red Hammernut’s voice whorled in the static. “What a tur’ble fucking thing, just tur’ble. Tell me, son, they still out searchin’ for her? The Coast Guard boys, I mean.”
“Until tomorrow at noon. Then they call it quits.”
“Well, I’ll be damned.”"|"Skinny Dip"|"Carl Hiaasen"
12:00|noon|"Six
The call from the Coast Guard came at noon sharp.
“I can’t believe you’re giving up!” Chaz said. His bags had been packed for an hour. “My wife’s out there in the water somewhere—what if she’s still alive?”"|"Skinny Dip"|"Carl Hiaasen"
12:00|noon|"Chaz walked him to the door and said, “The Coast Guard called. They quit searching at noon.”"|"Skinny Dip"|"Carl Hiaasen"
01:30|"One-thirty in the morning"|"“One-thirty in the morning, kangaroo time, he’s wide-awake,” Gallo said. “Wants to talk to someone ASAP. Says it’s important.”"|"Skinny Dip"|"Carl Hiaasen"
03:30|"Three-thirty in the morning"|"Chaz experienced a disconcerting twitch in his colon. “Three-thirty in the morning, like I told you before. I remember looking at my watch.”"|"Skinny Dip"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 05:45"|Five-forty-five|"He sat up on the couch and rubbed his eyes. “Time?”
“Five-forty-five.”
“This better be good.” He reached for the lamp, but she grabbed his arm."|"Skinny Dip"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap < 05:10"|"Almost five ten"|"“A hundred and thirty-one pounds,” Joey announced, smoothing the water from her hair. “But I’m tall. Almost five ten.”"|"Skinny Dip"|"Carl Hiaasen"
23:00|"eleven p.m."|"“Is this Charles Perrone? Chaz, we don’t know each other yet, but soon you’ll be giving me a shockingly large sum of money. . . . No, this isn’t the cable company. This is the person who saw you push your lovely wife off the Sun Duchess last Friday night. . . . That’s correct. At eleven p.m. sharp, in a drizzling rain. You grabbed her by the ankles and chucked her overboard. Chaz, you still there? Oh, Cha-az?”"|"Skinny Dip"|"Carl Hiaasen"
09:00|"nine in the morning"|"Not even nine in the morning and already Tool was sweating off the fentanyl patches. To cool down, he removed his boots and overalls, then chugged a liter of Mountain Dew that he’d picked up at the Circle K on Powerline. Fiddling with the radio, he miraculously located a decent country station. Shania Twain was singing about how much fun it was to be a woman, though Tool couldn’t see how that could be true. Just about every female he’d ever known, starting with his mother, seemed perpetually pissed off at the human race. Or could be it was just me in particular, Tool thought."|"Skinny Dip"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 09:30"|"half-past nine"|"At half-past nine, the man he was bodyguarding emerged from the house and hurried up the street toward the minivan. Up close he looked shiny and clean-cut—awful damn young to be a widower, Tool mused. You couldn’t help but wonder what had happened to the guy’s old lady."|"Skinny Dip"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 10:30"|ten-thirty|"Mick Stranahan and Joey Perrone were surprised to see Chaz’s yellow Humvee when they came around the corner at ten-thirty."|"Skinny Dip"|"Carl Hiaasen"
12:00|noon|"By noon the locksmith and the alarm technician were gone, but Charles Perrone hadn’t come out of the house. Joey was restless, ready to roll. She had tucked her hair under a Marlins cap and costumed herself in long pants and a loose-fitting work shirt. Instead of a Bible, her prop this time was a toolbox. Someone watching her come down the sidewalk might have mistaken her for a man, because of her height and long athletic stride."|"Skinny Dip"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"< 00:00"|"before midnight"|"On the drive back to Miami, Joey started thinking about the last time she and her husband had had sex—in their cabin aboard the Sun Duchess, less than five hours before he tossed her overboard. She couldn’t recall that Chaz had behaved any differently in bed; his performance had been typically voracious and unflagging. It infuriated her to think he could have enjoyed himself with such abandon, knowing that before midnight he would murder his partner in pleasure."|"Skinny Dip"|"Carl Hiaasen"
05:42|"5:42 a.m."|"Thirteen
Mick Stranahan phoned Charles Perrone at 5:42 a.m.
“Good morning, dipshit,” he said, this time doing Jerry Lewis. The Mexican writer who owned the island adored The Nutty Professor, and Stranahan had watched it often on the VCR. There were worse ways to get through a tropical depression."|"Skinny Dip"|"Carl Hiaasen"
17:30|"5:30 p.m."|"Ricca Jane Spillman held a cosmetology license from the state of Florida, so it was simply a matter of figuring out where she worked. Stranahan made a pit stop in Hallandale to find a pay phone, ripping a sheaf of beauty-salon listings from the Yellow Pages. He narrowed his search to the western suburbs of northern Broward, and after only fifty-five minutes of blind calling he located Chaz’s girlfriend. She was a senior stylist/colorist at a shop called Hair Jordan, and by chance she happened to have an opening at 5:30 p.m."|"Skinny Dip"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"Normally he didn’t return from work until six o’clock, so Joey assumed that the slam of the car door had come from another driveway. When a key began jiggling the front doorknob, she tugged up her jeans, shot out of the bathroom, snatched the steak knife off the carpet and rolled beneath the bed."|"Skinny Dip"|"Carl Hiaasen"
00:00|Midnight|"“Anytime,” Chaz said. “Tell me where and when.”
“Midnight. The boat docks down at Flamingo.”
“I forget where that is.”"|"Skinny Dip"|"Carl Hiaasen"
00:00|midnight|"“Still, I was impressed by how quickly you’ve gotten past your grief.”
“See you at midnight,” Chaz Perrone said.
Joey stood alone in front of the bathroom mirror and said, “Girl, now you’ve gone and done it.”"|"Skinny Dip"|"Carl Hiaasen"
03:00|"Three in the morning"|"To make matters worse, it had been her idea. Three in the morning, she’s lying alone in bed with the windows open and the taste of the ocean breeze on her tongue. Every time she shuts her eyes she hears this weird, steady chirping noise—screek, screek, screek—and every time she opens her eyes it stops. So the noise is strictly in her mind, driving her batty, when all of a sudden she figures out what it is: bed springs. The chirping noise inside her skull was the sound made by the mattress springs while Chaz was trying to hump his hippie date and Joey was under the bed."|"Skinny Dip"|"Carl Hiaasen"
00:00|midnight|"“Was that Chaz you were calling?”
“It was,” Stranahan said. “We’re on for midnight.”
“And what are we demanding, blackmailwise?”"|"Skinny Dip"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"Stranahan parked the Suburban in a cluster of cabbage palms near the campground, a short jog from the marina. By now it was ten o’clock and most of the campers, besieged by insects, had retreated to their sleeping bags. Mick fiddled with the dashboard stereo but the radio signal was spotty."|"Skinny Dip"|"Carl Hiaasen"
00:00|midnight|"Stranahan was already on the water when the Grand Marquis rolled up at the marina. The caveman got out slowly while Chaz Perrone practically ejected himself from the passenger side, slapping frenetically at his face and neck. They walked back and forth along the slips, eventually choosing an unoccupied houseboat and prying the door. The caveman ducked inside while Chaz hopped back on the dock, stumbling over a coiled rope. After a while he began to pace in and out of the shadows, still flailing at the bugs. At midnight Stranahan called out his name and Chaz dropped into a ludicrous semi-crouch that he must have picked up from a Jackie Chan movie."|"Skinny Dip"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"“It was a week ago tonight,” Stranahan began. “You and your wife came on deck shortly before eleven and walked toward the stern. Nobody was outside because it was raining. Oh, I almost forgot: You were wearing a dark blue blazer and charcoal slacks. Mrs. Perrone had on a cream-colored skirt, white sandals and, I believe, a gold watch on her wrist.”"|"Skinny Dip"|"Carl Hiaasen"
04:00|"four in the morning"|"They were sitting in Red Hammernut’s office, overlooking the toxic though tranquil pond. Chaz and Tool had driven straight from Flamingo to LaBelle, arriving at four in the morning and nodding off like junkies in the parking lot. Chaz’s nostrils were blood-encrusted and his face was pocked extravagantly with crimson insect bites. Red Hammernut couldn’t help but stare. The man looked like a photo out of an exotic medical textbook."|"Skinny Dip"|"Carl Hiaasen"
12:00|noonday|"Strom circled deliriously as Joey advanced, weapon in hand, to the end of the dock. The young man in the bow of the skiff was emitting a gargling sound, presumably in appreciation of Joey’s physique, as she drew back the spinning rod. His gaze never left her chest, so he didn’t see the fishing lure arcing brightly through the noonday sky. Joey wasn’t sure if she snagged his shirt or the flesh of his neck, but in any case she jerked hard enough to spill the howling imbecile into the water."|"Skinny Dip"|"Carl Hiaasen"
00:00|Midnight|"“For starters, I’m hearing the same weird duet all day and all night in my head—‘Midnight Rambler’ as performed by Eydie Gorme and Cat Stevens. I’m sure they’re perfectly nice folks, but frankly I’m ready to shove a sawed-off down my throat. One blessed hour of silence,” the man said wistfully, “would be welcome.”"|"Skinny Dip"|"Carl Hiaasen"
12:00|Noon|"“Noon tomorrow. Be my guest.” Corbett Wheeler leaned closer. “The bereaved widower will be delivering a eulogy.”"|"Skinny Dip"|"Carl Hiaasen"
06:00|"six in the morning"|"“I tried calling all night long, and then it’s six in the morning and your line’s busy.” Ricca skidding the plaster heel along the tile floor."|"Skinny Dip"|"Carl Hiaasen"
17:00|"5:00 p.m."|"No problem, Chaz told himself. I’ll do it in the sticks somewhere, dump her body, then take her car to the airport. There was plenty of time—American had a 5:00 p.m. nonstop to San José."|"Skinny Dip"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap < 05:00"|"shortly before five"|"Rolvaag made sure that the rest of the day passed slowly, to give his telephone time to ring. It didn’t. Then, shortly before five, he was approached by a well-set middle-aged man with a deep-water tan. The man introduced himself and presented a faded ID from the Dade State Attorney’s Office, where many years ago he had worked as an investigator."|"Skinny Dip"|"Carl Hiaasen"
