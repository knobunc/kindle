"ap < 05:50"|"almost ten to six"|"I looked at my watch. It was almost ten to six. I had just over ten minutes to get there. It wasn’t good to be late for a job interview. Then again, it was an interview for a volunteer job. What was the worst that could happen? That I wouldn’t get a job that didn’t pay that I didn’t want to do to begin with?"|Shattered|"Eric Walters"
"ap 07:45"|"seven forty-five"|"The counter was already overflowing with dirty dishes and I put down the tray carefully so as not to disturb the rest of the mess. The sink, filled with soapy suds, was already filled to capacity. Was I supposed to help wash the dishes as well? I hated washing dishes— not that I did it very often. Berta, our housekeeper, took care of all those things. If I was supposed to do the dishes here that could take forever. Then again, what did I care? The longer I was here the more quickly I’d be through having to come back. It was seven forty-five. If I worked another fifteen minutes that would be two hours. That meant I had to come here twenty times to complete my placement. If I came here three times a week that would take almost seven weeks. If I hadn’t been so stupid I would have started doing my hours when everybody else did. It would probably be better if I did stay and work on the dishes. If I stayed until nine that would be three hours, and I’d only have to come here thirteen times—only thirteen times. I shook my head."|Shattered|"Eric Walters"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"My mother pulled the car over to the curb directly in front of the building. There was no lineup in front—I’d been hoping that was the case. It was still early—not even five o’clock—and I was here to help with the set-up."|Shattered|"Eric Walters"
"< 00:00"|"almost midnight"|"“I could come tonight,” I said. The words had jumped out before I’d thought them through.
“It’ll be almost midnight before I’m through,” he warned.
“It’s a Friday night. I don’t have to be in until later than that.”"|Shattered|"Eric Walters"
12:00|noon|"I’D TAKEN A BUS, a commuter train, and then finally a taxi to get back to school by noon. I wanted to get there in time for civics—the class before lunch. I signed in at the office—told them I’d had an appointment, and then headed off for class. I got there late but still got there. I quietly slipped in the door. Mrs. Watkins was writing on the board. She looked over and gave me a disdainful glare. She continued writing and talking. The only open seats were—of course—in the front row. Was this going to be my new seat?"|Shattered|"Eric Walters"
12:00|midday|"THE SUN BEAT DOWN strongly and brightly. It felt more like midday in the summer than four in the afternoon in April. But that was how this country went— directly from way too cold to far too hot. Spring lasted about two days."|Shattered|"Eric Walters"
