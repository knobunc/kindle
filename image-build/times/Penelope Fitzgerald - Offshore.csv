Apart from anything else, his working day did not begin till seven or eight, so that he was often there during the day, and always ready to listen; but there were times when his customers left early, at two or three in the morning, and then Maurice, somewhat exhilarated with whisky, would come over to Grace, magically retaining his balance on the gangplank, and sit on the gunwale, waiting. He never went below, for fear of disturbing the little girls. Nenna used to wrap up in her coat and bring out two rugs for him."|Offshore|"Penelope Fitzgerald"
"ap 06:30"|"half past six"|"‘Where? Oh, a gentleman’s county,’ Pinkie replied, wallowing through his barrier of ice, ‘Say Northamptonshire. You can drive up every morning easily, be in the office by ten, down in the evening by half past six. I calculate you could spend about 60 per cent of your life at work and 40 per cent at home. Not too bad, that. Mind you, these Jacobean properties don’t come on the market every day. We just happen to be more lucky at laying hands on them than most. Or Norfolk, of course, if you’re interested in small boats.’"|Offshore|"Penelope Fitzgerald"

She was, therefore, never able to thank him. Although it must be three or four in the morning, there were still lights showing on Lord Jim. Richard was standing on the afterdeck, wearing a Naval duffle coat, Arctic issue."|Offshore|"Penelope Fitzgerald"
03:30|"half past three in the morning"|"Richard was the kind of man who has two clean handkerchiefs on him at half past three in the morning. From the hold, where everything had its proper place, he fetched a bottle of TCP and a pair of half-wellingtons. The boots looked very much too big, but she appreciated that he wouldn’t have liked to lend a pair of Laura’s. Or perhaps Laura had taken all her things with her."|Offshore|"Penelope Fitzgerald"
"ap 08:50"|"ten minutes to nine"|"It was just ten minutes to nine, and Richard walked by on his way up to World’s End to catch a bus to the office. Nenna thought, if he doesn’t look my way I’ll never speak to him again, and in fact I’ll never speak to any man again, except Maurice. But as he drew level with Grace Richard gave her a smile which melted her heart, and waved to her in a way entirely peculiar to himself, half way between a naval salute and a discreet gesture with the rolled umbrella."|Offshore|"Penelope Fitzgerald"
