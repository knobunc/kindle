15:00|"3:00 pm"|"Steele had kept the other survivors – the senators and representatives, cabinet officials and lobbyists and civil servants – from the President for the first twenty-four hours; even given the woman’s remarkable self-possession, it would be counter-productive to overwhelm her. Today at 3:00 pm would be the first major meeting; that would surely be enough to test anyone’s resolve, especially given the classified report they’d reviewed that suggested they were also dealing with impossible, maybe even magical forces."|"Zombie Apocalypse! Washington Deceased"|"Lisa Morton"
12:00|noon|"The second meeting was with Bob Delancy. When the President asked Steele to arrange the meeting at noon, she didn’t know why. She didn’t like Delancy – he was a fifth-term senator who was an old school political hack and a hard-line hawk. He still chaired the Senate’s Defense Committee, and was always the first to vote in favour of military action. During the shutdown, he’d voted with his party to refuse negotiation."|"Zombie Apocalypse! Washington Deceased"|"Lisa Morton"

"~ 13:40"|"approximately 13:40 hours"|"Today at approximately 13:40 hours, we encountered a phenomenon we hadn’t hitherto witnessed: intelligent members of the NZOAMW, who had set up a machine-gun nest a few dozen yards from our southwest perimeter, abruptly ceased the attack. Initial assumptions were that they’d run out of ammo or experienced technical problems, but they failed to respond to our counter-attack, and the three members of NZOAMW manning the post were terminated with ease. A sweep of the area revealed eight other NZOAMW soldiers, all of whom seemed equally unaware and unfocused; only one tried to brandish a rifle as our squad approached, and he moved so slowly that he hadn’t finished raising the weapon before he was shot."|"Zombie Apocalypse!

Until the perimeter could be expanded to include more of Washington, most of the politicians worked now from the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. Kevin was negotiating one of its long, marble-tiled hallways when he heard his name called. He turned to see a man just exiting one of the offices and waving him back. It took a minute for him to remember: Senator Davis Tilich was the big, red-faced Texan who chaired the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions."|"Zombie Apocalypse!
