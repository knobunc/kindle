"ap 01:30"|one-thirty|"The New York hall was about the size of a high-school classroom, and an interior window separated it from a small office. At one-thirty, the time of the job call, action would take place at the window. Job sheets, if any, would be posted on a corkboard. Meanwhile, there was a clipboard with a sheaf of papers headed “OFFSHORE JOBS,” showing positions that had been picked up in recent weeks and the age of the cards that had won them. Some of the runs were “Coastwise,” “Far East,” “South America,” “N. Europe,” “R/World , “W. Africa,” “Caribbean,” “Med,” “Panama.” Andy said,”South America is the romance run—beautiful women, beautiful ports.” Andy had never been to South America. To make unexpected replacements, owners will fly people to foreign ports. In extremes, they have used the Concorde. Andy once turned up for a job call at the New York hall and that night was on a flight to Athens. On each offshore-job sheet was a “Reason” column, explaining why the job had come open: “LOA” (leave of absence), “Quit,” “Fired.” One sheet had called for a mariner to fly off at once on Iberia to Gibraltar. “Rotary” was the reason. He replaced someone whose hundred and twenty days were up—the maximum sea time allowed by the union, in the interest of rationing available work."|"Looking for a Ship"|"John McPhee"

Tension grew within him as the end of a year approached. He had seen a man get a ship with a card that was three hundred and sixty-four days twenty-three hours and fifty-six minutes old. (“He was sweating.”) For Andy, the end came without a ship. He still refers funereally to “the day my card rolled over.” He needed work so badly that he signed up as an able-bodied seaman on an integrated tug-barge operating between Perth Amboy and Duluth.

Taped to the satellite-navigation receiver on the bridge were recent advisories from the Maritime Administration on the subject of pirates. On the west coast of South America, the S.S. Mallory Lykes had been “boarded by one or more pirates with machetes.” In the Strait of Malacca, the master of a South Korean vessel had been “beaten and forced to open the ship’s safe by pirates who boarded the ship in the vicinity of Batam Island.” Lying near the SatNav was a Maritime Administration brochure called “Piracy Countermeasures.” It said, “Countermeasures should be designed to keep boarders off the ship. Repelling armed pirates already on deck can be dangerous … . Have water hoses under pressure with nozzles ready … . Use rat guards on all mooring lines and illuminate the lines … .

A sheet of clear plastic deflects the wind. He is not quite like a fly on a bowsprit, but somewhere near it—projected far over the water, over the nose bulb, and riding up and down the Pacific swells. He stands there, and stays there, in rain and lightning. He is transferred to a bridge wing if the weather gets rough and he lets the mate know that “she’s taking green seas.” In Peewee’s words, “When we’re taking sprays over the bow, taking seas up here, we go to the wing. It don’t happen too much on this run. This run mostly calm all the time.” The lookout reports the ships he sees, describing what has long since appeared on the radar. He reports wooden boats that the radar doesn’t see. He looks for debris, floating objects, life rafts. We occasionally pass through a fishing fleet as if it were a cloud of gnats. Peewee says, “I report the first one and leave the rest to the mate. They all start turning on lights. There’s too many to report. They fish in the dark.
Sometimes you’re right up on them before they turn on their lights.” Mac remembers when the lookout rang a bell if he saw something to starboard, rang it twice if to port, and three times if an object was dead ahead. He even remembers when lookouts shouted, “Lights are bright, sir!” and the mate on the bridge shouted back, “Aye, aye!” On this ship, it would have to be some shout.

You can climb the flying bridge, wrap a pillow around your ears, stuff yourself in a hawsepipe, hide under a table—you cannot escape the sound. As a result, there are union rules limiting the sound to six hours a day.

12:00|noon|"When Darwin got off H.M.S. Beagle in Valparaiso, he was ashore nearly four months. When we got off the Stella Lykes in Valparaiso, we were ashore scarcely six hours before the longshoremen had loaded the button-down shirts, and the ship was preparing to go. The crew members do not see much of the countries they come to. Andy, who was so pleased to be making a run for the first time to the west coast of South America, could not get off in Cartagena or in Guayaquil and had time in Balboa only for a short walk with me. In Guayaquil, the ship was moved from one berth to another at noon, and he had to be aboard for that, and then at four he went on watch, and then we sailed. In the old days of the stick ships, turnaround time was long. A ship would sit in port a week or two. With the innovation of container ships and heavy-lift sheer-leg dockside cranes, the handling of cargo became intensely efficient. Our port visits are so brief that we often stay on sea watches. If port watches were set, a mate, for example, would be eight hours on and eight off, then eight more on and eight off, and then have thirty-two hours to himself. By that time, the Stella Lykes would be at least halfway to the next country. In the forty-two days of a voyage, J. Peter Fritz, the chief mate, who is in charge of cargo, usually goes ashore twice,
and only briefly. The captain goes ashore even more rarely. When he comes up the gangway in Charleston to begin his routine of two voyages, he figures that the next time he sets foot on land will be eighty-four days later, in the same place. Andy was once on a dry-cargo ship that was in port a week at a time, but since then he has seldom been in any port more than twenty-four hours. Join the merchant navy and glimpse the world. Glimpse, in fact, only the seaports of the world. I heard a crewman say, “You get to Haifa, you can’t get to Jerusalem. You get to Alexandria, you can’t get to Cairo.”"|"Looking for a Ship"|"John McPhee"
"ap 10:08"|10:08|"Likewise Andy. As the heavens fade, Andy has been out on the port bridge wing shooting Achernar, Mars, Sirius, and Venus—plucking them from the drift of clouds. Good with a sextant, he resembles a Castilian shepherd drinking
wine. Ordinarily, he shoots the stars as an academic exercise, a way of keeping fresh his celestial navigation, which he figures out with his calculator and his dividers in the chartroom. As second mate, he enjoys his role as the ship’s “navigator”—laying out courses on charts. However, the essence of the navigation has been purloined by the computer SatNav, which receives its intelligence from satellites. Some days ago, Andy said, “I almost wish the SatNav would bust down, so I could do something more challenging.” This morning, he’s got his wish. The SatNav’s digital clock reads 10:08:19 Greenwich mean time. It has read 10:08:19 Greenwich mean time for two hours. As successive satellites have passed overhead, the SatNav has not accepted a fix. By taking fixes about once an hour, it ordinarily tells us, among other things, how far our next programmed way point is and where we are at the moment. In some places, such as the North Atlantic, there are redundant systems of electronic navigation—Decca, for example, in North Europe, in addition to loran and SatNav. A nervous ship may be using them all. Down here in the Southeast Pacific, SatNav is alone. Other electronic systems are not in place here, or anywhere near here. The SatNav includes a feature called automatic heading, but in fact it doesn’t know what your heading is unless you tell it. Having shot the stars and now the rising sun, Andy knows where we are. He wants to tell SatNav, but he is unable to. Like a person whose cursor has ceased to blink, he is locked out of SatNav’s keyboard. He has never before faced such a problem. He is speed-reading the SatNav manual. He, too, is impervious
to the ship’s roll. With his sextant, Andy could fix the horizon and shoot the sun from the bar of a flying trapeze."|"Looking for a Ship"|"John McPhee"
09:00|"Nine A.M."|"Below the bridge deck is the boat deck, and on the boat deck is Captain Washburn’s office. Nine A.M. I often sit here in the morning drinking coffee, reading manifests, and listening to him. “My house is your house,” he says, and the remark is especially amiable in this eight-deck tower called the house. During the night, a planned avalanche occurred in the office. From seaport to seaport, papers accumulate on the captain’s desk. “Paperwork has become the bane of this job,” he says. “If a ship doesn’t have a good copying machine, it isn’t seaworthy. The more ports, the more papers. South American paperwork is worse than the paperwork anywhere else in the world but the Arab countries and Indonesia.” Deliberately, he allows the pile on his desk to rise until a deep roll on a Pacific swell throws it to the deck and scatters it from bulkhead to bulkhead. This he interprets as a signal that the time has come to do paperwork. The paper carpet may be an inch deep, but he leaves it
where it fell. Bending over, he picks up one sheet. He deals with it: makes an entry, writes a letter—does whatever it requires him to do. Then he bends over and picks up another sheet. This goes on for a few days until, literally, he has cleared his deck."|"Looking for a Ship"|"John McPhee"
01:00|"1 A.M."|"Peter grew up, graduated from the Massachusetts Maritime Academy, and went to sea. It was his calling, and he loved it. He also loved, seriatim, half the young women in Rhode Island. He was a tall, blond warrior out of “The Twilight of the Gods” with an attractively staccato manner of speech. Not even his physical attractions, however, could secure his romantic hatches. “Dear Peter” letters poured in
after he left his women and went off for months at sea. Eventually, he married, had a son, and left the Merchant Marine. For several years, he worked for an electronic-alarm company and miserably longed for the ocean. (“I will not admit how much I love this job. The simple life. Having one boss. Not standing still, not being stagnant; the idea of moving, the constant change.”) Eventually, he couldn’t stand it any longer, and went off to circle the world on the container ship President Harrison. (“I had the killer card. I had planned it.”) He made more money in eighty-seven days than he could make in a year ashore. After a family conference, he decided to ship out again. Like his lifelong friend Clayton Babineau, he coveted a job that would take him on short runs from his home port. Every ten days, the Marine Electric went out of Providence for Hampton Roads, and nine days later she came back. She went right past Peter’s house. He night-mated her. His wife, Nancy, said to him, “Hey, wouldn’t it be great if you got a job on that one? You could be home with your family.” He tried repeatedly, without success. His friend Clay Babineau, sailing as second mate, died of hypothermia that night off Chincoteague in the winter storm. The Marine Electric was thirty-nine years old in the bow and stern, younger in the middle, where she had been stretched for bulk cargo. In the language of the Coast Guard’s Marine Casualty Report, her forward hatch covers were “wasted, holed, deteriorated, epoxy patched.” Winds were gusting at sixty miles an hour, and the crests of waves were forty feet high. As the Marine Electric plowed the sea, water fell through the hatch covers
as if they were colanders. By 1 A.M., the bow was sluggish. Green seas began pouring over it. A list developed. The captain notified the Coast Guard that he had decided to abandon ship. The crew of thirty-four was collecting on the starboard boat deck, but before a lifeboat could be lowered the ship capsized, and the men, in their life jackets, were in the frigid water. In two predawn hours, all but three of them died, while their ship went to rest on the bottom, a hundred and twenty feet below, destroyed by what the Coast Guard called “the dynamic effects of the striking sea.”"|"Looking for a Ship"|"John McPhee"

The Redskins are more important to Captain Washburn than any other group of people on land. They mattered no less to him then. He had developed an affectionate and protective sympathy for the Redskins after the Chicago Bears beat them 73—0 in their fourth Washington season. Washburn, who was at that game, had been following the team even before they came to Washington. He remembered them as the Boston Redskins. He remembered many of them as Duluth Eskimos.

He is a graduate of Tulane and taught for ten years—math and social studies as well as Spanish—before he discovered that he could make four times as much painting valve wheels at sea as he could teaching children on land. His great-uncles were Norwegian merchant seamen. His mother has

You are always arriving or leaving port on the four-to-eight. But when I get a ship I ask for that watch.

It comes on the four-to-eight, in the predawn. We have little to leave in Guayaquil. The last time we ran the gantlet here, a fortnight ago, the pirates missed, among other things, five hundred VCRs. They missed half a ton of photographic supplies, three tons of plastic tape, five tons of synthetic rubber, twenty tons of crude talc, forty tons of tinplate, and three hundred tons of drilling mud. They missed five thousand six hundred barrels of resin. They missed a container said to contain seven tons of mixed windshield wipers, hubcaps, and musical jewel boxes. They missed the container said to contain sixteen
thousand six hundred and thirty-six pounds of shower curtains, telephones, and wall clocks. They missed a container said to contain seventy-seven cases of bathroom locks, and four containers said to contain twenty-four thoroughbreds."|"Looking for a Ship"|"John McPhee"

03:00|"three in the morning"|"Mac is a youth of fifty-eight. Calvin is sixty-one. Yesterday, Calvin’s day began when he was called at three in the morning to prepare to stand what he describes as “my security watch with armed guards.” For four hours, he walked the deck with his transceiver, reporting to the bridge every twenty minutes, and expecting at any moment to be attacked by pirates and lashed to a turnbuckle, as his watch partner had been a few months before. At eight, he had breakfast. At nine, he turned to for deck maintenance, chipping and painting forward of the house. He greased the topping lifts on the No. 2 and No. 3 cranes. He tidied up the shelter deck. He painted the main deck around the jumbo crane. He second-coated the davits for the gangway port and starboard. This may not have been New York, but the Ecuadorian sun was hot. After lunch, he chipped and painted from one until four, when he resumed walking the foredeck, on patrol. As evening approached, he spent more than an hour crawling under catwalks between hatches to find electrical outlets in which to plug the cargo lights meant to keep pirates away. At 8 P.M., when the watch ended, he went into Guayaquil with the port agent and called North Carolina, in his concern over the health of his father-inlaw—“my wife’s daddy”—who is ninety-two years old and is in the hospital. He returned to the ship and fell into bed at midnight. At three, he was awakened for the four-to-eight watch. Now he stands at the wheel, worried more than ever about his wife’s daddy, looking for the moment almost ninety-two himself, paint-spattered from shirt to shoes, posture caving toward the letter S, a wire loose behind his hearing aid, his white cap no longer clean, his outsized bluejeans scuffing the deck. He admits defeat. He says, “I’m pretty well rest-broken now.”"|"Looking for a Ship"|"John McPhee"

06:00|"6 A.M."|"It is 6 A.M. in the Republic of the Equator. The twentieth of August. Sixty-eight degrees. The Woermann Wakamba is coming up the river. We will pass her port to port. She flies the flag of Panama and has a big white bone in her teeth. This large bow wave, spreading to the sides, is followed by another wave, some distance back. If you measure the length of the bow wave—the distance from the first wave to the second—you can tell how fast a ship is going. The distance in this case is two hundred and twenty-five feet. How do I know? I’m guessing. It’s a convenient guess,
because 1.1 times the square root of the length of the wave equals the speed of the ship in knots. The Woermann Wakamba is doing better than sixteen knots. She draws a big sea. Ships can make surf even at sixteen knots."|"Looking for a Ship"|"John McPhee"
16:00|"Four P.M."|"Four P.M., August 20th, sixty miles south of the equator, this is one lovely day: air temperature seventy-four, relative humidity sixty-nine per cent, sea temperature seventy-seven. The air is so brilliant that only Vernon McLaughlin and the radar see the dense piece of apparent sky that solidifies as we pass near it—a dry and silvery pastel island. Across the wheelhouse, the captain paces and frets—head down, eyes on the deck, his thoughts so concentrated on the next hazard of the voyage that his mood is unrelieved by the present weather. In part to Andy, in part to the ship, he addresses remarks about the low-draft channel into Buenaventura, where the ship has to maneuver as if it were skywriting and the word it spells is “lawsuit.”"|"Looking for a Ship"|"John McPhee"
04:00|"Four A.M."|"The four-to-eight ends. The four-to-eight begins. Four A.M. in the cashmere blackness. We have entered Colombian water. Intently, Andy leans over the radar plotter, a disk of suffused illumination on the otherwise dark bridge, working with his wax pencil. Calvin, the helmsman, is leaning over the plotter, too. Andy is designing an oak table. He is designing it for Calvin. At home in North Carolina, Calvin has four oak four-by-fours that he will turn into legs, and he says he wants a two-inch top. Andy recommends a one-inch top."|"Looking for a Ship"|"John McPhee"
04:00|"4 A.M."|"It could be said of our poor stowaways that they picked the wrong Merchant Marine, for in a sense their presence was betrayed more by the age of the ship than by any other factor. It is less than a day’s voyage from Buenaventura to Balboa. I imagine them relatively cool and confident at 4 A.M. that morning, successfully stowed away, feeling the ship’s great momentum as a venturous rush, up the dark Pacific. Not far away, in the engine room, David Carter has been checking the pumps, the generators, the air-conditioning. With Karl Knudsen, he has started to transfer fuel oil. He checks the pressures of the gland steam, of the high-pressure steam chest, of the high- and low-pressure bleeds. He checks the temperatures of the bearings (around a hundred and forty-five degrees), the temperature of the desuperheater outlet (five hundred and ninety-five degrees), the temperature of the main steam at the throttle (eight hundred and forty). He and Knudsen change a couple of
burners, noticing certain inconsistencies in the fuel-How apertures, which make no sense to them, so they study the boiler manual. They read it standing together, as if they were sharing a hymnal."|"Looking for a Ship"|"John McPhee"
00:00|midnight|"Over the bridge, a cloud of cinders leaves the stack, smudging, for the moment, the diamond colors of Sirius, the bright light of a full Venus. The air clears. The sword of Orion is studded with nebulas. The Pleiades hang like grapes. We have a big papaya on the bridge, and wedges of fresh lemon. This does not tempt Calvin. As an eater, he does not soar above all prejudices. Calvin, at the wheel, looks boneless and destroyed. He is again rest-broken, after another arduous day. Dawn arrives, and Mac, relieving Calvin, comes on angry. While still on the port watches that were set in Buenaventura, the ship sailed in late evening, and sea watches were not restored until midnight. This was a violation of a long nautical tradition: sea watches are set in the first minute of a day of departure, not the last. The core of Mac’s complaint is not that he worked eighteen hours and then went on lookout after three hours’ sleep. He is used to that. The core of his complaint is that no part of the effort was voluntary. “Your privilege has been taken away,” he explains, in a voice loud enough to go
through the steel deck. “Setting sea watches after you sail. Lord Nelson would roll over in his grave.” A slice of papaya helps Mac to calm down. Papaya is alkaline and very soothing. Papaya will pacify an incandescent stomach."|"Looking for a Ship"|"John McPhee"
