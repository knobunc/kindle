00:00|midnight|"Bourne told him what had transpired at the hotel, both before and after the massacre. As he finished, he put a mobile on the table. “El Ghadan gave this to me. Every day at midnight he will send me a short video of Soraya and Sonya, along with the day’s newspaper.”"|"The Bourne Ascendancy"|"Eric van Lustbader"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"“We have company,” Bourne said, and Zizzy nodded, not even bothering to query the acute left turn in the conversation. “At your four o’clock, corner table.”"|"The Bourne Ascendancy"|"Eric van Lustbader"
00:00|midnight|"He opened his eyes, anchored himself in the hotel room, in reality. As he sat up, he glanced at the mobile El Ghadan had given him. A message had come in while he was asleep.
At midnight, he had been dead to the world.
He watched the short video that had been sent him. He saw the newspaper’s date, then, as the paper was whipped away, Soraya and Sonya. Soraya looked dazed, her face sweat- and tear-streaked, haggard and careworn. The baby was crying. Then, all of a sudden, the sound switched on. He heard a rough, commanding voice, Soraya’s response, before she was cut off. Then the screen went black."|"The Bourne Ascendancy"|"Eric van Lustbader"
00:00|midnight|"“The proof of life came in at midnight,” he said, brandishing the mobile."|"The Bourne Ascendancy"|"Eric van Lustbader"
00:00|midnight|"El Ghadan’s mobile buzzed in Bourne’s pocket, reminding him that it was now midnight and with it would come another proof-of-life message. At least, he thought, continuing to move away from the factory, El Ghadan no longer knows where I am."|"The Bourne Ascendancy"|"Eric van Lustbader"
"ap < 09:00"|"just before 9"|"Finnerman nodded. “Look, we both know the Gravenhurst threat assessment is correct: Syria is the doorway to Iran, and whether we like it or not, Iran is the next stage in the war on terror. We neutralize Syria, we deprive Iran of one of its prime client nations in the spread of jihadism. We are taking this drastic step to ensure the security of the world—the security of our own country, which, according to Gravenhurst, has never been at higher risk, not even just before 9/11.”"|"The Bourne Ascendancy"|"Eric van Lustbader"
00:00|midnight|"Inside, it was darker than the city night outside. Gradually, as her eyes grew accustomed to the gloom, Sara realized they were walking down a passageway lit only by tiny, starlike LED bulbs randomly set into the black-painted ceiling. The walls, she saw as they neared the end of the passageway, were a patterned midnight-blue wallpaper."|"The Bourne Ascendancy"|"Eric van Lustbader"
00:00|midnight|"The lights in the diner shone off Terrier’s empty plate, with its last bits of lard-soaked crust. Outside, a monstrous midnight-blue ’72 Chrysler Imperial, in cherry condition, turned into the parking lot. Terrier raised a hand, called over the waitress, and ordered two coffees."|"The Bourne Ascendancy"|"Eric van Lustbader"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"It was after midnight. Clammy tendrils of fog, rising out of the water like a living creature, were driven onshore by an east wind. Up ahead, Camilla could see Blum silhouetted against the neon skyscrapers. Behind her, at a discreet distance, came the black SUV carrying El Ghadan, his driver, and two bodyguards."|"The Bourne Ascendancy"|"Eric van Lustbader"
00:00|midnight|"An electric atmosphere accompanied dinner. The knowledge that the cadre was going to move out at midnight had gripped everyone. It was a good night to begin their trek: Both moon and stars were hidden behind thick layers of clouds, dark, ominous, and heavy as metal. During dinner the wind off the mountains began to shriek like a creature in torment. Khan Abdali’s men ignored it, as did most of Borz’s Chechens, but Faraj and his cadre appeared ill at ease."|"The Bourne Ascendancy"|"Eric van Lustbader"
00:00|midnight|"The Arab and Chechen cadre moved out precisely at midnight. Black clouds roiled over their heads, fitful gusts of wind brought with them further hints of rain. The impending heavy weather actually bolstered their spirits, as the chances of their being spotted had been eliminated."|"The Bourne Ascendancy"|"Eric van Lustbader"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"Aashir nodded. Then he saw Bourne go completely still. “What is it?” he whispered.
“Third man,” Bourne said. “At your ten o’clock.”
“He’s been lying low.”"|"The Bourne Ascendancy"|"Eric van Lustbader"
00:00|midnight|"Hunter’s midnight-blue ’72 Chrysler Imperial barreled down the Virginia highway on its way to Dulles International Airport. The windows were open, the Imperial’s speed was redlining, and Hunter seemingly had no worries about being picked up by the highway patrol’s radar."|"The Bourne Ascendancy"|"Eric van Lustbader"
"< 12:00"|"just before midday"|"They made their destination just before midday. They sky was clear, the temperature elevated. The scouts hadn’t seen a soul. The blasted landscape they passed through was devoid of all life; they might as well have been treading on the dark side of the moon."|"The Bourne Ascendancy"|"Eric van Lustbader"
00:00|midnight|"At that moment, the clocks struck midnight and El Ghadan’s mobile buzzed. Raising his forefinger, Bourne stepped away. The usual short video of Soraya and Sonya had been sent to him, but a moment later a voice call came in."|"The Bourne Ascendancy"|"Eric van Lustbader"
00:00|midnight|"“Where are you?” El Ghadan said.
“You know where I am,” Bourne said. “It’s midnight in Singapore.”
“Yes, I know where you are.”"|"The Bourne Ascendancy"|"Eric van Lustbader"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"Magnus was one of those people who, having made up his mind about an issue or a person, could never be persuaded to change his opinion. Take Camilla, for instance. The moment he met her he had known he wanted her near him, and the job opening was a perfect way to legitimately get what he wanted. And when it was reported to him that she routinely stayed at her job until two or three in the morning, his mind was made up. Even before the fateful lunch that Anselm and Finnerman mistakenly assumed sealed the deal."|"The Bourne Ascendancy"|"Eric van Lustbader"
00:00|midnight|"Coming away from his vigil at the window, he returned to the living room sofa, where he had spent the latter part of the night going over the intelligence reports from the daily Eyes Only pouch delivered to him at midnight because of the distance and the time change. The pouch Anselm usually vetted first, for Anselm had established a habit of keeping a good deal of the daily intelligence chatter from him so that he would not be distracted from the important decisions on his plate."|"The Bourne Ascendancy"|"Eric van Lustbader"
00:00|midnight|"It had been agreed that the exchange would take place at midnight, on the causeway to the Pearl-Qatar. Bourne had set the time; El Ghadan had dictated the place. Begun in 2010, the Pearl-Qatar was a man-made paradise, an island almost a thousand acres in area, that was only possible to construct in the Middle East. Its hotels, marina, malls, and residential towers were still being finished."|"The Bourne Ascendancy"|"Eric van Lustbader"
00:00|midnight|"The wide, curving causeway, however, was complete. Apart from the two cars, at midnight it was completely deserted. Bourne, with Aashir beside him, sat behind the wheel of a rented silver Opel. On the other side of the apex of the curve crouched a large black SUV."|"The Bourne Ascendancy"|"Eric van Lustbader"
00:00|Midnight|"Behind the SUV, lights from finished structures pierced the night like comets. Here and there, the vague outlines of enormous yachts rose from the water like leviathans.
Midnight.
Over the curve, one of the doors of the SUV opened and Sara stepped out. It seemed like such a long time since Bourne had seen her. He was struck anew by her beauty, her courage, her presence, which seemed to make the lights over the causeway shimmer, as if they were standing on Bifröst, the rainbow bridge of Norse mythology that connected Earth to Asgard."|"The Bourne Ascendancy"|"Eric van Lustbader"
