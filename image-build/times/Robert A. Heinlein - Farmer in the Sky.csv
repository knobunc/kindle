I looked at them; they were both grinning, but I wasn’t. “I had an appointment for thirteen o’clock,” I said. “Since the doctor isn’t here, you can tell him I’ll phone for another appointment.” And I turned on my heel and left."|"Farmer in the Sky"|"Robert A.

07:30|"seven-thirty in the morning"|"We called a meeting. Peggy spread the word around for us, through the junior council, and we set it for fifteen-thirty that same afternoon, right after school. Fifteen-thirty Greenwich, or “A” deck time, that is. That made it seven-thirty in the morning for the “B” deck boys and a half hour before midnight for the fellows on “C” deck. It was the best we could do. “B” deck could hurry through breakfast and get to the meeting if they wanted to and we figured that those who were really interested from “C” would stay up for the meeting."|"Farmer in the Sky"|"Robert A.

"ap 03:30"|"three hours and a half"|"So here is the way a week goes on Ganymede: the Sun rises at Sunday midnight every week; when you get up Monday morning it’s a little above the eastern horizon and Jupiter is in half-moon phase. The Sun keeps climbing higher and about suppertime on Tuesday it slides behind Jupiter and Ganymede is in eclipse; eclipse can last an hour or so up to a maximum of about three hours and a half. The stars come out and Jupiter shows that beautiful red ring effect because of its thick atmosphere. Then it’s light again by bedtime Tuesday."|"Farmer in the Sky"|"Robert A. Heinlein"
12:00|noon|"At noon on Thursday the Sun goes down and we start the dark phase; that’s best of all. Jupiter’s colors really show and the other moons are easier to see. They can be almost anywhere and in almost any combination."|"Farmer in the Sky"|"Robert A. Heinlein"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"By six o’clock Saturday morning Jupiter would be in full phase and it was worthwhile to get up to see it. Not only was it the most gorgeous thing I had ever seen, but there was always the reverse eclipse, too, and you could see Ganymede’s shadow, a little round black dot, crawling across old Jupiter’s face. It gave you an idea of just how colossally big Jupiter was—there was the shadow of your whole planet on it and it wasn’t anything more than a big freckle."|"Farmer in the Sky"|"Robert A. Heinlein"
00:00|midnight|"For the next couple of days after full phase Jupiter would wane and at Sunday midnight it would be in half phase again, the Sun would rise and a new light phase would start. One thing I expected but didn’t find was dim sunlight. Jupiter is a long way out; it gets only one twenty-seventh the sunlight that Earth does. I expected that we would always be in a sort of twilight."|"Farmer in the Sky"|"Robert A. Heinlein"
12:00|noon|"By noon he was down to our place and had turned in. We had a bite to eat together, then he started in levelling a farm for me—five acres, the rest would have to wait. At that I was lucky for I was to get land to work months ahead of the original schedule. The second trip of the Mayflower had brought in three more crushers and very few immigrants, just enough to replace those who had given up and gone back out of our party, that being the compromise the town council had worked out with the Colonial Commission."|"Farmer in the Sky"|"Robert A. Heinlein"
"~ 00:00"|"About midnight"|"The racket was still worse when the crusher bit into hard rock, instead of lava, but it was music to me and I didn’t get tired of watching. Every bite was a piece of land to me. At suppertime the second-shift driver showed up with Dad. We watched together for a while, then Dad went back to town. I stayed. About midnight I went over into a stretch that was not to be processed now, found a big rock to keep the Sun out of my eyes and lay down for a quick nap."|"Farmer in the Sky"|"Robert A. Heinlein"
"~ 12:00"|"Around noon"|"When that was done and cairns had been set to show where the strips ran, we raked the stuff into the rock dust five or six feet on each side of each line.

06:00|"eighteen o’clock that afternoon"|"By eighteen o’clock that afternoon the roof was on and we had a house. The door wasn’t hung; it was still down at the ’Change. And the power unit wasn’t in and might not be for a week. But we had a house that would keep off the rain, and a pint-sized cow barn as well, even if I didn’t own a cow."|"Farmer in the Sky"|"Robert A. Heinlein"

And don’t worry about the price of the glass; we’ll get it free—a spot of cumshaw coming to your old man for designing the glass works. ‘The kine who tread the grain,’”he quoted. “Now you and I had better get busy; there is a rain scheduled for fifteen o’clock.”"|"Farmer in the Sky"|"Robert A.

"~ 22:00"|"About twenty-two o’clock"|"They wouldn’t let me. It was seventy below outside and still dropping.
About twenty-two o’clock the lights came on and the worst was over.
We had a decent meal soon after that, sandwiches and soup, and when the Sun came up at midnight they announced that anybody could go outside who cared to risk it. I waited until noon Monday.

"ap ~ 05:00"|"about five o’clock"|"That was one of the few chances I got to look around. You see, we had landed at sunrise—about five o’clock Wednesday morning sunrise was, in that longitude—and the object was to get as much done as possible during each light phase. Jupiter light is all right for working in your own fields, but no good for surveying strange territory—and here we didn’t even have Jupiter light—just Callisto, every other dark phase, every twelve-and-half days, to be exact. Consequently we worked straight through light phase, on pep pills."|"Farmer in the Sky"|"Robert A. Heinlein"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"But Hank and I decided to explore off that way and see if we could find more of it. Besides it was away from the way we had come from camp number one. We didn’t tell Paul we were going after lichen because we were afraid he would veto it; the stuff had been found quite some distance from camp. He had warned us not to go too far and to be back by six o’clock Thursday morning, in time to break camp and head back to our landing point, where the Jitterbug was to meet us."|"Farmer in the Sky"|"Robert A.
