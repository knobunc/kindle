"ap 00:30"|"half of one"|"Sitting at Prim’s knees, guarding her,
is the world’s ugliest cat. Mashed-in nose, half of one ear missing, eyes the
color of rotting squash. Prim named him Buttercup, insisting that his muddy
yellow coat matched the bright flower. I le hates me. Or at least distrusts me.
Even though it was years ago, I think he still remembers how I tried to drown
him in a bucket when Prim brought him home. Scrawny kitten, belly swollen with
worms, crawling with fleas. The last thing I needed was another mouth to feed.
But Prim begged so hard, cried even, I had to let him stay. It turned out okay.
My mother got rid of the vermin and he’s a born mouser. Even catches the occasional
rat. Sometimes, when I clean a kill, I feed Buttercup the entrails. He has
stopped hissing at me."|"The Hunger Games"|"Suzanne Collins"
"ap 02:00"|two|"Our part of District 12, nicknamed the
Seam, is usually crawling with coal miners heading out to the morning shift at
this hour. Men and women with hunched shoulders, swollen knuckles, many who
have long since stopped trying to scrub the coal dust out of their broken
nails, the lines of their sunken faces. But today the black cinder streets are
empty. Shutters on the squat gray houses are closed. The reaping isn’t until
two. May as well sleep in. If you can."|"The Hunger Games"|"Suzanne Collins"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"Gale spreads the bread slices with the
soft goat cheese, carefully placing a basil leaf on each while I strip the
bushes of their berries. We settle back in a nook in the rocks. From this
place, we are invisible but have a clear view of the valley, which is teeming
with summer life, greens to gather, roots to dig, fish iridescent in the
sunlight. The day is glorious, with a blue sky and soft breeze. The food’s
wonderful, with the cheese seeping into the warm bread and the berries bursting
in our mouths. Everything would be perfect if this really was a holiday, if all
the day off meant was roaming the mountains with Gale, hunting for tonight’s
supper. But instead we have to be standing in the square at two o’clock waiting
for the names to be called out."|"The Hunger Games"|"Suzanne Collins"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"At one o’clock, we head for the square.
Attendance is mandatory unless you are on death’s door. This evening, officials
will come around and check to see if this is the case. If not, you’ll be
imprisoned."|"The Hunger Games"|"Suzanne Collins"
"ap 02:00"|two|"Just as the town clock strikes two, the
mayor steps up to the podium and begins to read. It’s the same story every
year. He tells of the history of Panem, the country that rose up out of the
ashes of a place that was once called North America. He lists the disasters,
the droughts, the storms, the fires, the encroaching seas that swallowed up so
much of the land, the brutal war for what little sustenance remained. The
result was Panem, a shining Capitol ringed by thirteen districts, which brought
peace and prosperity to its citizens. Then came the Dark Days, the uprising of
the districts against the Capitol. Twelve were defeated, the thirteenth
obliterated. The Treaty of Treason gave us the new laws to guarantee peace and,
as our yearly reminder that the Dark Days must never be repeated, it gave us
the Hunger Games."|"The Hunger Games"|"Suzanne Collins"
"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"Pulling on my robe, I follow him through
a door into a sitting room. Two red couches face off over a low table. Three
walls are blank, the fourth is entirely glass, providing a window to the city.
I can see by the light that it must be around noon, although the sunny sky has
turned overcast. Cinna invites me to sit on one of the couches and takes his
place across from me. He presses a button on the side of the table. The top
splits and from below rises a second tabletop that holds our lunch. Chicken and
chunks of oranges cooked in a creamy sauce laid on a bed of pearly white grain,
tiny green peas and onions, rolls shaped like flowers, and for dessert, a
pudding the color of honey."|"The Hunger Games"|"Suzanne Collins"
"ap < 10:00"|"almost ten"|"It’s almost ten. I clean my teeth and
smooth back my hair again. Anger temporarily blocked out my nervousness about
meeting the other tributes, but now I can feel my anxiety rising again. By the
time I meet Effie and Peeta at the elevator, I catch myself biting my nails. I
stop at once."|"The Hunger Games"|"Suzanne Collins"
"ap 01:00"|1|"The exceptions are the kids from the
wealthier districts, the volunteers, the ones who have been fed and trained
throughout their lives for this moment. The tributes from 1, 2, and 4
traditionally have this look about them. It’s technically against the rules to
train tributes before they reach the Capitol but it happens every year. In
District 12, we call them the Career Tributes, or just the Careers. And like as
not, the winner will be one of them."|"The Hunger Games"|"Suzanne Collins"
"ap 09:52"|eight-to-ten|"After dinner, we go to sitting room to
watch the scores announced on television. First they show a photo of the tribute,
then flash their score below it. The Career Tributes naturally get in the
eight-to-ten range. Most of the other players average a five. Surprisingly,
little Rue comes up with a seven. I don’t know what she showed the judges, but
she’s so tiny it must have been impressive."|"The Hunger Games"|"Suzanne Collins"
00:00|midnight|"Caesar Flickerman, the man who has
hosted the interviews for more than forty years, bounces onto the stage. It’s a
little scary because his appearance has been virtually unchanged during all
that time. Same face under a coating of pure white makeup. Same hairstyle that
he dyes a different color for each Hunger Games. Same ceremonial suit, midnight
blue dotted with a thousand tiny electric bulbs that twinkle like stars. They
do surgery in the Capitol, to make people appear younger and thinner. In
District 12, looking old is something of an achievement since so many people
die early. You see an elderly person you want to congratulate them on their
longevity, ask the secret of survival. A plump person is envied because they
aren’t scraping by like the majority of us. But here it is different. Wrinkles
aren’t desirable. A round belly isn’t a sign of success."|"The Hunger Games"|"Suzanne Collins"
12:00|midday|"When I reach the site of our first
meeting, I feel certain it’s been undisturbed. There’s no sign of Rue, not on
the ground or in the trees. This is odd. By now she should have returned, as it’s
midday. Undoubtedly, she spent the night in a tree somewhere. What else could
she do with no light and the Careers with their night-vision glasses tramping
around the woods. And the third fire she was supposed to set — although I
forgot to check for it last night — was the farthest from our site of all. She’s
probably just being cautious about making her way back. I wish she’d hurry, because
I don’t want to hang around here too long. I want to spend the afternoon
traveling to higher ground, hunting as we go. But there’s nothing really for me
to do but wait."|"The Hunger Games"|"Suzanne Collins"
