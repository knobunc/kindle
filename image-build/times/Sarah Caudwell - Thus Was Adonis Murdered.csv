"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"If, at eleven o’clock on a weekday morning, you leave the Public Record Office, turn right down Chancery Lane and continue past the Silver Vaults to the nearest coffee house, you will generally find gathered there (professional obligations and their Clerk permitting) the junior members of 62 New Square. They are a decorative little group—it would be a difficult taste that was pleased by none of them. Between Ragwort and Cantrip there are certain points of resemblance: they are the same age; of similar height; both thin; both very pale. But it is for those whose pleasure lies in the conquest of virtue that Ragwort’s delicate profile and demure autumnal colouring have a most particular charm. Cantrip, in sharp contrast, has eyes and hair of a witchlike blackness, more pleasing to those whose preference is for a savour of iniquity. Selena—I can think of no especially striking feature by which you might distinguish Selena from any other pretty woman in her middle twenties, average in height and roundness of figure, with hair an inconstant shade of blonde; I mean, until she speaks: for her voice is unmistakable, smooth and persuasive, the envy of rival advocates. But until then—well, if you can imagine a Persian cat which has just completed a successful cross-examination, that will give you some idea of her. Timothy, my former pupil, being by some two or three years the senior in call to the Bar, is detained more often than not by the claims of his profession and was absent on the morning of which I write—there is little point, therefore, in my describing him."|"Thus Was Adonis Murdered"|"Sarah Caudwell"

My secluded corner of the terrace has been taken over for the purpose of an assignation. I am left exposed to enquiry from all the tourists who pass to and fro in the lobby of the Cytherea and for some reason look on me as a likely source of information: three large German matrons, wearing identical straw hats, have asked me the way to the ladies’; an earnest young Englishman has asked me to point out the house where Byron lived; a party of French schoolgirls have asked me which vaporetto will take them to the Lido. I have responded sympathetically, if not accurately, to all these enquiries. You will therefore forgive, I hope, the disjointedness of my narrative."|"Thus Was Adonis Murdered"|"Sarah Caudwell"

She had accompanied Julia to the police station and had remained with her while she was questioned by the Vice-Quaestor—that is the title of the officer in charge of the case.

It may, indeed, be not altogether misleading: I have heard it said that he had to work quite hard for his First in Economics—well, that may be mere malice; but there is no doubt that in the year he obtained his Fellowship of the College of All Souls the competition was unusually weak. Still, whatever reservations one may have about his intellectual capacity, if one wants to know anything about the world of art and objects, Benjamin is the man to ask.
