The purpose of the long delay was to allow the sand to harden as much as possible before a similar sleeper track was laid from the cliffs – otherwise the sleepers were likely to sink into the sand under their own weight. This was the really difficult job. The giant cast-iron beam weighed eighteen tons – two and a half times as much as the boiler. A larger timber frame was now being brought along this second pathway of sleepers, with rollers to lay over the sleepers as before. This was altogether too heavy a job for men, and a double team of twelve horses – six a side – waited in harness to pull the makeshift trolley back along the track. Trolley and frame had been left until the last moment so that the minimum weight rested on the sleepers. A score of extra men with sacks, shovels and levers waited alongside to help in case of mishap."|"The Miller's Dance"|"Winston Graham"

But high noon had lasted too short a time: in five years Elizabeth was dead in childbirth and George, just become a knight bachelor, could no longer bear the sight of the house; it was occupied by Elizabeth’s parents until they died, then the best of the new furniture was moved to George’s other home at Cardew, and Trenwith left to the untender mercies of the Harry brothers and their one slatternly wife, who lived in the lodge house and intimidated the neighbourhood with their brutish ways.

Then, talking, explaining, she gracefully led the way upstairs, her skirt lapping at each step. Mr Pope, it seemed, had had severe pain this morning early. He had wakened her, but just when they had been about to send for the apothecary the pains had eased. Mr Nat Irby had called at eleven and had made light of the occurrence, but Mr Pope, having heard a good account of Dr Enys’s wide physical experience, had thought it desirable to call him in."|"The Miller's Dance"|"Winston Graham"

The first was Stephen Carrington, the second Music Thomas, the oddest of the three odd bachelor brothers who lived next to Jud and Prudie Paynter in Grambler. Music worked part time, or as much time as he was allowed to, as a stable-boy at Place House.

It was the first ceremony at which Mr Odgers had ever consented to appear on the same platform as Sam, for he looked on Wesleyanism as a foreign and infidel faith only a degree less deadly than Catholicism. But Ross, who would have been quite agreeable to the shortest possible opening ceremony, and an entirely secular one at that, knew that his workforce would not be happy without the blessing of both church and chapel, any more than they would without the upturned horseshoe nailed over the door.

Wilf Jonas, who was expecting him to start work on the following Monday at seven a.m., found himself without his assistant. Clowance told the first lie she had ever told her parents when she informed them that she didn’t know where Stephen was.

12:00|noon|"George Warleggan and Harriet Carter were united in Holy matrimony at noon on the 1st May, 1812, in the church of Breage, near Helston. Sir Christopher Hawkins gave the bride away. The Reverend Richard Knava, who happened to be Vicar of Luxulyan thirty-five miles away, but held also the benefices of Breage, Germoe, Cury and Gunwalloe, performed the ceremony. He was a portly man and a second cousin of the bride, and did well out of his five livings. A wedding breakfast was held at Godolphin Hall. Harriet’s aunt, Miss Darcy, had been persuaded to relax her disapproval of the marriage for long enough for the guests to be entertained and for the meal to be taken. The Duke and Duchess of Leeds, brother and sister-in-law of the bride, had not travelled from London to attend the nuptials.

In two hours it would be dark. They would probably arrive at Cardew about eight. Then it would be at least four hours after that before they had bathed, changed, supped and climbed the stairs again. Roughly, one might estimate, five hours from now! He looked at her and wondered if her legs really were rather thick, as he had long suspected. Not pale and very slim like Elizabeth’s, but probably dark-skinned and over-heavy below the knee. He did not mind.
