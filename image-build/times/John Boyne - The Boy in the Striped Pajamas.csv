19:34|"nineteen thirty-four"|"Shmuel thought about it and looked down at his fingers and they wiggled in the air, as if he was trying to calculate. 'I'm nine,' he said. 'My birthday is April the fifteenth nineteen thirty-four.'"|"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"|"John Boyne"
19:34|"nineteen thirty-four"|"Bruno stared at him in surprise. 'What did you say?' he asked.
