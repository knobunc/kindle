"ap 09:00"|"nine o'clock"|"Suddenly he felt very proud. He'd report the find, and be on the nine o'clock news. He could hear the newsreader's voice."|"The Machine Gunners"|"Robert Westall"
"ap 09:00"|nine-o'clock|"He thought his mother would be angry at him for having wasted a good breakfast when food was hard to get. Then he heard the nine-o'clock hooter. Everyone set their watches by the factory hooters. They went at seven and eight and twelve and five. But this one, a little silly warbly one, went at nine. Chas knew it well, because it told him if he was late for school."|"The Machine Gunners"|"Robert Westall"

"ap 10:30"|"half past ten"|"School! School was half past ten, and he had to get home and change into uniform. He must hurry. He scurried off through the brambles without a backward look."|"The Machine Gunners"|"Robert Westall"
"ap 04:00"|"four o'clock"|"By four o'clock, Boddser was outside the Head's door, sweating. By five, he had been given six of the best. By half past five, the police were at his mother's door with a search warrant."|"The Machine Gunners"|"Robert Westall"

"ap 09:58"|two-till-ten|"The next Wednesday evening started quite well. Mr. McGill was on the two-till-ten shift, so there were only Chas and his mum for tea. But Cousin Gordon called, on leave again, bright in brass and airforce blue. He was carrying his rifle, because he had to be ready to Defend Britain Against Invasion at any time, and because Aunt Rose said she wouldn't have the great greasy murderous thing around her house while he was out."|"The Machine Gunners"|"Robert Westall"
"ap ~ 10:00"|"Around ten"|"Around ten, the all-clear went. Nothing had happened but two showers of rain, and long before the end, you could hear people standing chatting by their shelter doors."|"The Machine Gunners"|"Robert Westall"
"ap 03:00"|"three o'clock"|"At three o'clock, men came with a van for the furniture. It was going, Dad said, to the Repository. Chas thought the word had a sinister sound, like Mortuary or Infirmary, but he didn't say so."|"The Machine Gunners"|"Robert Westall"
"ap 03:10"|"ten past three"|"At ten past three, a taxi for Nana and Granda arrived at the end of the road. Nana and Granda were coming to live at the Square. Chas had lost his bedroom. He would sleep on the settee in the Front Room, with the mysteries of chiming clock, wedding photographs and mothballs. He didn't mind. He was much more interested in that helmet. If no one remembered it..."|"The Machine Gunners"|"Robert Westall"
"ap 04:00"|"four o'clock"|"Boddser had come down in the world since the fight. For a start, his mother kept him off school a whole week; and then began calling at school for him every day at four o'clock in case the ""big rough boys"" got him again. She went on and on to everyone who would listen about the amount of bullying that went on at Garmouth High School. But one or two people had told her a few home truths about her darling's arm-twisting, so it was doubtful if she even knew herself whether she was guarding Boddser from the World, or the World from Boddser."|"The Machine Gunners"|"Robert Westall"
"ap 04:00"|"four o'clock"|"""What are you doing, Benjamin?"" The new voice was haughty, but rather wobbly. A tall thin woman was standing in the doorway with a glass in her hand. Chas thought she looked like a film star gone wrong. She was still wearing her dressing gown, though it was just four o'clock. There were stains down the front; they could have been tea or marmalade."|"The Machine Gunners"|"Robert Westall"
"ap 01:30"|"half past one"|"Nicky wakened with a start. He switched on his bedside light. His alarm clock said half past one. Why had he wakened? He slept till morning usually; sleep was a refuge."|"The Machine Gunners"|"Robert Westall"
"ap 05:00"|"Five o'clock"|"Frost lay on the branches, and froze Clogger's breath on the eyepiece of the telescope. He wiped it angrily with his glove. But it was impossible to be really unhappy on such an evening. The sky was a dimming blue from horizon to horizon. The January evenings were beginning to draw out. Clogger consulted the gold watch-and-chain that the lookouts always carried in their top pockets. Five o'clock. Fifteen minutes more in the Crow's Nest. He scanned the horizon with the telescope again. He was shivering so much that the horizon jumped around like a kangaroo."|"The Machine Gunners"|"Robert Westall"

18:00|"1800 hours"|"""Hello, old chap. What's all this Blue Flash lark then?"" The hair on the back of Stan's neck prickled. Why didn't RN Blyth know the password? The smooth voice at the far end droned on, ""Blue Flash was last week, old son! Password's 'Red Sun' this week. It's Sunday night, you know. Password changes 1800 hours Sunday."" The voice spoke perfect English, superior, sneery. Too perfect English? Like Lord Haw-Haw?"|"The Machine Gunners"|"Robert Westall"
