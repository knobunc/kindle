"ap < 11:00"|"almost eleven"|"He had heard it all before, but tolerantly let me grumble on. Anne brought us coffee, and we talked until almost eleven. I should have been happy to stay longer, but, guessing what little time the two of them must get alone together, I at last said good night. Their house is just on the other side of the village from mine, a ten-minute walk away; the evening was still so warm and airless, I went slowly, by a roundabout route, pausing once to light a cigarette, then slipping off my jacket, loosening my tie, and going on in my shirt-sleeves."|"The Little Stranger"|"Sarah Waters"
"ap 07:30"|"half past seven"|"Then, one evening at the end of August—more than a month, in other words, since I had gone out to treat Betty—I was driving along one of the lanes outside Lidcote and caught sight of a large black dog sniffing around in the dust. It must have been half past seven or so. The sun was still quite high in the sky, but the sky itself was beginning to pink; I’d finished my evening surgery and was on my way to visit a patient in one of the neighbouring villages. The dog started barking when he heard my car, and as he put up his head and moved forward I saw the grey in his fur, and recognised him as the elderly Hundreds Labrador, Gyp. A second later I saw Caroline. She was right at the edge of the lane, on the shadowy side. Hatless and bare-legged, she was reaching into one of the hedges—had managed to work her way into the brambles so completely that without Gyp to alert me I would have driven past without spotting her. Drawing closer, I saw her call for the dog to be quiet; she turned her head to my car, narrowing her eyes against what must have been the glare of the windscreen. I noticed then that she had the strap of a satchel over her breast, and was carrying what I took to be an old spotted handkerchief, done up as a bundle like Dick Whittington’s. Drawing level with her, I put on the brake and called through my open window."|"The Little Stranger"|"Sarah Waters"
12:00|midday|"But it was clear what she meant, and the obviousness of her embarrassment only served to embarrass me. The road we had taken, too, was one I remembered going up and down as a boy at just about this time of year—carrying out the midday ‘snap’ of bread and cheese to my mother’s brothers as they helped with the Hundreds harvest. No doubt those men would have been very tickled to think that, thirty years on, a qualified doctor, I would be driving up that same road in my own car with the squire’s daughter at my side. But I felt overcome suddenly with an absurd sense of gaucheness, and falseness—as if, had my plain labourer uncles actually appeared before me now, they would have seen me for the fraud I was, and laughed at me."|"The Little Stranger"|"Sarah Waters"
06:00|"six this morning"|"At once, he made an effort to sit straighter. ‘I’m all right. I was up at six this morning, that’s all, for the milking.

"~ 20:07"|"about twenty-seven"|"Mrs Baker-Hyde’s brother, Mr Morley, I rather took against from the start. He was, I guessed, about twenty-seven; he had smarmed-down hair and rimless American glasses, and he managed to let us all know quite quickly that he worked for a London advertising agency, but was just beginning to make a name for himself in the film industry by ‘writing treatments’. He didn’t, for our benefit, elaborate on what a treatment was, and Mr Rossiter, mishearing the end of the conversation, supposed that he must, like me, be a medical man, which led to a confused few minutes. Mr Morley laughed tolerantly at the mistake. I saw him, as he sipped at his cocktail, looking me over and dismissing me; I saw him dismiss the whole bunch of us, before ten minutes had passed. Mrs Ayres, however, as hostess, seemed determined to make him welcome. ‘You must meet the Desmonds, Mr Morley,’ I heard her say, as she drew him from one small group to another. And then, when he had drifted back to stand at the fireplace with Mr Rossiter and me: ‘You gentlemen over here must sit down … You too, Mr Morley.’"|"The Little Stranger"|"Sarah Waters"

I thought it fair enough that the Baker-Hydes should have brought him in: he was their doctor, after all. But it is always awkward for the practitioners concerned when a patient makes a decision like that without informing them. Some sort of butler or secretary showed me into the house, and I found Seeley just coming down from the girl’s bedroom. He was a tall, well-built man, looking larger than ever on the narrow sixteenth-century staircase.

After all, if he can do other things—if he can open doors and move furniture about, and get himself injured; if he can come up to my room at three o’clock in the morning to ask me to stop moving furniture!—then couldn’t he also do something like this?’ She glanced at the door, and lowered her voice. ‘And if he can do this, Doctor, well, what else might he do?’"|"The Little Stranger"|"Sarah Waters"
"ap ~ 05:00"|"about five o’clock"|"But I stayed puzzling over Roderick’s condition for the next few days; and it must have been on an afternoon early in the following week that the whole thing at last came together—or, depending on how one looks at it, fell apart. I was driving back through Lidcote at about five o’clock, and was surprised to see Rod himself, on the High Street. His presence there would once have been unremarkable, for in the old days he often used to come in on farming business. But, as Caroline had said, he rarely left Hundreds now, and though he still looked very much the young country squire, in an overcoat and tweed cap and with the strap of a leather satchel across his breast, there was something unmistakably burdened and ill at ease about him—about the way he walked, with his collar turned up, and his shoulders hunched, as if against more than the chill November breezes. When I drew up across the street from him to wind down my window and call his name, he turned to me with a startled expression; and just for a second—I could have sworn it—he looked like a frightened, hunted man."|"The Little Stranger"|"Sarah Waters"
"ap > 08:00"|"past eight o’clock"|"He had, as I knew, been dubious about the party from the start. He hadn’t liked the sound of the Baker-Hydes, he said; he was uncomfortable with the idea of playing ‘master of the house’, and he felt a fool about putting on evening clothes, which he hadn’t worn in about three years. But he’d gone along with it all for Caroline’s sake, and to please his mother. On the evening in question he really had been delayed at the farm, though he knew that everyone would suppose he’d ‘simply been dawdling’. He’d been kept there by a piece of failing machinery, for just as Makins had been predicting for weeks, the Hundreds pump had looked like it was finally about to blow, and leaving the farm to deal with the problem without help was out of the question. Rod knew as much about things like that as any mechanic, thanks to his time in the RAF; he and Makins’s son patched up the pump and kept it working, but it took until well past eight o’clock. By the time he had crossed the park and was hurriedly letting himself back into the Hall by the garden door, the Baker-Hydes and Mr Morley were already arriving at the front. He was still in his farm clothes, and filthy with dust and grease. He didn’t think he had time enough to go upstairs and have a proper wash in the family bathroom; he thought he’d make do with hot water in the bowl of his washing-stand. He rang for Betty, but she was busy with the guests in the saloon. He waited, then rang again; then finally went down to the kitchen to fetch the water himself."|"The Little Stranger"|"Sarah Waters"
"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"Outside, the weather was still filthy, and seemed to whip up my mood. The upset and anger grew on me as I drove home—so that I drove badly, clashing the gears, once taking a curve too sharply and very nearly running the car off the road. In an effort to calm myself down I worked on various bills and papers until well past midnight; but when I finally went to bed I lay fretful—almost hoping for a call to a patient, to take my mind away from the snag of my own thoughts."|"The Little Stranger"|"Sarah Waters"
"<< 00:00"|"well before midnight"|"She made sure he was well covered with blankets before she left him, and she went to the fire, drew back the mesh guard, and added more wood. She closed the guard again when she had finished, she was later quite certain of that; and she was equally certain that no cigarettes were burning in any of the ashtrays, and that no lamps or candles were lit. She returned to the little parlour, where she spent another half-hour with her mother. They went to bed well before midnight; Caroline read for ten or fifteen minutes before putting out her light; and she fell asleep almost at once."|"The Little Stranger"|"Sarah Waters"
"ap ~ 03:30"|"around half past three"|"She was woken a few hours later—around half past three, as it turned out—by the faint but distinctive sound of breaking glass. The sound came from just below her own windows—that is, from one of the windows of her brother’s room. Startled, she sat up in bed. She assumed that Rod had woken and was blundering about, and her one thought was to prevent him from coming upstairs and disturbing their mother. She got wearily to her feet and put on her dressing-gown; she was just nerving herself up to go downstairs and deal with him when it occurred to her that the sound might not have been made by her brother at all, but might have come from a burglar trying to force a way into the house. Perhaps she was remembering Rod’s words about pirates and cutlasses. Anyway, she went softly across to her window, put back the curtain, and looked out. She saw the garden bathed in a leaping yellow light, and smelt smoke—and realised that the house was on fire."|"The Little Stranger"|"Sarah Waters"
"ap ~ 01:00"|"about one"|"I gave him the latest report I’d had from Dr Warren. We passed from that to exchanging news about one or two of our other patients, and from that to a discussion, with the Stratford man, of the forthcoming Health Service. The Stratford man, like most GPs, was violently opposed to it; David Graham was passionately for it, while I was still gloomily convinced it would mean the end of my career, so the debate was pretty lively and went on for some time. Every so often I’d lift my head and look for Caroline on the dance-floor. Now and then she and Brenda returned to the table for more wine."|"The Little Stranger"|"Sarah Waters"
"ap 11:30"|"half past eleven"|"Then, at half past eleven or so, someone got hold of the microphone to announce a Paul Jones, and there was a general migration to the dance-floor which Graham and I were persuaded to join. Automatically I looked for Caroline again, and saw her being pulled into the women’s circle on the other side of the hall; after that I kept my eye on her, hoping to coincide with her at the breaks of music. But with every reshuffle we’d go galloping towards each other, only to be helplessly tugged away in opposite directions. The ring of women, swollen with nurses, was fuller than the ring of men: I saw her smile and almost stumble as her feet tangled with the other girls’ and, once as she flew past me, she caught my eye and grimaced. ‘This is murder!’ I think she called. The next time she came she was laughing. Her loose hair had fallen forwards and was clinging in darkening strands to the sheen of perspiration on her face and lips. At last she finished a place or two to my left, and in the polite but determined jostling that followed I moved to claim her—only to be beaten to her side by a large, damp, hot-looking man I recognised, after a second, as Jim Seeley. He was, I think, her rightful partner in the ring, but she gave me an alarmed, comical look as he drew her into a close embrace, then led her off in a slow foxtrot with his chin against her ear."|"The Little Stranger"|"Sarah Waters"
02:00|"two in the chill night"|"He blinked, and turned; and I moved away from him, finding an awkward, interrupted route around the tables and chairs. I was heading for the door, meaning to stand for a minute or two in the chill night air. But as I went, I passed close to the table I had been sharing with the Grahams, and the Stratford couple, seeing me going by with such a fixed expression, naturally assumed I’d lost my way back to my seat, and called out to me. They looked so pleased by my return—the wife walked with a cane, and was kept from the dancing—that I hadn’t the heart to press on, but rejoined their table, and stayed talking to them, then, for the rest of the night. What we talked about, I have no idea. I was so thrown by what Seeley had said, and in such a mixture of ways, I could hardly sort out my own feelings."|"The Little Stranger"|"Sarah Waters"
"ap > 01:00"|"just after one"|"Finally, at just after one, when the music had finished and the lights had come up, she reappeared at the table. She came with Brenda, both of them fresh from the dance-floor, with blurred eyes and mouths. She stood a couple of feet away from me, yawning, and plucking at the bodice of her dress to free it from the tug of moist skin beneath, exposing an edge of brassière strap at her armpit—exposing the armpit itself, a muscular hollow shadowed with fine stubble and faintly streaked with talcum. And though I had longed for her return, when she met my gaze and smiled, I felt, unaccountably, the sting of something that was almost anger, and had to turn away from her. I told her, rather stiffly, that I would fetch our things from the cloakroom, and she and Brenda went off again to the Ladies’. When they came back, still yawning, I was relieved to see that she had tidied her hair and made a neat, conventional mask of her face and throat with lipstick and powder."|"The Little Stranger"|"Sarah Waters"

02:00|"two o’clock in the morning"|"Had she meant it, when she’d talked of sitting, smoking cigarettes? Had I, in picturing this place, somehow forgotten that it was two o’clock in the morning? With the fading of the headlamps that came when I turned off the engine, there was nothing to be seen of the pond, the grass, the circling rushes. We might have been anywhere, or nowhere at all. Only the hush was as I’d imagined it: a hush so deep it seemed to magnify every sound that broke it, so that I was unnaturally aware of the movement of Caroline’s breath, of the tightening and unclenching of her throat as she swallowed, of the unsticking of her tongue and palate as she slightly opened her mouth. For a minute, perhaps longer, we sat with no more motion between us than that, I with my hands on the steering-wheel, she with her arm out to the dashboard as if still bracing herself against jars."|"The Little Stranger"|"Sarah Waters"
"ap ~ 02:45"|"about a quarter to three"|"She lay awake for the rest of that night, unsettled and wary, but the house stayed silent. The next night she went to bed early, and slept without much difficulty. On the night after that, however, she was again woken, and in exactly the same way as before. This time she went around the landing and woke Betty, and had her return with her and stand listening at the dressing-room door. It was about a quarter to three. Betty said she heard ‘something, she wasn’t sure what’; but again, when they nerved themselves up to look inside the little room, they found it lifeless … It then occurred to Mrs Ayres that her first instinct must have been right. She could not have imagined the sounds, they were too distinct for that; the bird must be inside the chimney itself, just behind the breast of it, unable to find its way back up the flue. The thought took hold of her, horribly. It was made all the worse, I suppose, by the lateness of the hour, by the stillness and the dark. She sent Betty back to her bed but again lay awake, upset and frustrated, and by the time Caroline went in to see her next morning she was already up, and back in the dressing-room; she was down on her knees in front of the hearth, prising with a poker at the rusted chimney-flap."|"The Little Stranger"|"Sarah Waters"

The next time I visited, however, I learned that another call had come, again around half past two, a night or two before. Caroline had left the telephone to ring this time, lying in bed, unwilling to get up in the cold and the darkness. But at last its hard, hectic clamour had been too much to ignore and, hearing her mother stirring in her room, she had gone down and picked up the receiver—only to find that, as usual, the line was dead."|"The Little Stranger"|"Sarah Waters"

Life at the house had reached a point where it seemed to me that, in my absence, absolutely anything might happen. But when I stepped into the hall at around eight o’clock I found Caroline coming downstairs to greet me, looking tired, but with reassuring touches of life and colour in her cheeks.

"ap 08:40"|"twenty to nine"|"The snow lay smooth as foam there, almost silky to the eye, but crisp and powdery underfoot. In places it was broken by the cartoonish tracks of birds, and soon we found more substantial prints, the dog-like pads and claws of creeping foxes. We followed those for a minute or two; they led us over to the old outbuildings. There the air of general enchantment was even more pronounced, the stable clock still fixed at twenty to nine in that grim Dickensian joke, the stables themselves with their fittings all in place, their doors neatly bolted, but everything thick with cobwebs and dust, so that one half expected, on peeping inside, to find a line of slumbering horses, all thick with cobwebs, too. Beside the stables was the garage, with the bonnet of the family Rolls-Royce just showing at its half-open door. Beyond that was a chaos of bushes, and the fox tracks were lost to us. But our walk had taken us almost as far as the old kitchen gardens, so, still idly, we moved on, passing through the arch in the high brick wall to the plots beyond."|"The Little Stranger"|"Sarah Waters"

"< 00:00"|"just before midnight"|"I got through my hours at the hospital in a state of distraction, and when I drove home, at just before midnight, I was still unhappy. As if the thought of Caroline and her mother were exerting some sort of magnetic pull over me, I inadvertently took the turning away from Lidcote, and was a mile along the Hundreds road before I saw what I had done. The weird pallor of the snowy landscape only added to my unease. I felt odd and conspicuous in my black car. For a moment I actually considered carrying on, going out to the Hall; then I realised that to upset the house by arriving late like that would do no good to anyone. So I turned the car around—looking across the bleached fields as I did it, as if searching for a light or some other impossible signal from Hundreds that all was well."|"The Little Stranger"|"Sarah Waters"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"She had sat with her mother the day before, it seemed, just as I’d instructed. First she had read aloud to her; then, when Mrs Ayres had begun to doze, she’d put the book aside and had Betty bring her her sewing. They had sat together like that, companionably, until seven o’clock, when Mrs Ayres went alone to the bathroom. Caroline didn’t think she could very well accompany her there, and in fact her mother reappeared, having washed her hands and face, looking ‘rather brighter’ than before; she even insisted on changing her clothes, putting on a smarter gown for dinner. They took the meal in the little parlour, as they usually did these days. Mrs Ayres’s appetite seemed good. Made wary and anxious by me, Caroline watched her very closely, but she seemed ‘just her ordinary self’—just the ordinary self, in other words, that she had lately become, ‘quite quiet, and tired; distracted but not at all nervous’. When the dinner was cleared away, the two women stayed in the little parlour, listening to a crackling music programme on the house’s portable wireless. Betty brought them cocoa at nine o’clock; they read, or sewed, until half past ten. Only then, Caroline said, did her mother grow restless. She went to one of the windows and put back the curtain, and stood looking out at the snow-covered lawn. Once she tilted her head and said, ‘Do you hear that, Caroline?’ Caroline, however, could hear nothing. Mrs Ayres remained at the window until the draught drove her back to the fire. The fit of restlessness, apparently, had passed; she spoke of ordinary things and her voice was steady, again she seemed ‘just herself’."|"The Little Stranger"|"Sarah Waters"

Made wary and anxious by me, Caroline watched her very closely, but she seemed ‘just her ordinary self’—just the ordinary self, in other words, that she had lately become, ‘quite quiet, and tired; distracted but not at all nervous’. When the dinner was cleared away, the two women stayed in the little parlour, listening to a crackling music programme on the house’s portable wireless. Betty brought them cocoa at nine o’clock; they read, or sewed, until half past ten. Only then, Caroline said, did her mother grow restless. She went to one of the windows and put back the curtain, and stood looking out at the snow-covered lawn. Once she tilted her head and said, ‘Do you hear that, Caroline?’ Caroline, however, could hear nothing. Mrs Ayres remained at the window until the draught drove her back to the fire. The fit of restlessness, apparently, had passed; she spoke of ordinary things and her voice was steady, again she seemed ‘just herself’."|"The Little Stranger"|"Sarah Waters"
"ap 10:30"|"half past ten"|"She had sat with her mother the day before, it seemed, just as I’d instructed. First she had read aloud to her; then, when Mrs Ayres had begun to doze, she’d put the book aside and had Betty bring her her sewing. They had sat together like that, companionably, until seven o’clock, when Mrs Ayres went alone to the bathroom.

"ap < 05:00"|"almost five"|"Her thoughts ran wildly like that, until her head began to feel like an engine, churning and hot. By now, several hours had passed: she looked at her watch and found that it was almost five, well past the dead point of the night, but still an hour or two from daybreak. She needed the lavatory, and she wanted to wash and cool her face. Her mother was apparently still deeply asleep, so she went around the landing, past the shut door of Betty’s room, to the bathroom. Then, her flask of tea finished and her eyes still sore, she thought to calm herself down and keep herself awake by smoking another cigarette. The packet in her cardigan pocket was empty, but she knew there was another in the drawer of her bedside table; and since she could see very clearly across the well of the staircase into her mother’s room, she went into her own room, sat on her bed, got a cigarette out, and lit it. To make herself more comfortable she just kicked off her shoes and raised her legs, so that she was sitting against her pillow with the ashtray in her lap. Her bedroom door was wide open, and the view across the landing was a very clear one. She kept impressing this fact on me, when we talked about it later. By turning her head, she said, she could actually see, through the dimness, the footboard of her mother’s bed. The house was so still, she could even hear the steady gentle push and draw of her mother’s breaths …"|"The Little Stranger"|"Sarah Waters"
"ap > 08:00"|"just after eight"|"At that, Caroline woke properly. Glancing at the clock, she saw that it was just after eight. The day was bright beyond the curtain—unnaturally bright, because of the snowy ground. Alarmed, queasy, trembling with lack of sleep, she rose and went rapidly around the landing to her mother’s room. Just as Betty had claimed, its door was closed and locked, and when she tapped on the door—lightly at first, but then more firmly, as her anxiety mounted—she received no answer."|"The Little Stranger"|"Sarah Waters"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"It was a good hour or so after I’d arrived at the house that she told me all this, and by then I had been up to Mrs Ayres’s room myself. I had to nerve myself to go in there, standing at the door with my hand on the key. I, too, kept thinking of Caroline having been there before me, pushing the door and finding it blocked … My first sight of Mrs Ayres’s swollen, darkened face made me shudder; but worse was to come, for when I opened up her nightgown in order to examine her body, I found a score of little cuts and bruises, apparently all over her torso and limbs. Some were new, some almost faded. Most were simple scratches and nips. But one or two, I saw with horror, had the appearance almost of bites. The freshest, still smeared with blood, had clearly been made very shortly before her death—in other words, in that relatively brief space of time between Caroline’s having left her at five o’clock and Betty’s appearance with the breakfast tray at eight. What terror and despair must have gripped her in those three dark hours, I couldn’t imagine. The Veronal should have kept her sleeping long past the point of Caroline’s departure; instead, somehow, she had woken, had risen, had calculatedly closed and locked her bedroom door and disposed of the key, and begun the systematic business of torturing herself to death."|"The Little Stranger"|"Sarah Waters"

"> 12:00"|"past noon"|"For a second or two I considered it. I have never relished post-mortems, and they are especially hard to perform when the patient in question has been a personal friend. At the same time, I thought of giving Mrs Ayres’s poor marked body over to Graham, or to Seeley, and my mind revolted from it. It seemed to me that I had let her down badly already; if there was no way of sparing her this final indignity, then the least I could do was to see the thing through myself, and see it done gently. So I shook my head and told him I would manage. And as it was now well past noon, with my morning surgery irrecoverable and the afternoon stretching blankly before me, when I left the coroner’s office I went straight to the mortuary, to get the examination over with as quickly as I could."|"The Little Stranger"|"Sarah Waters"
"ap 06:30"|"half past six"|"She said, still partly in her dream, ‘What time is it?’
‘It’s half past six. I’ve brought you some soup, look.’
‘Oh.’ Her expression cleared. She rubbed her face. ‘I really don’t think I can eat.’"|"The Little Stranger"|"Sarah Waters"
"ap > 08:31"|"just after half past eight"|"I’d lost sense of the time. When the Heptons’ maid let me in I heard voices and the chink of cutlery: I saw from the hall clock that it was just after half past eight, and realised with dismay that the family were gathered in the dining-room for their supper. Hepton himself came out to greet me with a napkin in his hand, still dabbing gravy from his mouth."|"The Little Stranger"|"Sarah Waters"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"As a result, the day itself passed off rather flatly. At one o’clock—the hour fixed for our wedding—I was sitting at the bedside of an elderly patient, concentrating on the case before me. When I left the patient’s house and heard the half-hour struck, I felt almost unmoved—wondering vaguely which other couple had taken our slot at the registry office, that was all. I saw a few more cases; evening surgery was quiet, and I spent the rest of the evening at home. By half past ten I was weary, and was actually thinking of my bed; in fact, I had got as far as kicking off my shoes and was heading upstairs in my bedroom slippers, when there was a furious knocking and ringing at my surgery door. I found a boy of about seventeen there, so breathless he could hardly speak. He’d run five and a half miles to fetch me out for his sister’s husband, who was in terrible trouble, he said, with pains in his belly. I gathered up my things and drove him back to his sister’s house: it turned out to be the worst sort of place imaginable—an abandoned hut, with holes in its roof and gaps in its windows, and without light or water. The family were squatters, Oxfordshire people who had moved north looking for work. The husband had been ill ‘on and off’ for days, they told me, with vomiting, fever, and stomach pain; they had been treating him with castor oil, but over the past few hours he had grown so poorly they’d become frightened. Having no regular doctor, they hadn’t known who to send out for. They had come to me in the end because they could remember having seen my name in the local paper."|"The Little Stranger"|"Sarah Waters"

"ap 00:30"|"half past twelve"|"Then he was seized by a dreadful fit of vomiting, and passed beyond the point of speech. The family grew more frightened than ever, I managed to persuade them at last of the seriousness of his condition, and the issue then became how to get him to the hospital without delay. Ideally he should have gone by ambulance. But the hut was an isolated one, and the nearest telephone was at a post-office two miles away. I could see nothing for it but to take him myself, so the brother-in-law and I, between us, carried him outside on his truckle-bed, then carefully laid him on the back seat of my car. The wife squeezed herself in beside him, the boy sat in the front, and the couple’s children were left in the care of the elderly mother. It was a pretty frightful journey we made, seven or eight miles mostly on lanes and back roads, the man groaning or screaming with every jolt of the car, now and then vomiting into a bowl; the woman weeping so much she was more or less useless; the boy scared out of his wits. The only thing in our favour was the moon, which was full, and bright as a lamp. Once we joined the Leamington road I could go faster; by half past twelve we were pulling up at the hospital doors, and twenty minutes later the man was taken off to the operating theatre—looking so ill by then, I really feared for his chances. I sat with the woman and the boy, not wanting to leave them until I had seen how the case turned out. At last the surgeon, Andrews, came to tell us that all had gone well. He had caught the appendix before perforation could take place, so there was now no threat of peritonitis; the man was weak but, apart from that, recovering nicely."|"The Little Stranger"|"Sarah Waters"
02:00|"two a.m."|"After the race to the hospital, followed by the dread of waiting and the subsequent relief, there was something mildly hallucinatory about the whole encounter, and my car, as I drew away, seemed by contrast very hushed and lonely. It’s a queer thing, being plunged in and out of the dramas of one’s patients—especially at night. The experience can leave one feeling drained, but also oddly wakeful and edgy, and now my mind, with nothing to anchor it, began to run over the details of the past few hours like a film on a loop. I remembered the boy, speechless and panting at my surgery door; the man, drawing up his knees and weakly kicking out at me; the woman’s tears, the vomiting and yelling; Andrews, with his surgeon’s manner and voice; the impossible cottage; the bodies and the puppies—On and on it went, over and over, compelling and exhausting, until, to break the spell of it, I wound down my window and lit a cigarette. And something about doing that, in the darkness of the car, with the soft white glare of the moon and the headlamps lighting my hands—something made me realise that the journey I was making was the journey I had made back in January, after the hospital dance. I looked at my watch: it was two a.m., on what should have been my wedding-night. I was meant to have been lying in a train now, with Caroline in my arms."|"The Little Stranger"|"Sarah Waters"
"ap > 06:00"|"just after six"|"I woke in daylight, chastened and cramped. It was just after six. The windows of the car were running with condensation and my head was bare: my hat had worked its way down between my shoulder and the seat, to be crushed beyond recovery, and the blanket was lumped around my waist as if I’d been wrestling with it. I opened the door to the fresh air, and climbed awkwardly out. There was a scuffling at my feet—I thought of rats, but it was hedgehogs, a pair of them, they had been nosing at the tyres of the car and now disappeared into the long grass. They left dark trails behind them, the grass was pale with dew. The pond had a faint mist across it—the water was grey now instead of white—the place had lost the air of unreality it had had in the early hours. I felt rather as I could remember feeling after a bad air-raid in the city: coming blinking out of the shelter, seeing the houses marked but still standing, when in the midst of the worst of the bombing it had seemed as though the world were being blasted to bits."|"The Little Stranger"|"Sarah Waters"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"Graham gave her a sedative, and then, just as I had recently done, he picked up the old-fashioned Hundreds telephone and called for the police and the mortuary van. He also called me, wanting to let me know what had happened; again, of course, there was no answer. He thought of the vehicles that would soon be coming, and remembered the fastened park gates; he got the key to the padlocks from Betty and went back across the moonlit park to his own car. He said he was glad to leave the house, and reluctant to enter it again. He felt, irrationally, as if the place had a sickness in it, a sort of lingering infection in its floors and walls. But he stayed through all of the ensuing business: the arrival of the sergeant, and the loading of Caroline’s body into the van. It was all finished by five o’clock; after that, there was only Betty to deal with. She looked so shaken and pathetic, he considered taking her home with him; again, though, he found himself oddly unwilling to prolong his contact with the Hall. But it was out of the question to leave her alone in that frightful setting, so he waited while she put her things together, then drove her the nine-and-a-half miles to her parents’ house; he said she shivered all the way. After that he had returned to Lidcote, to tell Anne what had happened; and then he’d come looking for me."|"The Little Stranger"|"Sarah Waters"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"Betty had gone to bed at ten o’clock. She had heard Miss Ayres go into her own room about half an hour later. She had heard it very clearly, because Miss Ayres’s room was just around the landing from her own. Yes, that was the first landing. There was a second landing above, both of them overlooking the hall by the same stairwell, both lit by a glass dome in the roof."|"The Little Stranger"|"Sarah Waters"
"ap ~ 02:30"|"about half past two"|"At about half past two she had been woken by the creak of footsteps out on the stairs. At first she had been frightened. Why was that, Riddell asked her? She didn’t quite know. Possibly the house, being large and lonely, was an unnerving one at night? Yes, she supposed that was it. The fear, anyway, had soon passed. She’d realised the steps were Miss Ayres’s. She guessed that she had got up, perhaps to go to the lavatory, perhaps to make herself a warm drink in the kitchen downstairs. Then she heard more creaks, and realised with surprise that Miss Ayres was heading, not down, but up, to the house’s second floor. Why did she think Miss Ayres had done that? She couldn’t say. Was there anything up there but empty rooms? No, nothing at all. She had heard Miss Ayres go very slowly along the upstairs passage, as if she was feeling her way through the dark. Then she heard her stop, and make a sound."|"The Little Stranger"|"Sarah Waters"
