I thought I had felt powerful emotions before, but nothing in my life-not the death of my mother, not the Olympic gold medal in Los Angeles, not my thirty-six hours with Prince Henry, and not even the birth of Genevieve under the watchful eyes of my father at the hospital in Tours-was as intense as my joy and relief when I finally heard Simone’s first cry."|"The Garden of Rama"|"Arthur C. Clarke"

I was still awake at midnight, reliving my noon encounter with Henry at the chalet on the side of the Weissfluhjoch. I had not told him, when he indirectly inquired, that he was Genevieve’s father. I would not give him mat satisfaction."|"The Garden of Rama"|"Arthur C. Clarke"

It was an easy birth, only four hours from the first strong contraction to delivery. There was no significant pain at any time. I delivered squatting on my haunches and was in such good shape that I cut the umbilical myself."|"The Garden of Rama"|"Arthur C. Clarke"
07:00|"seven o’clock in the morning"|"I have not heard his voice since then. He has been gone now for six days. I slept soundly that night, unaware mat Richard was packing his things and leaving me a note. At seven o’clock in the morning, an alarm sounded. There was a message filling the black screen. It said, “FOR NICOLE DBS JARDINS ONLY-Push K when you want to read.” The children were not yet awake, so I pushed the K button on the keyboard."|"The Garden of Rama"|"Arthur C. Clarke"

She took care of Benjy without any help from anyone during my surprisingly long labor. Every time I would shout, Benjy would cry out in response and Simone would try to soothe him."|"The Garden of Rama"|"Arthur C. Clarke"
"> 00:00"|"Just after midnight"|"On the night that Richard had been gone for exactly two years, I was completely unable to sleep. I was feeling lonely, as usual.

The O’Tooles had abandoned what was left of their meal and rushed into the bar. There they had learned that the earthquake had struck at 5:45 in the evening, Pacific time. The giant San Andreas fault had ripped apart near Cajon Pass and the poor people, cars, and structures within a hundred miles of the epicenter had been tossed about on the surface of the Earth like hapless boats at sea during a hurricane."|"The Garden of Rama"|"Arthur C.
