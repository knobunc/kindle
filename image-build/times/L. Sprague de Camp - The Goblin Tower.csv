clear, as it had been in Xylar. The execution had been timed for noon, and
little time had elapsed since Jorian had placed his neck upon the block. Soon,
however, the sun's motion would make it useless as a directional guide. He
would have to risk crossing one of these roads despite the danger."|"The Goblin Tower"|"L. Sprague de Camp"

Othomae, and a damned good one! My helpers and I sounded the hours in the city
hall tower and never missed a stroke. Twenty years ago—or was it ten? No
matter— your perverted father sold a water clock to the town council, and there
it stands in the tower, going bong, bong with its wheels and levers. Since then
I've had to live by odd jobs, and life has been hell. I cannot beat your
fornicating father to a pulp, but you'll do!"""|"The Goblin Tower"|"L. Sprague de Camp"
"> 12:00"|"after noon"|"It was after noon when the Talaris
dropped anchors in the small bay on the south side of Rennum Kezymar. The
dinghy was lowered to transfer the slave girls ashore. With two sailors to row,
Jorian, Karadur, and two of the girls went first. As they climbed out on the
rickety little small-boat pier and the dinghy returned to the ship, a group of
men approached from the shoreward end of the pier. They were brown-skinned,
turbaned, and wrapped in many layers of wool and cotton, draped and tucked in
various ways with loose ends fluttering in the wind."|"The Goblin Tower"|"L. Sprague de Camp"

the mechanism that controls it, to make it rise after midnight instead of at
sunset. And now to bed; this has been a fatiguing day."""|"The Goblin Tower"|"L. Sprague de Camp"

meal in the refectory of Simha's Inn when Captain Strasso came in."|"The Goblin Tower"|"L. Sprague de Camp"

his fine raiment and wear a piece of sacking pinned about his body, as
Ajimbalin himself was wont to do. He made him sleep on the ground in the palace
courtyard and spend all his waking hours memorizing Ajimbalin's moral precepts.
Filoman's idea of wild revelry had been to sit up till midnight over a flagon
of ale and a game of draughts with some crony; but even these simple pleasures
were denied him."|"The Goblin Tower"|"L. Sprague de Camp"

the window panes of her bedroom. She opened the window to see Jorian, hanging
by one hand from a vertical rope, about which his legs were locked, while he
tapped with the other hand. As she helped him over the sill and led him into
the adjoining living room, she asked:"|"The Goblin Tower"|"L. Sprague de Camp"
"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"The stream gathered volume as it flowed, and
around noon it joined another. Below this confluence, the united stream formed
a small river, a fathom or two in width—small enough for easy fording but too
voluminous to use as a path. Because of the density of the vegetation along the
banks, Jorian and Karadur followed the stream at some distance, glimpsing the
water through the trees."|"The Goblin Tower"|"L. Sprague de Camp"
12:00|noon|"""Very well,"" said Jorian, and saddled
up. By noon they had reached the main camp of the Gendings, on a slight rise in
the land north of the seaport of Istheun. Beyond Istheun could be seen the
steely glitter of the sun on the waters of the Bay of Norli, where several of
the undecked, canoelike little ships of this region were setting out on their
first voyage of the season under their single brown, square sails. Istheun
itself was a crescent-shaped town embracing the end of the bay. A wall of rough
fieldstone, atop which a score of windmills whirled merrily in the brisk breeze
from the steppe, surrounded the town."|"The Goblin Tower"|"L. Sprague de Camp"

after story: some dredged out of his memory, some made up on the spot. Speaking
in a low, undramatic voice, he shamelessly padded the tales and strung them
out, deliberately keeping them from becoming too exciting. In consequence, by
midnight every man of the escort was asleep. Watches had not been posted,
because Glaum had dozed off before he thought to do so. The clearing buzzed
gently with the snores of the Gendings."|"The Goblin Tower"|"L. Sprague de Camp"

waterfront rose a multitude of dwellings of Tarxia's more prosperous laymen,
including that of Valdonius the magician. Around noon on the nineteenth of the
Month of the Crow, Jorian knocked on the door of Valdonius' house. When the
porter opened the peephole, Jorian said:"|"The Goblin Tower"|"L. Sprague de Camp"
