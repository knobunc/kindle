Any demonstrations that took place would be off on the access road, well outside the prison. The objectors would be shouting their opposition from 1,5oo feet away. If not for this plan, some of the best men in the media might have been looking right now for interviews with the demonstrators, even encouraging them to come up with scorching remarks.

He had been back and forth on the phone with Jinks Dabney from three in the morning until dawn, and they had come to the opinion that the State of Utah couldn’t ask for a Writ of Mandamus because Ritter had not acted beyond his authority. If the Governor of the State of Utah had been ordered to move the Capitol Building three blocks south because some little law was being broken, that would fit Mandamus. But this, at least on the face of it, was a bona ride lawsuit. A motion had been made and granted. Why, the Attorney General’s office wouldn’t have even dared to bring in a Writ of Mandamus if it wasn’t Willis Ritter.

Pevar kept trying to get back to the point that you couldn’t slap Writs of Mandamus on Judges for too little, but the Court did not accept it.

Debbie, however, had been brought to Chicago to do the last-minute typing, and now that they were done she wanted to swim in Hugh Hefner’s famous indoor pool at the mansion where you could watch the swim mers through a glass wall in the underground bar. She wasn’t an ex-Playboy Bunny for nothing. So Kretchmer opened up the mansion. Nobody was in town. Nobody was ever in the mansion anymore now that Hefner was in Los Angeles, but Debbie was’able to go swimming while Farrell and Schiller just said, “Oh, no,” and lay out in the sauna at three in the morning."|"The Executioner's Song"|"Norman Mailer"

She is scared to death of the dark because “he’s out there with a gun killing people.” She doesn’t say Gary … only “He”—and she’s truely haunted—at 4 AM last week, hysterical, “He’s out there killing people, now he’s gone to kill more people —hurry, we got to get up there before He kills more!” this is hou, it is all the time—even in Her sleep—when She sleeps. It makes no difference if we are all here, She must be reassured all night that He can’t get in & kill us, no one sleeps the whole night because April wakes us every hour with “Are you allright mama — what are we going to do??!” I tell you Larry I hate Gilmore so bad I wish he was here so I could kill him! April … from the things she say’ s in her sleep & her panic at the sight of blood, I guess Gary’s shoes and pant-legs must have been covered with blood & brains, I guess so if the wall’s were splattered, I don’t know what to do anymore, I can’t talk to Sissy about her feelings towards Gary, she hides them, but will relate to music and cry long for Gary, it’s in poems —I can’t talk to April about Gary, because she don’t & won’t mention his name hardly ever—night before last in her sleep she said, “there he is with blood on him & that crazy look in his eyes.” nou, who, other than Gary would be tormenting her dreams! I know that crazy look in his eyes—it was there when he came after his gun, when he took April with him —sounds like I need a shrink too huh?? ha ha Well I don’t, I’m O.K. just need help infighting the ghost of Gilmore."|"The Executioner's Song"|"Norman Mailer"
