In a matter of an hour or so my father had seen the house and agreed to buy it. Another detail to his discredit was that he had seen it in the dark. Because it was January and he worked until five-thirty, he would have driven there after work, tramped through the snow, looked it over, and by seven or so it was a deal."|"Mother Land"|"Paul Theroux"

18:00|"six in the evening"|"The Caribe Hilton in Puerta de Tierra was fairly new and looking for employees. I applied for a job as a lifeguard, but hearing me speak English, the personnel manager suggested that I work in the newly opened restaurant. The customers were mostly English-speaking tourists. I got the job. I worked from six in the evening until midnight, when I took the bus back to Old San Juan. Now I had a salary. Mona signed up for Spanish classes. She was too big, too hot, too uncomfortable to attempt more than that."|"Mother Land"|"Paul Theroux"

"ap 05:30"|five-thirty|"And every morning I woke with a film of damp sweat on my face and remembered that I was living with Mona, who was pregnant, in a room in Old San Juan, and due at work at the Hilton restaurant at five-thirty. And I went numb, thinking: Hold on, stay calm, the days are passing, no one knows. There was a baby in Mona; there was a darkness inside me and a woeful weight on my soul. My thoughts were for Mona and myself, but the woe was: my family must not find out about this shameful wicked business."|"Mother Land"|"Paul Theroux"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"Mona sat awkwardly on the plane, eight months pregnant, and we arrived in Boston at dawn. We had breakfast in a diner on Boylston Street near the Public Garden, and afterward walked into the garden. I had gotten used to walking very slowly with Mona at my side. Mona said she felt ill. She sat down on a bench and vomited onto the grass. I held her as she wiped her mouth on my shoulder. As she lay against me, heavy with trust and resignation, we were like lovers on that hot August morning. At nine o’clock we walked to the street and hailed a cab."|"Mother Land"|"Paul Theroux"

12:00|noon|"One hot summer day of high blue sky, the light breeze off the ocean fragrant with wild roses and beach plums and the tang of the sea, the noon heat cooking and concentrating the aromas, I drove over to bring Mother a carton of blueberries. She was sitting under her maple tree at the back of the house, sipping iced tea. As I approached her, she angled her shoulders and knees at me, and still sipping her tea, holding the tumbler like a measuring device, assessing me as I drew nearer to her. Even outside, Mother looked imperious. Whatever she sat on was a throne, including this old chair. Exposed to her penetrating gaze and inquisitive smile, I felt clumsy, and faltered. To compensate I walked with exaggerated care, hen-like, an altar boy observed by a congregation. The dull tap and fidget of ice in Mother’s tumbler told me that she was still eyeing me."|"Mother Land"|"Paul Theroux"
"ap 11:30"|eleven-thirty|"It took me almost an hour to make the copies and sort them. Then I shoved them into my bag with the check register and headed back to Mother’s. The return journey was slower. I was caught in Hyannis-bound traffic and realized, inching along, that it was eleven-thirty. Mother was due home at noon. I fumed, got sweaty, growled at the creeping line of cars ahead of me. And, at last, when I turned into Mother’s street, I thought I had just made it."|"Mother Land"|"Paul Theroux"

"ap 06:00"|six|"After years of steady work, a daily routine, writing all morning, a walk after lunch, more work in the late afternoon until wine o’clock, at six or seven, I had begun to slow down. And, in my solitude, I began to observe the family with a fascinated gaze. I saw what I had missed before. The battles had wearied me, yet had not repelled me. I had become absorbed in the bickering; the fighting in the family was like a sulfurous form of vitality. I even turned it into work, making notes as I had done as a young man in central Africa, in a district of warring clans or a peculiarly feud-prone village. I saw that what I had taken to be quarrelsome siblings and a vain and manipulative mother was much more poisonous, disruptive, and dangerous—a nest of vipers. The dreary family now seemed extraordinary in its cruelty and selfishness. This revelation liberated me and made me patient in my fascination."|"Mother Land"|"Paul Theroux"

"ap ~ 07:00"|"around seven"|"The idea was that Mother would be invited for brunch on the day, around seven. Before she was picked up—this was one of my jobs—she would be told it was Floyd’s wedding. She’d have two hours to get ready. In that time, she’d make her family calls. Everyone would be told and they would know they weren’t invited."|"Mother Land"|"Paul Theroux"

21:00|"nine at night"|"I wanted what any man might want: one night to hear a soft knock on my door, to find Angela outside on the steps, her hair drawn into a brush on the back of her head, her eyes lustrous, a slightly drunken smile on her face, her skin so smooth, in a black cape and red shoes on her small feet—unexpected, nine at night, perhaps—smiling, and as she reached for me her cape falling open, revealing her in lacy underclothes, a short nightgown or lingerie, maybe holding a bottle of wine. Male fantasy, the better for remaining a fantasy."|"Mother Land"|"Paul Theroux"
