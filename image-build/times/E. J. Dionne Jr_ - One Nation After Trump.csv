"ap 02:57"|257|"Conservatives quickly colonized large parts of the AM dial. In many communities, the stations that carried Limbaugh offered 24 hours of conservative talk (broken up in some cases by a lone moderate or liberal who represented “balance”). A 2007 study by the liberal Center for American Progress found that 91 percent of political talk radio broadcast each day on the 257 news/talk stations owned by the five largest commercial station owners was conservative. And of those 257 stations, 236 broadcast no progressive programming."|"One Nation After Trump"|"E. J. Dionne Jr_"
20:03|2003|"Cutbacks in the news divisions of the Big Three television networks were common as their competition with each other was expanded to include a struggle for audience with hundreds of cable and online offerings. In November 1980, the year CNN launched, 75 percent of television sets in use were tuned to one of the three nightly network newscasts during the dinner hour. By 2003, the figure had dropped to 40 percent. In 1980, 52.1 million Americans watched one of the three evening news programs. In the first quarter of 2017, that figure was 25.0 million. Network television news remains important. The Big Three still have excellent reporters, and, even with much smaller audiences, their evening news programs still draw far larger viewership than any of the cable news shows. But they have lost the dominance they once enjoyed.14"|"One Nation After Trump"|"E. J. Dionne Jr_"
06:35|"6:35 a.m."|"Even for Donald Trump, this particular tweet, sent at 6:35 a.m. that Saturday morning, marked a new low. And the largely uncritical response to this baseless claim from Trump’s Republican colleagues represented the triumph of partisanship over the fundamental democratic norms that had guided generations of politicians on both sides of the aisle."|"One Nation After Trump"|"E.

07:02|"7:02 a.m."|"The occupant of the Oval Office had accused the previous president of the United States of violating the law in spectacular fashion. And matters didn’t stop there. His first message was one of four he would issue against Obama. (Self-obsessively mixing show business and government business, he also offered an attack on Arnold Schwarzenegger for his stewardship of Trump’s old TV show, Celebrity Apprentice). Here is what Trump tweeted at 7:02 a.m.: “How low has President Obama gone to tapp [sic] my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy.” The double p on the word normally spelled “tap” was, perhaps, an indication of how little thought and care Trump put into this outburst. Watching this undisciplined and insecure man call his calm, confident, and popular predecessor “bad” and “sick” made it hard not to ponder the word “projection.”"|"One Nation After Trump"|"E. J.

12:01|"12:01 p.m."|"And Trump appears to have violated the emoluments clause at 12:01 p.m. on January 20 with his continued ownership of the Trump International Hotel in D.C. Trump had pledged to donate any profits he made from foreign government patrons at his hotels to the U.S. Treasury, but in March USA Today reported that he had made no such contributions. The Trump Organization then announced it would make the donation at the end of the calendar year, though this, of course, was just another promise, and there were repeated questions about how closely the Trump hotel was tracking foreign receipts."|"One Nation After Trump"|"E.

18:45|1845|"It was not until 1845 that Congress established Election Day as the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November to accommodate the needs of what was then still largely a nation of farmers. (Holding elections on Tuesdays did not interfere with Wednesday “Market Days.”) More than a century and a half on, a very different kind of society should be willing to revisit this decision. Moving Election Day from Tuesday to the weekend, ideally over a 24-hour period from noon Saturday to noon Sunday, would eliminate the “rush hours” that occur early in the morning and at the end of the day. It would ease participation by voters with irregular or inflexible working hours who are generally less well-off economically. Election Day itself should be a national holiday. And all states should have an extended period of early voting."|"One Nation After Trump"|"E. J. Dionne Jr_"

00:58|0.58|"We noted, for example, that the Electoral College disadvantages metropolitan areas, particularly large ones. Since metropolitan areas tend to be younger and more diverse than rural areas, the current system also discriminates against the new generation, and against African Americans, Latinos, and Asians. Aggravating this discrimination, white voters are more likely to live in swing states, while nonwhites are concentrated in “safe” states. One study of voting power on the Electoral College outcome found that, while every registered white non-Hispanic voter in 2012 had the potential influence of 1.05 registered voters, the influence of registered Asian voters stood at 0.58 and of Hispanic voters at 0.87. If the growth of metropolitan areas will make the Electoral College increasingly unrepresentative, so too will the rise of the nation’s nonwhite population concentrated in the nonswing states."|"One Nation After Trump"|"E.

10:15|"10:15 a.m."|"A similarly successful initiative was Daily Action, which sends texts each morning with marching orders for those who sign up to take action to combat Trump’s policies. Created by Laura Moser, a writer and mother of two young children, the messages offered by Daily Action are simple and direct. In late January, for example, her subscribers—they quickly numbered in the hundreds of thousands—got this on their phones at 10:15 a.m.: “Today’s daily action is to urge your Senator to place a ‘hold’ on Sessions’ AG nomination until Trump shows some respect for the rule of law.” Its alerts were part of the upsurge that forced House Republicans to back off their plan to gut the Office of Congressional Ethics. The group was also part of the phone campaign against Trump’s initial nominee for labor secretary, Andrew Puzder, who later withdrew. “If we can sustain this energy and this anger,” Moser told The Washington Post, “maybe we can reclaim our country.” Other groups followed similar models, linking advanced technology with the most old-fashioned forms of engagement."|"One Nation After Trump"|"E.
