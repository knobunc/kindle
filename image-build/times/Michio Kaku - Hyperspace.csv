19:53|1953|"It was 1953 in Romania, the country of Freund’s birth. Joseph Stalin had just died, an important event that led to a considerable relaxation of tensions. Freund was a precocious college freshman that year, and he attended a talk by George Vranceanu. He vividly remembers hearing Vranceanu discuss the important question: Why should light and gravity be so disparate? Then the lecturer mentioned an old theory that could contain both the theory of light and Einstein’s equations of gravity. The secret was to use Kaluza-Klein theory, which was formulated in five dimensions."|Hyperspace|"Michio Kaku"

I can vividly remember the sense of frustration among jaded young physicists during this period. Everyone sensed that the Standard Model was being killed by its own success. It was so successful that every international physics conference seemed like just another rubber stamp of approval. All the talks concerned finding yet another boring experimental success for the Standard Model. At one physics conference, I glanced back at the audience and found that half of them were slowly dozing off to sleep; the speaker was droning on with chart after chart showing how the latest data could be fit according to the Standard Model."|Hyperspace|"Michio Kaku"

After an hour or so, we would then cross-check our results. Usually two out of three would get it right, and the third would be asked to find his mistake. Then we would go to the next chunk, and repeat the same process until all three of us agreed on the same answer. This repetitive cross-checking went on late into the night. We knew that even one mistake in several hundred pages would give us a totally worthless calculation. Finally, well past midnight we checked the last and final term. It was zero, as we had hoped. We then toasted our result. (The arduous calculation must have exhausted even an indefatigable workhorse like Peter. After leaving my apartment, he promptly forgot where his wife’s new apartment was in Manhattan. He knocked on several doors of an apartment house, but got only angry responses; he had chosen the wrong building. After a futile search, Peter and Paul reluctantly headed back to Stony Brook.

But the conclusion that duality had to be broken seemed inescapable. Then I remembered what Sherlock Holmes, in Arthur Conan Doyle’s “The Sign of Four,” said to Watson: “How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.” Encouraged by this idea, I eliminated all the impossible alternatives. The only improbable alternative remaining was to violate the properties of the Veneziano-Suzuki formula. At about 3:00 A.M., the resolution finally hit me. I realized that physicists had overlooked the obvious fact that one can split the Veneziano-Suzuki formula into two pieces. Each part then corresponds to one of Feynman’s diagrams, and each part violates duality, but the sum obeys all the correct properties of a field theory."|Hyperspace|"Michio Kaku"

12:00|noonday|"That man is the product of causes which had no prevision of the end they were achieving; that his origin, his growth, his hopes and fears, his loves and his beliefs, are but the outcome of accidental collocations of atoms; that no fire, no heroism, no intensity of thought or feeling, can preserve a life beyond the grave; that all the labors of the ages, all the devotion, all the inspiration, all the noonday brightness of human genius, are destined to extinction in the vast death of the solar system; and the whole temple of Man’s achievement must inevitably be buried beneath the debris of a universe in ruins—all these things, if not quite beyond dispute, are yet so nearly certain, that no philosophy which rejects them can hope to stand. Only within the scaffolding of these truths, only on the firm foundation of unyielding despair, can the soul’s habitation be safely built.Russell wrote this passage in 1923, decades before the advent of space travel. The death of the solar system loomed large in his mind, a rigorous conclusion of the laws of physics. Within the confines of the limited technology of his time, this depressing conclusion seemed inescapable. Since that time, we have learned enough about stellar evolution to know that our sun will eventually become a red giant and consume the earth in nuclear fire. However, we also understand the basics of space travel. In Russell’s time, the very thought of large ships capable of placing humans on the moon or the planets was universally considered to be the thinking of a madman. However, with the exponential growth of technology, the prospect of the death of the solar system is not such a fearsome event for humanity, as we have seen. By the time our sun turns into a red giant, humanity either will have long perished into nuclear dust or, hopefully, will have found its rightful place among the stars."|Hyperspace|"Michio Kaku"
