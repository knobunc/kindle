03:00|"three in the morning"|"After her funeral my father and I took a week off and flew down to the heat, colors, and freshness of the Virgin Islands. We sat on the beach, swam, and took long, panting walks up into the hills. Each night the beauty of the sunset made us feel sad, empty, and heroic. We agreed on that. We drank dark rum and talked until two or three in the morning. I told him I wanted to go back and live in Europe after I had graduated. Two more of my short stories had been published, and I wondered excitedly if I might have the makings of a real writer. I realize now he would have liked me to stay with him for a while, but he said he thought Europe was a good idea."|"Voice of Our Shadow"|"Jonathan Carroll"
04:00|"four in the morning"|"When we were properly installed (and the bellboy had given us all an angry, insulted look because we had no baggage), and we’d bounced on each of the beds, Paul opened the door and paraded into my room with a Monopoly game he said he’d bought fresh for the occasion. We finished the night playing Monopoly on the floor and eating a terrific sacher torte ordered from room service. At four in the morning Paul said he had to go to work that day and had to get at least a little sleep."|"Voice of Our Shadow"|"Jonathan Carroll"
00:00|midnight|"“Exactly! He comes in for the midnight-to-seven spot. It makes good sense, Joey, so don’t laugh like that. Do you realize how many different beings you are in a lifetime? How all your hopes and opinions, everything, change every six or seven years? Aren’t all the cells in our bodies supposed to be different every few years? It’s just the same. Listen, there was a time when all India and I wanted was a saltbox house on the coast of Maine with lots of land around us. We wanted to raise dogs, can you believe it? Now just the thought of that kind of permanence makes me start to itch. Who’s to say the little guys in our bodies who wanted to live in the house haven’t been replaced by a whole new bunch who like to travel around and see new things? Apply that to who we are at the different times in our lives: You’ve got one crew that takes you from one to seven. Then they’re replaced by the group that steers you through puberty and that whole mess. Joe, are you going to tell me you’re the same Joe Lennox you were when your brother died?”"|"Voice of Our Shadow"|"Jonathan Carroll"

02:00|"two in the morning"|"One night we decided to see what Vienna offered in the way of night life. We must have gone to twenty places and had thirty cups of coffee, ten glasses of wine, and a Coke here and there. At two in the morning we were in the Café Hawelka looking at all the phonies when India turned to me and said, “Joey, you’re the most fun man I’ve been with since Paul. Why can’t I marry both of you?”"|"Voice of Our Shadow"|"Jonathan Carroll"
"ap ~ 07:00"|"around seven"|"Paul called that night around seven and asked if I wanted to go to a horror film with them. It was exactly what I didn’t want to do, and I begged off. When I hung up, I wondered if my refusal would make him suspicious. He knew India and I got together once in a while during the day. We would rendezvous when she was through painting or after one of her German classes at the university. What would happen now? He was so kind and generous; I’d never thought of Pad as a jealous or suspicious man. Was this a glimpse of that side of him?"|"Voice of Our Shadow"|"Jonathan Carroll"
"ap > 03:00"|"after three"|"“India? What time is it, for Christ’s sake?” I tried to make out the numbers on the clock next to the bed, but my eyes were too fogged over from sleep.
“It’s after three. Were you asleep?”
“Uh, yes. Where are you?”"|"Voice of Our Shadow"|"Jonathan Carroll"
03:00|"three o’clock in the morning"|"“Where’d you get that robe? You look like Margaret Rutherford.”
“India, it’s three o’clock in the morning. Shouldn’t you call Paul?”
“Why? He’s not around. He took off.”"|"Voice of Our Shadow"|"Jonathan Carroll"
10:00|"ten o’clock in the morning"|"In the meantime, India continued to come over, and we had our slivers of time when the world was only as big as my bed. When she was there I tried to put everything out of my mind and seize the part of the day she could give me. It was not a difficult time either, but I was often surprised by how exhausted I was at night. I would often fall into bed with a hunger for sleep I’d never known before. One day, when I asked India if the same thing had been happening to her, she was already asleep on my arm; it was only ten o’clock in the morning."|"Voice of Our Shadow"|"Jonathan Carroll"
12:00|noon|"Paul had the day off and wanted to take full advantage of it. I would write until noon; then we would meet for coffee at the Hotel Europa."|"Voice of Our Shadow"|"Jonathan Carroll"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"Why did India like me? The stories she told about her dead husband made him sound like the perfect companion — witty, adventurous, thoughtful, loving. If I had seen a bear in the road I would have run all the way home. The five o’clock blues seeped through my pores; even her presence didn’t help."|"Voice of Our Shadow"|"Jonathan Carroll"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"I didn’t see them until I had already opened the door to my building. It was after midnight. The black man had pushed the woman into a corner of the entryway. He was slamming her head against the metal mailboxes."|"Voice of Our Shadow"|"Jonathan Carroll"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"“Good, you got ‘em. If you’d like to take a shower, the bathroom’s opposite the bedroom. Gee, I’m makin’ it sound as if you’ve got all the time in the world. Can you stay for breakfast? I called the school and told them I was sick. Do you have to be somewhere? It’s only eight o’clock.”"|"Voice of Our Shadow"|"Jonathan Carroll"
"ap 07:08"|seven-oh-eight|"“Don’t look at me like that. You’re lookin’ just the way he did when I told him about it. Listen — a woman wants to be taken and ravished and adored by a man. She wants to forget the world and leap right the hell off the edge! But not here — tick, tick, tick — it is seven-oh-eight and thirty seconds. You see what I mean?”"|"Voice of Our Shadow"|"Jonathan Carroll"
"ap 03:30"|three-thirty|"Her school was old and red brick; you felt wealth radiating out from it like heat. I stood on the other side of the street at three-thirty and waited for her to come out. She had no idea I’d be there. Surprise!"|"Voice of Our Shadow"|"Jonathan Carroll"
"> 13:00"|"a little after one in the afternoon"|"I thought about her constantly and, mustering my courage one Saturday night, called her in New York. While the phone rang, I moved through her apartment in my mind, an affectionate camera stopping here and there to focus in on things I liked or felt particularly nostalgic about. She wasn’t in. I feverishly figured out the time difference and felt a little better when I realized I’d miscalculated — it was only a little after one in the afternoon there. I tried again later, but still no answer. It made me groan with doubt and jealousy; I knew if I called again and she wasn’t there, my heart would break. I called India instead and asked in a sad voice if she wanted to go to the movies."|"Voice of Our Shadow"|"Jonathan Carroll"
