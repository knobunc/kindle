12:17|"12:17 p.m."|"Pulling a dressing from my pocket, where I always carried some, I pressed it against my nose and leaned back. I’d burn the bandages later. The watch on my wrist said 12:17 p.m. Somehow within those few instants I had lost almost an hour and a half."|"Magic Bites"|"Ilona Andrews"
12:58|"12:58 p.m."|"The watch on my wrist showed 12:58 p.m. I’d have time to hit the morgue. The mandatory one-month waiting period for the dead vampires was nowhere close to running out and the MA sticker would ensure that I’d have no problem taking a look at the bloodsucker’s body."|"Magic Bites"|"Ilona Andrews"
"< 23:00"|"almost 11:00 p.m."|"It was almost 11:00 p.m. when I made it to Andriano’s. Bono rarely showed up before dark and I had used the time to hop the leyline back to my place and bring back Betsi, my beat-up old Subaru. It looked like I would be stuck in the city for a while. Since the magic would fall, the way it always did, I’d eventually need a car that worked during tech."|"Magic Bites"|"Ilona Andrews"
"ap 11:00"|"Eleven o’clock"|"“Tell him I’ll meet him tonight someplace private,” I said. “I’ll answer his questions if he answers mine.”
“Agreed. Eleven o’clock, corner of Unicorn and Thirteenth.”
He hung up. I tapped the desk with my fingers. I finally made sense of the doodle. The head of a howling wolf silhouetted against the semicircle of the moon. The sign of the Pack. Corwin belonged to the Pack."|"Magic Bites"|"Ilona Andrews"
"ap 01:58"|"one fifty-eight"|"I reached to my left and pressed the button of the intercom. It hissed.
“Fifteenth floor, one fifty-eight, please.”
His voice came back, distorted by the static. “Code, please.”"|"Magic Bites"|"Ilona Andrews"
00:00|midnight|"The spell-haze did not affect the view from the inside and huge windows offered a vision of midnight Atlanta under the endless black sky. The weak light of the single feylantern caressed the window glass, rendering it invisible, and permeated the darkness outside as if the apartment itself was but a piece of midnight sky, defined by glass and stone but not separated from the world outside. If I stood very close to the window, I could imagine that I was flying high above the city . . ."|"Magic Bites"|"Ilona Andrews"
"> 02:00"|"past two in the morning"|"I flipped open the Almanac and pulled the m-scan and the folded cutout of the article Bono had given me from between the book’s pages. Glancing at the m-scan one last time, I slid it onto the glass table, unfolded the article, and began to read. The owner of the apartment would arrive shortly. He rarely stayed out past two in the morning—he thought 3:00 a.m. to be an unlucky hour."|"Magic Bites"|"Ilona Andrews"

"ap 00:00"|twelve|"“It’s a deal,” I said. “I’ll meet you between twelve and twelve thirty at Las Colimas. Do you know where it is?”"|"Magic Bites"|"Ilona Andrews"
"ap 08:30"|"eight thirty"|"“The protector wishes to see you in his office today at eight thirty.”"|"Magic Bites"|"Ilona Andrews"
"ap 02:00"|two|"“Indeed. Unfortunately, he’s in the field. If he knew of your intention to visit, he would have postponed. He will be back this evening and I would be indebted to you if you could meet with us later, let’s say at two tonight?”"|"Magic Bites"|"Ilona Andrews"

the chosen Lord of Free Beasts,

requests your presence at the meeting of his Pack

at 22:00 of this night."|"Magic Bites"|"Ilona Andrews"
"ap 01:50"|"one fifty"|"Pain lanced my waist, tearing up into my chest. Gritting my teeth, I turned Derek on his stomach, worked one arm under his hips and threaded the other across his chest under his arms. He was heavier than he looked, weighing in at one fifty, maybe one fifty-five. No matter."|"Magic Bites"|"Ilona Andrews"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"“I got held up until ten,” he went on. “I called you but you didn’t answer. It was too late by then, but I figured I’d drop by with a peace offering.” He held up a paper bag full of white cartons, decorated with a stylized Chinese symbol in red ink. “You weren’t here. I thought I’d wait a couple of minutes, sat down here on the stairs . . .” His brain finally registered my bloodied clothes, the sword, and the smudges of dried blood marring my face. His eyes widened."|"Magic Bites"|"Ilona Andrews"
"ap 06:30"|"six thirty"|"He rubbed his face with his palms. “Did I oversleep?”
“It’s six thirty.”
“Time enough to get home and change clothes. When will I see you again?”"|"Magic Bites"|"Ilona Andrews"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"A young wolf whose name I didn’t know drove me to Greg’s apartment. I thanked him and walked up the stairs to find a white stain of a note pinned to my door. It said, “Kate, I tried to call but you didn’t answer. I hope we’re still on for tonight. I’ve made a reservation at Fernando’s for six o’clock. Crest.” I tore the note off the door, crumpling it, and tossed it aside. The wards shimmered shut. The sturdy door separated me from the rest of the world, and I breathed a sigh of relief. Kicking off the Pack’s sneakers, I crawled into the bed, and fell asleep."|"Magic Bites"|"Ilona Andrews"
"ap 06:00"|six|"“Ah,” Anna said. “Is there something more pressing?”
“A handsome plastic surgeon expects me at Fernando’s at six.”
“Aha. Did you happen to mention that you abhor Fernando’s?”"|"Magic Bites"|"Ilona Andrews"
00:00|midnight|"DAYLIGHT STREAMED THROUGH THE WINDOW tickling my face. I yawned and snuggled under the covers. I didn’t want to wake up. Not yet. In retrospect driving out of the city close to midnight, and with an aching hip, wasn’t the brightest idea, especially considering that the tech hit around four, leaving my truck marooned a mile away from the house, but I had gotten in just before the sunrise and now none of it mattered. I was home."|"Magic Bites"|"Ilona Andrews"
"~ 04:30"|"around four thirty this morning"|"“Her name’s probably Jennifer Ying,” I said. “The hair has Mongoloid texture. She’s one of the missing women whose names I found in Feldman’s file. The head wasn’t here when I came in, which was around four thirty this morning.”"|"Magic Bites"|"Ilona Andrews"
12:00|Noon|"I rubbed the sleep from my face. “What time is it?”
“Noon.”
The patrols caught me at seven in the morning and I had gone to bed around eight, which gave me a grand total of four hours of sleep. “When do we have to leave?”"|"Magic Bites"|"Ilona Andrews"
