12:00|midday|"I returned to the hotel for my midday cleaning and meditation. I ate some crackers, seaweed snacks, and cashew nuts, and drank green tea from a vending machine outside my room. When I went out again after lunch the unclean receptionist gave me a map, and I chose a tourist spot to visit."|Ghostwritten|"David Mitchell"
08:30|"8:30 A.M."|"I kept a low profile all week, but invisibility might attract attention. I invented business meetings to attend, and from Monday to Friday walked past the receptionist with a curt “Good morning” promptly at 8:30 A.M. Time dragged its heels. Naha’s just another small city. The Americans from the military bases that plague these islands strut up and down the main streets, many of them with our females draped off their arms, Japanese females clad in nothing but little wraps of cloth. The Okinawan males ape the foreigners. I walked through the department stores, watching the endless chain of wanting and buying. I walked until my feet ached. I sat in shady coffee shops, where shelves sagged under the weight of magazines of mindtrash. I eavesdropped on businessmen, buying and selling what wasn’t theirs. I carried on walking. Workaday idiots gaped in the rattling vacuity of pachinko machines, as I had once done in the days before His Serendipity opened my inner eyes. Tourists from the mainland toured the souvenir shops, buying boxes of tat that nobody ever really wants. The usual foreigners selling watches and cheap jewelry on the pavements, without licenses. I walked through the games arcades where the poisoned children congregate after school, gazing at screens where evil cyborgs, phantoms, and zombies do battle. The same shops as anywhere else … Burger King, Benetton, Nike … High streets are becoming the same all over the world, I suppose. I walked through backstreets, where housewives put out futons to air, living the same year sixty times. I watched a potter with a pocked face, bent over a wheel. A dying man, coughing without removing his cigarette, repaired a child’s tricycle on a bottom step. A woman without any teeth put fresh flowers in a vase beneath a family shrine. I went to the old Ryukyu palace one afternoon. There were drinks machines in the courtyard, and a shop called The Holy Swordsman that sold nothing but key rings and camera film. The ancient ramparts were swarming with high school kids from Tokyo. The boys look like girls, with long hair and pierced ears and plucked eyebrows. The girls laugh like spider monkeys into their pocket phones. Hate them and you have to hate the world, Quasar."|Ghostwritten|"David Mitchell"
12:00|noon|"Coming out of an alpha trance one day after my noon cleansing, a spoked shadow congealed into a spider. I was going to flush it down the toilet when, to my amazement, it transmitted an alpha message! Of course, His Serendipity was using it to speak with me. The Guru has an impish sense of humor."|Ghostwritten|"David Mitchell"
06:45|"6:45 A.M."|"I walked to the port in the stellar heat of mid-afternoon and collected boat schedules from a rack. I pulled open my map. I have always preferred maps to books. They don’t answer you back. Never throw a map away. The islands beckoned, imperial emeralds in a sky-blue sea. I chose one labeled Kumejima. Half a day away to the west, but not so small that a visitor would stand out. There was only one boat per day, departing at 6:45 A.M. I bought a ticket for the next day’s sailing."|Ghostwritten|"David Mitchell"
12:00|midday|"Then, in July of that year, the comet is detected by observatories all over the world. Narrowly missing Neptune, it approaches Earth, eclipsing the Moon, blazing even in the midday sky over the airfields and mountain ranges and cities of the world. The unclean rush out and welcome this latest novelty. And that will be their undoing! The Earth is bathed in microwaves from the comet, and only those with high alpha quotients will be able to insulate themselves. The unclean die, retching, scratching out their eyes, stinking of their own flesh as it cooks on their bones. The survivors begin the creation of Paradise. His Serendipity will reveal himself as His Divinity. A butterfly emerging from the chrysalis of His body."|Ghostwritten|"David Mitchell"
01:30|"1:30 A.M."|"The radio alarm clock glowed 1:30 A.M. Bad karaoke throbbed through the walls. I was wide awake, straightjacketed by my sweaty sheets. A headache dug its thumbs into my temples. My gut pulsed with gamma interference: I lurched to the toilet. My shit was a slurry of black crude oil. I kept thinking of the thin teacher, and what I should have said to her to put her in her place. My eyes wandered around the labyrinth on the worn lino.

I met this gorgeous creature of the night last Friday at a club in Roppongi.” I could almost hear his saliva glands juicing. “Get this. Twenty-five,” which for Takeshi is the perfect age, making him ten years her senior. “Engaged,” which for Takeshi adds the thrill of adultery while subtracting any responsibility. “Only shag women who have more to lose than you do” was a motto of his. “Clubbed until four in the morning. Woke up Saturday afternoon, with my clothes on back-to-front, in a hotel somewhere in Chiyoda ward. No idea how I got there.

Koji was the class egghead at high school, which made him an outsider, too. He should have gone to a much better high school, but until he was fifteen his dad was always being transferred, so it was never that easy for him to keep up. Koji was also diabolically bad at sports. I swear, in three years I never saw him manage to hit a baseball once. There was one time when he took an almighty swing, the bat flew out of his hands and hurtled through the air like a missile, straight into Mr. Ikeda, our games master, who idolized Yukio Mishima even though I doubted he’d ever got through a whole book by anybody in his entire life."|Ghostwritten|"David Mitchell"

I remember her eyes scrunched up in laughter as we watched a street performer who stood motionless on a pedestal until you left a coin in his urn, when he changed his expression and pose until the next coin was dropped in. I remember her trying not to laugh at my bowling alley disasters. I remember lying on the blanket in Ueno Park as the cherry blossoms fell onto our faces. I remember her in this room, in this chair, listening to my favorite music as she did her homework. I remember her face as she concentrated, and that strand of hair that fell down, almost touching her notebook. I remember kissing the nape of her neck in elevators between floors, and springing apart when the doors suddenly opened. I remember her telling me about her goldfish, and her mother, and life in Hong Kong. I remember her asleep on my shoulder on the night bus. I remember looking at her across the table. I remember her telling me about the ancient Jomon people who buried their kings in mounds, on the Tokyo plain. I remember her face at Mrs. Nakamori’s when Koji and I did “Round Midnight” better than we’ve ever played it before. I remember.… “I dunno, Koji. Maybe we didn’t do it because we could have done it.” Was that true? It would have been easy, just to slip into a love hotel. My body certainly wanted to. But … but what? “I really can’t say.

The computer was fucking up my eyes, I hadn’t eaten since a BLT at lunch, I’d gone through hunger and numbness several times as my stomach downsized. Around midnight I started feeling dizzy. I came down to this coffee bar just across the street from Cavendish Tower, and ordered the biggest fuckoff triple shitburger they did, two of them, and put ten sugar cubes into my coffee.

I’m well. I’m flat-hunting. I should be closing on a little flat in Islington this time next week. The pipes are noisy but at least there aren’t any ghosts. Sorry, that’s not funny. I’m doing a lot of P.A.ing for Cecile’s Temp Agency, just to keep my hand in. Vernwood’s left for Wall Street. Some hotshot fresh from the London School of Economics has been given his desk.

Might be nice to meet up, I just thought, y’know, but then again you’ll probably have people to meet and all that.… And some of my jewelry is still in your apartment. We wouldn’t want that maid getting her hands on it and running back to China, eh? I don’t think I ever got those keys back from her. You’d better change the locks. I’m okay, but I need a holiday. About forty years would do me.

A couple of listless young Mongolians on military service fingered their rifles, thinking of where they would rather be.

Baljin told her uncle about the wallet thrown at her feet. I had erased the memories of Suhbataar’s aggression.

So utterly obvious. While I was allotting corridors and handing floor-plans to the women, I thought Gutbucket Petrovich was about to break her vow of silence and say something, but she bit her tongue at the last moment. Wise. The head of security was playing cards in the lodge with his bat-faced brother-in-law. He nodded briefly at Rudi, and waved us through.

Two of Rudi’s cleaners were there, complaining about their bones, complaining about the weather, complaining about the waxing machines.

The glum and the bored and the quietly desperate and the manic jolly and the spectators. The croupiers worked like cyborgs, avoiding eye contact. I looked up to try to spot the cameras, but the ceiling was hidden in black like that of a TV studio. There were no windows, no clocks. Walnut paneling, prints of racehorses and greyhounds.

"~ 13:00"|"around one in the afternoon"|"In the days and weeks following my routine grew saggier but regular. I got up around one in the afternoon and ate at a dim sum restaurant across the alleyway. The place was owned by an old albino man. I sat in the corner with The Economist, Legal Advisor, a Delia Smith cookery book, or whatever else was lying around Huw’s apartment. On lucky days the shoeshiner who was the de facto postman for our tenement had a jiffy bag addressed to Huw with a tape from John. I listened to them in my dim sum corner on Huw’s Walkman, over and over. Sometimes John had recorded new compositions, or lines from his new poems. Sometimes he’d just record a busy night in The Green Man. Sometimes sheep, seals, skylarks, the wind turbine. If Liam were home there would be some Liam. The summer fair. The Fastnet Race. I would unfold my map of Clear Island. Those tapes prised the lid off homesickness and rattled out the contents, but always at the bottom was solace."|Ghostwritten|"David Mitchell"
12:00|noon|"When he was out, as I lay there unstitched, the pain seeping away, Maisie held up Liam! This alien parasite, glistening in mucus? Laugh or cry? Birth had come visiting, just as death will, and everything was perfectly clear. My mother, Maisie, St. Bernadette and I shared a few moments, postponing the clod-hopping hullabaloo. Maise washed Liam in a tin bath.
It was noon. I felt I was cradling little Apollo.
Liam fed the hook into the mouth of the earthworm. The hook slid deeper into its gut as it squirmed. “Chew on that, my hermaphrodite.”"|Ghostwritten|"David Mitchell"

“You’ve got until noon, son,” said John.
John held my arm as we walked. He didn’t need to, his feet knew every inch of Clear Island: that’s why he moved back here permanently when his blindness closed in. He held my arm because he believed it made me feel like a teenager again, and he was right. We turned left hand at the only crossroads. Only the sounds of wind, gulls, sheep, and waves floated on the silence. “Any clouds?”"|Ghostwritten|"David Mitchell"

The first people on this island needed time four times a year: the solstices and the equinoxes, to avoid planting seed too early or too late. When the Church got here, it staked out Sundays, Christmases, Easter, and began colonizing the year with saints’ days. The English brought short leases and tax deadlines. With the railway, the hours had to march in time. Now TV satellites beam the same six o’clock news everywhere at the same six o’clock. Science has been as busy splicing time into ever thinner slivers as it has matter. In my Light Box research on superconductors, I dealt in jiffies: there are 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 of them in a second."|Ghostwritten|"David Mitchell"

The other news is that it’s snowing, snowing, snowing, and what will the robin do then, poor thing? New York, New York, you’re tuned to Night Train FM, this is Bat Segundo proudly presenting the End of the World Special. Come rain or shine—or snow—I’ve been hosting this spot for eight years and I have no intention of letting thermonuclear war put a wrench in Night Train’s works. Hello Bronx! Hard to see you … this snow! Looking kinda smoky over your way? The lights around the World Trade Center are off, have been since the curfew sirens.… There was a big explosion on Roosevelt Island ’round midnight, nothing but silence now. I am still here, therefore it wasn’t no Big One. Power supply looks sporadic in Harlem. The lights go on, then off, like a busted neon tube.… and it’s kinda quiet, spooky outside the Night Train FM building here in the East Village. Lexington Avenue is deserted, except for the occasional police patrol. People, don’t venture out of doors unless you need to. Trust a nocturnal animal. Especially one smart enough to sleep through the winter. Uh … Is anyone listening to this? If you’re not busy setting cars ablaze or looting Tiffany’s then you’re probably wired to the television, watching the greatest drama mankind has ever staged. With Apocalypse Right Now, You Can Feel Your Eyeballs Melt as You Watch the Boom! But hey, remember, phone-in radio invented interactive. Night Train FM rolls on! Even by broadcasting we may be defying last week’s Emergency Media Advisory Act—cute name, huh? I tried to phone the Night Train lawyer, but there was no answer. He’s probably thirty feet down in his private, hermetically-sealed Eden III New England bunker. Cockroaches and lawyers will survive this war and emerge to evolve into the next civilization. Maybe the info police are too busy to kick our door down, or maybe some giant jamming signal is blanketing all frequencies, or maybe some plug has been pulled from some socket somewhere and I’m just talking to myself. Christ knows, I had enough practice during my marriage. A happier possibility is that the Emergency Mayor is a Paul Simon fan: the last track was ‘Still Crazy After All These Years,’ respectfully dedicated to all the governments of the world, preceded by the late, great Freddie Mercury, ‘Who Wants to Live For Ever,’ dedicated to me. Thanks, Bat. Hey Bat, you’re welcome. If there are any members of the American Parents Against English Gay Men with Mustaches who are offended by the inclusion of Freddie Mercurial on my show, you are welcome to lodge your complaints up Lord Rupert’s hole. Looking on the positive side for a moment, if a big one gets through SkyWeb and pulps the Big Apple into quarks and gluons, I can ask the great Saint Freddie in person what the bejesus ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’ is about. The track before was dedicated to my ex-wife: The Smiths’ ‘Bigmouth Strikes Again.’ Just gimme a moment while I pour my next scotch … gurgle, gurgle, gurgle, y’hear that? A flamingo swallowing a well-oiled eel. I drink Kilmagoon. Grants, now that’s your trumpet of a whisky, but Kilmagoon is your tenor saxophone. Damned fine whisky, Kilmagoon. First whisky I ever fell in love with. If the war gets called off due to poor visibility, Mr. Kilmagoon can feel free to send me an oaken cask of your maturest for—hic!—my wholehearted product endorsement. Say, sorry the presentation is a little rough around the edges tonight, that’s because I’m managing the equipment all on my ownyownyown, since the regular Night Train FM crew—the engineer, Carlotta my producer, and the boy wonder Kevin—all got it into their heads that spending the end of the world with their loved ones actually takes priority over reporting to work!

When I was a young man, and the Russkies were going to blow us all to Kingdom Come, we were told we’d have a four-minute warning. I’m talking Ford, Carter, Reagan days. Four minutes, I used to wonder … What would I do in four minutes? Boil an egg, have sex, telephone my enemies to have the final word, listen to Jim Morrison, hotwire a car, and drive three blocks? Since the breakdown we’ve had four days of these patrols and curfews.… It’s the waiting that pisses me off.… This evening’s declaration of war, at least it made things … clearer. Where were we? The next track … I’m going to dedicate this song to my daughter, Julia, who’ll be eight next Tuesday, if there is a next Tuesday, this is ‘Julia’ by the Beatles. The chances of you hearing this are zilch, my ocean child, because I last got a call from your mother being rerouted by the evacuation police to Omaha or Moosejaw or the ends of the Earth, but your mother and I named you after this song, in happier times. A beaut of a Lennon number from deep within that cornucopia of oddities, The White Album. ‘Half of what I say is meaningless, so I sing a song of love to Juuuulia.’ Well! Jeepers creepers! The Batphone is flashing, and on a night such as this! The void has a voice, after all—well, who could it be, Mr. President, Freddie Mercury, the prophet Elijah, whoops, mustn’t offend any monotheists out there, especially considering how well the planet has prospered under God’s exemplary stewardship—Hello, mystery caller, you are speaking to the end of the world!”"|Ghostwritten|"David Mitchell"
