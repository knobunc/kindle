We go down to the union for a drink and talk about the course. This Rab’s not the sort of guy who immediately stands out in a crowd, which is strange because he’s quite handsome. It’s a very conventional handsome, however, the type you fuck between serious boyfriends.

Looking down, I spy a young mum with a pushchair outside the chemist. The bags under her eyes tell me that she could have been a model, for Samsonite, that is. They also tell me that I’ve come five hundred miles south to live in fuckin Great Junction Street.

I thought that she’d welcome a night in with Dianne, would have wanted to take the opportunity to sit up drinking wine and having a midnight feast of fridge snacks with her new favourite big sister. I thought that I was relegated to the role of the kooky, embarrassing, promiscuous auntie in her life. I get the feeling that Lauren’s here as she’s taken it on herself to ‘save’ me from a life of debauchery. How boring. The guy in the pub said there was no chance of a stay-back, so Terry’s gone ahead to scout this place. Then he calls us up on the mobile and we head down in a couple of taxis. I’m startled that Lauren’s elected to join us, but she’s been assured by Rab that he kept his clothes on and that shagging wasn’t compulsory."|Porno|"Irvine Welsh"
