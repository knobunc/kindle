12:00|noon|"“There are only two places where you can really feel the true magic of the mountains: On the plains from far away and standing on a peak,” Feng Fan continued. “My home was the vastness of the Hebei Plain. In the West, I could see the Taihang
Mountains, but between them and my home lay an immense expanse of perfectly flat land, without obstructions or markers. Not long after I was born, my mother carried me outside the house for the first time. My tiny neck could barely carry my head, but I already turned to the West and babbled my heart out. As soon as I learned to walk, I took my first tottering steps toward those mountains. When I was a bit older, I set out one early morning and walked along the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Railway. I walked until noon before my grumbling stomach made me turn back, yet the mountains still seemed endlessly far away. In school, I rode my bicycle toward the mountains, but no matter how fast I peddled, the mountains seemed to withdraw just as quickly. In the end, it never felt as if I had gotten even an inch closer to them. Many years later, far mountains would again become a symbol of my life. Like so many things in life that we can clearly see but never reach; a dream crystallized in the distance.”"|"The Wandering Earth"|"Liu Cixin"
12:00|midday|"For its part, a tyrannosaurus had found its midday meal. Hunting the central reaches of Gondwana, the dinosaur had found its way into a sunlit clearing in the middle of a primeval cycad forest. The tyrannosaur's lunch was a freshly caught lizard, plump and tasty. Using its great talons, it tore the struggling creature into halves with a mighty rip. Then, with a swift twist of the neck, the tyrannosaurus threw the tail end of the lizard up in the air and straight into its gaping maw. Chewing with relish, the dinosaur was completely satisfied with this world and its place in it."|"The Wandering Earth"|"Liu Cixin"
12:00|"noon that day"|"A yard or so from the tyrannosaur's left food stood a small ant city. Most of this city actually lay underground, providing a home for more than a thousand ants. This year's dry season had been very long, making life in the city more difficult with every passing day. By noon that day, the ants had already been suffering two days of hunger."|"The Wandering Earth"|"Liu Cixin"
12:00|midday|"After the tyrannosaurus had finished its meal, it took two steps back. Deeply content, it lay down for a midday nap. As it settled, the impact of the dinosaur's massive body caused the ant city to shake with the force of a powerful earthquake. Rushing to the surface, the ants saw the dinosaur's body lying in the distance like a towering range of mountains. Moments later another quake struck as that mountain range unexpectedly began rolling to and fro across the earth. As it rolled, the tyrannosaurus arched one of its massive claws toward its maw, vigorously attempting to poke the gaps between its teeth. The ants quickly understood why this dinosaur was not falling asleep: There was meat stuck between its teeth, obviously bothering it."|"The Wandering Earth"|"Liu Cixin"
12:00|midday|"Ten minutes later, the ants followed their mayor's lead, climbing up toward the dinosaur's humongous claws. The tyrannosaurus soon spotted the ants clambering up its forearm. Raising the other claw, it moved to brush them off its body. Its arm was like a vast bank of dark clouds, suddenly covering the sky and blocking out the midday sun. In the blink of an eye, the ants on the great plain of its forearm were covered by darkness. In shock, the ants stared up at the giant hand in the sky above, frenziedly waving their feelers. The mayor, however, climbed on, up the dinosaur's arm, over its claw, and right toward its huge mouth. The other ants timidly followed their mayor's example."|"The Wandering Earth"|"Liu Cixin"
12:00|noon|"One noon ever so slightly warmer, two Gondwanan ants chose to climb out of their deep ant hill and onto the surface. The faint Sun glowed dimly in the gray, lifeless sky. The Earth below was covered in densely packed ice and snow, with only the occasional rocky outcrop breaking the endless white, seeming all the more prominent in this indistinct land. In the distance, the far mountains, too, were covered in white."|"The Wandering Earth"|"Liu Cixin"
23:00|"eleven in the evening"|"Once at the station, however, business arrived before they even had the time to properly set up. When they finished at eleven in the evening, Ah Quan had made 28 yuan! Erbao, on the other hand, looked very unhappy as they made their way home. Grumpily he noted that business had been bad. Ah Quan could only take these words to imply that he had stolen Erbao’s customers from him."|"The Wandering Earth"|"Liu Cixin"
00:00|midnight|"That night, while some had already gone to sleep and others were playing a game of poker, Ah Quan and Lu Hai went out. They were off to a small, nearby tearoom to watch some TV. At midnight, the news came on. The screen showed only the anchor speaking; there where no other graphics or footage."|"The Wandering Earth"|"Liu Cixin"

"ap 04:00"|"four o'clock"|"By the time Ah Quan finally returned home it was already four o'clock. As he lay down on his cramped bunk, the China Sun was still shining through his window, illuminating the real estate ads tacked to the wall above his pillow."|"The Wandering Earth"|"Liu Cixin"

I will do it before midnight, today. Please prepare to confirm its completion.” As he finished, he stepped out of the truck and began to walk away."|"The Wandering Earth"|"Liu Cixin"
01:00|"100 hours"|"The flash would not even have that great of an effect on the rest of the Solar System. Mercury would probably dissolve, while the dense atmosphere of Venus would likely be stripped to nothing. The effect on the more distant planets would be even less severe. It could be expected that the surface of Mars would melt, likely scorching its color from red to black. As for Earth, its surface would only be heated to 7,000 degrees, probably for no longer than 100 hours or so. The planet's oceans would certainly evaporate. On dry land, strata of continental rock would liquefy, but that would be that."|"The Wandering Earth"|"Liu Cixin"
"< 12:00"|"almost noon"|"But the old man didn’t hold a grudge. Every time, after the god picked up the board and put the pieces back quietly, he sat down and played with him again – and the whole process was repeated. After a few cycles of this, both of them were tired, and it was almost noon."|"The Wandering Earth"|"Liu Cixin"
12:00|noon|"While the god washed the vegetables, Qiusheng’s father left to visit the neighbors. This was the most peaceful part of the god’s day. The noon sun filled every crack in the brick-lined yard and illuminated the deep crevasses in his memory. During such periods the god often forgot his work and stood quietly, lost in thought. Only when the noise of the villagers returning from the fields filled the air would he be startled awake and hurry to finish his washing."|"The Wandering Earth"|"Liu Cixin"
12:00|midday|"The objects spread out evenly across the dome of the sky. In the dusk, each reflected the light of the setting sun―already below the horizon―and each shone as bright as the full moon. The light turned Earth’s surface as bright as midday. But the light came from every direction and left no shadow, as though the whole world was illuminated by a giant surgical lamp."|"The Wandering Earth"|"Liu Cixin"
12:00|noon|"Qiusheng went over the ancient stone arched bridge and walked towards the tents of the gods. He saw that a few of the gods had set up a pot to cook something in the grassy clearing strewn with golden leaves. Their white beards and the white steam coming out of the pot reflected the noon sunlight like a scene out of an ancient myth."|"The Wandering Earth"|"Liu Cixin"
