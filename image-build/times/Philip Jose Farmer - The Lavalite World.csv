15:12|15:12|"Kickaha licked his own sandpaper lips and swallowed. He brought the wristwatch, which he'd borrowed from Anana, close to his eyes. He pressed the minute stud on its side, and four glowing figures appeared briefly on the face. They were the numerical signs of the Lords. In Earth numerals, 15:12. They did not mean anything here. There was no sun; the sky provided light and some heat. In any event, this planet had no steady rotation on any one plane, and there were no stars. The great reddish mass that had moved slowly across the sky, becoming larger every day, was no genuine moon. It was a temporary satellite, and it was falling."|"The Lavalite World"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
00:00|midnight|"Kickaha picked up a foreleg and suggested that the others bring along a part, too. ""We might need a midnight snack. I wouldn't recommend eating the meat after that. In this heat meat is going to spoil fast."""|"The Lavalite World"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
12:00|noon|"Apparently, the water level was not going to rise higher. Not for a while, anyway. After filling his belly and washing his body, he slogged through knee-deep water along the base of the mountain. In an hour he'd gotten by that and was walking on a plain. About ""noon"" the plain was tilting to one side, about ten degrees to the horizontal, and the water was running down it. Three hours later, it was beginning to tilt the other way. He ate the rest of the mud puppy and threw the bones, with much meat attached, on the ground. Scarlet crows settled down on it to dispute about the tidbits."|"The Lavalite World"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
"~ 02:00"|"About two in the morning"|"Vannax became so troublesome that Paul forced him to leave. About two in the morning, he caught Vannax in his apartment. His crescent was lying on the floor, and so was another."|"The Lavalite World"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
12:00|noon|"At ""noon,"" when the sky-illumination was brightest, the caravan stopped. Everybody, including the prisoners, ate. Then they lay down with skins over their faces to shut out the light, and they slept. About six stayed awake to be lookouts. These had slept for several hours on travois, though when they woke up they looked as if they hadn't gotten a wink of sleep."|"The Lavalite World"|"Philip Jose Farmer"

12:00|noon|"At ""noon"" the following day the two mountains forming the pass to the sea seemed to be very close. But she knew that distance was deceiving here. It might take two more days before the pass was reached. Apparently the tribe knew how far away it was. The beasts wouldn't make it to the sea before they became weak with hunger."|"The Lavalite World"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
00:00|midnight|"Urthona and McKay crawled out of their respective leantos. Anana signaled to them. She stood up and walked through the dark reddish light of ""midnight"" until she was far enough away from the sentinel-platform to see its occupant. He was lying down, flat on his back. Whether he was asleep or not she couldn't determine, but she suspected he was. He was supposed to stay on his feet and scan the surrounding woods until relieved."|"The Lavalite World"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
12:00|noon|"""Dawn"" came with the first paling of the bands in the sky. As the light increased, they continued. They stopped only to excrete or to drink from the sea and to allow their beasts to quench their thirst. At dusk they went into the woods. Finding a hollow surrounded by trees, they slept in it most of the night through. They were wakened several times by the howling of dogs and roars of big cats. However, no predators came near. At ""dawn"" they resumed their journey. At ""noon,"" they came to the place which would lead them up to the pass."|"The Lavalite World"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
12:00|noon|"By noon the first of the hunters came into view. They drew steadily though slowly nearer as the day passed."|"The Lavalite World"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
12:00|noon|"By noon the next day their bellies were growling like starving lions in a cage outside which was a pile of steaks. Kickaha said, ""We'll have to go hunting, Anana, before we get too weak. We can always run this down again, though I hate to think of it. If we could make a rope with a grapnel, we might be able to get up to that balcony above us. Perhaps the door there isn't locked. Why should it be?"""|"The Lavalite World"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
