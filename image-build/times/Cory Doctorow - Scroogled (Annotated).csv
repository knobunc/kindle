but by the time he’d made it to the front of the customs line, it
was after midnight. He’d emerged from first class, brown as a nut,
unshaven, and loose-limbed after a month on the beach in Cabo
(scuba diving three days a week, seducing French college girls the
rest of the time). When he’d left the city a month before, he’d
been a stoop-shouldered, potbellied wreck. Now he was a bronze god,
drawing admiring glances from the stews at the front of the
cabin."|"Scroogled (Annotated)"|"Cory Doctorow"

stood forlornly by the baggage carousel. He picked them up and saw
they had been opened and carelessly closed. Clothes stuck out from
around the edges."|"Scroogled (Annotated)"|"Cory Doctorow"

girlfriend named Laurie who’d put up with anything except being

bringing the screen to life. He squinted at the flashing toolbar

silently by the door. The other was a smiler, short and rumpled, in
a sport coat with a stain on one lapel and a American flag on the
other. “Greg Lupinski, we have reason to believe you’re in
violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,” he said, by way of
introduction. “Specifically, exceeding authorized access, and by
means of such conduct having obtained information. Ten years for a
first offense. Turns out that what you and your friend did to your
Google records qualifies as a felony. And oh, what will come out in
the trial… all the stuff you whitewashed out of your profile, for
starters.”"|"Scroogled (Annotated)"|"Cory Doctorow"
