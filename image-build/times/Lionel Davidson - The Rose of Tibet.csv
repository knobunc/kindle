"ap ~ 03:45"|"about a quarter to four"|"And this was just as well; for on the afternoon before Christmas Eve, another Friday, when he was only mildly drunk, he had received a visitor. Stahl had telephoned first, at about a quarter to four; and at a quarter past his black chauffeur-driven Bentley had pulled up outside in the rain."|"The Rose of Tibet"|"Lionel Davidson"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"The shadow was shifting from the courtyard when they came out of the monastery, and the sun was higher over the lake. It was just on eight o’clock, and their first job was over."|"The Rose of Tibet"|"Lionel Davidson"
12:00|noon|"As it was, owing to the limitations of Hind 4,000 they had arrived in Yamdring on the first day of the spring festival; and this seemed to Ringling nothing but the very best of good fortune, for it lasted in all for seven days, and on each one of them the crowds in the village increased. He could thus snoop to his heart’s content, without attracting undue attention, and he did so. For each of the first three days, he settled Houston in the line of beggars in the courtyard, and went busily about his inquiries, returning only to see that Houston got his free issue of tsampa at noon."|"The Rose of Tibet"|"Lionel Davidson"
"> 03:00"|"shortly after three in the morning"|"It was then shortly after three in the morning, and the Oracle, a young woman whose abnormal psychic qualities in no way interfered with her quite normal physical ones, had been in her cell for six hours. Little Daughter went discreetly ahead to see that she was in it alone."|"The Rose of Tibet"|"Lionel Davidson"
12:00|noon|"On the morning when the governor could still smile in his sleep, his proclamation was posted. It was posted inside the monastery and out, and all that day runners carried it throughout the province. By noon, when the first of the nine canonical masses began, several thousand people had managed to squeeze in to participate. By evening, thousands more were addressing their prayers through the new trulku."|"The Rose of Tibet"|"Lionel Davidson"
12:00|midday|"The duke arrived early, with only a small retinue, and by midday was bearing Houston back with him to his mansion at Ganzing. Houston sat beside him in a double palanquin on the journey, deeply bewildered, and for this reason at first mistook the obeisance that was being offered on all sides as respect due to his companion. But he could not mistake it when, in the country, relays of men and women began running beside the palanquin, braving the blows of the outriders for the privilege of kissing his feet."|"The Rose of Tibet"|"Lionel Davidson"
02:00|"two o’clock in the morning"|"It was two o’clock in the morning before he left, a nightmarish, drunken departure in heavy frost, made memorable by a single touching moment; for at the very last, amid a hideous confusion of wailing wives and lurching servants, he had spotted that the governor’s youngest wife was not in place, and had himself stormed into the house to seek her out."|"The Rose of Tibet"|"Lionel Davidson"
"< 12:00"|"before midday"|"They shot the bridge before midday, passing swiftly beneath and seeing not a soul; and with this link with caravan routes and possible pursuers behind him, he began to feel a certain swelling confidence. Someone, after all, had to lead. It was not a duty calling for years of scouting experience; simply one of convenience so that one voice should speak and the rest follow. There was plenty of skilled assistance. Several of the guards had tracking experience, and all twelve of them were well-armed. He had merely to get them to the mountains of the south, and once there to pick a route to the east that would bring them from an unexpected angle into the Chumbi valley."|"The Rose of Tibet"|"Lionel Davidson"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"From the river bank the stretch of country facing them had appeared flat; but in less than an hour its true nature became plain. It was covered entirely, and very closely, by a series of wearying hillocks of sandy rock. The wind came up at ten o’clock, after they had been going four hours. It was a dry, cold, dust-laden wind, peculiarly hateful, and they took shelter in the lee of boulders and made tea and waited for it to die down."|"The Rose of Tibet"|"Lionel Davidson"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"The wind did not die down. It went on all day (stopping abruptly at sunset and starting up again punctually at ten the next morning, as though some gigantic machine had been switched on and off in the mountains). They waited an hour, and went on, noses and mouths muffled and eyes goggled against the dry spray, their faces at first raw and then merely numb from the incessant blast. With the hearse-like palanquin in their midst they picked their way through the geological debris like a party of mourners in a valley of bones."|"The Rose of Tibet"|"Lionel Davidson"
12:00|noon|"By noon the following day, they were in the foot hills. They camped that night in the shelter of a frozen waterfall. There was no wood to burn, and they cooked with butter lamps. The cold was intense, but Houston felt it less than on the outward trip, for on the governor’s advice he was wearing under his clothes a shift of silk."|"The Rose of Tibet"|"Lionel Davidson"
"< 12:00"|"towards noon"|"He confessed this towards noon as they were proceeding along a broad defile; and shortly afterwards they saw the monastery. It was a tiny place perched like a bird’s nest in the angle of two sheer rock faces far above them, approached evidently by a flight of rock steps that began at some point beyond their line of vision."|"The Rose of Tibet"|"Lionel Davidson"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"By three o’clock the boy had not returned, and Houston found himself in something of a quandary. They were in an unsuitable spot for camping the night. It would be dark in an hour or so. There had been some other spots that he had marked as suitable."|"The Rose of Tibet"|"Lionel Davidson"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"The dirty grey light was brightening outside. He thought he would give it till eight o’clock, and if nothing happened, move on, leaving two men to wait and to follow them with news."|"The Rose of Tibet"|"Lionel Davidson"

"ap 06:30"|six-thirty|"Houston heard nothing the next day. He walked about the town again with the boy, and made half a dozen charcoal sketches. The boy was delighted. But there was still no word from the mysterious Sangrab when he returned to the hotel.
Michaelson appeared angrily at six-thirty.
‘I hear that little sodling hasn’t condescended to see you yet.’"|"The Rose of Tibet"|"Lionel Davidson"
"ap > 07:00"|"after seven o’clock"|"He had the bath, and the drink, and a few more after it, and went reluctantly out into the square. He had left it a bit late for the Tibetans. No use after seven o’clock, Michaelson had said. It was getting on for that, the lamps going on above the stalls. He was sick of the place suddenly, sick of all the places, sick of himself. But he walked across the square, and continued walking stolidly even when a small brown bombshell erupted at his side."|"The Rose of Tibet"|"Lionel Davidson"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"He heard eight o’clock strike from the Scottish mission church. Only an hour since the boy had first told him. Then nine o’clock struck, and ten. He lay there all night.

"ap 07:30"|Seven-thirty|"His voice was showing a tendency to boom, and he thought he might be overdoing it, but the clerk seemed to notice nothing out of the ordinary.
‘Seven-thirty, sahib. Gielle-Khola.’
‘That’s it,’ Houston said; and went out to tell the boy."|"The Rose of Tibet"|"Lionel Davidson"
"ap > 01:00"|"after one o’clock"|"They reached the Sikkim border soon after one o’clock, and dismounted and walked along parallel with it for some time. Apart from an occasional sign in two languages there was no indication that this was the frontier. The boy was somewhat nervous, however; he said observers were stationed in the hills. Houston thought he saw an occasional flash of glasses from high up in the green mounds, and was prepared to believe him. He had begun, despite his trepidation, to enjoy himself. They were wheeling the bicycles through a lush and rolling pasture; the fields sparkled with little wild flowers and their scent hung heavily on the air. They had cycled slowly, for Ringling had warned him not to extend himself too much. All the same he could feel the effect of the unusual exercise. He was sweating slightly, and glad of the liberating shorts and the light, short-sleeved bush jacket. He was also very hungry, with an appetite he had not had for weeks; the boy had said they would stop to eat in Sikkim."|"The Rose of Tibet"|"Lionel Davidson"
"ap 01:45"|"quarter to two"|"Houston looked at his watch and saw it was a quarter to two. So with only the smallest of ceremonies he had crossed his first frontier. The date was 18 April 1950, and he was not due to recross it again for a long time."|"The Rose of Tibet"|"Lionel Davidson"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"They came out of the valley to an extraordinary spectacle. Beyond, the green hills rose in tiers; gigantic folds of land that dipped and fell as far as the eye could see like some petrified ocean. Houston’s heart sank. It was now five o’clock and they had been going, with only a short break, for six hours. He said, ‘How much farther are we riding today?’"|"The Rose of Tibet"|"Lionel Davidson"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"The few miles more took another three hours; it was eight o’clock, dark and chill, when they stopped for the night beside a small river. Houston practically fell off the bicycle. He sat sullenly on the turf, every bone in his body aching, while the boy went busily about his tasks. He fetched water for tea from the river, and boiled it on a small spirit stove. He opened a tin of meat and laid out the sleeping bags. He brought more water in a collapsible rubber bucket and offered it to Houston."|"The Rose of Tibet"|"Lionel Davidson"
"ap 05:00"|five|"Ringling roused him at five the next morning, and he got up immediately. He had already been half awake; despite his intense fatigue he had slept only fitfully. It was grey and misty, the grass wet, the water, fifty yards away, invisible. He washed in the bucket and rinsed out his mouth, and they breakfasted on the remainder of the meat and a few rings of dried apple."|"The Rose of Tibet"|"Lionel Davidson"
"ap 05:30"|"half past five"|"The boy packed everything while Houston attended to the needs of nature and by half past five they were awheel again. His backside was acutely tender and every inch of his frame seemed to creak, but once he had settled himself in position, he got on well enough. There was a certain fascination in bicycling through the mist at this hour in this high place; as last night, he was keenly aware of his geographical location and hungry to pile on mileage. He was also eager to see what kind of country they were in. They had climbed steadily since leaving the river valley, and he thought they were climbing now; he had become so accustomed to the pressure on the pedals that he could not tell precisely."|"The Rose of Tibet"|"Lionel Davidson"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"The mist began lifting at nine o’clock, but so slowly that Houston was disappointed by what he saw. The mountains were a vague jumble of hazy white peaks, with the slightly higher peak of Kanchenjunga. By eleven, however, the mist had lifted entirely. The sun shone from a high blue sky, and the hazy teeth of the mountains became sharp; first white, then pink, then gold, then white again. Houston’s heart sang, watching these fantastic ramparts, as they cycled slowly towards them."|"The Rose of Tibet"|"Lionel Davidson"

"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"Houston realized something was wrong with him at eight o’clock. They had pitched the tent on a bit of level ground between boulders at 14,000 feet. Ringling had turned in as soon as they had eaten, and had gone to sleep immediately. Houston lay listening to him. He was numb with cold and his head ached. His chest ached also. It had been giving him trouble since early afternoon. He thought he had strained it during the climb, and presently tried to sit up to get into a more comfortable position."|"The Rose of Tibet"|"Lionel Davidson"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"At five o’clock Ringling boiled a pan of snow for tea, and fed the mule, and they had a mess of tsampa (barley flour) in the tea that he had bought in the village.

They went quickly, keeping to their own tracks, and by half past eleven had come to their camp of the previous night. Ringling did not stop. He ate a handful of dry tsampa, and butted the mule threateningly with his elbow when it turned its head to look at him. But presently he relented and gave the animal a handful, too, for it had carried the deadweight of Houston unprotestingly."|"The Rose of Tibet"|"Lionel Davidson"
12:00|midday|"They stopped for the day on a rock ledge at twelve thousand feet. Ringling thought they must have left Tibet, but did not know precisely or even care. He was exhausted and worried, and he hurried to get the tent up. Houston had fallen off the mule when they stopped, and was lying on his side, back and front already thickly encrusted with snow. It had started to snow at midday, and despite the rising wind and the cold had continued."|"The Rose of Tibet"|"Lionel Davidson"

04:00|"four o’clock in the morning"|"He turned out, bleakly. It was four o’clock in the morning. The wind sucked and moaned like a vacuum cleaner at the mouth of the cave. The small lamp was lit and the boy had the spirit stove going. Houston was shrivelled in the sudden deathly cold, and he pulled on his boots and his quilted jacket, stumbling about in the dim light of the cave. He rinsed out his mouth with melted snow and rolled up his bedding and sat huddled on it while he drank his tea and tsampa."|"The Rose of Tibet"|"Lionel Davidson"
15:00|"three o’clock in the afternoon"|"This was the last ascent of the outward journey. From Kotchin-la the track fell – slowly at first, and then very rapidly. They turned in at three o’clock in the afternoon, under a rock overhang, too exhausted even to put up the tent. Houston dozed and woke, in his sleeping bag, several times, coming to so feebly that he had to ride the mule all day."|"The Rose of Tibet"|"Lionel Davidson"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"He remembered sitting on his rolled bedding that evening waiting for the tea to boil, but had no recollection of drinking it, and next came to to find himself in the sleeping bag with the feeling that weights had been removed from his chest and that he had slept a long time.

"~ 12:00"|"about midday"|"The snow stopped at about midday, and the soldiers came over the edge soon after. Houston watched them from behind a boulder. He had not managed to get down to the river, but had taken cover some minutes earlier, aware that the snow was petering out and that he must allow for their most recent tracks to be covered. He could no longer see the red mess of the horse, but could not be sure that it was not visible from above."|"The Rose of Tibet"|"Lionel Davidson"
"ap > 01:00"|"after one o’clock"|"They found the horse soon after one o’clock, and the officer had himself lowered immediately. Houston saw them digging under the horse, and observed the officer’s growing agitation as nothing came to light.

"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"At four o’clock (breathing on his watch to clear the ice) he heard the loudhailer going again, and chancing another look, saw that ropes were being lowered to draw the men back up the cliff face. By half past, all were up, and there was no further sight or sound of the party. He stayed where he was. It would be dark in half an hour. It must be obvious to the Chinese that they were on the slope somewhere. The bales had been taken from the horse, and there had been insufficient time for them to get down to the river. He thought that if he were the Chinese officer he would himself have called off the search and quietly stationed observers to watch."|"The Rose of Tibet"|"Lionel Davidson"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"It was getting on for eight o’clock before they found the negotiable stretch of river; the banks widened here, the beach was broader, the water, evidently, shallower. Massive rocks stood out of the bed, and about their tops was wreathed the debris of the spring floods. The boy anchored himself by rope to the horse and waded out. Houston glimpsed him, through the spray pulling down a branch from a rock and trying to plumb the depth. He returned, soaked."|"The Rose of Tibet"|"Lionel Davidson"
"< 00:00"|"towards midnight"|"They cut across the track, the boy going surely now, for he had travelled this country before, and went across rough hills before choosing, towards midnight, a secondary track, a mere gutter between high cliffs, but one that went due east."|"The Rose of Tibet"|"Lionel Davidson"

The medical monk had carried her out of the cave, and back in it, and was now outside with her again. He had tried arak and douches of icy water, and also the fire, which had been recently made up. None of these methods seemed to have worked and as Houston watched, the man took a rest. He accepted a cigarette from the picket and sat by the fire with him, chatting, the naked body of Little Daughter alongside like some scarred stranded whale, the mule, heavily blanketed, dozing near by."|"The Rose of Tibet"|"Lionel Davidson"

All present. He tried to stir himself to get up, but could not stir himself. He was not sleepy; merely full of an immense lassitude. He looked about him and saw it was not a cave, but a big overhang; the first place the boy must have found. It was a dangerous place. It was too dangerous a place for them to stay. He fell asleep thinking how dangerous it was."|"The Rose of Tibet"|"Lionel Davidson"

They rose at seven, as they had done in the monastery, and washed and ate, and then while the girl, after setting their home to rights, embarked upon the ritual of prayer and mental exercise that had always made up her day, Houston went out on his wood-collecting and trap-setting labours."|"The Rose of Tibet"|"Lionel Davidson"
"ap 07:30"|"half past seven"|"Houston regarded this period, which was from the third week of January to the end of February, as one of the most rewarding of his life. The routine very quickly developed into a most regular and pleasing pattern. He would leave sharp on half past seven, punctual as some clerk going up to the city. He would climb the steps into the chorten, and pick up his sled, and nod familiarly to the bones of the holy hermit, and go out into it. The more horrible the weather, the greater his feeling of virtue. In all the seventeen weeks he did not come face to face with another soul; and for the first five of them was never happier."|"The Rose of Tibet"|"Lionel Davidson"

He carried the pistol in his hand as he walked, for he carried it with him now wherever he went. He had still not lost hope that some animal might be moving, and that Providence might set it in his path. And on that day, 17 March, at about eleven o’clock, Providence did."|"The Rose of Tibet"|"Lionel Davidson"

"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"It was a very old bear, a hungry one. Houston calculated later that it had not eaten enough before hibernation, and had awakened early in the savage winter. It had blundered down the mountain looking for a meal.
At eleven o’clock it saw one.

He was booked in at 5 p.m. on 30 April 1951 – the first independently checkable date since he had booked out of the town rather more than a year before."|"The Rose of Tibet"|"Lionel Davidson"
