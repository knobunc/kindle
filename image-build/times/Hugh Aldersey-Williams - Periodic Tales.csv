"> 20:00"|"Shortly after eight in the evening"|"The redistribution of wealth and power was also one objective of the Carbonari, revolutionary precursors of the Risorgimento that would lead to the unification of Italy in 1871. They began as a secret society in the Kingdom of Naples, formed to resist French occupation during the Napoleonic Wars, taking their name from the Italian for charcoal burner, carbonaro. Their flag was red, blue and black for charcoal, only later becoming the red, white and green of modern Italy. The impulses of the Carbonari were patriotic, liberal and secular. After the defeat of Napoleon, they directed their efforts against their new overlords, the Austrians and the allied Papal States. The movement spread and, in 1820, after a number of failed uprisings, the Carbonari staged patriotic rebellions in several Italian cities. Shortly after eight in the evening of Friday 8 December 1820, the poet Lord Byron, then living in Ravenna, was caught up in one of these dramas when a powerful local Carbonari chief was assassinated. In Don Juan, he describes – ‘This is a fact, and no poetic fable’ – how he heard shots and ran out of his home to find the man lying in the street: ‘for some reason, surely bad, / They had slain him with five slugs’. Though he distances himself from the crime – ‘The man was gone: in some Italian quarrel’ – Byron was himself active in the Carbonari movement, having been elected a capo, and was involved in buying and storing arms."|"Periodic Tales"|"Hugh Aldersey-Williams"
"ap 03:40"|"third of four"|"I found myself assigned to work in a laboratory led by a pipe-smoking figure with the windblown stride of Monsieur Hulot. The lab was designated ‘red’, the third of four levels of security. This meant I was cleared for laboratory work on dilute solutions containing plutonium and got to wear canvas overshoes which were good for gliding along the linoleum floors. Immediately, though, I felt a faint envy of those summer students who had been assigned to work in ‘purple’, the areas of highest security. The objective was to see how plutonium might be absorbed in material which could then be turned into blocks of glass. This vitrifying was thought to be a promising way to secure the waste for disposal by means and in locations never discussed. My experiment was always the same and involved pouring solutions of ‘ploot’ into columns containing the white titanium sand that was the raw material for the glass. I had no real sense of the dangers as I carried flasks of the radioactive liquid back and forth. It didn’t glow green as it does in The Simpsons, nor did I find myself carelessly leaving work with test tubes of it stuffed in my pockets as Homer Simpson does at the Springfield reactor. (I don’t recall ever being searched either.) My abiding memory is of the quiet tedium as the summer days slipped by while I transferred endless readings from the columns of sand into columns of figures on musty government stationery. It was the only time I worked in a laboratory."|"Periodic Tales"|"Hugh Aldersey-Williams"
"ap 02:40"|"third of three"|"Belcher’s Sulphur, a ten-gun bomb vessel, was the third of three Royal Navy ships of that name. The first of them already bore this curious name when the navy bought it from its American owners in 1778. I have been unable to discover a specific reason for its chemical christening. I suppose that it was simply regarded as a suitable sign of belligerence since the second HMS Sulphur, purchased in 1797, took part in the Battle of Copenhagen alongside sister ships named Volcano, Explosion and Terror. Like the second, the third Sulphur was equipped with mortars that were able to lob explosive shells or ‘bombs’ forward from the bow rather than simply firing cannon from the sides. This capability was to be put to use when the ship was sidetracked from its scientific mission into military conflict with China during the First Opium War."|"Periodic Tales"|"Hugh Aldersey-Williams"
"~ 15:00"|"about 15"|"Take a Quantity of Urine (not less for one Experiment than 50 or 60 Pails full); let it lie steeping in one or more tubs, or an Hogshead of oaken Wood, till it putrify and breed Worms, as it will do in 14 or 15 days. Then, in a large kettle, set some of it to boil on a strong Fire, and, as it consumes and evaporates, pour in more, and so on, till, at last, the whole Quantity be reduced to a Paste, or rather a hard Coal, or Crust, which it will resemble; and this may be done in two or three Days, if the Fire be well tended, but else it may be doing a Fortnight or more. Then take the said Paste, or Coal; powder it, and add thereto some fair Water, about 15 Fingers high, or four Times as high as the Powder; and boil them together for ¼ of an Hour. Then strain the Liquor and all through a woollen Cloth; that which sticks behind, may be thrown away, but the Liquor that passes must be taken and boil’d till it come to a Salt, which it will be in a few Hours."|"Periodic Tales"|"Hugh Aldersey-Williams"
