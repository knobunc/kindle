stand straight and six feet tall, a fine figure of a man, though twenty (Dr.
Van Ness will say thirty) pounds underweight. It is important, going to the
doctor. Even in some mad way more important than a board meeting. As I dress in
the morning, I remind myself that I will be undressing not, as usual, for bed,
but in the doctor’s office. It is a little like knowing I am going to be with a strange woman, and I shower after shaving and
choose new shorts and undershirt and socks. At one-thirty I enter the
Cassionsville and Kanakessee Valley Bank Building through bronze doors, more bronze doors to
the elevator, and a glass door for the waiting room where five people sit listening
to Glinka’s A Life for the Czar. They
are Margaret Lorn, Ted Singer, Abel Green, and Sherry Gold. And me. We are
reading magazines, and the magazines are Life,
Look, Today’s Health, and Water World.
Two of us are reading Life. Different
issues, of course, and I am one of these readers, the other being Margaret
Lorn. There is (as a matter of fact) a whole pile of Lifes before me, and I play the old game of trying to arrange them
chronologically without looking at the dates, and lose. Margaret tosses down
her copy and goes in to see the doctor, and I know, somehow, that this is a
mark of contempt. I pick it up and find an area of the cover that is still warm
(and slightly damp) from her hands. A nurse comes to the window and asks for
Mrs. Price, and Sherry, who is sixteen now, tells her that she has already gone
in, and the nurse looks aggrieved."|Peace|"Gene Wolfe"

he was gone. Can you tell time, young Weer?”"|Peace|"Gene Wolfe"

before. We visited Macafee’s, and most particularly that part of the store—the Morgan Street side of the second floor—which dealt in

it, my aunt told me, she would, on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons between the

I thought it might not be a real watch at all, but only a saucer of bright
metal—perhaps the cover of an old watch—that Mr. Blaine carried now because his
real one had broken. Save for the smoothly rounded edges it could have been a
gold coin. “It’s nearly half after six. I can’t send you away from my door now,

could see in the dark as well as any. ‘If this is the Earthly Paradise, where’s
the cream? Devil a thing do I see but a big pine tree with a sign on it.’ The
king of the rats, that had joined them on the way for’rd, says, ‘And what does

the cat jumped off the boat and sat on a stone and thought about what time the
cows would be milked, and at last she
said, ‘How long until five?’ and the rat laughed, but Brandon said, ‘Twenty
thousand years.’ ‘Then I’m going back to Ireland where it’s light,’ says the cat. ‘You are
that,’ says Brandon, ‘but not for some time,’ and he jumped off the boat and set up a
cross on the beach. Then the boat sank and the king of the rats swam ashore. ‘ ’Twas
stone all along,’ said he. ‘That it was,’ says Brandon, ‘in places.’ ‘Shall I kill the cat now?’
says the king of the rats, and the cat says, ‘Here, now, what’s this?’ ‘It’s
death to you,’ says the rat, ‘for all you cats are fey heathen creatures, as
all the world knows, and it’s the duty of a Christian rat to take you off the
board as may be, particularly as it was for that purpose I was sent by the High
King at Tara.’ Then the two began to fight, all up and down the beach, and just
then an angel—or somebody—come out of the woods and asked Brandon what was going on. ’ ‘Tis a good brawl, isn’t
it,’ says the saint. ‘Yes, but who are they?’ ‘Well, the one is wickedness,’
says Brandon, ‘and the other’a fairy cat; and I brought
the both of them out from Ireland with me, and now I’m watchin’ to see which

"ap > 07:00"|"after seven o’clock"|"“There
was a drugstore all right, and the thing that surprised me was that it was already
open, though it wasn’t much after seven o’clock. I thought most likely someone had to have
medicine in a hurry for a sick relative and had gone and got the pharmacist and
made him open the shop; then maybe he’d figured since it was already light out
and he was up and dressed, he’d just keep the place open. Well, you can believe
I didn’t wait to get any breakfast. I just went right direct in after I
straightened my tie and brushed my suit a little."|Peace|"Gene Wolfe"

about half an hour he asked me if I knew my way around well enough to keep the
shop open without him. I said I did, and he said that in that case he was going
home, and for me to keep the place open until eight, and then to come over to
his house, and he’d show me where I could sleep. He wrote out the address for
me on a slip of paper and gave me directions how to get there; it was only
about five blocks away. I gave him about an hour to get off and be doing
whatever it was he was going to do; then I locked the store for a minute—he had
given me the keys so I could lock up at night—and nipped over to the depot to
get my Gladstone, which I had left there and was worried about. After that I
stayed right in the store."|Peace|"Gene Wolfe"

got to be about six o’clock and Mr. T. came back—not wearing his white coat
like he had been, but one of those black suits and a little ribbon for a
necktie, like so many of them do down there. He asked if I’d had any supper
yet, and when I said I hadn’t he asked if I would be willing to go by the
grocery and pick up a few things for him so we could have supper at home. I
said I would, and he gave me ten dollars and a little list he had written out;
and he told me not to wait until eight because the grocery would be closed by
then, but to go over now and get the things and meet him at his house. He said
he’d close up the store for me."|Peace|"Gene Wolfe"

told him I wouldn’t, it being against my principles, but that I’d be honored to
have a wholesome beverage in his company while he treated himself to whatever
he fancied; so we went downstairs—back to the dining room. Mr. T. got the
brandy bottle and a glass out of the sideboard there, and I squeezed some of
the oranges for myself and added a hunk of ice from the box, and I can tell you
I wouldn’t have traded that drink for
just about anything, because it was nearly ninety degrees—that’s what I saw on
a thermometer somebody’d hung up in the kitchen—though it was past midnight."|Peace|"Gene Wolfe"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"“I
went and got his pencil for him after that, as you may imagine, and we went
down to the store and opened up. It was pretty near to ten o’clock by that
time, and I wondered for a bit why it was Mr. T. had been open so early the day
before, but of course it was that woman—the one without arms. She hadn’t just
happened to come by then; that had been all arranged, and Mr. T.’d had her
prescription ready and waiting for her, knowing she’d come by early like that.
I thought about it some more and concluded she’d probably wanted it to be when
there wasn’t many people on the street to see her.”"|Peace|"Gene Wolfe"

eleven-thirty Mr. T. told me, without giving any reason for it, that he was
going home and would see me again in a few hours. Well, that was fine with me;
to tell the truth, it made me a little nervous to have him about when I was
working. It made me think of the ghost, and I got to noticing how he never bent
or picked anything up that was down low, and how he turned his whole body,
shuffling around his feet, when another person would have just turned his head."|Peace|"Gene Wolfe"

a mess when you find a dead person like that,” he said. “Especially a dead
person that nobody thought was sick. I’ve tried since to remember how many
nights I spent in his house before he died. I think it was five. It was the
fifth night. I got up like I usually did and went downstairs and started
coffee, then came back up to my own room and shaved. The ghost had been walking
the night before, and I had laid in bed listening to it. Up and down the hall,
mostly; sometimes up and down the front and back steps. I had bought a lock for
my room and locked myself in at night, so I wasn’t too worried about it, and
besides it had never shown any wish to harm me."|Peace|"Gene Wolfe"

father was so unlike him that, after visiting his shop, I concluded that my
original impression of their relationship was mistaken. The elder Gold was a
bookman—so much so that I, who have been considered bookish ever since
receiving my first green-bound volume of fairy tales, was a trifle repelled by
it. Louis A. Gold had his name lettered (in gold leaf, appropriately) in the
window of a store that until a few months before had sold shoes; and the
lettering had instantly gone from bright newness to an antique patina that
might have graced the Great Chalice of Antioch. Dust settled on the glass, as bats in the tropics settle upon
certain fruit trees, and half the fluorescent tubes in the light fixtures
extinguished themselves at once, while the rest were obscured by tall stacks of
books, books Gold brought from God knows where, many of them worthless outdated
popular novels, though there were strange and interesting books as well: the
technical works of little-known sciences; forgotten and eccentric tales; old
books of verse; and the reminiscences of vanished circles of wits (of famous
men who were known largely to each other, and who met, when they met at all, at
enamel-topped tables in the cheap restaurants of New York, and talked mostly
about jokes played after midnight in the corridors of second-rate hotels)."|Peace|"Gene Wolfe"

your reporter visited the hotel, and, with the concurrence of the management,
occupied a room on the fourteenth floor. I found my accommodations as pleasant
and commodious a domicile as the hotel’s advertising and that sometimes more
reliable guide, the word-of-mouth report of the city, had led me to expect. Two
windows opened on a capacious air-shaft to admit copious sunlight. The
furniture and carpet were new, the bed was of the most modern design, and the
bath, whose all-enamel tub boasted ball-claw feet and stood upon a floor of
sparkling-white hexagonal tiles, was the most modern I have seen. After a light
supper in one of the hotel’s excellent restaurants, I prepared my room for the
vigil I would keep all that night, placing a pair of large candles on the
chiffonier, another pair upon the windowsill of the room, and four upon the
posts of the bed, where I attached them by their own wax to the elegant knobs that
served there as terminals. When all were lit, I made the experiment of turning
out the electric lights, and satisfied myself that at eleven o’clock—when, as its custom is (both for the safety
of its patrons and to encourage regularity of hours), the hotel should
extinguish the electricity—I would not want for light. It yet lacked two hours
of that time, and I amused myself with a book (one of cheerful character, the
reader may be assured!) until the preliminary blinking of the electric bulbs
warned me to make haste to relight my candles. I did so, set my volume aside,
and began my watch in earnest."|Peace|"Gene Wolfe"

tell who else is in there with you, or if anyone is, and it’s full of catwalks,
