In A Study in Scarlet, Holmes judges a suspect to be quite tall by measuring the unusual distance between the left and right footprints, that is, the stride. Height can be corroborated by measuring the length of the foot impression: Generally, the foot composes about fifteen percent of an individual’s height. Dividing the length of the bare foot by 0.15 gives a rough estimate of its owner’s stature. (For shoe impressions, which add a bit of length, divide by 0.16.) What’s more, the angle of the feet relative to each other can be significant: “That left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place,” Holmes tells Inspector Lestrade while investigating a crime scene in “The Boscombe Valley Mystery.”"|"The Sherlock Holmes Handbook"|"Ransom Riggs"

[to] leave its orbit.” Mycroft’s rigid schedule is strictly divided between work and leisure time spent at the “Diogenes Club”—from exactly “quarter to five to twenty to eight” each day, Holmes says. Founded by Mycroft himself, the Diogenes Club is described by Holmes as “one of the queerest” in London, founded for men who, “some from shyness, some from misanthropy,. . . [are] the most unsociable and unclubable men in town.” Inside, members peruse “the latest periodicals” alone, in total silence, and “no member is allowed to take the least notice of any other one.” Proof positive, at last, that there were Londoners who loathed society more than Sherlock Holmes himself."|"The Sherlock Holmes Handbook"|"Ransom Riggs"
