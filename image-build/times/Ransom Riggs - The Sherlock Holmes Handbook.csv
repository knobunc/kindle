[to] leave its orbit.” Mycroft’s rigid schedule is strictly divided between work and leisure time spent at the “Diogenes Club”—from exactly “quarter to five to twenty to eight” each day, Holmes says. Founded by Mycroft himself, the Diogenes Club is described by Holmes as “one of the queerest” in London, founded for men who, “some from shyness, some from misanthropy,. . . [are] the most unsociable and unclubable men in town.” Inside, members peruse “the latest periodicals” alone, in total silence, and “no member is allowed to take the least notice of any other one.” Proof positive, at last, that there were Londoners who loathed society more than Sherlock Holmes himself."|"The Sherlock Holmes Handbook"|"Ransom Riggs"
