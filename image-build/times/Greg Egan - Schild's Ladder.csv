Some of us feel that there are matters that have yet to be entirely resolved. We'll begin at half past seven.” The messenger bowed, then froze again, expecting no reply."|"Schild's Ladder"|"Greg Egan"

00:00|midnight|"Time-translation symmetry was the key to all their hopes of predicting how the novo-vacuum would behave. In ordinary physics, if two people performed the same experiment, one starting work at midnight while the other began at noon, their separate versions could be compared, very easily: you merely added or subtracted half a day, and all their data could be superimposed. That sounded too obvious to be worth stating, but the fact that it was possible, and the fact that any laws of physics had to be compatible with this process of sliding the two sequences of events together, was a powerful constraint on the forms such laws could take."|"Schild's Ladder"|"Greg Egan"
