"ap 09:15"|nine-fifteen|"‘Oh, nine-fifteen, something like that. I dropped my daughter off at her school and then just drove straight into town to do some shopping.’"|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
"ap > 03:00"|"after three o’clock"|"‘In fact, you did a whole day’s shopping, is that right, ma’am? You didn’t come back to your car till after three o’clock.’"|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
09:15|"nine-fifteen A.M."|"Aldermann said, ‘It’s hardly likely that these vandals would already have been lurking at nine-fifteen A.M., is it, Sergeant?’"|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
"ap 09:15"|nine-fifteen|"‘No? Of course, you were parked on the roof, weren’t you? The first couple of floors fill up pretty quick with business people, I suppose. But there must still have been a lot of room on the next four floors at nine-fifteen.’"|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"‘And you said all the cars had been parked there by nine o’clock or shortly after?’ persisted Singh."|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
"< 12:00"|"nearly midday"|"‘Let her lick it off,’ she said. ‘It’ll save on her next feed.’
It was nearly midday when the two women left the coffee house.
‘Which way are you going?’ asked Ellie."|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
23:00|"eleven o’clock that night"|"She was still, or rather again, recalcitrant at eleven o’clock that night. Her distant protests were making Pascoe uneasy but Ellie whose ear was now finely tuned to Rose’s various wavelengths diagnosed prima donna bloodymindedness and made him sit still and enjoy his coffee."|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
"ap ~ 09:10"|"About ten past nine"|"‘Yeah, a green Polo. Nice little car.’
‘About ten past nine. We were just going by when it parked.’
‘Tall blonde bit. Middle-aged. Big teeth.’"|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
"ap 03:00"|three|"‘Christ, you don’t hang about! All right. Come before three. That OK? By the way, what was it you were ringing about?’"|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
01:00|one-morning|"They spent the next hour at the burgled house where the m.o. and attendant circumstances seemed exactly the same as Pascoe’s burglaries, right down to the angry householders who as usual were threatening to sue the company who’d sold them their alarm system. The thieves had neutralized this with an expertise which spoke of careful planning. The only unusual feature was that some virginia creeper which covered the wall on which the external alarm bell was set had been torn away and some plants in the flowerbed immediately below were badly crushed, as if someone or something had fallen on them. There were no helpful footprints or anything of that kind but at least it narrowed the limits within which the break-in must have occurred, for though the damage was not apparent to the casual glance, the owner’s one-morning-a-week gardener was able to confirm that the border was untouched when he last called the previous Friday."|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"‘Evensong and choir practice,’ said Capstick, catching the cock of his ear. ‘I did not realize it was so late. Old people never do, Mr Pascoe. I hope I have not spoiled your dinner.’"|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
"ap 08:00"|"Eight o’clock"|"‘That’ll be grand,’ he said. ‘Eight o’clock suit? Right. And why don’t you book us in somewhere nice and cosy to eat to start with? If you leave it to me, you’ll likely end up in a chippy!’"|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
"< 12:00"|"Before midday"|"Before midday, Elgood suggested they ate. Talk had sputtered out, they needed something to do. There was cold chicken and salad and white wine. They ate little, drank a lot. He didn’t set out to get her drunk, he prided himself he had never needed that, and he stopped topping up her glass while she was still well this side of inebriety. But she was more relaxed than she had been since arriving. There was still tension there, he felt as he took her in his arms, but it was the tension of resolve, the nervous novice knowing she can do her duty."|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
04:00|"four A.M."|"‘I’m sorry. I didn’t mean … it’s just that I let things get inside my mind sometimes and rattle round in there and worry myself into the most absurd ideas! You know, just recently I met this woman, purely by chance, and it turned out she was a policeman’s wife. I like her a lot, she’s bright and straightforward, and completely independent, of her husband I mean. And yet the other night I woke up at four A.M. suddenly completely convinced she’d been set on me to spy for the police force! I hate those four o’clock horrors, don’t you? That’s another thing about Patrick, he never has them. Of course, came the dawn, and I could see what a fool I’d been. But that’s the way I’ve been going on lately, like some neurotic!’"|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"

"ap > 05:00"|"shortly after five o’clock"|"The fat man had rung shortly after five o’clock. He had listened in silence to Pascoe’s description of his interrogation of the two boys. His reaction to the news about Elgood and Daphne Aldermann was almost dismissive."|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
"ap 02:30"|two-thirty|"‘None,’ said Pascoe, looking at the report. ‘He died between two-thirty and three-thirty. His wife went out at two-thirty and he wasn’t home then. She came back an hour later and there he was, spread out across the patio at the back of the house.’"|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
"ap 03:30"|three-thirty|"‘None,’ said Pascoe, looking at the report. ‘He died between two-thirty and three-thirty. His wife went out at two-thirty and he wasn’t home then. She came back an hour later and there he was, spread out across the patio at the back of the house.’"|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
20:00|"eight P.M."|"‘Finally, the first two I looked at. Brian Bulmer who crashed his car after the office party last Christmas. Definitely booze there, I’m afraid. No one else involved, no witnesses. He seems to have lost control on black ice and hit a bollard. He was Perfecta’s financial director, remember? And at the beginning of May, Timothy Eagles, the chief accountant and Aldermann’s chief rival for elevation to the board, had a heart attack. He was found in a washroom by the night security guard doing his first rounds at eight P.M. He was dressed for going home. He’d said goodnight to his secretary who’d left dead on time, leaving him to sign a couple of letters. Presumably he then got ready, felt ill, either in the washroom or perhaps made his way there for a drink of water, collapsed and was unfortunately not discovered till too late for medical help.’"|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
"ap 09:30"|nine-thirty|"‘You do? Now, if you’d been in the Market Caff at nine-thirty as arranged, you might just have managed it,’ replied Ellie with spirit."|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
"ap ~ 04:00"|"About four o’clock"|"‘About four o’clock. It started raining cats and dogs; it came sideways in that wind. He shouted that he was off and off he went.’"|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
"ap 04:45"|"four forty-five"|"The Reverend’s corpse had been discovered by the local vicar at four forty-five on his return from the reception of a wedding he’d officiated at earlier in the afternoon. He had arranged to rendezvous with Oliver Somerton at four P.M., but had been delayed."|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
16:00|"four P.M."|"The Reverend’s corpse had been discovered by the local vicar at four forty-five on his return from the reception of a wedding he’d officiated at earlier in the afternoon. He had arranged to rendezvous with Oliver Somerton at four P.M., but had been delayed."|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
"ap 05:30"|"half past five"|"At half past five the phone rang and next moment Dalziel’s stentorian voice was sounding in Pascoe’s ear. After listening to a succinct, pungent, and actionably obscene analysis of the conference so far, Pascoe gave his equally succinct but metaphorically more restrained account of his interviews with Masson and Mrs Burke."|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
"ap 02:30"|two-thirty|"‘Who’s suspicious? Just curious. Another thing. You say she drove down to the shops at two-thirty, came back at three-thirty, walked out of the garage straight on to the patio, and there he was, dead?’"|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
"ap 03:30"|three-thirty|"‘Who’s suspicious? Just curious. Another thing. You say she drove down to the shops at two-thirty, came back at three-thirty, walked out of the garage straight on to the patio, and there he was, dead?’"|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
"ap 02:30"|two-thirty|"‘Burke’s car! I take it them houses just have single garages and driveways? Right, then. If Mrs Burke could back her car out at two-thirty, there wasn’t any other car in the drive was there? And if she could drive back into the garage at three-thirty, there still wasn’t, was there? So where was it?’"|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"

12:00|midday|"Diana was spending the morning with a friend. Daphne was assiduous in making sure that Rosemont’s isolation didn’t mean her daughter’s too, and she’d driven the little girl to the friend’s house shortly after nine. Patrick had rung briefly the previous evening to say he’d be home mid-morning. He had sounded strange, highly charged with some emotion unidentifiable at the end of a very crackly line. The police had also rung and she’d arranged for them to come at midday."|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"With these and similar rock-hard resolutions she sat and passed the time till on the stroke of eleven she heard the front door open. Instantly the rock began to crumble, and suddenly the thin surface of her life seemed quite strong and certainly rigid enough to carry her not unhappily to the grave."|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
"ap 00:00"|"Twelve o’clock"|"Oh Christ! The police! she remembered. But she didn’t say. Twelve o’clock, they had said they would call. She squinted round Patrick’s head at the ormolu clock on the mantelshelf. It was just after eleven. Surely the police wouldn’t be early?"|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
"ap > 11:00"|"just after eleven"|"Oh Christ! The police! she remembered. But she didn’t say. Twelve o’clock, they had said they would call. She squinted round Patrick’s head at the ormolu clock on the mantelshelf. It was just after eleven. Surely the police wouldn’t be early?"|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
"ap 23:50"|"ten to twelve"|"And then as he rolled her over on her back once more her eyes caught the clock face. It was ten to twelve."|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"Saturday had started well for Dick Elgood. At eleven o’clock he had been sitting in his office in the otherwise empty Perfecta building waiting for a visitor."|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
"< 00:00"|"nearly midnight"|"So here they were, waiting. It was nearly midnight. Sunday’s glorious weather had spilled over into Monday morning, but storm clouds had begun to simmer in mid-afternoon and the long midsummer evening had sunk into premature darkness shortly after nine, and into almost total blackness a couple of hours later. Wield had waited for his night vision to develop, but even now the room only existed as a wash of black over some heavier concentrations which marked the furniture. The narrow slit in the curtained window let in no light worth mentioning. It overlooked the east side of the house, which meant that the horizon was smudged with the tangerine glow of city lights, but this only served to accentuate the nearer darkness. In the last hour a strong wind had blown up which so far had failed to clear the sky and had merely served to fill the old house with creaks and groans and eerie flutings, while at the same time whipping the dark mere of the garden into such a frenzy of formless movement that Wield had ceased to peer out, finding his straining eyes were filling the night with advancing shapes."|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
07:00|"seven in the morning"|"‘You could be freezing your bollocks off and sitting around here till six or seven in the morning. As it is, it’ll start getting light around four. You might even get an hour’s sleep before you go back on duty. So count your blessings.’"|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
07:00|"seven A.M."|"‘Right,’ said Dalziel, glancing at the kitchen clock which said seven A.M., ‘let’s get washed up. Always leave a place as you’d hope to find it, you shouldn’t forget that, son.’"|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
"ap > 08:00"|"Just after eight o’clock"|"Just after eight o’clock, they all started, except Dalziel, as they heard a distant noise. It was the grind of an approaching vehicle. Pascoe joined Wield at the window. An old green van was coming up the drive. It turned and disappeared along the side of the house, momentarily revealing the legend Caldicott and Son, Landscape Gardeners."|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"He left the offices of Perfecta at six o’clock, pausing to glance at the old Elgoodware artefacts on display in the vestibule. This is how it had all started. Here were the beginnings of the road which had led him to where he was now. Which was where? He felt uneasy at the thought. It was daft! How could the condition, the achievement, which only a few weeks ago had seemed such a cause for congratulation, for complacency even, now appear hollow, empty, meaningless? Perhaps a man needed more than work. An interest, an obsession. Like Aldermann’s garden and his bloody roses! What did he have? Women, a lot of ’em, more than he could recall. That was something, surely. Pleasure; ecstasy; and more to come. His strength was less than it had been, but far from failing. Perhaps he should have arranged for a bit of company tonight. He thought of telephoning around, but decided it was too late. And surely it was best to stick to his plan."|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
"ap > 10:30"|"after ten-thirty"|"It was after ten-thirty when he arrived at the cottage, much later than he had intended. He felt vaguely dissatisfied as he stood by the white post which marked the furthest encroachment of the sea and gazed down at the darkling shore where a thin white line and a rhythmic susurration signalled the retreating tide. He should have stuck to his original intention and come straight down. Now he would have to forgo his anticipated swim. Food, alcohol and an ebb tide were ingredients which mixed to disaster. And in any case, though usually he regarded the water as simply an alternative element, tonight the moving darkness stretching away to an imperceptible horizon filled him with a sense of menace and being alone. Shivering, he turned and went inside."|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
"> 09:00"|"after nine A.M."|"Shaheed Singh awoke first to the dawn chorus of hospital life and didn’t manage to get back to sleep till after nine A.M. When he opened his eyes an hour later, Dalziel, Pascoe, and Sergeant Wield were standing by his bed."|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"‘Aye. Found drowned. He should’ve been at a meeting at ten, didn’t appear, they got the local bobby to check down at his cottage, and there he was, bobbing around in the sea.’"|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
"ap > 10:00"|"after ten"|"‘What else? You can’t still be thinking of Aldermann? Where’s the motive? That’s all been settled! And opportunity? He’s been away since Monday! And don’t say Sunday night. They left Elgood’s picnic at the same time as us and we asked them to drop in at our place as they passed. One thing led to another, we had a drink and a snack, and it was after ten when they left.’"|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"It was three o’clock when Pascoe arrived at Rosemont and its gardens were still awash with the high tide of the sun. All along the road from town he had driven with his windows down, letting the fresh air cleanse his mind, confounding his worries in the green and gold beauties of an English midsummer day. Turning into the gates of Rosemont had meant plunging for a brief moment into a dark tunnel of overshading holly trees. But when he emerged once more into the bright air, it seemed as if he must have stumbled upon the very source of all this richness and warmth. The brick of the house, the green of the lawns, the rainbow spectrum of bloom curving around the borders – all seemed part of a single design with the great arch of blue sky in which the sun shimmered like a bonfire reflected in a deep lake."|Deadheads|"Reginald Hill"
