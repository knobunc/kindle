"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"This was one of the newer units, they were told. Dishwasher, washing machine, dryer, microwave, electric oven, all new. Carpeting, new. Septic tank. Roof. Yet the floor of the basement had a crack in the concrete, and some of the grouting between the tiles in the bathroom was turning dark with mold. Signs of decay, like in an old mouth with gleaming caps glued over the stumps, Pippa thought. She wondered how many people had died in this house. Marigold Village, retirement community: a prelude to heaven. This place had everything: swimming pool, restaurants, mini-mall, gas station, health food store, yoga classes, tennis courts, nursing staff. There was an on-call grief counselor, two marriage counselors, a sex therapist, and an herbalist. Book club, camera club, garden club, model boatbuilding club. You never had to leave. Pippa and Herb had first encountered Marigold Village when returning to their Long Island beach house from a lunch party in Connecticut twenty years earlier, when Pippa was just past thirty, Herb sixty. Herb had taken a wrong turn, and they found themselves on a narrow, winding road lined with clusters of dun-colored, single-story houses. It was five o’clock in April; the late afternoon light cast a golden filter over the perfectly maintained lawns. The houses looked identical; a hive of numbered mailboxes stood at the end of each shared driveway. Some of the numbers were in the thousands. Herb had been confident that a couple of left turns and a right would put them back on the main road, but every turn he made seemed to suck them deeper into the development."|"The Private Lives of Pippa Lee"|"Rebecca Miller"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"The table had been set chaotically, plates scattered at random, as if tossed by a furious domestic. Some of them had chocolate cake on them. Others were bare. Pippa noticed something the color of peanut butter spread on one of the slices of chocolate cake. She sniffed it cautiously. It was peanut butter. Yet she distinctly remembered sponging down the table the night before. The place had been immaculate. A chill went up her spine, and she swiveled around, imagining a malevolent pair of psychotic eyes staring at her from the living room – some escaped lunatic, brandishing a dirty cake knife. Seeing no one, she went to the kitchen door, tried it. Locked. She walked around the house, checked every door, every window. All locked. No one had come in. It must have been Herb. But they had gone to bed together at eleven. Herb had fallen asleep first. She tried to imagine him getting up to let people in, after midnight, for chocolate cake and peanut butter. It was out of the question. Then how had the cake gotten there? She cleared the table, scraped plates into the garbage, and stacked them in the dishwasher. Made coffee."|"The Private Lives of Pippa Lee"|"Rebecca Miller"

"ap > 04:00"|"A little after four o’clock"|"A little after four o’clock, Pippa meandered over to Dot’s house carrying a bottle of wine she had been keeping in reserve and wondering if she could possibly be pregnant in spite of the vestigial coil still lodged in her uterus like astronaut litter abandoned on the moon. Yet, no, rare as sex with Herb was these days, precautions were still necessary; eggs were meant to be fulminating inside her in this twilight of her fertility. The thought of a new baby now seemed absurd, even suffocating, much as she had loved being pregnant, addicted as she had been to the smell of her babies’ necks, the soft crowns of their heads. That room was shut and locked; she couldn’t pry it open."|"The Private Lives of Pippa Lee"|"Rebecca Miller"
"ap 05:00"|five|"Suky smiled easily, wore her hair in a low beehive, and nearly always kept her eyebrows up in an expression of bemused surprise. In spite of this, I think she was a closet pessimist. I could tell by her driving. As she man euvered our fat-assed station wagon around the narrow country roads, she sat bolt upright, her little hands clamped to the steering wheel, knuckles white. Every time we approached a turn, she whacked the horn, warning the eighteen-wheeler that was surely barreling round the bend, making ready to spin out of control and flatten us. An insomniac, she would stay up deep into the night, baking cookies, paying bills, or just pottering around. I remember waking from a bad dream in the middle of the night. The house was dead quiet. Knowing she’d be up, I walked downstairs and found her trimming the dead leaves off the plants in her pajamas. She was happy to see me. She made cocoa; we snuggled up to each other and watched TV till five, when we both passed out on the sofa, her arms around me, my head on her breast."|"The Private Lives of Pippa Lee"|"Rebecca Miller"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"Suky slept there often. She’d say she was up so late, there was no point going to bed. We’d come down and find her huddled under the blanket she kept for watching TV. I would shake her awake, and she’d shuffle into the kitchen, drink a glass of orange juice, look at the clock. At seven on the dot, she’d take her medication – she was always muttering about her thyroid being off-kilter. By the time my dad came downstairs, she was dressed and cheerful, masterfully fixing everyone’s breakfast, packing lunches, organizing book bags. She cooked nourishing meals but rarely sat with us at the table for long, preferring to stand by the stove spooning rice pudding from a china cup into her endlessly chattering mouth."|"The Private Lives of Pippa Lee"|"Rebecca Miller"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"I was always a housewife when I played, a little mother pushing my toy vacuum cleaner, a fussily dressed baby doll on my hip, or primly taking messages on a pink pretend phone for my husband, a tall, shadowy being I called Joey. Sex with Joey was a swift, choreographed movement. I would lie down, flap my legs open and closed, and stand up again, returning to my chores. I think I got the idea that you lie down from my friend Amy, who was, at nine, already a bit of an aficionado."|"The Private Lives of Pippa Lee"|"Rebecca Miller"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"As I have mentioned, I was a sexual creature pretty much from the get-go. At eleven, I found a way to achieve orgasms while doing the breaststroke, which subsequently led me to join the swim team of my junior high school and accounted for my iron thighs. In my early teens, though virginal in the extreme – I had never even kissed a boy – I developed a peculiar fantasy in which I met a faceless, unimpeachable gentleman whose pristine heart was overwhelmed with forbidden love for me. The boys in my school held no interest for me. They were all dying for it. I needed to find someone who absolutely didn’t want to be seduced. But I’m getting ahead of myself. At the moment, I’m thirteen, Grandma Sally has thrombosis, and Suky is going to Delaware."|"The Private Lives of Pippa Lee"|"Rebecca Miller"
"ap 09:30"|9:30|"I woke up at 9:30 the next morning. The house was silent. I came down to find Des, sitting in front of a cup of tea and the paper. He smiled at me kindly. I basked in his focused gaze."|"The Private Lives of Pippa Lee"|"Rebecca Miller"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"Horrified at this bully I was becoming, I went to church every Sunday at nine o’clock and prayed to be a better person.

Please, Jesus, come into my heart and change me I  am begging you I am begging you to make me good, please."|"The Private Lives of Pippa Lee"|"Rebecca Miller"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"I got an after-school job at the Oakley Academy, working in the kitchen, just so I could be close to him. Every day at four o’clock, I would walk across the green to the enormous, steamy Oakley kitchen, reluctantly tuck my copper locks into the requisite paper bonnet, and start peeling carrots and potatoes, dicing celery, getting everything ready for the evening meal. Then it was showtime; I would serve the kids their grub. At first I was frustrated; all the contact I had with my beloved was saying hello as I spooned mashed potato and meat loaf onto his plate. But I shot him glances as I worked. He ate with his wife every night. Their conversations seemed strained yet civil. He always pulled her chair out for her. He talked more than she did; mostly she nodded, unsmiling, staring into her plate. Directly after she had finished her meal, she stood up, murmured a goodbye, and walked out. Mr Brown would then get himself a cup of coffee and circulate around the dining hall, chatting with the boys. He seemed to relax when his wife was out of the room. He loosened his tie and sat at the edges of the refectory tables, joking with the students. He was reassuring with one, ruffled another’s hair, spoke with stiff severity to another. I managed to catch his eye once or twice, but after several weeks I couldn’t take it anymore. I had to speak to him."|"The Private Lives of Pippa Lee"|"Rebecca Miller"
06:00|"six in the morning"|"Kat and Trish slept under a shiny maroon bedspread. Over their bed hung a large painting of a naked woman with huge eyes and very long eyelashes. She looked both cute and lewd. Life with Trish and Kat was quiet at first. Kat’s room, where I was staying, wasn’t a bedroom; it was an office with a couch in it. The desk was cluttered with papers and an electric typewriter. Though she worked as a secretary in a wholesale textile business in Chelsea, Kat was writing a novel. At six in the morning, she would glide in with a mug of tea that smelled of warm mud and start typing. I then dragged the comforter to the couch in the living room and tried to sleep until Trish stomped into the kitchen around seven. She worked in a warehouse in the meatpacking district, carried a clipboard."|"The Private Lives of Pippa Lee"|"Rebecca Miller"
"ap 02:00"|two|"Getting naked was the easy part. It was the outfits I balked at. Kat had been hoarding them in the closet of her office in a big, cardboard box marked ‘Kitchen Supplies.’ There were riding breeches with the crotch cut out, a stewardess dress with snap-on boob covers, a rubber cat suit. It was absurd. I couldn’t stop laughing. Especially since Suky had basically been doing this to me since infancy: I was dressed up as Mae West at three, Jayne Mansfield at seven. Suky kept all my dress-up duds in a wooden box we called the ‘fun box.’ Even now that Suky has left me – having politely, obligingly, and without fuss stopped breathing one foggy evening – even now I believe those bizarre and slightly creepy albums are stored somewhere in Chester’s basement. The pages may be disintegrating, eaten out by the acid in the cheap paper, but if you were to open one of those leatherette volumes, you would be surprised to find not pictures of four boys and a girl, a healthy, happy family of the local pastor, but the likeness of only one child, a blonde, sloe-eyed girl in a skimpy dress and feather boa, staring the camera down. Pippa at one, at two, at three and five, at seven to fourteen, her expressions moving, as the years went by, from innocent cheer to a knowing, sullen stare, and finally to full-fledged hatred. So, I was a natural. Kat couldn’t believe it. I had no shyness at all in front of the camera. I looked at it as if it were a person I knew and didn’t like. That’s what she said, anyway. She said it was ‘pure Kitty.’ Kitty, she explained, was every woman’s wild side. She was fearless."|"The Private Lives of Pippa Lee"|"Rebecca Miller"
15:00|"three in the afternoon"|"At three in the afternoon, I went to work. I had found another restaurant, down the street, to hone my serving skills in. When I got off, at nine, Jim was just hitting his stride. I marveled at his ability to work all day, stop to make some inventive pasta dish for the two of us, then go back to his labors for another six or seven hours, finally smoking a joint and hitting the sack at dawn. He would do this for days at a time, then take a few days off and sleep. He was surprised the first night I came home from work bone tired, stood by him as he fitted a torn corner of salmon pink tissue paper onto the rectangle of board on the table, and said, ‘Can I have some?’"|"The Private Lives of Pippa Lee"|"Rebecca Miller"

You said your father is a minister?’ I nodded. ‘Yup. This takes the fuckin’ cake.’ He made ready to get out. ‘Oh,’ I said. ‘Do you mind waiting for a little, um, and then I’ll … come get you … if …’ He turned up the radio and sank down in the seat, nodding with a louche expression. Wondering what I had promised him, I walked to the side door of the house. The first birds were singing. The air smelled sweet and clean. I picked up the hollow plastic rock beside the welcome mat, ripped the silver key off its Velcro square, turned it in the lock."|"The Private Lives of Pippa Lee"|"Rebecca Miller"
"ap 07:00"|"Seven o’clock"|"We embraced for a long time. Then I made her put her feet on my feet. She was sort of giggling, embarrassed, but I insisted she do it, just the way I had put my feet over hers when I was little. And we danced. Her face was so close to mine. I could see the new wrinkles around her eyes. The flesh over her eye sockets was sinking. Her breath was minty. She was looking up at me with deep affection – our old intimacy, as if we were the only two people in the world, as if we were newlyweds. I glanced at the clock. A few seconds to seven. Almost time for her first dose. She never missed it. The minute hand thumped into place beneath the twelve. Seven o’clock. She gently began to release her hold on me. A spike of anger went through me then. I held my arms rigid. She put her hand on my forearm, pushing me away a little. ‘Okay, honey,’ she said."|"The Private Lives of Pippa Lee"|"Rebecca Miller"

Finally I staggered out of my room and dropped to the floor as I answered, leaning against the wall, whispering ‘Hulluh’ and struggling to light a cigarette I’d found in a crushed pack under the table. My neck was clammy, eyes unfocused. I was almost incoherent with sleep. He asked me out for breakfast. Even half-conscious, I knew that I shouldn’t go out with him, so very married as he was, but I hadn’t been able to get him out of my mind ever since he’d told me I was sweet.

"ap 02:00"|two|"I remember one winter, at the country house of friends with young children, everyone went tobogganing but the twins and me. I had stayed inside with them all morning, thinking they were too young, at two, to be on anything moving so fast. Herb came in, though, eyes shining, cheeks flushed from the cold, and said that the other kids in the party were having a great time, they were just a little older than ours. Wouldn’t I come out with the twins? Herb rarely went gamboling outside, so I said yes, all right. I armed Ben and Grace against the cold with snowsuits, fat jackets, mittens, hats, and boots, and they waddled out ahead of me. The sky was clear and blue; the snow sparkled. Herb slid onto the back of the toboggan, holding the rope. Then came fearless Grace, snuggling up to her daddy, then me, then Ben, my sweet little Ben. Herb’s long legs were like iron railings along the row of his family, as one of our friends gave us a little push. So fast – I hadn’t known it would be so quick – and the snow! I couldn’t see, there was snow flying into my face, I was blinded, out of control, clutching Ben, Grace against my back – I was terrified, flying through space with Herb bellowing, steering, and Grace screaming with joy, all of us shrieking in the white screen of no picture, till at last we slid onto the frozen lake at the bottom of the hill and slowly came to a stop. We all rolled off the toboggan. Catching my breath, on all fours, I looked up at Herb: his whole face was encrusted with snow, his eyebrows like snowy mountain peaks; the furry trim on the twins’ hoods was white and glistening, their light eyes peeking out of sugary faces. We all looked at one another and laughed, we laughed so hard, turning in toward each other, a circle of people who belonged to one another, and to no one else. That was the moment I felt us become a family, a unit apart from the world. That was when I became Pippa Lee."|"The Private Lives of Pippa Lee"|"Rebecca Miller"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"Finally, at nine o’clock, Herb came out looking sullen. He took a sip of the coffee and made a face. ‘This is piss,’ he said. Wordlessly she got up, took his cup, poured it out, and ground a new batch of beans. He sat there stewing. When she presented the second cup to him, he tasted it and said, ‘Let’s get a new machine.’"|"The Private Lives of Pippa Lee"|"Rebecca Miller"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"‘See you at lunch then.’ She walked out of the house and thought about what she wanted to buy. A beautiful melon, if she could find a ripe one. And prosciutto. She walked out into the driveway and stared at Herb’s car, sitting there by itself. Where was her car? Had it been stolen? Seconds passed before she remembered it was parked outside the convenience store. Probably had the keys in it! She turned to go back into the house but stopped herself. Herb would flip about the car. He was grumpy enough already. How was she going to get to the convenience store? She could walk, but it was so hot – and Herb might pass her on the way to his office. She hurried around the house and looked across the pond. Chris’s yellow truck was parked in the driveway. She wondered when his shift began. It wasn’t even ten o’clock. What would she say to Dot? She started walking down the road to the Nadeau house. If Dot was there, she would pretend she was just stopping by, out on a walk. If she wasn’t …"|"The Private Lives of Pippa Lee"|"Rebecca Miller"

He started getting into bar brawls with hypocrites; he even got himself arrested once, for screaming ‘Please stop lying to each  other!’ up and down their quiet suburban street at two o’clock in the morning. He went straight from jail to a tattoo parlor and had the Lord bored into his skin for good. The boy was driving his mother crazy. His father felt completely impotent in the face of his son’s problem. ‘If it was drugs,’ Johnny said, ‘at least we could send him to rehab. But this …’ He flapped his arms and let them slap his sides uselessly."|"The Private Lives of Pippa Lee"|"Rebecca Miller"
"ap > 01:00"|"past one"|"When she got home, she made spanakopita for Herb, folding neat packets of filo dough around a mixture of feta cheese and spinach. Then she settled into a reclining lawn chair on the patio, sipping a large glass of pomegranate juice. Herb was in his office. It was past one, he should be home soon. Pippa looked across the pond at Dot’s house. The yellow truck was there. Then she saw the front door open. Chris walked out and got into his truck. He was the strangest person she had ever met. So unpleasant, yet so touching. The yellow truck pulled away just as Herb laid his hand on her shoulder. She turned, startled. ‘Did you think I was a geriatric marauder?’ he asked."|"The Private Lives of Pippa Lee"|"Rebecca Miller"
11:00|"eleven in the morning"|"Once in the parking lot, she couldn’t face getting into her car. She didn’t want to go home. She didn’t know what to do with herself. It was eleven in the morning. Chris was asleep. Herb was in his office. She could go and see him. It was strange, Pippa felt, that she hadn’t thought of Herb first. That was wrong. She must pay more attention to Herb. She walked over to the building where his office was, pushed open the door, ran up the flight of stairs to his door, knocked. She already had her first sentence formed: ‘I got kicked out of pottery class.’ There was a little laugh in it, the way she was saying it in her head; already she was making fun of Mrs Mankevitz, her gypsy jewelry, the way the whole class had stared at her as though she had just admitted to a sex crime. Herb would crack up about it. She could hear shuffling inside his office. She knocked again."|"The Private Lives of Pippa Lee"|"Rebecca Miller"
08:00|"eight that morning"|"He tried to help her with her bag, but she ignored him, rushed it to her car. Once she got into the driver’s seat, she realized she had forgotten her car keys. She smacked the steering wheel with a curse, then ran back into the house. The kitchen was empty now. She searched the room wildly for her keys. She had to get out before Herb walked back in. At last she saw them, chucked behind her morning coffee mug. When she drank that coffee, at eight that morning, she’d thought she was a happily married woman. As she snatched the keys off the kitchen counter, she glimpsed Herb’s shoe on the linoleum. His foot was in it. She walked around the island of white Formica and saw him lying unconscious on the ground, a dark stain on his trousers where he had wet himself."|"The Private Lives of Pippa Lee"|"Rebecca Miller"
"ap 05:00"|five|"‘Don’t you have to work?’
‘I’m off till five.’
‘Maybe just for half an hour.’ She went into the house, tiptoed down the hall, and peeked into her bedroom. Grace was asleep, huddled under the duvet. Pippa wrote a note, propped it up on the bedside table beside Grace, took her cell phone out of her handbag, drew her sweatshirt off the back of a kitchen chair, and walked outside. Chris was already in the driver’s seat."|"The Private Lives of Pippa Lee"|"Rebecca Miller"
