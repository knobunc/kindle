03:00|"three a.m."|"President Ryan was running on fumes at five in the afternoon, after having been up and hard at work since three a.m. The day had been full of diplomatic and military crises; often success in one arena was offset by setbacks in another."|"Threat Vector"|"Tom Clancy"
17:05|"five minutes after five in the afternoon"|"The unwelcome response came at five minutes after five in the afternoon, when the NIPRINET, the Department of Defense’s unsecure network, went down under the weight of a massive denial-of-service attack. The entire U.S. military global supply chain—and a vast amount of its ability to communicate between bases, departments, forces, and systems— simply ceased to function."|"Threat Vector"|"Tom Clancy"
"ap 05:25"|"five twenty-five"|"At five twenty-five, the secure DoD network began having drop-offs in bandwidth and problems with communications. Public military and U.S. government websites went down completely or were replaced with pictures and videos of American forces being killed in Afghanistan and Iraq, a sick and violent loop of images of exploding Humvees, sniper victims, and Jihadi propaganda."|"Threat Vector"|"Tom Clancy"
"ap 05:58"|"five fifty-eight"|"At five fifty-eight, a series of cyberkinetic attacks on critical infrastructure in the United States began. The FAA’s network went down, as did the Metro systems in most major cities along the eastern seaboard. Mobile phone service in California and Seattle became spotty or nonexistent."|"Threat Vector"|"Tom Clancy"
"> 23:00"|"just after eleven o’clock in the evening"|"Gerry Hendley, Sam Granger, and Rick Bell sat in Gerry’s office on the ninth floor of Hendley Associates just after eleven o’clock in the evening. The three men had been here all evening, waiting for updates from Ding Chavez and the others in Beijing. Ding had checked in just a few minutes earlier to say his first impression of the rebels was that they were not ready for prime time, but he would reserve judgment for a couple of days while he, Dom, and Sam evaluated their capabilities."|"Threat Vector"|"Tom Clancy"
01:00|"one in the morning"|"Gavin sat in his office at one in the morning. On his desk in front of him was a technical manual from Microsoft that he’d been reading on and off for the entire day. It was not uncommon for him to work this late, and he imagined he’d be pulling a long string of all-nighters over the next few days while he rebuilt his system. He’d sent most of his staff home, but a couple of programmers were still somewhere on the floor; he’d heard them talking a few minutes earlier."|"Threat Vector"|"Tom Clancy"
"< 04:00"|"almost four a.m."|"An hour later, Clark, Biery, Kraft, and Kovalenko arrived at the Russian spy’s Dupont Circle apartment. It was almost four a.m., nearly an hour after Kovalenko had been ordered to report in by Center. Kovalenko was nervous about the exchange to come, but more than that, he was nervous about what would happen to him afterward, at the hands of John Clark."|"Threat Vector"|"Tom Clancy"
04:00|"four in the morning"|"“How do you know?”
“I am a professional. Who can follow me at four in the morning?”
There was a long pause. Finally the man said, “Send upload.” And he hung up."|"Threat Vector"|"Tom Clancy"
17:00|"five p.m."|"Adam went first, driving through the crossing at Lok Ma Chau at five p.m. local time. He wanted to be in place on the other side for when Ryan made it over so Jack wasn’t wandering mainland China as a gweilo with no papers, a scenario that would not have ended well for the son of the president."|"Threat Vector"|"Tom Clancy"
20:00|"eight p.m."|"They sloshed through the rice paddies as the sun set and the moon rose. Jack lost his shoes almost immediately. There was a little conversation at first, but as they neared the water all the talking stopped. At eight p.m. they arrived on the levee, and one of the men pulled a raft made of milk cartons and particle board out of tall grasses. Ryan and the smuggler climbed aboard, and the other two pushed them off."|"Threat Vector"|"Tom Clancy"
"< 22:00"|"nearly ten p.m."|"On Wednesday evening the three Americans, Yin Yin, and two young Chinese men went to both locations in a small van with tinted windows. They would have loved to have been able to see the lay of the land in the daylight, but they didn’t find a suitable location on the G-4 until nearly ten p.m., and it was after midnight when they came across a fair ambush point on the Jingzhou Road."|"Threat Vector"|"Tom Clancy"

00:00|midnight|"Fourteen Marine F/A-18C pilots took to the skies over Taiwan at midnight. They climbed into heavy cloud cover over the island and adopted flight paths to appear on PLA radars as if they were heading for regular CAP stations in the strait, just as they had done dozens of times before."|"Threat Vector"|"Tom Clancy"
01:30|"one-thirty a.m."|"At one-thirty a.m. the Hornets flew fast and low, screaming over the waves as they headed southwest. By now they all knew the Chinese had scrambled fighters and alerted their coastal defenses, but for a few moments more, at least, the PLA had no idea what the group of planes’ intentions were."|"Threat Vector"|"Tom Clancy"
02:04|"2:04 a.m."|"At 2:04 a.m. there were ten strike aircraft still together in a tight trail formation as they shot through Victoria Harbour in the center of Hong Kong. At an altitude of only three hundred twenty feet they passed the Peninsula hotel at five hundred miles an hour, and the roar of their twenty jet engines broke windows and woke virtually everyone asleep within a mile of the channel."|"Threat Vector"|"Tom Clancy"
"> 03:00"|"just after three in the morning"|"Adam turned at the river, passed row after row of storage sheds where the locals kept grains and fertilizer and other equipment for the nearby rice fields, and then they drove onto a narrow dirt road. Yao looked at his watch, saw it was just after three in the morning, and he knew it would be a miracle if they saw anyone or anything down here at all."|"Threat Vector"|"Tom Clancy"
"ap 08:00"|"Eight o’clock"|"Eight o’clock came and went, and then eight-thirty. The rain had picked up under dark gray clouds, and occasional lightning flashes to the north of the city preceded claps of thunder."|"Threat Vector"|"Tom Clancy"

"ap 08:45"|"eight forty-five"|"At eight forty-five Caruso stood by the rebel translator on the sidewalk next to the van. He said, “Yin Yin. We really need to hear from your motorcycle cop friend.”"|"Threat Vector"|"Tom Clancy"
05:00|"five o’clock this morning"|"Tong was dead. That was not in the papers; Su had learned this at five o’clock this morning when his body was identified, pulled from the rubble in two large pieces. Ninety-two Ghost Ship hackers, managers, and engineers died as well, and dozens more were injured. The servers were blown to bits, and with that Su had learned almost immediately that America’s secure Department of Defense network bandwidth increased, satellite communications came back online, and several of Center’s initiatives in the United States, corruption of banking and telecom and critical infrastructure, had simply ceased or at least lost much of their designed impact."|"Threat Vector"|"Tom Clancy"
"ap 06:00"|"six-o’clock"|"Quickly Sam checked his six-o’clock position. With the heavy rain, many motorists on the street could not see the melee until they were just a few hundred yards from Driscoll, which meant now a massive sliding car wreck was starting behind him. He put the slight danger of getting run over during this operation out of his mind, reloaded the launcher, and fired another grenade. This explosive shot right by the open driver’s-side door of the rolling work truck and struck the second troop transport, which had just slammed its rear into the center dividing wall between the northbound and southbound lanes while trying to back up to reverse direction. The broadside hit of this grenade meant fewer soldiers were killed outright, but the truck was ablaze and blocking the road so the surviving vehicles in the motorcade now had no way to escape."|"Threat Vector"|"Tom Clancy"
"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"The Americans and the ten surviving Chinese were back in the barn before noon. There were some wounds—Sam had a broken hand that he had not even felt when he was hit. Caruso had taken a ricochet off a rock that grazed his hip and bled heavily but wasn’t serious, and one of the surviving Chinese had been shot in the forearm."|"Threat Vector"|"Tom Clancy"
"> 16:00"|"just after four in the afternoon"|"Mary Pat Foley’s black Suburban pulled up in front of Melanie Kraft’s Alexandria carriage-house apartment just after four in the afternoon. The temperature had dropped below freezing, and the low gray skies spit a light mix of snow and freezing rain."|"Threat Vector"|"Tom Clancy"
