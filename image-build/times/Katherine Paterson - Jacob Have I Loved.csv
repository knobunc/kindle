02:00|"2:00 A.M."|"The next winter we both had whooping cough. My mother thinks that I was sick enough to have a croup tent set up. But everyone remembers that Captain Billy got the ferry out at 2:00 A.M. to rush Caroline and my mother to the hospital."|"Jacob Have I Loved"|"Katherine Paterson"
"ap ~ 04:00"|"about four"|"Although our house was one of the smaller of the forty or so houses on the island, for several years we owned the only piano. It came to us on the ferry after my mainland grandfather died. I think Caroline and I were about four when it arrived. She says she remembers meeting it at the dock and following while six men helped my father roll it on a dolly to our house, for there were no trucks or cars on the island."|"Jacob Have I Loved"|"Katherine Paterson"
"~ 18:00"|"night prayer"|"It was not a phrase my mother often used, but it was a true island expression. Rass had lived in the fear and mercy of the Lord since the early nineteenth century, when Joshua Thomas, “The Parson of the Islands,” won every man, woman, and child of us to Methodism. Old Joshua’s stamp remained upon us—Sunday school and Sunday service morning and evening, and on Wednesday night prayer meeting where the more fervent would stand to witness to the Lord’s mercies of the preceding week and all the sick and straying would be held up in prayer before the Throne of Grace."|"Jacob Have I Loved"|"Katherine Paterson"
"ap 06:00"|six|"At six, Grandma woke, hungry and petulant. No one had given any thought to food. How could one think of supper when the world had just gone up in flames? Finally, my mother went to the kitchen and made plates of cold meat and leftover potato salad, which she brought to the three of us hunched about the set. She even brought coffee for us all. Grandma insisted on being served properly at the table. Caroline and I had never drunk coffee in our lives, and the fact that our mother served us coffee that night made us both realize that our secure, ordinary world was forever in the past."|"Jacob Have I Loved"|"Katherine Paterson"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"She humphed and hemmed and slurped her coffee without answering, but as soon as I’d gotten my book again and was settled down on the couch and reading, she said, “It’s onto four o’clock.”"|"Jacob Have I Loved"|"Katherine Paterson"
12:00|noon|"“We’ll be here by noon,” he told the Captain cheerily. I could have choked him. That meant at least four and a half hours of gut-ripping work in the heat for nothing. Nothing."|"Jacob Have I Loved"|"Katherine Paterson"
"ap 04:15"|four-fifteen|"The Captain, of course, was delighted. His one concession to the temperature was that we work indoors and not on the dock in the sun. He began planning out loud all the projects the three of us could complete by the time school opened. I managed, with a lie about my mother needing me, to get away by four-fifteen. I wanted to get to the post office before supper. It would have been better perhaps if I had not, for there it was, my letter from Lyrics Unlimited. I ran with it to the tip of the island, to my driftwood stump, and sat down to open it, my hands shaking so they made a poor job of it."|"Jacob Have I Loved"|"Katherine Paterson"
"< 12:00"|"Just before noon"|"Just before noon Call came by and asked if Caroline or I was going down to the Captain’s."|"Jacob Have I Loved"|"Katherine Paterson"
15:30|"half-past three in the afternoon"|"I closed the door behind me. Then, without thinking, I took off my dress and hung it up and put on my nightgown. I crawled under the covers and closed my eyes. It was half-past three in the afternoon."|"Jacob Have I Loved"|"Katherine Paterson"
"~ 18:00"|"night prayer"|"If I was being prayed for mightily at Wednesday night prayer meetings, I was not told of it. I suppose people were a little afraid of me. I must have been a strange sight, always dressed in men’s work clothes, my hands as rough and weathered as the sides of the crab house where I worked."|"Jacob Have I Loved"|"Katherine Paterson"
"ap 02:00"|two|"It was the last week in November when the first northwest blow of winter sent the egg-laden sooks rushing toward Virginia and the Jimmies deep under the Chesapeake mud. My father took a few days off to shoot duck, and then put the culling board back on the Portia Sue and headed out for oysters. One week in school that fall had been enough for me and one week alone on the oyster beds was enough for him. We hardly discussed it. I just got up at two Monday morning, dressed as warmly as I could with a change of clothes in a gunny-sack. We ate breakfast together, my mother serving us. No one said anything about my not being a man—maybe they’d forgotten."|"Jacob Have I Loved"|"Katherine Paterson"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"There followed two weeks of impossible weather. My father made no attempt to take the Portia Sue out. The first day or so I was content simply to sleep away some of the accumulated exhaustion of the winter. But the day soon came when my mother, handing me a ten o’clock cup of coffee, was suggesting mildly that I might want to take in a few days of school since the bad weather was likely to hold out for some time."|"Jacob Have I Loved"|"Katherine Paterson"
