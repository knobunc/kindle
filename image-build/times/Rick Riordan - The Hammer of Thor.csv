Time stamp 7:03 that morning: we were treated to a view of her grandparents’ living room—a small but tidy space with a low coffee table and two suede sofas.

Sam leaped through next, followed by Alex. Blitz was struggling with his shorter stride, so I grabbed him and jumped. Just as the giant’s boot came down, the world was snuffed out in absolute, silent darkness."|"The Hammer of Thor"|"Rick Riordan"
