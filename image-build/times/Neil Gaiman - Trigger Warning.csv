01:00|"one in the shower this morning"|"“So what do these Click-Clacks look like?” Even as I asked him, I wished I could take the question back, and leave it unasked. I thought: Huge spidery creatures. Like the one in the shower this morning. I’m afraid of spiders."|"Trigger Warning"|"Neil Gaiman"
"> 12:00"|"a little after midday"|"THE SUN BEGAN TO go out a little after midday. A flicker, first, and then a rapid darkening that began on one side of the sun and then crept across its crimson face until the sun went black, like a coal knocked from a fire, and night returned to the world."|"Trigger Warning"|"Neil Gaiman"
10:00|"ten this morning"|"The little girl—Polly—looked at her wristwatch. “That’s weird. It says I’ve only been here for five minutes. I got here at ten this morning.”"|"Trigger Warning"|"Neil Gaiman"
"ap ~ 08:30"|"gone eight thirty"|"WE WERE WALKING UP a gentle hill on a summer’s evening. It was gone eight thirty, but it still felt like midafternoon. The sky was blue. The sun was low on the horizon, and it splashed the clouds with gold and salmon and purple-gray."|"Trigger Warning"|"Neil Gaiman"
05:00|"five o’clock in the morning"|"SO THERE’S SCALLIE AND me wearing Starsky-and-Hutch wigs, complete with sideburns, at five o’clock in the morning by the side of a canal in Amsterdam. There had been ten of us that night, including Rob, the groom, last seen handcuffed to a bed in the red-light district with shaving foam covering his nether regions and his future brother-in-law giggling and patting the hooker holding the straight razor on the arse, which was the point I looked at Scallie and he looked at me, and he said, “Maximum deniability?” and I nodded, because there are some questions you don’t want to be able to answer when a bride starts asking pointed questions about the stag weekend, so we slipped off for a drink, leaving eight men in Starsky-and-Hutch wigs (one of whom was mostly naked, attached to a bed by fluffy pink handcuffs, and seemed to be starting to think that this adventure wasn’t such a good idea after all) behind us, in a room that smelled of disinfectant and cheap incense, and we went and sat by a canal and drank cans of Danish lager and talked about the old days."|"Trigger Warning"|"Neil Gaiman"
18:30|"six thirty P.M."|"The preview always begins at six thirty P.M. I had spent the afternoon hanging paintings, making sure everything looked as good as it could, as I have done every other year. The only thing that was different about the day of this particular event was how excited Paul looked, like a small boy struggling with the urge to tell you what he had bought you for a birthday present. That, and Barry, who said, while we were hanging, “I think tonight’s show will put you on the map.”"|"Trigger Warning"|"Neil Gaiman"
00:00|midnight|"It was dark when Calum loped into the shelter and looked at me as if he had not expected to see me that side of midnight. I said, “What took you so long, Calum MacInnes?”"|"Trigger Warning"|"Neil Gaiman"
12:00|noon|"The clouds came down at noon and the world was blanketed by a mist that was worse than rain: droplets of water hung in the air, soaked our clothes and our skin; the rocks we walked upon became treacherous and Calum and I slowed in our ascent, stepped carefully. We were walking up the mountain, not climbing, up goat paths and craggy sharp ways. The rocks were black and slippery: we walked, and climbed and clambered and clung, we slipped and slid and stumbled and staggered, yet even in the mist, Calum knew where he was going, and I followed him."|"Trigger Warning"|"Neil Gaiman"
12:00|noonday|"When I reached the ledge the cave entrance seemed like a darker shadow in the noonday sun. I turned from it, turned my back on the mountain, and from the shadows that were already gathering in the cracks and the crevices and deep inside my skull, and I began my slow journey away from the Misty Isle. There were a hundred roads and a thousand paths that would take me back to my home in the lowlands, where my wife would be waiting."|"Trigger Warning"|"Neil Gaiman"
12:00|midday|"it was none of my beeswax, and to be sure to be out
of the house between midday and four, as the char was coming,
and I would be underfoot and in the way."|"Trigger Warning"|"Neil Gaiman"
"ap 04:00"|four|"it was none of my beeswax, and to be sure to be out
of the house between midday and four, as the char was coming,
and I would be underfoot and in the way."|"Trigger Warning"|"Neil Gaiman"
"ap 00:00"|Twelve|"They were outside, in a forest, somewhere very cold indeed.
“DOWN!” called Twelve.
The sharp thing went over their heads and crashed into a tree behind them."|"Trigger Warning"|"Neil Gaiman"
00:00|Midnight|"He was tumbling through the air as the final grain fell and Midnight took him."|"Trigger Warning"|"Neil Gaiman"
19:14|"Nineteen Fourteen"|"“How’d it go?” asked Nineteen Fourteen. She wore a floor-length white skirt and long, white gloves."|"Trigger Warning"|"Neil Gaiman"
20:12|"Twenty Twelve"|"“They’re getting more dangerous every year,” said Twenty Twelve. “The seconds, and the things behind them. But I like the new kid. I think he’s going to do fine.”"|"Trigger Warning"|"Neil Gaiman"
21:00|"nine at night"|"It was nine at night and Donna was walking. She kept to well-lit areas, and she wasn’t ashamed to ask for money. Not anymore. People could always say no, and mostly they did."|"Trigger Warning"|"Neil Gaiman"
