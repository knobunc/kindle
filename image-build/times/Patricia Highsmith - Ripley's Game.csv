The opinion of a German specialist might be a good thing. Two years ago Jonathan had consulted a specialist in London. His report had been the same as the French, which had satisfied Jonathan that the diagnoses were true. Mightn’t the Germans be a little more thorough or up to date? Suppose he accepted Wister’s offer of a round trip? (Jonathan was copying an address on to a postcard.) But then he’d be beholden to Wister. Jonathan realized he was toying with the idea of killing someone for Wister – not for Wister, but for the money. A Mafia member. They were all criminals themselves, weren’t they? Of course, Jonathan reminded himself, he could always pay Wister back, if he accepted his round-trip fare. The point was, Jonathan couldn’t pull the money out of the bank funds just now, there wasn’t enough. If he really wanted to make sure of his condition, Germany (or Switzerland for that matter) could tell him. They still had the best doctors in the world, hadn’t they? Jonathan was now putting the card of the paper supplier of Melun beside his telephone to remind him to ring tomorrow, because the paper place wasn’t open today either. And who knew, mightn’t Stephen Wister’s proposal be feasible? For an instant, Jonathan saw himself blown to bits by the crossfire of German police officers: they’d caught him just after he fired on the Italian. But even if he were dead, Simone and Georges would get the forty thousand quid. Jonathan came back to reality. He wasn’t going to kill anybody, no. But Hamburg, going to Hamburg seemed a lark, a break, even if he learned some awful news there. He’d learn facts, anyway. And if Wister paid now, Jonathan could pay him back in a matter of three months, if he scrimped, didn’t buy any clothes, not even a beer in a café. Jonathan rather dreaded telling Simone, though she’d agree, of course, since it had to do with seeing another doctor, presumably an excellent doctor.
