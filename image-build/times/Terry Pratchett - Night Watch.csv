"ap 10:00"|ten|"“Here, sir,” said Carrot, handing it over smoothly. “We are due at the Palace at ten, sir. Watch Committee. But I’m sure they’ll understand,” he added, seeing Vimes’s face. “I’ll go and clean out Stronginthearm’s locker, sir, and I expect the lads’ll have a whip-round for flowers and everything…”"|"Night Watch"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 10:30"|"half past ten"|"Vimes reached a door and darted inside. New Hall was student accommodation, but it was still only half past ten, so most of them would be in bed. A few faces looked around doors and Vimes trotted along the corridor and reached the stairwell at the far end. That took him—walking now, and rather less sure of his future—to the top floor. Let’s see, he’d been here before…yes, there was a door ajar, and a glimpse of mops and buckets suggested that this was a janitor’s closet."|"Night Watch"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"“I’ll report for duty at three o’clock tomo—this afternoon, sir,” he said. “Thank you, sir.”"|"Night Watch"|"Terry Pratchett"
10:00|"ten o’clock in the morning"|"At ten o’clock in the morning Vimes found a cold cup of tea by his bed, and a pile of clothes and armor on the floor outside the door. He drank the tea while he inspected the pile."|"Night Watch"|"Terry Pratchett"
"~ 12:00"|"around midday"|"The Treacle Mine Road Night Watch House was generally deserted around midday, but Vimes knew that Snouty, at least, would be there. He was a Persistent Floater, just like Nobby and Colon and Carrot and, when you got down to it, Vimes as well. Being on duty was their default state of being. They hung around the Watch House even when off duty, because that’s where their lives took place. Being a copper wasn’t something you left hanging by the door when you went home."|"Night Watch"|"Terry Pratchett"
"~ 13:00"|"around one in the afternoon"|"He got up around one in the afternoon. Lawn was closeted in his surgery, doing something that involved some serious whimpering on the part of something else. Vimes knocked on the door."|"Night Watch"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 09:00"|"9 o’clock"|"He unfolded it. In smudged pencil, but still readable, it read: Morphic Street, 9 o’clock tonight. Password: swordfish."|"Night Watch"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 09:00"|"Nine o’clock"|"“What time’s curfew?” Vimes whispered.
“Nine o’clock, Sarge.”
“Must be nearly that now,” said Vimes."|"Night Watch"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap ~ 08:45"|"just gone a quarter to nine"|"“Must be nearly that now,” said Vimes.
“No, it’s only just gone a quarter to nine, Sarge.”
“Well, it’s going to take me a few minutes to get back. I want you to sneak back after me and wait at the corner. When it starts, you come running and banging that bell of yours.”"|"Night Watch"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 09:00"|"Nine o’clock"|"Behind him he heard Lance Constable Vimes advancing at a run, ringing his bell madly, and shouting, “Nine o’clock and all’s not well at all!” And there were other sounds, too, the ones Vimes had been half-listening for, of doors slamming and distant footsteps hurrying away."|"Night Watch"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 03:00"|three|"He heard the distant clocks strike three. Tonight, the streets would explode."|"Night Watch"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"“Well, it’s not four o’clock yet, ma’am, but if you’ll let me know when you want to retire—”"|"Night Watch"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"Bleedwell had worn black. Assassins always did. Black was cool, and, besides, it was the rules. But only in a dark cellar at midnight was black a sensible color. Elsewhere, Vetinari preferred dark green, or shades of dark gray. With the right coloring, and the right stance, you vanished. People’s eyes would help you vanish. They erased you from their vision, they fitted you into the background."|"Night Watch"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap < 10:00"|"almost ten"|"“It’s almost ten,” said the major. “People will be going to bed soon, surely?”"|"Night Watch"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap < 00:58"|"almost two to one"|"Vimes crouched behind the makeshift wall and peered through a crack. They’d snatched a few crossbows from aimless soldiers on the way here, but by the look of it Carcer’s men had at least fifteen between them. And they outnumbered the lilac lads almost two to one."|"Night Watch"|"Terry Pratchett"
