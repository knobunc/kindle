hives were not well situated, according to Chapter One of the manual. But the
choice of location had nothing to do with maximising productivity Charm had
been the deciding factor. Larkwood’s cemetery was situated — literally — in a
grove of aspens. At the eastern corner the trees thickened, rising on a gentle
incline to a clearing. Here, among ferns, nettles and wild flowers, eight hives
had been arranged in a circle. To each of these Anselm had given the name of a
saint. For his own comfort, he’d secured a spot for himself, dumping an old pew
between Thérèse de Lisieux and Augustine of Hippo. Memorising who was where
among the rest had not been an easy task. Anselm only succeeded after
Sylvester, the Gatekeeper, gave him a Christmas present after midnight mass:
oblong labels cut from a worn leather apron. Upon these, in India ink, the old
watchman had inscribed a name in glorious copperplate. Within the hour they’d
baptised the hives."|"A Whispered Name"|"William Brodrick"

horse and rode to Oostbeke, a small village northwest of Poperinghe where his
and several other regiments from the same division had been billeted after
leaving the front line. All the way he brooded upon the words dictated to
Chamberlayne by their CO: ‘Third officer required’. In itself that was a
statement of the obvious, worthy of the sergeant in the military police: a
Field General Court Martial had to comprise at least three officers unless the
convening officer (usually the Brigade commander) dispensed with the obligation
for operational reasons. As Herbert cantered down a lane of puddles between
fields of cabbage or hops draped on wooden scaffolds, he remembered that two
officers had limited sentencing powers … the worst they could dish out was
Field Punishment or Imprisonment. After a mile or so Herbert came upon the rows
of bell tents and wooden huts, smoke smudging the sky above the troop kitchens.
In the distance, near the artillery lines, three observation balloons floated
high like fat maggots feeding on the clouds. It was obvious, really: without a

wind? I’d never seen anything like it in my life. The land high in the sky and

hand on top of the other. ‘Later in the day after we’d taken the Ridge, I

officer didn’t raise his head. Under his breath he just said, ‘Five forty-six
a.m.’ With a turn of the heel he marched away from the splattered chair and the
heap on the wet straw Father Maguire rose at once, looked at the body for a
long moment, and then went after the firing party. Even in this place of utter
abandonment, thought Herbert, awed, the chaplain remains anxious for the
living."|"A Whispered Name"|"William Brodrick"

drew up a chair to the corner of Chamberlayne’s desk and borrowed his ink pen.
Without hesitating he began to endorse the Army Form A3. The anaesthesia
induced through watching a chair among flames was still effective. Herbert
could feel nothing. He wrote a legal-sounding phrase to the effect that the
sentence had been carried out at 5.46 a.m., adding, ‘without a snag’. The
burial party had cursed him quietly as they’d hacked at the thick roots and the
tight soil."|"A Whispered Name"|"William Brodrick"

orders had come through from Division. At midnight on the 19th instant the 8NLI
would join sixty-five thousand men from eighteen brigades for an assault at the
Gheluvelt Plateau. The rehearsals were over: it was time for the show. They’d
be alongside the East Yorkshires, Glanville’s lot — who, incidentally had
caught a sniper’s eye two days back. Stood up after breakfast and got a clip
around the ear. The weather reports had also been leaked to Duggie. Rain was
expected. This was hardly a secret. Clouds had been banking. The 8th was
heading back to the mud and the mist and the screeching iron. The preparations
had ended just when the sky turned black. It would be last August all over
again."|"A Whispered Name"|"William Brodrick"

the woods until the bells rang for Vespers. When the pealing found a regular
strike, singing over the fields, he stepped into the open and approached the

a symbol of lost love."|"A Whispered Name"|"William Brodrick"

Lindsay was known to Les Ramiers and he did run a café in Étaples

Of late he’d always been accompanied by one of his children or grandchildren.
They were a very private family and volunteered nothing of their purpose in
coming, though their routine suggested a ritual of some importance. Each year
they arrived on the evening of 14th September in time for Compline. Mr Lindsay rose
very early — something like five in the morning — and went out somewhere,
regardless of the weather. He was back for Lauds at seven. After lunch the
family left, and Les Ramiers didn’t see them again until Compline a year later.

stared back from that forgotten September and simply waved goodbye. He took the
train to Folkestone, the ferry to Boulogne and a coach to Poperinghe, where a
taciturn monk drove him the remaining twelve kilometres to Les Ramiers. Throughout
the journey Anselm felt a subdued presence at his side: this was the route
Herbert had taken long ago when he’d first left England in a uniform. At the
end of Compline Anselm sang the Salve Regina with his brothers in the nave,
wondering where Herbert had once stood, acutely aware that among the handful of
guests were an old man and a woman. They sat at the very back, close together,
apart from the others, hidden by shadows."|"A Whispered Name"|"William Brodrick"

trees planted not far from the guesthouse. At 5.30 a.m. two dark shapes
appeared on the top step. Both were well wrapped to meet the cold of the
morning. Mist came from their mouths as they whispered to each other.
Arm-in-arm they descended the short stairs, left the enclosure and began
walking along the main road out of the village. After a few minutes Anselm followed
them."|"A Whispered Name"|"William Brodrick"

gathered in the Chapter Room before Compline. A candle burned on a central
stand. Each of the monks drifted to their seat built into the circular wall of
stone. Everyone was present, save Sylvester. After a brief prayer the Prior
gave a summary of all that was known about Joseph Flanagan and his trial. He
then invited Anselm to take the floor. ‘This is the story Herbert never heard
of the man he’d always wanted to meet.’"|"A Whispered Name"|"William Brodrick"

another prayer he drew the meeting to a close and extinguished the candle
between his thumb and a finger. The community processed out of the Chapter
Room, through the dark cloister and into the church for Compline. There,

heart, the Gatekeeper leafed through the pages of his Psalter as if he’d never
seen it before."|"A Whispered Name"|"William Brodrick"

to think of schemes that would lead him to Joseph Flanagan’s family When he
woke for Lauds he was as lost as the night before. Throwing his habit over his
pyjamas, he glanced across his cell and froze. On the ground, inches away from
the narrow gap beneath the door, was a small square of white card. He picked it
up and read the embossed writing several times."|"A Whispered Name"|"William Brodrick"

helpers — a whisperer and nudger — was called Sylvester. He came to help with
the thatching of a barn and never left. He became a novice in 1925, the year of
Herbert’s solemn profession. With tousled blond hair and bright blue eyes, he
was, at twenty-two, a lively presence: a practical joker (using a plumb line as
a trip wire) who was always late for everything. He had to be dragged out of
bed in the morning and hauled away from the table after meals. Despite hours of
instruction he never mastered the sign language — even though it had been
devised to accommodate the slower medieval mind and had worked smoothly for
centuries without need of alteration. He took to whistling, pointing and
winking. During recreation, when the monks talked freely, he occasionally
pressed Herbert for stories of the war."|"A Whispered Name"|"William Brodrick"
