"ap ~ 00:57"|"about three to one"|"I recall one lecture particularly well. It was at the University of Texas, one of the premier physics departments in the United States. The audience included a number of extremely accomplished physicists, including Steven Weinberg, Willy Fischler, Joe Polchinski, Bryce DeWitt, and Claudio Teitelboim, all of whom have made major contributions to the theory of gravity. I was quite interested in their views, so at the end of the lecture, I took a poll of the audience. If my memory serves me right, Fischler, DeWitt, and Teitelboim held the minority view, that information is not lost. Polchinski was convinced by Hawking’s arguments and voted with the majority. Weinberg abstained. The overall vote was about three to one in favor of Hawking, but there was a noticeable reluctance on the part of the audience members to commit themselves."|"The Black Hole War"|"Leonard Susskind"
13:00|"one that unfolded that day"|"By comparison, John Preskill is more reserved, though not at all stuffy. A wiry man with a wry sense of humor, John is about the same age as Joe Polchinski and was at the time a professor at the California Institute of Technology. Cal Tech had been the home of two of the greatest physicists of the century, Murray GellMann and Dick Feynman. John himself was a widely admired physicist with a reputation as an exceedingly straight shooter. Like Sidney Coleman, John was one of those people whose clarity of thought gave him a special moral authority. My conversations with John had always been rewarding. The one that unfolded that day was revelatory. But before I can explain it, I have to tell you a little more about Black Hole Complementarity."|"The Black Hole War"|"Leonard Susskind"
10:00|"10:00 a.m."|"It must have been 10:00 a.m. by the time I left King’s College Chapel and walked out into the sunlit June day. The Darwinian mystery of irrational faith had wormed its way into my brain, but a much more pressing technical problem required an immediate solution: I still had to find the Newton Institute."|"The Black Hole War"|"Leonard Susskind"
00:00|midnight|"The journalists were spellbound—each one studying Stephen’s face for subtle signs as he told of his early life before being diagnosed with Lou Gehrig’s disease. According to his testimony, those early years were dominated by a sense of boredom—the boredom of a young man who seemed to be going nowhere. He was twenty-four years old, an unexceptional graduate student of physics, not making much progress: a bit of a layabout with little ambition. Then came the early stroke of midnight, the terrifying diagnosis, a certain death sentence. We all live under a death sentence, but in Stephen’s case it appeared to be immediate: a year, maybe two, probably not even enough time to finish his Ph.D."|"The Black Hole War"|"Leonard Susskind"
"~ 17:00"|"around 5:00 p.m."|"The seminar ended at around 5:00 p.m., by which time I had had enough of the Newton Institute. I wanted to get out of Cambridge. Anne was visiting with a friend, and she had left me the rental car. Instead of driving back to our apartment, I drove out past the neighboring village, Milton, and stopped in a pub. I am not a drinking man, and drinking alone is definitely not a habit of mine, but in this case I really did want to sit and have a beer by myself. It wasn’t solitude that I wanted; it was just the absence of physicists."|"The Black Hole War"|"Leonard Susskind"
"ap 05:29"|5:29|"Minkowski called the points of space-time events. The common usage of the word event implies not only a time and a place but also something happening there. For example: “An event of momentous importance took place at 5:29:45 a.m., July 16, 1945, at Trinity, New Mexico, when the first atomic weapon was tested.” Minkowski intended a little less by his use of the word event. He meant only a specified time and place, regardless of whether anything actually happened there. What he really meant was a place and time where an event might or might not happen, but that was a bit of a mouthful, so he just called it an event."|"The Black Hole War"|"Leonard Susskind"
"ap 00:00"|"12:00 p.m."|"Here’s a concrete example. Mr. Tortoise and Mr. Hare decide to have a race across Central Park. Officials are stationed at each end with carefully synchronized watches so that they can time the winner. The racers start at exactly 12:00 p.m., and halfway across the park, Hare is so far ahead that he decides to take a nap before continuing. But he oversleeps and wakes up just in time to see Tortoise approaching the finish line. Desperate not to lose the race, Hare takes off like a flash and just manages to catch Tortoise as they simultaneously cross the line."|"The Black Hole War"|"Leonard Susskind"
"ap 02:56"|"2 hours and 56 minutes"|"Tortoise pulls out his highly reliable pocket watch and proudly shows the waiting crowd that the proper time, along the segment of his world line from start to finish, is 2 hours and 56 minutes. But why the new term proper time? Why didn’t Tortoise just say that his time from start to finish was 2 hours and 56 minutes? Isn’t time just time?"|"The Black Hole War"|"Leonard Susskind"
"ap ~ 10:39"|"about 1039"|"Because Planck’s constant is so small, the energy of a single photon is minute. To calculate the energy of a photon of blue light, multiply Planck’s constant by the frequency, 1015 Hz, and you get 6.62 × 10219 joules. That doesn’t sound like much energy, and it’s not. It would take about 1039 photons of blue light to boil your tea. You would need about twice that number of photons of red light. By contrast, with the highest-energy gamma rays that have ever been detected, boiling the same cup of tea would take a mere 1018 photons."|"The Black Hole War"|"Leonard Susskind"
