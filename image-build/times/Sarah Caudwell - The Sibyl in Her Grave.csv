"~ 16:00"|"about four o’clock in the afternoon"|"PROLOGUEFOR CERTAIN OF MY academic colleagues—I resist the temptation to refer in this context to the Bursar—the chief purpose of publication appears to be self-advertisement. Were it so for me, I should no doubt modify my account of the recent curious events in Parsons Haver in such a way as to reflect more credit on myself, for at more than one stage in my consideration of them I reached conclusions which afterwards proved erroneous. It was not until after the last of three mysterious deaths that finally the truth became clear to me.I fear, however, that I myself cannot think it right to attempt to enlist Scholarship in the service of personal vanity or worldly ambition: she is the servant of Truth and can own no other allegiance. Though I may do less to promote my own reputation than I might hope would be to my advantage, and less to enhance the academic standing of my College than some will consider to be my duty, I cannot bring myself to place before you, dear reader, anything but a strictly accurate account of the events I have mentioned. If I thereby have the misfortune to displease the Bursar, I must be resigned to enduring his displeasure.By the same token, I cannot think that it would be seemly for me, as the historian of these events, to present myself as if I had played a leading role in them, thrusting myself on the attention of my readers like an amateur actor, cast as a spear-bearer, ineptly trying to shoulder his way into the spotlight. The place of the historian is not at the centre of the stage but in the shadows at the side, observing and explaining the actions of the protagonists in the drama. I shall not, therefore, take up your time and attention with any description or account of myself.Some of my readers, it is true, have been kind enough to say that they would like to know more about me—what I look like, how I dress, how I spend my leisure hours and other details of a personal and sometimes even intimate nature. I do not doubt, however, that these enquiries are made purely as a matter of courtesy and that to take them au pied de la lettre would be as grave a solecism as to answer a polite “How do you do, Professor Tamar?” with a full account of the state of my digestion. Of what interest can it be to the reader of a work of history whether the writer of it is tall or short, thin or fat, of fair or dark complexion? It would seem to me an impertinence on my part to claim the attention of my readers for such trivia. Maintaining, therefore, that modest reticence which I think becoming to the historian, I shall say no more of myself than that my name is Hilary Tamar and that I am the Tutor in Legal History at St. George’s College, Oxford, of which I have the honour to be a Fellow.In particular, I shall not explain my reasons for deciding, shortly after the end of the summer term, to spend a few days in London: suffice it to say that the Bursar was still in residence at St. George’s and enough is enough. As I have mentioned elsewhere, Timothy Shepherd, a former pupil of mine now in practice at the Chancery Bar, has a flat conveniently situated at the top of Middle Temple Lane: I telephoned him, knowing the generosity of his nature, in reasonably confident hope of an offer of hospitality.Timothy expressed his regret that he himself would be absent during the period I mentioned and thus unable to entertain me in person—he was appearing in a case in Manchester or Brussels or some such place. He kindly invited me, however, to treat the flat as my own during his absence and promised to leave a set of keys for me with Selena Jardine, a member of the same Chambers, to be collected on my arrival in London.At about four o’clock in the afternoon on the Thursday before midsummer, I mounted the steps of 62 New Square and opened the door of the Clerks’ Room, intending to ask Henry, the Senior Clerk, to tell Selena of my arrival."|"The Sibyl in Her Grave"|"Sarah Caudwell"

 Parsons Haver
 West SussexMonday, 21st JuneDear Julia,There is something rather odd, if I may say so, about the tone of your letter—almost as if you thought I’d been doing something wrong. All I’ve done is buy some shares and sell them again—are you going through one of your Socialist phases? If so, do write and tell Ariadne—she’ll be so pleased.But I’m very glad, of course, that you don’t think I have to pay the beastly young man three thousand pounds. I’ve made an appointment to see him this afternoon, to explain about the shares belonging partly to Maurice and Griselda, and they’re both coming round to supper afterwards to hear what he says. We all think you’ve been most helpful, and we’re planning to take you to lunch at the best restaurant in West Sussex next time you’re down here.So I hope you won’t think it too ungrateful of me to say that if you don’t mind I’d much rather not ask Ricky where he got his information from about the shares. The thing is, you see, that I’m not at all pleased with Ricky at the moment, and I don’t want to do anything to make him think that I’ve stopped not being pleased.You may say, I suppose, that it’s unreasonable of me to be not pleased with him. I know he was only advising us as a friend, in exchange for a few drinks, and perhaps one couldn’t expect it all to be confidential in the same way as if one got advice from a solicitor or someone like that. Well, Julia, I don’t care what you say, I still don’t think it’s right for him to go babbling about our affairs to all and sundry.When I say all and sundry, I mean Isabella del Comino, as she calls herself, though I doubt if that’s the name on her birth certificate, or on her marriage certificate, if she has such a thing. Which I dare say she has—men can be complete idiots sometimes.So far as I know, you’ve never met Isabella. If you have, it certainly wasn’t at my house. She lives at the Old Rectory, on the other side of the churchyard, which she bought two or three years ago from rather good friends of mine. They didn’t find it an easy house to sell—it’s one of those rambling Victorian places that cost a fortune to heat and maintain properly. The Church Commissioners very sensibly sold it a long time ago, and kept the little house opposite as the Vicarage. And though it’s quite a handsome building in its way, I always feel there’s something rather cold and forbidding about it—an estate agent would say that there’s a fine view of the church, but one can’t help thinking of it as a view of the graveyard.My friends had made all kinds of improvements to it. They’d turned the ground-floor rooms at the back into one long drawing room, with French windows all the way along opening into a big conservatory, and a colour scheme of honeys and apricots. And from there one went into the garden—oh, Julia, it’s a shame if you never saw the garden. Griselda had laid it out in an Elizabethan sort of style, using a design in an old book Maurice had given her, and gone to endless trouble to get the right plants for it. I found some antique statues and urns and things, and we all felt we’d made it into something rather special. Griselda looked after it practically as if it were her own—she has quite a good view of it from the roof of her potting shed, so she could always see when something needed doing.My friends sold the house without ever actually meeting the purchaser. I suppose she must have come down and looked over it before she bought it, but no one seemed to have seen her. Even after she’d bought it, she didn’t move in straightaway, and there were signs that she was having a good deal of building work done—plumbers’ and electricians’ vans outside the house, and sounds of hammering and drilling. So everyone was beginning to be rather curious about her.And then, one morning when I was sitting in the antique shop, Griselda came running in, as white as a sheet, and said there were men at the Rectory levelling the garden.I could hardly believe it at first, but of course I went back with her to see what was happening, and it was true, they were—just taking a bulldozer across it, destroying everything.I managed to discourage her from climbing over the wall and lying down in front of the bulldozer—Griselda can be rather physical sometimes—and called out to the man in charge to ask him what he thought they were doing. His answer wasn’t at all polite, but I explained to him that we simply didn’t want him to get into trouble for destroying plants which might turn out to be valuable. Anyway, I offered him thirty pounds for the ones that were left and he ended by agreeing to fifty, on the understanding that we’d have to remove them that day.So we spent the day frantically digging up plants in the Rectory garden and running back with them to Griselda’s potting shed. Fortunately, it was one of the days when Mrs. Tyrrell comes to clean for me, so there were three of us to do it, and by midnight we’d rescued pretty well everything that we minded most about—all the rose trees, and the plants from the physic garden. We shared them out between the three of us and gave some to Maurice. At fifty pounds they were really rather a bargain—some of them were quite valuable—but of course it didn’t make up for the garden being destroyed.The next day they flattened it completely, and began to put up something that involved concrete posts and a lot of wire mesh. We couldn’t work out what it was—Griselda said it looked like a cage.Two or three weeks later there were signs of someone being in occupation, though no one had actually seen her arrive—not even Maurice, whose study looks straight out onto the front drive of the Rectory. But there were lights on in the evening, and the postman said he’d started to deliver letters there.We’re very informal down here in Haver—we don’t go in for visiting cards and so forth—but when someone new moves in we usually put a note through the door, introducing ourselves and inviting them to ring us if they need help with anything. So I wrote a short letter along those lines—no, Julia, it was not mere curiosity—and walked across to the Rectory to deliver it. And just as I was putting it in the letter box, the door suddenly opened and I found myself facing a fat, pale woman with fat, black ringlets.When I say that she was fat, I don’t so much mean that she was of enormous size but that she gave the impression of being made of fat, all the way through, with no underlying framework of bone or muscle—which, of course, isn’t actually possible. She had a rather ugly, squashed button sort of nose—I suppose when she was young people would have called it retroussé—and very small black eyes, like currants in a suet pudding. She was wearing a long black velvet caftan, of the kind one can buy cheaply in Tangier or expensively in Knightsbridge—it might have been rather elegant, if it hadn’t shown so many signs of her being a rather careless eater.“Good morning, Mrs. Sheldon, how nice of you to call,” she said. “Won’t you come in and have a glass of sherry?”That looks, when one writes it down, like quite a normal and pleasant thing to say, but it didn’t sound like that. There was something gloating, almost sinister, about the way she said it—as if my name were a secret she’d been very clever to find out and could use against me in some way.I accepted, naturally, and she led me through to the conservatory. As we went in, she said, “I hope you don’t mind birds?”Well, as it happens, I do rather. When they’re flying about in the open air, I don’t mind them at all, but in a confined space with them I get an absurd sense of panic, like you with spiders. I know it’s completely irrational, but that doesn’t stop me feeling it.But of course I said, “Not in the least,” and followed her into the drawing room.She had had it entirely redecorated, no doubt at great expense. The walls were covered with a heavily embossed wallpaper—black. The ceiling and woodwork had been repainted—black. There were thick black velvet curtains, and the floor was tiled in black marble. Poor woman, I suppose she’d expected it to look very dramatic, but of course, with nothing there to provide contrast, the effect was simply dreary.I saw at once that Griselda had been perfectly right about the cage. The conservatory and the area beyond it had been turned into an aviary, now occupied by a flock of ravens—I don’t know how many exactly, but there must have been at least a dozen. It wouldn’t have been so bad if the French windows had been closed, with the ravens safely on the far side—but they were open, and the horrible creatures were flapping and hopping about the drawing room as if they owned the place. The worst of it was, though, that when they weren’t moving they were more or less invisible against the black background—I thought that at any moment I might accidentally brush against one. I began, I’m afraid, to feel rather sick, and almost to wish I hadn’t come.She poured me a tumblerful of sherry—such an excessive amount that I couldn’t think of it as generous, but more as a device to make me stay longer than I might have chosen—and invited me to sit down. Which I did, with considerable caution, on one of three chaises longues—I need hardly say, upholstered in black—which provided the seating accommodation.The room was quite sparsely furnished—I couldn’t tell whether from choice, or because she hadn’t finished unpacking. There were no pictures or ornaments or books. Or, rather, just one book—it looked like one of those old family Bibles, so big you can hardly lift them. Isabella seemed to regard it as an object of interest, or even veneration—she’d put it on its own in a display cabinet at the far end of the room from where we were sitting. I resisted the temptation to ask for a closer look at it—the rest of that end of the room was in deep shadow, which I suspected of harbouring still more of the beastly ravens.She asked me what I thought of her colour scheme. I said that it was interesting.“Ah,” she said, “I didn’t think it would be quite to your taste.” She said it with a smile which suggested that her taste was bold and adventurous, while mine was timidly conventional.“Black’s such a difficult colour,” I said, “if one isn’t an experienced designer.”“Ah, yes,” she said, “I know you’re the village expert on design.”“That’s a far too flattering description,” I said. “I haven’t worked seriously as a designer since I lived in Paris.”Our conversation might have been more memorable if my attention hadn’t been distracted all the time by the flappings and cawings of the birds. Not much more memorable, though, because Isabella is one of those tiresome people who enjoy being mysterious about themselves. Trying to show a polite degree of interest in her, I asked if she had any special reason for choosing Parsons Haver for her retirement—she seemed of the sort of age to have recently retired, though from what profession one wouldn’t have cared to speculate.“Oh,” she said, “I haven’t exactly retired.” And she gave a wouldn’t-you-like-to-know little smile, as if knowing her occupation were my dearest wish and I would beg her to tell me.In case you happen to be tormented by curiosity on the subject, I found out later that the profession from which she had “not exactly retired” was what I would call fortune-telling, but I gather is nowadays called psychic counselling. On this occasion, though, I didn’t ask her any more questions about herself but simply invited her to ask me anything she’d like to know about shops and buses and so forth. I did also mention that if she wanted anyone to clean for her, I could thoroughly recommend Mrs. Tyrrell—Mrs. Tyrrell is a single mother, and I thought she might be pleased to do a few extra hours.“Oh no, thank you,” she said. “Women of that class are such gossips, aren’t they?” Women of that class indeed—some people are enough to turn anyone Socialist. “Anyway, I have my niece to do that sort of thing.”“Oh really?” I said, rather surprised to hear that there was another member of the household, and wondering where she was. “How nice for you to have such a devoted niece. I’m afraid mine’s far too busy with her practice at the Bar to come and do my housework for me.”“Oh yes, I’d heard you had a clever niece,” said Isabella. “Daphne’s not clever. She isn’t really my niece, she’s my cousin’s daughter. Still, her mother was more like a sister to me than my damn sister’s ever been, so when she died I had to take over Daphne.” She talked as if the girl were a servant—not that anyone has servants nowadays and even when they did no well-bred person would have talked about them like that—as if she were some kind of object which Isabella owned.I said that, whatever the relationship, I looked forward to meeting her.“Oh, you can see her now, if you like,” said Isabella, and shouted “Daphne, come here,” like a man calling a dog. A man one wouldn’t much like, to a dog he enjoyed ill-treating.There was a noise of something breaking in the kitchen, and a girl came in—an awkward, skinny little thing, all knees and elbows, somewhere in her early twenties. Not, I have to say, at all a pretty girl—lank brown hair, a poor complexion, a rather receding chin and overprominent front teeth. She had quite large brown eyes, which should have been her best feature, but very listless and watery looking—do always remember, Julia, that the expression “bright with unshed tears” is a most misleading one. Still, I’ve seen women with fewer natural advantages persuade half London that they were irresistible—a little makeup and a little animation can do wonders.“Daphne,” said Isabella, “this is Mrs. Sheldon, who’s kindly come to see how we’re getting on—say ‘How do you do’ to her.”The poor girl obediently stammered the words out and then stood jiggling about from one foot to the other, pushing down her skirt with the palms of her hands as if she were hoping to make it cover her knees. It was certainly far too short—I mean, the sort of length one should only wear if one has very nice legs and is wearing pretty underwear—and looked like something she had had in her teens and grown out of. As her hands were moist and not very clean, all she achieved was to make the skirt even grubbier than it already was.I was trying to think of something kind and encouraging to say to her when something moved in the shadows at the far end of the room. And screeched. And flapped its wings. Something much larger than a raven.I do strongly advise you, Julia, to try to conquer your feelings about spiders—one really never knows what embarrassments these ridiculous phobias can get one into. As you’ll have gathered, I was already more disconcerted than I would have liked by finding myself in the same room as a dozen or so ravens. When I realised that I was also sharing it with a vulture, I came closer to screaming than I care to admit.“Oh,” said Isabella, “this is my friend Roderigo. I do hope he didn’t startle you?”It was all I could do to say “What a handsome creature” and remember an urgent appointment at the Vicarage. And I wouldn’t want you, Julia, to find yourself at a similar disadvantage in a situation involving a tarantula."|"The Sibyl in Her Grave"|"Sarah Caudwell"
"~ 19:00"|"about seven in the evening"|"You’ll have gathered, I expect, that neither Maurice nor I was much taken with Isabella, and even if she’d been a perfect angel Griselda wouldn’t have forgiven her for destroying the garden. So we were all a little surprised when Ricky began to be quite friendly with her. They’d apparently known each other in London some years ago—she invited him round for drinks soon after she moved in and since then he’s been a regular visitor.Well, of course, Ricky’s old enough to choose his friends for himself, and if he enjoys Isabella’s company that’s no one’s business but his own—one just finds it slightly odd, that’s all. Apart from anything else, he’s always been rather an enthusiast for comfort and good cooking, and I wouldn’t imagine there’s much of either to be had at the Rectory these days. So presumably there’s some other attraction—there are men, I know, who like women who don’t wash much.Still, as I say, that’s no one else’s business. The only tiresome thing, as far as I’m concerned, is that he put her up for membership of our little boating and tennis club, and she seems to spend half her time there. It’s just a small clubhouse and bar overlooking the river, with a couple of tennis courts, but it used to be a convenient place to meet friends if none of us felt like entertaining at home. Now one can only go there if one’s in the mood for running into Isabella, which in my case isn’t often.But I suppose it’s rather unkind of me to resent her being there so much—without it, so far as I can see, she’d have no social life at all. Since neither she nor Daphne can drive a car, and public transport is beneath her dignity, she doesn’t get about much outside the village. She hasn’t made many friends since she arrived here, and if she had any before then, they evidently aren’t close enough to come and visit her. The fortune-telling business seems to be done mostly by correspondence—Mrs. Makepeace at the Post Office says she gets quite a lot of letters.There is one exception, which I have to admit we’re all very curious about. Every four or five weeks or so, at about seven in the evening, a large black Mercedes car with tinted windows drives rather fast into Parsons Haver and straight to the Rectory, where it parks in the part of the drive that is hidden from view by the shrubbery—this could be pure chance, but no one in the village believes that. The man who gets out of it rings at the front door and is let in. After two or three hours, he comes out and drives off again equally fast, heading towards London.And what everyone wants to know is—who is he? We all agree he must be rich or he wouldn’t have a Mercedes. And famous, or he wouldn’t need tinted windows. But is he a famous footballer? Or a television personality? Or a member of the Royal Family? These are the main possibilities put forward in the bar of the Newt and Ninepence—in some circles he’s thought to be something far more sinister.The only person who’s actually seen him is Maurice. His study window is the one place in Haver with a clear view of the Rectory doorway, and he’s seen the man quite plainly several times. But that’s no use to anyone, because Maurice is almost as unobservant as you are—is it something that happens to people who read Classics at Oxford? All he can find to say about the man is that he’s an ordinary, middle-aged man, in a City suit.The visits of the black Mercedes are at irregular intervals, but one can always tell when it’s expected. Poor Daphne is banished from the Rectory at about six o’clock, with just enough money to buy herself a sandwich and a glass of wine, and sits hunched up all evening in a corner of the Newt and Ninepence, looking like a puppy that’s been turned outdoors in disgrace and doesn’t understand why.If I see her in there, of course, I say “Good evening” and buy her another glass of wine. She used to be very hesitant about accepting—she was obviously embarrassed, poor girl, that she couldn’t buy me one back—but now she seems used to the idea. And she always tells me that she has to stay out all evening, because Aunt Isabella is giving a Personal Reading—one can hear the capital letters—and anyone else in the house would disturb the vibrations. So it looks as if the visits are professional, rather than personal.It’s really too mean of Isabella—if she wants the girl out of the house, she might at least give her enough to go into Brighton to enjoy herself a bit. She doesn’t seem even to give her pocket money, let alone any proper wages. I suppose one would say that she pays for Daphne’s keep, but she certainly doesn’t buy her any clothes—or if she does, it must be at jumble sales. I’ve never seen Daphne in a pretty dress—really, some of her things look as if she’d got them from someone’s dustbin, and not a very clean one either.I don’t say Isabella physically ill treats her—though Griselda’s sure she does—but her feet are always rubbed sore from going without stockings in badly fitting shoes, and she often has quite painful-looking peck marks on her face.Griselda gets very upset and indignant about it all, and says that we ought to do something. But what? One can’t ring the RSPCA or the cruelty-to-children people—Daphne’s not a child or an animal, she’s a grown-up human being, not all that much younger than you are.And she’s not a prisoner—she could leave Isabella tomorrow if she chose. But if she did, where would she go, and what would she do? She isn’t qualified for anything—Isabella’s brought her up to think that “what they teach you in school isn’t true knowledge” and exams aren’t important, so of course she’s never passed any. And she certainly wouldn’t get a job on the strength of her looks or personality.In any case, she doesn’t want to leave. If one asks her what she wants to do with her life, she looks very round-eyed and earnest and says, “I just want to feel I’m caring for someone who needs me.” And she seems to believe that Isabella does. Why a grown woman in the prime of life and possession of all her faculties should need a full-time personal attendant I can’t very well imagine, but she’s somehow persuaded Daphne—”brainwashed” says Griselda—that she’s not merely an invalid but practically a saint, who’s sacrificed her health in the cause of helping others, and it’s an honour and privilege to serve her.Personally, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with Isabella’s health that a little fresh air and exercise wouldn’t put right, and I feel there are probably more effective ways of helping people than telling them to avoid travel when the sun’s in Capricorn and distrust dark-haired strangers when Mercury’s in the ascendant or whatever it is she does. One can’t say that to Daphne though—any criticism of Isabella almost reduces her to tears.Which does make talking to her rather a strain on one’s patience. Her conversation consists almost entirely of quotes from the same source—”Aunt Isabella always says this” and “Aunt Isabella always says that”—as solemnly pronounced as if she were citing Scripture. Someone has evidently told her that it’s polite to talk to people about things they’re interested in, but she hasn’t quite grasped how it works in practice. So her idea of conversing politely with me is to tell me Isabella’s views about art—“Aunt Isabella says real artists don’t need to go to art school, they’re born knowing how to paint”—and with Griselda Isabella’s views about gardens—”Aunt Isabella says it’s cruel to shut flowers up in flower beds, they ought to be allowed to grow naturally.” Even if I liked Isabella I’d be getting heartily sick of her.Blast the woman—I’ve talked as much about her as if I found her almost as interesting as she thinks she is, and still not explained why I’m not pleased with Ricky.Well, as I think I told you, the last company that Ricky advised us to invest in was one called Giddly Gadgets. Just after we sold our shares in it, and while we were wondering whether or not to reinvest the proceeds, I happened to be in the wine merchant’s, being tempted by a rather delicious claret they had in, much more expensive than I usually buy. I was trying to make up my mind if I could afford half a case of it when Isabella came in, attended by Daphne to do the carrying. She doesn’t usually do her own shopping, of course, but the wine merchant counts as grand enough to deserve a personal visit.I didn’t want to stay and make conversation, so when we’d exchanged good-mornings I gave my usual order and told the young man serving me that the claret was really too expensive. And Isabella smiled at me, in that infuriating way she has, as if she knew something you didn’t want her to know, and said, “Ah—what a pity Giddly Gadgets didn’t do better.”“Yes, isn’t it?” I said, and walked out of the shop feeling absolutely furious.As I say, if Ricky chooses to be friends with Isabella that’s entirely his own business, but he must have known that she’s the last person on earth whom Griselda or Maurice or I would want to know any details of our financial affairs. And he was absolutely the only person who could possibly have told her about us investing in Giddly Gadgets—anyway, I rang him to say how surprised I was, and he didn’t deny it.So you’ll understand, if you don’t mind very much, and think it too ungrateful of me, that I’d rather not ask him where he got his information from.Yours with much love,
 RegFew of the tables in the Corkscrew were still occupied: it was thought time for the proceedings of the Restoration Committee to be adjourned. Even Julia could not be persuaded to linger for another glass of wine: fearing that the interview with the young man from the Revenue might for some reason have proceeded less smoothly than it should have done, she was anxious to telephone again to find out what had happened."|"The Sibyl in Her Grave"|"Sarah Caudwell"

I suppose one would say that she pays for Daphne’s keep, but she certainly doesn’t buy her any clothes—or if she does, it must be at jumble sales. I’ve never seen Daphne in a pretty dress—really, some of her things look as if she’d got them from someone’s dustbin, and not a very clean one either.I don’t say Isabella physically ill treats her—though Griselda’s sure she does—but her feet are always rubbed sore from going without stockings in badly fitting shoes, and she often has quite painful-looking peck marks on her face.Griselda gets very upset and indignant about it all, and says that we ought to do something. But what? One can’t ring the RSPCA or the cruelty-to-children people—Daphne’s not a child or an animal, she’s a grown-up human being, not all that much younger than you are.And she’s not a prisoner—she could leave Isabella tomorrow if she chose. But if she did, where would she go, and what would she do? She isn’t qualified for anything—Isabella’s brought her up to think that “what they teach you in school isn’t true knowledge” and exams aren’t important, so of course she’s never passed any. And she certainly wouldn’t get a job on the strength of her looks or personality.In any case, she doesn’t want to leave. If one asks her what she wants to do with her life, she looks very round-eyed and earnest and says, “I just want to feel I’m caring for someone who needs me.” And she seems to believe that Isabella does. Why a grown woman in the prime of life and possession of all her faculties should need a full-time personal attendant I can’t very well imagine, but she’s somehow persuaded Daphne—”brainwashed” says Griselda—that she’s not merely an invalid but practically a saint, who’s sacrificed her health in the cause of helping others, and it’s an honour and privilege to serve her.Personally, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with Isabella’s health that a little fresh air and exercise wouldn’t put right, and I feel there are probably more effective ways of helping people than telling them to avoid travel when the sun’s in Capricorn and distrust dark-haired strangers when Mercury’s in the ascendant or whatever it is she does. One can’t say that to Daphne though—any criticism of Isabella almost reduces her to tears.Which does make talking to her rather a strain on one’s patience. Her conversation consists almost entirely of quotes from the same source—”Aunt Isabella always says this” and “Aunt Isabella always says that”—as solemnly pronounced as if she were citing Scripture. Someone has evidently told her that it’s polite to talk to people about things they’re interested in, but she hasn’t quite grasped how it works in practice. So her idea of conversing politely with me is to tell me Isabella’s views about art—“Aunt Isabella says real artists don’t need to go to art school, they’re born knowing how to paint”—and with Griselda Isabella’s views about gardens—”Aunt Isabella says it’s cruel to shut flowers up in flower beds, they ought to be allowed to grow naturally.” Even if I liked Isabella I’d be getting heartily sick of her.Blast the woman—I’ve talked as much about her as if I found her almost as interesting as she thinks she is, and still not explained why I’m not pleased with Ricky.Well, as I think I told you, the last company that Ricky advised us to invest in was one called Giddly Gadgets. Just after we sold our shares in it, and while we were wondering whether or not to reinvest the proceeds, I happened to be in the wine merchant’s, being tempted by a rather delicious claret they had in, much more expensive than I usually buy. I was trying to make up my mind if I could afford half a case of it when Isabella came in, attended by Daphne to do the carrying. She doesn’t usually do her own shopping, of course, but the wine merchant counts as grand enough to deserve a personal visit.I didn’t want to stay and make conversation, so when we’d exchanged good-mornings I gave my usual order and told the young man serving me that the claret was really too expensive. And Isabella smiled at me, in that infuriating way she has, as if she knew something you didn’t want her to know, and said, “Ah—what a pity Giddly Gadgets didn’t do better.”“Yes, isn’t it?” I said, and walked out of the shop feeling absolutely furious.As I say, if Ricky chooses to be friends with Isabella that’s entirely his own business, but he must have known that she’s the last person on earth whom Griselda or Maurice or I would want to know any details of our financial affairs. And he was absolutely the only person who could possibly have told her about us investing in Giddly Gadgets—anyway, I rang him to say how surprised I was, and he didn’t deny it.So you’ll understand, if you don’t mind very much, and think it too ungrateful of me, that I’d rather not ask him where he got his information from.Yours with much love,
 RegFew of the tables in the Corkscrew were still occupied: it was thought time for the proceedings of the Restoration Committee to be adjourned. Even Julia could not be persuaded to linger for another glass of wine: fearing that the interview with the young man from the Revenue might for some reason have proceeded less smoothly than it should have done, she was anxious to telephone again to find out what had happened."|"The Sibyl in Her Grave"|"Sarah Caudwell"

 West SussexTuesday, 22nd JuneDear Julia,Do forgive me if I was slightly distrait when you rang earlier—I’d had a rather trying day. I suppose, if I’m going to tell you properly about it, that I ought to start with yesterday evening.I’d had a most satisfactory interview with the income tax man and it occurred to me, as I was beginning to get supper ready for Maurice and Griselda, that we had a first-rate excuse for champagne. So I ran down to the wine merchant’s and bought a couple of bottles, and on my way back I saw poor Daphne, sitting all by herself on a bench outside the Newt and Ninepence.I was rather surprised to see her there. The black Mercedes had been seen here less than a week ago, and there’s usually at least a month between its visits. I didn’t feel I had time, though, to stop and talk to her, so I waved and went on my way.But a moment or two later she came running after me and seized hold of my shopping basket, saying it looked much too heavy for me and I must let her carry it. I could hardly take it back from her by physical force—which it almost seemed I’d have to, she was so determined—so I let her go on carrying it, and she came trotting home beside me.It seemed churlish, when we got back, simply to say thank you and shut the door in her face, so I invited her in for a sherry. It struck me, as I was giving it to her, that she looked even more miserable than usual—I mean, not just as if she might be going to cry, but as if she’d been crying a good deal already. So I asked her whether anything was the matter.“Nothing—I don’t know—everything,” said Daphne, and did indeed burst into tears.It wasn’t easy, between the sobs and the stammers, to make out exactly what she was upset about. In the end, it seemed simply to come down to this—that Isabella was giving her second “Personal Reading” in the space of a week, and Daphne thought she was dangerously overtaxing her strength. I’m afraid I may have looked rather sceptical.With more sobs and stammers, Daphne said that I didn’t understand. No one understood. No one understood what Isabella put into a Personal Reading. No one knew how exhausted she was for days afterwards. She ought to be still resting after the last one. And Isabella wouldn’t admit to physical weakness, and said she just had a cold, but Daphne knew there was something badly wrong with her. She didn’t know how, she just knew. And something awful was going to happen, and she didn’t know what to do about it. More tears.Well, what could I do? I thought she was talking nonsense, of course, but I didn’t have the heart to pack her off to sit on her own in the Newt. So I told her that if she’d stop crying, I’d lend her a comb and facecloth to tidy herself up with, and she was welcome to stay for supper. I didn’t think Maurice or Griselda would mind—I had quite enough food for four, and I knew they both felt sorry for her.It was a beautiful evening, and the garden’s at its best at the moment, so we ate out of doors. It was a very simple meal, just a salmon mousse with salad and new potatoes, and some strawberries afterwards, but it went quite well with the champagne, and everyone seemed to enjoy it.Daphne had two helpings of everything, and said it was the best meal she’d ever had. Which, without unduly flattering myself, I could all too easily believe, poor girl.The conversation, I have to admit, didn’t exactly sparkle, though I’m sure that Daphne was doing her best—like a little girl at a grown-up party, trying hard to do the proper thing but not quite knowing what it is. She didn’t seem to realise that people don’t always mean exactly what they say, not because they’re insincere but because they’re making a joke about something. And she evidently expected Maurice to keep talking about religion, which of course he wouldn’t dream of doing over dinner.A minute or two after ten she said she had to go home, in case Isabella needed her for anything before she went to bed. Maurice said that he ought to be leaving too—he had to be up early to take morning service at a church ten miles away—and suggested that they should keep each other company across the churchyard. Dear Maurice—he’d normally have stayed much later, morning service or no morning service, but he wouldn’t have liked to let Daphne go home in the dark by herself.He rang a few minutes later, to say they were both safely home—he’d waited at the gate of the Rectory to make sure she got in all right, and he’d heard Isabella shout out to Daphne that she wasn’t needed and telling her to go to bed. The visitor had evidently left—Maurice said he’d seen no sign of the black Mercedes.So it sounded as if Daphne’s anxieties had been as misplaced as I thought.I usually wake up at about seven, but this morning I was woken earlier than that by the sound of someone ringing my doorbell. Not just ringing and stopping and going away again, like the postman leaving a parcel, but going on ringing, as if they didn’t mean to stop until I’d answered. I looked out of my bedroom window and saw that it was Daphne, so I put on my dressing gown and slippers and went down to let her in.She was in such a state of agitation, and stammering so badly, poor girl, that I could make no sense at all of what she was trying to say. All I could gather was that something was seriously wrong—or at least that she thought there was—and she wanted me to come straight back with her to the Rectory. So without being sure there was any real urgency, but not liking to take a chance on it, I put on my raincoat over my dressing gown and ran back with her across the churchyard.She’d left the front door open. We went straight in, and through the hallway to the black drawing room.The first thing I noticed was the smell—it was the first thing anyone would have noticed. A perfectly disgusting smell, acrid and sweet at the same time, mainly, I suppose, of bird droppings, but as if someone had tried to sweeten it with something else—incense or camphor or something like that. The second thing I noticed was the vulture, perched on the back of one of the chaises longues. The third was Isabella, lolling on another of them, dressed in the caftan she’d worn on my first visit, with her little black eyes staring at me without blinking, out of her white pudding face. I almost apologised for my intrusion.“She’s been sitting there like that since I came down this morning,” said Daphne. “She doesn’t seem to hear what I say to her. There’s something wrong with her.”I knew straightaway what was wrong with her, and I could hardly believe that Daphne still hadn’t realised. I tried taking her pulse, and the other things they tell one to do in first-aid classes, but I already knew she was dead. The vulture knew it too, and was looking at Isabella in a way I didn’t much care for.I didn’t think I was the right person to break the news—I asked Daphne who her aunt’s doctor was.“Aunt Isabella doesn’t believe in doctors,” she said, looking more frightened than ever. “She says that Nature has a cure for everything if you know how to look for it.”I said that nonetheless her aunt must have professional attention, and sent her off in the end to fetch Dr. Selkirk. He’s not the doctor I’d normally call-a bad-tempered little Scotsman, semiretired, with a bee in his bonnet about keeping fit, and not much in the way of a bedside manner—but he was the one who lived nearest. I knew at that hour of the morning he was more likely to answer the doorbell than the telephone, and I thought that with any luck she could bring him back to the Rectory in ten minutes or so.If I’d gone myself, I could have probably persuaded him more quickly, but I couldn’t leave poor Daphne on her own with a corpse, and we couldn’t both go. I’ve lived in Egypt and Syria, and I’ve seen what buzzards can do. So someone had to stay and discourage the vulture.I don’t know quite how long I waited for them—it seemed a good deal more than the mauvais quart d’heure I’d bargained for. Isabella still seemed to be staring at me with her little black-currant eyes, and from time to time the horrible Roderigo spread his wings and screeched at me. Having only my nightclothes on under my raincoat made me feel ridiculously defenceless, and I wished I’d something more effective than my bare hands to ward him off with if he tried to challenge me for his breakfast.The worst thing of all, though, was still the smell—it wasn’t simply disgusting but somehow narcotic, so that I felt dizzy as well as sick from it. I wondered if Isabella and her visitor had been smoking marijuana—I suppose it would be quite an effective way to heighten the atmosphere for a séance, or whatever one’s supposed to call it. It’s some years since I smoked any, and I don’t remember the effects being so unpleasant—but that was in Paris and in better company.There were no ashtrays, though, and no traces of smoke in the room, so perhaps I was wrong about that. There weren’t any dirty glasses, either, which struck me as rather odd. Whatever else one might say about Isabella, I wouldn’t have thought she’d have sat all evening with a visitor without offering him a drink, and having one herself. Anyway, there were two empty champagne bottles in the wastepaper basket.And Daphne had been sent straight to bed when she got home the night before, so she couldn’t have washed them then, and she certainly wouldn’t have stopped to do it after she found Isabella in the morning.Well, of course, it wasn’t really at all odd—it simply meant that Isabella had washed the glasses herself, and then come back and sat down again on the chaise longue. That’s not at all an odd thing to do—it’s what I’d have done myself. Just not what I’d have expected Isabella to do—I’d have bet almost any sum you like to mention that she’d have left them for Daphne. Which shows how one can misjudge people. Or perhaps she’d just taken them through to the kitchen, and left them there to be washed.It occurred to me, thinking of the kitchen, that I might find something there that I could use to ward off Roderigo. So I went quickly in there, leaving the door open so that I could keep an eye on him, and found just what I wanted—a long-handled broom, which made me feel much braver. But no dirty glasses anywhere, so Isabella must have washed them up after all. And yet somehow I still just couldn’t imagine her doing it, so I decided that it must have been her visitor—the man in the black Mercedes.Dr. Selkirk, when he at last arrived, declined to examine the patient in the presence of the vulture. At the cost of several savage pecks, Daphne managed to remove the bird to the conservatory. After that, we waited at the far end of the room while the doctor carried out his examination.“Heart,” he said, when he’d finished. “What did she expect, carrying all that weight?” He seldom misses a chance to point out the dangers of obesity.“Will she have to go to hospital?” asked poor Daphne.“It’s not the hospital she’s needing,” said Selkirk, with his usual tact. “It’s the undertaker’s. She’s dead, lassie—been dead for hours.”And poor Daphne threw herself down on the floor and howled.You’ll understand by this time why it’s been a trying day. It’s now nearly midnight, and I thought when I came to bed that I’d go straight to sleep. But I found I couldn’t, and decided to write to you instead.The funeral’s on Friday, and with Daphne having no close family I somehow feel responsible for seeing that it all goes properly. There are all sorts of things that I could quite reasonably be lying awake and worrying about—like how to make Daphne presentable for it, and what to give people to eat, and whether we can find anyone to say a few words about how nice Isabella was.What seems to be stopping me from sleeping, though, isn’t any of those things but a perfectly idiotic question of no importance at all, which is nagging away at me like a clue in the crossword that one hasn’t managed to get the answer to. As soon as I close my eyes, the absurd question which comes into my head and starts buzzing round there is, “Do men with Mercedes cars usually wash their own glasses?”Yours with very much love,

It was a very simple meal, just a salmon mousse with salad and new potatoes, and some strawberries afterwards, but it went quite well with the champagne, and everyone seemed to enjoy it.Daphne had two helpings of everything, and said it was the best meal she’d ever had. Which, without unduly flattering myself, I could all too easily believe, poor girl.The conversation, I have to admit, didn’t exactly sparkle, though I’m sure that Daphne was doing her best—like a little girl at a grown-up party, trying hard to do the proper thing but not quite knowing what it is. She didn’t seem to realise that people don’t always mean exactly what they say, not because they’re insincere but because they’re making a joke about something. And she evidently expected Maurice to keep talking about religion, which of course he wouldn’t dream of doing over dinner.A minute or two after ten she said she had to go home, in case Isabella needed her for anything before she went to bed. Maurice said that he ought to be leaving too—he had to be up early to take morning service at a church ten miles away—and suggested that they should keep each other company across the churchyard. Dear Maurice—he’d normally have stayed much later, morning service or no morning service, but he wouldn’t have liked to let Daphne go home in the dark by herself.He rang a few minutes later, to say they were both safely home—he’d waited at the gate of the Rectory to make sure she got in all right, and he’d heard Isabella shout out to Daphne that she wasn’t needed and telling her to go to bed. The visitor had evidently left—Maurice said he’d seen no sign of the black Mercedes.So it sounded as if Daphne’s anxieties had been as misplaced as I thought.I usually wake up at about seven, but this morning I was woken earlier than that by the sound of someone ringing my doorbell. Not just ringing and stopping and going away again, like the postman leaving a parcel, but going on ringing, as if they didn’t mean to stop until I’d answered. I looked out of my bedroom window and saw that it was Daphne, so I put on my dressing gown and slippers and went down to let her in.She was in such a state of agitation, and stammering so badly, poor girl, that I could make no sense at all of what she was trying to say. All I could gather was that something was seriously wrong—or at least that she thought there was—and she wanted me to come straight back with her to the Rectory. So without being sure there was any real urgency, but not liking to take a chance on it, I put on my raincoat over my dressing gown and ran back with her across the churchyard.She’d left the front door open. We went straight in, and through the hallway to the black drawing room.The first thing I noticed was the smell—it was the first thing anyone would have noticed. A perfectly disgusting smell, acrid and sweet at the same time, mainly, I suppose, of bird droppings, but as if someone had tried to sweeten it with something else—incense or camphor or something like that. The second thing I noticed was the vulture, perched on the back of one of the chaises longues. The third was Isabella, lolling on another of them, dressed in the caftan she’d worn on my first visit, with her little black eyes staring at me without blinking, out of her white pudding face. I almost apologised for my intrusion.“She’s been sitting there like that since I came down this morning,” said Daphne. “She doesn’t seem to hear what I say to her. There’s something wrong with her.”I knew straightaway what was wrong with her, and I could hardly believe that Daphne still hadn’t realised. I tried taking her pulse, and the other things they tell one to do in first-aid classes, but I already knew she was dead. The vulture knew it too, and was looking at Isabella in a way I didn’t much care for.I didn’t think I was the right person to break the news—I asked Daphne who her aunt’s doctor was.“Aunt Isabella doesn’t believe in doctors,” she said, looking more frightened than ever. “She says that Nature has a cure for everything if you know how to look for it.”I said that nonetheless her aunt must have professional attention, and sent her off in the end to fetch Dr. Selkirk. He’s not the doctor I’d normally call-a bad-tempered little Scotsman, semiretired, with a bee in his bonnet about keeping fit, and not much in the way of a bedside manner—but he was the one who lived nearest. I knew at that hour of the morning he was more likely to answer the doorbell than the telephone, and I thought that with any luck she could bring him back to the Rectory in ten minutes or so.If I’d gone myself, I could have probably persuaded him more quickly, but I couldn’t leave poor Daphne on her own with a corpse, and we couldn’t both go. I’ve lived in Egypt and Syria, and I’ve seen what buzzards can do. So someone had to stay and discourage the vulture.I don’t know quite how long I waited for them—it seemed a good deal more than the mauvais quart d’heure I’d bargained for. Isabella still seemed to be staring at me with her little black-currant eyes, and from time to time the horrible Roderigo spread his wings and screeched at me. Having only my nightclothes on under my raincoat made me feel ridiculously defenceless, and I wished I’d something more effective than my bare hands to ward him off with if he tried to challenge me for his breakfast.The worst thing of all, though, was still the smell—it wasn’t simply disgusting but somehow narcotic, so that I felt dizzy as well as sick from it. I wondered if Isabella and her visitor had been smoking marijuana—I suppose it would be quite an effective way to heighten the atmosphere for a séance, or whatever one’s supposed to call it. It’s some years since I smoked any, and I don’t remember the effects being so unpleasant—but that was in Paris and in better company.There were no ashtrays, though, and no traces of smoke in the room, so perhaps I was wrong about that. There weren’t any dirty glasses, either, which struck me as rather odd. Whatever else one might say about Isabella, I wouldn’t have thought she’d have sat all evening with a visitor without offering him a drink, and having one herself. Anyway, there were two empty champagne bottles in the wastepaper basket.And Daphne had been sent straight to bed when she got home the night before, so she couldn’t have washed them then, and she certainly wouldn’t have stopped to do it after she found Isabella in the morning.Well, of course, it wasn’t really at all odd—it simply meant that Isabella had washed the glasses herself, and then come back and sat down again on the chaise longue. That’s not at all an odd thing to do—it’s what I’d have done myself. Just not what I’d have expected Isabella to do—I’d have bet almost any sum you like to mention that she’d have left them for Daphne. Which shows how one can misjudge people. Or perhaps she’d just taken them through to the kitchen, and left them there to be washed.It occurred to me, thinking of the kitchen, that I might find something there that I could use to ward off Roderigo. So I went quickly in there, leaving the door open so that I could keep an eye on him, and found just what I wanted—a long-handled broom, which made me feel much braver. But no dirty glasses anywhere, so Isabella must have washed them up after all. And yet somehow I still just couldn’t imagine her doing it, so I decided that it must have been her visitor—the man in the black Mercedes.Dr. Selkirk, when he at last arrived, declined to examine the patient in the presence of the vulture. At the cost of several savage pecks, Daphne managed to remove the bird to the conservatory. After that, we waited at the far end of the room while the doctor carried out his examination.“Heart,” he said, when he’d finished. “What did she expect, carrying all that weight?” He seldom misses a chance to point out the dangers of obesity.“Will she have to go to hospital?” asked poor Daphne.“It’s not the hospital she’s needing,” said Selkirk, with his usual tact. “It’s the undertaker’s. She’s dead, lassie—been dead for hours.”And poor Daphne threw herself down on the floor and howled.You’ll understand by this time why it’s been a trying day. It’s now nearly midnight, and I thought when I came to bed that I’d go straight to sleep. But I found I couldn’t, and decided to write to you instead.The funeral’s on Friday, and with Daphne having no close family I somehow feel responsible for seeing that it all goes properly. There are all sorts of things that I could quite reasonably be lying awake and worrying about—like how to make Daphne presentable for it, and what to give people to eat, and whether we can find anyone to say a few words about how nice Isabella was.What seems to be stopping me from sleeping, though, isn’t any of those things but a perfectly idiotic question of no importance at all, which is nagging away at me like a clue in the crossword that one hasn’t managed to get the answer to. As soon as I close my eyes, the absurd question which comes into my head and starts buzzing round there is, “Do men with Mercedes cars usually wash their own glasses?”Yours with very much love,

 West SussexFriday, 16th JulyDear Julia,I’m sorry I had to cancel our lunch. In London nowadays, I suppose, you’re all quite used to people being burgled and wouldn’t dream of letting it interfere with your social engagements. Down here, though, it’s still something of an event.It happened just before midnight last night. Daphne was asleep in bed, but she was woken up by the vulture screeching. It doesn’t usually do that at night, she says, so she knew that something was wrong. She ran downstairs in her nightdress and into the drawing room and saw a man trying to break open the display cabinet—the one that contains the Book.She screamed and he turned around. He had a knife or a chisel or something like that in his hand and she was frightened that he was going to attack her. She ran out through the front door and across the road to the Vicarage, still screaming, and rang the doorbell until Maurice answered it.Maurice rang the police and then me, so I was up most of the night soothing Daphne and making tea for people. Which is why I didn’t feel at all like catching the train to London this morning.The police came in the form of a young sergeant and an even younger woman police constable. They were quite pleasant and sympathetic, but they didn’t seem very hopeful of catching the burglar. One can’t really blame them—he had a black balaclava over his head and a long black raincoat over the rest of him, so Daphne wasn’t able to give them much of a description. She said that she thought he was quite tall, but that seemed only to mean that he was taller than she is.They’re treating it as a fairly amateur sort of crime. They think that the burglar found the back door unlocked—it was open when they went round the house—and was simply making the most of his chances. Daphne, on the other hand, swears that it was locked when she went to bed and he must have used something quite sophisticated, like a skeleton key, to open it. She’s convinced that he broke in on purpose to steal the Book.But when the police asked if they could examine it she wouldn’t let them—in fact she became almost hysterical at the idea. It isn’t lawful for anyone except the Custodian to read the Book or even touch it, and if they do, something terrible will happen to them. The police didn’t find this very helpful.Even Maurice can’t persuade her to explain sensibly what the Book is supposed to be or what’s in it or why anyone might want to steal it. She simply says that the Book has its enemies and the enemies of the Book are the enemies of the Custodian, but it isn’t lawful for her to try to explain who they are.She’s quite worryingly peculiar on the subject. If the idea of being the Custodian cheered her up and gave her a bit of confidence in herself one wouldn’t mind, however silly it was, but in fact I think it rather frightens her. She talks about the Book as if it weren’t a thing but a person—not a very nice person either, someone rather cruel and vindictive, who’ll punish her if she doesn’t do what it wants her to.She also thinks she can read the future in it. She came round a couple of days ago, when Griselda was working in my garden, to warn her very earnestly that during August she should keep away from animals—not the most practical advice to a woman with three cats.According to the Book, apparently, August is going to be the Month of the Animals. This means that animals are going to be very significant in all our lives and intensify the effect of all the other influences. For some reason August is a dangerous month for Griselda, so it’ll be particularly dangerous for her to have anything to do with animals. For me, on the other hand, it’s going to be rather prosperous, so something involving animals should be especially lucky for me.I’m afraid we treated all this fairly lightheartedly, and poor Daphne became quite upset—she really seemed to believe that “something terrible” was going to happen to Griselda because of an animal. So Griselda had to promise to keep away from farms and zoos and wildlife parks, and be very careful of the bad-tempered Alsatian in the garden next door to the Vicarage.Well, if that’s the best the Book can do in the way of prophesying the future I don’t think anyone’s likely to go to the trouble of stealing it. I expect the police are right and the burglar was just a casual sneak thief, but the trouble is that Daphne doesn’t think so and is frightened that he’ll come back.We’re all hoping that when Isabella’s estate is dealt with and the Rectory can be sold Daphne will forget all this nonsense about the Book and get on with having a proper life in a sensible sort of way. The house alone must be worth between three and four hundred thousand, so she should be able to manage pretty comfortably on the income from the proceeds. Griselda and I have all sorts of plans for her—we’re going to transform her appearance and move her to a nice little flat in Brighton and enroll her in some not too demanding training course and make some nice friends for her of her own age. We haven’t quite got round to finding her a suitable husband yet, but I dare say we will.So her future, as you see, is in good hands, but none of it can actually happen until the solicitors have sorted out the estate. And lawyers, if you don’t mind my saying so, don’t seem to deal with things very quickly.Yours with much love,
 RegI wondered whether Daphne might not be right in thinking that the burglar had had some specific objective. She was the heiress to a professional blackmailer: could he have been in search of some item of incriminating evidence, perhaps a document of some kind, which he believed to be now in her possession? Might he be in some way connected with—might he even be—the man in the black Mercedes? Was this the possibility that was worrying Julia?"|"The Sibyl in Her Grave"|"Sarah Caudwell"
"ap > 06:00"|"after six o’clock"|"He wasn’t in the Newt and Ninepence this morning, as he usually is on a Saturday, but at first I didn’t even think of being worried about him.Griselda and I went and sat out in the garden, with our drinks and our crosswords, and grumbled a bit about not having anyone to tell us how to spell Sibylline. Or Sybilline, whichever it may be. Ricky turned up and bought another round of drinks, and we all just sat and talked about how hot it was, not worrying about Maurice or anything else.Then Daphne arrived looking for him, and very agitated that he wasn’t there. It wasn’t clear why she wanted him so urgently—it seemed to have something to do with a lobster that she’d bought him for his lunch. We told her he’d probably turn up sooner or later and in the meanwhile she’d better sit down and have a glass of wine with us. Which she did, and sat quite quietly, apart from a few sighs and sniffles, while we went on with the crossword.And then, completely out of the blue, there was a scene—ridiculous, but quite disagreeable—all on account of a clue in the Times crossword. Or perhaps the Guardian, I forget which.Ricky is one of those people who never start a crossword on their own but always want to help when someone’s halfway through. So we let him have the Times or the Guardian, whichever it was, and he was looking at the clues we hadn’t done and sometimes reading them out—you know how one does.In the course of this, he suddenly seemed to find something enormously amusing, and said, “Ah, here’s one for you, Daphne.” And he read out the clue for Sibylline, or Sybilline, whichever it is, which we only hadn’t filled in because we didn’t know how to spell it.I don’t know if you happened to see it? “Bein’ silly, very silly, like prophetic book.”Instant rage from Daphne. She jumped up, knocking her chair over and spilling her wine, and started shouting that the Book wasn’t silly, it was the crossword that was silly, and Ricky who was silly, and everyone in Parsons Haver who was silly. Apart from Maurice, who was a brilliant scholar and a true priest and could have been one of the great princes of the Church if he hadn’t buried himself in a silly little tinpot village where no one could appreciate him. (No need to ask where she got that idea from.) And it was typical of us that we could just sit there doing our silly crossword and not caring where he was or what had happened to him. All this with floods of tears.Ricky, having started it, simply walked out, saying he couldn’t stand any more, leaving Griselda and me to mop up Daphne. I’m really feeling quite cross with Ricky—he’s invited me to go to the races with him next week, but I’m feeling so cross that I’ve a good mind to say no.We bought her a couple of ham sandwiches and another glass of wine and tried to explain about crosswords, and eventually she stopped crying. She was sorry, she said, she hadn’t meant to be rude or upset anyone, it was just that she was so worried about Maurice. He’d told her he was going to be at home this morning, working on his sermon, and then come over to the Newt, but he hadn’t been at home when she rang on his doorbell and he wasn’t in the Newt, and she didn’t know what could have happened to him.We pointed out to her that he was a grown man in possession of all his faculties, and if he decided to go for a walk on a sunny Saturday morning he probably wouldn’t feel that he had to notify all his friends in advance. But it was no use—she kept saying she was sure that he was in some kind of danger—in a dangerous place, or with a dangerous person, and she didn’t know what to do.When we asked what made her think so, she said that she’d read it in the Book. She’d seen his name there and it had a shadow over it.Of course, I know really that it’s all complete nonsense. But it’s after six o’clock and he still isn’t back, and I can’t help feeling slightly anxious.There were several further pages of the letter. My perusal of them, however, was delayed: Cantrip arrived, carrying a pair of guns."|"The Sibyl in Her Grave"|"Sarah Caudwell"
"ap ~ 07:00"|"about seven"|"Thursday, 12th AugustHaving left this unfinished and unposted in my bureau for nearly a week, I’m in two minds now about posting it at all. You’ll probably say that I’m turning into a silly old woman, and I don’t like to think of you being so impertinent—you used to be such a nice child.Maurice came back, of course, perfectly safe and well, on Saturday evening. It was ridiculous to have thought of him as having disappeared—he’d simply been out for a drive.I mentioned, didn’t I, the young man called Derek Arkwright, who came to Isabella’s funeral by mistake and showed such an interest in our stained-glass windows? Maurice invited him then to come down again and be given a proper tour of St. Ethel’s and some of the other Sussex churches, and he said he’d love to—well, people have to say that, of course, and one doesn’t expect them to mean it. But on Saturday morning there he was on the doorstep of the Vicarage, saying that he’d driven down from London on the spur of the moment and wondered if Maurice might happen to be free.So they spent the day driving all over West Sussex, looking at stained-glass windows and Norman fonts and mediaeval misericords. They arrived back in Haver at about seven and stopped here so that Derek and I could be properly introduced—we’d hardly spoken at the funeral. Maurice was in such high spirits that at first I thought he was tipsy—but he wasn’t, he’d just been enjoying himself. They seemed to have eaten strawberries and cream in every café between here and Chichester, with Maurice telling all his favourite stories about Sussex saints who played jokes on the devil and pushed their mothers round the countryside in wheelbarrows.“And since Maurice is a man of the cloth,” said Derek, looking demure, “I had to believe every word.”He’s really a most attractive young man. Very nice to look at, very willowy—just your sort of thing, so it’s lucky you weren’t here. I don’t quite know what he does for a living. When I asked him, he said, “Oh, whatever I can get someone to pay me for, Mrs. Sheldon.”Maurice is clearly extremely taken with him and hoping he’ll come down again. He’s even shown him the Virgil frontispiece, which is an exceptional privilege on such a short acquaintance. It isn’t on display, you see—Maurice thinks some of his parishioners might find it slightly improper. So he keeps it in a drawer in the desk in his study and only shows it to people he’s sure will like it. For example, he’s never shown it to Daphne.And do you think Daphne admits that her premonition or whatever one calls it was entirely wrong? Not a bit of it. Derek has a dark and untrustworthy psychic aura, and she knew right away that he was a treacherous and horrible person—it’s dangerous for Maurice to spend any time with him, so she was absolutely right! She’s getting quite silly and tiresome about it—she told Maurice all about the dangerous aura and tried to make him promise not to see Derek if he came down here again. When he refused, she came round here wanting me to try to persuade him.I tried to explain to her that one simply can’t ask one’s friends for that sort of promise and she sat saying yes from time to time, as if I were making some kind of impression on her. After about half an hour of which, she said, “But I’m sure he’d promise if you asked him,” and I saw that I might as well have been talking Swahili—there are times when I could shake her.Julia was no longer writing but gazing out of the window, her expression thoughtful: I had the impression that her mind was no longer on the Finance Act."|"The Sibyl in Her Grave"|"Sarah Caudwell"

On Friday evening the Chairman took them all out to dinner to celebrate the successful completion of their task."|"The Sibyl in Her Grave"|"Sarah Caudwell"
"< 12:00"|"almost midday"|"That is to say, the kitchen, where I found my aunt doing interesting and complicated things to various kinds of pastry. Though rigorously forbidden to assist directly in these activities, I was entrusted with a plateful of hot mince pies to take into the drawing room, where Griselda and Mrs. Tyrrell were putting up the Christmas decorations, and told to make sure that they had enough wine to sustain them in their labours. I performed these tasks without misadventure, and lingered for a while to share the wine and mince pies and to exchange gossip.Having no hope of equalling Mrs. Tyrrell’s dexterity with silver paper and drawing pins, or her agility on a stepladder, I did not offer to help with putting up the decorations: decorations which I put up never seem to hang with much symmetry or elegance, or indeed for very long at all. I did suggest that I could stand beside the stepladder and catch her if she happened to fall; but Griselda claimed that responsibility as hers, and would not by any means relinquish it. (I should mention that Mrs. Tyrrell is rather attractive and has very prettily shaped legs.)When I mentioned having seen Maurice, they both expressed anxiety about him. They seemed to think that he has financial problems, and that it is these that are affecting his health. I found this a rather surprising idea; but apparently Daphne made some remark to Mrs. Tyrrell a few months ago about Maurice being very short of money and terribly worried about it. Then she realised she was being rather indiscreet, and asked Mrs. Tyrrell not to repeat it to anyone; but if it’s what’s making him ill, Mrs. Tyrrell feels it isn’t right to keep it a secret from his friends.I also told them, of course, about the appalling scene with Daphne, which I have already—or, no, I see that I haven’t yet told you about it, and shall therefore proceed to do so forthwith.By the time Maurice and I walked back from the George and Dragon, it was almost midday, and I was beginning to feel slightly hungry. Having told Reg that I would fend for myself as far as lunch was concerned, I decided that the time was ripe for a glass of wine and a toasted sandwich in the Newt and Ninepence. Maurice declined to join me, saying he must return to the Vicarage and deal with a number of things which he had neglected.Having browsed for a few minutes in the High Street bookshop, I was soon afterwards comfortably settled in the saloon bar of the Newt and Ninepence with all that a reasonable woman could require for absolute contentment—that is to say, a glass of wine, a toasted sandwich, and a detective story I had never read before. This happy state continued for about ten minutes, at the end of which I suddenly realized that a small, indignant-looking person was leaning over me and accusing me of being Reg’s niece, Julia.Resisting a natural impulse to denial, I admitted that I was. “And I think,” I said, “that you must be Daphne?”I recognised her without difficulty from the description my aunt had given, though the expression “not at all a pretty girl” was something of an understatement: she was one of the most unattractive girls I have ever met, and I felt it optimistic to hope that lipstick or mascara could make a significant difference. Nor did it seem to me that what she lacked was animation, precisely, though what she was chiefly animated by was rage towards myself.She stood with both hands planted firmly on my table, barring any possible escape route, and said that she wanted to talk to me.“I just want you to know,” she said, “that I’ve spent the whole morning looking for Maurice and not finding him and going simply frantic with worry about him. I rang and rang at his door and he didn’t answer, and then I went round the back and looked through all the windows and I still couldn’t see him, and I thought he must have been taken ill and be just lying there helpless. And he keeps forgetting to get a key made for me, so I couldn’t get in to find out. I was nearly out of my mind with worry. And now he says he was just out for a walk. With you.”“I’m sorry,” I said. “He didn’t say anything about having an appointment.”“It wasn’t an appointment, we don’t need stupid appointments, he knew I’d be coming, I go round every morning to put his rubbish out for him and see if he wants any shopping done before I give him his lunch. He said you walked to the George and Dragon—is that true?”“Yes,” I said.“To the George and Dragon?” she said again, with apparent incredulity.“Yes,” I said.“You walked? To the George and Dragon?”Her incredulity appeared to increase.“Yes,” I said.“To the George and Dragon? You walked?”“Yes,” I said again, wondering whether there was any limit to the number of times she could ask the question. “Do you have something against the George and Dragon? I’ve always thought it a rather agreeable place.”This answer seemed to enrage her further.“Don’t you know how far it is? Don’t you know we’re in the middle of winter? Don’t you know how old Maurice is?”“Well, not exactly,” I said, “but—”“Can’t you see he’s not a well person? Don’t you care at all what happens to him? Don’t you care if he gets pneumonia? No, I don’t suppose you do, it won’t be you who has to nurse him, you’re much too clever and successful for anything like that—I’ve heard all about how clever and successful you are. Well, don’t worry, I’ll nurse him, he’s a wonderful person and I’ll be proud and honoured to nurse him, I’ll stay with him day and night if he needs me. And you can just go on drinking wine and reading trashy paperbacks.”At this point she burst into tears and walked out of the pub, to the accompaniment of a certain amount of applause from several interested spectators, grateful for something to enliven what otherwise might have been an uneventful lunch hour. Shortly afterwards, finding myself now unable to give my detective story the attention it deserved, I also left, and returned to my aunt’s house.I feel that I must somehow have managed things extremely badly. It seems remarkably careless of me to have upset poor Daphne before even meeting her and at such an early stage in the season of peace and goodwill: we are bound to keep running into each other over the next ten days or so and not being on speaking terms is likely to prove a considerable embarrassment.And I suppose she was right about my being irresponsible to have persuaded Maurice to walk so far; having always known him as notably fit and active, I never considered the possibility that in his present state of health a two-mile walk might be more than was good for him. I do hope that it hasn’t really done him any harm.What worries me most, however, is what I said to him about insider dealing. Can it be, do you think, that he regards himself, having profited by Isabella’s predictions, as sharing in the guilt of the man in the black Mercedes? Does he believe that his subsequent misfortunes are a punishment for it? Is that why he wanted to know whether the crime was a serious one? If so, I have given him the worst possible answer.I know nothing of the complexities of the clerical conscience—is there anything I can do to repair the damage? Would it be possible to persuade him that insider dealing, having been a criminal offence only since 1980, cannot in fact be a sin? Or, if it is, venial rather than mortal? Or, if mortal, still not beyond redemption?In the hope of receiving your advice as soon as possible, I shall conclude and post this immediately. I am instructed by my aunt to add her Christmas greetings to my own. Please also give mine to Benjamin, and to the enchanting Terry.I remain, as always, my dear Ragwort,Your respectfully devoted

 Cannes20th DecemberDear Julia,Painful as it is to be obliged to say such a thing, particularly to a dear and valued friend, I can see nothing at all to censure in your behaviour, either towards the Reverend Maurice or towards the girl Daphne.Unless there is some very material omission in the account you have given me, you did not, when you called on the Vicar, take a pistol with you; or, if you did, you did not threaten to shoot him with it if he declined to accompany you to the hostelry of your choice. In short, his decision to do so was an exercise of what theologians call free will: the consequences are his responsibility, not yours. Moreover, it is not for you to advise him on whether insider dealing is a mortal or a venial sin: if he is troubled about the question, he should speak to his Bishop.So please stop worrying about the Reverend Maurice and give me your undivided attention—I have things to tell you which I think you will find of interest, relating, as it happens, to Selena’s merchant bankers.I have been here for two days and extremely busy, having promised Benjamin that I would arrive early and make sure everything was properly organised: it is several months since he was last here himself and, in spite of being a brilliant economist, he has no more idea of practical housekeeping than—well, than you have, if you will forgive my so expressing it. He seemed to have only a vague idea of how many people he had invited, when they were likely to get here and where they were all going to sleep: he said oh, that things would sort themselves out. Which things, in my experience, very seldom do without active encouragement from someone.Still, I have now got the flat in reasonable order and feel entitled to relax a little. I am at present sitting on the drawing-room balcony, which has an exceptionally fine view across the bay. Immediately below there is a small place, with shops which include a good bakery, a passable delicatessen, and a disgracefully overpriced greengrocer, as well as two pleasant cafés and a slightly disreputable bar.Beyond that, I can see the upper portion of a large and very grand-looking villa, built, I imagine, towards the end of the last century, in what would then have seemed an idyllically tranquil and private position. Its tranquillity must now be as sadly impaired by the noise of the traffic along the Corniche as its privacy has been by the subsequent building of residential blocks of flats, such as this one, on the hillside above.For example, I have from here a clear view of the whole of the extensive roof terrace. And sitting on the roof terrace, even as I write, is Sir Robert Renfrew—I recognised him at once, having seen him several times on his visits to Chambers for conferences with Selena. Though I knew, of course, when she described his villa to us, that it must be in the same general area as Benjamin’s flat, I had no idea that they were in such immediate proximity.Sir Robert, I suspect, does not fully realise how open the terrace is to observation and regards himself as enjoying there the same degree of privacy as if he were indoors. I first saw him two days ago, the morning after I arrived here, when I was having my coffee and croissant on the balcony and he was performing his exercises, dressed only in shorts and a vest—an activity, I think, which an elderly gentleman with a tendency to plumpness would normally wish to engage in, if at all, without an audience.He seems to spend a good deal of time on the terrace, not only doing exercises but also apparently working. He is from time to time attended on by three ladies, none, I am relieved to say, of scandalously youthful or seductive appearance: one in a black dress and apron, presumably the housekeeper, who brings him occasional refreshments; one in a well-tailored linen trouser suit, obviously Miss Tavistock, whom he summons by means of an old-fashioned handbell to take dictation; one of fairly advanced years and a somewhat equine countenance, no doubt his wife, who favours him with her company for the customary aperitif before dinner.Today, however, there has been an interruption in this tranquil mode of existence.The first sign of it was just after midday, when the post and the English newspapers arrive here. I had collected your letter and a copy of today’s Times from the concierge and settled down out here on the balcony to read them. Glancing at the terrace, I saw Sir Robert sitting peacefully in his chair and apparently similarly occupied. Your letter, I need hardly say, engaged my entire attention for several minutes, after which I again looked across at the terrace, just in time to observe a remarkable transformation in his demeanour. I thought at first that something in his newspaper or his correspondence had provoked him to a sudden rage, but decided after a few moments that his mood was one of excitement rather than anger.He had leapt up from his chair and was brandishing his handbell with such vigour that I almost expected to hear the sound of it all the way across the place. Miss Tavistock came running and seemed to receive instructions, of a brisk and urgent nature, after which she disappeared again. Sir Robert did a few exercises, as if suddenly needing to work off surplus energy, and then also left the terrace.I too went indoors, with the intention of making myself lunch—a task more difficult than I had envisaged. All the cooking appliances in the flat depend for their operation on a supply of gas, not from the mains but from a replaceable cylinder: I was halfway through cooking myself what might have been a rather delicious omelette with fines herbes when I discovered that the cylinder was empty, and must indeed have been nearly so when I arrived.There was a note pinned up on the wall beside the stove giving directions on where to find the replacement cylinder: having followed them, I discovered that there was no replacement cylinder. I reminded myself with some effort that Benjamin was my friend and host and it would be unseemly to think unkind thoughts of him.He had advised me, if I should have any unexpected problems, to seek the assistance of his next-door neighbour—a physiotherapist of some sort, who studied art in her spare time and painted quite interesting watercolours. She was, he said, a very helpful and competent sort of person, and he was on friendly terms with her. Feeling that the difficulty with the gas cylinder was one of the unexpected problems which Benjamin had been expecting me to encounter, I went out and rang on her doorbell.The appearance of the young woman who answered was something of a surprise to me. For some reason I had pictured Mademoiselle Natasha as middle-aged and rather plain, wearing a sensible suit and perhaps a crisp white overall. In fact she was in her twenties and strikingly handsome, tall, dark eyed, black haired, with a splendidly aquiline profile—the product, one would guess, of a series of exotic alliances between different races and nationalities. She was dressed—well, her clothing is difficult to describe: it consisted largely of items of cream-coloured leather, including a pair of knee-high boots, which somehow left a number of areas uncovered—not at all the sort of garment which one associates with the medical profession.But when I asked her, rather apprehensively, whether she was Mademoiselle Natasha, she confirmed that she was, albeit in a tone which somewhat suggested that her name was none of my business. On hearing, however, that I was a friend and guest of Benjamin’s, she became quite cordial and proved extremely helpful in the matter of the cylinders. She was about to drive into town for lunch and intended to pass the garage from which replacements were obtained: she said that she would purchase two on my behalf and bring them back after lunch.The least I could do was make sure of being at hand to unload them. I therefore decided to take lunch in the nearest café, which is only a few yards away from the entrance to our block of flats. Having consoled myself for my ruined omelette with a croque-monsieur and a chocolate ice cream, I remained there, reading my guidebook and glancing frequently out of the window to be sure of seeing her as soon as she returned.And that was how I happened to see Miss Tavistock, driving through the place—a Bentley, as it happens, not a Mercedes—in the direction of Nice; she was alone in the car.Natasha not only remembered to buy the cylinders but helped me to carry them up to the flat and to install one of them in its proper place beside the stove. After this, naturally, I offered her a drink, which she accepted, and we came and sat out here on the balcony.Her English, like my French, is serviceable rather than fluent; but between the two we managed to have quite a pleasant and interesting conversation, mostly about painting. I did try asking her about her work as a physiotherapist—she tells me that she specialises in pains of the lower back; but she seemed to be far more interested in her artistic studies—she has promised to show me some of her watercolours. Her work has occasionally been exhibited in one of the small art galleries in the neighbourhood and sold sufficiently well to give her hopes of someday making her living by it.As she was telling me this, she suddenly pointed towards the place and said, “Oh, there is one of my patrons. Madame Tavistock—she has bought several of my things. She is English, but very intelligent, very artistic—you should meet her, Desmond. Poor Madame Tavistock—she works for a bank and meets only imbeciles who talk about money and motorcars.”I looked in the direction she was pointing and saw the Bentley on its way back towards the villa. Miss Tavistock was still at the wheel, but no longer alone—she had two passengers. Her journey had taken about the time one would expect if she had been collecting someone from Nice airport: although I was too far away to see them clearly, I somehow at once felt sure that I knew who they were.Natasha left soon afterwards, saying unenthusiastically that she had a patient arriving for treatment: “Another imbecile, but one must live.”Her treatments are evidently on the vigorous side—she said that her patients sometimes became rather noisy, and she hoped I would not be disturbed.Having become rather curious about what was going on at the villa, and hoping to confirm my speculation as to the identity of the two passengers, I remained on the balcony.Just as I was beginning to write this letter, Sir Robert reappeared on the roof terrace, where he was joined soon afterwards by his wife and Miss Tavistock. And then, a few minutes ago, the party was further augmented by two men in City suits, as if they had come straight from their offices, who I have no doubt at all are Edgar Albany and Geoffrey Bolton. It’s true I’ve only seen them once before, when Sir Robert brought them to see Selena in Chambers, but I’m quite sure I’m not mistaken.I’m equally sure that their visit was not planned in advance—that they were summoned here by Sir Robert only a few hours ago, as a result of something he received in the post or read in the newspaper this morning. I suppose there may have been something in the financial pages which would provide a reason to convene an urgent directors’ meeting. But is it the real reason or merely a pretext? I strongly suspect, given the similarity of the conditions, that he is trying again to set a trap for the insider dealer, in the same way that he did when Selena was here in the summer. I can’t help feeling that this may be rather dangerous—another attack of food poisoning might have serious consequences.Well, I shall keep as close an eye on the situation as circumstances permit. I have already, I’m afraid, spent more time on observing what is happening at the villa than is entirely consistent with my other obligations: Terry has rung to say that he is arriving this evening, and I haven’t the faintest idea what to give him for supper—we shall probably have to go out somewhere. If he complains, I shall talk meaningfully of pots, kettles, and unfinished bookcases.21st DecemberDo please forgive me if the rest of this letter is somewhat disjointed: there are some rather strange noises coming from the flat next door—if Natasha had not warned me, I should think them very strange indeed—which make it slightly difficult to concentrate.Although it is after ten A.M., I have only just finished breakfast, having risen disgracefully late and with a slight hangover. For this I entirely blame Terry, of whose disgraceful behaviour I am about to give full particulars: really, I don’t know what carpenters are coming to nowadays.He arrived yesterday evening at about seven and readily agreed to go out to dinner rather than eat at the flat. What I had envisaged was a modest meal at one of the cafés in the place; but he persuaded me that we should go instead to a Moroccan restaurant, known to him from previous visits.It was in a narrow side street a few minutes’ walk away, behind the sort of unassuming frontage which in France so often conceals a restaurant of some distinction. Inside, it was quite luxuriously furnished and decorated, in a quasi-Moorish style: thick carpets and silky draperies; divans round low circular tables in alcoves divided by carved wooden screens; brass lamps of the kind one might rub if one hoped to be given three wishes. At the end of the room, a piano and a small dais suggested that later in the evening some form of musical entertainment might be provided.Rather to my alarm, the waiters all greeted Terry like a long-lost brother or nephew: the thing most likely to inspire such fond and enduring memories seemed to me to be a habit of reckless overtipping, which I feared I would be expected to emulate.It also occurred to me that this might well be the same restaurant in which Sir Robert was taken ill in the summer. I decided not to risk the moules marinières.I refrained throughout the meal from any mention of bookcases. Terry was in an odd sort of mood, one moment excessively animated, the next despondent, so that I was reluctant to say anything which might depress his spirits. Besides, on the first evening of his holiday, I felt it would be unkind to reproach him. On the other hand, I thought it no more than polite to enquire about his plans for the refurbishment of Benjamin’s flat.“Oh,” he said vaguely, “I’m thinking fin de siècle. Aubrey Beardsley and winters in Egypt and so on—you know the kind of thing.”But I was dismayed to observe that he spoke listlessly, with none of the enthusiasm which he used to show for such matters. I began to wonder if there were such a thing as carpenters’ block, like writers’ block, causing carpenters to be incapable of getting on with any work, and, if so, how long it might last.So preoccupied was I with this question that I almost failed to notice the entry into the restaurant of the very people in whom I was so deeply interested—that is to say, Sir Robert Renfrew and his two codirectors, accompanied, of course, by Miss Tavistock.For some reason—perhaps Lady Renfrew had objected to spending an evening hearing them talk business—they had evidently decided, like ourselves, to eat out. It was clear that Sir Robert was a known and valued customer: the headwaiter greeted him by name and deferentially conducted him with his guests to the table in the alcove next to ours.I now felt no doubt at all that this was indeed the restaurant where he had suffered his attack of food poisoning last summer. It seemed likely, however, from the fact of his returning there, that he did not hold the restaurant to blame for it—presumably he is well aware that on that occasion he had not actually eaten anything. I even began to wonder, indeed, whether he himself suspected that one of his codirectors had had some hand in the business and was staging one of those reenactments of the crime which I believe are popular in detective fiction. I thought that if so he was being extremely foolhardy.The new arrivals took no particular notice of Terry and myself. There was no reason why they should—apart from Sir Robert’s unfortunate collision with Terry a few months ago, which we all hope he has entirely forgotten, none of them had met either of us before. And since Terry was gossiping away with one of the waiters in fluent though ungrammatical French, they probably did not even realise that we were English.In these circumstances I found that I was able—as of course you know, I would not dream of deliberate eavesdropping, but these carved screens do give an illusion of privacy and they were making no effort to lower their voices—that I was unable to avoid hearing a substantial part of their conversation. Moreover, when we had finished our main course Terry went off to the kitchen to say hello to the chef, who he said was an old friend of his, leaving me with nothing to distract me from it.I gathered that Sir Robert had suddenly decided that morning that the time was ripe to proceed with a major acquisition which the Bank had for some time been considering on behalf of a client; he had summoned his fellow directors to Cannes with a view to taking action before the Christmas holiday. If I had known which company they were talking about, I might have managed to persuade myself that there would be nothing improper in having a modest flutter on it: but they all discreetly referred to it as “the target company,” rather than by name. Indeed, it appeared that before their arrival here neither Albany nor Bolton had known which company was to be the subject of discussion.“If you don’t mind my saying so, Chairman,” said Albany, sounding decidedly peevish, “it’s a pity you didn’t feel able to tell us before we left London which target you had in mind. We’d have found it helpful to check what we had on file about it—at least, I know I would.”“Ah well,” said Bolton, in his pronounced Lancashire accent, “I dare say we’ve looked at this one often enough to know pretty well what’s what.”“It’s a question of security,” said Sir Robert. “Once you start mentioning names on the telephone, you might as well make a public broadcast and have done with it.”Still, it must have been a little disconcerting for them, like being at school and having an unexpected exam—particularly for Albany, who evidently remembered almost nothing about the company under discussion. His rival, on the other hand, despite the lack of preparation, seemed to have all the relevant details at his fingertips.Becoming, as a result of this, increasingly illhumoured, Albany rather forgot himself. He began making remarks to Bolton which were close to being openly offensive, most inadequately disguised as the kind of jovial banter acceptable between friends and colleagues. For example, after Bolton had asked some question about the meaning of something on the menu: “I say, Bolton, old chap, don’t you find it a bit of a bore not knowing any French? Why don’t you go on one of those courses?“Nowt wrong with plain, old-fashioned English, in my opinion. It were good enough for old Bill Shakespeare, weren’t it? And he were a great writer—or so they tell me.”“So most educated people seem to think. But I suppose they didn’t go in for literature much at that college of yours at—where was it? Sorry, I always forget—Birmingham, was it?”“It were Worcester—bit southwest of Birmingham. Oh aye, there were a few lads there that studied poetry and such, but I wanted summat that would help me make a bit of brass.”Even without the possibility of anyone being poisoned, I could hardly imagine, in such an atmosphere, that any of them was having a very agreeable evening. It must have been rather a relief to them when the lights, already low, were dimmed still further, the pianist took his place at the piano and the patron stepped forward to tell us that we were to have the inestimable privilege of hearing la belle Zingara, who had just returned to Cannes after her acclaimed tour of European capitals.Whether Madame Zingara had any just claim to be described as beautiful it was impossible to tell: one had an impression merely of a tall, slim woman with a mass of dark hair and wearing more than enough makeup to conceal any defects of complexion. She was swathed in some kind of white, gauzy material, draped round her in the manner of a sari or toga. Inasmuch as it completely covered her from neck to ankle, one might have considered it a rather decorous garment; but the undulating movement of her hips and shoulders somehow made it look as if it were continuously in the process of slithering to the ground, so that the actual effect was rather the reverse.When she began to sing, however, her voice was unexpectedly attractive: a husky contralto with a touch of harshness, not of course in the class of Lenya or Mercouri but more than acceptable for delivering the same songs. So we had “Surabaya Johnny” and “Banal” and several others of that sort, mainly on the theme of overtrusting women deserted by heartless lovers. These were interspersed with songs of a rather different type, all unfamiliar to me and in the highest degree improper: from what I understood of them, which was rather less than half, I was extremely glad of my inability to understand the rest. The audience, however, seemed to find them amusing: they were greeted with much laughter and enthusiastic applause.I felt a certain uneasiness, while all this was going on, about those in the adjoining alcove. The conditions were rather worryingly suitable, if one really believed Albany or Bolton to be capable of such a thing, for putting something unwholesome in someone’s coffee cup. Still, there was nothing I could do about it. So far as I could tell, nothing untoward occurred save for Bolton suffering a fit of coughing and Albany, with manifestly insincere solicitude, thumping him on the back.Madame Zingara concluded her performance with “Pirate Jenny” from The Threepenny Opera. She moved round the restaurant as she sang it, hips and shoulders still undulating, white muslin still apparently precarious, pausing at each table to hold out a large copper bowl. Having not quite expected this, I wondered anxiously what sort of sum it would be proper to contribute.By chance, or so I imagined, my table was the last in her circuit, so that I had ample time to reflect on this question and to curse Terry for staying gossiping in the kitchen—I assumed that as an habitué he would have known how much was expected.I finally settled on fifty francs as an amount which could be neither insultingly small nor ludicrously generous and by the time she reached my table had a note of that value ready to place in the copper bowl. She waved it away, however, saying, “Ah, on ne prend pas de l’argent d’un joli garçon comme vous.”I looked at her in surprise and considerable embarrassment. She smiled and fluttered her long, mascaraed eyelashes. Under the heavy makeup I now recognised the features of our truant carpenter.I was speechless. Fortunately, because anything I said would have been profane; it would also have been in English and audible at the next table.“Mais comment ça arrive que vous trouvez tout seul?” the shameless creature continued.I collected myself sufficiently to reply in the same language that I was with a friend: and that if he did not shortly rejoin me I should be extremely cross.By the time he returned to our table, dressed in the rather more conventional garments he had arrived in, Sir Robert’s party had left, apparently without mishap.My intention had been, once we were back at the flat, to speak to him severely about his disgraceful conduct and then to retire early to bed. Somehow or other, this was not at all what happened. I had scarcely begun my lecture when he said, “Don’t scold me, Desmond, I only did it to cheer myself up a bit. I’m feeling so miserable,” and I could not bring myself to go on.He has a broken heart, poor boy, having formed a deep attachment which he believed reciprocal and found was not. “Cast aside,” he said, “like the proverbial soiled glove. Too banal for words, isn’t it?”We sat up until nearly three in the morning, drinking Benjamin’s brandy and playing Marlene Dietrich songs while I tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade him that from time to time in human history the same thing has happened to other people and they have sometimes managed to get over it. I even suggested the possibility of a reconciliation with the object of his attachment; but I was given to understand that things had been said which made this out of the question. If the object were to walk barefoot across France to beg for Terry’s forgiveness and present him with a train of forty snow-white camels, laden with gold and diamonds and boxes of marrons glacés, such forgiveness would not now be forthcoming. I am not feeling optimistic about our bookcases.The noises from the flat next door are becoming quite alarming—I can hardly imagine an ailment worth such an agonising cure as Natasha seems to provide.So far I have not seen anyone on the roof terrace this morning, nor much expected to, having gathered last night that the morning’s work at the villa would consist mainly of Geoffrey Bolton making telephone calls. There has been, however, a certain amount of interesting activity in the place.Shortly before ten o’clock, just as I was beginning my breakfast, Edgar Albany came into the place and walked across in the direction of the slightly disreputable bar I mentioned. Unfortunately, the bar itself is out of view from here, being on the same side of the place as this building: I am thus unable to tell you for certain whether he actually went into it and if so whether he stayed there.My guess, though, is that he did, because almost immediately afterwards Miss Tavistock also came into the place and sat down in the café on the opposite side, from which she would certainly be able to see all the comings and goings through the door of the slightly disreputable bar.Miss Tavistock does not strike me as the sort of woman who would normally fritter her time away in a café on a morning when there is work to be done. I am now as certain as can be that Sir Robert is repeating the experiment he tried when Selena was here: Miss Tavistock is acting on instructions to keep Albany under surveillance while he is outside the villa.But if I am right about that, I also think that he has somehow eluded her—perhaps inadvertently, with no idea that she was keeping watch on him. A few minutes ago, after she had been in the café for about half an hour, she made a telephone call. After that she paid her bill and left, presumably to return to the villa. I think that Albany must have come out of the bar and done something, such as hailing a taxi, which prevented her from following. The telephone call would have been to Sir Robert to report and ask further instructions.I am becoming quite seriously concerned about what is happening next door. I have just seen Natasha driving away in her car, and yet the cries of pain continue unabated—indeed, they almost sound like cries for help. I do not wish to do anything to offend her after she has been so kind, but it does seem irresponsible of her to have left her patient on his own in such a condition as he appears to be in.I have decided to run down to the postbox, so that this catches the eleven o’clock post and has some chance of reaching you before Christmas Day, and on my way back to knock discreetly at her door. If there is no answer and the cries are still continuing, I shall climb across onto her balcony, which adjoins this one, and find out what is going on.In haste, therefore, and hoping that you and your aunt both have a splendid Christmas and an excellent New Year,Yours,

I reminded myself with some effort that Benjamin was my friend and host and it would be unseemly to think unkind thoughts of him.He had advised me, if I should have any unexpected problems, to seek the assistance of his next-door neighbour—a physiotherapist of some sort, who studied art in her spare time and painted quite interesting watercolours. She was, he said, a very helpful and competent sort of person, and he was on friendly terms with her. Feeling that the difficulty with the gas cylinder was one of the unexpected problems which Benjamin had been expecting me to encounter, I went out and rang on her doorbell.The appearance of the young woman who answered was something of a surprise to me. For some reason I had pictured Mademoiselle Natasha as middle-aged and rather plain, wearing a sensible suit and perhaps a crisp white overall. In fact she was in her twenties and strikingly handsome, tall, dark eyed, black haired, with a splendidly aquiline profile—the product, one would guess, of a series of exotic alliances between different races and nationalities. She was dressed—well, her clothing is difficult to describe: it consisted largely of items of cream-coloured leather, including a pair of knee-high boots, which somehow left a number of areas uncovered—not at all the sort of garment which one associates with the medical profession.But when I asked her, rather apprehensively, whether she was Mademoiselle Natasha, she confirmed that she was, albeit in a tone which somewhat suggested that her name was none of my business. On hearing, however, that I was a friend and guest of Benjamin’s, she became quite cordial and proved extremely helpful in the matter of the cylinders. She was about to drive into town for lunch and intended to pass the garage from which replacements were obtained: she said that she would purchase two on my behalf and bring them back after lunch.The least I could do was make sure of being at hand to unload them. I therefore decided to take lunch in the nearest café, which is only a few yards away from the entrance to our block of flats. Having consoled myself for my ruined omelette with a croque-monsieur and a chocolate ice cream, I remained there, reading my guidebook and glancing frequently out of the window to be sure of seeing her as soon as she returned.And that was how I happened to see Miss Tavistock, driving through the place—a Bentley, as it happens, not a Mercedes—in the direction of Nice; she was alone in the car.Natasha not only remembered to buy the cylinders but helped me to carry them up to the flat and to install one of them in its proper place beside the stove. After this, naturally, I offered her a drink, which she accepted, and we came and sat out here on the balcony.Her English, like my French, is serviceable rather than fluent; but between the two we managed to have quite a pleasant and interesting conversation, mostly about painting. I did try asking her about her work as a physiotherapist—she tells me that she specialises in pains of the lower back; but she seemed to be far more interested in her artistic studies—she has promised to show me some of her watercolours. Her work has occasionally been exhibited in one of the small art galleries in the neighbourhood and sold sufficiently well to give her hopes of someday making her living by it.As she was telling me this, she suddenly pointed towards the place and said, “Oh, there is one of my patrons. Madame Tavistock—she has bought several of my things. She is English, but very intelligent, very artistic—you should meet her, Desmond. Poor Madame Tavistock—she works for a bank and meets only imbeciles who talk about money and motorcars.”I looked in the direction she was pointing and saw the Bentley on its way back towards the villa. Miss Tavistock was still at the wheel, but no longer alone—she had two passengers. Her journey had taken about the time one would expect if she had been collecting someone from Nice airport: although I was too far away to see them clearly, I somehow at once felt sure that I knew who they were.Natasha left soon afterwards, saying unenthusiastically that she had a patient arriving for treatment: “Another imbecile, but one must live.”Her treatments are evidently on the vigorous side—she said that her patients sometimes became rather noisy, and she hoped I would not be disturbed.Having become rather curious about what was going on at the villa, and hoping to confirm my speculation as to the identity of the two passengers, I remained on the balcony.Just as I was beginning to write this letter, Sir Robert reappeared on the roof terrace, where he was joined soon afterwards by his wife and Miss Tavistock. And then, a few minutes ago, the party was further augmented by two men in City suits, as if they had come straight from their offices, who I have no doubt at all are Edgar Albany and Geoffrey Bolton. It’s true I’ve only seen them once before, when Sir Robert brought them to see Selena in Chambers, but I’m quite sure I’m not mistaken.I’m equally sure that their visit was not planned in advance—that they were summoned here by Sir Robert only a few hours ago, as a result of something he received in the post or read in the newspaper this morning. I suppose there may have been something in the financial pages which would provide a reason to convene an urgent directors’ meeting. But is it the real reason or merely a pretext? I strongly suspect, given the similarity of the conditions, that he is trying again to set a trap for the insider dealer, in the same way that he did when Selena was here in the summer. I can’t help feeling that this may be rather dangerous—another attack of food poisoning might have serious consequences.Well, I shall keep as close an eye on the situation as circumstances permit. I have already, I’m afraid, spent more time on observing what is happening at the villa than is entirely consistent with my other obligations: Terry has rung to say that he is arriving this evening, and I haven’t the faintest idea what to give him for supper—we shall probably have to go out somewhere. If he complains, I shall talk meaningfully of pots, kettles, and unfinished bookcases.21st DecemberDo please forgive me if the rest of this letter is somewhat disjointed: there are some rather strange noises coming from the flat next door—if Natasha had not warned me, I should think them very strange indeed—which make it slightly difficult to concentrate.Although it is after ten A.M., I have only just finished breakfast, having risen disgracefully late and with a slight hangover. For this I entirely blame Terry, of whose disgraceful behaviour I am about to give full particulars: really, I don’t know what carpenters are coming to nowadays.He arrived yesterday evening at about seven and readily agreed to go out to dinner rather than eat at the flat. What I had envisaged was a modest meal at one of the cafés in the place; but he persuaded me that we should go instead to a Moroccan restaurant, known to him from previous visits.It was in a narrow side street a few minutes’ walk away, behind the sort of unassuming frontage which in France so often conceals a restaurant of some distinction. Inside, it was quite luxuriously furnished and decorated, in a quasi-Moorish style: thick carpets and silky draperies; divans round low circular tables in alcoves divided by carved wooden screens; brass lamps of the kind one might rub if one hoped to be given three wishes. At the end of the room, a piano and a small dais suggested that later in the evening some form of musical entertainment might be provided.Rather to my alarm, the waiters all greeted Terry like a long-lost brother or nephew: the thing most likely to inspire such fond and enduring memories seemed to me to be a habit of reckless overtipping, which I feared I would be expected to emulate.It also occurred to me that this might well be the same restaurant in which Sir Robert was taken ill in the summer. I decided not to risk the moules marinières.I refrained throughout the meal from any mention of bookcases. Terry was in an odd sort of mood, one moment excessively animated, the next despondent, so that I was reluctant to say anything which might depress his spirits. Besides, on the first evening of his holiday, I felt it would be unkind to reproach him. On the other hand, I thought it no more than polite to enquire about his plans for the refurbishment of Benjamin’s flat.“Oh,” he said vaguely, “I’m thinking fin de siècle. Aubrey Beardsley and winters in Egypt and so on—you know the kind of thing.”But I was dismayed to observe that he spoke listlessly, with none of the enthusiasm which he used to show for such matters. I began to wonder if there were such a thing as carpenters’ block, like writers’ block, causing carpenters to be incapable of getting on with any work, and, if so, how long it might last.So preoccupied was I with this question that I almost failed to notice the entry into the restaurant of the very people in whom I was so deeply interested—that is to say, Sir Robert Renfrew and his two codirectors, accompanied, of course, by Miss Tavistock.For some reason—perhaps Lady Renfrew had objected to spending an evening hearing them talk business—they had evidently decided, like ourselves, to eat out. It was clear that Sir Robert was a known and valued customer: the headwaiter greeted him by name and deferentially conducted him with his guests to the table in the alcove next to ours.I now felt no doubt at all that this was indeed the restaurant where he had suffered his attack of food poisoning last summer. It seemed likely, however, from the fact of his returning there, that he did not hold the restaurant to blame for it—presumably he is well aware that on that occasion he had not actually eaten anything. I even began to wonder, indeed, whether he himself suspected that one of his codirectors had had some hand in the business and was staging one of those reenactments of the crime which I believe are popular in detective fiction. I thought that if so he was being extremely foolhardy.The new arrivals took no particular notice of Terry and myself. There was no reason why they should—apart from Sir Robert’s unfortunate collision with Terry a few months ago, which we all hope he has entirely forgotten, none of them had met either of us before. And since Terry was gossiping away with one of the waiters in fluent though ungrammatical French, they probably did not even realise that we were English.In these circumstances I found that I was able—as of course you know, I would not dream of deliberate eavesdropping, but these carved screens do give an illusion of privacy and they were making no effort to lower their voices—that I was unable to avoid hearing a substantial part of their conversation. Moreover, when we had finished our main course Terry went off to the kitchen to say hello to the chef, who he said was an old friend of his, leaving me with nothing to distract me from it.I gathered that Sir Robert had suddenly decided that morning that the time was ripe to proceed with a major acquisition which the Bank had for some time been considering on behalf of a client; he had summoned his fellow directors to Cannes with a view to taking action before the Christmas holiday. If I had known which company they were talking about, I might have managed to persuade myself that there would be nothing improper in having a modest flutter on it: but they all discreetly referred to it as “the target company,” rather than by name. Indeed, it appeared that before their arrival here neither Albany nor Bolton had known which company was to be the subject of discussion.“If you don’t mind my saying so, Chairman,” said Albany, sounding decidedly peevish, “it’s a pity you didn’t feel able to tell us before we left London which target you had in mind. We’d have found it helpful to check what we had on file about it—at least, I know I would.”“Ah well,” said Bolton, in his pronounced Lancashire accent, “I dare say we’ve looked at this one often enough to know pretty well what’s what.”“It’s a question of security,” said Sir Robert. “Once you start mentioning names on the telephone, you might as well make a public broadcast and have done with it.”Still, it must have been a little disconcerting for them, like being at school and having an unexpected exam—particularly for Albany, who evidently remembered almost nothing about the company under discussion. His rival, on the other hand, despite the lack of preparation, seemed to have all the relevant details at his fingertips.Becoming, as a result of this, increasingly illhumoured, Albany rather forgot himself. He began making remarks to Bolton which were close to being openly offensive, most inadequately disguised as the kind of jovial banter acceptable between friends and colleagues. For example, after Bolton had asked some question about the meaning of something on the menu: “I say, Bolton, old chap, don’t you find it a bit of a bore not knowing any French? Why don’t you go on one of those courses?“Nowt wrong with plain, old-fashioned English, in my opinion. It were good enough for old Bill Shakespeare, weren’t it? And he were a great writer—or so they tell me.”“So most educated people seem to think. But I suppose they didn’t go in for literature much at that college of yours at—where was it? Sorry, I always forget—Birmingham, was it?”“It were Worcester—bit southwest of Birmingham. Oh aye, there were a few lads there that studied poetry and such, but I wanted summat that would help me make a bit of brass.”Even without the possibility of anyone being poisoned, I could hardly imagine, in such an atmosphere, that any of them was having a very agreeable evening. It must have been rather a relief to them when the lights, already low, were dimmed still further, the pianist took his place at the piano and the patron stepped forward to tell us that we were to have the inestimable privilege of hearing la belle Zingara, who had just returned to Cannes after her acclaimed tour of European capitals.Whether Madame Zingara had any just claim to be described as beautiful it was impossible to tell: one had an impression merely of a tall, slim woman with a mass of dark hair and wearing more than enough makeup to conceal any defects of complexion. She was swathed in some kind of white, gauzy material, draped round her in the manner of a sari or toga. Inasmuch as it completely covered her from neck to ankle, one might have considered it a rather decorous garment; but the undulating movement of her hips and shoulders somehow made it look as if it were continuously in the process of slithering to the ground, so that the actual effect was rather the reverse.When she began to sing, however, her voice was unexpectedly attractive: a husky contralto with a touch of harshness, not of course in the class of Lenya or Mercouri but more than acceptable for delivering the same songs. So we had “Surabaya Johnny” and “Banal” and several others of that sort, mainly on the theme of overtrusting women deserted by heartless lovers. These were interspersed with songs of a rather different type, all unfamiliar to me and in the highest degree improper: from what I understood of them, which was rather less than half, I was extremely glad of my inability to understand the rest. The audience, however, seemed to find them amusing: they were greeted with much laughter and enthusiastic applause.I felt a certain uneasiness, while all this was going on, about those in the adjoining alcove. The conditions were rather worryingly suitable, if one really believed Albany or Bolton to be capable of such a thing, for putting something unwholesome in someone’s coffee cup. Still, there was nothing I could do about it. So far as I could tell, nothing untoward occurred save for Bolton suffering a fit of coughing and Albany, with manifestly insincere solicitude, thumping him on the back.Madame Zingara concluded her performance with “Pirate Jenny” from The Threepenny Opera. She moved round the restaurant as she sang it, hips and shoulders still undulating, white muslin still apparently precarious, pausing at each table to hold out a large copper bowl. Having not quite expected this, I wondered anxiously what sort of sum it would be proper to contribute.By chance, or so I imagined, my table was the last in her circuit, so that I had ample time to reflect on this question and to curse Terry for staying gossiping in the kitchen—I assumed that as an habitué he would have known how much was expected.I finally settled on fifty francs as an amount which could be neither insultingly small nor ludicrously generous and by the time she reached my table had a note of that value ready to place in the copper bowl. She waved it away, however, saying, “Ah, on ne prend pas de l’argent d’un joli garçon comme vous.”I looked at her in surprise and considerable embarrassment. She smiled and fluttered her long, mascaraed eyelashes. Under the heavy makeup I now recognised the features of our truant carpenter.I was speechless. Fortunately, because anything I said would have been profane; it would also have been in English and audible at the next table.“Mais comment ça arrive que vous trouvez tout seul?” the shameless creature continued.I collected myself sufficiently to reply in the same language that I was with a friend: and that if he did not shortly rejoin me I should be extremely cross.By the time he returned to our table, dressed in the rather more conventional garments he had arrived in, Sir Robert’s party had left, apparently without mishap.My intention had been, once we were back at the flat, to speak to him severely about his disgraceful conduct and then to retire early to bed. Somehow or other, this was not at all what happened. I had scarcely begun my lecture when he said, “Don’t scold me, Desmond, I only did it to cheer myself up a bit. I’m feeling so miserable,” and I could not bring myself to go on.He has a broken heart, poor boy, having formed a deep attachment which he believed reciprocal and found was not. “Cast aside,” he said, “like the proverbial soiled glove. Too banal for words, isn’t it?”We sat up until nearly three in the morning, drinking Benjamin’s brandy and playing Marlene Dietrich songs while I tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade him that from time to time in human history the same thing has happened to other people and they have sometimes managed to get over it. I even suggested the possibility of a reconciliation with the object of his attachment; but I was given to understand that things had been said which made this out of the question. If the object were to walk barefoot across France to beg for Terry’s forgiveness and present him with a train of forty snow-white camels, laden with gold and diamonds and boxes of marrons glacés, such forgiveness would not now be forthcoming. I am not feeling optimistic about our bookcases.The noises from the flat next door are becoming quite alarming—I can hardly imagine an ailment worth such an agonising cure as Natasha seems to provide.So far I have not seen anyone on the roof terrace this morning, nor much expected to, having gathered last night that the morning’s work at the villa would consist mainly of Geoffrey Bolton making telephone calls. There has been, however, a certain amount of interesting activity in the place.Shortly before ten o’clock, just as I was beginning my breakfast, Edgar Albany came into the place and walked across in the direction of the slightly disreputable bar I mentioned. Unfortunately, the bar itself is out of view from here, being on the same side of the place as this building: I am thus unable to tell you for certain whether he actually went into it and if so whether he stayed there.My guess, though, is that he did, because almost immediately afterwards Miss Tavistock also came into the place and sat down in the café on the opposite side, from which she would certainly be able to see all the comings and goings through the door of the slightly disreputable bar.Miss Tavistock does not strike me as the sort of woman who would normally fritter her time away in a café on a morning when there is work to be done. I am now as certain as can be that Sir Robert is repeating the experiment he tried when Selena was here: Miss Tavistock is acting on instructions to keep Albany under surveillance while he is outside the villa.But if I am right about that, I also think that he has somehow eluded her—perhaps inadvertently, with no idea that she was keeping watch on him. A few minutes ago, after she had been in the café for about half an hour, she made a telephone call. After that she paid her bill and left, presumably to return to the villa. I think that Albany must have come out of the bar and done something, such as hailing a taxi, which prevented her from following. The telephone call would have been to Sir Robert to report and ask further instructions.I am becoming quite seriously concerned about what is happening next door. I have just seen Natasha driving away in her car, and yet the cries of pain continue unabated—indeed, they almost sound like cries for help. I do not wish to do anything to offend her after she has been so kind, but it does seem irresponsible of her to have left her patient on his own in such a condition as he appears to be in.I have decided to run down to the postbox, so that this catches the eleven o’clock post and has some chance of reaching you before Christmas Day, and on my way back to knock discreetly at her door. If there is no answer and the cries are still continuing, I shall climb across onto her balcony, which adjoins this one, and find out what is going on.In haste, therefore, and hoping that you and your aunt both have a splendid Christmas and an excellent New Year,Yours,

 Cannes20th DecemberDear Julia,Painful as it is to be obliged to say such a thing, particularly to a dear and valued friend, I can see nothing at all to censure in your behaviour, either towards the Reverend Maurice or towards the girl Daphne.Unless there is some very material omission in the account you have given me, you did not, when you called on the Vicar, take a pistol with you; or, if you did, you did not threaten to shoot him with it if he declined to accompany you to the hostelry of your choice. In short, his decision to do so was an exercise of what theologians call free will: the consequences are his responsibility, not yours. Moreover, it is not for you to advise him on whether insider dealing is a mortal or a venial sin: if he is troubled about the question, he should speak to his Bishop.So please stop worrying about the Reverend Maurice and give me your undivided attention—I have things to tell you which I think you will find of interest, relating, as it happens, to Selena’s merchant bankers.I have been here for two days and extremely busy, having promised Benjamin that I would arrive early and make sure everything was properly organised: it is several months since he was last here himself and, in spite of being a brilliant economist, he has no more idea of practical housekeeping than—well, than you have, if you will forgive my so expressing it. He seemed to have only a vague idea of how many people he had invited, when they were likely to get here and where they were all going to sleep: he said oh, that things would sort themselves out. Which things, in my experience, very seldom do without active encouragement from someone.Still, I have now got the flat in reasonable order and feel entitled to relax a little. I am at present sitting on the drawing-room balcony, which has an exceptionally fine view across the bay. Immediately below there is a small place, with shops which include a good bakery, a passable delicatessen, and a disgracefully overpriced greengrocer, as well as two pleasant cafés and a slightly disreputable bar.Beyond that, I can see the upper portion of a large and very grand-looking villa, built, I imagine, towards the end of the last century, in what would then have seemed an idyllically tranquil and private position. Its tranquillity must now be as sadly impaired by the noise of the traffic along the Corniche as its privacy has been by the subsequent building of residential blocks of flats, such as this one, on the hillside above.For example, I have from here a clear view of the whole of the extensive roof terrace. And sitting on the roof terrace, even as I write, is Sir Robert Renfrew—I recognised him at once, having seen him several times on his visits to Chambers for conferences with Selena. Though I knew, of course, when she described his villa to us, that it must be in the same general area as Benjamin’s flat, I had no idea that they were in such immediate proximity.Sir Robert, I suspect, does not fully realise how open the terrace is to observation and regards himself as enjoying there the same degree of privacy as if he were indoors. I first saw him two days ago, the morning after I arrived here, when I was having my coffee and croissant on the balcony and he was performing his exercises, dressed only in shorts and a vest—an activity, I think, which an elderly gentleman with a tendency to plumpness would normally wish to engage in, if at all, without an audience.He seems to spend a good deal of time on the terrace, not only doing exercises but also apparently working. He is from time to time attended on by three ladies, none, I am relieved to say, of scandalously youthful or seductive appearance: one in a black dress and apron, presumably the housekeeper, who brings him occasional refreshments; one in a well-tailored linen trouser suit, obviously Miss Tavistock, whom he summons by means of an old-fashioned handbell to take dictation; one of fairly advanced years and a somewhat equine countenance, no doubt his wife, who favours him with her company for the customary aperitif before dinner.Today, however, there has been an interruption in this tranquil mode of existence.The first sign of it was just after midday, when the post and the English newspapers arrive here. I had collected your letter and a copy of today’s Times from the concierge and settled down out here on the balcony to read them. Glancing at the terrace, I saw Sir Robert sitting peacefully in his chair and apparently similarly occupied. Your letter, I need hardly say, engaged my entire attention for several minutes, after which I again looked across at the terrace, just in time to observe a remarkable transformation in his demeanour. I thought at first that something in his newspaper or his correspondence had provoked him to a sudden rage, but decided after a few moments that his mood was one of excitement rather than anger.He had leapt up from his chair and was brandishing his handbell with such vigour that I almost expected to hear the sound of it all the way across the place. Miss Tavistock came running and seemed to receive instructions, of a brisk and urgent nature, after which she disappeared again. Sir Robert did a few exercises, as if suddenly needing to work off surplus energy, and then also left the terrace.I too went indoors, with the intention of making myself lunch—a task more difficult than I had envisaged. All the cooking appliances in the flat depend for their operation on a supply of gas, not from the mains but from a replaceable cylinder: I was halfway through cooking myself what might have been a rather delicious omelette with fines herbes when I discovered that the cylinder was empty, and must indeed have been nearly so when I arrived.There was a note pinned up on the wall beside the stove giving directions on where to find the replacement cylinder: having followed them, I discovered that there was no replacement cylinder. I reminded myself with some effort that Benjamin was my friend and host and it would be unseemly to think unkind thoughts of him.He had advised me, if I should have any unexpected problems, to seek the assistance of his next-door neighbour—a physiotherapist of some sort, who studied art in her spare time and painted quite interesting watercolours. She was, he said, a very helpful and competent sort of person, and he was on friendly terms with her. Feeling that the difficulty with the gas cylinder was one of the unexpected problems which Benjamin had been expecting me to encounter, I went out and rang on her doorbell.The appearance of the young woman who answered was something of a surprise to me. For some reason I had pictured Mademoiselle Natasha as middle-aged and rather plain, wearing a sensible suit and perhaps a crisp white overall. In fact she was in her twenties and strikingly handsome, tall, dark eyed, black haired, with a splendidly aquiline profile—the product, one would guess, of a series of exotic alliances between different races and nationalities. She was dressed—well, her clothing is difficult to describe: it consisted largely of items of cream-coloured leather, including a pair of knee-high boots, which somehow left a number of areas uncovered—not at all the sort of garment which one associates with the medical profession.But when I asked her, rather apprehensively, whether she was Mademoiselle Natasha, she confirmed that she was, albeit in a tone which somewhat suggested that her name was none of my business.

I began to wonder if there were such a thing as carpenters’ block, like writers’ block, causing carpenters to be incapable of getting on with any work, and, if so, how long it might last.So preoccupied was I with this question that I almost failed to notice the entry into the restaurant of the very people in whom I was so deeply interested—that is to say, Sir Robert Renfrew and his two codirectors, accompanied, of course, by Miss Tavistock.For some reason—perhaps Lady Renfrew had objected to spending an evening hearing them talk business—they had evidently decided, like ourselves, to eat out. It was clear that Sir Robert was a known and valued customer: the headwaiter greeted him by name and deferentially conducted him with his guests to the table in the alcove next to ours.I now felt no doubt at all that this was indeed the restaurant where he had suffered his attack of food poisoning last summer. It seemed likely, however, from the fact of his returning there, that he did not hold the restaurant to blame for it—presumably he is well aware that on that occasion he had not actually eaten anything. I even began to wonder, indeed, whether he himself suspected that one of his codirectors had had some hand in the business and was staging one of those reenactments of the crime which I believe are popular in detective fiction. I thought that if so he was being extremely foolhardy.The new arrivals took no particular notice of Terry and myself. There was no reason why they should—apart from Sir Robert’s unfortunate collision with Terry a few months ago, which we all hope he has entirely forgotten, none of them had met either of us before. And since Terry was gossiping away with one of the waiters in fluent though ungrammatical French, they probably did not even realise that we were English.In these circumstances I found that I was able—as of course you know, I would not dream of deliberate eavesdropping, but these carved screens do give an illusion of privacy and they were making no effort to lower their voices—that I was unable to avoid hearing a substantial part of their conversation. Moreover, when we had finished our main course Terry went off to the kitchen to say hello to the chef, who he said was an old friend of his, leaving me with nothing to distract me from it.I gathered that Sir Robert had suddenly decided that morning that the time was ripe to proceed with a major acquisition which the Bank had for some time been considering on behalf of a client; he had summoned his fellow directors to Cannes with a view to taking action before the Christmas holiday. If I had known which company they were talking about, I might have managed to persuade myself that there would be nothing improper in having a modest flutter on it: but they all discreetly referred to it as “the target company,” rather than by name. Indeed, it appeared that before their arrival here neither Albany nor Bolton had known which company was to be the subject of discussion.“If you don’t mind my saying so, Chairman,” said Albany, sounding decidedly peevish, “it’s a pity you didn’t feel able to tell us before we left London which target you had in mind. We’d have found it helpful to check what we had on file about it—at least, I know I would.”“Ah well,” said Bolton, in his pronounced Lancashire accent, “I dare say we’ve looked at this one often enough to know pretty well what’s what.”“It’s a question of security,” said Sir Robert. “Once you start mentioning names on the telephone, you might as well make a public broadcast and have done with it.”Still, it must have been a little disconcerting for them, like being at school and having an unexpected exam—particularly for Albany, who evidently remembered almost nothing about the company under discussion. His rival, on the other hand, despite the lack of preparation, seemed to have all the relevant details at his fingertips.Becoming, as a result of this, increasingly illhumoured, Albany rather forgot himself. He began making remarks to Bolton which were close to being openly offensive, most inadequately disguised as the kind of jovial banter acceptable between friends and colleagues. For example, after Bolton had asked some question about the meaning of something on the menu: “I say, Bolton, old chap, don’t you find it a bit of a bore not knowing any French? Why don’t you go on one of those courses?“Nowt wrong with plain, old-fashioned English, in my opinion. It were good enough for old Bill Shakespeare, weren’t it? And he were a great writer—or so they tell me.”“So most educated people seem to think. But I suppose they didn’t go in for literature much at that college of yours at—where was it? Sorry, I always forget—Birmingham, was it?”“It were Worcester—bit southwest of Birmingham. Oh aye, there were a few lads there that studied poetry and such, but I wanted summat that would help me make a bit of brass.”Even without the possibility of anyone being poisoned, I could hardly imagine, in such an atmosphere, that any of them was having a very agreeable evening. It must have been rather a relief to them when the lights, already low, were dimmed still further, the pianist took his place at the piano and the patron stepped forward to tell us that we were to have the inestimable privilege of hearing la belle Zingara, who had just returned to Cannes after her acclaimed tour of European capitals.Whether Madame Zingara had any just claim to be described as beautiful it was impossible to tell: one had an impression merely of a tall, slim woman with a mass of dark hair and wearing more than enough makeup to conceal any defects of complexion. She was swathed in some kind of white, gauzy material, draped round her in the manner of a sari or toga. Inasmuch as it completely covered her from neck to ankle, one might have considered it a rather decorous garment; but the undulating movement of her hips and shoulders somehow made it look as if it were continuously in the process of slithering to the ground, so that the actual effect was rather the reverse.When she began to sing, however, her voice was unexpectedly attractive: a husky contralto with a touch of harshness, not of course in the class of Lenya or Mercouri but more than acceptable for delivering the same songs. So we had “Surabaya Johnny” and “Banal” and several others of that sort, mainly on the theme of overtrusting women deserted by heartless lovers. These were interspersed with songs of a rather different type, all unfamiliar to me and in the highest degree improper: from what I understood of them, which was rather less than half, I was extremely glad of my inability to understand the rest. The audience, however, seemed to find them amusing: they were greeted with much laughter and enthusiastic applause.I felt a certain uneasiness, while all this was going on, about those in the adjoining alcove. The conditions were rather worryingly suitable, if one really believed Albany or Bolton to be capable of such a thing, for putting something unwholesome in someone’s coffee cup. Still, there was nothing I could do about it. So far as I could tell, nothing untoward occurred save for Bolton suffering a fit of coughing and Albany, with manifestly insincere solicitude, thumping him on the back.Madame Zingara concluded her performance with “Pirate Jenny” from The Threepenny Opera. She moved round the restaurant as she sang it, hips and shoulders still undulating, white muslin still apparently precarious, pausing at each table to hold out a large copper bowl. Having not quite expected this, I wondered anxiously what sort of sum it would be proper to contribute.By chance, or so I imagined, my table was the last in her circuit, so that I had ample time to reflect on this question and to curse Terry for staying gossiping in the kitchen—I assumed that as an habitué he would have known how much was expected.I finally settled on fifty francs as an amount which could be neither insultingly small nor ludicrously generous and by the time she reached my table had a note of that value ready to place in the copper bowl. She waved it away, however, saying, “Ah, on ne prend pas de l’argent d’un joli garçon comme vous.”I looked at her in surprise and considerable embarrassment. She smiled and fluttered her long, mascaraed eyelashes. Under the heavy makeup I now recognised the features of our truant carpenter.I was speechless. Fortunately, because anything I said would have been profane; it would also have been in English and audible at the next table.“Mais comment ça arrive que vous trouvez tout seul?” the shameless creature continued.I collected myself sufficiently to reply in the same language that I was with a friend: and that if he did not shortly rejoin me I should be extremely cross.By the time he returned to our table, dressed in the rather more conventional garments he had arrived in, Sir Robert’s party had left, apparently without mishap.My intention had been, once we were back at the flat, to speak to him severely about his disgraceful conduct and then to retire early to bed. Somehow or other, this was not at all what happened. I had scarcely begun my lecture when he said, “Don’t scold me, Desmond, I only did it to cheer myself up a bit. I’m feeling so miserable,” and I could not bring myself to go on.He has a broken heart, poor boy, having formed a deep attachment which he believed reciprocal and found was not. “Cast aside,” he said, “like the proverbial soiled glove. Too banal for words, isn’t it?”We sat up until nearly three in the morning, drinking Benjamin’s brandy and playing Marlene Dietrich songs while I tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade him that from time to time in human history the same thing has happened to other people and they have sometimes managed to get over it. I even suggested the possibility of a reconciliation with the object of his attachment; but I was given to understand that things had been said which made this out of the question. If the object were to walk barefoot across France to beg for Terry’s forgiveness and present him with a train of forty snow-white camels, laden with gold and diamonds and boxes of marrons glacés, such forgiveness would not now be forthcoming. I am not feeling optimistic about our bookcases.The noises from the flat next door are becoming quite alarming—I can hardly imagine an ailment worth such an agonising cure as Natasha seems to provide.So far I have not seen anyone on the roof terrace this morning, nor much expected to, having gathered last night that the morning’s work at the villa would consist mainly of Geoffrey Bolton making telephone calls. There has been, however, a certain amount of interesting activity in the place.Shortly before ten o’clock, just as I was beginning my breakfast, Edgar Albany came into the place and walked across in the direction of the slightly disreputable bar I mentioned. Unfortunately, the bar itself is out of view from here, being on the same side of the place as this building: I am thus unable to tell you for certain whether he actually went into it and if so whether he stayed there.My guess, though, is that he did, because almost immediately afterwards Miss Tavistock also came into the place and sat down in the café on the opposite side, from which she would certainly be able to see all the comings and goings through the door of the slightly disreputable bar.Miss Tavistock does not strike me as the sort of woman who would normally fritter her time away in a café on a morning when there is work to be done. I am now as certain as can be that Sir Robert is repeating the experiment he tried when Selena was here: Miss Tavistock is acting on instructions to keep Albany under surveillance while he is outside the villa.But if I am right about that, I also think that he has somehow eluded her—perhaps inadvertently, with no idea that she was keeping watch on him. A few minutes ago, after she had been in the café for about half an hour, she made a telephone call. After that she paid her bill and left, presumably to return to the villa. I think that Albany must have come out of the bar and done something, such as hailing a taxi, which prevented her from following. The telephone call would have been to Sir Robert to report and ask further instructions.I am becoming quite seriously concerned about what is happening next door. I have just seen Natasha driving away in her car, and yet the cries of pain continue unabated—indeed, they almost sound like cries for help. I do not wish to do anything to offend her after she has been so kind, but it does seem irresponsible of her to have left her patient on his own in such a condition as he appears to be in.I have decided to run down to the postbox, so that this catches the eleven o’clock post and has some chance of reaching you before Christmas Day, and on my way back to knock discreetly at her door. If there is no answer and the cries are still continuing, I shall climb across onto her balcony, which adjoins this one, and find out what is going on.In haste, therefore, and hoping that you and your aunt both have a splendid Christmas and an excellent New Year,Yours,

 Cannes20th DecemberDear Julia,Painful as it is to be obliged to say such a thing, particularly to a dear and valued friend, I can see nothing at all to censure in your behaviour, either towards the Reverend Maurice or towards the girl Daphne.Unless there is some very material omission in the account you have given me, you did not, when you called on the Vicar, take a pistol with you; or, if you did, you did not threaten to shoot him with it if he declined to accompany you to the hostelry of your choice. In short, his decision to do so was an exercise of what theologians call free will: the consequences are his responsibility, not yours. Moreover, it is not for you to advise him on whether insider dealing is a mortal or a venial sin: if he is troubled about the question, he should speak to his Bishop.So please stop worrying about the Reverend Maurice and give me your undivided attention—I have things to tell you which I think you will find of interest, relating, as it happens, to Selena’s merchant bankers.I have been here for two days and extremely busy, having promised Benjamin that I would arrive early and make sure everything was properly organised: it is several months since he was last here himself and, in spite of being a brilliant economist, he has no more idea of practical housekeeping than—well, than you have, if you will forgive my so expressing it. He seemed to have only a vague idea of how many people he had invited, when they were likely to get here and where they were all going to sleep: he said oh, that things would sort themselves out. Which things, in my experience, very seldom do without active encouragement from someone.Still, I have now got the flat in reasonable order and feel entitled to relax a little. I am at present sitting on the drawing-room balcony, which has an exceptionally fine view across the bay. Immediately below there is a small place, with shops which include a good bakery, a passable delicatessen, and a disgracefully overpriced greengrocer, as well as two pleasant cafés and a slightly disreputable bar.Beyond that, I can see the upper portion of a large and very grand-looking villa, built, I imagine, towards the end of the last century, in what would then have seemed an idyllically tranquil and private position. Its tranquillity must now be as sadly impaired by the noise of the traffic along the Corniche as its privacy has been by the subsequent building of residential blocks of flats, such as this one, on the hillside above.For example, I have from here a clear view of the whole of the extensive roof terrace. And sitting on the roof terrace, even as I write, is Sir Robert Renfrew—I recognised him at once, having seen him several times on his visits to Chambers for conferences with Selena. Though I knew, of course, when she described his villa to us, that it must be in the same general area as Benjamin’s flat, I had no idea that they were in such immediate proximity.Sir Robert, I suspect, does not fully realise how open the terrace is to observation and regards himself as enjoying there the same degree of privacy as if he were indoors. I first saw him two days ago, the morning after I arrived here, when I was having my coffee and croissant on the balcony and he was performing his exercises, dressed only in shorts and a vest—an activity, I think, which an elderly gentleman with a tendency to plumpness would normally wish to engage in, if at all, without an audience.He seems to spend a good deal of time on the terrace, not only doing exercises but also apparently working. He is from time to time attended on by three ladies, none, I am relieved to say, of scandalously youthful or seductive appearance: one in a black dress and apron, presumably the housekeeper, who brings him occasional refreshments; one in a well-tailored linen trouser suit, obviously Miss Tavistock, whom he summons by means of an old-fashioned handbell to take dictation; one of fairly advanced years and a somewhat equine countenance, no doubt his wife, who favours him with her company for the customary aperitif before dinner.Today, however, there has been an interruption in this tranquil mode of existence.The first sign of it was just after midday, when the post and the English newspapers arrive here. I had collected your letter and a copy of today’s Times from the concierge and settled down out here on the balcony to read them. Glancing at the terrace, I saw Sir Robert sitting peacefully in his chair and apparently similarly occupied. Your letter, I need hardly say, engaged my entire attention for several minutes, after which I again looked across at the terrace, just in time to observe a remarkable transformation in his demeanour. I thought at first that something in his newspaper or his correspondence had provoked him to a sudden rage, but decided after a few moments that his mood was one of excitement rather than anger.He had leapt up from his chair and was brandishing his handbell with such vigour that I almost expected to hear the sound of it all the way across the place. Miss Tavistock came running and seemed to receive instructions, of a brisk and urgent nature, after which she disappeared again. Sir Robert did a few exercises, as if suddenly needing to work off surplus energy, and then also left the terrace.I too went indoors, with the intention of making myself lunch—a task more difficult than I had envisaged. All the cooking appliances in the flat depend for their operation on a supply of gas, not from the mains but from a replaceable cylinder: I was halfway through cooking myself what might have been a rather delicious omelette with fines herbes when I discovered that the cylinder was empty, and must indeed have been nearly so when I arrived.There was a note pinned up on the wall beside the stove giving directions on where to find the replacement cylinder: having followed them, I discovered that there was no replacement cylinder. I reminded myself with some effort that Benjamin was my friend and host and it would be unseemly to think unkind thoughts of him.He had advised me, if I should have any unexpected problems, to seek the assistance of his next-door neighbour—a physiotherapist of some sort, who studied art in her spare time and painted quite interesting watercolours. She was, he said, a very helpful and competent sort of person, and he was on friendly terms with her. Feeling that the difficulty with the gas cylinder was one of the unexpected problems which Benjamin had been expecting me to encounter, I went out and rang on her doorbell.The appearance of the young woman who answered was something of a surprise to me. For some reason I had pictured Mademoiselle Natasha as middle-aged and rather plain, wearing a sensible suit and perhaps a crisp white overall. In fact she was in her twenties and strikingly handsome, tall, dark eyed, black haired, with a splendidly aquiline profile—the product, one would guess, of a series of exotic alliances between different races and nationalities. She was dressed—well, her clothing is difficult to describe: it consisted largely of items of cream-coloured leather, including a pair of knee-high boots, which somehow left a number of areas uncovered—not at all the sort of garment which one associates with the medical profession.But when I asked her, rather apprehensively, whether she was Mademoiselle Natasha, she confirmed that she was, albeit in a tone which somewhat suggested that her name was none of my business. On hearing, however, that I was a friend and guest of Benjamin’s, she became quite cordial and proved extremely helpful in the matter of the cylinders. She was about to drive into town for lunch and intended to pass the garage from which replacements were obtained: she said that she would purchase two on my behalf and bring them back after lunch.The least I could do was make sure of being at hand to unload them. I therefore decided to take lunch in the nearest café, which is only a few yards away from the entrance to our block of flats. Having consoled myself for my ruined omelette with a croque-monsieur and a chocolate ice cream, I remained there, reading my guidebook and glancing frequently out of the window to be sure of seeing her as soon as she returned.And that was how I happened to see Miss Tavistock, driving through the place—a Bentley, as it happens, not a Mercedes—in the direction of Nice; she was alone in the car.Natasha not only remembered to buy the cylinders but helped me to carry them up to the flat and to install one of them in its proper place beside the stove. After this, naturally, I offered her a drink, which she accepted, and we came and sat out here on the balcony.Her English, like my French, is serviceable rather than fluent; but between the two we managed to have quite a pleasant and interesting conversation, mostly about painting. I did try asking her about her work as a physiotherapist—she tells me that she specialises in pains of the lower back; but she seemed to be far more interested in her artistic studies—she has promised to show me some of her watercolours. Her work has occasionally been exhibited in one of the small art galleries in the neighbourhood and sold sufficiently well to give her hopes of someday making her living by it.As she was telling me this, she suddenly pointed towards the place and said, “Oh, there is one of my patrons. Madame Tavistock—she has bought several of my things. She is English, but very intelligent, very artistic—you should meet her, Desmond. Poor Madame Tavistock—she works for a bank and meets only imbeciles who talk about money and motorcars.”I looked in the direction she was pointing and saw the Bentley on its way back towards the villa. Miss Tavistock was still at the wheel, but no longer alone—she had two passengers. Her journey had taken about the time one would expect if she had been collecting someone from Nice airport: although I was too far away to see them clearly, I somehow at once felt sure that I knew who they were.Natasha left soon afterwards, saying unenthusiastically that she had a patient arriving for treatment: “Another imbecile, but one must live.”Her treatments are evidently on the vigorous side—she said that her patients sometimes became rather noisy, and she hoped I would not be disturbed.Having become rather curious about what was going on at the villa, and hoping to confirm my speculation as to the identity of the two passengers, I remained on the balcony.Just as I was beginning to write this letter, Sir Robert reappeared on the roof terrace, where he was joined soon afterwards by his wife and Miss Tavistock. And then, a few minutes ago, the party was further augmented by two men in City suits, as if they had come straight from their offices, who I have no doubt at all are Edgar Albany and Geoffrey Bolton. It’s true I’ve only seen them once before, when Sir Robert brought them to see Selena in Chambers, but I’m quite sure I’m not mistaken.I’m equally sure that their visit was not planned in advance—that they were summoned here by Sir Robert only a few hours ago, as a result of something he received in the post or read in the newspaper this morning. I suppose there may have been something in the financial pages which would provide a reason to convene an urgent directors’ meeting. But is it the real reason or merely a pretext? I strongly suspect, given the similarity of the conditions, that he is trying again to set a trap for the insider dealer, in the same way that he did when Selena was here in the summer. I can’t help feeling that this may be rather dangerous—another attack of food poisoning might have serious consequences.Well, I shall keep as close an eye on the situation as circumstances permit. I have already, I’m afraid, spent more time on observing what is happening at the villa than is entirely consistent with my other obligations: Terry has rung to say that he is arriving this evening, and I haven’t the faintest idea what to give him for supper—we shall probably have to go out somewhere. If he complains, I shall talk meaningfully of pots, kettles, and unfinished bookcases.21st DecemberDo please forgive me if the rest of this letter is somewhat disjointed: there are some rather strange noises coming from the flat next door—if Natasha had not warned me, I should think them very strange indeed—which make it slightly difficult to concentrate.Although it is after ten A.M., I have only just finished breakfast, having risen disgracefully late and with a slight hangover. For this I entirely blame Terry, of whose disgraceful behaviour I am about to give full particulars: really, I don’t know what carpenters are coming to nowadays.He arrived yesterday evening at about seven and readily agreed to go out to dinner rather than eat at the flat. What I had envisaged was a modest meal at one of the cafés in the place; but he persuaded me that we should go instead to a Moroccan restaurant, known to him from previous visits.It was in a narrow side street a few minutes’ walk away, behind the sort of unassuming frontage which in France so often conceals a restaurant of some distinction. Inside, it was quite luxuriously furnished and decorated, in a quasi-Moorish style: thick carpets and silky draperies; divans round low circular tables in alcoves divided by carved wooden screens; brass lamps of the kind one might rub if one hoped to be given three wishes. At the end of the room, a piano and a small dais suggested that later in the evening some form of musical entertainment might be provided.Rather to my alarm, the waiters all greeted Terry like a long-lost brother or nephew: the thing most likely to inspire such fond and enduring memories seemed to me to be a habit of reckless overtipping, which I feared I would be expected to emulate.It also occurred to me that this might well be the same restaurant in which Sir Robert was taken ill in the summer. I decided not to risk the moules marinières.I refrained throughout the meal from any mention of bookcases. Terry was in an odd sort of mood, one moment excessively animated, the next despondent, so that I was reluctant to say anything which might depress his spirits. Besides, on the first evening of his holiday, I felt it would be unkind to reproach him. On the other hand, I thought it no more than polite to enquire about his plans for the refurbishment of Benjamin’s flat.“Oh,” he said vaguely, “I’m thinking fin de siècle. Aubrey Beardsley and winters in Egypt and so on—you know the kind of thing.”But I was dismayed to observe that he spoke listlessly, with none of the enthusiasm which he used to show for such matters. I began to wonder if there were such a thing as carpenters’ block, like writers’ block, causing carpenters to be incapable of getting on with any work, and, if so, how long it might last.So preoccupied was I with this question that I almost failed to notice the entry into the restaurant of the very people in whom I was so deeply interested—that is to say, Sir Robert Renfrew and his two codirectors, accompanied, of course, by Miss Tavistock.For some reason—perhaps Lady Renfrew had objected to spending an evening hearing them talk business—they had evidently decided, like ourselves, to eat out.

It seemed likely, however, from the fact of his returning there, that he did not hold the restaurant to blame for it—presumably he is well aware that on that occasion he had not actually eaten anything. I even began to wonder, indeed, whether he himself suspected that one of his codirectors had had some hand in the business and was staging one of those reenactments of the crime which I believe are popular in detective fiction. I thought that if so he was being extremely foolhardy.The new arrivals took no particular notice of Terry and myself.

I’m feeling so miserable,” and I could not bring myself to go on.He has a broken heart, poor boy, having formed a deep attachment which he believed reciprocal and found was not. “Cast aside,” he said, “like the proverbial soiled glove. Too banal for words, isn’t it?”We sat up until nearly three in the morning, drinking Benjamin’s brandy and playing Marlene Dietrich songs while I tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade him that from time to time in human history the same thing has happened to other people and they have sometimes managed to get over it. I even suggested the possibility of a reconciliation with the object of his attachment; but I was given to understand that things had been said which made this out of the question. If the object were to walk barefoot across France to beg for Terry’s forgiveness and present him with a train of forty snow-white camels, laden with gold and diamonds and boxes of marrons glacés, such forgiveness would not now be forthcoming. I am not feeling optimistic about our bookcases.The noises from the flat next door are becoming quite alarming—I can hardly imagine an ailment worth such an agonising cure as Natasha seems to provide.So far I have not seen anyone on the roof terrace this morning, nor much expected to, having gathered last night that the morning’s work at the villa would consist mainly of Geoffrey Bolton making telephone calls. There has been, however, a certain amount of interesting activity in the place.Shortly before ten o’clock, just as I was beginning my breakfast, Edgar Albany came into the place and walked across in the direction of the slightly disreputable bar I mentioned. Unfortunately, the bar itself is out of view from here, being on the same side of the place as this building: I am thus unable to tell you for certain whether he actually went into it and if so whether he stayed there.My guess, though, is that he did, because almost immediately afterwards Miss Tavistock also came into the place and sat down in the café on the opposite side, from which she would certainly be able to see all the comings and goings through the door of the slightly disreputable bar.Miss Tavistock does not strike me as the sort of woman who would normally fritter her time away in a café on a morning when there is work to be done. I am now as certain as can be that Sir Robert is repeating the experiment he tried when Selena was here: Miss Tavistock is acting on instructions to keep Albany under surveillance while he is outside the villa.But if I am right about that, I also think that he has somehow eluded her—perhaps inadvertently, with no idea that she was keeping watch on him. A few minutes ago, after she had been in the café for about half an hour, she made a telephone call. After that she paid her bill and left, presumably to return to the villa. I think that Albany must have come out of the bar and done something, such as hailing a taxi, which prevented her from following. The telephone call would have been to Sir Robert to report and ask further instructions.I am becoming quite seriously concerned about what is happening next door. I have just seen Natasha driving away in her car, and yet the cries of pain continue unabated—indeed, they almost sound like cries for help. I do not wish to do anything to offend her after she has been so kind, but it does seem irresponsible of her to have left her patient on his own in such a condition as he appears to be in.I have decided to run down to the postbox, so that this catches the eleven o’clock post and has some chance of reaching you before Christmas Day, and on my way back to knock discreetly at her door. If there is no answer and the cries are still continuing, I shall climb across onto her balcony, which adjoins this one, and find out what is going on.In haste, therefore, and hoping that you and your aunt both have a splendid Christmas and an excellent New Year,Yours,

 Cannes20th DecemberDear Julia,Painful as it is to be obliged to say such a thing, particularly to a dear and valued friend, I can see nothing at all to censure in your behaviour, either towards the Reverend Maurice or towards the girl Daphne.Unless there is some very material omission in the account you have given me, you did not, when you called on the Vicar, take a pistol with you; or, if you did, you did not threaten to shoot him with it if he declined to accompany you to the hostelry of your choice. In short, his decision to do so was an exercise of what theologians call free will: the consequences are his responsibility, not yours. Moreover, it is not for you to advise him on whether insider dealing is a mortal or a venial sin: if he is troubled about the question, he should speak to his Bishop.So please stop worrying about the Reverend Maurice and give me your undivided attention—I have things to tell you which I think you will find of interest, relating, as it happens, to Selena’s merchant bankers.I have been here for two days and extremely busy, having promised Benjamin that I would arrive early and make sure everything was properly organised: it is several months since he was last here himself and, in spite of being a brilliant economist, he has no more idea of practical housekeeping than—well, than you have, if you will forgive my so expressing it. He seemed to have only a vague idea of how many people he had invited, when they were likely to get here and where they were all going to sleep: he said oh, that things would sort themselves out. Which things, in my experience, very seldom do without active encouragement from someone.Still, I have now got the flat in reasonable order and feel entitled to relax a little. I am at present sitting on the drawing-room balcony, which has an exceptionally fine view across the bay. Immediately below there is a small place, with shops which include a good bakery, a passable delicatessen, and a disgracefully overpriced greengrocer, as well as two pleasant cafés and a slightly disreputable bar.Beyond that, I can see the upper portion of a large and very grand-looking villa, built, I imagine, towards the end of the last century, in what would then have seemed an idyllically tranquil and private position. Its tranquillity must now be as sadly impaired by the noise of the traffic along the Corniche as its privacy has been by the subsequent building of residential blocks of flats, such as this one, on the hillside above.For example, I have from here a clear view of the whole of the extensive roof terrace. And sitting on the roof terrace, even as I write, is Sir Robert Renfrew—I recognised him at once, having seen him several times on his visits to Chambers for conferences with Selena. Though I knew, of course, when she described his villa to us, that it must be in the same general area as Benjamin’s flat, I had no idea that they were in such immediate proximity.Sir Robert, I suspect, does not fully realise how open the terrace is to observation and regards himself as enjoying there the same degree of privacy as if he were indoors. I first saw him two days ago, the morning after I arrived here, when I was having my coffee and croissant on the balcony and he was performing his exercises, dressed only in shorts and a vest—an activity, I think, which an elderly gentleman with a tendency to plumpness would normally wish to engage in, if at all, without an audience.He seems to spend a good deal of time on the terrace, not only doing exercises but also apparently working. He is from time to time attended on by three ladies, none, I am relieved to say, of scandalously youthful or seductive appearance: one in a black dress and apron, presumably the housekeeper, who brings him occasional refreshments; one in a well-tailored linen trouser suit, obviously Miss Tavistock, whom he summons by means of an old-fashioned handbell to take dictation; one of fairly advanced years and a somewhat equine countenance, no doubt his wife, who favours him with her company for the customary aperitif before dinner.Today, however, there has been an interruption in this tranquil mode of existence.The first sign of it was just after midday, when the post and the English newspapers arrive here. I had collected your letter and a copy of today’s Times from the concierge and settled down out here on the balcony to read them. Glancing at the terrace, I saw Sir Robert sitting peacefully in his chair and apparently similarly occupied. Your letter, I need hardly say, engaged my entire attention for several minutes, after which I again looked across at the terrace, just in time to observe a remarkable transformation in his demeanour. I thought at first that something in his newspaper or his correspondence had provoked him to a sudden rage, but decided after a few moments that his mood was one of excitement rather than anger.He had leapt up from his chair and was brandishing his handbell with such vigour that I almost expected to hear the sound of it all the way across the place. Miss Tavistock came running and seemed to receive instructions, of a brisk and urgent nature, after which she disappeared again. Sir Robert did a few exercises, as if suddenly needing to work off surplus energy, and then also left the terrace.I too went indoors, with the intention of making myself lunch—a task more difficult than I had envisaged. All the cooking appliances in the flat depend for their operation on a supply of gas, not from the mains but from a replaceable cylinder: I was halfway through cooking myself what might have been a rather delicious omelette with fines herbes when I discovered that the cylinder was empty, and must indeed have been nearly so when I arrived.There was a note pinned up on the wall beside the stove giving directions on where to find the replacement cylinder: having followed them, I discovered that there was no replacement cylinder. I reminded myself with some effort that Benjamin was my friend and host and it would be unseemly to think unkind thoughts of him.He had advised me, if I should have any unexpected problems, to seek the assistance of his next-door neighbour—a physiotherapist of some sort, who studied art in her spare time and painted quite interesting watercolours. She was, he said, a very helpful and competent sort of person, and he was on friendly terms with her. Feeling that the difficulty with the gas cylinder was one of the unexpected problems which Benjamin had been expecting me to encounter, I went out and rang on her doorbell.The appearance of the young woman who answered was something of a surprise to me. For some reason I had pictured Mademoiselle Natasha as middle-aged and rather plain, wearing a sensible suit and perhaps a crisp white overall. In fact she was in her twenties and strikingly handsome, tall, dark eyed, black haired, with a splendidly aquiline profile—the product, one would guess, of a series of exotic alliances between different races and nationalities. She was dressed—well, her clothing is difficult to describe: it consisted largely of items of cream-coloured leather, including a pair of knee-high boots, which somehow left a number of areas uncovered—not at all the sort of garment which one associates with the medical profession.But when I asked her, rather apprehensively, whether she was Mademoiselle Natasha, she confirmed that she was, albeit in a tone which somewhat suggested that her name was none of my business. On hearing, however, that I was a friend and guest of Benjamin’s, she became quite cordial and proved extremely helpful in the matter of the cylinders. She was about to drive into town for lunch and intended to pass the garage from which replacements were obtained: she said that she would purchase two on my behalf and bring them back after lunch.The least I could do was make sure of being at hand to unload them. I therefore decided to take lunch in the nearest café, which is only a few yards away from the entrance to our block of flats. Having consoled myself for my ruined omelette with a croque-monsieur and a chocolate ice cream, I remained there, reading my guidebook and glancing frequently out of the window to be sure of seeing her as soon as she returned.And that was how I happened to see Miss Tavistock, driving through the place—a Bentley, as it happens, not a Mercedes—in the direction of Nice; she was alone in the car.Natasha not only remembered to buy the cylinders but helped me to carry them up to the flat and to install one of them in its proper place beside the stove. After this, naturally, I offered her a drink, which she accepted, and we came and sat out here on the balcony.Her English, like my French, is serviceable rather than fluent; but between the two we managed to have quite a pleasant and interesting conversation, mostly about painting. I did try asking her about her work as a physiotherapist—she tells me that she specialises in pains of the lower back; but she seemed to be far more interested in her artistic studies—she has promised to show me some of her watercolours. Her work has occasionally been exhibited in one of the small art galleries in the neighbourhood and sold sufficiently well to give her hopes of someday making her living by it.As she was telling me this, she suddenly pointed towards the place and said, “Oh, there is one of my patrons. Madame Tavistock—she has bought several of my things. She is English, but very intelligent, very artistic—you should meet her, Desmond. Poor Madame Tavistock—she works for a bank and meets only imbeciles who talk about money and motorcars.”I looked in the direction she was pointing and saw the Bentley on its way back towards the villa. Miss Tavistock was still at the wheel, but no longer alone—she had two passengers. Her journey had taken about the time one would expect if she had been collecting someone from Nice airport: although I was too far away to see them clearly, I somehow at once felt sure that I knew who they were.Natasha left soon afterwards, saying unenthusiastically that she had a patient arriving for treatment: “Another imbecile, but one must live.”Her treatments are evidently on the vigorous side—she said that her patients sometimes became rather noisy, and she hoped I would not be disturbed.Having become rather curious about what was going on at the villa, and hoping to confirm my speculation as to the identity of the two passengers, I remained on the balcony.Just as I was beginning to write this letter, Sir Robert reappeared on the roof terrace, where he was joined soon afterwards by his wife and Miss Tavistock. And then, a few minutes ago, the party was further augmented by two men in City suits, as if they had come straight from their offices, who I have no doubt at all are Edgar Albany and Geoffrey Bolton. It’s true I’ve only seen them once before, when Sir Robert brought them to see Selena in Chambers, but I’m quite sure I’m not mistaken.I’m equally sure that their visit was not planned in advance—that they were summoned here by Sir Robert only a few hours ago, as a result of something he received in the post or read in the newspaper this morning. I suppose there may have been something in the financial pages which would provide a reason to convene an urgent directors’ meeting. But is it the real reason or merely a pretext? I strongly suspect, given the similarity of the conditions, that he is trying again to set a trap for the insider dealer, in the same way that he did when Selena was here in the summer. I can’t help feeling that this may be rather dangerous—another attack of food poisoning might have serious consequences.Well, I shall keep as close an eye on the situation as circumstances permit. I have already, I’m afraid, spent more time on observing what is happening at the villa than is entirely consistent with my other obligations: Terry has rung to say that he is arriving this evening, and I haven’t the faintest idea what to give him for supper—we shall probably have to go out somewhere. If he complains, I shall talk meaningfully of pots, kettles, and unfinished bookcases.21st DecemberDo please forgive me if the rest of this letter is somewhat disjointed: there are some rather strange noises coming from the flat next door—if Natasha had not warned me, I should think them very strange indeed—which make it slightly difficult to concentrate.Although it is after ten A.M., I have only just finished breakfast, having risen disgracefully late and with a slight hangover. For this I entirely blame Terry, of whose disgraceful behaviour I am about to give full particulars: really, I don’t know what carpenters are coming to nowadays.He arrived yesterday evening at about seven and readily agreed to go out to dinner rather than eat at the flat. What I had envisaged was a modest meal at one of the cafés in the place; but he persuaded me that we should go instead to a Moroccan restaurant, known to him from previous visits.It was in a narrow side street a few minutes’ walk away, behind the sort of unassuming frontage which in France so often conceals a restaurant of some distinction. Inside, it was quite luxuriously furnished and decorated, in a quasi-Moorish style: thick carpets and silky draperies; divans round low circular tables in alcoves divided by carved wooden screens; brass lamps of the kind one might rub if one hoped to be given three wishes. At the end of the room, a piano and a small dais suggested that later in the evening some form of musical entertainment might be provided.Rather to my alarm, the waiters all greeted Terry like a long-lost brother or nephew: the thing most likely to inspire such fond and enduring memories seemed to me to be a habit of reckless overtipping, which I feared I would be expected to emulate.It also occurred to me that this might well be the same restaurant in which Sir Robert was taken ill in the summer. I decided not to risk the moules marinières.I refrained throughout the meal from any mention of bookcases. Terry was in an odd sort of mood, one moment excessively animated, the next despondent, so that I was reluctant to say anything which might depress his spirits. Besides, on the first evening of his holiday, I felt it would be unkind to reproach him. On the other hand, I thought it no more than polite to enquire about his plans for the refurbishment of Benjamin’s flat.“Oh,” he said vaguely, “I’m thinking fin de siècle. Aubrey Beardsley and winters in Egypt and so on—you know the kind of thing.”But I was dismayed to observe that he spoke listlessly, with none of the enthusiasm which he used to show for such matters. I began to wonder if there were such a thing as carpenters’ block, like writers’ block, causing carpenters to be incapable of getting on with any work, and, if so, how long it might last.So preoccupied was I with this question that I almost failed to notice the entry into the restaurant of the very people in whom I was so deeply interested—that is to say, Sir Robert Renfrew and his two codirectors, accompanied, of course, by Miss Tavistock.For some reason—perhaps Lady Renfrew had objected to spending an evening hearing them talk business—they had evidently decided, like ourselves, to eat out. It was clear that Sir Robert was a known and valued customer: the headwaiter greeted him by name and deferentially conducted him with his guests to the table in the alcove next to ours.I now felt no doubt at all that this was indeed the restaurant where he had suffered his attack of food poisoning last summer. It seemed likely, however, from the fact of his returning there, that he did not hold the restaurant to blame for it—presumably he is well aware that on that occasion he had not actually eaten anything. I even began to wonder, indeed, whether he himself suspected that one of his codirectors had had some hand in the business and was staging one of those reenactments of the crime which I believe are popular in detective fiction. I thought that if so he was being extremely foolhardy.The new arrivals took no particular notice of Terry and myself. There was no reason why they should—apart from Sir Robert’s unfortunate collision with Terry a few months ago, which we all hope he has entirely forgotten, none of them had met either of us before. And since Terry was gossiping away with one of the waiters in fluent though ungrammatical French, they probably did not even realise that we were English.In these circumstances I found that I was able—as of course you know, I would not dream of deliberate eavesdropping, but these carved screens do give an illusion of privacy and they were making no effort to lower their voices—that I was unable to avoid hearing a substantial part of their conversation. Moreover, when we had finished our main course Terry went off to the kitchen to say hello to the chef, who he said was an old friend of his, leaving me with nothing to distract me from it.I gathered that Sir Robert had suddenly decided that morning that the time was ripe to proceed with a major acquisition which the Bank had for some time been considering on behalf of a client; he had summoned his fellow directors to Cannes with a view to taking action before the Christmas holiday. If I had known which company they were talking about, I might have managed to persuade myself that there would be nothing improper in having a modest flutter on it: but they all discreetly referred to it as “the target company,” rather than by name. Indeed, it appeared that before their arrival here neither Albany nor Bolton had known which company was to be the subject of discussion.“If you don’t mind my saying so, Chairman,” said Albany, sounding decidedly peevish, “it’s a pity you didn’t feel able to tell us before we left London which target you had in mind. We’d have found it helpful to check what we had on file about it—at least, I know I would.”“Ah well,” said Bolton, in his pronounced Lancashire accent, “I dare say we’ve looked at this one often enough to know pretty well what’s what.”“It’s a question of security,” said Sir Robert. “Once you start mentioning names on the telephone, you might as well make a public broadcast and have done with it.”Still, it must have been a little disconcerting for them, like being at school and having an unexpected exam—particularly for Albany, who evidently remembered almost nothing about the company under discussion. His rival, on the other hand, despite the lack of preparation, seemed to have all the relevant details at his fingertips.Becoming, as a result of this, increasingly illhumoured, Albany rather forgot himself. He began making remarks to Bolton which were close to being openly offensive, most inadequately disguised as the kind of jovial banter acceptable between friends and colleagues. For example, after Bolton had asked some question about the meaning of something on the menu: “I say, Bolton, old chap, don’t you find it a bit of a bore not knowing any French? Why don’t you go on one of those courses?“Nowt wrong with plain, old-fashioned English, in my opinion. It were good enough for old Bill Shakespeare, weren’t it? And he were a great writer—or so they tell me.”“So most educated people seem to think. But I suppose they didn’t go in for literature much at that college of yours at—where was it? Sorry, I always forget—Birmingham, was it?”“It were Worcester—bit southwest of Birmingham. Oh aye, there were a few lads there that studied poetry and such, but I wanted summat that would help me make a bit of brass.”Even without the possibility of anyone being poisoned, I could hardly imagine, in such an atmosphere, that any of them was having a very agreeable evening. It must have been rather a relief to them when the lights, already low, were dimmed still further, the pianist took his place at the piano and the patron stepped forward to tell us that we were to have the inestimable privilege of hearing la belle Zingara, who had just returned to Cannes after her acclaimed tour of European capitals.Whether Madame Zingara had any just claim to be described as beautiful it was impossible to tell: one had an impression merely of a tall, slim woman with a mass of dark hair and wearing more than enough makeup to conceal any defects of complexion. She was swathed in some kind of white, gauzy material, draped round her in the manner of a sari or toga. Inasmuch as it completely covered her from neck to ankle, one might have considered it a rather decorous garment; but the undulating movement of her hips and shoulders somehow made it look as if it were continuously in the process of slithering to the ground, so that the actual effect was rather the reverse.When she began to sing, however, her voice was unexpectedly attractive: a husky contralto with a touch of harshness, not of course in the class of Lenya or Mercouri but more than acceptable for delivering the same songs. So we had “Surabaya Johnny” and “Banal” and several others of that sort, mainly on the theme of overtrusting women deserted by heartless lovers. These were interspersed with songs of a rather different type, all unfamiliar to me and in the highest degree improper: from what I understood of them, which was rather less than half, I was extremely glad of my inability to understand the rest. The audience, however, seemed to find them amusing: they were greeted with much laughter and enthusiastic applause.I felt a certain uneasiness, while all this was going on, about those in the adjoining alcove. The conditions were rather worryingly suitable, if one really believed Albany or Bolton to be capable of such a thing, for putting something unwholesome in someone’s coffee cup. Still, there was nothing I could do about it. So far as I could tell, nothing untoward occurred save for Bolton suffering a fit of coughing and Albany, with manifestly insincere solicitude, thumping him on the back.Madame Zingara concluded her performance with “Pirate Jenny” from The Threepenny Opera. She moved round the restaurant as she sang it, hips and shoulders still undulating, white muslin still apparently precarious, pausing at each table to hold out a large copper bowl. Having not quite expected this, I wondered anxiously what sort of sum it would be proper to contribute.By chance, or so I imagined, my table was the last in her circuit, so that I had ample time to reflect on this question and to curse Terry for staying gossiping in the kitchen—I assumed that as an habitué he would have known how much was expected.I finally settled on fifty francs as an amount which could be neither insultingly small nor ludicrously generous and by the time she reached my table had a note of that value ready to place in the copper bowl. She waved it away, however, saying, “Ah, on ne prend pas de l’argent d’un joli garçon comme vous.”I looked at her in surprise and considerable embarrassment. She smiled and fluttered her long, mascaraed eyelashes. Under the heavy makeup I now recognised the features of our truant carpenter.I was speechless. Fortunately, because anything I said would have been profane; it would also have been in English and audible at the next table.“Mais comment ça arrive que vous trouvez tout seul?” the shameless creature continued.I collected myself sufficiently to reply in the same language that I was with a friend: and that if he did not shortly rejoin me I should be extremely cross.By the time he returned to our table, dressed in the rather more conventional garments he had arrived in, Sir Robert’s party had left, apparently without mishap.My intention had been, once we were back at the flat, to speak to him severely about his disgraceful conduct and then to retire early to bed.

I even suggested the possibility of a reconciliation with the object of his attachment; but I was given to understand that things had been said which made this out of the question.

I thought at first that something in his newspaper or his correspondence had provoked him to a sudden rage, but decided after a few moments that his mood was one of excitement rather than anger.He had leapt up from his chair and was brandishing his handbell with such vigour that I almost expected to hear the sound of it all the way across the place. Miss Tavistock came running and seemed to receive instructions, of a brisk and urgent nature, after which she disappeared again. Sir Robert did a few exercises, as if suddenly needing to work off surplus energy, and then also left the terrace.I too went indoors, with the intention of making myself lunch—a task more difficult than I had envisaged. All the cooking appliances in the flat depend for their operation on a supply of gas, not from the mains but from a replaceable cylinder: I was halfway through cooking myself what might have been a rather delicious omelette with fines herbes when I discovered that the cylinder was empty, and must indeed have been nearly so when I arrived.There was a note pinned up on the wall beside the stove giving directions on where to find the replacement cylinder: having followed them, I discovered that there was no replacement cylinder. I reminded myself with some effort that Benjamin was my friend and host and it would be unseemly to think unkind thoughts of him.He had advised me, if I should have any unexpected problems, to seek the assistance of his next-door neighbour—a physiotherapist of some sort, who studied art in her spare time and painted quite interesting watercolours. She was, he said, a very helpful and competent sort of person, and he was on friendly terms with her. Feeling that the difficulty with the gas cylinder was one of the unexpected problems which Benjamin had been expecting me to encounter, I went out and rang on her doorbell.The appearance of the young woman who answered was something of a surprise to me. For some reason I had pictured Mademoiselle Natasha as middle-aged and rather plain, wearing a sensible suit and perhaps a crisp white overall. In fact she was in her twenties and strikingly handsome, tall, dark eyed, black haired, with a splendidly aquiline profile—the product, one would guess, of a series of exotic alliances between different races and nationalities. She was dressed—well, her clothing is difficult to describe: it consisted largely of items of cream-coloured leather, including a pair of knee-high boots, which somehow left a number of areas uncovered—not at all the sort of garment which one associates with the medical profession.But when I asked her, rather apprehensively, whether she was Mademoiselle Natasha, she confirmed that she was, albeit in a tone which somewhat suggested that her name was none of my business. On hearing, however, that I was a friend and guest of Benjamin’s, she became quite cordial and proved extremely helpful in the matter of the cylinders. She was about to drive into town for lunch and intended to pass the garage from which replacements were obtained: she said that she would purchase two on my behalf and bring them back after lunch.The least I could do was make sure of being at hand to unload them. I therefore decided to take lunch in the nearest café, which is only a few yards away from the entrance to our block of flats. Having consoled myself for my ruined omelette with a croque-monsieur and a chocolate ice cream, I remained there, reading my guidebook and glancing frequently out of the window to be sure of seeing her as soon as she returned.And that was how I happened to see Miss Tavistock, driving through the place—a Bentley, as it happens, not a Mercedes—in the direction of Nice; she was alone in the car.Natasha not only remembered to buy the cylinders but helped me to carry them up to the flat and to install one of them in its proper place beside the stove. After this, naturally, I offered her a drink, which she accepted, and we came and sat out here on the balcony.Her English, like my French, is serviceable rather than fluent; but between the two we managed to have quite a pleasant and interesting conversation, mostly about painting. I did try asking her about her work as a physiotherapist—she tells me that she specialises in pains of the lower back; but she seemed to be far more interested in her artistic studies—she has promised to show me some of her watercolours. Her work has occasionally been exhibited in one of the small art galleries in the neighbourhood and sold sufficiently well to give her hopes of someday making her living by it.As she was telling me this, she suddenly pointed towards the place and said, “Oh, there is one of my patrons. Madame Tavistock—she has bought several of my things. She is English, but very intelligent, very artistic—you should meet her, Desmond. Poor Madame Tavistock—she works for a bank and meets only imbeciles who talk about money and motorcars.”I looked in the direction she was pointing and saw the Bentley on its way back towards the villa. Miss Tavistock was still at the wheel, but no longer alone—she had two passengers. Her journey had taken about the time one would expect if she had been collecting someone from Nice airport: although I was too far away to see them clearly, I somehow at once felt sure that I knew who they were.Natasha left soon afterwards, saying unenthusiastically that she had a patient arriving for treatment: “Another imbecile, but one must live.”Her treatments are evidently on the vigorous side—she said that her patients sometimes became rather noisy, and she hoped I would not be disturbed.Having become rather curious about what was going on at the villa, and hoping to confirm my speculation as to the identity of the two passengers, I remained on the balcony.Just as I was beginning to write this letter, Sir Robert reappeared on the roof terrace, where he was joined soon afterwards by his wife and Miss Tavistock. And then, a few minutes ago, the party was further augmented by two men in City suits, as if they had come straight from their offices, who I have no doubt at all are Edgar Albany and Geoffrey Bolton. It’s true I’ve only seen them once before, when Sir Robert brought them to see Selena in Chambers, but I’m quite sure I’m not mistaken.I’m equally sure that their visit was not planned in advance—that they were summoned here by Sir Robert only a few hours ago, as a result of something he received in the post or read in the newspaper this morning. I suppose there may have been something in the financial pages which would provide a reason to convene an urgent directors’ meeting. But is it the real reason or merely a pretext? I strongly suspect, given the similarity of the conditions, that he is trying again to set a trap for the insider dealer, in the same way that he did when Selena was here in the summer. I can’t help feeling that this may be rather dangerous—another attack of food poisoning might have serious consequences.Well, I shall keep as close an eye on the situation as circumstances permit. I have already, I’m afraid, spent more time on observing what is happening at the villa than is entirely consistent with my other obligations: Terry has rung to say that he is arriving this evening, and I haven’t the faintest idea what to give him for supper—we shall probably have to go out somewhere. If he complains, I shall talk meaningfully of pots, kettles, and unfinished bookcases.21st DecemberDo please forgive me if the rest of this letter is somewhat disjointed: there are some rather strange noises coming from the flat next door—if Natasha had not warned me, I should think them very strange indeed—which make it slightly difficult to concentrate.Although it is after ten A.M., I have only just finished breakfast, having risen disgracefully late and with a slight hangover. For this I entirely blame Terry, of whose disgraceful behaviour I am about to give full particulars: really, I don’t know what carpenters are coming to nowadays.He arrived yesterday evening at about seven and readily agreed to go out to dinner rather than eat at the flat. What I had envisaged was a modest meal at one of the cafés in the place; but he persuaded me that we should go instead to a Moroccan restaurant, known to him from previous visits.It was in a narrow side street a few minutes’ walk away, behind the sort of unassuming frontage which in France so often conceals a restaurant of some distinction. Inside, it was quite luxuriously furnished and decorated, in a quasi-Moorish style: thick carpets and silky draperies; divans round low circular tables in alcoves divided by carved wooden screens; brass lamps of the kind one might rub if one hoped to be given three wishes. At the end of the room, a piano and a small dais suggested that later in the evening some form of musical entertainment might be provided.Rather to my alarm, the waiters all greeted Terry like a long-lost brother or nephew: the thing most likely to inspire such fond and enduring memories seemed to me to be a habit of reckless overtipping, which I feared I would be expected to emulate.It also occurred to me that this might well be the same restaurant in which Sir Robert was taken ill in the summer. I decided not to risk the moules marinières.I refrained throughout the meal from any mention of bookcases. Terry was in an odd sort of mood, one moment excessively animated, the next despondent, so that I was reluctant to say anything which might depress his spirits. Besides, on the first evening of his holiday, I felt it would be unkind to reproach him. On the other hand, I thought it no more than polite to enquire about his plans for the refurbishment of Benjamin’s flat.“Oh,” he said vaguely, “I’m thinking fin de siècle. Aubrey Beardsley and winters in Egypt and so on—you know the kind of thing.”But I was dismayed to observe that he spoke listlessly, with none of the enthusiasm which he used to show for such matters. I began to wonder if there were such a thing as carpenters’ block, like writers’ block, causing carpenters to be incapable of getting on with any work, and, if so, how long it might last.So preoccupied was I with this question that I almost failed to notice the entry into the restaurant of the very people in whom I was so deeply interested—that is to say, Sir Robert Renfrew and his two codirectors, accompanied, of course, by Miss Tavistock.For some reason—perhaps Lady Renfrew had objected to spending an evening hearing them talk business—they had evidently decided, like ourselves, to eat out. It was clear that Sir Robert was a known and valued customer: the headwaiter greeted him by name and deferentially conducted him with his guests to the table in the alcove next to ours.I now felt no doubt at all that this was indeed the restaurant where he had suffered his attack of food poisoning last summer. It seemed likely, however, from the fact of his returning there, that he did not hold the restaurant to blame for it—presumably he is well aware that on that occasion he had not actually eaten anything. I even began to wonder, indeed, whether he himself suspected that one of his codirectors had had some hand in the business and was staging one of those reenactments of the crime which I believe are popular in detective fiction. I thought that if so he was being extremely foolhardy.The new arrivals took no particular notice of Terry and myself. There was no reason why they should—apart from Sir Robert’s unfortunate collision with Terry a few months ago, which we all hope he has entirely forgotten, none of them had met either of us before. And since Terry was gossiping away with one of the waiters in fluent though ungrammatical French, they probably did not even realise that we were English.In these circumstances I found that I was able—as of course you know, I would not dream of deliberate eavesdropping, but these carved screens do give an illusion of privacy and they were making no effort to lower their voices—that I was unable to avoid hearing a substantial part of their conversation. Moreover, when we had finished our main course Terry went off to the kitchen to say hello to the chef, who he said was an old friend of his, leaving me with nothing to distract me from it.I gathered that Sir Robert had suddenly decided that morning that the time was ripe to proceed with a major acquisition which the Bank had for some time been considering on behalf of a client; he had summoned his fellow directors to Cannes with a view to taking action before the Christmas holiday. If I had known which company they were talking about, I might have managed to persuade myself that there would be nothing improper in having a modest flutter on it: but they all discreetly referred to it as “the target company,” rather than by name. Indeed, it appeared that before their arrival here neither Albany nor Bolton had known which company was to be the subject of discussion.“If you don’t mind my saying so, Chairman,” said Albany, sounding decidedly peevish, “it’s a pity you didn’t feel able to tell us before we left London which target you had in mind. We’d have found it helpful to check what we had on file about it—at least, I know I would.”“Ah well,” said Bolton, in his pronounced Lancashire accent, “I dare say we’ve looked at this one often enough to know pretty well what’s what.”“It’s a question of security,” said Sir Robert. “Once you start mentioning names on the telephone, you might as well make a public broadcast and have done with it.”Still, it must have been a little disconcerting for them, like being at school and having an unexpected exam—particularly for Albany, who evidently remembered almost nothing about the company under discussion. His rival, on the other hand, despite the lack of preparation, seemed to have all the relevant details at his fingertips.Becoming, as a result of this, increasingly illhumoured, Albany rather forgot himself. He began making remarks to Bolton which were close to being openly offensive, most inadequately disguised as the kind of jovial banter acceptable between friends and colleagues. For example, after Bolton had asked some question about the meaning of something on the menu: “I say, Bolton, old chap, don’t you find it a bit of a bore not knowing any French? Why don’t you go on one of those courses?“Nowt wrong with plain, old-fashioned English, in my opinion. It were good enough for old Bill Shakespeare, weren’t it? And he were a great writer—or so they tell me.”“So most educated people seem to think. But I suppose they didn’t go in for literature much at that college of yours at—where was it? Sorry, I always forget—Birmingham, was it?”“It were Worcester—bit southwest of Birmingham. Oh aye, there were a few lads there that studied poetry and such, but I wanted summat that would help me make a bit of brass.”Even without the possibility of anyone being poisoned, I could hardly imagine, in such an atmosphere, that any of them was having a very agreeable evening. It must have been rather a relief to them when the lights, already low, were dimmed still further, the pianist took his place at the piano and the patron stepped forward to tell us that we were to have the inestimable privilege of hearing la belle Zingara, who had just returned to Cannes after her acclaimed tour of European capitals.Whether Madame Zingara had any just claim to be described as beautiful it was impossible to tell: one had an impression merely of a tall, slim woman with a mass of dark hair and wearing more than enough makeup to conceal any defects of complexion. She was swathed in some kind of white, gauzy material, draped round her in the manner of a sari or toga. Inasmuch as it completely covered her from neck to ankle, one might have considered it a rather decorous garment; but the undulating movement of her hips and shoulders somehow made it look as if it were continuously in the process of slithering to the ground, so that the actual effect was rather the reverse.When she began to sing, however, her voice was unexpectedly attractive: a husky contralto with a touch of harshness, not of course in the class of Lenya or Mercouri but more than acceptable for delivering the same songs. So we had “Surabaya Johnny” and “Banal” and several others of that sort, mainly on the theme of overtrusting women deserted by heartless lovers. These were interspersed with songs of a rather different type, all unfamiliar to me and in the highest degree improper: from what I understood of them, which was rather less than half, I was extremely glad of my inability to understand the rest. The audience, however, seemed to find them amusing: they were greeted with much laughter and enthusiastic applause.I felt a certain uneasiness, while all this was going on, about those in the adjoining alcove. The conditions were rather worryingly suitable, if one really believed Albany or Bolton to be capable of such a thing, for putting something unwholesome in someone’s coffee cup. Still, there was nothing I could do about it. So far as I could tell, nothing untoward occurred save for Bolton suffering a fit of coughing and Albany, with manifestly insincere solicitude, thumping him on the back.Madame Zingara concluded her performance with “Pirate Jenny” from The Threepenny Opera. She moved round the restaurant as she sang it, hips and shoulders still undulating, white muslin still apparently precarious, pausing at each table to hold out a large copper bowl. Having not quite expected this, I wondered anxiously what sort of sum it would be proper to contribute.By chance, or so I imagined, my table was the last in her circuit, so that I had ample time to reflect on this question and to curse Terry for staying gossiping in the kitchen—I assumed that as an habitué he would have known how much was expected.I finally settled on fifty francs as an amount which could be neither insultingly small nor ludicrously generous and by the time she reached my table had a note of that value ready to place in the copper bowl. She waved it away, however, saying, “Ah, on ne prend pas de l’argent d’un joli garçon comme vous.”I looked at her in surprise and considerable embarrassment. She smiled and fluttered her long, mascaraed eyelashes. Under the heavy makeup I now recognised the features of our truant carpenter.I was speechless. Fortunately, because anything I said would have been profane; it would also have been in English and audible at the next table.“Mais comment ça arrive que vous trouvez tout seul?” the shameless creature continued.I collected myself sufficiently to reply in the same language that I was with a friend: and that if he did not shortly rejoin me I should be extremely cross.By the time he returned to our table, dressed in the rather more conventional garments he had arrived in, Sir Robert’s party had left, apparently without mishap.My intention had been, once we were back at the flat, to speak to him severely about his disgraceful conduct and then to retire early to bed. Somehow or other, this was not at all what happened. I had scarcely begun my lecture when he said, “Don’t scold me, Desmond, I only did it to cheer myself up a bit. I’m feeling so miserable,” and I could not bring myself to go on.He has a broken heart, poor boy, having formed a deep attachment which he believed reciprocal and found was not. “Cast aside,” he said, “like the proverbial soiled glove. Too banal for words, isn’t it?”We sat up until nearly three in the morning, drinking Benjamin’s brandy and playing Marlene Dietrich songs while I tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade him that from time to time in human history the same thing has happened to other people and they have sometimes managed to get over it. I even suggested the possibility of a reconciliation with the object of his attachment; but I was given to understand that things had been said which made this out of the question. If the object were to walk barefoot across France to beg for Terry’s forgiveness and present him with a train of forty snow-white camels, laden with gold and diamonds and boxes of marrons glacés, such forgiveness would not now be forthcoming. I am not feeling optimistic about our bookcases.The noises from the flat next door are becoming quite alarming—I can hardly imagine an ailment worth such an agonising cure as Natasha seems to provide.So far I have not seen anyone on the roof terrace this morning, nor much expected to, having gathered last night that the morning’s work at the villa would consist mainly of Geoffrey Bolton making telephone calls. There has been, however, a certain amount of interesting activity in the place.Shortly before ten o’clock, just as I was beginning my breakfast, Edgar Albany came into the place and walked across in the direction of the slightly disreputable bar I mentioned. Unfortunately, the bar itself is out of view from here, being on the same side of the place as this building: I am thus unable to tell you for certain whether he actually went into it and if so whether he stayed there.My guess, though, is that he did, because almost immediately afterwards Miss Tavistock also came into the place and sat down in the café on the opposite side, from which she would certainly be able to see all the comings and goings through the door of the slightly disreputable bar.Miss Tavistock does not strike me as the sort of woman who would normally fritter her time away in a café on a morning when there is work to be done. I am now as certain as can be that Sir Robert is repeating the experiment he tried when Selena was here: Miss Tavistock is acting on instructions to keep Albany under surveillance while he is outside the villa.But if I am right about that, I also think that he has somehow eluded her—perhaps inadvertently, with no idea that she was keeping watch on him. A few minutes ago, after she had been in the café for about half an hour, she made a telephone call. After that she paid her bill and left, presumably to return to the villa. I think that Albany must have come out of the bar and done something, such as hailing a taxi, which prevented her from following. The telephone call would have been to Sir Robert to report and ask further instructions.I am becoming quite seriously concerned about what is happening next door. I have just seen Natasha driving away in her car, and yet the cries of pain continue unabated—indeed, they almost sound like cries for help. I do not wish to do anything to offend her after she has been so kind, but it does seem irresponsible of her to have left her patient on his own in such a condition as he appears to be in.I have decided to run down to the postbox, so that this catches the eleven o’clock post and has some chance of reaching you before Christmas Day, and on my way back to knock discreetly at her door. If there is no answer and the cries are still continuing, I shall climb across onto her balcony, which adjoins this one, and find out what is going on.In haste, therefore, and hoping that you and your aunt both have a splendid Christmas and an excellent New Year,Yours,

 West SussexChristmas EveDear Ragwort,At least, I suppose that by now one should say it is Christmas Eve—the time is about two o’clock in the morning. A few minutes ago I was woken up by Daphne, tapping at my window and calling out to me to let her in. Since my window is about twenty feet above ground level, I found this disconcerting.Having turned on my bedside lamp, I have decided that it was only the rowan tree that was tapping and only the wind in its branches that was wailing to be let in; but I see no immediate prospect of going back to sleep.My room is at the back of the house and the window accordingly looks onto the graveyard; but I have slept here many times and never felt the slightest uneasiness about it. If I do now, it must be on account of the thought that Isabella is buried there: there was no one there before that I actually knew. Not, of course, that I actually knew Isabella. And not, of course, that I do feel any uneasiness about it: I am a rational, educated woman, brought up in the second half of the twentieth century—I do not imagine that the dead can climb up out of their graves.I find myself becoming increasingly anxious about Maurice. This is partly because of something he said to me on the day that I last wrote to you. We met at the letter box, where he too was posting a letter, and he thanked me for the advice I had given him earlier in the day. He had found it, he said, most helpful and had acted on it. Since then I have spent many hours trying to work out what advice he thinks I have given him and what he may have done or not done in supposed pursuance of it.But the real reason, I suppose, for my anxiety is that Daphne keeps saying that something terrible is going to happen to him: she says that in the Book his name still has a shadow over it. I do not for a moment believe, of course, in any of this superstitious nonsense—at least, not by daylight; but in the small hours of a winter night, with the wind howling and the rowan tree tapping so persistently against the window, one seems to see things rather differently.I should explain—in view of my last letter, you may find it slightly surprising—that Daphne and I are now bosom friends. That is to say, she seems to think we are; and I do not feel that I know her well enough to dispute it.Once more, I am at a loss to explain how this state of affairs has come about. Two days after our previous encounter, that is to say at lunchtime on Monday, I was again sitting in the Newt and Ninepence, assisting my aunt in the manner previously indicated and reflecting on the advice given me that morning by Madame Louisa: she had recommended the day as one for decisive action and I was trying to decide what to be decisive about. I observed the approach of Daphne too late to make my escape; but her motives proved to be peaceable.“Look,” she said, “I’m sorry if I went over the top a bit the other day, but I just felt I had to tell you how I felt. It’s terribly important not to keep things bottled up, isn’t it? Aunt Isabella always said you couldn’t be friends with someone unless you were completely honest with each other.”It occurred to me that this might explain why her aunt had had few friends; but it was somehow the kind of sentiment with which it is difficult to express disagreement. I said that I was sure she was right, and offered to buy her a drink. After some urging, she accepted, and conversation ensued.Chiefly concerned with Maurice: his saintly character, his towering intellect, his kindness to Daphne, Daphne’s corresponding devotion and concern. He was now, she said, her only source of spiritual guidance.“And the wonderful thing is, you see, that he’s never tried to make me do anything I wasn’t sure was right. He’s never tried to persuade me to come to church or take communion or anything like that. Because he understands how terrible it would be for me if he wanted me to do that when I couldn’t be sure it was right. I don’t know if it would be a breach of faith. I’m the Custodian, you see—I’m the Custodian of the Book.”She spoke as of a position too eminent to require further explanation, as one might say “I am the Lord Chief Justice” or “I am the Governor of the Bank of England” if one happened to be either of those things. When I enquired what it entailed, however, she became wide-eyed and anxious.“Oh,” she said, “I can’t tell you about that. People are always wanting me to explain it, and I can’t—I can’t tell anyone. Something terrible would happen—the Custodian must keep faith with the Book.”I assured her that I wished to know nothing which she thought it improper to tell me.“Anyway, that’s why sometimes I—I know things. About what’s going to happen to people. And that’s why I get so frightened of something terrible happening to Maurice.”It was at this stage that she told me about the shadow over his name in the Book, obviously portending some disaster. As to the nature of the catastrophe which threatens him, however—whether it is illness, or accident, or some act of human malice—she seemed to have no clear idea, and spoke as if envisaging sometimes one possibility, sometimes another.“He doesn’t take proper care of himself, you see. He’s old and ill and needs looking after, and he just won’t accept it. When I try to take care of him properly he gets cross with me, so I have to find ways of doing it without him knowing. And he trusts everyone—he doesn’t realise that people can be evil and dangerous.”I said that I could imagine no reason for anyone to do him any deliberate harm.“Oh, you don’t know either, in spite of being such a clever lawyer and all that, you’ve no idea how wicked and horrible people can be. There was a horrible person who used to come down here in the summer, and I knew he was treacherous and dangerous, but Maurice just wouldn’t believe me. And then he did something terrible that hurt Maurice very much, but he didn’t come here anymore and I thought the shadow would go away. But it hasn’t, and I don’t know what to do.”I could do no more than murmur sympathetically and buy her another drink. Our conversation concluded with her saying how glad she was we were friends and could be completely honest with each other.The tapping on my window is more insistent than ever, and the wailing outside more pitiful, as if the rowan tree were trying to come in out of the cold to share the comfort of my bedroom. If it really is the rowan tree. Which it obviously is. If there were any doubt, I could go to the window and open it to make sure, but I somehow feel disinclined to do that. And since there can be no doubt, there is no point.I know very well what’s wrong with me—it’s all because of what happened yesterday.Yesterday was the day appointed by my aunt’s investment syndicate, in token of their gratitude for my advice on capital gains tax, to take me out for lunch. The syndicate consists, as you may recall, of Maurice, Griselda and Reg herself; Ricky Farnham, having given the advice which led to the capital gains, was also considered entitled to be one of the party. The restaurant chosen for the honour of our patronage was in Bramber, some twenty minutes’ drive away, reputed to be the most haunted village in England.In the Middle Ages, I am told, Bramber was a place of some importance. It now consists chiefly of a single street of knapped flint cottages, with low doorways and diamond-paned windows, and the ruins of a mediaeval castle, whose one remaining wall rises into the sky above the village like a huge black tombstone.Most notable among its ghosts are the two children of Walter de Braose, the lord of the manor in the thirteenth century, who were taken away by King John as hostages for their father’s loyalty and never seen again. Having died, according to legend, of starvation, every St. Thomas’s Eve they go through the village, tapping on windows to ask for food. This was the account of events given to us by Maurice, who is a noted authority on Sussex folklore, and its truth is therefore beyond question.I could not help regarding him, after what Daphne had said, with even greater anxiety than before; but he appeared to me to be looking a little better than when I first saw him, though he had the first signs of a cold and was rather worried that he might not be in good voice for the midnight service tonight. (I hope this is not my fault—it’s nearly a week since the walk to the George and Dragon.) Still, he seemed to be enjoying himself, and to have an excellent appetite.After we had eaten, and were sitting in the oak-panelled bar round a large open fire, drinking coffee and liqueurs, he told us further stories, all of unimpeachable veracity, about witches and ghosts and dragons and giants, now or formerly to be found in this part of the world. But even though it was St. Thomas’s Eve, and we lingered there until after darkness had fallen, we did not see any ghosts in Bramber.On our return to my aunt’s house, our entry through the front door was slightly impeded by a heap of little parcels which had been pushed through the letter box, somewhat to the detriment of their fancy wrapping. With them was a note addressed to Reg:Dear Reg—didn’t want to come round and interrupt while you were all enjoying yourselves, but I know Maurice needs to rest tomorrow to be ready for the midnight service, and I wasn’t sure if I would see any of you in time to give you your presents. So I thought the best thing was to put them through the door while you were out at lunch—hope this is all right.Love and greetings,
 DaphneThere was a bottle of expensive scent for Reg; a pair of leather gardening gloves for Griselda; a half bottle of whiskey for Ricky; a paperback guide to criminal procedure for me, given, according to the inscription on the flyleaf, in the hope of helping me to even greater success in my profession. Maurice’s present was a cardigan, hand-knitted in Aran wool, which in the process had lost something of its attractive creamy colour. It is not for me to speak disparagingly of Daphne’s skill at knitting, since it is undoubtedly greater than mine, but not much.“Oh dear, poor Daphne,” said Griselda.My aunt suggested that she should telephone Daphne and invite her to join us for a mince pie and a glass of wine, so that we could all thank her for our presents. The suggestion seemed to be made, and was received, without overwhelming enthusiasm. To my surprise, however, it was Maurice who actually said, “Oh no, please don’t do that, Reg—do let’s have an afternoon without her. I’ll call in at the Rectory on my way home and tell her how pleased we all were.”“Well,” said Reg, evidently still suffering pangs of conscience, “she is coming to lunch here on Christmas Day, of course. I suppose—”“If Daphne comes, we can’t play Scrabble,” said Maurice. “I haven’t played Scrabble for ages.”The wistfulness of this last remark was allowed to prevail over my aunt’s scruples. We laid out the Scrabble board on a table in the drawing room, dealt out the letters and settled down to argue amiably about such questions as whether EM is a permissible word. It seemed to me, however, that our enjoyment was slightly clouded by a feeling of having been less kind than we should have been to Daphne.I happened to be facing the window which looks out onto the street. Although by now it was quite dark outside, we had left the curtains undrawn so that passersby could enjoy our elegantly lit Christmas tree. After we had been playing for some time, I happened to look up from the board and saw a face, pale and large eyed, pressed against the glass. Under the influence of the stories that Maurice had been telling, I took it at first for a ghost or hobgoblin at the very least; but after a moment or so I saw that it was Daphne.None of the others had noticed her. The natural and friendly thing to do, I suppose, would have been to draw her presence to the attention of my aunt, who would no doubt have gone to the door and invited her in. For some reason, however, I hesitated about doing this; I looked away, uncertain whether she knew I had seen her. When I looked again she was no longer there, and it seemed too late to say anything.All of which is plainly the explanation for my uneasy dreams and superstitious imaginings.

Well, she can’t and that’s all there is to it.It looks as if Maurice is also unable to sleep—the downstairs lights were still on at the Vicarage and I could see him moving about in the kitchen. I wonder whether he did call on Daphne, as he said he would, on his way home last night, or whether by that time he would have thought it too late—everyone stayed to supper, of course, but they all went home quite soon afterwards.I shall now make a serious effort to go to sleep again, and resume this in the morning.8:30 A.M.Your letter has arrived, causing considerable alarm.

 West SussexChristmas EveDear Ragwort,At least, I suppose that by now one should say it is Christmas Eve—the time is about two o’clock in the morning. A few minutes ago I was woken up by Daphne, tapping at my window and calling out to me to let her in. Since my window is about twenty feet above ground level, I found this disconcerting.Having turned on my bedside lamp, I have decided that it was only the rowan tree that was tapping and only the wind in its branches that was wailing to be let in; but I see no immediate prospect of going back to sleep.My room is at the back of the house and the window accordingly looks onto the graveyard; but I have slept here many times and never felt the slightest uneasiness about it. If I do now, it must be on account of the thought that Isabella is buried there: there was no one there before that I actually knew. Not, of course, that I actually knew Isabella. And not, of course, that I do feel any uneasiness about it: I am a rational, educated woman, brought up in the second half of the twentieth century—I do not imagine that the dead can climb up out of their graves.I find myself becoming increasingly anxious about Maurice. This is partly because of something he said to me on the day that I last wrote to you. We met at the letter box, where he too was posting a letter, and he thanked me for the advice I had given him earlier in the day. He had found it, he said, most helpful and had acted on it. Since then I have spent many hours trying to work out what advice he thinks I have given him and what he may have done or not done in supposed pursuance of it.But the real reason, I suppose, for my anxiety is that Daphne keeps saying that something terrible is going to happen to him: she says that in the Book his name still has a shadow over it. I do not for a moment believe, of course, in any of this superstitious nonsense—at least, not by daylight; but in the small hours of a winter night, with the wind howling and the rowan tree tapping so persistently against the window, one seems to see things rather differently.I should explain—in view of my last letter, you may find it slightly surprising—that Daphne and I are now bosom friends. That is to say, she seems to think we are; and I do not feel that I know her well enough to dispute it.Once more, I am at a loss to explain how this state of affairs has come about. Two days after our previous encounter, that is to say at lunchtime on Monday, I was again sitting in the Newt and Ninepence, assisting my aunt in the manner previously indicated and reflecting on the advice given me that morning by Madame Louisa: she had recommended the day as one for decisive action and I was trying to decide what to be decisive about. I observed the approach of Daphne too late to make my escape; but her motives proved to be peaceable.“Look,” she said, “I’m sorry if I went over the top a bit the other day, but I just felt I had to tell you how I felt. It’s terribly important not to keep things bottled up, isn’t it? Aunt Isabella always said you couldn’t be friends with someone unless you were completely honest with each other.”It occurred to me that this might explain why her aunt had had few friends; but it was somehow the kind of sentiment with which it is difficult to express disagreement. I said that I was sure she was right, and offered to buy her a drink. After some urging, she accepted, and conversation ensued.Chiefly concerned with Maurice: his saintly character, his towering intellect, his kindness to Daphne, Daphne’s corresponding devotion and concern. He was now, she said, her only source of spiritual guidance.“And the wonderful thing is, you see, that he’s never tried to make me do anything I wasn’t sure was right. He’s never tried to persuade me to come to church or take communion or anything like that. Because he understands how terrible it would be for me if he wanted me to do that when I couldn’t be sure it was right. I don’t know if it would be a breach of faith. I’m the Custodian, you see—I’m the Custodian of the Book.”She spoke as of a position too eminent to require further explanation, as one might say “I am the Lord Chief Justice” or “I am the Governor of the Bank of England” if one happened to be either of those things. When I enquired what it entailed, however, she became wide-eyed and anxious.“Oh,” she said, “I can’t tell you about that. People are always wanting me to explain it, and I can’t—I can’t tell anyone. Something terrible would happen—the Custodian must keep faith with the Book.”I assured her that I wished to know nothing which she thought it improper to tell me.“Anyway, that’s why sometimes I—I know things. About what’s going to happen to people. And that’s why I get so frightened of something terrible happening to Maurice.”It was at this stage that she told me about the shadow over his name in the Book, obviously portending some disaster. As to the nature of the catastrophe which threatens him, however—whether it is illness, or accident, or some act of human malice—she seemed to have no clear idea, and spoke as if envisaging sometimes one possibility, sometimes another.“He doesn’t take proper care of himself, you see. He’s old and ill and needs looking after, and he just won’t accept it. When I try to take care of him properly he gets cross with me, so I have to find ways of doing it without him knowing. And he trusts everyone—he doesn’t realise that people can be evil and dangerous.”I said that I could imagine no reason for anyone to do him any deliberate harm.“Oh, you don’t know either, in spite of being such a clever lawyer and all that, you’ve no idea how wicked and horrible people can be. There was a horrible person who used to come down here in the summer, and I knew he was treacherous and dangerous, but Maurice just wouldn’t believe me. And then he did something terrible that hurt Maurice very much, but he didn’t come here anymore and I thought the shadow would go away. But it hasn’t, and I don’t know what to do.”I could do no more than murmur sympathetically and buy her another drink. Our conversation concluded with her saying how glad she was we were friends and could be completely honest with each other.The tapping on my window is more insistent than ever, and the wailing outside more pitiful, as if the rowan tree were trying to come in out of the cold to share the comfort of my bedroom. If it really is the rowan tree. Which it obviously is. If there were any doubt, I could go to the window and open it to make sure, but I somehow feel disinclined to do that. And since there can be no doubt, there is no point.I know very well what’s wrong with me—it’s all because of what happened yesterday.Yesterday was the day appointed by my aunt’s investment syndicate, in token of their gratitude for my advice on capital gains tax, to take me out for lunch. The syndicate consists, as you may recall, of Maurice, Griselda and Reg herself; Ricky Farnham, having given the advice which led to the capital gains, was also considered entitled to be one of the party. The restaurant chosen for the honour of our patronage was in Bramber, some twenty minutes’ drive away, reputed to be the most haunted village in England.In the Middle Ages, I am told, Bramber was a place of some importance. It now consists chiefly of a single street of knapped flint cottages, with low doorways and diamond-paned windows, and the ruins of a mediaeval castle, whose one remaining wall rises into the sky above the village like a huge black tombstone.Most notable among its ghosts are the two children of Walter de Braose, the lord of the manor in the thirteenth century, who were taken away by King John as hostages for their father’s loyalty and never seen again. Having died, according to legend, of starvation, every St. Thomas’s Eve they go through the village, tapping on windows to ask for food. This was the account of events given to us by Maurice, who is a noted authority on Sussex folklore, and its truth is therefore beyond question.I could not help regarding him, after what Daphne had said, with even greater anxiety than before; but he appeared to me to be looking a little better than when I first saw him, though he had the first signs of a cold and was rather worried that he might not be in good voice for the midnight service tonight. (I hope this is not my fault—it’s nearly a week since the walk to the George and Dragon.) Still, he seemed to be enjoying himself, and to have an excellent appetite.After we had eaten, and were sitting in the oak-panelled bar round a large open fire, drinking coffee and liqueurs, he told us further stories, all of unimpeachable veracity, about witches and ghosts and dragons and giants, now or formerly to be found in this part of the world. But even though it was St. Thomas’s Eve, and we lingered there until after darkness had fallen, we did not see any ghosts in Bramber.On our return to my aunt’s house, our entry through the front door was slightly impeded by a heap of little parcels which had been pushed through the letter box, somewhat to the detriment of their fancy wrapping. With them was a note addressed to Reg:Dear Reg—didn’t want to come round and interrupt while you were all enjoying yourselves, but I know Maurice needs to rest tomorrow to be ready for the midnight service, and I wasn’t sure if I would see any of you in time to give you your presents. So I thought the best thing was to put them through the door while you were out at lunch—hope this is all right.Love and greetings,
 DaphneThere was a bottle of expensive scent for Reg; a pair of leather gardening gloves for Griselda; a half bottle of whiskey for Ricky; a paperback guide to criminal procedure for me, given, according to the inscription on the flyleaf, in the hope of helping me to even greater success in my profession. Maurice’s present was a cardigan, hand-knitted in Aran wool, which in the process had lost something of its attractive creamy colour. It is not for me to speak disparagingly of Daphne’s skill at knitting, since it is undoubtedly greater than mine, but not much.“Oh dear, poor Daphne,” said Griselda.My aunt suggested that she should telephone Daphne and invite her to join us for a mince pie and a glass of wine, so that we could all thank her for our presents. The suggestion seemed to be made, and was received, without overwhelming enthusiasm. To my surprise, however, it was Maurice who actually said, “Oh no, please don’t do that, Reg—do let’s have an afternoon without her. I’ll call in at the Rectory on my way home and tell her how pleased we all were.”“Well,” said Reg, evidently still suffering pangs of conscience, “she is coming to lunch here on Christmas Day, of course. I suppose—”“If Daphne comes, we can’t play Scrabble,” said Maurice. “I haven’t played Scrabble for ages.”The wistfulness of this last remark was allowed to prevail over my aunt’s scruples. We laid out the Scrabble board on a table in the drawing room, dealt out the letters and settled down to argue amiably about such questions as whether EM is a permissible word. It seemed to me, however, that our enjoyment was slightly clouded by a feeling of having been less kind than we should have been to Daphne.I happened to be facing the window which looks out onto the street. Although by now it was quite dark outside, we had left the curtains undrawn so that passersby could enjoy our elegantly lit Christmas tree. After we had been playing for some time, I happened to look up from the board and saw a face, pale and large eyed, pressed against the glass. Under the influence of the stories that Maurice had been telling, I took it at first for a ghost or hobgoblin at the very least; but after a moment or so I saw that it was Daphne.None of the others had noticed her. The natural and friendly thing to do, I suppose, would have been to draw her presence to the attention of my aunt, who would no doubt have gone to the door and invited her in. For some reason, however, I hesitated about doing this; I looked away, uncertain whether she knew I had seen her. When I looked again she was no longer there, and it seemed too late to say anything.All of which is plainly the explanation for my uneasy dreams and superstitious imaginings. Well, I have devised a plan of action to deal with them: I shall light a Gauloise; I shall gather up my courage; and then I shall go to the window and make sure it is only the rowan tree tapping.I have lit a Gauloise.I have gathered up my courage.And I have been to the window.And it is, as I have told you all along, only the rowan tree tapping on it; but it’s bitterly cold outside and the wind is blowing something like a gale—one can’t blame the poor rowan tree for wanting to come in.

 West SussexChristmas DayDear Ragwort,I write in some despondency, more for my own consolation than your entertainment. Maurice is quite ill, seriously enough to be in hospital, though not so close to death’s door, according to my aunt and the doctors, as Daphne seems determined to believe.The first sign we had of anything seriously wrong was yesterday morning. I had returned from posting my letter to you and acquiring, at my aunt’s suggestion, some nice-smelling soap and bath oil for Daphne, and was being rewarded for my efforts with a largish gin and tonic as a prelude to our modest lunch. (Modest, that is to say, by Reg’s standards, not by mine.) Then Daphne arrived, in a state of tears and agitation.Discovering the cause of her distress, though it was immediately clear that it had something to do with Maurice, took some little time. Words and tears poured from her in more or less equal measure, but without actually explaining what was the matter. It eventually appeared, however, that Maurice had called at the Rectory as he said he would, on his way home on the previous evening; shocked to see him still out of doors on such a cold night, Daphne had gone into the kitchen to make him a hot drink, leaving him sitting in the drawing room; when she returned, she found that he had gone—simply left the house without saying good night, or in any other way signifying his intention to depart. Seeing that the lights were now on at the Vicarage, she had run across there and rung the doorbell, intending to ask him what was wrong; but though she rang several times, there was no answer. She had then returned to the Rectory and attempted to telephone him; the telephone remained equally unanswered.Neither Reg nor I could suggest an explanation for behaviour on Maurice’s part so entirely uncharacteristic.“I know sometimes he doesn’t answer the telephone,” said Daphne, sitting on the sofa looking forlorn and liquescent. “When he’s working hard on something very important and has to think a lot about it, he doesn’t answer the telephone or the front door. But he’d only just got home, and he must have known it was me.”In the morning, after, she said, a sleepless night, she renewed her efforts, but Maurice’s telephone and his front doorbell for some time continued to be unanswered. When at last she did obtain a response, it was a distressing one: he leaned out from an upstairs window and shouted to her to go away.”He said he didn’t want to see me,” said Daphne, many times and with many sobs. “He said he didn’t want to see me ever again. He sounded so angry, and I can’t bear it, and I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what I’ve done—if I knew, I could say I was sorry, and it would all be all right, but how can I say I’m sorry when I don’t know what it is?”Please do not imagine that she said this only once, or only twice, or only three times. She repeated the same phrases, with variations of order and emphasis, over and over again, like the heroine of a grand opera delivering the principal aria, and conveyed a similar impression of being willing to go on doing so more or less indefinitely.“Daphne,” said my aunt, after the question “Why is he so angry with me?” had been repeated for the fourteenth or fifteenth time, and voicing a thought which had also occurred to me, but had seemed a little heartless to express, “Daphne dear, don’t you think he may just have been a little irritated by your ringing so often at his doorbell when perhaps he didn’t want to be disturbed? He has to take the midnight service tonight, you know.”“But he must have known it was me,” said Daphne pitifully.“Well, yes—” said my aunt, with a note of dubiety in her voice.“And he must have known it was only because I cared about him, and wanted to make sure he was all right.”“Even so—” said my aunt, causing Daphne to burst into further floods of tears.Although we all knew how unlike him it was to be unkind to anyone, it did not, I think, occur to any of us that his outburst might be a symptom of any physical illness. Reg, I need hardly say, invited Daphne to join us for lunch, and afterwards at long last persuaded her to return home, without making any further attempt to get in touch with Maurice. She would see him, said Reg, in the normal course of events, at lunch here on Christmas Day; by which time, if she did nothing further to remind him of it, he might well entirely have forgotten his vexation with her.Thereafter the day passed peacefully until about half past ten, when Griselda and Ricky came round to be fortified for the midnight service with mince pies and mulled wine. When we had all consumed enough of these to be sure that our strength did not fail us, we trooped out into the churchyard and walked across to St. Ethel’s, which was looking very much at its best, ethereal and almost luminous in the bright moonlight.We saw Maurice for a few moments on the way into church, but with no time for any proper conversation. We were all, I think, rather worried about how ill he looked—grey and gaunt and hollow eyed, much worse than he had the day before. There was a medicinal sort of smell about him, as of mothballs—I suppose from whatever he was taking for his cold—and he was trembling slightly as if he had a fever.“Oh Maurice,” said my aunt, “you ought to be at home in bed.”As a seasoned churchgoer, you will not wish me to describe the service in detail, save to the extent that it appeared in any way to depart from what is usual on such occasions. I would ask you to remember that St. Ethel’s, though small, is considered by the discerning to be an unusually fine example of early Norman architecture; that my aunt had been responsible for the decorations and the arrangement of the crib, which were therefore unusually charming; and that the choir, having practised the carols, I am reliably informed, with exceptional assiduity for the past six weeks, may be presumed to have sung them with unusual sweetness. Subject to that, I think I am safe in saying that everything proceeded in a perfectly usual manner until Maurice, in his long white robe, entered the pulpit to address the congregation.He began by telling us that we had gathered to celebrate the birth of a child—a divine child, who would bring new hope to the world and salvation for our sins. This seemed to be thought an unexceptionable opening, and in accordance with what the congregation expected. From there he went on to speak of various references in pre-Christian writers which had from time to time been interpreted as prophecies of that event, with particular reference to the fourth Eclogue of Virgil, commonly known on that account as the Messianic Eclogue. This too the congregation seemed to find not unreasonable, no doubt feeling that an event which has been foretold by prophets must be of much greater significance than one merely recorded by historians.“But we must beware of false prophets,” said Maurice, with great solemnity, and the congregation seemed to become slightly uneasy.He paused for a few moments, as if puzzled at what he had said and uncertain how to proceed further, but then began to explain, with wonderful lucidity, the historical background to the composition of the fourth Eclogue, establishing conclusively that it was intended to refer to the prospective first child of the marriage between Mark Anthony and Octavia, rather than to the Christian Saviour. It was a very learned explanation, but perhaps a little on the long side for so late an hour on an evening of festivity: I became aware of the rustlings and shufflings which are the sign of a dissatisfied audience.Then he warned us again, with even greater fervour than before, to beware of false prophets, and the uneasiness became palpable. Ricky, in a rather too audible whisper, asked if my aunt thought that Maurice “had taken a drop too much.” She shook her head and shushed him, but looked more anxious than ever.It evidently occurred to Maurice at this stage that he might be thought to be accusing Virgil of being a false prophet, and the idea seemed to cause him much agitation and anguish. He had not, he said, at all intended to suggest that Virgil was a false prophet. There were false prophets and we must beware of them, but Virgil was not of their number—Virgil was a true prophet. If he had said anything to imply otherwise, then he was very sorry for it, and must ask us to excuse him for misleading us, as he had been rather ill. Virgil was a true prophet, and a great poet, perhaps the greatest who had ever lived, and we must never doubt that he was divinely inspired.It became clear to me that this was not at all a usual way for the Vicar to address his congregation—not, at any rate, at St. Ethel’s. Several people had half risen from their places as if contemplating some kind of intervention.And then, his arms raised high and spread wide in their loose white sleeves, Maurice began to read aloud from the fourth Eclogue—or rather to recite, since it was clear that he knew the lines by heart. His voice now lost all trace of hoarseness and the syllables rolled out clear and resonant into the church, filling the vaulted roof with their thunderous grandeur and reaching their majestic climax in the lines “Aspice, venturo laetentur ut omnia saeclo.There was for a few moments an absolute silence. He stepped down from the pulpit; stood for a moment facing us, looking down the aisle towards the main doorway; seemed to stagger; and lay prostrate, his arms still spread wide, looking like a huge white bird that has been shot down in flight across the sky.Someone must have done something very efficient; an ambulance arrived in less than five minutes. To make sure that Maurice was promptly attended to when he arrived at the hospital, my aunt went with him in the ambulance.It was the sound of the siren, I suppose, that made Daphne aware of something being wrong. Just as the ambulance was leaving she came running across the churchyard from the Rectory, already distraught and wild-eyed, wanting to know what had happened, and saying “It’s Maurice, isn’t it? Something awful has happened to Maurice.” It would have been prudent, or so it seemed to me, to describe what had occurred in the least dramatic terms possible. Others, however, evidently did not share this opinion: she received a number of answers calculated to confirm her in the impression that Maurice was not merely ill but dying, if not already dead. These, as you may imagine, did not have a soothing effect.Since she was wearing only her nightdress and a slightly moth-eaten woollen cardigan, it seemed likely that if she stayed out for long the next catastrophe would be her catching pneumonia. Eventually, however, Griselda and I persuaded her to come back here and wait for news and have some hot soup to warm her up.We did our best to calm her down, but with little success. She continued to moan and sob and pummel herself with her fists, saying how terrible it was that Maurice was ill and she was not with him. She seemed to feel that someone should have sent for her to go with him in the ambulance: we ought to have known, she said, that she would want to be with him.Reg arrived home a little after one in the morning. Ricky had driven to the hospital to collect her, stopping on the way to pick up various things that he thought Maurice might need, such as a pair of pyjamas. Ricky being Ricky, the package of essentials had included a bottle of whiskey.By now almost convinced by Daphne’s lamentations that Maurice was on the point of death, Griselda and I were disproportionately relieved to hear that the doctors did not agree. Although they were not quite sure what exactly was wrong with him—they said that it was probably some kind of virus—they thought that it would have been relatively harmless if his general health had been better. The real problem, they said, was that he was desperately malnourished: poor Maurice, I told you that he looked like a skeleton. They had attached him to some sort of plastic tube, designed to save him the trouble of eating, and hoped that he would soon show signs of improvement.It was still some considerable time before any of us actually went to bed. Daphne apparently assumed that all other arrangements for Christmas Day were automatically cancelled and that my aunt would drive her over to the hospital first thing in the morning: when Reg explained to her that it would not be right to cancel a lunch for twelve guests on account of the illness of one, and that therefore she did not intend to visit Maurice again until the afternoon, there ensued a longer and more tearful argument than I have energy to relate. At long last, however, Daphne went home, with Griselda and me to escort her on her way and each other on the way back.On my return, I found that Reg had poured herself a generous measure of whiskey and had laid out the cards for a rather complicated form of patience. These things indicated to me, on the basis of past experience, that there was some element in the situation which she found problematic.“I think I ought to tell you,” she said, having poured me a similar quantity of whiskey, “that I am not going to drive Daphne to the hospital tomorrow. Neither in the morning nor in the afternoon nor at any other time. Maurice doesn’t want to see her—I don’t know why, but he doesn’t. And the doctors say he mustn’t be upset.”I asked, rather foolishly, whether she was sure that she had understood him correctly.“Oh yes,” she said. “Quite sure, he said it several times. He was conscious, you see, by the time I left him, and able to talk a little, though he couldn’t manage much more than a whisper. And one of the things he kept saying was, ‘Please, Reg, don’t let Daphne come here.’ So of course I said I wouldn’t. But I didn’t want to tell Daphne about it tonight, when she’s already in such a state.”I asked what else he had said.“He kept saying,” said Reg, “that he wished he could see Derek again.”She resumed her game of patience and I went rather anxiously to bed.In the morning, however, she was in a much more cheerful mood, having already telephoned the hospital to find out how Maurice was: they had told her that he had spent a comfortable night and was as well as could be expected. Quite what this means I am never entirely sure—after all, there are circumstances in which one might be expected to be very ill indeed—but my aunt seemed sufficiently reassured to hum “Good King Wenceslas” while making the toast.By nine o’clock Daphne was again on the doorstep, in what I now regard as her customary state of agitation: there were things at the Vicarage of which Maurice would have urgent need; only she knew what they were and where to find them; she had no way of getting in; she didn’t know what to do. When my aunt admitted to having Maurice’s keys, nothing would satisfy her but an immediate expedition.Preparations for lunch were accordingly suspended while we all went across to the Vicarage to look for Maurice’s favourite dressing gown and Maurice’s favourite slippers. Not to speak of his favourite soap, his favourite toothpaste, his favourite cough mixture and his favourite paper handkerchiefs. It was essential, you understand, that each item taken should be the favourite in its category. Thus, instead of being content with the pair of blue slippers beside his bed, we were obliged to spend half an hour searching for a pair of green slippers which she believed him to be more deeply attached to and which turned out to be at the very back of the bathroom cupboard. Similarly with most of the other items, none of which seemed actually to be where Daphne had thought it was.By the time we had found everything she considered immediately indispensable to his well-being and packed it safely in the boot of Reg’s car, the arrangements for lunch were a little behind schedule.Griselda, in the meantime, had ridden over to the hospital on her bicycle, laden with books and bottles of burgundy, and also, after stopping on the way to give Christmas greetings to Mrs. Tyrrell, with large quantities of gingerbread and homemade chocolate cake. She had found him, however, in no condition to enjoy either food or conversation—still attached to the tube and not allowed to eat anything.Of lunch I shall say nothing, though it would have been in other circumstances a meal to be remembered in song and legend. Not only Maurice’s illness, however, but the presence of Daphne, unkempt and red-eyed, still wearing her moth-eaten cardigan, silent and palpably resentful, detracted from the gaiety of the proceedings.It was only when lunch was over and all the guests had left that my aunt told Daphne that Maurice did not want to see her.It had of course been foreseeable that she would be upset. What I had not foreseen—though perhaps my aunt had—was that she would still insist, if possible with even greater vehemence, on being taken to the hospital.Reg said that she would not take her. Daphne, in tears and rage, said that she must, she had promised. Reg denied having promised; Daphne continued to assert that she had.“Daphne,” said my aunt eventually, “there is no point in arguing. Maurice is my friend and he is ill and he does not want to see you—if I had given you such a promise, I should not dream of keeping it. Julia will give you some tea.”After which she walked briskly out to her car and drove away, leaving Daphne, although all too briefly, lost for words.For half an hour or so I remained the vicarious object of furious and tearful reproaches, all on the theme that Daphne had never thought my aunt the kind of person who would break her promise. I made tea, however, as it seemed to me I had been instructed to do, and after she had drunk some of it she became slightly calmer and asked me to lend her the money for a taxi. I told her, untruthfully and with a degree of moral cowardice I am ashamed to admit to, that I had run out of money. She said she did not believe me. Becoming slightly braver, I said that even if I had the money I would not lend it to her. She said that I was a horrible person and she hated me and would never speak to me again. After this, I am afraid to my enormous relief, she marched out of the house.Since it is Christmas Day, there are of course no trains or buses and I doubt whether anyone else will lend her the money for a taxi. It seems reasonable to hope, therefore, that she will not find any means of reaching the hospital today; what happens tomorrow is another question.Christmas eveningI am no longer despondent. Perhaps it is not, after all, so unfestive a Christmas as I thought. Last night, it seems, after I had gone to bed, my aunt sat up finishing her game of patience and considering whether she should try to get in touch with Derek Arkwright. Though she didn’t have the name or address of his friend in London, she still had in her address book the telephone number which Maurice had given her last summer, for the place where he and Derek were staying in the south of France. She had no idea whether anyone would be there who knew where Derek was, or indeed knew him at all, at any rate by the same name that she did; but she decided, having brought her patience to a successful conclusion, that at least the attempt should be made.She rang this morning, before I was even awake. To her astonishment it was Derek himself who answered; to her even greater astonishment he said he would come at once.“He wasn’t sure what flight he could get on Christmas Day, but he said he hoped he could be in Worthing by five and he would go straight to the hospital. I didn’t dare tell Maurice when I saw him this afternoon, in case he didn’t come after all. Poor Maurice, he was looking so fragile, I almost didn’t believe he’d get better. I just sat by his bed and did some sewing and wished that Derek would come. And then he did. And Maurice said, ‘Oh, Derek, I’m so sorry,’ and Derek said ‘So I should think, silly old thing,’ and kissed him. So then I thought I’d come home.”And almost straightaway, it seems, Maurice began to get better. When my aunt rang the hospital a few minutes ago, they said he was well enough to be taken off the plastic tube and be given some proper food. Derek’s staying there overnight, of course.We have been having a glass of champagne to celebrate and are feeling quite festive, after all.26th DecemberI hardly know now whether to send this—poor Maurice died early this morning.Julia"|"The Sibyl in Her Grave"|"Sarah Caudwell"

 West SussexChristmas DayDear Ragwort,I write in some despondency, more for my own consolation than your entertainment. Maurice is quite ill, seriously enough to be in hospital, though not so close to death’s door, according to my aunt and the doctors, as Daphne seems determined to believe.The first sign we had of anything seriously wrong was yesterday morning. I had returned from posting my letter to you and acquiring, at my aunt’s suggestion, some nice-smelling soap and bath oil for Daphne, and was being rewarded for my efforts with a largish gin and tonic as a prelude to our modest lunch. (Modest, that is to say, by Reg’s standards, not by mine.) Then Daphne arrived, in a state of tears and agitation.Discovering the cause of her distress, though it was immediately clear that it had something to do with Maurice, took some little time. Words and tears poured from her in more or less equal measure, but without actually explaining what was the matter. It eventually appeared, however, that Maurice had called at the Rectory as he said he would, on his way home on the previous evening; shocked to see him still out of doors on such a cold night, Daphne had gone into the kitchen to make him a hot drink, leaving him sitting in the drawing room; when she returned, she found that he had gone—simply left the house without saying good night, or in any other way signifying his intention to depart. Seeing that the lights were now on at the Vicarage, she had run across there and rung the doorbell, intending to ask him what was wrong; but though she rang several times, there was no answer. She had then returned to the Rectory and attempted to telephone him; the telephone remained equally unanswered.Neither Reg nor I could suggest an explanation for behaviour on Maurice’s part so entirely uncharacteristic.“I know sometimes he doesn’t answer the telephone,” said Daphne, sitting on the sofa looking forlorn and liquescent. “When he’s working hard on something very important and has to think a lot about it, he doesn’t answer the telephone or the front door. But he’d only just got home, and he must have known it was me.”In the morning, after, she said, a sleepless night, she renewed her efforts, but Maurice’s telephone and his front doorbell for some time continued to be unanswered. When at last she did obtain a response, it was a distressing one: he leaned out from an upstairs window and shouted to her to go away.”He said he didn’t want to see me,” said Daphne, many times and with many sobs. “He said he didn’t want to see me ever again. He sounded so angry, and I can’t bear it, and I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what I’ve done—if I knew, I could say I was sorry, and it would all be all right, but how can I say I’m sorry when I don’t know what it is?”Please do not imagine that she said this only once, or only twice, or only three times. She repeated the same phrases, with variations of order and emphasis, over and over again, like the heroine of a grand opera delivering the principal aria, and conveyed a similar impression of being willing to go on doing so more or less indefinitely.“Daphne,” said my aunt, after the question “Why is he so angry with me?” had been repeated for the fourteenth or fifteenth time, and voicing a thought which had also occurred to me, but had seemed a little heartless to express, “Daphne dear, don’t you think he may just have been a little irritated by your ringing so often at his doorbell when perhaps he didn’t want to be disturbed? He has to take the midnight service tonight, you know.”“But he must have known it was me,” said Daphne pitifully.“Well, yes—” said my aunt, with a note of dubiety in her voice.“And he must have known it was only because I cared about him, and wanted to make sure he was all right.”“Even so—” said my aunt, causing Daphne to burst into further floods of tears.Although we all knew how unlike him it was to be unkind to anyone, it did not, I think, occur to any of us that his outburst might be a symptom of any physical illness. Reg, I need hardly say, invited Daphne to join us for lunch, and afterwards at long last persuaded her to return home, without making any further attempt to get in touch with Maurice. She would see him, said Reg, in the normal course of events, at lunch here on Christmas Day; by which time, if she did nothing further to remind him of it, he might well entirely have forgotten his vexation with her.Thereafter the day passed peacefully until about half past ten, when Griselda and Ricky came round to be fortified for the midnight service with mince pies and mulled wine. When we had all consumed enough of these to be sure that our strength did not fail us, we trooped out into the churchyard and walked across to St. Ethel’s, which was looking very much at its best, ethereal and almost luminous in the bright moonlight.We saw Maurice for a few moments on the way into church, but with no time for any proper conversation. We were all, I think, rather worried about how ill he looked—grey and gaunt and hollow eyed, much worse than he had the day before. There was a medicinal sort of smell about him, as of mothballs—I suppose from whatever he was taking for his cold—and he was trembling slightly as if he had a fever.“Oh Maurice,” said my aunt, “you ought to be at home in bed.”As a seasoned churchgoer, you will not wish me to describe the service in detail, save to the extent that it appeared in any way to depart from what is usual on such occasions. I would ask you to remember that St. Ethel’s, though small, is considered by the discerning to be an unusually fine example of early Norman architecture; that my aunt had been responsible for the decorations and the arrangement of the crib, which were therefore unusually charming; and that the choir, having practised the carols, I am reliably informed, with exceptional assiduity for the past six weeks, may be presumed to have sung them with unusual sweetness. Subject to that, I think I am safe in saying that everything proceeded in a perfectly usual manner until Maurice, in his long white robe, entered the pulpit to address the congregation.He began by telling us that we had gathered to celebrate the birth of a child—a divine child, who would bring new hope to the world and salvation for our sins. This seemed to be thought an unexceptionable opening, and in accordance with what the congregation expected. From there he went on to speak of various references in pre-Christian writers which had from time to time been interpreted as prophecies of that event, with particular reference to the fourth Eclogue of Virgil, commonly known on that account as the Messianic Eclogue. This too the congregation seemed to find not unreasonable, no doubt feeling that an event which has been foretold by prophets must be of much greater significance than one merely recorded by historians.“But we must beware of false prophets,” said Maurice, with great solemnity, and the congregation seemed to become slightly uneasy.He paused for a few moments, as if puzzled at what he had said and uncertain how to proceed further, but then began to explain, with wonderful lucidity, the historical background to the composition of the fourth Eclogue, establishing conclusively that it was intended to refer to the prospective first child of the marriage between Mark Anthony and Octavia, rather than to the Christian Saviour. It was a very learned explanation, but perhaps a little on the long side for so late an hour on an evening of festivity: I became aware of the rustlings and shufflings which are the sign of a dissatisfied audience.Then he warned us again, with even greater fervour than before, to beware of false prophets, and the uneasiness became palpable. Ricky, in a rather too audible whisper, asked if my aunt thought that Maurice “had taken a drop too much.” She shook her head and shushed him, but looked more anxious than ever.It evidently occurred to Maurice at this stage that he might be thought to be accusing Virgil of being a false prophet, and the idea seemed to cause him much agitation and anguish. He had not, he said, at all intended to suggest that Virgil was a false prophet. There were false prophets and we must beware of them, but Virgil was not of their number—Virgil was a true prophet. If he had said anything to imply otherwise, then he was very sorry for it, and must ask us to excuse him for misleading us, as he had been rather ill. Virgil was a true prophet, and a great poet, perhaps the greatest who had ever lived, and we must never doubt that he was divinely inspired.It became clear to me that this was not at all a usual way for the Vicar to address his congregation—not, at any rate, at St. Ethel’s. Several people had half risen from their places as if contemplating some kind of intervention.And then, his arms raised high and spread wide in their loose white sleeves, Maurice began to read aloud from the fourth Eclogue—or rather to recite, since it was clear that he knew the lines by heart. His voice now lost all trace of hoarseness and the syllables rolled out clear and resonant into the church, filling the vaulted roof with their thunderous grandeur and reaching their majestic climax in the lines “Aspice, venturo laetentur ut omnia saeclo.There was for a few moments an absolute silence. He stepped down from the pulpit; stood for a moment facing us, looking down the aisle towards the main doorway; seemed to stagger; and lay prostrate, his arms still spread wide, looking like a huge white bird that has been shot down in flight across the sky.Someone must have done something very efficient; an ambulance arrived in less than five minutes. To make sure that Maurice was promptly attended to when he arrived at the hospital, my aunt went with him in the ambulance.It was the sound of the siren, I suppose, that made Daphne aware of something being wrong. Just as the ambulance was leaving she came running across the churchyard from the Rectory, already distraught and wild-eyed, wanting to know what had happened, and saying “It’s Maurice, isn’t it? Something awful has happened to Maurice.” It would have been prudent, or so it seemed to me, to describe what had occurred in the least dramatic terms possible. Others, however, evidently did not share this opinion: she received a number of answers calculated to confirm her in the impression that Maurice was not merely ill but dying, if not already dead. These, as you may imagine, did not have a soothing effect.Since she was wearing only her nightdress and a slightly moth-eaten woollen cardigan, it seemed likely that if she stayed out for long the next catastrophe would be her catching pneumonia. Eventually, however, Griselda and I persuaded her to come back here and wait for news and have some hot soup to warm her up.We did our best to calm her down, but with little success. She continued to moan and sob and pummel herself with her fists, saying how terrible it was that Maurice was ill and she was not with him. She seemed to feel that someone should have sent for her to go with him in the ambulance: we ought to have known, she said, that she would want to be with him.Reg arrived home a little after one in the morning. Ricky had driven to the hospital to collect her, stopping on the way to pick up various things that he thought Maurice might need, such as a pair of pyjamas. Ricky being Ricky, the package of essentials had included a bottle of whiskey.By now almost convinced by Daphne’s lamentations that Maurice was on the point of death, Griselda and I were disproportionately relieved to hear that the doctors did not agree. Although they were not quite sure what exactly was wrong with him—they said that it was probably some kind of virus—they thought that it would have been relatively harmless if his general health had been better. The real problem, they said, was that he was desperately malnourished: poor Maurice, I told you that he looked like a skeleton. They had attached him to some sort of plastic tube, designed to save him the trouble of eating, and hoped that he would soon show signs of improvement.It was still some considerable time before any of us actually went to bed. Daphne apparently assumed that all other arrangements for Christmas Day were automatically cancelled and that my aunt would drive her over to the hospital first thing in the morning: when Reg explained to her that it would not be right to cancel a lunch for twelve guests on account of the illness of one, and that therefore she did not intend to visit Maurice again until the afternoon, there ensued a longer and more tearful argument than I have energy to relate. At long last, however, Daphne went home, with Griselda and me to escort her on her way and each other on the way back.On my return, I found that Reg had poured herself a generous measure of whiskey and had laid out the cards for a rather complicated form of patience. These things indicated to me, on the basis of past experience, that there was some element in the situation which she found problematic.“I think I ought to tell you,” she said, having poured me a similar quantity of whiskey, “that I am not going to drive Daphne to the hospital tomorrow. Neither in the morning nor in the afternoon nor at any other time. Maurice doesn’t want to see her—I don’t know why, but he doesn’t. And the doctors say he mustn’t be upset.”I asked, rather foolishly, whether she was sure that she had understood him correctly.“Oh yes,” she said. “Quite sure, he said it several times. He was conscious, you see, by the time I left him, and able to talk a little, though he couldn’t manage much more than a whisper. And one of the things he kept saying was, ‘Please, Reg, don’t let Daphne come here.’ So of course I said I wouldn’t. But I didn’t want to tell Daphne about it tonight, when she’s already in such a state.”I asked what else he had said.“He kept saying,” said Reg, “that he wished he could see Derek again.”She resumed her game of patience and I went rather anxiously to bed.In the morning, however, she was in a much more cheerful mood, having already telephoned the hospital to find out how Maurice was: they had told her that he had spent a comfortable night and was as well as could be expected. Quite what this means I am never entirely sure—after all, there are circumstances in which one might be expected to be very ill indeed—but my aunt seemed sufficiently reassured to hum “Good King Wenceslas” while making the toast.By nine o’clock Daphne was again on the doorstep, in what I now regard as her customary state of agitation: there were things at the Vicarage of which Maurice would have urgent need; only she knew what they were and where to find them; she had no way of getting in; she didn’t know what to do. When my aunt admitted to having Maurice’s keys, nothing would satisfy her but an immediate expedition.Preparations for lunch were accordingly suspended while we all went across to the Vicarage to look for Maurice’s favourite dressing gown and Maurice’s favourite slippers. Not to speak of his favourite soap, his favourite toothpaste, his favourite cough mixture and his favourite paper handkerchiefs. It was essential, you understand, that each item taken should be the favourite in its category. Thus, instead of being content with the pair of blue slippers beside his bed, we were obliged to spend half an hour searching for a pair of green slippers which she believed him to be more deeply attached to and which turned out to be at the very back of the bathroom cupboard. Similarly with most of the other items, none of which seemed actually to be where Daphne had thought it was.By the time we had found everything she considered immediately indispensable to his well-being and packed it safely in the boot of Reg’s car, the arrangements for lunch were a little behind schedule.Griselda, in the meantime, had ridden over to the hospital on her bicycle, laden with books and bottles of burgundy, and also, after stopping on the way to give Christmas greetings to Mrs. Tyrrell, with large quantities of gingerbread and homemade chocolate cake. She had found him, however, in no condition to enjoy either food or conversation—still attached to the tube and not allowed to eat anything.Of lunch I shall say nothing, though it would have been in other circumstances a meal to be remembered in song and legend. Not only Maurice’s illness, however, but the presence of Daphne, unkempt and red-eyed, still wearing her moth-eaten cardigan, silent and palpably resentful, detracted from the gaiety of the proceedings.It was only when lunch was over and all the guests had left that my aunt told Daphne that Maurice did not want to see her.It had of course been foreseeable that she would be upset. What I had not foreseen—though perhaps my aunt had—was that she would still insist, if possible with even greater vehemence, on being taken to the hospital.Reg said that she would not take her. Daphne, in tears and rage, said that she must, she had promised. Reg denied having promised; Daphne continued to assert that she had.“Daphne,” said my aunt eventually, “there is no point in arguing. Maurice is my friend and he is ill and he does not want to see you—if I had given you such a promise, I should not dream of keeping it. Julia will give you some tea.”After which she walked briskly out to her car and drove away, leaving Daphne, although all too briefly, lost for words.For half an hour or so I remained the vicarious object of furious and tearful reproaches, all on the theme that Daphne had never thought my aunt the kind of person who would break her promise. I made tea, however, as it seemed to me I had been instructed to do, and after she had drunk some of it she became slightly calmer and asked me to lend her the money for a taxi. I told her, untruthfully and with a degree of moral cowardice I am ashamed to admit to, that I had run out of money. She said she did not believe me.

They had attached him to some sort of plastic tube, designed to save him the trouble of eating, and hoped that he would soon show signs of improvement.It was still some considerable time before any of us actually went to bed. Daphne apparently assumed that all other arrangements for Christmas Day were automatically cancelled and that my aunt would drive her over to the hospital first thing in the morning: when Reg explained to her that it would not be right to cancel a lunch for twelve guests on account of the illness of one, and that therefore she did not intend to visit Maurice again until the afternoon, there ensued a longer and more tearful argument than I have energy to relate. At long last, however, Daphne went home, with Griselda and me to escort her on her way and each other on the way back.On my return, I found that Reg had poured herself a generous measure of whiskey and had laid out the cards for a rather complicated form of patience. These things indicated to me, on the basis of past experience, that there was some element in the situation which she found problematic.“I think I ought to tell you,” she said, having poured me a similar quantity of whiskey, “that I am not going to drive Daphne to the hospital tomorrow. Neither in the morning nor in the afternoon nor at any other time. Maurice doesn’t want to see her—I don’t know why, but he doesn’t. And the doctors say he mustn’t be upset.”I asked, rather foolishly, whether she was sure that she had understood him correctly.“Oh yes,” she said. “Quite sure, he said it several times. He was conscious, you see, by the time I left him, and able to talk a little, though he couldn’t manage much more than a whisper. And one of the things he kept saying was, ‘Please, Reg, don’t let Daphne come here.’ So of course I said I wouldn’t. But I didn’t want to tell Daphne about it tonight, when she’s already in such a state.”I asked what else he had said.“He kept saying,” said Reg, “that he wished he could see Derek again.”She resumed her game of patience and I went rather anxiously to bed.In the morning, however, she was in a much more cheerful mood, having already telephoned the hospital to find out how Maurice was: they had told her that he had spent a comfortable night and was as well as could be expected. Quite what this means I am never entirely sure—after all, there are circumstances in which one might be expected to be very ill indeed—but my aunt seemed sufficiently reassured to hum “Good King Wenceslas” while making the toast.By nine o’clock Daphne was again on the doorstep, in what I now regard as her customary state of agitation: there were things at the Vicarage of which Maurice would have urgent need; only she knew what they were and where to find them; she had no way of getting in; she didn’t know what to do. When my aunt admitted to having Maurice’s keys, nothing would satisfy her but an immediate expedition.Preparations for lunch were accordingly suspended while we all went across to the Vicarage to look for Maurice’s favourite dressing gown and Maurice’s favourite slippers. Not to speak of his favourite soap, his favourite toothpaste, his favourite cough mixture and his favourite paper handkerchiefs. It was essential, you understand, that each item taken should be the favourite in its category. Thus, instead of being content with the pair of blue slippers beside his bed, we were obliged to spend half an hour searching for a pair of green slippers which she believed him to be more deeply attached to and which turned out to be at the very back of the bathroom cupboard. Similarly with most of the other items, none of which seemed actually to be where Daphne had thought it was.By the time we had found everything she considered immediately indispensable to his well-being and packed it safely in the boot of Reg’s car, the arrangements for lunch were a little behind schedule.Griselda, in the meantime, had ridden over to the hospital on her bicycle, laden with books and bottles of burgundy, and also, after stopping on the way to give Christmas greetings to Mrs. Tyrrell, with large quantities of gingerbread and homemade chocolate cake. She had found him, however, in no condition to enjoy either food or conversation—still attached to the tube and not allowed to eat anything.Of lunch I shall say nothing, though it would have been in other circumstances a meal to be remembered in song and legend. Not only Maurice’s illness, however, but the presence of Daphne, unkempt and red-eyed, still wearing her moth-eaten cardigan, silent and palpably resentful, detracted from the gaiety of the proceedings.It was only when lunch was over and all the guests had left that my aunt told Daphne that Maurice did not want to see her.It had of course been foreseeable that she would be upset. What I had not foreseen—though perhaps my aunt had—was that she would still insist, if possible with even greater vehemence, on being taken to the hospital.Reg said that she would not take her. Daphne, in tears and rage, said that she must, she had promised. Reg denied having promised; Daphne continued to assert that she had.“Daphne,” said my aunt eventually, “there is no point in arguing. Maurice is my friend and he is ill and he does not want to see you—if I had given you such a promise, I should not dream of keeping it. Julia will give you some tea.”After which she walked briskly out to her car and drove away, leaving Daphne, although all too briefly, lost for words.For half an hour or so I remained the vicarious object of furious and tearful reproaches, all on the theme that Daphne had never thought my aunt the kind of person who would break her promise. I made tea, however, as it seemed to me I had been instructed to do, and after she had drunk some of it she became slightly calmer and asked me to lend her the money for a taxi. I told her, untruthfully and with a degree of moral cowardice I am ashamed to admit to, that I had run out of money. She said she did not believe me. Becoming slightly braver, I said that even if I had the money I would not lend it to her. She said that I was a horrible person and she hated me and would never speak to me again. After this, I am afraid to my enormous relief, she marched out of the house.Since it is Christmas Day, there are of course no trains or buses and I doubt whether anyone else will lend her the money for a taxi. It seems reasonable to hope, therefore, that she will not find any means of reaching the hospital today; what happens tomorrow is another question.Christmas eveningI am no longer despondent. Perhaps it is not, after all, so unfestive a Christmas as I thought. Last night, it seems, after I had gone to bed, my aunt sat up finishing her game of patience and considering whether she should try to get in touch with Derek Arkwright. Though she didn’t have the name or address of his friend in London, she still had in her address book the telephone number which Maurice had given her last summer, for the place where he and Derek were staying in the south of France. She had no idea whether anyone would be there who knew where Derek was, or indeed knew him at all, at any rate by the same name that she did; but she decided, having brought her patience to a successful conclusion, that at least the attempt should be made.She rang this morning, before I was even awake. To her astonishment it was Derek himself who answered; to her even greater astonishment he said he would come at once.“He wasn’t sure what flight he could get on Christmas Day, but he said he hoped he could be in Worthing by five and he would go straight to the hospital. I didn’t dare tell Maurice when I saw him this afternoon, in case he didn’t come after all. Poor Maurice, he was looking so fragile, I almost didn’t believe he’d get better. I just sat by his bed and did some sewing and wished that Derek would come. And then he did. And Maurice said, ‘Oh, Derek, I’m so sorry,’ and Derek said ‘So I should think, silly old thing,’ and kissed him. So then I thought I’d come home.”And almost straightaway, it seems, Maurice began to get better. When my aunt rang the hospital a few minutes ago, they said he was well enough to be taken off the plastic tube and be given some proper food. Derek’s staying there overnight, of course.We have been having a glass of champagne to celebrate and are feeling quite festive, after all.26th DecemberI hardly know now whether to send this—poor Maurice died early this morning.Julia"|"The Sibyl in Her Grave"|"Sarah Caudwell"

 West SussexChristmas DayDear Ragwort,I write in some despondency, more for my own consolation than your entertainment. Maurice is quite ill, seriously enough to be in hospital, though not so close to death’s door, according to my aunt and the doctors, as Daphne seems determined to believe.The first sign we had of anything seriously wrong was yesterday morning. I had returned from posting my letter to you and acquiring, at my aunt’s suggestion, some nice-smelling soap and bath oil for Daphne, and was being rewarded for my efforts with a largish gin and tonic as a prelude to our modest lunch. (Modest, that is to say, by Reg’s standards, not by mine.) Then Daphne arrived, in a state of tears and agitation.Discovering the cause of her distress, though it was immediately clear that it had something to do with Maurice, took some little time. Words and tears poured from her in more or less equal measure, but without actually explaining what was the matter. It eventually appeared, however, that Maurice had called at the Rectory as he said he would, on his way home on the previous evening; shocked to see him still out of doors on such a cold night, Daphne had gone into the kitchen to make him a hot drink, leaving him sitting in the drawing room; when she returned, she found that he had gone—simply left the house without saying good night, or in any other way signifying his intention to depart. Seeing that the lights were now on at the Vicarage, she had run across there and rung the doorbell, intending to ask him what was wrong; but though she rang several times, there was no answer. She had then returned to the Rectory and attempted to telephone him; the telephone remained equally unanswered.Neither Reg nor I could suggest an explanation for behaviour on Maurice’s part so entirely uncharacteristic.“I know sometimes he doesn’t answer the telephone,” said Daphne, sitting on the sofa looking forlorn and liquescent. “When he’s working hard on something very important and has to think a lot about it, he doesn’t answer the telephone or the front door. But he’d only just got home, and he must have known it was me.”In the morning, after, she said, a sleepless night, she renewed her efforts, but Maurice’s telephone and his front doorbell for some time continued to be unanswered. When at last she did obtain a response, it was a distressing one: he leaned out from an upstairs window and shouted to her to go away.”He said he didn’t want to see me,” said Daphne, many times and with many sobs. “He said he didn’t want to see me ever again. He sounded so angry, and I can’t bear it, and I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what I’ve done—if I knew, I could say I was sorry, and it would all be all right, but how can I say I’m sorry when I don’t know what it is?”Please do not imagine that she said this only once, or only twice, or only three times. She repeated the same phrases, with variations of order and emphasis, over and over again, like the heroine of a grand opera delivering the principal aria, and conveyed a similar impression of being willing to go on doing so more or less indefinitely.“Daphne,” said my aunt, after the question “Why is he so angry with me?” had been repeated for the fourteenth or fifteenth time, and voicing a thought which had also occurred to me, but had seemed a little heartless to express, “Daphne dear, don’t you think he may just have been a little irritated by your ringing so often at his doorbell when perhaps he didn’t want to be disturbed? He has to take the midnight service tonight, you know.”“But he must have known it was me,” said Daphne pitifully.“Well, yes—” said my aunt, with a note of dubiety in her voice.“And he must have known it was only because I cared about him, and wanted to make sure he was all right.”“Even so—” said my aunt, causing Daphne to burst into further floods of tears.Although we all knew how unlike him it was to be unkind to anyone, it did not, I think, occur to any of us that his outburst might be a symptom of any physical illness. Reg, I need hardly say, invited Daphne to join us for lunch, and afterwards at long last persuaded her to return home, without making any further attempt to get in touch with Maurice. She would see him, said Reg, in the normal course of events, at lunch here on Christmas Day; by which time, if she did nothing further to remind him of it, he might well entirely have forgotten his vexation with her.Thereafter the day passed peacefully until about half past ten, when Griselda and Ricky came round to be fortified for the midnight service with mince pies and mulled wine. When we had all consumed enough of these to be sure that our strength did not fail us, we trooped out into the churchyard and walked across to St. Ethel’s, which was looking very much at its best, ethereal and almost luminous in the bright moonlight.We saw Maurice for a few moments on the way into church, but with no time for any proper conversation. We were all, I think, rather worried about how ill he looked—grey and gaunt and hollow eyed, much worse than he had the day before. There was a medicinal sort of smell about him, as of mothballs—I suppose from whatever he was taking for his cold—and he was trembling slightly as if he had a fever.“Oh Maurice,” said my aunt, “you ought to be at home in bed.”As a seasoned churchgoer, you will not wish me to describe the service in detail, save to the extent that it appeared in any way to depart from what is usual on such occasions. I would ask you to remember that St. Ethel’s, though small, is considered by the discerning to be an unusually fine example of early Norman architecture; that my aunt had been responsible for the decorations and the arrangement of the crib, which were therefore unusually charming; and that the choir, having practised the carols, I am reliably informed, with exceptional assiduity for the past six weeks, may be presumed to have sung them with unusual sweetness. Subject to that, I think I am safe in saying that everything proceeded in a perfectly usual manner until Maurice, in his long white robe, entered the pulpit to address the congregation.He began by telling us that we had gathered to celebrate the birth of a child—a divine child, who would bring new hope to the world and salvation for our sins. This seemed to be thought an unexceptionable opening, and in accordance with what the congregation expected. From there he went on to speak of various references in pre-Christian writers which had from time to time been interpreted as prophecies of that event, with particular reference to the fourth Eclogue of Virgil, commonly known on that account as the Messianic Eclogue. This too the congregation seemed to find not unreasonable, no doubt feeling that an event which has been foretold by prophets must be of much greater significance than one merely recorded by historians.“But we must beware of false prophets,” said Maurice, with great solemnity, and the congregation seemed to become slightly uneasy.He paused for a few moments, as if puzzled at what he had said and uncertain how to proceed further, but then began to explain, with wonderful lucidity, the historical background to the composition of the fourth Eclogue, establishing conclusively that it was intended to refer to the prospective first child of the marriage between Mark Anthony and Octavia, rather than to the Christian Saviour. It was a very learned explanation, but perhaps a little on the long side for so late an hour on an evening of festivity: I became aware of the rustlings and shufflings which are the sign of a dissatisfied audience.Then he warned us again, with even greater fervour than before, to beware of false prophets, and the uneasiness became palpable. Ricky, in a rather too audible whisper, asked if my aunt thought that Maurice “had taken a drop too much.” She shook her head and shushed him, but looked more anxious than ever.It evidently occurred to Maurice at this stage that he might be thought to be accusing Virgil of being a false prophet, and the idea seemed to cause him much agitation and anguish. He had not, he said, at all intended to suggest that Virgil was a false prophet. There were false prophets and we must beware of them, but Virgil was not of their number—Virgil was a true prophet. If he had said anything to imply otherwise, then he was very sorry for it, and must ask us to excuse him for misleading us, as he had been rather ill. Virgil was a true prophet, and a great poet, perhaps the greatest who had ever lived, and we must never doubt that he was divinely inspired.It became clear to me that this was not at all a usual way for the Vicar to address his congregation—not, at any rate, at St. Ethel’s. Several people had half risen from their places as if contemplating some kind of intervention.And then, his arms raised high and spread wide in their loose white sleeves, Maurice began to read aloud from the fourth Eclogue—or rather to recite, since it was clear that he knew the lines by heart. His voice now lost all trace of hoarseness and the syllables rolled out clear and resonant into the church, filling the vaulted roof with their thunderous grandeur and reaching their majestic climax in the lines “Aspice, venturo laetentur ut omnia saeclo.There was for a few moments an absolute silence. He stepped down from the pulpit; stood for a moment facing us, looking down the aisle towards the main doorway; seemed to stagger; and lay prostrate, his arms still spread wide, looking like a huge white bird that has been shot down in flight across the sky.Someone must have done something very efficient; an ambulance arrived in less than five minutes. To make sure that Maurice was promptly attended to when he arrived at the hospital, my aunt went with him in the ambulance.It was the sound of the siren, I suppose, that made Daphne aware of something being wrong. Just as the ambulance was leaving she came running across the churchyard from the Rectory, already distraught and wild-eyed, wanting to know what had happened, and saying “It’s Maurice, isn’t it? Something awful has happened to Maurice.” It would have been prudent, or so it seemed to me, to describe what had occurred in the least dramatic terms possible. Others, however, evidently did not share this opinion: she received a number of answers calculated to confirm her in the impression that Maurice was not merely ill but dying, if not already dead. These, as you may imagine, did not have a soothing effect.Since she was wearing only her nightdress and a slightly moth-eaten woollen cardigan, it seemed likely that if she stayed out for long the next catastrophe would be her catching pneumonia. Eventually, however, Griselda and I persuaded her to come back here and wait for news and have some hot soup to warm her up.We did our best to calm her down, but with little success. She continued to moan and sob and pummel herself with her fists, saying how terrible it was that Maurice was ill and she was not with him. She seemed to feel that someone should have sent for her to go with him in the ambulance: we ought to have known, she said, that she would want to be with him.Reg arrived home a little after one in the morning. Ricky had driven to the hospital to collect her, stopping on the way to pick up various things that he thought Maurice might need, such as a pair of pyjamas. Ricky being Ricky, the package of essentials had included a bottle of whiskey.By now almost convinced by Daphne’s lamentations that Maurice was on the point of death, Griselda and I were disproportionately relieved to hear that the doctors did not agree. Although they were not quite sure what exactly was wrong with him—they said that it was probably some kind of virus—they thought that it would have been relatively harmless if his general health had been better. The real problem, they said, was that he was desperately malnourished: poor Maurice, I told you that he looked like a skeleton. They had attached him to some sort of plastic tube, designed to save him the trouble of eating, and hoped that he would soon show signs of improvement.It was still some considerable time before any of us actually went to bed.

Mr. Albany, I gather, has the misfortune to suffer from a problem of that sort, and on the morning after his arrival in Cannes found himself in urgent need of treatment.

Their efforts had been thwarted, however, by the absurd obstinacy of one of their clients—Cantrip’s according to Ragwort, Ragwort’s according to Cantrip. This meant, among other unhappy consequences, that they were unable to linger over lunch: they had to be back in court at two o’clock."|"The Sibyl in Her Grave"|"Sarah Caudwell"
00:00|midnight|"Christmas EveDear Daphne,It may seem unkind, some may even think ungrateful, but I am going to kill you. You have left me with—No, it would not be true to say that I have no choice. The alternative would be to kill myself. That indeed was my intention when I prepared the poison—it was for myself, not you, that I chose hemlock. I would not have chosen it for you.It was one of the plants that Reg and Griselda rescued from the physic garden at the Rectory. About a week after my Virgil frontispiece disappeared I went out late at night and dug it up by the roots: I had read in some learned journal or other an article about the death of Socrates, which mentioned that the root is the most poisonous part. The writer was a scholar of considerable eminence—I am sure that he can be relied on. I ground it up into a powder and prepared a decoction in the way he described. I had begun by meaning to take the poison straightaway, but found when I had made it that I felt better and no longer wanted to. I put it in a bottle with an airtight stopper and hid it away in a cupboard in my bedroom, taking great comfort from the thought that it was there if I needed it.But please understand that even then it was your presence, not Derek’s absence, which had made my life seem insupportable. By the time I knew him, you had already begun to make me feel a little desperate; you brought me presents that I did not want and you could not afford; you insisted on doing things for me which I would much rather have done for myself; you praised me in immoderate and embarrassing terms for qualities I do not have and achievements of which you are no judge. In return, you seemed to feel entitled to make demands on my time and emotional energy more absolute and more implacable than a newborn baby could reasonably make of its mother. Where I went, you followed; I could not go out without meeting you; I could not stay at home without your ringing my doorbell. I could see neither how to endure nor how to escape your endless, stifling thereness.And then there was Derek and life became bearable again. Oh, more than bearable—golden, delightful, like the first day of spring after a long, dark winter, full of laughter and pleasure. I thought that I had never been so happy, not even when I was very young. I almost imagined that God was rewarding me for being patient with you and I thought how generous it was, when all I had prayed for was a little peace and privacy.It ended, as you know, very painfully for me, but I have no wish to say any more about that.While I was grieving for my loss and had no strength to protect myself, nor any consciousness of the need to do so, you somehow took possession of my life. It became an accepted thing that I was a kind of invalid and you were looking after me. You cooked and cleaned and shopped for me; you even did something you called looking after my garden—oh, my poor garden. You stayed with me all day from morning till night to make sure that I should not be lonely—though you quickly made other visitors feel that they had stayed inconsiderately long.And I only wanted you to go away.The more I was with you, the more I longed for Derek. I regretted bitterly the letter I had written him; I wished that I’d pretended not to know who had taken the frontispiece. I no longer cared if he was a thief, a liar and insincere in his affection for me; I would rather have lived in a world of absolute illusion than one from which irony and elegance had so utterly perished.I still felt that I ought to try not to hurt your feelings. My life became a series of tactful excuses. I said that I had lost my appetite, rather than admit that the food you cooked disgusted me; that I was too tired to sit up in the evening, rather than let you see how weary I was of your company; that I was too unwell to go out, when the only way I could avoid you was to stay at home and pretend not to hear the doorbell.But when the effort became too much and I began to say things that were unkind, quite seriously unkind, I found that it made no difference. You understood, you said, that it was “the pain talking.” By defining me as ill, you somehow managed to convert everything I said into its opposite; you construed expressions of anger as signs of affection; you translated every plea for solitude into an appeal for company.I became more and more unkind to you—I said things more wounding than I had ever imagined saying to anyone. I told you that your conversation bored me, that your voice set my teeth on edge, that I found you personally distasteful. You cried; but you did not go away—this, it seemed, was your idea of friendship.And something horrible began to happen to me.Though I know all too well that I am often less thoughtful, less generous, less actively kind than I ought to be, I have always believed myself incapable of deliberate cruelty; I found it incomprehensible that anyone could take pleasure in causing pain. But now I began to find that I enjoyed hurting you; when I said something particularly wounding, I no longer felt remorse but a kind of loathsome satisfaction. Sometimes the desire even to hurt you physically was so powerful that I trembled with the effort of resisting it. I no longer found it extraordinary that people might take pleasure in tormenting a child or a helpless animal: I saw that they were merely like me and moved by the same impulse.And if this impulse was simply a part of human nature, I wondered if it was also a part of the nature of God. I had from time to time, of course, the usual doubts about the existence of God, especially as I could never really solve the problem of why, if He exists, He should allow the innocent to suffer; but I had never doubted that if He existed, He was benevolent. But it now occurred to me that perhaps He enjoyed our suffering—that perhaps, indeed, He had created us for that purpose—it would explain everything. I thought that if I believed this I would not wish to go on living.But until last night I never dreamt of killing you.No, that’s not true. I did dream of it, every night, and by means far more painful and violent than poison. But in my waking hours I knew that it was out of the question: you meant well and were doing your best and it was not your fault that I had become a monster. If death was the only solution, I quite accepted that it must be mine, not yours.Until last night.How did you ever come to let me find the frontispiece? You thought, I suppose, that it was quite cleverly hidden in the middle of the pile of old newspapers that you keep to line the floor of the aviary. But did you really imagine, even though only an edge of it was showing, that I would not see and recognise a thing I had so much loved and valued? And why hide it at all? Why not merely destroy it? Surely not because it was beautiful? You knew, I suppose, that it was worth money—was it merely its commercial value that saved it from destruction?Perhaps a psychoanalyst would say that when you left me alone there, in that hideous black drawing room, you subconsciously wanted me to find it. But even so, with what motive? From a sense of guilt, or one of triumph?I hardly understood at first what it meant to find it there. And yet after a few moments I saw how easy it must have been for you—a question merely of leaving my back door unlocked when you put out the rubbish that morning. You would have known how unlikely I was to notice. And that night creeping back into the house in the darkness, while Derek and I were already in bed upstairs—I felt sick at the thought of it—at that moment, it would have been physically impossible for me to speak to you. I took the frontispiece and left, leaving you still busy in your kitchen with whatever nauseating beverage you were preparing for me as yet a further symbol of your devotion and concern.And now I do not see why I should die rather than you. You have taken from me the thing that I held most dear; you have stolen all the hope and pleasure from my life; you have made me hate God. You are destroying me by inches like some horrible disease—why should I not defend myself?By the time you read this you will have eaten, I suppose, at least half of the chocolates I am giving you for Christmas. I think it is safe to tell you that they are poisoned. I spent what remained of the night filling and refilling my fountain pen, as if with ink, from the little bottle of hemlock and carefully discharging it into the base of each chocolate. I did it, I think I may say, quite neatly—I am sure you will not notice anything odd about them.I shall not give them to you today—I should not like anything to happen to spoil the midnight service. I suppose it will be my last—I should like it to go well. I shall take them to you tomorrow morning, before we go to lunch with Reg, and tell you that I want them to be all for you—I know how greedy you are about chocolates and how pleased you will be not to be expected to share them. And when you go home in the evening you will open the box and eat them, as you always do, one after another until they are all gone.I intend to place this letter at the bottom of the box. It may be that you will notice it soon after you have finished the top layer of chocolates and that you will still have strength enough to summon help. I do not think, however, that it will be in time to save you; the Athenians, in whom I have great confidence, considered hemlock a most reliable poison.You may also, of course, have time and strength to denounce me. Even if you do not, I think it unlikely that I can retrieve this letter before it falls into the hands of the police. I suppose that they will put me in prison: but I’m unable to care very much about that—I feel you have made me accustomed to imprisonment.I do not know if you will suffer much. It was suggested in the article I mentioned that death by hemlock might be less painless than Plato would lead us to believe. You cannot expect me to care a great deal about that: I am human; and God, who delights in suffering, has made me in His own, unspeakable image.MauriceHis friends all said that the letter should be burnt."|"The Sibyl in Her Grave"|"Sarah Caudwell"

The story of the burglar was invented by Daphne to make herself an object of sympathy and interest, in particular to Maurice, but by telling it at midnight on the doorstep of the Vicarage, dishevelled and apparently terrified, she lent it a plausibility it might not otherwise have had. The stone-throwing incident was a repetition of the same effect, with a certain amount of embellishment—she threw the stone herself, of course, from inside rather than outside the Rectory garden, and then scraped her head with it until she drew blood.”"|"The Sibyl in Her Grave"|"Sarah Caudwell"
