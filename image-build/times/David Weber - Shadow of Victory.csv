He didn’t tolerate any slackness, but neither was he the type to collect scalps for minor infractions like a little solitaire game at three o’clock in the morning."|"Shadow of Victory"|"David Weber"
"ap ~ 00:00"|"about twelve"|"“Yes, it was,” Adam Šiml agreed a bit more calmly. He’d risen from his own seat, if only to get a better view over the sea of heads between him and the pitch, and now he shook his own head as he settled back down again. “I remember when Petr first started playing with one of the local Sokol teams. He was only a boy—what? about twelve, I think—and he liked gutsy, flashy plays even then. Fortunately, he had the athleticism to pull them off! Did you see that bicycle kick goal he scored against the Ravens last week?”"|"Shadow of Victory"|"David Weber"
00:00|midnight|"Crystal decanters of expensive off-world brandy and whiskeys gleamed behind the wet bar at the far end of the room, and burnished silver carafes of coffee or tea sat before each of the people seated around the table. Soft music played, the whisper of the air conditioning sent tiny, almost imperceptible shivers up the hideously expensive spidersilk drapes which concealed the smart wall when it wasn’t in use, and feet were silent in the thick, deep pile of the midnight-blue carpet."|"Shadow of Victory"|"David Weber"
00:00|midnight|"The sky over Lake Michigan was gorgeous, a flawless vault of midnight spangled with the glittering lights of mankind’s original starscape and so clear of clouds not even the sky glow from the Solarian League’s capital could hide it. The light-spangled flanks of Old Chicago’s towers, rising sheer and tall out of the lake, reflected from its mirror-smooth surface like brighter, far more numerous stars, and the breeze rising from the water was a welcome kiss of coolness through the evening’s residual heat."|"Shadow of Victory"|"David Weber"

Fifteen minutes crept by, and then—"|"Shadow of Victory"|"David Weber"
"ap 03:50"|"three hours and fifty minutes"|"“Astro Control,” he said into the pickup, “This is Captain Gerald Hagan, Solarian League Navy, commanding officer of the light cruiser Ratnik and senior officer of Cruiser Division Four-Two-Three-One. You have not responded to my previous transmission. Be advised that I am in your star system in response to claims that Solarian citizens’ lives and property have been threatened by violent extremists. As such, if you do not respond to this message, I will have no choice but to assume criminal elements are in control of your com facilities and to construe your continued silence as a hostile act. Under those circumstances, I will feel free to use whatever level of force is necessary to compel you to respond, and I will take whatever measures seem appropriate to safeguard Solarian lives and property in the Swallow System. I intend to maintain my present flight profile, which will bring my vessels to a zero-zero orbital insertion around Swallow in approximately—” he glanced at the maneuvering display “—three hours and fifty minutes. If you fail to respond within the next three hours, I will consider Swallow a hostile world, and adopt the appropriate stance—and tactics—for a force entering contested space. I would advise you, most strenuously, to avoid circumstances liable to result in loss of life and destruction of property. Hagan, clear.”"|"Shadow of Victory"|"David Weber"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"“Counting the one that just brought in Admiral Tourville’s messages, I make it eleven,” Adenauer replied, and Michelle grimaced. Any admiral who ever thought she had enough dispatch boats should probably be locked up somewhere before she hurt herself. Still, if Tenth Fleet had eleven of them, it was far better off than altogether too many other Manticoran fleets had been."|"Shadow of Victory"|"David Weber"

At that time—”"|"Shadow of Victory"|"David Weber"
"ap 06:50"|six-fifty|"“Probably not enough for them to overhaul us, no, Sir,” Levine agreed. “But if the wilder reports we’ve had are accurate, they should easily hit six hundred or even six-fifty. In fact, even that would be fairly low for Manties.”"|"Shadow of Victory"|"David Weber"
"ap 06:10"|six-ten|"“I did say they were ‘wilder reports,’ Sir. But according to the only Solarian report we have from New Tuscany, their battlecruisers were pulling over six-ten before they took out Jean Bart. And Admiral O’Cleary’s debrief after Spindle suggests the same sort of accelerations.”"|"Shadow of Victory"|"David Weber"
"ap 03:30"|"three hours and thirty minutes"|"It was currently—he checked the astrogation display—687,191,428 kilometers to the limit. At his best acceleration, his force could reach it in roughly three hours and thirty minutes. At their current acceleration, it would take the Manties sixty-one minutes longer than that to reach the same destination. But if they had additional acceleration in reserve—especially if it was the ridiculous sort of acceleration some of Levine’s “wilder reports” ascribed to them—his ability to outrun them was far from assured, even if that was what he decided to do. Oh, he could always tweak his own accel, but the absolute best he could do, even cutting his compensator safety margin to zero, was only 4.78 KPS²…almost a full kilometer per second squared lower than the Manties were demonstrating even with the freighter to slow them. And three of his eight battlecruisers had been overdue for major overhauls well before Josef Byng blew up the League’s relations with Manticore and put maintenance schedules on indefinite hold. He frankly doubted their compensators were up to that sort of strain."|"Shadow of Victory"|"David Weber"
"ap 02:10"|"two hours and ten minutes"|"The Manticoran commander could have avoided that by simply using his higher deceleration rate to hold the range open and use his missiles’ greater range against him. Instead, Sierra One had maintained acceleration…and the freighter and its escorts had continued to race back towards the hyper limit astern of him. The range between BatCruRon 720 and Sierra One had grown to 171,832,356 kilometers, but Tamaguchi’s velocity advantage was down to only 16,709 KPS. As he continued to decelerate and Sierra One continued to accelerate, the rate at which the range was opening would steadily decrease. In fact, BatCruRon 720 would still be a half light-hour from the farther hyper limit when they reached a relative zero velocity, assuming both sides maintained their current accelerations. More importantly, even at his current risky acceleration rate, Tamaguchi would be two hundred and sixty-three minutes’ flight time from the limit at that point…and Sierra One would be only two hundred and twenty-seven minutes from it. If Tamaguchi turned back at that point, Sierra One would run him down in barely two hours and ten minutes at its current acceleration, 49,358,000 kilometers short of the hyper limit."|"Shadow of Victory"|"David Weber"
"ap 07:20"|seven-twenty|"My God. That implies a zero-margin acceleration that’s at least seven hundred gravities, maybe even seven-twenty, if he’s gone to a ten percent margin. That’s damned near a forty-five percent advantage!"|"Shadow of Victory"|"David Weber"
"ap 06:41"|6.41|"Which was why Raven and Parasol—which were among the stealthiest vessels ever built—had taken the two CW had dropped off under tow and tagged along behind Alistair McKeon and her consorts at a much lower acceleration. Combined with their onboard stealth systems, they’d been almost impossible to detect, and they’d coordinated their acceleration with McKeon’s. Now the UMVs lay less than eight thousand kilometers ahead of Tremaine’s flag ship with the range closing at less than fifty kilometers per second, although that was climbing at 6.41 KPS. More to the point, the first of them had already used its pressors to eject one hundred and forty pods—each of which contained nine Mark 23 D multidrive missiles—into space."|"Shadow of Victory"|"David Weber"
20:10|"Twenty…ten"|"“Twenty…ten…five…now,” Golbatsi said, and a second salvo of Mark 23s launched. There were less than half as many of them this time…but their acceleration was twice as high."|"Shadow of Victory"|"David Weber"

He truly liked his executive officer, and Ortega was one of the most reliable and conscientious officers he’d ever known, yet he sometimes suspected that one of the Ortega ancestors had managed to get molycircs inserted into his genome. There were people who were orderly, there were people who were precise, there were people who were meticulous, and then there was Ortega. When Akers had told him at the start of the commission that he liked to start the day with a brief meeting with his XO at around 8:30, he hadn’t realized what he was about to unleash."|"Shadow of Victory"|"David Weber"
