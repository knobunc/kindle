"~ 00:00"|"about midnight"|"So then, between breakfast and dinner, Dinah and Dorinda ate biscuits and strawberry jam, and Devonshire cream with raspberry jam, and sponge cake with damson jam. Between dinner and tea-time they usually ate a pound of chocolates and some candied fruit and a few caramels. And about midnight they often woke and went downstairs to the kitchen, where they ate whatever they could find, such as cold chicken and hard-boiled eggs and custard and plum tart and a slice or two of cake."|"The Wind on the Moon"|"Eric Linklater"
"ap 00:00"|"twelve o’clock"|"Then Constable Drum said that his prisoners would have to hurry, because in prison they always had dinner at twelve o’clock, and if they were late they wouldn’t get any. So the Jurymen and Jurywomen, and Mrs. Taper too, set off at a great pace, their handcuffs clinking and clanking, and all the other people, in two big columns, marched on either side of them."|"The Wind on the Moon"|"Eric Linklater"
"ap 07:30"|"half-past seven"|"‘Oh, I’m sure we did,’ said Dinah. ‘We had to do lessons, of course, and be punctual for dinner, and go to bed at half-past seven, but in between times we had quite a lot of freedom. Hadn’t we, Dorinda?’"|"The Wind on the Moon"|"Eric Linklater"
14:30|"2.30 p.m."|"At 2.30 p.m. on 13th inst. began to shadow Sir Bobadil the Ostrich, whom I suspect of being the criminal. Shadowing successful. Didn’t lose sight of him once.—Query: Did he know I was following him? Answer: Don’t think so, because I was walking very quietly.—He proceeded to river, where there is sandy ground, and stopped. He stood as if thinking about something. Then quite suddenly he buried his head in the sand. I watched him intently, but he made no other movement. I sat down and waited. I waited for a long time. Nothing happened. Then I got hungry so I came home. When last seen Sir Bobadil was still there with his head in the sand. Had something to eat and thought about case.—Query: Was I baffled? Answer: Yes.—Thought harder and fell asleep. But when I woke up, everything was clear!!! Sir Bobadil is the criminal, as I suspected. He stole his wife’s eggs and buried them. This afternoon (13th inst.) he meant to dig them up again. But he dug in the wrong place, hit his head on a rock, and stunned himself! That is why he stood so still. N.B.—This is only a theory, and will have to be proved before it becomes evidence."|"The Wind on the Moon"|"Eric Linklater"
"~ 10:00"|"About ten o’clock in the morning"|"About ten o’clock in the morning Sir Lankester and Mr. Plum were standing outside Dinah and Dorinda’s cage, arguing about the events of the previous night. Sir Lankester, who wore a large piece of sticking-plaster on his forehead, had by then remembered the alarming sight of the animals charging on to the lawn. He remembered throwing his boomerang, and he remembered waking up to see Marie Louise bending over him. But Mr. Plum refused to believe a word of this fantastic story, and said that in his opinion Sir Lankester had had a nightmare."|"The Wind on the Moon"|"Eric Linklater"
"ap 02:30"|"half-past two"|"Dinah and Dorinda waited with the utmost impatience till afternoon. Visitors were admitted to the zoo on Sundays at half-past two, and the main gate would be open for them. The gatekeeper, of course, would be there all the time to see that none of the animals went out, but Dinah had a plan for smuggling the Golden Puma past him. She and Dorinda, having drunk Mrs. Grimble’s magic draught and resumed their ordinary shape, could, if they liked, walk out with the other visitors and no one would suspect them."|"The Wind on the Moon"|"Eric Linklater"
"~ 15:00"|"about three o’clock that afternoon"|"As a result of the conversation they had, Mr. Hobson and Mr. Jobson might have been seen, about three o’clock that afternoon, walking with firm and decided steps up the drive that led to Mr. Justice Rumple’s house on the north side of the River Brill. The Judge, as it happened, was playing clock-golf with his Cook, and his two maids were watching, so there was some delay before the visitors were admitted. They had, indeed, to wait for about twenty minutes, until the game was finished. But then they were shown into the library."|"The Wind on the Moon"|"Eric Linklater"
"~ 21:00"|"about nine o’clock that night"|"At about nine o’clock that night Dinah and Dorinda heard someone whistling in the garden. They had gone to bed but they were still wide awake, and as soon as they heard the whistle repeated they got up, put on slippers and dressing-gowns, and going quietly downstairs, went into the garden through the french window in the dining-room. In a corner of the rhododendron shrubbery they found Mr. Hobson and Mr. Jobson."|"The Wind on the Moon"|"Eric Linklater"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"And then one night he could not sleep at all, for the smell of mouse was stronger than ever, and the dining-room had smelt abominably of fish, and the smell of decay in the library had been perfectly disgusting. He sat up in bed and turned on the light, and looked at his watch. It was four o’clock. Quite soon he would have to get up, and walk into Midmeddlecum, where all the little boys and girls would hold their noses when they saw him coming, and ostentatiously avoid him."|"The Wind on the Moon"|"Eric Linklater"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"An expression of great sadness settled on the Judge’s face, but making an effort he decided to be patient, and sitting down on a grassy bank opposite the prison gate he lighted a cigar and prepared to wait until nine o’clock, which was the usual breakfast-time at Midmeddlecum Gaol."|"The Wind on the Moon"|"Eric Linklater"
"ap 09:30"|"half-past nine"|"But at half-past nine they came out, looking very serious and important, and the Judge stood on a chair and politely announced that he had changed his mind, and so they would be released from prison and could go where they liked and do as they pleased—‘Within reason, of course, always within reason,’ he quickly added."|"The Wind on the Moon"|"Eric Linklater"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"‘Tell her,’ said Dinah, ‘to be at the cross-roads on the other side of Midmeddlecum, where the long row of beeches begins, at six o’clock on Wednesday. Mr. Corvo is taking us to Starveling Hall in a motorcar. We’ll stop at the cross-roads and pick her up.’"|"The Wind on the Moon"|"Eric Linklater"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"Mr. Corvo waited till they had finished eating, and then he said, ‘We are now in Bombardy. In about four hours’ time we shall be in Gliedermannheim. When we get to the station they will have to take the furniture vans off the railway trucks and put them on to lorries. Then they will drive us to the Castle, which is seven miles from the station. It is unlikely, I think, that we shall reach the Castle before six or seven o’clock, and then it will be too late to start unpacking the vans.—That is my opinion, and Bultek, when we were planning the journey, agreed with me.—So they will leave the furniture vans in the courtyard of the Castle till morning before they open them. But when it becomes quite dark we shall climb out and find our way into the Castle, and begin to look for your father."|"The Wind on the Moon"|"Eric Linklater"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"‘Far away,’ said Mr. Corvo. ‘Listen carefully to what I am going to tell you. While I was hiding in the suit of armour Count Hulagu and the Lord Chamberlain came and stood in front of me, no more than two feet away. They were planning where all the furniture should go. Then an Officer of the Guard arrived and told Count Hulagu that seven men, who for a long time had been plotting against him, had been captured at a place called Lodoban, which is nearly two hundred miles away. “They will be shot at dawn to-morrow,“ said Count Hulagu, “and I shall be there to see their execution.“—He is very cruel, he likes to see people being shot.—Then he told the Lord Chamberlain to get his motor-car at once, and said that no more furniture need be unpacked to-night. So he has gone to Lodoban. It will take him at least five hours to get there. Then there will be the execution. Then he will have breakfast. Let us suppose that he begins to return at nine o’clock to-morrow morning: he will not be here before two in the afternoon. So it will be quite safe for you to sleep in his bed, and you will not even have to get up early.’"|"The Wind on the Moon"|"Eric Linklater"

"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"They hardly stirred till eight o’clock, when Mr. Corvo came in to wake them. Drowsy as they were, they could see at once that he was very pleased about something, and almost his first words were, ‘I have found some information of the greatest importance! But I shall not tell you now. Not till we have had breakfast. And do not be alarmed when, in order to get breakfast, I make a great noise.’"|"The Wind on the Moon"|"Eric Linklater"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"By this time they had all had a good wash and looked a little more respectable, though not much. So they said good-bye to the policemen and went out to buy new clothes. Major Palfrey and Mr. Corvo went to a barber’s and got shaved and had their hair cut, while Dinah and Dorinda in another part of the shop had their hair cut and washed. By one o’clock they were all as smart as if they were going to a party, and then they went to a hotel and had an enormous meal, and presently caught a train to Midmeddlecum."|"The Wind on the Moon"|"Eric Linklater"
"< 00:00"|"before midnight"|"Then everybody came and shook hands with them, and presently they formed a great procession and marched home singing Begone Dull Care, Stormalong, and Bannocks o’ Bere-meal. Outside their house the people of Midmeddlecum gave them three cheers and another for luck, and then Constable Drum sent them all home. But everybody had so much to talk about that neither the Palfreys nor anyone else in Midmeddlecum went to bed before midnight."|"The Wind on the Moon"|"Eric Linklater"
