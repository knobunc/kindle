"ap 00:15"|"quarter past
twelve"|"She kept her eyes on the door.
Suddenly Alberto walked in. Although it was midsummer, he was wearing
a black beret and a gray hip-length coat of herringbone tweed. He
hurried over to her. It felt very strange to meet him in public.
“It’s quarter past
twelve!”
“It’s what is known as the
academic quarter of an hour. Would you like a snack?”"|"Sophie's World"|"Jostein Gaarder"
"ap < 11:00"|"almost eleven o’clock"|"It was almost eleven o’clock. She had been reading for over two
hours. From time to time she had raised her eyes from the text and
laughed aloud, but she had also turned over on her side and gasped.
It was a good thing she was alone in the house."|"Sophie's World"|"Jostein Gaarder"
"ap ~ 09:00"|"around nine o’clock"|"On Saturday, June 23, she awoke with a start around nine o’clock.
She knew her father had already left the camp in Lebanon. Now it was
just a question of waiting. The last part of his day was planned down
to the smallest detail."|"Sophie's World"|"Jostein Gaarder"
"ap 08:00"|"Eight o’clock"|"“A true philosopher never says
‘never.’ What time is it?”
“Eight o’clock.”
“The same as when we left
Captain’s Bend, of course.”"|"Sophie's World"|"Jostein Gaarder"
"ap 08:30"|"Half past eight"|"“Only people of our own kind. We
might meet some of them. What’s the time now?”
“Half past eight.”
“We’ll have to take a few
shortcuts. We can’t stay behind this trailer, that’s
for sure.”"|"Sophie's World"|"Jostein Gaarder"
"ap 04:30"|"half past four"|"Major Albert Knag had just landed at Kastrup Airport outside
Copenhagen. It was half past four on Saturday, June 23. It had
already been a long day. This penultimate lap had been by plane from
Rome."|"Sophie's World"|"Jostein Gaarder"
"ap < 09:00"|"almost nine o’clock"|"“It’s almost nine o’clock.
He’ll soon be landing at Kjevik. But we won’t be stopped
for speeding.”"|"Sophie's World"|"Jostein Gaarder"

"ap 10:15"|"quarter past ten"|"Alberto and Sophie stopped the red
convertible on the square in Lillesand outside the Hotel Norge. It
was a quarter past ten. They could see a large bonfire out in
the archipelago."|"Sophie's World"|"Jostein Gaarder"

could be arriving any minute."|"Sophie's World"|"Jostein Gaarder"
"< 00:00"|"almost midnight"|"The family did not get up from the
table until almost midnight. Hilde and the major strolled toward the
glider. They waved to Marit as she walked up to the white-painted
house."|"Sophie's World"|"Jostein Gaarder"
"< 00:00"|"nearly midnight"|"Hilde settled herself comfortably in the glider beside her father. It
was nearly midnight. They sat looking out across the bay. A few stars
glimmered palely in the light sky. Gentle waves lapped over the
stones under the dock."|"Sophie's World"|"Jostein Gaarder"
