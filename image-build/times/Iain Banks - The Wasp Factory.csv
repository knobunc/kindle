"ap < 11:00"|"nearly eleven"|"I was logging the cache petrol bombs which hadn’t been inspected for evaporation recently when the phone went. I looked at my watch, surprised at the lateness of the hour: nearly eleven. I ran downstairs to the phone, hearing my father coming to the door of his room as I passed it."|"The Wasp Factory"|"Iain Banks"
"ap 02:50"|Two-fifty|"‘Yeah, I’m going to get a bike soon. Two-fifty, of course,’ Jamie was saying. I was half-listening. He was not going to get a bike because he wouldn’t be able to reach the pedals, but I wouldn’t have said anything even if I could have, because nobody expects people to tell the truth to women and, besides, that’s what friends are for, as they say. The girl, when I could see her properly, was a rough-looking twenty, and had as many coats of paint over her eyes as a Roller gets on its doors. She smoked a horrible French cigarette."|"The Wasp Factory"|"Iain Banks"
"~ 01:00"|"about one o’clock in the morning"|"I left about one o’clock in the morning, more sober, and awash with tea. My stomach and throat were almost back to normal, though my voice still sounded harsh. I bade Jamie and his mother goodnight and walked on through the outskirts of town to the track heading for the island, then down the track in blackness, sometimes using my small torch, towards the bridge and the house."|"The Wasp Factory"|"Iain Banks"

"ap 00:00"|Twelve|"Death by fire has always been at Twelve, and it is one of the Ends never replaced by one of the Alternatives. I have signified Fire as Paul’s death; that happened near to midday, just as Blyth’s exit by venom is represented by the Spider’s Parlour at Four. Esmerelda probably died by drowning (the Gents), and I put her time of death arbitrarily at Eight, to keep things symmetrical."|"The Wasp Factory"|"Iain Banks"

"> 12:00"|"just after noon"|"I reached the dump just after noon, coming through some small trees to it. I sat down in the shade of one tree and inspected the place with the glasses. Some gulls were there, but no people. A little smoke drifted up from a fire near its centre, and spread around it was all the debris from the town and its area: cardboard and black plastic bags and the gleaming, battered whiteness of old washing machines, cookers and fridges. Papers picked themselves up and went round in a circle for a minute or so as a tiny whirlwind started, then dropped again."|"The Wasp Factory"|"Iain Banks"
"ap > 06:31"|"Just after half-past six"|"Just after half-past six, the phone rang. I leaped out of the chair, dived down the door out of the loft and skidded down the stairs, flicking the phone off the cradle and up to my mouth in one clean movement. I felt a buzz of excitement at how well co-ordinated I was today, and said, quite calmly: ‘Yes?’"|"The Wasp Factory"|"Iain Banks"
"ap > 11:00"|"after eleven"|"It was dark, I was still in the chair, arms crossed under my head, resting on the metal surround of the skylight. And something, a noise inside the house, had woken me. I sat for a second, feeling my heart race, feeling my back complain about the position it had been in for so long. Blood made its painful way into the parts of my arms the weight of my head had restricted the supply to. I spun round in the chair, quickly and quietly. The loft was black, but I didn’t sense anything. I touched a button on my watch, discovered it was after eleven. I had slept for hours. Idiot! Then I heard somebody moving about downstairs; indistinct footsteps, a door closing, other noises. Glass smashed. I felt the hair on the back of my neck go up; the second time in one week. I clenched my jaw, told myself to stop taking fright and do something: It might be Eric or it might be my father. I would go down and find out. To be safe, I would take my knife."|"The Wasp Factory"|"Iain Banks"
