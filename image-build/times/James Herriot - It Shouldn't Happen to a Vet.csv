Siegfried's sleep had been broken by a 3 a.m. calving and he looked a lot older than his thirty-odd years. He listened in silence as he finished his breakfast then pushed away his plate and poured a last cup of coffee. ""Hard luck, James. The old sheep skin, eh? Funny thing you've been in the Dales over a year now and never come across that one. Suppose it must be going out of fashion a bit now but you know it has a grain of sense behind it like a lot of these old remedies. You can imagine there's a lot of heat generated under a fresh sheep skin and it acts like a great hot poultice on the back - really tickles them up after a while, and if a cow is lying there out of sheer cussedness she'll often get up just to get rid of it."""|"It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet"|"James Herriot"

"~ 19:00"|"about seven o'clock in the evening"|"I got back into the car and looked at my list of visits; it was good to be back and the day passed quickly. It was about seven o'clock in the evening, when I thought I had finished, that I had a call from Terry Watson, a young farm worker who kept two cows of his own. One of them, he said, had summer mastitis. Mid-July was a bit early for this but in the later summer months we saw literally hundreds of these cases; in fact a lot of the farmers called it ""August Bag'. It was an unpleasant condition because it was just about incurable and usually resulted in the cow losing a quarter (the area of the udder which supplies each teat with milk) and sometimes even her life."|"It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet"|"James Herriot"
"ap ~ 08:00"|"about eight o'clock"|"As it happened, I was called out early the next morning to a milk fever and on the way home I decided to look in at the Watsons' cottage. It was about eight o'clock and when I entered the little two-stalled shed, Terry was in the same position as I had left him on the previous night. He was pulling at the infected teat, eyes closed, cheek resting against the cow's flank. He started as though roused from sleep when I spoke."|"It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet"|"James Herriot"
"ap 01:00"|"one o'clock"|"His devotion resulted in my being called out frequently for very trivial things and I swore freely under my breath when I heard his voice on the other end of the line at one o'clock one morning."|"It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet"|"James Herriot"
02:00|"2 a.m."|"I went into the kitchen to wash my hands and was using the towel hanging behind the door when I noticed something odd; there was a subdued hum of conversation, the low rumble of many voices. It seemed unusual in a pub at 2 a.m. and I looked through the partly open door into the bar. The place was crowded. In the light of a single weak electric bulb I could see a row of men drinking at the counter while others sat behind foaming pint pots on the wooden settles against the walls."|"It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet"|"James Herriot"
02:00|"2 a.m."|"And I did share his pleasure; it was one of the satisfying little jobs. Climbing into the car I felt that the nocturnal visit had been worth while even though I had been effortlessly duped into buying a round with no hope of reciprocation. Not that I wanted to drink any more - my stomach wasn't used to receiving pints of ale at 2 a.m. and a few whimpers of surprise and indignation were already coming up - but I was just a bit ruffled by the offhand, professional way those gentlemen in the tap room had handled me."|"It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet"|"James Herriot"

The last little calf had a space clipped in his shaggy neck and bawled heartily as he felt the needle then I was out m the sweet air throwing my coat in the car boot. I looked at my watch - three o'clock. I was nearly two hours behind my schedule now and already I was hot and weary, with skinned toes on my right foot where a cow had trodden and a bruised left instep caused by the sudden descent of Fenwick's size thirteen hobnails during a particularly violent melee. As I closed the boot and limped round to the car door I began to wonder a little about this easy Ministry work."|"It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet"|"James Herriot"

"ap 07:15"|"quarter past seven"|"My last call was just outside Darrowby and I could hear the church clock striking a quarter past seven as I got stiffly out of the car. After my easy day in the service of the government I felt broken in mind and body; I had to suppress a scream when I saw yet another long line of cows' backsides awaiting me. The sun was low, and dark thunder clouds piling up in the west had thrown the countryside into an eerie darkness; and in the old-fashioned, slit-windowed byre the animals looked shapeless and ill-defined in the gloom."|"It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet"|"James Herriot"

I jumped straight into my car and in less than ten minutes was threading my way through the overgrown grass in the front garden with the animals watching from their window. The barking broke out as I knocked, but Ben's was absent. As I went into the little room I saw the old dog Lying on his side, very still, by the bed."|"It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet"|"James Herriot"
"~ 23:00"|"around eleven o'clock at night"|"I had been uncannily lucky in that I had been at Darrowby for more than a year and had never had to visit this farm. Mr. Sidlow rarely called us up during normal working hours as, after wrestling with his conscience for a few i days, he always seemed to lose the battle around eleven o'clock at night (he made exceptions in the case of the occasional Sunday afternoon) and it had always landed on Siegfried's duty nights. It was Siegfried who had trailed out, swearing quietly and returned, slightly pop-eyed in the small hours."|"It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet"|"James Herriot"

We usually either relieved the bloat by puncturing the stomach or we - carefully pushed the obstruction down into the stomach by means of a long ; flexible leather instrument called a probang.)

It had never occurred to me how much this affected my outlook every time I walked on to a farm. This wasn't the same thing at all. I had come to take this man's daughter out.

I knew what I would find - the usual grim signs of a vet's failure; the box door open and the drag marks where Mallock had winched the carcass across the yard on to his lorry. But everything was as usual and as I walked over to the silent box I steeled myself. The knacker man hadn't arrived yet but there was nothing surer than that my patient was Lying dead in there. She couldn't possibly have hung on till now.

From that time on, whenever I saw him with his van out in the country he would turn slowly and direct a blank stare at me till I was out of sight.
