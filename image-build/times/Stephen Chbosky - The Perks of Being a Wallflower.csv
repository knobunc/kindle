There was one time… I went to the mill… no work… none.… I came home at two in the morning… pissed and pissed… your grandmother showed me their report cards… C-plus average… and these were smart girls. So, I went into their room and I beat some sense into them… and when it was done and they were crying, I just held up their report cards and said… ‘This will never happen again.’ She still talks about it… your mother… but you know something… it never did happen again… they went to college… both of them. I just wish I could have sent them… I always wanted to send them… . I wish Helen could have understood that. I think your mother did… deep down… she’s a good woman… you should be proud of her.”"|"The Perks of Being a Wallflower"|"Stephen Chbosky"
03:00|"three A.M."|"Once on a yellow piece of paper with green lines
he wrote a poemAnd he called it “Chops”
because that was the name of his dogAnd that’s what it was all aboutAnd his teacher gave him an A
and a gold starAnd his mother hung it on the kitchen door
and read it to his auntsThat was the year Father Tracy
took all the kids to the zooAnd he let them sing on the busAnd his little sister was born
with tiny toenails and no hairAnd his mother and father kissed a lotAnd the girl around the corner sent him a
Valentine signed with a row of X’s
and he had to ask his father what the X’s meantAnd his father always tucked him in bed at nightAnd was always there to do it

Once on a piece of white paper with blue lines
he wrote a poemAnd he called it “Autumn”
because that was the name of the seasonAnd that’s what it was all aboutAnd his teacher gave him an A
and asked him to write more clearlyAnd his mother never hung it on the kitchen door
because of its new paintAnd the kids told him
that Father Tracy smoked cigarsAnd left butts on the pewsAnd sometimes they would burn holesThat was the year his sister got glasses
with thick lenses and black framesAnd the girl around the corner laughed
when he asked her to go see Santa ClausAnd the kids told him why
his mother and father kissed a lotAnd his father never tucked him in bed at nightAnd his father got mad
when he cried for him to do it.

Once on a paper torn from his notebook
he wrote a poemAnd he called it “Innocence: A Question”
because that was the question about his girlAnd that’s what it was all aboutAnd his professor gave him an A
and a strange steady lookAnd his mother never hung it on the kitchen door
because he never showed herThat was the year that Father Tracy diedAnd he forgot how the end
of the Apostle’s Creed wentAnd he caught his sister
making out on the back porchAnd his mother and father never kissed
or even talkedAnd the girl around the corner
wore too much makeupThat made him cough when he kissed her
but he kissed her anyway
because that was the thing to doAnd at three A.M. he tucked himself into bed
his father snoring soundly

That’s why on the back of a brown paper bag
he tried another poemAnd he called it “Absolutely Nothing”Because that’s what it was really all aboutAnd he gave himself an Aand a slash on each damned wristAnd he hung it on the bathroom door
because this time he didn’t think
he could reach the kitchen.

That was the poem I read for Patrick. Nobody knew who wrote it, but Bob said he heard it before, and he heard that it was some kid’s suicide note. I really hope it wasn’t because then I don’t know if I like the ending."|"The Perks of Being a Wallflower"|"Stephen Chbosky"

Everyone else is either asleep or having sex. I’ve been watching cable television and eating jello. And seeing things move.

All my relatives, including my dad’s family from Ohio, came to the house around ten A.M. The two families really don’t like each other, except for all us younger cousins because we don’t know any better."|"The Perks of Being a Wallflower"|"Stephen Chbosky"
