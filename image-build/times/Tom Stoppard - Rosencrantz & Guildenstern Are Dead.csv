GUIL : Land of the midnight sun, that is.
ROS : Of course."|"Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead"|"Tom Stoppard"
12:00|"high noon"|"ROS watches it coming—from the auditorium. Behind him is a gay sight. Beneath the re-tilted umbrella, reclining in a deck-chair, wrapped in a rug, reading a book, possibly smoking, sits HAMLET.
ROS watches the morning come, and brighten to high noon.
ROS : I’m assuming nothing. (He stands up. GUIL wakes.) The position as I see it, then. That’s west unless we’re off course, in which case it’s night; the King gave me the same as you, the King gave you the same as me; the King never gave me the letter, the King gave you the letter, we don’t know what’s in the letter; we take Hamlet to the English king, it depending on when we get there who he is, and we hand over the letter, which may or may not have something in it to keep us going, and if not, we are finished and at a loose end, if they have loose ends. We could have done worse. I don’t think we missed any chances. . . . Not that we’re getting much help. (He sits down again. They lie down—prone.) If we stopped breathing we’d vanish."|"Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead"|"Tom Stoppard"
