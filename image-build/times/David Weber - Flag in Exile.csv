"ap 01:15"|"one hour fifteen minutes"|"""ETA now one hour fifteen minutes, Citizen Vice Admiral.""Citizen Vice Admiral Thurston blinked and looked up from his tactical plot. He'd expressly requested the reminder, yet he'd been so deep in his review of the final task force exercises that he'd actually managed to forget, temporarily, at least, and put aside the tingling mixture of anticipation and tension."|"Flag in Exile"|"David Weber"
"ap 05:20"|five-twenty|"""All right. Now, if our strength estimates are correct, they don't have anything heavier than a battlecruiser, and a battlecruiser can pull five hundred to five-twenty gees. A DuQuesne-class SD, on the other hand, can pull a maximum accel of only about four hundred and twenty-five. Intelligence estimates the Manties' new inertial compensators increase their efficiency by two to three percent, which would up that to four thirty-three to four thirty-eight, assuming they've had time to refit with it. Intelligence calls that unlikely, but even if they have, those figures are for maximum military power with no safety margin, and the Manties don't like to do that any more than we do. So figure eighty percent as their normal full power setting, and you get roughly three forty-six to three fifty gees for an SD even with the new compensator. If we see anything in that envelope, it may mean Stalking Horse didn't actually get all their SDs out of the system, and that means we'll have to rethink our entire plan."""|"Flag in Exile"|"David Weber"
"ap 08:50"|eight-fifty|"PNS Vindicator, the seventh - and last - battleship of TG 14.1, actually broke past BatRon One completely undamaged and streaked away at forty thousand KPS. A few missiles raced after her, but now she was running away from them rather than into them, and BatRon One had not emerged unscathed from that crushing, short-range slaughter. Glorious had already died, now Manticore's Gift fell out of formation with her entire forward impeller ring - and both sidewalls forward of frame eight-fifty - shot away."|"Flag in Exile"|"David Weber"
"ap ~ 02:50"|"about two fifty"|"""Not good, Milady,"" Mercedes said frankly. ""Glorious is gone, and the Gift's accel is less than a hundred gees - right on point-nine-six KPS squared. Magnificent can make about two fifty gees; Terrible and Courageous have impeller damage of their own, but they're both good for about three sixty. I wouldn't push them harder than that with so many shot-up nodes unbalancing their wedges, Milady."" Honor nodded, and Mercedes rocked back in her chair. ""Furious' drive is actually in the best shape, but she took a real pounding in that last exchange. She's lost half her energy weapons and three-quarters of her missile tubes, and Captain Gates says his starboard sidewall is 'iffy.' "" Her lips twitched at Gates' choice of adjective, then she shrugged. ""For all intents and purposes, Milady, Terrible and Courageous are all we've got, and neither of them is what I'd call healthy."""|"Flag in Exile"|"David Weber"
