They start walking at four in the morning, and they do not get back till eight at night. They have a bite of food, and their eyes are hardly closed on the pillow before they must stand up again, sometimes to start off with nothing but hot water in their stomachs. I cannot stop you taking a bus, umfundisi, but this is a cause to fight for. If we lose it, then they will have to pay more in Sophiatown and Claremont and Kliptown and Pimville."|"Cry, the Beloved Country"|"Alan Paton"

"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"I am sorry they have no house, Mrs. Seme. By the way, my wife would like to discuss with you the work of the Committee. Tonight at seven o’clock, she said. You know our house, No. 17852, near the Dutch Reformed Church. Look, I shall write down the number for you. Good morning, Mrs. Seme."|"Cry, the Beloved Country"|"Alan Paton"
12:00|midday|"After a walk of about one hour, they came to the road that led up to the reformatory. It was midday when they arrived, and from all directions there came boys marching, into the gates of the reformatory. From every place they came, until it seemed that the marching would never end."|"Cry, the Beloved Country"|"Alan Paton"
13:30|1:30P.M|"At 1:30P.M . today Mr. Arthur Jarvis, of Plantation Road, Parkwold, was shot dead in his house by an intruder, thought to be a native. It appears that Mrs. Jarvis and her two children were away for a short holiday, and that Mr. Jarvis had telephoned his partners to say that he would be staying at home with a slight cold. It would seem that a native, probably with two accomplices, entered by the kitchen, thinking no doubt that there would be no one in the house. The native servant in the kitchen was knocked unconscious, and it would appear that Mr. Jarvis heard the disturbance and came down to investigate. He was shot dead at short range in the passageway leading from the stairs into the kitchen. There were no signs of any struggle."|"Cry, the Beloved Country"|"Alan Paton"
00:00|midnight|"We do not know, we do not know. We shall live from day to day, and put more locks on the doors, and get a fine fierce dog when the fine fierce bitch next door has pups, and hold on to our handbags more tenaciously; and the beauty of the trees by night, and the raptures of lovers under the stars, these things we shall forego. We shall forego the coming home drunken through the midnight streets, and the evening walk over the star-lit veld. We shall be careful, and knock this off our lives, and knock that off our lives, and hedge ourselves about with safety and precaution. And our lives will shrink, but they shall be the lives of superior beings; and we shall live with fear, but at least it will not be a fear of the unknown. And the conscience shall be thrust down; the light of life shall not be extinguished, but be put under a bushel, to be preserved for a generation that will live by it again, in some day not yet come; and how it will come, and when it will come, we shall not think about at all."|"Cry, the Beloved Country"|"Alan Paton"
12:00|midday|"ON THE DAY of their return from Ezenzeleni, Kumalo ate his midday meal at the Mission, and returned to Mrs. Lithebe’s to play with Gertrude’s son. There was great bargaining going on, for Mrs. Lithebe had found a buyer for Gertrude’s table and chairs, and for the pots and pans. Everything was sold for three pounds, which was not a bad sum for a table that was badly marked and discoloured, with what he did not ask. And the chairs too were weak, so that one had to sit carefully upon them. Indeed the price was paid for the pots and pans, which were of the stuff called aluminum. Now the black people do not buy such pots and pans, but his sister said that they were the gift of a friend, and into that too he did not enquire."|"Cry, the Beloved Country"|"Alan Paton"
13:30|1:30P.M.|"Yes, Mr. Jarvis. The captain paused. He was shot dead at 1:30P.M. this afternoon in Johannesburg."|"Cry, the Beloved Country"|"Alan Paton"

"ap 00:00"|"twelve o’clock"|"Look at the wonder-share of Tweede Vlei. For it was twenty shillings, and then forty shillings, and then sixty shillings, and then - believe it or not - eighty shillings. And many a man wept because he sold at twelve o’clock instead of two o’clock, or because he bought at two o’clock instead of twelve o’clock. And the man that sold will feel worse tomorrow morning, when the shares go to a hundred shillings."|"Cry, the Beloved Country"|"Alan Paton"

We leave tomorrow by the train that goes at nine o’clock.
So Gertrude is going with you. And her child. You are doing a good thing, my brother. Johannesburg is not a place for a woman alone. But we must drink some tea."|"Cry, the Beloved Country"|"Alan Paton"

Twelve o’clock, inkosana.
Jeepers creepers, it’s time I was off. Thank you for the water, umfundisi."|"Cry, the Beloved Country"|"Alan Paton"

02:30|vigils|"He woke with a start. It was cold, but not so cold. He had never slept before on these vigils, but he was old, not quite finished, but nearly finished. He thought of all those that were suffering, of Gertrude the weak and foolish one, of the people of Shanty Town and Alexandra, of his wife now at this moment. But above all of his son, Absalom. Would he be awake, would he be able to sleep, this night before the morning? He cried out, My son, my son, my son."|"Cry, the Beloved Country"|"Alan Paton"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"With his crying he was now fully awake, and he looked at his watch and saw that it was one o’clock. The sun would rise soon after five, and it was then it was done, they said. If the boy was asleep, then let him sleep, it was better. But if he was awake, then oh Christ of the abundant mercy, be with him. Over this he prayed long and earnestly."|"Cry, the Beloved Country"|"Alan Paton"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"When he woke again there was a faint change in the east, and he looked at his watch almost with a panic. But it was four o’clock and he was reassured. And now it was time to be awake, for it might be they had wakened his son, and called him to make ready. He left his place and could hardly stand, for his feet were cold and numb. He found another place where he could look to the east, and if it was true what men said, when the sun came up over the rim, it would be done."|"Cry, the Beloved Country"|"Alan Paton"
