My uncle had fallen asleep in the kitchen—having worked really late the night before, some job in a Bronx social club, singing and playing the horn with a pickup group of musicians. He was snoring, his shirt was open, a few buttons had popped out on his belly. Between the delicate-looking index and middle fingers of his right hand, a Chesterfield cigarette burning down to the filter, that hand still holding a half glass of rye whiskey, which he used to drink like crazy because in recent years he had been suffering from bad dreams, saw apparitions, felt cursed, and, despite all the women he took to bed, found his life of bachelorhood solitary and wearisome. But I didn’t know this at the time, I thought he was sleeping because he had worked so hard the night before, singing and playing the trumpet for seven or eight hours. I’m talking about a wedding party in a crowded, smoke-filled room (with bolted-shut fire doors), lasting from nine at night to four, five o’clock in the morning, the band playing one-, two-hour sets. I thought he just needed the rest. How could I have known that he would come home and, in the name of unwinding, throw back a glass of rye, then a second, and then a third, and so on, until he’d plant his elbow on the table and use it to steady his chin, as he couldn’t hold his head up otherwise. But that day I ran into the kitchen to wake him up so that he could see the episode, too, shaking him gently and tugging at his elbow, which was a mistake, because it was as if I had pulled loose the support columns of a five-hundred-year-old church: he simply fell over and crashed to the floor."|"The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love"|"Oscar Hijuelos"

It was a six-story tenement, constructed around the turn of the century to house the servant class, and it had a simple stoop with black curlicue railings, a narrow doorway framed in a crenellated brick archway. Above this rose six floors of black wrought-iron fire escapes and lamplit Venetian-blinded windows. It was two minutes from the 125th Street El, an overnight train ride and forty-five-minute flight from Havana, and five minutes from Harlem, the heartland of syncopating rhythm, as they used to say in those days. From its roof you could see the Hudson River and the domed and pillared mausoleum that was Grant’s Tomb toward the northern edge of Riverside Park at 122nd Street and all the way over to the docks, and the lines of commuters and cars waiting to board the ferryboats for New Jersey."|"The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love"|"Oscar Hijuelos"

To write a song communicating such pure love and desire that María, far away, would magically reinstate him into the center of her heart. He thought that she would “hear” these melodies in her dreams and that something would possess her: she would sit down and write him a letter begging his forgiveness, a letter admitting to confusion and foolishness, that one day she would leave her husband—if he was her husband—and he would hear a knocking at the door, make his way down the hall, the panting hound behind him, and find María of his soul standing there, this woman who had somehow become the lost key to happiness."|"The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love"|"Oscar Hijuelos"

Sometimes he had pangs for his daughter, sometimes felt bad that things didn’t work out with his former wife, but he remained determined to have a good time, chase women, drink, eat, and make friends. He wasn’t cold-hearted: he had moments of tenderness that surprised him toward the women he went out with, as if he wanted truly to fall in love, and even tender thoughts about his former wife. He had other moments when he didn’t care. Marriage? Never again, he’d tell himself, even though he’d lie through his teeth about wanting to get married to women he was trying to seduce. Marriage?

But when he was in love with her, he loved the Luisa who was the key to her Uncle Julián García, the thin, pensive Luisa who was there for his pleasure and who never expected anything from him.)

Please, querida, a kiss.” And sometimes she’d kiss the man for the sake of being left alone. She’d double-date with Ana María but disliked it when the evenings lasted until three or four in the morning.

In the alley behind a Chinese restaurant called Papo-lin’s in La Marina, that neighborhood by the harbor near where they lived, he watched two red roosters, powerful machos, fight with their razor-taloned claws. Standing up in a bar in a row of bars, he would eat his dinner, a plate of rice and beans and a pork chop drowned in salt and lemon, for 25 cents, and watch the street euphorically cluttered with life: men pulling rag carts; Chinese workers in velvet shoes and long cotton smocks making their way to the tobacco factories; the poor from Las Yaguas selling their wares and services out of stalls: fortunes told, shoes fixed, jugo de fruta 10 cents, clocks, guitars, house tools, coils of rope, toys and religious articles, statuary and good-luck charms, flowers, love potions and magic candles, get your picture taken for 25 cents, in color! He’d look over the clothing to see what he might buy for the fifteen dollars a week he earned in those days: a good guayabera with fancy lace trimmings, $2; a plain shirt, $1; a pair of Buster Browns, $4; a pair of linen pantalones, $3.50. Hershey bar? 2 cents. Pepsi or Apur-Cola, 10 cents . . .

Flowers growing in pots and flowers spilling off the balconies, and lichen on the sea-rotted walls: astragal fences and antique doors, cornices brown and orange-hued, animal head and angelic door knockers. Racks of copper pots and pans, children running in and out of the stalls, sailors in the city whoring, a bicycle hanging off a rope over a row of bicycle tires; caged parrots; a shady-looking gentleman with the eyes of a turtle, sitting quietly at a narrow fold-up table from which he sold his “artistic” photographs; and then racks of dresses and pretty women moving among the racks and music coming out of the doorways. Smell of blood and sawdust, the sound of animals being butchered on the block, smell of blood and tobacco and a walk down a long alley behind the slaughterhouse that faced another slaughterhouse: a man dumping buckets of water over a floor drenched in blood and behind him, in a row, the split-open carcasses of a dozen pigs.

After six years in the United States, he was still living with a growing dread of things. It wasn’t that he feared one thing in particular; he just had the sense that things weren’t going to work out, that the sky would fall in and lightning would strike him as he walked down the street, that the earth might open up and swallow him. He didn’t sit around dwelling on these thoughts, he dreamed them. He had been on the same plateau of dreams for years, the same dreams that had afflicted him in childhood in Cuba, when he used to wake up in the middle of the night covered in sweat in a room swarming with crows or when he found himself entangled in burning coils of rope, when the rope mysteriously crept into his body through his ears and feasted on his insides, when he would wake up in the middle of the night and find the priest standing over him with his funeral cassock and a grim face like melted wax, his vestments and hands smelling oddly of frijoles negros and church incense."|"The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love"|"Oscar Hijuelos"

The confident, self-assured man looks to the future and never backwards to the past. The heart of every success is a plan that takes you forward. In moments of doubt you must remember that every obstacle is only a temporary delay. That every problem can be solved. When there is a will there is a way.

02:00|"two in the morning"|"Later Mrs. Shannon unwrapped the aluminum foil off the apple spice cake, which she had set down on the table, revealing a puffy-topped cake filled with citron chunks, cherries, and raisins. The children jumped up for their slices and the adults converged around the cake, admiringly. It was a delicious cake, like kissing a woman for the first time, thought Cesar; like rum-drenched pineapple, thought Nestor; like eating flan with Poppy, thought Delorita; like chocolate, thought Eugenio; like apple spice cake, thought little Leticia. To realize that this was made by the very same woman whose shrill voice shouted up into the courtyard at two in the morning, screaming, “Will youse fucken turn that shit down!” The same woman who came up the stairs one day and stood at the door wielding a hammer, face red and on the verge of attack. When they finished eating, Cesar said to Mrs. Shannon, “I want to give you something,” and he went into the living room. He used to keep a black briefcase on top of the bass drum of an American drum kit, which sat along with other instruments on a dolly in the corner of the living room beside the couch; he snapped it open and pulled out a black-and-white photograph of himself, Nestor, and Desi Arnaz taken during the stirring finale of “Beautiful María of My Soul”—the three harmonizing, with mouths open, teeth showing, and heads bathed in halos of light. The briefcase was filled with about three hundred copies of that photograph. Their friend Benny the Baby and General Purpose Photographer had taken their studio negative and made up the copies; he would put one in his window alongside a First Communion photo and the picture of a GI home from the war. They had one in the hallway—the original—signed by Arnaz: “To my good friends, Cesar and Nestor Castillo, with a strong love y un abrazo siempre. Desi Arnaz 5/17/55.” He came back into the dining room with one of the photographs, addressed it to Mrs. Shannon, and then gave it to his brother to sign. Mrs. Shannon held this signed photograph to her breast and declared, “Oh, thank you.”"|"The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love"|"Oscar Hijuelos"

In the hallway, just beyond the bookcase of the novels that Delores liked to buy, Cesar and Mrs. Shannon stopped for a moment, and in that moment Cesar gave her a deep and nearly loving look, as if he might really kiss her, but he touched her elbow and squeezed her plump shoulders, patting her on the back, as he often did with friends. Escorting her to the door, he thanked her for the cake, and leaned over the railing, watching the roundness that was Mrs. Shannon disappearing down the stairs. Back in the dining room, he pulled up a chair and said to his brother Nestor, “Do you want some more of this cake, brother?” And then, after another slice: “Imagine that, Mrs. Shannon baking a cake for us, and a good cake. Imagine that.”"|"The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love"|"Oscar Hijuelos"

People lined up on the street to get a look at these musicians, and when they climbed off the bus at the Thomas E. Dewey American Legionnaires Hall, they were greeted with friendly nods and smiles.

Even when he was stuck in the middle of nowhere, in a small town where everybody watched him, the Mambo King was always up to his old tricks, dating girls wherever he could, but hardly ever with the kind of success he had back in New York, where the greater difficulties of life promoted a greater pursuit of pleasure. Still, the man never gave up! Sometimes during the dances he would discreetly ask if a certain young lady might show him around town the next morning before he left on the bus. Sometimes he made dates at night and found himself waiting on street corners with names like Maple and Vine at three in the morning, pacing up and down, cigarette in mouth, hands in trousers, waiting for these chancy rendezvous with women named Betty and Mary-Jo and Annette. Meeting these women, he would sit for hours talking sincerely with them and musing on the beauty of the stars, and then he would try to make his move: sometimes he petted, tongue-kissed, wrestled, dry-humped women in the parks of these small towns or in the back seat of a car in the local lovers’ lane, but usually his restlessness and voracious ego were satisfied with the amorous tension of these dates."|"The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love"|"Oscar Hijuelos"
22:30|"ten-thirty at night"|"(And there were other women that he daydreamed about as he sat drinking his last drinks in the Hotel Splendour. Going down on some girl on Coney Island at ten-thirty at night, the two of them huddled under a blanket. A woman with a broken leg in a cast, standing up in a phone booth during a rainstorm in Atlantic City, the gales whipping against the glass, things so dark around them nobody could see, so that in the ferocity of the winds they started to kiss, his knee pressing between her legs, and this woman saying to hell with it and pulling up her sun skirt and down with her panties, down over her legs and down over the thick plaster cast, so that he lifted her up onto him and she leaned back against the wall, laughing and thinking, This man is insane, laughing and seeing stars while people outside looked like zigzagged pencil doodles running through the deluge. And there was that woman in the crowd watching the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day parade. She was standing next to him, Leticia, and Eugenio, whose presence certainly made things easier, as this woman seemed to like children very much and smiled each time he hoisted Leticia up over his head so that she would see the bands and floats better. But he really made this woman smile when he said, “And can I lift you up?” Ended up with them walking to the subway together and Cesar making a date with her for a week later. She had a nice body, really a massive woman with pendulous breasts, but, coño, was she motherly and liked to have him suck them and played a game of slapping his face with them, but the woman was too serious, how could he fuck around with a war widow with sadness in her eyes even when she looked fine in one of those lacy Tigress of the Night brassieres, really broke his heart to hurt her so, and she was an office manager in a place downtown, about forty years old but beautiful, she just took everything too seriously, but, man, was she fun, another one who liked her men “built,” as she put it, men with king-sized sticks. And there was that woman in the fancy white coat whom he watched along Fifth Avenue one day, she was the one he followed into Saks Fifth Avenue up to the glove department, where he stood pretending to shop and watched her posing before the mirrors. She had one of those elegant thin model bodies, tall and firm, and he watched her slipping on gloves, nice soft leather gloves, and when he closed his eyes, he imagined the way she would pull on a pair of panties after a shower or play, with dampened fingers, with his thing, slipping a condom on him the same way she put her fingers into that glove. She was impossible, too snotty for him. He followed her all over the store and thought he had a thing going because every now and then she would look deep into his eyes, and he considered that a form of lovemaking, but just as he was about to make his move, to approach her, these two gents stepped out from one of the service departments, store guards, who said to him, “We understand you’re bothering one of our customers, sir,” and that was that, his face blushing with embarrassment, and as he was being led out of the store, he got the last lick in, gave her this look which said, “You don’t know who I am or what you’ve just missed, baby.” And there were others, like the European lady he met on that one-night job moonlighting as a crooner on a harbor tour boat. She was French and not even that good-looking, but she had been staring at him as he sang on the stage. And she was aggressive, joining him by the railing to watch the moonswept sea, because that was when there were many lonely European women, the war had left so many men dead. And she said to him in a thick French accent, “I love the way you use your hands and shake those maracas. You have lovely hands, may I look at them?” And she started to read them and said, “You have a long lifeline, if you want it, and success is here if you want it. But I see trouble ahead, something that you must be prepared for.” She said, “You see that spot here that looks like an exploding star, that means something’s going to explode in your life. I used to see that in Europe all the time, on many, many hands.” She was so thin her Venus mound protruded like a huge fig, and when he made love to her he kept thinking about the city of Paris and the Eiffel Tower and all those newsreels he’d seen of the Free French and Allied troops marching victoriously back into the city. And there were others: Gloria, Ismelda, Juanita, Alice, Conchita, Vivian, Elena, Irene . . .)"|"The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love"|"Oscar Hijuelos"

Some of them looked daffy, some looked like geniuses. Some held doors for her and some let doors slam in her face. Some were homosexuals and some gave her lascivious up-and-downs. Why were they students, and not she? She would sometimes leave her children with her sister, Ana María, who loved them, and then go sneaking into the big libraries of the university and sit thumbing through their books. She pretended that she was enrolled in the college and she would nod and say hello to her fellow students. She would daydream about the nature of the world and the way it was set up. Why was it that her father dropped dead on a stairway, in the midst of an exhausting work day, his heart sad from all his troubles? Why did the severe librarian with the bifocals pushed down low on his pointy nose watch her with suspicion? Why wasn’t her Papi standing in one of those classrooms, lecturing about the rise of the Popes of Avignon, instead of rotting in the ground? Why was it that she would walk home, dreading the fact that her husband, whom she loved very much, was lost in his own world of pain and music? Why was it that she would spend long periods of silence around him, because he never seemed to be interested in what she had to say and in the books she read? Why was it that when mambo time came around, when the house filled with musicians and their wives and the record player was turned up, why did she act willingly like a slave, attending to all the men, and yet feel no satisfaction or closeness to the women, like her sister, Ana María, and Pablo’s wife, Miriam, who went happily about the business of cooking and happily rushed into the living room with trays of food? Why did she end up sitting on the couch, watching the crowd of happy dancers, with her arms folded on her lap and shaking no, no, no each time someone like her brother-in-law would take her by the wrist and pull her up to dance? Why did she open the door to her apartment in the Bronx one day and find Giovanni, that nice Italian fellow from the plant, standing there with his face puffy and hat in hand to tell her that her Papi was dead? Why was it that she liked to get lost in books like the one she was reading one night, Mark Twain’s Huckleberry Finn, when she felt her husband lying alongside her, his fingers searching between her legs and his mouth suddenly upon her breast? Why was it that she no longer felt the same compulsion to do exactly what he wanted, to lift him out of his pain? She didn’t know why, and she did all the right things for him, opening her robe all the way and planting kisses on his manly chin and chest and down below, where those kisses made him dissolve quickly."|"The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love"|"Oscar Hijuelos"

Around three-thirty it would rain for half an hour, a torrential downpour that would get the river really churning, and he would sit on the porch dozing in enjoyment of that sound (the rain, the river) until the sun came back out and he would bathe, wedging himself against some rocks, as there was usually a powerful and swift current, float on his back and daydream. Kids swimming all around him, kids jumping in from the bank and from the sweet-smelling trees. He’d stay there until it got too crowded for his taste. Around five-thirty the workers from the cannery would come down and jump in and that’s when he would gather up his things and go back to the house."|"The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love"|"Oscar Hijuelos"
"ap ~ 05:30"|"Around five-thirty"|"There were others. One of these ladies was just for fun. Every year or so, he would fly down to San Juan, Puerto Rico (wincing as the pilot would announce they were flying over the eastern tip of Cuba), and from there take a rickety shuttle plane to Mayagüez, a beautiful city way out on the west coast of the island. He’d take a public car up into the mountains, where time seemed to dissolve, where farmers led their animals down the roads and men still rode horses, until he reached the town where this woman lived. He’d met her at a dance in the Bronx in 1962 and that was the year he first went to bed with her, first walked the dirt road of her town and saw the powerful river rushing downstream from the Dole pineapple cannery. He always had a nice time. She had two grown children and didn’t want anything from the Mambo King but companionship. He would bring her gifts—dresses, earrings and bracelets, and perfume, and transistor radios. One year, he made her the gift of a television set.

"ap ~ 03:00"|"about three"|"Feeling restless, he was unable to get much work done that Saturday. The Mambo King hung around the workroom, listening to the radio and organizing the papers in his desk, until about three, when he decided to go out to the Shamrock bar."|"The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love"|"Oscar Hijuelos"
21:00|"nine in the evening"|"The opening turned out to be a grand success. Unbridled in their enthusiasm, the crowd danced and drank from nine in the evening until four-thirty in the morning. Even the sidewalk was jammed with people. It was as crowded as the sidewalk outside a funeral parlor during a wake, and as noisy, too. When the band inside wasn’t playing, the jukebox put the music of Beny More right out into the street. With their bellies full, heads woozy from booze, feet danced out, the customers left, happily promising the proud owner that they would return."|"The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love"|"Oscar Hijuelos"

"~ 05:00"|"around five that morning"|"Then, around five that morning, a Sunday, when most people’s thoughts were turning toward God and the Eucharist, Pérez bid everyone good night. At that point the opening party had dwindled down to Cesar, Pablito, Manny, Bernardito, and Frankie, who had manned the bar for the night. And there was Eugenio, twenty-one years old and attending college, who had worked in the kitchen. As Pérez left, he told them, “I have something for you. Just stick around for a few minutes.” And so they did, and for all their exhaustion and yawning, they were suddenly awake again as three comely young women in glittering silver-sequined miniskirts walked into the club, removed their garments, and started to dance."|"The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love"|"Oscar Hijuelos"
00:00|midnight|"The club ended up doing its main business on Saturday nights. For the rest of the week, the Mambo King depended on the local beer drinkers and college students who would come in for his dinner specials. He also rented the club out for private parties, gave the space free to the local church for special cabaret nights, and on several occasions held fund-raisers. But Wednesday nights were reserved for jam sessions. Eating and drinking and paying cheap prices, the musicians who’d turn up at midnight used the Club Havana as a second home, jamming until four in the morning, just like the jam sessions Cesar used to attend at the little beach clubs near Havana. Sitting up on one of the high stools by the bar, cigar burning blue between his thick thumb and index finger, he smiled and nodded at his customers, applauded loudly for the young musicians who would take the stage. Over the years, the bright stage lights had sensitized his eyes, and so he always wore his green sunglasses. Behind the dark lenses, his eyes looked as if they were underwater, and though his jowlish face seemed languorously absorbed in the proceedings, he often drifted off into a reverie of songs that he might write, about love, women, family."|"The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love"|"Oscar Hijuelos"

16:00|"four in the afternoon"|"Usually Cesar would just bring these visitors upstairs to meet the family, but between the club and the building, his days were long and full and he had little time to relax, to visit Delores and Pedro and the kids, to watch Delores adoringly whenever she walked across a room. If he worked until four in the afternoon, he was lucky to get an hour’s nap. Then, dressed, he’d make his way over to the Club Havana. Although he was often tired, he’d gotten used to the routine."|"The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love"|"Oscar Hijuelos"
04:00|"four in the morning"|"And the brothers? While Rafael, the older brother, liked to go downtown on his nights off, visiting friends (they would sometimes come up to drink cheaply on evenings when Rafael was waiting tables) and going to jazz clubs in the Village (the Half Note on Spring Street being a favorite), Rico would put on his blue pinstriped Macy’s suit and head off to the subway, smelling all sweet from a rose-honey cologne; a nice story really, a romance involving a girl he had known back in Cuba, with whom he hooked up again. She lived in New Jersey with her family. He’d go out to see her a few nights a week, slicking back his hair and preening himself before the mirror. He’d ride home on the PATH trains at four in the morning, moving quietly through the house, not wanting to disturb anyone. Usually the Mambo King would be awake and sitting at the kitchen table with Frankie or one of his other friends, speaking quietly, the man fighting sleep, or he might be sitting in the living room watching television or, pad in hand, going over some old arrangement that he was trying to remember. Or he’d be trying to write a song."|"The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love"|"Oscar Hijuelos"
00:00|midnight|"But with this new management came a whole new clientele. Sports from Brooklyn who would double-park their lavender Cadillacs out on the street and who wore thick gold chains around their necks. They’d sit at their tables and pull out thick wads of twenty-dollar bills, and they favored “soul” music whose bottom-heavy bass lines nearly blew out the jukebox speakers. Bands were featured only one night a week now, Saturdays. Slowly the number of old Latin standards began to dwindle, and so did the number of older customers. And they were generous, giving out big tips and always buying the “boss,” Cesar Castillo, drinks. By midnight he would find himself leaving the club with Frankie by his side, so drunk that he sometimes could not see across the street. It was on one of those nights that he had another beautiful dream: the Club Havana was burning down, but it was a silent fire, like embers in the incinerator, without sirens or shattering glass, just the place burning up with all the bad people inside. Sometimes he would just make it to his stoop and sit there wishing that the club would burn."|"The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love"|"Oscar Hijuelos"
"~ 01:00"|"about one in the morning"|"Having watched the match on Friday Night Fight of the Week, the Mambo King waited for his friend Giovanni, who lived in the building next door, to come home, saw him walking up the street about one in the morning with his son, carrying a canvas bag. He raced down the stairs just to say, “I saw what happened. How is he?”"|"The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love"|"Oscar Hijuelos"

Then she wrote to say that her ballet company was going to be appearing in Montreal, Canada, in a production of Giselle with Alicia Alonso. Now in her early thirties, she had something to do with running the corps de ballet, and would he like to see her in that wintry city? Yes, he wrote. They made the arrangements and he bought a ticket, but the morning of the flight to Montreal he allowed his symptoms to blossom, and he could not move from his bed, and settled for a long, static-ridden conversation with his daughter at ten-thirty in the evening. His voice tired and trying to explain the pains in his body and the pains in his heart."|"The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love"|"Oscar Hijuelos"

The bride’s father was reminiscing by the bar, and taking his time. It was just as well: the musicians were exhausted, particularly Manny, slumped in his chair and whispering, “When is that man finally going to pay us, huh?”"|"The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love"|"Oscar Hijuelos"

03:30|"three-thirty in the morning"|"He was good to her and this affected Lydia like music, turning her bones into humming pipes and making honey drip out her valves. He was so happy with her he didn’t want to play jobs anymore, because that took time away from her. After a job, and anxious to see her, he would turn up at her apartment at three-thirty in the morning, carrying a wilting bouquet of flowers and a bag of party leftovers. With keys to her apartment, he would quietly open the door and make his way to her pink bedroom. Sometimes she was up waiting for him, sometimes she was fast asleep and the Mambo King, forgetting all his troubles, would strip down to his shorts and his sleeveless T-shirt and climb into bed beside her, falling asleep with his white-haired arms wrapped around her."|"The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love"|"Oscar Hijuelos"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"He slipped in and out of these moods. One Friday night, while toweling himself off after a bath, he daydreamed about Lydia. She was going to turn up at eight and they would go to a movie on Broadway, eat a nice dinner, and then go to bed together. He imagined her taut nipple in his mouth, kissing her quivering thigh. When she came, her whole body shuddered in waves, as if the building was shaking. That was something nice to remember, something nice to look forward to. That, and some of the flan Delores said she was going to make for him. Cesar really liked that flan, and so he decided that after having a drink he would go upstairs to visit his brother’s widow."|"The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love"|"Oscar Hijuelos"
"ap > 07:00"|"past seven"|"He needed to rest, but it was past seven, and so he made himself another drink. Better to drink than to take those pills. He sat thinking about Lydia. Promised to reform. Yes, it was those pills making him act cruelly toward her. So, calmly, he went into his bathroom, took the pills, and flushed them down the toilet. Better to just drink, he told himself. Feeling tense, he went upstairs to get a piece of the flan. After so many years he still felt an attraction to Delores, and could not help but greet her with a fast little slap to the ass. But times were changing. When he had done that playfully with Leticia, she had chided him, saying, “A polite man doesn’t do that, especially an uncle.”"|"The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love"|"Oscar Hijuelos"

Around eight-thirty he started to get worried and went downstairs again to wait.

The florist? Or one of those men who stood on the corners giving her the eye and wondering what she was doing with the old man. If he could have ran up to the Bronx like a young hound, he would have.

He sat by the phone, and when it didn’t ring, he said to himself, To hell with her. But a few hours later he felt that he had been stupid and cruel and that he was going to burst unless he could do something to get rid of the bad feelings inside him. He began slowly to understand what had plagued his younger brother those years before, this pressing melancholia. He fell asleep without having tasted more than a bit of flan; he felt something like a bloody rag being pulled through his body. It was a funny thing, pain. The pain was sharp enough that he somehow felt more slender, rather than so heavy. The pains multiplied and were so bad that he wanted to get up out of his bed but could not move. He wanted some of the pills he’d gotten on the sly for toothaches, but each time he moved, the pain got worse. Around six in the morning, the sun started to shine through the windows, and the sunlight gave him strength and he managed with a great shove to get up off the bed. Then, in an epic show of will, and clinging to the walls, he made it to the bathroom."|"The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love"|"Oscar Hijuelos"
"~ 15:00"|"around three in the afternoon"|"It had taken me a long time to finally work up the nerve to call Desi Arnaz. About a year ago, when I had written to him about my uncle, he was kind enough to send his condolences and ended that letter with an invitation to his home. When I finally decided to take him up on his offer and flew to Los Angeles, where I stayed in a motel near the airport, I had wanted to call him every day for two weeks. But I was afraid that his kindness would turn into air, like so many other things in this life, or that he would be different from what I had imagined. Or he would be cruel or disinterested, or simply not really concerned about visitors like me. Instead, I drank beer by the motel swimming pool and passed my days watching jet planes crossing the sky. Then I made the acquaintance of one of the blondes by the pool, and she seemed to have a soft spot for guys like me, and we fell desperately in love for a week. Then ended things badly. But one afternoon, a few days later, while I was resting in bed and looking through my father’s old book, Forward America!, just the contact of my thumb touching the very pages that he—and my uncle—had once turned (the spaces in all the little letters were looking at me like sad eyes) motivated me to pick up the telephone. Once I’d arranged the visit, my next problem was to get out to Belmont. On the map, it was about thirty miles north of San Diego along the coast, but I didn’t drive. So I ended up on a bus that got me into Belmont around three in the afternoon. Then I took a cab and soon found myself standing before the entranceway to Desi Arnaz’s estate."|"The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love"|"Oscar Hijuelos"

In the Hotel Splendour he remembered that one of his favorite jam sessions took place when Benny the conga player invited him over to the Museum of Natural History, where he worked, in his reincarnated life, as a guard. Around nine one night, when it was really dead, Cesar showed up with a few other musicians and they ended up playing in a small office just off the Great Hall of Dinosaurs, Benny playing the drums and a fellow named Rafael strumming a guitar and Cesar singing and blowing the trumpet, this music echoing and humming through the bones of those prehistoric creatures—the Stegosaurus and Tyrannosaurus Rex and Brontosaurus and woolly mammoth, breathing heavy in the vastness of that room and click-clacking onto the marble floors melodies caught in their great hooked jaws and in the curve of their gargantuan spinal columns."|"The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love"|"Oscar Hijuelos"
