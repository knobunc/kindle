Abed, he was always acutely aware of the fact that after one A.M. all phone calls, in or out, were going to ring their trouble in his ear. He could also imagine trouble that would never get to the telephone, and this was worse. He was worried about Leila Hull, in 203. The owner had said the hell with it, he’d take the risk. But Morgan Lake was taking the risk: it slept with him. While Rose, his wife, breathed deep in the other bed, looking happier than she ever looked by day. Morgan Lake turned over. A phrase came mocking into his head, “No bed of Rose’s.”"|"The Seventeen Widows of Sans Souci"|"Charlotte Armstrong"
