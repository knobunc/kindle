Klimt led Werthen to the American, who was holding his own court from an easy chair at one end of the room. Numerous other notables were gathered here, as well, Werthen noticed, including the writer Arthur Schnitzler, the peace activist Baroness Bertha Kinsky von Suttner, the Countess Misa Wydenbruck-Esterházy, and the musicians Theodor Leschetizky and Ossip Gabrilowitsch."|"The Empty Mirror"|"J.

After the cavalry came a group of lancers, dressed in blue and gold, followed by a mourning coach drawn by six horses, bearing the emperor himself, aided by his daughters Marie Valerie and Gisela. As he descended, the old man looked bowed and broken by this final-one hoped-calamity in his long life. He had withstood assassination attempts, a troubled marriage to the aloof Elisabeth, and the tragic deaths of his brother, Maximilian, in Mexico, and his son, Crown Prince Rudolf, dead by his own hand in 1889."|"The Empty Mirror"|"J.

He handed Luccheni a note and left the park. Unfortunately, just at that time, the other half of the pair of police watching Luccheni had had to retire to the nearest pissoir on the Ring. Thus the police had been unable to trace the further movements of this other man.

That should allow us to arrive in time for early breakfast tomorrow morning.”"|"The Empty Mirror"|"J. Sydney Jones"
13:35|"one thirty-five that afternoon"|"“In the event,” Gross continued, after declining dessert for himself, “the empress visited the baroness on the ninth and came to Geneva that same day, putting up at the Hotel Beau-Rivage. The following day she purchased a player piano and rolls of music at Baker’s, on the rue Bonivard. You see, Werthen, though she was little at home in Vienna, she never forgot her husband. That final gift was intended for him. At any rate, by one thirty-five that afternoon, the empress was on her way from her hotel, the Beau-Rivage, and walking along the Quai du Mont-Blanc toward the steamer Geneva, which would take her back to her Swiss base in Territet, at the other end of Lake Geneva. She had, so the French papers reported, sent her entourage by train ahead of her as she had a horror of processions. Thus, only a valet from the hotel, carrying the empress’s cloak and traveling case, and the Countess Sztaray were accompanying her as they passed the Brunswick monument on their way to the steamer. Both the valet and the countess were walking ahead, for the empress enjoyed walking on her own, taking in the lovely view of the lake afforded from the quay. And it was there and then that the man struck.”"|"The Empty Mirror"|"J. Sydney Jones"
"ap 02:10"|"ten minutes after two"|"“Exactly. Thus, whether by accident or design, Luccheni was on the quay at the exact moment the empress passed on her way to the steamer. It seems he moved to her quickly, as if he perhaps were an autograph seeker. However, drawing near, he struck her a blow that sent the empress to her knees. The countess and valet turned just as the man ran away. They thought he was a thief, trying to steal the empress’s watch, which she wore as a broach. The countess helped the empress to her feet, and she was apparently unhurt, but somewhat shaken. She told the countess that it was nothing, and that they must hurry or miss the boat. They proceeded to the steamer, where the empress finally collapsed, and where-in the privacy of their stateroom-the countess discovered a wound over the empress’s left bosom. It was a small hole emitting a trickle of blood. By this time the steamer had already left shore and there was no doctor aboard to assist them. Appraised of the situation and the importance of the passenger, the captain turned the steamer around and returned to port, where the empress was taken on an improvised stretcher fashioned out of sailcloth and six oars back to her former suite at the Hotel Beau-Rivage. There a Doktor Golay was summoned, but there was nothing he could do. I have seen the autopsy report. The puncture wound penetrated to a depth of eight and a half centimeters, entering just above the fourth rib and breaking it with the violence of the blow. It then passed through the pericardium and struck the left ventricle of the heart. Initially, the blood released internally only, into the pericardium, and slowly enough so that the empress at first thought there was little injury to her person. But by the time she had returned to the hotel, the blood was soaking her dress. She died at ten minutes after two.”"|"The Empty Mirror"|"J. Sydney Jones"
