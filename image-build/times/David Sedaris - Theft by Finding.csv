Norman Rockwell with a five o’clock shadow. Don is complex in an odd way. “I guess you could say that I’ve always been a loner,” he says, and, “Really, my concerns are very intellectual.” He spends a lot of time telling you how smart he is, which is odd because, if you’re truly all that bright, people can usually figure it out on their own."|"Theft by Finding"|"David Sedaris"

He needed the bodyguard in case the NRA decided to retaliate for a remark he’d made in a Time Out interview. To him it made perfect sense that the National Rifle Association might send a hit man to kill Cher’s makeup artist; his political views are too extreme and sooner or later the Republicans will have to silence him. H. denied the request for a bodyguard, so Kevyn hired his own. He’s going next week to his hometown in Louisiana and called to demand that Little, Brown arrange to award him the keys to the city. The keys to the city don’t really count if you have to ask for them yourself, but H. went ahead and wrote to the mayor.

"~ 10:00"|"around ten a.m."|"The Eyewitness Travel Guide describes Budapest as a glittering jewel—“the Paris of the East.” On closer inspection, the book is full of errors. It reports, for example, that in winter the city gets only two and a half hours of sunlight a day and cranks the figure up to eight for the months of June, July, and August. I’d expected it to get dark at around ten a.m., but it turned out we had light until four in the afternoon. What they probably meant to say was that each evening, the city endures two and a half weeks of darkness. The nights feel impossibly long here, partly because it’s cold, but mainly because things are so poorly lit. Everything not pictured in our guidebook fades away once the sun sets."|"Theft by Finding"|"David Sedaris"

A few of our fellow passengers had gone missing and we couldn’t proceed until their luggage had been removed from the plane. This involved unloading the cargo hold and spreading its contents out on the runway. In groups of twenty we were instructed to disembark, identify our suitcases, and reboard. The process took over an hour, and we didn’t take off until two fifteen, by which point the whole thing had become a terrible comedy.

He’d eaten three things larger than himself and so, figuring he’d had enough for a while, I concentrated on Coretta Scott and Jerry, a new spider nesting in the window between the stove and the bathroom. It was a slow day for flies, but I managed to catch three of them. Last night I noticed a new colony of spiders on the living-room ceiling. Their webs are complex and sprawling, resembling the new art museum in Milwaukee. There were four of them, and at around midnight they started going crazy, leaping around for no reason. There was a lamp on the table beneath them and the light cast their shadows huge upon the ceiling. I caught each of them a moth and then went to check on Clifton, who was gone. His web is empty except for carcasses, and I’m wondering if he went off to mate."|"Theft by Finding"|"David Sedaris"

New York has always referred to itself as the greatest but more so after September 11. We’re the greatest, damn it. We’re the greatest, remember. You want to go along with it out of pity, but still, it’s hard. At two p.m. it takes an hour and a half to get from Kennedy to SoHo in the greatest city in the world.
