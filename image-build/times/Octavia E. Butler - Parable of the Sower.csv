13:00|13|"At 13, my brother Marcus has become the only person in the family whom I would call beautiful. Girls his age stare at him when they think he’s not looking. They giggle a lot around him and chase him like crazy, but he sticks to Robin. She’s not pretty at all—all skin and bones and brains—but she’s funny and sensible. In a year or two, she’ll start to fill out and my brother will get beauty along with all those brains. Then, if the two of them are still together, their lives will get a lot more interesting."|"Parable of the Sower"|"Octavia E. Butler"

"< 00:00"|"nearly midnight"|"It was nearly midnight when I woke Harry, gave him the gun and the watch, and made him as uncomfortable as I could by warning him about the dogs, the gunfire, and the many people who wandered around at night. He did look awake and alert enough when I lay down."|"Parable of the Sower"|"Octavia E. Butler"
"ap 03:40"|Three-forty|"“What time is it?” I asked Zahra who had Harry’s watch.
“Three-forty,” she said.
“Let me have the gun,” I said. “Your watch is almost over anyway.”"|"Parable of the Sower"|"Octavia E. Butler"
"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"We passed through Hollister before noon. We resupplied there, not knowing when we would see well-equipped stores again. We had already discovered that several of the small communities shown on the maps no longer existed—had not existed for years. The earthquake had done a lot of damage in Hollister, but the people hadn’t gone animal. They seemed to be helping one another with repairs and looking after their own destitute. Imagine that."|"Parable of the Sower"|"Octavia E. Butler"
12:00|noon|"At our noon stop on Tuesday, Tori and Doe, the two little girls, went away from the group to urinate. Emery went with them. She had kind of taken charge of Doe as well as her own daughter. The night before, she and Grayson Mora had slipped away from the group and stayed away for over an hour. Harry and I were on watch, and we saw them go. Now they were a couple—all over each other, but at arm’s length from everyone else. Strange people."|"Parable of the Sower"|"Octavia E. Butler"
11:00|"11 A.M."|"We didn’t reach Clear Lake the next morning. To tell the truth it was already the next morning when we went to sleep. We were too tired and sore to get up at dawn—which came early in the second watch. Only the need for water made us move out when we did—at a hot, smoky 11 A.M."|"Parable of the Sower"|"Octavia E.
