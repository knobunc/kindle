00:00|midnight|"Maybe one of his minions gave a sign to those women, that fanatical band of old crones whose purpose in life was to oblige us in Colchis to live just as our ancestors had done, down to the smallest detail. We didn’t take them seriously, that was a mistake; all at once there came into existence in Colchis a distribution of power that was favorable to those women, so that they believed their time had come. Delighted by the King’s revival of the old laws, now they wanted to see them followed to all their conclusions, for only one of the two, the King or his proxy, could survive, and when it was midnight and your day as King ended, brother, they passed through an entrance that on that night, oddly enough, wasn’t guarded—as they, oddly enough, knew—and burst into your chambers, where they were able to find you defenseless in your bath and kill you, singing their bloodcurdling songs all the while. Such was the custom in the olden days, to which we, too, had appealed because we thought they promised us an advantage. And ever since I shudder at the thought of those old days and the forces they released in us, forces we could then no longer control. At some point this killing of the proxy King, which everyone approved of, including the victim himself—at some point this must have turned into murder, and if your fearful death has taught me anything, brother, it’s that we can’t deal with the fragments of the past any way we like, piecing them together or ripping them apart just to suit our convenience. And insofar as I didn’t prevent that, and even promoted it, then to that extent I was an accomplice in your death. Agameda meant something else when she accused me recently, but I still turned pale. I blanch every time I think about you, brother, and about this death that drove me away from Colchis. Agameda has no idea. Hates me blindly. But why does she hate me. Why am I hated."|Medea|"Christa Wolf"
