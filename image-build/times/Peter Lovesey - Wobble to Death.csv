He had covered 61 miles. Chadwick still walked resolutely on, but had been forcing his pace to make 60 miles, and the crowd were already barracking him. Never a  popular figure, he was ready for this treatment, but could rarely have been so far down in a race, even at this early stage. To more whistles he stepped off the track, and a dress-ing-gown was wrapped around him by Harvey, before he withdrew into his pavilion for luncheon. Other runners, less provided for, lay in the centre of the arena sipping at bot-tles while trainers or friends massaged them devotedly. The majority took no break, except to answer nature’s call.

These marathon contests were traditionally slow to  attract interest from Press and public, yet the duel between Darrell and Chadwick was already drawing spectators, and the news of Chadwick’s dramatic rejection of heel-and-toe would make sensational reading in the sporting Press.

If Monk were eliminated, as he had to be now, the possibility of the murderer adding the poison to the drink while Darrell was in the tent was remote. So it was probably done some time during Mon-day, when Monk and Darrell were occupied with the race."|"Wobble to Death"|"Peter Lovesey"
12:00|noon|"‘That’s right. Point is, I need to interview him. Straighten out some facts, you know. When’s he coming off the track?’ Harvey was dubious. ‘He comes off at noon, for about twenty minutes, but he won’t welcome questions. He needs all the time for his lunch.’"|"Wobble to Death"|"Peter Lovesey"
"ap 00:00"|twelve|"‘I understand. Shan’t keep him long. I’ll be here at twelve, then. Oh, and er—Mr Harvey.’"|"Wobble to Death"|"Peter Lovesey"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"Mostyn-Smith had spent the morning devising, and dis-missing, theories. They had so preoccupied him that he walked for six minutes longer than his schedule allowed, time that he could ill-afford. He had decided, in his thoughtful circumambulations, to sacrifice a portion of his next rest-period and examine O’Flaherty’s new hut. There, surely, was where the murderer would bait his trap. The Irishman had not left the track for lunch before one o’clock on any of the previous days, so it should be possible to make a careful inspection without being disturbed."|"Wobble to Death"|"Peter Lovesey"
"ap < 02:00"|"nearly two o’clock"|"Cribb’s announcement at first depressed Thackeray, who did not usually fast on Fridays, or any other day. But he brightened when the proposal became clearer. They were to discuss their findings over battered fish in the Hall restaurant.
It was nearly two o’clock, so they had the room almost to themselves.
‘Trouble with this lot,’ said Cribb, ‘is the lies.’ His usual staccato utterances were separated by periods of chewing. ‘Too many folk with things to hide.’"|"Wobble to Death"|"Peter Lovesey"
"< 00:00"|"near midnight"|"‘He must have waited till near midnight, when the crowd had left, but while Darrell was still on the track. The light would be poorer then, too.’"|"Wobble to Death"|"Peter Lovesey"
"~ 00:00"|"About midnight"|"‘Wednesday night—’ Thackeray’s eyes widened in reali-sation. ‘About midnight, Sarge. The same blinking time!’"|"Wobble to Death"|"Peter Lovesey"
"ap 01:00"|"One o’clock"|"‘One o’clock. I had a bite, and changed my footgear. I keep a spare pair, you see.’"|"Wobble to Death"|"Peter Lovesey"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"‘I felt obliged to warn him of the dangers to which he was exposed, as the only possible rival to Captain Chadwick. I reasoned that whoever had killed poor Darrell would not balk at murdering anyone else who threatened to overtake the Captain. I therefore approached this—man to acquaint him with my fears. I roused him before four o’clock and we conversed about the matter.’"|"Wobble to Death"|"Peter Lovesey"
"~ 12:00"|"about mid-day"|"‘I believe that I know who tampered with O’Flaherty’s boots,’ he muttered confidentially. ‘At about mid-day—or twenty-seven minutes past to be specific—I approached his hut with a view to checking that his food and drink had not been poisoned. I had deduced that the murderer would attack O’Flaherty next, you understand, and it seemed to me obvious that he would employ some form of poisoning again. I approached the hut from the rear, and as I turned from the side of the building I saw someone come out of the hut, and move quickly away to the track.’"|"Wobble to Death"|"Peter Lovesey"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"‘Oh yes,’ Herriott remembered. ‘And he was running, to everyone’s surprise. He has always walked every yard of the way before.’
‘He kept going till one o’clock?’
‘Yes. I’m sure of that. Darrell went to his tent at the same time.’"|"Wobble to Death"|"Peter Lovesey"
"ap 10:00"|"Ten o’clock"|"‘What time was this?’
‘Ten o’clock, approximately.’
‘And you returned . . . ?’"|"Wobble to Death"|"Peter Lovesey"

‘A few minutes after midnight.’
‘Where did you have your dinner, sir? Pardon the ques-tion. I must know everyone’s whereabouts.’"|"Wobble to Death"|"Peter Lovesey"

"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"‘Don’t suppose he will be before one o’clock. Harvey should be here by then. Strict on their duties, these military men. Now how about the strychnine hunt? Any reports come in?’"|"Wobble to Death"|"Peter Lovesey"
"> 23:00"|"after eleven that evening"|"Harvey re-entered the Hall carrying a paper parcel soon after eleven that evening. He was instantly recognised by the constable on duty at the Islington Green gate and hus-tled to the police office where Cribb and Thackeray were waiting."|"Wobble to Death"|"Peter Lovesey"
14:00|"two in the afternoon"|"‘Far as I can recall,’ Harvey began, ‘I was by the track all evening, following the race. The Captain was behaving strange-like—he was running, you see. He has always walked his races, even when the articles allow mixing. But he fell badly behind Darrell that first day. Even some of the slow mob were ahead of him and by two in the afternoon he’d taken to running. Now I knew this running would give him no end of trouble—’"|"Wobble to Death"|"Peter Lovesey"
"ap 01:00"|one|"‘Well, I kept near, in case. As it happened, he suffered a bit, but he didn’t go down. And he won back a lot of the ground. Darrell was in some kind of trouble with his feet, and that gave a fillip to the Captain. He kept going until Darrell came off at one, and then we both went into the tent.’"|"Wobble to Death"|"Peter Lovesey"
"ap ~ 03:30"|"about three-thirty"|"‘Yes, about three-thirty. He sat with me. He must have just come in from outside because he was darned cold. Funny thing, he wanted to fix something up with me. He thought the pace was too warm. If I would hold the Captain back he’d tell Darrell to take things easy. I wouldn’t have it though. I can’t give orders to the Captain like some of them trainers do with their guv’nors. So it was no deal. And blow me, when they got back on track bloody Darrell set off like a hare before hounds.’"|"Wobble to Death"|"Peter Lovesey"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"‘So you were out there watching him every step of the way?’
‘I was, until one o’clock, when he came off.’
‘Did you see anything of Sam Monk that night?’ asked Cribb."|"Wobble to Death"|"Peter Lovesey"
05:00|"five in the morning"|"THACKERAY COULD NOT BE certain that the night was the coldest that week, but he knew positively that he had not passed such an uncomfortable four hours since he gave up beat-pounding. There was a paraffin stove in the police office. His boot-welts were so near the flame that smoke rose from them. But his toes stayed bloodless all night. He had borrowed a spare great-coat and tried to insulate his already heavily clad body by tucking it around him as he settled in the one available armchair. It was no substitute for a heavy quilt over a decent horse-hair mattress. So he shiv-ered and grumbled and shifted his bulky form about the creaking framework until five in the morning, when the duty constable put a mug of coffee in his hands. He sipped it dolefully."|"Wobble to Death"|"Peter Lovesey"
"ap > 01:00"|"After one o’clock"|"‘After one o’clock, when they all came off the track. There was no sign of Harvey, you see.’"|"Wobble to Death"|"Peter Lovesey"
12:00|mid-day|"Chadwick, deprived of his menial, had to adjust to new conditions—not easy in the final stages of a test of  endurance. For the first time he appeared on the track unshaven. If he wanted water he would have to get it him-self from the communal tap by the huts. At dawn he had coped without using any, but at mid-day, when he usually stopped for lunch, he would face the fifty yard walk if he wanted refreshment. The position of his tent, for so long an advantage, had become a handicap."|"Wobble to Death"|"Peter Lovesey"
"> 12:00"|"Shortly after mid-day"|"And there was another, worse setback to follow. Shortly after mid-day a constable arrived at the office with Sol Her-riott in tow. The promoter was in a state of great agitation. ‘You must do something,’ he yelled at Thackeray. ‘All the prize money—he’s taken it all. Everything! A thousand pounds, near enough. My race is in ruins—hopeless. They’ve been running for six days and I can’t pay them a penny. They’ll kill me when they find out.’"|"Wobble to Death"|"Peter Lovesey"
19:00|"seven o’clock that evening"|"CRIBB DID NOT get back to Islington as early as he planned. Jacobson’s arrest made certain formalities neces-sary. The prisoner was taken to a police station and charged with theft. And after a long wrangle it was conceded by the local force that Cribb should take custody of Jacobson. Then the detectives sat down to their first meal since break-fast. By seven o’clock that evening they were ready to return."|"Wobble to Death"|"Peter Lovesey"
"ap > 09:00"|"a few minutes after nine o’clock"|"The carriage reached Islington High Street a few minutes after nine o’clock. The isolating barrier of fog had muffled all sound, but now there was shouting immediately outside. The carriage halted on the fringe of an ugly, jostling mob. Cribb opened the door with difficulty, settled the fare, and, taking a tight grip on Jacobson’s upper arm, guided him towards the Hall entrance. But it was there that the crowd was converging. They were people who had been refused admittance. Every seat, every standing place, a harassed offi-cial was trying to explain, was taken. Nobody else would be allowed in."|"Wobble to Death"|"Peter Lovesey"
"< 00:00"|"Before midnight"|"‘Come on Thackeray,’ said Cribb. ‘We’ll get him down to the local station. He needs a rest—even if it is in a cell. What’s the time? Before midnight is it? Just made it in the six days.’"|"Wobble to Death"|"Peter Lovesey"
00:05|"12.05 A.M."|"THE 12.05 A.M. TRUNDLED out of Highbury and Islington station and along the line. Its rhythmic snorts were replaced by unmechanical sounds. Harsh, stomach-wrenching coughs echoed in the tunnel leading to the platform. Then the clatter of heavily shod boots and shoes. The unexpected influx of midnight passengers massed at the barrier, every one muffled to the eyebrows and topped with a cap or bowler. A ticket collector, scowling under his cheese-cutter, came out to draw back the grille. They filed through, out of the booking-hall and into a dense fog."|"Wobble to Death"|"Peter Lovesey"

There—in atmos-phere made denser by tobacco smoke—beer and boisterous conversation revived them and some of the athletes as well. Others, more Spartan in their preparation, found their quarters, where their trainers began massaging them with flesh-brushes. The race was due to start at one, in fifteen minutes, and continue until the following Saturday night."|"Wobble to Death"|"Peter Lovesey"
"ap 02:50"|two-fifty|"The older runner eyed Billy’s muscled physique before delivering his verdict.
‘If you make two-fifty you’ll be on your bloody knees.’
IN THE HALL the gas was being turned up, a cue for competi-tors and officials to make their way to the start. Glasses were emptied at the bar. The Press representatives emerged warmer and more receptive. Through the mist in the direction of the huts came the athletes. The majority moved more like sacrificial victims than gladiators striding into the arena. Even allowing for pre-race nerves and the numbing cold, they made a bizarre spectacle. Several were clearly overweight for dis-tance running. Others were emaciated and senile by sporting standards. Perhaps eight, including Billy Reid, looked likely to survive the first few hours of the race. With trainers in atten-dance, applying frantic eleventh-hour massage, they grouped apprehensively in the centre of the arena like penned sheep."|"Wobble to Death"|"Peter Lovesey"

Be sure to air the new pair for at least two hours. And I shall want you to have a sponge and vinegar ready in case I require it later, when the walking heats my body. You may put on my boots now. Lace them firmly, but not tightly.’"|"Wobble to Death"|"Peter Lovesey"
