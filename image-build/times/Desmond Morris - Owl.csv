12:00|noon-day|"In Henry vii, Part iii there is a telling line where Shakespeare has the king speak like an ancient Roman: ‘The owl shriek’d at thy birth, an evil sign . . .’. In Julius Caesar he confirms his knowledge of the role of the owl in Roman legend, when he has Caesar say ‘yesterday the bird of night did sit, even at noon-day, upon the market-place, hooting and shrieking’, and Caesar concludes that these ‘are portentous things’."|Owl|"Desmond Morris"
12:00|noon|"It is by some supposed that our Owls,
By Day-time are no perfect sighted Fowls;
And that the more you do augment the light,
The more you shall deprive them of their sight.
Nor candles, Torches, nor the sun at noon,
Nor spectacles, nor all of these in one,
Can make an Owlet in the day-time see,
Though none, by night, hath better eyes than she.3"|Owl|"Desmond Morris"
12:00|"high noon"|"One starless night two moles are accosted by an owl. Astonished that he can detect them even in the pitch darkness, they hurry to tell the other animals of his great

wisdom. A secretary bird decides to test this and asks the owl for another expression for the word ‘namely’. ‘To wit’ says the owl. ‘And why does a lover call on his love?’ asks the secretary bird. ‘To woo’ says the owl. Deeply impressed by the owl’s extensive knowledge, the secretary bird tells all the other animals. They decide that the owl must be God and they follow him everywhere he goes. They even follow him when, at high noon, he starts walking down the middle of a highway. Because he cannot see in the bright sunlight he does not notice a truck approaching and is killed along with many of his gullible followers."|Owl|"Desmond Morris"
"~ 02:50"|"about 250 hours"|"To find New World tribal owls that are portrayed simply for their own sake, as attractive birds without any haunting messages, we have to move south to the Central American country of Panama. There, among the Kuna Indians who inhabit the small islands of the San Blas Archipelago off the northern coast, there is a fascination with birds of many kinds, including the local owls. Images of the owls, and many other animals besides, appear on the clothing of the women who, unlike their male counterparts, have stubbornly retained the traditional costumes of their tribe, even in modern times. They wear decorative chest panels on their dresses, called molas. These are laboriously created by a process of reverse appliqué. It takes about 250 hours of meticulous needlework to complete a good example of one of these molas and they have recently become collected as serious works of tribal art."|Owl|"Desmond Morris"
19:42|1942|"Owls appear several times in the work of Belgian surrealist René Magritte. Their first portrayal is in a sombre work from 1942, called The Companions of Fear. Painted in Brussels during the Nazi occupation of Belgium it depicts a desolate, rocky landscape in which plants are stubbornly breaking through the hard surface. Five of these plants have blossomed, not into flowers, but into green owls. The leaves, as they rise up vertically from the ground, are gradually transformed into the bodies of the owls, creating a leaf/bird hybrid. The image, as in much of Magritte’s work, is disturbing because it plays tricks with one’s mind. In a letter to a friend, written some years before, the artist commented: ‘I have made a really striking discovery in painting. Up to now . . . the position of an object was sometimes enough to make it mysterious. But as a result of the experiments I’ve made here, I have found a new potential in things – their ability to become gradually something else, an object merging into an object other than itself . . . By this means I produce pictures which the eye must “think” in a completely different way from the usual one.’14"|Owl|"Desmond Morris"
12:00|noon|"One of the great misconceptions about owls is that they cannot see in bright light. This supposed weakness has been the basis for legends and folktales for centuries, but it is simply not true. In fact, the majestic eagle owl has slightly better daytime vision than human beings. The pupils of owls can close right down to pin-pricks, through which a greatly reduced amount of sunlight is allowed to penetrate, enabling them to see even at noon."|Owl|"Desmond Morris"
00:00|Midnight|"In the 1960s some tests were carried out to discover which owls had the best hearing. The results showed that those species living in northern forests had better hearing than those from the tropics. This makes sense when one thinks of what it must be like to hunt at night in a northern pine forest, compared with a tropical rain forest. Midnight in a cold northern forest must be as silent as the grave, where even a mouse’s footstep could be heard by a hovering owl. Midnight in a tropical rain forest, on the other hand, with the night air filled with chirping insects and calling frogs, would be much too noisy for an owl to isolate a particular prey by its sounds alone. For tropical owls the half-light of dawn and dusk would inevitably

become more important hunting times, when vision could play a bigger role in detecting their prey."|Owl|"Desmond Morris"
12:00|noonday|"Burrowing owls are active by day as well as at dawn and dusk and are the least nocturnal of all owls. They even hunt for lizards and large insects in the bright noonday sun. In keeping with their preference for living at a low level they sometimes chase their prey across the ground. In addition to animal foods, burrowing owls, uniquely among members of their family, also devour fruits and seeds. In some regions they favour cacti fruit such as those of the prickly pear."|Owl|"Desmond Morris"
