"ap 00:30"|"half past twelve"|"However, as I say, on this particular Wednesday I’m in the office, it’s half past twelve and I’m just thinking, ‘Time you were getting your skates on, Peggy,’ when suddenly the door opens and nobody comes in. I didn’t even look up. I just said, ‘Yes, Mr Slattery?’ He was on his hands and knees with a pro forma in his mouth. Anybody else would have got up. Not him. He crawls up to me, pretending to be a dog and starts begging, this bit of paper in his mouth! I thought, ‘You’re a grown man.You’ve got a son at catering college; your wife’s in and out of mental hospital and you’re begging like a dog.’ I enjoy a joke, but I didn’t laugh."|"The Complete Talking Heads"|"Alan Bennett"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’ clock"|"Surprise, surprise he’s after a favour. The bit of paper is the Squash Ladder. Would I run him off two dozen copies? i said, ‘Yes. By all means. At two o’ clock.’ He said, ‘No. Now’ Wants to put them round in the lunch hour. I said, ‘Sorry. No can do.’ I haven’t forgotten the works outing. Running round with that thing on his head. He was like a crazed animal. I said, ‘Anybody with an atom of consideration would have come down earlier. Squash Ladder! It’s half past twelve.’ He said, ‘It’s not for me.’ I said ‘Who’s it for?’ He said, ‘Mr Skidmore.’"|"The Complete Talking Heads"|"Alan Bennett"

04:00|"four o’clock in the morning"|"Now, if there’s one thing Mother and me are agreed on it’s that red is a common colour. And the whole place is done out in red. Lampshades red. Waitresses in red. Plates red, and on the tables those plastic sauce things got up to look like tomatoes. Also red. And when I look there’s a chip in the sugar. I thought, ‘Mother won’t like this.’ ‘Oh,’ she says, ‘this looks cheerful, doesn’t it, Graham?’ I said, ‘There’s a chip in the sugar.’ ‘A detail,’ he says, ‘they’re still having their teething troubles. Is it three coffees?’ I said, ‘We like tea,’ only Mother says, ‘No. I feel like an adventure. I’ll have coffee.’ He gets hold of the menu and puts his hand on hers. ‘Might I suggest,’ he says, ‘a cheeseburger?’ She said, ‘Oh, what’s that?’ He said, ‘It’s fresh country beef, mingled with golden-fried onions, topped off with toasted cheese served with french fries and lemon wedge.’ ‘Oh, lemon wedge,’ said Mother. ‘That sounds nice.’ I thought, ‘Well, I hope you can keep it down.’ Because it’ll be the pizza story all over again. One mouthful and at four o’clock in the morning I was still stuck at her bedside with the bucket. She said, ‘I like new experiences in eating. I had a pizza once, didn’t I, Graham?’ I didn’t say anything."|"The Complete Talking Heads"|"Alan Bennett"
12:00|midday|"There must be a famine on somewhere because we were just letting our midday meal go down when the vicar calls with some envelopes. Breezes in, anorak and running shoes, and he says, ‘I always look forward to coming to this house, Mrs Whittaker.’ (He’s got the idea she’s deaf, which she’s not; it’s one of the few things she isn’t.) He says, ‘Do you know why? It’s because you two remind me of Jesus and his mother.’ Well, I’ve always thought Jesus was a bit off-hand with his mother, and on one occasion I remember he was quite snotty with her, but I didn’t say anything. And of course Madam is over the moon. In her book if you can’t get compared with the Queen Mother the Virgin Mary’s the next best thing. She says, ‘Are you married?’ (She asks him every time, never remembers.) He said, ‘No, Mrs Whittaker. I am married to God.’ She says, ‘Where does that leave you with the housework?’ He said, ‘Well, I don’t do as well as your Graham. He’s got this place like a palace.’ She says, ‘Well, I do my whack. I washed four pairs of stockings this morning.’ She hadn’t. She put them in the bowl then they slipped her mind, so the rest of the operation devolved on me."|"The Complete Talking Heads"|"Alan Bennett"
"ap > 07:00"|"after seven"|"Today they went over to York. It was after seven when he dropped her off. He generally comes in but not this time. Just gives her a little kiss. She has to bend down. I said, ‘Have you had a good time?’ She said, ‘Yes. We had egg and chips, tea, bread and butter, we’ve got a lot in common and there’s a grand new car park.’ I said, ‘Did you go in the Minster?’ She said, ‘No. Frank’s not keen on old buildings. We need to look more to the future. He says they’ve built a spanking new precinct in Bradford, so that’s going to be next on the agenda.You’re quiet.’ I said, ‘Well, do you wonder? Doctor Chaudhury says I should have a stable environment. This isn’t a stable environment with your fancy men popping in every five minutes.’ 
She said, ‘He isn’t my fancy man.’ I said, ‘Well, he’s your fancy man in embryo.’ She said,’You know I don’t know what that means.’ I said, ‘How old are you?’ She said, ‘I don’t know.’ I said, ‘You do know.’ She said, ‘I don’t. Tell me.’ I said, ‘You’re seventy-two.’ ‘That’s not so old. How old was Winston Churchill?’ I said, ‘When?’ She said, ‘You think you’ve got it over me, Graham Whittaker. Well, I’ll tell you something, my memory’s better with Frank. He was telling me about the economy You’ve got it all wrong.’ I said, ‘How?’ ‘I can’t remember but you have. Blaming it on the government. Frank says it’s the blacks.’ I didn’t say anything, just came upstairs."|"The Complete Talking Heads"|"Alan Bennett"

He’s all right.’ She took her things off. ‘I’m sure you could get to like him, Graham, if only you got to know him.’ I said, ‘Well, you should have brought him in.’ ‘Well, I will next time. It’d be nice if now and again we could go off as a threesome. What have you done?’ ‘Nothing,’ I said. ‘Just sat here.’ ‘You’ve been all right?’ ‘Mmm.’"|"The Complete Talking Heads"|"Alan Bennett"

Then I felt a bit wanny and Mr Ramesh let me go into the back place to lie down. I must have dozed off because when I woke up Mr Ramesh has come in and started taking off his clothes. I said, ‘What are you doing? What about the shop?’ He said, ‘Do not worry about the shop. I have closed the shop.’ I said, ‘It’s only nine.You don’t close till eleven.’ ‘I do tonight,’ he said. I said, ‘What’s tonight?’ He said, ‘A chance in a million. A turn-up for the books. Will you take your clothes off please.’ And I did."|"The Complete Talking Heads"|"Alan Bennett"

"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"Mr Ramesh has evidently been expecting me because there’s a bed made up in the storeroom upstairs. I go up first and get in. When I’m 
in bed I can put my hand out and feel the lentils running through my fingers. When he comes up he’s put on his proper clothes. Long white shirt, sash and whatnot. Loincloth underneath. All spotless. Like Jesus. Only not. I watch him undress and think about them all at Evensong and Geoffrey praying in that pausy way he does, giving you time to mean each phrase. And the fan club lapping it up, thinking they love God when they just love Geoffrey. Lighten our darkness we beseech thee O Lord and by thy great mercy defend us from all perils and dangers of this night. Like Mr Ramesh who is twenty-six with lovely legs, who goes swimming every morning at Merrion Street Baths and plays hockey for Horsforth. I ask him if they offer their sex to God. He isn’t very interested in the point but with them, so far as I can gather, sex is all part of God anyway. I can see why too. It’s the first time I really understand what all the fuss is about.
