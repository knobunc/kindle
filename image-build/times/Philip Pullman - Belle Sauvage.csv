00:30|"half past midnight"|"Coram was moving in a roundabout way towards the narrow little boardinghouse near the river where he’d rented a room, and now he slowed down by the water’s edge, where half a dozen barges were tied up at a stone embankment. It was half past midnight."|"Belle Sauvage"|"Philip Pullman"
"< 12:00"|"Towards midday"|"The next day was a Saturday, and a rare dry day with occasional bursts of sunlight. Towards midday, Hannah found her bicycle, and having pumped up the tires, she rode up the Woodstock Road and turned left at the top for Wolvercote and Godstow. She rode briskly, her dæmon sitting in the basket on the handlebars, and arrived at the Trout feeling a little out of breath and warm enough to take her coat off at once."|"Belle Sauvage"|"Philip Pullman"
12:00|midday|"At midday, she toasted a cheese sandwich in her mother’s blackened old device that hung by the fire. Then she made some more coffee and drank it this time, and then she felt a little more on top of things and managed to read for an hour or so. The rain had started up again."|"Belle Sauvage"|"Philip Pullman"
"< 16:30"|"before Vespers"|"“I’m sure you’re right,” she said, “but that’s the way it was. Her parents are important people, mind you. That had something to do with it. And I hope you haven’t been talking about it. It’s supposed to be confidential. It’s certainly private. Now, Malcolm, I really must get these accounts in order before Vespers. Off you go. We’ll talk another day.”"|"Belle Sauvage"|"Philip Pullman"
"ap 09:20"|"twenty past nine"|"At twenty past nine, there was a knock at the door, and she opened it at once and let in the man who was waiting outside in the rain."|"Belle Sauvage"|"Philip Pullman"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"“No, thank you. Don’t call me again like this. The porter at Jordan is a gossip. If you want to contact me, put a card on the notice board outside the History Faculty Library, saying simply ‘Candle.’ That will be a signal to go to the next Evensong at Wykeham. I shall be sitting alone. You will sit next to me and we can talk quietly under the music.”"|"Belle Sauvage"|"Philip Pullman"
11:00|"eleven a.m."|"Accordingly, she submitted her query on the official form, and the following day she received a note inviting her to meet the cataloger, Harry Dibdin, in his office at eleven a.m."|"Belle Sauvage"|"Philip Pullman"
19:00|"7 p.m."|"“Another white envelope,” he said.
The card inside said only “28 Staverton Road. 7 p.m.”
“Easy enough, Jesper,” she said."|"Belle Sauvage"|"Philip Pullman"
"ap 07:01"|"one minute past seven"|"At one minute past seven, after a brisk cold walk, she rang the bell of a large, comfortable-looking villa in one of the roads a little way north of Jericho. There was a thickly grown garden heavy with shrubs and trees, hard to see past from the road. She wondered if this was Papadimitriou’s own house: it would be interesting to see how this enigmatic figure lived. And who else would be there?"|"Belle Sauvage"|"Philip Pullman"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"“I would normally be working at home.”
“Come to Jordan at three o’clock.”
“Very well.”"|"Belle Sauvage"|"Philip Pullman"
"ap ~ 08:00"|"about eight o’clock"|"“He said we should go to the priory kitchen about eight o’clock. That’s all. He didn’t say why.”"|"Belle Sauvage"|"Philip Pullman"
"ap 08:00"|"Eight o’clock"|"Eight o’clock was the hour of Compline, as Malcolm knew. All the sisters would be in the oratory for the final service of the day, except for Sister Fenella, he supposed, and Sister Katarina, if she was looking after Lyra."|"Belle Sauvage"|"Philip Pullman"
"~ 18:00"|Compline|"Eight o’clock was the hour of Compline, as Malcolm knew. All the sisters would be in the oratory for the final service of the day, except for Sister Fenella, he supposed, and Sister Katarina, if she was looking after Lyra."|"Belle Sauvage"|"Philip Pullman"
"ap 07:30"|"half past seven"|"And the rain had set in with a fury. It fell not in drops but in sheets, and the ground was running with it, so that you couldn’t see anything solid: just flowing fields of bitter cold water. With the excuse of homework, Malcolm had gone upstairs by half past seven, and then tiptoed down again, not that anyone would have heard him above the thunderous drumming on the roof and the doors and the windows."|"Belle Sauvage"|"Philip Pullman"
