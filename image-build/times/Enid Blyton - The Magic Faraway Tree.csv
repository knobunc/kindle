"ap 10:00"|"ten o'clock"|"""Good night, Bessie!"" called back Dick. ""I can't tell you how I'm longing for to-morrow. I know I shan't be able to sleep to-night!"" But he did -and so did all the others. When Mother came up at ten o'clock she peeped in at the children, and not one was awake."|"The Magic Faraway Tree"|"Enid Blyton"
"ap 05:30"|"half-past five"|"They all went into Moon-Face's house. Jo stood on a chair, upside down. The others sat about and talked. Dick was sorry for Jo, but he couldn't help feeling a bit excited. Goodness -if this was the sort of adventure that Jo, Bessie and Fanny had, what fun things were going to be! The others began telling him all the adventures they had had. Silky made some tea, and went down the tree to fetch some more Pop Biscuits. When it was half-past five Bessie said they must go."|"The Magic Faraway Tree"|"Enid Blyton"
"< 00:00"|"just before midnight"|"And then a note came from Silky and Moon-Face. This is what it said: ""DEAR BESSIE, FANNY, JO AND DICK, ""We know that you don't want any more adventures just yet, but you might like to know that there is a most exciting land at the top of the Faraway Tree just now. It is the Land of Do-As-You-Please, even nicer than the Land of Take-What-You-Want. We are going there tonight. If you want to come, come just before midnight and you can go with us. We will wait for you till then."|"The Magic Faraway Tree"|"Enid Blyton"
"ap 11:30"|"half-past eleven"|"It was exciting to slip out of bed at half-past eleven and dress. It was very dark because there was no moon."|"The Magic Faraway Tree"|"Enid Blyton"
00:00|midnight|"""We waited till midnight and you didn't come. If you do come and we're not here, you'll find us in the Land of Do-As-You-Please."|"The Magic Faraway Tree"|"Enid Blyton"
"ap ~ 03:00"|"About three o'clock"|"""To-morrow,"" said Silky. ""About three o'clock. Will you be all right?"""|"The Magic Faraway Tree"|"Enid Blyton"
"ap 03:30"|"half-past three"|"Moon-Face looked at his clock. ""Old Saucepan is a long time,"" he said. ""It's half-past three now, and he promised to be really quick."""|"The Magic Faraway Tree"|"Enid Blyton"
"ap ~ 11:00"|"about eleven o'clock"|"""I shall bring something home for Mother,"" said Bessie. ""She wants a new purse. When can we start, Jo? I'm all ready."" They set off about eleven o'clock, when they had done all their work. They were very excited."|"The Magic Faraway Tree"|"Enid Blyton"
"ap < 00:00"|"almost twelve o'clock"|"Suddenly Jo looked at his watch. ""It's almost twelve o'clock,"" he said. ""The Land of Presents will be moving off in a minute. We'd better go. Anyway, we really can't carry anything more! Golly, what a lovely lot of things we've all got!"""|"The Magic Faraway Tree"|"Enid Blyton"
