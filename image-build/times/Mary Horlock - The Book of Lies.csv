Nic was in the front on Pete’s lap and I was in the back by the only window that worked. I was trying to concentrate on the music but I wished it was just me with Nic, alone together. We used to sing along to all our favourite songs. I was also annoyed with Pagey, who kept moaning about how his dad made him work in his greenhouses25 after school. I know sons are meant to hate their fathers as per the Ancient Greeks, but I told Pagey to show some respect. I then explained to him (and everyone else) how the tomato didn’t arrive in Guernsey until 1834, and that it was initially grown as a decorative plant because people thought it was poisonous. How funny then, that it became our major export and a kind of national emblem. And how tragic when, on 28th June 1940, German bombers destroyed an entire crop that was being loaded onto the boats for Southampton. What made it worse was they’d done so by mistake, because the stupid British government had never told them that they’d demilitarised the islands, and the Germans had mistaken tomato trucks for boxes of ammunition."|"The Book of Lies"|"Mary Horlock"

I don’t like Lisa much and it’s not because she can eat whatever she wants and stay skinny, or because she looks like a ferret, or because she beat me in Geography. I just don’t like her.

19:42|1942|"I must stress that it was not until 1942 that our friendship blossomed. This was a difficult year for everyone. The Führer’s grand plan of making the island an impregnable fortress dominated all other considerations. The arrival of more and more slave workers and the endless building work led to extreme shortages of food and basic necessities, tighter security and harsher punishments for ‘miscreants’. It was difficult for soldier and civilian alike. Although in a position of authority I never felt powerful and I was worried that I would be dispatched to a fighting zone at any time. I confided my fears in Arlette and slowly she began to confide in me. Hubert by then was much changed. I sensed the Occupation had broken his spirit and he was often struck down by rheumatic fever. He soon admitted to me that he was too ill to continue working in the office and I accepted this, perhaps too readily. He thanked me for my patience and asked me keep an eye on Charlie."|"The Book of Lies"|"Mary Horlock"

She told me things were ‘getting back to normal’ (and she’d bought Arctic Roll for dessert so I knew she meant it). Trouble is, I only pretended to have an early night just like she did, then I was up and out the back door, and crouched in a rhododendron bush by approximately 10 p.m. I’d already been past Vue du Lac five times and found no sign of Michael, so I was 99.99% sure he wasn’t back, but I had to go to Vicky’s house to check.
