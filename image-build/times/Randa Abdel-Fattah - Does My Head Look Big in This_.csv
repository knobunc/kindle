Wear comfy shoes. Work out what colour scarves you’ve got so we can mix and match. Also, bags. Have to match your bags to your veil. Tell you what, write a list of all your scarf and bag colours. Shoes if you want as well, but I recommend a triple S be conducted separately, to give it the full attention it deserves.”"|"Does My Head Look Big in This_"|"Randa Abdel-Fattah"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"I remember when it happened. My whole family stayed up all night watching the scenes on television. It was horrific. All I could think about was how a powerful country like America, with people just like those who work down Bourke or Collins Street could be hit like that. I kept thinking about those people. Mucking around at work. Probably reading a funny email. Having a whinge about their boss around the coffee machine. Telling their partners when they’d be home for dinner. I know it sounds awful, but I felt confused. Because for some reason their deaths were more shocking and disgusting and numbing than all the deaths you normally read about and see on the news. You know how it is, you turn on the six o’clock news and there are people starving and countries bleeding and people dying for the right to freedom from occupation and dictatorship and what do you do? You tut-tut and sigh. Most times I flip over to The Simpsons. That’s what got me all confused and upset. Because I couldn’t stop bawling, watching the towers come down. It was a terrible thing to happen. And a terrible thing to realize that I don’t sit through the night crying when such horrors happen all the time."|"Does My Head Look Big in This_"|"Randa Abdel-Fattah"

"ap 10:30"|"ten thirty"|"Panic floods through me. “Simone’s mum offered.” She hasn’t but I’ll make a quick call as soon as my mum leaves the room. “She’s going out that night so she doesn’t mind.

“We want you home by ten thirty. No later.”
“What about eleven?”"|"Does My Head Look Big in This_"|"Randa Abdel-Fattah"
"ap 10:30"|"ten thirty"|"“Please, Aunty?” I beg. I’ve gone straight into third gear The grovelling state. “It’s something she’ll love. It’s a very respectable restaurant and we won’t be back late.

He got home at four in the morning yesterday and she had food wrapped in foil for him in case he was hungry. Yeah, I’m guessing he would have worked up an appetite considering he’d probably drunk the bar dry. Oh, but mention to her that her son drinks like an alcoholic and she conveniently forgets that’s one of the biggest sins. And what about his bimbo girlfriend? He picked her up at some bar and she comes over with half her tits hanging out for the world to see, and my mum lets him get away with it! He doesn’t even have enough respect for his family to ask her to put a cardigan on in front of my mum and dad. It’s sick. Her idea of telling him off is, Oh Hakan, find good girl and settle down.
But then she’ll laugh when he brags about how his girlfriend’s crazy about him. I don’t know what that bimbo sees in him. And I know he smokes pot because he comes home high sometimes and my mum thinks he’s just had a hard day at work. They all make me sick! I don’t understand how I have a genetic connection with them.”"|"Does My Head Look Big in This_"|"Randa Abdel-Fattah"
