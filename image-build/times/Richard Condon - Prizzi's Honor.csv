There was the assistant manager and the night auditor, that’s all. The guests had to make their own beds and cook and keep the lobby clean and some of them were pretty lousy about it. I saw what a bind everybody was in and, anyway, I like housework and cooking. I live alone and you can’t live like a peasant so I tell the manager I want to help out with the general situation. That guy gave me a smile I can still see, a really beautiful smile. I worked the switchboard, I worked in the kitchen, I tended bar—anyplace I could help out. Most of the guests were pretty good about the blizzard, like they lent each other newspapers and so on, but the other people, the beefers, just hung around the lobby and stared out at the snow going up higher and higher, and made trouble. On the third day, a freelance snowplow guy comes up to the door and he offers to clear out the whole parking lot and the road out to the main road and he wants four hundred dollars for this. The assistant manager naturally says he isn’t authorized to spend that kind of money and anyway they have a contract snowplow guy. The people who live in the lobby make a big yell because he won’t make the deal. Two guys start to push him around so I have to drag them into the lounge and bounce them around a little. That quiets everybody down but they sulk, and the other people, the good people, catch it from them and they won’t work anymore, they just sit around the lobby and beef. I made all the beds. Then I got behind the counter in the coffee shop and they all ate. At four o’clock when it’s already dark, the contract snowplow comes to the front door and tells us he has the snow cleared away and that we can get out on the highway. The motel empties in like ten minutes but only three of those bastards—pardon me—offer to pay, which the assistant manager then tells them there won’t be any bills anyway. When everybody was gone, the assistant manager, his name is Francis M. Winikus, makes a speech to me about how I did the right thing.

They will get him for complicity to murder his bodyguard and that elevator woman, the cop’s wife. The trail, with Filargi’s scent all over it, will lead from Lagos, Aruba, Panama, Hong Kong and São Paulo and end at a Filargi numbered account at the bank in Lichtenstein. The Justice Department will prove criminality so that the Swiss banks will be forced to impound the money in the Filargi account, but by the time that happens, all the money will have been moved on—nothing will be found except that the account was in Filargi’s name.
