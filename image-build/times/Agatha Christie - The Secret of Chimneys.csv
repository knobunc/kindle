"~ 22:00"|"about ten o’clock that night"|"It was about ten o’clock that night when Anthony Cade walked into the small room where Jimmy McGrath was busy manipulating various bottles."|"The Secret of Chimneys"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"“Perhaps that would be the best plan,” said Lomax at last. “Very well, then, take a taxi there, and ask Mrs. Revel if she will be at home this afternoon at four o’clock as I am very anxious to see her about an important matter.”"|"The Secret of Chimneys"|"Agatha Christie"
16:00|"four o’clock this afternoon"|"“He wants to know whether you’ll be in at four o’clock this afternoon.”"|"The Secret of Chimneys"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"“Bill, I’m getting intrigued. The things that George thinks important are so awfully limited. I think I must chuck Ranelagh. After all, I can go to Ranelagh any day. Tell George that I shall be awaiting him meekly at four o’clock.”"|"The Secret of Chimneys"|"Agatha Christie"
14:00|"two o’clock that afternoon"|"Therefore, at the moment he was buttonholing Lord Caterham on the steps of the club on Wednesday morning, he would have been greatly surprised to learn that the Granarth Castle had docked at Southampton the preceding afternoon. At two o’clock that afternoon Anthony Cade, travelling under the name of Jimmy McGrath, stepped out of the boat train at Waterloo, hailed a taxi, and after a moment’s hesitation, ordered the driver to proceed to the Blitz Hotel."|"The Secret of Chimneys"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap < 09:00"|"nearly nine o’clock"|"Looking at his watch, Anthony discovered that it was nearly nine o’clock, and he decided to dine where he was. He did not anticipate any more surprise visits, but he felt that it was up to him to be on his guard. He had no intention of allowing his suitcase to be rifled whilst he was downstairs in the Grill Room. He rang the bell and asked for the menu, selected a couple of dishes and ordered a bottle of Chambertin. The waiter took the order and withdrew."|"The Secret of Chimneys"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 03:55"|"five minutes to four"|"It was exactly five minutes to four when Virginia Revel, rendered punctual by a healthy curiosity, returned to the house in Pont Street. She opened the door with her latchkey, and stepped into the hall to be immediately confronted by the impassive Chilvers."|"The Secret of Chimneys"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 04:05"|"five minutes past four"|"Virginia looked up at the clock. It was five minutes past four, and she fancied that she had heard the bell."|"The Secret of Chimneys"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 00:50"|"ten to one"|"“Yes, I expect it sounds absurd to you, Mr. McGrath. But, I assure you, you don’t appreciate the situation. There’s a determined effort being made to prevent its ever reaching this office. I say to you quite frankly and without humbug that if you attempt to bring it yourself it’s ten to one that you’ll never get here.”"|"The Secret of Chimneys"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"At nine o’clock the following morning, the card of Mr. Holmes from Messrs. Balderson and Hodgkins was sent up, and Mr. Holmes followed it. A small, fair man with a quiet manner. Anthony handed over the manuscript, and received in exchange a cheque for a thousand pounds. Mr. Holmes packed up the manuscript in the small brown bag he carried, wished Anthony good morning, and departed. The whole thing seemed very tame."|"The Secret of Chimneys"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap ~ 06:30"|"about half past six"|"“Better I think, ma’am. The doctor said he’d look in and see her about half past six. Will you be wanting the car again?”"|"The Secret of Chimneys"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 06:40"|6:40|"“I shall be away for the weekend. I’m going by the 6:40 from Paddington, but I shan’t need you again—a taxi will do for that. I’d rather you saw the doctor. If he thinks it would do your wife good to go away for the weekend, take her somewhere, Walton. I’ll stand the expense.”"|"The Secret of Chimneys"|"Agatha Christie"
01:00|"one this morning"|"“I can’t buy two of those awful poems in one day,” said Virginia pleadingly. “I bought one this morning. I did, indeed, honour bright.”"|"The Secret of Chimneys"|"Agatha Christie"

"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"“I suppose that’s so. I told this man to come back today—at six o’clock. I arrived home from Ranelagh to find that a bogus telegram had got all the servants except my maid out of the house. Then I walked into the study and found the man shot.”"|"The Secret of Chimneys"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 11:45"|11:45|"“Pity we haven’t got the rest of it,” he muttered. “Chimneys 11:45 Thursday—Sounds like an appointment.”"|"The Secret of Chimneys"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"“She’s gone. I sent her for some special scent—told her the shop in question was open until eight. It won’t be, of course. She’s to follow after me by the next train without coming back here.”"|"The Secret of Chimneys"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap > 11:31"|"just after half past eleven"|"It was just after half past eleven that he brought the car to rest in the road adjoining the park of Chimneys. Jumping out he scaled the wall easily enough, and set out towards the house. It took him longer than he thought, and presently he broke into a run. A great grey mass loomed up out of the darkness—the venerable pile of Chimneys. In the distance a stable clock chimed the three-quarters."|"The Secret of Chimneys"|"Agatha Christie"

Inclined to breathe hard in moments of professional strain. In attendance Constable Johnson, very new to the Force, with a downy unfledged look about him, like a human chicken."|"The Secret of Chimneys"|"Agatha Christie"

They make their wretched secretaries get up at the most unearthly hours in order to dictate rubbish to them. If a law was passed compelling them to stop in bed until eleven, what a benefit it would be to the nation! I wouldn’t mind so much if they didn’t talk such balderdash. Lomax is always talking to me of my ‘position.’ As if I had any. Who wants to be a peer nowadays?”"|"The Secret of Chimneys"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 09:17"|9:17|"“High finance,” said Lord Caterham vaguely. “And that reminds me, I shouldn’t be at all surprised if Isaacstein wasn’t an early riser. He may blow in upon us at any minute.

On the other hand the dead man’s wristwatch was smashed by the fall, and marks the crime as having been committed at exactly a quarter to twelve.

"ap ~ 11:45"|"about 11:45"|"“I mean,” said Anthony, “that I was trespassing upon Lord Caterham’s property (for which I hope he will forgive me) last night at about 11:45, and that I actually heard the shot fired. I can at any rate fix the time of the crime for you.”"|"The Secret of Chimneys"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 11:45"|11:45|"“I think, Mr. Cade,” he hinted, “that you were about to give us some—er—explanation of what you were doing in the grounds last night at 11:45?”"|"The Secret of Chimneys"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 11:45"|11:45|"“Certainly not,” said Anthony warmly. “When I am asked to stay at a country house, I don’t scale the wall late at night, tramp across the park, and try the downstairs windows. I drive up to the front door, ring the bell and wipe my feet on the mat. I will proceed. I replied to Mr. Lomax’s letter, explaining that the manuscript had passed out of my keeping, and therefore regretfully declining Lord Caterham’s kind invitation. But after I had done so, I remembered something which had up till then escaped my memory.” He paused. The moment had come for skating over thin ice. “I must tell you that in my struggle with the waiter Giuseppe, I had wrested from him a small bit of paper with some words scribbled on it. They had conveyed nothing to me at the time, but I still had them, and the mention of Chimneys recalled them to me. I got the torn scrap out and looked at it. It was as I had thought. Here is the piece of paper, gentlemen, you can see for yourselves. The words on it are ‘Chimneys 11:45 Thursday.’ ”"|"The Secret of Chimneys"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 10:30"|"half past ten"|"“His Highness retired to bed at half past ten. I slept, as always, in the anteroom next to him. He must have gone down to the room downstairs by the other door, the door that gave on the corridor. I did not hear him go. It may be that I was drugged. I have been an unfaithful servant, I slept while my master woke. I am accursed.”"|"The Secret of Chimneys"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 11:45"|11:45|"“He was shot at 11:45,” said Virginia thoughtfully. “The time mentioned on that scrap of paper. The whole thing’s horribly mysterious.”"|"The Secret of Chimneys"|"Agatha Christie"

A MIDNIGHT ADVENTURE
The inquest took place on the following morning. It was extraordinarily unlike the inquests as pictured in sensational fiction. It satisfied even George Lomax in its rigid suppression of all interesting details. Superintendent Battle and the coroner, working together with the support of the chief constable, had reduced the proceedings to the lowest level of boredom."|"The Secret of Chimneys"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap ~ 10:00"|"about ten o’clock"|"“You’ve just betrayed the fact. You’re very nice, Bill, and I like you. I daresay that tomorrow morning—say about ten o’clock, a good safe hour for not unduly exciting the emotions—I might even kiss you.”"|"The Secret of Chimneys"|"Agatha Christie"

The first person that Anthony saw as he alighted from his train on the following afternoon was Superintendent Battle. His face broke into a smile."|"The Secret of Chimneys"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 01:00"|"One o’clock"|"The minutes passed, at interminable length. One o’clock chimed, then the half hour, then two, then half hour. Anthony felt stiff and cramped.

"ap 10:50"|10:50|"“But fortunately he’s got to go back to town. Don’t forget to order the car for the 10:50, by the way.”"|"The Secret of Chimneys"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 10:30"|"Half past ten"|"“Oh, it’s nothing important.” He took out a big watch and glanced at it. “Half past ten. I’m starting for Wyvern Abbey in ten minutes to report to Mr. Lomax. Plenty of time. I only wanted to know if you could tell me a little more about Mr. Cade.”"|"The Secret of Chimneys"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 00:10"|12:10|"“I have done so, Mr. Lomax, an hour ago. He will arrive by the 12:10.”"|"The Secret of Chimneys"|"Agatha Christie"

"ap 11:30"|"half past eleven"|"“I don’t know,” said Virginia. “I’m tired. I shall go up to bed.”
“Not a bad idea,” said Lord Caterham. “It’s half past eleven.”
As Virginia was crossing the wide hall, she caught sight of a broad back that seemed familiar to her discreetly vanishing through a side door."|"The Secret of Chimneys"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"At ten o’clock on the morning of Wednesday, the 13th of October, Anthony Cade walked into Harridge’s Hotel and asked for Baron Lolopretjzyl who was occupying a suite there."|"The Secret of Chimneys"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"“Just think it over. Now, Baron, there is one thing further. You must come down to Chimneys this evening—Captain Andrassy also.

The clock in the Council Chamber struck nine.
“Well,” said Lord Caterham, with a deep sigh. “Here they all are, just like little Bo-Peep’s flock, back again and wagging their tails behind them.”"|"The Secret of Chimneys"|"Agatha Christie"

But this morning we got a wire from him saying he would be down here at 9 p.m. tonight, and suggesting that Codders should be asked over.

"< 00:00"|"before midnight"|"“I can’t help myself. I can’t let a pal like Jimmy down. But you needn’t worry. I’ve had time to wade through them, and I see now why people always hint that bigwigs don’t write their own reminiscences but hire someone to do it for them. As a writer, Stylptitch is an insufferable bore. He proses on about statecraft, and doesn’t go in for any racy and indiscreet anecdotes. His ruling passion of secrecy held strong to the end. There’s not a word in the memoirs from beginning to end to flutter the susceptibilities of the most difficult politician. I rang up Balderson today, and arranged with him that I’d deliver the manuscript tonight before midnight. But Jimmy can do his own dirty work now that he’s here.”"|"The Secret of Chimneys"|"Agatha Christie"
