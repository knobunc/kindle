meagre and sharp to look at about the cheeks and chin; large,
grave, wistfully attentive eyes; nervous, uncertain lips; and
light hair of a pale, brownish-yellow hue.  There was nothing
wild, nothing immodest in her manner: it was quiet and self-
controlled, a little melancholy and a little touched by suspicion;
not exactly the manner of a lady, and, at the same time, not the
manner of a woman in the humblest rank of life.  The voice, little
as I had yet heard of it, had something curiously still and
mechanical in its tones, and the utterance was remarkably rapid.
She held a small bag in her hand: and her dress—bonnet, shawl,
and gown all of white—was, so far as I could guess, certainly not
composed of very delicate or very expensive materials.  Her figure
was slight, and rather above the average height—her gait and
actions free from the slightest approach to extravagance.  This
was all that I could observe of her in the dim light and under the
perplexingly strange circumstances of our meeting.  What sort of a
woman she was, and how she came to be out alone in the high-road,
an hour after midnight, I altogether failed to guess.  The one

could not have misconstrued her motive in speaking, even at that

looking over my mother's correspondence with Mr. Fairlie.  He was
fond of London, and was constantly away from his country home; and
she was accustomed, at such times, to write and report to him how
things went on at Limmeridge.  Her letters are full of references
to the school in which she took so strong an interest; and I think
it more than likely that I may have discovered something when we
meet again.  The luncheon hour is two, Mr. Hartright.  I shall

ailments, his wonderful coins, and his matchless Rembrandt
etchings.  The moment I tried to speak of the business that had
brought me to his house, he shut his eyes and said I ""upset"" him.
I persisted in upsetting him by returning again and again to the
subject.  All I could ascertain was that he looked on his niece's
marriage as a settled thing, that her father had sanctioned it,
that he sanctioned it himself, that it was a desirable marriage,
and that he should be personally rejoiced when the worry of it was
over.  As to the settlements, if I would consult his niece, and
afterwards dive as deeply as I pleased into my own knowledge of
the family affairs, and get everything ready, and limit his share
in the business, as guardian, to saying Yes, at the right moment—
why, of course he would meet my views, and everybody else's views,

as long and as broad as my office writing-desk.  The miserable

agitation in every line of his face.  The dry, sharp cough, which
teases him at most times, seemed to be troubling him more

he was the palest of the two."|"The Woman in White"|"Wilkie Collins"

here; and Laura having resigned herself to the one inevitable
sacrifice of the marriage, remains as coldly hopeless and enduring
as ever.  In parting with the little occupations and relics that
reminded her of Hartright, she seems to have parted with all her
tenderness and all her impressibility.  It is only three o'clock
in the afternoon while I write these lines, and Sir Percival has
left us already, in the happy hurry of a bride-groom, to prepare
for the bride's reception at his house in Hampshire.  Unless some

Mrs. Vesey, and went out alone for one of my brisk midday walks,

road over the moor that leads to Todd's Corner.  After having been
out half an hour, I was excessively surprised to see Sir Percival
approaching me from the direction of the farm.  He was walking
rapidly, swinging his stick, his head erect as usual, and his
shooting jacket flying open in the wind.  When we met he did not
wait for me to ask any questions—he told me at once that he had

12:00|noon|"As Eleanor Fairlie (aged seven-and-thirty), she was always talking
pretentious nonsense, and always worrying the unfortunate men with
every small exaction which a vain and foolish woman can impose on
long-suffering male humanity.  As Madame Fosco (aged three-and-
forty), she sits for hours together without saying a word, frozen
up in the strangest manner in herself.  The hideously ridiculous
love-locks which used to hang on either side of her face are now
replaced by stiff little rows of very short curls, of the sort one
sees in old-fashioned wigs.  A plain, matronly cap covers her
head, and makes her look, for the first time in her life since I
remember her, like a decent woman.  Nobody (putting her husband
out of the question, of course) now sees in her, what everybody
once saw—I mean the structure of the female skeleton, in the
upper regions of the collar-bones and the shoulder-blades.  Clad
in quiet black or grey gowns, made high round the throat—dresses
that she would have laughed at, or screamed at, as the whim of the
moment inclined her, in her maiden days—she sits speechless in
corners; her dry white hands (so dry that the pores of her skin
look chalky) incessantly engaged, either in monotonous embroidery
work or in rolling up endless cigarettes for the Count's own
particular smoking.  On the few occasions when her cold blue eyes
are off her work, they are generally turned on her husband, with
the look of mute submissive inquiry which we are all familiar with
in the eyes of a faithful dog.  The only approach to an inward
thaw which I have yet detected under her outer covering of icy
constraint, has betrayed itself, once or twice, in the form of a
suppressed tigerish jealousy of any woman in the house (the maids
included) to whom the Count speaks, or on whom he looks with
anything approaching to special interest or attention.  Except in
this one particular, she is always, morning, noon, and night,
indoors and out, fair weather or foul, as cold as a statue, and as
impenetrable as the stone out of which it is cut.  For the common
purposes of society the extraordinary change thus produced in her
is, beyond all doubt, a change for the better, seeing that it has
transformed her into a civil, silent, unobtrusive woman, who is
never in the way.  How far she is really reformed or deteriorated
in her secret self, is another question.  I have once or twice
seen sudden changes of expression on her pinched lips, and heard
sudden inflexions of tone in her calm voice, which have led me to
suspect that her present state of suppression may have sealed up
something dangerous in her nature, which used to evaporate
harmlessly in the freedom of her former life.  It is quite
possible that I may be altogether wrong in this idea.  My own
impression, however, is, that I am right.  Time will show."|"The Woman in White"|"Wilkie Collins"

for leaving the house, but with our weapons of defence against

preserve those words in writing, exactly as they were spoken,
while the time was my own, and while my memory vividly retained

advice of one who had studied medicine unprofessionally, replied
that he was not accustomed to consult with amateur physicians.
The Count, with truly Christian meekness of temper, smiled and
left the room.  Before he went out he told me that he might be
found, in case he was wanted in the course of the day, at the
boat-house on the banks of the lake.  Why he should have gone
there, I cannot say.  But he did go, remaining away the whole day

pious and cheering words.  Concluding that Lady Glyde's departure
must have disturbed me far more seriously than I had myself

much as possible.  She did not seem to want to talk whenever I saw
her, except overnight, when I couldn't make out what she was

of duty, the woman took the money, and proposed three o'clock on
the next day as the time for the interview.  She might then slip
out for half an hour, after the patients had dined, and she would
meet the lady in a retired place, outside the high north wall
which screened the grounds of the house.  Miss Halcombe had only
time to assent, and to whisper to her sister that she should hear
from her on the next day, when the proprietor of the Asylum joined
them.  He noticed his visitor's agitation, which Miss Halcombe
accounted for by saying that her interview with Anne Catherick had
a little startled her at first. She took her leave as soon after

to force herself from the presence of her unfortunate sister."|"The Woman in White"|"Wilkie Collins"

sight of her (evidently from astonishment at her resemblance to

to see how ill she was.  He would not allow her to be awakened—he
was contented with putting questions to Mrs. Clements about her
symptoms, with looking at her, and with lightly touching her
pulse.  Sandon was a large enough place to have a grocer's and
druggist's shop in it, and thither the Count went to write his
prescription and to get the medicine made up.  He brought it back
himself, and told Mrs. Clements that the medicine was a powerful
stimulant, and that it would certainly give Anne strength to get
up and bear the fatigue of a journey to London of only a few
hours.  The remedy was to be administered at stated times on that
day and on the day after.  On the third day she would be well
enough to travel, and he arranged to meet Mrs. Clements at the

in the face with a smile of superb triumph."|"The Woman in White"|"Wilkie Collins"
"ap 04:00"|"four o'clock"|"He dipped his pen in the ink, placed the first slip of paper
before him with a thump of his hand on the desk, cleared his
throat, and began.  He wrote with great noise and rapidity, in so
large and bold a hand, and with such wide spaces between the
lines, that he reached the bottom of the slip in not more than two
minutes certainly from the time when he started at the top.  Each
slip as he finished it was paged, and tossed over his shoulder out
of his way on the floor.  When his first pen was worn out, THAT
went over his shoulder too, and he pounced on a second from the
supply scattered about the table.  Slip after slip, by dozens, by
fifties, by hundreds, flew over his shoulders on either side of
him till he had snowed himself up in paper all round his chair.
Hour after hour passed—and there I sat watching, there he sat
writing.  He never stopped, except to sip his coffee, and when
that was exhausted, to smack his forehead from time to time.  One
o'clock struck, two, three, four—and still the slips flew about
all round him; still the untiring pen scraped its way ceaselessly
from top to bottom of the page, still the white chaos of paper
rose higher and higher all round his chair.  At four o'clock I
heard a sudden splutter of the pen, indicative of the flourish
with which he signed his name.  ""Bravo!"" he cried, springing to
his feet with the activity of a young man, and looking me straight
in the face with a smile of superb triumph."|"The Woman in White"|"Wilkie Collins"

assumption of composure, he was getting anxious for the agent's

made his appearance.  He was a foreigner with a dark beard."|"The Woman in White"|"Wilkie Collins"

00:00|midnight|"The object of the second move was to induce Lady Glyde to leave
Blackwater unaccompanied by her sister.  Unless we could persuade
her that Marian had gone on to Cumberland first, there was no
chance of removing her, of her own free will, from the house.  To
produce this necessary operation in her mind, we concealed our
interesting invalid in one of the uninhabited bedrooms at
Blackwater.  At the dead of night Madame Fosco, Madame Rubelle,
and myself (Percival not being cool enough to be trusted)
accomplished the concealment.  The scene was picturesque,
mysterious, dramatic in the highest degree.  By my directions the
bed had been made, in the morning, on a strong movable framework
of wood.  We had only to lift the framework gently at the head and
foot, and to transport our patient where we pleased, without
disturbing herself or her bed.  No chemical assistance was needed
or used in this case.  Our interesting Marian lay in the deep
repose of convalescence.  We placed the candles and opened the
doors beforehand.  I, in right of my great personal strength, took
the head of the framework—my wife and Madame Rubelle took the
foot.  I bore my share of that inestimably precious burden with a
manly tenderness, with a fatherly care.  Where is the modern
Rembrandt who could depict our midnight procession? Alas for the
Arts! alas for this most pictorial of subjects! The modern
Rembrandt is nowhere to be found."|"The Woman in White"|"Wilkie Collins"
12:00|midday|"I had written a note in the morning to Madame Rubelle, telling her
to join me at her husband's house on the evening of Friday the
26th, with another note to Percival, warning him to show his wife
her uncle's letter of invitation, to assert that Marian had gone
on before her, and to despatch her to town by the midday train, on
the 26th, also.  On reflection I had felt the necessity, in Anne
Catherick's state of health, of precipitating events, and of
having Lady Glyde at my disposal earlier than I had originally
contemplated.  What fresh directions, in the terrible uncertainty
of my position, could I now issue? I could do nothing but trust to
chance and the doctor.  My emotions expressed themselves in
pathetic apostrophes, which I was just self-possessed enough to
couple, in the hearing of other people, with the name of ""Lady
Glyde."" In all other respects Fosco, on that memorable day, was
Fosco shrouded in total eclipse."|"The Woman in White"|"Wilkie Collins"
"ap 02:00"|"two o'clock"|"She passed a bad night, she awoke worn out, but later in the day
she revived amazingly.  My elastic spirits revived with her.  I
could receive no answers from Percival and Madame Rubelle till the
morning of the next day, the 26th.  In anticipation of their
following my directions, which, accident apart, I knew they would
do, I went to secure a fly to fetch Lady Glyde from the railway,
directing it to be at my house on the 26th, at two o'clock.  After
seeing the order entered in the book, I went on to arrange matters
with Monsieur Rubelle.  I also procured the services of two
gentlemen who could furnish me with the necessary certificates of
lunacy.  One of them I knew personally—the other was known to
Monsieur Rubelle.  Both were men whose vigorous minds soared
superior to narrow scruples—both were labouring under temporary
embarrassments—both believed in ME."|"The Woman in White"|"Wilkie Collins"

London till the 26th!"|"The Woman in White"|"Wilkie Collins"

announcing his wife's arrival by the midday train.  Madame Rubelle
also wrote to say she would follow in the evening.  I started in
the fly, leaving the false Lady Glyde dead in the house, to
receive the true Lady Glyde on her arrival by the railway at three
o'clock.  Hidden under the seat of the carriage, I carried with me
all the clothes Anne Catherick had worn on coming into my house—
they were destined to assist the resurrection of the woman who was
dead in the person of the woman who was living.  What a situation!
I suggest it to the rising romance writers of England.  I offer
it, as totally new, to the worn-out dramatists of France."|"The Woman in White"|"Wilkie Collins"

"ap 02:00"|"Two o'clock"|"The address in my possession led me to some ""livery stables,""
about a quarter of a mile distant from Forest Road.  The
proprietor proved to be a civil and respectable man.  When I
explained that an important family matter obliged me to ask him to
refer to his books for the purpose of ascertaining a date with
which the record of his business transactions might supply me, he
offered no objection to granting my request.  The book was
produced, and there, under the date of ""July 26th, 1850,"" the
order was entered in these words—
""Brougham to Count Fosco, 5 Forest Road.  Two o'clock. (John
Owen).""
I found on inquiry that the name of ""John Owen,"" attached to the
entry, referred to the man who had been employed to drive the fly.
He was then at work in the stable-yard, and was sent for to see me
at my request."|"The Woman in White"|"Wilkie Collins"
