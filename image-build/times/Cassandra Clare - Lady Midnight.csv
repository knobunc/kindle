"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"But Emma didn’t want to think about Julian being sad, not now, not when he was so close to coming home. Now that it was past midnight, he was technically coming home tomorrow. She felt a shiver of excitement and relief."|"Lady Midnight"|"Cassandra Clare"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"“Julian means you should all be asleep,” Diana said.
“It’s only eight o’clock,” Emma protested. “They just got here!”
Diana pointed. Tavvy had curled up on the floor and was asleep in the angled beam of light from a lamp, exactly like a cat. “It’s considerably later in England.”"|"Lady Midnight"|"Cassandra Clare"
"< 03:00"|"nearly three in the morning"|"She stood up, grabbing up a sweater from the back of a chair. A quick glance at the clock on the bedside table told her it was nearly three in the morning. She grimaced and slipped out into the hallway."|"Lady Midnight"|"Cassandra Clare"
00:00|midnight|"One day she and Julian would both be married, to other people. There would be no crawling into each other’s beds. There would be no exchanging of secrets at midnight. Their closeness wouldn’t break, but it would bend and stretch into a new shape. She would have to learn to live with that."|"Lady Midnight"|"Cassandra Clare"
"< 12:00"|"almost noon"|"“It’s almost noon,” he said. His voice sounded ordinary, but he still looked different to Emma, strangely different: the shape of his face, his shoulders under his T-shirt. “What did you want to talk to me about?”"|"Lady Midnight"|"Cassandra Clare"
"< 12:00"|"almost noon"|"“Come with me to breakfast,” Emma wheedled. “Or it might be brunch. It’s almost noon. But whatever—I want to introduce you to everyone. I want you to meet Julian—”"|"Lady Midnight"|"Cassandra Clare"
12:00|noon|"Malcolm’s face had turned somber, despite the bright noon light reflecting off the ocean. “Don’t depend on me too much,” he said, so softly she wondered if he knew she would hear him."|"Lady Midnight"|"Cassandra Clare"
"ap 00:00"|twelve|"As he moved forward into the cave, which began to narrow into a tunnel, she couldn’t help but remember Mark the last time she had seen him, before he had been taken by Sebastian Morgenstern. Smiling, blue-eyed, short pale hair curling over the tips of his pointed ears. Broad-shouldered—or at least she, at twelve, had thought so. Certainly he had been bigger than Julian, taller and broader than all of them. Grown up."|"Lady Midnight"|"Cassandra Clare"
00:00|MIDNIGHT|"THIS MONTH’S PERFORMANCE: AUGUST 11, 7 P.M.
THE MIDNIGHT THEATER
This ticket admits one group. Semiformal attire."|"Lady Midnight"|"Cassandra Clare"
00:00|midnight|"“I’m sure you’re right,” Cristina murmured, and glanced toward Emma’s wardrobe. “Can I borrow a dress?”
“Right now?” Emma said. “Have you got a midnight date?”
“No, for tomorrow night.” Cristina got to her feet to peer into the wardrobe. Several badly folded rayon dresses fell out. “It is meant to be formal. I didn’t bring any formal dresses with me from home.”"|"Lady Midnight"|"Cassandra Clare"
00:00|MIDNIGHT|"He was right. Emma could see lights, hot neon and electricity, up ahead, the arrow shape of a sign: THE MIDNIGHT THEATER. The Hollywood Hills glittered in the distance as if they’d been dusted with starlight. Everything else was dark, even the streetlights."|"Lady Midnight"|"Cassandra Clare"
00:00|Midnight|"A heavy sweet scent hung in the air as people hurried to take their seats in the semicircular space. The seats were upholstered in purple velvet, each with a gold M embroidered across the back. As the ticket girl had promised, their ticket now had their row and seat numbers printed on it. They found them and filed in, Cristina first, then Emma, then Julian. He sat down beside Emma.
“M for Midnight?” she said, pointing at the seat backs.
“Probably,” he said, and went back to looking at the stage. The curtains were drawn back and a massive painting of an ocean view covered the back wall. The stage itself was bare, the floor gleaming polished boards."|"Lady Midnight"|"Cassandra Clare"
00:00|Midnight|"“I feel farther away now than I’ve ever felt. Even though we actually have a connection, even though we’re following up on it. I don’t see how their deaths could be connected to the Midnight Theater or the Lottery. I don’t see—”"|"Lady Midnight"|"Cassandra Clare"
00:00|Midnight|"“The Midnight Theater and the Followers,” Emma said. “We want to know about them.”"|"Lady Midnight"|"Cassandra Clare"
00:00|Midnight|"Julian shrugged. “Who else would you be?” He tilted his head to the side. “Maybe you know something about the Lottery at the Midnight Theater?”"|"Lady Midnight"|"Cassandra Clare"
12:00|midday|"At that she did sit up. She was sitting on the beach—a small, bare half circle of a beach, hemmed in on either side by fingers of stone reaching into the ocean. The sand around her was thoroughly churned up, and she blushed, memory crashing into her like a wave. It looked like it was at least midday, though thankfully the beach was deserted. It was familiar, too. They were close to the Institute, closer than she’d thought. Not that she’d thought much."|"Lady Midnight"|"Cassandra Clare"
00:00|Midnight|"To be met with a sheet of blue-green fire. Sterling was standing behind it, still clasping the green-haired girl. Her eyes met Emma’s. She had a slight, elfin face—a recollection of seeing her at the Midnight Theater touched the edge of Emma’s memory."|"Lady Midnight"|"Cassandra Clare"
00:00|Midnight|"“Yeah, about that,” Cristina said. “How did you end up joining that cult or whatever it is at the Midnight Theater?”"|"Lady Midnight"|"Cassandra Clare"
00:00|Midnight|"Sterling yelled something incomprehensible. Emma slammed on the brakes as the headlights skittered across the trampled brush in front of the building. The figures were illuminated, lit up like daylight. Some were familiar. She recognized the curly-haired boy from the band at the Midnight Theater, his face set in a stony snarl. Beside him was a woman—dark hair, red lips—who raised a hand with a gun in it—"|"Lady Midnight"|"Cassandra Clare"
00:00|Midnight|"“Yes. She saw me and raced off. I followed her to her house, managed to convince her to tell me everything she knew about the Midnight Theater, the Followers, the Lottery. It wasn’t much, but I learned that she had been chosen by the Lottery. That she had been the one who killed Stanley Wells, knowing that if she didn’t, she would be tortured and killed herself.”"|"Lady Midnight"|"Cassandra Clare"
00:00|Midnight|"“Great-Aunt Marjorie gave it to me,” Tavvy said. “I like most of the stories. The one about the first parabatai is good, but some of them are sad and scary, like the one about Tobias Herondale. And the one about Lady Midnight is the saddest.”"|"Lady Midnight"|"Cassandra Clare"
00:00|Midnight|"“Midnight,” said Tavvy. “Like the theater you went to. I heard Mark say the rhyme and I just remembered I read it before.”"|"Lady Midnight"|"Cassandra Clare"
00:00|Midnight|"“Because she was a Blackthorn,” said Tavvy. “Lady Midnight. They called her that because she had long black hair, but she had the same eyes as the rest of us. Look.”"|"Lady Midnight"|"Cassandra Clare"
00:00|Midnight|"Emma said, “‘First thirteen and then the last.’ He’s killed thirteen. He’s got one last one to go and then he’s done. He’ll have enough magic to bring back Lady Midnight.”"|"Lady Midnight"|"Cassandra Clare"
00:00|Midnight|"“To where? The library? Everyone has been reading and searching all day for more information about Lady Midnight. We will find something, but we have plenty of people to look at pages.”"|"Lady Midnight"|"Cassandra Clare"
00:00|Midnight|"The rest of the family had been in the library. They had torn through piles of books in search of information about Lady Midnight."|"Lady Midnight"|"Cassandra Clare"
00:00|Midnight|"“Who she was,” Ty said. “Our Lady Midnight. Tavvy’s book reminded me of a story I read in one of the Blackthorn history books—”"|"Lady Midnight"|"Cassandra Clare"
00:00|Midnight|"Ty gave him a superior look. “We looked at everything going back a hundred years,” he said. “But Tavvy’s book said Lady Midnight was in love with someone she was forbidden to love.”"|"Lady Midnight"|"Cassandra Clare"
00:00|Midnight|"She thought of him winking at her in the Midnight Theater. I never knew his name, she thought, and then whirled back around."|"Lady Midnight"|"Cassandra Clare"
00:00|Midnight|"Many of the places Emma goes are real or based on real places in Los Angeles, but some are imaginary. Canter’s Deli exists, but the Midnight Theater doesn’t. Poseidon’s Trident is based on the seafood shack Neptune’s Net, but the Net doesn’t have showers out back. Malcolm’s house and Wells’s are based on real houses. I grew up in Los Angeles, so in many ways this is the L.A. I always imagined as a child, full of magic."|"Lady Midnight"|"Cassandra Clare"
00:00|Midnight|"Lady Midnight was written in Los Angeles, California; San Miguel de Allende, Mexico; and Menton, France."|"Lady Midnight"|"Cassandra Clare"
