Whereas she’ll get up in ten minutes’ time. She always wakes before the alarm for fear that it might never go off. One of them has to be up. A hotel, after all, does not run itself, and the staff are only as good as the person pulling their strings."|"The Long Weekend"|"Veronica Henry"
"ap 06:15"|"quarter past six"|"Her shower takes five minutes. Getting dressed takes another five. By quarter past six she is at the front desk, double-checking the staff rota, praying that no one will be tempted by the sun to throw a sickie."|"The Long Weekend"|"Veronica Henry"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"‘Don’t wanna get up,’ he groaned, stretching out, the top of his pyjamas riding up to expose his belly. At eight, he still had the plump cheeks and chubby fingers of a toddler. Her little brother. Well, half-brother – none of Angelica’s siblings shared a father – but he never failed to make her heart squeeze."|"The Long Weekend"|"Veronica Henry"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"There weren’t many people who considered Colin Turner a foolish man. On the contrary, most people had an enormous amount of respect and admiration for him. He managed to be a success without inviting jealousy. After all, there was no denying that he was a grafter. He was always on site by six o’clock, dressed in his whites, ready to get his hands dirty. He looked after his workers, and was a most generous employer. Conditions at both the cake factory and his half-dozen cafés were exemplary. He didn’t try and screw extra hours out of anyone, and the perks were legendary: hefty discounts, generous bonuses and an extravagant Christmas party at a local hotel, all drinks on the house. And he had reaped the rewards of his hard work. The sleek Jaguar he was driving as he pulled on to the M5 was testament to that."|"The Long Weekend"|"Veronica Henry"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"At the thought of his children, he felt guilt nip at his heart: Ryan, on his gap year, living it up in Oz; and Michelle, in her second year at uni in Warwick. He was incredibly proud of them. They’d achieved so much. That was largely down to Alison and the attention she’d lavished on them while they were growing up, painstakingly helping them with their homework, running them to extracurricular activities, encouraging them to do everything they wanted to do. Not that Colin hadn’t been interested, but his working hours were brutal. He rarely got home before seven, and by then all the hard work had been done. He had, of course, paid for their education, and all the extras, and was funding Ryan’s gap year, and over his dead body were either of his kids taking out a loan to pay for their tuition fees at university, so he had contributed in no small way, but it was Alison who’d put in the blood, sweat and tears that had led to their success. Not that he spoiled his kids financially. On the contrary, he’d taught them both the value of hard work. They’d had jobs with him in the holidays: Ryan had worked at the factory, and Michelle had waitressed in one or other of the cafés, so they understood what it was to have your own money. They were grafters, like him."|"The Long Weekend"|"Veronica Henry"
"ap < 11:00"|"Just before eleven"|"Just before eleven, Claire heard the front door open and prayed it wasn’t an arrival. She hated it when guests checked in early. The corridors were still busy with Henry the Hoover and lined with canvas bags of dirty linen, and there was nothing worse than the sight of a hotel room door agape and a stripped bed. There was nothing you could do about it – rooms had to be turned round – but she wished people would wait till after midday at least to turn up."|"The Long Weekend"|"Veronica Henry"

‘It’s not even midday.’
‘Who cares? It’s a bank holiday weekend. There are no rules.’ Claire tweaked the last flower defiantly and led the way through into the bar."|"The Long Weekend"|"Veronica Henry"
11:30|"half past eleven in the morning"|"Astonished, Angelica followed her. This was totally out of character. Claire might occasionally succumb to a glass of wine at the end of a long day, but unlike Luca, alcohol wasn’t her automatic solution to a problem. But here she was, determinedly pulling a bottle of house white from the fridge at half past eleven in the morning. Who was that guy? Angelica wondered."|"The Long Weekend"|"Veronica Henry"
00:00|midnight|"Sophie. The girl who was going to walk down the aisle and join him at the altar next Saturday, in St Mary’s Church in Mimsbury, with the reception afterwards at his father’s house, because although it defied convention, they had both agreed that a marquee on the lawn by the river at the Mill House was the ideal spot. Why pay for a swanky hotel when they had perfection on the doorstep? A hundred and forty guests, canapés, a string quartet, an exquisite buffet – neither of them could face the horror of a seating plan – and then dancing barefoot till midnight at the water’s edge. They’d been planning it for months. This weekend was a much-needed break for both of them. Nick had been really looking forward to chilling with his mates, taking a boat out on the water, having a few beers, chewing the fat . . ."|"The Long Weekend"|"Veronica Henry"
"ap 23:40"|"twenty to twelve"|"Claire smothered a smile at Angelica’s world-weary wisdom. It was a shame that she was quite so cynical so young. She supposed it was a defence mechanism; the protective armour of a girl who’d never known stability in her family life. She’d heard about her mother’s string of men. She looked at her watch. It was twenty to twelve. People would start coming in for lunch any time soon. They only did bar snacks at lunchtime during the week – Fred and Loz, the two local boys whom Luca had trained up, were in the kitchen prepping – but it was Friday, a bank holiday weekend, and the sun was out. They would have a flock of spontaneous lunchers any moment."|"The Long Weekend"|"Veronica Henry"

"ap 10:45"|"quarter to eleven"|"By quarter to eleven she was done in. She was rushed off her feet serving breaded scampi, steak and ale pie and chips, and black forest gateau, for the restaurant was extremely popular on a Saturday night, and they managed to squeeze in three sittings. By eleven o’clock every table was cleared, and Phil told her to go to the bar for half a lager – waitress’s perks. All Claire wanted to do was to go home and crawl into the bath, to get the smell of cooking out of her hair and skin, but it was rude and unsociable not to take him up on his offer. She had just perched at the bar and asked for a splash of lime in her lager when she felt a tap on her shoulder."|"The Long Weekend"|"Veronica Henry"

"< 00:00"|"almost midnight"|"‘He’s right. You are gorgeous.’ Isobel stroked a finger down Claire’s cheek as if to confirm that she was a living, breathing human, then nodded in approval before sliding off and going to greet the next guest. People still seemed to be arriving, even though it was almost midnight. Nick had disappeared, swept off into the crowd now that he had made his introductions. Suddenly self-conscious, both from Isobel’s attention and because of the fact that she was now standing on her own and knew no one, Claire took a greedy gulp from her glass of champagne. She wasn’t equipped for this party. Not at all. She thought perhaps she’d been brought along as a novelty. A curiosity for them all to gawp at. They seemed the type of people to have low boredom thresholds."|"The Long Weekend"|"Veronica Henry"
02:00|"two o’clock that morning"|"By two o’clock that morning, Claire realised that Nick was right. She had made more friends than she knew what to do with. Far from being intimidating, the Barneses and their friends were charming. They made her feel interesting. Made her feel beautiful – many of the men had commandeered her for a dance, and she’d felt like the belle of the ball. And whilst they were admiring of her, none of them was groping or lecherous. They treated her with respect. As she danced to ‘Jumpin’ Jack Flash’ with Gerald, Nick’s father, she reflected that she’d never had such a wonderful time in her life, never allowed herself to let her hair down. She’d always judged ‘posh’ people, assumed them to be obsessed with avoiding tax and using the right knife and fork and killing defenceless animals."|"The Long Weekend"|"Veronica Henry"

"ap 06:15"|"quarter past six"|"By quarter past six, the respite would be over. Passers-by would start drifting in to see if they could nab a last-minute table, local regulars would pop in for their habitual early-evening drink, and the bar would start filling up with guests coming down for dinner."|"The Long Weekend"|"Veronica Henry"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"She was due to go over to the Mill House at three o’clock, but her heart was filled with dread at the prospect. How could she sit there amongst the baubles and glitter, knowing this was very probably Isobel’s last Christmas with her family, while they carried on with the festivities oblivious?"|"The Long Weekend"|"Veronica Henry"
"ap 04:30"|"half past four"|"She wouldn’t go, she decided. She had the beginnings of a cold. It wouldn’t be fair to spread her germs. She called and left a message on the Mill House answerphone to say she wasn’t well, but the Barneses were having none of it. They phoned her three times to see where she was – they were waiting for her to come over and open her presents before lunch, which they always had in the late afternoon. At half past four, Nick came and knocked on the door."|"The Long Weekend"|"Veronica Henry"
"< 00:00"|"towards midnight"|"She managed to get through the evening somehow. There were so many people, and she kept herself busy by topping up drinks and passing round canapés. As the hands crept towards midnight and the excitement of the millennium grew, she crept into the kitchen – everyone was crowding round the clock in the hall. Prince’s ‘1999’ was playing at full blast as the mood reached fever pitch."|"The Long Weekend"|"Veronica Henry"
00:00|midnight|"She could hear the countdown to midnight. The uproarious bellow of a roomful of people moved by the momentousness of the occasion, the dawn of a new millennium. All the optimism of a fresh year, but a thousandfold. The future was bright for them all. The slate clean. The year 2000 – a chance to start again and make a difference."|"The Long Weekend"|"Veronica Henry"
00:00|midnight|"She should get up and go and join them. Nick would be looking for her. He would want to kiss her on the stroke of midnight. It should have been a perfect moment for the two of them, young and in love. But she couldn’t kiss him with the burden of the secret she carried."|"The Long Weekend"|"Veronica Henry"
00:00|midnight|"She opened the kitchen door and stepped into the hallway. It was crammed with guests, all watching the minute hand of the grandfather clock as it jerked to join the hour, both pointing vertically to twelve. As midnight struck, a mighty cheer rose. There was the sound of champagne corks popping, party blowers hooting, a rousing drunken chorus of ‘Auld Lang Syne’ as people hunted for their loved ones and embraced them and streams of party-popper ribbons flew into the air."|"The Long Weekend"|"Veronica Henry"

"~ 00:00"|"just gone midnight"|"It was just gone midnight, and gradually doors were closing and lights were being turned out in the hotel. In the height of summer, Pennfleet might still be lively at this time, but it was too early in the season for raucousness and revelry. Even the stags had gone to bed, knowing they had to be up for a day’s sailing first thing in the morning: they all knew from experience that hangovers and sea were bad bedfellows, and they were saving up the real celebration for the next night. A gentle quiet descended on the building as the night wrapped its softness around the walls."|"The Long Weekend"|"Veronica Henry"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"He looked over at the bed, at his sleeping wife. She was out for the count, and would be until nine o’clock tomorrow, thanks to the pills. There was no way she would sleep without them. He had put his foot down, after years of her pacing the floor, gazing out of the window, smoking cigarettes (which he’d finally got her to stop). He’d sent her to the doctor. He didn’t want her tranquillised, but she had to sleep. She’d drive herself insane otherwise."|"The Long Weekend"|"Veronica Henry"
"ap 01:38"|"One thirty-eight"|"In a room two floors above, Nick sighed and looked at his watch. One thirty-eight. He should have been long asleep by now, but it wasn’t going to happen. He threw back his duvet, got out of bed and stood by the window, watching as the moon slid shyly out from behind a cloud, like a girl appearing from behind a changing room curtain. He thought about leaning out of the window and having a cigarette. It wouldn’t, he knew from experience, set the smoke alarm off. But somehow he didn’t want to break the rules in Claire’s hotel. Maybe he’d go outside, take a walk in the fresh air and clear his head. He’d drunk a fair bit tonight, though not a ridiculous amount by stag-weekend standards. Nevertheless, the melancholy that a surfeit of cocktails, wine and tequila shots often brought was settling in. Melancholy, disconcertion and paranoia."|"The Long Weekend"|"Veronica Henry"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"In the meantime, he had the rest of his stag weekend to struggle through. The six of them were due to be getting a boat for the day. It was anchors away at ten o’clock – they needed to be up, dressed and fed by then. He looked at his watch. Seven o’clock. The dining room should be open any minute. But he couldn’t face going down to breakfast in case he saw her. He decided to ring room service."|"The Long Weekend"|"Veronica Henry"

"ap 11:00"|eleven|"He couldn’t help feeling that at eleven, she was a bit old for shell-gathering. But then she didn’t seem to have had much of a childhood at all, so perhaps she was making up for lost time.

18:00|"six that evening"|"By six that evening, the Townhouse was absolutely buzzing. Half of Pennfleet seemed to have decided to pop in for a drink on the terrace. Mitch the barman was panicking that he might run out of ice, and sent a waiter down to the Spar shop for some spare bags for the freezer just in case. Everyone, it seemed, was in a holiday mood. The sun had brought out the best in them."|"The Long Weekend"|"Veronica Henry"
"ap ~ 06:00"|"gone six o’clock"|"Laura was sitting at a table on the terrace, reading Stieg Larsson and nursing a Sea Urchin. The barman had talked her into it. It was his special cocktail for the bank holiday weekend, and he had wanted a guinea pig, so she had agreed. She was sipping it cautiously – she was a white wine girl usually – but she was enjoying the slightly heady sensation it gave her. It stopped her worrying about Dan. She was back earlier than expected, after all. She didn’t want to phone him to find out where he was. She didn’t want to seem needy. She’d sent him a text saying Having a drink on the terrace. See you soon xx but had heard nothing back. Every time someone wandered over to the railings to look at the view, she looked up to see if it was him. But it was gone six o’clock and still no sign."|"The Long Weekend"|"Veronica Henry"

"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"By three o’clock, Claire was exhausted. She wasn’t officially supposed to be working in the restaurant, but she liked to oversee it when they were at full capacity.

She could almost – almost – imagine Isobel bounding down the stairs, greeting her with delight, hugging her . . ."|"The Long Weekend"|"Veronica Henry"
