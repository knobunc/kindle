12:00|midday|"Ira strained the rice water into wooden bowls for us -- the rice itself we kept for our midday meal -- but to one bowl she added a handful of the cooked rice and a little salt, which we could not afford for ourselves, and this she handed to Kenny, stooping low and keeping her eyes down."|"Nectar in a Sieve"|"Kamala Markandaya"
"< 00:00"|"Towards midnight"|"As night came on -- the eighth night of the monsoon -- the winds increased, whining and howling around our hut as if seeking to pluck it from the earth. Indoors it was dark -- the wick, burning in its shallow saucer of oil, threw only a dim wavering light -- but outside the land glimmered, sometimes pale and sometimes vivid, in the flicker of lightning. Towards midnight the storm was at its worst. Lightning kept clawing at the sky almost continuously, thunder shook the earth. I shivered as I looked -- for I could not sleep, and even a prayer came with difficulty."|"Nectar in a Sieve"|"Kamala Markandaya"
12:00|midday|"The rest of the week they worked at the tannery, going there soon after daybreak and not coming back until it was dark. By the time they had entered their late teens they were earning good wages: a rupee for each day's work, and without fail they would hand me their earnings, keeping nothing back for gaming or whoring as many of the lads did. Each morning I cooked rice for them, sometimes dhal or vegetables as well, which they took with them to eat at midday; and when they came home I gave them rice water and dried fish, sometimes a little buttermilk or perhaps even a few plantains I had kept from selling. But from what they gave me I had also to buy clothes for them, for they were expected to put on shirts over their loincloths, and red turbans on their heads, so that although we had full bellies and were well clothed, there was not much left over, and the hope I secretly cherished of putting by some money for Ira soon withered; and when it finally died I recovered my peace of mind and was happy enough."|"Nectar in a Sieve"|"Kamala Markandaya"
12:00|midday|"If there was nothing to be done in the fields Nathan would accompany me when I went to market. This happened so seldom that it was always an occasion, and to round it off we would go to the tannery to see our sons. They invariably came out at midday for their meal, and we would sit with them for a few minutes, talking while they ate their rice and enjoying the rest. Then one day -- a bright, soft morning with a whisper of rain in it -- we got there to find the gates closed and guards posted along the iron railings that encircled the compound."|"Nectar in a Sieve"|"Kamala Markandaya"
12:00|Midday|"Midday, mid-afternoon, still no sign of any workers. At last I pluck up courage to enquire of the guards -- it needs courage, for they are in uniform, and have lathis strapped to their wrists."|"Nectar in a Sieve"|"Kamala Markandaya"
12:00|midday|"I went on with my work, scrubbing the bloodstains, rinsing the cloth, laying it on the grass to dry: then I came back, swept and cleaned the hut, cleared the courtyard, removed all signs of the struggle that had been. The sun was moving to midday by the time I had finished. Now that there was nothing more to do, the thoughts I had so far avoided came crowding in on me in agitated turmoil. Who had given her the money? Why? Had she stolen it, and if so how and who from?"|"Nectar in a Sieve"|"Kamala Markandaya"
12:00|midday|"The carter is asleep on his jointed perch: the bullocks know the route well, they keep on without guidance from him. At midday we halt near a small wayside well. The carter wakens, snorts, stretches himself before climbing down. We are to eat here, he says, and he unyokes the bullocks to water them. I see one of them has a large raw patch on its shoulder where the yoke has rubbed the skin off."|"Nectar in a Sieve"|"Kamala Markandaya"
"< 12:00"|"nearly midday"|"It being nearly midday we sat down to rest by the roadside. A dozen or more children were playing there, dodging in and out of the traffic with a skill and indifference which I could not help admiring. For all their play they looked as if they had never eaten a full meal in their lives, with their ribs thrust out and bellies fullblown like drums with wind and emptiness; and they were also extremely dirty with the dust of the roadside and the filth deposited upon it; and the running sores many of them had upon their bodies were clogged with mud where blood or pus had exuded. But they them selves were forgetful of their pains -- or patient with them as the bullock had been -- and played naked and merry in the sun. Merry, that is, until a crust of bread fell on the road or a sweetmeat toppled from an overambitious pyramid when, all childishness lost, all play forgotten, they fought ferociously in the dust for the food . . . my children had fought thus too, I remembered, but time had mellowed the memory or dimmed it, for it did not seem to me that they had struggled like these: teeth bared, nails clawing, ready, predatory like animals. But when a man of wealth passed they were as tender and pitiful as fledglings, beseeching with soft open mouths and limpid eyes, their begging bowls meekly held before them and altogether changed with an artfulness which surely my children had not at their command. And however much they played and were children, still their faces were scored with the knowledge and cares that children should not have, their eyes were knowing and guileful beyond their years."|"Nectar in a Sieve"|"Kamala Markandaya"

12:00|midday|"At midday, as she had said, she came back. She had told us to wait, yet now her attitude said very clearly: You should not have taken me at my word, what I said was said in duty and for no other reason. In a sullen silence she began preparing the meal, lighting the fire, fetching the water, boiling the rice, the baby astride her hip as before and whimpering unheeded. She did not speak until we had eaten. Then she looked up."|"Nectar in a Sieve"|"Kamala Markandaya"
"ap 01:00"|one|"The overseer's hut was built some distance away from the quarry -- a small affair with thatched roof and pressed-fibre walls. The two doors, one at either end, were both open. A long line of people was moving in slowly at one; from the other, people were coming away, not with sacks but with money. I joined the line, empty-handed. Puli was standing some distance away; from somewhere he had produced a begging bowl which he held in the crook of his elbow, while he displayed his mutilated hands to the passers-by. He had altered his voice, I noticed, making it weak and quavery while he uttered his sing-song plea: ""Take pity on an orphan child, take pity . . ."""|"Nectar in a Sieve"|"Kamala Markandaya"

00:00|Midnight|"Midnight, and, as always before, his paroxysms eased. The fits of shivering stopped, the stiff limbs fell limp and relaxed. In the calm stillness I saw him open his eyes, his hand came to my face, tender and searching, wiping away the unruly tears."|"Nectar in a Sieve"|"Kamala Markandaya"
