I was about to put my bag down and embrace him, hold him close to me, carry him, all those things once more, when, breathless and feeling a strange flutter of expansion in my heart, I stopped in my tracks.
“We’ll just make it,” said Lucien, “the next show is at one.”
In the heat of the theater, on the verge of tears, happier than I had ever been, I was holding the faint warmth of his hand for the first time in months. I knew that an unexpected surge of energy had roused him from his bed, given him the strength to get dressed and the urge to go out, the desire for us to share a conjugal pleasure one more time—and I knew, too, that this was the sign that there was not much time left, a state of grace before the end. But that did not matter to me, I just wanted to make the most of it, of these moments stolen from the burden of illness, moments with his warm hand in mine and a shudder of pleasure going through both of us because, thank heavens, it was a film we could share and delight in equally."|"The Elegance of the Hedgehog"|"Muriel Barbery"

Death does not frighten me, least of all that of Pierre Arthens, but it is the waiting that is unbearable, this suspension of time when something has not yet happened and where we feel how very useless it is to struggle. I sit on in the kitchen, in silence, in the half-light, a bitter taste of absurdity in my mouth. My mind drifts slowly. Pierre Arthens . . . A brutal despot, hungry for glory and accolades and yet, torn to the very end between an aspiration for art and a thirst for power, he endeavored to use language in pursuit of an illusion. Which way lies truth, in the end? In power, or in Art? Is it not the power of well-crafted discourse which enables us not only to sing the praises of mankind’s creations but also to denounce as a crime of illusory vanity the urge to dominate, which moves us all—yes, all, even a wretched concierge in her cramped loge who, although she may have renounced any visible power, nevertheless pursues those dreams of power in her mind?"|"The Elegance of the Hedgehog"|"Muriel Barbery"

So I figured the day in Chatou would be an unbelievable ordeal, and bingo: Maman and Colombe go into raptures about the bathtub, Papa looks as if he’s just swallowed his umbrella, and old dried-out bedridden invalids are being wheeled around the corridors with all their drip bags. A madwoman (“Alzheimer’s,” said Colombe with a learned air—yeah, really!) calls me “Pretty Clara” and shouts two seconds later that she wants her dog right away, practically poking my eye out with her huge diamond ring and to boot, someone even tries to escape! The residents who are still healthy have electronic bracelets around their wrists: when they try to go outside the walls of the residence it beeps at the reception desk and the personnel rush out after the fugitives who, obviously, get caught after a hundred hard-earned yards and who protest vigorously that this is not supposed to be the Gulag, and they ask to speak to the director and make all sorts of weird gestures until they are shoved into their wheelchairs.

"ap ~ 05:00"|"around five o’clock"|"But I want see the positive side of things: at least he is here, and really here, and what’s more we had a very interesting conversation yesterday. First of all, there’s the fact that everyone in the building is absolutely crazy about Monsieur Ozu. My mother speaks of nothing else, my father listens to her for once, whereas usually his mind is elsewhere when she starts to go blah-blah-blah about the goings-on in the building; Colombe pinched my Japanese textbook and, in an unprecedented event in the annals of 7, rue de Grenelle, Madame de Broglie came to have tea chez nous. We live on the fifth floor, directly above the former Arthens apartment and lately there has been all this remodeling work going on—a gigantic amount of remodeling! It was clear that Monsieur Ozu had decided to change everything, and everyone was drooling with desire to see what he had changed. In a world full of fossils, the slightest movement of a pebble on the slope of the cliff is nearly enough to bring on a whole series of heart attacks—so you can imagine what happens when someone dynamites the whole mountain! In short, Madame de Broglie was dying to have a look at the fourth floor, so when she ran into Maman last week in the hall she wheedled an invitation out of her. And you know what her pretext was? It’s really funny. Madame de Broglie is the wife of Monsieur de Broglie, the State Councilor who lives on the first floor and who joined the Council under Giscard d’Estaing—he’s so conservative that he won’t say hello to divorced people. Colombe calls him “the old fascist” because she’s never read a thing about the French right wing, and Papa holds him up as a perfect example of the ossification of political ideas. His wife fits the image: posh suit, string of pearls, pinched lips and loads of grandchildren called Grégoire or Marie. Until now she would scarcely say hello to Maman (who is a Socialist, dyes her hair and wears pointed shoes). But last week she jumped on us as if her life depended on it. We were in the hall, we had just come back from shopping and Maman was in a very good mood because she had found an eggshell linen tablecloth for two hundred and forty euros. And I swear I thought I was having auditory hallucinations. After the customary “Bonjour, Madame,” Madame de Broglie said to Maman, “I have something to ask you,” which must have really hurt her lips. “Please, go right ahead,” said Maman with a smile (thanks to the tablecloth and her anti-depressants). “Well, my little daughter-in-law, Étienne’s wife, is not very well these days and I think she’ll have to consider therapy.” “Oh?” said Maman with an even bigger smile. “Yes, uh, you see, some sort of psychoanalysis.” Madame de Broglie looked like a snail lost in the Sahara but she stood fast all the same. “Yes, I see,” said Maman, “and how may I be of assistance, Madame de Broglie?” “Well, the thought occurred to me that you might have an idea . . . well . . . how to go about it . . . so I would have liked to discuss it with you, that’s all.” Maman could not get over her good fortune: an eggshell linen tablecloth, the prospect of spouting all her knowledge about psychoanalysis and Madame de Broglie dancing the dance of the seven veils—oh yes, a good day indeed! And she couldn’t resist because she knew perfectly well what the other woman’s actual intention was. My mother may be a bit of a bumpkin in the intellectual subtlety category, but you still can’t fool her completely. She knows perfectly well that the day the de Broglies are genuinely interested in psychoanalysis, the Gaullists will start singing the Internationale—clearly, the name of her sudden success was “the fifth-floor landing lies directly above the fourth-floor landing.” Still, she decided to act magnanimously, to prove to Madame de Broglie how kind and open-minded socialists can be—but not without a little hazing to begin with. “By all means, Madame de Broglie. Would you like me to come to your place one evening to discuss it?” she asked. The other woman looked constipated, she wasn’t expecting such a suggestion, but she got hold of herself very quickly and, as a woman of the world, she said, “No, no, please, I don’t want you to have to come down, I will come up to see you.” Maman had already had her little moment of satisfaction so she didn’t insist. “Well, I’m in this afternoon,” she said, “why don’t you come have a cup of tea at around five o’clock?”"|"The Elegance of the Hedgehog"|"Muriel Barbery"

In reality, I’ve never read a thing by Jakobson, obviously not. Though I may be supersmart, I’d still rather read mangas or literature.

It is sidereal, as inebriating as bad wine and above all a perfect illustration of the way the university works: if you want to make a career, take a marginal, exotic text (William Ockham’s Sum of Logic) that is relatively unexplored, abuse its literal meaning by ascribing to it an intention that the author himself had not been aware of (because, as we all know, the unknown in conceptual matters is far more powerful than any conscious design), distort that meaning to the point where it resembles an original thesis (it is the concept of the absolute power of God that is at the basis of a logical analysis, the philosophical implications of which are ignored), burn all your icons while you’re at it (atheism, faith in Reason as opposed to the reason of faith, love of wisdom and other bagatelles dear to the hearts of socialists), devote a year of your life to this unworthy little game at the expense of a collectivity whom you drag from their beds at seven in the morning, and send a courier to your research director."|"The Elegance of the Hedgehog"|"Muriel Barbery"

A very serious accident. She’s dead.” He was crying. He squeezed my hand very hard. “Dear God, who is Renée?” asked my mother, alarmed. “Madame Michel,” answered Kakuro. “Oh!” she went, relieved. He turned away from her, disgusted. “Paloma, I have to take care of a lot of not very cheerful things, but we’ll see each other later on, okay?” he said. I nodded, and squeezed his hand very hard, too. We acknowledged each other in the Japanese manner, a quick little bow. We understand each other. We’re both hurting, hurting."|"The Elegance of the Hedgehog"|"Muriel Barbery"
