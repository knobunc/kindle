On March thirteenth that year I had done some impressions in class and people loved it, so I was being taken up to the main campus to do a speech course. It was a beautiful spring-weather day. I went to six o’clock mass because I had to work seven till three and I remember walking to church up these steps and being very aware of how happy I was. Then I worked and went to a bowling class. I went home and drove my car up to the branch campus and we met the professor and two other students. I’d never been up to the main campus and it was hustle and bustle and beautiful and I was very aware of that. I remember the whole day and all my feelings, as well as the cool breeze against my face. It was just a really nice day.”"|Unthinkable|"Helen Thomson"

It was 2010, and Gómez had asked him to complete this task so that he had a record of what color auras Rubén associated with certain images of faces, animals, letters and numbers. There were so many images it would have been impossible for Rubén to memorize each one."|Unthinkable|"Helen Thomson"
20:01|2001|"“No. When I woke up I found it difficult to recognize people. Bits about my childhood came back but not everything. I found out a lot through stories that people tell me. But sometimes I think they’ve made the stories into a kind of Chinese whispers. Their stories become bigger, so I take no notice of them. My memory starts at 2001.”"|Unthinkable|"Helen Thomson"

From the comfort of my air-conditioned taxi, I watch the gleaming skyscrapers flash by my window. The gigantic brown and gold turrets of the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque—the largest in the United Arab Emirates—stand on the horizon. We travel west until we reach the outskirts of the city, where the grand buildings disintegrate into tiny rows of rundown shops. As we turn onto a five-lane highway lined with palm trees, quite suddenly the buildings disappear, as if we’ve reached some invisible border. The view on either side becomes a barren mix of desert dunes, the odd tree and an occasional sign for a distant camel racetrack."|Unthinkable|"Helen Thomson"
20:05|2005|"Over dinner, Joel tells me about a couple of times that he has been a patient himself. One time was after a terrible car accident, in which his car rolled and left him in intensive care with lacerations and a cervical collar around his neck. Now, whenever he sees someone his age with a cervical collar, his sensations are at their most vivid because he knows exactly what they feel like. His second experience of being in a hospital was even more dramatic. It was 2005, and Joel was in Haiti working with the local government, providing medical services to hard-to-reach areas of the country. During the trip, Joel developed a sudden headache. “It was different to a migraine—it was really specific to the right side of my head,” he says."|Unthinkable|"Helen Thomson"
