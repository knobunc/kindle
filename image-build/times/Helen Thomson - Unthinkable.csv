On March thirteenth that year I had done some impressions in class and people loved it, so I was being taken up to the main campus to do a speech course. It was a beautiful spring-weather day. I went to six o’clock mass because I had to work seven till three and I remember walking to church up these steps and being very aware of how happy I was. Then I worked and went to a bowling class. I went home and drove my car up to the branch campus and we met the professor and two other students. I’d never been up to the main campus and it was hustle and bustle and beautiful and I was very aware of that. I remember the whole day and all my feelings, as well as the cool breeze against my face. It was just a really nice day.”"|Unthinkable|"Helen Thomson"

09:00|"nine o’clock in the morning"|"It is nine o’clock in the morning and already the thermometer in the car is creeping up to 111 degrees Fahrenheit. From the comfort of my air-conditioned taxi, I watch the gleaming skyscrapers flash by my window. The gigantic brown and gold turrets of the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque—the largest in the United Arab Emirates—stand on the horizon. We travel west until we reach the outskirts of the city, where the grand buildings disintegrate into tiny rows of rundown shops. As we turn onto a five-lane highway lined with palm trees, quite suddenly the buildings disappear, as if we’ve reached some invisible border. The view on either side becomes a barren mix of desert dunes, the odd tree and an occasional sign for a distant camel racetrack."|Unthinkable|"Helen Thomson"
