His right forearm, torn by the hooked beak of the white-headed one the night before, felt hot and swollen now; and he was so tired that his entire body ached."|"Lake of the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"The whipping had evoked a spectral glow from the lights, enough for him to distinguish the hands of the busy little clock beside his triptych. It was after midnight."|"Lake of the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
12:00|midday|"It was not until he stepped out into the garden that Silk realized how hot it had been in the manteion, near the altar fire. The whole place seemed to glow; the rabbits lay on their sides gasping for breath, and Maytera Marble’s herbs were wilting almost visibly; but to him the hot, dry wind felt cool, and the burning bar that was the midday sun, which should have struck him like a blow, seemed without force."|"Lake of the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
"ap ~ 04:00"|"about four o’clock"|"The big man shook his head. “I’ve been up all night, like I told you. But I’ll tell you what. Let me get a little sleep, and I’ll meet you in Limna where the wagons stop. Say about four o’clock.”"|"Lake of the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"“You’ll want the six o’clock wagon, then,” the driver said as he turned away."|"Lake of the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
"ap 04:00"|"Four o’clock"|"“You talk to the respectable people in the respectable places. I’ll ask around in the drinking kens. When did … Auk? Say he’d meet us here?”
“Four o’clock,” Silk told her.
“Then I’ll meet you right here at four. We can have a bite to eat. With Auk? And tell each other whatever we’ve learned.”"|"Lake of the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"

12:00|noon|"“May every god be with you this, er, noon, Patera,” Remora said as soon as his prothonotary had closed the door behind Gulo. It was extraordinary condescension."|"Lake of the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
"< 12:00"|"Shortly before noon"|"“Shortly before noon, I believe—perhaps about eleven. I’d ridden the first wagon from Viron, and I must have spent at least an hour in Limna before I started up the Pilgrims’ Way to Scylla’s shrine.”"|"Lake of the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
"ap ~ 00:35"|"about twenty-five to one"|"“You and me said three to one would probably end up with me dead. All right, eighty-seven thousand seven hundred and fifty against thirty-five hundred tinpots, which is about what we think Wick’s got, just to grab a for instance, makes it about twenty-five to one.”"|"Lake of the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
"ap 03:45"|"Three forty-five"|"“Some god overheard him—I believe I can guess which. What time is it, Captain?”
“Three forty-five, My Caldé.”
“Too early to start back to the city, then. Sit—no, first bring the trooper who’s watching our window inside. Then I want you to sit down, all three of you, and tell us what’s been happening in Viron.”"|"Lake of the Long Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
