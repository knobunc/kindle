Maybe not. Women could be sly. If Ray didn’t know, it would be even better. How wonderful it would be to actually see Ray’s expression when he opened the paper! It was delivered a little after ten in the morning. Ray would be in his office. He might not even look at it for a while."|"Where Are the Children_"|"Mary Higgins Clark"

It was necessary, though, for him to establish a casual routine in Adams Port, because someday it might be important for people to dismiss his comings and goings as routine. That was why he bought milk and bread and meat at Wiggins’ Market always about ten in the morning. Nancy never left the house before eleven, and even then she always went to Lowery’s Market, down the road a half mile. And the Wigginses had begun to greet him as a customer of long standing. Well, he’d be there in a few minutes, right on schedule."|"Where Are the Children_"|"Mary Higgins Clark"

One of them might have gone into the house to the bathroom or for a drink of water, but not likely, not likely. Every day for a month straight he’d watched them.

They’d been out only fifteen minutes, and this frantic anxiety that was her constant albatross had to be conquered. Even now she suspected that Missy sensed it and was beginning to respond to her overprotection. She’d turn the wash on, then call them in. While they watched their ten-thirty television program, she’d have a second cup of coffee and look at the weekly Cape Cod Community News. With the season over, there might be some good antiques available and not at tourist prices. She wanted an old-fashioned settee for the parlor—the high-backed kind they used to call a “settle” in the seventeen-hundreds."|"Where Are the Children_"|"Mary Higgins Clark"

Jonathan often stopped by their office around five o’clock, when he picked up the evening paper, the Boston Globe.

The diving operation was a mess under optimal conditions. Maushop was among the biggest lakes on the Cape and one of the deepest and most treacherous. That was why over the years there’d been so many drownings there. You could be wading up to your waist and at the next step be in forty feet of water. If those kids had been drowned, it might be spring before their bodies surfaced.

She was useless here—useless. “Ray,” she said stiffly. “It’s ridiculous to bother you about this, but the office just phoned to remind me that Mr. Kragopoulos, who wrote about the Hunt property, wants to see it at two o’clock. Shall I get someone else to take him up there?”"|"Where Are the Children_"|"Mary Higgins Clark"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"High tide was seven o’clock tonight. At that time he’d take the children up through the attic to the outer balcony they called the widow’s walk. The water at high tide covered the beach below, broke furiously against the retaining wall and then, sucked by the violent undertow, rolled back to sea. That would be the time to drop the children . . . over . . . down . . . They might not be washed in for weeks. . . . But even if they were found in a few days, he’d prepared for that. He’d given them only milk and cookies. He wouldn’t be fool enough to feed them anything that would suggest that a person other than Nancy had fed them a real meal after breakfast. Of course, hopefully they’d be beyond analysis when they were found."|"Where Are the Children_"|"Mary Higgins Clark"

Leaving the tub like that was a clumsy way of making the point. And that duck floating in the tub. A child’s toy. He winced, disgusted. His hand touched the closet door. The satiny quality of the wood intrigued him. Really, this house was beautifully constructed. John Kragopoulos was a hardheaded businessman, but he also believed in instinct. His instinct told him that this house would be a good investment. They wanted three hundred and fifty thousand for it. . . . He’d offer two ninety-five and come up to three twenty.

09:00|"nine A.M."|"He turned on the transistor radio, and instantly the voice of Dan Phillips, the newscaster for WCOD in Hyannis, filled the room. “The case of the missing Eldredge children has just taken a new twist,” Phillips said, and his voice was pulsing with somewhat unprofessional excitement. “A mechanic, Otto Linden from the Gulf Station on Route Twenty-eight in Hyannis, has just phoned us to say that he can positively state that this morning at nine A.M. he filled the gas tank of Rob Legler, the missing witness in the Harmon murder case of seven years ago. Mr. Linden said that Legler appeared nervous and volunteered the information that he was on his way to Adams Port to visit someone who probably wouldn’t be glad to see him. He was driving a late-model red Dodge Dart.”"|"Where Are the Children_"|"Mary Higgins Clark"
"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"So Rob had gone over. Everything the guys had said about Nancy Harmon was true. She was a real looker. But she sure didn’t seem to know it. She was kind of hesitant . . . unsure of herself. He’d gotten over about noon. She was just feeding the two little kids . . . a boy and a girl. Quiet kids, both of them. She didn’t pay much attention to him, just thanked him for coming and turned back to the kids."|"Where Are the Children_"|"Mary Higgins Clark"
"ap ~ 09:30"|"about nine-thirty"|"Rob decided to drive straight through from Halifax. The less time he spent in the States, the less chance of getting picked up. He timed his arrival at the Cape for early in the morning. Jim had found out that Nancy’s husband always opened his office about nine-thirty. He’d get to her house around ten. Jim had made a map of her street for him, including that driveway through the woods. He could hide the car there."|"Where Are the Children_"|"Mary Higgins Clark"
"ap 09:45"|"quarter of ten"|"He drove into Adams Port at quarter of ten. Slowly cruising around, studying the map Jim had drawn for him, he got a feel of the layout. Even so he almost missed the dirt road leading to the woods behind her property. He realized that after he slowed up for that old Ford wagon pulling out from it. Backing up, he turned into the dirt road, parked the car and started walking to the rear door of Nancy’s house. That was when she’d come running out like a madwoman shrieking those names. Peter, Lisa, those were the dead kids. He followed her through the woods to the lake and watched when she threw herself into the water. He was just about to go after her when she dragged herself out and fell on the beach. He knew she looked in his direction. He wasn’t sure if she saw him, but he did know that he had to get out of there. He didn’t know what was happening, but he didn’t want to get involved."|"Where Are the Children_"|"Mary Higgins Clark"

"ap 02:30"|two-thirty|"“No problem.” The bartender was about forty, dark-haired, with exaggerated muttonchops. John liked both his obliging answer and the way he kept the bar immaculately neat.
