His face looked as boyish and innocent as ever but the lines of exhaustion round his eyes and mouth told an eloquent story. Last night he had travelled with the darts team from the Lord Nelson and had taken part in a gruelling match against the Dog and Gun at Drayton. The contest had been followed by a pie and peas supper and the consumption of something like twelve pints of bitter a man.

But I didn’t feel too bad about getting up; Raynes was only three miles away and the job held no prospect of hard labour - a colic in a little boy’s Shetland pony.

The young men were superbly fit and tough and I had been watching all morning in something like awe as they man-handled the wild, scattered beasts, chasing and catching tirelessly hour after hour. I had stared incredulously as Jack had run down a galloping heifer on the open moor, seized its horns and borne it slowly to the ground for me to inject; it struck me more than once that it was a pity that an Olympic selector was unlikely to stray :i into this remote corner of high Yorkshire - he would have found some worldbeating material."|"Let Sleeping Vets Lie"|"James Herriot"
