"ap 08:00"|"Eight o’clock"|"“I shall arrange a little party,” mused Shaitana. “Do not forget. Eight o’clock.”"|"Cards on the Table"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 08:15"|8:15|"“Our other guests are late,” said Mr. Shaitana. “My fault, perhaps. I believe I told them 8:15.”"|"Cards on the Table"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 00:10"|"Ten past twelve"|"Colonel Race looked at his watch.
“Ten past twelve. Time for another?”
“You’ll excuse me,” said Superintendent Battle. “But I’m by way of being an ‘early-to-bed’ man.”"|"Cards on the Table"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 01:25"|"one hour, twenty-five minutes"|"“I agree. Alas, that one cannot be more exact—that one cannot say, ‘This man has been dead one hour, twenty-five minutes and forty seconds.’”"|"Cards on the Table"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap ~ 09:30"|"about nine thirty"|"“I could only say very roughly. We began to play about nine thirty, I imagine. I should say it was about an hour later that I stoked the fire, quite a short time after that I fetched the drinks (next hand but one, I think), and perhaps half past eleven when I got myself a whisky and soda—but those times are quite approximate. I couldn’t answer for their being correct.”"|"Cards on the Table"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 11:30"|"half past eleven"|"“I could only say very roughly. We began to play about nine thirty, I imagine. I should say it was about an hour later that I stoked the fire, quite a short time after that I fetched the drinks (next hand but one, I think), and perhaps half past eleven when I got myself a whisky and soda—but those times are quite approximate. I couldn’t answer for their being correct.”"|"Cards on the Table"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap ~ 11:15"|"about 11:15"|"“Dr. Roberts got me a drink. He also got himself one—that was later. Major Despard also went to get a drink—at about 11:15, I should say.”"|"Cards on the Table"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap ~ 10:30"|"about half past ten"|"“I couldn’t say. First time might have been about half past ten, the second time eleven, but that’s pure guesswork. Mrs. Lorrimer went over to the fire once and said something to Shaitana. I didn’t actually hear him answer, but, then, I wasn’t paying attention. I couldn’t swear he didn’t. Miss Meredith wandered about the room a bit, but I don’t think she went over near the fireplace. Roberts was always jumping up and down—three or four times at least.”"|"Cards on the Table"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 08:15"|8:15|"“Never—no, I am wrong. About a week ago Dr. Roberts told me to enter up a dinner appointment in his engagement book. Mr. Shaitana, 8:15, on the 18th.”"|"Cards on the Table"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap ~ 06:00"|"about six o’clock"|"Superintendent Battle arrived at Wallingford about six o’clock. It was his intention to learn as much as he could from innocent local gossip before interviewing Miss Anne Meredith."|"Cards on the Table"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 08:00"|"Eight o’clock"|"“Well, no, sir. I hardly think they’d want to sell. Not so soon. They only got in two years ago. I’ve done for them from the beginning, yes, sir. Eight o’clock till twelve—those are my hours. Very nice, lively young ladies, always ready for a joke or a bit of fun. Not stuck up at all."|"Cards on the Table"|"Agatha Christie"

"ap 03:30"|"Half past three"|"“Oh, dear,” thought Rhoda. “I can’t go on standing here all day. Just because I’m such an idiot that I can’t make up my mind … I think that coat and skirt’s going to be awfully nice. I wonder if brown would have been more useful than green? No, I don’t think so. Well, come on, shall I go or shan’t I? Half past three, it’s quite a good time—I mean, it doesn’t look as though I’m cadging a meal or anything. I might just go and look, anyway.”"|"Cards on the Table"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 04:48"|4:48|"Then she said aloud.
“That bus will take us to Paddington. We’ll just catch the 4:48.”"|"Cards on the Table"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 11:30"|11:30|"“Sergeant O’Connor. Superintendent Battle’s compliments and would it be convenient for Mr. Hercule Poirot to come to Scotland Yard at 11:30?”"|"Cards on the Table"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 11:30"|11:30|"It was 11:30 to the minute when Poirot descended from his taxi at the door of New Scotland Yard—to be at once seized upon by Mrs. Oliver."|"Cards on the Table"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"So it came about that at three o’clock of that same afternoon, Rhoda Dawes and Anne Meredith sat primly on their chairs in Poirot’s neat room and sipped blackberry sirop (which they disliked very much but were too polite to refuse) from old-fashioned glasses."|"Cards on the Table"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap < 08:00"|"just before eight o’clock"|"“Roberts opened his letter just before eight o’clock. He lost no time, dashed off at once in his car, leaving his parlourmaid to communicate with us, which she did. He got to the house to find that Mrs. Lorrimer hadn’t been called yet, rushed up to her bedroom—but it was too late. He tried artificial respiration, but there was nothing doing. Our divisional surgeon arrived soon after and confirmed his treatment.”"|"Cards on the Table"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 10:30"|"half past ten"|"“Twelve,” said Anne. She was silent for a minute or two, then she said, “It’s only half past ten now. Let’s go out on the river.”"|"Cards on the Table"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 08:00"|"Eight o’clock"|"“This morning it was. Eight o’clock job at a lady’s house in Cheyne Lane. I started on the windows there. Lady was in bed. Looked ill she did. She was just turning her head round on the pillow. This gent I took to be a doctor. He shoved her sleeve up and jabbed something into her arm about here—” He gestured. “She just dropped back on the pillow again. I thought I’d better hop it to another window, so I did. Hope I didn’t do wrong in any way?”"|"Cards on the Table"|"Agatha Christie"
