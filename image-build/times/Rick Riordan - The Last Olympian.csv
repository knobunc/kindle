">> 00:00"|"well after midnight"|"We saw the battle before we were close enough to make out individual fighters. It was well after midnight now, but the bridge blazed with light. Cars were burning. Arcs of fire streamed in both directions as flaming arrows and spears sailed through the air."|"The Last Olympian"|"Rick Riordan"
12:00|midday|"Thalia shook her head. “I know Lady Artemis would be here if she could. Athena, too. But Zeus has ordered them to stay at his side. The last I heard, Typhon was destroying the Ohio River valley. He should reach the Appalachian Mountains by midday.”"|"The Last Olympian"|"Rick Riordan"
12:00|noon|"A distant blast shook the room. Green light blazed outside, turning the whole sea as bright as noon."|"The Last Olympian"|"Rick Riordan"
12:00|noon|"“And now,” Chiron said, “early to bed! Remember, you must vacate your cabins by noon tomorrow unless you’ve made arrangements to stay the year with us. The cleaning harpies will eat any stragglers, and I’d hate to end the summer on a sour note!”"|"The Last Olympian"|"Rick Riordan"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"Her dad walked in, scowling and blinking from the light. He had rust-colored hair a little darker than Rachel’s. It was smushed on one side like he’d lost a fight with his pillow. His blue silk pajamas had “WD” monogrammed on the pocket. Seriously, who has monogrammed pajamas?
“What is going on?” he demanded. “It’s three in the morning.”
“Couldn’t sleep,” Rachel said."|"The Last Olympian"|"Rick Riordan"
01:00|"one in the morning"|"We waited for a long time. Mrs. O’Leary curled up and took a nap. I could hear the crickets in the woods and an owl hooting. Traffic hummed along Central Park West. Horse hooves clopped down a nearby path, maybe a mounted police patrol. I was sure they’d love to find two kids hanging out in the park at one in the morning."|"The Last Olympian"|"Rick Riordan"
"~ 07:00"|"about seven in the morning"|"I don’t remember dozing off. Then again, it must’ve been about seven in the morning, mortal time, and I’d been through a lot."|"The Last Olympian"|"Rick Riordan"
