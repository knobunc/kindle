00:00|midnight|"Were these entirely natural catastrophes? Evidently not, if one is to believe accounts of the awful Christmas Eve of 1357, when Queen Joanna of Naples was staying in Rocca-Sparviera as the guest of her vassal and decided to attend midnight mass at the neighboring village of Coaraze. Nothing in the life of Joanna, who was married at the age of eight, widowed at twenty, and remarried a further three times, ever went smoothly, so plentiful were her enemies both outside and inside her family. A shattering surprise greeted her upon her return: the sight of her two murdered children, their bodies displayed on the table as if the centerpiece of some macabre banquet. As she departed the following day, insane with grief and anger and having first set fire to the castle, she is supposed to have sworn that “No rooster or hen will ever crow again on this blood-soaked rock.” Although the reality of Joanna’s adventures in Provence casts some doubt over the chronology of the affair, the barrenness and instability of the mountain, which left has nothing standing but these sinister yet magnificent ruins, will ultimately have lent the legend an air of truth."|"Atlas of Cursed Places"|"Olivier le Carrer"
23:00|"11 P.M."|"“The blinding fall of sand and stones, the intense blackness above and around us, broken only by the incessant glare of varied kinds of lightning and the continued explosive roars of Krakatoa, made our situation a truly awful one. At 11 P.M., having stood off from the Java shore, wind strong from the south-west, the island, west-north-west, eleven miles distant, became more visible, chains of fire appearing to ascend and descend between the sky and it, while on the south-west end there seemed to be a continued roll of balls of white fire; the wind, though strong, was hot and choking, sulfurous, with a smell as of burning cinders.”"|"Atlas of Cursed Places"|"Olivier le Carrer"
"ap ~ 03:00"|"about three o’clock"|"… we closed in with the Barnevelts, and running past Cape Deceit with its stony peaks, about three o’clock doubled the weather-beaten Cape Horn. The evening was calm and bright, and we enjoyed a fine view of the surrounding isles. Cape Horn, however, demanded his tribute, and before night sent us a gale of wind directly in our teeth. We stood out to sea, and on the second day again made the land, when we saw on our weather-bow this notorious promontory in its proper form—veiled in a mist, and its dim outline surrounded by a storm of wind and water. Great black clouds were rolling across the heavens, and squalls of rain, with hail, swept by us with such extreme violence, that the Captain determined to run into Wigwam Cove. This is a snug little harbour, not far from Cape Horn; and here, at Christmas-eve, we anchored in smooth water."|"Atlas of Cursed Places"|"Olivier le Carrer"

However, one should never listen to malicious gossip or joke about air and sea disasters. And disasters are something of which this triangle in the sea, wedged between Bermuda, Florida, and Puerto Rico, has had more than its fair share, starting with the enigma of Flight 19, a group of five US Navy fighters that vanished into thin air north of the Bahamas on December 5, 1945. This incident began as a routine training exercise. The TBF Avengers took off from Fort Lauderdale in the early afternoon on a sea bombing exercise. The control tower picked up the final message from the flight leader at 18:04 hours: “Keep strict formation.… We’re going to have to land on the sea.… When the first gauge drops below ten gallons, we’ll all descend together.” And then nothing. No trace was ever found of either the aircraft or their fourteen crew members. The inquiry established that the planes had flown in a circle for part of the afternoon, clearly lost, before getting low on fuel and attempting a landing. But the tragedy doesn’t stop there: A Catalina flying boat was dispatched in the early evening with thirteen people on board to assist Flight 19. It was never seen again either."|"Atlas of Cursed Places"|"Olivier le Carrer"
"ap 03:17"|3:17|"With regard to curses, mankind has had a close shave. The very first pages of the Bible give a pretty clear idea of the wretched atmosphere in which the world was created. In the book of Genesis, God, infuriated by Adam’s disobedience, utters the words “Cursed is the ground for thy sake!” (3:17) and informs the first human that, instead of dwelling in the Garden of Eden, he will be compelled to tire himself out working an unproductive earth in order to survive. In what looks like a general curse on the heads of all future Earth-dwellers, Adam is spared no detail of the difficulties his new status will bring: “In sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken” (3:17–19)."|"Atlas of Cursed Places"|"Olivier le Carrer"
