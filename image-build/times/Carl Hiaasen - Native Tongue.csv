17:00|"five p.m."|"Burton drove off and Yancy moved the cooler into the house. From a kitchen cupboard he retrieved the Barbancourt bottle and ambled to the deck and poured himself one more drink. Next door, the construction crew was gone. Yancy’s watch said five p.m. sharp."|"Native Tongue"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"~ 14:15"|"approximately 2:15 P.M."|"The man at the TV microphones was saying, “At approximately 2:15 P.M., two men entered the compound and attacked one of the wildlife exhibits with a sledgehammer, breaking the glass. One of our park employees courageously tried to stop the intruders, but was overpowered and beaten. The two men then grabbed a box of specimens from the exhibit arena and ran. In the confusion, the suspects managed to escape from the park, apparently by mingling with ordinary tourists aboard the Jungle Jerry Amazon Boat Cruise.”"|"Native Tongue"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 05:30"|"half past five"|"With a straight face, Winder repeated the names of the missing creatures. “Vance and Violet Vole. That’s lovely.” He glanced at his wristwatch, and saw that it was half past five. “Charlie,” he said, “you don’t happen to have any Darvons?”"|"Native Tongue"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 10:30"|"half past ten"|"At half past ten Joe Winder went down to The Catacombs, the underground network of service roads that ran beneath the Amazing Kingdom of Thrills. It was along these winding cart paths, discreetly out of view from visitors, that the food, merchandise, money and garbage were moved throughout the sprawling amusement park. It was also along these secret subterranean passageways that the kiddie characters traveled, popping up suddenly at strategic locations throughout the Amazing Kingdom and imploring tourists to snap their picture. No customers (“guests” was the designated term) ever were allowed to venture into The Catacombs, lest they catch a glimpse of something that might tarnish their image of the Amazing Kingdom—a dog rooting through a dumpster, for example. Or one of Uncle Ely’s Elves smoking a joint."|"Native Tongue"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 01:12"|"one twelve"|"“One of those days. Ninety-two in the shade, one twelve inside the possum suit. The AC went out, and so did Billy.” Carrie Lanier paused reflectively. “He was an older fella but still …”"|"Native Tongue"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"< 01:00"|"nearly one in the morning"|"Winder put the press release on Charles Chelsea’s desk and went home. By the time he called Nina, it was nearly one in the morning. He dialed the number and hoped she would be the one to answer."|"Native Tongue"|"Carl Hiaasen"
04:00|"four in the morning"|"The usual, Nina said, meaning four in the morning. “Want me to wake you up?”"|"Native Tongue"|"Carl Hiaasen"
13:30|"one-thirty in the afternoon"|"Which is where he snoozed at one-thirty in the afternoon when he heard a knock on the bulletproof glass."|"Native Tongue"|"Carl Hiaasen"
00:00|Midnight|"“Midnight sharp.” Nina shifted her weight from one leg to the other, rippling the water. “You’re not going,” she said. “Please?”"|"Native Tongue"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"The Card Sound Bridge is a steep two-lane span that connects the northern tip of Key Largo with the South Florida mainland. Joe Winder got there two hours early, at ten o’clock. He parked half a mile down the road and walked the rest of the way. He staked out a spot on some limestone boulders, which formed a jetty under the eastern incline of the bridge. From there Winder could watch for the car that would bring the mystery caller to this meeting."|"Native Tongue"|"Carl Hiaasen"
00:00|midnight|"As midnight approached, the other men stopped pretending to fish and concentrated on the road. Joe Winder realized that he was stranded on the jetty with two goons who probably were waiting to ambush him. Worse, they stood squarely between Winder and the relative safety of the island. The most obvious means of escape would be jumping into Card Sound; while exceptionally dramatic, such a dive would prove both stupid and futile. The bay was shallow and provided no cover; if the goons had guns, they could simply shoot him like a turtle."|"Native Tongue"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 02:50"|"two fifty"|"“Not much. Two hundred a week, sometimes two fifty. They get a bonus for selling videos. And panties, too. Twenty bucks a pair. They buy ’em wholesale from Zayre’s.”"|"Native Tongue"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 02:50"|"Two fifty"|"“Two fifty, that stinks,” said Carrie Lanier. “But, hey, I’ve been there. You do what you have to.”"|"Native Tongue"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"By eight the next morning, a crowd had gathered beneath the Card Sound Bridge to see the dead man hanging from the center span. From a distance it looked like a wax dummy with an elongated neck. Up close it looked much different."|"Native Tongue"|"Carl Hiaasen"
03:00|"three in the goddamn morning"|"He considered himself a competent burglar who was swift, thorough and usually cautious. The times he’d been caught—five in all—these were flukes. A Rottweiler that wasn’t in the yard the night before. A nosy neighbor, watering her begonias at three in the goddamn morning. A getaway car with bad plugs. That sort of thing. Occupational hazards, in Bud Schwartz’s opinion—plain old lousy luck."|"Native Tongue"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"“I’m a pro, Charlie.”
“That’s my boy. So you’ll give me Orky by four o’clock?”
“No sweat,” Winder said. “Three hundred words.”"|"Native Tongue"|"Carl Hiaasen"
00:00|midnight|"Rummaging through a dead man’s belongings at midnight was not Joe Winder’s idea of fun. The lab was as cold and quiet as a morgue. Intimate traces of the late Will Koocher were everywhere: a wrinkled lab coat hung on the back of a door; a wedding picture in a brass frame on a corner of his desk; a half-eaten roll of cherry-flavored Tums in the drawer; Koocher’s final paycheck, endorsed but never cashed."|"Native Tongue"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 10:00"|"ten-o’clock"|"“Later,” Winder said. “There’s a ten-o’clock show.” He hated going to the movies. Hated driving all the way up to Homestead."|"Native Tongue"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 08:30"|eight-thirty|"On Sunday, July 22, Charles Chelsea got up at eight-thirty, showered, shaved, dressed (navy slacks, Cordovan loafers, blue oxford shirt, burgundy necktie), trimmed his nose hairs, splashed on about three gallons of Aramis and drove off to work in his red Mazda Miata, for which he had paid thirty-five hundred dollars over dealer invoice."|"Native Tongue"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 04:07"|Four-oh-seven|"“Yeah, hosing down her Targa. And here we are in the middle of a drought.” Bud Schwartz braked softly to peer at the name on a cypress mailbox. “Danny, what’s that house number? I can’t see it from here.”
“Four-oh-seven.”
“Good. We’re almost there.”"|"Native Tongue"|"Carl Hiaasen"
00:00|midnight|"They stopped at a U-Tote-Em and bought two six-packs of Coors and a box of jelly doughnuts. In the parking lot they rolled down the windows and turned up the radio and stuffed themselves in jubilation. It was an hour until curfew; if they weren’t back by midnight, Molly had said, she would call the FBI and say her memory had returned."|"Native Tongue"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 00:30"|"half past twelve"|"Danny Pogue said he was hungry again, so they stopped to pick up some chicken nuggets. Again they ate in the parking lot, listening to a country station. Bud Schwartz had never before driven an automobile with a working clock, so he was surprised to glance at the dashboard of the Cutlass and find that it was half past twelve, and counting."|"Native Tongue"|"Carl Hiaasen"
12:00|noonday|"Skink led him through a hazardous obstacle course of discarded household junk—shells of refrigerators, ripped sofas, punctured mattresses, crippled Barcaloungers, rusty barbecue grills, disemboweled air conditioners—until they came to a very old Plymouth station wagon, an immense egg-colored barge with no wheels and no windshield. A yellow beach umbrella sprouted like a giant marigold from the dashboard, and offered minimal protection from blowing rain or the noonday sun. Skink got in the car and ordered Joe Winder to do the same."|"Native Tongue"|"Carl Hiaasen"
07:00|"seven in the morning"|"Charles Chelsea was summoned to Francis X. Kingsbury’s office at the unholy hour of seven in the morning. Kingsbury looked as if he hadn’t slept since Easter. He asked Chelsea how long it would take to get the TV stations out to the Amazing Kingdom of Thrills."|"Native Tongue"|"Carl Hiaasen"
12:00|noon|"“This celebration, make it for noon,” Kingsbury said. “Whoever comes through the turnstiles, strike up the band. But make sure it’s a tourist, no goddamn locals. Number five million, okay? In giant letters.”"|"Native Tongue"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 06:00"|"six-o’clock"|"“No, two is—chickenshit, really. Five’s better. And the parade, too, I’m serious.” Kingsbury stood up. He was dressed for golf. “A parade, that’s good video,” he said. “Plenty of time to get it for the six-o’clock news. That’s our best demographic, am I right? Fucking kids, they don’t watch the eleven.”"|"Native Tongue"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 11:30"|"half past eleven"|"Charles Chelsea worked feverishly all morning. By half past eleven the parade was organized. The gateway to the Amazing Kingdom of Thrills was festooned with multicolored streamers and hundreds of Mylar balloons. Cheerleaders practiced cartwheels over the turnstiles while the Tavernier High School band rehearsed the theme from Exodus. Several of the most popular animal characters—Robbie Raccoon, Petey Possum and Barney the Bison—were summoned from desultory lunch breaks in The Catacombs to greet and be photographed with the big winner. Above a hastily constructed stage, a billowy hand-painted banner welcomed “OUR FIVE-MILLIONTH SPECIAL GUEST!!!”"|"Native Tongue"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"It was nine o’clock when the knock came. Joe Winder was sitting in the dark on the floor of the apartment. He had the clip out of the gun, and the bullets out of the clip. A full load, too, sixteen rounds; he had lined up the little rascals side by side on a windowsill, a neat row of identical copperheaded soldiers."|"Native Tongue"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"< 00:00"|"Shortly before midnight"|"Shortly before midnight on July 23, Jim Tile received a radio call that an unknown individual was shooting at automobiles on Card Sound Road. The trooper told the dispatcher he was en route, and that he’d notify the Monroe County Sheriff’s Office if he needed backups—which he knew he wouldn’t."|"Native Tongue"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 04:02"|"two minutes after four"|"At two minutes after four, Bud Schwartz said it was time to get ready. Gingerly he put the gun in his pocket. “Leave the files under the seat,” he said. “We’ll make the trade after we got the money.”"|"Native Tongue"|"Carl Hiaasen"
20:00|"8 P.M."|"The show will be presented at 8 P.M. in the Rare Animal Pavilion, and will feature color slides, videotapes, rare outdoor film footage and a Claymation exhibit. Admission is $4 for adults, $2.50 for children."|"Native Tongue"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"Reporters began calling before eight o’clock. Charles Chelsea was summoned from home; he arrived bleary-eyed and tieless. Clutching a Styrofoam cup of black coffee, he hunched over the desk to examine Joe Winder’s newest atrocity."|"Native Tongue"|"Carl Hiaasen"
12:00|noon|"Chelsea waited for the sound of spitting. Then he said, “I’ll call a press conference for noon. We’ll get somebody, some scientist, to say the snakes are almost gone. Then we’ll reopen tomorrow.”"|"Native Tongue"|"Carl Hiaasen"
12:00|noon|"Danny Pogue turned on the portable TV and said, “That’s not a bad picture.” The noon news was just starting."|"Native Tongue"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 04:58"|"two to five"|"“It’s lunch hour, Carrie. You heard the whistle.” He took out a pair of waterproof Zeiss binoculars and scanned the shoreline until he found the stand of pigeon plums that Molly McNamara had told him about. The dreaded bulldozers had multiplied from two to five: they were parked in a semicircle, poised for the mission against the plum trees."|"Native Tongue"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 07:15"|seven-fifteen|"The phone bleeped in Charles Chelsea’s apartment at seven-fifteen. It might as well have been a bomb."|"Native Tongue"|"Carl Hiaasen"
