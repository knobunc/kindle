The poise and charm of the old man’s granddaughter had more than compensated for the awkward groom. A lucky man, said the guests. She is not the most beautiful woman in Bogotá, but of course, money has a beauty of its own. The bride’s brother, the one with the haunting black eyes, had performed the ceremony from the main altar of the cathedral. He had even trimmed his beard; wasn’t that the least he could have done with the metropolitan bishop there on the altar with him? Three hundred waiters in white coats had dispensed a hundred cases of French champagne, fifty pounds of Iranian caviar and five hundred pounds of Caribbean lobsters to 1,200 guests guarded by 300 policemen, 423 private bodyguards and a company of infantry commanded by one of the guests but deployed out of sight of the colonial finca Bolivar once owned. A catty social page reporter from The New York Times had assembled the box score. Bogotá’s El Tiempo called it “the wedding of the century” but left out the part about the policemen, the bodyguards and the soldiers. The bride’s mother wore a beige Givenchy of Chinese silk. The bride’s father wore a Savile Row morning suit with a perfect white carnation at his lapel. Everyone deferred to the old man from Bogotá. He was the patriarch, and it was his money that had paid for the champagne, the caviar, the soldiers and the bishop."|"Powder Burn"|"Carl Hiaasen"

The guy at the fuel dock asks where they’re going, and Larry, the dumb shit, says they’re going out all night swordfishing. This dockmaster is no idiot, so he mentions to this friend of his in the Marine Patrol that a bunch of young hotshots are taking out a big Bertram for a night of long-lining. And the Marine Patrol officer thinks this is hysterical because there isn’t a fisherman in his right mind who goes swordfishing in January off Hillsborough. It isn’t even swordfish season. So the Marine Patrol mentions this to a buddy of his in Customs, and to make a long story short, when the Maggie Doll comes back into the inlet at four A.M., eight jillion drug agents are waiting for her. And there’s my Larry, bless his dumb heart, snoring away on top of five thousand pounds of Colombian weed. He’s up at Lowell now, doing two years. He’s very mad at me because I won’t visit him, but I made up my mind. I’m through with him. There’s a good chance he’ll be disbarred because of this.”"|"Powder Burn"|"Carl Hiaasen"
