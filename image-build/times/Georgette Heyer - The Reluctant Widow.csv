"ap < 05:00"|"nearly five o’clock"|"Not until nearly five o’clock did Nicky return to Highnoons, and by that time Elinor was in such a temper that she could happily have boxed his ears. He was admitted by Barrow, who had evidently told him how his plan had miscarried, for he came at once to the book-room, laughing delightedly, and saying: ‘Oh, Cousin Elinor, indeed I beg your pardon! Have you been there all day? I don’t mean to laugh, but it is the drollest thing!’ He bent over Bouncer, who was frisking round him joyfully. ‘You rascal, what have you been about? Yes, good dog, down! down!’"|"The Reluctant Widow"|"Georgette Heyer"
00:00|midnight|"This, however, he would by no means agree to, indignantly demanding whether she thought him to be incapable of dealing unassisted with any midnight marauder. She mendaciously assured him that she had every confidence in his ability to capture, single-handed, any number of desperate persons, and he relented enough to show her a serviceable pistol which he had had the forethought to bring with him."|"The Reluctant Widow"|"Georgette Heyer"
00:00|midnight|"She agreed to it, tactfully concealing from him her comfortable conviction that no midnight visitor was at all likely to reward his vigil. Had she had any real fear that the Frenchman would return she must, she believed, have alienated her youthful guest for ever by divulging the whole to Barrow. She was happy in not feeling herself obliged to spoil sport in this dreary fashion, and volunteered instead to acquaint the Barrows with his intention of spending the night at Highnoons."|"The Reluctant Widow"|"Georgette Heyer"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"In the morning, Lord Bedlington made his appearance dressed for his journey. A somewhat malicious suggestion, put forward by John, that he must surely wish to attend the inquest, which was to be held in the coffee-room of the inn at Wisborough Green, he greeted with a strong shudder. His mind seemed to be divided between horror at an inquest’s having to be held over any member of his family, and a shocked realisation that he had come into Sussex quite improperly clad. His anxiety to put himself into mourning at once, coupled with a fear that Schultz, his tailor, might not be able to supply his needs in due time, formed the subjects of his breakfast-table conversation, and certainly hastened his departure. By ten o’clock his chaise was bowling away down the avenue, and Carlyon was giving orders for his own carriage to be brought up to the house."|"The Reluctant Widow"|"Georgette Heyer"
12:00|noon|"In spite of this assurance, it was in the expectation of suffering a considerable degree of embarrassment that the widow descended presently to the breakfast-parlour. But her uninvited guest put in no appearance, and Barrow explained, with a sniff of disapproval, that Crawley had carried up a tray to his bedchamber. Mr Cheviot, had said Crawley loftily, never left his room until noon."|"The Reluctant Widow"|"Georgette Heyer"
12:00|noon|"‘Oh, doesn’t he, by Jove?’ exclaimed Nicky. ‘Well, he will, then, for the funeral is at noon!’"|"The Reluctant Widow"|"Georgette Heyer"
"ap > 10:00"|"After ten"|"‘Yes, dear boy, so I was informed, and you see how early I am up! I grudge no exertion, but how I shall contrive to be dressed in time I know not. After ten already, and I dare say we must set out quite by eleven! Crawley, we must bear in mind that should the Fates be against me, which I do trust, however, will not be found to be the case. I might be obliged to spend an hour over the arrangement of my neckcloth, and that would make me late, you know. Perhaps I should make the first attempts at once.’"|"The Reluctant Widow"|"Georgette Heyer"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"Apparently the cravats were not that day recalcitrant, for punctually at eleven o’clock Francis descended the stairs, dressed, with the exception of a gray waistcoat, in funeral black, and followed by Crawley, carrying his fur-lined cloak, gloves, hat, and ebony cane. His chaise stood at the door, and it had been arranged that he should take Nicky up with him as far as Wisborough Green, where funeral carriages were to await them."|"The Reluctant Widow"|"Georgette Heyer"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"She was so thankful to learn that he was indeed leaving Highnoons that she agreed to this with so much eagerness that he frowned, and reminded her gently that the evil properties of the east wind could scarcely be over-estimated. She said hopefully that perhaps the wind would not be found to be so very much in the east as he feared. ‘But you will not go without a little nuncheon, sir! Oh, dear, if it is not one o’clock already! I am sure so much has happened to-day I have not noticed how the time has flown! I will send to the kitchen directly!’"|"The Reluctant Widow"|"Georgette Heyer"
"ap 04:45"|"quarter of an hour to five o’clock"|"‘You are most obliging, dear ma’am, but if I am to reach London by dinner-time I must remove at once. And I could not support the notion of dining at an inn in my present sad state of health. I could not answer for the consequences! My chaise is called for already; indeed, I cannot imagine why it is not at the door, but these fellows take a delight in dawdling, you know! I wonder if Crawley has procured a hot brick to put at my feet? Where is Barrow? Ah, he has gone to fetch the clock, as I desired him to do! Miss Beccles, I have been searching my mind to discover in what way I may serve my kind hostess, for one must wish to show every observance! That clock, which has vexed her so much by its lamentable trick of declaring the hour to want but a quarter of an hour to five o’clock! A handsome timepiece, and so like my poor Cousin Eustace to let it remain out of order! But I will have it set to rights, ma’am, and it shall be attended to by my own clockmaker. I would not trust it to another, for some of those fellows, you know, meddle more than they mend. Pray inform Mrs Cheviot that her clock shall be returned to her in working order as soon as I can contrive it! Ah, here is Barrow! Place it carefully inside my chaise, Barrow, if you please! You will present my most respectful compliments to Mrs Cheviot, Miss Beccles, and of course my deep apologies for not making my adieux to her in person. She will, I trust, forgive me! That she will appreciate my anxiety to be safely in my own lodging before nightfall I cannot doubt. She has such exquisite sensibility! I am happy to think such an estimable female should have become one of my family. Ah, and dear Nicholas! Now, where is dear Nicholas? A charming boy, I am sure, if he would but outgrow his taste for savage mongrels. Barrow, you may send for Mr Nicholas: I know he will wish to say good-bye to me, and not for the world would I wound him by the smallest show of inattention!’"|"The Reluctant Widow"|"Georgette Heyer"
"ap < 03:00"|"just before three o’clock"|"The relief of knowing Francis to have left Highnoons was so great that after she had drunk her tea, and eaten some slices of bread-and-butter, Miss Beccles indulged herself with a nap in front of the parlour fire. She was roused by Nicky, who came in just before three o’clock, with the distressing intelligence that he had not yet succeeded in finding Bouncer, in spite of hunting all over Sir Matthew Kendal’s preserves, and twice falling foul of his keepers. ‘But I thought I should come back, to make sure all was well here,’ he said, ‘and that fellow Cheviot not playing off any more of his tricks!’"|"The Reluctant Widow"|"Georgette Heyer"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"It was four o’clock before Mrs Cheviot put in an appearance. She came down then, however, looking a little pale still, but declaring herself to be quite restored. ‘I must have been asleep for hours!’ she said. ‘No, indeed, I have not got the headache now, Becky – or only the least little degree of headache: nothing to regard!’"|"The Reluctant Widow"|"Georgette Heyer"
"ap 08:50"|"ten minutes to nine"|"He glanced at the bracket-clock on the mantelpiece, but as this had stopped, drew out his watch. ‘It is already too late,’ he said. ‘It wants only ten minutes to nine.’"|"The Reluctant Widow"|"Georgette Heyer"
00:00|midnight|"‘As to that, I would convey you in my own carriage, but you will hardly endear yourself to your future employer by arriving at midnight.’"|"The Reluctant Widow"|"Georgette Heyer"
"> 12:00"|"Shortly after noon"|"Shortly after noon, resigned but by no means reconciled, Mrs Cheviot was driven to Highnoons by her host. They went in his lordship’s carriage, very sedately, and his lordship beguiled the tedium by pointing out to the lady various landmarks, happy falls of country, or glimpses of woodland, which, he told her, would later on be carpeted with bluebells. Mrs Cheviot responded with cold civility, and inaugurated no topic of conversation."|"The Reluctant Widow"|"Georgette Heyer"
"ap 04:45"|"quarter to five"|"For one who had had little leisure of late years to indulge a taste for light reading this was luxury indeed, and not even the despondent tone of Miss Clara Reeve’s story, or the lachrymose behaviour of her heroine had the power to disgust Elinor. She read on, heedless of the time, alternately amused and interested by the exploits of the perfect Orlando, and very wisely skimming over his Monimia’s all too frequent fainting-fits. The guttering of one of the candles at last recalled her to a sense of the time; she glanced instinctively up at the bracket-clock on the mantelpiece, but its hands still pointed mendaciously to a quarter to five. The candles, however, had burned so low in their sockets that it was evident the hour was far advanced. Elinor got up, feeling a little guilty, as though an irate employer might later demand of her why she had so grossly wasted the candles; and restored her novel to its place on the shelf. A slight sound, as of a creaking stair, made her start. She realised that all had been silent in the house for a long time, and had certainly supposed that the servants must long since have gone up to bed. For a moment she was frightened; then she recollected how old stairs would creak long after they had been trodden on, picked up the bedroom candlestick which Barrow had brought in to her, and kindled the wick at one of those still burning in the room. A glance at the grate, to assure herself that there was no danger of the smouldering remnant of the log’s falling out to set the house on fire, and she snuffed the candles in the chandelier, and walked over to the door. She opened it, and stepped out into the hall, only to be brought up short by the unnerving sight of a complete stranger, in the act of crossing it in the direction of the book-room."|"The Reluctant Widow"|"Georgette Heyer"
23:50|"ten minutes to midnight"|"He spoke with the faintest trace of a foreign accent. The removal of his hat showed him to be dark-eyed, and dark-haired. He looked, at the moment, to be extremely discomfited, but his air and manner were both good, and the cast of his countenance spoke a reassuring degree of refinement. Elinor, feeling all the awkwardness of her own situation, blushed, and replied: ‘I fear you must have come, sir, to see one who is no longer here. I do not know how it is that the servant should leave you standing in the hall. Indeed, I did not hear the door-bell ring, and had supposed Barrow to have gone to bed.’ As she spoke, her eyes alighted on the tall-case clock, and she perceived with a start that the time wanted but ten minutes to midnight. She turned her amazed gaze upon the unknown visitor."|"The Reluctant Widow"|"Georgette Heyer"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"At eleven o’clock the sound of hoof-beats on the carriage-drive made her look out of the window. She saw the Hon. Nicholas Carlyon trotting up to the house on a stylish bay, a cross-bred dog, half lurcher, half mastiff, bounding along beside his horse. He caught sight of her, and waved his whip, calling out: ‘How d’ye do? Ned told me I should come over to see if you were tolerably comfortable.’"|"The Reluctant Widow"|"Georgette Heyer"
00:00|midnight|"She did not feel that his assistance in sorting linen would be of much practical help, but it occurred to her that he might be able to throw light on the identity at least of her midnight visitor. She described the encounter to him, therefore. He listened with much interest, and at the end said that his cousin Eustace had been a very loose screw, and that any friends of his were likely to prove ugly customers. But he was less concerned with the Frenchman’s name than with the manner of his entry."|"The Reluctant Widow"|"Georgette Heyer"
00:00|midnight|"‘Too smoky by half, cousin!’ he said. ‘A fellow don’t go creeping into a man’s house at midnight if he’s up to any good. Depend upon it, Eustace was concerned in some devilry or other!’"|"The Reluctant Widow"|"Georgette Heyer"
