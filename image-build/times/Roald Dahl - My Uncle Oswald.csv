"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"On the evening before I was due to depart for France, I gave a small party at our family house in Cheyne Walk. My father and mother had purposely gone out to dinner at seven o’clock so that I might have the place to myself. I had invited a dozen or so friends of both sexes, all of them about my own age, and by nine o’clock we were sitting around making pleasant talk, drinking wine and consuming some excellent boiled mutton and dumplings. The front doorbell rang. I went to answer it, and on the doorstep there stood a middle-aged man with a huge moustache, a magenta complexion and a pigskin suitcase. He introduced himself as Major Grout and asked for my father. I said he was out to dinner. ‘Good gracious me,’ said Major Grout. ‘He has invited me to stay. I’m an old friend.’"|"My Uncle Oswald"|"Roald Dahl"

19:00|"seven p.m."|"Arithmetic like that will mollify the heart of any landlady in France, and Madame Boisvain made no further protest. At seven p.m. we sat down to the evening meal. It was boiled tripe with onions. This I consider to be the second most repulsive dish in the entire world. The most repulsive dish is something that is eaten with gusto by jackaroos on sheep-stations in Australia."|"My Uncle Oswald"|"Roald Dahl"
00:00|midnight|"At midnight, when Monsieur and Madame B were well asleep, I slipped along the corridor and entered the bedroom of Mademoiselle Nicole. She was tucked up in an enormous bed and there was a candle burning on the table beside her. She received me, oddly enough, with a formal French handshake, but I can assure you there was nothing formal about what followed after that. I do not intend to dwell upon this little episode. It has nothing at all to do with the main part of my story. Let me just say that every rumour I had ever heard about the girls of Paris was substantiated during those few hours I spent with Mademoiselle Nicole. She made the glacial London debutantes seem like so many slabs of petrified wood. She went for me like a mongoose for a cobra. She suddenly had ten pairs of hands and half a dozen mouths. She was a contortionist to boot, and more than once amidst the whirring of limbs, I caught a glimpse of her ankles locked around the back of her neck. The girl was putting me through the wringer. She was stretching me beyond the point of endurance. I was not really ready at my age for such a severe examination as this, and after an hour or so of unremitting activity, I began to hallucinate. I remember imagining that my entire body was one long well-lubricated piston sliding smoothly back and forth within a cylinder whose walls were made of the smoothest steel. God only knows how long it went on, but at the end of it all I was suddenly brought back to my senses, by the sound of a deep calm voice saying, ‘Very well, monsieur, that will do for the first lesson. I think, though, that it will be a long time before you get out of the kindergarten.’"|"My Uncle Oswald"|"Roald Dahl"

‘Good idea,’ I said. ‘See you at six.’
One of the London banks had an overseas branch in Khartoum. I went there and changed some of my French francs for pounds. At six p.m. I sought out the hall-porter. He was now in the foyer of the hotel."|"My Uncle Oswald"|"Roald Dahl"

00:00|midnight|"I lay on my bed and read a book until midnight. I then undressed and got into my pyjamas. I took a pin and held it upright over the open tin of powder. I sprinkled a pinch of powder over the upright pinhead. A tiny cluster of grey powder grains remained clinging to the top of the pin. Very carefully, I raised this to my mouth and licked off the powder. It tasted of nothing. I noted the time by my watch, then I sat on the edge of the bed to await results."|"My Uncle Oswald"|"Roald Dahl"
16:00|"four in the afternoon"|"I knew what I had to do now, and I set about doing it straight away. I put on my best suit of clothes and made my way to the British Embassy. I did not, of course, go in by the Chancery Entrance. I knocked on the door of the Ambassador’s Private Residence, which was in the same imposing building as the Chancery, but at the rear. The time was four in the afternoon. A flunkey in white knee-breeches and a scarlet coat with gold buttons opened the door and glared at me. I had no visiting card, but I managed to convey the news that my father and mother were close friends of Sir Charles and Lady Makepiece and would he kindly inform her Ladyship that Oswald Cornelius Esquire had come to pay his respects."|"My Uncle Oswald"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 08:00"|"Eight o’clock"|"‘Good,’ she said, writing my name on the guest-list. ‘Eight o’clock tomorrow evening then. Good afternoon, my little man. It was nice meeting you.’ Already she had gone back to studying the guest-list, so I found my own way out."|"My Uncle Oswald"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"The next evening, sharp at eight o’clock, I presented myself at the Embassy. I was fully rigged-up in white tie and tails. A tailcoat, in those days, had a deep pocket on the inside of each tail, and in these pockets I had secreted a total of twelve small boxes, each with a single pill inside. The Embassy was a blaze of lights, and carriages were rolling up at the gates from all directions. Uniformed flunkeys were everywhere. I marched in and joined the receiving line."|"My Uncle Oswald"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"That night I slept well. I was still fast asleep at eleven o’clock the next morning when the sound of Madame Boisvain’s fists hammering at my door jerked me awake. ‘Get up, Monsieur Cornelius!’ she was shouting. ‘You must come down at once! People have been ringing my bell and demanding to see you since before breakfast!’"|"My Uncle Oswald"|"Roald Dahl"
19:14|1914|"Then the Great War broke out. It was 1914 and I was nineteen years old. I joined the Army. I had to, and for the next four years I concentrated all my efforts on trying to survive. I am not going to talk about my wartime experiences. Trenches, mud, mutilation and death have no place in these journals. I did my bit. Actually, I did well, and by November 1918, when it all came to an end, I was a twenty-three-year-old captain in the infantry with a Military Cross. I had survived."|"My Uncle Oswald"|"Roald Dahl"
"~ 01:00"|"around one in the morning"|"‘You’ll see in a moment. It was the month of May, nice and warm, and the time was around one in the morning. There was a bit of a moon shining which made it more dangerous, but we had to have some light to do what we were going to do. The journey took us an hour."|"My Uncle Oswald"|"Roald Dahl"
"~ 00:00"|"around midnight"|"I lay awake in bed that night and applied my mind assiduously to this problem. I may seem, to a reader of these diaries, like a pretty casual sort of fellow where most things are concerned, but I promise you that when my own most important interests are at stake I am capable of some very concentrated thinking. Somewhere around midnight an idea came to me and began whizzing around in my head. It appealed to me at once, this idea, for the simple reason that it involved the two things in life that I found most entertaining – seduction and copulation. It appealed to me even more when I realized that it involved a tremendous amount of seduction and copulation."|"My Uncle Oswald"|"Roald Dahl"
19:00|"seven p.m."|"At seven p.m., I took him to the Blue Boar in Trinity Street and I ordered for both of us. A dozen oysters each and a bottle of Clos Vougeot Blanc, a very rare wine. Then a dish of roast beef and a good Volnay."|"My Uncle Oswald"|"Roald Dahl"
"~ 21:30"|"about nine-thirty p.m."|"I stood on Trinity Street and watched him pedalling away into the night. It was still only about nine-thirty p.m. I decided to make my next move immediately. I got into the motor car and headed straight for Girton."|"My Uncle Oswald"|"Roald Dahl"

Woresley was bicycling home and I myself was in the Porter’s Lodge at Girton asking the old porter kindly to inform Miss Yasmin Howcomely that Mr Oswald Cornelius wished to see her on a matter of the most urgent nature."|"My Uncle Oswald"|"Roald Dahl"
17:30|"five-thirty in the afternoon"|"We now move forward to five-thirty in the afternoon of the following day. I myself was lying comfortably on the floor behind a row of wooden filing-cabinets in A. R. Woresley’s laboratory. I had spent much of the day wandering casually in and out of the lab, reconnoitring the terrain and gradually easing the cabinets twenty inches away from the wall so that I could squeeze in behind them. I had also left a one inch gap between two of the cabinets so that by looking through it I was able to get an excellent view along the whole length of the lab. A. R. Woresley always worked at the far end of the room, about twenty feet from where I was stationed. He was there now. He was fooling about with a rack of test tubes and a pipette and some blue liquid. He was not wearing his usual white coat today. He was in shirtsleeves and a pair of grey flannels. There was a knock on the door."|"My Uncle Oswald"|"Roald Dahl"

"ap > 06:00"|"after six o’clock"|"The time went slowly. I finished my preparations. I leaned out of the window and watched the carriages in the street below. Once or twice a motor car came by, but there were not so many here as in London. I looked at my watch. It was after six o’clock. I made myself a whiskey and soda. I carried it to the open window and sipped it there. I was hoping to see Yasmin stepping out of a carriage at the hotel entrance. I didn’t see her. I got myself a second whiskey. I sat down and tried to read a book. It was now six-thirty. She had been gone two and a half hours. Suddenly there was a loud knocking on my door. I got up and opened it. Yasmin, with cheeks afire, swept into the room."|"My Uncle Oswald"|"Roald Dahl"

‘Nine,’ Yasmin said, grinning. ‘Just nine minutes. When do we start?’
‘Tomorrow,’ I said. ‘I shall buy a motor car this afternoon. We’re going to need it for our French and European operations. And tomorrow we will drive to Essoyes and you will meet Monsieur Renoir.’"|"My Uncle Oswald"|"Roald Dahl"
16:00|"four in the afternoon"|"The next morning we set off for Essoyes with my travelling laboratory packed away in the back of the Citroën. We stopped at Troyes for lunch, where we ate trout from the Seine (I had two, they were so good) and drank a bottle of white vin du pays. We got to Essoyes at four in the afternoon and booked into a small hotel whose name I have forgotten. My bedroom again became my laboratory and as soon as everything had been laid out in readiness for the immediate testing and mixing and freezing of semen, Yasmin and I went out to find Monsieur Renoir. This was not difficult. The woman at the desk gave us precise instructions. A large white house, she said, on the right-hand side, three hundred metres beyond the church or some such thing."|"My Uncle Oswald"|"Roald Dahl"
16:00|"four in the afternoon"|"Monsieur Proust was our next choice. He was forty-eight years old, and six years back, in 1913, he had published Du Côté de chez Swann. Now he had just brought out A l’Ombre des Jeunes Filles en Fleurs. This book had been received with much enthusiasm by the reviewers and had won him the Goncourt Prize. But I was a bit nervous about Monsieur Proust. My inquiries showed him to be a very queer duck indeed. He was independently wealthy. He was a snob. He was anti-semitic. He was vain. He was a hypochondriac who suffered from asthma. He slept until four in the afternoon and stayed awake all night. He lived with a faithful watchdog servant called Céleste and his present address was an apartment at No 8 bis Rue Laurent-Pichet. The house belonged to the celebrated actress Réjane, and Réjane’s son lived in the flat immediately below Proust, while Réjane herself occupied the rest of the place."|"My Uncle Oswald"|"Roald Dahl"

In her bedroom at the Ritz, I helped Yasmin to dress. The wig was a beauty. It gave her a head of hair that was golden-bronze in colour, slightly curly and a bit on the long side. The grey trousers, the flowered waistcoat and the fawn jacket turned her into an effeminate but ravishingly beautiful young man."|"My Uncle Oswald"|"Roald Dahl"

He was working out the melody with one finger only, and it was wonderful to be standing out there somewhere in Italy on the edge of a lake at midnight listening to Giacomo Puccini composing what was almost certainly a graceful aria for a new opera. There was another pause. He had got the phrase right this time and he was writing it down. He was leaning forward with a pen in his hand and writing on the manuscript paper in front of him. He was jotting his musical notes above the words of the librettist."|"My Uncle Oswald"|"Roald Dahl"
