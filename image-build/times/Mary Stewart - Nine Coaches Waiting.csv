"ap 01:00"|one|"‘No. His bedroom’s the end one, then yours, then your sitting-room, then the nursery. Beyond that come Madam’s rooms, and the Master’s are round the corner above the library.’"|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"
"ap 05:30"|half-past-five|"His reserve showed itself not only towards me. Each evening, at half-past-five, I took him down for half an hour to the small salon where his aunt sat. She would politely put aside her book or writing-paper, pick up instead her exquisite and interminable petit-point, and hold conversation with Philippe for the half-hour. I say ‘hold conversation’ advisedly, because that phrase does perfectly imply the difficult and stilted communication that took place. Philippe was his usual quiet and withdrawn self, answering questions readily and with impeccable politeness, but asking none and volunteering nothing. Madame de Valmy was the one, it seemed to me, who had to violate her personality here: she, also naturally withdrawn, had to unbend, almost to chatter."|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"
"ap 06:16"|"Sixteen minutes past six"|"I glanced at the clock. Sixteen minutes past six. I looked in surprise at Madame de Valmy, whom I had suspected of a clock-watching nervousness almost equal to my own. She had dropped her hands in her lap again and was staring at the fire. She was a hundred miles away. I wondered where … no pleasant place, I thought."|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"
"ap 05:00"|"five-o’clock"|"‘But, my dear Philippe –!’ I broke off, and glanced down at the averted scarlet cap. ‘All right, you needn’t, but I must. I’ll get Berthe to come and give you some five-o’clock and stay with you till I get back to the schoolroom. I’ll ask Tante Héloïse if she’ll visit you upstairs instead of making you go down to the salon, and then we’ll play Peggitty till bedtime. How’s that?’"|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"Raoul crossed the room and opened the door for me.
‘At eight, then?’
‘Thank you. Yes.’"|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"It was three in the morning when the great car nosed its way up the zigzag, and – whether from excitement or sleepiness or the fines – I might have been floating up it in a dream. He stopped the car by the side-door that opened off the stableyard, and, still dreamily and no doubt incoherently, I thanked him and said goodnight."|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"
"ap < 05:00"|"almost five o’clock"|"It was almost five o’clock, one of those dark, rain-laden April days with a warm gusty wind blowing. There had been showers earlier, but now a belated gleam from the west glissaded over the wet housetops and etched the budding chestnuts of the square in pale gold against a slaty sky. Many of the shop windows were bright already, harshly-lit grocery stores and boucheries mirrored to soft orange and copper in the damp pavements. Over the flower-stall where Raoul had bought me the freesias a naked gas-jet hissed and flared in the gusty wind, now a snake-long lash of brilliant flame, now a flattened moths-wing of cobalt and sulphur-yellow. The tyres of passing cars hissed softly on the wet tarmac. Here and there among the bare chestnuts an early street lamp glowed."|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"
00:00|midnight|"I remember that the thought that surfaced first in my mind was that now Cinderella had no excuse to stay away from the ball. And – at midnight?"|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"
00:00|midnight|"‘Then I suppose I must. But I insist on coming too, and I’m not letting you faint with hunger by the way-side.’ He glanced at his wrist. ‘It’s close on midnight – that’s “dead of night”, isn’t it? Why don’t we break a few more rules and take some food upstairs. Then Philippe will get his excitement and we our celebration.’"|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"
00:00|Midnight|"Somewhere a clock whirred to strike. Midnight. I smiled. Dead of night exactly. I hoped Philippe was still awake."|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"
"ap 00:00"|twelve|"The clock was beating twelve as I moved quietly along the corridor. Then a thought touched me out of nowhere and I stopped short, staring down at the sandal in my hand. Midnight. The dropped slipper. The escape from the ball."|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"

00:00|midnight|"But he seemed animated enough. He said immediately: ‘You’ve been ages.’
‘You said “dead of night”, remember. It’s just midnight now.’
‘Midnight? Is it really?’ He looked pleased. ‘I kept the fire on. I knew you’d come.’"|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"
00:00|Midnight|"‘Midnight? Is it really?’ He looked pleased. ‘I kept the fire on. I knew you’d come.’"|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"
00:00|midnight|"‘That was hours ago,’ I said, ‘and I haven’t had mine. Wouldn’t you like to entertain your cousin Raoul and me to a midnight feast?’"|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"
00:00|midnight|"‘A midnight feast? Oh, Miss Martin.’ The big eyes sparkled in the moonlight, then looked uncertain. ‘Did you say my cousin Raoul?’"|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"
00:00|midnight|"‘Then it really is a midnight feast?’ said Philippe, eyeing his cousin a little shyly."|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"
00:00|midnight|"‘I’m told you had a midnight feast last night … an “illicit night out à trois” was the phrase, I believe. No nightmares afterwards?’"|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"
"ap < 01:00"|"nearly one o’clock"|"‘Why – yes, I reckon it is. It’s nearly one o’clock, isn’t it? But I don’t rightly know when Monsieur Hippolyte’ll get here. I think it won’t be till night, and then he mayn’t get up to Valmy till Thursday.’"|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"
"ap 01:15"|"quarter past one"|"‘The only possible thing. What’s the time?’
‘Going on quarter past one. I – we came away early.’
‘Did Bernard come up with you?’"|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"
00:00|midnight|"‘No, miss. But he goes to bed at midnight and he always switches it through to the Master’s room then.’"|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"
"ap 01:30"|one-thirty|"There wasn’t a minute to lose. Léon de Valmy might well assume that one-thirty would be a dead hour in the schoolroom wing. And the servants would be coming back from the dance between three and four. If anything was to be done tonight it would be done soon."|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"
00:00|midnight|"This was going to be the hardest part of the job. I put the coat and shoes down on the chair where I had sat for last night’s midnight feast, then, with a glance at the sleeping child, I crossed to the door and locked it. Deliberately, I refused to hurry. If this was to succeed at all it must be taken calmly."|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"
01:30|"one-thirty in the morning"|"I could hardly refuse to let her in. I noticed that there were no pockets to her long ivory-coloured robe, and that her hands were empty. Besides, if she was here to harm Philippe she would hardly demand entry from me in this unruffled fashion. Wondering confusedly how I was going to explain the fact that I was up and dressed at one-thirty in the morning, I opened the window. I said, as coolly as I could: ‘Good evening, madame.’"|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"
"ap 01:30"|"Half-past one"|"He lifted his head, and then pushed himself into a sitting position. ‘What’s the time?’
‘Half-past one.’
‘Haven’t you been to bed yet? Have you been to the dance in the village. You didn’t tell me.’"|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"
00:00|midnight|"With a hand that slipped a little on the doorknob I eased the door open, then took Philippe’s hand and tiptoed with him out into the dark corridor. Past the clock that had sounded midnight for us, down the stairs where I had lost my slipper, along the dim stretches of corridor walled with blind doors and the side-long painted eyes of portraits … the great house slid past us in the darkness as insubstantial as scenery in a Cocteau fantasy, until our breathless and ghostly flight was blocked by the heavy door that gave onto the stableyard and freedom."|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"
00:00|midnight|"It was locked. There must be some other way left for the servants to come in, but I didn’t dare turn aside to explore. The heavy key turned easily and quietly, but still the door wouldn’t move. My hands slid over the studded wood in the darkness, searching for a bolt. Beside me I heard Philippe take a little breath and began to shiver. Standing on tiptoe, groping above my head, I found the bolt, and pulled. It moved with a scream like a mandrake torn up in a midnight wood. The sound seemed to go on and on, winding back along the corridor in a creeping echo. I pulled at the door with shaking hands, listening all the time for the whine of the wheelchair. The door wouldn’t budge. Still it wouldn’t budge. I tried to feel if it had a spring lock beside the key, but couldn’t find one. He would be coming any minute now, to find us cornered in this dark passage-way. It didn’t need the shrieking bolts to tell him where we were and what we were doing. I could almost hear my panic-stricken thoughts pouring down the corridor to shout it at him. He would know. Oh yes, he would know. We were en rapport, the Demon King and I …"|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"
00:00|midnight|"In the forest it was very dark. My eyes had by now adjusted themselves, and we were able to pick our way between the trees without actual mishap, but very slowly, and with many stumbles and grazes, as the thick carpet of pine-needles was criss-crossed, and in places piled, with dead and spiky branches left when the woods were thinned. Once Philippe tripped and was only saved from falling by my hand, and once I had to bite back a cry of pain as I stumbled against some fallen snag of wood that stabbed at my leg for all the world like a sword. But Philippe made no complaint and, crazy though it may sound, I myself, with every yard of midnight wood put between me and Valmy, felt safer and happier. This wild mountain-side, tingling with the smell of the pines, was for all its secret and murmurous life no place of fear: that was Valmy with its lights and luxury. I realised that once again the word in my mind was ‘escape’: it was as if the brilliance and comfort of life at Valmy had been closing in, subtle, stifling, over-sophisticated. Now I was free. … The darkness took us. The air was cool and the silence was thick with peace."|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"
"ap ~ 05:00"|"gone five"|"‘As to that,’ said Jules frankly, ‘I can go to bed the whole bloody day, can’t I? Here, let’s make this stove up … aha, that’s better! Now, tell me what brings you up here at this hour? It’s gone five, surely? If you’re wanting the Englishman he’s down at the Coq Hardi for the night. What’s he done?’"|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"
00:00|midnight|"Bernard yawned again. ‘No, it doesn’t, but boys are queer cattle – almost as queer as women, friend Jules. And he and the Martin girl are very thick. The two of them had a midnight feast the other night, so I’m told. They’ll not have gone far … the boy hasn’t got his papers. Depend on it, it’ll be some silly lark or other. What else could it be?’"|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"
"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"Some time before noon we came, after a slowish journey of frequent stops, and one or two forced diversions, on the road I had hoped to find. This was a narrow road between steep banks, that wound stonily the way we wanted to go, high above the valley which carried the main traffic route to the south. Our last stage had taken us through a rough tract of thorns and dead bracken, so it was with some thankfulness that we clambered through the wire fence and negotiated the dead brambles that masked the ditch."|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"
12:00|noon|"There was no sound in the golden noon except the ripple of a skylark’s song. Philippe whispered beside me: ‘That was my cousin Raoul, mademoiselle.’"|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"
00:00|midnight|"He said, on a note of childish wonder: ‘But … he was so nice at the midnight feast.’"|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"
00:00|midnight|"‘Of course they had. The Englishman was up there last night till midnight. I know that. They’d go to find him. Have you found out where he is?’"|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"
"ap 00:00"|twelve|"Bernard said something that sounded surly and defensive, and I heard Raoul curse him again. Then the voices faded round the corner of the house. Seconds later the Cadillac’s engine started, and her lights swept their circle out of the driveway. The dog was barking once more. Madame Vuathoux must have come out of her cottage at the sound of the second car, for I heard Bernard speak to her, and she answered him in that high, overpitched voice: ‘He said he’d be here at twelve. Twelve at the latest.’"|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"
"ap 00:00"|"twelve o’clock"|"Philippe said dolefully behind me. ‘What are we going to do till twelve o’clock?’"|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"
"ap 23:45"|"Quarter to twelve"|"I reached clumsily for the torch. ‘The beach-ball, confound it. I’m sorry, Philippe. Don’t be frightened. Let’s have a look at the time … Quarter to twelve.’ I looked at him. ‘Are you cold?’"|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"
"ap 23:55"|"Five minutes to twelve"|"I glanced at my wrist. Five minutes to twelve. One of the windows looked out over the drive. No sign of a car. I turned to Hippolyte’s desk and picked up the telephone."|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"
"ap 23:55"|"five minutes to twelve"|"At least it was not the same unpleasant and suspicious voice, but there was no harm in trying to disarm it further. It was five minutes to twelve, but just in case …"|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"
00:00|midnight|"‘Not yet, monsieur. He came this evening, and then left for Évian. He said he would be back at midnight to see you. It is after—’"|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"
00:00|midnight|"This had the effect of making Hippolyte turn and look at me. The expression in his face made me wonder, for the first time, what Héloïse had been telling him about me on the way from Geneva. From the look on his face it had been nothing to my credit. As Raoul went on to speak of the midnight feast with Philippe I saw the expression deepen – as if Hippolyte were being given a very different picture of me from the one he had got from Héloïse. ‘And there was something so odd about Héloïse that night,’ said Raoul. ‘She seemed frightened, if that were possible, and then there was Miss Martin’s talk of nightmares … But it was really the second accident that shook me. I went straight to the telephone in the small hours, and eventually got hold of you. It seemed the best thing to do, for us to tackle him together and find out what was going on and force him to … see reason. I thought you might also hand the child over to my care if you had to leave again. I’ve no authority at all where Philippe’s concerned, and for obvious reasons I preferred not to enlist official help at that point. Hence the S.O.S. to you.’ He gave his uncle that fleeting, joyless smile. ‘In any case, as far as the police were concerned, my father still held the winning card, which was that nothing had happened. He had, and has, committed no provable crime. But I thought that if you cabled you were coming home it would put paid to whatever he might be planning. If even then,’ he finished very wearily, ‘he really was planning anything.’"|"Nine Coaches Waiting"|"Mary Stewart"
