"ap 10:11"|10:11|"The handle of the folding shovel she had strapped to her pack was pressing against her back. She stopped, shifted the weight, and adjusted the pack straps. Somewhere in the darkness up the canyon she could hear the odd screeching call of a saw-whet owl, hunting nocturnal rodents. She glanced at her watch: 10:11, changing to 10:12 as she watched. Time enough."|"A Thief of Time"|"Tony Hillerman"

"~ 16:00"|"about 4 P.M."|"The next page was October 16. It was blank. So was the next page. That took him to Wednesday. Across this was written: “Lehman!!! about 4 P.M. dinner. sauerbraten, etc.”"|"A Thief of Time"|"Tony Hillerman"
"ap 05:50"|five-fifty|"“Since you’re there on five-fifty,” the dispatcher said, “see what’s going on at the Seven-Eleven. Just had a disturbance call.”"|"A Thief of Time"|"Tony Hillerman"

"~ 22:00"|"approximately 10 P.M."|"Subject Delbert Tsosie informed Officer Shorty that while serving a customer at the Texaco station at approximately 10 P.M. he noticed a man removing the chain from the gate of the motor pool maintenance yard across Highway 550. He observed a truck towing a flatbed trailer drive through the gate into the yard. Subject Tsosie said that approximately fifteen minutes later he noticed the truck driving out the gate towing a machine which he described as probably a backhoe or some sort of trenching machine loaded on the trailer. He said he did not report this to police because he presumed tribal employees had come to get the equipment to deal with some sort of emergency."|"A Thief of Time"|"Tony Hillerman"
00:00|midnight|"By midnight he finished checking the roads leading from the Star Lake Pump Station, driving slowly, using his flashlight to check for tracks at every possible turnoff. He circled back past the sleeping trading post the maps called White Horse Lake. He crossed the Continental Divide, and dropped into the network of arroyos that drain Chaco Mesa. Again he found nothing. He circled back across Chaco Wash and picked up the gravel road that leads northwestward toward Nageezi Trading Post."|"A Thief of Time"|"Tony Hillerman"
02:04|"2:04 A.M."|"Chee’s watch showed 2:04 A.M. At 2:56 he found the place where, maybe a thousand years ago, a little band of Anasazi families had lived, and built their cluster of small stone shelters and living spaces, and died. Chee had been walking for more than a mile. He had left his pickup by a pump site and followed the twin tracks on foot. The pump marked the dead end of this branch of the service road—if two ruts wandering through the sage and juniper could be called that. From here, the dual tires had made their own road. Away from the hard-packed ruts, they were easy to follow now—crushed tumbleweeds, broken brush, the sharp smell of bruised sage."|"A Thief of Time"|"Tony Hillerman"

">> 00:00"|"long after midnight"|"LEAPHORN CAME HOME to Window Rock long after midnight. He hadn’t bothered to turn on the lights. He drank from his cupped palms in the bathroom and folded his clothing over the bedside chair (where Emma had so often sat to read or knit, to do the thousand small things that Emma did). He had turned the bed ninety degrees so that his eyes would open in the morning to the shock of a different view. That broke his lifelong habit, the automatic waking thought of “Where’s Emma?” and what then followed. He had moved from his side of the bed to Emma’s—which had eliminated that once-happy habit of reaching out to touch her when he drifted into sleep."|"A Thief of Time"|"Tony Hillerman"
"> 18:00"|"after 6:00 P.M."|"That was delayed a bit more by the lack of a telephone in Chee’s trailer. He used the pay phone beside the convenience store on the highway. Janet Pete wasn’t at her office. Maybe, the receptionist said, she had gone down to the Justice building, to the police station. She had been worried about her new car. Chee dialed the station. Three call-back messages for him, two from Janet Pete of DNA, the tribal legal service, one from Lieutenant Leaphorn. Leaphorn had just called and talked to Captain Largo. The captain then had left the message for Chee to call Leaphorn at his home number in Window Rock after 6:00 P.M. Had Pete left any messages? Yes, with the last call she had said to tell him she wanted to pick up her car."|"A Thief of Time"|"Tony Hillerman"
"ap 09:50"|"Nine fifty"|"“Not so terrible,” Tso said. “Nine fifty to eleven hundred dollars and it’s good as it was. But she really ought to fix all those problems it had when you first drove it in.” Tso was wiping the grease from his hands in a gesture that reminded Chee of greedy anticipation. “Grabby brakes, slack steering, all that.”"|"A Thief of Time"|"Tony Hillerman"
"ap 03:00"|three|"“Let’s see now. I’d say it was three, four weeks when she was out here last,” Houk said. “Something like that. Maybe I could figure it out exactly.”"|"A Thief of Time"|"Tony Hillerman"
12:00|noontime|"Thatcher was standing at the foot of the steps, waiting and hearing all this. Embarrassing. But he didn’t bring it up until they were out of Bluff driving toward Mexican Water into the blinding noontime sun."|"A Thief of Time"|"Tony Hillerman"
12:00|noon|"Thatcher drove for a while. Turned on the radio. “Catch the noon news,” he said. “See what they got to say about those pot hunters getting shot.”"|"A Thief of Time"|"Tony Hillerman"
12:00|noon|"Thatcher had no comment on that. The woman reading the noon news had gotten to the pot hunter shooting. The San Juan County Sheriff’s Office said they had no suspects in the case as yet but they did have promising leads. Casts had been made of the tire tracks of a vehicle believed used by the killer. Both victims had now been identified. They were Joe B. Nails, thirty-one, a former employee of Wellserve in Farmington, and Jimmy Etcitty, thirty-seven, whose address was given as Dinnehotso Chapter House on the Navajo Reservation."|"A Thief of Time"|"Tony Hillerman"
12:00|noon|"Leaphorn didn’t comment. He sat silently, considering the destruction below. This ridge was much higher than it had seemed to Chee in the darkness. Shiprock stuck up like a blue thumb on the western horizon seventy miles away. Behind it, the dim outline of the Carrizo Mountains formed the last margin of the planet. The sagebrush flats between were dappled with the shadow of clouds, drifting eastward under the noon sun."|"A Thief of Time"|"Tony Hillerman"
"ap ~ 05:55"|"about five minutes before six"|"“It’s supposed to get here about five minutes before six,” Allen said. “Usually about then.”"|"A Thief of Time"|"Tony Hillerman"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"Ms. Marcy came out in a little less than ten minutes. She handed Leaphorn a card. It bore a name, Richard DuMont, and an address on East Seventy-eighth Street.
“He said he would see you tomorrow morning,” she said. “At eleven.”
Leaphorn stood. “I appreciate this,” he said."|"A Thief of Time"|"Tony Hillerman"
"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"Leaphorn took a cab to the Seventy-eighth Street address, got there a quarter of an hour early, and spent the time prowling the neighborhood—a territory of uniformed doormen and expensive dogs walked by persons who seemed to have been hired for the job. He rang the door chimes at eleven exactly. He waited on the steps, looking at the sky down the street. It would rain again, and soon—probably before noon. An old man, stooped and gray in a wrinkled gray suit, opened the door and stood silently, looking at him patiently."|"A Thief of Time"|"Tony Hillerman"
"ap < 04:30"|"Almost four-thirty"|"“Well, shit!” said Jim Chee, aloud and in English, since Navajo lends itself poorly to such emotional expletives. He glanced at his watch. Almost four-thirty. Where the devil could Nakai have gone? He walked back to the desk where the girl was sitting. She had been watching him curiously."|"A Thief of Time"|"Tony Hillerman"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"He was driving through the Bisti Badlands, headed north toward Farmington, when the five o’clock news began. A woman reporting from the Durango, Colorado, station on the letting of a contract for range improvement on the Ute Mountain Reservation, and a controversy over the environmental impact of an additional ski run at Purgatory, and a recall petition being circulated to unseat a councilman at Aztec, New Mexico. Chee reached up to change the channel. He’d get more New Mexico news from a Farmington station. “In other news of the Four Corners country,” the woman said, “a prominent and sometimes controversial Southeast Utah rancher and political figure has been shot to death at his ranch near Bluff.”"|"A Thief of Time"|"Tony Hillerman"
"< 12:00"|"A little before noon"|"There was nothing to do then but stick close to the telephone and wait for Leaphorn’s call from Bluff. He dug into his paperwork. A little before noon, the phone rang. Leaphorn, Chee thought."|"A Thief of Time"|"Tony Hillerman"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"“Sometimes he would watch the ten o’clock news and then we would go down to Sand Island. We’d make sure nobody was there. Then we’d put it in.” The wind whipped dust around Mrs. Musket’s ankles and blew up her long skirt. She held it down, pressed back against the barn door. “We would put it in, and then the next morning, I would drive the pickup down to that landing place upstream from Mexican Hat and I’d wait for him there. And then…” She paused, swallowed. Stood a moment, silently. Leaphorn noticed her eyes were wet, and looked away. Hard as he was, Harrison Houk had left someone to grieve for him."|"A Thief of Time"|"Tony Hillerman"
"ap > 06:00"|"after six"|"He called Jim Chee from Houk’s house. It was after six. Chee had gone home for the day. No telephone, of course. Typical of Chee. He left Houk’s number for a call back."|"A Thief of Time"|"Tony Hillerman"
12:00|noon|"“If I don’t meet you by noon tomorrow down at Mexican Hat, I hope you will call this man for me. Tell him what you told me about Mr. Houk and this kayak. And that I took it down the river.”"|"A Thief of Time"|"Tony Hillerman"
