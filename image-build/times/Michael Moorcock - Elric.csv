"ap ~ 00:00"|"about twelve"|"Some eighty ships were at the far end of the square, set stem to stern with cannon bristling while the two other sides were leveled at a safe distance across so that their cannon were out of range of each other. We placed a thinner wall of ships, about twelve, at the open end to give the impression of a closed square."|Elric|"Michael Moorcock"
00:00|midnight|"“Greetings—Lady Ermizhad,” said I. She was dressed in a cloak of midnight blue flung around a simple smock of pale blue wool."|Elric|"Michael Moorcock"
00:00|midnight|"“It is always boiling midnight—but the rest, it changes with the moods of the lords. There are no rules at all.”"|Elric|"Michael Moorcock"
12:00|midday|"He arrived at the cliffs by midday and regarded the path leading upwards with a mixture of wariness and relief. He had expected to have to scale the cliffs. He was not one, however, to take a difficult route where an easy one presented itself, so he looped a cord around his sword and slung it over his back, since it was too long and cumbersome to carry at his side. Then, still in bad humour, he began to climb the twisting path."|Elric|"Michael Moorcock"
"ap 00:40"|Twelve-forty|"The five others said nothing. All seemed introspective, hardly aware of his arrival. Then one of them got up and approached Mr. Smiles. His name was Mr. Lucas. He had the decadent good looks of a Roman patrician. He was forty-five and a successful casino owner. Except for Mr. Smiles (who was forty-nine), he was the oldest.
“Twelve-forty, Mr. Smiles. He’s late.”
Mr. Smiles concentrated on drying his hat. “I’ve never known him not to do something he said he’d do, if that’s any comfort,” he said."|Elric|"Michael Moorcock"
"~ 22:00"|"about 10 p.m."|"“Maybe he’ll never guess completely, John, so you might get away with it. He’s fazed, I think. Now it’s up to you. On Sunday you must somehow get Catherine away from the house and into the lodge on the village side of the grounds. There’ll probably be enough confusion and you’ll be able to do it easily. Don’t make a mistake. I want you both at that lodge. And Sunday starts at about 10 p.m., I’d guess.”"|Elric|"Michael Moorcock"
07:00|"seven o’clock that morning"|"In his permanently booked room in The Yachtsman, Jerry Cornelius had woken up at seven o’clock that morning and dressed himself in a lemon shirt with small ebony cuff-links, a wide black cravat, dark green waistcoat and matching hipster pants, black socks and black handmade boots. He had washed his fine hair, and now he brushed it carefully until it shone."|Elric|"Michael Moorcock"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"Only Mr. Lucas hadn’t arrived by two o’clock, and they gave him up, feeling annoyed with him—which wasn’t quite fair, for Mr. Lucas had been stabbed to death in Islington the previous evening and robbed of the best part of his casino’s takings by a much-embittered all-time loser who, by the following Monday, would fall downstairs and kill himself while taking his money to the bank, such being the fate of all-time losers."|Elric|"Michael Moorcock"
"ap 05:00"|five|"“Nearly three hours to kill, if we’re leaving at five,” said Miss Brunner."|Elric|"Michael Moorcock"
12:00|noon|"And at noon they broke out of the forest and saw the ruins of R’lin K’ren A’a."|Elric|"Michael Moorcock"
12:00|noon|"Outside in the middle of the square, at noon, still lay the lonely body of the last Vilmirian crewman. Nobody had known his name. Nobody felt grief for him or tried to compose an epitaph for him. The dead Vilmirian had died for no high purpose, followed no fabulous dream. Even in death his body would fulfill no function. On this island there was no carrion-eater to feed. In the dust of the city there was no earth to fertilize."|Elric|"Michael Moorcock"
04:00|"4 a.m."|"Begg had no useful witnesses. Those who had heard voices from the Prime Minister’s sitting room could not tell if the other speaker was native or foreign. Someone had glimpsed what he described as a “stained-glass window” full of every imaginable colour which seemed to take the shape of a jeweled cup, its gold and silver blazing so powerfully he was almost blinded before it vanished. The piteous, bloodcurdling cry awakened Downing Street at 4 a.m. Someone heard the front door close. Sleeping soldiers and police outside were discovered unhurt. “But I’m seeing two chaps tomorrow morning who sound better. One claims he spotted the murderer leaving BBIC on the night in question, when most of Barbican’s closest associates called a crisis meeting at their HQ and were identically murdered. Noises, like music or singing, and a brilliant glow were reported, but the assassin was invisible. I gather my first witness believes he saw the Devil.”"|Elric|"Michael Moorcock"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"“Very well, Sir Seaton.” She was suddenly brisk. “I respect your family name. Be ready to receive me this evening at six o’clock in Sporting Club Square. But please be prepared also to take responsibility for your actions…”"|Elric|"Michael Moorcock"
"ap 05:57"|"three minutes to six"|"At three minutes to six he was sure he heard a taxi setting down. Since then, save for the occasional muffled stamping of snow-laden feet, the Square had grown silent. Glancing again at his gleaming Tompion, Begg saw that it was four minutes past the hour. At that moment the soft winter air was pierced by the high-pitched shriek of a police whistle. Begg started, as if struck by a new idea, and hurried to don his overcoat. He reached the policeman outside the gates in less than a minute. “What’s up, officer?”"|Elric|"Michael Moorcock"
01:00|"one in the morning"|"At one in the morning, Boxing Day over and snow continuing to fall, Begg, wrapped in a heavy Ulster and fur cap, stood in the darkness of an archway on the third floor of a Sporting Club Square mansion only five blocks from his own. Begg’s stoicism was famous, but tonight he felt his age. At last he heard a soft footfall in the snow outside. A door opened almost silently. Light steps sounded on the carpeted stairway, and at last a tall figure in full evening dress appeared on the landing, stepping forward with a latchkey held out in its bone-white hand."|Elric|"Michael Moorcock"
"ap 04:30"|Four-thirty|"“WHAT’S THE TIME,” he says. “Pad—what’s the time? My watch has stopped.”
“Four-thirty,” says Patrick. “Shouldn’t he have turned up by now?”
“He’s always on time. He’ll be here. God knows I’ll be glad to get the release.” He reaches for his cup. “It’s bothering me, Pad. I can’t get rid of it.”"|Elric|"Michael Moorcock"
