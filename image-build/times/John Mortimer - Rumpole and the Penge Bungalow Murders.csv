By the time they got to the Palladium they were not entirely sober and ‘Tail-End’ insisted on joining Judy Garland in her songs. After the theatre they had a few more drinks at a bar near Victoria Station and they all arrived at Jerry’s bungalow just before midnight."|"Rumpole and the Penge Bungalow Murders"|"John Mortimer"
"ap 09:30"|nine-thirty|"After this the party continued for some time before the revellers went to their homes. It wasn’t until next morning that Simon rang the police to tell them that he had woken up to find his father dead in a chair. Joan Plumpton, a cleaning lady who worked at both bungalows, opened ‘Tail-End’ Charlie’s door at nine-thirty to find him lying in the small hallway also shot through the heart. A German bullet was found in the bodies of the two wartime companions and the Luger pistol, having been recently fired, was found in a dustbin outside Jerry’s bungalow. That, in brief, was the story of the Penge Bungalow Murders."|"Rumpole and the Penge Bungalow Murders"|"John Mortimer"

He smiled a lot, seemed grateful for my visit and was clearly amused by the time the burglary had allegedly taken place."|"Rumpole and the Penge Bungalow Murders"|"John Mortimer"

"~ 00:00"|"around midnight"|"Singing wartime songs, calling up wartime memories, running the bar and eating bacon and eggs around midnight left little time and I went to bed with my intended questions unanswered. I lay awake for a while, listening to the murmur of the sea and trying not to think of Bobby in bed with her three-fingered husband."|"Rumpole and the Penge Bungalow Murders"|"John Mortimer"

‘Certainly by midnight.’"|"Rumpole and the Penge Bungalow Murders"|"John Mortimer"

"ap 10:15"|"Quarter past ten"|"I, to my eternal shame, said nothing, but vowed to give my client as much of my help as possible. C. H. Wystan looked at his watch and said, ‘Quarter past ten! We’d better be getting into court.’ And so we all trooped out of the cells, up into the safer surroundings of Court Number One, where my learned leader would no longer have to speak to his client."|"Rumpole and the Penge Bungalow Murders"|"John Mortimer"

Dodo Mackintosh transferred her talent for preparing cheesy bits to scrambled eggs and I opened bottles from my private store of Château Thames Embankment. Once again the conversation turned to the question of who had been guilty of starting the rumours about Miss Bigsby, the mistress in charge of science and biology, and the school janitor, known as ‘Dunc the hunk’."|"Rumpole and the Penge Bungalow Murders"|"John Mortimer"
