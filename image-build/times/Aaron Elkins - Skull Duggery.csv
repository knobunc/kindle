The man had been spotted an hour earlier, at about five P.M., slogging up the steep, cobbled street toward the resort, and his looks had set off alarm bells: a jail bird’s face, heavy-jawed and sleepy-eyed, with a drooping Emiliano Zapata mustache and a dirty, graying ponytail hanging down in back from under a tattered campesino’s hat, and with leathery, pockmarked skin as creased and pouched as an old valise that’s sat out on top of the bus too many times. Blue-green tattoos—lizards? snakes?—twisted up the sides of his neck from the grimy collar of his denim jacket. Pompeo, the senior of Sandoval’s two policemen, had stopped him to talk to him. When he found that the man had no identification, had a total of six pesos on him, and had a story that didn’t add up, he’d brought him in to see the jefe."|"Skull Duggery"|"Aaron Elkins"

He had grown a little sleepy again—it was just after eight o’clock in the morning; they had taken a red-eye from Mexico City rather than staying the night at an airport hotel—so he was content to sit quietly and watch the scrub-dotted countryside slide by, so starkly different from the green, cool ambience of the Olympic Peninsula. And Carl was the sort of man who was just as happy, or probably more so, to be sitting in companionable silence as he would be to making conversation."|"Skull Duggery"|"Aaron Elkins"

Annie took a proprietary pride in Dorotea’s skills, explaining that what made the tortillas so exceptional was not only that they had been made that morning with fresh masa—hand-ground corn flour—but that real, old-fashioned lard had gone into it “by the handful.” This did nothing to take the edge off their appetites, and all of the quesadillas were efficiently demolished, three by Gideon."|"Skull Duggery"|"Aaron Elkins"

From Sandoval’s point of view, the day had gotten off to a disastrous start. He had allowed what he thought was more than ample time for the drive from Teotitlán, but he’d taken a wrong turn somewhere and had had a terrible time finding the place. Thus, instead of being fifteen minutes early for his two o’clock appointment, they were ten minutes late. They would have been only five minutes late had matters not been made worse when, having no convincing credentials to produce, he had been denied entrance to the official-business parking lot and had had to park on a side street two blocks away. As a result, Chief Sandoval, who had been a nervous wreck to begin with, was practically a moving puddle by the time they got there."|"Skull Duggery"|"Aaron Elkins"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"The last time he’d seen him had been in Mérida, on the Yucatán Peninsula, where he had been an inspector in the Yucatecan State Judicial Police. Gideon had met a lot of interesting and unusual policemen in his life, but Javier Alfonso Marmolejo took the cake, a real one of a kind. Half Mayan Indian, born in his Mayan mother’s village of Tzakol, a huddle of dilapidated shacks near the Quintana Roo border (Gideon had been there once; what he chiefly remembered were the pigs sunning themselves in the middle of the single, muddy street), Marmolejo had not learned Spanish until he was seven, when his father moved the family to Mérida. At ten, he was one of the army of rascally, going-nowhere kids selling takeaway snacks of sliced coconuts and grapefruit and orange slices from homemade carts around the main market square. Against all odds, he had gotten himself through school and saved enough to buy his way into the then graft-riddled Yucatecan police department. A drastic cleanup a few years later had resulted in throwing out half the police force, but Marmolejo’s integrity and abilities had been recognized and he’d been kept on. A few years later he’d graduated from the national police academy in Mexico City—one of the few provincial cops to do so, and probably the first Mayan Indian—and, in his forties, had gone on to a master’s degree in public administration from the Universidad Autónoma de Yucatán.

Having borrowed one of the Hacienda’s vans, he had arrived at the Procuraduría a little before two, where he was received at the foot of the basement steps with full military honors—salute, clicked heels—by Donardo, the hulking cop who had been notably short on courtesies the day before.

But it was still early, barely nine o’clock, so it was likely that other people would be showing up as the day wore on. He decided to hit the tombs first, before that happened.

At ten, the start of the countdown, he was sauntering along, but by five he had broken into a run, and by two he was running like hell, arms and legs churning. The live pedestrians, they noted, did not follow suit. They started at a saunter and they finished at a saunter, whatever the count.

On second glance, however, the junk proved to be exhibits, each with a small, faded, foxed, meticulously hand-lettered placard in English and Spanish. To the left of the big oak door of the casa itself was a weathered concrete bust of Kaiser Wilhelm I, complete with spiked helmet: “From the residence of Friedrich Pflegholz, German ambassador to Mexico, 1883-1886.” To the right was the “sacred throne of Axayácatl, emperor of the Aztecs,” an ugly hunk of basalt that an imaginative mind might have construed as being shaped more or less like a chair.
