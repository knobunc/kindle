        sponsored by Assemblyman Don Mulford, a Republican from Oakland, who looks and talks quite 
        a bit like the “old” Richard Nixon. Mr. Mulford is much concerned about “subversive 
        infiltration” on the Berkeley campus, which lies in his district. He thinks he knows that 
        the outburst last fall was caused by New York Communists, beatnik perverts and other 
        godless elements beyond his ken. The students themselves, he tells himself, would never 
        have caused such a ruckus. Others in Sacramento apparently shared this view: the bill 
        passed the Assembly by a vote of 54 to 11 and the Senate by 27 to 8. Governor Brown signed 
        it on June 2. The Mulford proposal got a good boost, while it was still pending, when J.

"~ 00:00"|"around 
        midnight"|"My problem was clear from the start. I had come down to Cozumel -- officially, at least 
        -- to cover not just a fishing tournament but a 
      
      
        scene: 
      
      
        I'd explained to the editor that big-time sport fishing attracts a certain kind of people 
        and it was the behavior of these people -- not the fishing -- that interested me. On my 
        first visit to Cozumel, I'd discovered the fishing harbor completely by accident one night 
        when Sandy and I were driving around the island more or less naked, finely twisted on MDA, 
        and the only reason we located the yacht basin was that I took a wrong turn around 
        midnight and tried -- without realizing where I was going -- to run a roadblock manned by 
        three Mexican soldiers with submachine guns at the entrance to the island's only airport."|"The Great Shark Hunt"|"Hunter S. Thompson"
00:00|midnight|"In any case, we were bent -- and after being driven away from the airport by armed 
        guards, I took the next available open road and we would up in the yacht basin, where 
        there was a party going on. I could hear it about a half mile off, so I homed in on the 
        music and drove across the highway and about 200 yards down a steep grassy embankment to 
        get to the dock. Sandy refused to get out of the jeep, saying that these weren't the kind 
        of people she felt ready to mix with, under the circumstances. . . so I left her huddled 
        under a blanket on the front seat and walked out onto the dock by myself. It was exactly 
        the kind of scene I'd been looking for -- about 35 stone-drunk rich honkies from places 
        like Jacksonville and Pompano Beach, reeling around in this midnight Mexican port on their 
        $200,000 power cruisers and cursing the natives for not providing enough teenage whores to 
        go with the mariachi music. It was a scene of total decadence and I felt right at home in 
        it. I began mixing with the crowd and trying to hire a boat for the next morning -- which 
        proved to be very difficult, because nobody could understand what I was saying."|"The Great Shark Hunt"|"Hunter S. Thompson"
00:00|midnight|"He disappeared inside and I leaned back on the seat to stare straight up at the 
        star-crazed sky. It seemed about six feet above my eyes. Or maybe 60 feet, or 600. I 
        couldn't be sure, and it didn't matter, anyway, because by that time I was convinced I was 
        in the cockpit of a 727 coming into L.A. at midnight. Jesus, I thought, I am ripped right 
        straight to the tits. Where am I? Are we going up or down? Somewhere in the back of my 
        brain, I knew I was sitting in a jeep in the parking lot of a night club on an island off 
        the Mexican coast -- but how could I really be sure, with another part of my brain 
        apparently convinced that I was looking down on the huge glittering bowl of Los Angeles 
        from the cockpit of a 727? Was that the Milky Way? Or Sunset Boulevard? Orion, or the 
        Beverly Hills Hotel?"|"The Great Shark Hunt"|"Hunter S. Thompson"

        than three minutes before boarding time. I knew that the local Avis people would have me 
        under observation by the same shadowy observer who'd nailed me on the broken-windshield 
        charge, but I also knew he'd been watching us long enough to know we were both late 
        risers. He would set his psychic work clock, I felt, to coincide with our traditional 
        noon-to-dawn working hours. I also knew that the hours he'd been keeping for the past week 
        were so far off his normal wake-sleep schedule that by now he was probably a nervous, 
        jabbering mess from trying to keep up with a gang of wild gringos fueled from an

        causing innocent passengers to shrink off with feelings of shock and repugnance is a

        retrograde campaign has already plunged me into a condition bordering on terminal despair,

        change my name and seek work as a professional alligator poacher in the swamps around Lake

        of genuine excess. The food factor should always be massive: four Bloody Marys, two 
        grapefruits, a pot of coffee, Rangoon crepes, a half-pound of either sausage, bacon or 
        corned beef hash with diced chilies, a Spanish omelette or eggs Benedict a quart of milk,

        phase with Kennedy's political obligations for that day. He was scheduled to address a 
        crowd of establishment heavies who would convene at the University of Georgia Law School 
        at 10:30 in the morning to officially witness the unveiling of a huge and prestigious oil 
        portrait of former secretary of state Dean Rusk, and his tentative schedule for Saturday

        mother used to make dresses, sheets and curtains. We had two acres of land which we 
        planted every year with corn, tomatoes and yellow chiles for the hot sauce. Even before my

        aides in the Oval Office to plot illegal wiretaps, political burglaries and other gross 
        felonies in the name of a “silent majority,” it was hard to feel anything more than a

        they were probably fixed from the start. And any Judge who can safely slide into full

        outside during the service. They stood in quiet groups, leaning against the bikes and 
        killing time with lazy conversation. There was hardly any talk about Miles. In one group a 
        pint of whiskey made the rounds. Some of the outlaws talked to bystanders, trying to 
        explain what was happening. “Yeah, the guy was one of our leaders,” said an Angel to an

        recall, when the urge to speak came on me. Earlier that day I had found -- on the tile

00:00|midnight|"I felt the same way. All I wanted to do was get the hell out of town as soon as possible. 
        I had just come from the White House pressroom, where a smoglike sense of funk -- or 
        “smunk” as somebody over there might describe it -- had settled on the room within minutes 
        after Ford took the oath. The Deathwatch was finally over; the evil demon had been purged 
        and the Good Guys had won -- or at least the Bad Guys had lost, but that was not quite the 
        same thing. Within hours after Richard Nixon left Washington, it was painfully clear that 
        Frank Mankiewicz had spoken too soon when he'd predicted, just a few weeks before The 
        Fall, that Washington would be “the Hollywood of the Seventies.” Without Nixon to stir up 
        its thin juices, the Washington of the Seventies could look forward to the same grim fate 
        as Cinderella's gilded coach at the stroke of midnight. It would turn back into a pumpkin, 
        and any mysterious shoes left lying around on the deserted ballroom floors of the 
        Watergate era would not interest a genial pragmatist like Gerald Ford. He would not have 
        much time, for a while, to concern himself with anything but the slide into national 
        bankruptcy that Nixon had left him to cope with. . . And, despite all its menacing 
        implications, the desperate plight of the national economy was not a story that called up 
        the same kind of journalistic adrenaline that Washington and most of the country had been 
        living on for so long that the prospect of giving it up caused a serious panic in the 
        ranks of all the Watergate junkies who never even knew they were hooked until the cold 
        turkey swooped into their closets."|"The Great Shark Hunt"|"Hunter S. Thompson"
"~ 18:00"|"About six in the evening"|"It was hard to know, from our window across the street, if we were watching the FBI, 
        local detectives or insurance agency investigators at work. . . But in any case I figured 
        they'd have the whole station ringed with armed guards for the next few nights, so we 
        decided to leave well enough alone. About six in the evening, however, we stopped there 
        and had the tank filled up with ethyl. There were about six bony-faced men hanging around 
        the office, killing the time until dark by studying road maps and tire-pressure charts. 
        They paid no attention to us until I tried to put a dime in the Coke machine."|"The Great Shark Hunt"|"Hunter S. Thompson"

        a moment, then looks away. Mitchell scans the story on Martha: She has freaked out again. 
        Where does she keep getting that goddamn speed? he wonders; her eyes in the photo are the 
        size of marbles. According to the story, she called UPI reporter Helen Thomas at four in 
        the morning, cursing incoherently about “Mister President” and saying she has to get out 
        of Washington at once, go back to the apartment in New York for a few days of rest."|"The Great Shark Hunt"|"Hunter S. Thompson"

        goes in first to check all the rooms. Mitchell glances down the hall and sees another 
        Secret Service man by the door to the fire exit. He smiles hello and the agent nods his 
        head. Jesus Christ! What the hell am I worried about? We'll have this thing wrapped up and
