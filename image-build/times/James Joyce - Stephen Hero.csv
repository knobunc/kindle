                minutes past eleven"|"The president of the college was a sequestrated person who took the
                chair at reunions and inaugural meetings of societies. His visible lieutenants were
                a dean and a bursar. The bursar, Stephen thought, fitted his title: a heavy, florid
                man with a « black-grey cap of hair. » He performed his duties with
                great unction and was often to be seen looming in the hall
                watching the coming and going of the students. He insisted on punctuality: a minute
                or so late once or twice — he would not mind that so much; he would clap his
                hands and make some cheery reproof. But what made him severe was a few minutes lost
                every day: it disturbed the proper working of the classes. Stephen was nearly always
                more than a quarter of an hour late and [so] when he arrived the bursar had usually
                gone back to his office. One morning, however, he arrived at the school earlier than
                usual. Walking up the stone steps before him was a fat [young] student, a very
                hard-working, timorous young man with a bread-and-jam complexion. The bursar was
                standing in the hall with his arms folded across [the] his chest and when he caught
                sight of the fat young man he looked significantly at the clock. It was eight
                minutes past eleven."|"Stephen Hero"|"James Joyce"
"ap 00:00"|"twelve o’clock"|"One morning [he] Stephen arrived three quarters of an hour late and he
                thought it his decenter plan to wait till the French lecture should begin. As he was
                leaning over the banisters, waiting for the twelve o’clock bell to ring a
                young man began to ascend the winding-stairs slowly. At a few
                steps from the landing he halted and turned a square rustic face towards
                Stephen."|"Stephen Hero"|"James Joyce"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"Maurice accepted this prohibition with a bad grace and had to be
                restrained by his brother from overt disobedience. Stephen himself bore it lightly
                because he could ease himself greatly in solitude and for human channels, at the
                worst, he could resort to a few of his college-companions. He was now busily
                preparing his paper for the Literary and Historical Society and he took every
                precaution to ensure in it a maximum of explosive force. It seemed to him that the
                students might need only the word to enkindle them towards liberty or that, at
                least, his trumpet-call might bring to his side a certain minority of the elect.
                McCann was the Auditor of the Society and as he was anxious to know the trend of
                Stephen’s paper the two used often to leave the Library at ten o’clock
                and walk towards the Auditor’s lodgings, discussing. McCann enjoyed the
                reputation of a fearless, free-spoken young man but Stephen found it difficult to
                bring him to any fixed terms on matters which were held to be dangerous ground.
                McCann would talk freely on feminism and on rational life: he believed that the
                sexes should be educated together in order to accustom them early to each
                other’s influences and he believed that women should be afforded the same
                opportunities as were afforded to the so-called superior sex and he believed that
                women had the right to compete with men in every branch of social and intellectual
                activity. He also held the opinion that a man should live without using any kind of
                stimulant, that he had a moral obligation to transmit to posterity sound minds in
                sound bodies, and that he should not allow himself to be dictated to on the subject
                of dress by any conventions. Stephen delighted to riddle these theories with agile
                bullets."|"Stephen Hero"|"James Joyce"
"ap 03:30"|"half past three"|"So after all his trouble, thinking out his essay and composing his
                periods, this old fogey was about to prohibit it! His indignation settled into a
                mood of politic contempt as he crossed the Green. The clock in the hall of the
                College pointed to half past three as Stephen addressed the « doddering
                » door-porter. He had to speak twice, the second time with a distinct,
                separated enunciation, for the door-porter was rather stupid and deaf:"|"Stephen Hero"|"James Joyce"
"ap 02:30"|"half past two"|"On Good Friday as Stephen was wandering aimlessly about the city he
                caught sight of a placard on a wall which announced that the Three Hours’
                Agony would be preached by the Very Reverend W. Dillon S.J. and the Very Reverend J.
                Campbell S.J. in the Jesuit Church, Gardiner St. Stephen felt very solitary and
                purposeless as he traversed empty street after empty street and, without being
                keenly aware of it, he began to proceed in the direction of Gardiner St. It was a
                warm sunless day and the city wore an air of sacred torpor. As he passed under S.
                George’s Church he saw that it was already half past two; — he had
                been three hours wandering up and down the city. He entered the Church in Gardiner
                St and, passing by without honouring the table of the lay-brother who roused himself
                from a stupefied doze in expectation of silver, arrived in the right wing of the
                chapel. The chapel was crowded from altar to doors with a well-dressed multitude.
                Everywhere he saw the same flattered affection for the Jesuits who are in the habit
                of attaching to their order the souls of thousands of the insecurely respectable
                middle-class by offering them a refined asylum, an interested, a
                considerate confessional, a particular amiableness of manners which their spiritual
                adventures in no way entitled them to. Not very far from him in the shelter of one
                of the pillars Stephen saw his father and two friends. His father had directed his
                eyeglass upon the distant choir and his face wore an expression of impressed piety.
                The choir was executing some florid tracery which was intended as an expression of
                mourning. The walk, the heat, the crush, the darkness of the chapel overcame Stephen
                and, leaning against the lintel of the door, he half closed his eyes and allowed his
                thoughts to drift. Rhymes began to make themselves in his head."|"Stephen Hero"|"James Joyce"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"Between Easter and the end of May Stephen’s
                acquaintance with Cranly progressed night by night. As the time of the Summer
                Examinations was approaching Maurice and Stephen were both supposed to be hard at
                work. Maurice retired to his room carefully every evening after tea-time and Stephen
                repaired to the Library where he was supposed to be engaged in serious work. As a
                matter of fact he read little or nothing in the Library. He talked with Cranly by
                the hour either at a table, or, if removed by the librarian or by the indignant
                glances of students, standing at the top of the staircase. At ten o’clock

                o’clock"|"The summer was dull and warm. « Nearly every day Stephen
                wandered through the slums watching the sordid lives of the inhabitants. He read all
                the street-ballads which were stuck in the dusty windows of the Liberties. He read
                the racing names and prices scrawled in blue pencil outside the dingy tobacco-shops,
                the windows of which were adorned with scarlet police journals. He examined all the
                book-stalls which offered old directories and volumes of sermons and unheard-of
                treatises [for] at the rate of a penny each or three for twopence. He often posted
                himself opposite one of the factories in old Dublin at two
                o’clock to watch the hands coming out to dinner — » principally
                young boys and girls with colourless, expressionless faces, who seized the
                opportunity to be gallant in their way. He drifted in and out of interminable
                chapels in which an old man dozed on a bench or a clerk dusted the woodwork or an
                old woman prayed before the candle she had lighted. As he walked slowly through the
                maze of poor streets he stared proudly in return for the glances of stupid wonder
                that he received and watched from under his eyes the great cow-like trunks of police
                constables swing slowly round after him as he passed them. These wanderings filled
                him with deep-seated anger and whenever he encountered a burly black-vested priest
                taking a stroll of pleasant inspection through these warrens full of swarming and
                cringing believers he cursed the farce of Irish Catholicism: an island [whereof] the
                inhabitants of which entrust their wills and minds to others that they may ensure
                for themselves a life of spiritual paralysis, an island in which all the power and
                riches are in the keeping of those whose kingdom is not of this world, an island in
                which Caesar [professes] confesses Christ and Christ confesses Caesar that together
                they may wax fat upon a starveling rabblement which is bidden ironically to take to
                itself this consolation in hardship “The Kingdom of God is within
                you.”"|"Stephen Hero"|"James Joyce"
12:00|noon|"Mr Daedalus had not an acute sense of the rights of private property:
                he paid rent very rarely. To demand money for eatables seemed to him just but to
                expect people to pay for shelter the exorbitant sums which are demanded annually by
                houseowners in Dublin seemed to him unjust. He had now been a year in his house in
                Clontarf and for that year he had paid a quarter’s rent. The writ which had
                been first served on him had « contained a legal flaw » and this fact
                enabled him to prolong his term of occupancy. Just now matters were drawing to a
                head and he was scouring the city for another house. A private message from a friend
                in the Sheriff’s office gave him exactly five days of grace and every morning
                he brushed his silk hat very diligently and polished his eyeglass and went forth
                humming derisively to offer himself as a bait to landlords. The halldoor was often
                banged loudly on these occasions as the only possible close of an altercation. The
                results of the examination had awarded Stephen a mere pass and his father told him
                very confidentially that he had better look out for some kind of a doss because in a
                week’s time they would all be out on the street. The
                funds in the house were very low for the new furniture had fetched very little after
                its transport piecemeal to a pawn-office. Tradesmen who had seen it depart had begun
                a game of knocking and ringing which was very often followed by the curious eyes of
                street-urchins. Isabel was lyings upstairs in the backroom, day by day growing more
                wasted and querulous. The doctor came twice a week now and ordered her delicacies.
                Mrs Daedalus had to set her wits to work to provide even one substantial meal every
                day and she certainly had no time to spare between accomplishing this feat,
                appeasing the clamour at the halldoor, parrying her husband’s ill-humour and
                attending on her dying daughter. As for her sons, one was a freethinker, the other
                surly. « Maurice ate dry bread, muttered maledictions against his father and
                his father’s creditors, practised pushing a heavy flat stone in the garden
                » and raising and lowering a broken dumb-bell, and trudged to the Bull every
                day that the tide served. In the evening he wrote his diary or went out for a walk
                by himself. Stephen wandered about morning, noon and night. The two brothers were
                not often together [until after]. One dusky summer evening [when] they walked into
                each other very gravely at a corner and both burst out laughing: and after that they
                sometimes went for walks together in the evening and discussed the art of
                literature."|"Stephen Hero"|"James Joyce"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"One evening as Stephen was coming down the Library staircase after
                idling away a half-hour at [a dictionary of music] a medical treatise on singing, he
                heard a dress brushing the steps behind him. The dress belonged to Emma Clery who,
                of course, was very much surprised at seeing Stephen. She had just been working at
                some old Irish and now she was going home: her father didn’t like her to stay
                in the Library until ten o’clock as she had no escort. The night was so fine
                that she thought she would not take the tram. Stephen asked her might he not see her
                home. They stood under the porch for a few minutes, talking. Stephen took out a
                cigarette and lit it but at once knocked off the lighted end [very] meditatively and
                put the cigarette back into his case: her eyes were very bright."|"Stephen Hero"|"James Joyce"
"> 00:00"|"a little after midnight"|"Stephen was present in the room when his sister died. As soon as her
                mother had been alarmed the priest was sent for. He was a diminutive man who carried
                his head mostly on his right shoulder and spoke in a lisping voice which was not
                very easily heard. He heard the girl’s confession and went away saying
                “Leave it to God: He knows best: leave it to God.” The doctor came
                with Mr Daedalus on a car, examined the girl and asked had she seen a priest. He
                went away saying that while there was life there was hope but that she was very low:
                he would call in the morning. Isabel died a little after midnight. Her father who
                was not quite sober walked about the room on tiptoe, cried in little fits every time
                his daughter showed a change and kept on saying “That’s right, duckey:
                take that now” whenever her mother forced her to swallow a little champagne
                and then nodded his head until he began to cry afresh. He kept telling everyone to
                keep her spirits up. Maurice sat down by the empty fireplace and gazed in the grate.
                Stephen sat at the head of the bed and held his sister’s
                hand, her mother bending over her offering her the glass and kissing her and
                praying. Isabel seemed to Stephen to have grown very old: her face had become a
                woman’s face. Her eyes turned constantly between the two figures nearest to
                her as if to say she had been wronged in being given life and, at Stephen’s
                word, she gulped down whatever was offered her. When she could swallow no more her
                mother said to her “You are going home, dear, now. You are going to heaven
                where we will all meet again. Don’t you know? … Yes, dear …
                Heaven, with God” and the child fixed her great eyes on her mother’s
                face while her bosom began to heave loudly beneath the bedclothes."|"Stephen Hero"|"James Joyce"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"The second year of Stephen’s University life opened early in
                October. His godfather had made no comment on the result of the first year but
                Stephen was told that this opportunity would be the last given him. He chose Italian
                as his optional subject, partly from a desire to read Dante seriously, and partly to
                escape the crush of French and German lectures. No-one else in the college studied
                Italian and every second morning he came to the college at ten o’clock and
                went up to Father Artifoni’s bedroom. Father Artifoni was an intelligent
                little moro, who came from Bergamo, a town in Lombardy. He had clean lively
                eyes and a thick full mouth. Every morning when Stephen rapped at his door [he]
                there was the noise of chairs being disarranged before the “Avanti!”
                The little priest never read in the sitting posture and the noise which Stephen
                heard was the noise of an improvised lectern returning to its constituent parts,
                namely, two cane chairs and a stiff blotting-pad. The Italian lessons often extended
                beyond the hour and much less grammar and literature was discussed than philosophy.
                The teacher probably knew the doubtful reputation of his pupil
                but for this very reason he adopted a language of ingenuous piety, not that he was
                himself Jesuit enough to lack ingenuousness but that he was Italian enough to enjoy
                a game of belief and unbelief. He reproved his pupil once for an admiring allusion
                to the author of The Triumphant Beast."|"Stephen Hero"|"James Joyce"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"He followed his Italian lesson mechanically, feeling the
                unintermittent deadliness of the atmosphere of the college in his throat and lungs,
                obscuring his eyes and obfuscating his brain. The little iron watch on the table had
                barely passed the half hour: eleven o’clock seemed so far off. He had to open
                his Machiavelli and read out a paragraph until the teacher’s ear was
                satisfied. The dingy chronicle fell piecemeal from his lips, dull wooden words. From
                time to time he glanced up from the page to see the thick mouth of the priest
                correct his slovenly ‘o’s now with a sudden harsh ejaculation of the
                vowel sound, now with a slow mute protrusion of the lips. The
                little iron watch ticked on for another five minutes. Then the teacher began to
                correct the exercise. « Stephen gazed wearily out of the window, across the
                mist-laden gardens. The air was webbed with water vapours and all the flower-beds
                and walks confronted the grey of the sky with a truculent sodden brown. Mackintoshes
                and overcoats came along the walks or down the steps of the monument under their
                umbrellas or surmounted by a muffled human head. » The footpath inside the
                chains where Stephen had so often walked with his friends at night glistened like a
                grey mirror. Stephen watched the feet pass along the polished surface: he wondered
                if it was his moments of excessive vitality which cast back by revulsion on such
                hours of despair. He felt that he was looking at the world with Cranly’s eyes
                and still he continued gazing along the footpath."|"Stephen Hero"|"James Joyce"
"ap > 10:00"|"After ten o’clock"|"These pleadings which Stephen so punctiliously heard out were supplemented by Cranly’s influence. Neither of the
                young men [were] was studying for [their] his examination and they spent their
                evenings as usual in aimless walking and talking. Their walks and talks led nowhere
                because whenever anything definite threatened to make its appearance in their talk
                Cranly promptly sought the company of some of his chosen companions. The
                billiard-room of the Adelphi Hotel was now a favourite resort of the two friends.
                After ten o’clock every night they went into the billiard-room. It was a big
                room well furnished with ill-kept inelegant tables and poorly furnished with
                players. Cranly played protracted matches with one or other of his companions while
                Stephen sat on the seat that ran alongside of the table. A game of fifty cost
                sixpence which was duly paid by each of the players in equal parts, Cranly producing
                « his threepence very deliberately from a leather heart-shaped purse. The
                players sometimes sent their balls on to the floor and » Cranly occasionally
                swore at his flamin’ cue. There was a bar attached to the billiard-room. In
                the bar was a stout barmaid who wore badly made stays, served bottles of stout with
                her head on one side, and conversed in an English accent with her customers about
                the theatrical companies of the different theatres. Her customers were young men who
                carried their hats sideways far back on their heads and walked with their feet far
                apart. Their trousers were usually turned up high above their tan boots. One of the
                regular customers at this bar (though he did not mix with the young gentlemen
                mentioned above) was a friend of Cranly’s, a young man who was a clerk in the
                Agricultural Board Office. He was a bandy-legged little man who spoke very little
                when he was sober but very much when he was drunk. When he was sober he was very
                orderly but his tipsiness, signalled by a dark-coloured ooze upon his pock-marked
                face, was boastful and disorderly. One night he engaged in a fierce argument about
                Tim Healy with a thick set medical student who had a taste for the art of
                self-defence. The argument was nearly entirely one-sided inasmuch as the medical
                student’s contributions were derisive laughs and such remarks as “Is
                he handy with the mits?” “Can he put up his
                props?” “Is he a good man with the mits?” At last the clerk
                from the Agricultural Board Office called the medical student a dirty name whereupon
                the medical student immediately knocked down all the drinks on the counter in his
                efforts to ‘smash’ the offender. The barmaid ran screaming for the
                proprietor, the medical student was soothed and restrained by considerate friends
                and the offender was escorted out by Cranly and Stephen and a few others. At first
                he lamented that his new cuffs were stained with porter and expressed a great desire
                to go back and fight it out but, dissuaded by Cranly, he began to tell Stephen in an
                indistinct undertone that he had got the highest marks in Pure Mathematics ever
                given in the degree examination.* He advised Stephen to go to London to write for the papers and
                said he could put him in the right way to get on. When Cranly had begun a
                conversation with the others concerning the interrupted game of billiards
                Stephen’s companion again announced that he had got the highest marks ever
                given in the degree in Pure Mathematics."|"Stephen Hero"|"James Joyce"
"ap 09:30"|"Half past nine"|"— My address? … O … You see … it’s
                really impossible, d’ye know, to say what my address would be. But you
                won’t come to any decision before I come back … I’m almost sure
                I’ll go in the morning but I want to see at what time there’s a
                train.
— We looked before, said Stephen. Half past nine.
— No … I think I must go up to Harcourt St to see what
                time there’s a train."|"Stephen Hero"|"James Joyce"
"ap 09:30"|"Half past nine"|"— Half past nine, as I told you. You see you wouldn’t

"ap 06:30"|"half past six"|"Dinner was served at half past six in a long plainly-furnished room.
                The table spread under a tall lamp of elegant silver-work wore an air of chaste
                elegance. It was a slight trial on Stephen’s hunger to accept these cold
                manners and in the warmth of his relish for food he condemned this strange attitude
                of human beings as ungrateful and unnatural. The conversation was also a little
                mincing and Stephen heard the words ‘charming’ and
                ‘nice’ and ‘pretty’ too often to find them agreeable. He
                discovered the weak point in Mr Fulham’s armour very soon; Mr Fulham, like
                most of his countrymen, was a persuaded politician. Most of Mr Fulham’s
                neighbours were primitive types and he, in spite of the narrowness of his ideas, was
                regarded by them as a man of ripe culture. In a discussion which took place over a
                game of bézique Stephen heard his godfather explain to a more rustic
                proprietor the nature of the work done by the missionary fathers in civilising the
                Chinese people. He sustained the propositions that the Church is also the chief
                repository of secular culture and that the tradition of learning must derive from
                the monks. He saw in the pride of the Church the only refuge of men against a
                threatening democracy and said that Aquinas had anticipated all the discoveries of
                the modern world. His neighbour was puzzled to discover the whereabouts of the souls
                of the Chinese people in the other life but Mr Fulham left the problem at the door
                of God’s mercy. At this stage of the discussion Miss Howard, hitherto silent,
                said that there were three kinds of baptism and her statement was accepted as a
                closure."|"Stephen Hero"|"James Joyce"
"ap ~ 02:00"|"About two o’clock"|"— Very good. Until then!
— So long! About two o’clock.
As they drove home together Stephen asked Dan some questions which Dan
                pretended not to hear and when Stephen pressed him for answers he gave the shortest
                possible answers. It was plain that he did not care to discuss his spiritual
                superior and Stephen had to desist."|"Stephen Hero"|"James Joyce"
