03:00|"3 A.M."|"Marjorie’s mother looked in on her sleeping daughter at half past ten of a Sunday
         morning with feelings of puzzlement and dread. She disapproved of everything she saw.
         She disapproved of the expensive black silk evening dress crumpled on a chair, the
         pink frothy underwear thrown on top of the dress, the stockings like dead snakes on
         the floor, the brown wilting gardenias on the desk. Above all she disapproved of the
         beautiful seventeen-year-old girl lying happily asleep on a costly oversize bed in
         a square of golden sunlight, her hair a disordered brown mass of curls, her red mouth
         streaked with cracking purplish paint, her breathing peaceful and regular through
         her fine little nose. Marjorie was recovering from a college dance. She looked sweetly
         innocent asleep; but her mother feared that this picture was deceptive, remembering
         drunken male laughter in the foyer at 3 A.M., and subdued girlish giggles, and tiptoeing
         noises past her bedroom. Marjorie’s mother did not get much sleep when her daughter
         went to a college dance. But she had no thought of trying to stop her; it was the
         way boys met girls nowadays. College dances had formed no part of the courtship manners
         of her own girlhood, but she tried to move with the times. She sighed, took the dying
         flowers to try to preserve them in the refrigerator, and went out, softly closing
         the door."|"Marjorie Morningstar"|"Herman Wouk"

         went on all the time between the parents. They could take either side with ease. It
         all depended on which one started to criticize the daughter. The father stared at
         his paper and the mother stared out of the window."|"Marjorie Morningstar"|"Herman Wouk"

"ap 00:00"|twelve|"It seemed to Marjorie that she had never heard so much Hebrew in her life. The house
         rang with the ancient tongue. Seth was studying for his part in the ceremony as he
         did everything else nowadays—efficiently, thoroughly, and with ease. He had to learn
         a number of prayers, and a long reading from a prophetic book in a bizarre chant,
         and he was constantly practicing aloud. Sometimes a tutor came and chanted with him,
         sometimes in the evening Mr. Morgenstern chimed in, and all three discordantly bayed
         the melody. Marjorie heard the chant so often that she came to know it by heart. She
         was vexed to catch herself chanting as she walked along the street. With an effort
         of the will she would change over to Gilbert and Sullivan. Marjorie had had desultory
         Hebrew lessons as a girl, but at twelve, to her great rejoicing, she had been permitted
         to discontinue them. She had always been bored by the thick black letters that had
         to be read backward. Her Bible lessons had made her yawn until the tears ran. All
         of it had seemed an echo of the Stone Age, no more a part of the world of movies,
         boys, ice cream, and lipstick than the dinosaur skeletons in the museum. Seth, however,
         had taken to Hebrew from the first and had done well with it, though otherwise he
         had been a plain street boy, grimy and wild, concerned mainly with ball games, candy,
         baseball scores, black eyes, and bloody noses."|"Marjorie Morningstar"|"Herman Wouk"

         of tumbled furniture, strewn papers, stained cloths, and paint cans and ladders; it
         was being repainted a very fishy-smelling green. Greech ran here and there in his
         shirt sleeves, his face streaked green, snatching up a ringing telephone, bawling
         at the painters. He shouted when he saw her, “Get out, get out. No time for you, no

         them all to his charming rustic bungalow on the lake, and was moved after a while
         to send up to the kitchen for a case of domestic champagne. About two o’clock in the
         morning, when everyone was quite drunk and full of eagerness for the party to go on
         and on, somebody suggested that Noel play the score of his new musical comedy, Princess Jones. He tried to beg off, but there was a great clamor for it, and at last he sat at
         the piano and began. The noise died down; for they were theatre people, and the unfolding
         of a new creative work was a solemnity. They sat here and there, on the furniture
         and on the floor, drinking quietly as they listened. After a while their respect changed
         to enthusiasm, and then to excitement. Several times they broke into applause. When
         Noel finished—playing and singing the score took him over an hour—there was a tumult
         of congratulations. Marjorie thought Princess Jones was unmistakably brilliant; but, being Noel’s girl, she sat quietly, enjoying the
         rush of praise as much as he did, saying nothing. Wally Wronken reeled up to Noel
         with a highball in his hand, and actually got down on his hands and knees before him.
         “Salaam. You are the master, Noel. It’ll be produced in a year. It’s a sure smash.
         You’ll be rich and famous. I kneel to the master. Salaam.” He touched his forehead

         personal preferences, her tastes, her ideas, her inclinations. It was like another
         identity, a strange will that proceeded outward from the fleshly recesses of her body.
         It was a more insidious arguer than Noel. It was taking on more and more the sound
         of her normal inner voice, the familiar vigilant friend of a lifetime whose job it
         was to suggest that it was time to eat, or that the yellow dress would be more becoming
         than the green, or that she had better freshen her lipstick. In the same comradely
         tones this new voice kept suggesting ways and means of being alone with Noel. At eleven
         o’clock at night, when she was undressing for bed, she would suddenly think that she
         would love to read a new novel. It would then occur to her that she had seen the latest
         best seller in Noel’s room. She would have to fight with herself, exactly as with
         another person, to keep herself from going to visit him."|"Marjorie Morningstar"|"Herman Wouk"

         shirts, and began a lively paso doble. Into the center of the dance floor there leaped
         a tall figure in yellow, cracking a bull whip. It was Noel Airman, amazingly Mexican-looking
         in sideburns, mustache, and brown paint; only the deep-set glittering blue eyes identified
         him. His suit was trimmed, his boots studded with silver; he wore a silver-tasselled
         sombrero and silver-worked pistols; a belt of bullets slanted across his chest. “Buenos
         días, señoritas, señoras y señores!” Flashing a wild white-toothed grin, he lashed
         out again with the whip, and women guests yelped as the end of it flicked near them.
         With a laugh and a swift rattling announcement in Spanish, he disappeared. Half a

         repetition of the same joke. The Uncle returned to the table panting, dripping, grinning
         palely. “Vas good?” Marjorie and Noel urged him to go to the barracks to shower and
         change, and rather to her surprise the Uncle agreed. “Vun drink. To keep varm.” He
         swallowed a stiff shot of whiskey. Noel told him to be sure to come to the staff party

         was going to remind her of Michael Eden for a long time. It was a favorite of the

         in one of the smaller salons, Victor Herbert melodies at dinner, and reasonably inflamed
         jazz after ten at night, in the vessel’s night club, a charming little oval room called

         They played it twice more that evening, and several times each evening thereafter;
         and they sometimes obliged with it at dinner and at the tea-time concerts, too. The
         leader had worked up a florid passage for himself in the middle of the waltz. He would
         step forward and soar into his solo, swaying artistically, closing his eyes with pleasure
         at the sounds he was making; and when it was over he would blink and smirk around

12:00|"high noon"|"He glanced at her and laughed, one corner of his mouth pulled down. “I’ve never kidded
         you, have I? That’s why I wish to God you’d come a week later. I’m fed up to the teeth
         with Gerda Oberman, and if it’s any comfort to you I haven’t laid a hand on her in
         six or seven weeks. That’s at the bottom of all this feeble baiting, of course, but
         a fat lot of good it will do her. I couldn’t care less what Gertie says, thinks, or
         does. She could have an affair with a leprous Chinaman at high noon in the middle
         of the Place de la Concorde. I’d just stand by and cheer. This time next week I’ll
         be out of here, bag and baggage. The fact is, I’ve been thinking of going to the Mozart
         myself. Wouldn’t that be cosy, dear?—Christ, get that disapproving look off your face,
         Gerda has simply been a convenience. The fact is she actually started out as my landlady.
         It couldn’t have been more platonic. I was to have the living room to myself and one
         bedroom. I was paying her, and paying a damn good rent, too. But of course all she
         ever had in mind when she offered the place to me was my fair white body, that soon
         became obvious. What do you do when you’re behind on your rent and broke, and your
         landlady comes creeping into your room making fond little noises? Believe me, I’ve
         kept it as antiseptic as possible, Margie, I’ve been dry, distant, cold, you can’t
         imagine how cold I’ve been. That’s actually why I’ve been doing the cooking. From
         my viewpoint I’m more than contributing my share to the ménage and I can be as distant
         with her as I damn please. What’s the difference whether the man owns the apartment
         and the woman cooks or the other way around? It’s all convention. I happen to be a
         mighty good cook and I enjoy doing it, and from my viewpoint I’m completely independent
         here. Gertie’s put on twenty pounds from my cooking. Not that that’s been so good
         for her, she’s a Big Bertha to start with, but it does show that she’s been getting
         value for her two ratty rooms. I don’t think she’s eaten so well since she was born.

"ap 04:51"|"nine to five"|"“Now then, pay close attention, because a lot is going to hang on how you feel about
         this.” He lounged with an elbow on the piano top, looking up at her earnestly. In
         the candlelight he seemed very much the godlike man she had first seen at South Wind
         so long, long ago. “I told you I’ve been thinking of you a lot lately. That’s a gross
         understatement. So help me, I’ve thought of hardly anything else since I got back
         from Biarritz. Somehow that business with Bob and Elaine really spelled finis for
         me—finis to Paris, to Gerda, to Europe, to bumming around, yes, even to making fun
         of the bourgeoisie. Darling, if I’ve written you one letter I’ve written you nine,
         and then torn them up, because they were too mushy and ridiculous. I think there’s
         a half-finished one in my bedroom right now. But sweetheart, this is so much easier
         and better. I’m so everlastingly grateful to you for showing up. I’m ready to quit,
         Marjorie. That should be good news to you. All I want to be is a dull bourgeois. I’ve
         finally and irrevocably realized that nothing a man can do can make him stay twenty-two
         forever. But more important than that, and this is what’s decisive, I’ve decided that
         twenty-two gets to be a disgustingly boring age after a while. Staying up till all
         hours, sleeping around, guzzling champagne, being oh so crazy, oh so gay, is a damned
         damned damned damned BORE.” He struck the piano with the flat of his hand. “Being
         a shipping clerk in Macy’s can’t be half so boring in the long run because at least
         you’re doing something. These perpetual twenty-twos—and I frankly admit I’ve been
         one all too long—do absolutely nothing, they’re poisoned mice, that’s all, running
         frantically in circles till they drop dead. My plans are simple. I want to go home.
         I want to get some dull reliable job in some dull reliable advertising agency, and
         I want to drudge like a Boy Scout, nine to five, five days a week, fifty weeks a year
         with two weeks off in August, and slowly rise to be an under-under-under vice-president.
         I’m more than prepared to take all the guff and endure all the tastelessness and boredom.
         This time there’ll be no faltering, no nerve crises, because I’ve got real motives,
         see, motives that will endure, not a mere sophomoric urge to show I can play the game
         if I choose.”"|"Marjorie Morningstar"|"Herman Wouk"

         to her. What was she doing, really? Was she trying to change things between them at

         so definite or so stupid. She wasn’t at all sure how she would feel when she saw him.
