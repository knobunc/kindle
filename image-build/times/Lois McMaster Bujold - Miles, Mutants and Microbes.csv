"ap 05:00"|five|"""Oh, go away,"" she groaned. ""You have no appreciation for the complexities of the situation, none. What do you think one person can do? I used to have a life of my own, once, before this job swallowed it. I've given six years—which is five and three-quarters more than you have—I've given all I can. I'm burned out. When I get away from this hole, I never want to hear of quaddies again. They're not my children. I haven't had time to have children."""|"Miles, Mutants and Microbes"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
"~ 00:00"|"about midnight"|"Yei's suggested sleep was out of the question. Morosely, Van Atta returned not to his living quarters, but to his own downside office. He had not checked in there for a couple of weeks. It was about midnight now, Shuttleport Three time; his downside secretary was off-shift. It suited his foul humor to sulk alone."|"Miles, Mutants and Microbes"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
"< 00:00"|"before midnight"|"""Not if we make it back before midnight."" Murka's tone went wheedling. ""Look, m'CO's a right bastard. Suppose there's any way you could see your way clear that he doesn't find out about this?"" One of Murka's hands drifted suggestively past his wallet pocket."|"Miles, Mutants and Microbes"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
00:00|midnight|"""No,"" said the guard sergeant, ""I mean we aren't going to break both your legs before we throw you out on your ass."" He paused and added more kindly, ""There's a whorehouse back in town."" He slipped Murka's wallet out of his pocket, checked the name on the credit card and put it back, and removed all the loose currency. The guards did the same to the outraged-looking troopers, dividing the assorted cash up among them. ""They take credit cards, and you've still got till midnight. Now move!"""|"Miles, Mutants and Microbes"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"""Oh, he'll like that."" Nikki, at eleven, had not yet outgrown a passion for spaceships of every kind, but especially jumpships. It was still too early to guess whether the enthusiasm would turn into an adult avocation or fall by the wayside, but it certainly hadn't flagged yet. Miles peered more closely at the picture. The ancient D-620 had been an amazingly ungainly looking beast of a ship, appearing in this artist's rendition rather like an enormous metallic squid clutching a collection of cans. ""Large-scale replica, I take it?"""|"Miles, Mutants and Microbes"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
00:00|midnight|"Bel arrived promptly at the Kestrel's hatch, having changed from its staid work uniform into a startling but cheerful orange doublet with glinting, star-decorated blue sleeves, slashed trousers bloused into cuffs at the knee, and color-coordinated midnight-blue hose and friction boots. Variations of the style seemed to be the local high fashion for both males and females, whether with or without legs, judging by Greenlaw's less blinding outfit."|"Miles, Mutants and Microbes"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
00:00|midnight|"He rescanned the Idris's security vids on fast forward while waiting Roic's return. Paused close-up views of the hands of a number of otherwise unexceptionable visitors to the ship revealed no webs. It was nearing station midnight when Roic and Bel checked in."|"Miles, Mutants and Microbes"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
"> 04:00"|"four hours after midnight"|"Miles called both to cross-check; neither of his two passengers of interest had yet returned. It was over four hours after midnight, now, 0420 on the twenty-four-hour, Earth-descended clock that Quaddiespace still kept, generations after their ancestors' unmodified ancestors had departed the home world."|"Miles, Mutants and Microbes"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"

"~ 00:00"|"about midnight"|"""The portmaster stated explicitly that it was heading home to Nicol to rest, when it left the Kestrel about midnight,"" said Miles. ""A well-earned rest by that time, I might add. Your own guards should be able to confirm the exact time of Thorne's departure from my ship."""|"Miles, Mutants and Microbes"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
"ap ~ 02:00"|"About 0200"|"Miles abandoned his worried study of the injured haut infant and edged over to Venn.
""About 0200, sir,"" a distressed voice responded from the wrist com.
""This wasn't authorized!"""|"Miles, Mutants and Microbes"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
"ap 02:00"|Two|"How much time did Bel have? Half an hour? Two hours? How much time would it take Vorpatril to muster his new set of medical volunteers and all their complex cargo? More than half an hour, Miles was fairly certain. And what could they do when they got here?"|"Miles, Mutants and Microbes"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
