01:00|"one this morning"|"Tish nodded. “He and Dottie are all set to follow in his parents’ footsteps, and you simply can’t imagine how much I envy them!” Tears welled in her eyes and rolled down her woebegone face. She swiped them away. “I’m sorry, I’m being a rotten hostess. Would you like a bath? I’m sure there’s enough hot water left.”
“That’s all right, I had one this morning. A wash will do me.”
Her cousin summoned up a wavering smile. “Just as well. To be perfectly truthful, I should have said I hope there’s enough hot water. You’ve no idea how much the men use. Bister swears he spends all his time stoking the boiler.”"|"Dead in the Water"|"Carola Dunn"
"ap > 05:00"|"after five"|"“I’ll have a word with him,” said Rollo pacifically. “DeLancey, our Visitors’ Cup heat this afternoon isn’t till after five. I’m still not happy with our starts. See if you can round up Fosdyke, will you, and we’ll meet back at the boat-house in an hour for some practice.”"|"Dead in the Water"|"Carola Dunn"
"ap > 02:00"|"Past two o’clock"|"DeLancey was fully dressed in a pullover and flannels. Daisy glanced at the clock on the mantelpiece. Past two o’clock! He must have stayed downstairs drinking by himself.
Or perhaps he had fallen asleep downstairs, she thought, trying to be charitable, and was as much fuddled by sleep as drink. She hoped so, or tomorrow’s race would be another disaster."|"Dead in the Water"|"Carola Dunn"
02:00|"two in the
morning"|"Bosh! she told herself again, uneasily. It was two in the
morning—more like half past now—the time when all sorts of horrors tend to descend on the wakeful mind. On top of that, in the past few months she had found herself caught up in investigating several murders, so her brain was bound to run on those lines."|"Dead in the Water"|"Carola Dunn"
"ap ~ 02:00"|"About two"|"“About two. Just past.” Daisy noted that he expressed no concern for her safety. She could not decide whether to be pleased that he believed she could take care of herself, or hurt
by his lack of solicitude. Of course, he could see she had suffered no harm. “I looked at the clock when I turned on the light to see what was going on,” she added."|"Dead in the Water"|"Carola Dunn"
"ap 02:00"|two|"“It sounds as if DeLancey was hit before two, then, though I’ll have to talk to Mr. Fosdyke and Dr. Dewhurst about the symptoms. They’ll probably want a more precise description from you. What did you do about his intrusion?”"|"Dead in the Water"|"Carola Dunn"
"> 12:00"|"past noon"|"“I gather the last thing he would risk is causing talk. Perhaps he knew none of the people here went down to the bank to watch until this afternoon. The morning races were just a few odd heats, I understand. Today’s finals didn’t begin until well past noon.”"|"Dead in the Water"|"Carola Dunn"
"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"Alec asked when Lord DeLancey had last seen his brother alive.
“Yesterday, around noon.”
“And was his conduct then in any way out of the ordinary?”"|"Dead in the Water"|"Carola Dunn"
"ap ~ 10:45"|"About a quarter to eleven"|"“About a quarter to eleven. I was playing bridge. When I was dealt the dummy, I realised I wasn’t sure what time Ambrose’s race was this morning, so I called him up. Neither of us mentioned his ridiculous plan.”"|"Dead in the Water"|"Carola Dunn"
"ap ~ 10:45"|"about quarter to eleven"|"“I been talking to Mr. Gladstone. DeLancey barely noticed the servants existed, so there’s no motive there. He had a telephone call from his brother about quarter to eleven.”"|"Dead in the Water"|"Carola Dunn"
"ap > 03:00"|"past three"|"“I’d say it was highly unlikely,” Alec agreed. He found himself liking Frieth; just as well if they were to be cousins-in-law. Was it influencing his judgement? He could not see the young man as a liar, nor as quick to violence, let alone as a cold-blooded murderer. “You fell asleep in the end, I imagine,” he said. “Have you any idea what time?” Glancing at his wrist-watch, he was dismayed to see how late it was.
“The last time I remember checking, it was past three.”
“You’re prepared to swear neither you nor Cheringham left your room before then?”"|"Dead in the Water"|"Carola Dunn"
"ap ~ 08:20"|"about twenty past eight"|"“Mr. Gladstone and the parlour-maid both saw him come in about twenty past eight, when they were serving dinner. No one saw him after. I fetched your bags, Chief. Mr. Gladstone said to tell you young Fosdyke telephoned. He’ll stop at the Catherine Wheel tonight, with his pa. Lady Cheringham wants to know, do you want me and Ernie to stay the night in his room, the one he shared with Mr. DeLancey?”"|"Dead in the Water"|"Carola Dunn"
02:00|"two o’clock in the morning"|"“I woke up in the night, that night.” Now she had started, the words poured forth. “I started to worry about Bott and the fours boat. It was Rollo’s last chance to win a cup, and I thought if he didn’t, he’d quit the university and that would be the end of us. You know how awful everything seems at two o’clock in the morning.”"|"Dead in the Water"|"Carola Dunn"
