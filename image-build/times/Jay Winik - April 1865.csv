12:00|noon|"Abraham Lincoln had been at the Capitol since midmorning, forgoing a traditional celebratory carriage ride up Pennsylvania Avenue to sign a stack of bills passed in the waning hours of the lame-duck Congress. He was determined to make his own mark on them before the vice presidential swearing in, scheduled for noon. Cloistered in the Senate wing, tracing and retracing the letters of his name, Lincoln remained the very picture of exhaustion. His face was heavily lined, his cheeks were sunken, and he had lost thirty pounds in recent months. Though only fifty-six, he could easily pass for a very old man. He was sick, dispirited, and even his hands were routinely cold and clammy. And today, the weather itself seemed to be colluding with his foul and melancholy mood. That morning, heavy clouds moved over Washington, as they had the day before and the day before that, whipping the capital with blasts of rain and wind. Even when the rain let up, the ground didn’t. The streets were a sea of mud at least ten inches deep. Still, the people came."|"April 1865"|"Jay Winik"

That meeting had proved to be an eye-opener. A Confederate courier, sent by Lee, had roused Gordon sometime around midnight, and it took the thirty-three-year-old two hours of hard riding in a bitter chill to reach the commanding general at his Edge Hill headquarters, outside Petersburg. There, as Union troops slumbered and Washington celebrated, Gordon found Lee surrounded by a long table strewn with recent reports from every part of the army. One by one, Lee handed Gordon the papers to read. Lee, his face tight, already knew what was in them."|"April 1865"|"Jay Winik"

In the weeks and days that followed, the matter continued to be debated endlessly in the Southern press and by Southern politicians, with perhaps the tensest confrontation occurring at noon on February 9, during a mass meeting at the African Church in Richmond, one of the rallies held in the wake of the failure of the North-South meeting at Hampton Roads."|"April 1865"|"Jay Winik"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"But as the early sun began to climb, the Confederate forces proved pitifully inadequate. They faced a fierce Union counterattack, a converging fire so intense that it was likened to a “metallic storm” or a massing, dark “flock of blackbirds with blazing tails beating about in a gale.” By eight o’clock, Lee’s daring raid had sputtered, and by midmorning, the Confederates had been driven back with a terrible loss of 4,800 men. The attack had gained Lee nothing, nothing except the loss of a solid tenth of his command. And if there were one thing he could ill afford to lose at this point, it was precisely that. Yet, “as if incapable of exhaustion,” noted Lee’s personal physician, “Lee rode erect—and from his perch, never faltered or lost his cool.” But as the reality hit that the assault had failed, and failed badly, even Lee could not mask the “careworn expression” lining his face. He knew time was running short."|"April 1865"|"Jay Winik"

12:00|noon|"The Wilderness began as did so many other fateful battles—with a chance encounter. But within hours, this battle became something radically different. Under the dense cover of the woods, a savage fighting ruled: soldiers could rarely see the enemy through the twisted expanse of scrub oak and pines. They fired blindly into the smoke and murk, shooting at adversaries and allies alike. By noon, the combat had descended into sheer chaos. Commands separated and scattered. Mistakes went unexploited. And the geometry of conflict was maddening; opposing pockets of men, lost or confused or confounded, were tangled along all points of the compass—and soon the compass was the only instrument by which commanders could find their regiments. Darker than the blackest night, beneath the canopy of smoke and trees, without even stars to steer by, the Wilderness was now plunged into what one veteran described as the “battle of the invisibles with invisibles.” Explained another soldier, “It was a blind and bloody hunt to the death, in bewildering thickets, rather than a battle.” As the fighting raged throughout the afternoon, men crawled feverishly on their bellies, groping their way forward as bullets sliced through the air like a thousand small scythes. Then, suddenly, exploding rounds of shells set the underbrush on fire, and, soon, the crackle of flames intermingled with the wild screams of men and animals roasting alive."|"April 1865"|"Jay Winik"

After 8 P.M., except for random, anxious gunfire and the moans of the near-dead and dying, it grew strangely quiet. But the lull was only momentary: the Federals had secured a crucial position for attacking Lee’s right.

Railroad cars on the Danville line were hastily packed with boxes of official papers and more than $500,000 in gold and silver—gold eagles, gold bars, gold bullion, gold nuggets, and gold ingots; Mexican pesos; fine foreign currency; and gold plate and jewelry—while government officials tried to secure household goods and get reservations on the James River Canal packet boats for their families. It was generally assumed that the Confederate government had made adequate plans for evacuation. But events that afternoon told a different story. Church prayer services were canceled. For the next several hours, depositors stormed banks, and soldiers lugged wheelbarrows of Confederate specie onto the lawns of Capitol Square to light one of many fires set during the day.

12:00|midday|"This is not to say the obstacles weren’t considerable. By day, they fled along packed roads and stubby rural cut-throughs that necessitated traversing swollen, difficult streams and scaling high, sloping ridges. Sometimes the roads were open and expansive, but other stretches were far less hospitable, winding through uncut acres of scrub brush and pine that tore at and scratched their skin, their passage so narrow in spots that a single artillery wagon could barely slide past. Where they could, the men stepped around rocks and ruts. Where they could not, they simply went over or through them. At night, with little sleep and even less respite, the men continued to march under the cover of darkness. On and on, hour after hour, from hilltop to hilltop, for the better part of two solid nights and one continuous day, they struggled to keep their lead. By April 4, they were dirty, unwashed, mud-splattered, exhausted, and, most of all, desperately hungry. Their bread was gone, and so was their meat. Still, after months of languishing in the trenches, their morale and élan were surprisingly strong; and at the thought of food in Amelia, so were their spirits. And, too, they were comforted by this: once replenished, their lead over Grant solidified, they would complete their dash to safety. So what mattered now was each new stride, each new landmark, bringing them closer to the 350,000 rations they expected at Amelia Court House, and taking them a step farther away from Grant’s huge force, eagerly trailing behind.

Williams and an orderly set off across High Bridge, reaching rebel lines in darkness. There, they were met with a hail of gunfire from Confederate pickets that killed the orderly.

At the day’s end, with no response from Lee, he collapsed with a severe migraine. By the time Grant received Lee’s second dispatch, he had been trying to soothe himself with mustard plasters on his wrists and neck and with hot footbaths. Nothing worked. The anxiety was killing him. Now, under a soft midnight sky, with a bright, nearly full moon overhead, Grant sat up on a sofa in a comfortable frame house, abandoned by its occupants, scanned Lee’s letter, then handed it to his chief of staff to read aloud. The aide was furious at Lee’s brash response, but Grant just coolly shook his head."|"April 1865"|"Jay Winik"

With enemy artillery roaring in the background, that night Lee and his weary lieutenants gathered around a campfire in the woods near Appomattox Court House. In the distance, they could see the faint glow of Union fires ringing the rebel army. The Confederates were almost entirely surrounded, outnumbered nearly six to one, with little food, little hope of resupply, little prospect for immediate reinforcement. But there was still the distinct prospect of escape, especially if those fires were of cavalry, not infantrymen. And before the opportunity slipped away, Lee hoped to turn the momentary lull to his advantage. Six straight days of Lee’s relentless march westward had not dimmed his audacity, his remaining men’s courage, or his desire to avoid surrender and somehow salvage victory. He devised another plan for breaking through the enemy lines: his men would attack as soon as possible, attempting to slice a hole through Grant’s slumbering army, and if successful, they would resume the march southward. General John Gordon, one of Lee’s most daring officers, was chosen to lead the breakout. And, if necessary, there remained a fallback position: they could make their way to the Blue Ridge mountains, where, Lee had once said, he could hold out “for twenty years.”"|"April 1865"|"Jay Winik"

Gordon’s men fought with a special fury. They drove Federal cavalry from their positions, captured several guns, duly cleared the road of bluecoats, and then swept forward to the crest of a hill. Suddenly, below them, concealed in the woodlands, lay the inexorable logic of the mathematics of war: a solid wall of blue, some two miles wide, was advancing—two Yankee infantry corps, with two other Union corps closing in on Lee’s rear.

One would be hard-pressed to find a place more thoroughly despised by Quantrill and his comrades than Lawrence. It functioned as a Free-Soil citadel during the 1850s, then as a haven for runaway slaves, and, during the war, as a headquarters to the Redlegs, a band of hated Unionist guerrillas. Early in the morning of August 21, Quantrill and his 400 bushwhackers—including Frank James and Coleman Younger—struck. At 5 A.M., Quantrill and his men silently made their way into town. Then the killing began. With a triumphant yell, Quantrill began shouting, “Kill! Kill! Lawrence must be thoroughly cleansed … Kill! Kill!” For the next few hours, his fierce and sweaty long-haired men, unshaven and unwashed, rumbled up and down the streets of Lawrence, looting stores, shops, saloons, and houses. They systematically rounded up every man they encountered and then torched the town. By day’s end, the deed was done. The city lay in ashes; 200 homes were burned to the ground.

Last night there were no nightmares, no haunting visages, no frantic worries about ending the war and negotiating the foundering shoals of Reconstruction. True, there has been a dream, but this time it is a heartening one, in fact, the one that has come to him before on the cusp of other major military battles. He had it on the verge of Antietam and Gettysburg, and also Vicksburg and Fort Fisher, all-important Union victories. In it, he is on a phantom ship, a “single, indescribable vessel” that moves with “great rapidity” through the water, racing toward a “vast” and “indefinite shore.” To Lincoln, rising on this day, it signals good news. He feels that it augurs Joe Johnston’s surrender in North Carolina, thereby removing the most powerful Confederate army remaining in the field, and making another large-scale rebel assault almost impossible. It speaks of peace to come. And it fills him with a visible blast of optimism."|"April 1865"|"Jay Winik"

Lincoln is finally able to relax a bit, exuding uncommonly good spirits. You seem “so gay,” Mary tells him, so “cheerful—almost joyous.” “And well I may feel so,” he says, thinking ahead. “I consider this the day the war has come to a close.” Then, in a tender, conciliatory voice, he recalls the biting private troubles that they have experienced over the last four years, “We must both be more cheerful in the future; between the war and the loss of our darling [son] Willie, we have been very miserable.”"|"April 1865"|"Jay Winik"

As the carriage slips out into the street, its large wooden wheels groaning and creaking, and makes its way to Senator Harris’s place, gaslights flicker spookily in the streets. The sky is overcast, and it is so foggy out that as the Lincolns drive on, they can barely see through the moist air and wandering evening haze: pedestrians become mere silhouettes; buildings disappear altogether; and it is nearly impossible to make out what lies beyond the next corner. Only Lincoln’s personal attendant and the coachman are riding with them; Lincoln’s guard for the evening, John F. Parker, has already gone ahead. The carriage pulls up to the theater at 8:30; “This way to Ford’s!” a barker outside is crying. “This way to Ford’s!” The performance has been under way for twenty minutes. So the two couples quickly hurry inside, Mary squired on Lincoln’s arm, the attractive Clara Harris on Rathbone’s."|"April 1865"|"Jay Winik"

As Lincoln slumps forward, the entire theater is enveloped in mayhem. People begin yelling hysterically, pushing one another into aisles, even rushing for the exits in fear that the assassination of the president might be the signal for a general massacre. They are not far from the truth. It is 10:15, and John Wilkes Booth’s shooting of the Union president is but one of three coordinated assaults scheduled to take place at this very moment across the city. In addition to Lincoln, the vice president, Andrew Johnson, is to be murdered. If both the president and vice president are incapacitated, the secretary of state will—according to the laws of the day—call a meeting of the electors the following December, a full eight months away, to elect a new president and vice president. And so William Seward, the secretary of state, is also targeted. In the ensuing chaos and disorder that would surely follow, Booth reasoned, the Confederacy would be poised to take advantage, perhaps winning its independence yet."|"April 1865"|"Jay Winik"

Finally, Farwell announces: I am going to the theater at Ford’s. Would you like to come? Johnson declines. He prefers to read in his room, then turn in. By ten o’clock, the gaslight is flicked off, and he is asleep in Suite 68, unaware that the third-floor room above houses his designated assassin, George Atzerodt. Atzerodt is a German immigrant and a carriage maker who, in his spare time, ferried Confederate spies across the Potomac. In his room lie the nefarious implements of conspiracy, kidnapping, and murder: a bankbook, coiled rope, and two carbines hidden between the mattress and the bedsprings.

What could have been more incongruous? This was, after all, just five days after the giddy glow of Appomattox. But as a long wooden coffin was quietly edged down the narrow lodging house steps on Tenth Street, through the mud and onto the roads, carrying Abraham Lincoln’s body back to the White House, flags drooped to half-mast everywhere and the muffled ringing of bells could be heard against the rain. Now it was the voices of revenge that could be heard loudest. Citizens poured into the streets, in the downpour, and soon they were nothing more than muttering mobs, a hostile throng angrily congregating from K Street to Lafayette Square: they shook their fists at Ford’s Theater, shouting “Burn the theater!”; a cascade of ugly roars and boos spontaneously swelled up, fell, then continued even more loudly; any mention of Confederates brought an equally vociferous reprise: “Shoot them!” “Hang them!” “Hang them again!” “Kill the god damn rebels!” Talk of streets running red with Confederate blood was everywhere. And with the iron hand of martial law imposed upon the Union capital, the city remained edged with fear. In every direction, a phalanx of armed guards sought to keep order, manning stations on all roads to and from the city. Government departments and business houses were abruptly closed; the city was immediately cordoned off; routine market wagons, milk carts, and mail riders were turned around and sent back beyond the outskirts; theaters and music halls hastily canceled their engagements; and concerts and social functions were postponed indefinitely. But if the streets threatened to turn crimson with vengeance, they were just as quickly tinged with the real color of sorrow. Black was ubiquitous. So, too, were the telltale sounds of mourning. The White House columns were draped in black, and somber black folds were looped along all the Federal buildings. The melancholy sound of organs rippled across town, and altar candles were lit. Soldiers fastened shreds of darkened crepe and cut rib bon on their sleeves. Even the poor pinned scraps of black cloth in their windows and on their modest doorposts."|"April 1865"|"Jay Winik"

Whatever his legacy, one has to consider the incident at Fort Pillow, which has been debated by contemporary observers and historians ever since it happened on that fateful day of April 12, 1864. The basic facts are well known. As part of a series of ten separate engagements over several weeks, Forrest came across the Union garrison of Fort Pillow on the Mississippi River. This garrison had little special strategic meaning, although capturing it would be a significant morale booster for the South. But it mattered for other reasons: it was manned by locally recruited Unionists whom Forrest derided as “Tennessee Tories” and some 270 blacks, mostly escaped slaves, whom Forrest labeled a “damned nigger regiment.” Forrest issued his customary demand for surrender, adding, if not, “I cannot be responsible for the fate of your command.” Not only did the fort commander refuse, but the cocky Federals openly taunted Forrest, daring him to try to take the garrison. It was the mistake of their lives. The assault came quickly, and within hours, Fort Pillow had devolved into little more than a lurid slaughter pen: many of the blacks, estimated at 100—and a number of whites as well—were not allowed to surrender and were butchered in cold blood instead, even as they fell to their knees and with uplifted hands screamed for mercy. Word of the ghastly slaughter quickly spread throughout the entire North, and soon, the Union was crying out for revenge."|"April 1865"|"Jay Winik"
"ap < 00:58"|"almost two to one"|"Evidence of this cruel sally only further galvanized the North and led it to redouble its efforts to stop Forrest. They failed. At Brices Cross Roads near Tupelo, Mississippi, Forrest again more than lived up to his name. In late spring of 1864, Sherman had dispatched an 8,000-man Union force, composed of blacks and whites, to hunt Forrest down and prevent him from moving into middle Tennessee. As was often the case, Forrest was outnumbered, this time almost two to one, but he was un-fazed. Using the elements as his ally—the densely wooded terrain and blazing Mississippi heat—he anticipated that the Federal cavalry would arrive well ahead of the infantry, thus allowing him to “whip them” with impunity. When the Union footsoldiers finally caught up, he would then be able to slice them up, too."|"April 1865"|"Jay Winik"

The new president had already made post-inaugural statements lumping, treason together with rape and murder as a crime that “must be punished.” To Johnson, then, this memorandum was heresy; for one thing, no military man had the right to decide political matters, and Sherman had clearly overstepped his authority. For another, there were the terms of the memorandum itself. In strongly suggesting that all Confederates would be exculpated from blame, they all but overrode the executive’s authority to decide guilt or innocence of Confederate traitors, including those who had served in the central government. The memorandum was scarcely any better on the matter of the Negro issue: not one of the seven numbered paragraphs made mention of the fate of freed slaves. Worse still, the whole matter reeked, looking as though one of the country’s top generals was seeking to end the war by reproducing the conditions that began it. Indeed, the provision that homeward-bound rebels would deposit their arms in state arsenals sounded conspicuously like a plan for keeping them ready and stacked for rebellion, once the Confederates had time to rest themselves and then plot anew."|"April 1865"|"Jay Winik"

Subsequently, he received demerits for spitting on the floor, for sloppy quarters, for long hair during inspection, for visiting during study hours, for absences during reveille, for absences from class and from the evening parade, for firing his musket out his dormitory window, for disobeying orders and using “spirituous liquors,” for refusing to march from mess hall, for cooking in his quarters after 8 P.M., and for “foul clothes not in clothes bag.” But his class standing and raucous behavior belied an active mind.

Even in death, his gangly frame filled the open casket; his head rested on a white pillow, a queer smile fixed on his lips. At eleven that morning, the services began."|"April 1865"|"Jay Winik"

Their contrast with the troops the day before couldn’t have been greater: where the men of the East were crisp and well kept, they were sunburned and shaggy and wore loose shirts; and where the Easterners were stocky, sophisticated, mesomorphic, Sherman’s men of the West were taller, bonier, with the rough, gaunt look of the frontier. The crowd loved them just the same. They erupted in shouts of “Hurrah!” Weren’t these the men who had rescued Lincoln before the fateful, decisive election of 1864? Weren’t these the men who had taken Atlanta and burned Columbia? And the cheers grew even louder at the sight of Sherman himself, with his battered slouch hat in hand, his auburn beard grizzled, his face wrinkled, his popularity now greater than ever."|"April 1865"|"Jay Winik"

Talk of streets running red: Across the Union, those who professed the slightest sympathy for the killing of Lincoln put their life in danger—literally. Thirty-five-year-old Joseph Shaw, the editor of the Westminster (Maryland) Democrat, was killed in Zachariah’s Hotel while defending himself from a hostile mob, who physically broke into his hotel room. They brutally fell upon him and killed him because of “disrespectful language” about Lincoln ¿n his paper, Turner, Beware the People Weeping, 50–51; his press was also destroyed by mob action. In another instance, at the Mission Church in the First Ward, a preacher made some insulting comments about Lincoln in the course of a Sunday sermon; he was dragged from the pulpit, assaulted, then arrested, Leech, 369. Instances like this, of assault, mob rule, or murder, were commonplace in the days that followed. On this also see Glenn, 206–9. Wrote the New York Times: Quotes are from April 17, 1865. for under an hour: Remarkably, outside of speculation, it is not known what the two men even talked about. Edwin Stanton …, tendered his resignation: Oates describes him “as looking exhausted and utterly worn down from illness” and strain. He stayed on only because Lincoln prevailed upon him to remain. “Reluctantly,” Stanton said, he would (Oates’s words), “stay with Lincoln a little longer,” 423. By any measure, Stanton would become one of the most controversial characters of this time period, and then again of the Johnson administration. Ironically, the flap over Johnsons impeachment was about Stanton’s refusal to be fired, which sheds some light on his actions during these April days. “Acting President”: Foote, 983; Grant wrote in his Memoirs that “Stanton felt little hesitation in assuming the function of the executive,” 656. By comparison—and this underscores how ill-formed the succession mechanism still was—consider the enormous criticism that Ronald Reagan’s secretary of state, Alexander Haig, received for asserting temporarily, “I’m in charge here,” after the failed attempt on Reagan’s life."|"April 1865"|"Jay Winik"

Silva, Presidential Succession, 1–13, and Wilhelm, “Origins of the Office of the Vice Presidency,” 36–51; also Michael Dorman, The Second Man: The Changing Role of the Vice Presidency (Delacorte, 1968), 45–46. they did not intend for the vice president to become president: Wilhelm agrees with this. He also notes that the delegates at the convention did not consider the matter “a major topic.” And further, that historical documents still “leave the question of why the office was even created a mystery,” “Origins of the Office of the Vice Presidency,” 214; Jefferson ally William Rives referred to the whole matter of succession as a “remote and shadowy inheritance,” Silva, Presidential Succession, 114–15.

Burgess, Political Science and Comparative Constitutional Law (Ginn 8c Company, 1891), 239; William Rawle, A View of the Constitution of the United States (H. C. Carey & I. Lea, 1825), vol. 1, 711; David Watson, The Constitution of the United States: Its History, Application, and Construction, 2 vols. (University of Chicago Press, 1910), vol. 1, 891–902. Indeed, for the better part of a half century: On March 1, 1792, Congress did pass a presidential succession law, which provided that a vice president can resign or refuse election in one way only, with a written refusal signed and dated and delivered to the secretary of state, Wilhelm, “Origins of the Office of the Vice Presidency,” 213. The law also provided that the president pro tempore of the Senate or speaker of the house would be in line to act as president, until presidential electors were chosen or elected and a special election held. One may ask, why was the secretary of state not put in line? The reason was politics, having to do with Alexander Hamilton’s hatred of Thomas Jefferson. On this point, the choleric Fisher Ames, Federalist leader in Massachusetts, gleefully reported to Thomas Dwight: “The Secretary of State is struck out of the bill for the future presidency, in case of the first two offices becoming vacant. His friends think it important to hold him up as King of the Romans. The firmness of the Senate kept him out,” See Silva, Presidential Succession, 113–14; for a larger discussion of congressional actions on this matter, occurring in 1792, 1820–21, and 1842, see Silva, Presidential Succession, 112–16, 166–68. Interestingly, when President Johnson was later impeached, many in Congress asserted that he was still “vice president,” and for the time, only “acting president.” Others noted simply that he was serving out “Lincoln’s term.” Indeed, the three original impeachment resolutions introduced by Benjamin F. Loan and John Kelso spoke of “the officer now exercising the function pertaining to the office of President of the United States”; James Ashley’s resolution referred to “Andrew Johnson, Vice President and acting President of the United States”; and another resolution put it this way: “Vice President of the United States, discharging the powers and duties of the office of the President.” The Final Judiciary Committee resolutions that impeached him, however, did so as the “president.” See Silva, Presidential Succession, note on 26 and 27. But even the Founders were not omniscient to So by the time Lincoln lay dying: Silva, Presidential Succession, 14–31, and conclusions, esp. 166–69; Stathis, “John Tyler’s Presidential Succession”; also Chidsey, And Tyler Too, esp. 41–53; and Dormán, Second Man, esp. 45–55. hours away in Williamsburg: Some 230 miles and at least twenty-one hours, to be exact. This in itself was a telling fact about the lack of importance of the vice presidency. Washington was alive with fierce speculation: Chidsey writes that the capital was in a “state of pitiful bewilderment” over the succession issue. “Learned statesman everywhere were asking themselves the question” of succession, which had been left “in the air.” the cabinet would run the show: As Chidsey puts it: “That this amiable Virginian might become … the full time, undisputed president, Webster did not for a moment believe”; moreover, the secretaries assembled “were to rule the nation in Tyler’s name,” And Tyler Too, 44–45. Before relatively newer scholarship, Tyler’s succession had been blandly portrayed by some as almost devoid of political intrigue. See Oliver Chitwood, John Tyler: Champion of the Old South (D. Appleton, 1939), 202–6; Leonard Dinnerstein, “The Accession of John Tyler to the Presidency,” Virginia Magazine of History and Biography 70 (October 1952): 447–58; Robert Seager, And Tyler Too (Easton Press, 1963). Tyler had won the showdown: Claude Fuess says that Tyler “made it entirely clear that he intended to seize full authority,” Claude M. Fuess, Daniel Wehster, 2 vols. (Little, Brown, 1930), vol. I, 95. Similarly, of the ambitious Tyler, Morgan argues, “Tyler’s whole course of action after he arrived in the capital demonstrated [his] serious deliberation to establish himself as President in his own right and not as a mere caretaker for the departed Harrison,” Robert J. Morgan, A Whig Embattled: The Presidency Under John Tyler (Lincoln, 1954), 9. special presidential election should be called for: Chidsey points out, however, “Could a man in truth be President who had never been elected President? This was the question that perplexed even the most expert hairsplitters in Washington,” And Tyler Too, 50. administered not by Chief Justice Taney: One unsatisfactory reason could be that Taney was a resident of Baltimore, while Cranch lived in Washington. But this still does not explain his essential refusal to administer the oath to Tyler.
