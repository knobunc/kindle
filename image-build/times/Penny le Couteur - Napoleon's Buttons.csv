16:01|1601|"Astonishingly, preventives and remedies for scurvy during these years were known—but largely ignored. As early as the fifth century, the Chinese were growing fresh ginger in pots on board their ships. The idea that fresh fruit and vegetables could alleviate symptoms of scurvy was, no doubt, available to other countries in Southeast Asia in contact with Chinese trading vessels. It would have been passed on to the Dutch and been reported by them to other Europeans as, by 1601, the first fleet of the English East India Company is known to have collected oranges and lemons at Madagascar on their way to the East. This small squadron of four ships was under the command of Captain James Lancaster, who carried bottled lemon juice with him on his flagship, the  Dragon. Anyone who showed signs of scurvy was dosed with three tea-spoons of lemon juice every morning. On arrival at the Cape of Good Hope, none of the men on board the Dragon was suffering from scurvy, but the toll on the other three ships was significant. Despite Lancaster’s instructions and example, nearly a quarter of the total crew of this expedition died from scurvy—and not one of these deaths was on his flagship."|"Napoleon's Buttons"|"Penny le Couteur"
"ap ~ 00:57"|"about three to one"|"This polymer is today known as polystyrene and is used for plastic films, packing materials, and “Styrofoam” coffee cups. Styrene—prepared synthetically as early as 1866—and butadiene were the starting materials used by the German chemical company IG Farben in the manufacture of artificial rubber. The ratio of butadiene (CH2=CH-CH=CH2) to styrene is about three to one in SBR; though the exact ratio and structure are variable, it is thought that the double bonds are randomly cis or trans."|"Napoleon's Buttons"|"Penny le Couteur"
00:00|midnight|"In addition to their penchant for toads, one of the most abiding myths about witches is that they were able to fly, often on broomsticks, to attend a sabbat—a midnight tryst, supposedly an orgiastic parody of the Christian mass. Many accused witches confessed, under torture, to flying to such sabbats. This is not surprising—we too would probably make such a confession if we were subject to the same horrific agonies perpetrated in the search for truth. The surprising thing is that a number of accused witches confessed, before torture, to the impossible feat of flying to a sabbat on a broomstick. As such a confession would not likely have helped these victims escape torture, it is quite possible that these women truly believed they had flown up the chimney on a broomstick and indulged in all sorts of sexual perversions. There may be a very good chemical explanation for their belief—a group of compounds known as alkaloids."|"Napoleon's Buttons"|"Penny le Couteur"
00:00|midnight|"The chemical explanation is, of course, that the supposed witches did not fly on broomsticks to sabbats. The flights were ones of fancy, illusions brought on by the hallucinatory alkaloids. Modern accounts of hallucinogenic states from scopolamine and atropine sound remarkably like the midnight adventures of witches: the sensation of flying or falling, distorted vision, euphoria, hysteria, a feeling of leaving the body, swirling surroundings, and encounters with beasts. The final stage of the process is a deep, almost comalike sleep."|"Napoleon's Buttons"|"Penny le Couteur"
00:00|midnight|"It is not difficult to imagine how, in a time steeped in sorcery and superstition, users of flying ointments really did believe they had flown through the night sky and taken part in wild dancing and wilder revelries. The hallucinations from atropine and scopolamine have been described as particularly vivid. A witch would have no reason to believe  the effects of her flying ointment were solely in her mind. It is also not difficult to imagine how the knowledge of this wonderful secret was passed on—and it would have been considered a wonderful secret. Life for most women in these times was hard. Work was never ending, disease and poverty ever present, and a woman’s control over her own destiny unheard of. A few hours of freedom, riding the skies to a gathering where one’s sexual fantasies were played out, then waking up safely in one’s own bed must have been a great temptation. But unfortunately the temporary escape from reality created by the molecules of atropine and scopolamine often proved fatal, as women accused of witchcraft who confessed to such imagined midnight exploits were burned at the stake."|"Napoleon's Buttons"|"Penny le Couteur"
