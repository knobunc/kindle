She had only been allowed the privilege of seeing romance for a short time, but it was not really her portion in life. Now all the practical, terrifying worries of her daily life poured back into her mind. She was now the applicant for a post and Miss LaFosse her possible employer. She would never learn who Phil was, or what his last name was, or why Miss LaFosse so urgently wanted him away when she so obviously enjoyed his kisses."|"Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day"|"Winifred Watson"

Miss Lafosse disengaged herself from the newcomer’s arms and Miss Pettigrew saw him clearly for the first time. Graceful, lithe, beautifully poised body. Dark, vivid looks: a perfection of feature and colouring rare in a man. Brilliant, piercing eyes of a dark bluish-purple colour: a beautiful, cruel mouth, above which a small black moustache gave him a look of sophistication and a subtle air of degeneracy that had its own appeal. Something predatory in his expression: something fascinating and inescapable in his personality."|"Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day"|"Winifred Watson"

One had a background of midnight blue, patterned in a wild design of colours. The other was black, with a silver dog-collar and wide, transparent sleeves, fastened tight around the wrist with silver bands, and a silver girdle round the waist. Miss Pettigrew liked them both. She didn’t mind which Miss LaFosse wore, but she looked solemn, wise and knowing and pointed decisively to the black. Black was always safe."|"Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day"|"Winifred Watson"

“OH!” gasped Miss Pettigrew. She was nearly knocked over by the flying passage of a female body belonging to a lady of startling attractions. Miss Pettigrew gaped, blinked and devoured them avidly. The lady was young, slim, arresting. Her face was of a deep, creamy pallor, devoid of any colour except the wicked red bow of her mouth. Hair, like black lacquer, parted in the middle, was coiled in an elaborate roll at the nape of her neck. A tiny hat was perched at an acute angle at the side of her head. Black brows curved with an unnatural slant above eyes of a surprisingly vivid blue for a brunette. Long, black lashes, as thick and curled as the most famous of film star’s, held Miss Pettigrew’s fascinated attention. Vivid green ear-rings dangled from tiny, shell-like ears snug against her head. As she moved, a delicate perfume, subtly alluring, beguiled Miss Pettigrew’s senses. Her clothes…Miss Pettigrew gave it up. Her experience had not fitted her to describe Parisian confections. The lady had flung open her fur coat and tossed her gloves on the couch. Obviously here to stay. Miss Pettigrew turned and shut the door."|"Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day"|"Winifred Watson"
