00:00|midnight|"Still, the old name, the one James actually uses, works even better. Daisy does indeed suffer from Roman fever. She’s in an overheated, frantic state of eagerness to join the snobby upper class. (“We’re dying to be exclusive,” she says early on.) When she makes her fatal midnight trip to the Colosseum and is ignored by Winterbourne, she says, “He cuts me dead.” And the next thing we know, she is dead. Roman fever perfectly captures what happens to Daisy, this fresh young thing from the wilds of America (Schenectady, actually). She’s killed by the clash between her own lively youth and the rotten atmosphere of Europe, the Old World."|"How to Read Literature Like a Professor_ For Kids"|"Thomas C. Foster"

Think of the ghost of Hamlet’s father, when he takes to appearing on the castle ramparts at midnight. He’s not there simply to haunt his son; he’s there to point out something seriously wrong in Denmark’s royal household. (What’s wrong? Oh, just that the king’s brother first murdered the king and then married his widow.)"|"How to Read Literature Like a Professor_ For Kids"|"Thomas C. Foster"
00:00|midnight|"Henry James has a famous story, “Daisy Miller” (1878), in which there are no ghosts, there is no demonic possession—there’s nothing more mysterious than a midnight jaunt to the Colosseum in Rome. Daisy is a young American woman who does as she pleases. She upsets the social customs of the rich Europeans she meets. Eventually, Daisy dies, apparently because she caught malaria on her trip to the Colosseum. But you know what actually kills her? Vampires."|"How to Read Literature Like a Professor_ For Kids"|"Thomas C. Foster"

A lonely outpost during an uprising? Fort Apache, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon—the woods are full of ’em. Cattle drive? Red River."|"How to Read Literature Like a Professor_ For Kids"|"Thomas C. Foster"
