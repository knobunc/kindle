Alex Sharkey is the only person in the room who pays the ghosts any attention; to pass the time, he has been trying to derive the algorithm which controls their seemingly random promenade. He arrived twenty minutes early, and now, according to the watch he bought on his way here, it is twelve minutes past three, and his client is late."|Fairyland|"Paul J. McAuley"

"ap 03:18"|"eighteen minutes past three"|"Alex lights another cigarette and checks the time again. He has an edgy sliding feeling that things have gone wrong. He has always hated waiting around, having to be on time. For this one occasion, when he had to be punctual, he bought a watch, and all it does is make him more nervous. It is a piece of recyclable Polish street shit that cost less than a single espresso, graphic film on a hexagon of varnished fibreboard, a bright orange cloth strap. It runs on the faint myoelectric field generated by Alex’s wrist muscles—it’s a time-binding parasite. There’s a black eagle impressed on the watch-face, and the eagle raises its wings and breathes fire when Alex tilts his wrist to look at it. The hands are black slivers generated by the same chip that runs the eagle. The graphic film is already wrinkling: the eagle has a broken wing; the hour hand is kinked. It is eighteen minutes past three."|Fairyland|"Paul J. McAuley"
"ap 03:40"|"twenty to four"|"It’s twenty to four, and the boarding announcement for the Trans-Europe Express has been made, and the passengers are beginning to leave, when the waiter brings Alex his espresso. Alex pays with a credit card which doesn’t have his name on it, knocks back the coffee and walks over to the woman with the leashed doll. He stands there, looking at her. It’s silly and he knows it won’t really make him feel better, but he has to do it."|Fairyland|"Paul J. McAuley"
10:00|"ten in the morning"|"The deal with Ray takes a while to complete. There are sensibilities to satisfy, forms as elaborate as Japanese tea ceremonies to be observed. It is too late to even think about sleep by the time Alex gets back to his workshop and finds a message from Billy Rock’s expert system telling him that a limo will pick him up at ten in the morning. Apparently Billy Rock was expecting Alex to make contact. He wants to meet."|Fairyland|"Paul J. McAuley"
10:00|"Ten in the morning"|"Alex has been up early, has already been to pay the visit to his mother that he promised himself he’d make if he wasn’t arrested after the deal was fucked. Lexis has a new boyfriend, a scrawny kid barely out of his teens. All the time Alex is there, the boyfriend sits in the other room drinking canned lager and watching football on interactive TV, switching restlessly from viewpoint to viewpoint, the volume turned up so loud it rattles the paper-thin walls of the flat. Ten in the morning, for Christ’s sake."|Fairyland|"Paul J. McAuley"
00:00|midnight|"‘Sure,’ Alex says, although he knows he’ll call for a cab right here in Ma Nakome’s, which even close to midnight is busy, people sitting at the plastic tables scattered on the pavement outside and the little bar crowded, Hi Life Dub blaring out across the heads of the customers in the hot dark air."|Fairyland|"Paul J. McAuley"
03:33|"three thirty-three a.m."|"Alex fights up from sleep. He’s standing by the computer, his bare feet cold on gritty concrete. He’s naked except for a T-shirt. Sweat streams down his flabby, hairless chest and heavy flanks. It’s three thirty-three a.m. An omen. He has the feeling that someone has been talking to him, and just then the phone rings, loud in the still black air."|Fairyland|"Paul J. McAuley"
10:00|"ten in the morning"|"They are standing under the trees at the riverside edge of the car park in the shadow of the Tower of London, both smoking cigarettes they hold cupped inside their palms, a habit Alex learnt in prison. They might be a couple of old lags, discussing some scam in one of those old Ealing films that have recently become popular all over again, in a wave of nostalgic yearning for the thumbsucking comfort of a safe stable past that never really was. Across the car park, tourists queue patiently as they wait to be allowed to pass through the metal detector at the security fence. A family stands stiffly around a sweating Beefeater while the father videos them. It is ten in the morning, but already swelteringly hot under a milky white sky. The river is at low tide, flowing as sluggishly as brown jelly between stinking mud banks. On the far side, HMS Belfast shimmers in a haze."|Fairyland|"Paul J. McAuley"

I’ll bust your premises every day, eight a.m. on the dot, until you run to Billy and beg to be put out of your misery. All I’m asking for is a little cooperation, and that’s not much to ask after two years of watching your fat arse and listening to your pathetic line in hacker boasts.’"|Fairyland|"Paul J. McAuley"

"ap 00:58"|"two to one"|"It’s blazing hot outside. The air is soggy with unshed moisture, the sky as blank as a sheet of paper. Traffic snarls at a sullen stop-and-go pace either side of Trafalgar Square and the shattered stump of Nelson’s Column, which still shows the black searing of the explosion that brought it down five years ago. Twenty or so students are holding a protest under the serene gaze of one of Edwin Landseer’s bronze lions. They are masked with caricatures of the Prime Minister, or with red or black cloth hoods in which eye-holes have been roughly torn. Police watch from a distance. One constable is openly videoing the gathering. The police outnumber the protestors two to one. Alex is too far away to hear the students’ unamplified chants, or read the slogans on their T-shirts. Then one of the students holds up a placard showing a doll’s blue, apish face overprinted with broken manacles, and Alex must smile at the irony."|Fairyland|"Paul J. McAuley"
"ap < 11:00"|"almost eleven"|"Now all Alex has to do is follow instructions. The little girl, a.k.a. Alfred Russel Wallace, gave him no choice in the matter. It is almost eleven, and there’s a queue at the security barrier at the exit of Charing Cross tube station, where a couple of bored guards in Kevlar vests over short-sleeved shirts check IDs. A third stands behind the wire mesh with a neat little automatic rifle slung under his arm."|Fairyland|"Paul J. McAuley"

"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"‘I’m being leaned on,’ Perse had said. He looked worse than Alex felt. Although it was past midnight, he was still in the Drug Squad’s operations room. He stubbed out a cigarette in a plastic cup at the blurry edge of the phone’s field of vision, lit another with his Zippo. ‘There’s heavy stuff going down, and you’re seen as expendable.’"|Fairyland|"Paul J. McAuley"
"ap ~ 02:00"|"about two o’clock"|"‘There’s a standpipe,’ the man says, pointing along the track. ‘Man who run it give a fair price. Storm drain beyond it for your sanitary needs. Don’t go dumping your shit out your window and driving off. Samaritans come by about two o’clock you want something to eat, if you don’t mind the prayers. You missed the do-gooders from the ’burbs, but Samaritan food is better.’"|Fairyland|"Paul J. McAuley"

23:59|"one of Midnight"|"Armand once had a special friend amongst the Algerians: Hassan, the youngest, with sad brown eyes and a thick drooping moustache. It was Hassan who told Armand that he had been in the Foreign Legion—the red dot on Armand’s wrist is a military ID chip. Hassan, who liked to play around with electronics, used a modified supermarket scanner to read the chip’s data into the Algerians’ portable computer. But most of the data was corrupted; all the chip yielded was Armand’s date and place of birth. He was born near Lyon, a town called Chambéry. He remembers nothing about it. And he is exactly as old as the new Millennium, one of Midnight’s Children. Although, as Hassan pointed out, the real Millennium is almost five hundred years away, the Algerians still regard this coincidence as auspicious. Perhaps this, as much as Armand’s politeness, is why they tolerate him. Hassan said that if he had better encryption facilities he might be able to recover more details—but then Hassan disappeared."|Fairyland|"Paul J. McAuley"

No, I’m sure I won’t need to. Be there a little before midnight; that’s when the gates are locked. And you know you can talk to me anytime,’ Dr Science adds, and favours Morag with a judicious, twinkling grin before striding off between the recharging vehicles, shouting to Gisele, his voice making echoes under the high roof."|Fairyland|"Paul J. McAuley"
00:00|Midnight|"Armand smiles, because he has puzzled the fat man. Drool leaks from the corners of his mouth, and he wipes it away with his sleeve. He says, ‘That’s where I was born. Chambéry. Midnight’s Child. That’s what Hassan said.’"|Fairyland|"Paul J. McAuley"
00:00|midnight|"At the Métro station, the homeless and the dispossessed are moving in to claim their space for the night. They are bedding down even as the last of the revellers stagger off the last train and hurry away up the stairs into the night. Unlike many major European cities, the Paris mass transit authority only allows the homeless in when the system closes down, at midnight. There are no permanent encampments in the Métro stations, so the paramedics and nurses of the clinic at the Place de la Concorde must necessarily work at night."|Fairyland|"Paul J. McAuley"
"~ 03:00"|"Around three in the morning"|"The first part of the shift is busy: that helps. Around three in the morning, when the clinic is at last empty, Louis retires to sleep on a trolley in a curtained-off corner. It is his habit to catch up on his sleep once the post-midnight rush is over, he tells Morag and Jules. He doesn’t expect to be disturbed except for a real emergency."|Fairyland|"Paul J. McAuley"
00:00|midnight|"They all rise around her and drink to this, they all sit down and drink some more. One of the other customers complains about the noise, and the proprietor tells the man to shut up or leave, this is in aid of a good friend. The man ends up joining the party, and so does everyone else in the bar. Michel Guidon plays jazz guitar, stumbling on the runs, while everyone claps time, and then Gisele Gabin sings several plaintive folk melodies. Somewhere in the middle of this, a taxi arrives for Morag. It’s close to midnight, she’s not the first to leave. She stumbles towards the door accompanied by the loud farewells of her friends."|Fairyland|"Paul J. McAuley"
00:00|Midnight|"‘He is a very confused individual. He remembers very little of his former life, but he told me that he was one of Midnight’s Children, born in Chambéry, on midnight January 1st 2000. I hacked into the town hall records. An Armand Puech was born there at the right time; the Foreign Legion has him missing in action in Djibouti. That’s all I know. Not much, I know, but he’ll surface again. I’m quite sure of that. He’s looking for you. You saw something, or they think you saw something.’"|Fairyland|"Paul J. McAuley"
05:10|"ten past five in the morning"|"The TV’s clock tells Armand it is ten past five in the morning. A holocube lights up when he touches it. He tilts it from face to face, and scenes come and go inside: a man smiles at him; the bright sunlit straws and ochres of a parched countryside; a house with a terracotta tile roof under a deep blue sky; a group of people standing on the roof of a tear-drop shaped runabout parked in the sun-speckled shade of a poplar tree. Fragments of a life. Armand holds the cube out to the fairy, who takes it and tosses it aside without looking at it."|Fairyland|"Paul J. McAuley"
"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"Katrina returns and says she put the little fucker to sleep. It is late, past midnight. Morag makes a nest of bubblewrap in a corner, pillows her head on her folded coat. She falls into a light, uneasy sleep, waking from bad dreams to the half-light of the biolumes, the low mutter of conversation elsewhere in the room. The swags of cable seem ominously like snakes, the random pinhole speckles in the ceiling tiles a movement away from making some kind of sense, but Morag falls asleep again before they do."|Fairyland|"Paul J.

Half a kilometre beyond is a bunker, half-buried behind a berm and capped with a ceramic blast shield like a bleached tortoise shell. A mast studded with microwave relay dishes rises above the trees that grow right up to the border fence. A few refugees are camping there, and naked children chase around the jeeps when they draw up at the steel gates. Alex buys a carton of Coke from an old woman and tries to pay no attention to the handful of Nationalist soldiers who amble out of the bunker. No one seems to be in charge. One soldier barely glances at the sheaf of IDs the team commander offers; another unlocks the gates; the two jeeps are waved through."|Fairyland|"Paul J. McAuley"
