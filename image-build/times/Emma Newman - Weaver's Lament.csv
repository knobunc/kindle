"< 20:00"|"almost eight o’clock in the evening"|"The yard was empty and it was almost eight o’clock in the evening. She was tired from the journey and feeling horribly out of sorts. She was wearing an old cotton dress that Ben had given her, with a rather threadbare underdress that had seen better days. She’d changed in an empty worker’s cottage nearby which Ben had taken her to after they’d dined together. When she first saw the clothes, she’d refused to wear them; with the ground-in dirt around the hem and cuffs and stains in the armpits of the underdress, she’d thought they were unwashed. They’d argued, Ben explaining that they were simply stained, rather than dirty, and needed to look used so she wouldn’t stick out like a sore thumb. She couldn’t deny that her hooped crinoline would be the most ridiculous thing to turn up in. She’d given in after reminding herself not to be unreasonable when her brother’s freedom—and possibly his life—were at stake."|"Weaver's Lament"|"Emma Newman"
"ap 05:00"|five|"Mags steered her through the process of being confirmed as a new employee, taking her to the “right people to ’ave the right things written in the right books,” as she put it. Her first shift started at five the following morning. It had been a while since she’d been up that early. Since moving house, Charlotte hadn’t had to get up to light the stove. She had a new appreciation for the maid her mother had hired."|"Weaver's Lament"|"Emma Newman"
"ap 08:00"|"Eight o’clock"|"Mags gave her a strange look. “Eight o’clock. You saw us all comin’ out, didn’t yer?”"|"Weaver's Lament"|"Emma Newman"
00:00|midnight|"WHEN THE BELL RANG to rouse the workers from their rest, Charlotte groaned. She’d lain awake most of the night, listening to the snoring and coughing and creaking beds of the other women around her. When she’d heard the chimes of the clock tower bells at midnight, she wondered where Hopkins was and what he would have to say about this. None of the imagined comments were very nice."|"Weaver's Lament"|"Emma Newman"
"ap > 11:00"|"a few minutes after eleven"|"There were no rules about having to stay within the mill complex, but the gates were locked a few minutes after eleven bells. She walked as quickly as her aching legs allowed. She wasn’t the only one heading out, to her relief. It felt strange, going out without a proper bonnet, so she’d tied her shawl under her chin, making her look like a washer woman. She didn’t care. At least the red mark on her cheek was hidden."|"Weaver's Lament"|"Emma Newman"
00:00|midnight|"The sound of the midnight bells made her sigh. She had to be up in four and a half hours. She rolled over and despite the coughing and snoring of her neighbours, Charlotte finally fell asleep."|"Weaver's Lament"|"Emma Newman"
