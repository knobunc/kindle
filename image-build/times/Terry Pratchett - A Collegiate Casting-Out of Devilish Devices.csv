"ap 03:30"|"half-past  three"|"It was a Thursday afternoon. The col ege council of the Unseen University, Discworld's  oldest  and  most  venerable  school  of  wizardry,  liked  their Thursday afternoon meetings. The council chamber, with its stained-glass image  of  'Archchancel or  Sloman  Discovering  the  Special  Theory  of Slood', was always nice and warm and there was a distant prospect of tea and  chocolate  biscuits  at  half-past  three.  Pointy  hats  nodded  as  the agenda was demolished with due mendacity and sleepy prevarication."|"A Collegiate Casting-Out of Devilish Devices"|"Terry Pratchett"
