"~ 03:00"|"about three in the morning"|"It was now about three in the morning, if his sense of time was good. He had no watch but meant to get one, since he was now in a world where the precise measurement of time was important."|"Behind Walls Terra"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"""You might be right,"" Kickaha said. ""But I can't afford to take the chance. No, you tell your boss something. You tell him that I'm not out to get him; I'm not a Lord. I just want to find another Lord and his woman, who came to this world to escape from the Black Bellers. In fact, I'll tell you who that Lord is. It's Jadawin. Maybe your boss will remember him. It's Jadawin, who's changed very much. Jadawin isn't interested in challenging your boss; he could care less. All he wants to do is get back to his own world. You tell him that, though I doubt it'll do any good. I'll call your home tomorrow about noon, so you can relay more of what I have to say to your boss. I'll call your home. Your boss might want to be there so he can talk to me directly."""|"Behind Walls Terra"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"He got up at ten. Anana was sleeping soundly. After shaving and showering, he woke her long enough to tell her what he planned. He went across the street to a restaurant, ate a big breakfast, bought a paper, and then returned to the room. Anana was still sleeping. He called the Los Angeles Times ad department and dictated an item for the personal column. He gave as his address the motel and also gave a fictitious name. He had thought about using Ramos' name in case the Times man checked out the address. But he did not want any tie between the ad and Cambring, if he could help it. He promised to send his check immediately, and then, hanging up, forgot about it."|"Behind Walls Terra"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
12:00|noon|"At noon, after eating half a hamburger and a glass of milk, he called Cambring. He was at a restaurant only a few blocks from the meeting place. Cambring answered again before the phone had finished its third ring. Kickaha told him where he was to meet him and under what conditions."|"Behind Walls Terra"|"Philip Jose Farmer"

"ap 08:30"|"eight thirty"|"It was eight thirty. They were to meet Wolff at nine at Stats Restaurant on Wilshire and San Vicente. If they took a taxi, they could get there with plenty of time to spare. He decided they should walk. He did not trust the taxis. And while he would use them if he had to, he saw no reason to take one just to avoid a walk. Especially since they needed the exercise."|"Behind Walls Terra"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o'clock"|"It was still not quite nine o'clock, however, and Wolff might be approaching cautiously."|"Behind Walls Terra"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
"ap 09:45"|"quarter to ten"|"A half hour passed. More customers arrived and more left. None of them could be his friends. At a quarter to ten, the two policemen left."|"Behind Walls Terra"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
"ap ~ 08:00"|"about eight o'clock"|"He took another taxi to the Sunset and Fairfax area. He awoke about eight o'clock on an old mattress on the bare floor of a big moldy room. Beside him slept Rod (short for Rodriga). Rodriga Elseed, as she called herself, was a tall thin girl with remarkably large breasts, a pretty but overfreckled face, big dark-blue eyes, and lank yellow-brown hair that fell to her waist. She was wearing a red-and-blue checked lumberman's shirt, dirty bellbottoms, and torn moccasins. Her teeth were white and even, but her breath reeked of too little food and too much marijuana."|"Behind Walls Terra"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
12:00|"high noon"|"When he awoke, the room was as before. The sourceless light still made it high noon, and the air had not changed temperature. However, on sitting up, he saw a tray with dishes and cups and table utensils on top of the small thin-legged wooden table at the end of the sofa. He did not think that anyone could have entered with it unless he had been drugged. It seemed more likely that a gate was embedded in the wooden top and that a tray had been gated through while he slept."|"Behind Walls Terra"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
00:00|midnight|"Orc was satisfied, and by this Kickaha knew that the truth drug was still effective. Orc stood up and said, ""I'll prepare things for you. It will take some time, so you might as well rest or do whatever you think best. We'll go into action at midnight tonight."""|"Behind Walls Terra"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
12:00|noon|"It was daylight outside, but the light was pale, though it was noon. The sun was smaller than Earth's, and the sky was black. The earth itself was rocky with some stretches of reddish sand, and there were a few widely separated cactus-looking plants on the slope and in the valley. They seemed small, but he realized after a while that they must be enormous."|"Behind Walls Terra"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
