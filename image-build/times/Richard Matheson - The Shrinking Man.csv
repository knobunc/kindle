"ap ~ 08:00"|"About eight"|"“I said, did you have breakfast?”
“Oh. Yes. About eight, I guess.”
“Are you hungry? Shall I stop?”"|"The Shrinking Man"|"Richard Matheson"
"ap ~ 11:00"|"about eleven o’clock"|"It was quiet in the cellar. The oil burner had just shut itself off, the clanking wheeze of the water pump had been silenced for an hour. He lay under the cardboard box top listening to the silence, exhausted but unable to rest. An animal life without an animal mind did not induce the heavy, effortless sleep of an animal.
The spider came about eleven o’clock.
He didn’t know it was eleven, but there was still the heavy thudding of footsteps overhead, and he knew Lou was usually in bed by midnight."|"The Shrinking Man"|"Richard Matheson"

"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"It was afternoon; he had slept. Rays of sunlight were visible through the window over the log pile, the window that faced south. Two, three o’clock, he estimated. Another day was half gone; more than half."|"The Shrinking Man"|"Richard Matheson"
12:00|noon|"He groaned. He got up and paced around. He stared at the rain and the mud-spattered windows. What time was it? Couldn’t be more than noon. He couldn’t take this much longer."|"The Shrinking Man"|"Richard Matheson"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"Days kept passing. Reading was almost forgotten. Life had become one unending morbid adventure. Almost every afternoon at two o’clock, after having sat in shaking excitement for an hour or more, he would crawl out into the yard and walk secretively around the house, climbing up and peering over the sills of every window, looking for Catherine."|"The Shrinking Man"|"Richard Matheson"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"In the mornings he would eat hastily and go down to the cellar for the long wait until two o’clock, when, heart pounding, he would crawl out through the window again to spy."|"The Shrinking Man"|"Richard Matheson"
12:00|noon|"By noon, all the furniture was in place. He’d had Lou push the house against the wall behind the couch so he could have the privacy as well as the protection of four walls. Beth, on strict orders, did not approach him, but occasionally the cat got into the house, and then there was danger."|"The Shrinking Man"|"Richard Matheson"
"~ 01:00"|"about one in the morning"|"So he’d sat in the waiting room, feeling as if there were a bomb in his stomach, primed to explode shortly. There was one other man there, but it was his fourth baby and he was blasé. He actually read a book: The Curse of the Conquistadores. Scott still remembered the title. How could a man sit reading such a book when his wife was writhing and twisting in labor? Or maybe his wife was one of the easy deliverers. As a matter of fact, the man couldn’t have read more than three chapters before the baby was born, about one in the morning. The man had shrugged, winked at Scott, and gone home. Scott had cursed softly after him, then sat alone in the waiting room, waiting."|"The Shrinking Man"|"Richard Matheson"

At seven-one A.M., Elizabeth Louise had put in her appearance.
He remembered Dr. Arron coming out of the delivery room and starting down the hall toward him, soft-soled shoes squeaking on the tiles. A dozen different horrors had pulsed through Scott’s brain. She’s dead. The baby’s dead. It’s misshapen. It’s twins. It’s triplets. There was nothing in there."|"The Shrinking Man"|"Richard Matheson"
