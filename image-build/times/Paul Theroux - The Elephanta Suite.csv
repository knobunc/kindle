00:00|midnight|"They had arrived in the dark smoky midnight at Mumbai Airport and had been driven swiftly past lamp-lit shacks—a vision of fires, of torches—on the way to the brilliantly lit hotel, where they stayed in the Elephanta Suite—Audie intoned the name printed over the carved doorway. They had slept well, waking at dawn to be driven to the airport for the one-hour flight, after which they had been met by a driver in a white uniform holding a signboard lettered Belondon in one hand and a platter of chilled face towels in the other."|"The Elephanta Suite"|"Paul Theroux"
"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"But when, around noon, there was a break in their routine, they were disturbed."|"The Elephanta Suite"|"Paul Theroux"
"ap 01:00"|one|"Dr. Nagaraj had tucked a message under their door requesting a meeting at one o'clock in his office. He had never written before; his handwriting was black and severe and intimidating; and one o'clock was their lunch hour."|"The Elephanta Suite"|"Paul Theroux"

"ap 06:30"|six-thirty|"Had Beth not announced that she was getting an evening treatment, he would not have come. But impulsively he had called Anna's cell phone and, as though expecting his call, she'd given him explicit directions, saying that she would meet him at six-thirty. She'd chosen sundown, but even at sundown there was leftover light, and this was the reason he gave for her being late."|"The Elephanta Suite"|"Paul Theroux"
"ap 04:00"|four|"They had a nap by the pool, in the shade of the overhanging trees, and at four, yawning, they made their way back up the slope for the formality of requesting another week."|"The Elephanta Suite"|"Paul Theroux"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"""Departure time tomorrow morning time is eleven, sir. Bags will be picked up. Car will be waiting."""|"The Elephanta Suite"|"Paul Theroux"
16:00|"four in the afternoon"|"But if I were so busy, he thought, why would I be swigging a Thums Up and sauntering along this seafront, yapping to this woman at four in the afternoon? And he knew she had detected the same idleness in him."|"The Elephanta Suite"|"Paul Theroux"
"ap 02:00"|two|"That was the second, the transformative trip. He left that night, or rather at two the next morning, a changed man. Or was he changed? Perhaps these impulses had always slumbered in him and now India had wakened them, allowing him to act."|"The Elephanta Suite"|"Paul Theroux"
"ap 03:00"|three|"""It might mean two weeks of back-to-back meetings.""
""Make it three. Less pressure."" And Dwight spoke of strategy.
""Hunt, you're amazing."""|"The Elephanta Suite"|"Paul Theroux"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"It was two in the morning. This odor of dust and diesel, woodsmoke, decay, industrial fumes and flowers, and the odor of humans, the complex smell of India—he had never been anywhere that smelled like this. This dense cloud contained the hum of India's history, too—conquerors, burnings, blood, the incense of religion. It was less a whiff than a wall of smell."|"The Elephanta Suite"|"Paul Theroux"
"ap 08:30"|Eight-thirty|"""Back-to-back meetings,"" Shah said. Kohut's expression—they must have been talking. Shah was an element of the firm now. ""When's the first one?""
""Eight-thirty, and so on into the day,"" Shah said.
""Okay."" Dwight thought: At least I'm here."|"The Elephanta Suite"|"Paul Theroux"
02:00|"two A.M."|"This finicky urgency, this tenacity, set Shah apart—perhaps set Indians apart. It was another aspect of the obsession with detail. Dwight had arrived at two A.M., he'd hardly slept, the meetings had gone on all day; now it was almost six in the evening and Shah was insisting on this further event."|"The Elephanta Suite"|"Paul Theroux"

00:00|midnight|"All this time—negotiating for the release of the shipment of rice, moving it from Bhiwandi to a secure facility nearer the railway junction at Kalyan, following Shah's specific instructions—Dwight had the feeling he was working for Shah. And what he was doing any office manager could have done—Manoj Verma, Dinesh Patel, Sarojini Dasgupta, Miss Chakravarti, any of them. The other, better question was: What did a consignment of rice have to do with client business? Agricultural products had never been a priority. Five days of this bafflement went by without his setting eyes on Shah. Maybe he was at home, in his lovely apartment, dining off his porcelain?
The phone rang at midnight.

"ap 08:00"|"eight o'clock"|"Anyone's watchfulness slightly unnerved her, but she also admired this man's. He was a fast learner. He would get the job.

"ap 01:00"|one|"After the solitude and order of the ashram, the street—and this was right outside, just over the wall—was startling in its dirt and disorder, the hawkers crowded against the wall of the ashram, people seated at small tables selling picture frames and pens and cheap watches and hair ornaments. It was a relief to see someone selling fresh flowers, a pile of marigold blossoms, but the rest of it was a bazaar of cheap merchandise. The shops that lined the road sold rubber tires and shoes and clocks and sacks of beans and rice and spices. At one storefront a man was mending shoes, at another a boy was on his knees, his forearms streaked with grease, laboring to fix a bike. The large number of pedestrians made it hard for Alice to walk, and when she dodged them to buy a bag of roasted chickpeas, cars honked at her. She thought of turning back, yet she had to make the call."|"The Elephanta Suite"|"Paul Theroux"
