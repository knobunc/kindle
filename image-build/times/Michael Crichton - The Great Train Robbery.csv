19:14|1914|"Alderston's  single  vice  was  a  passion  for  card  games, acquired  during  his  army  days,  and  his  outstanding eccentricity  was  that  he  refused  to  gamble  for  money, preferring  to  wager  personal  articles  and  belongings instead  of  hard  cash.  Apparently  this  was  his  way  of viewing card-playing as a gentlemanly pastime, and not a vice.  The  story  of  his  crate  of  wine,  which  figures  so prominently  in  The  Great  Train  Robbery  of  1855,  never came  to  light  until  1914,  some  forty  years  after Alderston's death.
