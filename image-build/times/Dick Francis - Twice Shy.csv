"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"The lesson wound on. They would remember it all their lives, because of the gun. Without the gun, whatever Jenkins might think, it would have faded into the general dust they shook from their shoes every afternoon at four o’clock.  Teaching, it often seemed to me, was as much a matter of imagery as of imparting actual information. The facts dressed up in jokes were the ones they got right in exams."|"Twice Shy"|"Dick Francis"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"“Well.” I sighed. “I’ll make a start on the books, then.”
She nodded faintly. “Supper at seven.”
“All right.”"|"Twice Shy"|"Dick Francis"
"ap 09:00"|"Nine o’clock"|"“Well, of course . . . of course, we will . . . Oh, Peter, yes, of course . . . Yes, straight away. Yes . . . yes . . . we’ll be there ...” She glanced at her watch. “Nine o’clock. Perhaps a bit later. Will that do? All right then . . . and Peter, give her my love.”"|"Twice Shy"|"Dick Francis"
"ap ~ 08:00"|"About eight o’clock"|"He interrupted, “Yes, I know, but they were so bloody  frightening. They came the day before yesterday—it seems years ago—in the evening. Donna had gone out for a walk. It was still light. About eight o’clock, I should think. She often goes for walks ...” He trailed off again and I gave his glass a nudge with the bottle. “What?” he said. “Oh no, no more, thanks. Anyway, they came, and they were so  arrogant, and they said I’d regret it if I didn’t give them the programs. They said Donna was a pretty little missis, wasn’t she, and they were sure I’d like her to stay that way.” He swallowed. “I’d never have believed . . . I mean, that sort of thing doesn’t happen.”"|"Twice Shy"|"Dick Francis"
00:00|midnight|"I screwed the cap onto the bottle and I looked at my watch. “It’s getting on for midnight,” I said. “We’d better go back.”"|"Twice Shy"|"Dick Francis"
"ap 04:00"|four|"“Can’t promise it will be today,” he said. “I’ve got classes all afternoon and Jenkins wants to see me at four.” He grimaced. “Jenkins. Why can’t we call him Ralph and be done with it.”"|"Twice Shy"|"Dick Francis"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"Duty took me back to Bisley the following day: duty and restlessness and dreadful prospects on the box. I shot better and thought less about Peter, and when the light began to fade I went home and corrected the ever-recurring exercise books: and on Monday Ted Pitts said he hadn’t yet done anything about my computer tapes but that if I cared to stay on at four o’clock we could both go down to the computer room and see what there was to see."|"Twice Shy"|"Dick Francis"
"ap 06:00"|six|"“All right then,” he said judiciously. “I finish here at six. I’ll meet you in the Purple Dragon, right? Up the lane, turn left, quarter of a mile. You buy me a couple of pints and we’ll take it from there. OK?”"|"Twice Shy"|"Dick Francis"
"ap 06:15"|six-fifteen|"I waited for him at a table in the Purple Dragon, a pub a good deal less colorful than its name, and at six-fifteen he appeared, dressed now in gray trousers and a blue-and-white shirt straining at its buttons. Elliptical views of hairy chest appeared when he sat down, which he did with a wheeze and a licking of lips. The first pint I bought him disappeared at a single draught, closely followed by half of the second."|"Twice Shy"|"Dick Francis"
08:00|"eight in the morning"|"At eight in the morning when I was juggling coffee and toast the telephone rang again, and this time it was the police. A London accent, very polite."|"Twice Shy"|"Dick Francis"
"ap 04:30"|four-thirty|"School, he agreed, was unavoidable. He would come to my house in Twickenham at four-thirty."|"Twice Shy"|"Dick Francis"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"“If I call you at nine tomorrow morning,” I said, “will Chief Superintendent Irestone be there? If I call at ten? At eleven? At midday?”"|"Twice Shy"|"Dick Francis"

"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"I was told to wait and could hear vague conversations going on in the background, and going on for so long that I had to feed more coins into the box, which scarcely improved my impatience. Finally, however, the stolid voice returned. “Detective Chief Superintendent Irestone will be in the Incident Room tomorrow morning from ten o’clock  onward. You may call him at the following number.”"|"Twice Shy"|"Dick Francis"
"ap 10:33"|"ten thirty-three"|"I felt like leaving a couple of round oaths. I said, “Tell him Jonathan Derry called.”
“Very good, sir. Your message timed at ten thirty-three.”
To hell with it, I thought."|"Twice Shy"|"Dick Francis"
"ap 00:15"|twelve-fifteen|"I couldn’t get them until I could find Ted Pitts, which would probably not be until lunchtime at twelve-fifteen. I had an hour and a half until then in which to decide what to do."|"Twice Shy"|"Dick Francis"
"ap 04:30"|four-thirty|"Propelled by demons I did the trip in a shorter time than usual, but it was still four-thirty when I reached the city outskirts. Six hours since Angelo had telephoned. Six long hours for his hostages."|"Twice Shy"|"Dick Francis"
07:00|"seven in the morning"|"We stayed in a motel on the outskirts of London and slept as if dead. The alarm call I’d asked for dragged me from this limbo at seven in the morning, and yawning like a great white shark I got through to the number Inspector Robson had given me."|"Twice Shy"|"Dick Francis"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"I put the receiver down with a steadily lightening heart and shook Sarah awake in the next bed.
“Sorry,” I said. “But I’ve got to be in school by nine o’clock.”"|"Twice Shy"|"Dick Francis"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"She walked to the bathroom to turn on the taps and came back brushing her teeth.
“It’s seven o’clock,” she said.
“So I’ve noticed.”"|"Twice Shy"|"Dick Francis"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"In the event it was only I who returned. I sat with Cassie through the long wait in the silent hospital while they tried to find someone to X-ray her arm, but it seemed that after midnight the radiology department was firmly shut, with all the radiologists asleep in their own homes, and only the direst surgical emergency would recall them."|"Twice Shy"|"Dick Francis"
"ap 05:00"|"Five o’clock"|"I looked at my watch. Five o’clock. Soon be light. Soon be Friday with all its problems. “I guess,” I said yawning, “that a couple of hours shut-eye would do no harm.”"|"Twice Shy"|"Dick Francis"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"Bananas walked home to his dishwasher and I took his place on the sofa, feeling the bedroom too far away, out of touch. Despite the hectic night I went to sleep immediately and woke with mind-protesting reluctance to switch off the alarm clock at seven o’clock. The horses would be working on the Heath. Simpson Shell had set up a trial of two late-developing three-year-olds, and if I wasn’t there to watch he’d be writing to Luke Houston to say I was a shirker. And I wanted anyway, Angelo or no Angelo, to see how those horses went."|"Twice Shy"|"Dick Francis"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"“Here’s your watch.” I had slipped it off his wrist the evening before to make the tying easier. I took it out of my pocket and put it on the floor near his head. “Lights out tonight at eleven,” I said."|"Twice Shy"|"Dick Francis"
18:00|"six that evening"|"Cassie, I was told, would be having her arm set under anesthetic during the morning. I could collect her at six that evening if all went well."|"Twice Shy"|"Dick Francis"
"ap 06:00"|six|"“Sure is. My body’s floating but my brain’s fizzing along in zillions of sparks. It’s weird.”
“They say I can fetch you at six.”
“Don’t . . . be late.”"|"Twice Shy"|"Dick Francis"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"“He was up by the door swearing at four o’clock.” Bananas looked at his watch. “Nine and a half hours ago. I shouted at him to shut up.”"|"Twice Shy"|"Dick Francis"
"ap 08:30"|eight-thirty|"She swallowed. I kissed her and drove away, burning up the empty Sunday-early roads to Mill Hill. It was still only eight-thirty when I turned into Oaklands Road, the very earliest that Jane Pitts had said I could arrive, but she was already up and in a wet bathing suit to answer the doorbell."|"Twice Shy"|"Dick Francis"
00:00|midnight|"We went back, however, to drink and eat with Bananas, and from there to the cottage, where I sent off a Telex to Luke, for whom our midnight was three in the afternoon."|"Twice Shy"|"Dick Francis"
15:00|"three in the afternoon"|"We went back, however, to drink and eat with Bananas, and from there to the cottage, where I sent off a Telex to Luke, for whom our midnight was three in the afternoon."|"Twice Shy"|"Dick Francis"
06:00|"six in the morning"|"Luke liked Telexes. If he wanted to discuss what I’d sent, he would telephone after his evening dinner, catching me at six in the morning before I left for the gallops, but more normally he would reply by Telex or not at all."|"Twice Shy"|"Dick Francis"
10:00|"ten in the morning"|"“Well, now, if you get me that little colt I’ll write again and say I was wrong.” He nodded heavily and half fell off the bar stool. He was never drunk on the gallops or at the races or indeed by the sale ring itself, but at all other times . . . probably. The owners didn’t seem to mind and nor did the horses: drunk or sober Donavan produced as many winners year by year as anyone in Ireland. I didn’t like or dislike him. I did business with him before ten in the morning and listened intently in the evenings, the time when through clouds of whisky he spoke the truth. Many thought him uncouth, and so he was. Many thought Luke would have chosen a smoother man with tidier social manners, but perhaps Luke had seen and heard Donavan’s intimate way with horses, as I now had, and preferred the priceless goods to a gaudier package. I had come to respect Donavan. Two solid days of his company were quite enough."|"Twice Shy"|"Dick Francis"
"ap 00:55"|"five to one"|"“Everyone else is at five to one.” His voice was a growl which I knew all too well."|"Twice Shy"|"Dick Francis"
"ap 07:30"|seven-thirty|"The Hansel colt from Wexford was due to be sold at the prime time of seven-thirty on the Wednesday evening, and by seven the high-rising banks of seats of the sale ring were invisible under a sea of bodies, Cassie somewhere among them. Down near the floor in the pen reserved for probable bidders Donavan was breathing heavily at my elbow as he had been all afternoon, determinedly sober and all the gloomier for it."|"Twice Shy"|"Dick Francis"
"ap 02:50"|"TWO FIFTY"|"REGRET UNDERBIDDER AT EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND POUNDS EXCLUDING TAX FOR HANSEL COLT. DONAVAN’S DEADLY RIVAL MICK O’FLAHERTY SUCCESSFUL AT EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY-SIX THOUSAND TWO FIFTY. DONAVAN FURIOUS, SACK ME IF YOU LIKE. REGARDS, WILLIAM."|"Twice Shy"|"Dick Francis"
"ap 05:00"|five|"His voice came back in the familiar bass register. “If I’m still losing by five tomorrow I’ll know you’ve conned me. And I’ll come after you. That’s a promise.”"|"Twice Shy"|"Dick Francis"
"ap 00:48"|"TWELVE TO ONE"|"YES.
IS HORSE QUOTED ANTE-POST AT TWELVE TO ONE OR LESS?
YES."|"Twice Shy"|"Dick Francis"
"ap 03:30"|Three-thirty|"I loaded GOOD and sorted through five races. All the top scorers were horses which in the events had finished no nearer than second.
“Are you hungry?” Ruth said. “Three-thirty. Sandwich?”
I thanked her and went into her small kitchen where I was interested to see that her speed stopped short of dexterity with slicing tomatoes. She quite slowly for her made fat juicy affairs of cheese, chutney, tomatoes and corned beef which toppled precariously on the plate and had to be held in both hands for eating."|"Twice Shy"|"Dick Francis"
09:00|"nine in the morning"|"I thought back and shook my head. “It was before nine in the morning when I went to the Pitts’ house. That would make it about one A.M. in California. Even if he had his number, which I doubt, I don’t think he would have telephoned Jonathan in the middle of the night. And Jonathan anyway sounded truly disappointed when I told him I’d given Angelo the tapes. No, Ted must have done it for his own reasons, and by himself.”"|"Twice Shy"|"Dick Francis"
