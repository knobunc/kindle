"< 00:00"|"before midnight"|"Dona stared moodily out of the window, her chin cupped in her hands. The children were still asleep, that was one blessing, and even Prue, their nurse, her mouth open and her face flushed, had not stirred for two hours or more. Poor Henrietta had been sick for the fourth time, and now lay pale and wan, a tiny edition of Harry, her golden head against the nurse’s shoulder. James never stirred; his was the true deep sleep of babyhood, he would not wake perhaps until they reached their destination. And then—what pitiful anticlimax awaited them! Damp beds no doubt, and closed shutters, the moldy, stifling smell of unused rooms, the irritation of surprised, disgruntled servants. And all because of an impulse blindly obeyed, a sudden boiling up of resentment against the futility of her life, those endless suppers, dinners, card-parties, those foolish pranks worthy only of an apprentice boy on holiday, that stupid flirtation with Rockingham, and Harry himself, so lazy, so easy-going, fulfilling too well the part of perfect husband with his tolerance, his yawn before midnight, his placid and sleepy adoration. This sense of futility had been growing upon her for many months, nagging at her now and again like dormant toothache, but it had taken Friday night to arouse in her that full sense of self-loathing and exasperation, and because of Friday night she was jolting backwards and forwards now in this damnable coach, bound on a ridiculous journey to a house she had seen once in her life and knew nothing about, carrying with her, in anger and irritation, the two surprised children and their reluctant nurse."|"Frenchman's Creek"|"Daphne Du Maurier"

Now she could live without a plan, without a decision, taking the days as they came, rising at noon if she had the mind or at six in the morning, it did not matter, eating when hunger came upon her, sleeping when she wished, in the day or at midnight. Her mood was one of lovely laziness. She would lie out in her garden hour after hour, her hands behind her head, watching the butterflies as they frolicked in the sun, and chased one another, and had their moment; listening to the birds intent upon domestic life among the branches, so busy, so ardent, like newly-wed couples proud of their first home polished as a pin. And all the while the bright sun shone down upon her, and little mackerel clouds scurried across the sky, and away in the valley beneath the woods there was the river, the river which she had not found yet, because she was too idle, because there was so much time; one day, quite soon, she would go down to it, early one morning, and stand in the shallows barefoot and let the water splash upon her, and smell the muddied river smell, pungent and sweet."|"Frenchman's Creek"|"Daphne Du Maurier"

How slow they must be, how inefficient. Surely if they kept a watch, were constantly on the alert, it would be possible to lay some trap for the foreigner as he crept into their harbors. A ship was not a phantom thing, it depended on wind and tide, nor were men soundless, their feet must echo on the quays, their voices fall upon the air. That day she dined early, at six, and talked to William as he stood behind her chair, bidding him close the door to visitors in future."|"Frenchman's Creek"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"> 00:00"|"just after midnight"|"She went to bed as soon as she returned, for the walk had tired her, and she fell asleep almost at once, in spite of the curtains drawn wide, and the shining moon. And then, just after midnight it must have been, for subconsciously she had heard the stable clock strike the hour, she was awake, aware of a footstep that had crunched the gravel beneath her window. She was instantly alert, the household should be sleeping at such an hour, she was suspicious of footsteps in the night. She rose from bed then, and went to the casement, and looked out into the garden. She could see nothing beneath her, the house was in shadow, and whoever had stood there, beneath the casement, must have passed on. She waited and watched, and suddenly, from the belt of trees beyond the lawn, a figure stole into a square patch of moonlight and looked up towards the house. She saw him cup his hands to his mouth and give a soft low whistle. At once another figure crept out from the shadowed house, he must have been sheltering just inside the window of the salon, and this second figure ran swiftly across the lawn to the man by the belt of trees, his hand raised as though in warning, and she saw that the running figure was William. Dona leaned forward, screened by the curtain, her ringlets falling over her face, and she breathed quicker than usual, and her heart beat fast, for there was excitement in what she saw, there was danger—her fingers beat a little nameless tune upon the sill. The two men stood together in the patch of moonlight, and Dona saw William gesticulate with his hands, and point towards the house, at which she drew back into the shadow for fear of being observed. The two continued talking, the strange man looking upward at the house also, and presently he shrugged his shoulders, spreading out his hands, as though the matter were beyond his powers of settlement, and then they both withdrew into the belt of trees, and disappeared. Dona waited, and listened, but they did not return. Then she shivered, for the breeze was cool blowing upon her thin nightgown, and she returned to bed, but could not sleep, for this new departure of William’s was a mystery that must be solved."|"Frenchman's Creek"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
00:00|midnight|"Had she seen him walk by moonlight into the trees, alone, she would have thought little of it, there might have been a woman in Helford hamlet by the river who was not unpleasing to him, or his silent expedition might have been more innocent still, a moth-hunt at midnight. But that stealthy tread, as though he waited for a signal, and that dark figure with his cupped hands and the soft whistle, William’s run across the lawn with his warning hand, these were graver problems, giving cause for worry."|"Frenchman's Creek"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"She folded the letter, and sealed it. Now she was free once more, and began to think how she could rid herself of William for the afternoon, for she wished him well away before she started on her expedition. At one o’clock, over her cold meat, she knew how she would do it."|"Frenchman's Creek"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
12:00|noonday|"She followed the track that she had found in the morning, but this time plunging down deep into the woods without hesitation. The birds were astir again, after their noonday silence, and the silent butterflies danced and fluttered, while drowsy bumblebees hummed in the warm air, winging their way to the topmost branches of the trees. Yes, there once again was the glimmer of water that had surprised her. The trees were thinning, she was coming to the bank—and there, suddenly before her for the first time, was the creek, still and soundless, shrouded by the trees, hidden from the eyes of men. She stared at it in wonder, for she had had no knowledge of its existence, this stealthy branch of the parent river creeping into her own property, so sheltered, so concealed by the woods themselves. The tide was ebbing, the water oozing away from the mud flats, and here where she stood was the head of the creek itself, for the stream ended in a trickle, and the trickle in a spring. The creek twisted round a belt of trees, and she began to walk along the bank, happy, fascinated, forgetting her mission, for this discovery was a pleasure quite unexpected, this creek was a source of enchantment, a new escape, better than Navron itself, a place to drowse and sleep, a lotus-land. There was a heron, standing in the shallows, solemn and gray, his head sunk in his hooded shoulders, and beyond him a little oyster-catcher pattered in the mud, and then, weird and lovely, a curlew called, and rising from the bank, flew away from her down the creek. Something, not herself, disturbed the birds, for the heron rose slowly, flapping his slow wings, and followed the curlew, and Dona paused a moment, for she too had heard a sound, a sound of tapping, of hammering."|"Frenchman's Creek"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"“No,” she said, “that is for Lord Godolphin and the gentry. Pirates do not call upon ladies in the afternoon. They come stealthily, by night, knocking upon a window—and the lady of the manor, fearful for her safety, gives him supper, by candlelight.”
“As you will,” he said, “tomorrow then, at ten o’clock?”
“Yes,” she said."|"Frenchman's Creek"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"“Thank you, William.” She paused a moment, pretending to arrange the sprigs of lilac in their vase, and then, “Oh, William, before I forget. I am giving a small supper party tomorrow night. The hour is rather late, ten o’clock.”"|"Frenchman's Creek"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
12:00|noon|"“What are we going to eat?” she said, and he shook his head, he would not tell. “Rest easy, my lady,” he said, “I will not disappoint you,” and she went out into the garden once more, singing, her heart absurdly gay. The hot noon passed, hazy with the high east wind, and the long hours of afternoon, and tea with the children under the mulberry tree, and so round to early evening once again, and their bedtime, and a ceasing of the wind, while the sun set, the sky glowed, and the first stars shone."|"Frenchman's Creek"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"“He will not notice,” she thought, “he is not that sort of person, he does not care about women, or their clothes, or their jewels,” and yet she found herself dressing with great care, combing her ringlets round her fingers and setting them behind her ears. Suddenly she heard the stable clock strike ten, and in a panic she laid the comb aside, and went downstairs. The staircase led direct into the dining-hall, and she saw that William had lighted every candle, even as she had told him, and the bright silver shone on the long table. William himself was standing there, arranging dishes on the sideboard, and she went to see what it was he had prepared. Then she smiled. “Oh, William, now I know why you went down to Helford this afternoon, returning with a basket.” For there on the sideboard was crab, dressed and prepared in the French fashion, and there were small new potatoes too, cooked in their skins, and a fresh green salad sprinkled with garlic, and tiny scarlet radishes. He had found time too to make pastry. Thin, narrow wafers, interlaid with cream, while next to them, alone in a glass bowl, was a gathering of the first wild strawberries of the year."|"Frenchman's Creek"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap > 10:00"|"shortly after ten o’clock"|"“Very good, my lady.”

"ap 03:45"|"quarter to four"|"It was William who awoke her, William shaking her arm and whispering in her ear. “Forgive me, my lady, but Monsieur has just sent word, the ship sails within the hour.” Dona sat up in bed at once, all wish for sleep vanishing with his words, and “Thank you, William,” she said, “I shall be ready in twenty minutes’ time. What hour is it?”
“A quarter to four, my lady.”
He left the room, and Dona, pulling aside the curtains, saw that it was yet dark, the white dawn had not broken. She began to dress hurriedly, her heart beating with excitement and her hands unnaturally clumsy, feeling all the while like a naughty child proceeding to a forbidden venture. It was five days since she had supped with the Frenchman in the creek, and she had not seen him since. Instinct had told her that when he worked he would be alone, and she had let the days go by without walking through the woods to the river, without sending messages even by William, for she knew that when he had laid his plans he would send for her. The wager was not a momentary thing of folly, broached on a summer’s night and forgotten before morning, it was a pact by which he would abide, a testing of her strength, a challenge to her courage. Sometimes she thought of Harry, continuing with his life in London, his riding, his gaming, the visits to the taverns, the play-houses, the card-parties with Rockingham, and the images she conjured seemed to her those of another world, a world which concerned her not at all. It belonged, in its strange fashion, to a past that was dead and gone, while Harry himself had become a kind of ghost, a phantom figure walking in another time."|"Frenchman's Creek"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 04:00"|four|"The clock in the courtyard struck four, and the new Dona, in an old gown long laid aside to be bestowed upon a cottager, with a shawl about her shoulders, and a bundle in her hands, crept down the stairway to the dining hall, where William awaited her, a taper in his hand."|"Frenchman's Creek"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"~ 19:00"|"about seven o’clock in the evening"|"It was about seven o’clock in the evening, and Dona, coming up on deck, found that the ship had altered course again, and was now standing in once more towards the coast."|"Frenchman's Creek"|"Daphne Du Maurier"

Now and again the spray broke on the deck, splashing her hands, soaking her gown, but she did not care, the sun would soon dry her clothes, and she found a little patch of dry deck to leeward of the wheel where she sat cross-legged like a gypsy, her shawl tucked into her sash, and the wind playing havoc with her hair. By noon, she was prodigiously hungry, and there came to her, from the bows of the ship, the smell of hot burned bread and bitter black coffee, and presently she saw Pierre Blanc climb the ladder to the poop, bearing in his hands a tray."|"Frenchman's Creek"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
00:00|midnight|"The sound was greeted by the immediate barking of dogs, and then footsteps, and the drawing of bolts, and to her consternation Godolphin himself stood there, a taper in his hand, his great bulk filling the doorway. “What do you want?” he said angrily. “Don’t you know the hour, it’s close on midnight, and everyone abed.”"|"Frenchman's Creek"|"Daphne Du Maurier"

19:00|"seven o’clock that evening"|"So, for the first time for many years, there was a banquet in the great dining-hall of Navron House. The candles shone down upon the guests as they sat shoulder to shoulder, six a side, at the long table, and the table itself was splendid with silver and rose-bordered plate and large bowls piled high with fruit. At one end the host, blue-eyed and flushed, his blond wig a little askew, laughed a shade too loudly and too long at every jest that passed. At the other end the hostess toyed with the dishes set before her, cool, unperturbed, throwing glances now and again at the guests beside her as though he on her right hand and he on her left were the only men who mattered in the world, she was theirs for this evening, or longer if so desired. Never before, thought Harry St. Columb, kicking at one of the dogs under the table, never before had Dona flirted so blatantly, made eyes so outrageously. If this was the result of that confounded fever, God help all the fellows present. Never before, thought Rockingham, watching her across the table, never before had Dona looked so provocative; what was passing through her head that moment, and why had she walked through the woods towards the river at seven o’clock that evening, when he thought her asleep in her bed?"|"Frenchman's Creek"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
00:00|midnight|"And this, thought every guest who sat at her table, this is the famous Lady St. Columb, of whom, from time to time, we hear so much gossip, so much scandal; who sups in London taverns with the ladies of the town, who rides bareback in the streets at midnight in her husband’s breeches, who has given something of herself, no doubt, to every philanderer at St. James’s, not to mention His Majesty himself."|"Frenchman's Creek"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap < 11:00"|"nearly eleven o’clock"|"“And it’s now nearly eleven o’clock,” thought Dona, “and we are still eating, and drinking, and talking, and if I can go on like this, even for a little longer, it will give him time down there in the creek, for the tide must be making all the while, and no matter whether La Mouette has a gap in her hull or not, what repairs they have done to her must hold, and the ship must sail.”"|"Frenchman's Creek"|"Daphne Du Maurier"

The clock in the stable yard struck one; a high thin note, like the echo of a bell. Upstairs, unclothed and with their wrists tied, the guests of Navron House would be lying helpless and enraged upon the floor. All except Harry, and he would be asleep, on his back, and snoring, his wig askew and his mouth wide open, for not all the ill-treatment in the world would keep a St. Columb from his bed, when he had supped too well. William must be attending to his own hurt, in his own room, and her conscience reproached her, for she had been forgetting him. So she turned then, to the great staircase, and placed her hand on the rail, when a sound from above made her look upwards to the gallery. And there, staring down at her with narrow, unsmiling eyes, stood Rockingham with a gash across his face, and a knife in his hand."|"Frenchman's Creek"|"Daphne Du Maurier"

09:00|"nine in the morning"|"“I imagined we could all travel together, when this business is over,” he protested. “They’ll be hanging that fellow tomorrow in all probability. I thought of going over to see Godolphin and Eustick about it today. You’d like to see him hanged, would you not? We could fix it for nine in the morning, perhaps, and then start our journey afterwards.”"|"Frenchman's Creek"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"They had cold meat at one o’clock, the children eating with herself and Harry for a treat. Henrietta danced about the table like a fairy, white with excitement because he was to ride beside their carriage. James sat on Dona’s lap, endeavoring to put his feet up on the table, and when Dona permitted him, he looked about him with an air of triumph, and she kissed his fat cheek and held him to her. Harry caught something of his children’s excitement, and he began to tell them about Hampshire, and how they would go there in all probability, for the rest of the summer. “You shall have a pony, Henrietta,” he said, “and James too, later on,” and he began to throw pieces of meat across the floor to the dogs, and the children clapped their hands and shouted."|"Frenchman's Creek"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"> 12:00"|"just after noon"|"“Sir Harry and Prue and the children left Navron just after noon today. The only thing that matters now is that we help your master. You know what happened?”"|"Frenchman's Creek"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
12:00|noon|"“My dear Lord Godolphin, you must forgive me,” said Dona, “and had I known I would never have disturbed you. But I bring messages from Harry, you see, and his apologies. Something in London necessitated his immediate return, he left at noon today with the children, and…”"|"Frenchman's Creek"|"Daphne Du Maurier"

“Tonight at eleven.”
She nodded, and whispered “William and I.”"|"Frenchman's Creek"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"< 00:00"|"before midnight"|"“Which will not be much before midnight, what do you say, Zachariah Smith, and father of fourteen?” asked Dona."|"Frenchman's Creek"|"Daphne Du Maurier"

"ap 07:00"|seven|"At seven her supper was brought to her on a tray, and she ate little of it, not being hungry. Then she gave orders to the servant not to disturb her again during the evening, for she was tired, and not to call her in the morning, for she would sleep late in all probability, before the tedium of the journey."|"Frenchman's Creek"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap > 09:00"|"just after nine o’clock"|"When she was alone, she undid the bundle that William had given her on her return from Lord Godolphin. Smiling to herself she drew out the rough stockings, the worn breeches, and the patched though gaily colored shirt. She remembered his look of embarrassment as he had given them to her, and his words: “These are the best Grace can do for you, my lady, they belong to her brother.” “They are perfect, William,” she had replied, “and Pierre Blanc himself could have done no better.” For she must play the boy again, for the last time, and escape from her woman’s clothes for this night at least. “I will be able to run better without petticoats,” she said to William, “and I can ride astride my horse, like I used to as a child.” He had procured the horses, as he had promised, and was to meet her with them on the road from Navron to Gweek just after nine o’clock."|"Frenchman's Creek"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"< 00:00"|"before midnight"|"“Asleep? Bless you, no, sir. He’s had two glasses of ale, and he said you’d pay me for them, and that if you did turn up at the keep here before midnight he’d join you in another glass, and drink to the son and heir.” The jailer laughed, and then lowering his voice he added, “It’s irregular, sir, of course, but then, when a man is going to be hanged in the morning, even if he is a pirate and a Frenchman, you can’t exactly wish him ill, can you, sir?” Dona could not catch William’s reply, but she heard the chink of coins, and the scrape of feet. The jailer laughed again and said, “Thank you, sir, you’re a true gentleman, and when my wife’s expecting again, I shall think of you.”"|"Frenchman's Creek"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"These things belonged to the evening, and had no place in the night that had come. For it was long past midnight now, and darker than it would ever be again. The stars were clustered thick like little pin-pricks of light, and the crescent moon had gone."|"Frenchman's Creek"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
