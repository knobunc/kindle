16:00|"4 P.M."|"If I am right about his discovery of the main bed in 1909, then the second part of the canonical tale—the week-long patient tracing of errant block to source in 1910—must be equally false. Walcott’s diary for 1910 supports my interpretation. On July 10, champing at the bit, he hiked up to the Burgess Pass campground, but found the area too deep in snow for any excavations. Finally, on July 29, Walcott reported that his party set up “at Burgess Pass campground of 1909.” On July 30, they climbed neighboring Mount Field and collected fossils. Walcott indicates that they made their first attempt to map the Burgess beds on August 1: “All out collecting the Burgess formation until 4 P.M. when a cold wind and rain drove us into camp. Measured section of the Burgess formation—420 feet thick. Sidney with me. Stuart with his mother and Helen puttering about camp.” “Measuring a section” is geological jargon for tracing the vertical sequence of strata and noting the rock types and fossils. If you wished to find the source of an errant block that had broken off and tumbled down, you would measure the section above, trying to match your block to its most likely layer."|"Wonderful Life"|"Stephen Jay Gould"

The first four of nine body segments carry uniramous walking legs like those of merostomes. But the five posterior segments bear ordinary biramous appendages, with gill branches and walking legs. The “tail” piece, formed of three cylindrical segments and a caudal fan, looks more crustacean than merostomoid. Bruton found ostracodes, hyolithids, and small trilobites in Sidneyia’s gut, and interpreted the animal as a bottom-dwelling carnivore.

Habelia has the same basic shape as Molaria, but Whittington also described an impressive set of differences, some of high taxonomic significance. The carapace is covered with tubercles—a superficial though visually striking difference (figure 3.48). The trunk has twelve segments, with no cylindrical telson. The extended tail spike, ornamented with barbs and ridges, is unsegmented, but has a single joint about two-thirds of the way back.
