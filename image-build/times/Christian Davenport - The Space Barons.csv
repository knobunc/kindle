It was a little after ten a.m. The sun had burned off the last of the morning chill as the day was heating up fast. The breeze had picked up, and with four passengers, the fully loaded helicopter struggled to lift off out of a canyon near Cathedral Mountain in the warm, thin, high-altitude air of West Texas."|"The Space Barons"|"Christian Davenport"

The BE-3 is a Blue-developed 100,000 lb thrust rocket engine that uses liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen as its propellants. After overcoming the usual first test obstacles, we were able to get the test off around 4:00 pm today.
