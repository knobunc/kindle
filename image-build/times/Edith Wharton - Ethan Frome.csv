00:00|midnight|"As he strode along through the snow the sense of such meanings glowed in his brain and mingled with the bodily flush produced by his sharp tramp. At the end of the village he paused before the darkened front of the church. He stood there a moment, breathing quickly, and looking up and down the street, in which not another figure moved. The pitch of the Corbury road, below lawyer Varnum's spruces, was the favourite coasting-ground of Starkfield, and on clear evenings the church corner rang till late with the shouts of the coasters; but to-night not a sled darkened the whiteness of the long declivity. The hush of midnight lay on the village, and all its waking life was gathered behind the church windows, from which strains of dance-music flowed with the broad bands of yellow light."|"Ethan Frome"|"Edith Wharton"
12:00|mid-day|"His dread was so strong that, man-like, he sought to postpone certainty. The hauling was not over till mid-day, and as the lumber was to be delivered to Andrew Hale, the Starkfield builder, it was really easier for Ethan to send Jotham Powell, the hired man, back to the farm on foot, and drive the load down to the village himself. He had scrambled up on the logs, and was sitting astride of them, close over his shaggy grays, when, coming between him and their streaming necks, he had a vision of the warning look that Mattie had given him the night before."|"Ethan Frome"|"Edith Wharton"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"He stood up also, looking vaguely about the room. The clock above the dresser struck eleven."|"Ethan Frome"|"Edith Wharton"
12:00|noon|"As the two men were clearing out the stalls Jotham rested on his pitch-fork to say: ""Dan'l Byrne's goin' over to the Flats to-day noon, an' he c'd take Mattie's trunk along, and make it easier ridin' when I take her over in the sleigh."""|"Ethan Frome"|"Edith Wharton"
"ap 05:00"|five|"Ethan looked at him blankly, and he continued: ""Mis' Frome said the new girl'd be at the Flats at five, and I was to take Mattie then, so's 't she could ketch the six o'clock train for Stamford."""|"Ethan Frome"|"Edith Wharton"
"ap 06:00"|"six o'clock"|"Ethan looked at him blankly, and he continued: ""Mis' Frome said the new girl'd be at the Flats at five, and I was to take Mattie then, so's 't she could ketch the six o'clock train for Stamford."""|"Ethan Frome"|"Edith Wharton"
"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"The hired man threw a hesitating glance at Ethan. ""Round about noon,"" he said."|"Ethan Frome"|"Edith Wharton"
"ap 05:00"|five|"They clung to each other's hands like children, and her body shook with desperate sobs.
Through the stillness they heard the church clock striking five.
""Oh, Ethan, it's time!"" she cried."|"Ethan Frome"|"Edith Wharton"
"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"The ""smash-up"" it was—I gathered from the same informant—which, besides drawing the red gash across Ethan Frome's forehead, had so shortened and warped his right side that it cost him a visible effort to take the few steps from his buggy to the post-office window. He used to drive in from his farm every day at about noon, and as that was my own hour for fetching my mail I often passed him in the porch or stood beside him while we waited on the motions of the distributing hand behind the grating. I noticed that, though he came so punctually, he seldom received anything but a copy of the Bettsbridge Eagle, which he put without a glance into his sagging pocket. At intervals, however, the post-master would hand him an envelope addressed to Mrs. Zenobia—or Mrs. Zeena—Frome, and usually bearing conspicuously in the upper left-hand corner the address of some manufacturer of patent medicine and the name of his specific. These documents my neighbour would also pocket without a glance, as if too much used to them to wonder at their number and variety, and would then turn away with a silent nod to the post-master."|"Ethan Frome"|"Edith Wharton"
14:00|"two that afternoon"|"Frome had been driving me over to the Flats for about a week when one morning I looked out of my window into a thick snow-fall. The height of the white waves massed against the garden-fence and along the wall of the church showed that the storm must have been going on all night, and that the drifts were likely to be heavy in the open. I thought it probable that my train would be delayed; but I had to be at the power-house for an hour or two that afternoon, and I decided, if Frome turned up, to push through to the Flats and wait there till my train came in. I don't know why I put it in the conditional, however, for I never doubted that Frome would appear. He was not the kind of man to be turned from his business by any commotion of the elements; and at the appointed hour his sleigh glided up through the snow like a stage-apparition behind thickening veils of gauze."|"Ethan Frome"|"Edith Wharton"
