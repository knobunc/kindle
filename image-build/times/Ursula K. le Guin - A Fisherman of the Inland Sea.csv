         scenery, no props; the curves and angles of the structure exposed. The structural elements were rationally beautiful in their
         necessity. Form follows function. Instead of an illusion like the Common, the major space in each quadrant would be just that,
         a big space; call it the quad, maybe. Ten meters high, two hundred across, the arches of the hull reaching across it magnificently.
         He sketched it out on the holo, viewed it from different angles, walked around it. … It was past three when he went to bed,
         excited and satisfied by his work. Susan was fast asleep. He lay by her inert warmth and looked back on the events of the
         evening; his mind was clearer in the dark. There was no anti-Semitism in Spes. Look how many of the colonists were Jews. He
         was going to count, but found that he didn’t have to; the number seventeen was ready in his mind. It seemed less somehow than
         he had thought. He ran through the names and came out with seventeen. Not as many as it might have been, out of eight hundred,
         but a lot better than some other groups. There had been no problem recruiting people of Asiatic ancestry, in fact it seemed
         the reverse, but the lack of African-ancestry colonists had caused long and bitter struggles of conscience over policy, back
         in the Union. But there had been no way around the fact that in a closed community of only eight hundred, every single person
         must be fit, not only genetically, but intellectually. And after the breakdown of public schooling during the Refederation,
         blacks just didn’t get the training. There had been few black applicants, even, and almost none of them had passed the rigorous
         tests. They had been wonderful people, of course, but that wasn’t enough. Every adult on board had to be outstandingly competent
         in several areas of expertise. There was no time to train people who had, through no fault of their own, been disadvantaged
         from the start. It came down to what D.H. Maston, the “Father of Spes,” called the cold equations, from an old story he liked
         to tell. “No dead weight on board!” was the moral of the story. “Too many lives depend on every choice we make! If we could
         afford to be sentimental—if we could take the easy way—nobody would rejoice more sincerely than I. But we can have only one
         criterion: excellence. Physical and mental excellence in every respect. Any applicant who meets that criterion is in. Any
         one who doesn’t, is out.”"|"A Fisherman of the Inland Sea"|"Ursula K. le Guin"

         her husbands and household, all had drawn aside, leaving the way clear to the bank of the stream. Stone steps were built down
         right to the water, and at their foot lay a terrace, paved with light-colored stone, over which the clear water washed in
         quick-moving, shallow sheets. Amidst the shine and motion of the water stood an altar or low pedestal, blinding bright in
         the noon sun: gilt or solid gold, carved and drawn into intricate and fantastic figures of crowned men, dancing men, men with
         diamond eyes. On the pedestal lay a wand, not gold, unornamented, of dark wood or tarnished metal."|"A Fisherman of the Inland Sea"|"Ursula K. le Guin"
00:00|midnight|"To those unfamiliar with our customs I should explain that on O, a world with a low, stable human population and an ancient
         climax technology, certain social arrangements are almost universal. The dispersed village, an association of farms, rather
         than the city or state, is the basic social unit. The population consists of two halves or moieties. A child is born into
         its mother’s moiety, so that all ki’O (except the mountain folk of Ennik) belong either to the Morning People, whose time
         is from midnight to noon, or the Evening People, whose time is from noon to midnight. The sacred origins and functions of
         the moieties are recalled in the Discussions and the Plays and in the services at every farm shrine. The original social function
         of the moiety was probably to structure exogamy into marriage and so discourage inbreeding in isolated farmholds, since one
         can have sex with or marry only a person of the other moiety. The rule is severely reinforced. Transgressions, which of course
         occur, are met with shame, contempt, and ostracism. One’s identity as a Morning or an Evening Person is as deeply and intimately
         part of oneself as one’s gender, and has quite as much to do with one’s sexual life."|"A Fisherman of the Inland Sea"|"Ursula K. le Guin"

"> 12:00"|"just past noon"|"I went out into the corridor. Perhaps I had myself been disoriented and left the Churten Field Laboratory and come to full
         consciousness somewhere else. But my crew would have been there; where were they? And that would have been hours ago; it should
         have been just past noon on O when I arrived. A slight temporal displacement? said the mind, working away. I went down the
         corridor looking for my lab, and that is when it became like one of those dreams in which you cannot find the room which you
         must find. It was that dream. The building was perfectly familiar: it was Tower Hall, the second floor of Tower, but there
         was no Churten Lab. All the labs were biology and biophysics, and all were deserted. It was evidently late at night. Nobody
         around. At last I saw a light under a door and knocked and opened it on a student reading at a library terminal."|"A Fisherman of the Inland Sea"|"Ursula K. le Guin"
