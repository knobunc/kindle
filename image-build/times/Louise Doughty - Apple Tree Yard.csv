He takes careful notes, raising his hand politely when he needs a witness to slow down. He blows his nose frequently, which makes him seem vulnerable. He is stern with the barristers but kindly to the jury. One of them stumbled over the words of the oath as she was sworn in and the judge smiled and nodded his head to her and said, ‘Do please take as long as you like, Madam.’ I like the jury too. It seems like an acceptable cross-section to me; a slight predominance of women, three black people and six Asian, ages ranging from around twenty to mid-sixties. Hard to believe such an innocuous group of people might send me to prison; even harder to believe it now, while they are slumped in their seats. None of them are in the perky, upright pose they all adopted when the trial began, faces bright, filled with the adrenaline of their own significance. Like me, they were probably surprised at first that the courtroom hours are so short, ten in the morning at the earliest, until lunchtime, finishing no later than four. But we all understand now. It’s the slowness of everything – that’s what’s so exhausting: we are well into the trial now and weighed down by detail. They are feeling smothered. They don’t understand what this young woman is driving at any more than I do."|"Apple Tree Yard"|"Louise Doughty"

04:00|"four o’clock in the morning"|"To begin where it began – really, it began twice. It began that cold March day in the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft in the Palace of Westminster, beneath the drowned saints and the roasted saints and saints in every state of torture. It began that night, when I rose from my bed at four o’clock in the morning. I’m not a true insomniac. I have never tossed and turned night after night or spent weeks in a dreary fug of exhaustion, grey-faced and careful. Once in a while I find myself suddenly and inexplicably awake – and so it was that night. My eyes sprang open, my mind sprang into consciousness. My God, I thought, it happened… I went over what happened, and each time I went over it, it seemed more preposterous. I rolled beneath the duvet, the motion heavy, closed my eyes, then opened them immediately, knowing that sleep would not come again for at least an hour. Self-awareness: it is one of the chief bonuses of advancing age. It is our consolation prize."|"Apple Tree Yard"|"Louise Doughty"

I had been typing for nearly an hour, editing as I went, and was heavy-headed, tired of sitting upright and tired of my sardonic tone. I scanned through the letter, tightening the odd phrase here and there, noting that there were two places when I had been less than frank. The first was a minor untruth, one of those small acts of self-mythologising, where you diminish or exaggerate some detail as a form of shorthand, in order to explain yourself to someone – the aim concision rather than deceit. It was the bit where I had claimed that I write my best papers at three in the morning. I don’t. It’s true that I sometimes get up and work in the night, but I have never done my best work then. My best work is done at around 10 a.m., just after my breakfast of bitter marmalade on toast and a very large black coffee. The other place where I had been less than truthful was more serious, of course. It was where I referred to my son."|"Apple Tree Yard"|"Louise Doughty"

Before I stood up, I folded my paper napkin and put it and the spoon into my coffee cup, a neat sort of person, you thought. I rose from my chair and smoothed my dress down, back and front, with a swift, brushing sort of gesture. I ran my fingers through my hair, either side of my face. I shouldered my bag and picked up the file. As I walked away from the table, I glanced back, just to check I hadn’t left anything behind. Later, you tell me that this is how you guessed I had children. Children are always leaving things behind and once you have developed the habit of checking a table before you walk away, it’s hard to break, even when yours have grown up and left home. You didn’t guess how old my children were, though, you got that wrong.

He indicated with a wave of his hand that I could take it for him, giving me a quick thumbs-up gesture to say, it was good, thanks, without noticing that he hadn’t actually eaten what was on it.
