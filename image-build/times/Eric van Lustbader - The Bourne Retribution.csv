12:00|noonday|"A moment later, silent and ghost-like, he slipped from the room. Stripping off the vinyl suit and booties, he stowed them in his bag. He kept the latex gloves on. Descending two flights of metal stairs, he exited unnoticed through the rear door, vanishing into the white noonday glare."|"The Bourne Retribution"|"Eric van Lustbader"
20:30|"Eight thirty this evening"|"Ben Asher stared at him for a moment. “What time is your flight?”
“Eight thirty this evening.”
“Doable, certainly.” Asher tapped his forefinger against his lower lip. “Now, what nationality should you be? Too bad you don’t have any Asian blood in you; a Malaysian businessman would pass unnoticed in Shanghai.” He studied Bourne’s face. “I could make you Syrian, but that would only stir up trouble.”"|"The Bourne Retribution"|"Eric van Lustbader"
00:00|midnight|"“Finish up this Sinai business before it gets more messy than it already is. I want our citizens out of our enemies’ hands and safely back on home soil by midnight. Is that clear?”"|"The Bourne Retribution"|"Eric van Lustbader"
"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"It was past midnight. A horned moon appeared and disappeared behind scudding clouds that brought a humid wind presaging heavy rain. Around them, armed guards patrolled the periphery, just beyond the eight-foot stucco walls that enclosed the compound. Other guards paced through the gardens and oasis-like fistfuls of palms. Save for the cicadas, tree frogs, and the occasional harsh bark of a street dog, the night was blanketed with a velvety silence, as if they were at a resort on the Mayan coast. All that was missing was the soft splash of the waves onto the beach."|"The Bourne Retribution"|"Eric van Lustbader"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"“He wasn’t even mentioned.” Maricruz finished off her mescal. “The three of us will meet tomorrow morning at nine to finalize the alliance.”"|"The Bourne Retribution"|"Eric van Lustbader"
20:00|"eight o’clock in the evening"|"Ophir waved a hand as if in surrender. “All right, all right. Let’s see.” He checked his computer screen. “I have a good man in Mexico City. His code name is J. J. Hale. Here’s what he looks like. That’s all you need to know about him.” He drew a scratch pad toward him, scribbled a couple of lines on it, tore off the sheet, and handed it across to Bourne. “Starting tomorrow, he’ll be at this café precisely at eight o’clock in the evening every day for five days. The second line is the code words to introduce yourself and his response.”"|"The Bourne Retribution"|"Eric van Lustbader"
04:00|"four in the morning"|"“He’s up at four in the morning, working. By the time we see each other I’m as I always appear to him. As far as he’s concerned I’m perfect.”"|"The Bourne Retribution"|"Eric van Lustbader"
"ap 01:00"|one|"“You know, this coyote has been waiting a long time for a name,” she said. “Do you think you could give it one?”"|"The Bourne Retribution"|"Eric van Lustbader"
"< 12:00"|"toward noon"|"Manny shrugged. “The doctor who comes is of no use, but he’s the only one she trusts, God knows why. Each day she seems worse. She has no appetite, as I’ve said, her skin is pale—sometimes, toward noon, it looks blue-gray—and lately, there are moments of confusion, when she thinks Maceo is still alive, still in love with her.”"|"The Bourne Retribution"|"Eric van Lustbader"
