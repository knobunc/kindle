We had been wakened as on my first morning by the hideous 6 a.m. clattering of dustbin lids; I hadn’t really expected a bugle but I found this noise intolerable.

A horrible time, truncating the night’s slumber yet eliminating any chance of a soothing return to bed for an hour before the day’s work. And I hated turning out even more since my marriage. Helen was lovely to come back to, but by the same token it was a bigger wrench to leave her soft warm presence and venture into the inhospitable world outside."|"Vets Might Fly"|"James Herriot"

In fact I felt rather a lout in my working clothes among the elegant gathering."|"Vets Might Fly"|"James Herriot"

Most of the lads stuck it out till they had roaring fevers before going sick and by now, at the end of February, nearly all of them had spent a few days in hospital. I was one of the few who hadn’t. Maybe there was a bit of bravado in my stand because most of them were eighteen-or nineteen-year-olds and I was a com paratively old man in my twenties but there were two other reasons. Firstly, it was very often after I had got dressed and been unable to eat breakfast that I felt really ill. But by then it was too late.
