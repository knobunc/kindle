"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"I had an algebra test the next day that I had forgotten to study for; I did not do well. I came out of the school building at one o’clock and walked quickly to the subway. It was a cold cloudy March day. I had left my books in school and carried with me only the sketchbook filled with my Guernica drawings and another sketchbook filled with drawings of my street. The subway was not crowded. I watched carefully for the stations where I needed to change trains. I noticed that the farther I traveled from Brooklyn, the more frequently I was stared at. In my dark-blue winter coat and hat, and with my thin pale features and red hair and dangling earlocks, I was not exactly a typical New Yorker. At one point in the journey, during a particularly long ride between stations, I opened my Guernica sketchbook and began leafing through the drawings. I saw the eyes in the round face of the elderly woman sitting next to me slowly grow wide with astonishment. I closed the sketchbook and looked out the window near my seat. We were in underground darkness outside the window and I could see only my reflection. I spent the rest of the journey looking at my reflection in that dark window of the train."|"My Name Is Asher Lev"|"Chaim Potok"
"ap > 02:00"|"a little past two o’clock"|"He pulled the metal door shut. The noisy whine of the elevator faded quickly. I walked down the corridor. It was dimly lighted and smelled vaguely of strong disinfectant cleanser. I stopped outside the door to Jacob Kahn’s studio and waited. I was sweating heavily, and I removed my hat and coat; I left my skullcap on. I heard voices inside. I recognized Jacob Kahn’s voice; the other was the voice of a woman. I stood there hesitating. I stood there a long time. I looked at my wrist watch; it was a little past two o’clock. I knocked softly on the door. The voices did not stop. I rang the bell. The voices ceased abruptly and I heard footsteps. The door was opened and Jacob Kahn stood there, broad-shouldered, white-haired, wearing paint-smeared dungarees and a plaid shirt with the sleeves rolled up to the elbows. A cigarette stuck out from beneath his walrus mustache. With the sleeves of his shirt rolled up, I could see the muscles of his arms; they were powerful arms, and they looked sculpted from stone."|"My Name Is Asher Lev"|"Chaim Potok"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"“You will not miss your flight. It is not yet four o’clock. Listen to what I say to the boy. He will be as much yours as mine.” He turned to me. “Asher Lev, I will give you five years of my time. If at the end of those five years you are not ready for Anna, we are finished and it will all have been a waste. If, however, you are ready for Anna, I will make suggestions as to how we are to proceed. I want you to understand something. It is not in my nature to begin a relationship with a lie. I am not doing this as a favor to the Rebbe. I have respect for the Rebbe, but I have passion for my art. The Rebbe asked me to guide you and to keep you from evil ways. Those were his words. I do not know what evil is when it comes to art. I only know what is good art and what is bad art. Those were my words to the Rebbe. The Rebbe trusts me and will rely on my honest heart. Those were the Rebbe’s answering words to my remarks. I will not teach you on the basis of that trust. Artists should not be trusted. If an artist is not deceitful every so often in the cause of his art, then he is a poor artist. Those were my remarks to the Rebbe. Still, he trusts me. So be it. He trusts me. But it is of no real consequence to me whether the Rebbe does or does not trust me. I am taking you on not as a favor to the Rebbe but because you have greatness. I am selfish. All artists are selfish and self-centered. I am taking you on because I will derive pleasure in molding your greatness, just as I derive pleasure in molding clay and marble. For five years, I will sculpt you and bring out of you what is already inside you. I will work with your faults and flaws and genius, as Michelangelo worked with the flaws and power of the marble that became his David. Are you listening to me, Asher Lev? Do you hear me, Anna? I am seventy-two years old. I do not have five years to give to anything that is less than a marble for a David.” He looked at the woman. “Do you have anything you wish to say, Anna?”"|"My Name Is Asher Lev"|"Chaim Potok"

I came out of my Uncle Yitzchok’s house a few minutes after eight o’clock. The air was warm and humid. A hazy sun shone through the trees. The city seemed deserted. I waited a long time for a subway. I got to Jacob Kahn’s studio a little before ten o’clock. He opened the door, and I saw a girl standing in the sunlight that came through the wall of windows. She looked to be in her early twenties, had short raven hair and dark eyes, and was beautiful in a dark and somber way.

"ap < 05:00"|"shortly before five o’clock"|"He spoke briefly to the girl. She went behind a screen. I set my pad on an easel. She came out from behind the screen and sat on a chair. Sunlight fell across her face and shoulders and breasts and thighs. She sat with one leg crossed over the other, her head slightly back. I saw the sunlight on her skin. She was very beautiful. I did not even know her name. I saw the flowing curve of the breasts. I saw the line of shoulders and hip and thigh and leg. I drew her carefully. My arm felt nerveless, drained of its strength. I felt sweat in my armpits and along my back. My face dripped sweat. Jacob Kahn stood behind me, watching. I finished the drawing. It was very bad. I felt ashamed. I took a deep breath and moved to a clean sheet of paper and began again. The girl sat very still, bathed in sunlight. I looked at her and worked carefully, translating her body into lines, making choices, each curve, each subtle change in the flow of her flesh, necessitating an interpreting choice of line. I started a third drawing. Jacob Kahn signaled to her. She changed her pose, sitting forward on the chair, her face in her hands, her breasts suddenly pendulous. I drew her that way twice. She changed her pose again, sitting with one leg up on the chair, clasping the leg to herself with her arms, her chin resting on her knee, her thighs open. I drew her that way and then drew her again in two more poses before it was time for lunch. I ate the sandwich my aunt had packed for me. Jacob Kahn and the girl went out for lunch and returned in less than half an hour. I spent all the rest of that day drawing the girl. She left shortly before five o’clock."|"My Name Is Asher Lev"|"Chaim Potok"
12:00|noon|"The next day, on my way out of the classroom for the noon recess, I slipped the drawing into his Gemorra. I saw the sudden stiffening of his shoulders when he found it. I saw him stare at it. I saw him turn to look at me, then stop. He crumpled the drawing. But he did not throw it away. He put it into a pocket."|"My Name Is Asher Lev"|"Chaim Potok"
"< 12:00"|"Toward noon"|"Toward noon, with the sun hot and glaring overhead, we would bring our easels and paints into the house and cross the dunes to the beach. We would swim in the cold ocean water. I learned to swim that summer with the help of Jacob Kahn. He was a powerful swimmer. I would stand on the beach and watch him swimming off in the distance, his arms flashing in the sunlight. He had bronzed quickly in the sun; I had burned. Part of my first week in that house I spent realizing how fair-skinned I really was."|"My Name Is Asher Lev"|"Chaim Potok"
"< 12:00"|"Shortly before noon"|"Shortly before noon the next day, a cab stopped at the house and Anna Schaeffer hurried inside. She greeted me briefly and went off with Tanya Kahn. They were gone a long time. The cab waited near the house."|"My Name Is Asher Lev"|"Chaim Potok"
"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"In the morning, we painted together. We did not talk about the past three days. When we went down to the beach before noon to swim, I saw him staring at the sand beyond the curving line of surf. The sand was damp and smooth. He went into the water and swam a long time far away from the shore. Then he came out of the water and stood next to me, dripping, his white hair wild and wet, droplets of water clinging to his mustache."|"My Name Is Asher Lev"|"Chaim Potok"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"I began to walk quickly. I came to a narrow street and rested for a while in the shade of stone houses. The street was crowded. I felt tired. I walked a while longer, then took a cab back to my room. I lay down on the bed in my clothes and slept. After about an hour, I woke feeling hot and faintly dizzy. I washed my face in cold water and went back outside. I walked across the Ponte Vecchio and wandered about the city. I went past the Uffizi and found it had closed at four o’clock. It was almost six. I went quickly back across the bridge to the house of the old woman. She served me supper, then sat in an old leather chair reading from her Book of Psalms. I watched her for a while, then did a rapid drawing of her. She did not see me."|"My Name Is Asher Lev"|"Chaim Potok"

"ap < 11:30"|"almost eleven-thirty"|"I looked at my watch. It was almost eleven-thirty. I remembered I had left the lights burning in my parents’ bedroom. I went along the hallway and past the kitchen and came into their room. The large double bed stood against the wall to my right, covered with its pale-blue woolen spread. My father’s dark-wood desk was against the wall to my left. It was cluttered with his papers and books and with old copies of Time and Newsweek. A few framed needleworks of flowers and birds hung from the white walls. On top of my mother’s dark-wood dresser were photographs of her sister Leah’s family. There were no photographs on my father’s dresser. The dark floral rug had been recently cleaned; it gave off a faint acrid odor. I smelled the odor of the rug. I looked at the bed and remembered the odor of my mother’s illness. I remembered her lying beneath the green quilt, looking shrunken and dead. Here are the birds and flowers, Mama. I made the world pretty, Mama. I’m making my mama well. I had once thought that there was power in a drawing, that the lines and shapes came through my hand from the Master of the Universe, that a drawing could better the world, make it pretty, make my mother happy, make her well. Aren’t you well now, Mama? I’ll make more birds and flowers for you, Mama. I had thought the power came in the night from the Master of the Universe through the angels that guarded me in my sleep. May Michael be at my right hand; Gabriel at my left; before me, Uriel; behind me, Raphael. I looked at the double bed and thought I saw my father there, his red beard sticking over the top of the green quilt. I turned off the lights and came into the kitchen. I stared at the table. It was clean. I thought I saw it covered with books. But it was clean and bare. There was no milk in the refrigerator. I turned off the light and went through the hallway into the living room."|"My Name Is Asher Lev"|"Chaim Potok"
"< 00:00"|"almost midnight"|"I turned off the lights and went through the hallway to my room. I sat on my bed and felt the coldness inside myself and the pounding of the blood in my head. I looked at my watch. It was almost midnight. After a moment, I got off the bed and went to the phone stand in the hallway. I looked up a number and dialed. The ringing went on a long time before it was answered."|"My Name Is Asher Lev"|"Chaim Potok"
"> 09:00"|"a little after nine in the morning"|"It was a little after nine in the morning. The parkway was choked now with slow-moving struggling rush-hour traffic. There was a cold wind. It blew the powdery surface of the snow against the houses and cars. I felt the snow on my face and in my eyes. I walked, and thought of my parents. I felt the wind through my coat. My beard was encrusted with snow. Where was I? What corner was this? I had come to a corner that looked familiar despite the hills of snow that had changed its appearance. The street sign was covered with snow. I turned up the street. Solitary figures walked the street along a narrow path cut into tall drifts. I saw a man with a shovel. He wore a dark coat and galoshes and a cap with earmuffs. He pushed the shovel through the snow, bent, lifted, threw snow into the street, and pushed the shovel again. I came up to him. He did not see me. His wide eyes were wet with cold and exertion. His beaked nose was red. His gray beard was stiff with frozen snow."|"My Name Is Asher Lev"|"Chaim Potok"

Yes, tomorrow. Of course I would be on time for the meeting with her West Coast representative. Yes, I would be nice to her Munich night-club owner. Good night. Good night. I hung up the phone. I roamed the apartment, feeling cold with dread. I should have destroyed them. Who needs them? What good are they going to do the world? I had painted them; wasn’t that enough? No, it wasn’t enough. They had to be moved into the public arena. You communicate in a public arena; everything else is puerile and cowardly. I could not sleep. I lay awake hours in the dark. I heard my parents come in. It was almost two o’clock in the morning. They sat in the kitchen, drinking coffee and talking softly. I thought I heard the word “museum.” They went into their bedroom. I remained awake. There was faint gray light along the rim of my window. Is it morning already? Is it Sunday? What happened to the night? I don’t want the night to end. There was sunlight on the window. Inside myself was a darkness of death."|"My Name Is Asher Lev"|"Chaim Potok"
"ap 01:00"|one|"I came out of the Rebbe’s office and walked past Rav Dorochoff’s angry gaze and out of the building. I walked for hours then beneath the naked trees of the parkway along streets that had once been my world but were now cold and gone from me. Sometime during the walking, I stopped in front of a mound of snow and with my finger drew in one continuous line the contour of my face. Asher Lev in snow on a cold Brooklyn parkway. Asher Lev, Hasid. Asher Lev, painter. I looked at my right hand, the hand with which I painted. There was power in that hand. Power to create and destroy. Power to bring pleasure and pain. Power to amuse and horrify. There was in that hand the demonic and the divine at one and the same time. The demonic and the divine were two aspects of the same force. Creation was demonic and divine. Creativity was demonic and divine. Art was demonic and divine. The solitary vision that put new eyes into gouged-out sockets was demonic and divine. I was demonic and divine. Asher Lev, son of Aryeh and Rivkeh Lev, was the child of the Master of the Universe and the Other Side. Asher Lev paints good pictures and hurts people he loves. Then be a great painter, Asher Lev; that will be the only justification for all the pain you will cause. But as a great painter I will cause pain again if I must. Then become a greater painter. But I will cause pain again. Then become a still greater painter. Master of the Universe, will I live this way all the rest of my life? Yes, came the whisper from the branches of the trees. Now journey with me, my Asher. Paint the anguish of all the world. Let people see the pain. But create your own molds and your own play of forms for the pain. We must give a balance to the universe."|"My Name Is Asher Lev"|"Chaim Potok"
