"< 00:00"|"before midnight"|"“You!” She levelled her makeshift weapon at a pair of burly mercs wrestling on the rushes in front of a fireplace. “Can’t you read the bloody sign?” Lacking another arm with which to point, Tera used the spoon to draw their attention to an etched wooded board above the bar, and even deigned to read it to them. “No fighting before midnight! This is a civilized establishment, not a godsdamned brawling pit.”"|"Bloody Rose"|"Nicholas Eames"
"~ 00:00"|"Around midnight"|"Around midnight a train of linked carriages hauled by sturdy Kaskar ponies clattered across Ardburg. It was free to ride, and spared drunks and those abroad late a long walk through often inclement weather. Tam flagged it out front of the Cornerstone and chose a carriage she thought was empty. It wasn’t. There was a city watchman passed out on the opposite bench. His helmet was overturned in his lap, and from the reek Tam guessed it was filled with vomit. She pushed open the screens despite the cold, and once they were moving it didn’t smell so bad."|"Bloody Rose"|"Nicholas Eames"

"~ 12:00"|"Around noon that day"|"Around noon that day they spotted a hamlet nestled between two hills. Rose called a halt and sent Brune into town on an errand. Shortly after he left, one of Rose’s saddlebags began yelling at her."|"Bloody Rose"|"Nicholas Eames"

"~ 12:00"|"Around noon"|"Around noon Doshi’s mood began to sour. Tam followed his gaze and saw dark clouds piled on the horizon. “The Stormwall,” he announced, lowering his goggles and tightening the sash at his waist. “You’ll want to get below. Things are about to get interesting.”"|"Bloody Rose"|"Nicholas Eames"
"~ 12:00"|"around midday"|"They rolled up sometime around midday. The road running past the inn was thick with refugees fleeing Coverdale, and the yard swarmed with mercs swapping stories and arguing over what to do next. Roderick offered to look after the horses. The satyr had been glancing skyward all morning, as if expecting Doshi to return at any moment with the stolen skyship."|"Bloody Rose"|"Nicholas Eames"
"< 12:00"|"shortly before noon"|"Alektra’s errand turned out to be a full-scale assault on her twin sister’s neighbouring territory. Hoping to catch Ios unprepared, the baroness’s men raided the warrens of Telltale shortly before noon. They met no resistance whatsoever, though, since Ios, anticipating her sister’s treachery, had arranged an attack of her own. While Alektra’s men were looting Telltale, Ios and her assassins stormed the Paper Court. When next Tam saw the Baroness of Telltale, she was leading her sister around on a silver leash."|"Bloody Rose"|"Nicholas Eames"
