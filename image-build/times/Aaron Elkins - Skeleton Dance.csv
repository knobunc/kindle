In the meantime Gideon browsed through the day's output on the book he was working on and Julie fine-tuned their upcoming travel schedule—-a four-week jaunt to Germany's Neander Valley, to Oxford and Sussex in England, and to the Dordogne in France, in that order, scheduled to begin the following week. The itinerary had been determined by Gideon's research needs. Julie, a supervisory park ranger at Olympic National Park's administrative headquarters in Port Angeles, would be visiting one or two parks while they were overseas, but was basically going along, as she freely put it, for the ride, and to provide much-needed ""logistical support"" for the notoriously absent-minded Gideon."|"Skeleton Dance"|"Aaron Elkins"
