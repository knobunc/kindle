"ap 06:00"|"SIX O’CLOCK"|"HOPE HAD DIED BY SIX O’CLOCK; BUT STILL PETER SAT ON IN HIS corner seat, watching the continual coming and going through the wide-open door. There were farmers and graziers of the richer sort, gentlemen of all sizes and shapes and of every age but his own, red-coated officers, periwigged medical men, black lawyers, snuff-coloured merchants and the clergy in cassocks; footmen in liveries of every colour hurried on errands; parties of young men roared through the windows to their acquaintances within; indeed, half Ireland seemed to be in the great room of the Royal George and Harp. But alas it was the half that did not include the one person he really wanted to see; this person, Mr Peregrine FitzGerald, was unknown to Peter except by reputation and name, but he had a clear notion of what to expect and for hours and hours he had been looking for the arrival of a young fellow about his own age and size, a midshipman in the Royal Navy, who would, Peter supposed, come in and gaze about to find his travelling companion, and who, by his looking about and searching, would advertise his presence."|"The Golden Ocean"|"Patrick O'Brian"
18:00|"six in the afternoon"|"It would have been easier, Peter reflected when first he took his seat, if they had both been in the land service, for a red coat would show up at once: but in the Navy the officers wore what they chose, and apart from the King’s cockade there was no way of recognising them at all. But that reflection had taken place a long while ago. The sad change from lively expectation to no hope at all had taken place by six in the afternoon, when the rain began: but when the tall clock coughed and said eight, Peter was still looking earnestly at the door; he was still spinning out his mug of tepid porter and making it last, and he was still assuring himself that clocks in public places were very often made to run fast on purpose."|"The Golden Ocean"|"Patrick O'Brian"

"ap 05:30"|"half-past five"|"‘Trod on my foot.’
‘So you must get up at half-past five and push a sword into him?’
‘Exactly so. He did it on purpose, you know. He has been seeking a quarrel with me ever since I fought his brother, and that was the only thing his boorish mind could find to do. However let us not talk about him. There are much more agreeable subjects.’ He paused. ‘So we are to be companions on the road? Well, I am very glad of it.’"|"The Golden Ocean"|"Patrick O'Brian"
12:00|noon|"‘Never mind,’ said Elliot. ‘Let us begin again at the beginning. Now you have your noon-reading, have you not? So, noting down the height of the sun, you turn to your tables—here. Now comes the rule—here. Do you see?’"|"The Golden Ocean"|"Patrick O'Brian"
"ap 00:50"|"ten to one"|"He was soaked, but stifled with heat, and he swung himself into his hammock without taking off more than his jacket, for it was ten to one that the watch below would be piped up before very long."|"The Golden Ocean"|"Patrick O'Brian"
12:00|noon|"‘Now let there be no monkeying about in this watch,’ said Mr Brett, at noon. ‘Mr Palafox, you may take—no, not Mr Palafox. Mr Bailey, you may take a glass up and see what you can make out as the fog lifts. Mr Palafox, you may make yourself useful to Mr Randall in the shot-lockers. There you will find less to tempt you to untimely gambolling.’"|"The Golden Ocean"|"Patrick O'Brian"
"ap 08:02"|"Two minutes after eight"|"Two minutes after eight bells in the middle watch found Peter dead asleep, worn out with struggling with an obstinate foretopmast staysail by the fugitive light of the waning moon. But the forenoon watch saw him on the quarter-deck before his time, bubbling with anticipation."|"The Golden Ocean"|"Patrick O'Brian"
12:00|noon|"It was the scurvy, of course, that had broke him down; but it was Cape Noir that killed him. It was on the thirteenth of April. ‘I will write it down,’ said Peter, again. The thirteenth of April, three days after they had lost the Pearl and the Severn: thirty-eight days of beating round the Horn, with rarely a sight of the sun or the moon, with a current of enormous but incalculable strength setting eastward and driving them back: yet every officer aboard reckoned their position a good ten degrees west of Tierra del Fuego, and the course was set for the north at last—north, to bring them up the Chilean coast with sea-room and to spare. Edging up to the north with reborn hope the Centurion, the Gloucester, the Tryal, the Wager and the little Anna pink, shattered, pumping day and night, but still capable of high ambition, sailed day after day. Elliot was already very ill by the first week of April, the teeth loosening in his jaw; he was too weak to get in or out of his hammock, but they brought him the noon-readings whenever they had them, and the dead-reckoning and the rare shots of the moon: he worked their position with Halley’s compass deviations pinned up overhead and Frezier’s chart beside it. He was quite certain that they were running far clear of the land, running up their northing out of the zone of perpetual storm and into the warmth: it kept him alive."|"The Golden Ocean"|"Patrick O'Brian"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"‘My dear boy,’ said Mr Walter, ‘I hope you may not be taking to dissolute ways. I heard you and Keppel and Ransome hallooing and singing until three in the morning, and this is not the first time, by a very long way. The Commodore has taken notice of it more than once. He said, “How can anyone get any sleep with this infernal din going on?” Surely, this is very inconsiderate in you, Peter?’"|"The Golden Ocean"|"Patrick O'Brian"
00:00|midnight|"The next few days witnessed scenes of unparalleled activity on Juan Fernandez as the squadron made ready for the sea: officers could be heard begging their men not to overdo it, not to strain themselves past repair—a weird sound indeed—as the water-casks, the dried cod, the innumerable stores, flew into the Centurion’s eager hold and the Anna’s guns darted aboard the Carmelo. A party came to Peter in the falling dusk and with tears in their eyes implored him to intercede with the first lieutenant, that they might go on by lantern-light. Sean sat on the chests of silver, great black rings round his eyes for want of sleep, foaming with rage when anyone approached. The bo’sun and a numerous party of volunteers were detected at midnight creeping about the upper rigging, improving work already passed by the rigorous first lieutenant. Hairy Amos caught his beard in a tackle, but would not have the heaving stopped on any account, preferring to lose enough to stuff a large pillow rather than delay the departure by a minute."|"The Golden Ocean"|"Patrick O'Brian"
12:00|noon|"‘November 5th. 10° 36’ S. 77° 41’ N. Cape Barranca bearing WNW½W. Variation at noon 7° 1’ S. Light variable airs at S and SW. No news. We are more than 50 days out of Juan Fernandez now, and Mr Blew says they can send an express from Valparaiso to Lima in 30 days, so by now they may know all along the coast that we are here, and may already have laid an embargo on the shipping in Peru as well as Chile. The men are still in very high spirits however, and work the ship so briskly it is a pleasure to see. Mem. to ask the sailmaker to add 2 pieces to my canvas trousers: they only come to my shins, and are painfully tight. Mem. to give Rogers a handsome present for the Centurion in a bottle he made me.’"|"The Golden Ocean"|"Patrick O'Brian"
"ap 06:00"|six|"Three bells in the last dog watch. Four bells as Peter came down. The sun, with its maddening tropical habit of dipping at six, was nearly touching the sea: from the deck the Spaniard’s hull could just be seen now, but unless she carried a mast away she would still be miles ahead by the dark, and then she would certainly tack."|"The Golden Ocean"|"Patrick O'Brian"
"ap 04:00"|four|"But if Peter found one day’s waiting hard, he, in common with the entire squadron, found two, three and four days’ waiting harder still. Yet four days did not see the barge back again: it was a full week before their intense anxiety and suspense found relief.
At four bells in the forenoon watch the look-out reported a sail.
‘Lug-sail, sir,’ he answered the deck. ‘It might be the barge.’"|"The Golden Ocean"|"Patrick O'Brian"
02:30|vigils|"So on the third of March, Old Style, there was a watching and an expectancy aboard the squadron and the boats that can rarely have been paralleled in the long record of naval vigils—an expectancy so great that Peter, gasping under the unrelenting sun in the little overcrowded boat, tried to slacken his own share in it. It seemed to him unlucky to hope with such positive and utter confidence. It seemed to him that somehow it must warn the Spaniards—that they must feel uneasily aware of the tension and of the concentrated, singly-focused, unremitting glare of so many eyes."|"The Golden Ocean"|"Patrick O'Brian"
12:00|noon|"For his part he tried to throw doubt into his mind. There were the three missing Negroes to arouse suspicion in Acapulco: there was the possibility of the squadron’s topsails having been seen from the high land that floated always on their horizon, the mountains behind the town. And yet, in spite of all his caution, his heart beat so that he could hardly breathe as the pure dawn came up over Mexico on the appointed day: it beat high at noon, when the pitiless heat drove straight down on to the unheeding cutter’s crew: but it was filled with choking bitterness when at last the laggard sun dipped in a crimson blaze below the western sea."|"The Golden Ocean"|"Patrick O'Brian"
12:00|noon|"‘We came in a week ago, and it was touch and go whether we should fetch the island, they say, only I was in a sorts of stupid amazement then and did not know what was carrying on for a great while. It is a beautiful place, with melons, oranges, limes, lemons, coconuts, a curious large fruit we eat for bread, and flat squashing fruit and many others and an amazing plenty of wild cattle which the Spaniards had come to make jerked beef of when we surprised them. They had already bucanned, or jerked, a great deal and built huts, which is very delightful for us. Poor souls, they thought we were the galleon, for the Commodore was exceedingly deep, and beguiled them with the Manilla ship’s signals, and they pulled out to greet us. They had come in a bark from Guam, a pretty little thing, and none of them got off to give the alarm. I have been eating since noon, and it is now about four: but, however, I could wish that Sean would hurry with some more of the flat yellow kind of fruit.’"|"The Golden Ocean"|"Patrick O'Brian"
"> 00:00"|"a little after midnight"|"The water rose steadily; and a little after midnight their roof left them bodily, in one movement, like a card. But it was not cold, and they were tolerably accustomed to moisture: they even slept in snatches, for the slaughtered prey made charming soft lying, and they were both heavily bloated with animal food."|"The Golden Ocean"|"Patrick O'Brian"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"And now it was done. Full of bucanned beef, salted pork, fresh water, wood, and, for the moment, fresh fruit in abundance, she was standing out for the open sea. All around him the familiar pattern of naval life was taking shape again. The lift and roll of the ship had awakened his sea-legs: the sound of holystoning the deck filled his mind with peace. At eight bells he would form part of the watch: Mr Saumarez would have something rude to say to him, no doubt: he was at home again, and it was delightful."|"The Golden Ocean"|"Patrick O'Brian"
12:00|noon|"‘November 4th. 22° N. 119° 17’ W. Wind strong and steady at E. It is my birthday again and we sighted Formosa for certain, which pleased the crew uncommon. No latitude at noon because of low cloud yesterday, so what we saw was Formosa and not Botel Tobago Xima. Course now WNW. This is my 3rd birthday at sea: Sean gave me another comforter, which there is not room in the berth to measure exactly. Mr Walter some excellent guavas, preserved. The berth was going to have a spread, but Ransome and I are bid to the wardroom to dine. Mem. to ask Ransome—’"|"The Golden Ocean"|"Patrick O'Brian"
12:00|noon|"‘May 15th. No latitude at noon. Logged 71 leagues, course SW 17 hours, SW½W 7 hours. A glorious run after yesterday’s and the day before’s head-wind and dying airs. Topmen fired upon a pewter plate (old) veered out on a 20 fathom line: 30 holes in it at first volley: praised by Commodore. Mem. Cape Espiritu Santo shows as one knob, three little knobs, one knob, then a headland bearing NNE 1 mile to the sea.’"|"The Golden Ocean"|"Patrick O'Brian"
12:00|noon|"‘May 20th. Beautiful gale throughout middle watch and forenoon. Raised Cape at noon. I saw it at the same moment as Wilson, whatever he may say, SSW 11 leagues—knob, 3 knobs, knob, on starboard bow. Instantly tacked and struck topgallants, because of the sentinels they post there for the galleon, with beacons. Cape Espiritu Santo is in 12° 40’ N. precisely and 4° E. of Botel Tobago Xima: all our reckonings agree. This is May 31st, their style, and 3 days before the Acapulco ship has ever made the Cape. We are to cruise between 12° 50’ N. and 13° 5’. Crew in most amazing high spirits. Must get some sleep, not having turned in these four watches together.’"|"The Golden Ocean"|"Patrick O'Brian"
04:00|"four in the morning"|"Worn and irritable from lack of rest, Peter came off duty at the end of the middle watch. It was four in the morning. He could not face small beer and biscuit, nor the unending guess and conjecture of the berth. He moved slowly up to the foretop in the grey light of the declining moon: the dew was wet under his hands, and the rigging fiddle-string tight. The Centurion lay head-on to the Pacific surge, and remotely before her the stars shone low. It was now the morning watch, and somewhere beyond the rim of the sea the sun would have risen. Peter made a quick calculation: yes, the first rays would be coming green through the woods in Tinian now. They would be lighting the blackened keel of the bark they had burnt: and the dawn would be racing westward at an inconceivable speed. Soon—in an hour and a half or thereabouts—it would have covered the whole tract of sea that had taken them so long to pass, and it would put out the stars."|"The Golden Ocean"|"Patrick O'Brian"
