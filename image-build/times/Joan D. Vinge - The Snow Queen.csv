12:00|midday|"Moon and Sparks ran barefoot along the rough walls between the shallow harbor pens, a net slung swaying like a hammock from shoulder to slim shoulder between them. Their deft, callused feet slapped and splashed along the piled-stone pathways, immune to bruises and the lapping icy water. The klee in the pens, usually as sluggish as stones on the weedy bottom, surfaced with ungainly haste to watch the children pass. They blew spray and grunted with hunger; but the net was empty, its burden of dried seahair already dumped into the family stock-pens for the midday feeding."|"The Snow Queen"|"Joan D. Vinge"
12:00|noonday|"They ran on, dancing over the stones toward the gleaming noonday beach and the village beyond. Moon pictured the brown, smiling face of her mother as they had last seen her three months ago: thick sand-colored braids piled on her head, hidden under a dark knit cap; the thick high-necked sweater, slicker, and heavy boots that had made her indistinguishable from her crew as she tossed them a last kiss, while the double-hulled fishing boat leaned into the winds of sunrise."|"The Snow Queen"|"Joan D. Vinge"
12:00|noonday|"Moon leaped down into the soft, golden-brown beach sand. Sparks thumped down from the wall behind her, their shadows tangling in the noonday glare. With her eyes fixed on the cluttered stone houses of the village and the boats dropping sail in the bay, she almost darted past the stranger who stood waiting, watching, as they came. Almost—"|"The Snow Queen"|"Joan D. Vinge"
12:00|noon|"Moon remembered a hidden cranny among the rocks on a leeward bay; warm callused hands of stone cupping their shivering bodies as they lay together in love under the bright noon, while the tide whispered far away down the beach. Now, as then, she could feel the strength of the need that bound them together: the heat they made between them that held the cold loneliness of their world at bay. The union of souls that overcame them in the final moment—the height, the wholeness, that nothing else in their world could ever give her. Together they would enter this new life, and at last they would belong to their world as completely as they belonged to each other…. Sparks’s lips brushed her ear; she leaned forward, her arms going around him, again. The boat nosed toward shore, untended."|"The Snow Queen"|"Joan D. Vinge"
00:00|midnight|"An ocean of night. An utter absence of light, and life … a sense of macrocosmic age … an awareness of microcosmic activity … the knowledge that she would never penetrate its secret heart, no matter how often she came back and came back to this midnight void of nothing, nothing at all…."|"The Snow Queen"|"Joan D. Vinge"
00:00|midnight|"But now the string had been cut that kept him bound to the Summer half of his life. Moon was gone. She was gone. There was no reason now for him ever to go home … they would never unravel the tangle they had made of their future now. He would never see her again; he would never lie beside her again, as he had lain beside her for the first time on the braided rug before the hearth, while the wind rattled and wailed through a midnight blackness beyond the walls and Gran slept peacefully in the next room…. The tears came at last, he rolled onto his side and buried them in the soft darkness of his pillow."|"The Snow Queen"|"Joan D. Vinge"
00:00|midnight|"He saw that Fate was not alone, saw her visitor rise from the step in a cloud of midnight-blue veils embroidered with rainbows. He recognized her friend Tiewe—by the veils, he had never seen anything more of her than her ebony hands. He heard the sweet song of her hidden necklace of bells. He had asked Fate why she never showed herself, thinking that she must be disfigured; but Fate had said that it was a custom of her homeworld. He had seen only one or two others like her since, carefully protected by chaperones. Tiewe was uneasy in the presence of men, and he felt a jealous gratification as he realized that she was leaving because she had seen him. Fate had many friends—but there were none who seemed to be anything more than friends to her. He had wondered from time to time about her celibacy."|"The Snow Queen"|"Joan D. Vinge"
00:00|midnight|"“All right, suckers. You’re on your own again.” Tor moved back, hoping for sinuous grace, hoping against hope. Inadvertently revealing more flesh than she had intended to, she bowed her way out of the eerily glowing obstacle course. Hologrammic coin ships and a meteor swarm tangled intangibly in the golden crocheted cap that held her midnight wig under control. The drapery of her silken overalls flashed the blue flame-color of a welding torch; the expanses of skin they left uncovered were a deathly lavender against the darkness."|"The Snow Queen"|"Joan D. Vinge"
00:00|midnight|"“Good … I’m expecting a particularly important visitor tonight. Make certain the inner meeting room is secure, and prepared appropriately. She will be at the side entrance at midnight. See that she isn’t kept waiting.”"|"The Snow Queen"|"Joan D. Vinge"
00:00|midnight|"Tor stopped again, recognizing the emphasis, his recognition of the Source’s midnight caller who had passed this way, too. Arienrhod, the Snow Queen. The Queen had been muffled in a heavy cloak, like her bodyguard; but Tor was a Winter, and she knew her Queen. It surprised her that Herne would know her, too, or care what she was doing here. “She was here to see the Source. Your guess about what they were doing is as good as mine.”"|"The Snow Queen"|"Joan D. Vinge"
00:00|midnight|"“The final Hunt …” Starbuck leaned into a wing of the chair back, playing with his fingers. “You know, I heard something interesting on the Street. I heard the Source had a midnight visitor a few nights back. I heard it was you. And the word is that maybe you’re not ready to see the end of Winter come.” He glanced up. “How’s my hearing?”"|"The Snow Queen"|"Joan D. Vinge"
12:00|Midday|"“Midday, sir. Midday meal is ready … but it’ll keep until you are, sir.” Jerusha heard the knowing smile as the cook shuffled back into the pantry."|"The Snow Queen"|"Joan D. Vinge"
00:00|midnight|"They crested a final hill, cold and aching, and the starport’s muted dawnglow opened out before them like a midnight sun rising. The low dome of the subterranean complex was a vast bruise on the seaward plain, almost a city in its own right; unearthly light suffused its curving surface. There was no sign now of the starships’ landing: the dome’s impervious surface was unbroken by any opening. Away on the sea’s horizon he saw the winking shell-form of unsleeping Carbuncle."|"The Snow Queen"|"Joan D. Vinge"
"ap 01:59"|"one of two"|"Summers—one of two clan groupings on Tiamat; a conservative society whose people reject “modern” technology and worship Tiamat’s omnipresent sea as the Lady, their Goddess/Mother. Mers, like humans, are considered Her sacred creations. Summers rule Tiamat during the roughly 100-year High Summer when Tiamat is inaccessible to offworlders."|"The Snow Queen"|"Joan D. Vinge"
