"ap 01:12"|112|"Dickens had a profound concern for the working class, and especially the countless exploited children who had been forced to work in factories at a young age. Charles’ father, John Dickens, was forced by his creditors into the Marshalsea debtors’ prison in Southwark, London, in 1824. Charles had taken a job just two weeks before his father was sent to Marshalsea. He worked and pawned his mother’s jewelry and family furniture in a local shop on Hampstead Road, not far from the Euston train shed, where he became well known until they had run out of things to sell. His mother and the youngest children then joined John Dickens at Marshalsea (a common occurrence in those days). Charles, then twelve years old, boarded with Elizabeth Roylance, a family friend, at 112 College Place, Camden Town. According to Dickens, she was “a reduced [impoverished] old lady, long known to our family.” Dickens was forced to work in a boot black factory labeling pots of boot black six days a week, from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., for six shillings a week, and was allowed to visit with his family at Marshalsea on Sundays. Child laborers, as he had once been forced to experience firsthand, suffered immensely from ignorance and want."|"Inventing Scrooge"|"Carlo Devito"

"ap 00:10"|"fifty to one"|"“The restlessness of a great city, and the way in which it tumbles and tosses before it can get to sleep, formed one of the first entertainments offered to the contemplation of us houseless people. It lasted about two hours. We lost a great deal of companionship when the late public-houses turned their lamps out, and when the potmen thrust the last brawling drunkards into the street; but stray vehicles and stray people were left us, after that. If we were very lucky, a policeman’s rattle sprang and a fray turned up; but, in general, surprisingly little of this diversion was provided. Except in the Haymarket, which is the worst kept part of London, and about Kent-street in the Borough, and along a portion of the line of the Old Kent-road, the peace was seldom violently broken,” Dickens remarked. “After all seemed quiet, if one cab rattled by, half-a-dozen would surely follow; and Houselessness even observed that intoxicated people appeared to be magnetically attracted towards each other; so that we knew when we saw one drunken object staggering against the shutters of a shop, that another drunken object would stagger up before five minutes were out, to fraternise or fight with it. When we made a divergence from the regular species of drunkard, the thin-armed, puff-faced, leaden-lipped gin-drinker, and encountered a rarer specimen of a more decent appearance, fifty to one but that specimen was dressed in soiled mourning. As the street experience in the night, so the street experience in the day; the common folk who come unexpectedly into a little property, come unexpectedly into a deal of liquor.”"|"Inventing Scrooge"|"Carlo Devito"

They rowed up the river in the summer, and skated upon the ice in the winter. They had holidays too, and Twelfth cakes, and parties, when they danced till midnight.

She and Longfellow read it together after midnight on January 27, 1844, and she presumably spoke for both when she called it “an admirable performance with a true Christmas glow about it, yet very pathetic and poetical besides.” A few days later, in a separate letter, she wrote, “Have you seen Dickens’ ‘Christmas Carol’? He sent it to Felton in its English garb, with capital woodcuts, and a nice clear type! It is a most admirable production I think, and has had great success in England, comforting people for the tediousness of Chuzzlewit. It is evidently written at heart and from the heart, and has a Christmas crackle and glow about it, besides much pathos and poetry of conception, which form a rich combination. The sketch of the poor clerk’s dinner is in his best manner, and almost consoles one for the poverty it reveals.”"|"Inventing Scrooge"|"Carlo Devito"

He did not emerge upon the stage—that is rather too deliberate a word—he strode. He strode—in the most English way and exhibiting the most English general style and appearance—straight across the broad stage, heedless of everything, unconscious of everybody, turning neither to the right nor the left—but striding eagerly straight ahead, as if he had seen a girl he knew turn the next corner."|"Inventing Scrooge"|"Carlo Devito"

(the tour sponsors) what they had lost due to his illness. Twelve final performances were scheduled, running from January 11, 1870, to his last public reading at 8 p.m. on March 15, 1870."|"Inventing Scrooge"|"Carlo Devito"

At 8 p.m. Dickens ascended the stage.
“The largest audience ever assembled in that immense building, the largest, as already intimated, that ever can be assembled there for purely Reading purposes, namely, when the orchestra and the upper end of the two side-galleries have necessarily to be barred or curtained off from the auditorium, were collected together there under the radiant pendants of the glittering ceiling, every available nook and corner, and all the ordinary gangways of the Great Hall being completely occupied,” remembered Charles Kent."|"Inventing Scrooge"|"Carlo Devito"
