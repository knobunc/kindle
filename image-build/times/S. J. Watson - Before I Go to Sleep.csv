"ap 11:30"|"eleven thirty"|"The clock on the mantelpiece chimes and I glance at it. It is old-fashioned, a large dial in a wooden case, edged with roman numerals. It reads eleven thirty. Next to it sits a silver key for winding it, something that I suppose Ben must remember to do every evening. It looks old enough to be an antique, and I wonder how we came to own such a clock. Perhaps it has no history, or none with us at least, but is simply something we saw once, in a shop or on a market stall, and one of us liked it. Probably Ben, I think. I realize I don’t like it."|"Before I Go to Sleep"|"S. J. Watson"
"ap < 11:00"|"almost eleven"|"I look at the clock on the bedside table. It is almost eleven; I must write quickly. I imagine that soon I will hear the TV silenced, a creak of a floorboard as Ben crosses the room, the flick of a light switch. Will he go into the kitchen and make a sandwich or pour himself a glass of water? Or will he come straight to bed? I don’t know. I don’t know his rituals. I don’t know my own."|"Before I Go to Sleep"|"S. J. Watson"
00:00|Midnight|"I hear the clock in the living room chime. Midnight. Ben is coming up the stairs. I will hide this book in the shoebox I have found. I will put it in the wardrobe, right where I have told Dr Nash it will be. Tomorrow, if he rings, I will write more."|"Before I Go to Sleep"|"S. J. Watson"
12:00|noon|"I am writing this at noon. Ben is downstairs, reading. He thinks I am resting but, even though I am tired, I am not. I don’t have time. I have to write this down before I lose it. I have to write my journal."|"Before I Go to Sleep"|"S. J. Watson"
"ap < 01:00"|"just before one o’clock"|"We left the house just before one o’clock. We did not go far, and parked the car by a low, squat building. It looked abandoned; a single grey pigeon sat in each of the boarded windows and the door was hidden with corrugated iron. ‘That’s the lido,’ said Ben as he got out of the car. ‘It’s open in summer, I think. Shall we walk?’"|"Before I Go to Sleep"|"S. J. Watson"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"I could not relax. I thought of my journal and watched the hands of the clock on the mantelpiece creep from nine, to ten, to ten thirty. Finally, as they approached eleven, I realized I would have no more time tonight, and said, ‘I think I’m going to turn in. It’s been a long day.’"|"Before I Go to Sleep"|"S. J. Watson"
"ap 10:30"|"ten thirty"|"I could not relax. I thought of my journal and watched the hands of the clock on the mantelpiece creep from nine, to ten, to ten thirty. Finally, as they approached eleven, I realized I would have no more time tonight, and said, ‘I think I’m going to turn in. It’s been a long day.’"|"Before I Go to Sleep"|"S. J. Watson"
"ap 04:00"|four|"The clock has just chimed four; it is beginning to get dark. Ben will not be home just yet but, as I sit and write, I listen for his car. The shoebox sits on the floor next to my feet, the tissue paper in which this journal was wrapped spilling out of it. If he comes in I will put my book in the wardrobe and tell him I have been resting. It is dishonest, but not terribly so, and there is nothing wrong with wanting to keep the contents of my journal a secret. I must write down what I have seen. What I have learned. But that doesn’t mean I want someone – anyone – to read it."|"Before I Go to Sleep"|"S. J. Watson"
"ap 10:30"|"ten thirty"|"The bedside clock reads ten thirty. I imagine Ben will come to bed soon, but still I sit here on the edge of the bed, writing. I spoke to him after dinner. I had spent the afternoon fretful, pacing from one room to another, looking at everything as if for the first time, wondering why he would so thoroughly remove evidence of even this modest success. It didn’t make sense. Was he ashamed? Embarrassed? Had I written about him, our life together? Or was the reason something worse? Something darker I could not yet see?"|"Before I Go to Sleep"|"S. J. Watson"
12:00|midday|"Dr Nash picked me up at midday. He’d told me to have some lunch first, but I wasn’t hungry. Nervous, I suppose. ‘We’re meeting a colleague of mine,’ he said in the car. ‘Dr Paxton.’ I said nothing. ‘He’s an expert in the field of functional imaging of patients with problems like yours. We’ve been working together.’"|"Before I Go to Sleep"|"S. J. Watson"
00:00|Midnight|"Midnight. I am in bed. Alone. Trying to make sense of all that has happened today. All that I have learned. I don’t know whether I can."|"Before I Go to Sleep"|"S. J. Watson"

"|"Before I Go to Sleep"|"S. J. Watson"
12:00|Midday|"That happened in the early hours of Saturday morning. Today is Sunday. Midday, or thereabouts. A whole day has gone, unrecorded. Twenty-four hours, lost. Twenty-four hours spent believing everything Ben told me. Believing that I have never written a novel, never had a son. Believing it was an accident that robbed me of my past."|"Before I Go to Sleep"|"S. J. Watson"
08:15|"8.15 a.m."|"8.15 a.m., read the first entry. I have woken up. Ben is here. Directly underneath I had written, 8.17 a.m. Ignore that last entry. It was written by someone else, and underneath that, 8.20 I am awake NOW. Before I was not. Ben is here."|"Before I Go to Sleep"|"S. J. Watson"
08:17|"8.17 a.m."|"8.15 a.m., read the first entry. I have woken up. Ben is here. Directly underneath I had written, 8.17 a.m. Ignore that last entry. It was written by someone else, and underneath that, 8.20 I am awake NOW. Before I was not. Ben is here."|"Before I Go to Sleep"|"S. J. Watson"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"‘OK,’ I said.
‘Cool. Friday? I’ll meet you at eleven. Is that OK?’
I told her it was. It would have to be. ‘I’ll be fine,’ I said. She told me which buses I would need and I wrote the details on a slip of paper. Then, after we’d chatted for a few minutes more, we said goodbye and I took out my journal and began to write."|"Before I Go to Sleep"|"S. J. Watson"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"I felt a chill. ‘Ben was vegetarian?’‘Vegan,’ she said, laughing. ‘Don’t tell me you didn’t know?’I thought of the night he’d hit me. A lump of meat, I’d written. Peas floating in thin gravy.I went over to the window. ‘Ben eats meat …’ I said, speaking slowly. ‘He’s not vegetarian … Not now, anyway. Maybe he’s changed?’There was another long silence.‘Claire?’ She said nothing. ‘Claire? Are you there?’‘Right,’ she said. She sounded angry now. ‘I’m ringing him. I’m sorting this out. Where is he?’I answered without thinking. ‘He’ll be at the school, I suppose. He said he wouldn’t be back until five o’clock.’‘At the school?’ she said. ‘Do you mean the university? Is he lecturing now?’Fear began to stir within me. ‘No,’ I said. ‘He works at a school near here. I can’t remember the name.’‘What does he do there?’‘A teacher. He’s head of chemistry, I think he said.’ I felt guilty at not knowing what my husband does for a living, not being able to remember how he earns the money to keep us fed and clothed. ‘I don’t remember.’I looked up and caught sight of my swollen face reflected in the window in front of me. The guilt evaporated.‘What school?’ she asked.‘I don’t know,’ I said. ‘I don’t think he told me.’‘What, never?’‘Not this morning, no,’ I said. ‘For me that might as well be never.’‘I’m sorry, Chrissy. I didn’t mean to upset you. It’s just that, well—’ I sensed a change of mind, a sentence aborted. ‘Could you find out the name of the school?’I thought of the office upstairs. ‘I guess so. Why?’‘I’d like to speak to Ben, to make sure he’ll be coming home when I’m there this afternoon. I wouldn’t want it to be a wasted journey!’I noticed the humour she was trying to inject into her voice, but didn’t mention it. I felt out of control, couldn’t work out what was best, what I should do, and so decided to surrender to my friend. ‘I’ll have a look,’ I said.I went upstairs. The office was tidy, piles of papers arranged across the desk. It did not take long to find some headed paper; a letter about a parents’ evening that had already taken place.‘It’s St Anne’s,’ I said. ‘You want the number?’ She said she’d find it out herself.‘I’ll call you back,’ she said. ‘Yes?’Panic hit again. ‘What are you going to say to him?’ I said.‘I’m going to sort this out,’ she said. ‘Trust me, Chrissy. There has to be an explanation. OK?’‘Yes,’ I said, and ended the call. I sat down, my legs shaking. What if my first hunch had been correct? What if Claire and Ben were still sleeping together? Maybe she was calling him now, warning him. She suspects, she might be saying. Be careful.I remembered reading my journal earlier. Dr Nash had told me that I had once shown symptoms of paranoia. Claiming the doctors were conspiring against you, he’d said. A tendency to confabulate. To invent things.What if that’s all happening again? What if I am inventing this, all of it? Everything in my journal might be fantasy. Paranoia.I thought of what they’d told me on the ward, and Ben in his letter. You were occasionally violent. I realized it might have been me who caused the fight on Friday night. Did I lash out at Ben? Perhaps he hit back and then, upstairs in the bathroom, I took a pen and explained it all away with a fiction.What if all this journal means is that I’m getting worse again? That soon it really will be time for me to go back to Waring House?I went cold, suddenly convinced that this was why Dr Nash had wanted to take me there. To prepare me for my return.All I can do is wait for Claire to call me back."|"Before I Go to Sleep"|"S. J. Watson"
18:55|"6.55 p.m."|"Monday, 26 November, 6.55 p.m.Claire called me after less than half an hour. And now my mind oscillates. It swings from one thing to the other, then back again. I know what to do. I don’t know what to do. I know what to do. But there’s a third thought. I shudder as I realize the truth: I am in danger.I turn to the front of this journal, intending to write Don’t trust Ben, but I find those words are already there.I don’t remember writing them. But then I don’t remember anything."|"Before I Go to Sleep"|"S. J. Watson"
