12:30|"12.30 p.m."|"12.30 p.m. Was Shazzer—finally! Buzzed her in, then darted, freaked-out, back to the window, whilst she clopped across the room to the fridge, dressed in a wildly christening-inappropriate little black dress and Jimmy Choos."|"Bridget Jones's Baby"|"Helen Fielding"
13:04|"1.04 p.m."|"—
1.04 p.m. My car. London. “It’s fine, we’ll be early,” said Shazzer.
It was four minutes after we were supposed to be at the pre-christening drinks at Chislewood House and we were in solid traffic on the Cromwell Road. But in my new car, which you can tell to take you to places and make phone calls and everything."|"Bridget Jones's Baby"|"Helen Fielding"
14:45|"2.45 p.m."|"2.45 p.m. Car park, Nether Stubbly Church, Gloucestershire. OK. Everything is completely fine. Is only fifteen minutes after christening was supposed to commence, and nothing ever starts on time, right? Will be serene, calm and dignified. Will simply ask myself, at any awkward moment, “What would the Dalai Lama do?” And then do it."|"Bridget Jones's Baby"|"Helen Fielding"

7.01 p.m. I’m toxic. I’m emitting man-repellent rays.
7.02 p.m. Right. Pah! I cannot allow emotional matters to influence my professional career.

19:03|"7.03 p.m."|"7.03 p.m. Being a woman in her late thirties with no kids is the hardest time for a woman. It’s a biological kink which I’m sure will be sorted out in years to come. But for now, it’s just torture, the clock ticking louder and louder, men sensing the panic and running for the hills, the sense of time running out—and even if you met someone NOW there still wouldn’t be time for the relationship to run its course and a baby to happen in the natural run of things."|"Bridget Jones's Baby"|"Helen Fielding"
19:05|"7.05 p.m."|"7.05 p.m. Babies: yuk. I am a top professional woman. Every woman has her needs, which I simply fulfil with adult liaisons, almost French in their elegance."|"Bridget Jones's Baby"|"Helen Fielding"

16:00|"4 p.m."|"4 p.m. Just back from baby shopping. Have bought completely adorable peach playsuit with a floral bandana from ILoveGorgeous and laid it out on the bed, for all the world like it is a little baby girl. Almost wonder if could purchase doll baby to dress it up in to practice, but would that be creepy? Am so excited but at the same time find self feeling strangely lazy, sleepy and distracted, almost as if am a bit stoned. Must make sure no one finds out about this at work just yet. Also probably not tell Mum just yet. Also am definitely going to really mentally address the issue of the father. Definitely."|"Bridget Jones's Baby"|"Helen Fielding"
12:00|Noon|"Noon. The Electric Bar, Portobello Road. “You do have to tell them, Bridge,” said Miranda."|"Bridget Jones's Baby"|"Helen Fielding"

19:00|"7 p.m."|"7 p.m. My flat. This is unbearable. I’m pregnant, and Mark wants the baby and if I hadn’t slept with Daniel as well this would be a complete fairy tale and we would all be so happy but…Oh God.

20:10|"8.10 p.m."|"8.10 p.m. Sat down, staring crazily into space with one eye closed and the other open. Was this just about rivalry with Mark Darcy, or did Daniel actually want to be a father?"|"Bridget Jones's Baby"|"Helen Fielding"

8.20 p.m. Just looked back at my diary of Shazzer’s rant:
As women glide from their twenties to thirties, the balance of power subtly shifts. Even the most outrageous minxes lose their nerve, wrestling with the first twinges of existential angst: fears of dying alone and being found three weeks later half eaten by an Alsatian. And men like Richard play on the chink in the armour to wriggle out of commitment, maturity, honour and the natural progression of things between a man and a woman."|"Bridget Jones's Baby"|"Helen Fielding"

4.30 p.m. My flat. Just back from Mark’s house. What just happened?
I waited, nervously, on Mark’s doorstep, but this time he opened the door looking different. He was unshaven, in bare feet, wearing jeans and a very dirty dark sweater, and holding an open bottle of red wine. He looked at me strangely."|"Bridget Jones's Baby"|"Helen Fielding"

9 p.m. Phone call was from Daniel.
“Christ, Jones, did you see that bloodbath? It was an assassination attempt from the start. Bill Sharp’s entire life goal is to prove he’s read The Oxford Dictionary of Incomprehensible Defunct Long Words to Slag People Off With from cover to cover. As for O’Shea: envy, Jones, the green-eyed monster. They had no understanding of the concept…”"|"Bridget Jones's Baby"|"Helen Fielding"

You cool with that?”"|"Bridget Jones's Baby"|"Helen Fielding"
15:00|"3 p.m."|"3 p.m. Dad just came round to take the Magda-gift Bugaboo stroller to put in their garage: “You’ll be better off with a bit more space.
