00:00|midnight|"Locked her bike in the alley and used her phone to let herself into the back of Forever Fab, smelling pancakes and the shrimp rice bowl special from Sushi Barn. Pancakes meant they were printing with that plastic you could compost. Shrimp special was Shaylene’s midnight snack."|"The Peripheral"|"William Gibson"
22:00|"Ten at night"|"Ten at night now, in the kitchen of Lev’s father’s Notting Hill house, his house of art."|"The Peripheral"|"William Gibson"

"ap 07:30"|"seven thirty"|"Leon woke everybody up at seven thirty, to tell them he’d just won ten million dollars in the state lottery, and now their mother was cooking breakfast. She could hear him now, from back in the kitchen."|"The Peripheral"|"William Gibson"
"ap ~ 10:00"|"About ten"|"“Close your eyes. Count down from fifteen. About ten, should be a wobble.”"|"The Peripheral"|"William Gibson"

12:00|noon|"“On your property, about an hour. In here, a little under two minutes. Edward’s up to your house to get a sandwich. Didn’t want to, but he hadn’t eaten since noon and I told him it was the better part of valor.”"|"The Peripheral"|"William Gibson"
"ap 01:02"|one-two|"“Click your teeth together twice, one-two, without opening your mouth. Quiet as possible.”"|"The Peripheral"|"William Gibson"
"ap 11:30"|"eleven thirty"|"Cow?” Flynne asked, surprised, around a mouthful of banana, as the rental crested the high point of Porter, not very high but she knew it from cycling. A perfect day, to look at. Sunny, eleven thirty, headed into town with Janice driving a rented cardboard. Except for Netherton, the night before, telling her the world was ending. Or that it always had been, or something."|"The Peripheral"|"William Gibson"
12:00|noon|"“Enough to buy out all the chili dogs from Jimmy’s, noon and night. They preorder, send drones to pick ’em up. Danny went to Commercial Kitchen Warehouse for new chili pots.” Danny was the man who ran Jimmy’s, a grandnephew of the actual Jimmy, who her mother remembered from when she was little. “He wanted to put his price up, but Burton had Tommy tell him not to. So I think you’re subsidizing the chili dogs, kinda.”"|"The Peripheral"|"William Gibson"

"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"“When do they get here?”
“This evening. But they tend to operate after midnight.”
“You could just meet ’em as they come in and help keep order, Tommy. I don’t see that this has to be your fight.”"|"The Peripheral"|"William Gibson"
14:00|"Two in the afternoon"|"Putney tomorrow, Netherton reminded himself, after ordering a pair of double espressos to take away. Two in the afternoon. His second follow-up appointment. If it was sunny, they’d ride bicycles. He doubted the German PR business would take that long."|"The Peripheral"|"William Gibson"
