02:00|"2 am"|"2 am. Tommy should have been sleeping. For the last two and a half years he hadn’t slept, but he’d always known that it was because he was thinking about his thesis. Now it was finished at last. He had submitted two bound copies, one for each of his examiners, to the Graduate Studies Office. Tradition, and common sense, dictated that candidates keep a third copy for themselves so that they could use it whilst they prepare for their viva voce, the grilling session in front of their examiners and, according to Oxford’s diktats, any members of the public who cared to attend that determined whether they received their doctorate or not. But Tommy was spent. He didn’t want to see his thesis again before the viva, so he had left his third copy in Professor Shaw’s college pigeon hole. He needed to forget it altogether for a month or so, so he felt fresh and enthusiastic again when he started applying for posts."|"The Company of Fellows"|"Dan Holloway"
"> 02:00"|"past two in the morning"|"“Hello,” he said again, not quite sure what else to say to a supervisor calling him at past two in the morning."|"The Company of Fellows"|"Dan Holloway"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"Tommy couldn’t tell if there was a hint of sarcasm in the Professor’s voice, or maybe bitterness. Tommy hadn’t shown his supervisor the final draft, which was very much not the standard procedure. It hadn’t occurred to him that the Professor would take it as a snub. Tommy just knew that he had finished. There was no point in asking anyone else what needed changing. Nothing did. Still, there was something in the voice that he couldn’t explain by the fact that it was two in the morning. A slight hesitation of some kind."|"The Company of Fellows"|"Dan Holloway"
"ap 11:00"|"Eleven o’clock"|"She heard the thick wooden night door in Martyr’s Gate clank metallically shut. Eleven o’clock. Outside the windows, down in Martyr’s Quad, a small group of people staying in college for a conference on the how to put on a better public face for the carbon footprint of the advertising industry was making its way from the bar to the Porter’s Lodge. She could hear laughter approaching, hovering for a moment on the giant york stone slabs outside the window as though it might stay, then moving on into the night. It was the same every night in term time, and the nights like this in the vacation when conferences took over the college. Academics and students alike hated them, of course, resented the fact that even with the vast reserves of property the college owned it still needed their money. The rise and fall of slightly drunken laughter, though, the cadences and pitch of sentences that came easily, were not measured or considered, were not structured to impress, all of that was white noise that made the vacation nighttimes bearable."|"The Company of Fellows"|"Dan Holloway"
12:00|midday|"“Delighted,” said Tommy, taking his hand warmly. There had definitely been a glimmer of something that may have been recognition when Knightley heard his name. Tommy could feel the doctor’s eyes screwing into him, trying to figure out why he wanted to be introduced and why he was so friendly with Becky. The eyes were dull, though, and it was obvious that the doctor had found nothing. From the red thread veins on his nose and cheeks, Tommy thought that Stephen Knightley had probably been drunk by midday many times in the years since Becky’s birth."|"The Company of Fellows"|"Dan Holloway"
16:00|"4 in the afternoon"|"“What time is it?” Tommy asked.
“It really must be bad. It’s 4 in the afternoon, Tommy.”
Tommy blinked. She was right. It was light. His cotton shone white and clean, the paint on his ceiling was ocean-clear petrol blue. It was still day and the city and the screams were receding already. “OK,” he said. “Where do you want to go?”"|"The Company of Fellows"|"Dan Holloway"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"“Yes I did know that,” the lawyer said evenly. “From why Susan said you’ve called I’m guessing it was Professor Shaw’s business he was on. I can’t tell you much at the moment I’m afraid. We’re still trying to tie up some loose ends with his estate, but I’ll tell you what I can. I have half an hour free at ten. Do you want to meet somewhere?”"|"The Company of Fellows"|"Dan Holloway"
00:00|midnight|"“Well, I suppose the basic problem he saw is the one that the church has had problems with for centuries, the problem of the so-called innocent child. You know the rather tedious questions, where do they go when they die? Heaven, or limbo as our Catholic friends used to have it? Are they innocent at all or are they all tainted with original sin? And if they are innocent, when do they cease to be and start to be guilty? Standard problem cases. Two fifteen year-olds having sex. At midnight one of them turns 16 and becomes a paedophile. Thompson and Venables murder James Bulger and people want them strung up, yet if someone had a quick fiddle in their trousers they’d have been poor victims. Rather banal stuff that, frankly, Philip Pullman did rather better.”"|"The Company of Fellows"|"Dan Holloway"
"ap 05:00"|"5 o’clock"|"It was already 5 o’clock. He pulled on a thick polo neck but he was still shaking. He couldn’t get the image out of his head. Dead eyes looking at him from under a cheap red fringe. Not Becky’s eyes. He didn’t know whose they were, where he had seen them; whether he ever had seen them."|"The Company of Fellows"|"Dan Holloway"
"ap 05:00"|"Five o’clock"|"“Great. Five o’clock at mine unless you tell me that you have to wait for results from the path lab.” He flicked through the post. There were a couple of catalogues for some new Chinese silks. Can’t they be bothered to send some real cloth? he thought. It would probably weighs less and cost them less than thick glossy paper and bad Photoshop."|"The Company of Fellows"|"Dan Holloway"
"ap 02:30"|"half past two"|"Tommy had time for a good workout and a relaxing bath. He had decided that he would do nothing before he headed to Spain. He’d still have to be up by half past two to get round the M25 and make check-in, but the way he was, or wasn’t, sleeping at the moment, the thought wasn’t unduly worrying. The thought of being away for a night or two was also good. The one thing that having time to think did mean was that he had time to realise just how serious his position was. The sooner he got out of the country, the sooner he’d get away from danger. He thought for a moment that he shouldn’t be thinking like that, worrying about himself. But, at least until now, Becky seemed safe. Whoever had killed Shaw knew that it was Tommy that was on their trail. As soon as he thought it, he realised what that also meant. If they knew that much about what he was up to, quite possibly they knew his next move would be to Spain. Suddenly even the soothing heat of Andalucia seemed less of a haven. He had to face up to the fact that nothing was going to feel great until this was all over.."|"The Company of Fellows"|"Dan Holloway"
"ap 02:00"|two|"“No. I think I hardly know him.” With the hand that was around her waist he lifted her out of the chair and turned her to face him. He ran his eyes over the lines of her face, not embarrassed any longer. His fingers followed, and then his lips. “I have to leave at two tomorrow morning,” he said, realising there was never going to be a perfect moment to break it to her."|"The Company of Fellows"|"Dan Holloway"
12:00|midday|"It was still only midday when Tommy reached the centre of Jerez, and the heat temperature was rising into the mid thirties. He parked his bike at the Hotel Doña Blanca on the Calle Bodegas, just a hundred metres or so from the Calle Caballeros, where Shaw had lived in the heart of the old town for two years. An unlikely bolt hole, Tommy thought, in the hubbub of such a close community. He checked in, washed the sand off his face and took a couple of puffs of Number One from his little atomiser before heading out into the sun in streets empty for siesta, perfect for catching people at home. He had a photo of Shaw in his top pocket, sketchbook and pencil in his chinos, and a plan to knock on some doors, but that was about it. When the town reopened he would ask shopkeepers if the elegant Englishman ever shopped there. He didn’t think people would forget someone so striking as Charles Shaw, even after this much time. And if they remembered him then the answer to the question he really wanted to ask would be easier still: did he have a young child with him?"|"The Company of Fellows"|"Dan Holloway"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"It was four o’clock by the time Tommy had asked enough questions to know that he wasn’t going to get any further with the door to door approach. The streets were alive with the sound of people talking and shopping, youngsters zig-zagging on their scooters and groups of tourists milling and snapping. The sun was below the halfway point in the sky and buildings and trees glowed as though they were coated in a fine gold varnish. He headed into the Plaza del Arenal, where tables spilled into the square, golden beers shining amber in the sunlight, vast boards with pictures of hundreds of different tapas that waiters would point at with one hand for the benefit of the tourists as they steered them into a table with the other. Tommy thought it would probably be easier to resist their patter than the eager insistence of Spanish matriarchs but he was beginning to get hungry so he simply smiled, sat down at the nearest table, and ordered prawn croquettas and beer."|"The Company of Fellows"|"Dan Holloway"
