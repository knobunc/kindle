"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"Eco, one of the messengers chosen by INCLITO.
Evensong, the concubine who stowed away on INCANTO'S boat.
FAVA, a houseguest at INCLITO'S, MORA'S playmate."|"In Green's Jungles"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"INCLITO, the leading citizen of BLANKO.
JAHLEE, the first of the inhumi rescued by INCANTO and Evensong.
Lieutenant Karabin, a mercenary officer."|"In Green's Jungles"|"Gene Wolfe"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"""You think I want you to eat in my sewers."" He chuckled again. ""In my house. All right? Seven. You can come at seven?"""|"In Green's Jungles"|"Gene Wolfe"
"ap 06:00"|six|"Inclito laughed; he has a good, loud, booming laugh. ""I show you my sewers if he does. One I got never gets wet. Would make a good place to sleep. I pick you up at six, all right? Where you're staying."""|"In Green's Jungles"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"War came. Casco was rich enough to ride a fine horse, so he became a cavalryman. He rode out to see me one last time before he went away to fight. It was about noon, I think, and I had been lying down in my room. I can hear his knock, even now, and our old servant grumbling to herself as she goes to answer it. I knew who it was without looking and got up and went out to speak to him. ""I will come back to you,"" he told me, ""and I tell you now that if your sneaking, lying Turco is with you, I will lay his body at your feet. You have been warned."""|"In Green's Jungles"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"War looms-not only for Blanko, but for me. To give myself due credit, I never imagined that by leaving Evensong and her pretty little boat on the Nadi I would throw them off indefinitely. A week? Ten days, perhaps, although it seemed much longer. Very well, I have fought them before, and in place of a slug gun and the black-bladed sword I have Hyacinth's azoth. Let them beware."|"In Green's Jungles"|"Gene Wolfe"
00:00|midnight|"I have drawn the three whorls just as I used to in Gaon. Not because I have been away, or slept, or made love to any woman. No, merely because I ceased writing for an hour or so to play with Oreb and wrestle my conscience. But midnight has come and gone-I heard the clocks strike."|"In Green's Jungles"|"Gene Wolfe"
"> 12:00"|"a little after midday"|"I rose, and leaving the dead woman in her coffin opened the door and walked out into the whorl. It was a little after midday then, as well as I could judge from the narrowing line of the Long Sun."|"In Green's Jungles"|"Gene Wolfe"
00:00|midnight|"Bello added that we had marched until midnight to do it, and had risen the next morning with the Short Sun."|"In Green's Jungles"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 15:00"|"about three that afternoon"|"Vivo said, ""My men and I left Blanko about three that afternoon. That's how we were able to catch up with Incanto when he stopped here. The rest wanted to wait and start in the morning, and I guess they did."""|"In Green's Jungles"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 00:00"|"about midnight"|"""General Inclito said to get in as close as we could, sir,"" Valico continued, ""and see how they were treating you, and to try to get you out if we could. We waited till about midnight before we started off, me and six men."""|"In Green's Jungles"|"Gene Wolfe"
"> 00:00"|"After midnight"|"* * *
After midnight, and so a new day.
My visitor arrived. It was Sfido. We talked for an hour or more, and managed with all our talk to rouse my host's wife, who had abandoned the celebration and wisely taken to her bed. She has found a bed for him, and warmed a bowl of the bean soup. He said that he was too tired to eat, but looked half starved and managed to finish the whole bowl quickly enough, dipping the soft white bread that is so much valued here into it and eating like a lost hound."|"In Green's Jungles"|"Gene Wolfe"
00:00|Midnight|"Midnight, I suppose, but I cannot sleep. The woman in the boat arrived just after I wrote about Perito. I knew it could not be long then, and supposed that it would be under an hour."|"In Green's Jungles"|"Gene Wolfe"
"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"I told her we were fine, much better off than those who had fought so gallantly and lacked the comfort of her roof. She thanked me and began moving about the room, straightening small items as women will, snuffling to herself and coughing much as I do, but moving (although it did not strike me at the time) gracefully nonetheless, so that I was reminded vaguely of you, Nettle; and then more vaguely still of Evensong, Tansy, Seawrack, Hyacinth, and various others-or perhaps simply of all the women-or of all the young women, at least-that I have known at various times in diverse places, and fell to thinking (as I pulled off my boots and removed my robe) that it was a pity, a great pity, that we had no daughter-although it was so often all that we could do to feed the children we had, boys but good boys all of them, at least until Sinew was older."|"In Green's Jungles"|"Gene Wolfe"
12:02|"two past noon"|"I gave him a little lift by raising the handle of my stick, and he flapped upward, vanishing almost at once against the dark sky. It was only an hour or two past noon; but quite dark, as it almost always is when it snows. The fireworks would show up well, I thought, unless the snow had wet them-in which case they would not show up at all."|"In Green's Jungles"|"Gene Wolfe"
12:00|noon|"""He's a night chough,"" I explained to the Duko. ""Don't worry about him, He can see in the dark much better than you and I can at noon."""|"In Green's Jungles"|"Gene Wolfe"
12:00|midday|"I opened the leather burse that Volanta gave me when we left Blanko, found the piece of Soldese flatbread I had put there before setting out, and struck by the idea of sharing the simple meal we shared with our prisoners at midday, climbed down and fetched the last of my wine from my saddlebag. The second climb should have been worse than the first, yet it was not. I was tired, my ankle pained me; and my fingers, which had been cold from the beginning, were colder than ever. But all the emptiness I had felt when I had tried to pray, had vanished so completely I could almost believe they had never been. I was happy and more, and if an old instructor had appeared and demanded to know the reason for my joy, I would only have laughed at him for needing causes and explanations in so simple a matter. I was alive, and the Outsider who knows very well what sort of creature I am-cared about me in spite of all."|"In Green's Jungles"|"Gene Wolfe"
