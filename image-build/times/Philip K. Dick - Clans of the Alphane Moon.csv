"ap ~ 05:00"|"around five o’clock"|"To the two CIA men Joan Trieste said, “I can stay with him for a while, at least. Unless I get an emergency call. There’s usually one at around five o’clock, when the heavy commuter traffic starts. But until—”"|"Clans of the Alphane Moon"|"Philip K. Dick"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"“If someone wants to kill himself,” Chuck said, “you can’t stop him. Maybe you can delay it. Maybe a Psi like Joan here can drag him back. But even if he’s delayed he’ll do it, and even if he’s brought back he’ll find a way to do it again. So leave me alone.” He felt tired. “I’ve got a four o’clock appointment with my attorney—I’ve got many things to do. I can’t stand around talking.”"|"Clans of the Alphane Moon"|"Philip K. Dick"
10:00|"ten A.M."|"Alfson said, “Keep calm, Miss Trieste. I’m your paramour’s wife’s attorney; we need evidence for the litigation which, by the way—” He glanced at Chuck. “Is on the court calendar for next Monday at ten A.M. in Judge Brizzolara’s courtroom.” He smiled. “We had it moved up; your wife wants it accomplished as soon as possible.”"|"Clans of the Alphane Moon"|"Philip K. Dick"
12:00|mid-day|"Beside her the young CIA agent, Dan Mageboom, said, “Your diagnosis, then, is hebephrenia? I can report that back officially?” Taking her by the arm he assisted her over the remains of some major animal carcass; in the mid-day sun the ribs stuck up like tines of a great curved fork."|"Clans of the Alphane Moon"|"Philip K. Dick"
21:00|"nine P.M."|"Putting the Daniel Mageboom simulacrum on homeostasis, Chuck Rittersdorf switched himself out of the circuit, rose stiffly from the seat before the control panel and lit a cigarette. It was nine P.M. local time."|"Clans of the Alphane Moon"|"Philip K. Dick"
03:00|"three A.M."|"When, late that night, Chuck Rittersdorf wearily returned to his rundown conapt in Marin County, California, he was stopped in the hall by the yellow Ganymedean slime mold. This, at three A.M. It was too much."|"Clans of the Alphane Moon"|"Philip K. Dick"
"ap > 04:00"|"past four o’clock"|"“You rascals,” Chuck said as he fixed himself coffee in the kitchen. The time was now past four o’clock; however thanks to the illegal stimulants which Lord Running Clam had provided him he felt no fatigue. “Always listening in,” he said. “Don’t you have a life of your own?”"|"Clans of the Alphane Moon"|"Philip K. Dick"
"ap 07:30"|seven-thirty|"For several hours he wrote, marveling at the efficiency of the illegal hexo-amphetamine stimulants; he felt no fatigue—in fact, he worked more swiftly than had been his custom in times past. At seven-thirty, with the street outside touched by the long, golden rays of the morning sun, he rose stiffly, walked into the kitchen and began to prepare himself breakfast. Now for my other job, he said to himself. At eight-thirty, off to the CIA building in San Francisco. And Daniel Mageboom."|"Clans of the Alphane Moon"|"Philip K. Dick"

"ap 08:20"|"twenty minutes after eight"|"At twenty minutes after eight, as he was shaving in the bathroom, he heard the vidphone ring. His first call since having it installed."|"Clans of the Alphane Moon"|"Philip K. Dick"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"He got the girl’s address, shakily hung up the vidphone, then at once packaged up the pages of the script for Bunny Hentman. On his way to San Francisco he put the envelope in the rocket express mail and that was that. While he worked at his CIA job he probably could dream up dialogue for Miss Weaver; by dinner time he would be ready to get it down on paper and by eight o’clock he would have the actual pages to show her. Things, he decided, are not going so badly after all. Certainly this is a vast improvement over my nightmarish life with Mary."|"Clans of the Alphane Moon"|"Philip K. Dick"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"London said, “If CIA’s theory is correct Hentman will have no use for you the moment he learns that you’ve been denied access to the Mageboom simulacrum. So I would say that in roughly twelve hours—” London examined his wristwatch. “That, say, by nine tonight you’ll discover the unpleasant fact that you have no employment at all. And then, I think, you’ll be a trifle more cooperative with us; you’ll be glad to revert to your former status of holding one job here, period.” London opened his office door, ushering Chuck out. “By the way,” he continued, “would you care to name your source of supply of your drugs?”"|"Clans of the Alphane Moon"|"Philip K. Dick"
15:00|"three that afternoon"|"He began to work. And, by three that afternoon, he had finished; he rose creakily, stretched and felt the weariness of his body. But his mind was lucid. So they bugged my apt, he said to himself. With both audio and video aids. Aloud, for the benefit of the tap, he said, “Those bastards at the office—spying on me. Pathological. Frankly it’s a relief to be out of that atmosphere of suspicion and—” He ceased; what was the use? He went into the kitchen and fixed lunch."|"Clans of the Alphane Moon"|"Philip K. Dick"
"ap 04:00"|four|"At four, dressed in his best Titanian rouzleweave blue and black suit, powdered, shaved and dabbed with such masculine scents as only the modern chemistry lab could produce, he set off on foot, seeking a jet cab, the manuscript under his arm; he was on his way to Santa Monica and Patty Weaver’s conapt, to— heaven only knew. But he had great hopes."|"Clans of the Alphane Moon"|"Philip K. Dick"
"ap > 05:00"|"after five o’clock"|"An hour later, slightly after five o’clock, the cab began to descend to the roof field of Patty Weaver’s remarkably handsome, large and stylish new conapt building. This is the big time, Chuck said to himself. Hobnobbing with a breast-heavy TV starlet… what more could he ask?"|"Clans of the Alphane Moon"|"Philip K. Dick"
"ap > 08:00"|"after eight o’clock"|"“I’m in Santa Monica,” he said. At least he assumed he still was; he had no memory of a ride back up to the Bay Area. And it did not feel much later… or did it? He examined his wristwatch. Two hours had passed; it was now after eight o’clock. “I can’t believe it,” he said, “but this morning I was suspended by the CIA as a security risk and now—”"|"Clans of the Alphane Moon"|"Philip K. Dick"
"ap 06:00"|six|"After he had hung up he stood in the phone booth smoking and meditating. His brain was beginning to clear now, and he wondered what he had done between the hours of six and eight. His legs felt stiff, aching with fatigue; perhaps he had been walking. Up and down the streets of Santa Monica, with no destination, no plans."|"Clans of the Alphane Moon"|"Philip K. Dick"

"ap 04:20"|"Four hours and twenty minutes"|"Four hours and twenty minutes later, physically wearied by his travel but mentally alert, even keyed-up, he reached the rubbish-strewn outskirts of Gandhi-town; he smelled the odor of the settlement, the sweet smell of rot mixed with the acrid stench of countless small fires."|"Clans of the Alphane Moon"|"Philip K.
