Prior was being histrionic. And perhaps I was, Prior
thought, staring into the glass at the row of empty cubicles behind him,
feeling 'the worst things' crowd in behind him, jostling for the privilege of
breathing down his neck. He'd even, coming to himself at four or five o'clock
in the morning with no idea of how the night had been spent,
thought it possible he might have killed somebody. And yet, why should that be
'the worst thing'? His reflection stared back at him, hollow-eyed. Murder was
only killing in the wrong place."|"The Ghost Road"|"Pat Barker"

'It was all right. It just... he happens to represent
everything in England that isn't worth fighting for. Which made him a
rather bracing companion.' He glanced at his watch. 'I'd better be
going. I'm catching the midnight train.'"|"The Ghost Road"|"Pat Barker"
12:00|midday|"There were only two items of furniture that went with
the house. One was a vast carved oak sideboard that must surely have been built
in the dining-room, for it could never have been brought in through the door;
the other was a child's painted rocking-horse on the top floor of the house, in
a room with bars at the window. Everything else they found for themselves.
Prior moved in and out of the ruined houses, taking whatever caught his eye,
and the houses, cool and dark in the midday heat,
received him placidly. He brought his trophies home and arranged them carefully
in his room, or in the dining-room they all shared."|"The Ghost Road"|"Pat Barker"
"< 12:00"|"near noon"|"A solemnity had settled over the gathering. Rivers
watched the movement of muscles in the back ahead of him, as they toiled and
sweated up the slope. Before them was a massive rock-wall with a cave set into
it, like a dark mouth. They slipped and slithered up towards it, sending
showers of small pebbles peppering down behind them. The final slope was
encumbered with big rocks and boulders, and other, flatter stones, some of them
sharp. It was near noon, and their shadows had dwindled to ragged black shapes
fluttering around their moving feet. One of the men picked up a stone and threw
it at the cave mouth to scare away the ghosts. Rivers and Hocart were the only
people there never to have visited the cave before, and they were not allowed
to approach until Njiru had prayed that they might be protected from disease.
While the prayer went on they watched the others bob down and disappear under
the hanging wall of rock."|"The Ghost Road"|"Pat Barker"
"> 12:00"|"past noon"|"The sun beat down the moment they left the cave. It was
past noon, but the hard bright white rocks reflected heat into their faces.
They walked more slowly on the way back, Rivers intensely aware of Njiru
walking just ahead of him, though they did not speak. Near the village they
began, by mutual consent, to lag behind the others. Hocart turned to wait, but
Rivers waved him on."|"The Ghost Road"|"Pat Barker"
"ap 04:00"|"Four o'clock"|"He sat on the edge of the bed, peering at his watch.
Four o'clock, never a good time to wake. His throat was very sore. He swallowed
several times, and decided what was needed was that good old medical stand-by,
a glass of water."|"The Ghost Road"|"Pat Barker"
04:00|"four a.m."|"In the bathroom he blinked in the white light, caught
a glimpse of himself in the looking-glass and thought, My God, is this really
what you've done to yourself? He took a moment to contemplate baggy eyes and
thinning hair, but he wasn't sunk so deep in neurosis or narcissism as to
believe an overhead light at four a.m. lays bare the soul. He drank a glass of
water and went back to bed."|"The Ghost Road"|"Pat Barker"
12:00|noon|"At dawn they were woken by the screams of pigs being
slaughtered, and all morning columns of smoke had risen from the cooking fires.
It was noon before the ceremony started, the sun crashing down on shoulders and
heads, the heat intensified by two fires, the sacrificial fire on the hearth in
front of the skull house, and the common fire where Rivers and Hocart sat along
with people from the village and the surrounding hamlets. Rivers looked out for
the small captive boy, but could not see him. Beside him Lembu was plaiting a
creeper which he used to tie Ngea's jaw-bone to his skull, before placing a
diadem of shells round the cranium and other shells in the sockets of the eyes."|"The Ghost Road"|"Pat Barker"
"ap 05:00"|five|"Kundaite could interpret talk blong tomate: the
language of ghosts. Sometimes, he said, a meeting was held on the night the old
ghosts arrived to take the new ghost back to Sonto with them, and he would
question the ghosts and the people would hear them speak. Would this be done
for Ngea? Rivers asked. Kundaite didn't know, he wasn't sure, he didn't think
so. Would it be done if we give you ten sticks of tobacco? Kundaite nodded. He
was given five and promised the other five the following morning. Would they
hear Ngea speak? Hocart asked. No, was the reply. 'Ngea he no speak yet. He all same small fellow
piccanini.' Kundaite, grasping his tobacco sticks, seemed to be worried.
'Don't tell Njiru,' he said at last."|"The Ghost Road"|"Pat Barker"
"ap 05:43"|5.43|"There is to
be no retirement under any circumstances. That was the order. They have tied us to the stake,
we cannot fly, but bear-like we must fight the course. The men were silent,
staring straight ahead into the mist. Talk, even in whispers, was forbidden.
Prior looked at his watch, licked dry lips, watched
the second hand crawl to the quarter hour. All around him was a tension of held
breath. 5.43. Two more minutes. He crouched further down, whistle clenched
between his teeth."|"The Ghost Road"|"Pat Barker"
"ap 06:25"|6.25|"Rivers reached the bedside before the family realized
he was gone, closed the one eye, and from sheer force of habit looked at his
watch.
'6.25,' he said, addressing Sister Roberts.
He raised the sheet as far as Hallet's chin, arranged
his arms by his sides and withdrew silently, leaving the family alone with
their grief, wishing, as he pulled the screens more closely together, that he
had not seen the young girl turn aside to hide her expression of relief."|"The Ghost Road"|"Pat Barker"
