The midnight freight had come in a few minutes before; and he was peering in one end of the restaurant window, the end nearest the depot, shading his eyes with his hand and blinking against the light. He saw me watching him, and his face faded back into the shadows. But I knew he was still there. I knew he was waiting. The bums always size me up for an easy mark."|"The Killer Inside Me"|"Jim Thompson"

‘At ten o’clock,’ I nodded.
There were twenty-five twenties in the roll. Five  hundred dollars. Now that I had it, it was welcome; I could always use a little extra money. But I hadn’t planned on touching Elmer. I’d only done it to shut him up about my motives in helping him."|"The Killer Inside Me"|"Jim Thompson"

I was kind of sick to my stomach, and I felt, well, pretty damned sore, angry. Things shouldn’t have turned out this way. It was just plumb unreasonable. It wasn’t right."|"The Killer Inside Me"|"Jim Thompson"

He wouldn’t drink any coffee or eat. Instead, he started hitting the whiskey again; and when we left the hotel he took a full bottle with him. By the time I got him on the train, I was as frazzled as a cow’s hide under a branding  iron. I wondered what in the name of God Conway had said to him."|"The Killer Inside Me"|"Jim Thompson"

There’d be all sorts of things to attend to, and discuss - God, how they’d have to be discussed! even the size of the douche bag to take along on our honeymoon!
