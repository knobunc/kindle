As a counterpoint to the chilly Montana evening, the staff decorated the place in a Hawaiian motif. Around 9:00 p.m., thirty or forty people—employees and their families, mostly—were chatting, playing party games, and sipping beverages from red plastic cups in a room overlooking the parking lot when a shiny Chrysler 300 sedan pulled up and rolled to a stop in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows, attracting the attention of the revelers. Two well-dressed men with dour expressions got out of the vehicle and stood beside it. “It was a really nice black car,” recalls Kevin Huguet, the owner of Office Solutions."|Missoula|"Jon Krakauer"

Upon arriving at Donaldson’s house, at around 10:00 in the evening, they were happy to see many of their childhood soul mates. “When we walked downstairs I immediately ran into Beau and hugged him,” Huguet remembered. “It was a nice evening. Everyone was relaxed and having a good time.” People played beer pong in the basement and held “tea races” to determine who could chug bottles of Twisted Tea (a brand of syrupy malt liquor favored by UM students) the fastest."|Missoula|"Jon Krakauer"

Donaldson and Huguet sat down together on a couch. Huguet, growing sleepy, lay across the couch, put a pillow on Donaldson’s thigh, and placed her head on the pillow. But there was nothing remotely sexual about it, said Huguet and Williams. “Allison never had any interest in that type of relationship with Beau,” Williams insisted. “Absolutely none.”"|Missoula|"Jon Krakauer"

I went from never thinking about the rape and believing I was no longer affected by it to realizing that it had been having a huge effect on me all along. I realized that Beau had all this power over how I felt, and I didn’t want him to have that power anymore.

The four students went indoors, poured themselves shots of 99-proof schnapps, and were soon joined by three other members of the UM football team. Belnap didn’t know any of the men except Styron and his roommate. The five Griz players began competing to drink the most, and they encouraged the two women to join them. “Every couple of minutes we would all take another shot,” Belnap told me. “It was a ‘Let’s see if you can keep up’ kind of thing.

Two and a half hours after she’d stopped drinking, her blood alcohol concentration was measured to be 0.219 percent, nearly three times the legal limit for driving.

For several minutes, the three of them tried to open the door, without success, and as they struggled with the lock, the crying and screaming from inside the room continued.

A handsome, stately building constructed in 1910 from quarried sandstone blocks, it’s crowned by a domed clock tower visible from miles away. As Allison Huguet and her family walked from their car to the courthouse doors shortly before 9:00 on the morning of January 11, 2013, an overnight blizzard had abated, but the storm had left five inches of fresh snow on the ground and the temperature was seventeen degrees Fahrenheit. Up on the third floor, when Judge Karen Townsend said, “Please be seated everybody,” the large courtroom was overflowing with Missoulians who’d come to learn Beau Donaldson’s fate. His supporters, including family members and Griz teammates, filled the seats in the eastern half of the room; most of Allison Huguet’s supporters sat on the other side. Everyone was in uncomfortably close proximity. The air was stale, and the tension in the courtroom was palpable."|Missoula|"Jon Krakauer"
