days, fell at last to -33°."|"The Voyages and Adventures of Captain Hatteras"|"Jules Verne"
"ap 06:30"|"half past six"|"These
preparations were interrupted by the need of sleep and rest, which
they felt at seven o'clock in the evening; but before going to bed
they gathered around the stove, which was well filled with fuel, and
these poor men luxuriated in more warmth than they had enjoyed for a
long time; some pemmican, a few biscuits, and several cups of coffee
soon put them in good-humor, especially when their hopes had been so
unexpectedly lighted up. At seven in the morning they resumed work,
and finished it at three in the afternoon. It was already growing
dark. Since January 31st the sun had appeared above the horizon, but
it gave only a pale and brief light; fortunately the moon would rise
at half past six, and with this clear sky it would make their path
plain. The temperature, which had been growing lower for several
days, fell at last to -33°."|"The Voyages and Adventures of Captain Hatteras"|"Jules Verne"

seven o'clock in the evening"|"Towards
seven o'clock in the evening, the moon peered through mist on the
horizon. Its rays threw out a light which was reflected from the ice;
towards the northwest the ice-field looked like a perfectly smooth
plain; not a hummock was to be seen. This part of the sea seemed to
have frozen smooth like a lake."|"The Voyages and Adventures of Captain Hatteras"|"Jules Verne"
"~ 20:00"|"about eight o'clock in the evening"|"Finally
the little band halted at about eight o'clock in the evening, after
walking nearly fifteen miles; the weather was dry; the tent was
raised, the fire lighted, supper cooked, and all rested peacefully."|"The Voyages and Adventures of Captain Hatteras"|"Jules Verne"
"~ 14:30"|"about half past two in the
afternoon"|"These
thoughts kept him busy all day; that evening they encamped as usual,
and each one took his turn at watching near these unknown lands. The
next day, Sunday, after a heavy breakfast of bear's paws, which were
very good, the travellers pushed on to the north, inclining a little
to the west; the road grew difficult, but yet they advanced rapidly.
Altamont, from the top of the sledge, scanned the horizon with
feverish attention; his companions were the victims of involuntary
uneasiness. The last solar observations gave them latitude 83°
35', and longitude 120° 15'; that was the place where the
American ship was said to be lying; the question of life and death
was to be solved that day. At last, at about half past two in the
afternoon, Altamont stood straight, stopped the little band by a loud
cry, and, pointing with his hand to a white mass, which all the rest
had taken for an iceberg, he cried with a loud voice,--"|"The Voyages and Adventures of Captain Hatteras"|"Jules Verne"
16:00|"four o'clock in the afternoon"|"At
four o'clock in the afternoon the five travellers were installed as
comfortably as possible between decks; by means of spars and
fragments of masts, Bell had made a nearly level floor; there they
placed coverings stiffened by the frost, which the heat of the stove
soon brought back to their natural state; Altamont, leaning on the
doctor, was able to make his way to the corner which had been set
aside for him; on setting foot on his ship, he had sighed with a
feeling of relief, which did not encourage the boatswain."|"The Voyages and Adventures of Captain Hatteras"|"Jules Verne"
12:00|noon|"Altamont,
who was still too feeble to get to work, was left on board of his
ship, and the two Englishmen set foot on the mainland. The weather
was thick and stormy; at noon the thermometer stood at -11°, but,
there being no wind, that temperature was comfortable. Judging from
the outline of the shore, a large sea, at that time wholly frozen,
stretched out farther than eye could reach in the west; on the east
it was limited by a rounded coast, cut into by numerous estuaries,
and rising suddenly about two hundred yards from the shore; it formed
a large bay, full of dangerous rocks, on which the Porpoise had been
wrecked; far off on the land rose a mountain, which the doctor
conjectured to be about three thousand feet high. Towards the north a
promontory ran into the sea, after hiding a part of the bay. An
island of moderate size rose from the field of ice, three miles from
the mainland, so that it offered a safe anchorage to any ship that
could enter the bay. In a hollow cut of the shore was a little inlet,
easily reached by ships, if this part of the arctic seas was ever
open. Yet, according to the accounts of Beecher and Penny, this whole
sea was open in the summer months."|"The Voyages and Adventures of Captain Hatteras"|"Jules Verne"
05:00|"five o'clock in
the morning"|"And
yet only one could command. To be sure, Hatteras had all the right of
commanding, by virtue of anterior right and superior force. But if
one was at the head of his own men, the other was on board of his own
ship. And that was generally felt. Either from policy or
instinctively, Altamont was at first attracted towards the doctor; it
was to him he owed his life, but it was sympathy rather than
gratitude which moved him. This was the invariable effect of
Clawbonny's nature; friends grew about him like wheat under the
summer sun. Every one has heard of people who rise at five o'clock in
the morning to make enemies; the doctor could have got up at four
without doing it. Nevertheless, he resolved to profit by Altamont's
friendship to the extent of learning the real reason of his presence
in the polar seas. But with all his wordiness the American answered
without answering, and kept repeating what he had to say about the
Northwest Passage. The doctor suspected that there was some other
motive for the expedition, the same, namely, that Hatteras suspected.
Hence he resolved not to let the two adversaries discuss the subject;
but he did not always succeed. The simplest conversations threatened
to wander to that point, and any word might kindle a blaze of
controversy. It happened soon. When the house was finished, the
doctor resolved to celebrate the fact by a splendid feast; this was a
good idea of Clawbonny's, who wanted to introduce in this continent
the habits and pleasures of European life. Bell had just shot some
ptarmigans and a white rabbit, the first harbinger of spring. This
feast took place April 14, Low Sunday, on a very pleasant day; the
cold could not enter the house, and if it had, the roaring stoves
would have soon conquered it. The dinner was good; the fresh meat
made an agreeable variety after the pemmican and salt meat; a
wonderful pudding, made by the doctor's own hand, was much admired;
every one asked for another supply; the head cook himself, with an
apron about his waist and a knife hanging by his side, would not have
disgraced the kitchen of the Lord High Chancellor of England. At
dessert, liquors appeared; the American was not a teetotaler; hence
there was no reason for his depriving himself of a glass of gin or
brandy; the other guests, who were never in any way intemperate,
could permit themselves this infraction of their rule; so, by the
doctor's command, each one was able to drain a glass at the end of
the merry meal. When a toast was drunk to the United States, Hatteras
was simply silent. It was then that the doctor brought forward an
interesting subject."|"The Voyages and Adventures of Captain Hatteras"|"Jules Verne"

and Johnson had waited for the three hunters with some uneasiness.
When they returned they were delighted to find a warm and comfortable
shelter. That evening the temperature had decidedly fallen, and the
thermometer outside stood at -31°. The three were very much
fatigued and almost frozen, so that they could hardly drag one foot
after the other; fortunately the stoves were drawing well; the doctor
became cook, and roasted a few walrus cutlets. At nine o'clock they
all five sat down before a nourishing supper."|"The Voyages and Adventures of Captain Hatteras"|"Jules Verne"

they ascended the hill to the east, went about the lighthouse, and

descended towards the shore so as to reach the ice in Victoria Bay."|"The Voyages and Adventures of Captain Hatteras"|"Jules Verne"

At eight o'clock they made their final preparations. The guns were
carefully loaded, and an opening was begun in the roof of the
snow-house. Bell worked cleverly at this for a few minutes, when
Johnson, who had left the bedroom, where he was on guard, for a few
minutes, returned rapidly to his companions. He seemed disturbed."|"The Voyages and Adventures of Captain Hatteras"|"Jules Verne"

worked for an hour, and dug a passage about ten feet long, through
which one might crawl. Then Altamont took his place, and did about as
much; the snow which was taken from the gallery was carried into the
kitchen, where the doctor melted it at the fire, that it might take
up less room. The captain followed the American; then came Johnson.
In ten hours, that is to say, at about eight o'clock in the morning,
the gallery was finished. At daybreak the doctor peeped at the bears
through a loop-hole in the wall of the powder-magazine."|"The Voyages and Adventures of Captain Hatteras"|"Jules Verne"

preserved either by their position or the slope of the rocks, gave it
a woolly appearance, like waves in a high wind. The country was still
barren, and looking as if no living being had ever set foot in it."|"The Voyages and Adventures of Captain Hatteras"|"Jules Verne"

pounds of flesh; he gave each one a third of it, and they again took

fold their arms. The launch was rocking gently in her little harbor,
with her mast set, her jib lowered, and her foresail in the brails;
the provisions and most of the things on the sledge had been put on
board; only the tent and a little of the camping material remained to
be put on board the next day. The doctor found all these preparations
complete on his return. When he saw the launch quietly sheltered from
the wind, it occurred to him to give a name to the little harbor, and
he proposed that of Altamont. This proposition was unanimously agreed
to. So it was named Altamont Harbor."|"The Voyages and Adventures of Captain Hatteras"|"Jules Verne"

next morning Johnson and Bell set about carrying on board the camping
material. At eight o'clock all the preparations for departure were
complete. At the moment of starting the doctor's thoughts returned to
the footprints they had seen. Were these men trying to gain the
North? Had they any means of crossing the Polar Sea! Should they meet
them again? For three days they had come across no trace of the
travellers, and certainly, whoever they were, they could not have
reached Altamont Harbor. That was a place which they were the first
to set foot in. But the doctor, who was harassed by his thoughts,
wanted to take a last view of the country, and he ascended a little
hill about a hundred feet high, whence he had a distant view to the
south."|"The Voyages and Adventures of Captain Hatteras"|"Jules Verne"
12:00|noon|"This
observation had a great practical importance; in fact, if whalers can
ever get to the polar basin, either by the seas of North America or
those of the north of Asia, they are sure of getting full cargoes,
for this part of the ocean seems to be the universal fishing-pond,
the general reservoir of whales, seals, and all marine animals. At
noon the line of the horizon was still unbroken; the doctor began to
doubt of the existence of a continent in so high latitudes."|"The Voyages and Adventures of Captain Hatteras"|"Jules Verne"
"~ 18:00"|"about six o'clock in the evening"|"The
time flew by in this uncertainty. Nothing appeared on the sharply
defined circle of the sea; nothing was to be seen save sky and
sea,--not one of those floating land-plants which rejoiced the heart
of Christopher Columbus as he was about to discover America. Hatteras
was still gazing. At length, at about six o'clock in the evening, a
shapeless vapor appeared at a little height above the level of the
sea; it looked like a puff of smoke; the sky was perfectly cold, so
this vapor was no cloud; it would keep appearing and disappearing, as
if it were in commotion. Hatteras was the first to detect this
phenomenon; he examined it with his glass for a whole hour."|"The Voyages and Adventures of Captain Hatteras"|"Jules Verne"
18:00|"six o'clock in the evening"|"But
at six o'clock in the evening, while the waves were rising, there
came a sudden calm. The wind stopped as if by a miracle. The sea was
smooth, as if it had not felt a puff of wind for twelve hours. The
hurricane seemed to have respected this part of the Polar Ocean. What
was the reason? It was an extraordinary phenomenon, which Captain
Sabine had witnessed in his voyages in Greenland seas. The fog,
without lifting, was very bright. The launch drifted along in a zone
of electric light, an immense St. Elmo fire, brilliant but without
heat. The mast, sail, and rigging stood out black against the
phosphorescent air; the men seemed to have plunged into a bath of
transparent rays, and their faces were all lit up. The sudden calm of
this portion of the ocean came, without doubt, from the ascending
motion of the columns of air, while the tempest, which was a cyclone,
turned rapidly about this peaceful centre. But this atmosphere on
fire suggested a thought to Hatteras."|"The Voyages and Adventures of Captain Hatteras"|"Jules Verne"

five o'clock in the morning of July 11th the wind went down; the sea
grew quieter; the sky regained its polar clearness, and within three
miles of them appeared the land. This continent was but an island, or
rather a volcano, peering up like a lighthouse at the North Pole. The
mountain, in full eruption, was hurling forth a mass of burning
stones and melting rocks. It seemed to be rising and falling beneath
the successive blasts as if it were breathing; the things which were
cast out reached a great height in the air; amid the jets of flame,
torrents of lava were flowing down the side of the mountain; here
creeping between steaming rocks, there falling in cascades amid the
purple vapor: and lower down a thousand streams united in one large
river, which ran boiling into the sea."|"The Voyages and Adventures of Captain Hatteras"|"Jules Verne"
12:00|noon|"The
sky at a considerable height had an ashy hue; the darkness, which was
so marked during the tempest, and of which the doctor could give no
satisfactory explanation, evidently came from the ashes, which
completely hid the sun. He remembered a similar fact that took place
in 1812, at the Barbadoes, which at noon was plunged into total
darkness by the mass of cinders thrown from the crater of Isle St.
Vincent."|"The Voyages and Adventures of Captain Hatteras"|"Jules Verne"
"ap < 11:00"|"Towards eleven o'clock"|"As
he spoke, Hatteras was the victim of a violent excitement, a sort of
fever, and the doctor in vain tried to calm him. His eyes were
strangely bright, and his thoughts were boiling within him. Clawbonny
ascribed this condition to the terrible perils he had gone through.
Hatteras evidently needed rest, and they set about seeking a place to
camp. Altamont soon found a grotto in the rocks, which had fallen in
such a way as to form a cavern. Johnson and Bell brought provisions
there, and let loose the dogs. Towards eleven o'clock everything was
prepared for a meal; the canvas of the tent served as a cloth; the
breakfast, consisting of pemmican, salt meat, tea and coffee, was set
and soon devoured. But first, Hatteras demanded that an observation
should be made; he wanted to know its position exactly. The doctor
and Altamont then took their instruments, and after taking an
observation they found the precise position of the grotto to be
latitude 89° 59' 15"". The longitude at this height was of no
importance, for all the meridians run together within a few hundred
feet higher. So in reality the island was situated at the North Pole,
and the ninetieth degree of latitude was only forty-five seconds from
there, exactly three quarters of a mile, that is to say, towards the
top of the volcano. When Hatteras knew this result, he asked that it
should be stated in two documents, one to be placed in a cairn on the
shore. So at once the doctor took his pen and wrote the following
document, one copy of which is now in the archives of the Royal
Geographical Society in London:--"|"The Voyages and Adventures of Captain Hatteras"|"Jules Verne"
08:00|"eight o'clock in the morning"|"The
doctor was unwilling to urge him any further, and a few moments later
the little band, equipped for a hard climb, and preceded by Duke, set
out. The sky was perfectly clear. The thermometer stood at 52°.
The air had all the brilliancy which is so marked at this high
latitude. It was eight o'clock in the morning. Hatteras went ahead
with his dog, the others followed close behind."|"The Voyages and Adventures of Captain Hatteras"|"Jules Verne"
10:00|"ten o'clock in the morning"|"Then
the four men and the captain,--a poor body without a mind,--and his
faithful Duke, sad and melancholy, got into the boat for the return
voyage. It was ten o'clock in the morning. A new sail was set up with
the canvas of the tent. The launch, sailing before the wind, left
Queen's Island, and that evening the doctor, standing on his bench,
waved a last farewell to Mount Hatteras, which was lighting up the
horizon."|"The Voyages and Adventures of Captain Hatteras"|"Jules Verne"
