07:00|"7 a.m."|"My three years of medical residency were the most stressful of my life. I was on call every third night, arriving at the hospital at 7 a.m. for rounds and leaving about thirty-six hours later, having perhaps caught a few hours of sleep on a gurney. Life was a seemingly endless cycle of blood draws, deaths, and IVs that needed to be replaced in the middle of the night. I learned how to treat someone with heart disease who was having chest pain; how to stitch up wounds so that they would look pretty when healed; how to snake a central line into a deep vein near the heart though the neck. But I often worked outside my comfort zone and at the very limits of my competency."|"An American Sickness"|"Elisabeth Rosenthal"
"ap 07:00"|7|"The first and second years of residency are the hardest. By third year many residents are working mostly from 7 or 8 a.m. to 5 or 6 p.m., with only the occasional backup call from home. (I spent three months of my third year working at hospitals in Kenya.) Some subspecialties require a couple of extra years of training as so-called fellows. Miriam Laugesen, a researcher at Columbia University, has found that the extra debt incurred to pursue specialty training is about $21,300 in total and, since specialist compensation is proportionally far higher, “they pay that off quite readily.”"|"An American Sickness"|"Elisabeth Rosenthal"

23:40|"twenty of twenty-four"|"One study demonstrated that the 2014 estimates were longer than actual times in twenty of twenty-four procedures, sometimes by as much as double. The biggest gap was for a host of common simple operations: deviated septum, prostate surgery, upper GI endoscopy, hysterectomy, and cataract removal. For two decades, the RUC meetings were held behind closed doors, but as of 2013 the AMA bowed to pressure to publish its minutes, which revealed the kind of bargaining that goes on. The urologists are granted two additional minutes of prep time before one type of surgery. The orthopedists and trauma surgeons get twelve additional minutes of pay for positioning before operations to fix rib fractures. (Never mind that in most hospitals the residents or techs typically do this work.)"|"An American Sickness"|"Elisabeth Rosenthal"

Clancy of the University of Pennsylvania questioned Vanda’s defining “success” as an extra forty-five minutes or so of sleep during that worst 25 percent of sleep nights. “They may go from 3.2 hours to 4 hours,” he said. “That’s still pretty dreadful.” Why not just give melatonin? others asked."|"An American Sickness"|"Elisabeth Rosenthal"

With names like the Patient Access Network Foundation (PAN) and the HealthWell Foundation, they offer applicants stipends to defray the cost of medicines and treatment. She’d wake up at 6 a.m. to get organized to start making calls. “You’d keep calling back each to check on the status. And then you’d get a letter saying something like ‘We regret to inform you that the Patient Access Network doesn’t have any more MS funding this year.’ Or maybe you get a notice that, yes, you’ve been covered for the year, and you’d relax. But the whole thing is crazy and super unnerving.”"|"An American Sickness"|"Elisabeth Rosenthal"

In Los Angeles, which sets charges for all ambulance providers, the base rate for a basic ambulance ride in 2014 was $1,033.50 ($1,445 if an advanced life support team is on board), plus $19 per mile and $51.50 for every fifteen minutes of waiting. And that didn’t include extras, such as $84.75 if it’s after 7 p.m., $65.75 for the use of an oxygen tank, and $27.25 for each ice pack and bandage, and the oxygen mask."|"An American Sickness"|"Elisabeth Rosenthal"

Her teenage son was alarmed enough to call an ambulance. The paramedics advised that she had food poisoning and didn’t take her. When she became confused and groggy at 3 a.m., her fiancé raced her to Sentara Norfolk Hospital, where a scan showed she was suffering from a subarachnoid hemorrhage. A vessel had burst, and blood was leaking into the narrow space between the skull and the brain. The clock was ticking."|"An American Sickness"|"Elisabeth Rosenthal"

On September 9, 2013, St. Luke’s management circulated a draft press release announcing that it henceforth planned to operate the Cornwall emergency room only part-time, closing it from 10 p.m. to 10 a.m. each day, since it was losing money by staying open at night."|"An American Sickness"|"Elisabeth Rosenthal"

I could schedule my appointment, know how much I had to pay, and even prepay the co-payment, rather than calling three receptionists to see which doctor is available, checking coverage with insurers, filling out the same form every time I visit a new provider, and having a mailbox filled with paper statements for months afterward."|"An American Sickness"|"Elisabeth Rosenthal"
