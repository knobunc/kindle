07:00|"7 a.m."|"My three years of medical residency were the most stressful of my life. I was on call every third night, arriving at the hospital at 7 a.m. for rounds and leaving about thirty-six hours later, having perhaps caught a few hours of sleep on a gurney. Life was a seemingly endless cycle of blood draws, deaths, and IVs that needed to be replaced in the middle of the night. I learned how to treat someone with heart disease who was having chest pain; how to stitch up wounds so that they would look pretty when healed; how to snake a central line into a deep vein near the heart though the neck. But I often worked outside my comfort zone and at the very limits of my competency."|"An American Sickness"|"Elisabeth Rosenthal"
20:11|2011|"At first Medicare tolerated the sleight of hand and only pushed back when it noted that, by 2011, 8 percent of people under observation were in the hospital for more than two days. (Observation status does not count toward the three days of inpatient care required for Medicare to pay for a subsequent nursing home or rehabilitation stay.) Beginning on April 1, 2015, it said that observation status could not persist for more than “two midnights.” That ruling prompted articles from consultants with titles like “How Your Hospital Can Succeed Under the Two-Midnight Rule”—meaning in terms of money, of course."|"An American Sickness"|"Elisabeth Rosenthal"

Miriam Laugesen, a researcher at Columbia University, has found that the extra debt incurred to pursue specialty training is about $21,300 in total and, since specialist compensation is proportionally far higher, “they pay that off quite readily.”"|"An American Sickness"|"Elisabeth Rosenthal"

23:40|"twenty of twenty-four"|"One study demonstrated that the 2014 estimates were longer than actual times in twenty of twenty-four procedures, sometimes by as much as double. The biggest gap was for a host of common simple operations: deviated septum, prostate surgery, upper GI endoscopy, hysterectomy, and cataract removal. For two decades, the RUC meetings were held behind closed doors, but as of 2013 the AMA bowed to pressure to publish its minutes, which revealed the kind of bargaining that goes on. The urologists are granted two additional minutes of prep time before one type of surgery. The orthopedists and trauma surgeons get twelve additional minutes of pay for positioning before operations to fix rib fractures. (Never mind that in most hospitals the residents or techs typically do this work.)"|"An American Sickness"|"Elisabeth Rosenthal"

With names like the Patient Access Network Foundation (PAN) and the HealthWell Foundation, they offer applicants stipends to defray the cost of medicines and treatment. She’d wake up at 6 a.m. to get organized to start making calls. “You’d keep calling back each to check on the status. And then you’d get a letter saying something like ‘We regret to inform you that the Patient Access Network doesn’t have any more MS funding this year.’ Or maybe you get a notice that, yes, you’ve been covered for the year, and you’d relax.

Within two years, it received twenty thousand reports of adverse reactions. By 2014 the FDA’s tracking efforts had collected enough evidence of risk—thousands of injuries and a small number of deaths—to propose moving the mesh from class 2 to class 3. (The switch was enacted in 2016.) By 2015 there were about one hundred thousand mesh lawsuits filed against multiple manufacturers in different states, and judges advised the companies to settle to avoid many billions in trial costs and awards."|"An American Sickness"|"Elisabeth Rosenthal"

In Los Angeles, which sets charges for all ambulance providers, the base rate for a basic ambulance ride in 2014 was $1,033.50 ($1,445 if an advanced life support team is on board), plus $19 per mile and $51.50 for every fifteen minutes of waiting. And that didn’t include extras, such as $84.75 if it’s after 7 p.m., $65.75 for the use of an oxygen tank, and $27.25 for each ice pack and bandage, and the oxygen mask."|"An American Sickness"|"Elisabeth Rosenthal"

When she became confused and groggy at 3 a.m., her fiancé raced her to Sentara Norfolk Hospital, where a scan showed she was suffering from a subarachnoid hemorrhage. A vessel had burst, and blood was leaking into the narrow space between the skull and the brain. The clock was ticking."|"An American Sickness"|"Elisabeth Rosenthal"
