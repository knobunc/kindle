12:00|noon|"One of the early milestones in mapping was the estimate in 240 BCE of the circumference of the earth by the Greek astronomer Eratosthenes, who noted that in the town of Syene (modern-day Aswan) on the longest day each year (the summer solstice) there was no shadow cast at noon. He was aware that the sun was not directly overhead on the same day in his hometown of Alexandria along the Nile in northern Egypt, so he estimated the discrepancy in its position by calculating the angle produced by the shadow of a tall tower in Alexandria. Using geometry and knowledge of the distance between the two cities, he arrived at a figure for the circumference of the earth that was just about 16 percent off the modern measurement of about forty thousand kilometers (twenty-five thousand miles)."|"Mapping the Heavens"|"Priyamvada Natarajan"
19:14|1914|"It was Slipher, mentioned above, who discerned one of the early hints from data using these new observational tools, finding in 1912 that the Andromeda Nebula appeared to be rushing toward us at a rather dramatic speed of about three hundred kilometers (186 miles) per second, which is about a million kilometers (more than six hundred thousand miles) per hour. By 1914, by measuring their velocities, he found that several other nebulae were also peculiarly flying rapidly, but away from us. These speeds were impossible to conceive. The fastest car in the 1912 Indianapolis 500 rally, for example, clocked in at an average speed of only 129 kilometers (eighty miles) per hour. Part of the puzzlement of these measurements was how entirely beyond human grasp these tremendous speeds were."|"Mapping the Heavens"|"Priyamvada Natarajan"
02:30|vigils|"Hubble decided to tackle the challenge of measuring distances to nebulae. Using Leavitt’s method, he began to look for more Cepheids. This took many long, lonely nights of observing with the help of an assistant, sitting still on the platform next to the instrument mounted on the hundred-inch mirror and tracking stars. Hubble dressed warmly, and once the telescope clicked into place and pointed to where he intended, he would light his pipe and sit hunched over, watching the heavens swing slowly by. On one of these celestial vigils, much to his excitement, he found one Cepheid in the Andromeda Nebula (our nearest neighboring galaxy) and successfully measured its distance from earth to be nine hundred thousand light-years, about three times the size of our galaxy as estimated by Shapley using the same techniques on nearby cosmic objects.21"|"Mapping the Heavens"|"Priyamvada Natarajan"
"ap ~ 03:00"|"around three"|"Part of the problem also stemmed from overspecialization and the lack of communication among scientific subfields in astronomy and physics. Herman and Alpher were stellar astrophysicists—a distinct subdiscipline—by training and thus perceived of as somewhat disconnected from cosmology. Helge Kragh, in his book Cosmology and Controversy, suggests that the conflicting and multiple values for the temperature of the universe (the CMBR) that Gamow, Herman, and Alpher published might have confused astronomers. Besides, it was unclear whether the temperature was of the cosmic origin or if it included the effects of stellar radiation. This confusion in interpretation was in fact an old one and likely led to the dismissal of what might have been truly the first reported detection of the CMBR, even prior to Dicke’s aborted attempt. In 1941 the Canadian physicist Andrew McKellar had measured the temperature of the universe without realizing it. He was looking at the carbon-nitrogen cycle as the potential energy source for carbon stars. Thus the toxic organic compound cyanogen (which consists of carbon and nitrogen atoms) had sparked his interest, due to its detection in the tail of Halley’s comet in 1910. While studying the spectra of molecules in interstellar space to understand their function and origin, McKellar determined that the poisonous cyanogen molecules were extremely cold—in fact, around three kelvins (–270 degrees Celsius or –454 degrees Fahrenheit). No one recognized the importance of this absurdly low temperature or that it had any meaning beyond McKellar’s apparently esoteric study. The confusions about exactly what they were measuring aside, Kragh argues that Alpher and Herman made another crucial lapse by not discussing or even speculating on how the temperature that they had estimated might be measured. For example, their 1948 Nature paper fails to calculate and present the precise wavelength at which this cosmic temperature could be detected. In fact, it does not even have a plot of the blackbody curve. Kragh contends (and I agree) that omitting to mention that the cosmic temperature would be observable in the microwave band further deterred experimental efforts to detect it. Additionally, this lack of guidance to focus on the microwave band prevented astronomers from connecting the dots. All of Alpher and Herman’s calculations appeared in the context of what was seen as an entirely separate field of study, nuclear physics. Cosmologists simply failed to take notice.9"|"Mapping the Heavens"|"Priyamvada Natarajan"
"ap 02:00"|two|"Thus it was sheer serendipity that eventually catapulted our understanding of the early universe, and it came from a completely unexpected quarter. There is a saying in physics that one person’s noise is another person’s signal—what this means is that something that is effectively a nuisance in answering one scientific question often turns out to be extremely valuable and unexpectedly illuminating for a different one. This was literally the case for the first reported measurement of the CMBR, by two physicists who weren’t even looking for it."|"Mapping the Heavens"|"Priyamvada Natarajan"
