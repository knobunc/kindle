"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"I spent the morning in the garden, planning the evening's menu. I have always liked to cook, but dinner with Lisa had rapidly become the high point of my day. Not only that, I was already taking it for granted. So it hit me hard, around noon, when I looked out the front and saw her car gone."|"Press Enter"|"John Varley"

Sometime during the afternoon I would shop or do household chores, then at seven one of us would cook dinner. We alternated. I taught her ""American"" cooking, and she taught me a little of everything. She complained about the lack of vital ingredients in American markets. No dogs, of course, but she claimed to know great ways of preparing monkey, snake, and rat. I never knew how hard she was pulling my leg, and didn't ask."|"Press Enter"|"John Varley"
"ap 01:00"|"one o'clock"|"She got rid of the ambulance crew. Lisa was a lot calmer after she made coffee and we were sitting at the kitchen table. It was one o'clock, and I was still pretty rocky. But it hadn't been a bad one."|"Press Enter"|"John Varley"
">> 00:00"|"well after midnight"|"We worked until well after midnight. Lisa would review a tape or a disc, and if she was in any doubt, toss it to me for the magnetic treatment. At one point, simply because she was unsure, she took the magnet and passed it in front of an entire shelf of software."|"Press Enter"|"John Varley"
