12:00|noon|"Dawn came dimly.   On the dark faces         15  
of the old mountains   eastward staring     
light was kindled.   The land shimmered.     
Sun came shining.   Silver morning     
bathed in water   bright ascended     
the bare heaven   blue and lofty.         20  
Beams fell slanting    through the boughs of trees     
glancing and glimmering   in the grey forest;     
rain drops running   from rustling leaves     
like drops of glass   dripped and glistened.     
No beast was stirring:   the birds listened.         25  
As wary as wolves   through the wood stalking     
to the marches rode there   Mordred’s hunters,     
huge and hungry   hounds beside them     
the fewte followed   fiercely baying.     
The queen they hunted   with cold hatred         30  

till their hope failed them   amid houseless stones,     
halting hungry-eyed   under the hills’ menace     
at the walls of Wales.   War was behind them     
and woe in Britain.   Winds were shifting,     
Mordred waiting.     
                                 Their message found him 35  
by the seaward cliffs   in the south-country     
sheer and shining.   Upon shaven grass     
his tents were marshalled,   as a town clustered     
with lanes and alleys   loud with voices     
in the dales hidden   and on downs rising         40  
above Romeril   where running water     
to the shore had cloven   a shallow pathway.     
From the East, from Angel   and the isles of mist,     
there kings of Almain   their craft mustered,     
under cliff crowding   their carven prows         45  

and black banners   in the breeze flying.     
Fair wind came foaming   over flecked water,     
on gleaming shingle   green and silver     
the waves were washing   on walls of chalk.     
On a mound of grass   Mordred stood there:         50  
ever gazed his eyes   out and southward,     
lest Arthur’s ships   unawares to shore     
the winds should waft.   Watchmen he posted     
by the sea’s margin   in the south-country,     
by night and day   the narrow waters         55  
from the hills to heed.   There on high raised he     
builded beacons   that should blaze with fire,     
if Arthur came,   to his aid calling     
his men to muster   where he most needed.     
Thus he watched and waited   and the wind studied.  60  

     
Ivor hailed him   with eager voice     
by his tent standing   tall and brooding;     
words unwelcome   from the West brought he.     
‘O King!’ he cried,   ‘the Queen is lost!     
Her trail faded   in the trackless stones;         65  
hound and hunter   in the hills faltered.     
To the hidden kingdom   and the holy vales     
where Leodegrance   once long ago     
lived beleaguered,   lord enchanted,     
she hath fled and is free.   But few love her.         70  

Fear her no longer,   the fay-woman!     
Fell fate take her!   May her feet never     
return hither   to trouble Mordred!     
From thy mind thrust her!   With men deal thou,     
woman forsaking   and to war turning!         75  
Thine hour is at hand.’   Then his eyes wavered     
and his tongue halted.   Turning slowly     
with frown of thunder   fiercely Mordred     
gazed on him glaring.   ‘Begone!’ cried he.     
‘The master’s hour   master chooseth.         80  
Nought thou knowest.   At need failing     
from vain errand   dost venture home     
with tongue untamed   to teach Mordred     
thy fool’s counsel?   Flee mine anger     
unto foul fortune.   The fiend take thee!’         85  
     
Alone then long   lowering paced he.     
In his bosom there burned   under black shadow     
a smouldering fire   whose smoke choked him;     
his mind wavered   in a maze walking     
between fear and fury.   At first his thought         90  
hunger-hunted   from his hold wandered     
by lust allured   to its long torment.     
But he guessed that Guinever   had greeting sent     
by secret servant   over sea speeding     
to Lancelot,   love recalling         95  
and his aid asking   in her evil day.     
Should Ban’s kindred   to battle hasten     
and the fair lily   on the field sable     
once more be seen   marching proudly     
Arthur to strengthen,   ill were boded         100  
to his plot and purpose.   Thus he pondered long.     
For Lancelot,   lord of Benwick,     
most he hated   and yet most dreaded,     
and words of witchcraft   well remembered     
that lords of Benwick   the lily bearing         105  
in open battle   should he ever challenge     
he would reap ruin.   Thus wrath with cunning,     
doubt with daring   in his dark counsel     
warred uncertain.   The wind lessened.     
In cloudless sky   clear and golden         110  
the sun at evening   summer rekindled     
in a glow sinking.   The sea glimmered     
under streaming stars   in the steep heaven.     
Day followed day.   Dawn came brightly     
with a breeze blowing   blithe at morning         115  
cool and keenwingéd.   A cry woke him.     
‘A sail, a sail   on the sea shining!’     
Watchmen were calling,   wailing voices     
from ward to ward   the wind carried,     
and grasping brands   guards by the beacons         120  
wakeful waited.   No word gave he.     
Eager went his eyes   out and southward,     
and sails saw he   on the sea climbing.     
Thus came Arthur   at early morn     
at last returning   to his lost kingdom.         125  
On his shrouds there shone   sheen with silver     
a white lady   in holy arms     
a babe bearing   born of maiden.     
Sun shone through them.   The sea sparkled.     
Men marked it well,   Mordred knew it,         130  
Arthur’s ensign.   Yet his eyes wandered;     
for the banner of Benwick   breathless looked he,     
silver upon sable.   But he saw it not.     
The fair flower-de-luce   on its field withered     
drooping in darkness.   Doom came nearer.         135  
The sun mounted   and the sails whitened.     
Far over the sea   faintly sounding     
trumpets heard they.   Towering upward     
from Arthur’s side   eager hastened     
a mighty ship   in the morn gleaming         140  
high, white-timbered,   with hull gilded;     
on its sail was sewn   a sun rising,     
on its broidered banner   in the breeze floated     
a fiery griffon   golden flaming.     
Thus came Gawain   his king guarding         145  
valiant-hearted    the vaward leading:     
a hundred ships   with hulls shining     
and shrouds swelling   and shields swinging.     
Behind beheld they   the host faring:     
deepweighed dromonds   and drawn barges,         150  
galleys and galleons   with gear of war,     
six hundred sail   in the sun turning,     
fair sight and fell.   Flags were streaming;     
ten thousand told   targes hung there     
bright on the bulwarks,   blazons of princes         155  
and knights of the North   and the nine kingdoms     
of Britain the blessed.   But Ban’s kindred,     
and Lancelot   with his lilies came not.     
     
Then Mordred laughed   loud and mirthless.     
Word he shouted.   Wild were the trumpets.         160  
Beacons were blazing,   banners were lifted,     
shaft rang on shield,   and the shores echoed.     
War was awakened   and woe in Britain.     
Thus came Arthur   to his own kingdom     
in power and majesty   proud returning         165  
to Romeril   where running slowly     
by the shore now weeps   a shuddering water.     
Sun shone on swords.   Silver-pointed     
the spears sparkled   as they sprang upward,     
white as wheatfield.   Wheeling above them         170  
the crows were crying   with cold voices.     
In the foaming sea   flashed a thousand     
swift oars sweeping.   Saxon chieftains     
at their stems standing   sternly shouted;     
blades they brandished   and broad axes,         175  
on their gods calling   with grim voices.     
With dread faces   dragon-prowed they spurred     
their sea-horses   to sudden onset,     
swerving swifly   and swinging inward.     
Beak met bulwark.   Burst were timbers.         180  
There was clang of iron   and crash of axes;     
sparked and splintered   spears and helmets;     
the smiths of battle   on smitten anvils     
there dinned and hammered   deadly forging     
wrath and ruin.   Red their hands were.         185  
About Prydwen pressed they,   the proud and fair,     
the ship of Arthur   with sheen of silver.     
     
Then Gawain sounded   his glad trumpet.     
His great galleon   golden shining     
as thunder riding   thrust among them         190  
with wind behind her.   In her wake followed     
lieges of Lothian,   lords and captains.     
Oars were splintered.   Iron clave timber,     
and ropes were riven.   With rending crash     
masts dismantled   as mountain-trees         195  
rushed down rattling   in the roar of battle.     
Now grim Galuth   Gawain brandished     
his sword renowned – smiths enchanted     
ere Rome was built   with runes marked it     
and its steel tempered   strong and deadly –         200  
forth leapt he as fire   a flame wielding.     
The king of Gothland   on his carven prow     
he smote to death   and to sea drave him;     
upon lords of Lochlan   lightning hurled he,     
helms boar-crested,   heathen standards         205  
hewed asunder.   High rang his voice     
‘Arthur’ calling.   The air trembled     
with thunderous answer   thousandfolded.     
As straw from storm,   as stalks falling     
before reapers ruthless,   as roke flying         210  
before the rising sun   wrathful blazing     
his foemen fled.   Fear o’ercame them.     
From board and beam   beaten fell they,     
in the sea they sank   their souls losing.     
Boats were blazing,   burned and smoking;         215  
some on shore shivered   to shards broken.     
Red ran the tide   the rocks staining.     
Shields on the water   shorn and splintered     
as flotsam floated.   Few saved their lives     
broken and bleeding   from that battle flying.         220  
Thus came Arthur   to his own kingdom     
and the sea’s passage   with the sword conquered,     
Gawain leading.   Now his glory shone     
as the star of noon   stern and cloudless     
o’er the heads of men   to its height climbing         225  
ere it fall and fail.   Fate yet waited.     
Tide was turning.   Timbers broken,     
dead men and drowned,   a dark jetsam,     
were left to lie   on the long beaches;     
rocks robed with red   rose from water.         230"|"The Fall of Arthur"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"

12:00|midday|"He dreamed that he was alone and lost in a forest full of wolves and wild boars, and lions that lapped up the blood of his faithful knights; but fleeing away he found himself in a mountain meadow, ‘the meryeste of medillerthe that men myghte beholde’, and saw descending out of the clouds a goddess in magnificent garments, the embodiment of Fortune, bearing in her hands a wheel made of gold and silver which she whirled about in her white hands. Arthur saw that there was ‘a chayere of chalke-whytte silver’ at the top of Fortune’s Wheel, from which six kings had fallen and now clung with broken crowns to the outer circle of the wheel, each in turn lamenting that he had fallen from such heights of greatness and power; and two kings were climbing up to claim the high seat at the summit of the wheel. The lady Fortune now raised Arthur to that seat, telling him that it was through her that he had won all his honour in war, that she had chosen him to sit in the high chair, and treating him as ‘soverayne in erthe’. But suddenly ‘at midday’ her manner changed towards him, saying ‘Thow has lyffede in delytte and lordchippes inewe’ [enough], and ‘abowte scho whirles the whele, and whirles me undire’, so that all his body was crushed; and he awoke."|"The Fall of Arthur"|"J.

"< 12:00"|"towards noon"|"In all the accounts of this war Sir Gawain is credited with the possession of a very singular ‘grace’, a faculty whereby his strength greatly increased towards noon and then again declined. When Lancelot perceived that this was so he dodged to and fro and avoided Gawain’s thrusts for a long time until his miraculous strength began to wane, whereupon Lancelot fell on him and gave him a great wound. (Incidentally the Mort Artu tells the story that during the time of Gawain’s recovery Arthur left the siege of Benwick and conducted his Roman campaign, in which the Emperor Lucius was slain; Malory of course ignored this, since he had already told the story in his tale of Arthur and the Emperor Lucius, see here.) But when Gawain was able to fight again all was repeated a second time with the same outcome, for Lancelot struck him in the place of the former wound. And even yet Gawain’s hatred was unappeased, but as he prepared for a third attempt news came from England that led Arthur to raise the siege of Benwick and return. That news was that Mordred had claimed to have received letters telling that Arthur had been slain in battle by Lancelot; that he had ‘made a parlemente’, and had had himself crowned king at Canterbury; and that he had declared that he would wed Guinevere, naming the day and preparing the bridal feast."|"The Fall of Arthur"|"J.

Then Bedivere remained at the hermitage, which was ‘besydes Glassyngbyry’ (Glastonbury in Somerset), and lived with the hermit ‘in prayers and fastynges and grete abstynaunce’.
