Three children, no, I think it’s four. Brilliant youngsters, and awfully brave about Stroud. Won’t hear a word against him. They think he still runs the whole works around here. And did you ever see the wife? They’re the most devoted old couple I ever saw."|"The Big Clock"|"Kenneth Fearing"

"ap 10:45"|10:45|"Nat Sperling had no further suggestions to make. I saw it was already 10:45, and with little or nothing done, an early lunch seemed an idle dream. Also, I would have to write off any hope for a conference today with Roy and Hagen. Tony Watson took the ball, speaking in abrupt, nervous rushes and occasionally halting altogether for a moment of pronounced anguish. It seemed to me his neurasthenia could have shown more improvement, if not a complete cure, for the four or five thousand dollars he had spent on psychoanalysis. Still, considering the hazards of our occupation, it could be that without those treatments Tony would today be speechless altogether."|"The Big Clock"|"Kenneth Fearing"
"ap 23:55"|"five minutes to twelve"|"At five minutes to twelve, even the tentative schedule lined up for the April book was far too meager. Leon Temple and Roy were engaged in a rather aimless cross-discussion about a radio program that Leon construed as a profound conspiracy against reason, and therefore a cardinal crime, with Roy protesting the program was only a minor nuisance."|"The Big Clock"|"Kenneth Fearing"

"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"We got Emory and Bert Finch teamed for the “Crimeless Tomorrow” feature, and at five o’clock I phoned Georgette to say I’d be home, after all, but Nellie told me Georgette had gone to her sister’s in some emergency involving one of Ann’s children. She would be home late, might not be home at all. I told Nellie I’d have supper in town."|"The Big Clock"|"Kenneth Fearing"
"ap 05:30"|five-thirty|"It was five-thirty when I walked into the Silver Lining, alone. I had a drink and reviewed what I would have said to Roy and Steve Hagen, had they been present to listen. It did not sound as convincing as I had made it sound this morning. Yet there must be a way. I could do something, I had to, and I would."|"The Big Clock"|"Kenneth Fearing"

12:00|noon|"Bert Sanders, the manager of the Lexington-Plaza, handed me a note when he gave me the key to a room on the fifth floor. The note said he positively must have the room by noon tomorrow, reservations had been made for it. The room itself, where I found my in-town valise, was all right, a sizable family vault I believed I had lived in once or twice before."|"The Big Clock"|"Kenneth Fearing"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"I was a little bit surprised and dismayed to see it was already three o’clock, as I brought out the half bottle of Scotch, the one dressing gown and single pair of slippers, the back number of Crimeways—how did that get here?—the three volumes of stories and poetry, the stack of handkerchiefs, pajamas, aspirin tablets comprising most of the contents of the valise. I said: “How would you like some Scotch?”"|"The Big Clock"|"Kenneth Fearing"
"ap ~ 10:00"|"about ten o’clock"|"We both would. Service in the Lexington-Plaza perished at about ten o’clock, so we had our drinks with straight tap water. It was all right. The life we were now living seemed to quicken perceptibly."|"The Big Clock"|"Kenneth Fearing"
"> 12:00"|"after noon"|"I remembered to tell Pauline, lying on the floor with a pillow under her head and looking more magnificent than ever in my pajamas, that our home would no longer be ours after noon. She dreamily told me I needn’t worry, it would be all right, and why didn’t I go right on explaining about Louise Patterson and the more important trends in modern painting. I saw with some surprise I had a book open in my lap, but I had been talking about something else entirely. And now I couldn’t remember what. I dropped the book, and lay down on the floor beside her."|"The Big Clock"|"Kenneth Fearing"
"ap 01:30"|1:30|"I found out again why we are on this earth. I think. And then I woke up and saw myself in that big, wide bed, alone, with a great ringing and hammering and buzzing going on. The phone was closest, so I answered it, and a voice said: “I’m sorry, sir, but Mr. Sanders says you have no reservation for today.”
I looked at my watch; 1:30.
“All right.”"|"The Big Clock"|"Kenneth Fearing"
"~ 06:00"|"about six o’clock this morning"|"“All right. Where is she?”
“Who? Oh, well, about six o’clock this morning—”
“My God, never mind.”"|"The Big Clock"|"Kenneth Fearing"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"I could tell Georgette, at her sister’s in Trenton, that I had to work until three in the morning and didn’t want to phone. It would have awakened the whole household. Simple. It had always worked before. It would work this time. Had to."|"The Big Clock"|"Kenneth Fearing"
15:00|"three o’clock in the afternoon"|"It was three o’clock in the afternoon when I got back to my desk, and there was no one around except Lucille, Roy’s and my secretary, listlessly typing in the small room connecting our two offices. She did not appear curious, and I couldn’t find any messages on my desk, either, just a lot of inter-office memos and names."|"The Big Clock"|"Kenneth Fearing"
"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"We had breakfast at about noon, and shortly afterwards started a slow drive back to the city, by a different route. It was a different river we followed again, of course, and of course, I fell in love with it all over again; and of course, Pauline helped."|"The Big Clock"|"Kenneth Fearing"
"ap ~ 07:30"|"about half-past seven"|"Then at about half-past seven, with some of the shops closing, we reached a little but simply jam-packed place on Fiftieth Street. Maybe I had been in here before, but I couldn’t remember it and neither, seemingly, did the proprietor remember me."|"The Big Clock"|"Kenneth Fearing"
"ap 01:45"|1:45|"I drove back to Gil’s. There, it was the usual raucous Saturday night. I had a whole lot of drinks, without much conversation, then I took the car around to my garage and caught the 1:45 for home. It was early, but I wanted to be clear-eyed when Georgette and Georgia got back from Florida in the afternoon. I would return by train, pick them up in the car, and drive them home."|"The Big Clock"|"Kenneth Fearing"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"It was ten o’clock—the earliest moment possible—before I was able to leave. I had enough to worry about, without taking on any extra nonsense from this particular crowd."|"The Big Clock"|"Kenneth Fearing"
"ap 05:00"|five|"The elevator stopped at five. The inner door slid noiselessly open, and Pauline herself pushed open the outer door. I followed her the dozen or so carpeted steps to 5A. Inside the small four-room apartment there was such silence and so much dead air it did not seem it could have been entered for days."|"The Big Clock"|"Kenneth Fearing"

"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"I knew quite well I had seen Earl entering that building at ten o’clock on Saturday evening. She was alive when they passed into it. He now claimed he had not seen her for several days. Why? There could be only one answer."|"The Big Clock"|"Kenneth Fearing"
"ap > 01:00"|"a little after one o’clock"|"It was a little after one o’clock when I got there, time for lunch, so I had it. The food was awful. But it would go on the expense account, and after I’d eaten I got out my notebook and put it down. Lunch, $1.50. Taxi, $1.00. I thought for a minute, wondering what Stroud would do if he ever came to a dive like this, then I added: Four highballs, $2.00."|"The Big Clock"|"Kenneth Fearing"
"ap 00:30"|"half of one"|"“Well, we’re starting to get some reports.” Roy nodded with interest toward the cross-reference chart laid out on a big blackboard covering half of one wall. “Ed Orlin phoned a while ago. He located Gil’s with no trouble and definitely placed the man and the woman there. Interesting stuff. I think we’re getting somewhere.”"|"The Big Clock"|"Kenneth Fearing"
"ap > 07:00"|"A little past seven o’clock"|"A little past seven o’clock Roy returned. We arranged about relieving each other on the following day and then I went out, feeling I’d had about all I could stand for the time being."|"The Big Clock"|"Kenneth Fearing"
"ap > 10:00"|"a little after ten o’clock"|"At the cabstand I had that afternoon selected as the likeliest. I got my first real break. A good one. A driver identified Janoth as a passenger he’d ridden a little after ten o’clock last Saturday night. The driver was positive. He knew when he’d picked him up, and where, and where he’d put him down. A block from Hagen’s."|"The Big Clock"|"Kenneth Fearing"

It was around midnight when I reached Marble Road.
Georgia and Georgette were asleep."|"The Big Clock"|"Kenneth Fearing"

“Well, about ten-thirty. Why?”

"ap 05:30"|five-thirty|"“If he doesn’t come out during the afternoon, we’re sure to pick him up at five-thirty, when the building empties.” I nodded, but my stunned and scattered thoughts were beginning to pull themselves together. “It’ll be jammed, as usual, but we can have every inch of the main floor covered.”"|"The Big Clock"|"Kenneth Fearing"
"ap > 08:00"|"a few minutes after eight"|"My watch said a few minutes after eight. Today was the day. I still didn’t know how I would meet it. But I knew it was the day. The police would finish the check-up in Albany. Somebody would think of combing the building."|"The Big Clock"|"Kenneth Fearing"
"~ 20:00"|"about eight in the evening"|"Yesterday should have been the day, and why it wasn’t, I would never really know. When that Patterson woman walked in here I should have been through. I knew why she hadn’t identified me, the fact that I had not destroyed her picture, and my threat that I still would, if she opened her mouth. Artists are curious. I shuddered when I thought how close I’d come, actually, to getting rid of that canvas. She could still make trouble, any time she felt like it, and maybe she would. She was erratic enough. At about eight in the evening she’d packed herself off. But she might be back. At any moment, for any reason, she might change her mind."|"The Big Clock"|"Kenneth Fearing"
