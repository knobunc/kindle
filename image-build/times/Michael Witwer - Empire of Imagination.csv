16:59|"one of seventeen"|"The used pulp that Gary now perused featured a heroic, if not savage, barbarian named Conan—one of seventeen Weird Tales issues from the 1930s featuring this character. It wasn’t long before Gary began spending much of his time at a local gas station wearing out a copy of Conan the Conqueror—a posthumous printing of Robert E. Howard’s Conan saga. Gary had found himself a new hero."|"Empire of Imagination"|"Michael Witwer"
"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"It was past midnight and Gary had hardly slept for days. He had just come home from Lake Geneva’s Horticultural Hall, where he had spent the last several hours setting up for the inaugural Lake Geneva Wargames Convention, “Gen Con” for short. However, the way Gary felt at this moment, it would be both the first and last convention where he was in charge."|"Empire of Imagination"|"Michael Witwer"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"It was after midnight, and the streets of Lake Geneva were quiet except for the gentle rustle of turning leaves. Arneson and his companion, Dave Megarry, a member of Arneson’s Minneapolis-based gaming group, had a long drive back to the Twin Cities ahead of them, one that would certainly last well into the next morning. Gary’s local gaming buddies, including Rob Kuntz and Don Kaye, on the other hand, had only a short walk of a few blocks before they could get some rest and quiet their busy minds."|"Empire of Imagination"|"Michael Witwer"

After all, there would continue to be a hard stop at 9:00 P.M., so the clock was ticking. This time Tenser and Ahlissa would journey to the dungeon’s second level with the help of three new party members, Murlynd, Robilar, and Terik, created and played by locals Don Kaye, Rob Kuntz, and Terry Kuntz, respectively."|"Empire of Imagination"|"Michael Witwer"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"Ernie, at thirteen, and Elise, at eleven, were at a perfect age to test the system. After all, they were close in age to one of his biggest potential demographics for the game. Gary also had other potential in-house testers lying in wait, namely eight-year-old Heidi, six-year-old Cindy, and two-year-old Luke. Gary loved that he could include his family in his work, as it combined the two things he was most passionate about. Though too young to be involved in the testing, it was Gary’s youngest daughter Cindy, who when hearing all of the prototype names for the then unnamed Fantasy Game, famously said “Oh, Daddy, I like Dungeons and Dragons best!”"|"Empire of Imagination"|"Michael Witwer"

“No, Elise. Ten-thirty is it,” replied Gary coolly.
“But everyone else gets to stay out till midnight at least!”"|"Empire of Imagination"|"Michael Witwer"

"ap 06:30"|"six thirty"|"Elise had indeed blossomed into a very fetching young woman, sharing in her mother’s good looks and fiery red hair. Unsurprisingly, she had started attracting the attention of many young men around town, including crushes from several of Gary’s gaming buddies. This night, however, she had been set up on a blind date by a friend, and the exciting evening would entail watching a local garage band perform, among other things. The would-be suitor was due to show up at six thirty, but now it appeared the evening would be embarrassingly short because of her ten-thirty curfew."|"Empire of Imagination"|"Michael Witwer"

Though still quite rigorous, his schedule was roughly 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. daily, seven days per week—a noted reduction from past binges of work that sometimes consumed up to twenty-four hours straight. Gary, like the genius Thomas Edison, could get by on just a few hours of sleep per night, and this new approach allowed most evenings to be “strictly family time.” Nonetheless, he had committed significant time and resources to the Lejendary Adventures project and had high expectations for its success."|"Empire of Imagination"|"Michael Witwer"
