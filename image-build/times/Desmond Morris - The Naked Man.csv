"ap 07:49"|7.49|"When a hair drops out, both the long shaft and the short root become detached, but the tiny papilla at the base of the follicle stays put. This little bud then starts to sprout a new hair to replace the old one. It remains active for another six years, when it once again stops growing new cells and becomes dormant. After another three-month resting period it sheds its old hair and repeats the whole process. With our extended lifespan today, each papilla can be expected to repeat its life cycle about twelve times, creating twelve complete hairs, one after the other, each hair being several feet in length. It follows from this that if an individual human being lacked the dormant phase in the hair cycle, he or she would be able to grow locks of hair up to 30 feet in length. This freak condition does seem to have occurred at least once. Swami Pandarasannadhi, an Indian monk from a monastery near Madras, was reported to have unkempt hair that stretched for 26 feet (7.49 m)."|"The Naked Man"|"Desmond Morris"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"According to the pro-beard lobby there are several advantages to being bearded, even today. Wearing a beard, they say, makes a man look more virile, mature and dominant. It can make a weak face look stronger, a plain face more interesting and gives the impression of independence, wisdom and mystery. In purely practical terms, wearing a beard saves money on shaving equipment as well as saving time and energy spent shaving each morning. Men who eschew shaving do not have to worry about morning stubble or five o’clock shadow and they can avoid cuts, scrapes and nicks. A beard can conceal facial scars, compensate for baldness, and has the added appeal that it provides something to stroke, twiddle and even suck. A bearded man is one who refuses to follow the herd and bow to the dominant, clean-shaven fashion."|"The Naked Man"|"Desmond Morris"
"ap 07:10"|7:10|"The ideal waist/hip ratio for women is 7:10, that for the male 9:10. When men were shown a series of pictures of women with varying waist/hip ratios and were asked to indicate which was the most attractive, they chose the 7 to 10 ratio. In a similar test, when women were shown a series of pictures of men with varying waist/hip ratios and were asked to indicate which was the most attractive, they chose the 9 to 10 ratio. The response to these contour differences appears to be deep-seated and it is interesting that the distribution of male and female fat deposits appears to support them. When a woman puts on weight, she changes less in the waist region than elsewhere. In this way, although her body may be getting heavier, her crucial waist/hip ratio is to some extent protected. When a man puts on weight, his waistline is not protected in this way."|"The Naked Man"|"Desmond Morris"

In this, good fortune for a coming year depends on the arrival on your doorstep of the First Foot of the New Year, no more than a few minutes after midnight as 31 December becomes 1 January. The newcomer must be carrying gifts and, if the household is to prosper for the next twelve months, he must be a dark male stranger who does not suffer from flat feet. It is vital that he enters the house with his right foot, as the left foot is considered extremely unlucky."|"The Naked Man"|"Desmond Morris"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"Finally, a word about the name ‘football’. It has always been assumed that this title refers to the fact that the world’s favourite game involves kicking a ball with the foot. This is so obvious that nobody has ever questioned it, but it happens to be wrong. Football has been played in Britain for nearly a thousand years and, for most of that time, the male foot was not much involved. The early form of folk football was a rough and ready sport, played by large crowds who wrestled for the ball and, once gaining it, held on to it as tightly as possible. To have kicked it into the milling crowd would have lost it. This handling game was so rowdy that it was repeatedly banned, but refused to disappear. It can still be seen in a few places, even today. At Ashbourne in Derbyshire the medieval game is played each year on Shrove Tuesday and Ash Wednesday, when up to two thousand players assemble in the town centre. The ball is ceremonially thrown into the crowd at two o’clock and the huge scrum then fight for it and try to get it to one of the two goals, which are several miles apart. If nobody has succeeded by late in the evening, the game is called off."|"The Naked Man"|"Desmond Morris"
