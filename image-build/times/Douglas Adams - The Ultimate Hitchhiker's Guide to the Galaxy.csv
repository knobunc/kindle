"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"At eight o’clock on Thursday morning Arthur didn’t feel very good. He woke up blearily, got up, wandered blearily round his room, opened a window, saw a bulldozer, found his slippers, and stomped off to the bathroom to wash."|"The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"|"Douglas Adams"
"> 16:00"|"just after four in the afternoon"|"“My God,” complained Arthur, “you’re talking about a positive mental attitude and you haven’t even had your planet demolished today. I woke up this morning and thought I’d have a nice relaxed day, do a bit of reading, brush the dog.… It’s now just after four in the afternoon and I’m already being thrown out of an alien spaceship six light-years from the smoking remains of the Earth!” He spluttered and gurgled as the Vogon tightened his grip."|"The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"|"Douglas Adams"
"ap ~ 03:00"|"about three"|"In front of them, equidistant between their control desk and the middle of the chamber, where Trillian stood, as if on trial, was a slim white pillar about four feet tall. On top of it stood a small white globe, about three, maybe four inches in diameter."|"The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"|"Douglas Adams"
"ap 10:30"|ten-thirty|"It was ten-thirty when he arrived, a fact he discovered from the steamed and greasy window of the Horse and Groom pub, in which there had hung for many years a battered old Guinness clock which featured a picture of an emu with a pint glass jammed rather amusingly down its throat."|"The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"|"Douglas Adams"
00:00|midnight|"The wind flicked about a little, like the tail of a horse that’s trying to decide what sort of mood it’s in tonight, and a bell somewhere chimed midnight."|"The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"|"Douglas Adams"
"ap 01:32"|"one … thirty-two"|"At the third stroke it will be one … thirty-two … and twenty seconds.”"|"The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"|"Douglas Adams"

"ap 01:32"|"one … thirty-two"|"He looked into the tiny sleeping quarters.
“ … one … thirty-two …”
It sounded a bit muffled. There was a towel hanging over one of the speakers. He took down the towel."|"The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"|"Douglas Adams"
"ap 01:33"|"one … thirty-three"|"He waited for the green light to show and then opened the door again onto the new empty cargo hold.
“ … one … thirty-three … and fifty seconds.”
Very nice."|"The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"|"Douglas Adams"
"ap 01:34"|"one … thirty-four"|"He then went and had a last thorough examination of the emergency suspended animation chamber, which was where he particularly wanted it to be heard.
“At the third stroke it will be one … thirty-four … precisely.”
He shivered as he peered down through the heavily frosted covering at the dim bulk of the form within. One day, who knew when, it would wake, and when it did, it would know what time it was. Not exactly local time, true, but what the heck."|"The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"|"Douglas Adams"
"ap 01:34"|"one … thirty-four"|"He tiptoed out and returned to the control cabin.
“ … one … thirty-four and twenty seconds.”
The voice sounded as clear as if he were hearing it over a phone in London, which he wasn’t, not by a long way."|"The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"|"Douglas Adams"
"ap 01:59"|"One … fifty-nine"|"For twenty minutes he sat and merely watched as the gap between the ship and Epun closed, as the ship’s computer teased and kneaded the numbers that would bring it into a loop around the little moon, close the loop and keep it there, orbiting in perpetual obscurity.
“One … fifty-nine …”
His original plan had been to close down all external signaling and radiation from the ship, to render it as nearly invisible as possible unless you were actually looking at it, but then he’d had an idea he preferred. It would now emit one single continuous beam, pencil thin, broadcasting the incoming time signal to the planet of the signal’s origin, which it would not reach for four hundred years, traveling at light-speed, but where it would probably cause something of a stir when it did."|"The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"|"Douglas Adams"
"ap 02:13"|"two … thirteen"|"As his tiny little cigar tube of an escape craft zipped out on the beginning of its three-day journey to the orbiting space station Port Sesefron, it rode for a few seconds a long pencil-thin beam of radiation that was starting out on a longer journey still.
“At the third stroke, it will be two … thirteen … and fifty seconds.”
He giggled and sniggered. He would have laughed out loud but he didn’t have room."|"The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"|"Douglas Adams"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"That night, at home, as he was prancing round the house pretending to be tripping through cornfields in slow motion and continually exploding with sudden laughter, Arthur thought he could even bear to listen to the album of bagpipe music he had won. It was eight o’clock and he decided he would make himself, force himself, to listen to the whole record before he phoned her. Maybe he should even leave it till tomorrow. That would be the cool thing to do. Or next week sometime."|"The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"|"Douglas Adams"
"ap > 06:00"|"Just after six"|"Just after six he returned to Fenchurch’s house in the alleyway, clutching a bottle of champagne."|"The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"|"Douglas Adams"
"ap 04:00"|four|"“At four he got up and went to the bathroom again. He opened the door to the bathroom …” and so on."|"The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"|"Douglas Adams"
17:00|"five o’clock in the afternoon"|"The giant robot had lurched back aboard the ship at lunchtime, and now it was five o’clock in the afternoon and no further sign had been seen of it. Much had been heard—more grindings and rumblings from deep within the craft, the music of a million hideous malfunctions; but the sense of tense expectation among the crowd was born of the fact that they tensely expected to be disappointed. This wonderful extraordinary thing had come into their lives, and now it was simply going to go without them."|"The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"|"Douglas Adams"
"ap 04:31"|"four-thirty one"|"Arthur didn’t even know if Lamuella had had a Paleozoic era. According to Old Thrashbarg, the planet had been found fully formed in the navel of a giant earwig at four-thirty one Vroonday afternoon, and although Arthur, as a seasoned Galactic traveler with good O-level passes in physics and geography, had fairly serious doubts about this, it was rather a waste of time trying to argue with Old Thrashbarg and there had never been much point before."|"The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"|"Douglas Adams"
"ap ~ 04:00"|"about four o’clock"|"It was about four o’clock on Monday afternoon, and she had a kind of sick feeling. She was trying to work out what the cause of this slightly sick feeling was, and there was no shortage of candidates."|"The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"|"Douglas Adams"
"> 18:30"|"just after six-thirty in the evening"|"Ford and Arthur had come screaming down out of the stratosphere and parked neatly on Portland Place. It was just after six-thirty in the evening and there were spaces free. They mingled briefly with the crowd that gathered around to ogle, then said loudly that if no one else was going to call the police, they would, and made good their escape."|"The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"|"Douglas Adams"
"ap 01:00"|one|"“For all I know,” said Gargravarr’s ethereal voice, “I’m probably at one. My body that is. It goes to a lot of parties without me. Says I only get in the way. Hey ho.”"|"The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"|"Douglas Adams"
00:00|midnight|"The bathtub stood on a six-foot pedestal of rough-hewn blue water crystal and was of a baroque monstrosity not often seen outside the Maximegalon Museum of Diseased Imaginings. An intestinal jumble of plumbing had been picked out in gold leaf rather than decently buried at midnight in an unmarked grave; the taps and shower attachment would have made a gargoyle jump."|"The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"|"Douglas Adams"
"< 12:00"|"Shortly before noon"|"Shortly before noon they had their first indication that the world they had landed on was not an uninhabited one: a half-glimpsed face among the trees, watching them. It vanished at the moment they both saw it, but the image they were both left with was of a humanoid creature, curious to see them but not alarmed. Half an hour later they glimpsed another such face, and ten minutes after that another."|"The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"|"Douglas Adams"
"ap ~ 02:55"|"about 2:55"|"In the end, it was the Sunday afternoons he couldn’t cope with, and that terrible listlessness that starts to set in at about 2:55, when you know you’ve taken all the baths you can usefully take that day, that however hard you stare at any given paragraph in the newspaper you will never actually read it, or use the revolutionary new pruning technique it describes, and that as you stare at the clock the hands will move relentlessly on to four o’clock, and you will enter the long dark teatime of the soul."|"The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"|"Douglas Adams"
