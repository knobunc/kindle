"ap 09:27"|9-27|"As the oldest boy at Long Tomorrows, Jun Do had responsibilities—portioning the food, assigning bunks, renaming the new boys from the list of the 114 Grand Martyrs of the Revolution. Even so, the Orphan Master was serious about showing no favoritism to his son, the only boy at Long Tomorrows who wasn’t an orphan. When the rabbit warren was dirty, it was Jun Do who spent the night locked in it. When boys wet their bunks, it was Jun Do who chipped the frozen piss off the floor. Jun Do didn’t brag to the other boys that he was the son of the Orphan Master, rather than some kid dropped off by parents on their way to a 9-27 camp. If someone wanted to figure it out, it was pretty obvious—Jun Do had been there before all of them, and the reason he’d never been adopted was because his father would never let someone take his only son. And it made sense that after his mother was stolen to Pyongyang, his father had applied for the one position that would allow him to both earn a living and watch over his son."|"The Orphan Master's Son"|"Adam Johnson"
00:00|midnight|"That was the end of their practice. It was time to get the opera lady. Officer So was to cross the Sea of Japan on a fishing vessel, while Jun Do and Gil took the overnight ferry from Chongjin to Niigata. At midnight, with the singer in hand, they would meet Officer So on the beach. Simplicity, Officer So said, was the key to the plan."|"The Orphan Master's Son"|"Adam Johnson"
12:00|"High Noon"|"“Have you seen this movie High Noon?” Dr. Song asked them. “It is the Minister’s favorite.”"|"The Orphan Master's Son"|"Adam Johnson"
12:00|midday|"The ranch house was single-level and half hidden by trees, deceptively sprawling. A nearby corral contained picnic tables and a “chuckwagon” grill, where several people were lined up for lunch. The cicadas were active, and Jun Do could smell the cooking coals. A midday breeze stirred, heading for anvil clouds too distant to promise rain. Free-roaming dogs leaped in and out of the corral’s fencing. At one point the dogs noticed something moving in a distant bush. They stood at attention, bristling. Walking past, the Senator said, “Hunt,” and at the command, the dogs raced off to flush a group of small birds that ran quickly through the brush."|"The Orphan Master's Son"|"Adam Johnson"
00:00|midnight|"Out in the corral was where Jun Do found him, sitting at a wooden picnic table. There was a midnight wind. Clouds flashed across a newly risen moon. Dr. Song had changed back into a suit and a tie."|"The Orphan Master's Son"|"Adam Johnson"
00:00|midnight|"The pilots pulled the blocks and spun the plane, nose into the wind. They cycled the engines, but before lifting over the dark, choppy water, they opened the bilge, slopping out all the plane’s sewage in a midnight streak down the runway."|"The Orphan Master's Son"|"Adam Johnson"
00:00|MIDNIGHT|"IT WAS MIDNIGHT before Division 42 approved our emergency memos. With our interrogation override authorization in hand, we went down into the torture wing, a place our team rarely went, to rescue Commander Ga. We had the interns check the hot boxes, even though the red lights were off. We checked the sense-dep cells and the time-out tanks, where subjects got some first aid and a chance to catch their breath. We lifted the floor hatch and descended down the ladders into the sump. There were many lost souls down there, all of them too far gone to be Ga, but still, we checked the names on their ankle bracelets and lifted their heads long enough to shine a light in their slow-to-dilate eyes. Finally, with trepidation, we checked a room the old-timers called the shop. It was dark when we swung open the door—there was only the occasional winking glint of a slowly turning power tool, suspended from the ceiling by its yellow pneumatic hose. When we threw the power switch, the air-recirc system started up and the banks of fluorescents flashed to life. The room—spotless, sterile—contained only chrome, marble, and the white clouds of our own breath."|"The Orphan Master's Son"|"Adam Johnson"
03:30|"three thirty in the morning"|"Just then, I saw Q-Kee walk past in the hall. It was three thirty in the morning! The shock-work whistles wouldn’t blow for another two hours. I called to her, but she kept going."|"The Orphan Master's Son"|"Adam Johnson"
00:00|midnight|"It was midnight when I made it home. Though the key turned in the lock, the door wouldn’t open. It was somehow barricaded from within. I pounded on the door. “Mother,” I called. “Father, it’s me, your son. There’s something wrong with the door. You must open it for me.” I pleaded for a while, then put my shoulder to the wood, leaning into it some, but not too hard. Breaking down a door would cause much discussion in the building. Finally, I buttoned my smock and lay down in the hall. I tried to think of the sounds of the crickets and the children running in the dark, but when I closed my eyes I could imagine only cold cement. I thought of the peasants with their ropy bodies and harsh manner of speaking, of how, except for starvation, they didn’t have a care in the world."|"The Orphan Master's Son"|"Adam Johnson"
01:00|"one that rowed all night"|"“There was a time,” he told her. “It seems like another life. I had a job transcribing radio transmissions on the sea. I listened from sunset to sunrise, and in the darkest hour, I’d hear her, the Girl Rower. She and her friend were rowing around the world, but this one, she was the one that rowed all night, without the horizon to steer toward or the sun to mark her progress. She was forever bound to the other rower, yet completely alone. She labored forward solely on duty, her body bowing to the oars, but her mind, the broadcasts she made, never had a woman sounded so free.”"|"The Orphan Master's Son"|"Adam Johnson"
12:00|midday|"I walked to the kitchen. From a drawer, I removed the can opener. I paused there at the window. Spending my days underground, I wasn’t used to the midday brightness. I observed the spoon and pan and hot plate my mother cooked with. I stared at the drying rack, where two glass bowls caught the light. I decided against bowls."|"The Orphan Master's Son"|"Adam Johnson"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"I adjusted the output dial of his autopilot. Ga had a strong mind, so I set it at eight."|"The Orphan Master's Son"|"Adam Johnson"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"I climbed into the next blue chair, but didn’t bother with the restraints. I wanted the Pubyok to know that I’d chosen my own path, that I’d rejected their ways. I hooked up my own wiring harness and turned my attention to the autopilot’s output dial. I never wanted to remember a thing about this place, so I set it at eight and a half. But then again, I didn’t want a lobotomy, either. I adjusted it to seven and a half. And if I was being intimate with myself, I could also admit I was afraid of the pain. I settled for six and a half."|"The Orphan Master's Son"|"Adam Johnson"
