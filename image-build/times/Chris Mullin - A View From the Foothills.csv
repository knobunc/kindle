As a precaution, I came armed with a 15-minute speech which, if the worst came to the worst, I could just read out. It was a low-key debate. No one, apart from Shaun Woodward (who spoke for the Tories) wanted to score cheap points in the wake of the Paddington tragedy. Don Foster led for the Lib Dems with a very competent, sober speech. Keith Hill, for our side, made a similar response. The complicating factor was the large, brooding presence of JP. Transport, of course, is something he knows all about. As Shaun Woodward got into his stride, JP started muttering, cursing, heckling. Before long he was keeping up a continual barrage, winding up Woodward still further. ‘You want the politics, I’ll give you the politics,’ he shouted. With that he started drafting notes for me to use in reply. There were references to dates (apparently plucked from the air), committees of inquiry headed by people of whom I had never heard, mysterious acronyms … All scribbled in barely legible black felt pen, accompanied by a continuous, high-speed, running commentary. On he went, long after Woodward had sat down. Confusion reigned. I began to panic. Visions of a breakdown at the Dispatch Box loomed. Notes were now pouring in from officials in the civil servants’ box responding to points other speakers were making, but I could hardly absorb the contents, let alone hear what was being said, because of the overwhelming, disruptive presence of JP. Fortunately, with about an hour of debate to go, he finally shut up and I managed to sort the notes into some sort of order. At 9.15 a new crisis dawned. A whip, David Jamieson, appeared, to say that the debate was drying up and I might have to speak for more than half an hour instead of the expected 15 minutes.

It was apparently based on quotes from an adjournment debate a week ago. At no stage had I used the word ‘boycott’. All I said was that exhortations from politicians were not likely to cut much ice with a hard-nosed commercial institution like Barclays, but there was nothing to stop customers voting with their feet.

One detective of seven years’ experience claimed improbably that he took home the same as a ‘pasty stacker’ in Gregg’s, the baker’s. Faced with this, one or two of our colleagues opted for appeasement. David Miliband made a brave attempt to hold the line.

I have ended up offending not just The Sisters, but a number of my friends. I had put down an amendment forcing a separate vote on Wednesday sittings which Robin – fearing he might lose – was anxious to avoid. He was not best pleased and circulated a crib sheet describing mine as ‘a wrecking amendment’. The modernisers were well organised and when I got up to speak they were all around me heckling and trying to intervene. ‘Get a life,’ shouted that ambitious pipsqueak from the Rhondda. I was doing all right until about halfway when I chanced a little joke. (‘If I was a spouse living at the other end of the country, I would want to be assured that my other half was snug in the warm bosom of the Mother of Parliaments and not wandering the streets with too much time on his hands and too much money in his pockets.’) From this point onwards they all went bananas. The harassment became so bad that the Deputy Speaker had to intervene in order that I be heard. I sat down to some hear-hearing from the Tories, but with just about everyone else I had blown it. Jean Corston was furious with me for not giving way to her in the debate. She thought I’d deliberately ignored her, but in truth I hadn’t seen her (I eventually managed to convince her of this). Dawn Primarolo, a friend for over 20 years, told me that she thought my speech was ‘despicable’. Even so, the vote when it came was close. There was some tension since no one had a clue how it would go. In the event it was carried 274 to 267. So they only just got away with it. We have once again voted for our own convenience over the public interest. (Diane Abbott told me she had voted for the reduction in hours ‘out of naked self-interest’.) The quality of scrutiny will not be improved one iota. On the contrary, it will be diminished. How on earth are we going to cram all the activity that goes on in this place – select committees, standing committees, backbench committees – into a day that is three hours shorter?

I cannot suddenly switch just because it is inconvenient. A cannier politician would have kept his head down and his mouth closed, but I am not made that way.

Armed with a list of telephone numbers for the movers and shakers in the constituency I repaired to a phone booth (my office walls are paper thin) and began to work the phones, starting with Paul Watson, Charles Bate and John Donnelly. I explained that this had become an issue of confidence and there was a danger of regime change here, never mind in Iraq, whereupon they all said they would back me if I were to change my mind. I then called Sam Glatt and John Hargrave to whom I had categorically asserted, as recently as last Friday, that in the absence of a second resolution I would not be supporting the government. They were unimpressed by my assertion that The Man could fall if this went wrong. ‘He’s not indispensable,’ said Sam. Sue Lane said likewise.

He had been asked by Keith Hill to request that I think again. I tracked down Tommy Wright and Dave Allan, expecting them to be pragmatists, but they weren’t. ‘A lot of people in Sunderland respect you,’ said Tommy urging me not to throw it away. Dave Allan was blunter: ‘It’s not just Blair’s integrity that’s at stake, it’s yours too.’ That did it. I telephoned Fraser saying I was sticking to my guns.

I explained that I had telephoned as many of the movers and shakers in my party as I could find and most of them were urging me to stand firm. Hilary, who knows Sunderland well, responded that my constituents would be in favour of the government’s stand by a margin of two to one. My neighbour, Bill Etherington, was already in the rebel lobby, so it was only fair that those in favour of war should be represented, too. Finally, she deployed her most devastating weapon: ‘If Tony goes, he’ll take the entire Cabinet with him and there will be a general election.’ I said I didn’t think that was very likely, but she seemed to think it was a possibility.

Later, I heard that Valerie Amos had been appointed and that the announcement had been made within half an hour of Clare making the call, so it was obviously all sorted well in advance. Jack and the Foreign Office have staged a coup. Valerie was only a Lords whip when I was at DFID and, until today, one of Jack’s junior ministers. The contrast with Clare couldn’t be more blatant and having a secretary of state who is beyond the reach of scrutiny by the elected House is not at all satisfactory.

When challenged he claimed to be looking for a friend in Camberwell New Road, half a mile away, but instead of heading in that direction he disappeared around the corner into Lorn Road. I found him in the back lane, apparently casing the rear of our terrace. A white male, in his late thirties, of south European appearance but with a London accent. A can of lager in one hand (at 9 a.m.), ‘criminal’ written all over him in large letters. On seeing me, he turned nasty. ‘Are you calling me a burglar,’ he snarled putting his face menacingly close to mine. ‘I don’t know what you are up to,’ I replied angrily, ‘I’ve been done three times already this year and I’m fed up with it.’ I thought he was going to hit me at first, but he dawdled brazenly away up Lorn Road, still peering in windows. When I got to the House 15 minutes later, I rang Brixton police station, but the phone didn’t answer. I rang Kennington, but that didn’t answer either. I rang the direct line of DC Adams, the officer who has been dealing with my latest burglary.

"~ 00:00"|"around midnight"|"In the late afternoon we flew down to Nairobi where Edward Clay had arranged a dinner at the Muthaiga Club (where the recent John le Carré was filmed) with half a dozen ambassadors, to discuss Somalia. I did an interview with the BBC. Then, police cars fore and aft, we were taken in convoy back to the airport, departing for London just around midnight. What a day."|"A View From the Foothills"|"Chris Mullin"
12:00|noon|"Help is at hand. Caron and Bharat have managed to secure the services of a couple of professional speechwriters, one of whom is going to do the consular debate and the other is promising a terrorism speech by noon tomorrow."|"A View From the Foothills"|"Chris Mullin"

"ap > 06:00"|"just after six"|"The Blunkett crisis refuses to die. I ran into John Williams, who said, ‘Jack is so angry that I’m afraid he’ll say something publicly and lose the high ground.’ Later, just after six, as I was making my way to the Foreign Office Christmas party in the Locarno Room, it was announced that Blunkett had resigned. Whereupon up popped Jack and paid a dignified little tribute. A professional to his fingertips."|"A View From the Foothills"|"Chris Mullin"

"ap 08:40"|08.40|"When we arrived last night, I parked in the ‘Residents only’ section on Groveway, intending to move before the 08.30 witching hour. Alas, however, I arrived ten minutes late to find that not only had I been issued with a £60 ticket but that the car was shackled and on the point of being hoisted onto the back of a ‘parking enforcement’ truck; had I arrived a minute later it would have cost a minimum of £250 to retrieve. This is at 08.40 on New Year’s Eve in a half-deserted street, for goodness’ sake. How can this be justified for an offence specified on the ticket as being illegally parked between 08.36 and 08.38? Surely, a decent interval is supposed to elapse between ticketing and removal, indeed that used to be the case. Now, it seems, the newly privatised traffic wardens and the driver of the tow-away truck operate in tandem. ‘This is Lambeth,’ remarked the truck driver as he cheerfully removed the shackles from the car; the traffic warden, on the other hand, was surly. We had the following exchange."|"A View From the Foothills"|"Chris Mullin"

Then to the Hilton for a prayer breakfast presided over by presidents Obasanjo, Njuoma, Kagame and Museveni, together with AU chairman Konare and Kofi Annan. They each took turns to read a lesson. All except Museveni (introduced by Obasanjo as ‘that great son of Africa’), who was called upon to deliver the homily. He started with a line from Deuteronomy about borrowing. ‘Africans specialise in borrowing. If they lend, they lend in ignorance. Uganda has been a donor many times, but we donate in ignorance. A kilo of raw cotton costs a dollar, yarn three dollars, finished cloth ten dollars. So Uganda has been donating at least nine dollars a kilo to the West …’"|"A View From the Foothills"|"Chris Mullin"

As we take off it occurs to me that this could be the last time I set foot on the soil of Africa. There will be no more outings between now and the election and, after that, who knows?"|"A View From the Foothills"|"Chris Mullin"
"ap > 08:00"|"just after eight"|"
Touched down at Heathrow just after eight and straight to the office.
My first visitor was Michael Williams, who is concerned that Jack may give too much away to the Americans on the International Criminal Court and Sudan. Condi Rice is coming tomorrow and Mike is afraid that we may sign up to the American position, which is wholly untenable and will make us look foolish. I immediately penned a minute which I placed personally in Jack’s hands, after he had finished his statement on the EU White Paper. He was equivocal: ‘I don’t want to get into a head to head with Condi on this one. She’s a very tricky woman, nervous too. If it was Colin Powell, it would be different. It’s about tactics, not principle. We need to play it long.’ Personally, I can’t think of a better issue (Guantanamo apart) over which to take on the Americans. The rest of the world is on our side; and so is half the Administration; everybody except Rumsfeld and the President. We’d win, if we dug in our heels."|"A View From the Foothills"|"Chris Mullin"

The issue? Iraq, of course.

Kate, the cleaner, put her head around the door at around seven, but I drifted off again and didn’t even hear Big Ben strike eight. Banksie and I, urgently in need of fresh air and exercise, have agreed to meet at the Members’ Entrance after the next round of divisions and go out for a walk."|"A View From the Foothills"|"Chris Mullin"

All his children, and numerous grandchildren, were there along with a clutch of glamorous young women, including the actress Saffron Burrows. As for the old man, he was, as ever, on sparkling form although he seems to be shrinking a little, as you do when you get old. Nothing much has changed, he’s still chasing around all over the country, stirring. Joshua said to me, ‘You ring at 7.30 a.m. to see how he is, only to find that he’s already gone out. You call again at midnight only to discover that he’s not yet home …’"|"A View From the Foothills"|"Chris Mullin"

20:00|20.00|"My last official engagements in London before the election: I addressed a meeting in the Moses Room of the Lords to commemorate the anniversary of the Rwandan genocide. Then a cup of tea with Paul Boateng, who has given up his seat to become (assuming we win) our High Commissioner in South Africa. I had meant to clear my personal effects from my desk in the Foreign Office to spare the humiliation of having them handed over in a plastic bag, if I don’t come back, but there wasn’t time. Finally, to King’s Cross for the 20.00 train to the north. On Westminster tube station I overtook David Drew (Stroud, majority 5,000), also on his way home. He was trying to sound optimistic, but the odds are he won’t be coming back.* Thank goodness I’m in a safe seat. I couldn’t bear to be out of work in my fifties with two young children to support."|"A View From the Foothills"|"Chris Mullin"
15:00|"3 p.m."|"By 3 p.m. it was all over. I then had two long bilateral meetings with Djinnit and Adeniji and then we climbed into our silver Audi, raced back to our hotel, waved goodbye to our police escort and (as soon as they were out of sight) Bharat and I slipped out for a two-hour walk."|"A View From the Foothills"|"Chris Mullin"
12:00|noon|"To York Terrace, Silksworth, where gangs of truanting, feral youths are making a misery of the lives of the law-abiding citizens who live along the old railway track (now a cycle path) that used to connect the pit villages to the port. They want my help to close the cut that enables raiding parties of youths to come and go at will. Personally, I doubt whether closing the cut will make much difference. The problem has many causes – not least that 15 years after The Fall of Thatcher we are still manufacturing semi-literate, unemployable, useless youths, many of them second- or third-generation yob culture. I promise to do what I can, however, even though the local authority has already produced a list of reasons why nothing can be done. After leaving the complainants, I took a stroll down the said cut to the railway track and, sure enough, there were a gang of seven or eight youths up to no good in the bushes behind the terrace, some lobbing stones at the houses. And this at noon on a Friday. Goodness knows what they get up to after dark. On the way back to the office I stop off at the local community police, who, in keeping with the spirit of the times, are now based in the local school. We have a friendly enough chat, but it is a bit worrying that all half-dozen of them are sitting desk-bound in a hermetically sealed room rather than out and about among their flock. What must we do to get these guys to engage with the public they are supposed to be serving?"|"A View From the Foothills"|"Chris Mullin"
"ap ~ 03:00"|"around three"|"Our count was over in 42 minutes, shaving a minute off our previous record. So once again, for about 40 minutes, I was the only MP in the country. It was clear from the exit polls that we were going to win so I gave Version One of the speech, which was apparently broadcast live. It rang a bit hollow, though, because we were clearly in for a bad night. The little people were in bed by about one. Ngoc and I sat up until around three, when it became clear that Steve Twigg had lost at Enfield.* The wheel has come full circle."|"A View From the Foothills"|"Chris Mullin"
