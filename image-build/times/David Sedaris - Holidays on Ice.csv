I have an appointment next Wednesday at noon.
I am a thirty-three-year-old man applying for a job as an elf."|"Holidays on Ice"|"David Sedaris"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"I spent my eight-hour day with fifty elves and one perky, well-meaning instructor in an enormous Macy’s classroom, the walls
         of which were lined with NCR 2152’s. A 2152, I have come to understand, is a cash register. The class was broken up into study
         groups and given assignments. My group included several returning elves and a few experienced cashiers who tried helping me
         by saying things like, “Don’t you even know your personal ID code? Jesus, I had mine memorized by ten o’clock.”"|"Holidays on Ice"|"David Sedaris"
12:00|noon|"The angry people must have said something to management because I was taken off the Magic Star and sent to Elf Island, which
         is really boring as all you do is stand around and act merry. At noon a huge crowd of retarded people came to visit Santa
         and passed me on my little island. These people were profoundly retarded. They were rolling their eyes and wagging their tongues
         and staggering toward Santa. It was a large group of retarded people and after watching them for a few minutes I could not
         begin to guess where the retarded people ended and the regular New Yorkers began."|"Holidays on Ice"|"David Sedaris"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"I witnessed a fistfight between two mothers and watched while a woman experienced a severe, crowd-related anxiety attack:
         falling to the floor and groping for breath, her arms moving as though she were fighting off bats. A Long Island father called
         Santa a faggot because he couldn’t take the time to recite “The Night Before Christmas” to his child. Parents in long lines
         left disposable diapers at the door to Santa’s house. It was the rowdiest crowd I have ever seen, and we were short on elves,
         many of whom simply did not show up or called in sick. As a result we had our lunch hours cut in half and had to go without
         our afternoon breaks. Many elves complained bitterly, but the rest of us found ourselves in the moment we had all been waiting
         for. It was us against them. It was time to be a trouper, and I surrendered completely. My Santa and I had them on the lap,
         off the lap in forty-five seconds flat. We were an efficient machine surrounded by chaos. Quitting time came and went for
         the both of us and we paid it no mind. My plane was due to leave at eight o’clock, and I stayed until the last moment, figuring
         the time it would take to get to the airport. It was with reservation that I reported to the manager, telling her I had to
         leave. She was at a cash register, screaming at a customer. She was, in fact, calling this customer a bitch. I touched her
         arm and said, “I have to go now.” She laid her hand on my shoulder, squeezed it gently, and continued her conversation, saying,
         “Don’t tell the store president I called you a bitch. Tell him I called you a fucking bitch, because that’s exactly what you
         are. Now get out of my sight before I do something we both regret.”"|"Holidays on Ice"|"David Sedaris"
"ap 07:54"|"six to eight"|"Oscar finished his story just as we arrived at the station. He was an amiable guy — very good company — but when he offered
         to wait until my train arrived I begged off, claiming I had some calls to make. Sitting alone in the vast, vibrant terminal,
         surrounded by thousands of polite, seemingly interesting Dutch people, I couldn’t help but feel second-rate. Yes, the Netherlands
         was a small country, but it had six to eight black men and a really good bedtime story. Being a fairly competitive person,
         I felt jealous, then bitter. I was edging toward hostile when I remembered the blind hunter tramping off alone into the Michigan
         forest. He may bag a deer, or he may happily shoot a camper in the stomach. He may find his way back to the car, or he may
         wander around for a week or two before stumbling through your back door. We don’t know for sure, but in pinning that license
         to his chest, he inspires the sort of narrative that ultimately makes me proud to be an American."|"Holidays on Ice"|"David Sedaris"
17:00|"five P.M."|"After the trial, I watched as another female pathologist collected maggots from a spinal column found in the desert. There
         was a decomposed head, too, and before leaving work she planned to simmer it and study the exposed cranium for contusions.
         I was asked to pass this information along to the chief medical examiner, and, looking back, I perhaps should have chosen
         my words more carefully. “Fire up the kettle,” I told him. “Ol’-fashioned skull boil at five P.M.”"|"Holidays on Ice"|"David Sedaris"
"~ 00:00"|"around midnight"|"It was just the four of us until around midnight, when a tipsy man in a Daytona Beach sweatshirt came to the front gate and
         asked for a tour. When the transporters refused him, he gestured toward an idling car and got his girlfriend to ask. The young
         woman was lovely and flirtatious, and as she pressed herself against the gate I imagined her lying upon an autopsy table,
         her organs piled in a glistening heap beside her. I now looked at everyone this way, and it worried me that I’d never be able
         to stop. This was the consequence of seeing too much and understanding the horrible truth: No one is safe. The world is not
         manageable. The trick-or-treater may not be struck down on Halloween, but sooner or later he is going to get it, as am I,
         and everyone I have ever cared about."|"Holidays on Ice"|"David Sedaris"
12:00|Noon|"Not wanting to spoil anyone’s Christmas, the turkey announced that he would be spending the holiday with relatives. “The wild
         side of the family,” he said. “Just flew in last night from Kentucky.” Noon arrived, and when the farmer and his middle son
         appeared in the barnyard, the turkey went to them without a fuss, saying, “So long everyone” and “See you in a few days.”"|"Holidays on Ice"|"David Sedaris"
"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"It wasn’t difficult to see through Lonnie Tipit. He wanted one thing and one thing only. “If not me, then I can suggest another
         tutor,” he said. Someone like who? Someone like him? Regardless of who the English teacher was, I am not in the habit of throwing
         my money away. And that, my friends, is what it would have amounted to. Why not hire an expensive private tutor to teach the
         squirrels to speak in French! It would be no more ridiculous than teaching Khe Sahn English. A person has to want to learn. I know that. Apparently, back in Ho Chi Minh City, Her Majesty was treated like a queen and sees no reason to change
         her ways!!!! Her Highness rises at around noon, wolfs down a fish or two (all she eats is fish and chicken breasts), and settles
         herself before the makeup mirror, waiting for her father to return home from work. At the sound of his car in the driveway
         she perks up and races to the door like a spaniel, panting and wagging her tail to beat the band! Suddenly she is eager to
         please and attempt conversation!! Well, I don’t know how they behave in Vietnam, but in the United States it is not customary
         for a half-dressed daughter to offer her father a five-dollar massage!!! After having spent an exhausting day attempting to
         communicate a list of simple chores, I would stand in amazement at Khe Sahn’s sudden grasp of English when faced with my husband."|"Holidays on Ice"|"David Sedaris"
"ap 04:30"|four-thirty|"I can’t account for every moment of my afternoon. Never did it occur to me that I would one day be called upon to do so but,
         that being the case, I will report what I remember. I can comfortably testify that, on the afternoon of December sixteenth,
         I visited the White Paw Shopping Center, where I spent a brief amount of time in The Slack Heap, searching for a gift for
         Kyle. I found what he wanted but not in his size. I then left The Slack Heap and walked over to _______________&_____ ______,
         where I bought a _______________ for my daughter Jacki. (I’m not going to ruin anyone’s Christmas surprises here. Why should
         I?) I stuck my head inside Turtleneck Crossing and searched for candles at Wax and Wane. I bought a gift for Clifford at _____________,
         and I suppose I browsed. There are close to a hundred shops at the White Paw Center and you’ll have to forgive me if I can’t
         provide a detailed list of how long I spent in this or that store. I shopped until I grew wary of the time. On the way home
         I stopped at The Food Carnival and bought a few items. It was getting dark, perhaps four-thirty, when I pulled into the driveway
         of our home on Tiffany Circle. I collected my packages from the car and entered my home, where I was immediately struck by
         the eerie silence. “This doesn’t feel right to me,” I remember saying to myself. It was an intuition, a mother’s intuition,
         that unexplainable language of the senses. I laid down my bags and was startled by the sound they made — the crisp noise of
         paper bags settling against the floor. The problem was that I could hear the sound at all! Normally I would have heard nothing
         over the chronic bleating of Baby Don and the incessant blaring radio of Khe Sahn."|"Holidays on Ice"|"David Sedaris"
"ap ~ 01:15"|"around
         one-fifteen"|"You may have read that our so-called “neighbor” Cherise Clarmont-Shea reported that she witnessed me leaving my home at around
         one-fifteen on the afternoon of December sixteenth and then, twenty minutes later, allegedly park my car on the far corner
         of Tiffany and Papageorge and, in her words, “creep” through her backyard and in through my basement door!!!!!! Cherise Clarmont-Shea
         certainly understands the meaning of the word creep, doesn’t she? She’s been married to one for so long that she has turned into something of a creep herself!! How many times
         have I opened the door to Cherise, her face swollen and mustard-colored, suffering another of her husband’s violent slugfests!
         She’s been smacked in the face so many times she’s lucky if she can see anything through those swollen eyes of hers! If the
         makeup she applies is any indication of her vision, then I believe it is safe to say she can’t see two inches in front of
         her, much less testify to the identity of someone she might think she’s seen crossing her yard. She’s on pills, everyone knows
         that. She’s desperate for attention and I might pity her under different circumstances. I did not return home early and creep
         through the Sheas’ unkept backyard, but even if I had, what possible motive would I have had? Why would I, as certain people
         have been suggesting, want to murder my own grandchild? This is madness, pure and simple. It reminds me of a recurring nightmare
         I often have wherein I am desperately trying to defend myself against a heavily armed hand puppet. The grotesque puppet angrily
         accuses me of spray-painting slogans on his car. I have, of course, done no such thing. This is insane, preposterous, I think to myself. “This makes no sense,” I say, all the while eyeing the loaded weapon in his small hands and praying for
         this nightmare to end. Cherise Clarmont-Shea has no more sense than a hand puppet. She has three names! And the others who
         have made statements against me, Chaz Staples and Vivian Taps, they were both at home during a weekday afternoon doing guess
         what while their spouses were hard at work. What are they hiding? I feel it is of utmost importance to consider the source."|"Holidays on Ice"|"David Sedaris"

00:00|Midnight|"Stand in any one place for too long and a person is bound to get itchy feet. I found my voice with situation comedies, proved
         myself with dramas, and felt it was time to move on to the ratings boosters we like to call the “mini-series.” I’m sure at
         least a few of you are familiar with the concept. They’re called “mini” when, in fact, they tend to be much longer than a
         standard movie you’d see at the local theater. Part of this is due to the commercials, but it’s also our chance to dig in
         our heels and get to the real meat of the story. Sometimes these programs are based upon the novels written by many of your
         favorite authors, such as James Chutney and Jocelyn Hershey-Guest. I like to think we did real justice to Olivia Hightop’s
         “Midnight’s Cousin,” and E. Thomas Wallop’s searing historical saga “The Business End of the Stick.” As I said, often these
         mini-series are based upon works of fiction, but just as frequently we can find equally compelling material simply by opening
         our daily newspapers, contacting the survivors or perpetrators, and buying their stories, which are then adapted by any number
         of our skilled writers. This was the case with “The Boiling of Sister Katherine,” a tragic event which I think we explored
         with a great deal of dignity. Seeing as the nun in question was no longer with us, we bought the rights from the McCracken
         twins, who, regardless of their guilt or innocence, were an invaluable help to our writers, whose motto is “It’s always important
         to present at least one side of the story.” We recently aired another heartbreaking true-life drama, this one based upon a
         single mother forced to drown her own children, driving them into a lake in a desperate attempt to hold on to her handsome
         new boyfriend. “Sun Roof Optional” touched a lot of nerves and I was proud to be a part of it."|"Holidays on Ice"|"David Sedaris"
"ap 02:12"|"two hours and twelve minutes"|"Maybe you can let things happen in their own sweet time but me, I can’t wait that long. I have a plane to catch early this afternoon,

         his holiday sermon, so he’ll be talking about something else. Eventually though, he’s going to stop talking and you will have
         to start thinking. And I would advise you to think carefully. All I’m asking for is a few details. They’re little things,
         details, but they can make all the difference in the world when it comes to fulfilling a dream. Maybe while you’re thinking
         you can entertain a few detailed dreams of your own. I want you to imagine yourselves leaning back against the warm, fragrant
         upholstery of a brand-new automobile. Your healthy children are still fighting over who got to ride in the front seat but
         you don’t allow that to bother you. In time they’ll return their attention to that bounty of toys lying at their feet. Back
         at the house the ice cubes are eagerly awaiting the kiss of a finely aged bourbon, and there’s still enough money in your
         wallet to make your neighbor jealous. It’s Christmas Day, and all is right with the world."|"Holidays on Ice"|"David Sedaris"

         long after everyone else had finished doing the dishes. During the meal, Mr. Tomkey would occasionally pound the table and
