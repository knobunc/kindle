From the smell of it, this man had been a long time dying. The doctor did not relish a home death. It was the only time when she wished she was a hospital doctor and could hide in the sanitized hygiene of hospital death."|Trumpet|"Jackie Kay"

She said it was the first time she’d actually looked at the clock in what seemed like days. It had been 1.12 a.m. She had phoned some time later after she had sat with him alone for a while. She knew, she said, it was the last bit of peace she would get with him. Mrs Moody had the air of someone who has been coping for so long so well she didn’t know how to stop. The look of someone who would not cry for some time, who would organize the funeral efficiently and then break down in a heap in six months. Doctor Krishnamurty patted Mrs Moody on the arm and said, ‘You must be exhausted. Would you like me to prescribe a sleeping pill?’ Mrs Moody didn’t want a sleeping pill. She wanted the doctor to get on with it and leave her house. She wanted to be alone."|Trumpet|"Jackie Kay"

She then felt the pulse which was quite empty and listened to the heart which was silent. She undid the pyjamas to examine the body. There were many bandages wrapped around the chest of the deceased which she had to undo. The bandages were sticky and sweaty. They were very difficult to remove. Doctor Krishnamurty felt as if she was removing skin, each wrapping of bandage that she peeled off felt unmistakably like a layer of skin. So much so that the doctor became quite apprehensive about what kind of injury the bandages could be hiding."|Trumpet|"Jackie Kay"

Whenever they came to my school they stuck out like a sore thumb. I don’t know what it was. A different life makes people look different. Even their skin. Their clothes were more glamorous. They didn’t look like they worked a nine to five. I wanted parents that looked like they worked a nine to five. It was bad enough with all that jazz never mind this. My life was unconventional. A lot of my childhood was spent on the road. Touring. Place to fucking place. I’d have been happier at home watching Star Trek with a bowl of cornflakes. Too much, it was. All that razzamatazz. Other kids envied me and I envied other kids. That’s it. Grass always greener. Kids of bohemian parents long for a square meal on the table every night at five-thirty. My mate Sammy knew that Tuesday was fish pie day and Wednesday was steak and kidney. I’d have loved that. When I stayed in my mate Sammy’s house, I loved everything being regulated. But Sammy hated it. I kept saying we could swop. I mean I’d already swopped from the mother who had me; so why not again. But Sammy lost his bottle and couldn’t ask. I suppose I was boring as fuck. I’d have liked to have been made to have a bath every night in the same house in the same town. My mother was strict about my homework. Had to take it around with me wherever we went. I remember practising reading in dingy old jazz clubs before my father went on. I liked that. Sitting at a brown table with a Coke and a book. A lot of the time my mother would not want to go with my father on the road on account of my schooling. But he was unusual for a jazz man. He wanted his family with him. It’s pretty ironic really. If we didn’t go with him, he’d come back with a hangover and a hang-dog look on his chops. He got nervous or superstitious if we didn’t go. And pissed."|Trumpet|"Jackie Kay"

He finished that, rinsed the cup in the sink, washed his hands with surgical wash and set about his new arrival, the famous trumpeter Joss Moody – though Holding had never heard of him until today.

This one is just with me all the time, day and night, night and day, all I’m doing is thinking about this Joss Moody and what made her tick. I’ve thought up some brilliant titles for this book. But none of them have clicked yet. I don’t know which one is the best. My sister would know. She knows things straight away. Sarah’s what you call a decisive person. When we were young, she’d decide for us both – just like that. Then she’d turn and say to me that I was too fat to be decisive. I didn’t even know what decisive meant then. I had to look it up when she wasn’t looking. Bloody cheeky cow. Believe it or not, I was a heavy little girl. I was. Being plump made me feel silly and inferior so I went on a diet and I got thin.

He isn’t feeling well. He isn’t feeling well at all. Non communicado. She says to him, ‘You were Joss Moody’s drummer, weren’t you?’ Big Red said, ‘Aye, what’s it to you?

Maggie reckoned he must be famous, so she said, ‘Oh, really, how amazing!’ quickly trying to rack her brains to see if the name rang a bell. Wasn’t that the name of that new Games man on the TV?

(Most people liked to see you sweat before they offered you a cup.) Cup of tea two hours later. Mr Moody was a bit of a special man. The first time Maggie met him, she knew straightaway. She could tell things about people. Mr Moody was at the top of the stairs that day. Maggie watched him coming down. The man had style. He wore unusual shirts that had five cufflinks, specially ordered. Beautifully stitched. He never looked like he’d just got out of bed. His trousers always creased. She never saw him wear anything casual, although plenty of his music friends turned up at the door in jeans and T-shirts. A few of them looked in need of a bath."|Trumpet|"Jackie Kay"

The cushions on the couch turned and plumped. The curtains taken down and fresh ones hung up. The sheets on her double bed changed. (Not that she will be showing Sophie Stones her bedroom, but she always changes her sheets when she has a guest in the house. It’s just habit.) Her sink scoured.
