"ap 07:00"|"seven o’ clock"|"“When did he arrive?”
“At seven o’ clock.”
“And when did he leave?”"|"Mina Wentworth and the Invisible City"|"Meljean Brook"
"ap 07:30"|seven-thirty|"“He left at seven-thirty, after only a half hour in this house? That’s hardly enough time for dinner.” When the butler hesitated again, Mina pressed, “Did they argue?”"|"Mina Wentworth and the Invisible City"|"Meljean Brook"
"< 00:00"|"before midnight"|"“Foley’s in St. Olave, constable,” Mina said as she settled onto the cart’s rattling bench. “Let’s hope that the traffic has cleared or we’ll not see dinner before midnight.”"|"Mina Wentworth and the Invisible City"|"Meljean Brook"
04:00|"four in the morning"|"Set in the yard of an old school, the spark-lighter manufactory took up one wing of the building, with a tin-roofed warehouse attached to the far end. Gray smoke rose from columned chimneys. The windows had been boarded over, with slits of light peeking through. Like most factories in the London area, Foley’s laborers worked in two ten-hour shifts, from four in the morning until midnight."|"Mina Wentworth and the Invisible City"|"Meljean Brook"

"ap 08:30"|"Half-past eight"|"“Half-past eight.” The gray-haired woman’s hands and arms were skeletal prosthetics, made from steel and configured like bones. Instead of using pliers to bend the metal strips, she simply pinched and rolled. “We’d just come off dinner bell and were having a nip outside when his cart came into the yard.”"|"Mina Wentworth and the Invisible City"|"Meljean Brook"
"ap 07:30"|seven-thirty|"Given the time it would take to travel from Westminster to St. Olave in heavy traffic, that was consistent with the butler’s statement that Foley had left Redditch’s at seven-thirty—and it meant that Foley had arrived only fifteen minutes after Redditch had been killed. Even Rhys’s engine-powered two-seater balloon could barely cover the distance in that short time."|"Mina Wentworth and the Invisible City"|"Meljean Brook"
"< 00:00"|"almost midnight"|"It was almost midnight when Mina’s cab returned her home. Rhys wasn’t just waiting up—he came out onto the front steps, waved aside the footman and opened the steamcoach door for her. Not something a duke would do. Not the normal sort of duke, at least."|"Mina Wentworth and the Invisible City"|"Meljean Brook"
00:00|midnight|"“Yes. We thought midnight was a good time, just in case Geordie was working a second shift. So I saw him open a shutter in the workshop, and I catted to him.” She took in their blank stares. “Miow. We signal that way in the Crèche. Then Geordie came out and he was . . . he was all in a rage. ‘You just want my apprenticeship, you jade whore, you get out of here!’”"|"Mina Wentworth and the Invisible City"|"Meljean Brook"
