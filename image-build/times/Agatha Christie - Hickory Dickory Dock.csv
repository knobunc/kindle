                when Mrs. Hubbard came down from her sitting-room (where sherry had been served to
                the distinguished guest) followed by a small elderly man with suspiciously black
                hair and a moustache of ferocious proportions which he twirled continuously."|"Hickory Dickory Dock"|"Agatha Christie"
00:00|midnight|"“Cinderella, the unpaid drudge, sits by the fire; her sisters,
                dressed in their finery, go to the Prince’s ball. A Fairy Godmother sends
                Cinderella too, to that ball. At the stroke of midnight, her finery turns back to
                rags—she escapes hurriedly, leaving behind her one
                    slipper. So here we have a mind that compares itself to Cinderella
                (unconsciously, of course). Here we have frustration, envy, the sense of
                inferiority. The girl steals a slipper. Why?”"|"Hickory Dickory Dock"|"Agatha Christie"
18:00|"six o’clock that evening"|"By six o’clock that evening, Mrs. Hubbard was once more her efficient self again. She had put notes in all the students’ rooms asking them to come and see her before dinner, and when the various summonses were obeyed, she explained that Celia had asked her to arrange matters. They were all, she thought, very nice about it. Even Genevieve, softened by a generous estimate of the value of her compact, said cheerfully that all would be sans rancune and added with a wise air, “One knows that these crises of the nerves occur. She is rich, this Celia, she does not need to steal. No, it is a storm in her head. M. McNabb is right there.”"|"Hickory Dickory Dock"|"Agatha Christie"

One has been there for four years, the other only came a few weeks ago, was formerly at a hospital in Devon. Good record. Then there are the three senior pharmacists who have all been at St. Catherine’s for years. Those are the people who have what you might call rightful and normal access to the cupboard. Then there’s an old woman who scrubs the floors. She’s there between nine and ten in the morning and she could have grabbed a bottle out of the cupboard if the girls were busy at the outpatients’ hatches, or attending to the ward baskets, but she’s been working for the hospital for years and it seems very unlikely. The lab attendant comes through with stock bottles and he, too, could help himself to a bottle if he watched his opportunity—but none of these suggestions seem at all probable.”"|"Hickory Dickory Dock"|"Agatha Christie"

And, incidentally, if it had been a real murder—that is, if I had been stealing the poison for the purpose of murder—it would probably be remembered that I had been there. Actually, I hadn’t been in Celia’s Dispensary for about six months. No, I knew that Celia always went into the back room at eleven-fifteen for what you might call ‘elevenses,’ that is, a cup of coffee and a biscuit. The girls went in turn, two at a time. There was a new girl there who had only just come and she certainly wouldn’t know me by sight. So what I did was this. I strolled into the Dispensary with a white coat on and a stethoscope round my neck. There was only the new girl there and she was busy at the outpatients’ hatch. I strolled in, went along to the poison cupboard, took out a bottle, strolled round the end of the partition, said to the girl, ‘What strength adrenalin do you keep?’ She told me and I nodded, then I asked her if she had a couple of Veganin as I had a terrific hangover. I swallowed them down and strolled out again. She never had the least suspicion that I wasn’t somebody’s houseman or a medical student. It was child’s play. Celia never even knew I’d been there.”"|"Hickory Dickory Dock"|"Agatha Christie"

Then I didn’t like his behaviour, the way he was carrying on, so I told him that his room was engaged and that he’d have to go. I wasn’t really at all surprised when the police called.

I was rather annoyed as it seemed such a silly pointless joke. I thought of it as a joke, not as stealing, but I was rather surprised that we had no more electric bulbs because we usually keep quite a good supply in stock. Still, I didn’t take it seriously, M.
