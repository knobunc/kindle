His papers had already been examined by the Greek and Bulgarian officials in the corridor outside and Latimer did not have an opportunity of ascertaining the nationality of the citizen of the world. A Bulgarian customs official put his head in the compartment, frowned at their suitcases and then withdrew. Soon the train moved on over the frontier. Dozing fitfully, Latimer saw the thin strip of sky between the blinds turn blue-black and then grey. The train was due in Sofia at seven. When, at last, he rose to dress and collect his belongings, he saw that Mr Peters had switched off his reading lamp and had his eyes closed. As the train began to rattle over the network of points outside Sofia, he gently slid the compartment door open."|"A Coffin for Dimitrios"|"Eric Ambler"

But for their presence and the fact that in the morning light his room looked like a rag-picker’s workshop, he might have dismissed his recollections of the visitation as being no more than part of the bad dreams which had troubled his sleep.

It is curious how everyone will suddenly begin to go to one particular place in the quarter for no other reason than that everyone else is going there. There are other ways of filling one’s place, of course. The tourist guides will bring people to you but the guides have to be paid and the profit is reduced. Another way is to let your place be one where special sorts of people may meet. But it takes time to be known for one’s type of clientèle and the police are not always friendly even though one does not break the law. It is best and cheapest to have luck. And Giraud and I had luck in due course. Naturally we had to work for it. But it came. We had a good chasseur, the tango was chic because of Valentino, and our South Americans soon learned to play well so that people came to dance. When more people came we had to put out more tables so that the floor was smaller, but it did not make any difference. People still came to dance. We used to stay open until five o’clock in the morning and people would come on from other places to ours."|"A Coffin for Dimitrios"|"Eric Ambler"

Twenty minutes past two: over three hours to daybreak. A taxi returned to the rank just outside the café. Latimer hesitated for an instant, then made up his mind. Throwing away his cigarette, he left some money on the zinc and walked out to the taxi."|"A Coffin for Dimitrios"|"Eric Ambler"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"The first contact with Dimitrios was to be established by letter. Latimer had seen a draft of the letter and had found it gratifyingly similar in tone to a letter he himself had written for a blackmailer in one of his books. It began, with sinister cordiality, by trusting that, after all these years, Monsieur C.K. had not forgotten the writer and the pleasant and profitable times they had spent together, went on to say how pleasing it was to hear that he was so successful and hoped sincerely that he would be able to meet the writer who would be at the So-and-So Hotel at nine o’clock on the Thursday evening of that week. The writer concluded with an expression of his ‘plus sincere amitié’ and a significant little postscript to the effect that he had chanced to meet someone who had known their mutual friend Visser quite well, that this person was most anxious to meet Monsieur C. K. and that it would be so unfortunate if Monsieur C. K. could not arrange to keep the appointment on Thursday evening."|"A Coffin for Dimitrios"|"Eric Ambler"

There would be a hired car waiting for him there with two men in it. The two men would have been recruited for the purpose by Mr Peters. Their business would be to pick up the messenger and drive along the Quai National in the direction of Suresnes until they were quite sure that they were not being followed and then to make for a point on the Avenue de la Reine near the Porte de St Cloud where ‘Mr Petersen’ and ‘Mr Smith’ would be waiting to receive the money.

He concluded that it was Mr Peters’ corrosive burgundy fighting a rearguard action and stopped in one of the cafés on the Champs Elysées for an infusion. But the feeling persisted, and he found himself becoming more and more conscious of it. Then, as his gaze rested for a moment on a party of four men and women talking excitedly and laughing over some joke, he realized what was the matter with him. He did not want to meet Mr Peters. He did not want to go on this blackmailing expedition. He did not want to face a man in whose mind the uppermost thought would be to kill him as quickly and quietly as possible. The trouble was not in his stomach. He had cold feet."|"A Coffin for Dimitrios"|"Eric Ambler"

He had made an effort to bring the police into the affair. It had been an abortive effort, but short of collecting his passport from the other side of Paris and starting all over again (and that, he decided comfortably, was out of the question) there was nothing more he could do. He was due to meet Mr Peters at a quarter to eight in a café on the Boulevard Hausmann. But by the time he had finished a very light dinner the curious feeling had returned again to his solar plexus and the two brandies which he had with his coffee were intended to do more than pass the time. It was a pity, he reflected as he went on to keep his appointment, that he could not accept even a small share of the million francs.
