12:00|noon|"Terror numbed him. He wanted to die to escape this particular death. But he could not, and so he watched with frozen eyes and congealed mind as the ship, instead of being drowned and smashed beneath hundreds of thousands of gallons of water, rose up and up and up on the slope of the wave, up and up, the dirty brown wreckagestrewn cliff towering above, always threatening to avalanche down upon the ship, and the sky above, now turned from bright noon-blue to gray."|"The Fabulous Riverboat"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
12:00|noon|"""We'll have to get under the stone when the rains come,"" Clemens said. He lay on his back, his hands under his head, and looked up at the night sky. It was no terrestrial sky, this blaze of twenty thousand stars greater than Venus in her glory and shimmering filaments tentacling out from glittering gas clouds. Some of the stars were so bright that they could be seen as pale phantoms even at noon."|"The Fabulous Riverboat"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
"ap 03:00"|"three o'clock"|"He washed his face in a basin, combed his thick bush of reddish hair straight back, applied the toothpaste with the tip of his finger to his teeth and gums, and spat. Then he fastened a belt with four sheaths and a bag dangling from a strap and put it around his waist. He placed a long towel around his shoulders as a cape, picked up a cane of oak shod with iron and, with the other hand, picked up the grail. He went down the stairs. The grass was still wet. It rained every night at three o'clock for a half hour, and the valley did not dry until after the sun came up. If it were not for the absence of disease germs and viruses, half the valley's humans would have died of pneumonia and flu long ago."|"The Fabulous Riverboat"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
12:00|noon|"""Just thought I'd broach the subject to you,"" Sam said, ""because at noonâ€”"" John stiffened. ""Yes?"""|"The Fabulous Riverboat"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"After supper the drums relayed a message from Hacking. Firebrass would be arriving tomorrow, some time before noon."|"The Fabulous Riverboat"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
"ap 03:00"|three-o'clock|"Sam thanked him, the engineers left and Sam barred the door. Then he went into the back room to talk to Joe Miller awhile. Joe was still awake, but he said he was taking no sedation that night. He would be getting up in the morning. Sam bade the giant good night and went into his bedroom, next to the pilothouse. He drank two shots of bourbon and lay down. After a while he managed to doze, though he was afraid that the three-o'clock rain would wake him as usual and he would have trouble getting back to sleep."|"The Fabulous Riverboat"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
"ap 03:00"|three-o'clock|"The next morning he arose unrefreshed in a refreshed world. The three-o'clock rain had washed away the blood and the stink of gunpowder. The bodies were gone, and the sky was clear and blue. Business as usual was resumed but without about four hundred and fifty men and women. Half of these were in the rendering factory; the rest, in the hospital. Those who wanted to be put out of their misery were given their wish. Time had been when an ax was the only euthanasiast but now, thanks to Parolando's technology, the work was done with a potassium cyanide pill."|"The Fabulous Riverboat"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
12:00|noon|"Firebrass shook his head, ""No, I don't believe in hasty decisions. But the conference is suspended as far as the Soul City delegation is concerned. Until John Lackland apologizes, I'll give you until noon tomorrow to decide what to do."""|"The Fabulous Riverboat"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
"< 11:00"|"an hour before noon"|"About an hour before noon, Hacking's boat docked. It was a large, two-masted, fore-and-aft rigged boat, about a hundred feet long. Hacking's bodyguard, all tall wellmuscled blacks holding steel battle axes (but with Mark I pistols in big holsters) marched down the gangplank. Their kilts were pure black, and their leather helmets and cuirasses and boots were of black fishskin leather. They formed in ranks of six on each side of the gangplank, and then Hacking himself came down the gangplank."|"The Fabulous Riverboat"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
12:00|"high noon"|"There was some small talk after that while the grails of Hacking's people were set on the nearest grailstone. After the discharge of energy at high noon, the grails were removed, and the chiefs of state, accompanied by their bodyguards and guards of honor, walked to John's palace. John had insisted that the first meeting be held in his place, doubtless to impress Hacking with John's primacy. Sam did not argue this time. Hacking probably knew, from Firebrass, just how things stood between Clemens and Lackland."|"The Fabulous Riverboat"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
"~ 00:00"|"About midnight"|"About midnight, Sam accompanied Hacking and party to the big thirty-room, second-story, stone-and-bamboo building set aside for state guests. This was halfway between his quarters and John's palace. Then he drove his jeep to his home, three hundred yards away. Joe sulked a little because he had wanted to drive, even though his legs were far too long for him to try this. They staggered up the ladder and barred the door. Joe went into the rear and flopped on his bed with a crash that shook the house on its stilts. Sam looked out the ports just in time to see Cyrano and Livy, their arms around each other, lurch into the door of their hut. To their left, set above them, was von Richthofen's hut, where he and Gwenafra had already gone to bed."|"The Fabulous Riverboat"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
"ap 03:00"|"three o'clock"|"The starlight was bright. The clouds that sent the rains down every night at three o'clock had not yet come, but the mists over The River were heavy. Out of these, men were still pouring to add to the masses spreading over the plains. Behind the walls, in the mists, must be a fleet."|"The Fabulous Riverboat"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
"< 00:00"|"just before midnight"|"The only fleet that could get close without causing an alarm would be the Soul City fleet. Anybody else arriving at this hour would have had to have been within view of the spies that Sam and John Lackland had set up along The River, even in hostile territory. It couldn't be Iyeyasu's fleet; that was still sitting in the docks as of the report received just before midnight."|"The Fabulous Riverboat"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
12:00|noonday|"The man stood up and moved out into the starlight. His hair was dark but looked as if it would be a bright red in the noonday sun."|"The Fabulous Riverboat"|"Philip Jose Farmer"
