I mean the real difference there is that divides men from beasts, women and boys. A man is a mentally independent creature who thinks for himself and believes in himself, and who knows that no other creature that walks on the earth is superior to himself in anything he can’t alter.”"|"Swastika Night"|"Katharine Burdekin"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"“It doesn’t matter,” said the Knight. “It’s stopping, I think. Report to me to-morrow morning at ten o’clock at my house.”"|"Swastika Night"|"Katharine Burdekin"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"“It is. Some time to-morrow early you’ll get a message to report to the Knight at his house at ten o’clock.”"|"Swastika Night"|"Katharine Burdekin"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"“There’s a lot to be thought about,” said the Knight, “so Heil Hitler, Alfred. You can come at-well, we’ll say six o’clock to-morrow evening.”"|"Swastika Night"|"Katharine Burdekin"
"ap ~ 05:00"|"about five o’clock"|"“Then I shan’t bother to learn. I’ll do a very little more at about five o’clock, when it’ll be cooler.”"|"Swastika Night"|"Katharine Burdekin"
"ap 06:00"|"Six o’clock"|"But his idea had no holes, logically, it was merely quite fantastic and impossible. He began to walk towards the village again. “And it is quite likely right,” he thought, “for when I first began to think that I was superior to nearly all the Germans I met I thought that was fantastic and impossible too. Everything’s fantastic if it’s out of the lines you’re brought up on. At first I must try it on the Knight. Now I mustn’t go through the village again without buying the cigars. Red seal. And I ought to get back to Hermann. Six o’clock to-morrow! That’ll be another six weeks. My life is lengthening rapidly.”"|"Swastika Night"|"Katharine Burdekin"

Von Hess issued the same orders as before to Heinrich, and after the door had closed behind the servant he bade Alfred and Hermann sit down. But neither of them did so. Hermann started to speak, hesitated and stopped. Alfred helped him."|"Swastika Night"|"Katharine Burdekin"
"ap 04:00"|four|"“Another warlike half-civilisation like ours. Now, be quiet, Alfred. Stand to attention. I am going to summon Heinrich to take you to the kitchen. Come to-morrow earlier, say at four. Bring Hermann with you. I must find out what he really wants to do. And think of some more tunes. But no, we have so little time. Only I must show you—ach, here is Heinrich !”"|"Swastika Night"|"Katharine Burdekin"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"ALFRED arrived in Southampton in the early afternoon of the last day of his pilgrimage. His pass gave him till eight o’clock on the next morning, when he must report to his Nazi foreman at the aerodrome. He dawdled about in Southampton till the evening, with plenty to say to the English dock-workers about his travels in the Holy Land, then he walked out on the Salisbury road and presently hailed a passing lorry."|"Swastika Night"|"Katharine Burdekin"

His sack was considerably lighter. He went quietly into the room he shared with his boys, pulled off his boots and coat and lay down. Fred heard the little narrow bed creak."|"Swastika Night"|"Katharine Burdekin"
