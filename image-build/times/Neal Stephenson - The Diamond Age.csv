"ap 09:00"|"nine o'clock"|"The Hackworths' stateroom was to starboard, and so as they accelerated 
away from New Chusan, they got to watch the sun set on Shanghai, shining redly 
through the city's eternal cloak of coal-smoke. Gwendolyn read Fiona stories in 
bed for an hour while John perused the evening edition of the Times, 
then spread out some papers on the room's tiny desk. Later, they both changed 
into their evening clothes, primping quietly in twilight so as not to wake 
Fiona. At nine o'clock they stepped into the passageway, locked the door, and 
followed the sound of the big band to Æther's grand ballroom, 
where the dancing was just getting underway. The floor of the ballroom was a 
slab of transpicuous diamond. The lights were low. They seemed to float above 
the glittering moonlit surface of the Pacific as they did the waltz, minuet, 
Lindy, and electric slide into the night."|"The Diamond Age"|"Neal Stephenson"
"~ 00:00"|"around midnight"|"Finally, sometime around midnight, he wandered past a man in a funny gray 
jacket and cap with a red star on it, trying to give away little red books, and 
it hit him: Sendero. Most Senderistas were either Incan or Korean, but
they'd take anyone. They had a nice clave here in the Leased Territories, a 
clave with good security, and every one of them, down to the last man or woman, 
was batshit. They'd be more than a match for a few dozen Ashantis. And you 
could join anytime just by walking in the gates. They would take anyone, no 
questions asked."|"The Diamond Age"|"Neal Stephenson"
05:00|"five A.M."|"At five A.M., a shrill pentatonic reveille erupted from the 
North Koreans' brutish mediatrons. Their clave, which went by the name Sendero, 
was not far above sea level: a mile below the Hackworths' building in altitude, 
and twenty degrees warmer on the average day. But whenever the women's chorus 
chimed in with their armor-piercing refrain about the all-seeing beneficence of 
the Serene Leader, it felt as if they were right next door."|"The Diamond Age"|"Neal Stephenson"
"ap 06:00"|"six o'clock"|"Finally the bells of St. Mark's chimed six o'clock. Mrs. Hull burst into 
the kitchen on the first stroke and expressed shame that Hackworth had beaten 
her to the kitchen and shock that he had defiled it. The matter compiler in the 
corner of the kitchen came on automatically and began to create a pedomotive 
for Hackworth to take to work."|"The Diamond Age"|"Neal Stephenson"
"~ 03:00"|"about three A.M."|"A gentleman of higher rank and more far-reaching responsibilities would 
probably get different information written in a different way, and the top

signature—reminiscent of that of a helicopter blade, but noisier,” Miss 
Pao said, gazing up at Judge Fang over the half-lenses of her phenomenoscopic 
spectacles. Her eyes went out of focus, and she winced; she had been lost in 
some enhanced three-dimensional image, and the adjustment to dull reality was 
disorienting. “A cluster of such patterns was recognized by one of Shanghai 
P.D.'s sky-eyes at ten seconds after 2351 hours.”"|"The Diamond Age"|"Neal Stephenson"

long Princess Nell session and was astounded to notice that she'd been going 
for eight hours without a break. Her throat was raw, and she hadn't been to the 
loo in hours. She had made a lot of money. And the time in New York was 
something like six in the morning, which made it seem unlikely that the little 
girl lived there. She must be in a time zone not many hours different from 
Miranda's, and she must sit there playing with that ractive storybook all day 
long instead of going to school like a little rich girl should. It was slim 
evidence to go on, but Miranda never needed much evidence to confirm her belief 
that rich parents were just as capable of fucking with their children's minds 
as anyone."|"The Diamond Age"|"Neal Stephenson"

He hadn't slept well in his microberth and wouldn't have minded checking into

stopped in at the first pub he saw, and had lunch. The bartender gave him 
directions to the Royal Post Office, which was just a few blocks away."|"The Diamond Age"|"Neal Stephenson"
12:00|noon|"During this time, Duck as usual made herself busy around the camp, 
tidying up and fixing their meals, doing laundry on the rocks by the river, and 
mending their clothes that had become ragged during their wanderings. Peter 
became restless. He was quick with words, but he had not learned the trick of 
reading, and so the books from King Magpie's library were of no use to him save 
as nest-lining material. He got into the habit of exploring the surrounding 
forests, particularly the ones to the north. At first he would be gone for a 
few hours at a time, but once he stayed away all night and did not come back 
until the following noon. Then he began to go on trips for several days at a 
time."|"The Diamond Age"|"Neal Stephenson"

but Friday was her night to immerse herself in the Primer the way she had as a 
small child, six or seven years ago, when all of this had started. Right now, 
Nell was stuck in a part of the story that must have been frustrating for her, 
namely, trying to puzzle out the social rituals of a rather bizarre cult of 
faeries that had thrown her into an underground labyrinth. She'd figure it out 
eventually—she always did—but not tonight."|"The Diamond Age"|"Neal Stephenson"

Faery Kings. The many castles on the mountains belonged to all of his Dukes and 
Earls, and she suspected she would have to visit them all before she had gotten 
what she'd come for. It was not a quick adventure for an early Saturday 
morning. But just as she was clasping the book together, new words and an 
illustration appeared on the page she'd been reading, and something about the 
illustration made her open the book back up. It showed a crow perched on a tree 
branch above Princess Nell, holding a necklace in its beak. It was eleven 
jeweled keys strung on a golden chain.
Princess Nell had been wearing it around her neck; apparently the next event in 
the story was that this bird stole it while she was sleeping. Beneath the 
picture was a poem, spoken by the crow from his perch:"|"The Diamond Age"|"Neal Stephenson"
12:00|noon|"In addition to two one-hour periods each day, Miss Stricken had the 
attention of the entire assembled student body once in the morning, once at 
noon, and once in the evening. During these times her basic function was to 
call the students to order; publicly upbraid those sheep who had prominently 
strayed since the last such assembly; disgorge any random meditations that had 
been occupying her mind of late; and finally, in reverential tones, introduce 
Father Cox, the local vicar, who would lead the students in prayer. Miss 
Stricken also had the students all to herself for two hours on Sunday morning 
and could optionally command their attention for up to eight hours on Saturdays 
if she came round to the opinion that they wanted supplementary guidance."|"The Diamond Age"|"Neal Stephenson"

seven o'clock, enter the room, and sit down in the front row in adjacent desks. 
This was part of Miss Stricken's fiendish plan. A less subtle tormentor would 
have placed the girls as far apart as possible to prevent them from talking to 
each other, but Miss Stricken wanted them right next to each other so that they 
would be more tempted to visit and pass notes."|"The Diamond Age"|"Neal Stephenson"

they were astonished to find Miss Matheson waiting for them at the front of the

thermogenic comforter. The stacks of books, paper, and fountain pens were not 
there, and their names had been removed from the plaque at the front of the

been several weeks since she had seen him. During the last two years he had 
been called away on business with increasing frequency, vanishing (as she 
supposed) into the interior of China for days, then weeks at a time, coming 
back depressed
and exhausted to find solace in whiskey, which he consumed in surprisingly

New Atlantis Clave."|"The Diamond Age"|"Neal Stephenson"

the eyes of the old-timers, begun to soften and ruin the place. There was 
nothing like getting up at three in the morning and riding the defensive 
perimeter in subzero cold, with a loaded rifle, to build up one's sense of 
responsibility and community. Carl Hollywood's clearest and best memories were 
of going on such rides with his father. But as they squatted on packed snow 
boiling coffee over a fire, they would listen to the radio and hear stories 
about the jihad raging across Xinjiang, driving the Han back into the east, and 
about the first incidents of nanotech terrorism in Eastern Europe. Carl's 
father didn't have to tell him that their community was rapidly acquiring the 
character of a historical theme park, and that before long they would have to 
give up the mounted patrols for more modern defensive systems."|"The Diamond Age"|"Neal Stephenson"
