Unfortunately, it was definitely easier for Celluci at six four."|"Blood Lines"|"Tanya Huff"

He'd come in early to do catch up on a little of the work the sarcophagus had disrupted and found Dr. Rax sprawled on the floor of the workroom. ""I didn't touch him or anything else except the phone. I called 911, said I'd found a body, and went into the hall to wait.

She checked her watch. ""I'm a little early."""|"Blood Lines"|"Tanya Huff"
"ap 09:45"|"nine forty-five"|"The body had been removed from the University Subway line at Osgoode Station, Queen Street, and had been pronounced dead on arrival at Sick Children's Hospital. Cause of death, heart failure. Osgoode was three stops south of Museum. The date was October 20th. The time, nine forty-five.

On Thursday, October 22nd, a three-year-old had plunged off the top of a play structure at the Sunnyview Co-op Daycare and, according to the autopsy, had been dead before hitting the ground. Only one long block along Bloor Street separated the Sunnyview Co-op Daycare from the museum."|"Blood Lines"|"Tanya Huff"
"ap 03:12"|"Three twelve"|"This wasn't going to work. The odds of him running into the mummy, even in Vicki's limited search area, because it just happened to be casting a spell as he wandered by were astronomical.

"ap 04:00"|"four o'clock"|"'Vicki? Celluci. It's four o'clock, Wednesday afternoon. One of the uniforms just told me they saw you poking around the drains behind the museum this morning.

"ap 11:43"|"eleven forty-three"|"It was eleven forty-three-this culture's preoccupation with the division of time into ridiculously small units never failed to amuse him-and she would be asleep by now, her ka at its most vulnerable.

"ap ~ 02:10"|"about two-ten"|"'Mike, it's Vicki. It's about two-ten, Sunday afternoon. Call me when you've got time to talk."" She hung up the phone and reached for her jacket. Now that they  knew high-ranking police officers were involved and, given those same officers had already pulled him off the case, a tap on Celluci's phone line was a possibility; a slim one, granted, but Vicki saw no reason to discount it just because the odds were ridiculously high. After all, they were hunting down an ancient Egyptian mummy and who'd want to figure the odds on that."|"Blood Lines"|"Tanya Huff"

"~ 00:00"|"about midnight"|"The flatness of his tone penetrated.  You can deal with this only if you deny the effect it had. Over the years Vicki had seen enough of the effects of major trauma to recognize this particular defense mechanism in her sleep. With an effort, she damped her own emotions to suit. ""So you found it. Tony called me about midnight, he was afraid the creature had sucked up your life the way it had the baby's. Mike drove me over. I'll have to call him after sunrise and let him know what happened.""  Provided you let me know what happened."|"Blood Lines"|"Tanya Huff"

"ap 10:25"|"Ten twenty-five"|"'  You're my problem, Nelson,"" Celluci growled as he dropped the receiver back into the cradle. He glared at the clock on the kitchen wall. Ten twenty-five. Even at this hour of the morning, theoretically well past rush hour, driving from Downsview to the center of town was going to take just about all of that thirty-five minutes. He couldn't afford to wait any longer; Cantree had an understandable objection to his detectives wandering in to work when it suited them."|"Blood Lines"|"Tanya Huff"
"ap ~ 09:00"|"about nine o'clock"|"The noise was overwhelming; the clatter of a busy cafeteria with the volume control gone and so many women's voices that all individual sound was lost. The smell of food overpowered the smell of prison. Vicki suddenly realized that she hadn't eaten since about nine o'clock the evening before. Her mouth flooded with saliva and her stomach growled audibly."|"Blood Lines"|"Tanya Huff"
"ap 05:10"|"five ten"|"At five ten, Vicki didn't look up at many women, but Natalie Wills was huge. Even slouched she had to top six feet; if she ever straightened up, she'd probably hit six six or six seven. Her frizzy halo of blonde hair emphasized the rounded curves of her face and her pale blue eyes bulged slightly out of the sockets. At some point in the past, her nose had been broken, at least once, and improperly set. Through the space between slack lips, Vicki could hear heavy adenoidal breathing. Her breasts and belly stretched the limits of the jail uniform. It looked and moved like fat but Vicki wasn't willing to give any odds that it actually was."|"Blood Lines"|"Tanya Huff"

It was now six twelve, eight minutes after sunset.

""Well, it could happen any time, I suppose, but a dark rite would most likely be held during the dark of the moon, when the eye of Thoth is out of the sky. And probably at midnight, when Ra, the sun god, has been out of the world for the longest time, and will still be gone for an equal amount of time."""|"Blood Lines"|"Tanya Huff"

Although their upper bodies swayed back and forth barely a hand's span apart, both sets of feet were firmly planted with nearly a meter between them.  Well, I'm no Barry Wu, but I think that I can at least guarantee not to hit the wrong legs. He took his stance, braced his service revolver with his left hand, and tried to steady his breathing. He'd probably have a better chance if he waited until his lungs stopped heaving air in and out like asthmatic bellows, but it was coming up on midnight, and if Rachel Shane was right, the world didn't have much time.  Once in the knee to get his attention and then a second round to finish him."|"Blood Lines"|"Tanya Huff"
