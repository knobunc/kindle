"ap 07:30"|"half past seven"|"He found Koppel at half past seven. As it was a Friday evening, be was in a bar with a crowd of friends, and Miller could hear the jukebox in the background. It was playing the Beatles' ""I Want to Hold Your Hand,"" which had almost driven him mad that winter, so frequently had it been played."|"The Odessa File"|"Frederick Forsyth"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"""I'll give it to you when you get here. There's a train at nine out of Hamburg. You've got an hour. So get moving."" Koppel sighed deeply. ""All right, I'll be on the train."" Miller hung up, asked the hotel switchboard operator to call him at eleven, and dozed off."|"The Odessa File"|"Frederick Forsyth"
00:00|midnight|"Outside, Mackensen continued his lonely vigil. He decided to start on the Jaguar at midnight if Miller had not emerged."|"The Odessa File"|"Frederick Forsyth"
"ap 11:15"|"quarter past eleven"|"But Miller walked out of the hotel at quarter past eleven, crossed the square, and entered the station. Mackensen was surprised.

They walked the mile to Winzer's house, cast a quick look up and down the road, and darted through the gate. To avoid the gravel, both men walked up the grass edge along the driveway, then crossed the lawn to hide in the rhododendron bushes facing the windows of what looked like the study."|"The Odessa File"|"Frederick Forsyth"
01:00|"one in the morning"|"Koppel, moving like a furtive little animal through the undergrowth, made a tour of the house, leaving Miller to watch the bag of tools. When he came back he whispered, ""The maid's still got her light on. Window at the back under the eaves."" Not daring to smoke, they sat for an hour, shivering beneath the fat evergreen leaves of the bushes. At one in the morning Koppel made another tour and reported the girl's bedroom light was out."|"The Odessa File"|"Frederick Forsyth"
"ap 03:30"|"half past three"|"He sat Miller in the chair, warning him to keep his string-backed driving gloves on at all times. Taking his bag, Koppel went over to the fireplace, slipped a headband around his head, and fixed the flashlight into a bracket so that it pointed forward. Inch by inch, he went over the brickwork, feeling with sensitive fingers for bumps or lugs, indentations or hollow areas. Abandoning this when he had covered it all, he started again with a palette knife probing for cracks. He found it at half past three."|"The Odessa File"|"Frederick Forsyth"
"ap 05:00"|"five o'clock"|"""Walk slowly,"" said Koppel in his normal talking voice. ""Just walk and talk like we were coming home from a party.""

"ap < 10:00"|"Just before ten o'clock"|"Just before ten o'clock he called the telephone Information department of the city named on the sheet of paper.

"ap > 00:00"|"past twelve o'clock"|"It was past twelve o'clock when he packed his bags, descended to the hall, and settled his bill. He was famished, so he went into the hotel dining room, taking only his document case, and treated himself to a large steak."|"The Odessa File"|"Frederick Forsyth"

"ap 06:50"|"ten minutes before seven"|"Outside in the snow there was a dim light breaking over the eastern horizon. Had Miller glanced at his watch, it would have told him the time was ten minutes before seven on the morning of Sunday, February 23. But he was already asleep."|"The Odessa File"|"Frederick Forsyth"
12:00|noon|".."" The instructions were precise and to the point, He wrote down the telephone number in Munich she was to call, and the message she was to give the man at the other end. He ended: ""Do not under any circumstances follow me up the mountain. You could only make matters worse, whatever the situation. So if I am not back by noon, or have not called you in this room by then, call that number, give that message, check out of the hotel, mail the envelope at any box in Frankfurt, then drive back to Hamburg. Don't get engaged to anyone else in the meantime. All my love, Peter."" He propped the note on the bedside table by the telephone, along with the large envelope containing the Odessa file, and three 50-mark bills."|"The Odessa File"|"Frederick Forsyth"

You were the victim of a hitchhiker who later crashed and killed himself."" Josef stood up and prepared to leave. He looked down at Miller. ""You're a lucky bastard, though you don't seem to realize it. I got the message your girl friend passed me, presumably on your instructions, at noon yesterday, and by riding like a maniac I made it from Munich to the house on the hill in two and a half hours dead. Which was what you almost were--dead. They bad a guy who was going to kill you. I managed to interrupt him in time."" He turned, hand on the doorknob. ""Take a word of advice.
