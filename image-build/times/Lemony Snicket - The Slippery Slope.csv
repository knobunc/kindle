00:00|midnight|"A Series of Unfortunate Events 10 - The Slippery Slope     “Can't we sleep ten minutes more?” asked the whiny voice of the hook-handed man. “I was having a lovely dream about sneezing without covering my nose and mouth, and giving everybody germs.”     “Absolutely not!” Olaf replied. “I have lots of work for you to do.”     “But Olaf,” said Esmé Squalor, emerging from the tent she had shared with Count Olaf. Her hair was in curlers and she was wearing a long robe and a pair of fuzzy slippers. “I need a little while to choose what I'm going to wear. It's not in to burn down a headquarters without wearing a fashionable outfit.”     Sunny gasped in the trunk. She had known that Olaf was eager to reach the V.F.D. headquarters as soon as possible, in order to get his hands on the rest of some crucial evidence, but it had not occurred to her that he would combine this evidence-grabbing with his usual pyromania, a word which here means “a love of fire, usually the product of a deranged mind.”     “I can't imagine why you need all this time,” was Count Olaf's grumpy reply to his girlfriend. “After all, I wear the same outfit for weeks at a time, except when I'm in disguise, and I look almost unbearably handsome. Well, I suppose you have a few minutes before breakfast is ready. Slow service is one of the disadvantages of having infants for slaves.” Olaf strode over to the car and peered in at Sunny, who was still clutching the loaf of bread.     “Hurry up, bigmouth,” he growled at Sunny. “I need a nice hot meal to take the chill out of the morning.”     “Unfeasi!” Sunny cried. By “Unfeasi” she meant “To make a hot meal without any electricity, I'd need a fire, and expecting a baby to start a fire all by herself on top of a snowy mountain is cruelly impossible and impossibly cruel,” but Olaf merely frowned. “Your baby talk is really beginning to annoy me,” he said.     “Hygiene,” Sunny said, to make herself feel better. She meant something along the lines of, “Additionally, you ought to be ashamed of yourself for wearing the same outfit for weeks at a time without washing,” but Olaf merely scowled at her and walked back into his tent.     Sunny looked at the cold ingredients and tried to think. Even if she had been old enough to start a fire by herself, Sunny had been nervous around flames since the fire that had destroyed the Baudelaire mansion. But as she thought of the fire that destroyed her own home, she remembered something her mother had told her once. They had both been busy in the kitchen — Sunny's mother was busy preparing for a fancy luncheon, and Sunny was busy dropping a fork on the floor over and over again to see what sort of sound it made. The luncheon was due to start any minute, and Sunny's mother was quickly mixing up a salad of sliced mango, black beans, and chopped celery mixed with black pepper, lime juice, and olive oil.     “This isn't a very complicated recipe, Sunny,” her mother had said, “but if I arrange the salad very nicely on fancy plates, people will think I've been cooking all day. Often, when cooking, the presentation of the food can be as important as the food itself.”     Thinking of what her mother had said, she opened the picnic basket in Olaf's trunk and found that it contained a set of elegant plates, each emblazoned with the familiar eye insignia, and a small tea set. Then she rolled up her sleeves — an expression which here means “focused very hard on the task at hand, but did not actually roll up her sleeves, because it was very cold on the highest peak of the Mortmain Mountains ” — and got to work as Count Olaf and his comrades started their day.     “I'll use these blankets for a tablecloth,” Sunny heard Olaf say in the tent, over the sound her own teeth were making.     “Good idea,” she heard Esmé reply. “It's very in to dine al fresco.”     “What does that mean?” Olaf asked.     “It means 'outside,' of course,” Esmé explained. “It's fashionable to eat your meals in the fresh air.”     “I knew what it meant,” Count Olaf replied. “I was just testing you.”     “Hey boss,” Hugo called from the next tent. “Colette won't share the dental floss.”     “There's no reason to use dental floss,” Count Olaf said, “unless you're trying to strangle someone with a very weak neck.”     “Kevin, would you do me a favor?” the hook-handed man asked, as Sunny struggled to open the jug of juice. “Will you help me comb my hair? These hooks can make it difficult sometimes.”     “I'm jealous of your hooks,” Kevin replied. “Having no hands is better than having two equally strong hands.”     “Don't be ridiculous,” one of the white-faced women replied. “Having a white face is worse than both of your situations.”     “But you have a white face because you put makeup on,” Colette said, as Sunny climbed back out of the trunk and knelt down in the snow. “You're putting powder on your face right now.”     “Must you bicker every single morning?” Count Olaf asked, and stomped back out of his tent carrying a blanket covered in images of eyes. “Somebody take this blanket and set the table over there on that flat rock.”     Hugo walked out of the tent and smiled at his new boss. “I'd be happy to,” he said.     Esmé stepped outside, having changed into a bright red snowsuit, and put her arm around Olaf. “Fold the blanket into a large triangle,” she said to Hugo. “That's the in way to do it.”     “Yes ma'am,” Hugo said, “and, if you don't mind my saying so, that's a very handsome snowsuit you are wearing.”     The villainous girlfriend turned all the way around to show off her outfit from every angle. Sunny looked up from her cooking and noticed that the letter B was sewn onto the back of it, along with the eye insignia. “I'm glad you like it, Hugo,” Esmé said. “It's stolen.”     Count Olaf glanced at Sunny and quickly stepped in front of his girlfriend. “What are you staring at, toothy?” he asked. “Are you done making breakfast?”     “Almost,” Sunny replied.     “That infant never makes any sense,” Hugo said. “No wonder she fooled us into thinkine she was a carnival freak.”     Sunny sighed, but no one heard her over the scornful laughter of Olaf's troupe. One by one, the villain's wretched employees emerged from the tent and strolled over to the flat rock where Hugo was laying out the blanket. One of the white-faced women glanced at Sunny and gave her a small smile, but nobody offered to help her finish with the breakfast preparations, or even to set the table with the eye-patterned dishes. Instead, they gathered around the rock talking and laughing until Sunny carefully carried the breakfast over to them, arranged on a large eye-shaped tray that she'd found in the bottom of the picnic basket. Although she was still frightened to be in Olaf's clutches and worried about her siblings, Sunny could not help but be a little proud as Count Olaf and his comrades looked at the meal she had prepared.     Sunny had kept in mind what her mother had said about presentation being as important as the food itself, and managed to put together a lovely breakfast despite the difficult circumstances. First, she had opened the jug of frozen orange juice and used a small spoon to chip away at the ice until she had a large heap of juice shavings, which she arranged into tiny piles on each plate to make orange granita, a cold and delicious concoction that is often served at fancy dinner parties and masked balls. Then, Sunny had rinsed her mouth out with melted snow so it would be as clean as possible, and chopped some of the coffee beans with her teeth. She placed a bit of the ground coffee inside each cup and combined it with more snow she had melted in her own hands to make iced coffee, a delicious beverage I first enjoyed when visiting Thailand to interview a taxi driver. Meanwhile, the youngest Baudelaire had put the chilled bread underneath her shirt to warm it up, and when it was warm enough to eat she put one slice on each plate, and using a small spoon, spread some boysenberry jam on each piece of bread. She did her best to spread the jam in the shape of an eye, to please the villains who would be eating it, and as a finishing touch she found a bouquet of ivy, which Count Olaf had given his girlfriend not so long ago, and placed it in the small pitcher of the tea set used for cream. There was no cream, but the ivy would help the presentation of the food by serving as a centerpiece, a word which here means “a decoration placed in the middle of a table, often used to distract people from the food.” Of course, orange granita and iced coffee are not often served at al fresco breakfasts on cold mountain peaks, and bread with jam is more traditionally prepared as toast, but without a source of heat or any other cooking equipment, Sunny had done the best she could, and she hoped that Olaf and his troupe might appreciate her efforts.     “Caffefredde, sorbet, toast tartar,” she announced.     “What is this?” Count Olaf said suspiciously, peering into his coffee cup. “It looks like coffee, but it's freezing cold!”     “And what is this orange stuff?” Esmé asked suspiciously. “I want fashionable, in food, not a handful of ice!”     Colette picked up a piece of the bread and stared at it suspiciously. “This toast feels raw,” she said. “Is it safe to eat raw toast?”     “Of course not,” Hugo said. “I bet that baby is trying to poison us.”     “Actually, the coffee isn't bad,” one of the white-faced women said, “even if it is a little bitter. Could someone pass the sugar, please?”     'Sugar?“ shrieked Count Olaf, erupting in anger. He stood up, grabbed one end of the blanket, and pulled as hard as he could, scattering all of Sunny's hard work. Food, beverages, and dishes fell everywhere, and Sunny had to duck to avoid getting hit on the head with a flying fork. ”All the sugar in the world couldn't save this terrible breakfast!“ he roared, and then leaned down so that his shiny, shiny eyes stared right into Sunny's. ”I told you to make a nice, hot breakfast, and you gave me cold, disgusting nonsense!“ he said, his smelly breath making a cloud in the chilly air. ”Don't you see how high up we are, you sabertoothed papoose? If I threw you off Mount Fraught , you'd never survive!""     “Olaf!” Esmé said. “I'm surprised at you! Surely you remember that we'll never get the Baudelaire fortune if we toss Sunny off the mountain. We have to keep Sunny alive for the greater good.”     “Yes, yes,” Count Olaf said. “I remember. I'm not going to throw the orphan off the mountain. I just wanted to terrify her.” He gave Sunny a cruel smirk, and then turned to the hook-handed man. “Walk over to that frozen waterfall,” he said, “and crack a hole in the ice with your hook. The stream is full of Stricken Salmon. Catch enough for all of us, and we'll have the baby prepare us a proper meal.”     “Good idea, Olaf,” the hook-handed man said, standing up and walking toward the icy slope. “You're as smart as you are intelligent.”     “Sakesushi,” Sunny said quietly, which meant “I don't think you'll enjoy salmon if it's not cooked.”     “Stop your baby talk and wash these dishes,” Olaf ordered. “They're covered in lousy food.”     “You know, Olaf,” said the white-faced woman who had asked for sugar, “it's none of my business, but we might put someone else in charge of cooking. It was probably difficult for a baby to prepare a hot breakfast without a fire.”     “But there is a fire,” said a deep, low voice, and everyone turned around to see who had arrived.     Having an aura of menace is like having a pet weasel, because you rarely meet someone who has one, and when you do it makes you want to hide under the coffee table. An aura of menace is simply a distinct feeling of evil that accompanies the arrival of certain people, and very few individuals are evil enough to produce an aura of menace that is very strong. Count Olaf, for example, had an aura of menace that the three Baudelaires had felt the moment they met him, but a number of other people never seemed to sense that a villain was in their midst, even when Olaf was standing right next to them with an evil gleam in his eye. But when two visitors arrived at the highest peak of the Mortmain Mountains , their aura of menace was unmistakable. Sunny gasped when she saw them. Esmé Squalor shuddered in her snowsuit. The members of Olaf's troupe — all except the hook-handed man, who was busy fishing for salmon and so was lucky enough to miss the visitors' arrival — gazed down at the snowy ground rather than take a further look at them. Count Olaf himself looked a bit nervous as the man, the woman, and their aura of menace drew closer and closer. And even I, after all this time, can feel their aura of menace so strongly, just by writing about these two people, that I dare not say their names, and will instead refer to them the way everyone who dares refer to them refers to them, as “the man with a beard, but no hair” and “the woman with hair, but no beard.”     “It's good to see you, Olaf,” continued the deep voice, and Sunny realized that the voice belonged to the sinister-looking woman. She was dressed in a suit made of a strange blue fabric that was very shiny, decorated with two large pads, one on each shoulder. She was dragging a wooden toboggan — a word which here means “a sled big enough to hold several people,” which made an eerie scraping sound against the cold ground. “I was worried that the authorities might have captured you.”     “You look well,” said the man with a beard but no hair. He was dressed identically to the woman with hair but no beard, but his voice was very hoarse, as if he had been screaming for hours and could hardly talk. “It's been a long time since we've laid eyes on one another.” The man gave Olaf a grin that made it seem even colder on the mountain peak, and then stopped and helped the woman lean the toboggan against the rock where Sunny had served breakfast. The youngest Baudelaire saw that the toboggan was painted with the familiar eye insignia, and had a few long leather straps, presumably used for steering.     Count Olaf coughed lightly into his hand, which is something people often do when they cannot think of what to say. “Hello,” he said, a bit nervously. “Did I hear you say something about a fire?”     The man with a beard but no hair and the woman with hair but no beard looked at one another and shared a laugh that made Sunny cover her ears with her hands. “Haven't you noticed,” the woman said, “that there are no snow gnats around?”     “We had noticed that,” Esmé said. “I thought maybe snow gnats were no longer in.”     “Don't be ridiculous, Esmé,” said the man with a beard but no hair. He reached out and kissed Esmé's hand, which Sunny could see was trembling. “The gnats aren't around because they can smell the smoke.”     “I don't smell anything,” said Hugo.     “Well, if you were a tiny insect, you'd smell something,” replied the woman with hair but no beard. “If you were a snow gnat, you'd smell the smoke from the V.F.D. headquarters.”     “We did you a favor, Olaf,” the man said. “We burned the entire place down.”     “No!” Sunny cried, before she could stop herself. By “No!” she meant “I certainly hope that isn't true, because my siblings and I hoped to reach V.F.D. headquarters, solve the mysteries that surround us, and perhaps find one of our parents,” but she had not planned to say it out loud. The two visitors looked down at the youngest Baudelaire, casting their aura of menace in her direction.     “What is that?” asked the man with a beard but no hair.     “That's the youngest Baudelaire,” replied Esmé. “We've eliminated the other two, but we're keeping this one around to do our bidding until we can finally steal the fortune.”     The woman with hair but no beard nodded. “Infant servants are so troublesome,” she said. “I had an infant servant once — a long time ago, before the schism.”     “Before the schism?” Olaf said, and Sunny wished Klaus were with her, because the baby did not know what the word “schism” meant. “That is a long time ago. That infant must be all grown up by now.”     “Not necessarily,” the woman said, and laughed again, while her companion leaned down to gaze at Sunny. Sunny could not bear to look into the eyes of the man with a beard but no hair, and instead looked down at his shiny shoes.     “So this is Sunny Baudelaire,” he said in his strange, hoarse voice. “Well, well, well. I've heard so much about this little orphan. She's caused almost as many problems as her parents did.” He stood up again and looked around at Olaf and his troupe. “But we know how to solve problems, don't we? Fire can solve any problem in the world.”     He began to laugh, and the woman with hair but no beard laughed along with him. Nervously, Count Olaf began to laugh, too, and then glared at his troupe until they laughed along with him, and Sunny found herself surrounded by tall, laughing villains. “Oh, it was wonderful,” said the woman with hair but no beard. “First we burned down the kitchen. Then we burned down the dining room. Then we burned down the parlor, and then the disguise center, the movie room, and the stables. Then we moved on to the gymnasium and the training center, and the garage and all six of the laboratories. We burned down the dormitories and schoolrooms, the lounge, the theater, and the music room, as well as the museum and the ice cream shop. Then we burned down the rehearsal studios and the testing centers and the swimming pool, which was very hard to burn down. Then we burned down all the bathrooms, and then finally, we burned down the V.F.D. library last night. That was my favorite part — books and books and books, all turned to ashes so no one could read them. You should have been there, Olaf! Every morning we lit fires and every evening we celebrated with a bottle of wine and some finger puppets. We've been wearing these fireproof suits for almost a month. It's been a marvelous time.”     “Why did you burn it down gradually?” Count Olaf asked. “Whenever I burn something down, I do it all at once.”     “We couldn't have burned down the entire headquarters at once,” said the man with a beard but no hair. “Someone would have spotted us. Remember, where there's smoke there's fire.”     “But if you burned the headquarters down room by room,” Esmé said, “didn't all of the volunteers escape?”     “They were gone already,” said the man, and scratched his head where his hair might have been. “The entire headquarters were deserted. It was as if they knew we were coming. Oh well, you can't win them all.”     “Maybe we'll find some of them when we burn down the carnival,” said the woman, in her deep, deep voice.     “Carnival?” Olaf asked nervously.     “Yes,” the woman said, and scratched the place where her beard would have been, if she had one. “There's an important piece of evidence that V.F.D. has hidden in a figurine sold at Caligari Carnival, so we need to go burn it down.”     “I burned it down already,” Count Olaf said.     “The whole place?” the woman said in surprise.     “The whole place,” Olaf said, giving her a nervous smile.     “Congratulations,” she said, in a deep purr. “You're better than I thought, Olaf.”     Count Olaf looked relieved, as if he had not been sure whether the woman was going to compliment him or kick him. “Well, it's all for the greater good,” he said.     “As a reward,” the woman said, “I have a gift for you, Olaf.” Sunny watched as the woman reached into the pocket of her shiny suit and drew out a stack of paper, tied together with thick rope. The paper looked very old and worn, as if it had been passed around to a variety of different people, hidden in a number of secret compartments, and perhaps even divided into different piles, driven around a city in horse-drawn carriages, and then put back together at midnight in the back room of a bookstore disguised as a cafe disguised as a sporting goods store. Count Olaf's eyes grew very wide and very shiny, and he reached his filthy hands toward it if it were the Baudelaire fortune itself.     “The Snicket file!” he said, in a hushed whisper.     “It's all here,” the woman said. “Every chart, every map and every photograph from the only file that could put us all in jail.”     “It's complete except for page thirteen, of course,” the man said. “We understand that the Baudelaires managed to steal that page from Heimlich Hospital .”     The two visitors glared down at Sunny Baudelaire, who couldn't help whimpering in fear. “Surchmi,” she said. She meant something along the lines of, “I don't have it — my siblings do,” but she did not need a translator.     “The older orphans have it,” Olaf said, “but I'm fairly certain they're dead.”     “Then all of our problems have gone up in smoke,” said the woman with hair but no beard.     Count Olaf grabbed the file and held it to his chest as if it were a newborn baby, although he was not the sort of person to treat a newborn baby very kindly. “This is the most wonderful gift in the world,” he said. “I'm going to go read it right now.”     “We'll all read it together,” said the woman with hair but no beard. “It contains secrets we all ought to know.”     “But first,” said the man with a beard but no hair, “I have a gift for your girlfriend, Olaf.”     “For me?” Esmé asked.     “I found these in one of the rooms of headquarters,” the man said. “I've never seen one before, but it has been quite some time since I was a volunteer.” With a sly smile, he reached into his pocket and took out a small green tube.     “What's that?” Esmé asked.     “I think it's a cigarette,” the man said.     “A cigarette!” Esmé said, with a smile as big as Olaf's. “How in!”     “I thought you'd enjoy them,” the man said. “Here, try it. I happen to have quite a few matches right here.”     The man with a beard but no hair struck a match, lit the end of the green tube, and offered it to the wicked girlfriend, who grabbed it and held it to her mouth. A bitter smell, like that of burning vegetables, filled the air, and Esmé Squalor began to cough.     “What's the matter?” asked the woman in her deep voice. “I thought you liked things that are in.”     “I do,” Esmé said, and then coughed quite a bit more. Sunny was reminded of Mr. Poe, who was always coughing into a handkerchief, as Esmé coughed and coughed and finally dropped the green tube to the ground where it spewed out a dark green smoke. “I love cigarettes,” she explained to the man with a beard but no hair, “but I prefer to smoke them with a long holder because I don't like the smell or taste and because they're very bad for you.”     “Never mind that now,” Count Olaf said impatiently. “Let's go into my tent and read the file.” He started to walk toward the tent but stopped and glared at his comrades, who were beginning to follow him. “The rest of you stay out here,” he said. “There are secrets in this file that I do not want you to know.”     The two sinister visitors began to laugh, and followed Count Olaf and Esmé into the tent closing the flap behind them. Sunny stood with Hugo, Colette, Kevin, and the two white-faced women and stared after them in silence, waiting for the aura of menace to disappear.     “Who were those people?” asked the hook-handed man, and everyone turned to see that he had returned from his fishing expedition. Four salmon hung from each of his hooks, dripping with the waters of the Stricken Stream.     “I don't know,” said one of the white-faced women, “but they made me very nervous.”     “If they're friends of Count Olaf's,” Kevin said, “how bad could they be?”     The members of the troupe looked at one another, but no one answered the ambidextrous person's question. “What did that man mean when he said 'Where there's smoke there's fire'?” Hugo asked.     “I don't know,” Colette said. A chilly wind blew, and Sunny watched her contort her body in the breeze until it looked almost as curvy as the smoke from the green tube Esmé had dropped.     “Forget those questions,” the hook-handed man said. “My question is, how are you going to prepare this salmon, orphan?”     Olaf's henchman was looking down at Sunny, but the youngest Baudelaire did not answer for a moment. Sunny was thinking, and her siblings would have been proud of her for the way she was thinking. Klaus would have been proud, because she was thinking about the phrase “Where there's smoke there's fire,” and what it might mean. And Violet would have been proud, because she was thinking about the salmon that the hook-handed man was holding, and what she might invent that would help her. Sunny stared at the hook-handed man and thought as hard as she could, and she felt almost as if both siblings were with her, Klaus helping her think about a phrase and Violet helping her think about an invention.     “Answer me, baby,” the hook-handed man growled. “What are you going to make for us out of this salmon?”     “Lox!” Sunny said, but it was as if all three of the Baudelaires had answered the question.and whether or not there are enough people with the integrity and decency necessary to keep the entire planet from descending into despair. I have not read this novel in several years, because I participate in enough discussions on how the world has become a corrupt and dangerous place and whether or not there are enough people with the integrity and decency necessary to keep the entire planet from descending into despair without reading about it in my leisure time, but nevertheless the phrase “corridors of power” has come to mean the hushed and often secret places where important matters are discussed. Whether or not they are actual corridors, the corridors of power tend to feel quiet and mysterious. If you have ever walked inside an important building, such as the main branch of a library or the office of a dentist who has agreed to disguise your teeth, then you may have experienced this feeling that accompanies the corridors of power, and Violet and Klaus Baudelaire experienced it as they reached the end of the Vertical Flame Diversion, and followed the mysterious sweatered scout as he climbed out of the secret passageway. Even through their masks, the two siblings could sense that they were in an important place, even though it was nothing more than a dim, curved hallway with a small grate on the ceiling where the morning light was shining through.     “That's where the smoke escapes from the Snow Scouts' fire,” whispered the mysterious scout, pointing up at the ceiling. “That leads to the very center of the Valley of Four Drafts, so the smoke is scattered to the four winds. V.F.D. doesn't want anyone to see the smoke.”     “Where there's smoke,” Violet said, “there's fire.”     “Exactly,” the scout said. “Anyone who saw smoke coming from this high up in the mountains might become suspicious and investigate. In fact, I found a device that works exactly according to this principle.” He reached into his backpack and drew out a small rectangular box filled with small green tubes, exactly like the one that Sunny had seen the man with a beard but no hair give to Esmé Squalor.     “No thank you,” Violet said. “I don't smoke.”     “I don't, either,” the scout said, “but these aren't cigarettes. These are Verdant Flammable Devices. Verdant means 'green,' so when you light one, it gives out a dark green smoke, so another volunteer will know where you are.”     Klaus took the box from the scout and squinted at it in the dim light. “I've seen a box like this before,” he said, “in my father's desk, when I was looking for a letter opener. I remember thinking it was strange to find them, because he didn't smoke.”     “He must have been hiding them,” Violet said. “Why was he keeping them a secret?”     “The entire organization is a secret,” the scout said. “It was very difficult for me to learn the secret location of the headquarters.”     “It was difficult for us, too,” Klaus said. “We found it in a coded map.”     “I had to draw my own map,” the scout said, and reached into a pocket in his sweater. He turned on the flashlight, and the two Baudelaires could see he was holding a notebook with a dark purple cover.     “What's that?” Violet asked.     “It's a commonplace book,” the scout said. “Whenever I find something that seems important or interesting, I write it down. That way, all my important information is in one place.”     “I should start one,” Klaus said. “My pockets are bulging with scraps of paper.”     “From information I read in Dr. Montgomery's book, and a few others,” the scout said, “I managed to draw a map of where to go from here.” He opened the purple notebook and flipped a few pages until he reached a small but elegant rendering of the cave, the Vertical Flame Diversion, and the hallway in which they were standing now. “As you can see,” he said, running his finger along the hallway, “the passageway branches off in two directions.”     “This is a very well-drawn map,” Violet said.     “Thank you,” the scout replied. “I've been interested in cartography for quite some time. See, if we go to the left, there's a small area used for sled and snowsuit storage, at least according to a newspaper article I found. But if we go right, we'll arrive at the Vernacularly Fastened Door, which should open onto the headquarters' kitchen. We might walk in on the entire organization having breakfast.”     The two Baudelaires looked at one another through their masks, and Violet put a hand on her brother's shoulder. They did not dare to say out loud their hope that one of their parents might be just around the corner.     “Let's go,” Violet whispered.     The scout nodded silently in agreement, and led the Baudelaires down the hallway, which seemed to get colder and colder with every step. By now they were so far from Bruce and the Snow Scouts that there was no need to whisper, but all three children kept quiet as they walked down the dim, curved hallway, hushed by the feeling of the corridors of power. At last they reached a large metal door with a strange device where the doorknob should have been. The device looked a bit like a spider, with curly wires spreading out in all directions, but where the head of the spider might have been as the keyboard of a typewriter. Even in her excitement to see the headquarters, Violet's inventing mind was interested in such a device, and she leaned closer to see what it was.     “Wait,” the sweatered scout said, reaching his arm out to stop her. “This is a coded lock. If we don't operate it properly, we won't be able to get into the headquarters.”     “How does it work?” Violet said, shivering slightly in the cold.     “I'm not sure,” the scout admitted, and took out his commonplace book again. “It's called the Vernacularly Fastened Door, so — ”     “So it operates on language,” Klaus finished. “Vernacular is a word for 'a local language or dialect.'”     “Of course,” Violet said. “See how the wires are curled around the hinges of the door? They're locked in place, unless you type in the right sequence of letters on that keyboard. There are more letters than numbers, so it would be more difficult for someone to guess the combination of the lock.”     “That's what I read,” the scout confirmed looking at a page in his notebook. “You're supposed to type in three specific phrases in a row. The phrases change every season, so volunteers need to have a lot of information at their fingertips to use this door. The first is the name of the scientist most widely credited with the discovery of gravity.”     “That's easy,” Violet said, and typed in S-I-R-I-S-A-A-C-N-E-W-T-O-N, the name of a physicist she had always admired. When she was finished, there was a muted clicking sound from the typewriter keyboard, as if the device was warming up.     “The second is the Latin name for the Volunteer Feline Detectives,” the scout said. “I found the answer in Remarkable Phenomena of the Mortmain Mountains . It's Panthera leo .” He leaned forward and typed in P-A-N-T-H-E-R-A-L-E-O. There was a very quiet buzzing and and the children saw that the wires near the hinges were shaking very slightly.     “It's beginning to unlock,” Violet said. “I hope I get a chance to study this invention.”     “Let's get to the headquarters first,” Klaus said. “What's the third phrase?”     The scout sighed, and turned a page in the commonplace book. “I'm not sure,” he admitted. “Another volunteer told me that it's the central theme of Leo Tolstoy's novel Anna Karenina, but I haven't had a chance to read it yet.”     Violet knew that her brother was smiling, even though she could not see his face through the mask. She was remembering one summer, very long ago, when Klaus was very young and Sunny was not even conceived. Every summer, the Baudelaires' mother would read a very long book, joking that lifting a large novel was the only exercise she liked to get during the hot months. During the time Violet was thinking of, Mrs. Baudelaire chose Anna Karenina for her summer reading, and Klaus would sit on his mother's lap for hours at a time while she read The middle Baudelaire had not been reading very long, but their mother helped him with the big words and would occasionally stop reading to explain what had happened in the story, and in this way Klaus and his mother read the story of Ms. Karenina, whose boyfriend treats her so poorly that she throws herself under a train. Violet had spent most of that summer studying the laws of thermodynamics and building a miniature helicopter out of an eggbeater and some old copper wiring, but she knew that Klaus must remember the central theme of the book he read on his mother's lap.     “The central theme of Anna Karenina” he said, “is that a rural life of moral simplicity, despite its monotony, is the preferable personal narrative to a daring life of impulsive passion, which only leads to tragedy.”     “That's a very long theme,” the scout said.     “It's a very long book,” Klaus replied. “But I can work quickly. My sisters and I once tapped out a long telegram in no time at all.”     “Too bad that telegram never arrived,” the scout said quietly, but the middle Baudelaire was already pressing the keys on the Vernacularly Fastened Door. As Klaus typed the words “a rural life,” a phrase which here means “living in the country,” the wires began to curl and uncurl very quickly, like worms on a sidewalk after it has rained, and by the time Klaus was typing “the preferable personal narrative,” a phrase which here means “the way to live your life,” the entire door was quivering as if it were as nervous as the Baudelaires. Finally, Klaus typed “T-R-A-G-E-D-Y,” and the three children stepped back, but instead of opening, the door stopped shaking and the wires stopped moving, and the passageway was dead quiet.     “It's not opening,” Violet said. “Maybe that isn't the central theme of Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina”     “It seemed like it was working until the last word,” the scout said.     “Maybe the mechanism is a little stuck ” Violet said.     “Or maybe a daring life of impulsive passion only leads to something else,” the scout said, and in some cases this mysterious person was right. A daring life of impulsive passion is an expression which refers to people who follow what is in their hearts, and like people who prefer to follow their head, or follow the advice of other people, or follow a mysterious man in a dark blue raincoat, people who lead a daring life of impulsive passion end up doing all sorts of things. For instance, if you ever find yourself reading a book entitled The Bible, you would find the story of Adam and Eve, whose daring life of impulsive passion led to them putting on clothing for the first time in their lives, in order to leave the snake-infested garden where they had been living. Bonnie and Clyde, another famous couple who lived a daring life of impulsive passion, found that it led them to a successful if short career in bank robbery. And in my own case, in the few moments where I have led a daring life of impulsive passion, it has led to all sorts of trouble, from false accusations of arson to a broken cufflink I can never have repaired. But in this case, as the Baudelaires stood at the Vernacularly Fastened Door, hoping to reach the V.F.D. headquarters, rescue their sister, and see if one of their parents was indeed alive, it was not the sweatered scout but the two Baudelaires who were right, because in Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, a daring life of impulsive passion leads only to tragedy, as Klaus said, and as Violet said, the mechanism was a little stuck, and after a few seconds, the door swung open with a slow and eerie creak. The children stepped through the door, blinking in the sudden light, and stood frozen in their steps. If you have read this far in the Baudelaires' woeful story, then you will not be surprised to learn that the V.F.D. headquarters in the Valley of Four Drafts in the Mortmain Mountains was no more, but Violet and Klaus, of course, were not reading their own story. They were in their own story, and this was the part of their story where they were sick with shock at what they saw.     The Vernacularly Fastened Door did not open onto a kitchen, not anymore. When the Baudelaires followed the mysterious scout through the doorway, they found themselves standing in what at first seemed to be a large field, growing a black and ruined harvest in a valley as cold and drafty as its name. But slowly, they saw the charred remains of the grand and impressive building that had stood where the three children were standing. Nearby was a handful of silverware that had survived the blaze, scattered in front of the remnants of a stove, and a refrigerator stood to one side, as if it were guarding the ashen remains of the rest of the kitchen. To one side was a pile of burnt wood that had probably once been a large dining table, with a half-melted candelabra sticking out of the top like a baby tree. Farther away, they could see the mysterious shapes of other objects that had survived the fire — a trombone, the pendulum of a grandfather clock, what looked like a periscope, or perhaps a spyglass, an ice cream scoop, lying forlornly in a pile of ashes encrusted with burnt sugar, and an iron archway emblazoned with the words “V.F.D. Library,” but there was nothing beyond the archway but piles and piles of blackened remains. It was a devastating sight, and it made Violet and Klaus feel as if they were all alone in a world that had been completely ruined. The only thing they could see that seemed untouched by the fire was a sheer, white wall, beyond the refrigerator, that rose up as far as two siblings could see. It took the Baudelaires a few moments to realize that it was a frozen waterfall, rising up in a slippery slope toward the source of the Stricken Stream on Mount Fraught , so shiny and white that it made the ruined headquarters look even darker.     “It must have been beautiful,” the sweatered scout said, in a quivering voice. He walked toward the waterfall, his feet churning up black dust with every step. “I read that there was a large window,” he said, moving his gloved hand in the air as if it were still there. “When it was your turn to cook, you could look out at the waterfall while you were chopping vegetables or simmering a sauce. It was supposed to be very peaceful. And there was a mechanism just outside the window that turned some of the water from the pool into steam. The steam rose up and covered the headquarters, so it couldn't be seen through the blanket of mist.”     The Baudelaires walked to where the scout was standing, and looked into the frozen pool at the bottom of the waterfall. The pool branched off into two tributaries, a word which here means “divisions of a river or stream, each twisting off in a different direction past the ruins of the headquarters, and curving around the Mortmain Mountains until they disappeared from view.” Violet and Klaus gazed sadly at the icy swirls of black and gray they had noticed when they were walking alongside the Stricken Stream.     “It was ashes” Klaus said quietly. “Ashes from the fire fell into the pool at the bottom of the waterfall, and the stream carried them down the river.”     Violet found that it was easier to discuss a small, specific matter than think about her immense disappointment.     “But the pool is frozen solid,” she said. “The stream couldn't have carried the ashes anywhere.”     “It wouldn't have been frozen when it happened,” Klaus replied. “The heat from the fire would have thawed the pool.”     “It must have been awful to see,” the sweatered scout said. Violet and Klaus stood with him, imagining the inferno, a word which here means “enormous fire that destroyed a secret headquarters high in the mountains.” They could almost hear the shattering of glass as the windows fell away, and the crackle of the fire as it consumed everything it could. They could almost smell the thick smoke as it floated upward and blackened the sky, and they could almost see the books in the library, falling from the burning shelves and tumbling into ashes The only thing they could not picture was who might have been at the headquarters when the fire began, running out into the freezing cold to avoid the flames.     “Do you think,” Violet said, “any of the volunteers . . .”     “There's no sign that anyone was here,” the scout said quickly.     “But how can we know for sure?” Klaus asked. “There could be a survivor someplace right now.”     “Hello?” Violet called, looking around her at the rubble. “Hello?” She found that her eyes were filling with tears, as she called out for the people she knew in her heart were nowhere nearby. The eldest Baudelaire felt as if she had been calling for these people since that terrible day on the beach, and that if she called them enough they might appear before her. She thought of all the times she had called them, back when she lived with her siblings in the Baudelaire mansion. Sometimes she called them when she wanted them to see something she had invented. Sometimes she called them when she wanted them to know she had arrived home. And sometimes she called them just because she wanted to know where they were. Sometimes Violet just wanted to see them, and feel that she was safe as long as they were around. “Mother!” Violet Baudelaire called. “Father!”     There was no answer.     “Mom!” Klaus called. “Dad!”     The Baudelaires heard nothing but the rush of all four of the valley's drafts, and a long creak as the Vernacularly Fastened Door blew shut. They saw that the door had been made to look just like the side of the mountain, so that they could scarcely see where they had come from, or the way to get back. Now they were truly alone.     “I know we were all hoping to find people at the headquarters,” the sweatered scout said gently, “but I don't think anyone is here. I think we're all by ourselves.”     “That's impossible!” Klaus cried, and Violet could hear that he was crying. He reached through his layers of clothing until he found his pocket, and pulled out page thirteen from the Snicket file, which he had been carrying with him since the Baudelaires had found it at Heimlich Hospital . The page had a photograph of their parents, standing with Jacques Snicket and another man the Baudelaires had been unable to identify, and above the photograph was a sentence Klaus had memorized from reading it so many times.     '“Because of the evidence discussed on page nine,'” he recited tearfully, “'experts now suspect that there may in fact be one survivor of the fire, but the survivor's whereabouts are unknown.'” He walked up to the scout and shook the page in his face. “We thought the survivor would be here,” he said.     “I think the survivor is here,” the scout said quietly, and removed his mask to reveal his face at last. “I'm Quigley Quagmire,” he said, “I survived the fire that destroyed my home, and I was hoping to find my brother and sister.”















C H A P T E REightand I will spend the rest of our lives together in happiness and bliss,"" when I actually suspected that things were about to get much worse. And so it was with the two elder Baudelaires, when they stood face-to-face with Quigley Quagmire and found themselves to be saying things they knew were absurd.     “You're dead,” Violet said, and took off her mask to make sure she was seeing things clearly. But there was no mistaking Quigley, even though the Baudelaires had never seen him before. He looked so much like Duncan and Isadora that he could only be the third Quagmire triplet.     “You perished in a fire along with your parents,” Klaus said, but as he took off his mask he knew this wasn't so. Quigley was even giving the two Baudelaires a small smile that looked exactly like his siblings'.     “No,” Quigley said. “I survived, and I've been looking for my siblings ever since.”      “But how did you survive?” Violet asked. “Duncan and Isadora said that the house burned to the ground.”     “It did,” Quigley said sadly. He looked out at the frozen waterfall and sighed deeply. “I suppose I should start at the beginning. I was in my family's library, studying a map of the Finite Forest , when I heard a shattering of glass, and people shouting. My mother ran into the room and said there was a fire. We tried to go out the front door but the main hall was filled with smoke, so she took me back into the library and lifted a corner of the rug. There was a secret door underneath. She told me to wait down below while she fetched my siblings, and she left me there in the dark. I remember hearing the house falling to pieces above me, and the sound of frantic footsteps, and my siblings screaming.” Quigley put his mask down on the ground and looked at the two Baudelaires. “But she never came back,” he said. “Nobody came back, and when I tried to open the door, something had fallen on top of it and it wouldn't budge.”     “How did you get out?” Klaus asked.     “I walked,” Quigley said. “When it became clear that no one was going to rescue me, I felt around in the dark and realized I was in a sort of passageway. There was nowhere else to go so I started walking. I've never been so frightened in my life, walking alone in some dark passageway my parents had kept secret. I couldn't imagine where it would lead.”     The two Baudelaires looked at one another. They were thinking about the secret passageway they had discovered underneath their home, which they had discovered when they were under the care of Esmé Squalor and her husband.     “And where did it lead?” Violet said.     “To the house of a herpetologist,” Quigley said. “At the end of the passageway was a secret door that opened into an enormous room, made entirely of glass. The room was  filled with empty cages, but it was clear that the room had once housed an enormous collection of reptiles.”     “We've been there!” Klaus cried in amazement. “That's Uncle Monty's house! He was our guardian until Count Olaf arrived, disguised as — ”     “As a lab assistant,” Quigley finished. “I know. His suitcase was still there.”     “There was a secret passageway under our house, too,” Violet said, “but we didn't discover it until we lived with Esmé Squalor.”     “There are secrets everywhere,” Quigley said. “I think everyone's parents have secrets. You just have to know where to look for them.”     “But why would our parents, and yours, have tunnels underneath their homes leading to a fancy apartment building and a herpetologist's home?” Klaus said. “It doesn't make any sense.”    Quigley sighed, and put his backpack on the ashen ground, next to his mask. “There's a lot that doesn't make sense,” he said. “I was hoping to find the answers here, but now I don't know if I'll ever find them.” He took out his purple notebook and opened it to the first page. “All I can tell you is what I have here in this commonplace book.”     Klaus gave Quigley a small smile, and reached into his pockets to retrieve all of the papers he had stored there. “You tell us what you know,” he said, “and we'll tell you what we know. Perhaps together we can answer our own questions.”"|"The Slippery Slope"|"Lemony Snicket"
"ap > 02:00"|"after two"|"A Series of Unfortunate Events 10 - The Slippery Slope     “And without salmon,” he said, “the Mortmain Mountain eagles will go hungry. The destruction of V.F.D, headquarters has caused even more damage than I thought.” Klaus nodded in agreement. “When we were walking along the Stricken Stream,” he said, “the fish were coughing from all the ashes in the water. Remember, Violet?”     He turned to his sister, but Violet was only half listening. She was still gazing at the words on the archway, and trying to remember where she heard them before. “I can just hear those words,” she said. “The world is quiet here. ” She closed her eyes. “I think it was a very long time ago, before you were born, Klaus.”     “Maybe someone said them to you,” Quigley said.     Violet tried to remember as far back as she could, but everything seemed as misty as it did in the mountains. She could see the face of her mother, and her father standing behind her, wearing a suit as black as the ashes of V.F.D. headquarters. Their mouths were open, but Violet could not remember what they were saying. No matter how hard she tried, the memory was as silent as the grave. “Nobody said them to me,” she said finally. “Someone sang them. I think my parents sang the words 'the world is quiet here' a long time ago, but I don't know why.” She opened her eyes and faced her brother and her friend. “I think we might be doing the wrong thing,” she said.     “But we agreed,” Quigley said, “to fight fire with fire.”     Violet nodded, and stuck her hands in her pocket, bumping up against the bread knife again. She thought of the darkness of the pit, and the scream Esmé would make as she fell into it. “I know we agreed,” Violet said, “but if V.F.D. really stands for Volunteer Fire Department, then they're an organization that stops fire. If everyone fought fire with fire, the entire world would go up in smoke.”     “I see what you mean,” Quigley said. “If the V.F.D. motto is 'The world is quiet here,' we ought to be doing something less noisy and violent than trapping someone, no matter how wicked they are.”      “When I was looking into the pit,” Klaus said quietly, “I was remembering something I read in a book by a famous philosopher. He said, 'Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster. And when you look long into an abyss, the abyss also looks into you.'” Klaus looked at his sister, and then at the sight of Esmé approaching, and then at the weakened wood that the three children had placed on the ground. “'Abyss' is a fancy word for 'pit,'” he said. “We built an abyss for Esmé to fall into. That's something a monster might do.”     Quigley was copying Klaus's words into his commonplace book. “What happened to that philosopher?” he asked.     “He's dead,” Klaus replied. “I think you're right, Violet. We don't want to be as villainous and monstrous as Count Olaf.”     “But what are we going to do?” Quigley asked. “Sunny is still Olaf's prisoner, and Esmé will be here at any moment. If we don't think of the right thing right now, it'll be too late.”     As soon as the triplet finished his sentence however, the three children heard something that made them realize it might already be too late. From behind the archway, Violet, Klaus, and Quigley heard a rough, scraping sound as the toboggan reached the bottom of the waterfall and slid to a halt, and then a triumphant giggle from the mouth of Esmé Squalor. The three volunteers peeked around the archway and saw the treacherous girlfriend step off the toboggan with a greedy smile on her face. But when Esmé adjusted her enormous flame-imitating dress and took a step toward the smoking Verdant Flammable Devices, Violet was not looking at her any more. Violet was looking down at the ground, just a few steps from where she was standing. Three dark, round masks were sitting in a pile, where Violet, Klaus, and Quigley had left them upon arriving at the ruins of headquarters. They had assumed that they would not need them again, but the eldest Baudelaire realized they had been wrong. As Esmé took another step closer to the trap, Violet dashed over to the masks, put one on and stepped out of her hiding place as her brother and her friend looked on.     “Stop, Esmé!” she cried. “It's a trap!”     Esmé stopped in her tracks and gave Violet a curious look. “Who are you?” she asked. “You shouldn't sneak up on people like that. It's a villainous thing to do.”     “I'm a volunteer,” Violet said.     Esmé's mouth, heavy with orange lipstick that matched her dress, curled into a sneer. “There are no volunteers here,” she said. “The entire headquarters are destroyed!”     Klaus was the next to grab a mask and confront Olaf's treacherous romantic companion. “Our headquarters might be destroyed,” he said, “but the V.F.D. is as strong as ever!”     Esmé frowned at the two siblings as if she couldn't decide whether to be frightened or not “You may be strong,” she said nervously, “but you're also very short.” Her dress crackled as she started to take another step toward the pit. “When I get my hands on you — ”     “No!” Quigley cried, and stepped out from the arch wearing his mask, taking care not to fall into his own trap. “Don't come any closer, Esmé. If you take another step, you'll fall into our trap.”     “You're making that up,” Esmé said, but she did not move any closer. “You're trying to keep all the cigarettes for yourself.”      “They're not cigarettes,” Klaus said, “and we're not liars. Underneath the wood you're about to step on is a very deep pit.”     Esmé looked at them suspiciously. Gingerly — a word which here means “without falling into a very deep hole” — she leaned down and moved a piece of wood aside, and stared down into the trap the children had built. “Well, well, well,” she said. “You did build a trap. I never would have fallen for it, of course, but I must admit you dug quite a pit.”     “We wanted to trap you,” Violet said, “so we could trade you for the safe return of Sunny Baudelaire. But — ”     “But you didn't have the courage to go through with it,” Esmé said with a mocking smile. “You volunteers are never brave enough to do something for the greater good.”     “Throwing people into pits isn't the greater good!” Quigley cried. “It's villainous treachery!”     “If you weren't such an idiot,” Esmé said, “you'd realize that those things are more or less the same.”     “He is not an idiot,” Violet said fiercely. She knew, of course, that it was not worthwhile to get upset over insults from such a ridiculous person, but she liked Quigley too much to hear him called names. “He led us here to the headquarters using a map he drew himself.”     “He's very well-read,” Klaus said.     At Klaus's words, Esmé threw back her head and laughed, shaking the crackling layers of her enormous dress. “Well-read!” she repeated in a particularly nasty tone of voice. “Being well-read won't help you in this world. Many years ago, I was supposed to waste my entire summer reading Anna Karenina, but I knew that silly book would never help me, so I threw it into the fireplace.” She reached down and picked up a few more pieces of wood, which she tossed aside with a snicker. “Look at your precious headquarters, volunteers! It's as ruined as my book. And look at me! I'm beautiful, fashionable, and I smoke cigarettes!” She laughed again, and pointed at the children with a scornful finger. “If you didn't spend all your time with your heads stuck in books, you'd have that precious baby back.”     “We're going to get her back,” Violet said firmly.     “Really?” Esmé said mockingly. “And how do you propose to do that?”     “I'm going to talk to Count Olaf,” Violet said, “and he's going to give her back to me.”     Esmé threw back her head and started to laugh, but not with as much enthusiasm as before. “What do you mean?” she said.     “Just what I said,” Violet said.     “Hmmm,” Esmé said suspiciously. “Let me think for a moment.” The evil girlfriend began to pace back and forth on the frozen pond, her enormous dress crackling with every step.     Klaus leaned in to whisper to his sister. “What are you doing?” he asked. “Do you honestly think that we can get Sunny back from Count Olaf with a simple conversation?”     “I don't know,” Violet whispered back, “but it's better than luring someone into a trap.”     “It was wrong to dig that pit,” Quigley agreed, “but I'm not sure that walking straight into Olaf's clutches is the right thing to do, either.”     “It'll take a while to reach Mount Fraught again,” Violet said. “We'll think of something during the climb.”     “I hope so,” Klaus said, “but if we can't think of something — ”     Klaus did not get a chance to say what might happen if they couldn't think of something because Esmé clapped her hands together to get the children's attention.     “If you really want to talk to my boyfriend,” she said, “I suppose I can take you to where he is. If you weren't so stupid, you'd know that he's very nearby.”     “We know where he is, Esmé,” Klaus said. “He's at the top of the waterfall, at the source of the Stricken Stream.”     “Then I suppose you know how we can get there,” Esmé said, and looked a little foolish. “The toboggan doesn't go uphill, so I actually have no idea how we can reach the peak.”     “She will invent a way,” Quigley said, pointing at Violet.     Violet smiled at her friend, grateful for his support, and closed her eyes underneath her mask. Once more, she was thinking of something she had heard sung to her, when she was a very little girl. She had already thought of the way that the three children could take Esmé with them when they ascended the hill, but thinking of their journey made her think of a song she had not thought of for many years. Perhaps when you were very young, someone sang this song to you, perhaps to lull you to sleep, or to entertain you on a long car trip, or in order to teach you a secret code. The song is called “The Itsy Bitsy Spider,” and it is one of the saddest songs ever composed. It tells the story of a small spider who is trying to climb up a water spout, but every time its climb is half over, there is a great burst of water, either due to rain or somebody turning the spout on, and at the end of the song, the spider has decided to try one more time, and will likely be washed away once again.     Violet Baudelaire could not help feeling like this poor spider as she ascended the waterfall for the last time, with Quigley and Klaus beside her and Esmé Squalor on her toboggan behind them. After attaching the last two forks to Klaus's shoes, she had told her companions to tie the leather straps of the toboggan around their waists, so they could drag the villainous girlfriend behind them as they climbed. It was exhausting to approach the peak of Mount Fraught in this manner, particularly after staying up all night digging a pit, and it seemed like they might get washed back down by the dripping water of the Stricken Stream, like the spider Violet had heard about when she was a little girl. The ice on the slope was weakening, after two fork-assisted climbs, a toboggan ride, and the increasing temperatures of False Spring, and with each step of Violet's invention, the ice would shift slightly. It was clear that the slippery slope was almost as exhausted as they were, and soon the ice would vanish completely. “Mush!” Esmé called from the toboggan. She was using an expression that arctic explorers shouted to their sled dogs, and it certainly did not make the journey any easier.     “I wish she'd stop saying that,” Violet murmured from behind her mask. She tapped the candelabra on the ice ahead of her, and a small piece detached from the waterfall and fell to the ruins of headquarters. She watched it disappear below her and sighed. She would never see the V.F.D. headquarters in all its glory. None of the Baudelaires would. Violet would never know how it felt to cook in the kitchen and gaze at the two tributaries of the Stricken Stream, while chatting with the other volunteers. Klaus would never know how it felt to relax in the library and learn all of the secrets of V.F.D. in the comfort of one of the library's chairs, with his feet up on one of the matching V.F.D. footstools. Sunny would never operate the projector in the movie room, or practice the art of the fake mustache in the disguise center, or sit in the parlor at tea time and eat the almond cookies made from my grandmother's recipe. Violet would never study chemical composition in one of the six laboratories, and Klaus would never use the balance beams at the gymnasium, and Sunny would never stand behind the counter at the ice cream shop and prepare butterscotch sundaes for the swimming coaches when it was her turn. And none of the Baudelaires would ever meet some of the organization's most beloved volunteers, including the mechanical instructor C. M. Kornbluth, and Dr. Isaac Anwhistle, whom everyone called Ike, and the brave volunteer who tossed the sugar bowl out the kitchen window so it would not be destroyed in the blaze, and watched it float away on one of the tributaries of the Stricken Stream. The Baudelaires would never do any of these things, any more than I will ever see my beloved Beatrice again, or retrieve my pickle from the refrigerator in which I left it, and return it to its rightful place in an important coded sandwich. Violet, of course, was not aware of everything she would never do, but as she gazed down at the vast, ashen remains of the headquarters, she felt as if her whole journey in the Mortmain Mountains had been as useless as the journey of a tiny arachnid in a song she had never liked to hear.     “Mush!” Esmé cried again, with a cruel chuckle.     “Please stop saying that, Esmé,” Violet called down impatiently. “That mush nonsense is slowing our climb.”     “A slow climb might be to our advantage,” Klaus murmured to his sister. “The longer it takes us to reach the summit, the longer we have to think up what we're going to say to Count Olaf.”     “We could tell him that he's surrounded,” Quigley said, “and that there are volunteers everywhere ready to arrest him if he doesn't let Sunny go free.”     Violet shook her mask. “He won't believe that,” she said, sticking a fork-assisted shoe into the waterfall. “He can see everything and everyone from Mount Fraught . He'll know we're the only volunteers in the area.”     “There must be something we can do,” Klaus said. “We didn't make this journey into the mountains for nothing.”     “Of course not,” Quigley said. “We found each other, and we solved some of the mysteries that were haunting us.”     “Will that be enough,” Violet asked, “to defeat all those villains on the peak?”     Violet's question was a difficult one, and neither Klaus nor Quigley had the answer, and so rather than hazard a guess — a phrase which here means “continue to expend their energy by discussing the matter” — they decided to hazard their climb, a phrase which here means “continue their difficult journey in silence, until they arrived at last at the source of the Stricken Stream.” Hoisting themselves up onto the flat peak, they sat on the edge and pulled the leather straps as hard as they could. It was such a difficult task to drag Esmé Squalor and the toboggan over the edge of the slope and onto Mount Fraught that the children did not notice who was nearby until they heard a familiar scratchy voice right behind them.     “Who goes there?” Count Olaf demanded.     Breathless from the climb, the three children turned around to see the villain standing with his two sinister cohorts near his long, black automobile, glaring suspiciously at the masked volunteers.     “We thought you'd get here by taking the path,” said the man with a beard but no hair, “not by climbing up the waterfall.”     “No, no, no,” Esmé said quickly. “These aren't the people we're expecting. These are some volunteers I found at headquarters.”     “Volunteers?” said the woman with hair but no beard, but her voice did not sound as deep as it usually did. The villains gave the children the same confused frown they had seen from Esmé, as if they were unsure whether to be scared or scornful, and the hookhanded man, the two white-faced women, and the three former carnival employees gathered around to see what had made their villainous boss fall silent. Although they were exhausted, the two Baudelaires hurriedly untied the straps of the toboggan from their waists and stood with Quigley to face their enemies. The orphans were very scared, of course, but they found that with their faces concealed they could speak their minds, a phrase which here means “confront Count Olaf and his companions as if they weren't one bit frightened.”     “We built a trap to capture your girlfriend, Olaf,” Violet said, “but we didn't want to become a monster like you.”     “They're idiotic liars!” Esmé cried. “I found them hogging the cigarettes, so I captured them myself and made them drag me up the waterfall like sled dogs.”     The middle Baudelaire ignored the wicked girlfriend's nonsense. “We're here for Sunny Baudelaire,” Klaus said, “and we're not leaving without her.”     Count Olaf frowned, and peered at them with his shiny, shiny eyes as if he were trying to see through their masks. “And what makes you so certain,” he said, “that I'll give you my prisoner just because you say so?”     Violet thought furiously, looking around at her surroundings for anything that might give her an idea of what to do. Count Olaf clearly believed that the three masked people in front of him were members of V.F.D., and she felt that if she could just find the right words to say, she could defeat him without becoming as villainous as her enemies. But she could not find the words, and neither could her brother nor her friend, who stood beside her in silence. The winds of the Mortmain Mountains blew against them, and Violet stuck her hands in her pockets, bumping one finger against the long bread knife. She began to think that perhaps trapping Esmé had been the right thing to do after all. Count Olaf's frown began to fade, and his mouth started to curl upward in a triumphant smile, but just as he opened his mouth to speak, Violet saw two things that gave her hope once more. The first was the sight of two notebooks, one a deep shade of purple and the other dark blue, sticking out of the pockets of her companions — commonplace books, where Klaus and Quigley had written down all of the information they had found in the ruined library of V.F.D. headquarters. And the other was a collection of dishes spread out on the flat rock that Olaf's troupe had been using for a table. Sunny had been forced to wash these dishes, using handfuls of melted snow, and she had laid them out to dry in the sunshine of False Spring. Violet could see a stack of plates, each emblazoned with the familiar image of an eye, as well as a row of teacups and a small pitcher for cream. But there was something missing from the tea set, and it made Violet smile behind her mask as she turned to face Count Olaf again.     “You will give us Sunny,” she said, “because we know where the sugar bowl is.”     Count Olaf gasped, and raised his one eyebrow very high as he gazed at the two Baudelaires and their companion, his eyes shinier than they had ever seen them. “Where is it?” he said, in a terrible, wheezing whisper. “Give it to me!”     Violet shook her head, grateful that her face was still hidden behind a mask. “Not until you give us Sunny Baudelaire,” she said.     “Never!” the villain replied. “Without that big-toothed brat, I'll never capture the Baudelaire fortune. You give me the sugar bowl this instant, or I'll throw all of you off this mountain!”     “If you throw us off the mountain,” Klaus said, “you'll never know where the sugar bowl is.” He did not add, of course, that the Baudelaires had no idea where the sugar bowl was, or why in the world it was so important.     Esmé Squalor took a sinister step toward her boyfriend, her flame-imitating dress crackling against the cold ground. “We must have that sugar bowl,” she snarled. “Let the baby go. We'll cook up another scheme to steal the fortune.”     “But stealing the fortune is the greater good,” Count Olaf said. “We can't let the baby go.”     “Getting the sugar bowl is the greater good,” Esmé said, with a frown.     “Stealing the fortune,” Olaf insisted.     “Getting the sugar bowl,” Esmé replied.     “Fortune!”     “Sugar bowl!”     “Fortune!”     “Sugar bowl!""     “That's enough!” ordered the man with a beard but no hair. “Our recruitment scheme is about to be put into action. We can't have you arguing all day long.”     “We wouldn't have argued all day long,” Count Olaf said timidly. ""After a few hours —”     “We said that's enough!” ordered the woman with hair but no beard. “Bring the baby over here!”     “Bring the baby at once!” Count Olaf ordered the two white-faced women. “She's napping in her casserole dish.”     The two white-faced women sighed, but hurried over to the casserole dish and lifted it together, as if they were cooks removing something from the oven instead of villainous employees bringing over a prisoner, while the two sinister visitors reached down the necks of their shirts and retrieved something that was hanging around their necks. Violet and Klaus were surprised to see two shiny silver whistles, like the one Count Olaf had used as part of his disguise at Prufrock Preparatory School , when he was pretending to be a coach.     “Watch this, volunteers,” said the sinister man in his hoarse voice, and the two mysterious villains blew their whistles. Instantly, the children heard an enormous rustling sound over their heads, as if the Mortmain Mountain winds were as frightened as the youngsters, and it suddenly grew very dim, as if the morning sun had also put on a mask. But when they looked up, Violet, Klaus, and Quigley saw that the reason for the noisy sky and the fading light was perhaps more strange than frightened winds and a masked sun. The sky above Mount Fraught was swarming with eagles. There were hundreds and hundreds of them, flying in silent circles high above the two sinister villains. They must have been nesting nearby to have arrived so quickly, and they must have been very thoroughly trained to be so eerily silent. Some of them looked very old, old enough to have been in the skies when the Baudelaire parents were children themselves. Some of them looked quite young, as if they had only recently emerged from the egg and were already obeying the shrill sound of a whistle. But all of them looked exhausted, as if they would rather be anywhere else but the summit of the Mortmain Mountains , doing absolutely anything rather than following the orders of such wretched people.     “Look at these creatures!” cried the woman with hair but no beard. “When the schism occurred, you may have won the carrier crows, volunteers, and you may have won the trained reptiles.”     “Not anymore,” Count Olaf said. “All of the reptiles except one — ”     “Don't interrupt,” the sinister woman interrupted. “You may have the carrier crows, but we have the two most powerful mammals in the world to do our bidding — the lions and eagles!”     “Eagles aren't mammals” Klaus cried out in frustration. “They're birds!”     “They're slaves,” said the man with a beard but no hair, and the two villains reached into the pockets of their suits and drew out two long, wicked-looking whips. Violet and Klaus could see at once that they were similar to the whip Olaf had used when bossing around the lions at Caligari Carnival. With matching, sinister sneers the two mysterious villains cracked their whips in the air, and four eagles swooped down from the sky, landing on the strange thick pads that the villains had on their shoulders.     “These beasts will do anything we tell them to do,” the woman said. “And today they're going to help us with our greatest triumph.” She uncurled the whip and gestured to the ground around her, and the children noticed for the first time an enormous net on the ground, spread out over almost the entire peak and just stopping at their fork-assisted climbing shoes. “On my signal, these eagles will lift this net from the ground and carry it into the sky, capturing a group of young people who think they're here to celebrate False Spring.”     “The Snow Scouts,” Violet said in astonishment.     “We'll capture every one of those uniformed brats,” the villainous man bragged, “and each one of them will be offered the exciting opportunity to join us.”     “They'll never join you,” Klaus said.     “Of course they will,” said the sinister woman, in her deep, deep voice. “They'll either be recruited, or they'll be our prisoners. But one thing is for certain — we'll burn down every single one of their parents' homes.”     The two Baudelaires shuddered, and even Count Olaf looked a bit uneasy. “Of course,” he said quickly, “the main reason we're doing all this is to get our hands on all those fortunes.”     “Of course,” Esmé said with a nervous snicker. “We'll have the Spats fortune, the Kornbluth fortune, the Winnipeg fortune, and many others. I'll be able to afford the penthouse apartment of every single building that isn't on fire!”     “Once you tell us where the sugar bowl is,” said the man with a beard but no hair, “you can leave, volunteers, and take your baby friend with you. But wouldn't you rather join us?”     “No, thank you,” Quigley said. “We're not interested.”     “It doesn't matter if you're interested or not,” said the woman with hair but no beard. “Look around you. You're hopelessly outnumbered. Wherever we go, we find new comrades who are eager to assist us in our work.”     “We have comrades, too,” Violet said bravely. “As soon as we rescue Sunny, we're going to meet up with the other volunteers at the last safe place, and tell them about your terrible scheme!”     “It's too late for that, volunteers,” said Count Olaf in triumph. “Here come my new recruits!”     With a horrible laugh, the villain pointed in the direction of the rocky path, and the elder Baudelaires could see, past the covered casserole dish still held by the white-faced women, the arrival of the uniformed Snow Scouts, walking in two neat lines, more like eggs in a carton than young people on a hike. Apparently, the scouts had realized that the snow gnats were absent from this part of the Mortmain Mountains and had removed their masks, so Violet and Klaus could instantly spot Carmelita Spats, standing at the front of one of the lines with a tiara on her head — “tiara” is a word which here means “small crown given to a nasty little girl for no good reason” — and a large smirk on her face. Beside her, at the head of the other line, stood Bruce, holding the Springpole in one hand and a big cigar in the other. There was something about his face that Violet and Klaus found familiar, but they were too concerned about the villainous recruitment plan to give it much thought.     “What are all you cakesniffers doing here?” demanded Carmelita, in an obnoxious voice the two siblings found equally familiar. “I'm the False Spring Queen, and I order you to go away!”     “Now, now, Carmelita,” Bruce said. “I'm sure these people are here to help celebrate your special day. Let's try to be accommodating. In fact we should try to be accommodating, basic, calm, darling — ”     The scouts had begun to say the ridiculous pledge along with Bruce, but the two Baudelaires knew they could not wait for the entire alphabetical list to be recited.     “Bruce,” Violet interrupted quickly, “these people are not here to help you celebrate False Spring. They're here to kidnap all of the Snow Scouts.”     “What?” Bruce asked with a smile, as if the eldest Baudelaire might have been joking.     “It's a trap,” Klaus said. “Please, turn around and lead the scouts away from here.”     “Pay no attention to these three masked idiots,” Count Olaf said quickly. “The mountain air has gone to their heads. Just take a few steps closer and we'll all join in a special celebration.”     “We're happy to accommodate,” Bruce said. ""After all, we're accommodating, basic —”     “No!” Violet cried. “Don't you see the net on the ground? Don't you see the eagles in the sky?”     “The net is decoration,” Esmé said, with a smile as false as the Spring, “and the eagles are wildlife.”     “Please listen to us!” Klaus said. “You're in terrible danger!”     Carmelita glared at the two Baudelaires, and adjusted her tiara. “Why should I listen to cakesniffing strangers like you?” she asked. “You're so stupid that you've still got your masks on, even though there aren't any snow gnats around here.”     Violet and Klaus looked at one another through their masks. Carmelita's response had been quite rude, but the two siblings had to admit she had a point. The Baudelaires were unlikely to convince anyone that they were telling the truth while their faces were unnecessarily covered. They did not want to sacrifice their disguises and reveal their true identities to Count Olaf and his troupe, but they couldn't risk the kidnapping of all the Snow Scouts, even to save their sister. The two Baudelaires nodded at one another, and then turned to see that Quigley was nodding, too, and the three children reached up and took off their masks for the greater good.     Count Olaf's mouth dropped open in surprise. “You're dead!” he said to the eldest Baudelaire, saying something that he knew full well was ridiculous. “You perished in the caravan, along with Klaus!”     Esmé stared at Klaus, looking just as astonished as her boyfriend. “You're dead, too!” she cried. “You fell off a mountain!”     “And you're one of those twins!” Olaf said to Quigley. “You died a long time ago!”     “I'm not a twin,” Quigley said, “and I'm not dead.”     “And,” Count Olaf said with a sneer, “you're not a volunteer. None of you are members of V.F.D. You're just a bunch of orphan brats.”     “In that case,” said the woman with hair but no beard, in her deep, deep voice, “there's no reason to worry about that stupid baby any longer.”     “That's true,” Olaf said, and turned to the white-faced women. “Throw the baby off the mountain!” he ordered.     Violet and Klaus cried out in horror, but the two white-faced women merely looked at the covered casserole dish they were holding, and then at one another. Then, slowly, they looked at Count Olaf, but neither of them moved an inch.     “Didn't you hear me?” Olaf asked. “Throw that baby off this mountain!”     “No,” said one of the white-faced women, and the two Baudelaires turned to them in relief.     “No?” asked Esmé Squalor in an astonished voice. “What do you mean, no?”     “We mean no,” said the white-faced woman, and her companion nodded. Together they put the covered casserole dish down on the ground in front of them. Violet and Klaus were surprised to see that the dish did not move, and assumed that their sister must have been too scared to come out.     “We don't want to participate in your schemes anymore,” said the other white-faced woman, and sighed. “For a while, it was fun to fight fire with fire, but we've seen enough flames and smoke to last our whole lives.”     “We don't think that it was a coincidence that our home burned to the ground,” said the first woman. “We lost a sibling in that fire, Olaf.”     Count Olaf pointed at the two women with a long, bony finger. “Obey my orders this instant!” he screamed, but his two former accomplices merely shook their heads, turned away from the villain, and began to walk away. Everyone on the square peak watched in silence as the two white-faced women walked past Count Olaf, past Esmé Squalor, past the two sinister villains with eagles on their shoulders, past the two Baudelaires and Quigley Quagmire, past the hook-handed man and the former employees of the carnival, and finally past Bruce and Carmelita Spats and the rest of the Snow Scouts, until they reached the rocky path and began to walk away from Mount Fraught altogether. Count Olaf opened his mouth and let out a terrible roar, and jumped up and down on the net.     “You can't walk away from me, you pasty-faced women!” he cried. “I'll find you and destroy you myself! In fact, I can do anything myself! I'm an individual practitioner, and I don't need anybody's help to throw this baby off the mountain!” With a nasty chuckle, he picked up the covered casserole dish, staggering slightly, and walked to the edge of the half-frozen waterfall.     “No!” Violet cried.     “Sunny!” Klaus screamed.     “Say good-bye to your baby sister, Baudelaires!” Count Olaf said, with a triumphant smile that showed all of his filthy teeth.     “I'm not a baby!” cried a familiar voice from under the villain's long, black automobile, and the two elder Baudelaires watched with pride and relief as Sunny emerged from behind the tire Violet had punctured, and ran to hug her siblings. Klaus had to take his glasses off to wipe the tears from his eyes as he was finally reunited with the young girl who was his sister. “I'm not a baby!” Sunny said again, turning to Olaf in triumph.     “How could this be?” Count Olaf said, but when he removed the cover from the casserole dish, he saw how this could be, because the object inside, which was about the same size and weight as the youngest Baudelaire, wasn't a baby either.     “Babganoush!” Sunny cried, which meant something along the lines of, “I concocted an escape plan with the eggplant that turned out to be even handier than I thought,” but there was no need for anyone to translate, as the large vegetable slid out of the casserole dish and landed with a plop! at Olaf's feet.     “Nothing is going right for me today!” cried the villain. “I'm beginning to think that washing my face was a complete waste of time!”     “Don't upset yourself, boss,” said Colette, contorting herself in concern. “I'm sure that Sunny will cook us something delicious with the eggplant.”     “That's true,” the hook-handed man said. “She's becoming quite a cook. The False Spring Rolls were quite tasty, and the lox was delicious.”     “It could have used a little dill, in my opinion,” Hugo said, but the three reunited Baudelaires turned away from this ridiculous conversation to face the Snow Scouts.     “Now do you believe us?” Violet asked Bruce. “Can't you see that this man is a terrible villain who is trying to do you harm?”     “Don't you remember us?” Klaus asked Carmelita Spats. “Count Olaf had a terrible scheme at Prufrock Prep, and he has a terrible scheme now!”     “Of course I remember you,” Carmelita said. “You're those cakesniffing orphans who caused Vice Principal Nero all that trouble. And now you're trying to ruin my very special day! Give me that Springpole, Uncle Bruce!”     “Now, now, Carmelita,” Bruce said, but Carmelita had already grabbed the long pole from Bruce's hands and was marching across the net toward the source of the Stricken Stream. The man with a beard but no hair and the woman with hair but no beard clasped their wicked whips and raised their shiny whistles to their sinister mouths, but the Baudelaires could see they were waiting to spring their trap until the rest of the scouts stepped forward, so they would be inside the net when the eagles lifted it from the ground.     “I crown myself False Spring Queen!” Carmelita announced, when she reached the very edge of Mount Fraught . With a nasty laugh of triumph, she elbowed the Baudelaires aside and drove the Springpole into the half-frozen top of the waterfall. There was a slow, loud shattering sound, and the Baudelaires looked down the slope and saw that an enormous crack was slowly making its way down the center of the waterfall, toward the pool and the two tributaries of the Stricken Stream. The Baudelaires gasped in horror. Although it was only the ice that was cracking, it looked as if the mountain were beginning to split in half, and that soon an enormous schism would divide the entire world.     “What are you looking at?” Carmelita asked scornfully. “Everybody's supposed to be doing a dance in my honor.”     “That's right,” Count Olaf said, “why doesn't everybody step forward and do a dance in honor of this darling little girl?”     “Sounds good to me,” Kevin said, leading his fellow employees onto the net. “After all, I have two equally strong feet.”     “And we should try to be accommodating,” the hook-handed man said. “Isn't that what you said, Uncle Bruce?”     “Absolutely,” Bruce agreed, with a puff on his cigar. He looked a bit relieved that all the arguing had ceased, and that the scouts finally had an opportunity to do the same thing they did every year. “Come on, Snow Scouts, let's recite the Snow Scout Alphabet Pledge as we dance around the Springpole.”     The scouts cheered and followed Bruce onto the net. “Snow Scouts,” the Snow Scouts said, “are accommodating, basic, calm, darling, emblematic, frisky, grinning, human, innocent, jumping, kept, limited, meek, nap-loving, official, pretty, quarantined, recent, scheduled, tidy, understandable, victorious, wholesome, xylophone, young, and zippered, every morning, every afternoon, every night, and all day long!”     There is nothing wrong, of course, with having a pledge, and putting into words what you might feel is important in your life as a reminder to yourself as you make your way in the world. If you feel, for instance, that well-read people are less likely to be evil, and a world full of people sitting quietly with good books in their hands is preferable to a world filled with schisms and sirens and other noisy and troublesome things, then every time you enter a library you might say to yourself, “The world is quiet here,” as a sort of pledge proclaiming reading to be the greater good. If you feel that well-read people ought to be lit on fire and their fortunes stolen, you might adopt the saying “Fight fire with fire!” as your pledge, whenever you ordered one of your comrades around. But whatever words you might choose to describe your own life, there are two basic guidelines for composing a good pledge. One guideline is that the pledge make good sense, so that if your pledge contains the word “xylophone,” for example, you mean that a percussion instrument played with mallets is very important to you, and not that you simply couldn't think of a good word that begins with the letter X. The other guideline is that the pledge be relatively short, so if a group of villains is luring you into a trap with a net and a group of exhausted trained eagles, you'll have more time to escape.     The Snow Scout Alphabet Pledge, sadly, did not follow either of these guidelines. As the Snow Scouts promised to be “xylophone,” the man with a beard but no hair cracked his whip in the air, and the eagles sitting on both villains' shoulders began to flap their wings and, digging their claws into the thick pads, lifted the two sinister people high in the air, and when the pledge neared its end, and the Snow Scouts were all taking a big breath to make the snowy sound, the woman with hair but no beard blew her whistle, making a loud shriek the Baudelaires remembered from running laps as part of Olaf's scheme at Prufrock Prep. The three siblings stood with Quigley and watched as the rest of the eagles quickly dove to the ground, picked up the net, and, their wings trembling with the effort, lifted everyone who was standing on it into the air, the way you might remove all the dinner dishes from the table by lifting all the corners of the tablecloth. If you were to try such an unusual method of clearing the table, you would likely be sent to your room or chased out of the restaurant, and the results on Mount Fraught were equally disastrous. In moments, all of the Snow Scouts and Olaf's henchfolk were in an aerial heap, struggling together inside the net that the eagles were holding. The only person who escaped recruitment — besides the Baudelaires and Quigley Quagmire, of course — was Carmelita Spats, standing next to Count Olaf and his girlfriend.     “What's going on?” Bruce asked Count Olaf from inside the net. “What have you done?”     “I've triumphed,” Count Olaf said, “again. A long time ago, I tricked you out of a reptile collection that I needed for my own use.” The Baudelaires looked at one another in astonishment, suddenly realizing when they had met Bruce before. “And now, I've tricked you out of a collection of children!”     “What's going to happen to us?” asked one of the Snow Scouts fearfully.     “I don't care,” said another Snow Scout, who seemed to be afflicted with Stockholm Syndrome already. “Every year we hike up to Mount Fraught and do the same thing. At least this year is a little different!”     “Why are you recruiting me, too?” asked the hook-handed man, and the Baudelaires could see one of his hooks frantically sticking out of the net. “I already work for you.”     “Don't worry, hooky,” Esmé replied mockingly. “It's all for the greater good!”     “Mush!” cried the man with a beard but no hair, cracking his whip in the air. Squawking in fear, the eagles began to drag the net across the sky, away from Mount Fraught .     “You get the sugar bowl from those bratty orphans, Olaf,” ordered the woman with hair but no beard, “and we'll all meet up at the last safe place!”     “With these eagles at our disposal,” the sinister man said in his hoarse voice, “we can finally catch up to that self-sustaining hot air mobile home and destroy those volunteers!”     The Baudelaires gasped, and shared an astonished look with Quigley. The villain was surely talking about the device that Hector had built at the Village of Fowl Devotees, in which Duncan and Isadora had escaped.     “We'll fight fire with fire!” the woman with hair but no beard cried in triumph, and the eagles carried her away. Count Olaf muttered something to himself and then turned and began creeping toward the Baudelaires. “I only need one of you to learn where the sugar bowl is,” he said, his eyes shining brightly, “and to get my hands on the fortune. But which one should it be?”     “That's a difficult decision,” Esmé said. “On one hand, it's been enjoyable having an infant servant. But it would be a lot of fun to smash Klaus's glasses and watch him bump into things.”     “But Violet has the longest hair,” Carmelita volunteered, as the Baudelaires backed toward the cracked waterfall with Quigley right behind them. “You could yank on it all the time, and tie it to things when you were bored.”     “Those are both excellent ideas,” Count Olaf said. “I'd forgotten what an adorable little girl you are. Why don't you join us?”     “Join you?” Carmelita asked.     “Look at my stylish dress,” Esmé said to Carmelita. “If you joined us, I'd buy you all sorts of in outfits.”     Carmelita looked thoughtful, gazing first at the children, and then at the two villains standing next to her and smiling. The three Baudelaires shared a look of horrified disappointment with Quigley. The siblings remembered how monstrous Carmelita had been at school, but it had never occurred to them that she would be interested in joining up with even more monstrous people.     “Don't believe them, Carmelita,” Quigley said, and took his purple notebook out of his pocket. “They'll burn your parents' house down. I have the evidence right here, in my commonplace book.”     “What are you going to believe, Carmelita?” Count Olaf asked. “A silly book, or something an adult tells you?”     “Look at us, you adorable little girl,” Esmé said, her yellow, orange, and red dress crackling on the ground. “Do we look like the sort of people who like to burn down houses?”     “Carmelita!” Violet cried. “Don't listen to them!”     “Carmelita!” Klaus cried. “Don't join them!”     “Carmelita!” Sunny cried, which meant something like, “You're making a monstrous decision!”     “Carmelita,” Count Olaf said, in a sickeningly sweet voice. “Why don't you choose one orphan to live, and push the others off the cliff, and then we'll all go to a nice hotel together.”     “You'll be like the daughter we never had,” Esmé said, stroking her tiara.     “Or something,” added Olaf, who looked like he would prefer having another employee rather than a daughter.     Carmelita glanced once more at the Baudelaires, and then smiled up at the two villains. “Do you really think I'm adorable?” she asked.     “I think you're adorable, beautiful, cute, dainty, eye-pleasing, flawless, gorgeous, harmonious, impeccable, jaw-droppingly adorable, keen, luscious, magnificent, nifty, obviously adorable, photogenic, quite adorable, ravishing, splendid, thin, undeformed, very adorable, well-proportioned, xylophone, yummy, and zestfully adorable,” Esmé pledged, “every morning, every afternoon, every night, and all day long!”     “Don't listen to her!” Quigley pleaded. “A person can't be 'xylophone'!”     “I don't care!” Carmelita said. “I'm going to push these cakesniffers off the mountain, and start an exciting and fashionable new life!”     The Baudelaires took another step back, and Quigley followed, giving the children a panicked look. Above them they could hear the squawking of the eagles as they took the villains' new recruits farther and farther away. Behind them they could feel the four drafts of the valley below, where the headquarters had been destroyed by people the children's parents had devoted their lives to stopping. Violet reached in her pocket for her ribbon, trying to imagine what she could invent that could get them away from such villainous people, and journeying toward their fellow volunteers at the last safe place. Her fingers brushed against the bread knife, and she wondered if she should remove the weapon from her pocket and use it to threaten the villains with violence, or hether this, too, would make her as villainous as the man who was staring at her now.     “Poor Baudelaires,” Count Olaf said mockingly. “You might as well give up. You're hopelessly outnumbered.”     “We're not outnumbered at all,” Klaus said. “There are four of us, and only three of you.”     “I count triple because I'm the False Spring Queen,” Carmelita said, “so you are outnumbered, cakesniffers.”     This, of course, was more utter nonsense from the mouth of this cruel girl, but even if it weren't nonsense, it does not always matter if one is outnumbered or not. When Violet and Klaus were hiking toward the Valley of Four Drafts, for instance, they were outnumbered by the swarm of snow gnats, but they managed to find Quigley Quagmire, climb up the Vertical Flame Diversion to the headquarters, and find the message hidden in the refrigerator. Sunny had been outnumbered by all of the villains on top of Mount Fraught , and had still managed to survive the experience, discover the location of the last safe place, and concoct a few recipes that were as easy as they were delicious. And the members of V.F.D. have always been outnumbered, because the number of greedy and wicked people always seems to be increasing, while more and more libraries go up in smoke, but the volunteers have managed to endure, a word which here means “meet in secret, communicate in code, and gather crucial evidence to foil the schemes of their enemies.” It does not always matter whether there are more people on your side of the schism than there are on the opposite side, and as the Baudelaires stood with Quigley and took one more step back, they knew what was more important.     “Rosebud!'' Sunny cried, which meant ”In some situations, the location of a certain object can be much more important than being outnumbered,"" and it was true. As the villains gasped in astonishment, Violet sat down in the toboggan, grabbing the leather straps. Quigley sat down behind her and put his arms around her waist, and Klaus sat down next, and put his arms around Quigley's, and there was just enough room in back for a young girl, so Sunny sat behind her brother and hung on tight as Violet pushed off from the peak of Mount Fraught and sent the four children hurtling down the slope. It did not matter that they were outnumbered. It only mattered that they could escape from a monstrous end by racing down the last of the slippery slope, just as it only matters for you to escape from a monstrous end by putting down the last of The Slippery Slope, and reading a book in which villains do not roar at children who are trying to escape."|"The Slippery Slope"|"Lemony Snicket"
