12:00|midday|"Liss was clearly happier to be sent off to the stables to select the most suitable riding horse and baggage mule. One baggage mule. By midday Ista’s feverish single-mindedness resulted in both women dressed for the road, the horses saddled, and the mule packed. The dy Gura brothers found them standing in the cobbled courtyard when they rode through the castle gate heading ten mounted men in the garb of the Daughter’s Order, dy Cabon following on his white mule."|"Paladin of Souls"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
12:00|noon|"She crossed a paved castle courtyard in a late-spring or early-summer noon. A stone-arched walk ran around the court’s edge, the fine alabaster pillars carved with a tracery of vines and flowers in the Roknari style. The sun shone down high and hot; the shadows were black accent marks at her feet. She climbed—no, floated—up the stone stairs at the end, leading up over the arched walk to a wooden gallery, and along it. At the far end, a room: she passed softly into it without opening the carved door, which seemed to part and close around her skin like water."|"Paladin of Souls"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"Learned dy Cabon emerged from his room around noon, his face the color of dough. Ista took one look at him, canceled the day’s travel plans, and sent him back to bed. He crept away mumbling pitifully grateful thanks. She was relieved to see he was not feverish. Foix’s diagnosis of wine-sickness seemed sound, confirmed when the divine slunk out again, shamefaced, in the evening and took a supper of toast and tea, turning down with loathing an offer of watered wine."|"Paladin of Souls"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
12:00|noon|"Lord dy Cazaril claimed that the world of the spirit and the world of matter existed side by side, like two sides of a coin, or a wall; the gods were not far away in some other space, but in this very one, continuously, just around some strange corner of perception. A presence as pervasive and invisible as sunlight on skin, as though one stood naked and blindfolded in an unimaginable noon."|"Paladin of Souls"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
"< 12:00"|"toward noon"|"Ferda wheeled his horse and squinted in the bright light; the sun was growing hotter, climbing toward noon. “Men on horses.” His expression grew grim. “Armed—I see chain mail—spears. Their armor is in the Roknari style . . . Bastard’s dem—five gods! Those are the tabards of the princedom of Jokona. I can see the white birds on the green even from here.”"|"Paladin of Souls"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
00:00|midnight|"The Jokonan commander had every reason, internal and external, to push on as quickly as possible, and Ista was not surprised when she was wakened at midnight and lashed to a horse again. This time, however, she was moved up from the baggage train and put in hand of the Ibran-speaking officer himself. Two other riders flanked them closely. The column moved off in the darkness, stumbling and cursing."|"Paladin of Souls"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
00:00|midnight|"Ista flexed her hands. She hardly dared touch her darkly lacerated wrists, crusted, bleeding, and abraded. “And I mine, but I have been tied to this fool of a horse since midnight last night. Without rest or food or water, which first seemed cruel but now seems kind. If you would cap your morning’s heroism, do me the kindness of guarding this animal and my modesty while I find a bush.” She glanced doubtfully up the ravine. “Or a rock, or whatever. Although I doubt my horse has any more desire to go another step than I do.”"|"Paladin of Souls"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
12:00|noon|"He smiled at that, but said only, “I have little need of sleep, these days. I’ll take some rest at noon.”"|"Paladin of Souls"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
12:00|noon|"He chuckled. “None shall ask it of you, then. We’ll rest a space at noon, and come to Porifors in time for a rather better dinner than I could offer you last night.”"|"Paladin of Souls"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
12:00|noon|"Neither hot noon nor chill half-moon midnight, but still the same court as in Ista’s dreams, every detail identical, unmistakable, engraved on her memory as if with chisel and awl. Ista felt faint. She could not decide if she felt surprised."|"Paladin of Souls"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
00:00|midnight|"Neither hot noon nor chill half-moon midnight, but still the same court as in Ista’s dreams, every detail identical, unmistakable, engraved on her memory as if with chisel and awl. Ista felt faint. She could not decide if she felt surprised."|"Paladin of Souls"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
"< 00:00"|"toward midnight"|"It was drawing toward midnight, she guessed; the fortress had fallen silent. In the distance, filtering through her window lattices, the faint sawing of insects grated. A night bird warbled a low, liquid note. A little dull moonlight seeped in, rendering the room not quite pitch-black."|"Paladin of Souls"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
00:00|midnight|"So, she oversaw the sick man’s care. Not beneath a chatelaine’s duties, for a man so highborn, an officer so essential, a relative so close and, apparently, esteemed by her husband. Perhaps Lord Illvin was due some midnight medication, some hopeful treatment that the physicians had ordered. There were a dozen possible mundane, harmless explanations."|"Paladin of Souls"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
00:00|midnight|"FOR A WOMAN WHO HAD STILL BEEN FLITTING AROUND THE CASTLE secretly at midnight, Lady Cattilara appeared at Ista’s chambers much too soon after dawn, bursting with cheerful hospitality and the plan of dragging Ista to the temple in the village for morning prayers of thanksgiving. With an effort, Ista suppressed the twinging tension the young marchess’s presence induced in her. When Ista arrived in the flower-decked entry court to discover Pejar holding a horse for her, it was too late to beg off. Muscles still sore, feeling altogether decrepit, in anything but a thankful mood, she let herself be loaded aboard. Pejar led her mount at a decorous pace. Lady Cattilara walked ahead in the procession, head high, arms swinging freely, and had breath to spare to sing a hymn with her ladies as they descended the treacherous twisting path."|"Paladin of Souls"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
00:00|midnight|"She glanced around the court. Neither midnight nor noon, now; no details matched her dreams. Her dream had held neither Goram nor Liss, the time of day was all wrong . . . maybe it was safe, benign. She drew a breath."|"Paladin of Souls"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
12:00|noon|"She glanced around the court. Neither midnight nor noon, now; no details matched her dreams. Her dream had held neither Goram nor Liss, the time of day was all wrong . . . maybe it was safe, benign. She drew a breath."|"Paladin of Souls"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"“Eh, Lady Catti,” said Goram, and sniffed. Ista wasn’t certain if he was making a comment or just clearing his nose. “But he don’t stay awake, see. He comes up most every day for a while, around noon. We mainly try to get as much food into him as we can, while he can swallow without choking. He don’t get enough. He’s wasting away, you can see it. Lady Catti, she came up with a smart idea to put goat’s milk down his throat with a little leather tube, and you can see that it helps, but not enough. He’s too thin now. Every day, his grip is less strong.”"|"Paladin of Souls"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
"< 00:00"|"Near midnight"|"IF ANY GOD DABBLED IN HER DREAMS, ISTA DID NOT REMEMBER IT when her eyes opened in the night. But regardless of the phantasms that troubled the mind, the body still had to piss. She sighed, poked her feet out of bed, and went to open the heavy wooden shutter to let in a little light. Near midnight, she guessed, by the misshapen moon’s silver sheen. Well past the full, now, but the night was chill and clear. She rummaged under the bed for her chamber pot."|"Paladin of Souls"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
12:00|noontime|"Ista blinked, as a solution to the knotty problem of having Cattilara—and her demon—underfoot at Illvin’s noontime awakening occurred to her. An ugly ploy, but effective. She added smoothly, “For myself, the last thing I tried before I became pregnant with Teidez was the poultice of finger-lily flowers. That remedy was the contribution of Lady dy Vara’s old nurse, as I recall. Lady dy Vara swore by it. She’d had six children by then.”"|"Paladin of Souls"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
12:00|"high noon"|"“I don’t know. I thought I saw some growing near the meadow where Lord Arhys had his camp, the other day. Liss would recognize the plant, I’m sure.” Behind Cattilara’s shoulder, Liss’s brows flew up in protest; Ista raised two fingers to command her silence. Ista went on, “The old nurse had it that they must be gathered by the supplicant herself, barefoot, at high noon when the sun is most fecund. Cut with a silver knife while praying to the Mother, the petals wrapped in a band of cheesecloth—or silk, for a lady—and worn about the waist until she next lies with her husband.”"|"Paladin of Souls"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
12:00|noon|"“Royina . . . since there is to be no ladies’ fête this noon . . . might I borrow your handmaiden Liss to assist me in locating some of these wonderful blooms?”"|"Paladin of Souls"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
12:00|noon|"“Actually, it’s a short green shoot that has little flowers dangling in a row, called Mother’s bells, but it hardly matters. What I wish of you is that you get the marchess as far away from Porifors as you can persuade her to ride by noon. Let her pick any flower that isn’t poisonous.” Now, there was another temptation . . . Ista recalled childhood encounters with blister-ivy and stinging nettle, and smiled grimly. But whatever was going on with Cattilara was deathly serious, and no pretext for japery, no matter how the girl set Ista’s teeth on edge. “Mark if she becomes suddenly anxious to return, or otherwise behaves or speaks oddly. Delay her as long as you reasonably may, however you can.”"|"Paladin of Souls"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
12:00|NOON|"AT LENGTH, A PAGE APPEARED TO COLLECT LISS FOR HER NOON EXPEDITION with the marchess. Sometime after that, a maid arrived with a luncheon for Ista on a tray, accompanied by a gentlewoman of the marchess’s retinue evidently detailed to keep Ista company. Ista bade the maid set the tray on the table and leave her, and ruthlessly dismissed the disappointed lady-in-waiting as well. As soon as their footsteps had faded outside, Ista slipped through the outer chamber and out the door. The sun, she noted grimly, shone down high and hot into the stone court, making black accent marks of the shadows. At the opposite end of the gallery, she knocked on Lord Illvin’s carved door."|"Paladin of Souls"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
00:00|midnight|"An exotic woman, a virile man, a midnight visit, a spurned suitor . . . the roles the same, but the actors altered from Cattilara’s version? Not Pechma but Illvin, the murderous intruder on some intimate scene? It hung together; it was not hard to imagine that Umerue, sent to woo Illvin for the sake of some alliance with Jokona, might for either personal or political reasons switch targets to his elder and more powerful brother. Cattilara was an impediment to such a design, true, but she was just the sort of bump in the road that subtle poisons were designed to smooth away."|"Paladin of Souls"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
12:00|noon|"“Yes, he does. Each noon, when you have your little nap. Your only sleep of the day. Has your wife not told you this? She goes almost every day to oversee his care.” And sometimes at night, as well. Although it’s not exactly his care that concerns her then, I expect."|"Paladin of Souls"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
12:00|noon|"Ista’s dreams were untroubled that night by gods or visions, although made unpleasant enough by murky, erratic nightmares involving either disastrous travel on broken-down or dying horses, or confused wandering through crumbling, architecturally bizarre castles for the repair of which she was somehow responsible. She woke poorly rested, and waited impatiently for noon."|"Paladin of Souls"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
12:00|noon|"“Yes, Goram, I know. It’s all right,” Ista soothed him. “You’re doing well.” Almost, she was tempted to squeeze the rope of white fire shut again, returning the ugly gash to its rightful owner. But now was clearly not a good moment to drop Arhys senseless from his saddle. Illvin’s closed gray eyelids did not move or flutter or pinch in pain, at least. In his unfeeling state he might be freely tended, washed with brine, jabbed with sewing needles. So, Ista wondered dizzily, if the demon permitted him to wake this noon, would the needle punctures still be there when the wound they held closed fled back to his brother?"|"Paladin of Souls"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
12:00|noon|"Cattilara’s sigh of relief was premature, in Ista’s judgment. The girl had not yet thought it through. But she likely would. “Lord Arhys will return by noon—no doubt.”"|"Paladin of Souls"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
12:00|midday|"The meal tray arrived. Lord Arhys excused himself; Ista trusted he would find the safe harbor of his bed before his midday collapse overtook him. She ushered her own people out again, to give Goram time to do his necessary work, but she directed dy Cabon to stay, assist, and observe."|"Paladin of Souls"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
"~ 00:00"|"around midnight"|"“I last saw Arhys last night. He came to speak with me down in the courtyard, around midnight. Liss was there.”"|"Paladin of Souls"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
12:00|noon|"The wagon bumped and rocked, marking a turn off the road. Ista peeked out to discover that they had returned to the walled village, and were stopping in the olive grove again to water the horses. The sun had climbed to noon, and the day was growing very hot."|"Paladin of Souls"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
00:00|midnight|"Her inner vision revealed a soul the like of which Ista had never seen before. It roiled and boiled with violent colors in the confines of the woman’s body, but darkened toward the center, till Ista seemed to be looking down a black well at midnight. Black, yet not empty. Faint colored lines radiated out from the bottomless pit in all directions, a tangled web that writhed and pulsed and knotted. Ista had to forcibly blink away the overpowering second sight in order to take in the surface of the woman."|"Paladin of Souls"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
12:00|noon|"A young officer on a nervously capering horse rode near; he pulled it to a halt and swung down beside the woman, abandoning his reins, which were snatched up at once by a soldier hurrying to assist him. The officer stared at Ista as if transfixed. His high rank was signaled more by the gold and jewels decorating his horse’s gear than by elaborations on his own clothing, but he bore a gold-trimmed green sash across his chest decorated with a string of flying white pelicans. High cheekbones graced a handsome, sensitive face, and the hair braided tightly to his scalp was bright crinkled gold in the blazing noon. His soul . . . was lost in an intense violet haze that extended to the margins of his body."|"Paladin of Souls"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
00:00|MIDNIGHT|"IT WAS CLOSE TO MIDNIGHT BEFORE LORD ARHYS WENT TO REST in his chambers, so that Cattilara, on the other side of the door, might be roused to eat. His page removed his boots, but no more, and settled by the foot of the bed to guard his repose. Ista thought the exhausted boy would be asleep on the floor before five minutes had passed. Arhys lay back on his bed, eyes wide and dark in the light of the room’s sole candle."|"Paladin of Souls"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
12:00|noon|"Lord Illvin was leaning against the wall outside, arms folded. It seemed he had also found half a cup of water to bathe in, for though he still reeked more than slightly, his hands and fresh-shaved face were clean of blood and dirt. He was dressed in the colors of court mourning, in the light fabrics of this northern summer: black boots, black linen trousers, a sleeveless black tunic set off with thin lines of lavender piping, a lilac brocade sash with black tassels wrapped about his waist. In the hot noon, he had dispensed with the weight of the lavender vest-cloak, though an anxious Goram hovered with the garment folded over his arm. Goram had arranged his master’s hair in the pulled-back, elegant braiding in which Ista had first seen it; the frosted black queue down the back was tied with a lavender cord. Illvin straightened as he saw her and gave her a sketch of a courtier’s bow, truncated, she suspected, by bloodless dizziness."|"Paladin of Souls"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
12:00|noon|"Ista was barely conscious of the brass-bright noon through which she stumbled. She groped inside her mind, within an echoing darkness. Called silent curses to the Bastard. Then, silent prayers. Nothing came back."|"Paladin of Souls"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
12:00|noon|"Ista was laid down in a tent under a guard of ladies, but rose again to peek out, despite her nightgown, at the sound of many horses thundering out of the camp. It was only late afternoon; on this long summer day Oby’s cavalry would be descending on Porifors with hours of light still left for their work. The timing, Ista thought, was excellent. Maximum confusion, disorder, and dismay would have spread through the Jokonan forces from the dire events of noon, and the chances that competent leadership had yet reemerged—especially from the habits of sullen mindless obedience extracted by Joen—were slight."|"Paladin of Souls"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
12:00|noon|"“We’ve had no more deaths since yesterday noon, five gods be thanked.” He signed himself in heartfelt gratitude. “A few are even back on their feet, though I judge the rest will be as long recovering as from less uncanny illnesses. Most have been moved down to town, into the care of the temple or their relatives.”"|"Paladin of Souls"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
