00:00|MIDNIGHT|"
IT WAS MIDNIGHT in Ankh-Morpork’s Royal Art Museum.*
It occurred to new employee Rudolph Scattering about once every minute that on the whole it might have been a good idea to tell the Curator about his nyctophobia, his fear of strange noises and, he now knew, his fear of absolutely every thing he could see (and, come to that, not see), hear, smell and feel crawling up his back during the endless hours on guard during the night. It was no use telling himself that everything in here was dead. That didn’t help at all. It meant that he stood out."|"Unseen Academicals"|"Terry Pratchett"
02:00|"two o’clock in the morning"|"Now it was two o’clock in the morning. A cloying silence reigned along the ancient corridors and cloisters of Unseen University. There was silence in the Library; there was silence in the halls. There was so much silence you could hear it. Everywhere it went, it stuffed the ears with invisible fluff."|"Unseen Academicals"|"Terry Pratchett"
03:00|"3 a.m."|"The faculty was crestfallen, but it brightened up considerably as the caravan of trolleys wound its way into the room. There was nothing like a 3 a.m. snack to raise the spirits, everyone knew that."|"Unseen Academicals"|"Terry Pratchett"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"‘Went to the football, didn’t I. You know, we were playing those buggers in Dimwell.’
‘Until three in the morning?’
‘That’s the rules, innit? Play until full time, first dead man or first score.’"|"Unseen Academicals"|"Terry Pratchett"
"~ 12:00"|"around midday"|"‘Glenda will come in around midday. To be honest, she hardly ever leaves the place. I would like you to go and ask her the name of that girl who was up there tonight.’"|"Unseen Academicals"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"‘Well, that is very kind of you, but I—’
‘Tell you what, I’ll pick you up down ’ere at one o’clock.’
‘But people will look at me!’ said Nutt. And in his head he could hear Ladyship’s voice, calm and cool as ever: Do not stand out. Be part of the crowd."|"Unseen Academicals"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 08:30"|"half past eight"|"At half past eight, a neighbour woke her up by throwing gravel at her window. He wanted her to come and look at his father, described as ‘poorly’, and the day began. She had never needed to buy an alarm clock."|"Unseen Academicals"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 05:16"|"Five Hours and Sixteen Minutes"|"‘Strange you should ask,’ she told him. ‘Our catalogue says we’ve got one of the very few copies of J. P. Bunderbell’s Five Hours and Sixteen Minutes Among the Goblins of Far Uberwald, but I can’t find it anywhere. It’s priceless.’"|"Unseen Academicals"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 05:16"|"Five hours and sixteen minutes"|"‘Five hours and sixteen minutes doesn’t sound very long,’ said the smith."|"Unseen Academicals"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"A small set of stone steps led up to the little door. Hardly anyone used it these days. The other girls wouldn’t go in there. But Glenda would. Even after the very first time that she had, in response to the bell, delivered the midnight banana, or rather had failed to deliver it on account of running away screaming, she knew she’d have to face it again. After all, we can’t help how we’re made, her mother had said, and nor can we help what a magical accident might turn us into through no fault of our own, as Mrs Whitlow had explained slightly more recently, when the screaming had stopped. And so Glenda had picked up the banana and had headed right back there."|"Unseen Academicals"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"‘Not that I can see. He writes that “I would greatly appreciate your company at a dinner I am proposing to hold at Unseen University at eight o’clock Wednesday evening to discuss the future of the famous game foot-the-ball. I will be pleased to welcome you as the captain of the Dolly Sisters team.”’"|"Unseen Academicals"|"Terry Pratchett"
"~ 00:00"|"about midnight"|"Round about midnight, Glenda decided it was safe enough to leave the boys alone to get up to whatever it was boys got up to when women weren’t around to look after them, and made sure that she and Juliet were on the late cross-town bus. That meant she actually got to sleep in her own bed."|"Unseen Academicals"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 02:00"|"Two o’clock"|"Two o’clock, thought Glenda. Suppose I could manage it…‘All right, meet at work at half past one, do you hear? Not a minute later! I’ve got things to do.’"|"Unseen Academicals"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 01:30"|"half past one"|"Two o’clock, thought Glenda. Suppose I could manage it…‘All right, meet at work at half past one, do you hear? Not a minute later! I’ve got things to do.’"|"Unseen Academicals"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 11:30"|"half past eleven"|"The University Council meets every day at half past eleven, she thought to herself. Oh, to be a fly on that wall. She grinned…"|"Unseen Academicals"|"Terry Pratchett"
"< 12:00"|"nearly noon"|"‘Well said,’ said Ridcully gleefully. ‘You can’t go around asking craftsmen the secrets of their trade, old chap. It’s a thing you just don’t do. Now, I am concluding this meeting, although what it has in fact concluded I shall decide later.’ He turned back to Glenda. ‘Thank you for coming here today, Miss Glenda, and I shall not enquire why a young lady who works in the Night Kitchen is pouring tea up here at nearly noon. Do you have any further advice for us?’"|"Unseen Academicals"|"Terry Pratchett"
14:14|"14.14 hours"|"‘I thought that anything taken out of the Cabinet had to be returned in 14.14 hours recurring?’"|"Unseen Academicals"|"Terry Pratchett"
14:14|"14.14 hours"|"‘Actually, we know very little for certain,’ said Ponder. ‘What we do know is that it will hold nothing too large to fit inside a cube measuring 14.14 inches recurring on a side, that it will cease working if, we now know, a non-organic object is not replaced in it in 14.14 hours recurring, and that none of its contents are pink, although we do not know why this should be.’"|"Unseen Academicals"|"Terry Pratchett"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"The thing had always worried Ridcully. It looked too smug, for a start. It seemed to be saying: You don’t know what you are doing. You use me as a kind of lucky dip and I bet you have never thought of how many dangerous things can fit into a fourteen-inch cube. In fact, Ridcully had thought about that, often at three in the morning, and never went into the room without a couple of sub-critical spells in his pocket just in case. And then there was Nutt…Well, hope for the best and prepare for the worst, that was the UU way."|"Unseen Academicals"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"‘That’s us, gentlemen. And we’ll take on the first team that joins us on the Hippo on Saturday at one o’clock. We’ll be training all around the city. You can join in if you like. And don’t worry if you don’t have the balls! We’ll give you some!’ The candle flames went out, which was just as well because it is hard to riot in the dark. When the flames rose again in their eerie way, shouting, arguments, laughter and even discussion were taking place on every table. Quietly, too, the servants went to and fro with their flagons. There always seemed to be another one, Glenda noticed."|"Unseen Academicals"|"Terry Pratchett"
04:30|"half past four this morning"|"‘Quite so. It is your job to point this out, and I respect that. But I did not return until half past four this morning and I distinctly remember stubbing my toe on the stairs. I am as drunk as a skunk, Drumknott, which of course means skunks are just as drunk as I. I must say the term is unfamiliar to me, and I had not thought hitherto of skunks in this context, but Mustrum Ridcully was kind enough to enlighten me. Allow me, then, a moment of indulgence.’"|"Unseen Academicals"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"‘No. Me and the horses are stopping here and will go back in the morning.’ He gave her the wry look of a man who’s heard a great many things, and surprisingly seen a great many things, when to those behind him he was just a head facing forward keeping an eye on the road. ‘That was a wonderful kiss she give me. I’ll tell you what, the bus will be in the yard, there’s plenty of straw around and if anyone was to have a bit of a kip, I wouldn’t know about it, would I? We’ll leave at six with fresh horses.’ He grinned at her expression. ‘I told you, we get all sorts on the late-night bus: kids running away from home, wives running away from husbands, husbands running away from other wives’ husbands. It’s called an omnibus, see, and omni means everything and damn near everything happens on this bus, that’s why I have the axe, see? But the way I see it, life can’t be all axe.’ He raised his voice: ‘Sto Lat coming up, folks! Return trip six o’clock prompt.’ He winked at Glenda. ‘And if you’re not there, I’ll go withoutcha,’ he said. ‘You’ve got to catch the bus at bus-catching time.’"|"Unseen Academicals"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"‘Not exactly,’ said Ponder. ‘The editor of the Times came round, in person, and was knocking on the door to see the Archchancellor at midnight. He wanted to know all about you.’ This was said directly to Nutt."|"Unseen Academicals"|"Terry Pratchett"
"~ 00:00"|"about midnight"|"‘You promised your old mum?’ said Pepe. There wasn’t even any attempt to hide the disdain. ‘And you think that makes any difference, do you? You’ve got a star in your hand, lad. You’ll play, all right, so I’ll tell you what I’ll do. You come along and see me round the back entrance of Shatta, sorry about that, it sounds better in Dwarfish, and kick on the door round about midnight. You can bring a chum with you if you like, but you better bloody well come.’"|"Unseen Academicals"|"Terry Pratchett"
02:00|"two o’clock in the morning"|"‘An early night for wizards is two o’clock in the morning,’ said Glenda."|"Unseen Academicals"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"‘Now, I don’t want any sneaking off for midnight snacks,’ said Ridcully. ‘There are rules. Mrs Whitlow and Miss Sugarbean have been told that I fully back Mister Nutt’s authority here. Surely you gentlemen could show some backbone?’"|"Unseen Academicals"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"‘Thought not. I want two bottles of best brandy. And, er, could you all come with me, please? I think Pepe means well, but he, er, well, you know him, it’s midnight and everythin’.’"|"Unseen Academicals"|"Terry Pratchett"
