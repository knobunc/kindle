Chapman offered Keats a masculine poetry opposed to the indulgent softness of Hunt’s work. Cowden Clarke, p. 130, recalled introducing Keats to Chapman – ‘One scene I could not fail to introduce to him – the shipwreck of Ulysses, in the fifth book of the Odysseis, and I had the reward of one of his delighted stares upon reading the following lines: “Then forth he came, his both knees falt’ring, both / His strong hands hanging down, and all with froth / His cheeks and nostrils flowing, voice and breath / Spent to all use, and down he sank to death. / The sea had soak’d his heart through.…” ’ Clarke says that Keats departed ‘at day-spring, yet he contrived that I should receive the poem from a distance of, may be, two miles by ten o’clock’. For discussion of the poem’s sources and structure see Murry (1930), pp. 15–33, and B.

I th[i]nk it will give you the sensation of walking about an old county Town in a coolish evening. I know not yet whether I shall ever finish it….’ (L II, p. 201). At the time of its composition, Keats was confined to his rooms with a sore throat, and the subject, like that of its companion-piece The Eve of St Agnes, was probably suggested by Mrs Isabella Jones. The superstition is recounted in John Brand’s Popular Antiquities (1813 edn) II, p. 166: ‘It is customary in Yorkshire, as a clergyman of that county informed me, for the common people to sit and watch in the church porch on St Mark’s Eve [24 April], from eleven o’clock at night till one in the morning. The third year (for this must be done thrice), they are supposed to see the ghosts of all those who are to die next year, pass by into the church. When any one sickens that is thought to have been seen in this manner, it is presently whispered about that he will not recover, for that such, or such an one, who has watched St Mark’s Eve, says so. This superstition is in such force, that, if the patients themselves hear of it, they almost despair of recovery.

Really, without joking, chaste weather – Dian skies – I never lik’d stubble fields so much as now – Aye better than the chilly green of the spring. Somehow a stubble plain looks warm – in the same way that some pictures look warm – this struck me so much in my sunday’s walk that I composed upon it…. I somehow always associate Chatterton with autumn. He is the purest writer in the English Language’ (L II, p. 167). Gittings (1954), p. 187, has pointed out the echoes of Chatterton’s Aella, though there are also echoes of Wordsworth, and Coleridge’s Frost at Midnight (1798), 65–75. Keats’s probable debt to paintings is discussed by Jack, pp. 232–43. The stanza structure is closely related to that of the odes of April and May, but extended to eleven lines and including a couplet (first stanza: a b a b c d e d c c e; the other two: a b a b c d e c d d e). ‘The effect of the couplet, placed thus, is to sustain the approaching close at a momentary crest before the stanza subsides in the final line’ (Bate [1963], p. 581n)."|"The Complete Poems"|"John Keats"
