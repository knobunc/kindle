12:00|midday|"We were starting to feel the effects of this transition, especially at school. My
            second-grade classroom turned out to be a mayhem of unruly kids and flying erasers,
            which had not been the norm in either my experience or Craig’s. All this seemed due
            to a teacher who couldn’t figure out how to assert control—who didn’t seem to like
            children, even. Beyond that, it wasn’t clear that anyone was particularly bothered
            by the fact that the teacher was incompetent. The students used it as an excuse to
            act out, and she seemed to think only the worst of us. In her eyes, we were a class
            of “bad kids,” though we had no guidance and no structure and had been sentenced to
            a grim, underlit room in the basement of the school. Every hour there felt hellish
            and long. I sat miserably at my desk, in my puke-green chair—puke green being the
            official color of the 1970s—learning nothing and waiting for the midday lunch break,
            when I could go home and have a sandwich and complain to my mom."|Becoming|"Michelle Obama"
00:00|midnight|"At Christmastime, she got especially creative. One year, she figured out how to cover
            our boxy metal radiator with corrugated cardboard printed to look like red bricks,
            stapling everything together so that we’d have a faux chimney that ran all the way
            to the ceiling and a faux fireplace, complete with a mantel and hearth. She then enlisted
            my father—the family’s resident artist—to paint a series of orange flames on pieces
            of very thin rice paper, which, when backlit with a lightbulb, made for a half-convincing
            fire. On New Year’s Eve, as a matter of tradition, she’d buy a special hors d’oeuvre
            basket, the kind that came filled with blocks of cheese, smoked oysters in a tin,
            and different kinds of salami. She’d invite my dad’s sister Francesca over to play
            board games. We’d order a pizza for dinner and then snack our way elegantly through
            the rest of the evening, my mom passing around trays of pigs in a blanket, fried shrimp,
            and a special cheese spread baked on Ritz crackers. As midnight drew close, we’d each
            have a tiny glass of champagne."|Becoming|"Michelle Obama"

            ninety minutes of nerve-pummeling travel on two different city bus routes as well
            as a transfer downtown. Hauling myself out of bed at five o’clock that morning, I’d
            put on all new clothes and a pair of nice earrings, unsure of how any of it would
            be received on the other end of my bus trek. I’d eaten breakfast, having no idea where
            lunch would be. I said good-bye to my parents, unclear on whether I’d even still be
            myself at the end of the day. High school was meant to be transformative. And Whitney

            some ownership of the space, we were now a glaring anomaly—poppy seeds in a bowl of
            rice. While Whitney Young had been somewhat diverse, I’d never been part of a predominantly
            white community before. I’d never stood out in a crowd or a classroom because of the

            found that the pace only quickened and the to-do lists only got longer, leaving me
            operating in what felt like a never-ending state of overdrive. Barack and I did all
            we could to keep the girls’ lives calm and manageable. We had a new babysitter helping

            friends and loading up her own little calendar with birthday parties and swim classes
            on weekends. Sasha was now about a year old, wobbling on two feet and beginning to
            say words and crack us up with her megawatt smiles. She was madly inquisitive and
            utterly bent on keeping up with Malia and her four-year-old buddies. My hospital job
            was going well, though the best way to stay on top of it, I was discovering, was to

            with a shiny shaved head and a perpetual five o’clock shadow—but the girls took to
            his corny jokes as quickly as they took to his cooking. He showed them how to chop
            carrots and blanch greens, shifting our family away from the fluorescent sameness
            of the grocery store and toward the rhythm of the seasons. He could be reverent about
            the arrival of fresh peas in springtime or the moment raspberries came ripe in June.
            He waited until peaches were rich and plump before serving them to the girls, knowing
            that then they might actually compete with candy. Sam also had an educated perspective
            on food and health issues, namely how the food industry marketed processed foods to
            families in the name of convenience and how that was having severe public health consequences.

            ordered to go with his eggs. About twenty-five members of the press traveled with

            and breakfast rooms of small-town hotels, trailing him from stop to stop, their pens

            If someone got an expensive haircut or asked for Dijon mustard at a TGI Fridays (as
            Barack had naively done years earlier, meriting an eventual headline in the New York Times), it would get reported and then parsed a hundred ways on the internet. Was the candidate

            get on the elevator and ride upstairs to have a family meal, even if he often had
            to go right back down to the Oval Office afterward. My mother sometimes joined us

            year in a speech televised live during prime time, delivered in the hall of the House
            of Representatives with Supreme Court justices, cabinet members, military generals,
            and members of Congress present. It’s also a tradition of high pageantry, in which
            lawmakers dramatically express their approval or disapproval of the president’s ideas
            by either leaping to their feet in repeat standing ovations or remaining seated and
            sullen."|Becoming|"Michelle Obama"

            It was during these quiet hours that he could find perspective or inhale new information,

"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"The last bit of work he did, usually at some hour past midnight, was to read letters
            from American citizens. Since the start of his presidency, Barack had asked his correspondence
            staff to include ten letters or messages from constituents inside his briefing book,
            selected from the roughly fifteen thousand letters and emails that poured in daily.
            He read each one carefully, jotting responses in the margins so that a staffer could
            prepare a reply or forward a concern on to a cabinet secretary. He read letters from
            soldiers. From prison inmates. From cancer patients struggling to pay health-care
            premiums and from people who’d lost their homes to foreclosure. From gay people who
            hoped to be able to legally marry and from Republicans who felt he was ruining the
            country. From moms, grandfathers, and young children. He read letters from people
            who appreciated what he did and from others who wanted to let him know he was an idiot."|Becoming|"Michelle Obama"

            Hadiya Pendleton was shot and killed in a public park in Chicago, not far from her
            school. She and a group of friends had been standing under a metal shelter next to
            a playground, waiting for a rainstorm to pass. They’d been mistaken for gang members,
            sprayed with bullets by an eighteen-year-old belonging to a different gang. Hadiya
            had been hit in the back as she tried to run for cover. Two of her friends were injured.

"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"Barack had stayed up most of the night tracking the data, and as had happened so many
            times before, he was called upon to step forward as a symbol of steadiness to help
            the nation process its shock. I didn’t envy him the task. He gave a morning pep talk
            to his staff in the Oval Office and then, around noon, delivered a set of sober but
            reassuring remarks to the nation from the Rose Garden, calling—as he always did—for
