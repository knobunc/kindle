Workers did not have fixed hours, and if there was a big order, they might work all night—another reason for not living next to a paper mill. In France a shift would begin at four a.m., and in Auvergne, between midnight and one a.m. Normally the mills were closed at night and a team of “apprentice papermakers,” otherwise known as children, who were small enough to crawl into the vats, scrubbed the hammers and the equipment clean. When they finished their work, according to historian Oriol Valls i Subirà, “They were quickly hauled out and rubbed dry with rough cloths. After receiving brisk spankings to take the numbness from their skin, they were given a large glass of wine and sent off to bed bundled in warm blankets.”"|Paper|"Mark Kurlansky"

12:00|noonday|"The Diamond Sutra is a popular example of Buddhist writing in which the Buddha lectures Subhuti, his aging disciple, on the nonexistence of everything. Repeatedly, the Buddha enjoins his student to make copies of this book and pass them around. Buddha says, “Whatever place constitutes a repository for this sacred scripture, there also the Lord Buddha may be found.” Copying the Diamond Sutra therefore became a way of “gaining merit.” In it, Buddha also says, “If a good disciple whether man or woman, in the morning, at noonday and at eventide, sacrificed, sacrificed lives innumerable as the sands in the Ganges, and thus without intermission throughout infinite ages; and if another disciple, hearing this scripture proclaimed, steadfastly believed it, his felicity would be appreciably greater than the other.”"|Paper|"Mark Kurlansky"
