13:00|1300|"By 1300, mechanical clocks were everywhere in Europe—on towers, in monasteries, on government buildings. There was a growing movement to set all clocks to the same time so that everyone would be synchronized. In the fourteenth century, King Charles of France built a clock on the Île de la Cité and ordered that all the clocks in Paris be set by it. To suddenly know exactly what time it was, was an enormous change in Europe."|Paper|"Mark Kurlansky"

Workers did not have fixed hours, and if there was a big order, they might work all night—another reason for not living next to a paper mill. In France a shift would begin at four a.m., and in Auvergne, between midnight and one a.m. Normally the mills were closed at night and a team of “apprentice papermakers,” otherwise known as children, who were small enough to crawl into the vats, scrubbed the hammers and the equipment clean. When they finished their work, according to historian Oriol Valls i Subirà, “They were quickly hauled out and rubbed dry with rough cloths. After receiving brisk spankings to take the numbness from their skin, they were given a large glass of wine and sent off to bed bundled in warm blankets.”"|Paper|"Mark Kurlansky"

12:00|noonday|"The Diamond Sutra is a popular example of Buddhist writing in which the Buddha lectures Subhuti, his aging disciple, on the nonexistence of everything. Repeatedly, the Buddha enjoins his student to make copies of this book and pass them around. Buddha says, “Whatever place constitutes a repository for this sacred scripture, there also the Lord Buddha may be found.” Copying the Diamond Sutra therefore became a way of “gaining merit.” In it, Buddha also says, “If a good disciple whether man or woman, in the morning, at noonday and at eventide, sacrificed, sacrificed lives innumerable as the sands in the Ganges, and thus without intermission throughout infinite ages; and if another disciple, hearing this scripture proclaimed, steadfastly believed it, his felicity would be appreciably greater than the other.”"|Paper|"Mark Kurlansky"
18:20|1820|"As newspapers grew more numerous and more competitive, they consumed ever-increasing quantities of relatively low-grade paper. In 1760, more than 9 million British newspapers were sold. In 1811, more than 24 million were sold, and by 1820, newspaper circulation exceeded 29 million. Demand for paper was exceeding supply. A small newspaper with a circulation of 3,000 required twelve hours of printing with experienced printers moving as quickly as they could. A large newspaper needed four presses, two for each side of a sheet. New technology was needed."|Paper|"Mark Kurlansky"
18:25|1825|"Starting in 1816, the Niépce brothers also worked sporadically on their idea of fixing a shadow image. They found that a certain asphalt compound was light-sensitive, and in the 1820s they produced the first photographs, which they called heliographs. The oldest-known permanent photograph, an image of a man leading a horse, dates from 1825. The heliograph was an image fixed on polished pewter coated with a thin layer of bitumen, or asphalt, dissolved in lavender oil. The image had to be exposed in the camera for at least eight hours, the brothers said, but it may have taken days."|Paper|"Mark Kurlansky"
19:33|1933|"The Japanese took two years to develop and test their new weapon, its design based on an eighteenth-century balloon. During the Italian War of Independence in 1848, an Austrian officer had developed the idea of using thin paper balloons to drop bombs. He calculated that a balloon could stay aloft for a half hour with a thirty-pound bomb that would then explode with a timed fuse when it landed. These balloon bombs were used in the siege of Venice, but to no real effect, although one did manage to land in the Piazza San Marco and explode. A wind shift also caused a number of the balloons to float back toward the soldiers who had launched them. The attackers lost enthusiasm for their new weapon and the idea lay dormant until 1933, when Japanese lieutenant general Reikichi Tada was assigned to a research laboratory to develop new weapons."|Paper|"Mark Kurlansky"
19:07|1907|"The oldest machine at Glatfelter dates from 1907, and it was a state-of the-art model when it came out—a beautiful creation with swirls and curlicues of green cast-iron grill work on one side, resembling a miniature fin de siècle Parisian bridge. It produces three tons of paper an hour, which was a dizzying amount in 1907. But between 1920 and 1923, the mill installed two new machines, each producing seven tons an hour, and in 1956, it installed a machine that makes fifteen tons an hour. Yet another machine was added in 1965; it also produces fifteen tons an hour."|Paper|"Mark Kurlansky"
