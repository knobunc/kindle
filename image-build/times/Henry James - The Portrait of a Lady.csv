18:00|"six o'clock that afternoon"|"Isabel debated. ""No, I don't like him. I can tell you, because I'm weary of my secret. But that's enough; I can't announce it on the housetops.""




Henrietta gave a laugh. ""Don't you think you're rather too considerate?""




""It's not of him that I'm considerate—it's of myself!"" Isabel answered.




It was not surprising Gilbert Osmond should not have taken comfort in Miss Stackpole; his instinct had naturally set him in opposition to a young lady capable of advising his wife to withdraw from the conjugal roof. When she arrived in Rome he had said to Isabel that he hoped she would leave her friend the interviewer alone; and Isabel had answered that he at least had nothing to fear from her. She said to Henrietta that as Osmond didn't like her she couldn't invite her to dine, but they could easily see each other in other ways. Isabel received Miss Stackpole freely in her own sitting-room, and took her repeatedly to drive, face to face with Pansy, who, bending a little forward, on the opposite seat of the carriage, gazed at the celebrated authoress with a respectful attention which Henrietta occasionally found irritating. She complained to Isabel that Miss Osmond had a little look as if she should remember everything one said. ""I don't want to be remembered that way,"" Miss Stackpole declared; ""I consider that my conversation refers only to the moment, like the morning papers. Your stepdaughter, as she sits there, looks as if she kept all the back numbers and would bring them out some day against me."" She could not teach herself to think favourably of Pansy, whose absence of initiative, of conversation, of personal claims, seemed to her, in a girl of twenty, unnatural and even uncanny. Isabel presently saw that Osmond would have liked her to urge a little the cause of her friend, insist a little upon his receiving her, so that he might appear to suffer for good manners' sake. Her immediate acceptance of his objections put him too much in the wrong—it being in effect one of the disadvantages of expressing contempt that you cannot enjoy at the same time the credit of expressing sympathy. Osmond held to his credit, and yet he held to his objections—all of which were elements difficult to reconcile. The right thing would have been that Miss Stackpole should come to dine at Palazzo Roccanera once or twice, so that (in spite of his superficial civility, always so great) she might judge for herself how little pleasure it gave him. From the moment, however, that both the ladies were so unaccommodating, there was nothing for Osmond but to wish the lady from New York would take herself off. It was surprising how little satisfaction he got from his wife's friends; he took occasion to call Isabel's attention to it.




""You're certainly not fortunate in your intimates; I wish you might make a new collection,"" he said to her one morning in reference to nothing visible at the moment, but in a tone of ripe reflection which deprived the remark of all brutal abruptness. ""It's as if you had taken the trouble to pick out the people in the world that I have least in common with. Your cousin I have always thought a conceited ass—besides his being the most ill-favoured animal I know. Then it's insufferably tiresome that one can't tell him so; one must spare him on account of his health. His health seems to me the best part of him; it gives him privileges enjoyed by no one else. If he's so desperately ill there's only one way to prove it; but he seems to have no mind for that. I can't say much more for the great Warburton. When one really thinks of it, the cool insolence of that performance was something rare! He comes and looks at one's daughter as if she were a suite of apartments; he tries the door-handles and looks out of the windows, raps on the walls and almost thinks he'll take the place. Will you be so good as to draw up a lease? Then, on the whole, he decides that the rooms are too small; he doesn't think he could live on a third floor; he must look out for a piano nobile. And he goes away after having got a month's lodging in the poor little apartment for nothing. Miss Stackpole, however, is your most wonderful invention. She strikes me as a kind of monster. One hasn't a nerve in one's body that she doesn't set quivering. You know I never have admitted that she's a woman. Do you know what she reminds me of? Of a new steel pen—the most odious thing in nature. She talks as a steel pen writes; aren't her letters, by the way, on ruled paper? She thinks and moves and walks and looks exactly as she talks. You may say that she doesn't hurt me, inasmuch as I don't see her. I don't see her, but I hear her; I hear her all day long. Her voice is in my ears; I can't get rid of it. I know exactly what she says, and every inflexion of the tone in which she says it. She says charming things about me, and they give you great comfort. I don't like at all to think she talks about me—I feel as I should feel if I knew the footman were wearing my hat.""




Henrietta talked about Gilbert Osmond, as his wife assured him, rather less than he suspected. She had plenty of other subjects, in two of which the reader may be supposed to be especially interested. She let her friend know that Caspar Goodwood had discovered for himself that she was unhappy, though indeed her ingenuity was unable to suggest what comfort he hoped to give her by coming to Rome and yet not calling on her. They met him twice in the street, but he had no appearance of seeing them; they were driving, and he had a habit of looking straight in front of him, as if he proposed to take in but one object at a time. Isabel could have fancied she had seen him the day before; it must have been with just that face and step that he had walked out of Mrs. Touchett's door at the close of their last interview. He was dressed just as he had been dressed on that day, Isabel remembered the colour of his cravat; and yet in spite of this familiar look there was a strangeness in his figure too, something that made her feel it afresh to be rather terrible he should have come to Rome. He looked bigger and more overtopping than of old, and in those days he certainly reached high enough. She noticed that the people whom he passed looked back after him; but he went straight forward, lifting above them a face like a February sky.




Miss Stackpole's other topic was very different; she gave Isabel the latest news about Mr. Bantling. He had been out in the United States the year before, and she was happy to say she had been able to show him considerable attention. She didn't know how much he had enjoyed it, but she would undertake to say it had done him good; he wasn't the same man when he left as he had been when be came. It had opened his eyes and shown him that England wasn't everything. He had been very much liked in most places, and thought extremely simple—more simple than the English were commonly supposed to be. There were people who had thought him affected; she didn't know whether they meant that his simplicity was an affectation. Some of his questions were too discouraging; he thought all the chambermaids were farmers' daughters—or all the farmers' daughters were chambermaids—she couldn't exactly remember which. He hadn't seemed able to grasp the great school system; it had been really too much for him. On the whole he had behaved as if there were too much of everything—as if he could only take in a small part. The part he had chosen was the hotel system and the river navigation. He had seemed really fascinated with the hotels; he had a photograph of every one he had visited. But the river steamers were his principal interest; he wanted to do nothing but sail on the big boats. They had travelled together from New York to Milwaukee, stopping at the most interesting cities on the route; and whenever they started afresh he had wanted to know if they could go by the steamer. He seemed to have no idea of geography—had an impression that Baltimore was a Western city and was perpetually expecting to arrive at the Mississippi. He ap peared never to have heard of any river in America but the Mississippi and was unprepared to recognise the existence of the Hudson, though obliged to confess at last that it was fully equal to the Rhine. They had spent some pleasant hours in the palace-cars; he was always ordering ice-cream from the coloured man. He could never get used to that idea—that you could get ice-cream in the cars. Of course you couldn't, nor fans, nor candy, nor anything in the English cars! He found the heat quite overwhelming, and she had told him she indeed expected it was the biggest he had ever experienced. He was now in England, hunting—""hunting round"" Henrietta called it. These amusements were those of the American red men; we had left that behind long ago, the pleasures of the chase. It seemed to be generally believed in England that we wore tomahawks and feathers; but such a costume was more in keeping with English habits. Mr. Bantling would not have time to join her in Italy, but when she should go to Paris again he expected to come over. He wanted very much to see Versailles again; he was very fond of the ancient regime. They didn't agree about that, but that was what she liked Versailles for, that you could see the ancient regime had been swept away. There were no dukes and marquises there now; she remembered on the contrary one day when there were five American families, walking all round. Mr. Bantling was very anxious that she should take up the subject of England again, and he thought she might get on better with it now; England had changed a good deal within two or three years. He was determined that if she went there he should go to see his sister, Lady Pensil, and that this time the invitation should come to her straight. The mystery about that other one had never been explained.




Caspar Goodwood came at last to Palazzo Roccanera; he had written Isabel a note beforehand, to ask leave. This was promptly granted; she would be at home at six o'clock that afternoon. She spent the day wondering what he was coming for—what good he expected to get of it. He had presented himself hitherto as a person destitute of the faculty of compromise, who would take what he had asked for or take nothing. Isabel's hospitality, however, raised no questions, and she found no great diffi culty in appearing happy enough to deceive him. It was her conviction at least that she deceived him, made him say to himself that he had been misinformed. But she also saw, so she believed, that he was not disappointed, as some other men, she was sure, would have been; he had not come to Rome to look for an opportunity. She never found out what he had come for; he offered her no explanation; there could be none but the very simple one that he wanted to see her. In other words he had come for his amusement. Isabel followed up this induction with a good deal of eagerness, and was delighted to have found a formula that would lay the ghost of this gentleman's ancient grievance. If he had come to Rome for his amusement this was exactly what she wanted; for if he cared for amusement he had got over his heartache. If he had got over his heartache everything was as it should be and her responsibilities were at an end. It was true that he took his recreation a little stiffly, but he had never been loose and easy and she had every reason to believe he was satisfied with what he saw. Henrietta was not in his confidence, though he was in hers, and Isabel consequently received no side-light upon his state of mind. He was open to little conversation on general topics; it came back to her that she had said of him once, years before, ""Mr. Goodwood speaks a good deal, but he doesn't talk."" He spoke a good deal now, but he talked perhaps as little as ever; considering, that is, how much there was in Rome to talk about. His arrival was not calculated to simplify her relations with her husband, for if Mr. Osmond didn't like her friends Mr. Goodwood had no claim upon his attention save as having been one of the first of them. There was nothing for her to say of him but that he was the very oldest; this rather meagre synthesis exhausted the facts. She had been obliged to introduce him to Gilbert; it was impossible she should not ask him to dinner, to her Thursday evenings, of which she had grown very weary, but to which her husband still held for the sake not so much of inviting people as of not inviting them.




To the Thursdays Mr. Goodwood came regularly, solemnly, rather early; he appeared to regard them with a good deal of gravity. Isabel every now and then had a moment of anger; there was something so literal about him; she thought he might know that she didn't know what to do with him. But she couldn't call him stupid; he was not that in the least; he was only extraordinarily honest. To be as honest as that made a man very different from most people; one had to be almost equally honest with HIM. She made this latter reflection at the very time she was flattering herself she had persuaded him that she was the most light-hearted of women. He never threw any doubt on this point, never asked her any personal questions. He got on much better with Osmond than had seemed probable. Osmond had a great dislike to being counted on; in such a case be had an irresistible need of disappointing you. It was in virtue of this principle that he gave himself the entertainment of taking a fancy to a perpendicular Bostonian whom he bad been depended upon to treat with coldness. He asked Isabel if Mr. Goodwood also had wanted to marry her, and expressed surprise at her not having accepted him. It would have been an excellent thing, like living under some tall belfry which would strike all the hours and make a queer vibration in the upper air. He declared he liked to talk with the great Goodwood; it wasn't easy at first, you had to climb up an interminable steep staircase up to the top of the tower; but when you got there you had a big view and felt a little fresh breeze. Osmond, as we know, had delightful qualities, and he gave Caspar Goodwood the benefit of them all. Isabel could see that Mr. Goodwood thought better of her husband than he had ever wished to; he had given her the impression that morning in Florence of being inaccessible to a good impression. Gilbert asked him repeatedly to dinner, and Mr. Goodwood smoked a cigar with him afterwards and even desired to be shown his collections. Gilbert said to Isabel that he was very original; he was as strong and of as good a style as an English portmanteau,—he had plenty of straps and buckles which would never wear out, and a capital patent lock. Caspar Goodwood took to riding on the Campagna and devoted much time to this exercise; it was therefore mainly in the evening that Isabel saw him. She bethought herself of saying to him one day that if he were willing he could render her a service. And then she added smiling:




""I don't know, however, what right I have to ask a service of you.""




""You're the person in the world who has most right,"" he answered. I've given you assurances that I've never given any one else.""




The service was that he should go and see her cousin Ralph, who was ill at the Hotel de Paris, alone, and be as kind to him as possible. Mr. Goodwood had never seen him, but he would know who the poor fellow was; if she was not mistaken Ralph had once invited him to Gardencourt. Caspar remembered the invitation perfectly, and, though he was not supposed to be a man of imagination, had enough to put himself in the place of a poor gentleman who lay dying at a Roman inn. He called at the Hotel de Paris and, on being shown into the presence of the master of Gardencourt, found Miss Stackpole sitting beside his sofa. A singular change had in fact occurred in this lady's relations with Ralph Touchett. She had not been asked by Isabel to go and see him, but on hearing that he was too ill to come out had immediately gone of her own motion. After this she had paid him a daily visit—always under the conviction that they were great enemies. ""Oh yes, we're intimate enemies,"" Ralph used to say; and he accused her freely—as freely as the humour of it would allow —of coming to worry him to death. In reality they became excellent friends, Henrietta much wondering that she should never have liked him before. Ralph liked her exactly as much as he had always done; he had never doubted for a moment that she was an excellent fellow. They talked about everything and always differed; about everything, that is, but Isabel—a topic as to which Ralph always had a thin forefinger on his lips. Mr. Bantling on the other hand proved a great resource; Ralph was capable of discussing Mr. Bantling with Henrietta for hours. Discussion was stimulated of course by their inevitable difference of view—Ralph having amused himself with taking the ground that the genial ex-guardsman was a regular Machiavelli. Caspar Goodwood could contribute nothing to such a debate; but after he had been left alone with his host he found there were various other matters they could take up. It must be admitted that the lady who had just gone out was not one of these; Caspar granted all Miss Stackpole's merits in advance, but had no further remark to make about her. Neither, after the first allusions, did the two men expatiate upon Mrs. Osmond—a theme in which Goodwood perceived as many dangers as Ralph. He felt very sorry for that unclassable personage; he couldn't bear to see a pleasant man, so pleasant for all his queerness, so beyond anything to be done. There was always something to be done, for Goodwood, and he did it in this case by repeating several times his visit to the Hotel de Paris. It seemed to Isabel that she had been very clever; she had artfully disposed of the superfluous Caspar. She had given him an occupation; she had converted him into a caretaker of Ralph. She had a plan of making him travel northward with her cousin as soon as the first mild weather should allow it. Lord Warburton had brought Ralph to Rome and Mr. Goodwood should take him away. There seemed a happy symmetry in this, and she was now intensely eager that Ralph should depart. She had a constant fear he would die there before her eyes and a horror of the occurrence of this event at an inn, by her door, which he had so rarely entered. Ralph must sink to his last rest in his own dear house, in one of those deep, dim chambers of Gardencourt where the dark ivy would cluster round the edges of the glimmering window. There seemed to Isabel in these days something sacred in Gardencourt; no chapter of the past was more perfectly irrecoverable. When she thought of the months she had spent there the tears rose to her eyes. She flattered herself, as I say, upon her ingenuity, but she had need of all she could muster; for several events occurred which seemed to confront and defy her. The Countess Gemini arrived from Florence—arrived with her trunks, her dresses, her chatter, her falsehoods, her frivolity, the strange, the unholy legend of the number of her lovers. Edward Rosier, who had been away somewhere,—no one, not even Pansy, knew where,—reappeared in Rome and began to write her long letters, which she never answered. Madame Merle returned from Naples and said to her with a strange smile: ""What on earth did you do with Lord Warburton?"" As if it were any business of hers!"|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"
00:00|midnight|"To-night what he was chiefly thinking of was that he was to leave her to-morrow and that he had gained nothing by coming but the knowledge that he was as little wanted as ever. About herself he had gained no knowledge; she was imperturbable, inscrutable, impenetrable. He felt the old bitterness, which he had tried so hard to swallow, rise again in his throat, and he knew there are disappointments that last as long as life. Osmond went on talking; Goodwood was vaguely aware that he was touching again upon his perfect intimacy with his wife. It seemed to him for a moment that the man had a kind of demonic imagination; it was impossible that without malice he should have selected so unusual a topic. But what did it matter, after all, whether he were demonic or not, and whether she loved him or hated him? She might hate him to the death without one's gaining a straw one's self. ""You travel, by the by, with Ralph Touchett,"" Osmond said. ""I suppose that means you'll move slowly?""




""I don't know. I shall do just as he likes.""




""You're very accommodating. We're immensely obliged to you; you must really let me say it. My wife has probably expressed to you what we feel. Touchett has been on our minds all winter; it has looked more than once as if he would never leave Rome. He ought never to have come; it's worse than an imprudence for people in that state to travel; it's a kind of indelicacy. I wouldn't for the world be under such an obligation to Touchett as he has been to—to my wife and me. Other people inevitably have to look after him, and every one isn't so generous as you.""




""I've nothing else to do,"" Caspar said dryly.




Osmond looked at him a moment askance. ""You ought to marry, and then you'd have plenty to do! It's true that in that case you wouldn't be quite so available for deeds of mercy.""




""Do you find that as a married man you're so much occupied?"" the young man mechanically asked.




""Ah, you see, being married's in itself an occupation. It isn't always active; it's often passive; but that takes even more attention. Then my wife and I do so many things together. We read, we study, we make music, we walk, we drive—we talk even, as when we first knew each other. I delight, to this hour, in my wife's conversation. If you're ever bored take my advice and get married. Your wife indeed may bore you, in that case; but you'll never bore yourself. You'll always have something to say to yourself—always have a subject of reflection.""




""I'm not bored,"" said Goodwood. ""I've plenty to think about and to say to myself.""




""More than to say to others!"" Osmond exclaimed with a light laugh. ""Where shall you go next? I mean after you've consigned Touchett to his natural caretakers—I believe his mother's at last coming back to look after him. That little lady's superb; she neglects her duties with a finish—! Perhaps you'll spend the summer in England?""




""I don't know. I've no plans.""




""Happy man! That's a little bleak, but it's very free.""




""Oh yes, I'm very free.""




""Free to come back to Rome I hope,"" said Osmond as he saw a group of new visitors enter the room. ""Remember that when you do come we count on you!""




Goodwood had meant to go away early, but the evening elapsed without his having a chance to speak to Isabel otherwise than as one of several associated interlocutors. There was something perverse in the inveteracy with which she avoided him; his unquenchable rancour discovered an intention where there was certainly no appearance of one. There was absolutely no appearance of one. She met his eyes with her clear hospitable smile, which seemed almost to ask that he would come and help her to entertain some of her visitors. To such suggestions, however, he opposed but a stiff impatience. He wandered about and waited; he talked to the few people he knew, who found him for the first time rather self-contradictory. This was indeed rare with Caspar Goodwood, though he often contradicted others. There was often music at Palazzo Roccanera, and it was usually very good. Under cover of the music he managed to contain himself; but toward the end, when he saw the people beginning to go, he drew near to Isabel and asked her in a low tone if he might not speak to her in one of the other rooms, which he had just assured himself was empty. She smiled as if she wished to oblige him but found her self absolutely prevented. ""I'm afraid it's impossible. People are saying good-night, and I must be where they can see me.""




""I shall wait till they are all gone then.""




She hesitated a moment. ""Ah, that will be delightful!"" she exclaimed.




And he waited, though it took a long time yet. There were several people, at the end, who seemed tethered to the carpet. The Countess Gemini, who was never herself till midnight, as she said, displayed no consciousness that the entertainment was over; she had still a little circle of gentlemen in front of the fire, who every now and then broke into a united laugh. Osmond had disappeared—he never bade good-bye to people; and as the Countess was extending her range, according to her custom at this period of the evening, Isabel had sent Pansy to bed. Isabel sat a little apart; she too appeared to wish her sister-in-law would sound a lower note and let the last loiterers depart in peace.




""May I not say a word to you now?"" Goodwood presently asked her. She got up immediately, smiling. ""Certainly, we'll go somewhere else if you like."" They went together, leaving the Countess with her little circle, and for a moment after they had crossed the threshold nei ther of them spoke. Isabel would not sit down; she stood in the middle of the room slowly fanning herself; she had for him the same familiar grace. She seemed to wait for him to speak. Now that he was alone with her all the passion he had never stifled surged into his senses; it hummed in his eyes and made things swim round him. The bright, empty room grew dim and blurred, and through the heaving veil he felt her hover before him with gleaming eyes and parted lips. If he had seen more distinctly he would have perceived her smile was fixed and a trifle forced—that she was frightened at what she saw in his own face. ""I suppose you wish to bid me goodbye?"" she said.




""Yes—but I don't like it. I don't want to leave Rome,"" he answered with almost plaintive honesty.




""I can well imagine. It's wonderfully good of you. I can't tell you how kind I think you.""




For a moment more he said nothing. ""With a few words like that you make me go.""




""You must come back some day,"" she brightly returned.




""Some day? You mean as long a time hence as possible.""




""Oh no; I don't mean all that.""




""What do you mean? I don't understand! But I said I'd go, and I'll go,"" Goodwood added.




""Come back whenever you like,"" said Isabel with attempted lightness.




""I don't care a straw for your cousin!"" Caspar broke out.




""Is that what you wished to tell me?""




""No, no; I didn't want to tell you anything; I wanted to ask you—"" he paused a moment, and then—""what have you really made of your life?"" he said, in a low, quick tone. He paused again, as if for an answer; but she said nothing, and he went on: ""I can't understand, I can't penetrate you! What am I to believe—what do you want me to think?"" Still she said nothing; she only stood looking at him, now quite without pretending to ease. ""I'm told you're unhappy, and if you are I should like to know it. That would be something for me. But you yourself say you're happy, and you're somehow so still, so smooth, so hard. You're completely changed. You conceal everything; I haven't really come near you.""




""You come very near,"" Isabel said gently, but in a tone of warning.




""And yet I don't touch you! I want to know the truth. Have you done well?""




""You ask a great deal.""




""Yes—I've always asked a great deal. Of course you won't tell me. I shall never know if you can help it. And then it's none of my business."" He had spoken with a visible effort to control himself, to give a considerate form to an inconsiderate state of mind. But the sense that it was his last chance, that he loved her and had lost her, that she would think him a fool whatever he should say, suddenly gave him a lash and added a deep vibration to his low voice. ""You're perfectly inscrutable, and that's what makes me think you've something to hide. I tell you I don't care a straw for your cousin, but I don't mean that I don't like him. I mean that it isn't because I like him that I go away with him. I'd go if he were an idiot and you should have asked me. If you should ask me I'd go to Siberia tomorrow. Why do you want me to leave the place? You must have some reason for that; if you were as contented as you pretend you are you wouldn't care. I'd rather know the truth about you, even if it's damnable, than have come here for nothing. That isn't what I came for. I thought I shouldn't care. I came because I wanted to assure myself that I needn't think of you any more. I haven't thought of anything else, and you're quite right to wish me to go away. But if I must go, there's no harm in my letting myself out for a single moment, is there? If you're really hurt—if HE hurts you—nothing I say will hurt you. When I tell you I love you it's simply what I came for. I thought it was for something else; but it was for that. I shouldn't say it if I didn't believe I should never see you again. It's the last time—let me pluck a single flower! I've no right to say that, I know; and you've no right to listen. But you don't listen; you never listen, you're always thinking of something else. After this I must go, of course; so I shall at least have a reason. Your asking me is no reason, not a real one. I can't judge by your husband,"" he went on irrelevantly, almost incoherently; ""I don't understand him; he tells me you adore each other. Why does he tell me that? What business is it of mine? When I say that to you, you look strange. But you always look strange. Yes, you've something to hide. It's none of my business —very true. But I love you,"" said Caspar Goodwood.




As he said, she looked strange. She turned her eyes to the door by which they had entered and raised her fan as if in warning.




""You've behaved so well; don't spoil it,"" she uttered softly.




""No one hears me. It's wonderful what you tried to put me off with. I love you as I've never loved you.""




""I know it. I knew it as soon as you consented to go.""




""You can't help it—of course not. You would if you could, but you can't, unfortunately. Unfortunately for me, I mean. I ask nothing —nothing, that is, I shouldn't. But I do ask one sole satisfaction:—that you tell me—that you tell me—!""




""That I tell you what?""




""Whether I may pity you.""




""Should you like that?"" Isabel asked, trying to smile again.




""To pity you? Most assuredly! That at least would be doing something. I'd give my life to it.""




She raised her fan to her face, which it covered all except her eyes. They rested a moment on his. ""Don't give your life to it; but give a thought to it every now and then."" And with that she went back to the Countess Gemini."|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"
"ap < 06:00"|"towards six o'clock"|"""No, because you'd never tell me. And it would be painful for me to know.""




There was a pause, and for the first time since she had known her Isabel thought Madame Merle disagreeable. She wished she would leave her. ""Remember how attractive Pansy is, and don't despair,"" she said abruptly, with a desire that this should close their interview.




But Madame Merle's expansive presence underwent no contraction. She only gathered her mantle about her and, with the movement, scattered upon the air a faint, agreeable fragrance. ""I don't despair; I feel encouraged. And I didn't come to scold you; I came if possible to learn the truth. I know you'll tell it if I ask you. It's an immense blessing with you that one can count upon that. No, you won't believe what a comfort I take in it.""




""What truth do you speak of?"" Isabel asked, wondering.




""Just this: whether Lord Warburton changed his mind quite of his own movement or because you recommended it. To please himself I mean, or to please you. Think of the confidence I must still have in you, in spite of having lost a little of it,"" Madame Merle continued with a smile, ""to ask such a question as that!"" She sat looking at her friend, to judge the effect of her words, and then went on: ""Now don't be heroic, don't be unreasonable, don't take offence. It seems to me I do you an honour in speaking so. I don't know another woman to whom I would do it. I haven't the least idea that any other woman would tell me the truth. And don't you see how well it is that your husband should know it? It's true that he doesn't appear to have had any tact whatever in trying to extract it; he has indulged in gratuitous suppositions. But that doesn't alter the fact that it would make a difference in his view of his daughter's prospects to know distinctly what really occurred. If Lord Warburton simply got tired of the poor child, that's one thing, and it's a pity. If he gave her up to please you it's another. That's a pity too, but in a different way. Then, in the latter case, you'd perhaps resign yourself to not being pleased—to simply seeing your step-daughter married. Let him off—let us have him!""




Madame Merle had proceeded very deliberately, watching her companion and apparently thinking she could proceed safely. As she went on Isabel grew pale; she clasped her hands more tightly in her lap. It was not that her visitor had at last thought it the right time to be insolent; for this was not what was most apparent. It was a worse horror than that. ""Who are you—what are you?"" Isabel murmured. ""What have you to do with my husband?"" It was strange that for the moment she drew as near to him as if she had loved him.




""Ah then, you take it heroically! I'm very sorry. Don't think, however, that I shall do so.""




""What have you to do with me?"" Isabel went on.




Madame Merle slowly got up, stroking her muff, but not removing her eyes from Isabel's face. ""Everything!"" she answered.




Isabel sat there looking up at her, without rising; her face was almost a prayer to be enlightened. But the light of this woman's eyes seemed only a darkness. ""Oh misery!"" she murmured at last; and she fell back, covering her face with her hands. It had come over her like a high-surging wave that Mrs. Touchett was right. Madame Merle had married her. Before she uncovered her face again that lady had left the room.




Isabel took a drive alone that afternoon; she wished to be far away, under the sky, where she could descend from her carriage and tread upon the daisies. She had long before this taken old Rome into her confidence, for in a world of ruins the ruin of her happiness seemed a less unnatural catastrophe. She rested her weariness upon things that had crumbled for centuries and yet still were upright; she dropped her secret sadness into the silence of lonely places, where its very modern quality detached itself and grew objective, so that as she sat in a sun-warmed angle on a winter's day, or stood in a mouldy church to which no one came, she could almost smile at it and think of its smallness. Small it was, in the large Roman record, and her haunting sense of the continuity of the human lot easily carried her from the less to the greater. She had become deeply, tenderly acquainted with Rome; it interfused and moderated her passion. But she had grown to think of it chiefly as the place where people had suffered. This was what came to her in the starved churches, where the marble columns, transferred from pagan ruins, seemed to offer her a companionship in endurance and the musty incense to be a compound of long-unanswered prayers. There was no gentler nor less consistent heretic than Isabel; the firmest of worshippers, gazing at dark altar-pictures or clustered candles, could not have felt more intimately the suggestiveness of these objects nor have been more liable at such moments to a spiritual visitation. Pansy, as we know, was almost always her companion, and of late the Countess Gemini, balancing a pink parasol, had lent brilliancy to their equipage; but she still occasionally found herself alone when it suited her mood and where it suited the place. On such occasions she had several resorts; the most accessible of which perhaps was a seat on the low parapet which edges the wide grassy space before the high, cold front of Saint John Lateran, whence you look across the Campagna at the far-trailing outline of the Alban Mount and at that mighty plain, between, which is still so full of all that has passed from it. After the departure of her cousin and his companions she roamed more than usual; she carried her sombre spirit from one familiar shrine to the other. Even when Pansy and the Countess were with her she felt the touch of a vanished world. The carriage, leaving the walls of Rome behind, rolled through narrow lanes where the wild honeysuckle had begun to tangle itself in the hedges, or waited for her in quiet places where the fields lay near, while she strolled further and further over the flower-freckled turf, or sat on a stone that had once had a use and gazed through the veil of her personal sadness at the splendid sadness of the scene—at the dense, warm light, the far gradations and soft confusions of colour, the motionless shepherds in lonely attitudes, the hills where the cloud-shadows had the lightness of a blush.




On the afternoon I began with speaking of, she had taken a resolution not to think of Madame Merle; but the resolution proved vain, and this lady's image hovered constantly before her. She asked herself, with an almost childlike horror of the supposition, whether to this intimate friend of several years the great historical epithet of wicked were to be applied. She knew the idea only by the Bible and other literary works; to the best of her belief she had had no personal acquaintance with wickedness. She had desired a large acquaintance with human life, and in spite of her having flattered herself that she cultivated it with some success this elementary privilege had been denied her. Perhaps it was not wicked—in the historic sense—to be even deeply false; for that was what Madame Merle had been—deeply, deeply, deeply. Isabel's Aunt Lydia had made this discovery long before, and had mentioned it to her niece; but Isabel had flattered herself at this time that she had a much richer view of things, especially of the spontaneity of her own career and the nobleness of her own interpretations, than poor stiffly-reasoning Mrs. Touchett. Madame Merle had done what she wanted; she had brought about the union of her two friends; a reflection which could not fail to make it a matter of wonder that she should so much have desired such an event. There were people who had the match-making passion, like the votaries of art for art; but Madame Merle, great artist as she was, was scarcely one of these. She thought too ill of marriage, too ill even of life; she had desired that particular marriage but had not desired others. She had therefore had a conception of gain, and Isabel asked herself where she had found her profit. It took her naturally a long time to discover, and even then her discovery was imperfect. It came back to her that Madame Merle, though she had seemed to like her from their first meeting at Gardencourt, had been doubly affectionate after Mr. Touchett's death and after learning that her young friend had been subject to the good old man's charity. She had found her profit not in the gross device of borrowing money, but in the more refined idea of introducing one of her intimates to the young woman's fresh and ingenuous fortune. She had naturally chosen her closest intimate, and it was already vivid enough to Isabel that Gilbert occupied this position. She found herself confronted in this manner with the conviction that the man in the world whom she had supposed to be the least sordid had married her, like a vulgar adventurer, for her money. Strange to say, it had never before occurred to her; if she had thought a good deal of harm of Osmond she had not done him this particular injury. This was the worst she could think of, and she had been saying to herself that the worst was still to come. A man might marry a woman for her money perfectly well; the thing was often done. But at least he should let her know. She wondered whether, since he had wanted her money, her money would now satisfy him. Would he take her money and let her go Ah, if Mr. Touchett's great charity would but help her to-day it would be blessed indeed! It was not slow to occur to her that if Madame Merle had wished to do Gilbert a service his recognition to her of the boon must have lost its warmth. What must be his feelings to-day in regard to his too zealous benefactress, and what expression must they have found on the part of such a master of irony? It is a singular, but a characteristic, fact that before Isabel returned from her silent drive she had broken its silence by the soft exclamation: ""Poor, poor Madame Merle!""




Her compassion would perhaps have been justified if on this same afternoon she had been concealed behind one of the valuable curtains of time-softened damask which dressed the interesting little salon of the lady to whom it referred; the carefully-arranged apartment to which we once paid a visit in company with the discreet Mr. Rosier. In that apartment, towards six o'clock, Gilbert Osmond was seated, and his hostess stood before him as Isabel had seen her stand on an occasion commemorated in this history with an emphasis appropriate not so much to its apparent as to its real importance.




""I don't believe you're unhappy; I believe you like it,"" said Madame Merle.




""Did I say I was unhappy?"" Osmond asked with a face grave enough to suggest that he might have been.




""No, but you don't say the contrary, as you ought in common gratitude.""




""Don't talk about gratitude,"" he returned dryly. ""And don't aggravate me,"" he added in a moment.




Madame Merle slowly seated herself, with her arms folded and her white hands arranged as a support to one of them and an ornament, as it were, to the other. She looked exquisitely calm but impressively sad. ""On your side, don't try to frighten me. I wonder if you guess some of my thoughts.""




""I trouble about them no more than I can help. I've quite enough of my own.""




""That's because they're so delightful.""




Osmond rested his head against the back of his chair and looked at his companion with a cynical directness which seemed also partly an expression of fatigue. ""You do aggravate me,"" he remarked in a moment. ""I'm very tired.""




""Eh moi donc!"" cried Madame Merle.




""With you it's because you fatigue yourself. With me it's not my own fault.""




""When I fatigue myself it's for you. I've given you an interest. That's a great gift.""




""Do you call it an interest?"" Osmond enquired with detachment.




""Certainly, since it helps you to pass your time.""




""The time has never seemed longer to me than this winter.""




""You've never looked better; you've never been so agreeable, so brilliant.""




""Damn my brilliancy!"" he thoughtfully murmured. ""How little, after all, you know me!""




""If I don't know you I know nothing,"" smiled Madame Merle. ""You've the feeling of complete success.""




""No, I shall not have that till I've made you stop judging me.""




""I did that long ago. I speak from old knowledge. But you express yourself more too.""




Osmond just hung fire. ""I wish you'd express yourself less!""




""You wish to condemn me to silence? Remember that I've never been a chatterbox. At any rate there are three or four things I should like to say to you first. Your wife doesn't know what to do with herself,"" she went on with a change of tone.




""Pardon me; she knows perfectly. She has a line sharply drawn. She means to carry out her ideas.""




""Her ideas to-day must be remarkable.""




""Certainly they are. She has more of them than ever.""




""She was unable to show me any this morning,"" said Madame Merle. ""She seemed in a very simple, almost in a stupid, state of mind. She was completely bewildered.""




""You had better say at once that she was pathetic.""




""Ah no, I don't want to encourage you too much.""




He still had his head against the cushion behind him; the ankle of one foot rested on the other knee. So he sat for a while. ""I should like to know what's the matter with you,"" he said at last. s ""The matter—the matter—!"" And here Madame Merle stopped. Then she went on with a sudden outbreak of passion, a burst of summer thunder in a clear sky: ""The matter is that I would give my right hand to be able to weep, and that I can't!""




""What good would it do you to weep?""




""It would make me feel as I felt before I knew you.""




""If I've dried your tears, that's something. But I've seen you shed them.""




""Oh, I believe you'll make me cry still. I mean make me howl like a wolf. I've a great hope, I've a great need, of that. I was vile this morning; I was horrid,"" she said.




""If Isabel was in the stupid state of mind you mention she probably didn't perceive it,"" Osmond answered.




""It was precisely my deviltry that stupefied her. I couldn't help it; I was full of something bad. Perhaps it was something good; I don't know. You've not only dried up my tears; you've dried up my soul.""




""It's not I then that am responsible for my wife's condition,"" Osmond said. ""It's pleasant to think that I shall get the benefit of your influence upon her. Don't you know the soul is an immortal principle? How can it suffer alteration?""




""I don't believe at all that it's an immortal principle. I believe it can perfectly be destroyed. That's what has happened to mine, which was a very good one to start with; and it's you I have to thank for it. You're VERY bad,"" she added with gravity in her emphasis.




""Is this the way we're to end? "" Osmond asked with the same studied coldness.




""I don't know how we're to end. I wish I did—How do bad people end?—especially as to their common  crimes. You have made me as bad as yourself."""|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"
"ap 07:15"|"quarter past seven"|"""My dear friend, you deserve to succeed,"" said Isabel very kindly.




""You say that so sadly that it's the same as if you said I shouldn't."" And he questioned her eyes with the clear trepidation of his own. He had the air of a man who knows he has been the talk of Paris for a week and is full half a head taller in consequence, but who also has a painful suspicion that in spite of this increase of stature one or two persons still have the perversity to think him diminutive. ""I know what happened here while I was away,"" he went on; ""What does Mr. Osmond expect after she has refused Lord Warburton?""




Isabel debated. ""That she'll marry another nobleman.""




""What other nobleman?""




""One that he'll pick out.""




Rosier slowly got up, putting his watch into his waistcoat-pocket. ""You're laughing at some one, but this time I don't think it's at me.""




""I didn't mean to laugh,"" said Isabel. ""I laugh very seldom. Now you had better go away.""




""I feel very safe!"" Rosier declared without moving. This might be; but it evidently made him feel more so to make the announcement in rather a loud voice, balancing himself a little complacently on his toes and looking all round the Coliseum as if it were filled with an audience. Suddenly Isabel saw him change colour; there was more of an audience than he had suspected. She turned and perceived that her two companions had returned from their excursion. ""You must really go away,"" she said quickly. ""Ah, my dear lady, pity me!"" Edward Rosier murmured in a voice strangely at variance with the announcement I have just quoted. And then he added eagerly, like a man who in the midst of his misery is seized by a happy thought: ""Is that lady the Countess Gemini? I've a great desire to be presented to her.""




Isabel looked at him a moment. ""She has no influence with her brother.""




""Ah, what a monster you make him out!"" And Rosier faced the Countess, who advanced, in front of Pansy, with an animation partly due perhaps to the fact that she perceived her sister-in-law to be engaged in conversation with a very pretty young man.




""I'm glad you've kept your enamels!"" Isabel called as she left him. She went straight to Pansy, who, on seeing Edward Rosier, had stopped short, with lowered eyes. ""We'll go back to the carriage,"" she said gently.




""Yes, it's getting late,"" Pansy returned more gently still. And she went on without a murmur, without faltering or glancing back. Isabel, however, allowing herself this last liberty, saw that a meeting had immediately taken place between the Countess and Mr. Rosier. He had removed his hat and was bowing and smiling; he had evidently introduced himself, while the Countess's expressive back displayed to Isabel's eye a gracious inclination. These facts, none the less, were presently lost to sight, for Isabel and Pansy took their places again in the carriage. Pansy, who faced her stepmother, at first kept her eyes fixed on her lap; then she raised them and rested them on Isabel's. There shone out of each of them a little melancholy ray—a spark of timid passion which touched Isabel to the heart. At the same time a wave of envy passed over her soul, as she compared the tremulous longing, the definite ideal of the child with her own dry despair. ""Poor little Pansy!"" she affectionately said.




""Oh never mind!"" Pansy answered in the tone of eager apology. And then there was a silence; the Countess was a long time coming. ""Did you show your aunt everything, and did she enjoy it?"" Isabel asked at last.




""Yes, I showed her everything. I think she was very much pleased.""




""And you're not tired, I hope.""




""Oh no, thank you, I'm not tired.""




The Countess still remained behind, so that Isabel requested the footman to go into the Coliseum and tell her they were waiting. He presently returned with the announcement that the Signora Contessa begged them not to wait—she would come home in a cab!




About a week after this lady's quick sympathies had enlisted themselves with Mr. Rosier, Isabel, going rather late to dress for dinner, found Pansy sitting in her room. The girl seemed to have been awaiting her; she got up from her low chair. ""Pardon my taking the liberty,"" she said in a small voice. ""It will be the last—for some time.""




Her voice was strange, and her eyes, widely opened, had an excited, frightened look. ""You're not going away!"" Isabel exclaimed.




""I'm going to the convent.""




""To the convent?""




Pansy drew nearer, till she was near enough to put her arms round Isabel and rest her head on her shoulder. She stood this way a moment, perfectly still; but her companion could feel her tremble. The quiver of her little body expressed everything she was unable to say. Isabel nevertheless pressed her. ""Why are you going to the convent?""




""Because papa thinks it best. He says a young girl's better, every now and then, for making a little retreat. He says the world, always the world, is very bad for a young girl. This is just a chance for a little seclusion—a little reflexion."" Pansy spoke in short detached sentences, as if she could scarce trust herself; and then she added with a triumph of self-control: ""I think papa's right; I've been so much in the world this winter.""




Her announcement had a strange effect on Isabel; it seemed to carry a larger meaning than the girl herself knew. ""When was this decided?"" she asked. ""I've heard nothing of it.""




""Papa told me half an hour ago; he thought it better it shouldn't be too much talked about in advance. Madame Catherine's to come for me at a quarter past seven, and I'm only to take two frocks. It's only for a few weeks; I'm sure it will be very good. I shall find all those ladies who used to be so kind to me, and I shall see the little girls who are being educated. I'm very fond of little girls,"" said Pansy with an effect of diminutive grandeur. ""And I'm also very fond of Mother Catherine. I shall be very quiet and think a great deal.""




Isabel listened to her, holding her breath; she was almost awe-struck. ""Think of me  sometimes."""|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"
"ap 01:00"|one|"The Countess was not banished, but she felt the insecurity of her tenure of her brother's hospitality. A week after this incident Isabel received a telegram from England, dated from Gardencourt and bearing the stamp of Mrs. Touchett's authorship. ""Ralph cannot last many days,"" it ran, ""and if convenient would like to see you. Wishes me to say that you must come only if you've not other duties. Say, for myself, that you used to talk a good deal about your duty and to wonder what it was; shall be curious to see whether you've found it out. Ralph is really dying, and there's no other company."" Isabel was prepared for this news, having received from Henrietta Stackpole a detailed account of her journey to England with her appreciative patient. Ralph had arrived more dead than alive, but she had managed to convey him to Gardencourt, where he had taken to his bed, which, as Miss Stackpole wrote, he evidently would never leave again. She added that she had really had two patients on her hands instead of one, inasmuch as Mr. Goodwood, who had been of no earthly use, was quite as ailing, in a different way, as Mr. Touchett. Afterwards she wrote that she had been obliged to surrender the field to Mrs. Touchett, who had just returned from America and had promptly given her to understand that she didn't wish any interviewing at Gardencourt. Isabel had written to her aunt shortly after Ralph came to Rome, letting her know of his critical condition and suggesting that she should lose no time in returning to Europe. Mrs. Touchett had telegraphed an acknowledgement of this admonition, and the only further news Isabel received from her was the second telegram I have just quoted.




Isabel stood a moment looking at the latter missive; then, thrusting it into her pocket, she went straight to the door of her husband's study. Here she again paused an instant, after which she opened the door and went in. Osmond was seated at the table near the window with a folio volume before him, propped against a pile of books. This volume was open at a page of small coloured plates, and Isabel presently saw that he had been copying from it the drawing of an antique coin. A box of water-colours and fine brushes lay before him, and he had already transferred to a sheet of immaculate paper the delicate, finely-tinted disk. His back was turned toward the door, but he recognised his wife without looking round.




""Excuse me for disturbing you,"" she said.




""When I come to your room I always knock,"" he answered, going on with his work.




""I forgot; I had something else to think of. My cousin's dying.""




""Ah, I don't believe that,"" said Osmond, looking at his drawing through a magnifying glass. ""He was dying when we married; he'll outlive us all.""




Isabel gave herself no time, no thought, to appreciate the careful cynicism of this declaration; she simply went on quickly, full of her own intention ""My aunt has telegraphed for me; I must go to Gardencourt.""




""Why must you go to Gardencourt?"" Osmond asked in the tone of impartial curiosity.




""To see Ralph before he dies.""




To this, for some time, he made no rejoinder; he continued to give his chief attention to his work, which was of a sort that would brook no negligence. ""I don't see the need of it,"" he said at last. ""He came to see you here. I didn't like that; I thought his being in Rome a great mistake. But I tolerated it because it was to be the last time you should see him. Now you tell me it's not to have been the last. Ah, you're not grateful!""




""What am I to be grateful for?""




Gilbert Osmond laid down his little implements, blew a speck of dust from his drawing, slowly got up, and for the first time looked at his wife. ""For my not having interfered while he was here.""




""Oh yes, I am. I remember perfectly how distinctly you let me know you didn't like it. I was very glad when he went away.""




""Leave him alone then. Don't run after him.""




Isabel turned her eyes away from him; they rested upon his little drawing. ""I must go to England,"" she said, with a full consciousness that her tone might strike an irritable man of taste as stupidly obstinate.




""I shall not like it if you do,"" Osmond remarked.




""Why should I mind that? You won't like it if I don't. You like nothing I do or don't do. You pretend to think I lie.""




Osmond turned slightly pale; he gave a cold smile. ""That's why you must go then? Not to see your cousin, but to take a revenge on me.""




""I know nothing about revenge.""




""I do,"" said Osmond. ""Don't give me an occasion.""




""You're only too eager to take one. You wish immensely that I would commit some folly.""




""I should be gratified in that case if you disobeyed me.""




""If I disobeyed you?"" said Isabel in a low tone which had the effect of mildness.




""Let it be clear. If you leave Rome to-day it will be a piece of the most deliberate, the most calculated, opposition.""




""How can you call it calculated? I received my aunt's telegram but three minutes ago.""




""You calculate rapidly; it's a great accomplishment. I don't see why we should prolong our discussion; you know my wish."" And he stood there as if he expected to see her withdraw.




But she never moved; she couldn't move, strange as it may seem; she still wished to justify herself; he had the power, in an extraordinary degree, of making her feel this need. There was something in her imagination he could always appeal to against her judgement. ""You've no reason for such a wish,"" said Isabel, ""and I've every reason for going. I can't tell you how unjust you seem to me. But I think you know. It's your own opposition that's calculated. It's malignant.""




She had never uttered her worst thought to her husband before, and the sensation of hearing it was evidently new to Osmond. But he showed no surprise, and his coolness was apparently a proof that he had believed his wife would in fact be unable to resist for ever his ingenious endeavour to draw her out. ""It's all the more intense then,"" he answered. And he added almost as if he were giving her a friendly counsel: ""This is a very important matter."" She recognised that; she was fully conscious of the weight of the occasion; she knew that between them they had arrived at a crisis. Its gravity made her careful; she said nothing, and he went on. ""You say I've no reason? I have the very best. I dislike, from the bottom of my soul, what you intend to do. It's dishonourable; it's indelicate; it's indecent. Your cousin is nothing whatever to me, and I'm under no obligation to make concessions to him. I've already made the very handsomest. Your relations with him, while he was here, kept me on pins and needles; but I let that pass, because from week to week I expected him to go. I've never liked him and he has never liked me. That's why you like him—because he hates me,"" said Osmond with a quick, barely audible tremor in his voice. ""I've an ideal of what my wife should do and should not do. She should not travel across Europe alone, in defiance of my deepest desire, to sit at the bedside of other men. Your cousin's nothing to you; he's nothing to us. You smile most expressively when I talk about US, but I assure you that we, we, Mrs. Osmond, is all I know. I take our marriage seriously; you appear to have found a way of not doing so. I'm not aware that we're divorced or separated; for me we're indissolubly united. You are nearer to me than any human creature, and I'm nearer to you. It may be a disagreeable proximity; it's one, at any rate, of our own deliberate making. You don't like to be reminded of that, I know; but I'm perfectly willing, because—because—"" And he paused a moment, looking as if he had something to say which would be very much to the point. ""Because I think we should accept the consequences of our actions, and what I value most in life is the honour of a thing!"""|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"
"ap 05:00"|"five o'clock"|"There was a train for Turin and Paris that evening; and after the Countess had left her Isabel had a rapid and decisive conference with her maid, who was discreet, devoted and active. After this she thought (except of her journey) only of one thing. She must go and see Pansy; from her she couldn't turn away. She had not seen her yet, as Osmond had given her to understand that it was too soon to begin. She drove at five o'clock to a high floor in a narrow street in the quarter of the Piazza Navona, and was admitted by the portress of the convent, a genial and obsequious person. Isabel had been at this institution before; she had come with Pansy to see the sisters. She knew they were good women, and she saw that the large rooms were clean and cheerful and that the well-used garden had sun for winter and shade for spring. But she disliked the place, which affronted and almost frightened her; not for the world would she have spent a night there. It produced to-day more than before the impression of a well-appointed prison; for it was not possible to pretend Pansy was free to leave it. This innocent creature had been presented to her in a new and violent light, but the secondary effect of the revelation was to make her reach out a hand.




The portress left her to wait in the parlour of the convent while she went to make it known that there was a visitor for the dear young lady. The parlour was a vast, cold apartment, with new-looking furniture; a large clean stove of white porcelain, unlighted, a collection of wax flowers under glass, and a series of engravings from religious pictures on the walls. On the other occasion Isabel had thought it less like Rome than like Philadelphia, but to-day she made no reflexions; the apartment only seemed to her very empty and very soundless. The portress returned at the end of some five minutes, ushering in another person. Isabel got up, expecting to see one of the ladies of the sisterhood, but to her extreme surprise found herself confronted with Madame Merle. The effect was strange, for Madame Merle was already so present to her vision that her appearance in the flesh was like suddenly, and rather awfully, seeing a painted picture move. Isabel had been thinking all day of her falsity, her audacity, her ability, her probable suffering; and these dark things seemed to flash with a sudden light as she entered the room. Her being there at all had the character of ugly evidence, of handwritings, of profaned relics, of grim things produced in court. It made Isabel feel faint; if it had been necessary to speak on the spot she would have been quite unable. But no such necessity was distinct to her; it seemed to her indeed that she had absolutely nothing to say to Madame Merle. In one's relations with this lady, however, there were never any absolute necessities; she had a manner which carried off not only her own deficiencies but those of other people. But she was different from usual; she came in slowly, behind the portress, and Isabel instantly perceived that she was not likely to depend upon her habitual resources. For her too the occasion was exceptional, and she had undertaken to treat it by the light of the moment. This gave her a peculiar gravity; she pretended not even to smile, and though Isabel saw that she was more than ever playing a part it seemed to her that on the whole the wonderful woman had never been so natural. She looked at her young friend from head to foot, but not harshly nor defiantly; with a cold gentleness rather, and an absence of any air of allusion to their last meeting. It was as if she had wished to mark a distinction. She had been irritated then, she was reconciled now.




""You can leave us alone,"" she said to the portress; ""in five minutes this lady will ring for you."" And then she turned to Isabel, who, after noting what has just been mentioned, had ceased to notice and had let her eyes wander as far as the limits of the room would allow. She wished never to look at Madame Merle again. ""You're surprised to find me here, and I'm afraid you're not pleased,"" this lady went on. ""You don't see why I should have come; it's as if I had anticipated you. I confess I've been rather indiscreet—I ought to have asked your permission."" There was none of the oblique movement of irony in this; it was said simply and mildly; but Isabel, far afloat on a sea of wonder and pain, could not have told herself with what intention it was uttered. ""But I've not been sitting long,"" Madame Merle continued; ""that is I've not been long with Pansy. I came to see her because it occurred to me this afternoon that she must be rather lonely and perhaps even a little miserable. It may be good for a small girl; I know so little about small girls; I can't tell. At any rate it's a little dismal. Therefore I came—on the chance. I knew of course that you'd come, and her father as well; still, I had not been told other visitors were forbidden. The good woman—what's her name? Madame Catherine—made no objection whatever. I stayed twenty minutes with Pansy; she has a charming little room, not in the least conventual, with a piano and flowers. She has arranged it delightfully; she has so much taste. Of course it's all none of my business, but I feel happier since I've seen her. She may even have a maid if she likes; but of course she has no occasion to dress. She wears a little black frock; she looks so charming. I went afterwards to see Mother Catherine, who has a very good room too; I assure you I don't find the poor sisters at all monastic. Mother Catherine has a most coquettish little toilet-table, with something that looked uncommonly like a bottle of eau-de-Cologne. She speaks delightfully of Pansy; says it's a great happiness for them to have her. She's a little saint of heaven and a model to the oldest of them. Just as I was leaving Madame Catherine the portress came to say to her that there was a lady for the signorina. Of course I knew it must be you, and I asked her to let me go and receive you in her place. She demurred greatly—I must tell you that—and said it was her duty to notify the Mother Superior; it was of such high importance that you should be treated with respect. I requested her to let the Mother Superior alone and asked her how she supposed I would treat you!""




So Madame Merle went on, with much of the brilliancy of a woman who had long been a mistress of the art of conversation. But there were phases and gradations in her speech, not one of which was lost upon Isabel's ear, though her eyes were absent from her companion's face. She had not proceeded far before Isabel noted a sudden break in her voice, a lapse in her continuity, which was in itself a complete drama. This subtle modulation marked a momentous discovery—the perception of an entirely new attitude on the part of her listener. Madame Merle had guessed in the space of an instant that everything was at end between them, and in the space of another instant she had guessed the reason why. The person who stood there was not the same one she had seen hitherto, but was a very different person—a person who knew her secret. This discovery was tremendous, and from the moment she made it the most accomplished of women faltered and lost her courage. But only for that moment. Then the conscious stream of her perfect manner gathered itself again and flowed on as smoothly as might be to the end. But it was only because she had the end in view that she was able to proceed. She had been touched with a point that made her quiver, and she needed all the alertness of her will to repress her agitation. Her only safety was in her not betraying herself. She resisted this, but the startled quality of her voice refused to improve—she couldn't help it—while she heard herself say she hardly knew what. The tide of her confidence ebbed, and she was able only just to glide into port, faintly grazing the bottom.




Isabel saw it all as distinctly as if it had been reflected in a large clear glass. It might have been a great moment for her, for it might have been a moment of triumph. That Madame Merle had lost her pluck and saw before her the phantom of exposure—this in itself was a revenge, this in itself was almost the promise of a brighter day. And for a moment during which she stood apparently looking out of the window, with her back half-turned, Isabel enjoyed that knowledge. On the other side of the window lay the garden of the convent; but this is not what she saw; she saw nothing of the budding plants and the glowing afternoon. She saw, in the crude light of that revelation which had already become a part of experience and to which the very frailty of the vessel in which it had been offered her only gave an intrinsic price, the dry staring fact that she had been an applied handled hung-up tool, as senseless and convenient as mere shaped wood and iron. All the bitterness of this knowledge surged into her soul again; it was as if she felt on her lips the taste of dishonour. There was a moment during which, if she had turned and spoken, she would have said something that would hiss like a lash. But she closed her eyes, and then the hideous vision dropped. What remained was the cleverest woman in the world standing there within a few feet of her and knowing as little what to think as the meanest. Isabel's only revenge was to be silent still—to leave Madame Merle in this unprecedented situation. She left her there for a period that must have seemed long to this lady, who at last seated herself with a movement which was in itself a confession of helplessness. Then Isabel turned slow eyes, looking down at her. Madame Merle was very pale; her own eyes covered Isabel's face. She might see what she would, but her danger was over. Isabel would never accuse her, never reproach her; perhaps because she never would give her the opportunity to defend herself.




""I'm come to bid Pansy good-bye,"" our young woman said at last. ""I go to England to-night.""




""Go to England to-night!"" Madame Merle repeated sitting there and looking up at her.




""I'm going to Gardencourt. Ralph Touchett's dying.""




""Ah, you'll feel that."" Madame Merle recovered herself; she had a chance to express sympathy. ""Do you go alone?""




""Yes; without my husband.""




Madame Merle gave a low vague murmur; a sort of recognition of the general sadness of things. ""Mr. Touchett never liked me, but I'm sorry he's dying. Shall you see his mother?""




""Yes; she has returned from America.""




""She used to be very kind to me; but she has changed. Others too have changed,"" said Madame Merle with a quiet noble pathos. She paused a moment, then added: ""And you'll see dear old Gardencourt again!""




""I shall not enjoy it much,"" Isabel answered.




""Naturally—in your grief. But it's on the whole, of all the houses I know, and I know many, the one I should have liked best to live in. I don't venture to send a message to the people,"" Madame Merle added; ""but I should like to give my love to the place.""




Isabel turned away. ""I had better go to Pansy. I've not much time.""




While she looked about her for the proper egress, the door opened and admitted one of the ladies of the house, who advanced with a discreet smile, gently rubbing, under her long loose sleeves, a pair of plump white hands. Isabel recognised Madame Catherine, whose acquaintance she had already made, and begged that she would immediately let her see Miss Osmond. Madame Catherine looked doubly discreet, but smiled very blandly and said: ""It will be good for her to see you. I'll take you to her myself."" Then she directed her pleased guarded vision to Madame Merle.




""Will you let me remain a little?"" this lady asked. ""It's so good to be here.""




""You may remain always if you like!"" And the good sister gave a knowing laugh.




She led Isabel out of the room, through several corridors, and up a long staircase. All these departments were solid and bare, light and clean; so, thought Isabel, are the great penal establishments. Madame Catherine gently pushed open the door of Pansy's room and ushered in the visitor; then stood smiling with folded hands while the two others met and embraced.




""She's glad to see you,"" she repeated; ""it will do her good."" And she placed the best chair carefully for Isabel. But she made no movement to seat herself; she seemed ready to retire. ""How does this dear child look?"" she asked of Isabel, lingering a moment.




""She looks pale,"" Isabel answered.




""That's the pleasure of seeing you. She's very happy. Elle eclaire la maison,"" said the good sister.




Pansy wore, as Madame Merle had said, a little black dress; it was perhaps this that made her look pale. ""They're very good to me—they think of everything!"" she exclaimed with all her customary eagerness to accommodate.




""We think of you always—you're a precious charge,"" Madame Catherine remarked in the tone of a woman with whom benevolence was a habit and whose conception of duty was the acceptance of every care. It fell with a leaden weight on Isabel's ears; it seemed to represent the surrender of a personality, the authority of the Church.




When Madame Catherine had left them together Pansy kneeled down and hid her head in her stepmother's lap. So she remained some moments, while Isabel gently stroked her hair. Then she got up, averting her face and looking about the room. ""Don't you think I've arranged it well? I've everything I have at home.""




""It's very pretty; you're very comfortable."" Isabel scarcely knew what she could say to her. On the one hand she couldn't let her think she had come to pity her, and on the other it would be a dull mockery to pretend to rejoice with her. So she simply added after a moment: ""I've come to bid you good-bye. I'm going to England.""




Pansy's white little face turned red. ""To England! Not to come back?""




""I don't know when I shall come back.""




""Ah, I'm sorry,"" Pansy breathed with faintness. She spoke as if she had no right to criticise; but her tone expressed a depth of disappointment.




""My cousin, Mr. Touchett, is very ill; he'll probably die. I wish to see him,"" Isabel said.




""Ah yes; you told me he would die. Of course you must go. And will papa go?""




""No; I shall go alone.""




For a moment the girl said nothing. Isabel had often wondered what she thought of the apparent relations of her father with his wife; but never by a glance, by an intimation, had she let it be seen that she deemed them deficient in an air of intimacy. She made her reflexions, Isabel was sure; and she must have had a conviction that there were husbands and wives who were more intimate than that. But Pansy was not indiscreet even in thought; she would as little have ventured to judge her gentle stepmother as to criticise her magnificent father. Her heart may have stood almost as still as it would have done had she seen two of the saints in the great picture in the convent chapel turn their painted heads and shake them at each other. But as in this latter case she would (for very solemnity's sake) never have mentioned the awful phenomenon, so she put away all knowledge of the secrets of larger lives than her own. ""You'll be very far away,"" she presently went on.




""Yes; I shall be far away. But it will scarcely matter,"" Isabel explained; ""since so long as you're here I can't be called near you.""




""Yes, but you can come and see me; though you've not come very often.""




""I've not come because your father forbade it. To-day I bring nothing with me. I can't amuse you.""




""I'm not to be amused. That's not what papa wishes.""




""Then it hardly matters whether I'm in Rome or in England.""




""You're not happy, Mrs. Osmond,"" said Pansy.




""Not very. But it doesn't matter.""




""That's what I say to myself. What does it matter? But I should like to come out.""




""I wish indeed you might.""




""Don't leave me here,"" Pansy went on gently.




Isabel said nothing for a minute; her heart beat fast. ""Will you come away with me now?"" she asked.




Pansy looked at her pleadingly. ""Did papa tell you to bring me?""




""No; it's my own proposal.""




""I think I had better wait then. Did papa send me no message?""




""I don't think he knew I was coming.""




""He thinks I've not had enough,"" said Pansy. ""But I have. The ladies are very kind to me and the little girls come to see me. There are some very little ones—such charming children. Then my room—you can see for yourself. All that's very delightful. But I've had enough. Papa wished me to think a little—and I've thought a great deal.""




""What have you thought?""




""Well, that I must never displease papa.""




""You knew that before.""




""Yes; but I know it better. I'll do anything—I'll do anything,"" said Pansy. Then, as she heard her own words, a deep, pure blush came into her face. Isabel read the meaning of it; she saw the poor girl had been vanquished. It was well that Mr. Edward Rosier had kept his enamels! Isabel looked into her eyes and saw there mainly a prayer to be treated easily. She laid her hand on Pansy's as if to let her know that her look conveyed no diminution of esteem; for the collapse of the girl's momentary resistance 9mute and modest thought it had been) seemed only her tribute to the truth of things. She didn't presume to judge others, but she had judged herself; she had seen the reality. She had no vocation for struggling with combinations; in the solemnity of sequestration there was something that overwhelmed her. She bowed her pretty head to authority and only asked of authority to be merciful. Yes; it was very well that Edward Rosier had reserved a few articles!




Isabel got up; her time was rapidly shortening. ""Good-bye then. I leave Rome to-night.""




Pansy took hold of her dress; there was a sudden change in the child's face. ""You look strange, you frighten me.""




""Oh, I'm very harmless,"" said Isabel.




""Perhaps you won't come back?""




""Perhaps not. I can't tell.""




""Ah, Mrs. Osmond, you won't leave me!""




Isabel now saw she had guessed everything. ""My dear child, what can I do for you?"" she asked.




""I don't know—but I'm happier when I think of you.""




""You can always think of me.""




""Not when you're so far. I'm a little afraid,"" said Pansy.




""What are you afraid of?""




""Of papa—a little. And of Madame Merle. She has just been to see me.""




""You must not say that,"" Isabel observed.




""Oh, I'll do everything they want. Only if you're here I shall do it more easily.""




Isabel considered. ""I won't desert you,"" she said at last. ""Good-bye, my child.""




Then they held each other a moment in a silent embrace, like two sisters; and afterwards Pansy walked along the corridor with her visitor to the top of the staircase. ""Madame Merle has been here,"" she remarked as they went; and as Isabel answered nothing she added abruptly: ""I don't like Madame Merle!""




Isabel hesitated, then stopped. ""You must never say that—that you don't like Madame Merle.""




Pansy looked at her in wonder; but wonder with Pansy had never been a reason for non-compliance. ""I never will again,"" she said with exquisite gentleness. At the top of the staircase they had to separate, as it appeared to be part of the mild but very definite discipline under which Pansy lived that she should not go down. Isabel descended, and when she reached the bottom the girl was standing above. ""You'll come back?"" she called out in a voice that Isabel remembered afterwards.




""Yes—I'll come back.""




Madame Catherine met Mrs. Osmond below and con ducted her to the door of the parlour, outside of which the two stood talking a minute. ""I won't go in,"" said the good sister. ""Madame Merle's waiting for you.""




At this announcement Isabel stiffened; she was on the point of asking if there were no other egress from the convent. But a moment's reflexion assured her that she would do well not to betray to the worthy nun her desire to avoid Pansy's other friend. Her companion grasped her arm very gently and, fixing her a moment with wise, benevolent eyes, said in French and almost familiarly: ""Eh bien, chere Madame, qu'en pensez-vous?""




""About my step-daughter? Oh, it would take long to tell you.""




""We think it's enough,"" Madame Catherine distinctly observed. And she pushed open the door of the parlour.




Madame Merle was sitting just as Isabel had left her, like a woman so absorbed in thought that she had not moved a little finger. As Madame Catherine closed the door she got up, and Isabel saw that she had been thinking to some purpose. She had recovered her balance; she was in full possession of her resources. ""I found I wished to wait for you,"" she said urbanely. ""But it's not to talk about Pansy.""




Isabel wondered what it could be to talk about, and in spite of Madame Merle's declaration she answered after a moment: ""Madame Catherine says it's enough.""




""Yes; it also seems to me enough. I wanted to ask you another word about poor Mr. Touchett,"" Madame Merle added. ""Have you reason to believe that he's really at his last?""




""I've no information but a telegram. Unfortunately it only confirms a probability.""




""I'm going to ask you a strange question,"" said Madame Merle. ""Are you very fond of your cousin?"" And she gave a smile as strange as her utterance.




""Yes, I'm very fond of him. But I don't understand you.""




She just hung fire. ""It's rather hard to explain. Something has occurred to me which may not have occurred to you, and I give you the benefit of my idea. Your cousin did you once a great service. Have you never guessed it?""




""He has done me many services.""




""Yes; but one was much above the rest. He made you a rich woman.""




""He  made me—?"""|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"
"ap 02:00"|"two o'clock"|"It was not with surprise, it was with a feeling which in other circumstances would have had much of the effect of joy, that as Isabel descended from the Paris Mail at Charing Cross she stepped into the arms, as it were—or at any rate into the hands—of Henrietta Stackpole. She had telegraphed to her friend from Turin, and though she had not definitely said to herself that Henrietta would meet her, she had felt her telegram would produce some helpful result. On her long journey from Rome her mind had been given up to vagueness; she was unable to question the future. She performed this journey with sightless eyes and took little pleasure in the countries she traversed, decked out though they were in the richest freshness of spring. Her thoughts followed their course through other countries—strange-looking, dimly-lighted, pathless lands, in which there was no change of seasons, but only, as it seemed, a perpetual dreariness of winter. She had plenty to think about; but it was neither reflexion nor conscious purpose that filled her mind. Disconnected visions passed through it, and sudden dull gleams of memory, of expectation. The past and the future came and went at their will, but she saw them only in fitful images, which rose and fell by a logic of their own. It was extraordinary the things she remembered. Now that she was in the secret, now that she knew something that so much concerned her and the eclipse of which had made life resemble an attempt to play whist with an imperfect pack of cards, the truth of things, their mutual relations, their meaning, and for the most part their horror, rose before her with a kind of architectural vastness. She remembered a thousand trifles; they started to life with the spontaneity of a shiver. She had thought them trifles at the time; now she saw that they had been weighted with lead. Yet even now they were trifles after all, for of what use was it to her to understand them? Nothing seemed of use to her to-day. All purpose, all intention, was suspended; all desire too save the single desire to reach her much-embracing refuge. Gardencourt had been her starting-point, and to those muffled chambers it was at least a temporary solution to return. She had gone forth in her strength; she would come back in her weakness, and if the place had been a rest to her before, it would be a sanctuary now. She envied Ralph his dying, for if one were thinking of rest that was the most perfect of all. To cease utterly, to give it all up and not know anything more—this idea was as sweet as the vision of a cool bath in a marble tank, in a darkened chamber, in a hot land.




She had moments indeed in her journey from Rome which were almost as good as being dead. She sat in her corner, so motionless, so passive, simply with the sense of being carried, so detached from hope and regret, that she recalled to herself one of those Etruscan figures couched upon the receptacle of their ashes. There was nothing to regret now—that was all over. Not only the time of her folly, but the time of her repentance was far. The only thing to regret was that Madame Merle had been so—well, so unimaginable. Just here her intelligence dropped, from literal inability to say what it was that Madame Merle had been. Whatever it was it was for Madame Merle herself to regret it; and doubtless she would do so in America, where she had announced she was going. It concerned Isabel no more; she only had an impression that she should never again see Madame Merle. This impression carried her into the future, of which from time to time she had a mutilated glimpse. She saw herself, in the distant years, still in the attitude of a woman who had her life to live, and these intimations contradicted the spirit of the present hour. It might be desirable to get quite away, really away, further away than little grey-green England, but this privilege was evidently to be denied her. Deep in her soul—deeper than any appetite for renunciation—was the sense that life would be her business for a long time to come. And at moments there was something inspiring, almost enlivening, in the conviction. It was a proof of strength—it was a proof she should some day be happy again. It couldn't be she was to live only to suffer; she was still young, after all, and a great many things might happen to her yet. To live only to suffer—only to feel the injury of life repeated and enlarged—it seemed to her she was too valuable, too capable, for that. Then she wondered if it were vain and stupid to think so well of herself. When had it even been a guarantee to be valuable? Wasn't all history full of the destruction of precious things? Wasn't it much more probable that if one were fine one would suffer? It involved then perhaps an admission that one had a certain grossness; but Isabel recognised, as it passed before her eyes, the quick vague shadow of a long future. She should never escape; she should last to the end. Then the middle years wrapped her about again and the grey curtain of her indifference closed her in.




Henrietta kissed her, as Henrietta usually kissed, as if she were afraid she should be caught doing it; and then Isabel stood there in the crowd, looking about her, looking for her servant. She asked nothing; she wished to wait. She had a sudden perception that she should be helped. She rejoiced Henrietta had come; there was something terrible in an arrival in London. The dusky, smoky, far-arching vault of the station, the strange, livid light, the dense, dark, pushing crowd, filled her with a nervous fear and made her put her arm into her friend's. She remembered she had once liked these things; they seemed part of a mighty spectacle in which there was something that touched her. She remembered how she walked away from Euston, in the winter dusk, in the crowded streets, five years before. She could not have done that to-day, and the incident came before her as the deed of another person.




""It's too beautiful that you should have come,"" said Henrietta, looking at her as if she thought Isabel might be prepared to challenge the proposition. ""If you hadn't—if you hadn't; well, I don't know,"" remarked Miss Stackpole, hinting ominously at her powers of disapproval.




Isabel looked about without seeing her maid. Her eyes rested on another figure, however, which she felt she had seen before; and in a moment she recognised the genial countenance of Mr. Bantling. He stood a little apart, and it was not in the power of the multitude that pressed about him to make him yield an inch of the ground he had taken—that of abstracting himself discreetly while the two ladies performed their embraces.




""There's Mr. Bantling,"" said Isabel, gently, irrelevantly, scarcely caring much now whether she should find her maid or not.




""Oh yes, he goes everywhere with me. Come here, Mr. Bantling!"" Henrietta exclaimed. Whereupon the gallant bachelor advanced with a smile—a smile tempered, however, by the gravity of the occasion. ""Isn't it lovely she has come?"" Henrietta asked. ""He knows all about it,"" she added; ""we had quite a discussion. He said you wouldn't, I said you would.""




""I thought you always agreed,"" Isabel smiled in return. She felt she could smile now; she had seen in an instant, in Mr. Bantling's brave eyes, that he had good news for her. They seemed to say he wished her to remember he was an old friend of her cousin—that he understood, that it was all right. Isabel gave him her hand; she thought of him, extravagantly, as a beautiful blameless knight.




""Oh, I always agree,"" said Mr. Bantling. ""But she doesn't, you know.""




""Didn't I tell you that a maid was a nuisance?"" Henrietta enquired. ""Your young lady has probably remained at Calais.""




""I don't care,"" said Isabel, looking at Mr. Bantling, whom she had never found so interesting.




""Stay with her while I go and see,"" Henrietta commanded, leaving the two for a moment together.




They stood there at first in silence, and then Mr. Bantling asked Isabel how it had been on the Channel.




""Very fine. No, I believe it was very rough,"" she said, to her companion's obvious surprise. After which she added: ""You've been to Gardencourt, I know.""




""Now how do you know that?""




""I can't tell you—except that you look like a person who has been to Gardencourt.""




""Do you think I look awfully sad? It's awfully sad there, you know.""




""I don't believe you ever look awfully sad. You look awfully kind,"" said Isabel with a breadth that cost her no effort. It seemed to her she should never again feel a superficial embarrassment.




Poor Mr. Bantling, however, was still in this inferior stage. He blushed a good deal and laughed, he assured her that he was often very blue, and that when he was blue he was awfully fierce. ""You can ask Miss Stackpole, you know. I was at Gardencourt two days ago.""




""Did you see my cousin?""




""Only for a little. But he had been seeing people; Warburton had been there the day before. Ralph was just the same as usual, except that he was in bed and that he looks tremendously ill and that he can't speak,"" Mr. Bantling pursued. ""He was awfully jolly and funny all the same. He was just as clever as ever. It's awfully wretched.""




Even in the crowded, noisy station this simple picture was vivid. ""Was that late in the day?""




""Yes; I went on purpose. We thought you'd like to know.""




""I'm greatly obliged to you. Can I go down tonight?""




""Ah, I don't think she'll  let you go,"" said Mr. Bantling. ""She wants you to stop with her. I made Touchett's man promise to telegraph me to-day, and I found the telegram an hour ago at my club. 'Quiet and easy,' that's what it says, and it's dated two o'clock. So you see you can wait till to-morrow. You must be awfully tired."""|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"""Yes, I'm awfully tired. And I thank you again.""




""Oh,"" said Mr. Bantling, ""We were certain you would like the last news."" On which Isabel vaguely noted that he and Henrietta seemed after all to agree. Miss Stackpole came back with Isabel's maid, whom she had caught in the act of proving her utility. This excellent person, instead of losing herself in the crowd, had simply attended to her mistress's luggage, so that the latter was now at liberty to leave the station. ""You know you're not to think of going to the country to-night,"" Henrietta remarked to her. ""It doesn't matter whether there's a train or not. You're to come straight to me in Wimpole Street. There isn't a corner to be had in London, but I've got you one all the same. It isn't a Roman palace, but it will do for a night.""




""I'll do whatever you wish,"" Isabel said.




""You'll come and answer a few questions; that's what I wish.""




""She doesn't say anything about dinner, does she, Mrs. Osmond?"" Mr. Bantling enquired jocosely.




Henrietta fixed him a moment with her speculative gaze. ""I see you're in a great hurry to get your own. You'll be at the Paddington Station to-morrow morning at ten.""




""Don't come for my sake, Mr. Bantling,"" said Isabel.




""He'll come for mine,"" Henrietta declared as she ushered her friend into a cab. And later, in a large dusky parlour in Wimpole Street—to do her justice there had been dinner enough—she asked those questions to which she had alluded at the station. ""Did your husband make you a scene about your coming?"" That was Miss Stackpole's first enquiry.




""No; I can't say he made a scene.""




""He didn't object then?""




""Yes, he objected very much. But it was not what you'd call a scene.""




""What was it then?""




""It was a very quiet conversation.""




Henrietta for a moment regarded her guest. ""It must have been hellish,"" she then remarked. And Isabel didn't deny that it had been hellish. But she confined herself to answering Henrietta's questions, which was easy, as they were tolerably definite. For the present she offered her no new information. ""Well,"" said Miss Stackpole at last, ""I've only one criticism to make. I don't see why you promised little Miss Osmond to go back.""




""I'm not sure I myself see now,"" Isabel replied. ""But I did then.""




""If you've forgotten your reason perhaps you won't return.""




Isabel waited a moment. ""Perhaps I shall find another.""




""You'll certainly never find a good one.""




""In default of a better my having promised will do,"" Isabel suggested.




""Yes; that's why I hate it.""




""Don't speak of it now. I've a little time. Coming away was a complication, but what will going back be?""




""You must remember, after all, that he won't make you a scene!"" said Henrietta with much intention.




""He will, though,"" Isabel answered gravely. ""It won't be the scene of a moment; it will be a scene of the rest of my life.""




For some minutes the two women sat and considered this remainder, and then Miss Stackpole, to change the subject, as Isabel had requested, announced abruptly: ""I've been to stay with Lady Pensil!""




""Ah, the invitation came at last!""




""Yes; it took five years. But this time she wanted to see me.""




""Naturally enough.""




""It was more natural than I think you know,"" said Henrietta, who fixed her eyes on a distant point. And then she added, turning suddenly: ""Isabel Archer, I beg your pardon. You don't know why? Because I criticised you, and yet I've gone further than you. Mr. Osmond, at least, was born on the other side!""




It was a moment before Isabel grasped her meaning; this sense was so modestly, or at least so ingeniously, veiled. Isabel's mind was not possessed at present with the comicality of things; but she greeted with a quick laugh the image that her companion had raised. She immediately recovered herself, however, and with the right excess of intensity, ""Henrietta Stackpole,"" she asked, ""are you going to give up your country?""




""Yes, my poor Isabel, I am. I won't pretend to deny it; I look the fact: in the face. I'm going to marry Mr. Bantling and locate right here in London.""




""It seems very strange,"" said Isabel, smiling now.




""Well yes, I suppose it does. I've come to it little by little. I think I know what I'm doing; but I don't know as I can explain.""




""One can't explain one's marriage,"" Isabel answered. ""And yours doesn't need to be explained. Mr. Bantling isn't a riddle.""




""No, he isn't a bad pun—or even a high flight of American humour. He has a beautiful nature,"" Henrietta went on. ""I've studied him for many years and I see right through him. He's as clear as the style of a good prospectus. He's not intellectual, but he appreciates intellect. On the other hand he doesn't exaggerate its claims. I sometimes think we do in the United States.""




""Ah,"" said Isabel, ""you're changed indeed! It's the first time I've ever heard you say anything against your native land.""




""I only say that we're too infatuated with mere brain-power; that, after all, isn't a vulgar fault. But I AM changed; a woman has to change a good deal to marry.""




""I hope you'll be very happy. You will at last—over here—see something of the inner life.""




Henrietta gave a little significant sigh. ""That's the key to the mystery, I believe. I couldn't endure to be kept off. Now I've as good a right as any one!"" she added with artless elation. Isabel was duly diverted, but there was a certain melancholy in her view. Henrietta, after all, had confessed herself human and feminine, Henrietta whom she had hitherto regarded as a light keen flame, a disembodied voice. It was a disappointment to find she had personal susceptibilities, that she was subject to common passions, and that her intimacy with Mr. Bantling had not been completely original. There was a want of originality in her marrying him—there was even a kind of stupidity; and for a moment, to Isabel's sense, the dreariness of the world took on a deeper tinge. A little later indeed she reflected that Mr. Bantling himself at least was original. But she didn't see how Henrietta could give up her country. She herself had relaxed her hold of it, but it had never been her country as it had been Henrietta's. She presently asked her if she had enjoyed her visit to Lady Pensil.




""Oh yes,"" said Henrietta, ""she didn't know what to make of me.""




""And was that very enjoyable?""




""Very much so, because she's supposed to be a master mind. She thinks she knows everything; but she doesn't understand a woman of my modern type. It would be so much easier for her if I were only a little better or a little worse. She's so puzzled; I believe she thinks it's my duty to go and do something immoral. She thinks it's immoral that I should marry her brother; but, after all, that isn't immoral enough. And she'll never understand my mixture—never!""




""She's not so intelligent as her brother then,"" said Isabel. ""He appears to have understood.""




""Oh no, he hasn't!"" cried Miss Stackpole with decision. ""I really believe that's what he wants to marry me for—just to find out the mystery and the proportions of it. That's a fixed idea—a kind of fascination.""




""It's very good in you to humour it.""




""Oh well,"" said Henrietta, ""I've something to find out too!"" And Isabel saw that she had not renounced an allegiance, but planned an attack. She was at last about to grapple in earnest with England.




Isabel also perceived, however, on the morrow, at the Paddington Station, where she found herself, at ten o'clock, in the company both of Miss Stackpole and Mr. Bantling, that the gentleman bore his perplexities lightly. If he had not found out everything he had found out at least the great point—that Miss Stackpole would not be wanting in initiative. It was evident that in the selection of a wife he had been on his guard against this deficiency.




""Henrietta has told me, and I'm very glad,"" Isabel said as she gave him her hand.




""I dare say you think it awfully odd,"" Mr. Bantling replied, resting on his neat umbrella.




""Yes, I think it awfully odd.""




""You can't think it so awfully odd as I do. But I've always rather liked striking out a line,"" said Mr. Bantling serenely."|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o'clock"|"""Yes, I'm awfully tired. And I thank you again.""




""Oh,"" said Mr. Bantling, ""We were certain you would like the last news."" On which Isabel vaguely noted that he and Henrietta seemed after all to agree. Miss Stackpole came back with Isabel's maid, whom she had caught in the act of proving her utility. This excellent person, instead of losing herself in the crowd, had simply attended to her mistress's luggage, so that the latter was now at liberty to leave the station. ""You know you're not to think of going to the country to-night,"" Henrietta remarked to her. ""It doesn't matter whether there's a train or not. You're to come straight to me in Wimpole Street. There isn't a corner to be had in London, but I've got you one all the same. It isn't a Roman palace, but it will do for a night.""




""I'll do whatever you wish,"" Isabel said.




""You'll come and answer a few questions; that's what I wish.""




""She doesn't say anything about dinner, does she, Mrs. Osmond?"" Mr. Bantling enquired jocosely.




Henrietta fixed him a moment with her speculative gaze. ""I see you're in a great hurry to get your own. You'll be at the Paddington Station to-morrow morning at ten.""




""Don't come for my sake, Mr. Bantling,"" said Isabel.




""He'll come for mine,"" Henrietta declared as she ushered her friend into a cab. And later, in a large dusky parlour in Wimpole Street—to do her justice there had been dinner enough—she asked those questions to which she had alluded at the station. ""Did your husband make you a scene about your coming?"" That was Miss Stackpole's first enquiry.




""No; I can't say he made a scene.""




""He didn't object then?""




""Yes, he objected very much. But it was not what you'd call a scene.""




""What was it then?""




""It was a very quiet conversation.""




Henrietta for a moment regarded her guest. ""It must have been hellish,"" she then remarked. And Isabel didn't deny that it had been hellish. But she confined herself to answering Henrietta's questions, which was easy, as they were tolerably definite. For the present she offered her no new information. ""Well,"" said Miss Stackpole at last, ""I've only one criticism to make. I don't see why you promised little Miss Osmond to go back.""




""I'm not sure I myself see now,"" Isabel replied. ""But I did then.""




""If you've forgotten your reason perhaps you won't return.""




Isabel waited a moment. ""Perhaps I shall find another.""




""You'll certainly never find a good one.""




""In default of a better my having promised will do,"" Isabel suggested.




""Yes; that's why I hate it.""




""Don't speak of it now. I've a little time. Coming away was a complication, but what will going back be?""




""You must remember, after all, that he won't make you a scene!"" said Henrietta with much intention.




""He will, though,"" Isabel answered gravely. ""It won't be the scene of a moment; it will be a scene of the rest of my life.""




For some minutes the two women sat and considered this remainder, and then Miss Stackpole, to change the subject, as Isabel had requested, announced abruptly: ""I've been to stay with Lady Pensil!""




""Ah, the invitation came at last!""




""Yes; it took five years. But this time she wanted to see me.""




""Naturally enough.""




""It was more natural than I think you know,"" said Henrietta, who fixed her eyes on a distant point. And then she added, turning suddenly: ""Isabel Archer, I beg your pardon. You don't know why? Because I criticised you, and yet I've gone further than you. Mr. Osmond, at least, was born on the other side!""




It was a moment before Isabel grasped her meaning; this sense was so modestly, or at least so ingeniously, veiled. Isabel's mind was not possessed at present with the comicality of things; but she greeted with a quick laugh the image that her companion had raised. She immediately recovered herself, however, and with the right excess of intensity, ""Henrietta Stackpole,"" she asked, ""are you going to give up your country?""




""Yes, my poor Isabel, I am. I won't pretend to deny it; I look the fact: in the face. I'm going to marry Mr. Bantling and locate right here in London.""




""It seems very strange,"" said Isabel, smiling now.




""Well yes, I suppose it does. I've come to it little by little. I think I know what I'm doing; but I don't know as I can explain.""




""One can't explain one's marriage,"" Isabel answered. ""And yours doesn't need to be explained. Mr. Bantling isn't a riddle.""




""No, he isn't a bad pun—or even a high flight of American humour. He has a beautiful nature,"" Henrietta went on. ""I've studied him for many years and I see right through him. He's as clear as the style of a good prospectus. He's not intellectual, but he appreciates intellect. On the other hand he doesn't exaggerate its claims. I sometimes think we do in the United States.""




""Ah,"" said Isabel, ""you're changed indeed! It's the first time I've ever heard you say anything against your native land.""




""I only say that we're too infatuated with mere brain-power; that, after all, isn't a vulgar fault. But I AM changed; a woman has to change a good deal to marry.""




""I hope you'll be very happy. You will at last—over here—see something of the inner life.""




Henrietta gave a little significant sigh. ""That's the key to the mystery, I believe. I couldn't endure to be kept off. Now I've as good a right as any one!"" she added with artless elation. Isabel was duly diverted, but there was a certain melancholy in her view. Henrietta, after all, had confessed herself human and feminine, Henrietta whom she had hitherto regarded as a light keen flame, a disembodied voice. It was a disappointment to find she had personal susceptibilities, that she was subject to common passions, and that her intimacy with Mr. Bantling had not been completely original. There was a want of originality in her marrying him—there was even a kind of stupidity; and for a moment, to Isabel's sense, the dreariness of the world took on a deeper tinge. A little later indeed she reflected that Mr. Bantling himself at least was original. But she didn't see how Henrietta could give up her country. She herself had relaxed her hold of it, but it had never been her country as it had been Henrietta's. She presently asked her if she had enjoyed her visit to Lady Pensil.




""Oh yes,"" said Henrietta, ""she didn't know what to make of me.""




""And was that very enjoyable?""




""Very much so, because she's supposed to be a master mind. She thinks she knows everything; but she doesn't understand a woman of my modern type. It would be so much easier for her if I were only a little better or a little worse. She's so puzzled; I believe she thinks it's my duty to go and do something immoral. She thinks it's immoral that I should marry her brother; but, after all, that isn't immoral enough. And she'll never understand my mixture—never!""




""She's not so intelligent as her brother then,"" said Isabel. ""He appears to have understood.""




""Oh no, he hasn't!"" cried Miss Stackpole with decision. ""I really believe that's what he wants to marry me for—just to find out the mystery and the proportions of it. That's a fixed idea—a kind of fascination.""




""It's very good in you to humour it.""




""Oh well,"" said Henrietta, ""I've something to find out too!"" And Isabel saw that she had not renounced an allegiance, but planned an attack. She was at last about to grapple in earnest with England.




Isabel also perceived, however, on the morrow, at the Paddington Station, where she found herself, at ten o'clock, in the company both of Miss Stackpole and Mr. Bantling, that the gentleman bore his perplexities lightly. If he had not found out everything he had found out at least the great point—that Miss Stackpole would not be wanting in initiative. It was evident that in the selection of a wife he had been on his guard against this deficiency.




""Henrietta has told me, and I'm very glad,"" Isabel said as she gave him her hand.




""I dare say you think it awfully odd,"" Mr. Bantling replied, resting on his neat umbrella.




""Yes, I think it awfully odd.""

12:00|midday|"Isabel's arrival at Gardencourt on this second occasion was even quieter than it had been on the first. Ralph Touchett kept but a small household, and to the new servants Mrs. Osmond was a stranger; so that instead of being conducted to her own apartment she was coldly shown into the drawing-room and left to wait while her name was carried up to her aunt. She waited a long time; Mrs. Touchett appeared in no hurry to come to her. She grew impatient at last; she grew nervous and scared—as scared as if the objects about her had begun to show for conscious things, watching her trouble with grotesque grimaces. The day was dark and cold; the dusk was thick in the corners of the wide brown rooms. The house was perfectly still—with a stillness that Isabel remembered; it had filled all the place for days before the death of her uncle. She left the drawing-room and wandered about—strolled into the library and along the gallery of pictures, where, in the deep silence, her footstep made an echo. Nothing was changed; she recognised everything she had seen years before; it might have been only yesterday she had stood there. She envied the security of valuable ""pieces"" which change by no hair's breadth, only grow in value, while their owners lose inch by inch youth, happiness, beauty; and she became aware that she was walking about as her aunt had done on the day she had come to see her in Albany. She was changed enough since then—that had been the beginning. It suddenly struck her that if her Aunt Lydia had not come that day in just that way and found her alone, everything might have been different. She might have had another life and she might have been a woman more blest. She stopped in the gallery in front of a small picture—a charming and precious Bonington—upon which her eyes rested a long time. But she was not looking at the picture; she was wondering whether if her aunt had not come that day in Albany she would have married Caspar Goodwood.




Mrs. Touchett appeared at last, just after Isabel had returned to the big uninhabited drawing-room. She looked a good deal older, but her eye was as bright as ever and her head as erect; her thin lips seemed a repository of latent meanings. She wore a little grey dress of the most undecorated fashion, and Isabel wondered, as she had wondered the first time, if her remarkable kinswoman resembled more a queen-regent or the matron of a gaol. Her lips felt very thin indeed on Isabel's hot cheek.




""I've kept you waiting because I've been sitting with Ralph,"" Mrs. Touchett said. ""The nurse had gone to luncheon and I had taken her place. He has a man who's supposed to look after him, but the man's good for nothing; he's always looking out of the window—as if there were anything to see! I didn't wish to move, because Ralph seemed to be sleeping and I was afraid the sound would disturb him. I waited till the nurse came back. I remembered you knew the house.""




""I find I know it better even than I thought; I've been walking everywhere,"" Isabel answered. And then she asked if Ralph slept much.




""He lies with his eyes closed; he doesn't move. But I'm not sure that it's always sleep.""




""Will he see me? Can he speak to me?""




Mrs. Touchett declined the office of saying. ""You can try him,"" was the limit of her extravagance. And then she offered to conduct Isabel to her room. ""I thought they had taken you there; but it's not my house, it's Ralph's; and I don't know what they do. They must at least have taken your luggage; I don't suppose you've brought much. Not that I care, however. I believe they've given you the same room you had before; when Ralph heard you were coming he said you must have that one.""




""Did he say anything else?""




""Ah, my dear, he doesn't chatter as he used!"" cried Mrs. Touchett as she preceded her niece up the staircase.




It was the same room, and something told Isabel it had not been slept in since she occupied it. Her luggage was there and was not voluminous; Mrs. Touchett sat down a moment with her eyes upon it. ""Is there really no hope?"" our young woman asked as she stood before her.




""None whatever. There never has been. It has not been a successful life.""




""No—it has only been a beautiful one."" Isabel found herself already contradicting her aunt; she was irritated by her dryness.




""I don't know what you mean by that; there's no beauty without health. That is a very odd dress to travel in.""




Isabel glanced at her garment. ""I left Rome at an hour's notice; I took the first that came.""




""Your sisters, in America, wished to know how you dress. That seemed to be their principal interest. I wasn't able to tell them —but they seemed to have the right idea: that you never wear anything less than black brocade.""




""They think I'm more brilliant than I am; I'm afraid to tell them the truth,"" said Isabel. ""Lily wrote me you had dined with her.""




""She invited me four times, and I went once. After the second time she should have let me alone. The dinner was very good; it must have been expensive. Her husband has a very bad manner. Did I enjoy my visit to America? Why should I have enjoyed it? I didn't go for my pleasure.""




These were interesting items, but Mrs. Touchett soon left her niece, whom she was to meet in half an hour at the midday meal. For this repast the two ladies faced each other at an abbreviated table in the melancholy dining-room. Here, after a little, Isabel saw her aunt not to be so dry as she appeared, and her old pity for the poor woman's inexpressiveness, her want of regret, of disappointment, came back to her. Unmistakeably she would have found it a blessing to-day to be able to feel a defeat, a mistake, even a shame or two. She wondered if she were not even missing those enrichments of consciousness and privately trying—reaching out for some aftertaste of life, dregs of the banquet; the testimony of pain or the cold recreation of remorse. On the other hand perhaps she was afraid; if she should begin to know remorse at all it might take her too far. Isabel could perceive, however, how it had come over her dimly that she had failed of something, that she saw herself in the future as an old woman without memories. Her little sharp face looked tragical. She told her niece that Ralph had as yet not moved, but that he probably would be able to see her before dinner. And then in a moment she added that he had seen Lord Warburton the day before; an announcement which startled Isabel a little, as it seemed an intimation that this personage was in the neighbourhood and that an accident might bring them together. Such an accident would not be happy; she had not come to England to struggle again with Lord Warburton. She none the less presently said to her aunt that he had been very kind to Ralph; she had seen something of that in Rome.




""He has something else to think of now,"" Mrs. Touchett returned. And she paused with a gaze like a gimlet.




Isabel saw she meant something, and instantly guessed what she meant. But her reply concealed her guess; her heart beat faster and she wished to gain a moment. ""Ah yes—the House of Lords and all that.""




""He's not thinking of the Lords; he's thinking of the ladies. At least he's thinking of one of them; he told Ralph he's engaged to be married.""




""Ah, to be married!"" Isabel mildly exclaimed.




""Unless he breaks it off. He seemed to think Ralph would like to know. Poor Ralph can't go to the wedding, though I believe it's to take place very soon.




""And who's the young lady?""




""A member of the aristocracy; Lady Flora, Lady Felicia—something of that sort.""




""I'm very glad,"" Isabel said. ""It must be a sudden decision.""




""Sudden enough, I believe; a courtship of three weeks. It has only just been made public.""




""I'm very glad,"" Isabel repeated with a larger emphasis. She knew her aunt was watching her—looking for the signs of some imputed soreness, and the desire to prevent her companion from seeing anything of this kind enabled her to speak in the tone of quick satisfaction, the tone almost of relief. Mrs. Touchett of course followed the tradition that ladies, even married ones, regard the marriage of their old lovers as an offence to themselves. Isabel's first care therefore was to show that however that might be in general she was not offended now. But meanwhile, as I say, her heart beat faster; and if she sat for some moments thoughtful —she presently forgot Mrs. Touchett's observation—it was not because she had lost an admirer. Her imagination had traversed half Europe; it halted, panting, and even trembling a little, in the city of Rome. She figured herself announcing to her husband that Lord Warburton was to lead a bride to the altar, and she was of course not aware how extremely wan she must have looked while she made this intellectual effort. But at last she collected herself and said to her aunt: ""He was sure to do it some time or other.""




Mrs. Touchett was silent; then she gave a sharp little shake of the head. ""Ah, my dear, you're beyond me!"" she cried suddenly. They went on with their luncheon in silence; Isabel felt as if she had heard of Lord Warburton's death. She had known him only as a suitor, and now that was all over. He was dead for poor Pansy; by Pansy he might have lived. A servant had been hovering about; at last Mrs. Touchett requested him to leave them alone. She had finished her meal; she sat with her hands folded on the edge of the table. ""I should like to ask you three questions,"" she observed when the servant had gone.




""Three are a great many.""




""I can't do with less; I've been thinking. They're all very good ones.""




""That's what I'm afraid of. The best questions are the worst,"" Isabel answered. Mrs. Touchett had pushed back her chair, and as her niece left the table and walked, rather consciously, to one of the deep windows, she felt herself followed by her eyes.




""Have you ever been sorry you didn't marry Lord Warburton?"" Mrs. Touchett enquired.




Isabel shook her head slowly, but not heavily. ""No, dear aunt.""




""Good. I ought to tell you that I propose to believe what you say.""




""Your believing me's an immense temptation,"" she declared, smiling still.




""A temptation to lie? I don't recommend you to do that, for when I'm misinformed I'm as dangerous as a poisoned rat. I don't mean to crow over you.""




""It's my husband who doesn't get on with me,"" said Isabel.




""I could have told him he wouldn't. I don't call that crowing over you,"" Mrs. Touchett added. ""Do you still like Serena Merle?"" she went on."|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"
00:00|midnight|"""Not as I once did. But it doesn't matter, for she's going to America.""




""To America? She must have done something very bad.""




""Yes—very bad.""




""May I ask what it is?""




""She made a convenience of me.""




""Ah,"" cried Mrs. Touchett, ""so she did of me! She does of every one.""




""She'll make a convenience of America,"" said Isabel, smiling again and glad that her aunt's questions were over.




It was not till the evening that she was able to see Ralph. He had been dozing all day; at least he had been lying unconscious. The doctor was there, but after a while went away—the local doctor, who had attended his father and whom Ralph liked. He came three or four times a day; he was deeply interested in his patient. Ralph had had Sir Matthew Hope, but he had got tired of this celebrated man, to whom he had asked his mother to send word he was now dead and was therefore without further need of medical advice. Mrs. Touchett had simply written to Sir Matthew that her son disliked him. On the day of Isabel's arrival Ralph gave no sign, as I have related, for many hours; but toward evening he raised himself and said he knew that she had come.




How he knew was not apparent, inasmuch as for fear of exciting him no one had offered the information. Isabel came in and sat by his bed in the dim light; there was only a shaded candle in a corner of the room. She told the nurse she might go—she herself would sit with him for the rest of the evening. He had opened his eyes and recognised her, and had moved his hand, which lay helpless beside him, so that she might take it. But he was unable to speak; he closed his eyes again and remained perfectly still, only keeping her hand in his own. She sat with him a long time—till the nurse came back; but he gave no further sign. He might have passed away while she looked at him; he was already the figure and pattern of death. She had thought him far gone in Rome, and this was worse; there was but one change possible now. There was a strange tranquillity in his face; it was as still as the lid of a box. With this he was a mere lattice of bones; when he opened his eyes to greet her it was as if she were looking into immeasurable space. It was not till midnight that the nurse came back; but the hours, to Isabel, had not seemed long; it was exactly what she had come for. If she had come simply to wait she found ample occasion, for he lay three days in a kind of grateful silence. He recognised her and at moments seemed to wish to speak; but he found no voice. Then he closed his eyes again, as if he too were waiting for something—for something that certainly would come. He was so absolutely quiet that it seemed to her what was coming had already arrived; and yet she never lost the sense that they were still together. But they were not always together; there were other hours that she passed in wandering through the empty house and listening for a voice that was not poor Ralph's. She had a constant fear; she thought it possible her husband would write to her. But he remained silent, and she only got a letter from Florence and from the Countess Gemini. Ralph, however, spoke at last—on the evening of the third day.




""I feel better to-night,"" he murmured, abruptly, in the soundless dimness of her vigil; ""I think I can say something."" She sank upon her knees beside his pillow; took his thin hand in her own; begged him not to make an effort—not to tire himself. His face was of necessity se rious—it was incapable of the muscular play of a smile; but its owner apparently had not lost a perception of incongruities. ""What does it matter if I'm tired when I've all eternity to rest? There's no harm in making an effort when it's the very last of all. Don't people always feel better just before the end? I've often heard of that; it's what I was waiting for. Ever since you've been here I thought it would come. I tried two or three times; I was afraid you'd get tired of sitting there."" He spoke slowly, with painful breaks and long pauses; his voice seemed to come from a distance. When he ceased he lay with his face turned to Isabel and his large unwinking eyes open into her own. ""It was very good of you to come,"" he went on. ""I thought you would; but I wasn't sure.""




""I was not sure either till I came,"" said Isabel.




""You've been like an angel beside my bed. You know they talk about the angel of death. It's the most beautiful of all. You've been like that; as if you were waiting for me.""




""I was not waiting for your death; I was waiting for—for this. This is not death, dear Ralph.""




""Not for you—no. There's nothing makes us feel so much alive as to see others die. That's the sensation of life—the sense that we remain. I've had it—even I. But now I'm of no use but to give it to others. With me it's all over."" And then he paused. Isabel bowed her head further, till it rested on the two hands that were clasped upon his own. She couldn't see him now; but his far-away voice was close to her ear. ""Isabel,"" he went on suddenly, ""I wish it were over for you."" She answered nothing; she had burst into sobs; she remained so, with her buried face. He lay silent, listening to her sobs; at last he gave a long groan. ""Ah, what is it you have done for me?""




""What is it you did for me?"" she cried, her now extreme agitation half smothered by her attitude. She had lost all her shame, all wish to hide things. Now he must know; she wished him to know, for it brought them supremely together, and he was beyond the reach of pain. ""You did something once—you know it. O Ralph, you've been everything! What have I done for you—what can I do to-day? I would die if you could live. But I don't wish you to live; I would die myself, not to lose you."" Her voice was as broken as his own and full of tears and anguish.




""You won't lose me—you'll keep me. Keep me in your heart; I shall be nearer to you than I've ever been. Dear Isabel, life is better; for in life there's love. Death is good—but there's no love.""




""I never thanked you—I never spoke—I never was what I should be!"" Isabel went on. She felt a passionate need to cry out and accuse herself, to let her sorrow possess her. All her troubles, for the moment, became single and melted together into this present pain. ""What must you have thought of me? Yet how could I know? I never knew, and I only know to-day because there are people less stupid than I.""




""Don't mind people,"" said Ralph. ""I think I'm glad to leave people.""




She raised her head and her clasped hands; she seemed for a moment to pray to him. ""Is it true—is it true?"" she asked.




""True that you've been stupid? Oh no,"" said Ralph with a sensible intention of wit.




""That you made me rich—that all I have is yours?""




He turned away his head, and for some time said nothing. Then at last: ""Ah, don't speak of that—that was not happy."" Slowly he moved his face toward her again, and they once more saw each other. ""But for that—but for that—!"" And he paused. ""I believe I ruined you,"" he wailed.




She was full of the sense that he was beyond the reach of pain; he seemed already so little of this world. But even if she had not had it she would still have spoken, for nothing mattered now but the only knowledge that was not pure anguish—the knowledge that they were looking at the truth together.




""He married me for the money,"" she said. She wished to say everything; she was afraid he might die before she had done so. He gazed at her a little, and for the first time his fixed eyes lowered their lids. But he raised them in a moment, and then, ""He was greatly in love with you,"" he answered.




""Yes, he was in love with me. But he wouldn't have married me if I had been poor. I don't hurt you in saying that. How can I? I only want you to understand. I always tried to keep you from understanding; but that's all over.""




""I always understood,"" said Ralph.




""I thought you did, and I didn't like it. But now I like it.""




""You don't hurt me—you make me very happy."" And as Ralph said this there was an extraordinary gladness in his voice. She bent her head again, and pressed her lips to the back of his hand. ""I always understood,"" he continued, ""though it was so strange—so pitiful. You wanted to look at life for yourself—but you were not allowed; you were punished for your wish. You were ground in the very mill of the conventional!""




""Oh yes, I've been punished,"" Isabel sobbed.




He listened to her a little, and then continued: ""Was he very bad about your coming?""




""He made it very hard for me. But I don't care.""




""It is all over then between you?""




""Oh no; I don't think anything's over.""




""Are you going back to him ?"" Ralph gasped.




""I don't know—I can't tell. I shall stay here as long as I may. I don't want to think—I needn't think. I don't care for anything but you, and that's enough for the present. It will last a little yet. Here on my knees, with you dying in my arms, I'm happier than I have been for a long time. And I want you to be happy—not to think of anything sad; only to feel that I'm near you and I love you. Why should there be pain—? In such hours as this what have we to do with pain? That's not the deepest thing; there's something deeper.""




Ralph evidently found from moment to moment greater difficulty in speaking; he had to wait longer to collect himself. At first he appeared to make no response to these last words; he let a long time elapse. Then he murmured simply: ""You must stay here.""




""I should like to stay—as long as seems right.""




""As seems right— as seems right?"" He repeated her words. ""Yes, you think a great deal about that.""




""Of course one must. You're very tired,"" said Isabel.




""I'm very tired. You said just now that pain's not the deepest thing. No—no. But it's very deep. If I could stay—""




""For me you'll always be here,"" she softly interrupted. It was easy to interrupt him.




But he went on, after a moment: ""It passes, after all; it's passing now. But love remains. I don't know why we should suffer so much. Perhaps I shall find out. There are many things in life. You're very young.""




""I feel very old,"" said Isabel.




""You'll grow young again. That's how I see you. I don't believe—I don't believe—"" But he stopped again; his strength failed him.




She begged him to be quiet now. ""We needn't speak to understand each other,"" she said.




""I don't believe that such a generous mistake as yours can hurt you for more than a little.""




""Oh Ralph, I'm very happy now,"" she cried through her tears.




""And remember this,"" he continued, ""that if you've been hated you've also been loved. Ah but, Isabel—adored !"" he just audibly and lingeringly breathed."|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"
"ap 06:40"|6.40|"He had told her, the first evening she ever spent at Gardencourt, that if she should live to suffer enough she might some day see the ghost with which the old house was duly provided. She apparently had fulfilled the necessary condition; for the next morning, in the cold, faint dawn, she knew that a spirit was standing by her bed. She had lain down without undressing, it being her belief that Ralph would not outlast the night. She had no inclination to sleep; she was waiting, and such waiting was wakeful. But she closed her eyes; she believed that as the night wore on she should hear a knock at her door. She heard no knock, but at the time the darkness began vaguely to grow grey she started up from her pillow as abruptly as if she had received a summons. It seemed to her for an instant that he was standing there—a vague, hovering figure in the vagueness of the room. She stared a moment; she saw his white face—his kind eyes; then she saw there was nothing. She was not afraid; she was only sure. She quitted the place and in her certainty passed through dark corridors and down a flight of oaken steps that shone in the vague light of a hall-window. Outside Ralph's door she stopped a moment, listening, but she seemed to hear only the hush that filled it. She opened the door with a hand as gentle as if she were lifting a veil from the face of the dead, and saw Mrs. Touchett sitting motionless and upright beside the couch of her son, with one of his hands in her own. The doctor was on the other side, with poor Ralph's further wrist resting in his professional fingers. The two nurses were at the foot between them. Mrs. Touchett took no notice of Isabel, but the doctor looked at her very hard; then he gently placed Ralph's hand in a proper position, close beside him. The nurse looked at her very hard too, and no one said a word; but Isabel only looked at what she had come to see. It was fairer than Ralph had ever been in life, and there was a strange resemblance to the face of his father, which, six years before, she had seen lying on the same pillow. She went to her aunt and put her arm around her; and Mrs. Touchett, who as a general thing neither invited nor enjoyed caresses, submitted for a moment to this one, rising, as might be, to take it. But she was stiff and dry-eyed; her acute white face was terrible.




""Dear Aunt Lydia,"" Isabel murmured.




""Go and thank God you've no child,"" said Mrs. Touchett, disengaging herself.




Three days after this a considerable number of people found time, at the height of the London ""season,"" to take a morning train down to a quiet station in Berkshire and spend half an hour in a small grey church which stood within an easy walk. It was in the green burial-place of this edifice that Mrs. Touchett consigned her son to earth. She stood herself at the edge of the grave, and Isabel stood beside her; the sexton himself had not a more practical interest in the scene than Mrs. Touchett. It was a solemn occasion, but neither a harsh nor a heavy one; there was a certain geniality in the appearance of things. The weather had changed to fair; the day, one of the last of the treacherous May-time, was warm and windless, and the air had the brightness of the hawthorn and the blackbird. If it was sad to think of poor Touchett, it was not too sad, since death, for him, had had no vio lence. He had been dying so long; he was so ready; everything had been so expected and prepared. There were tears in Isabel's eyes, but they were not tears that blinded. She looked through them at the beauty of the day, the splendour of nature, the sweetness of the old English churchyard, the bowed heads of good friends. Lord Warburton was there, and a group of gentlemen all unknown to her, several of whom, as she afterwards learned, were connected with the bank; and there were others whom she knew. Miss Stackpole was among the first, with honest Mr. Bantling beside her; and Caspar Goodwood, lifting his head higher than the rest—bowing it rather less. During much of the time Isabel was conscious of Mr. Goodwood's gaze; he looked at her somewhat harder than he usually looked in public, while the others had fixed their eyes upon the churchyard turf. But she never let him see that she saw him; she thought of him only to wonder that he was still in England. She found she had taken for granted that after accompanying Ralph to Gardencourt he had gone away; she remembered how little it was a country that pleased him. He was there, however, very distinctly there; and something in his attitude seemed to say that he was there with a complex intention. She wouldn't meet his eyes, though there was doubtless sympathy in them; he made her rather uneasy. With the dispersal of the little group he disappeared, and the only person who came to speak to her—though several spoke to Mrs. Touchett—was Henrietta Stackpole. Henrietta had been crying.




Ralph had said to Isabel that he hoped she would remain at Gardencourt, and she made no immediate motion to leave the place. She said to herself that it was but common charity to stay a little with her aunt. It was fortunate she had so good a formula; otherwise she might have been greatly in want of one. Her errand was over; she had done what she had left her husband to do. She had a husband in a foreign city, counting the hours of her absence; in such a case one needed an excellent motive. He was not one of the best husbands, but that didn't alter the case. Certain obligations were involved in the very fact of marriage, and were quite independent of the quantity of enjoyment extracted from it. Isabel thought of her husband as little as might be; but now that she was at a distance, beyond its spell, she thought with a kind of spiritual shudder of Rome. There was a penetrating chill in the image, and she drew back into the deepest shade of Gardencourt. She lived from day to day, postponing, closing her eyes, trying not to think. She knew she must decide, but she decided nothing; her coming itself had not been a decision. On that occasion she had simply started. Osmond gave no sound and now evidently would give none; he would leave it all to her. From Pansy she heard nothing, but that was very simple: her father had told her not to write.




Mrs. Touchett accepted Isabel's company, but offered her no assistance; she appeared to be absorbed in considering, without enthusiasm but with perfect lucidity, the new conveniences of her own situation. Mrs. Touchett was not an optimist, but even from painful occurrences she managed to extract a certain utility. This consisted in the reflexion that, after all, such things happened to other people and not to herself. Death was disagreeable, but in this case it was her son's death, not her own; she had never flattered herself that her own would be disagreeable to any one but Mrs. Touchett. She was better off than poor Ralph, who had left all the commodities of life behind him, and indeed all the security; since the worst of dying was, to Mrs. Touchett's mind, that it exposed one to be taken advantage of. For herself she was on the spot; there was nothing so good as that. She made known to Isabel very punctually—it was the evening her son was buried—several of Ralph's testamentary arrangements. He had told her everything, had consulted her about everything. He left her no money; of course she had no need of money. He left her the furniture of Gardencourt, exclusive of the pictures and books and the use of the place for a year; after which it was to be sold. The money produced by the sale was to constitute an endowment for a hospital for poor persons suffering from the malady of which he died; and of this portion of the will Lord Warburton was appointed executor. The rest of his property, which was to be withdrawn from the bank, was disposed of in various bequests, several of them to those cousins in Vermont to whom his father had already been so bountiful. Then there were a number of small legacies.




""Some of them are extremely peculiar,"" said Mrs. Touchett; ""he has left considerable sums to persons I never heard of. He gave me a list, and I asked then who some of them were, and he told me they were people who at various times had seemed to like him. Apparently he thought you didn't like him, for he hasn't left you a penny. It was his opinion that you had been handsomely treated by his father, which I'm bound to say I think you were—though I don't mean that I ever heard him complain of it. The pictures are to be dispersed; he has distributed them about, one by one, as little keepsakes. The most valuable of the collection goes to Lord Warburton. And what do you think he has done with his library? It sounds like a practical joke. He has left it to your friend Miss Stackpole—'in recognition of her services to literature.' Does he mean her following him up from Rome? Was that a service to literature? It contains a great many rare and valuable books, and as she can't carry it about the world in her trunk he recommends her to sell it at auction. She will sell it of course at Christie's, and with the proceeds she'll set up a newspaper. Will that be a service to literature?""




This question Isabel forbore to answer, as it exceeded the little interrogatory to which she had deemed it necessary to submit on her arrival. Besides, she had never been less interested in literature than to-day, as she found when she occasionally took down from the shelf one of the rare and valuable volumes of which Mrs. Touchett had spoken. She was quite unable to read; her attention had never been so little at her command. One afternoon, in the library, about a week after the ceremony in the churchyard, she was trying to fix it for an hour; but her eyes often wandered from the book in her hand to the open window, which looked down the long avenue. It was in this way that she saw a modest vehicle approach the door and perceived Lord Warburton sitting, in rather an uncomfortable attitude, in a corner of it. He had always had a high standard of courtesy, and it was therefore not remarkable, under the circumstances, that he should have taken the trouble to come down from London to call on Mrs. Touchett. It was of course Mrs. Touchett he had come to see, and not Mrs. Osmond; and to prove to herself the validity of this thesis Isabel presently stepped out of the house and wandered away into the park. Since her arrival at Gardencourt she had been but little out of doors, the weather being unfavourable for visiting the grounds. This evening, however, was fine, and at first it struck her as a happy thought to have come out. The theory I have just mentioned was plausible enough, but it brought her little rest, and if you had seen her pacing about you would have said she had a bad conscience. She was not pacified when at the end of a quarter of an hour, finding herself in view of the house, she saw Mrs. Touchett emerge from the portico accompanied by her visitor. Her aunt had evidently proposed to Lord Warburton that they should come in search of her. She was in no humour for visitors and, if she had had a chance, would have drawn back behind one of the great trees. But she saw she had been seen and that nothing was left her but to advance. As the lawn at Gardencourt was a vast expanse this took some time; during which she observed that, as he walked beside his hostess, Lord Warburton kept his hands rather stiffly behind him and his eyes upon the ground. Both persons apparently were silent; but Mrs. Touchett's thin little glance, as she directed it toward Isabel, had even at a distance an expression. It seemed to say with cutting sharpness: ""Here's the eminently amenable nobleman you might have married!"" When Lord Warburton lifted his own eyes, however, that was not what they said. They only said ""This is rather awkward, you know, and I depend upon you to help me."" He was very grave, very proper and, for the first time since Isabel had known him, greeted her without a smile. Even in his days of distress he had always begun with a smile. He looked extremely selfconscious.




""Lord Warburton has been so good as to come out to see me,"" said Mrs. Touchett. ""He tells me he didn't know you were still here. I know he's an old friend of yours, and as I was told you were not in the house I brought him out to see for himself.""




""Oh, I saw there was a good train at 6.40, that would get me back in time for dinner,"" Mrs. Touchett's companion rather irrelevantly explained. ""I'm so glad to find you've not gone.""




""I'm not here for long, you know,"" Isabel said with a certain eagerness.




""I suppose not; but I hope it's for some weeks. You came to England sooner than—a—than you thought?""




""Yes, I came very suddenly.""




Mrs. Touchett turned away as if she were looking at the condition of the grounds, which indeed was not what it should be, while Lord Warburton hesitated a little. Isabel fancied he had been on the point of asking about her husband—rather confusedly—and then had checked himself. He continued immitigably grave, either because he thought it becoming in a place over which death had just passed, or for more personal reasons. If he was conscious of personal reasons it was very fortunate that he had the cover of the former motive; he could make the most of that. Isabel thought of all this. It was not that his face was sad, for that was another matter; but it was strangely inexpressive.




""My sisters would have been so glad to come if they had known you were still here—if they had thought you would see them,"" Lord Warburton went on. ""Do kindly let them see you before you leave England.""




""It would give me great pleasure; I have such a friendly recollection of them.""




""I don't know whether you would come to Lockleigh for a day or two? You know there's always that old promise."" And his lordship coloured a little as he made this suggestion, which gave his face a somewhat more familiar air. ""Perhaps I'm not right in saying that just now; of course you're not thinking of visiting. But I meant what would hardly be a visit. My sisters are to be at Lockleigh at Whitsuntide for five days; and if you could come then—as you say you're not to be very long in England—I would see that there should be literally no one else.""




Isabel wondered if not even the young lady he was to marry would be there with her mamma; but she did not express this idea.




""Thank you extremely,"" she contented herself with saying; ""I'm afraid I hardly know about Whitsuntide.""




""But I have your promise—haven't I?—for some other time.""




There was an interrogation in this; but Isabel let it pass. She looked at her interlocutor a moment, and the result of her observation was that—as had happened before—she felt sorry for him. ""Take care you don't miss your train,"" she said. And then she added: ""I wish you every happiness.""




He blushed again, more than before, and he looked at his watch. ""Ah yes, 6.40; I haven't much time, but I've a fly at the door. Thank you very much."" It was not apparent whether the thanks applied to her having reminded him of his train or to the more sentimental remark. ""Good-bye, Mrs. Osmond; good-bye."" He shook hands with her, without meeting her eyes, and then he turned to Mrs. Touchett, who had wandered back to them. With her his parting was equally brief; and in a moment the two ladies saw him move with long steps across the lawn.




""Are you very sure he's to be married?"" Isabel asked of her aunt.




""I can't be surer than he; but he seems sure. I congratulated him, and he accepted it.""




""Ah,"" said Isabel, ""I give it up!""—while her aunt returned to the house and to those avocations which the visitor had interrupted.




She gave it up, but she still thought of it—thought of it while she strolled again under the great oaks whose shadows were long upon the acres of turf. At the end of a few minutes she found herself near a rustic bench, which, a moment after she had looked at it, struck her as an object recognised. It was not simply that she had seen it before, nor even that she had sat upon it; it was that on this spot something important had happened to her—that the place had an air of association. Then she remembered that she had been sitting there, six years before, when a servant brought her from the house the letter in which Caspar Goodwood informed her that he had followed her to Europe; and that when she had read the letter she looked up to hear Lord Warburton announcing that he should like to marry her. It was indeed an historical, an interesting, bench; she stood and looked at it as if it might have something to say to her. She wouldn't sit down on it now—she felt rather afraid of it. She only stood before it, and while she stood the past came back to her in one of those rushing waves of emotion by which persons of sensibility are visited at odd hours. The effect of this agitation was a sudden sense of being very tired, under the influence of which she overcame her scruples and sank into the rustic seat. I have said that she was restless and unable to occupy herself; and whether or no, if you had seen her there, you would have admired the justice of the former epithet, you would at least have allowed that at this moment she was the image of a victim of idleness. Her attitude had a singular absence of purpose; her hands, hanging at her sides, lost themselves in the folds of her black dress; her eyes gazed vaguely before her. There was nothing to recall her to the house; the two ladies, in their seclusion, dined early and had tea at an indefinite hour. How long she had sat in this position she could not have told you; but the twilight had grown thick when she became aware that she was not alone. She quickly straightened herself, glancing about, and then saw what had become of her solitude. She was sharing it with Caspar Goodwood, who stood looking at her, a few yards off, and whose footfall on the unresonant turf, as he came near, she had not heard. It occurred to her in the midst of this that it was just so Lord Warburton had surprised her of old.




She instantly rose, and as soon as Goodwood saw he was seen he started forward. She had had time only to rise when, with a motion that looked like violence, but felt like—she knew not what, he grasped her by the wrist and made her sink again into the seat. She closed her eyes; he had not hurt her; it was only a touch, which she had obeyed. But there was something in his face that she wished not to see. That was the way he had looked at her the other day in the churchyard; only at present it was worse. He said nothing at first; she only felt him close to her—beside her on the bench and pressingly turned to her. It almost seemed to her that no one had ever been so close to her as that. All this, however, took but an instant, at the end of which she had disengaged her wrist, turning her eyes upon her visitant. ""You've frightened me,"" she said.




""I didn't mean to,"" he answered, ""but if I did a little, no matter. I came from London a while ago by the train, but I couldn't come here directly. There was a man at the station who got ahead of me. He took a fly that was there, and I heard him give the order to drive here. I don't know who he was, but I didn't want to come with him; I wanted to see you alone. So I've been waiting and walking about. I've walked all over, and I was just coming to the house when I saw you here. There was a keeper, or someone, who met me; but that was all right, because I had made his acquaintance when I came here with your cousin. Is that gentleman gone? Are you really alone? I want to speak to you."" Goodwood spoke very fast; he was as excited as when they had parted in Rome. Isabel had hoped that condition would subside; and she shrank into herself as she perceived that, on the contrary, he had only let out sail. She had a new sensation; he had never produced it before; it was a feeling of danger. There was indeed something really formidable in his resolution. She gazed straight before her; he, with a hand on each knee, leaned forward, looking deeply into her face. The twilight seemed to darken round them. ""I want to speak to you,"" he repeated; ""I've something particular to say. I don't want to trouble you—as I did the other day in Rome. That was of no use; it only distressed you. I couldn't help it; I knew I was wrong. But I'm not wrong now; please don't think I am,"" he went on with his hard, deep voice melting a moment into entreaty. ""I came here to-day for a purpose. It's very different. It was vain for me to speak to you then; but now I can help you.""




She couldn't have told you whether it was because she was afraid, or because such a voice in the darkness seemed of necessity a boon; but she listened to him as she had never listened before; his words dropped deep into her soul. They produced a sort of stillness in all her being; and it was with an effort,in a moment, that she answered him. ""How can you help me?"" she asked in a low tone, as if she were taking what he had said seriously enough to make the enquiry in confidence.




""By inducing you to trust me. Now I know—to-day I know. Do you remember what I asked you in Rome? Then I was quite in the dark. But to-day I know on good authority; everything's clear to me to-day. It was a good thing when you made me come away with your cousin. He was a good man, a fine man, one of the best; he told me how the case stands for you. He explained everything; he guessed my sentiments. He was a member of your family and he left you—so long as you should be in England—to my care,"" said Goodwood as if he were making a great point. ""Do you know what he said to me the last time I saw him—as he lay there where he died? He said: 'Do everything you can for her; do everything she'll let you.'""




Isabel suddenly got up. ""You had no business to talk about me!""




""Why not—why not, when we talked in that way?"" he demanded, following her fast. ""And he was dying—when a man's dying it's different."" She checked the movement she had made to leave him; she was listening more than ever; it was true that he was not the same as that last time. That had been aimless, fruitless passion, but at present he had an idea, which she scented in all her being. ""But it doesn't matter!"" he exclaimed, pressing her still harder, though now without touching a hem of her garment. ""If Touchett had never opened his mouth I should have known all the same. I had only to look at you at your cousin's funeral to see what's the matter with you. You can't deceive me any more; for God's sake be honest with a man who's so honest with you. You're the most unhappy of women, and your husband's the deadliest of fiends.""




She turned on him as if he had struck her. ""Are you mad?"" she cried.




""I've never been so sane; I see the whole thing. Don't think it's necessary to defend him. But I won't say another word against him; I'll speak only of you,"" Goodwood added quickly. ""How can you pretend you're not heart-broken? You don't know what to do—you don't know where to turn. It's too late to play a part; didn't you leave all that behind you in Rome? Touchett knew all about it, and I knew it too—what it would cost you to come here. It will have cost you your life? Say it will""—and he flared almost into anger: ""give me one word of truth! When I know such a horror as that, how can I keep myself from wishing to save you? What would you think of me if I should stand still and see you go back to your reward? 'It's awful, what she'll have to pay for it!'—that's what Touchett said to me. I may tell you that, mayn't I ? He was such a near relation!"" cried Goodwood, making his queer grim point again. ""I'd sooner have been shot than let another man say those things to me; but he was different; he seemed to me to have the right. It was after he got home—when he saw he was dying, and when I saw it too. I understand all about it: you're afraid to go back. You're perfectly alone; you don't know where to turn. You can't turn anywhere; you know that perfectly. Now it is therefore that I want you to think of me."""|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"
"ap 05:00"|"five o'clock"|"Under certain circumstances there are few hours in life more agreeable than the hour dedicated to the ceremony known as afternoon tea. There are circumstances in which, whether you partake of the tea or not—some people of course never do,—the situation is in itself delightful. Those that I have in mind in beginning to unfold this simple history offered an admirable setting to an innocent pastime. The implements of the little feast had been disposed upon the lawn of an old English country-house, in what I should call the perfect middle of a splendid summer afternoon. Part of the afternoon had waned, but much of it was left, and what was left was of the finest and rarest quality. Real dusk would not arrive for many hours; but the flood of summer light had begun to ebb, the air had grown mellow, the shadows were long upon the smooth, dense turf. They lengthened slowly, however, and the scene expressed that sense of leisure still to come which is perhaps the chief source of one's enjoyment of such a scene at such an hour. From five o'clock to eight is on certain occasions a little eternity; but on such an occasion as this the interval could be only an eternity of pleasure. The persons concerned in it were taking their pleasure quietly, and they were not of the sex which is supposed to furnish the regular votaries of the ceremony I have mentioned. The shadows on the perfect lawn were straight and angular; they were the shadows of an old man sitting in a deep wicker-chair near the low table on which the tea had been served, and of two younger men strolling to and fro, in desultory talk, in front of him. The old man had his cup in his hand; it was an unusually large cup, of a different pattern from the rest of the set and painted in brilliant colours. He disposed of its contents with much circumspection, holding it for a long time close to his chin, with his face turned to the house. His companions had either finished their tea or were indifferent to their privilege; they smoked cigarettes as they continued to stroll. One of them, from time to time, as he passed, looked with a certain attention at the elder man, who, unconscious of observation, rested his eyes upon the rich red front of his dwelling. The house that rose beyond the lawn was a structure to repay such consideration and was the most characteristic object in the peculiarly English picture I have attempted to sketch.




It stood upon a low hill, above the river—the river being the Thames at some forty miles from London. A long gabled front of red brick, with the complexion of which time and the weather had played all sorts of pictorial tricks, only, however, to improve and refine it, presented to the lawn its patches of ivy, its clustered chimneys, its windows smothered in creepers. The house had a name and a history; the old gentleman taking his tea would have been delighted to tell you these things: how it had been built under Edward the Sixth, had offered a night's hospitality to the great Elizabeth (whose august person had extended itself upon a huge, magnificent and terribly angular bed which still formed the principal honour of the sleeping apartments), had been a good deal bruised and defaced in Cromwell's wars, and then, under the Restoration, repaired and much enlarged; and how, finally, after having been remodelled and disfigured in the eighteenth century, it had passed into the careful keeping of a shrewd American banker, who had bought it originally because (owing to circumstances too complicated to set forth) it was offered at a great bargain: bought it with much grumbling at its ugliness, its antiquity, its incommodity, and who now, at the end of twenty years, had become conscious of a real aesthetic passion for it, so that he knew all its points and would tell you just where to stand to see them in combination and just the hour when the shadows of its various protuberances which fell so softly upon the warm, weary brickwork—were of the right measure. Besides this, as I have said, he could have counted off most of the successive owners and occupants, several of whom were known to general fame; doing so, however, with an undemonstrative conviction that the latest phase of its destiny was not the least honourable.




The front of the house overlooking that portion of the lawn with which we are concerned was not the entrance-front; this was in quite another quarter. Privacy here reigned supreme, and the wide carpet of turf that covered the level hill-top seemed but the extension of a luxurious interior. The great still oaks and beeches flung down a shade as dense as that of velvet curtains; and the place was furnished, like a room, with cushioned seats, with rich-coloured rugs, with the books and papers that lay upon the grass. The river was at some distance; where the ground began to slope the lawn, properly speaking, ceased. But it was none the less a charming walk down to the water.




The old gentleman at the tea-table, who had come from America thirty years before, had brought with him, at the top of his baggage, his American physiognomy; and he had not only brought it with him, but he had kept it in the best order, so that, if necessary, he might have taken it back to his own country with perfect confidence. At present, obviously, nevertheless, he was not likely to displace himself; his journeys were over and he was taking the rest that precedes the great rest. He had a narrow, clean-shaven face, with features evenly distributed and an expression of placid acuteness. It was evidently a face in which the range of representation was not large, so that the air of contented shrewdness was all the more of a merit. It seemed to tell that he had been successful in life, yet it seemed to tell also that his success had not been exclusive and invidious, but had had much of the inoffensiveness of failure. He had certainly had a great experience of men, but there was an almost rustic simplicity in the faint smile that played upon his lean, spacious cheek and lighted up his humorous eye as he at last slowly and carefully deposited his big tea-cup upon the table. He was neatly dressed, in well-brushed black; but a shawl was folded upon his knees, and his feet were encased in thick, embroidered slippers. A beautiful collie dog lay upon the grass near his chair, watching the master's face almost as tenderly as the master took in the still more magisterial physiognomy of the house; and a little bristling, bustling terrier bestowed a desultory attendance upon the other gentlemen.




One of these was a remarkably well-made man of five-and-thirty, with a face as English as that of the old gentleman I have just sketched was something else; a noticeably handsome face, fresh-coloured, fair and frank, with firm, straight features, a lively grey eye and the rich adornment of a chestnut beard. This person had a certain fortunate, brilliant exceptional look—the air of a happy temperament fertilised by a high civilisation—which would have made almost any observer envy him at a venture. He was booted and spurred, as if he had dismounted from a long ride; he wore a white hat, which looked too large for him; he held his two hands behind him, and in one of them—a large, white, well-shaped fist—was crumpled a pair of soiled dog-skin gloves.




His companion, measuring the length of the lawn beside him, was a person of quite a different pattern, who, although he might have excited grave curiosity, would not, like the other, have provoked you to wish yourself, almost blindly, in his place. Tall, lean, loosely and feebly put together, he had an ugly, sickly, witty, charming face, furnished, but by no means decorated, with a straggling moustache and whisker. He looked clever and ill—a combination by no means felicitous; and he wore a brown velvet jacket. He carried his hands in his pockets, and there was something in the way he did it that showed the habit was inveterate. His gait had a shambling, wandering quality; he was not very firm on his legs. As I have said, whenever he passed the old man in the chair he rested his eyes upon him; and at this moment, with their faces brought into relation, you would easily have seen they were father and son. The father caught his son's eye at last and gave him a mild, responsive smile.




""I'm getting on very well,"" he said.




""Have you drunk your tea?"" asked the son.




""Yes, and enjoyed it.""




""Shall I give you some more?""




The old man considered, placidly. ""Well, I guess I'll wait and see."" He had, in speaking, the American tone.




""Are you cold?"" the son enquired.




The father slowly rubbed his legs. ""Well, I don't know. I can't tell till I feel.""




""Perhaps some one might feel for you,"" said the younger man, laughing.




""Oh, I hope some one will always feel for me! Don't you feel for me, Lord Warburton?""




""Oh yes, immensely,"" said the gentleman addressed as Lord Warburton, promptly. ""I'm bound to say you look wonderfully comfortable.""




""Well, I suppose I am, in most respects."" And the old man looked down at his green shawl and smoothed it over his knees. ""The fact is I've been comfortable so many years that I suppose I've got so used to it I don't know it.""




""Yes, that's the bore of comfort,"" said Lord Warburton. ""We only know when we're uncomfortable.""




""It strikes me we're rather particular,"" his companion remarked.




""Oh yes, there's no doubt we're particular,"" Lord Warburton murmured. And then the three men remained silent a while; the two younger ones standing looking down at the other, who presently asked for more tea. ""I should think you would be very unhappy with that shawl,"" Lord Warburton resumed while his companion filled the old man's cup again.




""Oh no, he must have the shawl!"" cried the gentleman in the velvet coat. ""Don't put such ideas as that into his head.""




""It belongs to my wife,"" said the old man simply.




""Oh, if it's for sentimental reasons—"" And Lord Warburton made a gesture of apology.




""I suppose I must give it to her when she comes,"" the old man went on.




""You'll please to do nothing of the kind. You'll keep it to cover your poor old legs.""




""Well, you mustn't abuse my legs,"" said the old man. ""I guess they are as good as yours.""




""Oh, you're perfectly free to abuse mine,"" his son replied, giving him his tea.




""Well, we're two lame ducks; I don't think there's much difference.""




""I'm much obliged to you for calling me a duck. How's your tea?""




""Well, it's rather hot.""




""That's intended to be a merit.""




""Ah, there's a great deal of merit,"" murmured the old man, kindly. ""He's a very good nurse, Lord Warburton.""




""Isn't he a bit clumsy?"" asked his lordship.




""Oh no, he's not clumsy—considering that he's an invalid himself. He's a very good nurse—for a sick-nurse. I call him my sick-nurse because he's sick himself.""




""Oh, come, daddy!"" the ugly young man exclaimed.




""Well, you are; I wish you weren't. But I suppose you can't help it.""




""I might try: that's an idea,"" said the young man.




""Were you ever sick, Lord Warburton?"" his father asked.




Lord Warburton considered a moment. ""Yes, sir, once, in the Persian Gulf.""




""He's making light of you, daddy,"" said the other young man. ""That's a sort of joke.""




""Well, there seem to be so many sorts now,"" daddy replied, serenely. ""You don't look as if you had been sick, any way, Lord Warburton.""




""He's sick of life; he was just telling me so; going on fearfully about it,"" said Lord Warburton's friend.




""Is that true, sir?"" asked the old man gravely.




""If it is, your son gave me no consolation. He's a wretched fellow to talk to—a regular cynic. He doesn't seem to believe in anything.""




""That's another sort of joke,"" said the person accused of cynicism.




""It's because his health is so poor,"" his father explained to Lord Warburton. ""It affects his mind and colours his way of looking at things; he seems to feel as if he had never had a chance. But it's almost entirely theoretical, you know; it doesn't seem to affect his spirits. I've hardly ever seen him when he wasn't cheerful—about as he is at present. He often cheers me up.""




The young man so described looked at Lord Warburton and laughed. ""Is it a glowing eulogy or an accusation of levity? Should you like me to carry out my theories, daddy?""




""By Jove, we should see some queer things!"" cried Lord Warburton.




""I hope you haven't taken up that sort of tone,"" said the old man.




""Warburton's tone is worse than mine; he pretends to be bored. I'm not in the least bored; I find life only too interesting.""




""Ah, too interesting; you shouldn't allow it to be that, you know!""




""I'm never bored when I come here,"" said Lord Warburton. ""One gets such uncommonly good talk.""




""Is that another sort of joke?"" asked the old man. ""You've no excuse for being bored anywhere. When I was your age I had never heard of such a thing.""




""You must have developed very late.""




""No, I developed very quick; that was just the reason. When I was twenty years old I was very highly developed indeed. I was working tooth and nail. You wouldn't be bored if you had something to do; but all you young men are too idle. You think too much of your pleasure. You're too fastidious, and too indolent, and too rich.""




""Oh, I say,"" cried Lord Warburton, ""you're hardly the person to accuse a fellow-creature of being too rich!""




""Do you mean because I'm a banker?"" asked the old man.




""Because of that, if you like; and because you have—haven't you?—such unlimited means.""




""He isn't very rich,"" the other young man mercifully pleaded. ""He has given away an immense deal of money.""




""Well, I suppose it was his own,"" said Lord Warburton; ""and in that case could there be a better proof of wealth? Let not a public benefactor talk of one's being too fond of pleasure.""




""Daddy's very fond of pleasure—of other people's.""




The old man shook his head. ""I don't pretend to have contributed anything to the amusement of my contemporaries.""




""My dear father, you're too modest!""




""That's a kind of joke, sir,"" said Lord Warburton.




""You young men have too many jokes. When there are no jokes you've nothing left.""




""Fortunately there are always more jokes,"" the ugly young man remarked.




""I don't believe it—I believe things are getting more serious. You young men will find that out.""




""The increasing seriousness of things, then that's the great opportunity of jokes.""




""They'll have to be grim jokes,"" said the old man. ""I'm convinced there will be great changes, and not all for the better.""




""I quite agree with you, sir,"" Lord Warburton declared. ""I'm very sure there will be great changes, and that all sorts of queer things will happen. That's why I find so much difficulty in applying your advice; you know you told me the other day that I ought to 'take hold' of something. One hesitates to take hold of a thing that may the next moment be knocked sky-high.""




""You ought to take hold of a pretty woman,"" said his companion. ""He's trying hard to fall in love,"" he added, by way of explanation, to his father.




""The pretty women themselves may be sent flying!"" Lord Warburton exclaimed.




""No, no, they'll be firm,"" the old man rejoined; ""they'll not be affected by the social and political changes I just referred to.""




""You mean they won't be abolished? Very well, then, I'll lay hands on one as soon as possible and tie her round my neck as a life-preserver.""




""The ladies will save us,"" said the old man; ""that is the best of them will—for I make a difference between them. Make up to a good one and marry her, and your life will become much more interesting.""




A momentary silence marked perhaps on the part of his auditors a sense of the magnanimity of this speech, for it was a secret neither for his son nor for his visitor that his own experiment in matrimony had not been a happy one. As he said, however, he made a difference; and these words may have been intended as a confession of personal error; though of course it was not in place for either of his companions to remark that apparently the lady of his choice had not been one of the best.




""If I marry an interesting woman I shall be interested: is that what you say?"" Lord Warburton asked. ""I'm not at all keen about marrying—your son misrepresented me; but there's no knowing what an interesting woman might do with me.""




""I should like to see your idea of an interesting woman,"" said his friend.




""My dear fellow, you can't see ideas—especially such highly ethereal ones as mine. If I could only see it myself—that would be a great step in advance.""




""Well, you may fall in love with whomsoever you please; but you mustn't fall in love with my niece,"" said the old man.




His son broke into a laugh. ""He'll think you mean that as a provocation! My dear father, you've lived with the English for thirty years, and you've picked up a good many of the things they say. But you've never learned the things they don't say!""




""I say what I please,"" the old man returned with all his serenity.




""I haven't the honour of knowing your niece,"" Lord Warburton said. ""I think it's the first time I've heard of her.""




""She's a niece of my wife's; Mrs. Touchett brings her to England.""




Then young Mr. Touchett explained. ""My mother, you know, has been spending the winter in America, and we're expecting her back. She writes that she has discovered a niece and that she has invited her to come out with her.""




""I see,—very kind of her,"" said Lord Warburton. Is the young lady interesting?""




""We hardly know more about her than you; my mother has not gone into details. She chiefly communicates with us by means of telegrams, and her telegrams are rather inscrutable. They say women don't know how to write them, but my mother has thoroughly mastered the art of condensation. 'Tired America, hot weather awful, return England with niece, first steamer decent cabin.' That's the sort of message we get from her—that was the last that came. But there had been another before, which I think contained the first mention of the niece. 'Changed hotel, very bad, impudent clerk, address here. Taken sister's girl, died last year, go to Europe, two sisters, quite independent.' Over that my father and I have scarcely stopped puzzling; it seems to admit of so many interpretations.""




""There's one thing very clear in it,"" said the old man; ""she has given the hotel-clerk a dressing.""




""I'm not sure even of that, since he has driven her from the field. We thought at first that the sister mentioned might be the sister of the clerk; but the subsequent mention of a niece seems to prove that the allusion is to one of my aunts. Then there was a question as to whose the two other sisters were; they are probably two of my late aunt's daughters. But who's 'quite independent,' and in what sense is the term used?—that point's not yet settled. Does the expression apply more particularly to the young lady my mother has adopted, or does it characterise her sisters equally?—and is it used in a moral or in a financial sense? Does it mean that they've been left well off, or that they wish to be under no obligations? or does it simply mean that they're fond of their own way?""




""Whatever else it means, it's pretty sure to mean that,"" Mr. Touchett remarked.




""You'll see for yourself,"" said Lord Warburton. ""When does Mrs. Touchett arrive?""




""We're quite in the dark; as soon as she can find a decent cabin. She may be waiting for it yet; on the other hand she may already have disembarked in England.""




""In that case she would probably have telegraphed to you.""




""She never telegraphs when you would expect it—only when you don't,"" said the old man. ""She likes to drop on me suddenly; she thinks she'll find me doing something wrong. She has never done so yet, but she's not discouraged.""




""It's her share in the family trait, the independence she speaks of."" Her son's appreciation of the matter was more favourable. ""Whatever the high spirit of those young ladies may be, her own is a match for it. She likes to do everything for herself and has no belief in any one's power to help her. She thinks me of no more use than a postage-stamp without gum, and she would never forgive me if I should presume to go to Liverpool to meet her.""




""Will you at least let me know when your cousin arrives?"" Lord Warburton asked.




""Only on the condition I've mentioned—that you don't fall in love with her!"" Mr. Touchett replied.




""That strikes me as hard, don't you think me good enough?""




""I think you too good—because I shouldn't like her to marry you. She hasn't come here to look for a husband, I hope; so many young ladies are doing that, as if there were no good ones at home. Then she's probably engaged; American girls are usually engaged, I believe. Moreover I'm not sure, after all, that you'd be a remarkable husband.""




""Very likely she's engaged; I've known a good many American girls, and they always were; but I could never see that it made any difference, upon my word! As for my being a good husband,"" Mr. Touchett's visitor pursued, ""I'm not sure of that either. One can but try!""




""Try as much as you please, but don't try on my niece,"" smiled the old man, whose opposition to the idea was broadly humorous.




""Ah, well,"" said Lord Warburton with a humour broader still, ""perhaps, after all, she's not worth trying on!"""|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"
"ap 06:45"|"quarter to seven"|"While this exchange of pleasantries took place between the two Ralph Touchett wandered away a little, with his usual slouching gait, his hands in his pockets and his little rowdyish terrier at his heels. His face was turned toward the house, but his eyes were bent musingly on the lawn; so that he had been an object of observation to a person who had just made her appearance in the ample doorway for some moments before he perceived her. His attention was called to her by the conduct of his dog, who had suddenly darted forward with a little volley of shrill barks, in which the note of welcome, however, was more sensible than that of defiance. The person in question was a young lady, who seemed immediately to interpret the greeting of the small beast. He advanced with great rapidity and stood at her feet, looking up and barking hard; whereupon, without hesitation, she stooped and caught him in her hands, holding him face to face while he continued his quick chatter. His master now had had time to follow and to see that Bunchie's new friend was a tall girl in a black dress, who at first sight looked pretty. She was bareheaded, as if she were staying in the house—a fact which conveyed perplexity to the son of its master, conscious of that immunity from visitors which had for some time been rendered necessary by the latter's ill-health. Meantime the two other gentlemen had also taken note of the new-comer.




""Dear me, who's that strange woman?"" Mr. Touchett had asked.




""Perhaps it's Mrs. Touchett's niece—the independent young lady,"" Lord Warburton suggested. ""I think she must be, from the way she handles the dog.""




The collie, too, had now allowed his attention to be diverted, and he trotted toward the young lady in the doorway, slowly setting his tail in motion as he went.




""But where's my wife then?"" murmured the old man.




""I suppose the young lady has left her somewhere: that's a part of the independence.""




The girl spoke to Ralph, smiling, while she still held up the terrier. ""Is this your little dog, sir?""




""He was mine a moment ago; but you've suddenly ac quired a remarkable air of property in him.""




""Couldn't we share him?"" asked the girl. ""He's such a perfect little darling.""




Ralph looked at her a moment; she was unexpectedly pretty. ""You may have him altogether,"" he then replied.




The young lady seemed to have a great deal of confidence, both in herself and in others; but this abrupt generosity made her blush. ""I ought to tell you that I'm probably your cousin,"" she brought out, putting down the dog. ""And here's another!"" she added quickly, as the collie came up.




""Probably?"" the young man exclaimed, laughing. ""I supposed it was quite settled! Have you arrived with my mother?""




""Yes, half an hour ago.""




""And has she deposited you and departed again?""




""No, she went straight to her room, and she told me that, if I should see you, I was to say to you that you must come to her there at a quarter to seven.""




The young man looked at his watch. ""Thank you very much; I shall be punctual."" And then he looked at his cousin. ""You're very welcome here. I'm delighted to see you.""




She was looking at everything, with an eye that denoted clear perception—at her companion, at the two dogs, at the two gentlemen under the trees, at the beautiful scene that surrounded her. ""I've never seen anything so lovely as this place. I've been all over the house; it's too enchanting.""




""I'm sorry you should have been here so long without our knowing it.""




""Your mother told me that in England people arrived very quietly; so I thought it was all right. Is one of those gentlemen your father?""




""Yes, the elder one—the one sitting down,"" said Ralph.




The girl gave a laugh. ""I don't suppose it's the other. Who's the other?""




""He's a friend of ours—Lord Warburton.""




""Oh, I hoped there would be a lord; it's just like a novel!"" And then, ""Oh you adorable creature!"" she suddenly cried, stooping down and picking up the small dog again.




She remained standing where they had met, making no offer to advance or to speak to Mr. Touchett, and while she lingered so near the threshold, slim and charming, her interlocutor wondered if she expected the old man to come and pay her his respects. American girls were used to a great deal of deference, and it had been intimated that this one had a high spirit. Indeed Ralph could see that in her face.




""Won't you come and make acquaintance with my father?"" he nevertheless ventured to ask. ""He's old and infirm—he doesn't leave his chair.""




""Ah, poor man, I'm very sorry!"" the girl exclaimed, immediately moving forward. ""I got the impression from your mother that he was rather intensely active.""




Ralph Touchett was silent a moment. ""She hasn't seen him for a year.""




""Well, he has a lovely place to sit. Come along, little hound.""




""It's a dear old place,"" said the young man, looking sidewise at his neighbour.




""What's his name?"" she asked, her attention having again reverted to the terrier.




""My father's name?""




""Yes,"" said the young lady with amusement; ""but don't tell him I asked you.""




They had come by this time to where old Mr. Touchett was sitting, and he slowly got up from his chair to introduce himself.




""My mother has arrived,"" said Ralph, ""and this is Miss Archer.""




The old man placed his two hands on her shoulders, looked at her a moment with extreme benevolence and then gallantly kissed her. ""It's a great pleasure to me to see you here; but I wish you had given us a chance to receive you.""




""Oh, we were received,"" said the girl. ""There were about a dozen servants in the hall. And there was an old woman curtseying at the gate.""




""We can do better than that—if we have notice!"" And the old man stood there smiling, rubbing his hands and slowly shaking his head at her. ""But Mrs. Touchett doesn't like receptions.""




""She went straight to her room.""




""Yes—and locked herself in. She always does that. Well, I suppose I shall see her next week."" And Mrs. Touchett's husband slowly resumed his former posture.




""Before that,"" said Miss Archer. ""She's coming down to dinner—at eight o'clock. Don't you forget a quarter to seven,"" she added, turning with a smile to Ralph.




""What's to happen at a quarter to seven?""




""I'm to see my mother,"" said Ralph.




""Ah, happy boy!"" the old man commented. ""You must sit down—you must have some tea,"" he observed to his wife's niece.




""They gave me some tea in my room the moment I got there,"" this young lady answered. ""I'm sorry you're out of health,"" she added, resting her eyes upon her venerable host.




""Oh, I'm an old man, my dear; it's time for me to be old. But I shall be the better for having you here.""




She had been looking all round her again—at the lawn, the great trees, the reedy, silvery Thames, the beautiful old house; and while engaged in this survey she had made room in it for her companions; a comprehensiveness of observation easily conceivable on the part of a young woman who was evidently both intelligent and excited. She had seated herself and had put away the little dog; her white hands, in her lap, were folded upon her black dress; her head was erect, her eye lighted, her flexible figure turned itself easily this way and that, in sympathy with the alertness with which she evidently caught impressions. Her impressions were numerous, and they were all reflected in a clear, still smile. ""I've never seen anything so beautiful as this.""




""It's looking very well,"" said Mr. Touchett. ""I know the way it strikes you. I've been through all that. But you're very beautiful yourself,"" he added with a politeness by no means crudely jocular and with the happy consciousness that his advanced age gave him the privilege of saying such things—even to young persons who might possibly take alarm at them.




What degree of alarm this young person took need not be exactly measured; she instantly rose, however, with a blush which was not a refutation. ""Oh yes, of course I'm lovely!"" she returned with a quick laugh. ""How old is your house? Is it Elizabethan?""




""It's early Tudor,"" said Ralph Touchett.




She turned toward him, watching his face. ""Early Tudor? How very delightful! And I suppose there are a great many others.""




""There are many much better ones.""




""Don't say that, my son!"" the old man protested. ""There's nothing better than this.""




""I've got a very good one; I think in some respects it's rather better,"" said Lord Warburton, who as yet had not spoken, but who had kept an attentive eye upon Miss Archer. He slightly inclined himself, smiling; he had an excellent manner with women. The girl appreciated it in an instant; she had not forgotten that this was Lord Warburton. ""I should like very much to show it to you,"" he added.




""Don't believe him,"" cried the old man; ""don't look at it! It's a wretched old barrack—not to be compared with this.""




""I don't know—I can't judge,"" said the girl, smiling at Lord Warburton.




In this discussion Ralph Touchett took no interest whatever; he stood with his hands in his pockets, looking greatly as if he should like to renew his conversation with his new-found cousin.




""Are you very fond of dogs?"" he enquired by way of beginning. He seemed to recognise that it was an awkward beginning for a clever man.




""Very fond of them indeed.""




""You must keep the terrier, you know,"" he went on, still awkwardly.




""I'll keep him while I'm here, with pleasure.""




""That will be for a long time, I hope.""




""You're very kind. I hardly know. My aunt must settle that.""




""I'll settle it with her—at a quarter to seven."" And Ralph looked at his watch again.




""I'm glad to be here at all,"" said the girl.




""I don't believe you allow things to be settled for you.""




""Oh yes; if they're settled as I like them.""




""I shall settle this as I like it,"" said Ralph. It's most unaccountable that we should never have known you.""




""I was there—you had only to come and see me.""




""There? Where do you mean?""




""In the United States: in New York and Albany and other American places.""




""I've been there—all over, but I never saw you. I can't make it out.""




Miss Archer just hesitated. ""It was because there had been some disagreement between your mother and my father, after my mother's death, which took place when I was a child. In consequence of it we never expected to see you.""




""Ah, but I don't embrace all my mother's quarrels—heaven forbid!"" the young man cried. ""You've lately lost your father?"" he went on more gravely.




""Yes; more than a year ago. After that my aunt was very kind to me; she came to see me and proposed that I should come with her to Europe.""




""I see,"" said Ralph. ""She has adopted you.""




""Adopted me?"" The girl stared, and her blush came back to her, together with a momentary look of pain which gave her interlocutor some alarm. He had underestimated the effect of his words. Lord Warburton, who appeared constantly desirous of a nearer view of Miss Archer, strolled toward the two cousins at the moment, and as he did so she rested her wider eyes on him.




""Oh no; she has not adopted me. I'm not a candidate for adoption.""




""I beg a thousand pardons,"" Ralph murmured. ""I meant—I meant—"" He hardly knew what he meant.




""You meant she has taken me up. Yes; she likes to take people up. She has been very kind to me; but,"" she added with a certain visible eagerness of desire to be explicit, ""I'm very fond of my liberty.""




""Are you talking about Mrs. Touchett?"" the old man called out from his chair. ""Come here, my dear, and tell me about her. I'm always thankful for information.""




The girl hesitated again, smiling. ""She's really very benevolent,"" she answered; after which she went over to her uncle, whose mirth was excited by her words.




Lord Warburton was left standing with Ralph Touchett, to whom in a moment he said: ""You wished a while ago to see my idea of an interesting woman. There it is!"""|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"

He slightly inclined himself, smiling; he had an excellent manner with women. The girl appreciated it in an instant; she had not forgotten that this was Lord Warburton. ""I should like very much to show it to you,"" he added.




""Don't believe him,"" cried the old man; ""don't look at it! It's a wretched old barrack—not to be compared with this.""




""I don't know—I can't judge,"" said the girl, smiling at Lord Warburton.




In this discussion Ralph Touchett took no interest whatever; he stood with his hands in his pockets, looking greatly as if he should like to renew his conversation with his new-found cousin.




""Are you very fond of dogs?"" he enquired by way of beginning. He seemed to recognise that it was an awkward beginning for a clever man.




""Very fond of them indeed.""




""You must keep the terrier, you know,"" he went on, still awkwardly.




""I'll keep him while I'm here, with pleasure.""




""That will be for a long time, I hope.""




""You're very kind. I hardly know. My aunt must settle that.""




""I'll settle it with her—at a quarter to seven."" And Ralph looked at his watch again.




""I'm glad to be here at all,"" said the girl.




""I don't believe you allow things to be settled for you.""




""Oh yes; if they're settled as I like them.""




""I shall settle this as I like it,"" said Ralph. It's most unaccountable that we should never have known you.""




""I was there—you had only to come and see me.""




""There? Where do you mean?""




""In the United States: in New York and Albany and other American places.""




""I've been there—all over, but I never saw you. I can't make it out.""




Miss Archer just hesitated. ""It was because there had been some disagreement between your mother and my father, after my mother's death, which took place when I was a child. In consequence of it we never expected to see you.""




""Ah, but I don't embrace all my mother's quarrels—heaven forbid!"" the young man cried. ""You've lately lost your father?"" he went on more gravely.




""Yes; more than a year ago. After that my aunt was very kind to me; she came to see me and proposed that I should come with her to Europe.""




""I see,"" said Ralph. ""She has adopted you.""




""Adopted me?"" The girl stared, and her blush came back to her, together with a momentary look of pain which gave her interlocutor some alarm. He had underestimated the effect of his words. Lord Warburton, who appeared constantly desirous of a nearer view of Miss Archer, strolled toward the two cousins at the moment, and as he did so she rested her wider eyes on him.




""Oh no; she has not adopted me. I'm not a candidate for adoption.""




""I beg a thousand pardons,"" Ralph murmured. ""I meant—I meant—"" He hardly knew what he meant.




""You meant she has taken me up. Yes; she likes to take people up. She has been very kind to me; but,"" she added with a certain visible eagerness of desire to be explicit, ""I'm very fond of my liberty.""




""Are you talking about Mrs. Touchett?"" the old man called out from his chair. ""Come here, my dear, and tell me about her. I'm always thankful for information.""




The girl hesitated again, smiling. ""She's really very benevolent,"" she answered; after which she went over to her uncle, whose mirth was excited by her words.




Lord Warburton was left standing with Ralph Touchett, to whom in a moment he said: ""You wished a while ago to see my idea of an interesting woman. There it is!"""|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"
"ap 06:00"|"six o'clock"|"Mrs. Touchett was certainly a person of many oddities, of which her behaviour on returning to her husband's house after many months was a noticeable specimen. She had her own way of doing all that she did, and this is the simplest description of a character which, although by no means without liberal motions, rarely succeeded in giving an impression of suavity. Mrs. Touchett might do a great deal of good, but she never pleased. This way of her own, of which she was so fond, was not intrinsically offensive—it was just unmistakeably distinguished from the ways of others. The edges of her conduct were so very clear-cut that for susceptible persons it sometimes had a knife-like effect. That hard fineness came out in her deportment during the first hours of her return from America, under circumstances in which it might have seemed that her first act would have been to exchange greetings with her husband and son. Mrs. Touchett, for reasons which she deemed excellent, always retired on such occasions into impenetrable seclusion, postponing the more sentimental ceremony until she had repaired the disorder of dress with a completeness which had the less reason to be of high importance as neither beauty nor vanity were concerned in it. She was a plain-faced old woman, without graces and without any great elegance, but with an extreme respect for her own motives. She was usually prepared to explain these—when the explanation was asked as a favour; and in such a case they proved totally different from those that had been attributed to her. She was virtually separated from her husband, but she appeared to perceive nothing irregular in the situation. It had become clear, at an early stage of their community, that they should never desire the same thing at the same moment, and this appearance had prompted her to rescue disagreement from the vulgar realm of accident. She did what she could to erect it into a law—a much more edifying aspect of it—by going to live in Florence, where she bought a house and established herself; and by leaving her husband to take care of the English branch of his bank. This arrangement greatly pleased her; it was so felicitously definite. It struck her husband in the same light, in a foggy square in London, where it was at times the most definite fact he discerned; but he would have preferred that such unnatural things should have a greater vagueness. To agree to disagree had cost him an effort; he was ready to agree to almost anything but that, and saw no reason why either assent or dissent should be so terribly consistent. Mrs. Touchett indulged in no regrets nor speculations, and usually came once a year to spend a month with her husband, a period during which she apparently took pains to convince him that she had adopted the right system. She was not fond of the English style of life, and had three or four reasons for it to which she currently alluded; they bore upon minor points of that ancient order, but for Mrs. Touchett they amply justified non-residence. She detested bread-sauce, which, as she said, looked like a poultice and tasted like soap; she objected to the consumption of beer by her maid-servants; and she affirmed that the British laundress (Mrs. Touchett was very particular about the appearance of her linen) was not a mistress of her art. At fixed intervals she paid a visit to her own country; but this last had been longer than any of its predecessors.




She had taken up her niece—there was little doubt of that. One wet afternoon, some four months earlier than the occurrence lately narrated, this young lady had been seated alone with a book. To say she was so occupied is to say that her solitude did not press upon her; for her love of knowledge had a fertilising quality and her imagination was strong. There was at this time, however, a want of fresh taste in her situation which the arrival of an unexpected visitor did much to correct. The visitor had not been announced; the girl heard her at last walking about the adjoining room. It was in an old house at Albany, a large, square, double house, with a notice of sale in the windows of one of the lower apartments. There were two entrances, one of which had long been out of use but had never been removed. They were exactly alike—large white doors, with an arched frame and wide side-lights, perched upon little ""stoops"" of red stone, which descended sidewise to the brick pavement of the street. The two houses together formed a single dwelling, the party-wall having been removed and the rooms placed in communication. These rooms, above-stairs, were extremely numerous, and were painted all over exactly alike, in a yellowish white which had grown sallow with time. On the third floor there was a sort of arched passage, connecting the two sides of the house, which Isabel and her sisters used in their childhood to call the tunnel and which, though it was short and well lighted, always seemed to the girl to be strange and lonely, especially on winter afternoons. She had been in the house, at different periods, as a child; in those days her grandmother lived there. Then there had been an absence of ten years, followed by a return to Albany before her father's death. Her grandmother, old Mrs. Archer, had exercised, chiefly within the limits of the family, a large hospitality in the early period, and the little girls often spent weeks under her roof—weeks of which Isabel had the happiest memory. The manner of life was different from that of her own home—larger, more plentiful, practically more festal; the discipline of the nursery was delightfully vague and the opportunity of listening to the conversation of one's elders (which with Isabel was a highly-valued pleasure) almost unbounded. There was a constant coming and going; her grandmother's sons and daughters and their children appeared to be in the enjoyment of standing invitations to arrive and remain, so that the house offered to a certain extent the appearance of a bustling provincial inn kept by a gentle old landlady who sighed a great deal and never presented a bill. Isabel of course knew nothing about bills; but even as a child she thought her grandmother's home romantic. There was a covered piazza behind it, furnished with a swing which was a source of tremulous interest; and beyond this was a long garden, sloping down to the stable and containing peach-trees of barely credible familiarity. Isabel had stayed with her grandmother at various seasons, but somehow all her visits had a flavour of peaches. On the other side, across the street, was an old house that was called the Dutch House—a peculiar structure dating from the earliest colonial time, composed of bricks that had been painted yellow, crowned with a gable that was pointed out to strangers, defended by a rickety wooden paling and standing sidewise to the street. It was occupied by a primary school for children of both sexes, kept or rather let go, by a demonstrative lady of whom Isabel's chief recollection was that her hair was fastened with strange bedroomy combs at the temples and that she was the widow of some one of consequence. The little girl had been offered the opportunity of laying a foundation of knowledge in this establishment; but having spent a single day in it, she had protested against its laws and had been allowed to stay at home, where, in the September days, when the windows of the Dutch House were open, she used to hear the hum of childish voices repeating the multiplication table—an incident in which the elation of liberty and the pain of exclusion were indistinguishably mingled. The foundation of her knowledge was really laid in the idleness of her grandmother's house, where, as most of the other inmates were not reading people, she had uncontrolled use of a library full of books with frontispieces, which she used to climb upon a chair to take down. When she had found one to her taste—she was guided in the selection chiefly by the frontispiece— she carried it into a mysterious apartment which lay beyond the library and which was called, traditionally, no one knew why, the office. Whose office it had been and at what period it had flourished, she never learned; it was enough for her that it contained an echo and a pleasant musty smell and that it was a chamber of disgrace for old pieces of furniture whose infirmities were not always apparent (so that the disgrace seemed unmerited and rendered them victims of injustice) and with which, in the manner of children, she had established relations almost human, certainly dramatic. There was an old haircloth sofa in especial, to which she had confided a hundred childish sorrows. The place owed much of its mysterious melancholy to the fact that it was properly entered from the second door of the house, the door that had been condemned, and that it was secured by bolts which a particularly slender little girl found it impossible to slide. She knew that this silent, motionless portal opened into the street; if the sidelights had not been filled with green paper she might have looked out upon the little brown stoop and the well-worn brick pavement. But she had no wish to look out, for this would have interfered with her theory that there was a strange, unseen place on the other side—a place which became to the child's imagination, according to its different moods, a region of delight or of terror.




It was in the ""office"" still that Isabel was sitting on that melancholy afternoon of early spring which I have just mentioned. At this time she might have had the whole house to choose from, and the room she had selected was the most depressed of its scenes. She had never opened the bolted door nor removed the green paper (renewed by other hands) from its sidelights; she had never assured herself that the vulgar street lay beyond. A crude, cold rain fell heavily; the spring-time was indeed an appeal—and it seemed a cynical, insincere appeal—to patience. Isabel, however, gave as little heed as possible to cosmic treacheries; she kept her eyes on her book and tried to fix her mind. It had lately occurred to her that her mind was a good deal of a vagabond, and she had spent much ingenuity in training it to a military step and teaching it to advance, to halt, to retreat, to perform even more complicated manoeuvres, at the word of command. Just now she had given it marching orders and it had been trudging over the sandy plains of a history of German Thought. Suddenly she became aware of a step very different from her own intellectual pace; she listened a little and perceived that some one was moving in the library, which communicated with the office. It struck her first as the step of a person from whom she was looking for a visit, then almost immediately announced itself as the tread of a woman and a stranger—her possible visitor being neither. It had an inquisitive, experimental quality which suggested that it would not stop short of the threshold of the office; and in fact the doorway of this apartment was presently occupied by a lady who paused there and looked very hard at our heroine. She was a plain, elderly woman, dressed in a comprehensive waterproof mantle; she had a face with a good deal of rather violent point.




""Oh,"" she began, ""is that where you usually sit?"" She looked about at the heterogeneous chairs and tables.




""Not when I have visitors,"" said Isabel, getting up to receive the intruder.




She directed their course back to the library while the visitor continued to look about her. ""You seem to have plenty of other rooms; they're in rather better condition. But everything's immensely worn.""




""Have you come to look at the house?"" Isabel asked. ""The servant will show it to you.""




""Send her away; I don't want to buy it. She has probably gone to look for you and is wandering about upstairs; she didn't seem at all intelligent. You had better tell her it's no matter."" And then, since the girl stood there hesitating and wondering, this unexpected critic said to her abruptly: ""I suppose you're one of the daughters?""




Isabel thought she had very strange manners. ""It depends upon whose daughters you mean.""




""The late Mr. Archer's—and my poor sister's.""




""Ah,"" said Isabel slowly, ""you must be our crazy Aunt Lydia!""




""Is that what your father told you to call me? I'm your Aunt Lydia, but I'm not at all crazy: I haven't a delusion! And which of the daughters are you?""




""I'm the youngest of the three, and my name's Isabel.""




""Yes; the others are Lilian and Edith. And are you the prettiest?""




""I haven't the least idea,"" said the girl.




""I think you must be."" And in this way the aunt and the niece made friends. The aunt had quarrelled years before with her brother-in-law, after the death of her sister, taking him to task for the manner in which he brought up his three girls. Being a high-tempered man he had requested her to mind her own business, and she had taken him at his word. For many years she held no communication with him and after his death had addressed not a word to his daughters, who had been bred in that disrespectful view of her which we have just seen Isabel betray. Mrs. Touchett's behaviour was, as usual, perfectly deliberate. She intended to go to America to look after her investments (with which her husband, in spite of his great financial position, had nothing to do) and would take advantage of this opportunity to enquire into the condition of her nieces. There was no need of writing, for she should attach no importance to any account of them she should elicit by letter; she believed, always, in seeing for one's self. Isabel found, however, that she knew a good deal about them, and knew about the marriage of the two elder girls; knew that their poor father had left very little money, but that the house in Albany, which had passed into his hands, was to be sold for their benefit; knew, finally, that Edmund Ludlow, Lilian's husband, had taken upon himself to attend to this matter, in consideration of which the young couple, who had come to Albany during Mr. Archer's illness, were remaining there for the present and, as well as Isabel herself, occupying the old place.




""How much money do you expect for it?"" Mrs. Touchett asked of her companion, who had brought her to sit in the front parlour, which she had inspected without enthusiasm.




""I haven't the least idea,"" said the girl.




""That's the second time you have said that to me,"" her aunt rejoined. ""And yet you don't look at all stupid.""




""I'm not stupid; but I don't know anything about money.""




""Yes, that's the way you were brought up—as if you were to inherit a million. What have you in point of fact inherited?""




""I really can't tell you. You must ask Edmund and Lilian; they'll be back in half an hour.""




""In Florence we should call it a very bad house,"" said Mrs. Touchett; ""but here, I dare say, it will bring a high price. It ought to make a considerable sum for each of you. In addition to that you must have something else; it's most extraordinary your not knowing. The position's of value, and they'll probably pull it down and make a row of shops. I wonder you don't do that yourself; you might let the shops to great advantage.""




Isabel stared; the idea of letting shops was new to her. ""I hope they won't pull it down,"" she said; ""I'm extremely fond of it.""




""I don't see what makes you fond of it; your father died here.""




""Yes; but I don't dislike it for that,"" the girl rather strangely returned. ""I like places in which things have happened—even if they're sad things. A great many people have died here; the place has been full of life.""




""Is that what you call being full of life?""




""I mean full of experience—of people's feelings and sorrows. And not of their sorrows only, for I've been very happy here as a child.""




""You should go to Florence if you like houses in which things have happened—especially deaths. I live in an old palace in which three people have been murdered; three that were known and I don't know how many more besides.""




""In an old palace?"" Isabel repeated.




""Yes, my dear; a very different affair from this. This is very bourgeois.""




Isabel felt some emotion, for she had always thought highly of her grandmother's house. But the emotion was of a kind which led her to say: ""I should like very much to go to Florence.""




""Well, if you'll be very good, and do everything I tell you I'll take you there,"" Mrs. Touchett declared.




Our young woman's emotion deepened; she flushed a little and smiled at her aunt in silence. ""Do everything you tell me? I don't think I can promise that.""




""No, you don't look like a person of that sort. You're fond of your own way; but it's not for me to blame you.""




""And yet, to go to Florence,"" the girl exclaimed in a moment, ""I'd promise almost anything!""




Edmund and Lilian were slow to return, and Mrs. Touchett had an hour's uninterrupted talk with her niece, who found her a strange and interesting figure: a figure essentially—almost the first she had ever met. She was as eccentric as Isabel had always supposed; and hitherto, whenever the girl had heard people described as eccentric, she had thought of them as offensive or alarming. The term had always suggested to her something grotesque and even sinister. But her aunt made it a matter of high but easy irony, or comedy, and led her to ask herself if the common tone, which was all she had known, had ever been as interesting. No one certainly had on any occasion so held her as this little thin-lipped, bright-eyed, foreign-looking woman, who retrieved an insignificant appearance by a distinguished manner and, sitting there in a well-worn waterproof, talked with striking familiarity of the courts of Europe. There was nothing flighty about Mrs. Touchett, but she recognised no social superiors, and, judging the great ones of the earth in a way that spoke of this, enjoyed the consciousness of making an impression on a candid and susceptible mind. Isabel at first had answered a good many questions, and it was from her answers apparently that Mrs. Touchett derived a high opinion of her intelligence. But after this she had asked a good many, and her aunt's answers, whatever turn they took, struck her as food for deep reflexion. Mrs. Touchett waited for the return of her other niece as long as she thought reasonable, but as at six o'clock Mrs. Ludlow had not come in she prepared to take her departure.




""Your sister must be a great gossip. Is she accustomed to staying out so many hours?""




""You've been out almost as long as she,"" Isabel replied; ""she can have left the house but a short time before you came in.""




Mrs. Touchett looked at the girl without resentment; she appeared to enjoy a bold retort and to be disposed to be gracious. ""Perhaps she hasn't had so good an excuse as I. Tell her at any rate that she must come and see me this evening at that horrid hotel. She may bring her husband if she likes, but she needn't bring you. I shall see plenty of you later."""|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"
"ap 06:45"|"quarter to seven"|"Ralph Touchett was a philosopher, but nevertheless he knocked at his mother's door (at a quarter to seven) with a good deal of eagerness. Even philosophers have their preferences, and it must be admitted that of his progenitors his father ministered most to his sense of the sweetness of filial dependence. His father, as he had often said to himself, was the more motherly; his mother, on the other hand, was paternal, and even, according to the slang of the day, gubernatorial. She was nevertheless very fond of her only child and had always insisted on his spending three months of the year with her. Ralph rendered perfect justice to her affection and knew that in her thoughts and her thoroughly arranged and servanted life his turn always came after the other nearest subjects of her solicitude, the various punctualities of performance of the workers of her will. He found her completely dressed for dinner, but she embraced her boy with her gloved hands and made him sit on the sofa beside her. She enquired scrupulously about her husband's health and about the young man's own, and, receiving no very brilliant account of either, remarked that she was more than ever convinced of her wisdom in not exposing herself to the English climate. In this case she also might have given way. Ralph smiled at the idea of his mother's giving way, but made no point of reminding her that his own infirmity was not the result of the English climate, from which he absented himself for a considerable part of each year.




He had been a very small boy when his father, Daniel Tracy Touchett, a native of Rutland, in the State of Vermont, came to England as subordinate partner in a banking-house where some ten years later he gained preponderant control. Daniel Touchett saw before him a life-long residence in his adopted country, of which, from the first, he took a simple, sane and accommodating view. But, as he said to himself, he had no intention of disamericanising, nor had he a desire to teach his only son any such subtle art. It had been for himself so very soluble a problem to live in England assimilated yet unconverted that it seemed to him equally simple his lawful heir should after his death carry on the grey old bank in the white American light. He s was at pains to intensify this light, however, by sending the boy home for his education. Ralph spent several terms at an American school and took a degree at an American university, after which, as he struck his father on his return as even redundantly native, he was placed for some three years in residence at Oxford. Oxford swallowed up Harvard, and Ralph became at last English enough. His outward conformity to the manners that surrounded him was none the less the mask of a mind that greatly enjoyed its independence, on which nothing long imposed itself, and which, naturally inclined to adventure and irony, indulged in a boundless liberty of appreciation. He began with being a young man of promise; at Oxford he distinguished himself, to his father's ineffable satisfaction, and the people about him said it was a thousand pities so clever a fellow should be shut out from a career. He might have had a career by returning to his own country (though this point is shrouded in uncertainty) and even if Mr. Touchett had been willing to part with him (which was not the case) it would have gone hard with him to put a watery waste permanently between himself and the old man whom he regarded as his best friend. Ralph was not only fond of his father, he admired him—he enjoyed the opportunity of observing him. Daniel Touchett, to his perception, was a man of genius, and though he himself had no aptitude for the banking mystery he made a point of learning enough of it to measure the great figure his father had played. It was not this, however, he mainly relished; it was the fine ivory surface, polished as by the English air, that the old man had opposed to possibilities of penetration. Daniel Touchett had been neither at Harvard nor at Oxford, and it was his own fault if he had placed in his son's hands the key to modern criticism. Ralph, whose head was full of ideas which his father had never guessed, had a high esteem for the latter's originality. Americans, rightly or wrongly, are commended for the ease with which they adapt themselves to foreign conditions; but Mr. Touchett had made of the very limits of his pliancy half the ground of his general success. He had retained in their freshness most of his marks of primary pressure; his tone, as his son always noted with pleasure, was that of the more luxuriant parts of New England. At the end of his life he had become, on his own ground, as mellow as he was rich; he combined consummate shrewdness with the disposition superficially to fraternise, and his ""social position,"" on which he had never wasted a care, had the firm perfection of an unthumbed fruit. It was perhaps his want of imagination and of what is called the historic consciousness; but to many of the impressions usually made by English life upon the cultivated stranger his sense was completely closed. There were certain differences he had never perceived, certain habits he had never formed, certain obscurities he had never sounded. As regards these latter, on the day he had sounded them his son would have thought less well of him.




Ralph, on leaving Oxford, had spent a couple of years in travelling; after which he had found himself perched on a high stool in his father's bank. The responsibility and honour of such positions is not, I believe, measured by the height of the stool, which depends upon other considerations: Ralph, indeed, who had very long legs, was fond of standing, and even of walking about, at his work. To this exercise, however, he was obliged to devote but a limited period, for at the end of some eighteen months he had become aware of his being seriously out of health. He had caught a violent cold, which fixed itself on his lungs and threw them into dire confusion. He had to give up work and apply, to the letter, the sorry injunction to take care of himself. At first he slighted the task; it appeared to him it was not himself in the least he was taking care of, but an uninteresting and uninterested person with whom he had nothing in common. This person, however, improved on acquaintance, and Ralph grew at last to have a certain grudging tolerance, even an undemonstrative respect, for him. Misfortune makes strange bedfellows, and our young man, feeling that he had something at stake in the matter—it usually struck him as his reputation for ordinary wit—devoted to his graceless charge an amount of attention of which note was duly taken and which had at least the effect of keeping the poor fellow alive. One of his lungs began to heal, the other promised to follow its example, and he was assured he might outweather a dozen winters if he would betake himself to those climates in which consumptives chiefly congregate. As he had grown extremely fond of London, he cursed the flatness of exile: but at the same time that he cursed he conformed, and gradually, when he found his sensitive organ grateful even for grim favours, he conferred them with a lighter hand. He wintered abroad, as the phrase is; basked in the sun, stopped at home when the wind blew, went to bed when it rained, and once or twice, when it had snowed overnight, almost never got up again.




A secret hoard of indifference—like a thick cake a fond old nurse might have slipped into his first school outfit—came to his aid and helped to reconcile him to sacrifice; since at the best he was too ill for aught but that arduous game. As he said to himself, there was really nothing he had wanted very much to do, so that he had at least not renounced the field of valour. At present, however, the fragrance of forbidden fruit seemed occasionally to float past him and remind him that the finest of pleasures is the rush of action. Living as he now lived was like reading a good book in a poor translation—a meagre entertainment for a young man who felt that he might have been an excellent linguist. He had good winters and poor winters, and while the former lasted he was sometimes the sport of a vision of virtual recovery. But this vision was dispelled some three years before the occurrence of the incidents with which this history opens: he had on that occasion remained later than usual in England and had been overtaken by bad weather before reaching Algiers. He arrived more dead than alive and lay there for several weeks between life and death. His convalescence was a miracle, but the first use he made of it was to assure himself that such miracles happen but once. He said to himself that his hour was in sight and that it behoved him to keep his eyes upon it, yet that it was also open to him to spend the interval as agreeably as might be consistent with such a preoccupation. With the prospect of losing them the simple use of his faculties became an exquisite pleasure; it seemed to him the joys of contemplation had never been sounded. He was far from the time when he had found it hard that he should be obliged to give up the idea of distinguishing himself; an idea none the less importunate for being vague and none the less delightful for having had to struggle in the same breast with bursts of inspiring self-criticism. His friends at present judged him more cheerful, and attributed it to a theory, over which they shook their heads knowingly, that he would recover his health. His serenity was but the array of wild flowers niched in his ruin.




It was very probably this sweet-tasting property of the observed thing in itself that was mainly concerned in Ralph's quickly-stirred interest in the advent of a young lady who was evidently not insipid. If he was consideringly disposed, something told him, here was occupation enough for a succession of days. It may be added, in summary fashion, that the imagination of loving—as distinguished from that of being loved —had still a place in his reduced sketch. He had only forbidden himself the riot of expression. However, he shouldn't inspire his cousin with a passion, nor would she be able, even should she try, to help him to one. ""And now tell me about the young lady,"" he said to his mother. ""What do you mean to do with her?""




Mrs. Touchett was prompt. ""I mean to ask your father to invite her to stay three or four weeks at Gardencourt.""




""You needn't stand on any such ceremony as that,"" said Ralph. ""My father will ask her as a matter of course.""




""I don't know about that. She's my niece; she's not his.""




""Good Lord, dear mother; what a sense of property! That's all the more reason for his asking her. But after that—I mean after three months (for its absurd asking the poor girl to remain but for three or four paltry weeks)—what do you mean to do with her?""




""I mean to take her to Paris. I mean to get her clothing.""




""Ah yes, that's of course. But independently of that?""




""I shall invite her to spend the autumn with me in Florence.""




""You don't rise above detail, dear mother,"" said Ralph. ""I should like to know what you mean to do with her in a general way.""




""My duty!"" Mrs. Touchett declared. ""I suppose you pity her very much,"" she added.




""No, I don't think I pity her. She doesn't strike me as inviting compassion. I think I envy her. Before being sure, however, give me a hint of where you see your duty.""




""In showing her four European countries—I shall leave her the choice of two of them—and in giving her the opportunity of perfecting herself in French, which she already knows very well.""




Ralph frowned a little. ""That sounds rather dry—even allowing her the choice of two of the countries.""




""If it's dry,"" said his mother with a laugh, ""you can leave Isabel alone to water it! She is as good as a summer rain, any day.""




""Do you mean she's a gifted being?""




""I don't know whether she's a gifted being, but she's a clever girl—with a strong will and a high temper. She has no idea of being bored.""




""I can imagine that,"" said Ralph; and then he added abruptly: ""How do you two get on?""




""Do you mean by that that I'm a bore? I don't think she finds me one. Some girls might, I know; but Isabel's too clever for that. I think I greatly amuse her. We get on because I understand her, I know the sort of girl she is. She's very frank, and I'm very frank: we know just what to expect of each other.""




""Ah, dear mother,"" Ralph exclaimed, ""one always knows what to expect of you! You've never surprised me but once, and that's to-day—in presenting me with a pretty cousin whose existence I had never suspected.""




""Do you think her so very pretty?""




""Very pretty indeed; but I don't insist upon that. It's her general air of being some one in particular that strikes me. Who is this rare creature, and what is she? Where did you find her, and how did you make her acquaintance?""




""I found her in an old house at Albany, sitting in a dreary room on a rainy day, reading a heavy book and boring herself to death. She didn't know she was bored, but when I left her no doubt of it she seemed very grateful for the service. You may say I shouldn't have enlightened he—I should have let her alone. There's a good deal in that, but I acted conscientiously; I thought she was meant for something better. It occurred to me that it would be a kindness to take her about and introduce her to the world. She thinks she knows a great deal of it—like most American girls; but like most American girls she's ridiculously mistaken. If you want to know, I thought she would do me credit. I like to be well thought of, and for a woman of my age there's no greater convenience, in some ways, than an attractive niece. You know I had seen nothing of my sister's children for years; I disapproved entirely of the father. But I always meant to do something for them when he should have gone to his reward. I ascertained where they were to be found and, without any preliminaries, went and introduced myself. There are two others of them, both of whom are married; but I saw only the elder, who has, by the way, a very uncivil husband. The wife, whose name is Lily, jumped at the idea of my taking an interest in Isabel; she said it was just what her sister needed—that some one should take an interest in her. She spoke of her as you might speak of some young person of genius—in want of encouragement and patronage. It may be that Isabel's a genius; but in that case I've not yet learned her special line. Mrs. Ludlow was especially keen about my taking her to Europe; they all regard Europe over there as a land of emigration, of rescue, a refuge for their superfluous population. Isabel herself seemed very glad to come, and the thing was easily arranged. There was a little difficulty about the money-question, as she seemed averse to being under pecuniary obligations. But she has a small income and she supposes herself to be travelling at her own expense.""




Ralph had listened attentively to this judicious report, by which his interest in the subject of it was not impaired. ""Ah, if she's a genius,"" he said, ""we must find out her special line. Is it by chance for flirting?""




""I don't think so. You may suspect that at first, but you'll be wrong. You won't, I think, in anyway, be easily right about her.""




""Warburton's wrong then!"" Ralph rejoicingly exclaimed. ""He flatters himself he has made that discovery.""




His mother shook her head. ""Lord Warburton won't understand her. He needn't try.""




""He's very intelligent,"" said Ralph; ""but it's right he should be puzzled once in a while.""




""Isabel will enjoy puzzling a lord,"" Mrs. Touchett remarked.




Her son frowned a little. What does she know about lords?""




""Nothing at all: that will puzzle him all the more.""




Ralph greeted these words with a laugh and looked out of the window. Then, ""Are you not going down to see my father?"" he asked.




""At a quarter to eight,"" said Mrs. Touchett.




Her son looked at his watch. ""You've another quarter of an hour then. Tell me some more about Isabel."" After which, as Mrs. Touchett declined his invitation, declaring that he must find out for himself, ""Well,"" he pursued, ""she'll certainly do you credit. But won't she also give you trouble?""




""I hope not; but if she does I shall not shrink from it. I never do that.""




""She strikes me as very natural,"" said Ralph.




""Natural people are not the most trouble.""




""No,"" said Ralph; ""you yourself are a proof of that. You're extremely natural, and I'm sure you have never troubled any one. It takes trouble to do that. But tell me this; it just occurs to me. Is Isabel capable of making herself disagreeable?""




""Ah,"" cried his mother, ""you ask too many questions! Find that out for yourself.""




His questions, however, were not exhausted. ""All this time,"" he said, ""you've not told me what you intend to do with her.""




""Do with her? You talk as if she were a yard of calico. I shall do absolutely nothing with her, and she herself will do everything she chooses. She gave me notice of that.""




""What you meant then, in your telegram, was that her character's independent.""




""I never know what I mean in my telegrams—especially those I send from America. Clearness is too expensive. Come down to your father.""




""It's not yet a quarter to eight,"" said Ralph.




""I must allow for his impatience,"" Mrs. Touchett answered. Ralph knew what to think of his father's impatience; but, making no rejoinder, he offered his mother his arm. This put it in his power, as they descended together, to stop her a moment on the middle landing of the staircase—the broad, low, wide-armed staircase of time-blackened oak which was one of the most striking features of Gardencourt. ""You've no plan of marrying her?"" he smiled.




""Marrying her? I should be sorry to play her such a trick! But apart from that, she's perfectly able to marry herself. She has every facility.""




""Do you mean to say she has a husband picked out?""




""I don't know about a husband, but there's a young man in Boston—!""




Ralph went on; he had no desire to hear about the young man in Boston. ""As my father says, they're always engaged!""




His mother had told him that he must satisfy his curiosity at the source, and it soon became evident he should not want for occasion. He had a good deal of talk with his young kinswoman when the two had been left together in the drawing-room. Lord Warburton, who had ridden over from his own house, some ten miles distant, remounted and took his departure before dinner; and an hour after this meal was ended Mr. and Mrs. Touchett, who appeared to have quite emptied the measure of their forms, withdrew, under the valid pretext of fatigue, to their respective apartments. The young man spent an hour with his cousin; though she had been travelling half the day she appeared in no degree spent. She was really tired; she knew it, and knew she should pay for it on the morrow; but it was her habit at this period to carry exhaustion to the furthest point and confess to it only when dissimulation broke down. A fine hypocrisy was for the present possible; she was interested; she was, as she said to herself, floated. She asked Ralph to show her the pictures; there were a great many in the house, most of them of his own choosing. The best were arranged in an oaken gallery, of charming proportions, which had a sitting-room at either end of it and which in the evening was usually lighted. The light was insufficient to show the pictures to advantage, and the visit might have stood over to the morrow. This suggestion Ralph had ventured to make; but Isabel looked disappointed—smiling still, however—and said: ""If you please I should like to see them just a little."" She was eager, she knew she was eager and now seemed so; she couldn't help it. ""She doesn't take suggestions,"" Ralph said to himself; but he said it without irritation; her pressure amused and even pleased him. The lamps were on brackets, at intervals, and if the light was imperfect it was genial. It fell upon the vague squares of rich colour and on the faded gilding of heavy frames; it made a sheen on the polished floor of the gallery. Ralph took a candlestick and moved about, pointing out the things he liked; Isabel, inclining to one picture after another, indulged in little exclamations and murmurs. She was evidently a judge; she had a natural taste; he was struck with that. She took a candlestick herself and held it slowly here and there; she lifted it high, and as she did so he found himself pausing in the middle of the place and bending his eyes much less upon the pictures than on her presence. He lost nothing, in truth, by these wandering glances, for she was better worth looking at than most works of art. She was undeniably spare, and ponderably light, and proveably tall; when people had wished to distinguish her from the other two Miss Archers they had always called her the willowy one. Her hair, which was dark even to blackness, had been an object of envy to many women; her light grey eyes, a little too firm perhaps in her graver moments, had an enchanting range of concession. They walked slowly up one side of the gallery and down the other, and then she said: ""Well, now I know more than I did when I began!""




""You apparently have a great passion for knowledge,"" her cousin returned.




""I think I have; most girls are horridly ignorant.""




""You strike me as different from most girls.""




""Ah, some of them would—but the way they're talked to!"" murmured Isabel, who preferred not to dilate just yet on herself. Then in a moment, to change the subject, ""Please tell me—isn't there a ghost?"" she went on.




""A ghost?""




""A castle-spectre, a thing that appears. We call them ghosts in America.""




""So we do here, when we see them.""




""You do see them then? You ought to, in this romantic old house.""




""It's not a romantic old house,"" said Ralph. ""You'll be disappointed if you count on that. It's a dismally prosaic one; there's no romance here but what you may have brought with you.""




""I've brought a great deal; but it seems to me I've brought it to the right place.""




""To keep it out of harm, certainly; nothing will ever happen to it here, between my father and me.""




Isabel looked at him a moment. ""Is there never any one here but your father and you?""




""My mother, of course.""




""Oh, I know your mother; she's not romantic. Haven't you other people?""




""Very few.""




""I'm sorry for that; I like so much to see people.""




""Oh, we'll invite all the county to amuse you,"" said Ralph.




""Now you're making fun of me,"" the girl answered rather gravely. ""Who was the gentleman on the lawn when I arrived?""




""A county neighbour; he doesn't come very often.""




""I'm sorry for that; I liked him,"" said Isabel.




""Why, it seemed to me that you barely spoke to him,"" Ralph objected.




""Never mind, I like him all the same. I like your father too, immensely.""




""You can't do better than that. He's the dearest of the dear.""




""I'm so sorry he is ill,"" said Isabel.




""You must help me to nurse him; you ought to be a good nurse.""




""I don't think I am; I've been told I'm not; I'm said to have too many theories. But you haven't told me about the ghost,"" she added.




Ralph, however, gave no heed to this observation. ""You like my father and you like Lord Warburton. I infer also that you like my mother.""




""I like your mother very much, because—because—"" And Isabel found herself attempting to assign a reason for her affection for Mrs. Touchett.




""Ah, we never know why!"" said her companion, laughing.




""I always know why,"" the girl answered. ""It's because she doesn't expect one to like her. She doesn't care whether one does or not.""




""So you adore her—out of perversity? Well, I take greatly after my mother,"" said Ralph.




""I don't believe you do at all. You wish people to like you, and you try to make them do it.""




""Good heavens, how you see through one!"" he cried with a dismay that was not altogether jocular.




""But I like you all the same,"" his cousin went on. ""The way to clinch the matter will be to show me the ghost.""




Ralph shook his head sadly. ""I might show it to you, but you'd never see it. The privilege isn't given to every one; it's not enviable. It has never been seen by a young, happy, innocent person like you. You must have suffered first, have suffered greatly, have gained some miserable knowledge. In that way your eyes are opened to it. I saw it long ago,"" said Ralph.




""I told you just now I'm very fond of knowledge,"" Isabel answered.




""Yes, of happy knowledge—of pleasant knowledge. But you haven't suffered, and you're not made to suffer. I hope you'll never see the ghost!""




She had listened to him attentively, with a smile on her lips, but with a certain gravity in her eyes. Charming as he found her, she had struck him as rather presumptuous—indeed it was a part of her charm; and he wondered what she would say. ""I'm not afraid, you know,"" she said: which seemed quite presumptuous enough.




""You're not afraid of suffering?""




""Yes, I'm afraid of suffering. But I'm not afraid of ghosts. And I think people suffer too easily,"" she added.




""I don't believe you do,"" said Ralph, looking at her with his hands in his pockets.




""I don't think that's a fault,"" she answered. ""It's not absolutely necessary to suffer; we were not made for that.""




""You were not, certainly.""




""I'm not speaking of myself."" And she wandered off a little.




""No, it isn't a fault,"" said her cousin. ""It's a merit to be strong.""




""Only, if you don't suffer they call you hard,"" Isabel




remarked.




They passed out of the smaller drawing-room, into which they had returned from the gallery, and paused in the hall, at the foot of the staircase. Here Ralph presented his companion with her bedroom candle, which he had taken from a niche. ""Never mind what they call you. When you do suffer they call you an idiot. The great point's to be as happy as possible.""




She looked at him a little; she had taken her candle and placed her foot on the oaken stair. ""Well,"" she said, ""that's what I came to Europe for, to be as happy as possible. Good-night.""




""Good-night! I wish you all success, and shall be very glad to contribute to it!""




She turned away, and he watched her as she slowly ascended. Then, with his hands always in his pockets, he went back to the empty drawing-room."|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"
"ap 07:45"|"quarter to eight"|"Ralph Touchett was a philosopher, but nevertheless he knocked at his mother's door (at a quarter to seven) with a good deal of eagerness. Even philosophers have their preferences, and it must be admitted that of his progenitors his father ministered most to his sense of the sweetness of filial dependence. His father, as he had often said to himself, was the more motherly; his mother, on the other hand, was paternal, and even, according to the slang of the day, gubernatorial. She was nevertheless very fond of her only child and had always insisted on his spending three months of the year with her. Ralph rendered perfect justice to her affection and knew that in her thoughts and her thoroughly arranged and servanted life his turn always came after the other nearest subjects of her solicitude, the various punctualities of performance of the workers of her will. He found her completely dressed for dinner, but she embraced her boy with her gloved hands and made him sit on the sofa beside her. She enquired scrupulously about her husband's health and about the young man's own, and, receiving no very brilliant account of either, remarked that she was more than ever convinced of her wisdom in not exposing herself to the English climate. In this case she also might have given way. Ralph smiled at the idea of his mother's giving way, but made no point of reminding her that his own infirmity was not the result of the English climate, from which he absented himself for a considerable part of each year.




He had been a very small boy when his father, Daniel Tracy Touchett, a native of Rutland, in the State of Vermont, came to England as subordinate partner in a banking-house where some ten years later he gained preponderant control. Daniel Touchett saw before him a life-long residence in his adopted country, of which, from the first, he took a simple, sane and accommodating view. But, as he said to himself, he had no intention of disamericanising, nor had he a desire to teach his only son any such subtle art. It had been for himself so very soluble a problem to live in England assimilated yet unconverted that it seemed to him equally simple his lawful heir should after his death carry on the grey old bank in the white American light. He s was at pains to intensify this light, however, by sending the boy home for his education. Ralph spent several terms at an American school and took a degree at an American university, after which, as he struck his father on his return as even redundantly native, he was placed for some three years in residence at Oxford. Oxford swallowed up Harvard, and Ralph became at last English enough. His outward conformity to the manners that surrounded him was none the less the mask of a mind that greatly enjoyed its independence, on which nothing long imposed itself, and which, naturally inclined to adventure and irony, indulged in a boundless liberty of appreciation. He began with being a young man of promise; at Oxford he distinguished himself, to his father's ineffable satisfaction, and the people about him said it was a thousand pities so clever a fellow should be shut out from a career. He might have had a career by returning to his own country (though this point is shrouded in uncertainty) and even if Mr. Touchett had been willing to part with him (which was not the case) it would have gone hard with him to put a watery waste permanently between himself and the old man whom he regarded as his best friend. Ralph was not only fond of his father, he admired him—he enjoyed the opportunity of observing him. Daniel Touchett, to his perception, was a man of genius, and though he himself had no aptitude for the banking mystery he made a point of learning enough of it to measure the great figure his father had played. It was not this, however, he mainly relished; it was the fine ivory surface, polished as by the English air, that the old man had opposed to possibilities of penetration. Daniel Touchett had been neither at Harvard nor at Oxford, and it was his own fault if he had placed in his son's hands the key to modern criticism. Ralph, whose head was full of ideas which his father had never guessed, had a high esteem for the latter's originality. Americans, rightly or wrongly, are commended for the ease with which they adapt themselves to foreign conditions; but Mr. Touchett had made of the very limits of his pliancy half the ground of his general success. He had retained in their freshness most of his marks of primary pressure; his tone, as his son always noted with pleasure, was that of the more luxuriant parts of New England. At the end of his life he had become, on his own ground, as mellow as he was rich; he combined consummate shrewdness with the disposition superficially to fraternise, and his ""social position,"" on which he had never wasted a care, had the firm perfection of an unthumbed fruit. It was perhaps his want of imagination and of what is called the historic consciousness; but to many of the impressions usually made by English life upon the cultivated stranger his sense was completely closed. There were certain differences he had never perceived, certain habits he had never formed, certain obscurities he had never sounded. As regards these latter, on the day he had sounded them his son would have thought less well of him.




Ralph, on leaving Oxford, had spent a couple of years in travelling; after which he had found himself perched on a high stool in his father's bank. The responsibility and honour of such positions is not, I believe, measured by the height of the stool, which depends upon other considerations: Ralph, indeed, who had very long legs, was fond of standing, and even of walking about, at his work. To this exercise, however, he was obliged to devote but a limited period, for at the end of some eighteen months he had become aware of his being seriously out of health. He had caught a violent cold, which fixed itself on his lungs and threw them into dire confusion. He had to give up work and apply, to the letter, the sorry injunction to take care of himself. At first he slighted the task; it appeared to him it was not himself in the least he was taking care of, but an uninteresting and uninterested person with whom he had nothing in common. This person, however, improved on acquaintance, and Ralph grew at last to have a certain grudging tolerance, even an undemonstrative respect, for him. Misfortune makes strange bedfellows, and our young man, feeling that he had something at stake in the matter—it usually struck him as his reputation for ordinary wit—devoted to his graceless charge an amount of attention of which note was duly taken and which had at least the effect of keeping the poor fellow alive. One of his lungs began to heal, the other promised to follow its example, and he was assured he might outweather a dozen winters if he would betake himself to those climates in which consumptives chiefly congregate. As he had grown extremely fond of London, he cursed the flatness of exile: but at the same time that he cursed he conformed, and gradually, when he found his sensitive organ grateful even for grim favours, he conferred them with a lighter hand. He wintered abroad, as the phrase is; basked in the sun, stopped at home when the wind blew, went to bed when it rained, and once or twice, when it had snowed overnight, almost never got up again.




A secret hoard of indifference—like a thick cake a fond old nurse might have slipped into his first school outfit—came to his aid and helped to reconcile him to sacrifice; since at the best he was too ill for aught but that arduous game. As he said to himself, there was really nothing he had wanted very much to do, so that he had at least not renounced the field of valour. At present, however, the fragrance of forbidden fruit seemed occasionally to float past him and remind him that the finest of pleasures is the rush of action. Living as he now lived was like reading a good book in a poor translation—a meagre entertainment for a young man who felt that he might have been an excellent linguist. He had good winters and poor winters, and while the former lasted he was sometimes the sport of a vision of virtual recovery. But this vision was dispelled some three years before the occurrence of the incidents with which this history opens: he had on that occasion remained later than usual in England and had been overtaken by bad weather before reaching Algiers. He arrived more dead than alive and lay there for several weeks between life and death. His convalescence was a miracle, but the first use he made of it was to assure himself that such miracles happen but once. He said to himself that his hour was in sight and that it behoved him to keep his eyes upon it, yet that it was also open to him to spend the interval as agreeably as might be consistent with such a preoccupation. With the prospect of losing them the simple use of his faculties became an exquisite pleasure; it seemed to him the joys of contemplation had never been sounded. He was far from the time when he had found it hard that he should be obliged to give up the idea of distinguishing himself; an idea none the less importunate for being vague and none the less delightful for having had to struggle in the same breast with bursts of inspiring self-criticism. His friends at present judged him more cheerful, and attributed it to a theory, over which they shook their heads knowingly, that he would recover his health. His serenity was but the array of wild flowers niched in his ruin.




It was very probably this sweet-tasting property of the observed thing in itself that was mainly concerned in Ralph's quickly-stirred interest in the advent of a young lady who was evidently not insipid. If he was consideringly disposed, something told him, here was occupation enough for a succession of days. It may be added, in summary fashion, that the imagination of loving—as distinguished from that of being loved —had still a place in his reduced sketch. He had only forbidden himself the riot of expression. However, he shouldn't inspire his cousin with a passion, nor would she be able, even should she try, to help him to one. ""And now tell me about the young lady,"" he said to his mother. ""What do you mean to do with her?""




Mrs. Touchett was prompt. ""I mean to ask your father to invite her to stay three or four weeks at Gardencourt.""




""You needn't stand on any such ceremony as that,"" said Ralph. ""My father will ask her as a matter of course.""




""I don't know about that. She's my niece; she's not his.""




""Good Lord, dear mother; what a sense of property! That's all the more reason for his asking her. But after that—I mean after three months (for its absurd asking the poor girl to remain but for three or four paltry weeks)—what do you mean to do with her?""




""I mean to take her to Paris. I mean to get her clothing.""




""Ah yes, that's of course. But independently of that?""




""I shall invite her to spend the autumn with me in Florence.""




""You don't rise above detail, dear mother,"" said Ralph. ""I should like to know what you mean to do with her in a general way.""




""My duty!"" Mrs. Touchett declared. ""I suppose you pity her very much,"" she added.




""No, I don't think I pity her. She doesn't strike me as inviting compassion. I think I envy her. Before being sure, however, give me a hint of where you see your duty.""




""In showing her four European countries—I shall leave her the choice of two of them—and in giving her the opportunity of perfecting herself in French, which she already knows very well.""




Ralph frowned a little. ""That sounds rather dry—even allowing her the choice of two of the countries.""




""If it's dry,"" said his mother with a laugh, ""you can leave Isabel alone to water it! She is as good as a summer rain, any day.""




""Do you mean she's a gifted being?""




""I don't know whether she's a gifted being, but she's a clever girl—with a strong will and a high temper. She has no idea of being bored.""




""I can imagine that,"" said Ralph; and then he added abruptly: ""How do you two get on?""




""Do you mean by that that I'm a bore? I don't think she finds me one. Some girls might, I know; but Isabel's too clever for that. I think I greatly amuse her. We get on because I understand her, I know the sort of girl she is. She's very frank, and I'm very frank: we know just what to expect of each other.""




""Ah, dear mother,"" Ralph exclaimed, ""one always knows what to expect of you! You've never surprised me but once, and that's to-day—in presenting me with a pretty cousin whose existence I had never suspected.""




""Do you think her so very pretty?""




""Very pretty indeed; but I don't insist upon that. It's her general air of being some one in particular that strikes me. Who is this rare creature, and what is she? Where did you find her, and how did you make her acquaintance?""




""I found her in an old house at Albany, sitting in a dreary room on a rainy day, reading a heavy book and boring herself to death. She didn't know she was bored, but when I left her no doubt of it she seemed very grateful for the service. You may say I shouldn't have enlightened he—I should have let her alone.

The young man spent an hour with his cousin; though she had been travelling half the day she appeared in no degree spent. She was really tired; she knew it, and knew she should pay for it on the morrow; but it was her habit at this period to carry exhaustion to the furthest point and confess to it only when dissimulation broke down. A fine hypocrisy was for the present possible; she was interested; she was, as she said to herself, floated. She asked Ralph to show her the pictures; there were a great many in the house, most of them of his own choosing. The best were arranged in an oaken gallery, of charming proportions, which had a sitting-room at either end of it and which in the evening was usually lighted. The light was insufficient to show the pictures to advantage, and the visit might have stood over to the morrow. This suggestion Ralph had ventured to make; but Isabel looked disappointed—smiling still, however—and said: ""If you please I should like to see them just a little."" She was eager, she knew she was eager and now seemed so; she couldn't help it. ""She doesn't take suggestions,"" Ralph said to himself; but he said it without irritation; her pressure amused and even pleased him. The lamps were on brackets, at intervals, and if the light was imperfect it was genial. It fell upon the vague squares of rich colour and on the faded gilding of heavy frames; it made a sheen on the polished floor of the gallery. Ralph took a candlestick and moved about, pointing out the things he liked; Isabel, inclining to one picture after another, indulged in little exclamations and murmurs. She was evidently a judge; she had a natural taste; he was struck with that. She took a candlestick herself and held it slowly here and there; she lifted it high, and as she did so he found himself pausing in the middle of the place and bending his eyes much less upon the pictures than on her presence. He lost nothing, in truth, by these wandering glances, for she was better worth looking at than most works of art. She was undeniably spare, and ponderably light, and proveably tall; when people had wished to distinguish her from the other two Miss Archers they had always called her the willowy one. Her hair, which was dark even to blackness, had been an object of envy to many women; her light grey eyes, a little too firm perhaps in her graver moments, had an enchanting range of concession. They walked slowly up one side of the gallery and down the other, and then she said: ""Well, now I know more than I did when I began!""




""You apparently have a great passion for knowledge,"" her cousin returned.




""I think I have; most girls are horridly ignorant.""




""You strike me as different from most girls.""




""Ah, some of them would—but the way they're talked to!"" murmured Isabel, who preferred not to dilate just yet on herself. Then in a moment, to change the subject, ""Please tell me—isn't there a ghost?"" she went on.




""A ghost?""




""A castle-spectre, a thing that appears. We call them ghosts in America.""




""So we do here, when we see them.""




""You do see them then? You ought to, in this romantic old house.""




""It's not a romantic old house,"" said Ralph. ""You'll be disappointed if you count on that. It's a dismally prosaic one; there's no romance here but what you may have brought with you.""




""I've brought a great deal; but it seems to me I've brought it to the right place.""




""To keep it out of harm, certainly; nothing will ever happen to it here, between my father and me.""




Isabel looked at him a moment. ""Is there never any one here but your father and you?""




""My mother, of course.""




""Oh, I know your mother; she's not romantic. Haven't you other people?""




""Very few.""




""I'm sorry for that; I like so much to see people.""




""Oh, we'll invite all the county to amuse you,"" said Ralph.




""Now you're making fun of me,"" the girl answered rather gravely. ""Who was the gentleman on the lawn when I arrived?""




""A county neighbour; he doesn't come very often.""




""I'm sorry for that; I liked him,"" said Isabel.




""Why, it seemed to me that you barely spoke to him,"" Ralph objected.




""Never mind, I like him all the same. I like your father too, immensely.""




""You can't do better than that. He's the dearest of the dear.""




""I'm so sorry he is ill,"" said Isabel.




""You must help me to nurse him; you ought to be a good nurse.""




""I don't think I am; I've been told I'm not; I'm said to have too many theories. But you haven't told me about the ghost,"" she added.




Ralph, however, gave no heed to this observation. ""You like my father and you like Lord Warburton. I infer also that you like my mother.""




""I like your mother very much, because—because—"" And Isabel found herself attempting to assign a reason for her affection for Mrs. Touchett.




""Ah, we never know why!"" said her companion, laughing.




""I always know why,"" the girl answered. ""It's because she doesn't expect one to like her. She doesn't care whether one does or not.""




""So you adore her—out of perversity? Well, I take greatly after my mother,"" said Ralph.




""I don't believe you do at all. You wish people to like you, and you try to make them do it.""




""Good heavens, how you see through one!"" he cried with a dismay that was not altogether jocular.




""But I like you all the same,"" his cousin went on. ""The way to clinch the matter will be to show me the ghost.""




Ralph shook his head sadly. ""I might show it to you, but you'd never see it. The privilege isn't given to every one; it's not enviable. It has never been seen by a young, happy, innocent person like you. You must have suffered first, have suffered greatly, have gained some miserable knowledge. In that way your eyes are opened to it. I saw it long ago,"" said Ralph.




""I told you just now I'm very fond of knowledge,"" Isabel answered.




""Yes, of happy knowledge—of pleasant knowledge. But you haven't suffered, and you're not made to suffer. I hope you'll never see the ghost!""




She had listened to him attentively, with a smile on her lips, but with a certain gravity in her eyes. Charming as he found her, she had struck him as rather presumptuous—indeed it was a part of her charm; and he wondered what she would say. ""I'm not afraid, you know,"" she said: which seemed quite presumptuous enough.




""You're not afraid of suffering?""




""Yes, I'm afraid of suffering. But I'm not afraid of ghosts. And I think people suffer too easily,"" she added.




""I don't believe you do,"" said Ralph, looking at her with his hands in his pockets.




""I don't think that's a fault,"" she answered. ""It's not absolutely necessary to suffer; we were not made for that.""




""You were not, certainly.""




""I'm not speaking of myself."" And she wandered off a little.




""No, it isn't a fault,"" said her cousin. ""It's a merit to be strong.""




""Only, if you don't suffer they call you hard,"" Isabel




remarked.




They passed out of the smaller drawing-room, into which they had returned from the gallery, and paused in the hall, at the foot of the staircase. Here Ralph presented his companion with her bedroom candle, which he had taken from a niche. ""Never mind what they call you. When you do suffer they call you an idiot. The great point's to be as happy as possible.""




She looked at him a little; she had taken her candle and placed her foot on the oaken stair. ""Well,"" she said, ""that's what I came to Europe for, to be as happy as possible. Good-night.""




""Good-night! I wish you all success, and shall be very glad to contribute to it!""




She turned away, and he watched her as she slowly ascended. Then, with his hands always in his pockets, he went back to the empty drawing-room."|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"
"ap 09:30"|"half-past nine o'clock"|"The two amused themselves, time and again, with talking of the attitude of the British public as if the young lady had been in a position to appeal to it; but in fact the British public remained for the present profoundly indifferent to Miss Isabel Archer, whose fortune had dropped her, as her cousin said, into the dullest house in England. Her gouty uncle received very little company, and Mrs. Touchett, not having cultivated relations with her husband's neighbours, was not warranted in expecting visits from them. She had, however, a peculiar taste; she liked to receive cards. For what is usually called social intercourse she had very little relish; but nothing pleased her more than to find her hall-table whitened with oblong morsels of symbolic pasteboard. She flattered herself that she was a very just woman, and had mastered the sovereign truth that nothing in this world is got for nothing. She had played no social part as mistress of Gardencourt, and it was not to be supposed that, in the surrounding country, a minute account should be kept of her comings and goings. But it is by no means certain that she did not feel it to be wrong that so little notice was taken of them and that her failure (really very gratuitous) to make herself important in the neighbourhood had not much to do with the acrimony of her allusions to her husband's adopted country. Isabel presently found herself in the singular situation of defending the British constitution against her aunt; Mrs. Touchett having formed the habit of sticking pins into this venerable instrument. Isabel always felt an impulse to pull out the pins; not that she imagined they inflicted any damage on the tough old parchment, but because it seemed to her her aunt might make better use of her sharpness. She was very critical herself—it was incidental to her age, her sex and her nationality; but she was very sentimental as well, and there was something in Mrs. Touchett's dryness that set her own moral fountains flowing.




""Now what's your point of view?"" she asked of her aunt. ""When you criticise everything here you should have a point of view. Yours doesn't seem to be American—you thought everything over there so disagreeable. When I criticise I have mine; it's thoroughly American!""




""My dear young lady,"" said Mrs. Touchett, ""there are as many points of view in the world as there are people of sense to take them. You may say that doesn't make them very numerous! American? Never in the world; that's shockingly narrow. My point of view, thank God, is personal!""




Isabel thought this a better answer than she admitted; it was a tolerable description of her own manner of judging, but it would not have sounded well for her to say so. On the lips of a person less advanced in life and less enlightened by experience than Mrs. Touchett such a declaration would savour of immodesty, even of arrogance. She risked it nevertheless in talking with Ralph, with whom she talked a great deal and with whom her conversation was of a sort that gave a large licence to extravagance. Her cousin used, as the phrase is, to chaff her; he very soon established with her a reputation for treating everything as a joke, and he was not a man to neglect the privileges such a reputation conferred. She accused him of an odious want of seriousness, of laughing at all things, beginning with himself. Such slender faculty of reverence as he possessed centred wholly upon his father; for the rest, he exercised his wit indifferently upon his father's son, this gentleman's weak lungs, his useless life, his fantastic mother, his friends (Lord Warburton in especial), his adopted, and his native country, his charming new-found cousin. ""I keep a band of music in my ante-room,"" he said once to her. ""It has orders to play without stopping; it renders me two excellent services. It keeps the sounds of the world from reaching the private apartments, and it makes the world think that dancing's going on within."" It was dance-music indeed that you usually heard when you came within ear-shot of Ralph's band; the liveliest waltzes seemed to float upon the air. Isabel often found herself irritated by this perpetual fiddling; she would have liked to pass through the ante-room, as her cousin called it, and enter the private apartments. It mattered little that he had assured her they were a very dismal place; she would have been glad to undertake to sweep them and set them in order. It was but half-hospitality to let her remain outside; to punish him for which Isabel administered innumerable taps with the ferule of her straight young wit. It must be said that her wit was exercised to a large extent in self-defence, for her cousin amused himself with calling her ""Columbia "" and accusing her of a patriotism so heated that it scorched. He drew a caricature of her in which she was represented as a very pretty young woman dressed, on the lines of the prevailing fashion, in the folds of the national banner. Isabel's chief dread in life at this period of her development was that she should appear narrow-minded; what she feared next afterwards was that she should really be so. But she nevertheless made no scruple of abounding in her cousin's sense and pretending to sigh for the charms of her native land. She would be as American as it pleased him to regard her, and if he chose to laugh at her she would give him plenty of occupation. She defended England against his mother, but when Ralph sang its praises on purpose, as she said, to work her up, she found herself able to differ from him on a variety of points. In fact, the quality of this small ripe country seemed as sweet to her as the taste of an October pear; and her satisfaction was at the root of the good spirits which enabled her to take her cousin's chaff and return it in kind. If her good-humour flagged at moments it was not because she thought herself ill-used, but because she suddenly felt sorry for Ralph. It seemed to her he was talking as a blind and had little heart in what he said. ""I don't know what's the matter with you,"" she observed to him once; ""but I suspect you're a great humbug.""




""That's your privilege,"" Ralph answered, who had not been used to being so crudely addressed.




""I don't know what you care for; I don't think you care for anything. You don't really care for England when you praise it; you don't care for America even when you pretend to abuse it.""




""I care for nothing but you, dear cousin,"" said Ralph.




""If I could believe even that, I should be very glad.""




""Ah well, I should hope so!"" the young man exclaimed.




Isabel might have believed it and not have been far from the truth. He thought a great deal about her; she was constantly present to his mind. At a time when his thoughts had been a good deal of a burden to him her sudden arrival, which promised nothing and was an open-handed gift of fate, had refreshed and quickened them, given them wings and something to fly for. Poor Ralph had been for many weeks steeped in melancholy; his outlook, habitually sombre, lay under the shadow of a deeper cloud. He had grown anxious about his father, whose gout, hitherto confined to his legs, had begun to ascend into regions more vital. The old man had been gravely ill in the spring, and the doctors had whispered to Ralph that another attack would be less easy to deal with. Just now he appeared disburdened of pain, but Ralph could not rid himself of a suspicion that this was a subterfuge of the enemy, who was waiting to take him off his guard. If the manoeuvre should succeed there would be little hope of any great resistance. Ralph had always taken for granted that his father would survive him—that his own name would be the first grimly called. The father and son had been close companions, and the idea of being left alone with the remnant of a tasteless life on his hands was not gratifying to the young man, who had always and tacitly counted upon his elder's help in making the best of a poor business. At the prospect of losing his great motive Ralph lost indeed his one inspiration. If they might die at the same time it would be all very well; but without the encouragement of his father's society he should barely have patience to await his own turn. He had not the incentive of feeling that he was indispensable to his mother; it was a rule with his mother to have no regrets. He bethought himself of course that it had been a small kindness to his father to wish that, of the two, the active rather than the passive party should know the felt wound; he remembered that the old man had always treated his own forecast of an early end as a clever fallacy, which he should be delighted to discredit so far as he might by dying first. But of the two triumphs, that of refuting a sophistical son and that of holding on a while longer to a state of being which, with all abatements, he enjoyed, Ralph deemed it no sin to hope the latter might be vouchsafed to Mr. Touchett.




These were nice questions, but Isabel's arrival put a stop to his puzzling over them. It even suggested there might be a compensation for the intolerable ennui of surviving his genial sire. He wondered whether he were harbouring ""love"" for this spontaneous young woman from Albany; but he judged that on the whole he was not. After he had known her for a week he quite made up his mind to this, and every day he felt a little more sure. Lord Warburton had been right about her; she was a really interesting little figure. Ralph wondered how their neighbour had found it out so soon; and then he said it was only another proof of his friend's high abilities, which he had always greatly admired. If his cousin were to be nothing more than an entertainment to him, Ralph was conscious she was an entertainment of a high order. ""A character like that,"" he said to himself—""a real little passionate force to see at play is the finest thing in nature. It's finer than the finest work of art—than a Greek bas-relief, than a great Titian, than a Gothic cathedral. It's very pleasant to be so well treated where one had least looked for it. I had never been more blue, more bored, than for a week before she came; I had never expected less that anything pleasant would happen. Suddenly I receive a Titian, by the post, to hang on my wall— a Greek bas-relief to stick over my chimney-piece. The key of a beautiful edifice is thrust into my hand, and I'm told to walk in and admire. My poor boy, you've been sadly ungrateful, and now you had better keep very quiet and never grumble again."" The sentiment of these reflexions was very just; but it was not exactly true that Ralph Touchett had had a key put into his hand. His cousin was a very brilliant girl, who would take, as he said, a good deal of knowing; but she needed the knowing, and his attitude with regard to her, though it was contemplative and critical, was not judicial. He surveyed the edifice from the outside and admired it greatly; he looked in at the windows and received an impression of proportions equally fair. But he felt that he saw it only by glimpses and that he had not yet stood under the roof. The door was fastened, and though he had keys in his pocket he had a conviction that none of them would fit. She was intelligent and generous; it was a fine free nature; but what was she going to do with herself? This question was irregular, for with most women one had no occasion to ask it. Most women did with themselves nothing at all; they waited, in attitudes more or less gracefully passive, for a man to come that way and furnish them with a destiny. Isabel's originality was that she gave one an impression of having intentions of her own. ""Whenever she executes them,"" said Ralph, ""may I be there to see!""




It devolved upon him of course to do the honours of the place. Mr. Touchett was confined to his chair, and his wife's position was that of rather a grim visitor; so that in the line of conduct that opened itself to Ralph duty and inclination were harmoniously mixed. He was not a great walker, but he strolled about the grounds with his cousin—a pastime for which the weather remained favourable with a persistency not allowed for in Isabel's somewhat lugubrious prevision of the climate; and in the long afternoons, of which the length was but the measure of her gratified eagerness, they took a boat on the river, the dear little river, as Isabel called it, where the opposite shore seemed still a part of the foreground of the landscape; or drove over the country in a phaeton—a low, capacious, thick-wheeled phaeton formerly much used by Mr. Touchett, but which he had now ceased to enjoy. Isabel enjoyed it largely and, handling the reins in a manner which approved itself to the groom as ""knowing,"" was never weary of driving her uncle's capital horses through winding lanes and byways full of the rural incidents she had confidently expected to find; past cottages thatched and timbered, past ale-houses latticed and sanded, past patches of ancient common and glimpses of empty parks, between hedgerows made thick by midsummer. When they reached home they usually found tea had been served on the lawn and that Mrs. Touchett had not shrunk from the extremity of handing her husband his cup. But the two for the most part sat silent; the old man with his head back and his eyes closed, his wife occupied with her knitting and wearing that appearance of rare profundity with which some ladies consider the movement of their needles.




One day, however, a visitor had arrived. The two young persons, after spending an hour on the river, strolled back to the house and perceived Lord Warburton sitting under the trees and engaged in conversation, of which even at a distance the desultory character was appreciable, with Mrs. Touchett. He had driven over from his own place with a portmanteau and had asked, as the father and son often invited him to do, for a dinner and a lodging. Isabel, seeing him for half an hour on the day of her arrival, had discovered in this brief space that she liked him; he had indeed rather sharply registered himself on her fine sense and she had thought of him several times. She had hoped she should see him again—hoped too that she should see a few others. Gardencourt was not dull; the place itself was sovereign, her uncle was more and more a sort of golden grandfather, and Ralph was unlike any cousin she had ever encountered—her idea of cousins having tended to gloom. Then her impressions were still so fresh and so quickly renewed that there was as yet hardly a hint of vacancy in the view. But Isabel had need to remind herself that she was interested in human nature and that her foremost hope in coming abroad had been that she should see a great many people. When Ralph said to her, as he had done several times, ""I wonder you find this endurable; you ought to see some of the neighbours and some of our friends, because we have really got a few, though you would never suppose it""—when he offered to invite what he called a ""lot of people"" and make her acquainted with English society, she encouraged the hospitable impulse and promised in advance to hurl herself into the fray. Little, however, for the present, had come of his offers, and it may be confided to the reader that if the young man delayed to carry them out it was because he found the labour of providing for his companion by no means so severe as to require extraneous help. Isabel had spoken to him very often about ""specimens;"" it was a word that played a considerable part in her vocabulary; she had given him to understand that she wished to see English society illustrated by eminent cases.




""Well now, there's a specimen,"" he said to her as they walked up from the riverside and he recognised Lord Warburton.




""A specimen of what?"" asked the girl.




""A specimen of an English gentleman.""




""Do you mean they're all like him?""




""Oh no; they're not all like him.""




""He's a favourable specimen then,"" said Isabel; ""because I'm sure he's nice.""




""Yes, he's very nice. And he's very fortunate.""




The fortunate Lord Warburton exchanged a handshake with our heroine and hoped she was very well. ""But I needn't ask that,"" he said, ""since you've been handling the oars.""




""I've been rowing a little,"" Isabel answered; ""but how should you know it?""




""Oh, I know he doesn't row; he's too lazy,"" said his lordship, indicating Ralph Touchett with a laugh.




""He has a good excuse for his laziness,"" Isabel rejoined, lowering her voice a little.




""Ah, he has a good excuse for everything!"" cried Lord Warburton, still with his sonorous mirth.




""My excuse for not rowing is that my cousin rows so well,"" said Ralph. ""She does everything well. She touches nothing that she doesn't adorn!""




""It makes one want to be touched, Miss Archer,"" Lord Warburton declared.




""Be touched in the right sense and you'll never look the worse for it,"" said Isabel, who, if it pleased her to hear it said that her accomplishments were numerous, was happily able to reflect that such complacency was not the indication of a feeble mind, inasmuch as there were several things in which she excelled. Her desire to think well of herself had at least the element of humility that it always needed to be supported by proof.




Lord Warburton not only spent the night at Gardencourt, but he was persuaded to remain over the second day; and when the second day was ended he determined to postpone his departure till the morrow. During this period he addressed many of his remarks to Isabel, who accepted this evidence of his esteem with a very good grace. She found herself liking him extremely; the first impression he had made on her had had weight, but at the end of an evening spent in his society she scarce fell short of seeing him—though quite without luridity—as a hero of romance. She retired to rest with a sense of good fortune, with a quickened consciousness of possible felicities. ""It's very nice to know two such charming people as those,"" she said, meaning by ""those"" her cousin and her cousin's friend. It must be added moreover that an incident had occurred which might have seemed to put her good-humour to the test. Mr. Touchett went to bed at half-past nine o'clock, but his wife remained in the drawing-room with the other members of the party. She prolonged her vigil for something less than an hour, and then, rising, observed to Isabel that it was time they should bid the gentlemen good-night. Isabel had as yet no desire to go to bed; the occasion wore, to her sense, a festive character, and feasts were not in the habit of terminating so early. So, without further thought, she replied, very simply—




""Need I go, dear aunt? I'll come up in half an hour.""




""It's impossible I should wait for you,"" Mrs. Touchett answered.




""Ah, you needn't wait! Ralph will light my candle,"" Isabel gaily engaged.




""I'll light your candle; do let me light your candle, Miss Archer!"" Lord Warburton exclaimed. ""Only I beg it shall not be before midnight.""




Mrs. Touchett fixed her bright little eyes upon him a moment and transferred them coldly to her niece. ""You can't stay alone with the gentlemen. You're not—you're not at your blest Albany, my dear.""




Isabel rose, blushing. ""I wish I were,"" she said.




""Oh, I say, mother!"" Ralph broke out.




""My dear Mrs. Touchett!"" Lord Warburton murmured.




""I didn't make your country, my lord,"" Mrs. Touchett said majestically. ""I must take it as I find it.""




""Can't I stay with my own cousin?"" Isabel enquired.




""I'm not aware that Lord Warburton is your cousin.""




""Perhaps I had better go to bed!"" the visitor suggested. ""That will arrange it.""




Mrs. Touchett gave a little look of despair and sat down again. ""Oh, if it's necessary I'll stay up till midnight.""




Ralph meanwhile handed Isabel her candlestick. He had been watching her; it had seemed to him her temper was involved—an accident that might be interesting. But if he had expected anything of a flare he was disappointed, for the girl simply laughed a little, nodded good-night and withdrew accompanied by her aunt. For himself he was annoyed at his mother, though he thought she was right. Above-stairs the two ladies separated at Mrs. Touchett's door. Isabel had said nothing on her way up.




""Of course you're vexed at my interfering with you,"" said Mrs. Touchett.




Isabel considered. ""I'm not vexed, but I'm surprised—and a good deal mystified. Wasn't it proper I should remain in the drawing-room?""




""Not in the least. Young girls here—in decent houses—don't sit alone with the gentlemen late at night.""




""You were very right to tell me then,"" said Isabel. ""I don't understand it, but I'm very glad to know it.




""I shall always tell you,"" her aunt answered, ""whenever I see you taking what seems to me too much liberty.""




""Pray do; but I don't say I shall always think your remonstrance just.""




""Very likely not. You're too fond of your own ways.""




""Yes, I think I'm very fond of them. But I always want to know the things one shouldn't do.""




""So as to do them?"" asked her aunt.




""So as to choose,"" said Isabel."|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"

He drew a caricature of her in which she was represented as a very pretty young woman dressed, on the lines of the prevailing fashion, in the folds of the national banner. Isabel's chief dread in life at this period of her development was that she should appear narrow-minded; what she feared next afterwards was that she should really be so. But she nevertheless made no scruple of abounding in her cousin's sense and pretending to sigh for the charms of her native land. She would be as American as it pleased him to regard her, and if he chose to laugh at her she would give him plenty of occupation. She defended England against his mother, but when Ralph sang its praises on purpose, as she said, to work her up, she found herself able to differ from him on a variety of points. In fact, the quality of this small ripe country seemed as sweet to her as the taste of an October pear; and her satisfaction was at the root of the good spirits which enabled her to take her cousin's chaff and return it in kind. If her good-humour flagged at moments it was not because she thought herself ill-used, but because she suddenly felt sorry for Ralph. It seemed to her he was talking as a blind and had little heart in what he said. ""I don't know what's the matter with you,"" she observed to him once; ""but I suspect you're a great humbug.""




""That's your privilege,"" Ralph answered, who had not been used to being so crudely addressed.




""I don't know what you care for; I don't think you care for anything. You don't really care for England when you praise it; you don't care for America even when you pretend to abuse it.""




""I care for nothing but you, dear cousin,"" said Ralph.




""If I could believe even that, I should be very glad.""




""Ah well, I should hope so!"" the young man exclaimed.




Isabel might have believed it and not have been far from the truth. He thought a great deal about her; she was constantly present to his mind. At a time when his thoughts had been a good deal of a burden to him her sudden arrival, which promised nothing and was an open-handed gift of fate, had refreshed and quickened them, given them wings and something to fly for. Poor Ralph had been for many weeks steeped in melancholy; his outlook, habitually sombre, lay under the shadow of a deeper cloud. He had grown anxious about his father, whose gout, hitherto confined to his legs, had begun to ascend into regions more vital. The old man had been gravely ill in the spring, and the doctors had whispered to Ralph that another attack would be less easy to deal with. Just now he appeared disburdened of pain, but Ralph could not rid himself of a suspicion that this was a subterfuge of the enemy, who was waiting to take him off his guard. If the manoeuvre should succeed there would be little hope of any great resistance. Ralph had always taken for granted that his father would survive him—that his own name would be the first grimly called. The father and son had been close companions, and the idea of being left alone with the remnant of a tasteless life on his hands was not gratifying to the young man, who had always and tacitly counted upon his elder's help in making the best of a poor business. At the prospect of losing his great motive Ralph lost indeed his one inspiration. If they might die at the same time it would be all very well; but without the encouragement of his father's society he should barely have patience to await his own turn. He had not the incentive of feeling that he was indispensable to his mother; it was a rule with his mother to have no regrets. He bethought himself of course that it had been a small kindness to his father to wish that, of the two, the active rather than the passive party should know the felt wound; he remembered that the old man had always treated his own forecast of an early end as a clever fallacy, which he should be delighted to discredit so far as he might by dying first. But of the two triumphs, that of refuting a sophistical son and that of holding on a while longer to a state of being which, with all abatements, he enjoyed, Ralph deemed it no sin to hope the latter might be vouchsafed to Mr. Touchett.




These were nice questions, but Isabel's arrival put a stop to his puzzling over them. It even suggested there might be a compensation for the intolerable ennui of surviving his genial sire. He wondered whether he were harbouring ""love"" for this spontaneous young woman from Albany; but he judged that on the whole he was not. After he had known her for a week he quite made up his mind to this, and every day he felt a little more sure. Lord Warburton had been right about her; she was a really interesting little figure. Ralph wondered how their neighbour had found it out so soon; and then he said it was only another proof of his friend's high abilities, which he had always greatly admired. If his cousin were to be nothing more than an entertainment to him, Ralph was conscious she was an entertainment of a high order. ""A character like that,"" he said to himself—""a real little passionate force to see at play is the finest thing in nature. It's finer than the finest work of art—than a Greek bas-relief, than a great Titian, than a Gothic cathedral. It's very pleasant to be so well treated where one had least looked for it. I had never been more blue, more bored, than for a week before she came; I had never expected less that anything pleasant would happen. Suddenly I receive a Titian, by the post, to hang on my wall— a Greek bas-relief to stick over my chimney-piece. The key of a beautiful edifice is thrust into my hand, and I'm told to walk in and admire. My poor boy, you've been sadly ungrateful, and now you had better keep very quiet and never grumble again."" The sentiment of these reflexions was very just; but it was not exactly true that Ralph Touchett had had a key put into his hand. His cousin was a very brilliant girl, who would take, as he said, a good deal of knowing; but she needed the knowing, and his attitude with regard to her, though it was contemplative and critical, was not judicial. He surveyed the edifice from the outside and admired it greatly; he looked in at the windows and received an impression of proportions equally fair. But he felt that he saw it only by glimpses and that he had not yet stood under the roof. The door was fastened, and though he had keys in his pocket he had a conviction that none of them would fit. She was intelligent and generous; it was a fine free nature; but what was she going to do with herself? This question was irregular, for with most women one had no occasion to ask it. Most women did with themselves nothing at all; they waited, in attitudes more or less gracefully passive, for a man to come that way and furnish them with a destiny. Isabel's originality was that she gave one an impression of having intentions of her own. ""Whenever she executes them,"" said Ralph, ""may I be there to see!""




It devolved upon him of course to do the honours of the place. Mr. Touchett was confined to his chair, and his wife's position was that of rather a grim visitor; so that in the line of conduct that opened itself to Ralph duty and inclination were harmoniously mixed. He was not a great walker, but he strolled about the grounds with his cousin—a pastime for which the weather remained favourable with a persistency not allowed for in Isabel's somewhat lugubrious prevision of the climate; and in the long afternoons, of which the length was but the measure of her gratified eagerness, they took a boat on the river, the dear little river, as Isabel called it, where the opposite shore seemed still a part of the foreground of the landscape; or drove over the country in a phaeton—a low, capacious, thick-wheeled phaeton formerly much used by Mr. Touchett, but which he had now ceased to enjoy. Isabel enjoyed it largely and, handling the reins in a manner which approved itself to the groom as ""knowing,"" was never weary of driving her uncle's capital horses through winding lanes and byways full of the rural incidents she had confidently expected to find; past cottages thatched and timbered, past ale-houses latticed and sanded, past patches of ancient common and glimpses of empty parks, between hedgerows made thick by midsummer. When they reached home they usually found tea had been served on the lawn and that Mrs. Touchett had not shrunk from the extremity of handing her husband his cup. But the two for the most part sat silent; the old man with his head back and his eyes closed, his wife occupied with her knitting and wearing that appearance of rare profundity with which some ladies consider the movement of their needles.




One day, however, a visitor had arrived. The two young persons, after spending an hour on the river, strolled back to the house and perceived Lord Warburton sitting under the trees and engaged in conversation, of which even at a distance the desultory character was appreciable, with Mrs. Touchett. He had driven over from his own place with a portmanteau and had asked, as the father and son often invited him to do, for a dinner and a lodging. Isabel, seeing him for half an hour on the day of her arrival, had discovered in this brief space that she liked him; he had indeed rather sharply registered himself on her fine sense and she had thought of him several times. She had hoped she should see him again—hoped too that she should see a few others. Gardencourt was not dull; the place itself was sovereign, her uncle was more and more a sort of golden grandfather, and Ralph was unlike any cousin she had ever encountered—her idea of cousins having tended to gloom. Then her impressions were still so fresh and so quickly renewed that there was as yet hardly a hint of vacancy in the view. But Isabel had need to remind herself that she was interested in human nature and that her foremost hope in coming abroad had been that she should see a great many people. When Ralph said to her, as he had done several times, ""I wonder you find this endurable; you ought to see some of the neighbours and some of our friends, because we have really got a few, though you would never suppose it""—when he offered to invite what he called a ""lot of people"" and make her acquainted with English society, she encouraged the hospitable impulse and promised in advance to hurl herself into the fray. Little, however, for the present, had come of his offers, and it may be confided to the reader that if the young man delayed to carry them out it was because he found the labour of providing for his companion by no means so severe as to require extraneous help. Isabel had spoken to him very often about ""specimens;"" it was a word that played a considerable part in her vocabulary; she had given him to understand that she wished to see English society illustrated by eminent cases.




""Well now, there's a specimen,"" he said to her as they walked up from the riverside and he recognised Lord Warburton.




""A specimen of what?"" asked the girl.




""A specimen of an English gentleman.""




""Do you mean they're all like him?""




""Oh no; they're not all like him.""




""He's a favourable specimen then,"" said Isabel; ""because I'm sure he's nice.""




""Yes, he's very nice. And he's very fortunate.""




The fortunate Lord Warburton exchanged a handshake with our heroine and hoped she was very well. ""But I needn't ask that,"" he said, ""since you've been handling the oars.""




""I've been rowing a little,"" Isabel answered; ""but how should you know it?""




""Oh, I know he doesn't row; he's too lazy,"" said his lordship, indicating Ralph Touchett with a laugh.




""He has a good excuse for his laziness,"" Isabel rejoined, lowering her voice a little.




""Ah, he has a good excuse for everything!"" cried Lord Warburton, still with his sonorous mirth.




""My excuse for not rowing is that my cousin rows so well,"" said Ralph. ""She does everything well. She touches nothing that she doesn't adorn!""




""It makes one want to be touched, Miss Archer,"" Lord Warburton declared.




""Be touched in the right sense and you'll never look the worse for it,"" said Isabel, who, if it pleased her to hear it said that her accomplishments were numerous, was happily able to reflect that such complacency was not the indication of a feeble mind, inasmuch as there were several things in which she excelled. Her desire to think well of herself had at least the element of humility that it always needed to be supported by proof.




Lord Warburton not only spent the night at Gardencourt, but he was persuaded to remain over the second day; and when the second day was ended he determined to postpone his departure till the morrow. During this period he addressed many of his remarks to Isabel, who accepted this evidence of his esteem with a very good grace. She found herself liking him extremely; the first impression he had made on her had had weight, but at the end of an evening spent in his society she scarce fell short of seeing him—though quite without luridity—as a hero of romance. She retired to rest with a sense of good fortune, with a quickened consciousness of possible felicities. ""It's very nice to know two such charming people as those,"" she said, meaning by ""those"" her cousin and her cousin's friend. It must be added moreover that an incident had occurred which might have seemed to put her good-humour to the test. Mr. Touchett went to bed at half-past nine o'clock, but his wife remained in the drawing-room with the other members of the party. She prolonged her vigil for something less than an hour, and then, rising, observed to Isabel that it was time they should bid the gentlemen good-night. Isabel had as yet no desire to go to bed; the occasion wore, to her sense, a festive character, and feasts were not in the habit of terminating so early. So, without further thought, she replied, very simply—




""Need I go, dear aunt? I'll come up in half an hour.""




""It's impossible I should wait for you,"" Mrs. Touchett answered.




""Ah, you needn't wait! Ralph will light my candle,"" Isabel gaily engaged.




""I'll light your candle; do let me light your candle, Miss Archer!"" Lord Warburton exclaimed. ""Only I beg it shall not be before midnight.""




Mrs. Touchett fixed her bright little eyes upon him a moment and transferred them coldly to her niece. ""You can't stay alone with the gentlemen. You're not—you're not at your blest Albany, my dear.""




Isabel rose, blushing. ""I wish I were,"" she said.




""Oh, I say, mother!"" Ralph broke out.




""My dear Mrs. Touchett!"" Lord Warburton murmured.




""I didn't make your country, my lord,"" Mrs. Touchett said majestically. ""I must take it as I find it.""




""Can't I stay with my own cousin?"" Isabel enquired.




""I'm not aware that Lord Warburton is your cousin.""




""Perhaps I had better go to bed!"" the visitor suggested. ""That will arrange it.""




Mrs. Touchett gave a little look of despair and sat down again. ""Oh, if it's necessary I'll stay up till midnight.""




Ralph meanwhile handed Isabel her candlestick. He had been watching her; it had seemed to him her temper was involved—an accident that might be interesting. But if he had expected anything of a flare he was disappointed, for the girl simply laughed a little, nodded good-night and withdrew accompanied by her aunt. For himself he was annoyed at his mother, though he thought she was right. Above-stairs the two ladies separated at Mrs. Touchett's door. Isabel had said nothing on her way up.




""Of course you're vexed at my interfering with you,"" said Mrs. Touchett.




Isabel considered. ""I'm not vexed, but I'm surprised—and a good deal mystified. Wasn't it proper I should remain in the drawing-room?""




""Not in the least. Young girls here—in decent houses—don't sit alone with the gentlemen late at night.""




""You were very right to tell me then,"" said Isabel. ""I don't understand it, but I'm very glad to know it.




""I shall always tell you,"" her aunt answered, ""whenever I see you taking what seems to me too much liberty.""




""Pray do; but I don't say I shall always think your remonstrance just.""




""Very likely not. You're too fond of your own ways.""




""Yes, I think I'm very fond of them. But I always want to know the things one shouldn't do.""




""So as to do them?"" asked her aunt.




""So as to choose,"" said Isabel."|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"
00:00|midnight|"The two amused themselves, time and again, with talking of the attitude of the British public as if the young lady had been in a position to appeal to it; but in fact the British public remained for the present profoundly indifferent to Miss Isabel Archer, whose fortune had dropped her, as her cousin said, into the dullest house in England. Her gouty uncle received very little company, and Mrs. Touchett, not having cultivated relations with her husband's neighbours, was not warranted in expecting visits from them. She had, however, a peculiar taste; she liked to receive cards. For what is usually called social intercourse she had very little relish; but nothing pleased her more than to find her hall-table whitened with oblong morsels of symbolic pasteboard. She flattered herself that she was a very just woman, and had mastered the sovereign truth that nothing in this world is got for nothing. She had played no social part as mistress of Gardencourt, and it was not to be supposed that, in the surrounding country, a minute account should be kept of her comings and goings. But it is by no means certain that she did not feel it to be wrong that so little notice was taken of them and that her failure (really very gratuitous) to make herself important in the neighbourhood had not much to do with the acrimony of her allusions to her husband's adopted country. Isabel presently found herself in the singular situation of defending the British constitution against her aunt; Mrs. Touchett having formed the habit of sticking pins into this venerable instrument. Isabel always felt an impulse to pull out the pins; not that she imagined they inflicted any damage on the tough old parchment, but because it seemed to her her aunt might make better use of her sharpness. She was very critical herself—it was incidental to her age, her sex and her nationality; but she was very sentimental as well, and there was something in Mrs. Touchett's dryness that set her own moral fountains flowing.




""Now what's your point of view?"" she asked of her aunt. ""When you criticise everything here you should have a point of view. Yours doesn't seem to be American—you thought everything over there so disagreeable. When I criticise I have mine; it's thoroughly American!""




""My dear young lady,"" said Mrs. Touchett, ""there are as many points of view in the world as there are people of sense to take them. You may say that doesn't make them very numerous! American? Never in the world; that's shockingly narrow. My point of view, thank God, is personal!""




Isabel thought this a better answer than she admitted; it was a tolerable description of her own manner of judging, but it would not have sounded well for her to say so. On the lips of a person less advanced in life and less enlightened by experience than Mrs. Touchett such a declaration would savour of immodesty, even of arrogance. She risked it nevertheless in talking with Ralph, with whom she talked a great deal and with whom her conversation was of a sort that gave a large licence to extravagance. Her cousin used, as the phrase is, to chaff her; he very soon established with her a reputation for treating everything as a joke, and he was not a man to neglect the privileges such a reputation conferred. She accused him of an odious want of seriousness, of laughing at all things, beginning with himself. Such slender faculty of reverence as he possessed centred wholly upon his father; for the rest, he exercised his wit indifferently upon his father's son, this gentleman's weak lungs, his useless life, his fantastic mother, his friends (Lord Warburton in especial), his adopted, and his native country, his charming new-found cousin. ""I keep a band of music in my ante-room,"" he said once to her. ""It has orders to play without stopping; it renders me two excellent services. It keeps the sounds of the world from reaching the private apartments, and it makes the world think that dancing's going on within."" It was dance-music indeed that you usually heard when you came within ear-shot of Ralph's band; the liveliest waltzes seemed to float upon the air. Isabel often found herself irritated by this perpetual fiddling; she would have liked to pass through the ante-room, as her cousin called it, and enter the private apartments. It mattered little that he had assured her they were a very dismal place; she would have been glad to undertake to sweep them and set them in order. It was but half-hospitality to let her remain outside; to punish him for which Isabel administered innumerable taps with the ferule of her straight young wit. It must be said that her wit was exercised to a large extent in self-defence, for her cousin amused himself with calling her ""Columbia "" and accusing her of a patriotism so heated that it scorched. He drew a caricature of her in which she was represented as a very pretty young woman dressed, on the lines of the prevailing fashion, in the folds of the national banner. Isabel's chief dread in life at this period of her development was that she should appear narrow-minded; what she feared next afterwards was that she should really be so. But she nevertheless made no scruple of abounding in her cousin's sense and pretending to sigh for the charms of her native land. She would be as American as it pleased him to regard her, and if he chose to laugh at her she would give him plenty of occupation. She defended England against his mother, but when Ralph sang its praises on purpose, as she said, to work her up, she found herself able to differ from him on a variety of points.

It seemed to her he was talking as a blind and had little heart in what he said. ""I don't know what's the matter with you,"" she observed to him once; ""but I suspect you're a great humbug.""




""That's your privilege,"" Ralph answered, who had not been used to being so crudely addressed.




""I don't know what you care for; I don't think you care for anything. You don't really care for England when you praise it; you don't care for America even when you pretend to abuse it.""




""I care for nothing but you, dear cousin,"" said Ralph.




""If I could believe even that, I should be very glad.""




""Ah well, I should hope so!"" the young man exclaimed.




Isabel might have believed it and not have been far from the truth. He thought a great deal about her; she was constantly present to his mind. At a time when his thoughts had been a good deal of a burden to him her sudden arrival, which promised nothing and was an open-handed gift of fate, had refreshed and quickened them, given them wings and something to fly for.

""Oh no; they're not all like him.""




""He's a favourable specimen then,"" said Isabel; ""because I'm sure he's nice.""




""Yes, he's very nice. And he's very fortunate.""




The fortunate Lord Warburton exchanged a handshake with our heroine and hoped she was very well. ""But I needn't ask that,"" he said, ""since you've been handling the oars.""

She prolonged her vigil for something less than an hour, and then, rising, observed to Isabel that it was time they should bid the gentlemen good-night. Isabel had as yet no desire to go to bed; the occasion wore, to her sense, a festive character, and feasts were not in the habit of terminating so early. So, without further thought, she replied, very simply—




""Need I go, dear aunt? I'll come up in half an hour.""




""It's impossible I should wait for you,"" Mrs. Touchett answered.




""Ah, you needn't wait! Ralph will light my candle,"" Isabel gaily engaged.




""I'll light your candle; do let me light your candle, Miss Archer!"" Lord Warburton exclaimed. ""Only I beg it shall not be before midnight.""




Mrs. Touchett fixed her bright little eyes upon him a moment and transferred them coldly to her niece. ""You can't stay alone with the gentlemen. You're not—you're not at your blest Albany, my dear.""




Isabel rose, blushing. ""I wish I were,"" she said.




""Oh, I say, mother!"" Ralph broke out.




""My dear Mrs. Touchett!"" Lord Warburton murmured.




""I didn't make your country, my lord,"" Mrs. Touchett said majestically. ""I must take it as I find it.""




""Can't I stay with my own cousin?"" Isabel enquired.




""I'm not aware that Lord Warburton is your cousin.""




""Perhaps I had better go to bed!"" the visitor suggested. ""That will arrange it.""




Mrs. Touchett gave a little look of despair and sat down again. ""Oh, if it's necessary I'll stay up till midnight.""




Ralph meanwhile handed Isabel her candlestick. He had been watching her; it had seemed to him her temper was involved—an accident that might be interesting. But if he had expected anything of a flare he was disappointed, for the girl simply laughed a little, nodded good-night and withdrew accompanied by her aunt. For himself he was annoyed at his mother, though he thought she was right. Above-stairs the two ladies separated at Mrs. Touchett's door. Isabel had said nothing on her way up.




""Of course you're vexed at my interfering with you,"" said Mrs. Touchett.




Isabel considered. ""I'm not vexed, but I'm surprised—and a good deal mystified. Wasn't it proper I should remain in the drawing-room?""




""Not in the least. Young girls here—in decent houses—don't sit alone with the gentlemen late at night.""




""You were very right to tell me then,"" said Isabel. ""I don't understand it, but I'm very glad to know it.




""I shall always tell you,"" her aunt answered, ""whenever I see you taking what seems to me too much liberty.""




""Pray do; but I don't say I shall always think your remonstrance just.""




""Very likely not. You're too fond of your own ways.""




""Yes, I think I'm very fond of them. But I always want to know the things one shouldn't do.""




""So as to do them?"" asked her aunt.




""So as to choose,"" said Isabel."|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"
"ap 02:00"|"two o'clock"|"Miss Stackpole would have prepared to start immediately; but Isabel, as we have seen, had been notified that Lord Warburton would come again to Gardencourt, and she believed it her duty to remain there and see him. For four or five days he had made no response to her letter; then he had written, very briefly, to say he would come to luncheon two days later. There was something in these delays and postponements that touched the girl and renewed her sense of his desire to be considerate and patient, not to appear to urge her too grossly; a consideration the more studied that she was so sure he ""really liked"" her. Isabel told her uncle she had written to him, mentioning also his intention of coming; and the old man, in consequence, left his room earlier than usual and made his appearance at the two o'clock repast. This was by no means an act of vigilance on his part, but the fruit of a benevolent belief that his being of the company might help to cover any conjoined straying away in case Isabel should give their noble visitor another hearing. That personage drove over from Lockleigh and brought the elder of his sisters with him, a measure presumably dictated by reflexions of the same order as Mr. Touchett's. The two visitors were introduced to Miss Stackpole, who, at luncheon, occupied a seat adjoining Lord Warburton's. Isabel, who was nervous and had no relish for the prospect of again arguing the question he had so prematurely opened, could not help admiring his good-humoured self-possession, which quite disguised the symptoms of that preoccupation with her presence it was natural she should suppose him to feel. He neither looked at her nor spoke to her, and the only sign of his emotion was that he avoided meeting her eyes. He had plenty of talk for the others, however, and he appeared to eat his luncheon with discrimination and appetite. Miss Molyneux, who had a smooth, nun-like forehead and wore a large silver cross suspended from her neck, was evidently preoccupied with Henrietta Stackpole, upon whom her eyes constantly rested in a manner suggesting a conflict between deep alienation and yearning wonder. Of the two ladies from Lockleigh she was the one Isabel had liked best; there was such a world of hereditary quiet in her. Isabel was sure moreover that her mild forehead and silver cross referred to some weird Anglican mystery—some delightful reinstitution perhaps of the quaint office of the canoness. She wondered what Miss Molyneux would think of her if she knew Miss Archer had refused her brother; and then she felt sure that Miss Molyneux would never know—that Lord Warburton never told her such things. He was fond of her and kind to her, but on the whole he told her little. Such, at least, was Isabel's theory; when, at table, she was not occupied in conversation she was usually occupied in forming theories about her neighbours. According to Isabel, if Miss Molyneux should ever learn what had passed between Miss Archer and Lord Warburton she would probably be shocked at such a girl's failure to rise; or no, rather (this was our heroine's last position) she would impute to the young American but a due consciousness of inequality.




Whatever Isabel might have made of her opportunities, at all events, Henrietta Stackpole was by no means disposed to neglect those in which she now found herself immersed. ""Do you know you're the first lord I've ever seen?"" she said very promptly to her neighbour. ""I suppose you think I'm awfully benighted.""




""You've escaped seeing some very ugly men,"" Lord Warburton answered, looking a trifle absently about the table.




""Are they very ugly? They try to make us believe in America that they're all handsome and magnificent and that they wear wonderful robes and crowns.""




""Ah, the robes and crowns are gone out of fashion,"" said Lord Warburton, ""like your tomahawks and revolvers.""




""I'm sorry for that; I think an aristocracy ought to be splendid,"" Henrietta declared. ""If it's not that, what is it?""




""Oh, you know, it isn't much, at the best,"" her neighbour allowed. ""Won't you have a potato?""




""I don't care much for these European potatoes. I shouldn't know you from an ordinary American gentleman.""




""Do talk to me as if I were one,"" said Lord Warburton. ""I don't see how you manage to get on without potatoes; you must find so few things to eat over here.""




Henrietta was silent a little; there was a chance he was not sincere. ""I've had hardly any appetite since I've been here,"" she went on at last; ""so it doesn't much matter. I don't approve of you, you know; I feel as if I ought to tell you that.""




""Don't approve of me?""




""Yes; I don't suppose any one ever said such a thing to you before, did they? I don't approve of lords as an institution. I think the world has got beyond them—far beyond.""




""Oh, so do I. I don't approve of myself in the least. Sometimes it comes over me—how I should object to myself if I were not myself, don't you know? But that's rather good, by the way—not to be vainglorious.""




""Why don't you give it up then?"" Miss Stackpole enquired.




""Give up—a—?"" asked Lord Warburton, meeting her harsh inflexion with a very mellow one.




""Give up being a lord.""




""Oh, I'm so little of one! One would really forget all about it if you wretched Americans were not constantly reminding one. However, I do think of giving it up, the little there is left of it, one of these days.""




""I should like to see you do it!"" Henrietta exclaimed rather grimly.




""I'll invite you to the ceremony; we'll have a supper and a dance.""




""Well,"" said Miss Stackpole, ""I like to see all sides. I don't approve of a privileged class, but I like to hear what they have to say for themselves.""




""Mighty little, as you see!""




""I should like to draw you out a little more,"" Henrietta continued. ""But you're always looking away. You're afraid of meeting my eye. I see you want to escape me.""




""No, I'm only looking for those despised potatoes.""




""Please explain about that young lady—your sister—then. I don't understand about her. Is she a Lady?""




""She's a capital good girl.""




""I don't like the way you say that—as if you wanted to change the subject. Is her position inferior to yours?""




""We neither of us have any position to speak of; but she's better off than I, because she has none of the bother.""




""Yes, she doesn't look as if she had much bother. I wish I had as little bother as that. You do produce quiet people over here, whatever else you may do.""




""Ah, you see one takes life easily, on the whole,"" said Lord Warburton. ""And then you know we're very dull. Ah, we can be dull when we try!""




""I should advise you to try something else. I shouldn't know what to talk to your sister about; she looks so different. Is that silver cross a badge?""




""A badge?""




""A sign of rank.""




Lord Warburton's glance had wandered a good deal, but at this it met the gaze of his neighbour. ""Oh yes,"" he answered in a moment; ""the women go in for those things. The silver cross is worn by the eldest daughters of Viscounts."" Which was his harmless revenge for having occasionally had his credulity too easily engaged in America. After luncheon he proposed to Isabel to come into the gallery and look at the pictures; and though she knew he had seen the pictures twenty times she complied without criticising this pretext. Her conscience now was very easy; ever since she sent him her letter she had felt particularly light of spirit. He walked slowly to the end of the gallery, staring at its contents and saying nothing; and then he suddenly broke out: ""I hoped you wouldn't write to me that way.""




""It was the only way, Lord Warburton,"" said the girl. ""Do try and believe that.""




""If I could believe it of course I should let you alone. But we can't believe by willing it; and I confess I don't understand. I could understand your disliking me; that I could understand well. But that you should admit you do—""




""What have I admitted?"" Isabel interrupted, turning slightly pale.




""That you think me a good fellow; isn't that it?"" She said nothing, and he went on: ""You don't seem to have any reason, and that gives me a sense of injustice.""




""I have a reason, Lord Warburton."" She said it in a tone that made his heart contract.




""I should like very much to know it.""




""I'll tell you some day when there's more to show for it.""




""Excuse my saying that in the mean time I must doubt of it.""




""You make me very unhappy,"" said Isabel.




""I'm not sorry for that; it may help you to know how I feel. Will you kindly answer me a question?"" Isabel made no audible assent, but he apparently saw in her eyes something that gave him courage to go on. ""Do you prefer some one else?""




""That's a question I'd rather not answer.""




""Ah, you do then!"" her suitor murmured with bitterness.




The bitterness touched her, and she cried out: ""You're mistaken! I don't.""




He sat down on a bench, unceremoniously, doggedly, like a man in trouble; leaning his elbows on his knees and staring at the floor. ""I can't even be glad of that,"" he said at last, throwing himself back against the wall; ""for that would be an excuse.""




She raised her eyebrows in surprise. ""An excuse? Must I excuse myself?""




He paid, however, no answer to the question. Another idea had come into his head. ""Is it my political opinions? Do you think I go too far?""




""I can't object to your political opinions, because I don't understand them.""




""You don't care what I think!"" he cried, getting up. ""It's all the same to you.""




Isabel walked to the other side of the gallery and stood there showing him her charming back, her light slim figure, the length of her white neck as she bent her head, and the density of her dark braids. She stopped in front of a small picture as if for the purpose of examining it; and there was something so young and free in her movement that her very pliancy seemed to mock at him. Her eyes, however, saw nothing; they had suddenly been suffused with tears. In a moment he followed her, and by this time she had brushed her tears away; but when she turned round her face was pale and the expression of her eyes strange. ""That reason that I wouldn't tell you—I'll tell it you after all. It's that I can't escape my fate.""




""Your fate?""




""I should try to escape it if I were to marry you.""




""I don't understand. Why should not that be your fate as well as anything else?""




""Because it's not,"" said Isabel femininely. ""I know it's not. It's not my fate to give up—I know it can't be.""




Poor Lord Warburton stared, an interrogative point in either eye. ""Do you call marrying me giving up?""




""Not in the usual sense. It's getting—getting—getting a great deal. But it's giving up other chances.""




""Other chances for what?""




""I don't mean chances to marry,"" said Isabel, her colour quickly coming back to her. And then she stopped, looking down with a deep frown, as if it were hopeless to attempt to make her meaning clear.




""I don't think it presumptuous in me to suggest that you'll gain more than you'll lose,"" her companion observed.




""I can't escape unhappiness,"" said Isabel. ""In marrying you I shall be trying to.""




""I don't know whether you'd try to, but you certainly would: that I must in candour admit!"" he exclaimed with an anxious laugh.




""I mustn't—I can't!"" cried the girl.




""Well, if you're bent on being miserable I don't see why you should make me so. Whatever charms a life of misery may have for you, it has none for me.




""I'm not bent on a life of misery,"" said Isabel. ""I've always been intensely determined to be happy, and I've often believed I should be. I've told people that; you can ask them. But it comes over me every now and then that I can never be happy in any extraordinary way; not by turning away, by separating myself.""




""By separating yourself from what?""




""From life. From the usual chances and dangers, from what most people know and suffer.""




Lord Warburton broke into a smile that almost denoted hope. ""Why, my dear Miss Archer,"" he began to explain with the most considerate eagerness, ""I don't offer you any exoneration from life or from any chances or dangers whatever. I wish I could; depend upon it I would! For what do you take me, pray? Heaven help me, I'm not the Emperor of China! All I offer you is the chance of taking the common lot in a comfortable sort of way. The common lot? Why, I'm devoted to the common lot! Strike an alliance with me, and I promise you that you shall have plenty of it. You shall separate from nothing whatever—not even from your friend Miss Stackpole.""




""She'd never approve of it,"" said Isabel, trying to smile and take advantage of this side-issue; despising herself too, not a little, for doing so.




""Are we speaking of Miss Stackpole?"" his lordship asked impatiently. ""I never saw a person judge things on such theoretic grounds.""




""Now I suppose you're speaking of me,"" said Isabel with humility; and she turned away again, for she saw Miss Molyneux enter the gallery, accompanied by Henrietta and by Ralph.




Lord Warburton's sister addressed him with a certain timidity and reminded him she ought to return home in time for tea, as she was expecting company to partake of it. He made no answer—apparently not having heard her; he was preoccupied, and with good reason. Miss Molyneux—as if he had been Royalty—stood like a lady-in-waiting.




""Well, I never, Miss Molyneux!"" said Henrietta Stackpole. ""If I wanted to go he'd have to go. If I wanted my brother to do a thing he'd have to do it.""




""Oh, Warburton does everything one wants,"" Miss Molyneux answered with a quick, shy laugh. ""How very many pictures you have!"" she went on, turning to Ralph.




""They look a good many, because they're all put together,"" said Ralph. ""But it's really a bad way.""




""Oh, I think it's so nice. I wish we had a gallery at Lockleigh. I'm so very fond of pictures,"" Miss Molyneux went on, persistently, to Ralph, as if she were afraid Miss Stackpole would address her again. Henrietta appeared at once to fascinate sand to frighten her.




""Ah yes, pictures are very convenient,"" said Ralph, who appeared to know better what style of reflexion was acceptable to her.




""They're so very pleasant when it rains,"" the young lady continued. ""It has rained of late so very often.""




""I'm sorry you're going away, Lord Warburton,"" said Henrietta. ""I wanted to get a great deal more out of you.""




""I'm not going away,"" Lord Warburton answered.




""Your sister says you must. In America the gentlemen obey the ladies.""




""I'm afraid we have some people to tea,"" said Miss Molyneux, looking at her brother.




""Very good, my dear. We'll go.""




""I hoped you would resist!"" Henrietta exclaimed. ""I wanted to see what Miss Molyneux would do.""




""I never do anything,"" said this young lady.




""I suppose in your position it's sufficient for you to exist!"" Miss Stackpole returned. ""I should like very much to see you at home.""




""You must come to Lockleigh again,"" said Miss Molyneux, very sweetly, to Isabel, ignoring this remark of Isabel's friend. Isabel looked into her quiet eyes a moment, and for that moment seemed to see in their grey depths the reflexion of everything she had rejected in rejecting Lord Warburton—the peace, the kindness, the honour, the possessions, a deep security and a great exclusion. She kissed Miss Molyneux and then she said: ""I'm afraid I can never come again.""




""Never again?""




""I'm afraid I'm going away.""




""Oh, I'm so very sorry,"" said Miss Molyneux. ""I think that's so very wrong of you.""




Lord Warburton watched this tittle passage; then he turned away and stared at a picture. Ralph, leaning against the rail before the picture with his hands in his pockets, had for the moment been watching him.




""I should like to see you at home,"" said Henrietta, whom Lord Warburton found beside him. ""I should like an hour's talk with you; there are a great many questions I wish to ask you.""




""I shall be delighted to see you,"" the proprietor of Lockleigh answered; ""but I'm certain not to be able to answer many of your questions. When will you come?""




""Whenever Miss Archer will take me. We're thinking of going to London, but we'll go and see you first. I'm determined to get some satisfaction out of you.""




""If it depends upon Miss Archer I'm afraid you won't get much. She won't come to Lockleigh; she doesn't like the place.""




""She told me it was lovely!"" said Henrietta.




Lord Warburton hesitated. ""She won't come, all the same. You had better come alone,"" he added.




Henrietta straightened herself, and her large eyes expanded. ""Would you make that remark to an English lady?"" she enquired with soft asperity.




Lord Warburton stared. ""Yes, if I liked her enough.""




""You'd be careful not to like her enough. If Miss Archer won't visit your place again it's because she doesn't want to take me. I know what she thinks of me, and I suppose you think the same—that I oughtn't to bring in individuals."" Lord Warburton was at a loss; he had not been made acquainted with Miss Stackpole's professional character and failed to catch her allusion. ""Miss Archer has been warning you!"" she therefore went on.




""Warning me?""




""Isn't that why she came off alone with you here—to put you on your guard?""




""Oh dear, no,"" said Lord Warburton brazenly; ""our talk had no such solemn character as that.""




""Well, you've been on your guard—intensely. I suppose it's natural to you; that's just what I wanted to observe. And so, too, Miss Molyneux—she wouldn't commit herself. You have been warned, anyway,"" Henrietta continued, addressing this young lady; ""but for you it wasn't necessary.""




""I hope not,"" said Miss Molyneux vaguely.




""Miss Stackpole takes notes,"" Ralph soothingly explained. ""She's a great satirist; she sees through us all and she works us up.""




""Well, I must say I never have had such a collection of bad material!"" Henrietta declared, looking from Isabel to Lord Warburton and from this nobleman to his sister and to Ralph. ""There's something the matter with you all; you're as dismal as if you had got a bad cable.""




""You do see through us, Miss Stackpole,"" said Ralph in a low tone, giving her a little intelligent nod as he led the party out of the gallery. ""There's something the matter with us all.""




Isabel came behind these two; Miss Molyneux, who de cidedly liked her immensely, had taken her arm, to walk beside her over the polished floor. Lord Warburton strolled on the other side with his hands behind him and his eyes lowered. For some moments he said nothing; and then, ""Is it true you're going to London?"" he asked.




""I believe it has been arranged.""




""And when shall you come back?""




""In a few days; but probably for a very short time. I'm going to Paris with my aunt.""




""When, then, shall I see you again?""




""Not for a good while,"" said Isabel. ""But some day or other, I hope.""




""Do you really hope it?""




""Very much.""




He went a few steps in silence; then he stopped and put out his hand. ""Good-bye.""




""Good-bye,"" said Isabel.




Miss Molyneux kissed her again, and she let the two depart. After it, without rejoining Henrietta and Ralph, she retreated to her own room; in which apartment, before dinner, she was found by Mrs. Touchett, who had stopped on her way to the saloon. ""I may as well tell you,"" said that lady, ""that your uncle has informed me of your relations with Lord Warburton.""




Isabel considered. ""Relations? They're hardly relations. That's the strange part of it: he has seen me but three or four times.""




""Why did you tell your uncle rather than me?"" Mrs. Touchett dispassionately asked.




Again the girl hesitated. ""Because he knows Lord Warburton better.""




""Yes, but I know you better.""




""I'm not sure of that,"" said Isabel, smiling.




""Neither am I, after all; especially when you give me that rather conceited look. One would think you were awfully pleased with yourself and had carried off a prize! I suppose that when you refuse an offer like Lord Warburton's it's because you expect to do something better.""




""Ah, my uncle didn't say that!"" cried Isabel, smiling still."|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"
"ap 06:00"|"six o'clock"|"It had been arranged that the two young ladies should proceed to London under Ralph's escort, though Mrs. Touchett looked with little favour on the plan. It was just the sort of plan, she said, that Miss Stackpole would be sure to suggest, and she enquired if the correspondent of the Interviewer was to take the party to stay at her favourite boarding-house.




""I don't care where she takes us to stay, so long as there's local colour,"" said Isabel. ""That's what we're going to London for.""




""I suppose that after a girl has refused an English lord she may do anything,"" her aunt rejoined. ""After that one needn't stand on trifles.""




""Should you have liked me to marry Lord Warburton?"" Isabel enquired.




""Of course I should.""




""I thought you disliked the English so much.""




""So I do; but it's all the greater reason for making use of them.""




""Is that your idea of marriage?"" And Isabel ventured to add that her aunt appeared to her to have made very little use of Mr. Touchett.




""Your uncle's not an English nobleman,"" said Mrs. Touchett, ""though even if he had been I should still probably have taken up my residence in Florence.""




""Do you think Lord Warburton could make me any better than I am?"" the girl asked with some animation. ""I don't mean I'm too good to improve. I mean that I don't love Lord Warburton enough to marry him.""




""You did right to refuse him then,"" said Mrs. Touchett in her smallest, sparest voice. ""Only, the next great offer you get, I hope you'll manage to come up to your standard.""




""We had better wait till the offer comes before we talk about it. I hope very much I may have no more offers for the present. They upset me completely.""




""You probably won't be troubled with them if you adopt permanently the Bohemian manner of life. However, I've promised Ralph not to criticise.""




""I'll do whatever Ralph says is right,"" Isabel returned. ""I've unbounded confidence in Ralph.""




""His mother's much obliged to you!"" this lady dryly laughed.




""It seems to me indeed she ought to feel it!"" Isabel irrepressibly answered.




Ralph had assured her that there would be no violation of decency in their paying a visit—the little party of three—to the sights of the metropolis; but Mrs. Touchett took a different view. Like many ladies of her country who had lived a long time in Europe, she had completely lost her native tact on such points, and in her reaction, not in itself deplorable, against the liberty allowed to young persons beyond the seas, had fallen into gratuitous and exaggerated scruples. Ralph accompanied their visitors to town and established them at a quiet inn in a street that ran at right angles to Piccadilly. His first idea had been to take them to his father's house in Winchester Square, a large, dull mansion which at this period of the year was shrouded in silence and brown holland; but he bethought himself that, the cook being at Gardencourt, there was no one in the house to get them their meals, and Pratt's Hotel accordingly became their resting-place. Ralph, on his side, found quarters in Winchester Square, having a ""den"" there of which he was very fond and being familiar with deeper fears than that of a cold kitchen. He availed himself largely indeed of the resources of Pratt's Hotel, beginning his day with an early visit to his fellow travellers, who had Mr. Pratt in person, in a large bulging white waistcoat, to remove their dish-covers. Ralph turned up, as he said, after breakfast, and the little party made out a scheme of entertainment for the day. As London wears in the month of September a face blank but for its smears of prior service, the young man, who occasionally took an apologetic tone, was obliged to remind his companion, to Miss Stackpole's high derision, that there wasn't a creature in town.




""I suppose you mean the aristocracy are absent,"" Henrietta answered; ""but I don't think you could have a better proof that if they were absent altogether they wouldn't be missed. It seems to me the place is about as full as it can be. There's no one here, of course, but three or four millions of people. What is it you call them—the lower-middle class? They're only the population of London, and that's of no consequence.""




Ralph declared that for him the aristocracy left no void that Miss Stackpole herself didn't fill, and that a more contented man was nowhere at that moment to be found. In this he spoke the truth, for the stale September days, in the huge half-empty town, had a charm wrapped in them as a coloured gem might be wrapped in a dusty cloth. When he went home at night to the empty house in Winchester Square, after a chain of hours with his comparatively ardent friends, he wandered into the big dusky dining-room, where the candle he took from the hall-table, after letting himself in, constituted the only illumination. The square was still, the house was still; when he raised one of the windows of the dining-room to let in the air he heard the slow creak of the boots of a lone constable. His own step, in the empty place, seemed loud and sonorous; some of the carpets had been raised, and whenever he moved he roused a melancholy echo. He sat down in one of the armchairs; the big dark dining table twinkled here and there in the small candle-light; the pictures on the wall, all of them very brown, looked vague and incoherent. There was a ghostly presence as of dinners long since digested, of table-talk that had lost its actuality. This hint of the supernatural perhaps had something to do with the fact that his imagination took a flight and that he remained in his chair a long time beyond the hour at which he should have been in bed; doing nothing, not even reading the evening paper. I say he did nothing, and I maintain the phrase in the face of the fact that he thought at these moments of Isabel. To think of Isabel could only be for him an idle pursuit, leading to nothing and profiting little to any one. His cousin had not yet seemed to him so charming as during these days spent in sounding, tourist-fashion, the deeps and shallows of the metropolitan element. Isabel was full of premises, conclusions, emotions; if she had come in search of local colour she found it everywhere. She asked more questions than he could answer, and launched brave theories, as to historic cause and social effect, that he was equally unable to accept or to refute. The party went more than once to the British Museum and to that brighter palace of art which reclaims for antique variety so large an area of a monotonous suburb; they spent a morning in the Abbey and went on a penny-steamer to the Tower; they looked at pictures both in public and private collections and sat on various occasions beneath the great trees in Kensington Gardens. Henrietta proved an indestructible sight-seer and a more lenient judge than Ralph had ventured to hope. She had indeed many disappointments, and London at large suffered from her vivid remembrance of the strong points of the American civic idea; but she made the best of its dingy dignities and only heaved an occasional sigh and uttered a desultory ""Well!"" which led no further and lost itself in retrospect. The truth was that, as she said herself, she was not in her element. ""I've not a sympathy with inanimate objects,"" she remarked to Isabel at the National Gallery; and she continued to suffer from the meagreness of the glimpse that had as yet been vouchsafed to her of the inner life. Landscapes by Turner and Assyrian bulls were a poor substitute for the literary dinner-parties at which she had hoped to meet the genius and renown of Great Britain.




""Where are your public men, where are your men and women of intellect?"" she enquired of Ralph, standing in the middle of Trafalgar Square as if she had supposed this to be a place where she would naturally meet a few. ""That's one of them on the top of the column, you say—Lord Nelson. Was he a lord too? Wasn't he high enough, that they had to stick him a hundred feet in the air? That's the past—I don't care about the past; I want to see some of the leading minds of the present. I won't say of the future, because I don't believe much in your future."" Poor Ralph had few leading minds among his acquaintance and rarely enjoyed the pleasure of buttonholing a celebrity; a state of things which appeared to Miss Stackpole to indicate a deplorable want of enterprise. ""If I were on the other side I should call,"" she said, ""and tell the gentleman, whoever he might be, that I had heard a great deal about him and had come to see for myself. But I gather from what you say that this is not the custom here. You seem to have plenty of meaningless customs, but none of those that would help along. We are in advance, certainly. I suppose I shall have to give up the social side altogether;"" and Henrietta, though she went about with her guidebook and pencil and wrote a letter to the Interviewer about the Tower (in which she described the execution of Lady Jane Grey), had a sad sense of falling below her mission.




The incident that had preceded Isabel's departure from Gardencourt left a painful trace in our young woman's mind: when she felt again in her face, as from a recurrent wave, the cold breath of her last suitor's surprise, she could only muffle her head till the air cleared. She could not have done less than what she did; this was certainly true. But her necessity, all the same, had been as graceless as some physical act in a strained attitude, and she felt no desire to take credit for her conduct. Mixed with this imperfect pride, nevertheless, was a feeling of freedom which in itself was sweet and which, as she wandered through the great city with her ill-matched companions, occasionally throbbed into odd demonstrations. When she walked in Kensington Gardens she stopped the children (mainly of the poorer sort) whom she saw playing on the grass; she asked them their names and gave them sixpence and, when they were pretty, kissed them. Ralph noticed these quaint charities; he noticed everything she did. One afternoon, that his companions might pass the time, he invited them to tea in Winchester Square, and he had the house set in order as much as possible for their visit. There was another guest to meet them, an amiable bachelor, an old friend of Ralph's who happened to be in town and for whom prompt commerce with Miss Stackpole appeared to have neither difficulty nor dread. Mr. Bantling, a stout, sleek, smiling man of forty, wonderfully dressed, universally informed and incoherently amused, laughed immoderately at everything Henrietta said, gave her several cups of tea, examined in her society the bric-a-brac, of which Ralph had a considerable collection, and afterwards, when the host proposed they should go out into the square and pretend it was a fete-champetre, walked round the limited enclosure several times with her and, at a dozen turns of their talk, bounded responsive—as with a positive passion for argument—to her remarks upon the inner life.




""Oh, I see; I dare say you found it very quiet at Gardencourt. Naturally there's not much going on there when there's such a lot of illness about. Touchett's very bad, you know; the doctors have forbidden his being in England at all, and he has only come back to take care of his father. The old man, I believe, has half a dozen things the matter with him. They call it gout, but to my certain knowledge he has organic disease so developed that you may depend upon it he'll go, some day soon, quite quickly. Of course that sort of thing makes a dreadfully dull house; I wonder they have people when they can do so little for them. Then I believe Mr. Touchett's always squabbling with his wife; she lives away from her husband, you know, in that extraordinary American way of yours. If you want a house where there's always something going on, I recommend you to go down and stay with my sister, Lady Pensil, in Bedfordshire. I'll write to her to-morrow and I'm sure she'll be delighted to ask you. I know just what you want—you want a house where they go in for theatricals and picnics and that sort of thing. My sister's just that sort of woman; she's always getting up something or other and she's always glad to have the sort of people who help her. I'm sure she'll ask you down by return of post: she's tremendously fond of distinguished people and writers. She writes herself, you know; but I haven't read everything she has written. It's usually poetry, and I don't go in much for poetry—unless it's Byron. I suppose you think a great deal of Byron in America,"" Mr. Bantling continued, expanding in the stimulating air of Miss Stackpole's attention, bringing up his sequences promptly and changing his topic with an easy turn of hand. Yet he none the less gracefully kept in sight of the idea, dazzling to Henrietta, of her going to stay with Lady Pensil in Bedfordshire. ""I understand what you want; you want to see some genuine English sport. The Touchetts aren't English at all, you know; they have their own habits, their own language, their own food—some odd religion even, I believe, of their own. The old man thinks it's wicked to hunt, I'm told. You must get down to my sister's in time for the theatricals, and I'm sure she'll be glad to give you a part. I'm sure you act well; I know you're very clever. My sister's forty years old and has seven children, but she's going to play the principal part. Plain as she is she makes up awfully well—I will say for her. Of course you needn't act if you don't want to.""




In this manner Mr. Bantling delivered himself while they strolled over the grass in Winchester Square, which, although it had been peppered by the London soot, invited the tread to linger. Henrietta thought her blooming, easy-voiced bachelor, with his impressibility to feminine merit and his splendid range of suggestion, a very agreeable man, and she valued the opportunity he offered her. ""I don't know but I would go, if your sister should ask me. I think it would be my duty. What do you call her name?""




""Pensil. It's an odd name, but it isn't a bad one.""




""I think one name's as good as another. But what's her rank?"".




""Oh, she's a baron's wife; a convenient sort of rank. You're fine enough and you're not too fine.""




""I don't know but what she'd be too fine for me. What do you call the place she lives in—Bedfordshire?""




""She lives away in the northern corner of it. It's a tiresome country, but I dare say you won't mind it. I'll try and run down while you're there.""




All this was very pleasant to Miss Stackpole, and she was sorry to be obliged to separate from Lady Pensil's obliging brother. But it happened that she had met the day before, in Piccadilly, some friends whom she had not seen for a year: the Miss Climbers, two ladies from Wilmington, Delaware, who had been travelling on the Continent and were now preparing to re-embark. Henrietta had had a long interview with them on the Piccadilly pavement, and though the three ladies all talked at once they had not exhausted their store. It had been agreed therefore that Henrietta should come and dine with them in their lodgings in Jermyn Street at six o'clock on the morrow, and she now bethought herself of this engagement. She prepared to start for Jermyn Street, taking leave first of Ralph Touchett and Isabel, who, seated on garden chairs in another part of the enclosure, were occupied—if the term may be used—with an exchange of amenities less pointed than the practical colloquy of Miss Stackpole and Mr. Bantling. When it had been settled between Isabel and her friend that they should be reunited at some reputable hour at Pratt's Hotel, Ralph remarked that the latter must have a cab. She couldn't walk all the way to Jermyn Street.




""I suppose you mean it's improper for me to walk alone!"" Henrietta exclaimed. ""Merciful powers, have I come to this?""




""There's not the slightest need of your walking alone,"" Mr. Bantling gaily interposed. ""I should be greatly pleased to go with you.""




""I simply meant that you'd be late for dinner,"" Ralph returned. ""Those poor ladies may easily believe that we refuse, at the last, to spare you.""




""You had better have a hansom, Henrietta,"" said Isabel.




""I'll get you a hansom if you'll trust me,"" Mr. Bantling went on.




""We might walk a little till we meet one.""




""I don't see why I shouldn't trust him, do you?"" Henrietta enquired of Isabel.




""I don't see what Mr. Bantling could do to you,"" Isabel obligingly answered; ""but, if you like, we'll walk with you till you find your cab.""




""Never mind; we'll go alone. Come on, Mr. Bantling, and take care you get me a good one.""




Mr. Bantling promised to do his best, and the two took their departure, leaving the girl and her cousin together in the square, over which a clear September twilight had now begun to gather. It was perfectly still; the wide quadrangle of dusky houses showed lights in none of the windows, where the shutters and blinds were closed; the pavements were a vacant expanse, and, putting aside two small children from a neighbouring slum, who, attracted by symptoms of abnormal animation in the interior, poked their faces between the rusty rails of the enclosure, the most vivid object within sight was the big red pillar-post on the southeast corner.




""Henrietta will ask him to get into the cab and go with her to Jermyn Street,"" Ralph observed. He always spoke of Miss Stackpole as Henrietta.




""Very possibly,"" said his companion.




""Or rather, no, she won't,"" he went on. ""But Bantling will ask leave to get in.""




""Very likely again. I'm glad very they're such good friends.""




""She has made a conquest. He thinks her a brilliant woman. It may go far,"" said Ralph.




Isabel was briefly silent. ""I call Henrietta a very brilliant woman, but I don't think it will go far. They would never really know each other. He has not the least idea what she really is, and she has no just comprehension of Mr. Bantling.""




""There's no more usual basis of union than a mutual misunderstanding. But it ought not to be so difficult to understand Bob Bantling,"" Ralph added. ""He is a very simple organism.""




""Yes, but Henrietta's a simpler one still. And, pray, what am I to do?"" Isabel asked, looking about her through the fading light, in which the limited landscape-gardening of the square took on a large and effective appearance. ""I don't imagine that you'll propose that you and I, for our amusement, shall drive about London in a hansom.""




""There's no reason we shouldn't stay here—if you don't dislike it. It's very warm; there will he half an hour yet before dark; and if you permit it I'll light a cigarette.""




""You may do what you please,"" said Isabel, ""if you'll amuse me till seven o'clock. I propose at that hour to go back and partake of a simple and solitary repast—two poached eggs and a muffin—at Pratt's Hotel.""




""Mayn't I dine with you?"" Ralph asked.




""No, you'll dine at your club.""




They had wandered back to their chairs in the centre of the square again, and Ralph had lighted his cigarette. It would have given him extreme pleasure to be present in person at the modest little feast she had sketched; but in default of this he liked even being forbidden. For the moment, however, he liked immensely being alone with her, in the thickening dusk, in the centre of the multitudinous town; it made her seem to depend upon him and to be in his power. This power he could exert but vaguely; the best exercise of it was to accept her decisions submissively which indeed there was already an emotion in doing. ""Why won't you let me dine with you?"" he demanded after a pause.




""Because I don't care for it.""




""I suppose you're tired of me.""




""I shall be an hour hence. You see I have the gift of foreknowledge.""




""Oh, I shall be delightful meanwhile,"" said Ralph.




But he said nothing more, and as she made no rejoinder they sat some time in a stillness which seemed to contradict his promise of entertainment. It seemed to him she was preoccupied, and he wondered what she was thinking about; there were two or three very possible subjects. At last he spoke again. ""Is your objection to my society this evening caused by your expectation of another visitor?""




She turned her head with a glance of her clear, fair eyes. ""Another visitor? What visitor should I have?""




He had none to suggest; which made his question seem to himself silly as well as brutal. ""You've a great many friends that I don't know. You've a whole past from which I was perversely excluded.""




""You were reserved for my future. You must remember that my past is over there across the water. There's none of it here in London.""




""Very good, then, since your future is seated beside you. Capital thing to have your future so handy."" And Ralph lighted another cigarette and reflected that Isabel probably meant she had received news that Mr. Caspar Goodwood had crossed to Paris. After he had lighted his cigarette he puffed it a while, and then he resumed. ""I promised just now to be very amusing; but you see I don't come up to the mark, and the fact is there's a good deal of temerity in one's undertaking to amuse a person like you. What do you care for my feeble attempts? You've grand ideas—you've a high standard in such matters. I ought at least to bring in a band of music or a company of mountebanks.""




""One mountebank's enough, and you do very well. Pray go on, and in another ten minutes I shall begin to laugh.""




""I assure you I'm very serious,"" said Ralph. ""You do really ask a great deal.""




""I don't know what you mean. I ask nothing.""




""You accept nothing,"" said Ralph. She coloured, and now suddenly it seemed to her that she guessed his meaning. But why should he speak to her of such things? He hesitated a little and then he continued: ""There's something I should like very much to say to you. It's a ques tion I wish to ask. It seems to me I've a right to ask it, because I've a kind of interest in the answer.""




""Ask what you will,"" Isabel replied gently, ""and I'll try to satisfy you.""




""Well then, I hope you won't mind my saying that Warburton has told me of something that has passed between you.""




Isabel suppressed a start; she sat looking at her open fan. ""Very good; I suppose it was natural he should tell you.""




""I have his leave to let you know he has done so. He has some hope still,"" said Ralph.




""Still?""




""He had it a few days ago.""




""I don't believe he has any now,"" said the girl.




""I'm very sorry for him then; he's such an honest man.""




""Pray, did he ask you to talk to me?""




""No, not that. But he told me because he couldn't help it. We're old friends, and he was greatly disappointed. He sent me a line asking me to come and see him, and I drove over to Lockleigh the day before he and his sister lunched with us. He was very heavy-hearted; he had just got a letter from you.""




""Did he show you the letter?"" asked Isabel with momentary loftiness.




""By no means. But he told me it was a neat refusal. I was very sorry for him,"" Ralph repeated.




For some moments Isabel said nothing; then at last, ""Do you know how often he had seen me?"" she enquired. ""Five or six times.""




""That's to your glory.""




""It's not for that I say it.""




""What then do you say it for. Not to prove that poor Warburton's state of mind's superficial, because I'm pretty sure you don't think that.""




Isabel certainly was unable to say she thought it; but presently she said something else. ""If you've not been requested by Lord Warburton to argue with me, then you're doing it disinterestedly —or for the love of argument.""




""I've no wish to argue with you at all. I only wish to leave you alone. I'm simply greatly interested in your own sentiments.""




""I'm greatly obliged to you!"" cried Isabel with a slightly nervous laugh.




""Of course you mean that I'm meddling in what doesn't concern me. But why shouldn't I speak to you of this matter without annoying you or embarrassing myself? What's the use of being your cousin if I can't have a few privileges? What's the use of adoring you without hope of a reward if I can't have a few compensations? What's the use of being ill and disabled and restricted to mere spectatorship at the game of life if I really can't see the show when I've paid so much for my ticket? Tell me this,"" Ralph went on while she listened to him with quickened attention. ""What had you in mind when you refused Lord Warburton?""




""What had I in mind?""




""What was the logic—the view of your situation—that dictated so remarkable an act?""




""I didn't wish to marry him—if that's logic.""




""No, that's not logic—and I knew that before. It's really nothing, you know. What was it you said to yourself? You certainly said more than that.""




Isabel reflected a moment, then answered with a question of her own. ""Why do you call it a remarkable act? That's what your mother thinks too.""




""Warburton's such a thorough good sort; as a man, I consider he has hardly a fault. And then he's what they call here no end of a swell. He has immense possessions, and his wife would be thought a superior being. He unites the intrinsic and the extrinsic advantages.""




Isabel watched her cousin as to see how far he would go. ""I refused him because he was too perfect then. I'm not perfect myself, and he's too good for me. Besides, his perfection would irritate me.""




""That's ingenious rather than candid,"" said Ralph. ""As a fact you think nothing in the world too perfect for you.""




""Do you think I'm so good?""




""No, but you're exacting, all the same, without the excuse of thinking yourself good. Nineteen women out of twenty, however, even of the most exacting sort, would have managed to do with Warburton. Perhaps you don't know how he has been stalked.""




""I don't wish to know. But it seems to me,"" said Isabel, ""that one day when we talked of him you mentioned odd things in him."" Ralph smokingly considered. ""I hope that what I said then had no weight with you; for they were not faults, the things I spoke of: they were simply peculiarities of his position. If I had known he wished to marry you I'd never have alluded to them. I think I said that as regards that position he was rather a sceptic. It would have been in your power to make him a believer.""




""I think not. I don't understand the matter, and I'm not conscious of any mission of that sort. You're evidently disappointed,"" Isabel added, looking at her cousin with rueful gentleness. ""You'd have liked me to make such a marriage.""




""Not in the least. I'm absolutely without a wish on the subject. I don't pretend to advise you, and I content myself with watching you—with the deepest interest.""




She gave rather a conscious sigh. ""I wish I could be as interesting to myself as I am to you!""




""There you're not candid again; you're extremely interesting to yourself. Do you know, however,"" said Ralph, ""that if you've really given Warburton his final answer I'm rather glad it has been what it was. I don't mean I'm glad for you, and still less of course for him. I'm glad for myself.""




""Are you thinking of proposing to me?""




""By no means. From the point of view I speak of that would be fatal; I should kill the goose that supplies me with the material of my inimitable omelettes. I use that animal as the symbol of my insane illusions. What I mean is that I shall have the thrill of seeing what a young lady does who won't marry Lord Warburton.""




""That's what your mother counts upon too,"" said Isabel.




""Ah, there will be plenty of spectators! We shall hang on the rest of your career. I shall not see all of it, but I shall probably see the most interesting years. Of course if you were to marry our friend you'd still have a career—a very decent, in fact a very brilliant one. But relatively speaking it would be a little prosaic. It would be definitely marked out in advance; it would be wanting in the unexpected. You know I'm extremely fond of the unexpected, and now that you've kept the game in your hands I depend on your giving us some grand example of it.""




""I don't understand you very well,"" said Isabel, ""but I do so well enough to be able to say that if you look for grand examples of anything from me I shall disappoint you.""




""You'll do so only by disappointing yourself and that will go hard with you!""




To this she made no direct reply; there was an amount of truth in it that would bear consideration. At last she said abruptly: ""I don't see what harm there is in my wishing not to tie myself. I don't want to begin life by marrying. There are other things a woman can do.""




""There's nothing she can do so well. But you're of course so many-sided.""




""If one's two-sided it's enough,"" said Isabel.




""You're the most charming of polygons!"" her companion broke out. At a glance from his companion, however, he became grave, and to prove it went on: ""You want to see life—you'll be hanged if you don't, as the young men say.""




""I don't think I want to see it as the young men want to see it. But I do want to look about me.""




""You want to drain the cup of experience.""




""No, I don't wish to touch the cup of experience. It's a poisoned drink! I only want to see for myself.""




""You want to see, but not to feel,"" Ralph remarked.




""I don't think that if one's a sentient being one can make the distinction. I'm a good deal like Henrietta. The other day when I asked her if she wished to marry she said: 'Not till I've seen Europe!' I too don't wish to marry till I've seen Europe.""




""You evidently expect a crowned head will be struck with you.""




""No, that would be worse than marrying Lord Warburton. But it's getting very dark,"" Isabel continued, ""and I must go home."" She rose from her place, but Ralph only sat still and looked at her. As he remained there she stopped, and they exchanged a gaze that was full on either side, but especially on Ralph's, of utterances too vague for words.




""You've answered my question,"" he said at last. ""You've told me what I wanted. I'm greatly obliged to you.""




""It seems to me I've told you very little.""




""You've told me the great thing: that the world interests you and that you want to throw yourself into it.""




Her silvery eyes shone a moment in the dusk. ""I never said that."" ""I think you meant it. Don't repudiate it. It's so fine!""




""I don't know what you're trying to fasten upon me, for I'm not in the least an adventurous spirit. Women are not like men.""




Ralph slowly rose from his seat and they walked together to the gate of the square. ""No,"" he said; ""women rarely boast of their courage. Men do so with a certain frequency.""




""Men have it to boast of!""




""Women have it too. You've a great deal.""




""Enough to go home in a cab to Pratt's Hotel, but not more.""




Ralph unlocked the gate, and after they had passed out he fastened it. ""We'll find your cab,"" he said; and as they turned toward a neighbouring street in which this quest might avail he asked her again if he mightn't see her safely to the inn.




""By no means,"" she answered; ""you're very tired; you must go home and go to bed.""




The cab was found, and he helped her into it, standing a moment at the door. ""When people forget I'm a poor creature I'm often incommoded,"" he said. ""But it's worse when they remember it!"""|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o'clock"|"It had been arranged that the two young ladies should proceed to London under Ralph's escort, though Mrs. Touchett looked with little favour on the plan. It was just the sort of plan, she said, that Miss Stackpole would be sure to suggest, and she enquired if the correspondent of the Interviewer was to take the party to stay at her favourite boarding-house.




""I don't care where she takes us to stay, so long as there's local colour,"" said Isabel. ""That's what we're going to London for.""




""I suppose that after a girl has refused an English lord she may do anything,"" her aunt rejoined. ""After that one needn't stand on trifles.""




""Should you have liked me to marry Lord Warburton?"" Isabel enquired.




""Of course I should.""




""I thought you disliked the English so much.""




""So I do; but it's all the greater reason for making use of them.""




""Is that your idea of marriage?"" And Isabel ventured to add that her aunt appeared to her to have made very little use of Mr. Touchett.




""Your uncle's not an English nobleman,"" said Mrs. Touchett, ""though even if he had been I should still probably have taken up my residence in Florence.""




""Do you think Lord Warburton could make me any better than I am?"" the girl asked with some animation. ""I don't mean I'm too good to improve. I mean that I don't love Lord Warburton enough to marry him.""




""You did right to refuse him then,"" said Mrs. Touchett in her smallest, sparest voice. ""Only, the next great offer you get, I hope you'll manage to come up to your standard.""




""We had better wait till the offer comes before we talk about it. I hope very much I may have no more offers for the present. They upset me completely.""




""You probably won't be troubled with them if you adopt permanently the Bohemian manner of life. However, I've promised Ralph not to criticise.""




""I'll do whatever Ralph says is right,"" Isabel returned. ""I've unbounded confidence in Ralph.""




""His mother's much obliged to you!"" this lady dryly laughed.




""It seems to me indeed she ought to feel it!"" Isabel irrepressibly answered.




Ralph had assured her that there would be no violation of decency in their paying a visit—the little party of three—to the sights of the metropolis; but Mrs. Touchett took a different view. Like many ladies of her country who had lived a long time in Europe, she had completely lost her native tact on such points, and in her reaction, not in itself deplorable, against the liberty allowed to young persons beyond the seas, had fallen into gratuitous and exaggerated scruples. Ralph accompanied their visitors to town and established them at a quiet inn in a street that ran at right angles to Piccadilly. His first idea had been to take them to his father's house in Winchester Square, a large, dull mansion which at this period of the year was shrouded in silence and brown holland; but he bethought himself that, the cook being at Gardencourt, there was no one in the house to get them their meals, and Pratt's Hotel accordingly became their resting-place. Ralph, on his side, found quarters in Winchester Square, having a ""den"" there of which he was very fond and being familiar with deeper fears than that of a cold kitchen. He availed himself largely indeed of the resources of Pratt's Hotel, beginning his day with an early visit to his fellow travellers, who had Mr. Pratt in person, in a large bulging white waistcoat, to remove their dish-covers. Ralph turned up, as he said, after breakfast, and the little party made out a scheme of entertainment for the day. As London wears in the month of September a face blank but for its smears of prior service, the young man, who occasionally took an apologetic tone, was obliged to remind his companion, to Miss Stackpole's high derision, that there wasn't a creature in town.




""I suppose you mean the aristocracy are absent,"" Henrietta answered; ""but I don't think you could have a better proof that if they were absent altogether they wouldn't be missed. It seems to me the place is about as full as it can be. There's no one here, of course, but three or four millions of people. What is it you call them—the lower-middle class? They're only the population of London, and that's of no consequence.""




Ralph declared that for him the aristocracy left no void that Miss Stackpole herself didn't fill, and that a more contented man was nowhere at that moment to be found. In this he spoke the truth, for the stale September days, in the huge half-empty town, had a charm wrapped in them as a coloured gem might be wrapped in a dusty cloth. When he went home at night to the empty house in Winchester Square, after a chain of hours with his comparatively ardent friends, he wandered into the big dusky dining-room, where the candle he took from the hall-table, after letting himself in, constituted the only illumination. The square was still, the house was still; when he raised one of the windows of the dining-room to let in the air he heard the slow creak of the boots of a lone constable. His own step, in the empty place, seemed loud and sonorous; some of the carpets had been raised, and whenever he moved he roused a melancholy echo. He sat down in one of the armchairs; the big dark dining table twinkled here and there in the small candle-light; the pictures on the wall, all of them very brown, looked vague and incoherent. There was a ghostly presence as of dinners long since digested, of table-talk that had lost its actuality. This hint of the supernatural perhaps had something to do with the fact that his imagination took a flight and that he remained in his chair a long time beyond the hour at which he should have been in bed; doing nothing, not even reading the evening paper. I say he did nothing, and I maintain the phrase in the face of the fact that he thought at these moments of Isabel. To think of Isabel could only be for him an idle pursuit, leading to nothing and profiting little to any one. His cousin had not yet seemed to him so charming as during these days spent in sounding, tourist-fashion, the deeps and shallows of the metropolitan element. Isabel was full of premises, conclusions, emotions; if she had come in search of local colour she found it everywhere. She asked more questions than he could answer, and launched brave theories, as to historic cause and social effect, that he was equally unable to accept or to refute. The party went more than once to the British Museum and to that brighter palace of art which reclaims for antique variety so large an area of a monotonous suburb; they spent a morning in the Abbey and went on a penny-steamer to the Tower; they looked at pictures both in public and private collections and sat on various occasions beneath the great trees in Kensington Gardens. Henrietta proved an indestructible sight-seer and a more lenient judge than Ralph had ventured to hope. She had indeed many disappointments, and London at large suffered from her vivid remembrance of the strong points of the American civic idea; but she made the best of its dingy dignities and only heaved an occasional sigh and uttered a desultory ""Well!"" which led no further and lost itself in retrospect. The truth was that, as she said herself, she was not in her element. ""I've not a sympathy with inanimate objects,"" she remarked to Isabel at the National Gallery; and she continued to suffer from the meagreness of the glimpse that had as yet been vouchsafed to her of the inner life. Landscapes by Turner and Assyrian bulls were a poor substitute for the literary dinner-parties at which she had hoped to meet the genius and renown of Great Britain.




""Where are your public men, where are your men and women of intellect?"" she enquired of Ralph, standing in the middle of Trafalgar Square as if she had supposed this to be a place where she would naturally meet a few. ""That's one of them on the top of the column, you say—Lord Nelson. Was he a lord too? Wasn't he high enough, that they had to stick him a hundred feet in the air? That's the past—I don't care about the past; I want to see some of the leading minds of the present. I won't say of the future, because I don't believe much in your future."" Poor Ralph had few leading minds among his acquaintance and rarely enjoyed the pleasure of buttonholing a celebrity; a state of things which appeared to Miss Stackpole to indicate a deplorable want of enterprise. ""If I were on the other side I should call,"" she said, ""and tell the gentleman, whoever he might be, that I had heard a great deal about him and had come to see for myself. But I gather from what you say that this is not the custom here. You seem to have plenty of meaningless customs, but none of those that would help along. We are in advance, certainly. I suppose I shall have to give up the social side altogether;"" and Henrietta, though she went about with her guidebook and pencil and wrote a letter to the Interviewer about the Tower (in which she described the execution of Lady Jane Grey), had a sad sense of falling below her mission.




The incident that had preceded Isabel's departure from Gardencourt left a painful trace in our young woman's mind: when she felt again in her face, as from a recurrent wave, the cold breath of her last suitor's surprise, she could only muffle her head till the air cleared. She could not have done less than what she did; this was certainly true. But her necessity, all the same, had been as graceless as some physical act in a strained attitude, and she felt no desire to take credit for her conduct. Mixed with this imperfect pride, nevertheless, was a feeling of freedom which in itself was sweet and which, as she wandered through the great city with her ill-matched companions, occasionally throbbed into odd demonstrations. When she walked in Kensington Gardens she stopped the children (mainly of the poorer sort) whom she saw playing on the grass; she asked them their names and gave them sixpence and, when they were pretty, kissed them. Ralph noticed these quaint charities; he noticed everything she did. One afternoon, that his companions might pass the time, he invited them to tea in Winchester Square, and he had the house set in order as much as possible for their visit. There was another guest to meet them, an amiable bachelor, an old friend of Ralph's who happened to be in town and for whom prompt commerce with Miss Stackpole appeared to have neither difficulty nor dread. Mr. Bantling, a stout, sleek, smiling man of forty, wonderfully dressed, universally informed and incoherently amused, laughed immoderately at everything Henrietta said, gave her several cups of tea, examined in her society the bric-a-brac, of which Ralph had a considerable collection, and afterwards, when the host proposed they should go out into the square and pretend it was a fete-champetre, walked round the limited enclosure several times with her and, at a dozen turns of their talk, bounded responsive—as with a positive passion for argument—to her remarks upon the inner life.




""Oh, I see; I dare say you found it very quiet at Gardencourt. Naturally there's not much going on there when there's such a lot of illness about. Touchett's very bad, you know; the doctors have forbidden his being in England at all, and he has only come back to take care of his father. The old man, I believe, has half a dozen things the matter with him. They call it gout, but to my certain knowledge he has organic disease so developed that you may depend upon it he'll go, some day soon, quite quickly. Of course that sort of thing makes a dreadfully dull house; I wonder they have people when they can do so little for them. Then I believe Mr. Touchett's always squabbling with his wife; she lives away from her husband, you know, in that extraordinary American way of yours. If you want a house where there's always something going on, I recommend you to go down and stay with my sister, Lady Pensil, in Bedfordshire. I'll write to her to-morrow and I'm sure she'll be delighted to ask you. I know just what you want—you want a house where they go in for theatricals and picnics and that sort of thing. My sister's just that sort of woman; she's always getting up something or other and she's always glad to have the sort of people who help her. I'm sure she'll ask you down by return of post: she's tremendously fond of distinguished people and writers. She writes herself, you know; but I haven't read everything she has written. It's usually poetry, and I don't go in much for poetry—unless it's Byron. I suppose you think a great deal of Byron in America,"" Mr. Bantling continued, expanding in the stimulating air of Miss Stackpole's attention, bringing up his sequences promptly and changing his topic with an easy turn of hand. Yet he none the less gracefully kept in sight of the idea, dazzling to Henrietta, of her going to stay with Lady Pensil in Bedfordshire. ""I understand what you want; you want to see some genuine English sport. The Touchetts aren't English at all, you know; they have their own habits, their own language, their own food—some odd religion even, I believe, of their own. The old man thinks it's wicked to hunt, I'm told. You must get down to my sister's in time for the theatricals, and I'm sure she'll be glad to give you a part. I'm sure you act well; I know you're very clever. My sister's forty years old and has seven children, but she's going to play the principal part. Plain as she is she makes up awfully well—I will say for her. Of course you needn't act if you don't want to.""




In this manner Mr. Bantling delivered himself while they strolled over the grass in Winchester Square, which, although it had been peppered by the London soot, invited the tread to linger. Henrietta thought her blooming, easy-voiced bachelor, with his impressibility to feminine merit and his splendid range of suggestion, a very agreeable man, and she valued the opportunity he offered her. ""I don't know but I would go, if your sister should ask me. I think it would be my duty. What do you call her name?""




""Pensil. It's an odd name, but it isn't a bad one.""




""I think one name's as good as another. But what's her rank?"".




""Oh, she's a baron's wife; a convenient sort of rank. You're fine enough and you're not too fine.""




""I don't know but what she'd be too fine for me. What do you call the place she lives in—Bedfordshire?""




""She lives away in the northern corner of it. It's a tiresome country, but I dare say you won't mind it. I'll try and run down while you're there.""




All this was very pleasant to Miss Stackpole, and she was sorry to be obliged to separate from Lady Pensil's obliging brother. But it happened that she had met the day before, in Piccadilly, some friends whom she had not seen for a year: the Miss Climbers, two ladies from Wilmington, Delaware, who had been travelling on the Continent and were now preparing to re-embark. Henrietta had had a long interview with them on the Piccadilly pavement, and though the three ladies all talked at once they had not exhausted their store. It had been agreed therefore that Henrietta should come and dine with them in their lodgings in Jermyn Street at six o'clock on the morrow, and she now bethought herself of this engagement. She prepared to start for Jermyn Street, taking leave first of Ralph Touchett and Isabel, who, seated on garden chairs in another part of the enclosure, were occupied—if the term may be used—with an exchange of amenities less pointed than the practical colloquy of Miss Stackpole and Mr. Bantling. When it had been settled between Isabel and her friend that they should be reunited at some reputable hour at Pratt's Hotel, Ralph remarked that the latter must have a cab. She couldn't walk all the way to Jermyn Street.




""I suppose you mean it's improper for me to walk alone!"" Henrietta exclaimed. ""Merciful powers, have I come to this?""




""There's not the slightest need of your walking alone,"" Mr. Bantling gaily interposed. ""I should be greatly pleased to go with you.""




""I simply meant that you'd be late for dinner,"" Ralph returned. ""Those poor ladies may easily believe that we refuse, at the last, to spare you.""




""You had better have a hansom, Henrietta,"" said Isabel.




""I'll get you a hansom if you'll trust me,"" Mr. Bantling went on.




""We might walk a little till we meet one.""




""I don't see why I shouldn't trust him, do you?"" Henrietta enquired of Isabel.




""I don't see what Mr. Bantling could do to you,"" Isabel obligingly answered; ""but, if you like, we'll walk with you till you find your cab.""




""Never mind; we'll go alone. Come on, Mr. Bantling, and take care you get me a good one.""




Mr. Bantling promised to do his best, and the two took their departure, leaving the girl and her cousin together in the square, over which a clear September twilight had now begun to gather. It was perfectly still; the wide quadrangle of dusky houses showed lights in none of the windows, where the shutters and blinds were closed; the pavements were a vacant expanse, and, putting aside two small children from a neighbouring slum, who, attracted by symptoms of abnormal animation in the interior, poked their faces between the rusty rails of the enclosure, the most vivid object within sight was the big red pillar-post on the southeast corner.




""Henrietta will ask him to get into the cab and go with her to Jermyn Street,"" Ralph observed. He always spoke of Miss Stackpole as Henrietta.




""Very possibly,"" said his companion.




""Or rather, no, she won't,"" he went on. ""But Bantling will ask leave to get in.""




""Very likely again. I'm glad very they're such good friends.""




""She has made a conquest. He thinks her a brilliant woman. It may go far,"" said Ralph.




Isabel was briefly silent. ""I call Henrietta a very brilliant woman, but I don't think it will go far. They would never really know each other. He has not the least idea what she really is, and she has no just comprehension of Mr. Bantling.""




""There's no more usual basis of union than a mutual misunderstanding. But it ought not to be so difficult to understand Bob Bantling,"" Ralph added. ""He is a very simple organism.""




""Yes, but Henrietta's a simpler one still. And, pray, what am I to do?"" Isabel asked, looking about her through the fading light, in which the limited landscape-gardening of the square took on a large and effective appearance. ""I don't imagine that you'll propose that you and I, for our amusement, shall drive about London in a hansom.""




""There's no reason we shouldn't stay here—if you don't dislike it. It's very warm; there will he half an hour yet before dark; and if you permit it I'll light a cigarette.""




""You may do what you please,"" said Isabel, ""if you'll amuse me till seven o'clock. I propose at that hour to go back and partake of a simple and solitary repast—two poached eggs and a muffin—at Pratt's Hotel.""




""Mayn't I dine with you?"" Ralph asked.




""No, you'll dine at your club.""




They had wandered back to their chairs in the centre of the square again, and Ralph had lighted his cigarette. It would have given him extreme pleasure to be present in person at the modest little feast she had sketched; but in default of this he liked even being forbidden. For the moment, however, he liked immensely being alone with her, in the thickening dusk, in the centre of the multitudinous town; it made her seem to depend upon him and to be in his power. This power he could exert but vaguely; the best exercise of it was to accept her decisions submissively which indeed there was already an emotion in doing. ""Why won't you let me dine with you?"" he demanded after a pause.




""Because I don't care for it.""




""I suppose you're tired of me.""




""I shall be an hour hence. You see I have the gift of foreknowledge.""




""Oh, I shall be delightful meanwhile,"" said Ralph.




But he said nothing more, and as she made no rejoinder they sat some time in a stillness which seemed to contradict his promise of entertainment. It seemed to him she was preoccupied, and he wondered what she was thinking about; there were two or three very possible subjects. At last he spoke again. ""Is your objection to my society this evening caused by your expectation of another visitor?""




She turned her head with a glance of her clear, fair eyes. ""Another visitor? What visitor should I have?""




He had none to suggest; which made his question seem to himself silly as well as brutal. ""You've a great many friends that I don't know. You've a whole past from which I was perversely excluded.""




""You were reserved for my future. You must remember that my past is over there across the water. There's none of it here in London.""




""Very good, then, since your future is seated beside you. Capital thing to have your future so handy."" And Ralph lighted another cigarette and reflected that Isabel probably meant she had received news that Mr. Caspar Goodwood had crossed to Paris. After he had lighted his cigarette he puffed it a while, and then he resumed. ""I promised just now to be very amusing; but you see I don't come up to the mark, and the fact is there's a good deal of temerity in one's undertaking to amuse a person like you. What do you care for my feeble attempts? You've grand ideas—you've a high standard in such matters. I ought at least to bring in a band of music or a company of mountebanks.""




""One mountebank's enough, and you do very well. Pray go on, and in another ten minutes I shall begin to laugh.""




""I assure you I'm very serious,"" said Ralph. ""You do really ask a great deal.""




""I don't know what you mean. I ask nothing.""




""You accept nothing,"" said Ralph. She coloured, and now suddenly it seemed to her that she guessed his meaning. But why should he speak to her of such things? He hesitated a little and then he continued: ""There's something I should like very much to say to you. It's a ques tion I wish to ask. It seems to me I've a right to ask it, because I've a kind of interest in the answer.""




""Ask what you will,"" Isabel replied gently, ""and I'll try to satisfy you.""




""Well then, I hope you won't mind my saying that Warburton has told me of something that has passed between you.""




Isabel suppressed a start; she sat looking at her open fan. ""Very good; I suppose it was natural he should tell you.""




""I have his leave to let you know he has done so. He has some hope still,"" said Ralph.




""Still?""




""He had it a few days ago.""




""I don't believe he has any now,"" said the girl.




""I'm very sorry for him then; he's such an honest man.""




""Pray, did he ask you to talk to me?""




""No, not that. But he told me because he couldn't help it. We're old friends, and he was greatly disappointed. He sent me a line asking me to come and see him, and I drove over to Lockleigh the day before he and his sister lunched with us. He was very heavy-hearted; he had just got a letter from you.""




""Did he show you the letter?"" asked Isabel with momentary loftiness.




""By no means. But he told me it was a neat refusal. I was very sorry for him,"" Ralph repeated.




For some moments Isabel said nothing; then at last, ""Do you know how often he had seen me?"" she enquired. ""Five or six times.""




""That's to your glory.""




""It's not for that I say it.""




""What then do you say it for. Not to prove that poor Warburton's state of mind's superficial, because I'm pretty sure you don't think that.""




Isabel certainly was unable to say she thought it; but presently she said something else. ""If you've not been requested by Lord Warburton to argue with me, then you're doing it disinterestedly —or for the love of argument.""




""I've no wish to argue with you at all. I only wish to leave you alone. I'm simply greatly interested in your own sentiments.""




""I'm greatly obliged to you!"" cried Isabel with a slightly nervous laugh.




""Of course you mean that I'm meddling in what doesn't concern me. But why shouldn't I speak to you of this matter without annoying you or embarrassing myself? What's the use of being your cousin if I can't have a few privileges? What's the use of adoring you without hope of a reward if I can't have a few compensations? What's the use of being ill and disabled and restricted to mere spectatorship at the game of life if I really can't see the show when I've paid so much for my ticket? Tell me this,"" Ralph went on while she listened to him with quickened attention. ""What had you in mind when you refused Lord Warburton?""




""What had I in mind?""




""What was the logic—the view of your situation—that dictated so remarkable an act?""




""I didn't wish to marry him—if that's logic.""




""No, that's not logic—and I knew that before. It's really nothing, you know. What was it you said to yourself? You certainly said more than that.""




Isabel reflected a moment, then answered with a question of her own. ""Why do you call it a remarkable act? That's what your mother thinks too.""




""Warburton's such a thorough good sort; as a man, I consider he has hardly a fault. And then he's what they call here no end of a swell. He has immense possessions, and his wife would be thought a superior being. He unites the intrinsic and the extrinsic advantages.""




Isabel watched her cousin as to see how far he would go. ""I refused him because he was too perfect then. I'm not perfect myself, and he's too good for me. Besides, his perfection would irritate me.""




""That's ingenious rather than candid,"" said Ralph. ""As a fact you think nothing in the world too perfect for you.""




""Do you think I'm so good?""




""No, but you're exacting, all the same, without the excuse of thinking yourself good. Nineteen women out of twenty, however, even of the most exacting sort, would have managed to do with Warburton. Perhaps you don't know how he has been stalked.""




""I don't wish to know. But it seems to me,"" said Isabel, ""that one day when we talked of him you mentioned odd things in him."" Ralph smokingly considered. ""I hope that what I said then had no weight with you; for they were not faults, the things I spoke of: they were simply peculiarities of his position. If I had known he wished to marry you I'd never have alluded to them. I think I said that as regards that position he was rather a sceptic. It would have been in your power to make him a believer.""




""I think not. I don't understand the matter, and I'm not conscious of any mission of that sort. You're evidently disappointed,"" Isabel added, looking at her cousin with rueful gentleness. ""You'd have liked me to make such a marriage.""




""Not in the least. I'm absolutely without a wish on the subject. I don't pretend to advise you, and I content myself with watching you—with the deepest interest.""




She gave rather a conscious sigh. ""I wish I could be as interesting to myself as I am to you!""




""There you're not candid again; you're extremely interesting to yourself. Do you know, however,"" said Ralph, ""that if you've really given Warburton his final answer I'm rather glad it has been what it was. I don't mean I'm glad for you, and still less of course for him. I'm glad for myself.""




""Are you thinking of proposing to me?""




""By no means. From the point of view I speak of that would be fatal; I should kill the goose that supplies me with the material of my inimitable omelettes. I use that animal as the symbol of my insane illusions. What I mean is that I shall have the thrill of seeing what a young lady does who won't marry Lord Warburton.""




""That's what your mother counts upon too,"" said Isabel.




""Ah, there will be plenty of spectators! We shall hang on the rest of your career. I shall not see all of it, but I shall probably see the most interesting years. Of course if you were to marry our friend you'd still have a career—a very decent, in fact a very brilliant one. But relatively speaking it would be a little prosaic. It would be definitely marked out in advance; it would be wanting in the unexpected. You know I'm extremely fond of the unexpected, and now that you've kept the game in your hands I depend on your giving us some grand example of it.""




""I don't understand you very well,"" said Isabel, ""but I do so well enough to be able to say that if you look for grand examples of anything from me I shall disappoint you.""




""You'll do so only by disappointing yourself and that will go hard with you!""




To this she made no direct reply; there was an amount of truth in it that would bear consideration. At last she said abruptly: ""I don't see what harm there is in my wishing not to tie myself. I don't want to begin life by marrying. There are other things a woman can do.""




""There's nothing she can do so well. But you're of course so many-sided.""




""If one's two-sided it's enough,"" said Isabel.




""You're the most charming of polygons!"" her companion broke out. At a glance from his companion, however, he became grave, and to prove it went on: ""You want to see life—you'll be hanged if you don't, as the young men say.""




""I don't think I want to see it as the young men want to see it. But I do want to look about me.""




""You want to drain the cup of experience.""




""No, I don't wish to touch the cup of experience. It's a poisoned drink! I only want to see for myself.""




""You want to see, but not to feel,"" Ralph remarked.




""I don't think that if one's a sentient being one can make the distinction. I'm a good deal like Henrietta. The other day when I asked her if she wished to marry she said: 'Not till I've seen Europe!' I too don't wish to marry till I've seen Europe.""




""You evidently expect a crowned head will be struck with you.""




""No, that would be worse than marrying Lord Warburton. But it's getting very dark,"" Isabel continued, ""and I must go home."" She rose from her place, but Ralph only sat still and looked at her. As he remained there she stopped, and they exchanged a gaze that was full on either side, but especially on Ralph's, of utterances too vague for words.




""You've answered my question,"" he said at last. ""You've told me what I wanted. I'm greatly obliged to you.""




""It seems to me I've told you very little.""




""You've told me the great thing: that the world interests you and that you want to throw yourself into it.""




Her silvery eyes shone a moment in the dusk. ""I never said that."" ""I think you meant it. Don't repudiate it. It's so fine!""




""I don't know what you're trying to fasten upon me, for I'm not in the least an adventurous spirit. Women are not like men.""




Ralph slowly rose from his seat and they walked together to the gate of the square. ""No,"" he said; ""women rarely boast of their courage. Men do so with a certain frequency.""




""Men have it to boast of!""




""Women have it too. You've a great deal.""




""Enough to go home in a cab to Pratt's Hotel, but not more.""




Ralph unlocked the gate, and after they had passed out he fastened it. ""We'll find your cab,"" he said; and as they turned toward a neighbouring street in which this quest might avail he asked her again if he mightn't see her safely to the inn.




""By no means,"" she answered; ""you're very tired; you must go home and go to bed.""




The cab was found, and he helped her into it, standing a moment at the door. ""When people forget I'm a poor creature I'm often incommoded,"" he said. ""But it's worse when they remember it!"""|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"
"ap < 09:00"|"toward nine o'clock"|"She had had no hidden motive in wishing him not to take her home; it simply struck her that for some days past she had consumed an inordinate quantity of his time, and the independent spirit of the American girl whom extravagance of aid places in an attitude that she ends by finding ""affected"" had made her decide that for these few hours she must suffice to herself. She had moreover a great fondness for intervals of solitude, which since her arrival in England had been but meagrely met. It was a luxury she could always command at home and she had wittingly missed it. That evening, however, an incident occurred which—had there been a critic to note it—would have taken all colour from the theory that the wish to be quite by herself had caused her to dispense with her cousin's attendance. Seated toward nine o'clock in the dim illumination of Pratt's Hotel and trying with the aid of two tall candles to lose herself in a volume she had brought from Gardencourt, she succeeded only to the extent of reading other words than those printed on the page—words that Ralph had spoken to her that afternoon. Suddenly the well-muffed knuckle of the waiter was applied to the door, which presently gave way to his exhibition, even as a glorious trophy, of the card of a visitor. When this memento had offered to her fixed sight the name of Mr. Caspar Goodwood she let the man stand before her without signifying her wishes.




""Shall I show the gentleman up, ma'am?"" he asked with a slightly encouraging inflexion.




Isabel hesitated still and while she hesitated glanced at the mirror. ""He may come in,"" she said at last; and waited for him not so much smoothing her hair as girding her spirit.




Caspar Goodwood was accordingly the next moment shaking hands with her, but saying nothing till the servant had left the room. ""Why didn't you answer my letter?"" he then asked in a quick, full, slightly peremptory tone—the tone of a man whose questions were habitually pointed and who was capable of much insistence.




She answered by a ready question, ""How did you know I was here?""




""Miss Stackpole let me know,"" said Caspar Goodwood. ""She told me you would probably be at home alone this evening and would be willing to see me.""




""Where did she see you—to tell you that?""




""She didn't see me; she wrote to me.""




Isabel was silent; neither had sat down; they stood there with an air of defiance, or at least of contention. ""Henrietta never told me she was writing to you,"" she said at last. ""This is not kind of her.""




""Is it so disagreeable to you to see me?"" asked the young man.




""I didn't expect it. I don't like such surprises.""




""But you knew I was in town; it was natural we should meet.""




""Do you call this meeting? I hoped I shouldn't see you. In so big a place as London it seemed very possible.""




""It was apparently repugnant to you even to write to me,"" her visitor went on.




Isabel made no reply; the sense of Henrietta Stackpole's treachery, as she momentarily qualified it, was strong within her. ""Henrietta's certainly not a model of all the delicacies!"" she exclaimed with bitterness. ""It was a great liberty to take.""




""I suppose I'm not a model either—of those virtues or of any others. The fault's mine as much as hers.""




As Isabel looked at him it seemed to her that his jaw had never been more square. This might have displeased her, but she took a different turn. ""No, it's not your fault so much as hers. What you've done was inevitable, I suppose, for you.""




""It was indeed!"" cried Caspar Goodwood with a voluntary laugh.




""And now that I've come, at any rate, mayn't I stay?""




""You may sit down, certainly.""




She went back to her chair again, while her visitor took the first place that offered, in the manner of a man accustomed to pay little thought to that sort of furtherance. ""I've been hoping every day for an answer to my letter. You might have written me a few lines.""




""It wasn't the trouble of writing that prevented me; I could as easily have written you four pages as one. But my silence was an intention,"" Isabel said. ""I thought it the best thing.""




He sat with his eyes fixed on hers while she spoke; then he lowered them and attached them to a spot in the carpet as if he were making a strong effort to say nothing but what he ought. He was a strong man in the wrong, and he was acute enough to see that an uncompromising exhibition of his strength would only throw the falsity of his position into relief. Isabel was not incapable of tasting any advantage of position over a person of this quality, and though little desirous to flaunt it in his face she could enjoy being able to say ""You know you oughtn't to have written to me yourself!"" and to say it with an air of triumph.




Caspar Goodwood raised his eyes to her own again; they seemed to shine through the vizard of a helmet. He had a strong sense of justice and was ready any day in the year—over and above this—to argue the question of his rights. ""You said you hoped never to hear from me again; I know that. But I never accepted any such rule as my own. I warned you that you should hear very soon.""




""I didn't say I hoped never  to hear from you,"" said Isabel."|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"
"ap 00:30"|"half-past twelve"|"She was not praying; she was trembling—trembling all over. Vibration was easy to her, was in fact too constant with her, and she found herself now humming like a smitten harp. She only asked, however, to put on the cover, to case herself again in brown holland, but she wished to resist her excitement, and the attitude of devotion, which she kept for some time, seemed to help her to be still. She intensely rejoiced that Caspar Goodwood was gone; there was something in having thus got rid of him that was like the payment, for a stamped receipt, of some debt too long on her mind. As she felt the glad relief she bowed her head a little lower; the sense was there, throbbing in her heart; it was part of her emotion, but it was a thing to be ashamed of—it was profane and out of place. It was not for some ten minutes that she rose from her knees, and even when she came back to the sitting-room her tremor had not quite subsided. It had had, verily, two causes: part of it was to be accounted for by her long discussion with Mr. Goodwood, but it might be feared that the rest was simply the enjoyment she found in the exercise of her power. She sat down in the same chair again and took up her book, but without going through the form of opening the volume. She leaned back, with that low, soft, aspiring murmur with which she often uttered her response to accidents of which the brighter side was not superficially obvious, and yielded to the satisfaction of having refused two ardent suitors in a fortnight. That love of liberty of which she had given Caspar Goodwood so bold a sketch was as yet almost exclusively theoretic; she had not been able to indulge it on a large scale. But it appeared to her she had done something; she had tasted of the delight, if not of battle, at least of victory; she had done what was truest to her plan. In the glow of this consciousness the image of Mr. Goodwood taking his sad walk homeward through the dingy town presented itself with a certain reproachful force; so that, as at the same moment the door of the room was opened, she rose with an apprehension that he had come back. But it was only Henrietta Stackpole returning from her dinner.




Miss Stackpole immediately saw that our young lady had been ""through"" something, and indeed the discovery demanded no great penetration. She went straight up to her friend, who received her without a greeting. Isabel's elation in having sent Caspar Goodwood back to America presupposed her being in a manner glad he had come to see her; but at the same time she perfectly remembered Henrietta had had no right to set a trap for her. ""Has he been here, dear?"" the latter yearningly asked.




Isabel turned away and for some moments answered nothing. ""You acted very wrongly,"" she declared at last.




""I acted for the best. I only hope you acted as well.""




""You're not the judge. I can't trust you,"" said Isabel.




This declaration was unflattering, but Henrietta was much too unselfish to heed the charge it conveyed; she cared only for what it intimated with regard to her friend. ""Isabel Archer,"" she observed with equal abruptness and solemnity, ""if you marry one of these people I'll never speak to you again!""




""Before making so terrible a threat you had better wait till I'm asked,"" Isabel replied. Never having said a word to Miss Stackpole about Lord Warburton's overtures, she had now no impulse whatever to justify herself to Henrietta by telling her that she had refused that nobleman.




""Oh, you'll be asked quick enough, once you get off on the Continent. Annie Climber was asked three times in Italy - poor plain little Annie.""




""Well, if Annie Climber wasn't captured why should I be?""




""I don't believe Annie was pressed; but you'll be.""




""That's a flattering conviction,"" said Isabel without alarm.




""I don't flatter you, Isabel, I tell you the truth!"" cried her friend. ""I hope you don't mean to tell me that you didn't give Mr. Goodwood some hope.""




""I don't see why I should tell you anything; as I said to you just now, I can't trust you. But since you're so much interested in Mr. Goodwood I won't conceal from you that he returns immediately to America.""




""You don't mean to say you've sent him off?"" Henrietta almost shrieked.




""I asked him to leave me alone; and I ask you the same, Henrietta."" Miss Stackpole glittered for an instant with dismay, and then passed to the mirror over the chimney-piece and took off her bonnet. ""I hope you've enjoyed your dinner,"" Isabel went on.




But her companion was not to be diverted by frivolous propositions. ""Do you know where you're going, Isabel Archer?""




""Just now I'm going to bed,"" said Isabel with persistent frivolity.




""Do you know where you're drifting?"" Henrietta pursued, holding out her bonnet delicately.




""No, I haven't the least idea, and I find it very pleasant not to know. A swift carriage, of a dark night, rattling with four horses over roads that one can't see—that's my idea of happiness.""




""Mr. Goodwood certainly didn't teach you to say such things as that—like the heroine of an immoral novel,"" said Miss Stackpole. ""You're drifting to some great mistake.""




Isabel was irritated by her friend's interference, yet she still tried to think what truth this declaration could rep resent. She could think of nothing that diverted her from saying: ""You must be very fond of me, Henrietta, to be willing to be so aggressive.""




""I love you intensely, Isabel,"" said Miss Stackpole with feeling,




""Well, if you love me intensely let me as intensely alone. I asked that of Mr. Goodwood, and I must also ask it of you.""




""Take care you're not let alone too much.""




""That's what Mr. Goodwood said to me. I told him I must take the risks.""




""You're a creature of risks—you make me shudder!"" cried Henrietta. ""When does Mr. Goodwood return to America?""




""I don't know—he didn't tell me.""




""Perhaps you didn't enquire,"" said Henrietta with the note of righteous irony.




""I gave him too little satisfaction to have the right to ask questions of him.""




This assertion seemed to Miss Stackpole for a moment to bid defiance to comment; but at last she exclaimed: ""Well, Isabel, if I didn't know you I might think you were heartless!""




""Take care,"" said Isabel; ""you're spoiling me.""




""I'm afraid I've done that already. I hope, at least,"" Miss Stackpole added, ""that he may cross with Annie Climber!""




Isabel learned from her the next morning that she had determined not to return to Gardencourt (where old Mr. Touchett had promised her a renewed welcome), but to await in London the arrival of the invitation that Mr. Bantling had promised her from his sister Lady Pensil. Miss Stackpole related very freely her conversation with Ralph Touchett's sociable friend and declared to Isabel that she really believed she had now got hold of something that would lead to something. On the receipt of Lady Pensil's letter—Mr. Bantling had virtually guaranteed the arrival of this document—she would immediately depart for Bedfordshire, and if Isabel cared to look out for her impressions in the Interviewer she would certainly find them. Henrietta was evidently going to see something of the inner life this time.




""Do you know where you're drifting, Henrietta Stackpole?"" Isabel asked, imitating the tone in which her friend had spoken the night before.




""I'm drifting to a big position—that of the Queen of American Journalism. If my next letter isn't copied all over the West I'll swallow my penwiper!""




She had arranged with her friend Miss Annie Climber, the young lady of the continental offers, that they should go together to make those purchases which were to constitute Miss Climber's farewell to a hemisphere in which she at least had been appreciated; and she presently repaired to Jermyn Street to pick up her companion. Shortly after her departure Ralph Touchett was announced, and as soon as he came in Isabel saw he had something on his mind. He very soon took his cousin into his confidence. He had received from his mother a telegram to the effect that his father had had a sharp attack of his old malady, that she was much alarmed and that she begged he would instantly return to Gardencourt. On this occasion at least Mrs. Touchett's devotion to the electric wire was not open to criticism.




""I've judged it best to see the great doctor, Sir Matthew Hope, first,"" Ralph said; ""by great good luck he's in town. He's to see me at half-past twelve, and I shall make sure of his coming down to Gardencourt—which he will do the more readily as he has already seen my father several times, both there and in London. There's an express at two-forty-five, which I shall take; and you'll come back with me or remain here a few days longer, exactly as you prefer.""




""I shall certainly go with you,"" Isabel returned. ""I don't suppose I can be of any use to my uncle, but if he's ill I shall like to be near him.""




""I think you're fond of him,"" said Ralph with a certain shy pleasure in his face. ""You appreciate him, which all the world hasn't done. The quality's too fine.""




""I quite adore him,"" Isabel after a moment said.




""That's very well. After his son he's your greatest admirer."" She welcomed this assurance, but she gave secretly a small sigh of relief at the thought that Mr. Touchett was one of those admirers who couldn't propose to marry her. This, however, was not what she spoke; she went on to inform Ralph that there were other reasons for her not remaining in London. She was tired of it and wished to leave it; and then Henrietta was going away—going to stay in Bedfordshire.




""In Bedfordshire?""




""With Lady Pensil, the sister of Mr. Bantling, who has answered for an invitation.""




Ralph was feeling anxious, but at this he broke into a laugh. Suddenly, none the less, his gravity returned. ""Bantling's a man of courage. But if the invitation should get lost on the way?""




""I thought the British post-office was impeccable.""




""The good Homer sometimes nods,"" said Ralph. ""However,"" he went on more brightly, ""the good Bantling never does, and, whatever happens, he'll take care of Henrietta.""




Ralph went to keep his appointment with Sir Matthew Hope, and Isabel made her arrangements for quitting Pratt's Hotel. Her uncle's danger touched her nearly, and while she stood before her open trunk, looking about her vaguely for what she should put into it, the tears suddenly rose to her eyes. It was perhaps for this reason that when Ralph came back at two o'clock to take her to the station she was not yet ready. He found Miss Stackpole, however, in the sitting-room, where she had just risen from her luncheon, and this lady immediately expressed her regret at his father's illness.




""He's a grand old man,"" she said; ""he's faithful to the last. If it's really to be the last—pardon my alluding to it, but you must often have thought of the possibility—I'm sorry that I shall not be at Gardencourt.""




""You'll amuse yourself much more in Bedfordshire.""




""I shall be sorry to amuse myself at such a time,"" said Henrietta with much propriety. But she immediately added: ""I should like so to commemorate the closing scene.""




""My father may live a long time,"" said Ralph simply. Then, adverting to topics more cheerful, he interrogated Miss Stackpole as to her own future.




Now that Ralph was in trouble she addressed him in a tone of larger allowance and told him that she was much indebted to him for having made her acquainted with Mr. Bantling. ""He has told me just the things I want to know,"" she said; ""all the society items and all about the royal family. I can't make out that what he tells me about the royal family is much to their credit; but he says that's only my peculiar way of looking at it. Well, all I want is that he should give me the facts; I can put them together quick enough, once I've got them."" And she added that Mr. Bantling had been so good as to promise to come and take her out that afternoon.




""To take you where?"" Ralph ventured to enquire.




""To Buckingham Palace. He's going to show me over it, so that I may get some idea how they live.""




""Ah,"" said Ralph, ""we leave you in good hands. The first thing we shall hear is that you're invited to Windsor Castle.""




""If they ask me, I shall certainly go. Once I get started I'm not afraid. But for all that,"" Henrietta added in a moment, ""I'm not satisfied; I'm not at peace about Isabel.""




""What is her last misdemeanour?""




""Well, I've told you before, and I suppose there's no harm in my going on. I always finish a subject that I take up. Mr. Goodwood was here last night.""




Ralph opened his eyes; he even blushed a little—his blush being the sign of an emotion somewhat acute. He remembered that Isabel, in separating from him in Winchester Square, had repudiated his suggestion that her motive in doing so was the expectation of a visitor at Pratt's Hotel, and it was a new pang to him to have to suspect her of duplicity. On the other hand, he quickly said to himself, what concern was it of his that she should have made an appointment with a lover? Had it not been thought graceful in every age that young ladies should make a mystery of such appointments? Ralph gave Miss Stackpole a diplomatic answer. ""I should have thought that, with the views you expressed to me the other day, this would satisfy you perfectly.""




""That he should come to see her? That was very well, as far as it went. It was a little plot of mine; I let him know that we were in London, and when it had been arranged that I should spend the evening out I sent him a word—the word we just utter to the 'wise.' I hoped he would find her alone; I won't pretend I didn't hope that you'd be out of the way. He came to see her, but he might as well have stayed away.""




""Isabel was cruel?""—and Ralph's face lighted with the relief of his cousin's not having shown duplicity.




""I don't exactly know what passed between them. But she gave him no satisfaction—she sent him back to America.""




""Poor Mr. Goodwood!"" Ralph sighed.




""Her only idea seems to be to get rid of him,"" Henrietta went on.




""Poor Mr. Goodwood!"" Ralph repeated. The exclamation, it must be confessed, was automatic; it failed exactly to express his thoughts, which were taking another line.




""You don't say that as if you felt it. I don't believe you care.""




""Ah,"" said Ralph, ""you must remember that I don't know this interesting young man—that I've never seen him.""




""Well, I shall see him, and I shall tell him not to give up. If I didn't believe Isabel would come round,"" Miss Stackpole added—""well, I'd give up myself. I mean I'd give her  up!"""|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"
"ap 02:45"|two-forty-five|"She was not praying; she was trembling—trembling all over. Vibration was easy to her, was in fact too constant with her, and she found herself now humming like a smitten harp. She only asked, however, to put on the cover, to case herself again in brown holland, but she wished to resist her excitement, and the attitude of devotion, which she kept for some time, seemed to help her to be still. She intensely rejoiced that Caspar Goodwood was gone; there was something in having thus got rid of him that was like the payment, for a stamped receipt, of some debt too long on her mind. As she felt the glad relief she bowed her head a little lower; the sense was there, throbbing in her heart; it was part of her emotion, but it was a thing to be ashamed of—it was profane and out of place. It was not for some ten minutes that she rose from her knees, and even when she came back to the sitting-room her tremor had not quite subsided. It had had, verily, two causes: part of it was to be accounted for by her long discussion with Mr. Goodwood, but it might be feared that the rest was simply the enjoyment she found in the exercise of her power. She sat down in the same chair again and took up her book, but without going through the form of opening the volume. She leaned back, with that low, soft, aspiring murmur with which she often uttered her response to accidents of which the brighter side was not superficially obvious, and yielded to the satisfaction of having refused two ardent suitors in a fortnight. That love of liberty of which she had given Caspar Goodwood so bold a sketch was as yet almost exclusively theoretic; she had not been able to indulge it on a large scale. But it appeared to her she had done something; she had tasted of the delight, if not of battle, at least of victory; she had done what was truest to her plan. In the glow of this consciousness the image of Mr. Goodwood taking his sad walk homeward through the dingy town presented itself with a certain reproachful force; so that, as at the same moment the door of the room was opened, she rose with an apprehension that he had come back. But it was only Henrietta Stackpole returning from her dinner.




Miss Stackpole immediately saw that our young lady had been ""through"" something, and indeed the discovery demanded no great penetration. She went straight up to her friend, who received her without a greeting. Isabel's elation in having sent Caspar Goodwood back to America presupposed her being in a manner glad he had come to see her; but at the same time she perfectly remembered Henrietta had had no right to set a trap for her. ""Has he been here, dear?"" the latter yearningly asked.




Isabel turned away and for some moments answered nothing. ""You acted very wrongly,"" she declared at last.




""I acted for the best. I only hope you acted as well.""




""You're not the judge. I can't trust you,"" said Isabel.




This declaration was unflattering, but Henrietta was much too unselfish to heed the charge it conveyed; she cared only for what it intimated with regard to her friend. ""Isabel Archer,"" she observed with equal abruptness and solemnity, ""if you marry one of these people I'll never speak to you again!""




""Before making so terrible a threat you had better wait till I'm asked,"" Isabel replied. Never having said a word to Miss Stackpole about Lord Warburton's overtures, she had now no impulse whatever to justify herself to Henrietta by telling her that she had refused that nobleman.




""Oh, you'll be asked quick enough, once you get off on the Continent. Annie Climber was asked three times in Italy - poor plain little Annie.""




""Well, if Annie Climber wasn't captured why should I be?""




""I don't believe Annie was pressed; but you'll be.""




""That's a flattering conviction,"" said Isabel without alarm.




""I don't flatter you, Isabel, I tell you the truth!"" cried her friend. ""I hope you don't mean to tell me that you didn't give Mr. Goodwood some hope.""




""I don't see why I should tell you anything; as I said to you just now, I can't trust you. But since you're so much interested in Mr. Goodwood I won't conceal from you that he returns immediately to America.""




""You don't mean to say you've sent him off?"" Henrietta almost shrieked.




""I asked him to leave me alone; and I ask you the same, Henrietta."" Miss Stackpole glittered for an instant with dismay, and then passed to the mirror over the chimney-piece and took off her bonnet. ""I hope you've enjoyed your dinner,"" Isabel went on.




But her companion was not to be diverted by frivolous propositions. ""Do you know where you're going, Isabel Archer?""




""Just now I'm going to bed,"" said Isabel with persistent frivolity.




""Do you know where you're drifting?"" Henrietta pursued, holding out her bonnet delicately.




""No, I haven't the least idea, and I find it very pleasant not to know. A swift carriage, of a dark night, rattling with four horses over roads that one can't see—that's my idea of happiness.""




""Mr. Goodwood certainly didn't teach you to say such things as that—like the heroine of an immoral novel,"" said Miss Stackpole. ""You're drifting to some great mistake.""




Isabel was irritated by her friend's interference, yet she still tried to think what truth this declaration could rep resent. She could think of nothing that diverted her from saying: ""You must be very fond of me, Henrietta, to be willing to be so aggressive.""




""I love you intensely, Isabel,"" said Miss Stackpole with feeling,




""Well, if you love me intensely let me as intensely alone. I asked that of Mr. Goodwood, and I must also ask it of you.""




""Take care you're not let alone too much.""




""That's what Mr. Goodwood said to me. I told him I must take the risks.""




""You're a creature of risks—you make me shudder!"" cried Henrietta. ""When does Mr. Goodwood return to America?""

""I think you're fond of him,"" said Ralph with a certain shy pleasure in his face. ""You appreciate him, which all the world hasn't done. The quality's too fine.""




""I quite adore him,"" Isabel after a moment said.




""That's very well. After his son he's your greatest admirer."" She welcomed this assurance, but she gave secretly a small sigh of relief at the thought that Mr. Touchett was one of those admirers who couldn't propose to marry her. This, however, was not what she spoke; she went on to inform Ralph that there were other reasons for her not remaining in London. She was tired of it and wished to leave it; and then Henrietta was going away—going to stay in Bedfordshire.




""In Bedfordshire?""




""With Lady Pensil, the sister of Mr. Bantling, who has answered for an invitation.""




Ralph was feeling anxious, but at this he broke into a laugh. Suddenly, none the less, his gravity returned. ""Bantling's a man of courage. But if the invitation should get lost on the way?""




""I thought the British post-office was impeccable.""




""The good Homer sometimes nods,"" said Ralph. ""However,"" he went on more brightly, ""the good Bantling never does, and, whatever happens, he'll take care of Henrietta.""




Ralph went to keep his appointment with Sir Matthew Hope, and Isabel made her arrangements for quitting Pratt's Hotel. Her uncle's danger touched her nearly, and while she stood before her open trunk, looking about her vaguely for what she should put into it, the tears suddenly rose to her eyes. It was perhaps for this reason that when Ralph came back at two o'clock to take her to the station she was not yet ready. He found Miss Stackpole, however, in the sitting-room, where she had just risen from her luncheon, and this lady immediately expressed her regret at his father's illness.




""He's a grand old man,"" she said; ""he's faithful to the last. If it's really to be the last—pardon my alluding to it, but you must often have thought of the possibility—I'm sorry that I shall not be at Gardencourt.""




""You'll amuse yourself much more in Bedfordshire.""




""I shall be sorry to amuse myself at such a time,"" said Henrietta with much propriety. But she immediately added: ""I should like so to commemorate the closing scene.""




""My father may live a long time,"" said Ralph simply. Then, adverting to topics more cheerful, he interrogated Miss Stackpole as to her own future.




Now that Ralph was in trouble she addressed him in a tone of larger allowance and told him that she was much indebted to him for having made her acquainted with Mr. Bantling. ""He has told me just the things I want to know,"" she said; ""all the society items and all about the royal family. I can't make out that what he tells me about the royal family is much to their credit; but he says that's only my peculiar way of looking at it. Well, all I want is that he should give me the facts; I can put them together quick enough, once I've got them."" And she added that Mr. Bantling had been so good as to promise to come and take her out that afternoon.




""To take you where?"" Ralph ventured to enquire.




""To Buckingham Palace. He's going to show me over it, so that I may get some idea how they live.""




""Ah,"" said Ralph, ""we leave you in good hands. The first thing we shall hear is that you're invited to Windsor Castle.""




""If they ask me, I shall certainly go. Once I get started I'm not afraid. But for all that,"" Henrietta added in a moment, ""I'm not satisfied; I'm not at peace about Isabel.""




""What is her last misdemeanour?""




""Well, I've told you before, and I suppose there's no harm in my going on. I always finish a subject that I take up. Mr. Goodwood was here last night.""




Ralph opened his eyes; he even blushed a little—his blush being the sign of an emotion somewhat acute. He remembered that Isabel, in separating from him in Winchester Square, had repudiated his suggestion that her motive in doing so was the expectation of a visitor at Pratt's Hotel, and it was a new pang to him to have to suspect her of duplicity. On the other hand, he quickly said to himself, what concern was it of his that she should have made an appointment with a lover? Had it not been thought graceful in every age that young ladies should make a mystery of such appointments? Ralph gave Miss Stackpole a diplomatic answer. ""I should have thought that, with the views you expressed to me the other day, this would satisfy you perfectly.""




""That he should come to see her? That was very well, as far as it went. It was a little plot of mine; I let him know that we were in London, and when it had been arranged that I should spend the evening out I sent him a word—the word we just utter to the 'wise.' I hoped he would find her alone; I won't pretend I didn't hope that you'd be out of the way. He came to see her, but he might as well have stayed away.""




""Isabel was cruel?""—and Ralph's face lighted with the relief of his cousin's not having shown duplicity.




""I don't exactly know what passed between them. But she gave him no satisfaction—she sent him back to America.""




""Poor Mr. Goodwood!"" Ralph sighed.




""Her only idea seems to be to get rid of him,"" Henrietta went on.




""Poor Mr. Goodwood!"" Ralph repeated. The exclamation, it must be confessed, was automatic; it failed exactly to express his thoughts, which were taking another line.




""You don't say that as if you felt it. I don't believe you care.""




""Ah,"" said Ralph, ""you must remember that I don't know this interesting young man—that I've never seen him.""




""Well, I shall see him, and I shall tell him not to give up. If I didn't believe Isabel would come round,"" Miss Stackpole added—""well, I'd give up myself. I mean I'd give her  up!"""|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"
"ap 05:00"|"five o'clock"|"It had occurred to Ralph that, in the conditions, Isabel's parting with her friend might be of a slightly embarrassed nature, and he went down to the door of the hotel in advance of his cousin, who, after a slight delay, followed with the traces of an unaccepted remonstrance, as he thought, in her eyes. The two made the journey to Gardencourt in almost unbroken silence, and the servant who met them at the station had no better news to give them of Mr. Touchett—a fact which caused Ralph to congratulate himself afresh on Sir Matthew Hope's having promised to come down in the five o'clock train and spend the night. Mrs. Touchett, he learned, on reaching home, had been constantly with the old man and was with him at that moment; and this fact made Ralph say to himself that, after all, what his mother wanted was just easy occasion. The finer natures were those that shone at the larger times. Isabel went to her own room, noting throughout the house that perceptible hush which precedes a crisis. At the end of an hour, however, she came down stairs in search of her aunt, whom she wished to ask about Mr. Touchett. She went into the library, but Mrs. Touchett was not there, and as the weather, which had been damp and chill, was now altogether spoiled, it was not probable she had gone for her usual walk in the grounds. Isabel was on the point of ringing to send a question to her room, when this purpose quickly yielded to an unexpected sound—the sound of low music proceeding apparently from the saloon. She knew her aunt never touched the piano, and the musician was therefore probably Ralph, who played for his own amusement. That he should have resorted to this recreation at the present time indicated apparently that his anxiety about his father had been relieved; so that the girl took her way, almost with restored cheer, toward the source of the harmony. The drawing-room at Gardencourt was an apartment of great distances, and, as the piano was placed at the end of it furthest removed from the door at which she entered, her arrival was not noticed by the person seated before the instrument. This person was neither Ralph nor his mother; it was a lady whom Isabel immediately saw to be a stranger to herself, though her back was presented to the door. This back—an ample and well-dressed one—Isabel viewed for some moments with surprise. The lady was of course a visitor who had arrived during her absence and who had not been mentioned by either of the servants—one of them her aunt's maid—of whom she had had speech since her return. Isabel had already learned, however, with what treasures of reserve the function of receiving orders may be accompanied, and she was particularly conscious of having been treated with dryness by her aunt's maid, through whose hands she had slipped perhaps a little too mistrustfully and with an effect of plumage but the more lustrous. The advent of a guest was in itself far from disconcerting; she had not yet divested herself of a young faith that each new acquaintance would exert some momentous influence on her life. By the time she had made these reflexions she became aware that the lady at the piano played remarkably well. She was playing something of Schubert's—Isabel knew not what, but recognised Schubert—and she touched the piano with a discretion of her own. It showed skill, it showed feeling; Isabel sat down noiselessly on the nearest chair and waited till the end of the piece. When it was finished she felt a strong desire to thank the player, and rose from her seat to do so, while at the same time the stranger turned quickly round, as if but just aware of her presence.




""That's very beautiful, and your playing makes it more beautiful still,"" said Isabel with all the young radiance with which she usually uttered a truthful rapture.




""You don't think I disturbed Mr. Touchett then?"" the musician answered as sweetly as this compliment deserved. ""The house is so large and his room so far away that I thought I might venture, especially as I played just—just du bout des doigts.""




""She's a Frenchwoman,"" Isabel said to herself; ""she says that as if she were French."" And this supposition made the visitor more interesting to our speculative heroine. ""I hope my uncle's doing well,"" Isabel added. ""I should think that to hear such lovely music as that would really make him feel better.""




The lady smiled and discriminated. ""I'm afraid there are moments in life when even Schubert has nothing to say to us. We must admit, however, that they are our worst.""




""I'm not in that state now then,"" said Isabel. ""On the contrary I should be so glad if you would play something more.""




""If it will give you pleasure—delighted."" And this obliging person took her place again and struck a few chords, while Isabel sat down nearer the instrument. Suddenly the new-comer stopped with her hands on the keys, half-turning and looking over her shoulder. She was forty years old and not pretty, though her expression charmed. ""Pardon me,"" she said; ""but are you the niece —the young American?""




""I'm my aunt's niece,"" Isabel replied with simplicity.




The lady at the piano sat still a moment longer, casting her air of interest over her shoulder. ""That's very well; we're compatriots."" And then she began to play.




""Ah then she's not French,"" Isabel murmured; and as the opposite supposition had made her romantic it might have seemed that this revelation would have marked a drop. But such was not the fact; rarer even than to be French seemed it to be American on such interesting terms.




The lady played in the same manner as before, softly and solemnly, and while she played the shadows deepened in the room. The autumn twilight gathered in, and from her place Isabel could see the rain, which had now begun in earnest, washing the cold-looking lawn and the wind shaking the great trees. At last, when the music had ceased, her companion got up and, coming nearer with a smile, before Isabel had time to thank her again, said: ""I'm very glad you've come back; I've heard a great deal about you.""




Isabel thought her a very attractive person, but nevertheless spoke with a certain abruptness in reply to this speech. ""From whom have you heard about me?""




The stranger hesitated a single moment and then, ""From your uncle,"" she answered. ""I've been here three days, and the first day he let me come and pay him a visit in his room. Then he talked constantly of you.""




""As you didn't know me that must rather have bored you.""




""It made me want to know you. All the more that since then—your aunt being so much with Mr. Touchett—I've been quite alone and have got rather tired of my own society. I've not chosen a good moment for my visit.""




A servant had come in with lamps and was presently followed by another bearing the tea-tray. On the appearance of this repast Mrs. Touchett had apparently been notified, for she now arrived and addressed herself to the tea-pot. Her greeting to her niece did not differ materially from her manner of raising the lid of this receptacle in order to glance at the contents: in neither act was it becoming to make a show of avidity. Questioned about her husband she was unable to say he was better; but the local doctor was with him, and much light was expected from this gentleman's consultation with Sir Matthew Hope.




""I suppose you two ladies have made acquaintance,"" she pursued. ""If you haven't I recommend you to do so; for so long as we continue—Ralph and I—to cluster about Mr. Touchett's bed you're not likely to have much society but each other.""




""I know nothing about you but that you're a great musician,"" Isabel said to the visitor.




""There's a good deal more than that to know,"" Mrs. Touchett affirmed in her little dry tone.




""A very little of it, I am sure, will content Miss Archer!"" the lady exclaimed with a light laugh. ""I'm an old friend of your aunt's. I've lived much in Florence. I'm Madame Merle."" She made this last announcement as if she were referring to a person of tolerably distinct identity. For Isabel, however, it represented little; she could only continue to feel that Madame Merle had as charming a manner as any she had ever encountered.




""She's not a foreigner in spite of her name,"" said Mrs. Touchett.




""She was born—I always forget where you were born.""




""It's hardly worth while then I should tell you.""




""On the contrary,"" said Mrs. Touchett, who rarely missed a logical point; ""if I remembered your telling me would be quite superfluous.""




Madame Merle glanced at Isabel with a sort of world-wide smile, a thing that over-reached frontiers. ""I was born under the shadow of the national banner.""




""She's too fond of mystery,"" said Mrs. Touchett; ""that's her great fault.""




""Ah,"" exclaimed Madame Merle, ""I've great faults, but I don't think that's one of then; it certainly isn't the greatest. I came into the world in the Brooklyn navy-yard. My father was a high officer in the United States Navy, and had a post—a post of responsibility—in that establishment at the time. I suppose I ought to love the sea, but I hate it. That's why I don't return to America. I love the land; the great thing is to love something.""




Isabel, as a dispassionate witness, had not been struck with the force of Mrs. Touchett's characterisation of her visitor, who had an expressive, communicative, responsive face, by no means of the sort which, to Isabel's mind, suggested a secretive disposition. It was a face that told of an amplitude of nature and of quick and free motions and, though it had no regular beauty, was in the highest degree engaging and attaching. Madame Merle was a tall, fair, smooth woman; everything in her person was round and replete, though without those accumulations which suggest heaviness. Her features were thick but in perfect proportion and harmony, and her complexion had a healthy clearness. Her grey eyes were small but full of light and incapable of stupidity—incapable, according to some people, even of tears; she had a liberal, full-rimmed mouth which when she smiled drew itself upward to the left side in a manner that most people thought very odd, some very affected and a few very graceful. Isabel inclined to range herself in the last category. Madame Merle had thick, fair hair, arranged somehow ""classically"" and as if she were a Bust, Isabel judged—a Juno or a Niobe; and large white hands, of a perfect shape, a shape so perfect that their possessor, preferring to leave them unadorned, wore no jewelled rings. Isabel had taken her at first, as we have seen, for a Frenchwoman; but extended observation might have ranked her as a German—a German of high degree, perhaps an Austrian, a baroness, a countess, a princess. It would never have been supposed she had come into the world in Brooklyn—though one could doubtless not have carried through any argument that the air of distinction marking her in so eminent a degree was inconsistent with such a birth. It was true that the national banner had floated immediately over her cradle, and the breezy freedom of the stars and stripes might have shed an influence upon the attitude she there took towards life. And yet she had evidently nothing of the fluttered, flapping quality of a morsel of bunting in the wind; her manner expressed the repose and confidence which come from a large experience. Experience, however, had not quenched her youth; it had simply made her sympathetic and supple. She was in a word a woman of strong impulses kept in admirable order. This commended itself to Isabel as an ideal combination.




The girl made these reflexions while the three ladies sat at their tea, but that ceremony was interrupted before long by the arrival of the great doctor from London, who had been immediately ushered into the drawing-room. Mrs. Touchett took him off to the library for a private talk; and then Madame Merle and Isabel parted, to meet again at dinner. The idea of seeing more of this interesting woman did much to mitigate Isabel's sense of the sadness now settling on Gardencourt.




When she came into the drawing-room before dinner she found the place empty; but in the course of a mo ment Ralph arrived. His anxiety about his father had been lightened; Sir Matthew Hope's view of his condition was less depressed than his own had been. The doctor recommended that the nurse alone should remain with the old man for the next three or four hours; so that Ralph, his mother and the great physician himself were free to dine at table. Mrs. Touchett and Sir Matthew appeared; Madame Merle was the last.




Before she came Isabel spoke of her to Ralph, who was standing before the fireplace. ""Pray who is this Madame Merle?""




""The cleverest woman I know, not excepting yourself,"" said Ralph.




""I thought she seemed very pleasant.""




""I was sure you'd think her very pleasant.""




""Is that why you invited her?""




""I didn't invite her, and when we came back from London I didn't know she was here. No one invited her. She's a friend of my mother's, and just after you and I went to town my mother got a note from her. She had arrived in England (she usually lives abroad, though she has first and last spent a good deal of time here), and asked leave to come down for a few days. She's a woman who can make such proposals with perfect confidence; she's so welcome wherever she goes. And with my mother there could be no question of hesitating; she's the one person in the world whom my mother very much admires. If she were not herself (which she after all much prefers), she would like to be Madame Merle. It would indeed be a great change.""




""Well, she's very charming,"" said Isabel. ""And she plays beautifully.""




""She does everything beautifully. She's complete.""




Isabel looked at her cousin a moment. ""You don't like her.""




""On the contrary, I was once in love with her.""




""And she didn't care for you, and that's why you don't like her.""




""How can we have discussed such things? Monsieur Merle was then living.""




""Is he dead now?""




""So she says.""




""Don't you believe her?""




""Yes, because the statement agrees with the probabilities. The husband of Madame Merle would be likely to pass away.""




Isabel gazed at her cousin again. ""I don't know what you mean. You mean something—that you don't mean. What was Monsieur Merle?""




""The husband of Madame.""




""You're very odious. Has she any children?""




""Not the least little child—fortunately.""




""Fortunately?""




""I mean fortunately for the child. She'd be sure to spoil it.""




Isabel was apparently on the point of assuring her cousin for the third time that he was odious; but the discussion was interrupted by the arrival of the lady who was the topic of it. She came rustling in quickly, apologising for being late, fastening a bracelet, dressed in dark blue satin, which exposed a white bosom that was ineffectually covered by a curious silver necklace. Ralph offered her his arm with the exaggerated alertness of a man who was no longer a lover.




Even if this had still been his condition, however, Ralph had other things to think about. The great doctor spent the night at Gardencourt and, returning to London on the morrow, after another consultation with Mr. Touchett's own medical adviser, concurred in Ralph's desire that he should see the patient again on the day following. On the day following Sir Matthew Hope reappeared at Gardencourt, and now took a less encouraging view of the old man, who had grown worse in the twenty-four hours. His feebleness was extreme, and to his son, who constantly sat by his bedside, it often seemed that his end must be at hand. The local doctor, a very sagacious man, in whom Ralph had secretly more confidence than in his distinguished colleague, was constantly in attendance, and Sir Matthew Hope came back several times. Mr. Touchett was much of the time unconscious; he slept a great deal; he rarely spoke. Isabel had a great desire to be useful to him and was allowed to watch with him at hours when his other attendants (of whom Mrs. Touchett was not the least regular) went to take rest. He never seemed to know her, and she always said to herself ""Sup pose he should die while I'm sitting here;"" an idea which excited her and kept her awake. Once he opened his eyes for a while and fixed them upon her intelligently, but when she went to him, hoping he would recognise her, he closed them and relapsed into stupor. The day after this, however, he revived for a longer time; but on this occasion Ralph only was with him. The old man began to talk, much to his son's satisfaction, who assured him that they should presently have him sitting up.




""No, my boy,"" said Mr. Touchett, ""not unless you bury me in a sitting posture, as some of the ancients—was it the ancients?—used to do.""




""Ah, daddy, don't talk about that,"" Ralph murmured. ""You mustn't deny that you're getting better.""




""There will be no need of my denying it if you don't say it,"" the old man answered. ""Why should we prevaricate just at the last? We never prevaricated before. I've got to die some time, and it's better to die when one's sick than when one's well. I'm very sick —as sick as I shall ever be. I hope you don't want to prove that I shall ever be worse than this? That would be too bad. You don't? Well then.""




Having made this excellent point he became quiet; but the next time that Ralph was with him he again addressed himself to conversation. The nurse had gone to her supper and Ralph was alone in charge, having just relieved Mrs. Touchett, who had been on guard since dinner. The room was lighted only by the flickering fire, which of late had become necessary, and Ralph's tall shadow was projected over wall and ceiling with an outline constantly varying but always grotesque.




""Who's that with me—is it my son?"" the old man asked.




""Yes, it's your son, daddy.""




""And is there no one else?""




""No one else.""




Mr. Touchett said nothing for a while; and then, ""I want to talk a little,"" he went on.




""Won't it tire you?"" Ralph demurred.




""It won't matter if it does. I shall have a long rest. I want to talk about you."""|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"As Mrs. Touchett had foretold, Isabel and Madame Merle were thrown much together during the illness of their host, so that if they had not become intimate it would have been almost a breach of good manners. Their manners were of the best, but in addition to this they happened to please each other. It is perhaps too much to say that they swore an eternal friendship, but tacitly at least they called the future to witness. Isabel did so with a perfectly good conscience, though she would have hesitated to admit she was intimate with her new friend in the high sense she privately attached to this term. She often wondered indeed if she ever had been, or ever could be, intimate with any one. She had an ideal of friendship as well as of several other sentiments, which it failed to seem to her in this case—it had not seemed to her in other cases—that the actual completely expressed. But she often reminded herself that there were essential reasons why one's ideal could never become concrete. It was a thing to believe in, not to see—a matter of faith, not of experience. Experience, however, might supply us with very creditable imitations of it, and the part of wisdom was to make the best of these. Certainly, on the whole, Isabel had never encountered a more agreeable and interesting figure than Madame Merle; she had never met a person having less of that fault which is the principal obstacle to friendship—the air of reproducing the more tiresome, the stale, the too-familiar parts of one's own character. The gates of the girl's confidence were opened wider than they had ever been; she said things to this amiable auditress that she had not yet said to any one. Sometimes she took alarm at her candour: it was as if she had given to a comparative stranger the key to her cabinet of jewels. These spiritual gems were the only ones of any magnitude that Isabel possessed, but there was all the greater reason for their being carefully guarded. Afterwards, however, she always remembered that one should never regret a generous error and that if Madame Merle had not the merits she attributed to her, so much the worse for Madame Merle. There was no doubt she had great merits—she was charming, sympathetic, intelligent, cultivated. More than this (for it had not been Isabel's ill-fortune to go through life without meeting in her own sex several persons of whom no less could fairly be said), she was rare, superior and preeminent. There are many amiable people in the world, and Madame Merle was far from being vulgarly good-natured and restlessly witty. She knew how to think—an accomplishment rare in women; and she had thought to very good purpose. Of course, too, she knew how to feel; Isabel couldn't have spent a week with her without being sure of that. This was indeed Madame Merle's great talent, her most perfect gift. Life had told upon her; she had felt it strongly, and it was part of the satisfaction to be taken in her society that when the girl talked of what she was pleased to call serious matters this lady understood her so seasily and quickly. Emotion, it is true, had become with her rather historic; she made no secret of the fact that the fount of passion, thanks to having been rather violently tapped at one period, didn't flow quite so freely as of yore. She proposed moreover, as well as expected, to cease feeling; she freely admitted that of old she had been a little mad, and now she pretended to be perfectly sane.




""I judge more than I used to,"" she said to Isabel, ""but it seems to me one has earned the right. One can't judge till one's forty; before that we're too eager, too hard, too cruel, and in addition much too ignorant. I'm sorry for you; it will be a long time before you're forty. But every gain's a loss of some kind; I often think that after forty one can't really feel. The freshness, the quickness have certainly gone. You'll keep them longer than most people; it will be a great satisfaction to me to see you some years hence. I want to see what life makes of you. One thing's certain—it can't spoil you. It may pull you about horribly, but I defy it to break you up.""




Isabel received this assurance as a young soldier, still panting from a slight skirmish in which he has come off with honour, might receive a pat on the shoulder from his colonel. Like such a recognition of merit it seemed to come with authority. How could the lightest word do less on the part of a person who was prepared to say, of almost everything Isabel told her, ""Oh, I've been in that, my dear; it passes, like everything else."" On many of her interlocutors Madame Merle might have produced an irritating effect; it was disconcertingly difficult to surprise her. But Isabel, though by no means incapable of desiring to be effective, had not at present this impulse. She was too sincere, too interested in her judicious companion. And then moreover Madame Merle never said such things in the tone of triumph or of boastfulness; they dropped from her like cold confessions.




A period of bad weather had settled upon Gardencourt; the days grew shorter and there was an end to the pretty tea-parties on the lawn. But our young woman had long indoor conversations with her fellow visitor, and in spite of the rain the two ladies often sallied forth for a walk, equipped with the defensive apparatus which the English climate and the English genius have between them brought to such perfection. Madame Merle liked almost everything, including the English rain. ""There's always a little of it and never too much at once,"" she said; ""and it never wets you and it always smells good."" She declared that in England the pleasures of smell were great—that in this inimitable island there was a certain mixture of fog and beer and soot which, however odd it might sound, was the national aroma, and was most agreeable to the nostril; and she used to lift the sleeve of her British overcoat and bury her nose in it, inhaling the clear, fine scent of the wool. Poor Ralph Touchett, as soon as the autumn had begun to define itself, became almost a prisoner; in bad weather he was unable to step out of the house, and he used sometimes to stand at one of the windows with his hands in his pockets and, from a countenance half-rueful, half-critical, watch Isabel and Madame Merle as they walked down the avenue under a pair of umbrellas. The roads about Gardencourt were so firm, even in the worst weather, that the two ladies always came back with a healthy glow in their cheeks, looking at the soles of their neat, stout boots and declaring that their walk had done them inexpressible good. Before luncheon, always, Madame Merle was engaged; Isabel admired and envied her rigid possession of her morning. Our heroine had always passed for a person of resources and had taken a certain pride in being one; but she wandered, as by the wrong side of the wall of a private garden, round the enclosed talents, accomplishments, aptitudes of Madame Merle. She found herself desiring to emulate them, and in twenty such ways this lady presented herself as a model. ""I should like awfully to be so!"" Isabel secretly exclaimed, more than once, as one after another of her friend's fine aspects caught the light, and before long she knew that she had learned a lesson from a high authority. It took no great time indeed for her to feel herself, as the phrase is, under an influence. ""What's the harm,"" she wondered, ""so long as it's a good one? The more one's under a good influence the better. The only thing is to see our steps as we take them—to understand them as we go. That, no doubt, I shall always do. I needn't be afraid of becoming too pliable; isn't it my fault that I'm not pliable enough?"" It is said that imitation is the sincerest flattery; and if Isabel was sometimes moved to gape at her friend aspiringly and despairingly it was not so much because she desired herself to shine as because she wished to hold up the lamp for Madame Merle. She liked her extremely, but was even more dazzled than attracted. She sometimes asked herself what Henrietta Stackpole would say to her thinking so much of this perverted product of their common soil, and had a conviction that it would be severely judged. Henrietta would not at all subscribe to Madame Merle; for reasons she could not have defined this truth came home to the girl. On the other hand she was equally sure that, should the occasion offer, her new friend would strike off some happy view of her old: Madame Merle was too humorous, too observant, not to do justice to Henrietta, and on becoming acquainted with her would probably give the measure of a tact which Miss Stackpole couldn't hope to emulate. She appeared to have in her experience a touchstone for everything, and somewhere in the capacious pocket of her genial memory she would find the key to Henrietta's value. ""That's the great thing,"" Isabel solemnly pondered; ""that's the supreme good fortune: to be in a better position for appreciating people than they are for appreciating you."" And she added that such, when one considered it, was simply the essence of the aristocratic situation. In this light, if in none other, one should aim at the aristocratic situation.




I may not count over all the links in the chain which led Isabel to think of Madame Merle's situation as aristocratic—a view of it never expressed in any reference made to it by that lady herself. She had known great things and great people, but she had never played a great part. She was one of the small ones of the earth; she had not been born to honours; she knew the world too well to nourish fatuous illusions on the article of her own place in it. She had encountered many of the fortunate few and was perfectly aware of those points at which their fortune differed from hers. But if by her informed measure she was no figure for a high scene, she had yet to Isabel's imagination a sort of greatness. To be so cultivated and civilised, so wise and so easy, and still make so light of it—that was really to be a great lady, especially when one so carried and presented one's self. It was as if somehow she had all society under contribution, and all the arts and graces it practised—or was the effect rather that of charming uses found for her, even from a distance, subtle service rendered by her to a clamorous world wherever she might be? After breakfast she wrote a succession of letters, as those arriving for her appeared in numerable: her correspondence was a source of surprise to Isabel when they sometimes walked together to the village post-office to deposit Madame Merle's offering to the mail. She knew more people, as she told Isabel, than she knew what to do with, and something was always turning up to be written about. Of painting she was devotedly fond, and made no more of brushing in a sketch than of pulling off her gloves. At Gardencourt she was perpetually taking advantage of an hour's sunshine to go out with a camp-stool and a box of water-colours. That she was a brave musician we have already perceived, and it was evidence of the fact that when she seated herself at the piano, as she always did in the evening, her listeners resigned themselves without a murmur to losing the grace of her talk. Isabel, since she had known her, felt ashamed of her own facility, which she now looked upon as basely inferior; and indeed, though she had been thought rather a prodigy at home, the loss to society when, in taking her place upon the music-stool, she turned her back to the room, was usually deemed greater than the gain. When Madame Merle was neither writing, nor painting, nor touching the piano, she was usually employed upon wonderful tasks of rich embroidery, cushions, curtains, decorations for the chimneypiece; an art in which her bold, free invention was as noted as the agility of her needle. She was never idle, for when engaged in none of the ways I have mentioned she was either reading (she appeared to Isabel to read ""everything important""), or walking out, or playing patience with the cards, or talking with her fellow inmates. And with all this she had always the social quality, was never rudely absent and yet never too seated. She laid down her pastimes as easily as she took them up; she worked and talked at the same time, and appeared to impute scant worth to anything she did. She gave away her sketches and tapestries; she rose from the piano or remained there, according to the convenience of her auditors, which she always unerringly divined. She was in short the most comfortable, profitable, amenable person to live with. If for Isabel she had a fault it was that she was not natural; by which the girl meant, not that she was either affected or pretentious, since from these vul gar vices no woman could have been more exempt, but that her nature had been too much overlaid by custom and her angles too much rubbed away. She had become too flexible, too useful, was too ripe and too final. She was in a word too perfectly the social animal that man and woman are supposed to have been intended to be; and she had rid herself of every remnant of that tonic wildness which we may assume to have belonged even to the most amiable persons in the ages before country-house life was the fashion. Isabel found it difficult to think of her in any detachment or privacy, she existed only in her relations, direct or indirect, with her fellow mortals. One might wonder what commerce she could possibly hold with her own spirit. One always ended, however, by feeling that a charming surface doesn't necessarily prove one superficial; this was an illusion in which, in one's youth, one had but just escaped being nourished. Madame Merle was not superficial—not she. She was deep, and her nature spoke none the less in her behaviour because it spoke a conventional tongue. ""What's language at all but a convention?"" said Isabel. ""She has the good taste not to pretend, like some people I've met, to express herself by original signs.""




""I'm afraid you've suffered much,"" she once found occasion to say to her friend in response to some allusion that had appeared to reach far.




""What makes you think that?"" Madame Merle asked with the amused smile of a person seated at a game of guesses. ""I hope I haven't too much the droop of the misunderstood.""




""No; but you sometimes say things that I think people who have always been happy wouldn't have found out.""




""I haven't always been happy,"" said Madame Merle, smiling still, but with a mock gravity, as if she were telling a child a secret. ""Such a wonderful thing!""




But Isabel rose to the irony. ""A great many people give me the impression of never having for a moment felt anything.""




""It's very true; there are many more iron pots certainly than porcelain. But you may depend on it that every one bears some mark; even the hardest iron pots have a little bruise, a little hole somewhere. I flatter myself that I'm rather stout, but if I must tell you the truth I've been shockingly chipped and cracked. I do very well for service yet, because I've been cleverly mended; and I try to remain in the cupboard—the quiet, dusky cupboard where there's an odour of stale spices—as much as I can. But when I've to come out and into a strong light—then, my dear, I'm a horror!""




I know not whether it was on this occasion or on some other that the conversation had taken the turn I have just indicated she said to Isabel that she would some day a tale unfold. Isabel assured her she should delight to listen to one, and reminded her more than once of this engagement. Madame Merle, however, begged repeatedly for a respite, and at last frankly told her young companion that they must wait till they knew each other better. This would be sure to happen, a long friendship so visibly lay before them. Isabel assented, but at the same time enquired if she mightn't be trusted—if she appeared capable of a betrayal of confidence.




""It's not that I'm afraid of your repeating what I say,"" her fellow visitor answered; ""I'm afraid, on the contrary, of your taking it too much to yourself. You'd judge me too harshly; you're of the cruel age."" She preferred for the present to talk to Isabel of Isabel, and exhibited the greatest interest in our heroine's history, sentiments, opinions, prospects. She made her chatter and listened to her chatter with infinite good nature. This flattered and quickened the girl, who was struck with all the distinguished people her friend had known and with her having lived, as Mrs. Touchett said, in the best company in Europe. Isabel thought the better of herself for enjoying the favour of a person who had so large a field of comparison; and it was perhaps partly to gratify the sense of profiting by comparison that she often appealed to these stores of reminiscence. Madame Merle had been a dweller in many lands and had social ties in a dozen different countries. ""I don't pretend to be educated,"" she would say, ""but I think I know my Europe;"" and she spoke one day of going to Sweden to stay with an old friend, and another of proceeding to Malta to follow up a new acquaintance. With England, where she had often dwelt, she was thoroughly familiar, and for Isabel's benefit threw a great deal of light upon the customs of the country and the character of the people, who ""after all,"" as she was fond of saying, were the most convenient in the world to live with.




""You mustn't think it strange her remaining here at such a time as this, when Mr. Touchett's passing away,"" that gentleman's wife remarked to her niece. ""She is incapable of a mistake; she's the most tactful woman I know. It's a favour to me that she stays; she's putting off a lot of visits at great houses,"" said Mrs. Touchett, who never forgot that when she herself was in England her social value sank two or three degrees in the scale. ""She has her pick of places; she's not in want of a shelter. But I've asked her to put in this time because I wish you to know her. I think it will be a good thing for you. Serena Merle hasn't a fault.""




""If I didn't already like her very much that description might alarm me,"" Isabel returned.




""She's never the least little bit 'off.' I've brought you out here and I wish to do the best for you. Your sister Lily told me she hoped I would give you plenty of opportunities. I give you one in putting you in relation with Madame Merle. She's one of the most brilliant women in Europe.""




""I like her better than I like your description of her,"" Isabel persisted in saying.




""Do you flatter yourself that you'll ever feel her open to criticism? I hope you'll let me know when you do.""




""That will be cruel—to you,"" said Isabel.




""You needn't mind me. You won't discover a fault in her.""




""Perhaps not. But I dare say I shan't miss it.""




""She knows absolutely everything on earth there is to know,"" said Mrs. Touchett.




Isabel after this observed to their companion that she hoped she knew Mrs. Touchett considered she hadn't a speck on her perfection. On which ""I'm obliged to you,"" Madame Merle replied, ""but I'm afraid your aunt imagines, or at least alludes to, no aberrations that the clock-face doesn't register.""




""So that you mean you've a wild side that's unknown to her?""




""Ah no, I fear my darkest sides are my tamest. I mean that having no faults, for your aunt, means that one's never late for dinner —that is for her dinner. I was not late, by the way, the other day, when you came back from London; the clock was just at eight when I came into the drawing-room: it was the rest of you that were before the time. It means that one answers a letter the day one gets it and that when one comes to stay with her one doesn't bring too much luggage and is careful not to be taken ill. For Mrs. Touchett those things constitute virtue; it's a blessing to be able to reduce it to its elements.""




Madame Merle's own conversation, it will be perceived, was enriched with bold, free touches of criticism, which, even when they had a restrictive effect, never struck Isabel as ill-natured. It couldn't occur to the girl for instance that Mrs. Touchett's accomplished guest was abusing her; and this for very good reasons. In the first place Isabel rose eagerly to the sense of her shades; in the second Madame Merle implied that there was a great deal more to say; and it was clear in the third that for a person to speak to one without ceremony of one's near relations was an agreeable sign of that person's intimacy with one's self. These signs of deep communion multiplied as the days elapsed, and there was none of which Isabel was more sensible than of her companion's preference for making Miss Archer herself a topic. Though she referred frequently to the incidents of her own career she never lingered upon them; she was as little of a gross egotist as she was of a flat gossip.




""I'm old and stale and faded,"" she said more than once; ""I'm of no more interest than last week's newspaper. You're young and fresh and of to-day; you've the great thing—you've actuality. I once had it—we all have it for an hour. You, however, will have it for longer. Let us talk about you then; you can say nothing I shall not care to hear. It's a sign that I'm growing old—that I like to talk with younger people. I think it's a very pretty compensation. If we can't have youth within us we can have it outside, and I really think we see it and feel it better that way. Of course we must be in sympathy with it—that I shall always be. I don't know that I shall ever be ill-natured with old people—I hope not; there are cer tainly some old people I adore. But I shall never be anything but abject with the young; they touch me and appeal to me too much. I give you carte blanche then; you can even be impertinent if you like; I shall let it pass and horribly spoil you. I speak as if I were a hundred years old, you say? Well, I am, if you please; I was born before the French Revolution. Ah, my dear, je viens de loin; I belong to the old, old world. But it's not of that I want to talk; I want to talk about the new. You must tell me more about America; you never tell me enough. Here I've been since I was brought here as a helpless child, and it's ridiculous, or rather it's scandalous, how little I know about that splendid, dreadful, funny country—surely the greatest and drollest of them all. There are a great many of us like that in these parts, and I must say I think we're a wretched set of people. You should live in your own land; whatever it may be you have your natural place there. If we're not good Americans we're certainly poor Europeans; we've no natural place here. We're mere parasites, crawling over the surface; we haven't our feet in the soil. At least one can know it and not have illusions. A woman perhaps can get on; a woman, it seems to me, has no natural place anywhere; wherever she finds herself she has to remain on the surface and, more or less, to crawl. You protest, my dear? you're horrified? you declare you'll never crawl? It's very true that I don't see you crawling; you stand more upright than a good many poor creatures. Very good; on the whole, I don't think you'll crawl. But the men, the Americans; je vous demande un peu, what do they make of it over here? I don't envy them trying to arrange themselves. Look at poor Ralph Touchett: what sort of a figure do you call that? Fortunately he has a consumption; I say fortunately, because it gives him something to do. His consumption's his carriere it's a kind of position. You can say: 'Oh, Mr. Touchett, he takes care of his lungs, he knows a great deal about climates.' But without that who would he be, what would he represent? 'Mr. Ralph Touchett: an American who lives in Europe.' That signifies absolutely nothing—it's impossible anything should signify less. 'He's very cultivated,' they say: 'he has a very pretty collection of old snuff-boxes.' The collection is all that's wanted to make it pitiful. I'm tired of the sound of the word; I think it's grotesque. With the poor old father it's different; he has his identity, and it's rather a massive one. He represents a great financial house, and that, in our day, is as good as anything else. For an American, at any rate, that will do very well. But I persist in thinking your cousin very lucky to have a chronic malady so long as he doesn't die of it. It's much better than the snuffboxes. If he weren't ill, you say, he'd do something?—he'd take his father's place in the house. My poor child, I doubt it; I don't think he's at all fond of the house. However, you know him better than I, though I used to know him rather well, and he may have the benefit of the doubt. The worst case, I think, is a friend of mine, a countryman of ours, who lives in Italy (where he also was brought before he knew better), and who is one of the most delightful men I know. Some day you must know him. I'll bring you together and then you'll see what I mean. He's Gilbert Osmond—he lives in Italy; that's all one can say about him or make of him. He's exceedingly clever, a man made to be distinguished; but, as I tell you, you exhaust the description when you say he's Mr. Osmond who lives tout betement in Italy. No career, no name, no position, no fortune, no past, no future, no anything. Oh yes, he paints, if you please—paints in water-colours; like me, only better than I. His painting's pretty bad; on the whole I'm rather glad of that. Fortunately he's very indolent, so indolent that it amounts to a sort of position. He can say, 'Oh, I do nothing; I'm too deadly lazy. You can do nothing to-day unless you get up at five o'clock in the morning.' In that way he becomes a sort of exception; you feel he might do something if he'd only rise early. He never speaks of his painting to people at large; he's too clever for that. But he has a little girl—a dear little girl; he does speak of her. He's devoted to her, and if it were a career to be an excellent father he'd be very distinguished. But I'm afraid that's no better than the snuff-boxes; perhaps not even so good. Tell me what they do in America,"" pursued Madame Merle, who, it must be observed parenthetically, did not deliver herself all at once of these reflexions, which are presented in a cluster for the convenience of the reader. She talked of Florence, where Mr. Osmond lived and where Mrs. Touchett occupied a medieval palace; she talked of Rome, where she herself had a little pied-a-terre with some rather good old damask. She talked of places, of people and even, as the phrase is, of ""subjects""; and from time to time she talked of their kind old host and of the prospect of his recovery. From the first she had thought this prospect small, and Isabel had been struck with the positive, discriminating, competent way in which she took the measure of his remainder of life. One evening she announced definitely that he wouldn't live.




""Sir Matthew Hope told me so as plainly as was proper,"" she said; ""standing there, near the fire, before dinner. He makes himself very agreeable, the great doctor. I don't mean his saying that has anything to do with it. But he says such things with great tact. I had told him I felt ill at my ease, staying here at such a time; it seemed to me so indiscreet—it wasn't as if I could nurse. 'You must remain, you must remain,' he answered; 'your office will come later.' Wasn't that a very delicate way of saying both that poor Mr. Touchett would go and that I might be of some use as a consoler? In fact, however, I shall not be of the slightest use. Your aunt will console herself; she, and she alone, knows just how much consolation she'll require. It would be a very delicate matter for another person to undertake to administer the dose. With your cousin it will be different; he'll miss his father immensely. But I should never presume to condole with Mr. Ralph; we're not on those terms."" Madame Merle had alluded more than once to some undefined incongruity in her relations with Ralph Touchett; so Isabel took this occasion of asking her if they were not good friends.




""Perfectly, but he doesn't like me.""




""What have you done to him?""




""Nothing whatever. But one has no need of a reason for that.""




""For not liking you? I think one has need of a very good reason.""




""You're very kind. Be sure you have one ready for the day you begin.""




""Begin to dislike you? I shall never begin.""




""I hope not; because if you do you'll never end. That's the way with your cousin; he doesn't get over it. It's an antipathy of nature—if I can call it that when it's all on his side. I've nothing whatever against him and don't bear him the least little grudge for not doing me justice. Justice is all I want. However, one feels that he's a gentleman and would never say anything underhand about one. Cartes sur table,"" Madame Merle subjoined in a moment, ""I'm not afraid of him.""




""I hope not indeed,"" said Isabel, who added something about his being the kindest creature living. She remembered, however, that on her first asking him about Madame Merle he had answered her in a manner which this lady might have thought injurious without being explicit. There was something between them, Isabel said to herself, but she said nothing more than this. If it were something of importance it should inspire respect; if it were not it was not worth her curiosity. With all her love of knowledge she had a natural shrinking from raising curtains and looking into unlighted corners. The love of knowledge coexisted in her mind with the finest capacity for ignorance.




But Madame Merle sometimes said things that startled her, made her raise her clear eyebrows at the time and think of the words afterwards. ""I'd give a great deal to be your age again,"" she broke out once with a bitterness which, though diluted in her customary amplitude of ease, was imperfectly disguised by it. ""If I could only begin again—if I could have my life before me!""




""Your life's before you yet,"" Isabel answered gently, for she was vaguely awe-struck.




""No; the best part's gone, and gone for nothing.""




""Surely not for nothing,"" said Isabel.




""Why not—what have I got? Neither husband, nor child, nor fortune, nor position, nor the traces of a beauty that I never had.""




""You have many friends, dear lady.""




""I'm not so sure!"" cried Madame Merle.




""Ah, you're wrong. You have memories, graces, talents—""




But Madame Merle interrupted her. ""What have my talents brought me? Nothing but the need of using them still, to get through the hours, the years, to cheat myself with some pretence of movement, of unconsciousness. As for my graces and memories the less said about them the better. You'll be my friend till you find a better use for your friendship.""




""It will be for you to see that I don't then,"" said Isabel.




""Yes; I would make an effort to keep you."" And her companion looked at her gravely. ""When I say I should like to be your age I mean with your qualities—frank, generous, sincere like you. In that case I should have made something better of my life.""




""What should you have liked to do that you've not done?""




Madame Merle took a sheet of music—she was seated at the piano and had abruptly wheeled about on the stool when she first spoke —and mechanically turned the leaves. ""I'm very ambitious!"" she at last replied.




""And your ambitions have not been satisfied? They must have been great.""




""They were  great. I should make myself ridiculous by talking of them."""|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"
05:00|"five o'clock in the morning"|"As Mrs. Touchett had foretold, Isabel and Madame Merle were thrown much together during the illness of their host, so that if they had not become intimate it would have been almost a breach of good manners. Their manners were of the best, but in addition to this they happened to please each other. It is perhaps too much to say that they swore an eternal friendship, but tacitly at least they called the future to witness. Isabel did so with a perfectly good conscience, though she would have hesitated to admit she was intimate with her new friend in the high sense she privately attached to this term. She often wondered indeed if she ever had been, or ever could be, intimate with any one. She had an ideal of friendship as well as of several other sentiments, which it failed to seem to her in this case—it had not seemed to her in other cases—that the actual completely expressed. But she often reminded herself that there were essential reasons why one's ideal could never become concrete. It was a thing to believe in, not to see—a matter of faith, not of experience. Experience, however, might supply us with very creditable imitations of it, and the part of wisdom was to make the best of these. Certainly, on the whole, Isabel had never encountered a more agreeable and interesting figure than Madame Merle; she had never met a person having less of that fault which is the principal obstacle to friendship—the air of reproducing the more tiresome, the stale, the too-familiar parts of one's own character. The gates of the girl's confidence were opened wider than they had ever been; she said things to this amiable auditress that she had not yet said to any one. Sometimes she took alarm at her candour: it was as if she had given to a comparative stranger the key to her cabinet of jewels. These spiritual gems were the only ones of any magnitude that Isabel possessed, but there was all the greater reason for their being carefully guarded. Afterwards, however, she always remembered that one should never regret a generous error and that if Madame Merle had not the merits she attributed to her, so much the worse for Madame Merle. There was no doubt she had great merits—she was charming, sympathetic, intelligent, cultivated. More than this (for it had not been Isabel's ill-fortune to go through life without meeting in her own sex several persons of whom no less could fairly be said), she was rare, superior and preeminent. There are many amiable people in the world, and Madame Merle was far from being vulgarly good-natured and restlessly witty. She knew how to think—an accomplishment rare in women; and she had thought to very good purpose. Of course, too, she knew how to feel; Isabel couldn't have spent a week with her without being sure of that. This was indeed Madame Merle's great talent, her most perfect gift. Life had told upon her; she had felt it strongly, and it was part of the satisfaction to be taken in her society that when the girl talked of what she was pleased to call serious matters this lady understood her so seasily and quickly. Emotion, it is true, had become with her rather historic; she made no secret of the fact that the fount of passion, thanks to having been rather violently tapped at one period, didn't flow quite so freely as of yore. She proposed moreover, as well as expected, to cease feeling; she freely admitted that of old she had been a little mad, and now she pretended to be perfectly sane.




""I judge more than I used to,"" she said to Isabel, ""but it seems to me one has earned the right. One can't judge till one's forty; before that we're too eager, too hard, too cruel, and in addition much too ignorant. I'm sorry for you; it will be a long time before you're forty. But every gain's a loss of some kind; I often think that after forty one can't really feel. The freshness, the quickness have certainly gone. You'll keep them longer than most people; it will be a great satisfaction to me to see you some years hence. I want to see what life makes of you. One thing's certain—it can't spoil you. It may pull you about horribly, but I defy it to break you up.""




Isabel received this assurance as a young soldier, still panting from a slight skirmish in which he has come off with honour, might receive a pat on the shoulder from his colonel. Like such a recognition of merit it seemed to come with authority. How could the lightest word do less on the part of a person who was prepared to say, of almost everything Isabel told her, ""Oh, I've been in that, my dear; it passes, like everything else."" On many of her interlocutors Madame Merle might have produced an irritating effect; it was disconcertingly difficult to surprise her. But Isabel, though by no means incapable of desiring to be effective, had not at present this impulse. She was too sincere, too interested in her judicious companion. And then moreover Madame Merle never said such things in the tone of triumph or of boastfulness; they dropped from her like cold confessions.




A period of bad weather had settled upon Gardencourt; the days grew shorter and there was an end to the pretty tea-parties on the lawn. But our young woman had long indoor conversations with her fellow visitor, and in spite of the rain the two ladies often sallied forth for a walk, equipped with the defensive apparatus which the English climate and the English genius have between them brought to such perfection. Madame Merle liked almost everything, including the English rain. ""There's always a little of it and never too much at once,"" she said; ""and it never wets you and it always smells good."" She declared that in England the pleasures of smell were great—that in this inimitable island there was a certain mixture of fog and beer and soot which, however odd it might sound, was the national aroma, and was most agreeable to the nostril; and she used to lift the sleeve of her British overcoat and bury her nose in it, inhaling the clear, fine scent of the wool. Poor Ralph Touchett, as soon as the autumn had begun to define itself, became almost a prisoner; in bad weather he was unable to step out of the house, and he used sometimes to stand at one of the windows with his hands in his pockets and, from a countenance half-rueful, half-critical, watch Isabel and Madame Merle as they walked down the avenue under a pair of umbrellas. The roads about Gardencourt were so firm, even in the worst weather, that the two ladies always came back with a healthy glow in their cheeks, looking at the soles of their neat, stout boots and declaring that their walk had done them inexpressible good. Before luncheon, always, Madame Merle was engaged; Isabel admired and envied her rigid possession of her morning. Our heroine had always passed for a person of resources and had taken a certain pride in being one; but she wandered, as by the wrong side of the wall of a private garden, round the enclosed talents, accomplishments, aptitudes of Madame Merle. She found herself desiring to emulate them, and in twenty such ways this lady presented herself as a model. ""I should like awfully to be so!"" Isabel secretly exclaimed, more than once, as one after another of her friend's fine aspects caught the light, and before long she knew that she had learned a lesson from a high authority. It took no great time indeed for her to feel herself, as the phrase is, under an influence. ""What's the harm,"" she wondered, ""so long as it's a good one? The more one's under a good influence the better. The only thing is to see our steps as we take them—to understand them as we go. That, no doubt, I shall always do. I needn't be afraid of becoming too pliable; isn't it my fault that I'm not pliable enough?"" It is said that imitation is the sincerest flattery; and if Isabel was sometimes moved to gape at her friend aspiringly and despairingly it was not so much because she desired herself to shine as because she wished to hold up the lamp for Madame Merle. She liked her extremely, but was even more dazzled than attracted. She sometimes asked herself what Henrietta Stackpole would say to her thinking so much of this perverted product of their common soil, and had a conviction that it would be severely judged. Henrietta would not at all subscribe to Madame Merle; for reasons she could not have defined this truth came home to the girl. On the other hand she was equally sure that, should the occasion offer, her new friend would strike off some happy view of her old: Madame Merle was too humorous, too observant, not to do justice to Henrietta, and on becoming acquainted with her would probably give the measure of a tact which Miss Stackpole couldn't hope to emulate. She appeared to have in her experience a touchstone for everything, and somewhere in the capacious pocket of her genial memory she would find the key to Henrietta's value. ""That's the great thing,"" Isabel solemnly pondered; ""that's the supreme good fortune: to be in a better position for appreciating people than they are for appreciating you."" And she added that such, when one considered it, was simply the essence of the aristocratic situation. In this light, if in none other, one should aim at the aristocratic situation.




I may not count over all the links in the chain which led Isabel to think of Madame Merle's situation as aristocratic—a view of it never expressed in any reference made to it by that lady herself. She had known great things and great people, but she had never played a great part. She was one of the small ones of the earth; she had not been born to honours; she knew the world too well to nourish fatuous illusions on the article of her own place in it. She had encountered many of the fortunate few and was perfectly aware of those points at which their fortune differed from hers. But if by her informed measure she was no figure for a high scene, she had yet to Isabel's imagination a sort of greatness. To be so cultivated and civilised, so wise and so easy, and still make so light of it—that was really to be a great lady, especially when one so carried and presented one's self. It was as if somehow she had all society under contribution, and all the arts and graces it practised—or was the effect rather that of charming uses found for her, even from a distance, subtle service rendered by her to a clamorous world wherever she might be? After breakfast she wrote a succession of letters, as those arriving for her appeared in numerable: her correspondence was a source of surprise to Isabel when they sometimes walked together to the village post-office to deposit Madame Merle's offering to the mail. She knew more people, as she told Isabel, than she knew what to do with, and something was always turning up to be written about. Of painting she was devotedly fond, and made no more of brushing in a sketch than of pulling off her gloves. At Gardencourt she was perpetually taking advantage of an hour's sunshine to go out with a camp-stool and a box of water-colours. That she was a brave musician we have already perceived, and it was evidence of the fact that when she seated herself at the piano, as she always did in the evening, her listeners resigned themselves without a murmur to losing the grace of her talk. Isabel, since she had known her, felt ashamed of her own facility, which she now looked upon as basely inferior; and indeed, though she had been thought rather a prodigy at home, the loss to society when, in taking her place upon the music-stool, she turned her back to the room, was usually deemed greater than the gain. When Madame Merle was neither writing, nor painting, nor touching the piano, she was usually employed upon wonderful tasks of rich embroidery, cushions, curtains, decorations for the chimneypiece; an art in which her bold, free invention was as noted as the agility of her needle. She was never idle, for when engaged in none of the ways I have mentioned she was either reading (she appeared to Isabel to read ""everything important""), or walking out, or playing patience with the cards, or talking with her fellow inmates. And with all this she had always the social quality, was never rudely absent and yet never too seated. She laid down her pastimes as easily as she took them up; she worked and talked at the same time, and appeared to impute scant worth to anything she did. She gave away her sketches and tapestries; she rose from the piano or remained there, according to the convenience of her auditors, which she always unerringly divined. She was in short the most comfortable, profitable, amenable person to live with. If for Isabel she had a fault it was that she was not natural; by which the girl meant, not that she was either affected or pretentious, since from these vul gar vices no woman could have been more exempt, but that her nature had been too much overlaid by custom and her angles too much rubbed away. She had become too flexible, too useful, was too ripe and too final. She was in a word too perfectly the social animal that man and woman are supposed to have been intended to be; and she had rid herself of every remnant of that tonic wildness which we may assume to have belonged even to the most amiable persons in the ages before country-house life was the fashion. Isabel found it difficult to think of her in any detachment or privacy, she existed only in her relations, direct or indirect, with her fellow mortals. One might wonder what commerce she could possibly hold with her own spirit. One always ended, however, by feeling that a charming surface doesn't necessarily prove one superficial; this was an illusion in which, in one's youth, one had but just escaped being nourished. Madame Merle was not superficial—not she. She was deep, and her nature spoke none the less in her behaviour because it spoke a conventional tongue. ""What's language at all but a convention?"" said Isabel. ""She has the good taste not to pretend, like some people I've met, to express herself by original signs.""




""I'm afraid you've suffered much,"" she once found occasion to say to her friend in response to some allusion that had appeared to reach far.




""What makes you think that?"" Madame Merle asked with the amused smile of a person seated at a game of guesses. ""I hope I haven't too much the droop of the misunderstood.""




""No; but you sometimes say things that I think people who have always been happy wouldn't have found out.""




""I haven't always been happy,"" said Madame Merle, smiling still, but with a mock gravity, as if she were telling a child a secret. ""Such a wonderful thing!""




But Isabel rose to the irony. ""A great many people give me the impression of never having for a moment felt anything.""




""It's very true; there are many more iron pots certainly than porcelain. But you may depend on it that every one bears some mark; even the hardest iron pots have a little bruise, a little hole somewhere. I flatter myself that I'm rather stout, but if I must tell you the truth I've been shockingly chipped and cracked. I do very well for service yet, because I've been cleverly mended; and I try to remain in the cupboard—the quiet, dusky cupboard where there's an odour of stale spices—as much as I can. But when I've to come out and into a strong light—then, my dear, I'm a horror!""




I know not whether it was on this occasion or on some other that the conversation had taken the turn I have just indicated she said to Isabel that she would some day a tale unfold. Isabel assured her she should delight to listen to one, and reminded her more than once of this engagement. Madame Merle, however, begged repeatedly for a respite, and at last frankly told her young companion that they must wait till they knew each other better. This would be sure to happen, a long friendship so visibly lay before them. Isabel assented, but at the same time enquired if she mightn't be trusted—if she appeared capable of a betrayal of confidence.




""It's not that I'm afraid of your repeating what I say,"" her fellow visitor answered; ""I'm afraid, on the contrary, of your taking it too much to yourself. You'd judge me too harshly; you're of the cruel age."" She preferred for the present to talk to Isabel of Isabel, and exhibited the greatest interest in our heroine's history, sentiments, opinions, prospects. She made her chatter and listened to her chatter with infinite good nature. This flattered and quickened the girl, who was struck with all the distinguished people her friend had known and with her having lived, as Mrs. Touchett said, in the best company in Europe. Isabel thought the better of herself for enjoying the favour of a person who had so large a field of comparison; and it was perhaps partly to gratify the sense of profiting by comparison that she often appealed to these stores of reminiscence. Madame Merle had been a dweller in many lands and had social ties in a dozen different countries. ""I don't pretend to be educated,"" she would say, ""but I think I know my Europe;"" and she spoke one day of going to Sweden to stay with an old friend, and another of proceeding to Malta to follow up a new acquaintance. With England, where she had often dwelt, she was thoroughly familiar, and for Isabel's benefit threw a great deal of light upon the customs of the country and the character of the people, who ""after all,"" as she was fond of saying, were the most convenient in the world to live with.




""You mustn't think it strange her remaining here at such a time as this, when Mr. Touchett's passing away,"" that gentleman's wife remarked to her niece. ""She is incapable of a mistake; she's the most tactful woman I know. It's a favour to me that she stays; she's putting off a lot of visits at great houses,"" said Mrs. Touchett, who never forgot that when she herself was in England her social value sank two or three degrees in the scale. ""She has her pick of places; she's not in want of a shelter. But I've asked her to put in this time because I wish you to know her. I think it will be a good thing for you. Serena Merle hasn't a fault.""




""If I didn't already like her very much that description might alarm me,"" Isabel returned.




""She's never the least little bit 'off.' I've brought you out here and I wish to do the best for you. Your sister Lily told me she hoped I would give you plenty of opportunities. I give you one in putting you in relation with Madame Merle. She's one of the most brilliant women in Europe.""




""I like her better than I like your description of her,"" Isabel persisted in saying.




""Do you flatter yourself that you'll ever feel her open to criticism? I hope you'll let me know when you do.""




""That will be cruel—to you,"" said Isabel.




""You needn't mind me. You won't discover a fault in her.""




""Perhaps not. But I dare say I shan't miss it.""




""She knows absolutely everything on earth there is to know,"" said Mrs. Touchett.




Isabel after this observed to their companion that she hoped she knew Mrs. Touchett considered she hadn't a speck on her perfection. On which ""I'm obliged to you,"" Madame Merle replied, ""but I'm afraid your aunt imagines, or at least alludes to, no aberrations that the clock-face doesn't register.""




""So that you mean you've a wild side that's unknown to her?""




""Ah no, I fear my darkest sides are my tamest. I mean that having no faults, for your aunt, means that one's never late for dinner —that is for her dinner. I was not late, by the way, the other day, when you came back from London; the clock was just at eight when I came into the drawing-room: it was the rest of you that were before the time. It means that one answers a letter the day one gets it and that when one comes to stay with her one doesn't bring too much luggage and is careful not to be taken ill. For Mrs. Touchett those things constitute virtue; it's a blessing to be able to reduce it to its elements.""




Madame Merle's own conversation, it will be perceived, was enriched with bold, free touches of criticism, which, even when they had a restrictive effect, never struck Isabel as ill-natured. It couldn't occur to the girl for instance that Mrs. Touchett's accomplished guest was abusing her; and this for very good reasons. In the first place Isabel rose eagerly to the sense of her shades; in the second Madame Merle implied that there was a great deal more to say; and it was clear in the third that for a person to speak to one without ceremony of one's near relations was an agreeable sign of that person's intimacy with one's self. These signs of deep communion multiplied as the days elapsed, and there was none of which Isabel was more sensible than of her companion's preference for making Miss Archer herself a topic. Though she referred frequently to the incidents of her own career she never lingered upon them; she was as little of a gross egotist as she was of a flat gossip.




""I'm old and stale and faded,"" she said more than once; ""I'm of no more interest than last week's newspaper. You're young and fresh and of to-day; you've the great thing—you've actuality. I once had it—we all have it for an hour. You, however, will have it for longer. Let us talk about you then; you can say nothing I shall not care to hear. It's a sign that I'm growing old—that I like to talk with younger people. I think it's a very pretty compensation. If we can't have youth within us we can have it outside, and I really think we see it and feel it better that way. Of course we must be in sympathy with it—that I shall always be. I don't know that I shall ever be ill-natured with old people—I hope not; there are cer tainly some old people I adore. But I shall never be anything but abject with the young; they touch me and appeal to me too much. I give you carte blanche then; you can even be impertinent if you like; I shall let it pass and horribly spoil you. I speak as if I were a hundred years old, you say? Well, I am, if you please; I was born before the French Revolution. Ah, my dear, je viens de loin; I belong to the old, old world. But it's not of that I want to talk; I want to talk about the new. You must tell me more about America; you never tell me enough. Here I've been since I was brought here as a helpless child, and it's ridiculous, or rather it's scandalous, how little I know about that splendid, dreadful, funny country—surely the greatest and drollest of them all. There are a great many of us like that in these parts, and I must say I think we're a wretched set of people. You should live in your own land; whatever it may be you have your natural place there. If we're not good Americans we're certainly poor Europeans; we've no natural place here. We're mere parasites, crawling over the surface; we haven't our feet in the soil. At least one can know it and not have illusions. A woman perhaps can get on; a woman, it seems to me, has no natural place anywhere; wherever she finds herself she has to remain on the surface and, more or less, to crawl. You protest, my dear? you're horrified? you declare you'll never crawl? It's very true that I don't see you crawling; you stand more upright than a good many poor creatures. Very good; on the whole, I don't think you'll crawl. But the men, the Americans; je vous demande un peu, what do they make of it over here? I don't envy them trying to arrange themselves. Look at poor Ralph Touchett: what sort of a figure do you call that? Fortunately he has a consumption; I say fortunately, because it gives him something to do. His consumption's his carriere it's a kind of position. You can say: 'Oh, Mr. Touchett, he takes care of his lungs, he knows a great deal about climates.' But without that who would he be, what would he represent? 'Mr. Ralph Touchett: an American who lives in Europe.' That signifies absolutely nothing—it's impossible anything should signify less. 'He's very cultivated,' they say: 'he has a very pretty collection of old snuff-boxes.' The collection is all that's wanted to make it pitiful. I'm tired of the sound of the word; I think it's grotesque. With the poor old father it's different; he has his identity, and it's rather a massive one. He represents a great financial house, and that, in our day, is as good as anything else. For an American, at any rate, that will do very well. But I persist in thinking your cousin very lucky to have a chronic malady so long as he doesn't die of it. It's much better than the snuffboxes. If he weren't ill, you say, he'd do something?—he'd take his father's place in the house. My poor child, I doubt it; I don't think he's at all fond of the house. However, you know him better than I, though I used to know him rather well, and he may have the benefit of the doubt. The worst case, I think, is a friend of mine, a countryman of ours, who lives in Italy (where he also was brought before he knew better), and who is one of the most delightful men I know. Some day you must know him. I'll bring you together and then you'll see what I mean. He's Gilbert Osmond—he lives in Italy; that's all one can say about him or make of him. He's exceedingly clever, a man made to be distinguished; but, as I tell you, you exhaust the description when you say he's Mr. Osmond who lives tout betement in Italy. No career, no name, no position, no fortune, no past, no future, no anything. Oh yes, he paints, if you please—paints in water-colours; like me, only better than I. His painting's pretty bad; on the whole I'm rather glad of that. Fortunately he's very indolent, so indolent that it amounts to a sort of position. He can say, 'Oh, I do nothing; I'm too deadly lazy. You can do nothing to-day unless you get up at five o'clock in the morning.' In that way he becomes a sort of exception; you feel he might do something if he'd only rise early. He never speaks of his painting to people at large; he's too clever for that. But he has a little girl—a dear little girl; he does speak of her. He's devoted to her, and if it were a career to be an excellent father he'd be very distinguished. But I'm afraid that's no better than the snuff-boxes; perhaps not even so good. Tell me what they do in America,"" pursued Madame Merle, who, it must be observed parenthetically, did not deliver herself all at once of these reflexions, which are presented in a cluster for the convenience of the reader. She talked of Florence, where Mr. Osmond lived and where Mrs. Touchett occupied a medieval palace; she talked of Rome, where she herself had a little pied-a-terre with some rather good old damask. She talked of places, of people and even, as the phrase is, of ""subjects""; and from time to time she talked of their kind old host and of the prospect of his recovery. From the first she had thought this prospect small, and Isabel had been struck with the positive, discriminating, competent way in which she took the measure of his remainder of life. One evening she announced definitely that he wouldn't live.




""Sir Matthew Hope told me so as plainly as was proper,"" she said; ""standing there, near the fire, before dinner. He makes himself very agreeable, the great doctor. I don't mean his saying that has anything to do with it. But he says such things with great tact. I had told him I felt ill at my ease, staying here at such a time; it seemed to me so indiscreet—it wasn't as if I could nurse. 'You must remain, you must remain,' he answered; 'your office will come later.' Wasn't that a very delicate way of saying both that poor Mr. Touchett would go and that I might be of some use as a consoler? In fact, however, I shall not be of the slightest use. Your aunt will console herself; she, and she alone, knows just how much consolation she'll require. It would be a very delicate matter for another person to undertake to administer the dose. With your cousin it will be different; he'll miss his father immensely. But I should never presume to condole with Mr. Ralph; we're not on those terms."" Madame Merle had alluded more than once to some undefined incongruity in her relations with Ralph Touchett; so Isabel took this occasion of asking her if they were not good friends.




""Perfectly, but he doesn't like me.""




""What have you done to him?""




""Nothing whatever. But one has no need of a reason for that.""




""For not liking you? I think one has need of a very good reason.""




""You're very kind. Be sure you have one ready for the day you begin.""




""Begin to dislike you? I shall never begin.""




""I hope not; because if you do you'll never end. That's the way with your cousin; he doesn't get over it. It's an antipathy of nature—if I can call it that when it's all on his side. I've nothing whatever against him and don't bear him the least little grudge for not doing me justice. Justice is all I want. However, one feels that he's a gentleman and would never say anything underhand about one. Cartes sur table,"" Madame Merle subjoined in a moment, ""I'm not afraid of him.""




""I hope not indeed,"" said Isabel, who added something about his being the kindest creature living. She remembered, however, that on her first asking him about Madame Merle he had answered her in a manner which this lady might have thought injurious without being explicit. There was something between them, Isabel said to herself, but she said nothing more than this. If it were something of importance it should inspire respect; if it were not it was not worth her curiosity. With all her love of knowledge she had a natural shrinking from raising curtains and looking into unlighted corners. The love of knowledge coexisted in her mind with the finest capacity for ignorance.




But Madame Merle sometimes said things that startled her, made her raise her clear eyebrows at the time and think of the words afterwards. ""I'd give a great deal to be your age again,"" she broke out once with a bitterness which, though diluted in her customary amplitude of ease, was imperfectly disguised by it. ""If I could only begin again—if I could have my life before me!""




""Your life's before you yet,"" Isabel answered gently, for she was vaguely awe-struck.




""No; the best part's gone, and gone for nothing.""




""Surely not for nothing,"" said Isabel.




""Why not—what have I got? Neither husband, nor child, nor fortune, nor position, nor the traces of a beauty that I never had.""




""You have many friends, dear lady.""




""I'm not so sure!"" cried Madame Merle.




""Ah, you're wrong. You have memories, graces, talents—""




But Madame Merle interrupted her. ""What have my talents brought me? Nothing but the need of using them still, to get through the hours, the years, to cheat myself with some pretence of movement, of unconsciousness. As for my graces and memories the less said about them the better. You'll be my friend till you find a better use for your friendship.""




""It will be for you to see that I don't then,"" said Isabel.




""Yes; I would make an effort to keep you."" And her companion looked at her gravely. ""When I say I should like to be your age I mean with your qualities—frank, generous, sincere like you. In that case I should have made something better of my life.""




""What should you have liked to do that you've not done?""




Madame Merle took a sheet of music—she was seated at the piano and had abruptly wheeled about on the stool when she first spoke —and mechanically turned the leaves. ""I'm very ambitious!"" she at last replied.




""And your ambitions have not been satisfied? They must have been great.""




""They were  great. I should make myself ridiculous by talking of them."""|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"
"ap 00:00"|"twelve o'clock"|"Madame Merle, who had come to Florence on Mrs. Touchett's arrival at the invitation of this lady—Mrs. Touchett offering her for a month the hospitality of Palazzo Crescentini—the judicious Madame Merle spoke to Isabel afresh about Gilbert Osmond and expressed the hope she might know him; making, however, no such point of the matter as we have seen her do in recommending the girl herself to Mr. Osmond's attention. The reason of this was perhaps that Isabel offered no resistance whatever to Madame Merle's proposal. In Italy, as in England, the lady had a multitude of friends, both among the natives of the country and its heterogeneous visitors. She had mentioned to Isabel most of the people the girl would find it well to ""meet""—of course, she said, Isabel could know whomever in the wide world she would—and had placed Mr. Osmond near the top of the list. He was an old friend of her own; she had known him these dozen years; he was one of the cleverest and most agreeable men—well, in Europe simply. He was altogether above the respectable average; quite another affair. He wasn't a professional charmer—far from it, and the effect he produced depended a good deal on the state of his nerves and his spirits. When not in the right mood he could fall as low as any one, saved only by his looking at such hours rather like a demoralised prince in exile. But if he cared or was interested or rightly challenged—just exactly rightly it had to be—then one felt his cleverness and his distinction. Those qualities didn't depend, in him, as in so many people, on his not committing or exposing himself. He had his perversities—which indeed Isabel would find to be the case with all the men really worth knowing—and didn't cause his light to shine equally for all persons. Madame Merle, however, thought she could undertake that for Isabel he would be brilliant. He was easily bored, too easily, and dull people always put him out; but a quick and cultivated girl like Isabel would give him a stimulus which was too absent from his life. At any rate he was a person not to miss. One shouldn't attempt to live in Italy without making a friend of Gilbert Osmond, who knew more about the country than any one except two or three German professors. And if they had more knowledge than he it was he who had most perception and taste—being artistic through and through. Isabel remembered that her friend had spoken of him during their plunge, at Gardencourt, into the deeps of talk, and wondered a little what was the nature of the tie binding these superior spirits. She felt that Madame Merle's ties always somehow had histories, and such an impression was part of the interest created by this inordinate woman. As regards her relations with Mr. Osmond, however, she hinted at nothing but a long-established calm friendship. Isabel said she should be happy to know a person who had enjoyed so high a confidence for so many years. ""You ought to see a great many men,"" Madame Merle remarked; ""you ought to see as many as possible, so as to get used to them.""




""Used to them?"" Isabel repeated with that solemn stare which sometimes seemed to proclaim her deficient in the sense of comedy. ""Why, I'm not afraid of them—I'm as used to them as the cook to the butcher-boys.""




""Used to them, I mean, so as to despise them. That's what one comes to with most of them. You'll pick out, for your society, the few whom you don't despise.""




This was a note of cynicism that Madame Merle didn't often allow herself to sound; but Isabel was not alarmed, for she had never supposed that as one saw more of the world the sentiment of respect became the most active of one's emotions. It was excited, none the less, by the beautiful city of Florence, which pleased her not less than Madame Merle had promised; and if her unassisted perception had not been able to gauge its charms she had clever companions as priests to the mystery. She was—in no want indeed of esthetic illumination, for Ralph found it a joy that renewed his own early passion to act as cicerone to his eager young kinswoman. Madame Merle remained at home; she had seen the treasures of Florence again and again and had always something else to do. But she talked of all things with remarkable vividness of memory—she recalled the right-hand corner of the large Perugino and the position of the hands of the Saint Elizabeth in the picture next to it. She had her opinions as to the character of many famous works of art, differing often from Ralph with great sharpness and defending her interpretations with as much ingenuity as good-humour. Isabel listened to the discussions taking place between the two with a sense that she might derive much benefit from them and that they were among the advantages she couldn't have enjoyed for instance in Albany. In the clear May mornings before the formal breakfast—this repast at Mrs. Touchett's was served at twelve o'clock—she wandered with her cousin through the narrow and sombre Florentine streets, resting a while in the thicker dusk of some historic church or the vaulted chambers of some dispeopled convent. She went to the galleries and palaces; she looked at the pictures and statues that had hitherto been great names to her, and exchanged for a knowledge which was sometimes a limitation a presentiment which proved usually to have been a blank. She performed all those acts of mental prostration in which, on a first visit to Italy, youth and enthusiasm so freely indulge; she felt her heart beat in the presence of immortal genius and knew the sweetness of rising tears in eyes to which faded fresco and darkened marble grew dim. But the return, every day, was even pleasanter than the going forth; the return into the wide, monumental court of the great house in which Mrs. Touchett, many years before, had established herself, and into the high, cool rooms where the carven rafters and pompous frescoes of the sixteenth century looked down on the familiar commodities of the age of advertisement. Mrs. Touchett inhabited an historic building in a narrow street whose very name recalled the strife of medieval factions; and found compensation for the darkness of her frontage in the modicity of her rent and the brightness of a garden where nature itself looked as archaic as the rugged architecture of the palace and which cleared and scented the rooms in regular use. To live in such a place was, for Isabel, to hold to her ear all day a shell of the sea of the past. This vague eternal rumour kept her imagination awake.




Gilbert Osmond came to see Madame Merle, who presented him to the young lady lurking at the other side of the room. Isabel took on this occasion little part in the talk; she scarcely even smiled when the others turned to her invitingly; she sat there as if she had been at the play and had paid even a large sum for her place. Mrs. Touchett was not present, and these two had it, for the effect of brilliancy, all their own way. They talked of the Florentine, the Roman, the cosmopolite world, and might have been distinguished performers figuring for a charity. It all had the rich readiness that would have come from rehearsal. Madame Merle appealed to her as if she had been on the stage, but she could ignore any learnt cue without spoiling the scene—though of course she thus put dreadfully in the wrong the friend who had told Mr. Osmond she could be depended on. This was no matter for once; even if more had been involved she could have made no attempt to shine. There was something in the visitor that checked her and held her in suspense—made it more important she should get an impression of him than that she should produce one herself. Besides, she had little skill in producing an impression which she knew to be expected: nothing could be happier, in general, than to seem dazzling, but she had a perverse unwillingness to glitter by arrangement. Mr. Osmond, to do him justice, had a well-bred air of expecting nothing, a quiet ease that covered everything, even the first show of his own wit. This was the more grateful as his face, his head, was sensitive; he was not handsome, but he was fine, as fine as one of the drawings in the long gallery above the bridge of the Uffizi. And his very voice was fine—the more strangely that, with its clearness, it yet somehow wasn't sweet. This had had really to do with making her abstain from interference. His utterance was the vibration of glass, and if she had put out her finger she might have changed the pitch and spoiled the concert. Yet before he went she had to speak.




""Madame Merle,"" he said, ""consents to come up to my hill-top some day next week and drink tea in my garden. It would give me much pleasure if you would come with her. It's thought rather pretty—there's what they call a general view. My daughter too would be so glad—or rather, for she's too young to have strong emotions, I should be so glad—so very glad."" And Mr. Osmond paused with a slight air of embarrassment, leaving his sentence unfinished. ""I should be so happy if you could know my daughter,"" he went on a moment afterwards.




Isabel replied that she should be delighted to see Miss Osmond and that if Madame Merle would show her the way to the hill-top she should be very grateful. Upon this assurance the visitor took his leave; after which Isabel fully expected her friend would scold her for having been so stupid. But to her surprise that lady, who indeed never fell into the mere matter-of-course, said to her in a few moments




""You were charming, my dear; you were just as one would have wished you. You're never disappointing.""




A rebuke might possibly have been irritating, though it is much more probable that Isabel would have taken it in good part; but, strange to say, the words that Madame Merle actually used caused her the first feeling of displeasure she had known this ally to excite. ""That's more than I intended,"" she answered coldly. ""I'm under no obligation that I know of to charm Mr. Osmond.""




Madame Merle perceptibly flushed, but we know it was not her habit to retract. ""My dear child, I didn't speak for him, poor man; I spoke for yourself. It's not of course a question as to his liking you; it matters little whether he likes you or not! But I thought you liked HIM.""




""I did,"" said Isabel honestly. ""But I don't see what that matters either.""




""Everything that concerns you matters to me,"" Madame Merle returned with her weary nobleness; ""especially when at the same time another old friend's concerned.""




Whatever Isabel's obligations may have been to Mr. Osmond, it must be admitted that she found them sufficient to lead her to put to Ralph sundry questions about him. She thought Ralph's judgements distorted by his trials, but she flattered herself she had learned to make allowance for that.




""Do I know him?"" said her cousin. ""Oh, yes, I 'know' him; not well, but on the whole enough. I've never cultivated his society, and he apparently has never found mine indispensable to his happiness. Who is he, what is he? He's a vague, unexplained American who has been living these thirty years, or less, in Italy. Why do I call him unexplained? Only as a cover for my ignorance; I don't know his antecedents, his family, his origin. For all I do know he may be a prince in disguise; he rather looks like one, by the way—like a prince who has abdicated in a fit of fastidiousness and has been in a state of disgust ever since. He used to live in Rome; but of late years he has taken up his abode here; I remember hearing him say that Rome has grown vulgar. He has a great dread of vulgarity; that's his special line; he hasn't any other that I know of. He lives on his income, which I suspect of not being vulgarly large. He's a poor but honest gentleman that's what he calls himself. He married young and lost his wife, and I believe he has a daughter. He also has a sister, who's married to some small Count or other, of these parts; I remember meeting her of old. She's nicer than he, I should think, but rather impossible. I remember there used to be some stories about her. I don't think I recommend you to know her. But why don't you ask Madame Merle about these people? She knows them all much better than I.""




""I ask you because I want your opinion as well as hers,"" said Isabel.




""A fig for my opinion! If you fall in love with Mr. Osmond what will you care for that?""




""Not much, probably. But meanwhile it has a certain importance. The more information one has about one's dangers the better.""




""I don't agree to that—it may make them dangers. We know too much about people in these days; we hear too much. Our ears, our minds, our mouths, are stuffed with personalities. Don't mind anything any one tells you about any one else. Judge everyone and everything for yourself.""




""That's what I try to do,"" said Isabel ""but when you do that people call you conceited.""




""You're not to mind them—that's precisely my argument; not to mind what they say about yourself any more than what they say about your friend or your enemy.""




Isabel considered. ""I think you're right; but there are some things I can't help minding: for instance when my friend's attacked or when I myself am praised.""




""Of course you're always at liberty to judge the critic. Judge people as critics, however,"" Ralph added, ""and you'll condemn them all!""




""I shall see Mr. Osmond for myself,"" said Isabel. ""I've promised to pay him a visit.""




""To pay him a visit?""




""To go and see his view, his pictures, his daughter—I don't know exactly what. Madame Merle's to take me; she tells me a great many ladies call on him.""




""Ah, with Madame Merle you may go anywhere, de confiance,"" said Ralph. ""She knows none but the best people.""




Isabel said no more about Mr. Osmond, but she presently remarked to her cousin that she was not satisfied with his tone about Madame Merle. ""It seems to me you insinuate things about her. I don't know what you mean, but if you've any grounds for disliking her I think you should either mention them frankly or else say nothing at all.""




Ralph, however, resented this charge with more apparent earnestness than he commonly used. ""I speak of Madame Merle exactly as I speak to her: with an even exaggerated respect.""




""Exaggerated, precisely. That's what I complain of.""




""I do so because Madame Merle's merits are exaggerated.""




""By whom, pray? By me? If so I do her a poor service.""




""No, no; by herself.""




""Ah, I protest!"" Isabel earnestly cried. ""If ever there was a woman who made small claims—!""




""You put your finger on it,"" Ralph interrupted. ""Her modesty's exaggerated. She has no business with small claims—she has a perfect right to make large ones.""




""Her merits are large then. You contradict yourself.""




""Her merits are immense,"" said Ralph. ""She's indescribably blameless; a pathless desert of virtue; the only woman I know who never gives one a chance.""




""A chance for what?""




""Well, say to call her a fool! She's the only woman I know who has but that one little fault.""




Isabel turned away with impatience. ""I don't understand you; you're too paradoxical for my plain mind.""




""Let me explain. When I say she exaggerates I don't mean it in the vulgar sense—that she boasts, overstates, gives too fine an account of herself. I mean literally that she pushes the search for perfection too far—that her merits are in themselves overstrained. She's too good, too kind, too clever, too learned, too accomplished, too everything. She's too complete, in a word. I confess to you that she acts on my nerves and that I feel about her a good deal as that intensely human Athenian felt about Aristides the Just.""




Isabel looked hard at her cousin; but the mocking spirit, if it lurked in his words, failed on this occasion to peep from his face. ""Do you wish Madame Merle to be banished?""




""By no means. She's much too good company. I delight in Madame Merle,"" said Ralph Touchett simply.




""You're very odious, sir!"" Isabel exclaimed. And then she asked him if he knew anything that was not to the honour of her brilliant friend.




""Nothing whatever. Don't you see that's just what I mean? On the character of every one else you may find some little black speck; if I were to take half an hour to it, some day, I've no doubt I should be able to find one on yours. For my own, of course, I'm spotted like a leopard. But on Madame Merle's nothing, nothing, nothing!""




""That's just what I think!"" said Isabel with a toss of her head. ""That is why I like her so much.""




""She's a capital person for you to know. Since you wish to see the world you couldn't have a better guide.""




""I suppose you mean by that that she's worldly?""




""Worldly? No,"" said Ralph, ""she's the great round world itself!""




It had certainly not, as Isabel for the moment took it into her head to believe, been a refinement of malice in him to say that he delighted in Madame Merle. Ralph Touchett took his refreshment wherever he could find it, and he would not have forgiven himself if he had been left wholly unbeguiled by such a mistress of the social art. There are deep-lying sympathies and antipathies, and it may have been that, in spite of the administered justice she enjoyed at his hands, her absence from his mother's house would not have made life barren to him. But Ralph Touchett had learned more or less inscrutably to attend, and there could have been nothing so ""sustained"" to attend to as the general performance of Madame Merle. He tasted her in sips, he let her stand, with an opportuneness she herself could not have surpassed. There were moments when he felt almost sorry for her; and these, oddly enough, were the moments when his kindness was least demonstrative. He was sure she had been yearningly ambitious and that what she had visibly accomplished was far below her secret measure. She had got herself into perfect training, but had won none of the prizes. She was always plain Madame Merle, the widow of a Swiss negociant, with a small income and a large acquaintance, who stayed with people a great deal and was almost as universally ""liked"" as some new volume of smooth twaddle. The contrast between this position and any one of some half-dozen others that he supposed to have at various moments engaged her hope had an element of the tragical. His mother thought he got on beautifully with their genial guest; to Mrs. Touchett's sense two persons who dealt so largely in too-ingenious theories of conduct—that is of their own—would have much in common. He had given due consideration to Isabel's intimacy with her eminent friend, having long since made up his mind that he could not, without opposition, keep his cousin to himself; and he made the best of it, as he had done of worse things. He believed it would take care of itself; it wouldn't last forever. Neither of these two superior persons knew the other as well as she supposed, and when each had made an important discovery or two there would be, if not a rupture, at least a relaxation. Meanwhile he was quite willing to admit that the conversation of the elder lady was an advantage to the younger, who had a great deal to learn and would doubtless learn it better from Madame Merle than from some other instructors of the young. It was not probable that Isabel would be injured."|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"
"~ 16:30"|vespers|"I may not attempt to report in its fulness our young woman's response to the deep appeal of Rome, to analyse her feelings as she trod the pavement of the Forum or to number her pulsations as she crossed the threshold of Saint Peter's. It is enough to say that her impression was such as might have been expected of a person of her freshness and her eagerness. She had always been fond of history, and here was history in the stones of the street and the atoms of the sunshine. She had an imagination that kindled at the mention of great deeds, and wherever she turned some great deed had been acted. These things strongly moved her, but moved her all inwardly. It seemed to her companions that she talked less than usual, and Ralph Touchett, when he appeared to be looking listlessly and awkwardly over her head, was really dropping on her an intensity of observation. By her own measure she was very happy; she would even have been willing to take these hours for the happiest she was ever to know. The sense of the terrible human past was heavy to her, but that of something altogether contemporary would suddenly give it wings that it could wave in the blue. Her consciousness was so mixed that she scarcely knew where the different parts of it would lead her, and she went about in a repressed ecstasy of contemplation, seeing often in the things she looked at a great deal more than was there, and yet not seeing many of the items enumerated in her Murray. Rome, as Ralph said, confessed to the psychological moment. The herd of reechoing tourists had departed and most of the solemn places had relapsed into solemnity. The sky was a blaze of blue, and the plash of the fountains in their mossy niches had lost its chill and doubled its music. On the corners of the warm, bright streets one stumbled on bundles of flowers. Our friends had gone one afternoon—it was the third of their stay—to look at the latest excavations in the Forum, these labours having been for some time previous largely extended. They had descended from the modern street to the level of the Sacred Way, along which they wandered with a reverence of step which was not the same on the part of each. Henrietta Stackpole was struck with the fact that ancient Rome had been paved a good deal like New York, and even found an analogy between the deep chariot-ruts traceable in the antique street and the overjangled iron grooves which express the intensity of American life. The sun had begun to sink, the air was a golden haze, and the long shadows of broken column and vague pedestal leaned across the field of ruin. Henrietta wandered away with Mr. Bantling, whom it was apparently delightful to her to hear speak of Julius Caesar as a ""cheeky old boy,"" and Ralph addressed such elucidations as he was prepared to offer to the attentive ear of our heroine. One of the humble archeologists who hover about the place had put himself at the disposal of the two, and repeated his lesson with a fluency which the decline of the season had done nothing to impair. A process of digging was on view in a remote corner of the Forum, and he presently remarked that if it should please the signori to go and watch it a little they might see something of interest. The proposal commended itself more to Ralph than to Isabel, weary with much wandering; so that she admonished her companion to satisfy his curiosity while she patiently awaited his return. The hour and the place were much to her taste—she should enjoy being briefly alone. Ralph accordingly went off with the cicerone while Isabel sat down on a prostrate column near the foundations of the Capitol. She wanted a short solitude, but she was not long to enjoy it. Keen as was her interest in the rugged relics of the Roman past that lay scattered about her and in which the corrosion of centuries had still left so much of individual life, her thoughts, after resting a while on these things, had wandered, by a concatenation of stages it might require some subtlety to trace, to regions and objects charged with a more active appeal. From the Roman past to Isabel Archer's future was a long stride, but her imagination had taken it in a single flight and now hovered in slow circles over the nearer and richer field. She was so absorbed in her thoughts, as she bent her eyes upon a row of cracked but not dislocated slabs covering the ground at her feet, that she had not heard the sound of approaching footsteps before a shadow was thrown across the line of her vision. She looked up and saw a gentleman—a gentleman who was not Ralph come back to say that the excavations were a bore. This personage was startled as she was startled; he stood there baring his head to her perceptibly pale surprise.




""Lord Warburton!"" Isabel exclaimed as she rose.




""I had no idea it was you. I turned that corner and came upon you.""




She looked about her to explain. ""I'm alone, but my companions have just left me. My cousin's gone to look at the work over there.""




""Ah yes; I see."" And Lord Warburton's eyes wandered vaguely in the direction she had indicated. He stood firmly before her now; he had recovered his balance and seemed to wish to show it, though very kindly. ""Don't let me disturb you,"" he went on, looking at her dejected pillar. ""I'm afraid you're tired.""




""Yes, I'm rather tired."" She hesitated a moment, but sat down again. ""Don't let me interrupt you,"" she added.




""Oh dear, I'm quite alone, I've nothing on earth to do. I had no idea you were in Rome. I've just come from the East. I'm only passing through.""




""You've been making a long journey,"" said Isabel, who had learned from Ralph that Lord Warburton was absent from England.




""Yes, I came abroad for six months—soon after I saw you last. I've been in Turkey and Asia Minor; I came the other day from Athens."" He managed not to be awkward, but he wasn't easy, and after a longer look at the girl he came down to nature. ""Do you wish me to leave you, or will you let me stay a little?""




She took it all humanely. ""I don't wish you to leave me, Lord Warburton; I'm very glad to see you.""




""Thank you for saying that. May I sit down?""




The fluted shaft on which she had taken her seat would have afforded a resting-place to several persons, and there was plenty of room even for a highly-developed Englishman. This fine specimen of that great class seated himself near our young lady, and in the course of five minutes he had asked her several questions, taken rather at random and to which, as he put some of them twice over, he apparently somewhat missed catching the answer; had given her too some information about himself which was not wasted upon her calmer feminine sense. He repeated more than once that he had not expected to meet her, and it was evident that the encounter touched him in a way that would have made preparation advisable. He began abruptly to pass from the impunity of things to their solemnity, and from their being delightful to their being impossible. He was splendidly sunburnt; even his multitudinous beard had been burnished by the fire of Asia. He was dressed in the loose-fitting, heterogeneous garments in which the English traveller in foreign lands is wont to consult his comfort and affirm his nationality; and with his pleasant steady eyes, his bronzed complexion, fresh beneath its seasoning, his manly figure, his minimising manner and his general air of being a gentleman and an explorer, he was such a representative of the British race as need not in any clime have been disavowed by those who have a kindness for it. Isabel noted these things and was glad she had always liked him. He had kept, evidently in spite of shocks, every one of his merits—properties these partaking of the essence of great decent houses, as one might put it; resembling their innermost fixtures and ornaments, not subject to vulgar shifting and removable only by some whole break-up. They talked of the matters naturally in order; her uncle's death, Ralph's state of health, the way she had passed her winter, her visit to Rome, her return to Florence, her plans for the summer, the hotel she was staying at; and then of Lord Warburton's own adventures, movements, intentions, impressions and present domicile. At last there was a silence, and it said so much more than either had said that it scarce needed his final words. ""I've written to you several times.""




""Written to me? I've never had your letters.""




""I never sent them. I burned them up.""




""Ah,"" laughed Isabel, ""it was better that you should do that than I!""




""I thought you wouldn't care for them,"" he went on with a simplicity that touched her. ""It seemed to me that after all I had no right to trouble you with letters.""




""I should have been very glad to have news of you. You know how I hoped that—that—"" But she stopped; there would be such a flatness in the utterance of her thought.




""I know what you're going to say. You hoped we should always remain good friends."" This formula, as Lord Warburton uttered it, was certainly flat enough; but then he was interested in making it appear so.




She found herself reduced simply to ""Please don't talk of all that""; a speech which hardly struck her as improvement on the other.




""It's a small consolation to allow me!"" her companion exclaimed with force.




""I can't pretend to console you,"" said the girl, who, all still as she sat there, threw herself back with a sort of inward triumph on the answer that had satisfied him so little six months before. He was pleasant, he was powerful, he was gallant; there was no better man than he. But her answer remained.




""It's very well you don't try to console me; it wouldn't be in your power,"" she heard him say through the medium of her strange elation.




""I hoped we should meet again, because I had no fear you would attempt to make me feel I had wronged you. But when you do that—the pain's greater than the pleasure."" And she got up with a small conscious majesty, looking for her companions.




""I don't want to make you feel that; of course I can't say that. I only just want you to know one or two things—in fairness to myself, as it were. I won't return to the subject again. I felt very strongly what I expressed to you last year; I couldn't think of anything else. I tried to forget—energetically, systematically. I tried to take an interest in somebody else. I tell you this because I want you to know I did my duty. I didn't succeed. It was for the same purpose I went abroad—as far away as possible. They say travelling distracts the mind, but it didn't distract mine. I've thought of you perpetually, ever since I last saw you. I'm exactly the same. I love you just as much, and everything I said to you then is just as true. This instant at which I speak to you shows me again exactly how, to my great misfortune, you just insuperably charm me. There—I can't say less. I don't mean, however, to insist; it's only for a moment. I may add that when I came upon you a few minutes since, without the smallest idea of seeing you, I was, upon my honour, in the very act of wishing I knew where you were."" He had recovered his self-control, and while he spoke it became complete. He might have been addressing a small committee—making all quietly and clearly a statement of importance; aided by an occasional look at a paper of notes concealed in his hat, which he had not again put on. And the committee, assuredly, would have felt the point proved.




""I've often thought of you, Lord Warburton,"" Isabel answered. ""You may be sure I shall always do that."" And she added in a tone of which she tried to keep up the kindness and keep down the meaning: ""There's no harm in that on either side.""




They walked along together, and she was prompt to ask about his sisters and request him to let them know she had done so. He made for the moment no further reference to their great question, but dipped again into shallower and safer waters. But he wished to know when she was to leave Rome, and on her mentioning the limit of her stay declared he was glad it was still so distant.




""Why do you say that if you yourself are only passing through?"" she enquired with some anxiety.




""Ah, when I said I was passing through I didn't mean that one would treat Rome as if it were Clapham Junction. To pass through Rome is to stop a week or two.""




""Say frankly that you mean to stay as long as I do!""




His flushed smile, for a little, seemed to sound her. ""You won't like that. You're afraid you'll see too much of me.""




""It doesn't matter what I like. I certainly can't expect you to leave this delightful place on my account. But I confess I'm afraid of you.""




""Afraid I'll begin again? I promise to be very careful.""




They had gradually stopped and they stood a moment face to face. ""Poor Lord Warburton!"" she said with a compassion intended to be good for both of them.




""Poor Lord Warburton indeed! But I'll be careful.""




""You may be unhappy, but you shall not make ME so. That I can't allow.""




""If I believed I could make you unhappy I think I should try it."" At this she walked in advance and he also proceeded. ""I'll never say a word to displease you.""




""Very good. If you do, our friendship's at an end.""




""Perhaps some day—after a while—you'll give me leave.""




""Give you leave to make me unhappy?""




He hesitated. ""To tell you again—"" But he checked himself. ""I'll keep it down. I'll keep it down always.""




Ralph Touchett had been joined in his visit to the excavation by Miss Stackpole and her attendant, and these three now emerged from among the mounds of earth and stone collected round the aperture and came into sight of Isabel and her companion. Poor Ralph hailed his friend with joy qualified by wonder, and Henrietta exclaimed in a high voice ""Gracious, there's that lord!"" Ralph and his English neighbour greeted with the austerity with which, after long separations, English neighbours greet, and Miss Stackpole rested her large intellectual gaze upon the sunburnt traveller. But she soon established her relation to the crisis. ""I don't suppose you remember me, sir.""




""Indeed I do remember you,"" said Lord Warburton. ""I asked you to come and see me, and you never came.""




""I don't go everywhere I'm asked,"" Miss Stackpole answered coldly.




""Ah well, I won't ask you again,"" laughed the master of Lockleigh.




""If you do I'll go; so be sure!""




Lord Warburton, for all his hilarity, seemed sure enough. Mr. Bantling had stood by without claiming a recognition, but he now took occasion to nod to his lordship, who answered him with a friendly ""Oh, you here, Bantling?"" and a hand-shake.




""Well,"" said Henrietta, ""I didn't know you knew him!""




""I guess you don't know every one I know,"" Mr. Bantling rejoined facetiously.




""I thought that when an Englishman knew a lord he always told you.""




""Ah, I'm afraid Bantling was ashamed of me,"" Lord Warburton laughed again. Isabel took pleasure in that note; she gave a small sigh of relief as they kept their course homeward.




The next day was Sunday; she spent her morning over two long letters—one to her sister Lily, the other to Madame Merle; but in neither of these epistles did she mention the fact that a rejected suitor had threatened her with another appeal. Of a Sunday afternoon all good Romans (and the best Romans are often the northern barbarians) follow the custom of going to vespers at Saint Peter's; and it had been agreed among our friends that they would drive together to the great church. After lunch, an hour before the carriage came, Lord Warburton presented himself at the Hotel de Paris and paid a visit to the two ladies, Ralph Touchett and Mr. Bantling having gone out together. The visitor seemed to have wished to give Isabel a proof of his intention to keep the promise made her the evening before; he was both discreet and frank—not even dumbly importunate or remotely intense. He thus left her to judge what a mere good friend he could be. He talked about his travels, about Persia, about Turkey, and when Miss Stackpole asked him whether it would ""pay"" for her to visit those countries assured her they offered a great field to female enterprise. Isabel did him justice, but she wondered what his purpose was and what he expected to gain even by proving the superior strain of his sincerity. If he expected to melt her by showing what a good fellow he was, he might spare himself the trouble. She knew the superior strain of everything about him, and nothing he could now do was required to light the view. Moreover his being in Rome at all affected her as a complication of the wrong sort—she liked so complications of the right. Nevertheless, when, on bringing his call to a close, he said he too should be at Saint Peter's and should look out for her and her friends, she was obliged to reply that he must follow his convenience.




In the church, as she strolled over its tesselated acres, he was the first person she encountered. She had not been one of the superior tourists who are ""disappointed"" in Saint Peter's and find it smaller than its fame; the first time she passed beneath the huge leathern curtain that strains and bangs at the entrance, the first time she found herself beneath the far-arching dome and saw the light drizzle down through the air thickened with incense and with the reflections of marble and gilt, of mosaic and bronze, her conception of greatness rose and dizzily rose. After this it never lacked space to soar. She gazed and wondered like a child or a peasant, she paid her silent tribute to the seated sublime. Lord Warburton walked beside her and talked of Saint Sophia of Constantinople; she feared for instance that he would end by calling attention to his exemplary conduct. The service had not yet begun, but at Saint Peter's there is much to observe, and as there is something almost profane in the vastness of the place, which seems meant as much for physical as for spiritual exercise, the different figures and groups, the mingled worshippers and spectators, may follow their various intentions without conflict or scandal. In that splendid immensity individual indiscretion carries but a short distance. Isabel and her companions, however, were guilty of none; for though Henrietta was obliged in candour to declare that Michael Angelo's dome suffered by comparison with that of the Capitol at Washington, she addressed her protest chiefly to Mr. Bantling's ear and reserved it in its more accentuated form for the columns of the Interviewer. Isabel made the circuit of the church with his lordship, and as they drew near the choir on the left of the entrance the voices of the Pope's singers were borne to them over the heads of the large number of persons clustered outside the doors. They paused a while on the skirts of this crowd, composed in equal measure of Roman cockneys and inquisitive strangers, and while they stood there the sacred concert went forward. Ralph, with Henrietta and Mr. Bantling, was apparently within, where Isabel, looking beyond the dense group in front of her, saw the afternoon light, silvered by clouds of incense that seemed to mingle with the splendid chant, slope through the embossed recesses of high windows. After a while the singing stopped and then Lord Warburton seemed disposed to move off with her. Isabel could only accompany him; whereupon she found herself confronted with Gilbert Osmond, who appeared to have been standing at a short distance behind her. He now approached with all the forms —he appeared to have multiplied them on this occasion to suit the place.




""So you decided to come?"" she said as she put out her hand.




""Yes, I came last night and called this afternoon at your hotel. They told me you had come here, and I looked about for you.""




""The others are inside,"" she decided to say.




""I didn't come for the others,"" he promptly returned.




She looked away; Lord Warburton was watching them; perhaps he had heard this. Suddenly she remembered it to be just what he had said to her the morning he came to Gardencourt to ask her to marry him. Mr. Osmond's words had brought the colour to her cheek, and this reminiscence had not the effect of dispelling it. She repaired any betrayal by mentioning to each companion the name of the other, and fortunately at this moment Mr. Bantling emerged from the choir, cleaving the crowd with British valour and followed by Miss Stackpole and Ralph Touchett. I say fortunately, but this is perhaps a superficial view of the matter; since on perceiving the gentleman from Florence Ralph Touchett appeared to take the case as not committing him to joy. He didn't hang back, however, from civility, and presently observed to Isabel, with due benevolence, that she would soon have all her friends about her. Miss Stackpole had met Mr. Osmond in Florence, but she had already found occasion to say to Isabel that she liked him no better than her other admirers—than Mr. Touchett and Lord Warburton, and even than little Mr. Rosier in Paris. ""I don't know what it's in you,"" she had been pleased to remark, ""but for a nice girl you do attract the most unnatural people. Mr. Goodwood's the only one I've any respect for, and he's just the one you don't appreciate.""




""What's your opinion of Saint Peter's?"" Mr. Osmond was meanwhile enquiring of our young lady.




""It's very large and very bright,"" she contented herself with replying.




""It's too large; it makes one feel like an atom.""




""Isn't that the right way to feel in the greatest of human temples?"" she asked with rather a liking for her phrase.




""I suppose it's the right way to feel everywhere, when one is  nobody. But I like it in a church as little as anywhere else."""|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"
12:00|mid-day|"Her fit of weeping, however, was soon smothered, and the signs of it had vanished when, an hour later, she broke the news to her aunt. I use this expression because she had been sure Mrs. Touchett would not be pleased; Isabel had only waited to tell her till she had seen Mr. Goodwood. She had an odd impression that it would not be honourable to make the fact public before she should have heard what Mr. Goodwood would say about it. He had said rather less than she expected, and she now had a somewhat angry sense of having lost time. But she would lose no more; she waited till Mrs. Touchett came into the drawing-room before the mid-day breakfast, and then she began. ""Aunt Lydia, I've something to tell you.""




Mrs. Touchett gave a little jump and looked at her almost fiercely. ""You needn't tell me; I know what it is.""




""I don't know how you know.""




""The same way that I know when the window's open—by feeling a draught. You're going to marry that man.""




""What man do you mean?"" Isabel enquired with great dignity.




""Madame Merle's friend—Mr. Osmond.""




""I don't know why you call him Madame Merle's friend. Is that the principal thing he's known by?""




""If he's not her friend he ought to be—after what she has done for him!"" cried Mrs. Touchett. ""I shouldn't have expected it of her; I'm disappointed.""




""If you mean that Madame Merle has had anything to do with my engagement you're greatly mistaken,"" Isabel declared with a sort of ardent coldness.




""You mean that your attractions were sufficient, without the gentleman's having had to be lashed up? You're quite right. They're immense, your attractions, and he would never have presumed to think of you if she hadn't put him up to it. He has a very good opinion of himself, but he was not a man to take trouble. Madame Merle took the trouble for him.""




""He has taken a great deal for himself!"" cried Isabel with a voluntary laugh.




Mrs. Touchett gave a sharp nod. ""I think he must, after all, to have made you like him so much.""




""I thought he even pleased you."""|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"
10:00|"ten o'clock in the morning"|"""Is it that Mr. Osmond isn't rich? Is that what you're talking about?"" Isabel asked.




""He has no money; he has no name; he has no importance. I value such things and I have the courage to say it; I think they're very precious. Many other people think the same, and they show it. But they give some other reason.""




Isabel hesitated a little. ""I think I value everything that's valuable. I care very much for money, and that's why I wish Mr. Osmond to have a little.""




""Give it to him then; but marry some one else.""




""His name's good enough for me,"" the girl went on. ""It's a very pretty name. Have I such a fine one myself?""




""All the more reason you should improve on it. There are only a dozen American names. Do you marry him out of charity?""




""It was my duty to tell you, Aunt Lydia, but I don't think it's my duty to explain to you. Even if it were I shouldn't be able. So please don't remonstrate; in talking about it you have me at a disadvantage. I can't talk about it.""




""I don't remonstrate, I simply answer you: I must give some sign of intelligence. I saw it coming, and I said nothing. I never meddle.""




""You never do, and I'm greatly obliged to you. You've been very considerate.""




""It was not considerate—it was convenient,"" said Mrs. Touchett. ""But I shall talk to Madame Merle.""




""I don't see why you keep bringing her in. She has been a very good friend to me.""




""Possibly; but she has been a poor one to me.""




""What has she done to you?""




""She has deceived me. She had as good as promised me to prevent your engagement.""




""She couldn't have prevented it.""




""She can do anything; that's what I've always liked her for. I knew she could play any part; but I understood that she played them one by one. I didn't understand that she would play two at the same time.""




""I don't know what part she may have played to you,"" Isabel said; ""that's between yourselves. To me she has been honest and kind and devoted.""




""Devoted, of course; she wished you to marry her candidate. She told me she was watching you only in order to interpose.""




""She said that to please you,"" the girl answered; conscious, however, of the inadequacy of the explanation.




""To please me by deceiving me? She knows me better. Am I pleased to-day?""




""I don't think you're ever much pleased,"" Isabel was obliged to reply. ""If Madame Merle knew you would learn the truth what had she to gain by insincerity?""




""She gained time, as you see. While I waited for her to interfere you were marching away, and she was really beating the drum.""




""That's very well. But by your own admission you saw I was marching, and even if she had given the alarm you wouldn't have tried to stop me.""




""No, but some one else would.""




""Whom do you mean?"" Isabel asked, looking very hard at her aunt. Mrs. Touchett's little bright eyes, active as they usually were, sustained her gaze rather than returned it. ""Would you have listened to Ralph?""




""Not if he had abused Mr. Osmond.""




""Ralph doesn't abuse people; you know that perfectly. He cares very much for you.""




""I know he does,"" said Isabel; ""and I shall feel the value of it now, for he knows that whatever I do I do with reason.""




""He never believed you would do this. I told him you were capable of it, and he argued the other way.""




""He did it for the sake of argument,"" the girl smiled. ""You don't accuse him of having deceived you; why should you accuse Madame Merle?""




""He never pretended he'd prevent it.""




""I'm glad of that!"" cried Isabel gaily. ""I wish very much,"" she presently added, ""that when he comes you'd tell him first of my engagement.""




""Of course I'll mention it,"" said Mrs. Touchett. ""I shall say nothing more to you about it, but I give you notice I shall talk to others.""




""That's as you please. I only meant that it's rather better the announcement should come from you than from me.""




""I quite agree with you; it's much more proper!"" And on this the aunt and the niece went to breakfast, where Mrs. Touchett, as good as her word, made no allusion to Gilbert Osmond. After an interval of silence, however, she asked her companion from whom she had received a visit an hour before.




""From an old friend—an American gentleman,"" Isabel said with a colour in her cheek.




""An American gentleman of course. It's only an American gentleman who calls at ten o'clock in the morning.""




""It was half-past ten; he was in a great hurry; he goes away this evening.""




""Couldn't he have come yesterday, at the usual time?""




""He only arrived last night.""




""He spends but twenty-four hours in Florence?"" Mrs. Touchett cried. ""He's an American gentleman truly.""




""He is indeed,"" said Isabel, thinking with perverse admiration of what Caspar Goodwood had done for her.




Two days afterward Ralph arrived; but though Isabel was sure that Mrs. Touchett had lost no time in imparting to him the great fact, he showed at first no open knowledge of it. Their prompted talk was naturally of his health; Isabel had many questions to ask about Corfu. She had been shocked by his appearance when he came into the room; she had forgotten how ill he looked. In spite of Corfu he looked very ill to-day, and she wondered if he were really worse or if she were simply disaccustomed to living with an invalid. Poor Ralph made no nearer ap proach to conventional beauty as he advanced in life, and the now apparently complete loss of his health had done little to mitigate the natural oddity of his person. Blighted and battered, but still responsive and still ironic, his face was like a lighted lantern patched with paper and unsteadily held; his thin whisker languished upon a lean cheek; the exorbitant curve of his nose defined itself more sharply. Lean he was altogether, lean and long and loose-jointed; an accidental cohesion of relaxed angles. His brown velvet jacket had become perennial; his hands had fixed themselves in his pockets; he shambled and stumbled and shuffled in a manner that denoted great physical helplessness. It was perhaps this whimsical gait that helped to mark his character more than ever as that of the humorous invalid—the invalid for whom even his own disabilities are part of the general joke. They might well indeed with Ralph have been the chief cause of the want of seriousness marking his view of a world in which the reason for his own continued presence was past finding out. Isabel had grown fond of his ugliness; his awkwardness had become dear to her. They had been sweetened by association; they struck her as the very terms on which it had been given him to be charming. He was so charming that her sense of his being ill had hitherto had a sort of comfort in it; the state of his health had seemed not a limitation, but a kind of intellectual advantage; it absolved him from all professional and official emotions and left him the luxury of being exclusively personal. The personality so resulting was delightful; he had remained proof against the staleness of disease; he had had to consent to be deplorably ill, yet had somehow escaped being formally sick. Such had been the girl's impression of her cousin; and when she had pitied him it was only on reflection. As she reflected a good deal she had allowed him a certain amount of compassion; but she always had a dread of wasting that essence—a precious article, worth more to the giver than to any one else. Now, however, it took no great sensibility to feel that poor Ralph's tenure of life was less elastic than it should be. He was a bright, free, generous spirit, he had all the illumination of wisdom and none of its pedantry, and yet he was distressfully dying.




Isabel noted afresh that life was certainly hard for some people, and she felt a delicate glow of shame as she thought how easy it now promised to become for herself. She was prepared to learn that Ralph was not pleased with her engagement; but she was not prepared, in spite of her affection for him, to let this fact spoil the situation. She was not even prepared, or so she thought, to resent his want of sympathy; for it would be his privilege—it would be indeed his natural line—to find fault with any step she might take toward marriage. One's cousin always pretended to hate one's husband; that was traditional, classical; it was a part of one's cousin's always pretending to adore one. Ralph was nothing if not critical; and though she would certainly, other things being equal, have been as glad to marry to please him as to please any one, it would be absurd to regard as important that her choice should square with his views. What were his views after all? He had pretended to believe she had better have married Lord Warburton; but this was only because she had refused that excellent man. If she had accepted him Ralph would certainly have taken another tone; he always took the opposite. You could criticise any marriage; it was the essence of a marriage to be open to criticism. How well she herself, should she only give her mind to it, might criticise this union of her own! She had other employment, however, and Ralph was welcome to relieve her of the care. Isabel was prepared to be most patient and most indulgent. He must have seen that, and this made it the more odd he should say nothing. After three days had elapsed without his speaking our young woman wearied of waiting; dislike it as he would, he might at least go through the form. We, who know more about poor Ralph than his cousin, may easily believe that during the hours that followed his arrival at Palazzo Crescentini he had privately gone through many forms. His mother had literally greeted him with the great news, which had been even more sensibly chilling than Mrs. Touchett's maternal kiss. Ralph was shocked and humiliated; his calculations had been false and the person in the world in whom he was most interested was lost. He drifted about the house like a rudderless vessel in a rocky stream, or sat in the garden of the palace on a great cane chair, his long legs extended, his head thrown back and his hat pulled over his eyes. He felt cold about the heart; he had never liked anything less. What could he do, what could he say? If the girl were irreclaimable could he pretend to like it? To attempt to reclaim her was permissible only if the attempt should succeed. To try to persuade her of anything sordid or sinister in the man to whose deep art she had succumbed would be decently discreet only in the event of her being persuaded. Otherwise he should simply have damned himself. It cost him an equal effort to speak his thought and to dissemble; he could neither assent with sincerity nor protest with hope. Meanwhile he knew—or rather he supposed—that the affianced pair were daily renewing their mutual vows. Osmond at this moment showed himself little at Palazzo Crescentini; but Isabel met him every day elsewhere, as she was free to do after their engagement had been made public. She had taken a carriage by the month, so as not to be indebted to her aunt for the means of pursuing a course of which Mrs. Touchett disapproved, and she drove in the morning to the Cascine. This suburban wilderness, during the early hours, was void of all intruders, and our young lady, joined by her lover in its quietest part, strolled with him a while through the grey Italian shade and listened to the nightingales."|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"
"ap 10:30"|"half-past ten"|"""Is it that Mr. Osmond isn't rich? Is that what you're talking about?"" Isabel asked.




""He has no money; he has no name; he has no importance. I value such things and I have the courage to say it; I think they're very precious. Many other people think the same, and they show it. But they give some other reason.""




Isabel hesitated a little. ""I think I value everything that's valuable. I care very much for money, and that's why I wish Mr. Osmond to have a little.""




""Give it to him then; but marry some one else.""




""His name's good enough for me,"" the girl went on. ""It's a very pretty name. Have I such a fine one myself?""




""All the more reason you should improve on it. There are only a dozen American names. Do you marry him out of charity?""




""It was my duty to tell you, Aunt Lydia, but I don't think it's my duty to explain to you. Even if it were I shouldn't be able. So please don't remonstrate; in talking about it you have me at a disadvantage. I can't talk about it.""




""I don't remonstrate, I simply answer you: I must give some sign of intelligence. I saw it coming, and I said nothing. I never meddle.""




""You never do, and I'm greatly obliged to you. You've been very considerate.""




""It was not considerate—it was convenient,"" said Mrs. Touchett. ""But I shall talk to Madame Merle.""




""I don't see why you keep bringing her in. She has been a very good friend to me.""




""Possibly; but she has been a poor one to me.""




""What has she done to you?""




""She has deceived me. She had as good as promised me to prevent your engagement.""




""She couldn't have prevented it.""




""She can do anything; that's what I've always liked her for. I knew she could play any part; but I understood that she played them one by one. I didn't understand that she would play two at the same time.""




""I don't know what part she may have played to you,"" Isabel said; ""that's between yourselves. To me she has been honest and kind and devoted.""




""Devoted, of course; she wished you to marry her candidate. She told me she was watching you only in order to interpose.""




""She said that to please you,"" the girl answered; conscious, however, of the inadequacy of the explanation.




""To please me by deceiving me? She knows me better. Am I pleased to-day?""




""I don't think you're ever much pleased,"" Isabel was obliged to reply. ""If Madame Merle knew you would learn the truth what had she to gain by insincerity?""




""She gained time, as you see. While I waited for her to interfere you were marching away, and she was really beating the drum.""




""That's very well. But by your own admission you saw I was marching, and even if she had given the alarm you wouldn't have tried to stop me.""




""No, but some one else would.""




""Whom do you mean?"" Isabel asked, looking very hard at her aunt. Mrs. Touchett's little bright eyes, active as they usually were, sustained her gaze rather than returned it. ""Would you have listened to Ralph?""




""Not if he had abused Mr. Osmond.""




""Ralph doesn't abuse people; you know that perfectly. He cares very much for you.""




""I know he does,"" said Isabel; ""and I shall feel the value of it now, for he knows that whatever I do I do with reason.""




""He never believed you would do this. I told him you were capable of it, and he argued the other way.""




""He did it for the sake of argument,"" the girl smiled. ""You don't accuse him of having deceived you; why should you accuse Madame Merle?""




""He never pretended he'd prevent it.""




""I'm glad of that!"" cried Isabel gaily. ""I wish very much,"" she presently added, ""that when he comes you'd tell him first of my engagement.""




""Of course I'll mention it,"" said Mrs. Touchett. ""I shall say nothing more to you about it, but I give you notice I shall talk to others.""




""That's as you please. I only meant that it's rather better the announcement should come from you than from me.""




""I quite agree with you; it's much more proper!"" And on this the aunt and the niece went to breakfast, where Mrs. Touchett, as good as her word, made no allusion to Gilbert Osmond. After an interval of silence, however, she asked her companion from whom she had received a visit an hour before.




""From an old friend—an American gentleman,"" Isabel said with a colour in her cheek.




""An American gentleman of course. It's only an American gentleman who calls at ten o'clock in the morning.""

This suburban wilderness, during the early hours, was void of all intruders, and our young lady, joined by her lover in its quietest part, strolled with him a while through the grey Italian shade and listened to the nightingales."|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"
12:00|noontide|"One morning, on her return from her drive, some half-hour before luncheon, she quitted her vehicle in the court of the palace and, instead of ascending the great staircase, crossed the court, passed beneath another archway and entered the garden. A sweeter spot at this moment could not have been imagined. The stillness of noontide hung over it, and the warm shade, enclosed and still, made bowers like spacious caves. Ralph was sitting there in the clear gloom, at the base of a statue of Terpsichore—a dancing nymph with taper fingers and inflated draperies in the manner of Bernini; the extreme relaxation of his attitude suggested at first to Isabel that he was asleep. Her light footstep on the grass had not roused him, and before turning away she stood for a moment looking at him. During this instant he opened his eyes; upon which she sat down on a rustic chair that matched with his own. Though in her irritation she had accused him of indifference she was not blind to the fact that he had visibly had something to brood over. But she had explained his air of absence partly by the languor of his increased weakness, partly by worries connected with the property inherited from his father—the fruit of eccentric arrangements of which Mrs. Touchett disapproved and which, as she had told Isabel, now encountered opposition from the other partners in the bank. He ought to have gone to England, his mother said, instead of coming to Florence; he had not been there for months, and took no more interest in the bank than in the state of Patagonia.




""I'm sorry I waked you,"" Isabel said; ""you look too tired.""




""I feel too tired. But I was not asleep. I was thinking of you.""




""Are you tired of that?""




""Very much so. It leads to nothing. The road's long and I never arrive.""




""What do you wish to arrive at?"" she put to him, closing her parasol.




""At the point of expressing to myself properly what I think of your engagement.""




""Don't think too much of it,"" she lightly returned.




""Do you mean that it's none of my business?""




""Beyond a certain point, yes.""




""That's the point I want to fix. I had an idea you may have found me wanting in good manners. I've never congratulated you.""




""Of course I've noticed that. I wondered why you were silent.""




""There have been a good many reasons. I'll tell you now,"" Ralph said. He pulled off his hat and laid it on the ground; then he sat looking at her. He leaned back under the protection of Bernini, his head against his marble pedestal, his arms dropped on either side of him, his hands laid upon the rests of his wide chair. He looked awkward, uncomfortable; he hesitated long. Isabel said nothing; when people were embarrassed she was usually sorry for them, but she was determined not to help Ralph to utter a word that should not be to the honour of her high decision. ""I think I've hardly got over my surprise,"" he went on at last. ""You were the last person I expected to see caught.""




""I don't know why you call it caught.""




""Because you're going to be put into a cage.""




""If I like my cage, that needn't trouble you,"" she answered.




""That's what I wonder at; that's what I've been thinking of.""




""If you've been thinking you may imagine how I've thought! I'm satisfied that I'm doing well.""




""You must have changed immensely. A year ago you valued your liberty beyond everything. You wanted only to see life.""




""I've seen it,"" said Isabel. ""It doesn't look to me now, I admit, such an inviting expanse.""




""I don't pretend it is; only I had an idea that you took a genial view of it and wanted to survey the whole field.""




""I've seen that one can't do anything so general. One must choose a corner and cultivate that.""




""That's what I think. And one must choose as good a corner as possible. I had no idea, all winter, while I read your delightful letters, that you were choosing. You said nothing about it, and your silence put me off my guard.""




""It was not a matter I was likely to write to you about. Besides, I knew nothing of the future. It has all come lately. If you had been on your guard, however,"" Isabel asked, ""what would you have done?""




""I should have said 'Wait a little longer.'""




""Wait for what?""




""Well, for a little more light,"" said Ralph with rather an absurd smile, while his hands found their way into his pockets.




""Where should my light have come from? From you?""




""I might have struck a spark or two.""




Isabel had drawn off her gloves; she smoothed them out as they lay upon her knee. The mildness of this movement was accidental, for her expression was not conciliatory. ""You're beating about the bush, Ralph. You wish to say you don't like Mr. Osmond, and yet you're afraid.""




""Willing to wound and yet afraid to strike? I'm willing to wound HIM, yes—but not to wound you. I'm afraid of you, not of him. If you marry him it won't be a fortunate way for me to have spoken.""




""IF I marry him! Have you had any expectation of dissuading me?""




""Of course that seems to you too fatuous.""




""No,"" said Isabel after a little; ""it seems to me too touching.""




""That's the same thing. It makes me so ridiculous that you pity me.""




She stroked out her long gloves again. ""I know you've a great affection for me. I can't get rid of that.""




""For heaven's sake don't try. Keep that well in sight. It will convince you how intensely I want you to do well.""




""And how little you trust me!""




There was a moment's silence; the warm noontide seemed to listen. ""I trust you, but I don't trust him,"" said Ralph.




She raised her eyes and gave him a wide, deep look. ""You've said it now, and I'm glad you've made it so clear. But you'll suffer by it.""




""Not if you're just.""




""I'm very just,"" said Isabel. ""What better proof of it can there be than that I'm not angry with you? I don't know what's the matter with me, but I'm not. I was when you began, but it has passed away. Perhaps I ought to be angry, but Mr. Osmond wouldn't think so. He wants me to know everything; that's what I like him for. You've nothing to gain, I know that. I've never been so nice to you, as a girl, that you should have much reason for wishing me to remain one. You give very good advice; you've often done so. No, I'm very quiet; I've always believed in your wisdom,"" she went on, boasting of her quietness, yet speaking with a kind of contained exaltation. It was her passionate desire to be just; it touched Ralph to the heart, affected him like a caress from a creature he had injured. He wished to interrupt, to reassure her; for a moment he was absurdly inconsistent; he would have retracted what he had said. But she gave him no chance; she went on, having caught a glimpse, as she thought, of the heroic line and desiring to advance in that direction. ""I see you've some special idea; I should like very much to hear it. I'm sure it's disinterested; I feel that. It seems a strange thing to argue about, and of course I ought to tell you definitely that if you expect to dissuade me you may give it up. You'll not move me an inch; it's too late. As you say, I'm caught. Certainly it won't be pleasant for you to remember this, but your pain will be in your own thoughts. I shall never reproach you.""




""I don't think you ever will,"" said Ralph. ""It's not in the least the sort of marriage I thought you'd make.""




""What sort of marriage was that, pray?""




""Well, I can hardly say. I hadn't exactly a positive view of it, but I had a negative. I didn't think you'd decide for—well, for that type.""




""What's the matter with Mr. Osmond's type, if it be one? His being so independent, so individual, is what I most see in him,"" the girl declared. ""What do you know against him? You know him scarcely at all.""




""Yes,"" Ralph said, ""I know him very little, and I confess I haven't facts and items to prove him a villain. But all the same I can't help feeling that you're running a grave risk.""




""Marriage is always a grave risk, and his risk's as grave as mine.""




""That's his affair! If he's afraid, let him back out. I wish to God he would.""




Isabel reclined in her chair, folding her arms and gazing a while at her cousin. ""I don't think I understand you,"" she said at last coldly. ""I don't know what you're talking about.""




""I believed you'd marry a man of more importance.""




Cold, I say, her tone had been, but at this a colour like a flame leaped into her face. ""Of more importance to whom? It seems to me enough that one's husband should be of importance to one's self!""




Ralph blushed as well; his attitude embarrassed him. Physically speaking he proceeded to change it; he straightened himself, then leaned forward, resting a hand on each knee. He fixed his eyes on the ground; he had an air of the most respectful deliberation.




""I'll tell you in a moment what I mean,"" he presently said. He felt agitated, intensely eager; now that he had opened the discussion he wished to discharge his mind. But he wished also to be superlatively gentle.




Isabel waited a little—then she went on with majesty. ""In everything that makes one care for people Mr. Osmond is pre-eminent. There may be nobler natures, but I've never had the pleasure of meeting one. Mr. Osmond's is the finest I know; he's good enough for me, and interesting enough, and clever enough. I'm far more struck with what he has and what he represents than with what he may lack.""




""I had treated myself to a charming vision of your future,"" Ralph observed without answering this; ""I had amused myself with planning out a high destiny for you. There was to be nothing of this sort in it. You were not to come down so easily or so soon.""




""Come down, you say?""




""Well, that renders my sense of what has happened to you. You seemed to me to be soaring far up in the blue—to be, sailing in the bright light, over the heads of men. Suddenly some one tosses up a faded rosebud—a missile that should never have reached you—and straight you drop to the ground. It hurts me,"" said Ralph audaciously, ""hurts me as if I had fallen myself!""




The look of pain and bewilderment deepened in his companion's face. ""I don't understand you in the least,"" she repeated. ""You say you amused yourself with a project for my career—I don't understand that. Don't amuse yourself too much, or I shall think you're doing it at my expense.""




Ralph shook his head. ""I'm not afraid of your not believing that I've had great ideas for you.""




""What do you mean by my soaring and sailing?"" she pursued.




""I've never moved on a higher plane than I'm moving on now. There's nothing higher for a girl than to marry a—a person she likes,"" said poor Isabel, wandering into the didactic.




""It's your liking the person we speak of that I venture to criticise, my dear cousin. I should have said that the man for you would have been a more active, larger, freer sort of nature."" Ralph hesitated, then added: ""I can't get over the sense that Osmond is somehow—well, small."" He had uttered the last word with no great assurance; he was afraid she would flash out again. But to his surprise she was quiet; she had the air of considering.




""Small?"" She made it sound immense.




""I think he's narrow, selfish. He takes himself so seriously!""




""He has a great respect for himself; I don't blame him for that,"" said Isabel. ""It makes one more sure to respect others.""




Ralph for a moment felt almost reassured by her reasonable tone.




""Yes, but everything is relative; one ought to feel one's relation to things—to others. I don't think Mr. Osmond does that.""




""I've chiefly to do with his relation to me. In that he's excellent.""




""He's the incarnation of taste,"" Ralph went on, thinking hard how he could best express Gilbert Osmond's sinister attributes without putting himself in the wrong by seeming to describe him coarsely. He wished to describe him impersonally, scientifically. ""He judges and measures, approves and condemns, altogether by that.""




""It's a happy thing then that his taste should be exquisite.""




""It's exquisite, indeed, since it has led him to select you as his bride. But have you ever seen such a taste—a really exquisite one—ruffled?""




""I hope it may never be my fortune to fail to gratify my husband's.""




At these words a sudden passion leaped to Ralph's lips. ""Ah, that's wilful, that's unworthy of you! You were not meant to be measured in that way—you were meant for something better than to keep guard over the sensibilities of a sterile dilettante!""




Isabel rose quickly and he did the same, so that they stood for a moment looking at each other as if he had flung down a defiance or an insult. But ""You go too far,"" she simply breathed.




""I've said what I had on my mind—and I've said it because I love you!""




Isabel turned pale: was he too on that tiresome list? She had a sudden wish to strike him off. ""Ah then, you're not disinterested!""




""I love you, but I love without hope,"" said Ralph quickly, forcing a smile and feeling that in that last declaration he had expressed more than he intended.




Isabel moved away and stood looking into the sunny stillness of the garden; but after a little she turned back to him. ""I'm afraid your talk then is the wildness of despair! I don't understand it —but it doesn't matter. I'm not arguing with you; it's impossible I should; I've only tried to listen to you. I'm much obliged to you for attempting to explain,"" she said gently, as if the anger with which she had just sprung up had already subsided. ""It's very good of you to try to warn me, if you're really alarmed; but I won't promise to think of what you've said: I shall forget it as soon as possible. Try and forget it yourself; you've done your duty, and no man can do more. I can't explain to you what I feel, what I believe, and I wouldn't if I could."" She paused a moment and then went on with an inconsequence that Ralph observed even in the midst of his eagerness to discover some symptom of concession. ""I can't enter into your idea of Mr. Osmond; I can't do it justice, because I see him in quite another way. He's not important—no, he's not important; he's a man to whom importance is supremely indifferent. If that's what you mean when you call him 'small,' then he's as small as you please. I call that l large—it's the largest thing I know. I won't pretend to argue with you about a person I'm going to marry,"" Isabel repeated. ""I'm not in the least concerned to defend Mr. Osmond; he's not so weak as to need my defence. I should think it would seem strange even to yourself that I should talk of him so quietly and coldly, as if he were any one else. I wouldn't talk of him at all to any one but you; and you, after what you've said—I may just answer you once for all. Pray, would you wish me to make a mercenary marriage—what they call a marriage of ambition? I've only one ambition—to be free to follow out a good feeling. I had others once, but they've passed away. Do you complain of Mr. Osmond because he's not rich? That's just what I like him for. I've fortunately money enough; I've never felt so thankful for it as to-day. There have been moments when I should like to go and kneel down by your father's grave: he did perhaps a better thing than he knew when he put it into my power to marry a poor man—a man who has borne his poverty with such dignity, with such indifference. Mr. Osmond has never scrambled nor struggled—he has cared for no worldly prize. If that's to be narrow, if that's to be selfish, then it's very well. I'm not frightened by such words, I'm not even displeased; I'm only sorry that you should make a mistake. Others might have done so, but I'm surprised that you should. You might know a gentleman when you see one—you might know a fine mind. Mr. Osmond makes no mistakes! He knows everything, he understands everything, he has the kindest, gentlest, highest spirit. You've got hold of some false idea. It's a pity, but I can't help it; it regards you more than me."" Isabel paused a moment, looking at her cousin with an eye illumined by a sentiment which contradicted the careful calmness of her manner—a mingled sentiment, to which the angry pain excited by his words and the wounded pride of having needed to justify a choice of which she felt only the nobleness and purity, equally contributed. Though she paused Ralph said nothing; he saw she had more to say. She was grand, but she was highly solicitous; she was indifferent, but she was all in a passion. ""What sort of a person should you have liked me to marry?"" she asked suddenly. ""You talk about one's soaring and sailing, but if one marries at all one touches the earth. One has human feelings and needs, one has a heart in one's bosom, and one must marry a particular individual. Your mother has never forgiven me for not having come to a better understanding with Lord Warburton, and she's horrified at my contenting myself with a person who has none of his great advantages—no property, no title, no honours, no houses, nor lands, nor position, nor reputation, nor brilliant belongings of any sort. It's the total absence of all these things that pleases me. Mr. Osmond's simply a very lonely, a very cultivated and a very honest man—he's not a prodigious proprietor.""




Ralph had listened with great attention, as if everything she said merited deep consideration; but in truth he was only half thinking of the things she said, he was for the rest simply accommodating himself to the weight of his total impression—the impression of her ardent good faith. She was wrong, but she believed; she was deluded, but she was dismally consistent. It was wonderfully characteristic of her that, having invented a fine theory, about Gilbert Osmond, she loved him not for what he really possessed, but for his very poverties dressed out as honours. Ralph remembered what he had said to his father about wishing to put it into her power to meet the requirements of her imagination. He had done so, and the girl had taken full advantage of the luxury. Poor Ralph felt sick; he felt ashamed. Isabel had uttered her last words with a low solemnity of conviction which virtually terminated the discussion, and she closed it formally by turning away and walking back to the house. Ralph walked beside her, and they passed into the court together and reached the big staircase. Here he stopped and Isabel paused, turning on him a face of elation—absolutely and perversely of gratitude. His opposition had made her own conception of her conduct clearer to her. ""Shall you not come up to breakfast?"" she asked.




""No; I want no breakfast; I'm not hungry.""




""You ought to eat,"" said the girl; ""you live on air.""




""I do, very much, and I shall go back into the garden and take another mouthful. I came thus far simply to say this. I told you last year that if you were to get into trouble I should feel terribly sold. That's how I feel to-day.""




""Do you think I'm in trouble?""




""One's in trouble when one's in error.""




""Very well,"" said Isabel; ""I shall never complain of my trouble to you!"" And she moved up the staircase.




Ralph, standing there with his hands in his pockets, followed her with his eyes; then the lurking chill of the high-walled court struck him and made him shiver, so that he returned to the garden to breakfast on the Florentine sunshine."|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"
"ap 05:15"|"quarter past five"|"The other rooms meanwhile had become conscious of the arrival of Madame Merle, who, wherever she went, produced an impression when she entered. How she did it the most attentive spectator could not have told you, for she neither spoke loud, nor laughed profusely, nor moved rapidly, nor dressed with splendour, nor appealed in any appreciable manner to the audience. Large, fair, smiling, serene, there was something in her very tranquillity that diffused itself, and when people looked round it was because of a sudden quiet. On this occasion she had done the quietest thing she could do; after embracing Mrs. Osmond, which was more striking, she had sat down on a small sofa to commune with the master of the house. There was a brief exchange of commonplaces between these two—they always paid, in public, a certain formal tribute to the commonplace—and then Madame Merle, whose eyes had been wandering, asked if little Mr. Rosier had come this evening.




""He came nearly an hour ago—but he has disappeared,"" Osmond said.




""And where's Pansy?""




""In the other room. There are several people there.""




""He's probably among them,"" said Madame Merle.




""Do you wish to see him?"" Osmond asked in a provokingly pointless tone.




Madame Merle looked at him a moment; she knew each of his tones to the eighth of a note. ""Yes, I should like to say to him that I've told you what he wants, and that it interests you but feebly.""




""Don't tell him that. He'll try to interest me more—which is exactly what I don't want. Tell him I hate his proposal.""




""But you don't hate it.""




""It doesn't signify; I don't love it. I let him see that, myself, this evening; I was rude to him on purpose. That sort of thing's a great bore. There's no hurry.""




""I'll tell him that you'll take time and think it over.""




""No, don't do that. He'll hang on.""




""If I discourage him he'll do the same.""




""Yes, but in the one case he'll try to talk and explain—which would be exceedingly tiresome. In the other he'll probably hold his tongue and go in for some deeper game. That will leave me quiet. I hate talking with a donkey.""




""Is that what you call poor Mr. Rosier?""




""Oh, he's a nuisance—with his eternal majolica.""




Madame Merle dropped her eyes; she had a faint smile. ""He's a gentleman, he has a charming temper; and, after all, an income of forty thousand francs!""




""It's misery—'genteel' misery,"" Osmond broke in. ""It's not what I've dreamed of for Pansy.""




""Very good then. He has promised me not to speak to her.""




""Do you believe him?"" Osmond asked absentmindedly.




""Perfectly. Pansy has thought a great deal about him; but I don't suppose you consider that that matters.""




""I don't consider it matters at all; but neither do I believe she has thought of him.""




""That opinion's more convenient,"" said Madame Merle quietly.




""Has she told you she's in love with him?""




""For what do you take her? And for what do you take me?"" Madame Merle added in a moment.




Osmond had raised his foot and was resting his slim ankle on the other knee; he clasped his ankle in his hand familiarly—his long, fine forefinger and thumb could make a ring for it—and gazed a while before him. ""This kind of thing doesn't find me unprepared. It's what I educated her for. It was all for this—that when such a case should come up she should do what I prefer.""




""I'm not afraid that she'll not do it.""




""Well then, where's the hitch?""




""I don't see any. But, all the same, I recommend you not to get rid of Mr. Rosier. Keep him on hand; he may be useful.""




""I can't keep him. Keep him yourself.""




""Very good; I'll put him into a corner and allow him so much a day."" Madame Merle had, for the most part, while they talked, been glancing about her; it was her habit in this situation, just as it was her habit to interpose a good many blank-looking pauses. A long drop followed the last words I have quoted; and before it had ended she saw Pansy come out of the adjoining room, followed by Edward Rosier. The girl advanced a few steps and then stopped and stood looking at Madame Merle and at her father.




""He has spoken to her,"" Madame Merle went on to Osmond.




Her companion never turned his head. ""So much for your belief in his promises. He ought to be horsewhipped.""




""He intends to confess, poor little man!""




Osmond got up; he had now taken a sharp look at his daughter. ""It doesn't matter,"" he murmured, turning away.




Pansy after a moment came up to Madame Merle with her little manner of unfamiliar politeness. This lady's reception of her was not more intimate; she simply, as she rose from the sofa, gave her a friendly smile.




""You're very late,"" the young creature gently said.




""My dear child, I'm never later than I intend to be.""




Madame Merle had not got up to be gracious to Pansy; she moved toward Edward Rosier. He came to meet her and, very quickly, as if to get it off his mind, ""I've spoken to her!"" he whispered.




""I know it, Mr. Rosier.""




""Did she tell you?""




""Yes, she told me. Behave properly for the rest of the evening, and come and see me to-morrow at a quarter past five."" She was severe, and in the manner in which she turned her back to him there was a degree of contempt which caused him to mutter a decent imprecation.




He had no intention of speaking to Osmond; it was neither the time nor the place. But he instinctively wandered toward Isabel, who sat talking with an old lady. He sat down on the other side of her; the old lady was Italian, and Rosier took for granted she understood no English. ""You said just now you wouldn't help me,"" he began to Mrs. Osmond. ""Perhaps you'll feel differently when you know—when you know—!""




Isabel met his hesitation. ""When I know what?""




""That she's all right.""




""What do you mean by that?""




""Well, that we've come to an understanding.""




""She's all wrong,"" said Isabel. ""It won't do.""




Poor Rosier gazed at her half-pleadingly, half-angrily; a sudden flush testified to his sense of injury. ""I've never been treated so,"" he said. ""What is there against me, after all? That's not the way I'm usually considered. I could have married twenty times.""




""It's a pity you didn't. I don't mean twenty times, but once, comfortably,"" Isabel added, smiling kindly. ""You're not rich enough for Pansy.""




""She doesn't care a straw for one's money.""




""No, but her father does.""




""Ah yes, he has proved that!"" cried the young man.




Isabel got up, turning away from him, leaving her old lady without ceremony; and he occupied himself for the next ten minutes in pretending to look at Gilbert Osmond's collection of miniatures, which were neatly arranged on a series of small velvet screens. But he looked without seeing; his cheek burned; he was too full of his sense of injury. It was certain that he had never been treated that way before; he was not used to being thought not good enough. He knew how good he was, and if such a fallacy had not been so pernicious he could have laughed at it. He searched again for Pansy, but she had disappeared, and his main desire was now to get out of the house. Before doing so he spoke once more to Isabel; it was not agreeable to him to reflect that he had just said a rude thing to her—the only point that would now justify a low view of him.




""I referred to Mr. Osmond as I shouldn't have done, a while ago,"" he began. ""But you must remem ber my situation.""




""I don't remember what you said,"" she answered coldly.




""Ah, you're offended, and now you'll never help me.""




She was silent an instant, and then with a change of tone: ""It's not that I won't; I simply can't!"" Her manner was almost passionate.




""If you could, just a little, I'd never again speak of your husband save as an angel."""|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o'clock"|"Osmond touched on this matter that evening for the first time; coming very late into the drawing-room, where she was sitting alone. They had spent the evening at home, and Pansy had gone to bed; he himself had been sitting since dinner in a small apartment in which he had arranged his books and which he called his study. At ten o'clock Lord Warburton had come in, as he always did when he knew from Isabel that she was to be at home; he was going somewhere else and he sat for half an hour. Isabel, after asking him for news of Ralph, said very little to him, on purpose; she wished him to talk with her stepdaughter. She pretended to read; she even went after a little to the piano; she asked herself if she mightn't leave the room. She had come little by little to think well of the idea of Pansy's becoming the wife of the master of beautiful Lockleigh, though at first it had not presented itself in a manner to excite her enthusiasm. Madame Merle, that afternoon, had applied the match to an accumulation of inflammable material. When Isabel was unhappy she always looked about her—partly from impulse and partly by theory—for some form of positive exertion. She could never rid herself of the sense that unhappiness was a state of disease—of suffering as opposed to doing. To ""do""—it hardly mattered what—would therefore be an escape, perhaps in some degree a remedy. Besides, she wished to convince herself that she had done everything possible to content her husband; she was determined not to be haunted by visions of his wife's limpness under appeal. It would please him greatly to see Pansy married to an English nobleman, and justly please him, since this nobleman was so sound a character. It seemed to Isabel that if she could make it her duty to bring about such an event she should play the part of a good wife. She wanted to be that; she wanted to be able to believe sincerely, and with proof of it, that she had been that. Then such an undertaking had other recommendations. It would occupy her, and she desired occupation. It would even amuse her, and if she could really amuse herself she perhaps might be saved. Lastly, it would be a service to Lord Warburton, who evidently pleased himself greatly with the charming girl. It was a little ""weird"" he should—being what he was; but there was no accounting for such impressions. Pansy might captivate any one—any one at least but Lord Warburton. Isabel would have thought her too small, too slight, perhaps even too artificial for that. There was always a little of the doll about her, and that was not what he had been looking for. Still, who could say what men ever were looking for? They looked for what they found; they knew what pleased them only when they saw it. No theory was valid in such matters, and nothing was more unaccountable or more natural than anything else. If he had cared for her  it might seem odd he should care for Pansy, who was so different; but he had not cared for her so much as he had supposed. Or if he had, he had completely got over it, and it was natural that, as that affair had failed, he should think something of quite another sort might succeed. Enthusiasm, as I say, had not come at first to Isabel, but it came to-day and made her feel almost happy. It was astonishing what happiness she could still find in the idea of procuring a pleasure for her husband. It was a pity, however, that Edward Rosier had crossed their path!"|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"
"ap 04:00"|four|"She could live it over again, the incredulous terror with which she had taken the measure of her dwelling. Between those four walls she had lived ever since; they were to surround her for the rest of her life. It was the house of darkness, the house of dumbness, the house of suffocation. Osmond's beautiful mind gave it neither light nor air; Osmond's beautiful mind indeed seemed to peep down from a small high window and mock at her. Of course it had not been physical suffering; for physical suffering there might have been a remedy. She could come and go; she had her liberty; her husband was perfectly polite. He took himself so seriously; it was something appalling. Under all his culture, his cleverness, his amenity, under his good-nature, his facility, his knowledge of life, his egotism lay hidden like a serpent in a bank of flowers. She had taken him seriously, but she had not taken him so seriously as that. How could she—especially when she had known him better? She was to think of him as he thought of himself—as the first gentleman in Europe. So it was that she had thought of him at first, and that indeed was the reason she had married him. But when she began to see what it implied she drew back; there was more in the bond than she had meant to put her name to. It implied a sovereign contempt for every one but some three or four very exalted people whom he envied, and for everything in the world but half a dozen ideas of his own. That was very well; she would have gone with him even there a long distance; for he pointed out to her so much of the baseness and shabbiness of life, opened her eyes so wide to the stupidity, the depravity, the ignorance of mankind, that she had been properly impressed with the infinite vulgarity of things and of the virtue of keeping one's self unspotted by it. But this base, if noble world, it appeared, was after all what one was to live for; one was to keep it forever in one's eye, in order not to enlighten or convert or redeem it, but to extract from it some recognition of one's own superiority. On the one hand it was despicable, but on the other it afforded a standard. Osmond had talked to Isabel about his renunciation, his indifference, the ease with which he dispensed with the usual aids to success; and all this had seemed to her admirable. She had thought it a grand indifference, an exquisite independence. But indifference was really the last of his qualities; she had never seen any one who thought so much of others. For herself, avowedly, the world had always interested her and the study of her fellow creatures been her constant passion. She would have been willing, however, to renounce all her curiosities and sympathies for the sake of a personal life, if the person concerned had only been able to make her believe it was a gain! This at least was her present conviction; and the thing certainly would have been easier than to care for society as Osmond cared for it.




He was unable to live without it, and she saw that he had never really done so; he had looked at it out of his window even when he appeared to be most detached from it. He had his ideal, just as she had tried to have hers; only it was strange that people should seek for justice in such different quarters. His ideal was a conception of high prosperity and propriety, of the aristocratic life, which she now saw that he deemed himself always, in essence at least, to have led. He had never lapsed from it for an hour; he would never have recovered from the shame of doing so. That again was very well; here too she would have agreed; but they attached such different ideas, such different associations and desires, to the same formulas. Her notion of the aristocratic life was simply the union of great knowledge with great liberty; the knowledge would give one a sense of duty and the liberty a sense of enjoyment. But for Osmond it was altogether a thing of forms, a conscious, calculated attitude. He was fond of the old, the consecrated, the transmitted; so was she, but she pretended to do what she chose with it. He had an immense esteem for tradition; he had told her once that the best thing in the world was to have it, but that if one was so unfortunate as not to have it one must immediately proceed to make it. She knew that he meant by this that she hadn't it, but that he was better off; though from what source he had derived his traditions she never learned. He had a very large collection of them, however; that was very certain, and after a little she began to see. The great thing was to act in accordance with them; the great thing not only for him but for her. Isabel had an undefined conviction that to serve for another person than their proprietor traditions must be of a thoroughly superior kind; but she nevertheless assented to this intimation that she too must march to the stately music that floated down from unknown periods in her husband's past; she who of old had been so free of step, so desultory, so devious, so much the reverse of processional. There were certain things they must do, a certain posture they must take, certain people they must know and not know. When she saw this rigid system close about her, draped though it was in pictured tapestries, that sense of darkness and suffocation of which I have spoken took possession of her; she seemed shut up with an odour of mould and decay. She had resisted of course; at first very humorously, ironically, tenderly; then, as the situation grew more serious, eagerly, passionately, pleadingly. She had pleaded the cause of freedom, of doing as they chose, of not caring for the aspect and denomination of their life—the cause of other instincts and longings, of quite another ideal.




Then it was that her husband's personality, touched as it never had been, stepped forth and stood erect. The things she had said were answered only by his scorn, and she could see he was ineffably ashamed of her. What did he think of her—that she was base, vulgar, ignoble? He at least knew now that she had no traditions! It had not been in hsis prevision of things that she should reveal such flatness; her sentiments were worthy of a radical newspaper or a Unitarian preacher. The real offence, as she ultimately perceived, was her having a mind of her own at all. Her mind was to be his—attached to his own like a small garden-plot to a deer-park. He would rake the soil gently and water the flowers; he would weed the beds and gather an occasional nosegay. It would be a pretty piece of property for a proprietor already far-reaching. He didn't wish her to be stupid. On the contrary, it was because she was clever that she had pleased him. But he expected her intelligence to operate altogether in his favour, and so far from desiring her mind to be a blank he had flattered himself that it would be richly receptive. He had expected his wife to feel with him and for him, to enter into his opinions, his ambitions, his preferences; and Isabel was obliged to confess that this was no great insolence on the part of a man so accomplished and a husband originally at least so tender. But there were certain things she could never take in. To begin with, they were hideously unclean. She was not a daughter of the Puritans, but for all that she believed in such a thing as chastity and even as decency. It would appear that Osmond was far from doing anything of the sort; some of his traditions made her push back her skirts. Did all women have lovers? Did they all lie and even the best have their price? Were there only three or four that didn't deceive their husbands? When Isabel heard such things she felt a greater scorn for them than for the gossip of a village parlour—a scorn that kept its freshness in a very tainted air. There was the taint of her sister-in-law: did her husband judge only by the Countess Gemini? This lady very often lied, and she had practised deceptions that were not simply verbal. It was enough to find these facts assumed among Osmond's traditions—it was enough without giving them such a general extension. It was her scorn of his assumptions, it was this that made him draw himself up. He had plenty of contempt, and it was proper his wife should be as well furnished; but that she should turn the hot light of her disdain upon his own conception of things—this was a danger he had not allowed for. He believed he should have regulated her emotions before she came to it; and Isabel could easily imagine how his ears had scorched on his discovering he had been too confident. When one had a wife who gave one that sensation there was nothing left but to hate her.




She was morally certain now that this feeling of hatred, which at first had been a refuge and a refreshment, had become the occupation and comfort of his life. The feeling was deep, because it was sincere; he had had the revelation that she could after all dispense with him. If to herself the idea was startling, if it presented itself at first as a kind of infidelity, a capacity for pollution, what infinite effect might it not be expected to have had upon HIM? It was very simple; he despised her; she had no traditions and the moral horizon of a Unitarian minister. Poor Isabel, who had never been able to understand Unitarianism! This was the certitude she had been living with now for a time that she had ceased to measure. What was coming—what was before them? That was her constant question. What would he do—what ought SHE to do? When a man hated his wife what did it lead to? She didn't hate him, that she was sure of, for every little while she felt a passionate wish to give him a pleasant surprise. Very often, however, she felt afraid, and it used to come over her, as I have intimated, that she had deceived him at the very first. They were strangely married, at all events, and it was a horrible life. Until that morning he had scarcely spoken to her for a week; his manner was as dry as a burned-out fire. She knew there was a special reason; he was displeased at Ralph Touchett's staying on in Rome. He thought she saw too much of her cousin—he had told her a week before it was indecent she should go to him at his hotel. He would have said more than this if Ralph's invalid state had not appeared to make it brutal to denounce him; but having had to contain himself had only deepened his disgust. Isabel read all this as she would have read the hour on the clock-face; she was as perfectly aware that the sight of her interest in her cousin stirred her husband's rage as if Osmond had locked her into her room—which she was sure was what he wanted to do. It was her honest belief that on the whole she was not defiant, but she certainly couldn't pretend to be indifferent to Ralph. She believed he was dying at last and that she should never see him again, and this gave her a tenderness for him that she had never known before. Nothing was a pleasure to her now; how could anything be a pleasure to a woman who knew that she had thrown away her life? There was an everlasting weight on her heart—there was a livid light on everything. But Ralph's little visit was a lamp in the darkness; for the hour that she sat with him her ache for herself became somehow her ache for HIM. She felt to-day as if he had been her brother. She had never had a brother, but if she had and she were in trouble and he were dying, he would be dear to her as Ralph was. Ah yes, if Gilbert was jealous of her there was perhaps some reason; it didn't make Gilbert look better to sit for half an hour with Ralph. It was not that they talked of him—it was not that she complained. His name was never uttered between them. It was simply that Ralph was generous and that her husband was not. There was something in Ralph's talk, in his smile, in the mere fact of his being in Rome, that made the blasted circle round which she walked more spacious. He made her feel the good of the world; he made her feel what might have been. He was after all as intelligent as Osmond—quite apart from his being better. And thus it seemed to her an act of devotion to conceal her misery from him. She concealed it elaborately; she was perpetually, in their talk, hanging out curtains and before her again—it lived before her again,—it had never had time to die—that morning in the garden at Florence when he had warned her against Osmond. She had only to close her eyes to see the place, to hear his voice, to feel the warm, sweet air. How could he have known? What a mystery, what a wonder of wisdom! As intelligent as Gilbert? He was much more intelligent—to arrive at such a judgement as that. Gilbert had never been so deep, so just. She had told him then that from her at least he should never know if he was right; and this was what she was taking care of now. It gave her plenty to do; there was passion, exaltation, religion in it. Women find their religion sometimes in strange exercises, and Isabel at present, in playing a part before her cousin, had an idea that she was doing him a kindness. It would have been a kindness perhaps if he had been for a single instant a dupe. As it was, the kindness consisted mainly in trying to make him believe that he had once wounded her greatly and that the event had put him to shame, but that, as she was very generous and he was so ill, she bore him no grudge and even considerately forbore to flaunt her happiness in his face. Ralph smiled to himself, as he lay on his sofa, at this extraordinary form of consideration; but he forgave her for having forgiven him. She didn't wish him to have the pain of knowing she was unhappy: that was the great thing, and it didn't matter that such knowledge would rather have righted him.




For herself, she lingered in the soundless saloon long after the fire had gone out. There was no danger of her feeling the cold; she was in a fever. She heard the small hours strike, and then the great ones, but her vigil took no heed of time. Her mind, assailed by visions, was in a state of extraordinary activity, and her visions might as well come to her there, where she sat up to meet them, as on her pillow, to make a mockery of rest. As I have said, she believed she was not defiant, and what could be a better proof of it than that she should linger there half the night, trying to persuade herself that there was no reason why Pansy shouldn't be married as you would put a letter in the post-office? When the clock struck four she got up; she was going to bed at last, for the lamp had long since gone out and the candles burned down to their sockets. But even then she stopped again in the middle of the room and stood there gazing at a remembered vision—that of her husband and Madame Merle unconsciously and familiarly associated."|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"
03:00|"three o'clock in the morning"|"""No, I wasn't satisfied with it. It's an awkward sort of letter to write, you know. But I shall send it to-night.""




""At three o'clock in the morning?""




""I mean later, in the course of the day.""




""Very good. You still wish then to marry her?""




""Very much indeed.""




""Aren't you afraid that you'll bore her?"" And as her companion stared at this enquiry Isabel added: ""If she can't dance with you for half an hour how will she be able to dance with you for life?""




""Ah,"" said Lord Warburton readily, ""I'll let her dance with other people! About the cotillion, the fact is I thought that you—that you—""




""That I would do it with you? I told you I'd do nothing.""




""Exactly; so that while it's going on I might find some quiet corner where we may sit down and talk.""




""Oh,"" said Isabel gravely, ""you're much too considerate of me.""




When the cotillion came Pansy was found to have engaged herself, thinking, in perfect humility, that Lord Warburton had no intentions. Isabel recommended him to seek another partner, but he assured her that he would dance with no one but herself. As, however, she had, in spite of the remonstrances of her hostess, declined other invitations on the ground that she was not dancing at all, it was not possible for her to make an exception in Lord Warburton's favour.




""After all I don't care to dance,"" he said; ""it's a barbarous amusement: I'd much rather talk."" And he intimated that he had discovered exactly the corner he had been looking for—a quiet nook in one of the smaller rooms, where the music would come to them faintly and not interfere with conversation. Isabel had decided to let him carry out his idea; she wished to be satisfied. She wandered away from the ball-room with him, though she knew her husband desired she should not lose sight of his daughter. It was with his daughter's pretendant, however; that would make it right for Osmond. On her way out of the ball-room she came upon Edward Rosier, who was standing in a doorway, with folded arms, looking at the dance in the attitude of a young man without illusions. She stopped a moment and asked him if he were not dancing.




""Certainly not, if I can't dance with her !"" he answered."|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"
01:00|"one this morning"|"She came very soon to what she wished to speak of. ""I want you to answer me a question. It's about Lord Warburton.""




""I think I guess your question,"" Ralph answered from his arm-chair, out of which his thin legs protruded at greater length than ever.




""Very possibly you guess it. Please then answer it.""




""Oh, I don't say I can do that.""




""You're intimate with him,"" she said; ""you've a great deal of observation of him.""




""Very true. But think how he must dissimulate!""




""Why should he dissimulate? That's not his nature.""




""Ah, you must remember that the circumstances are peculiar,"" said Ralph with an air of private amusement.




""To a certain extent—yes. But is he really in love?""




""Very much, I think. I can make that out.""




""Ah!"" said Isabel with a certain dryness.




Ralph looked at her as if his mild hilarity had been touched with mystification. ""You say that as if you were disappointed.""




Isabel got up, slowly smoothing her gloves and eyeing them thoughtfully. ""It's after all no business of mine.""




""You're very philosophic,"" said her cousin. And then in a moment: ""May I enquire what you're talking about?""




Isabel stared. ""I thought you knew. Lord Warburton tells me he wants, of all things in the world, to marry Pansy. I've told you that before, without eliciting a comment from you. You might risk one this morning, I think. Is it your belief that he really cares for her?""




""Ah, for Pansy, no!"" cried Ralph very positively.




""But you said just now he did.""




Ralph waited a moment. ""That he cared for you, Mrs. Osmond.""




Isabel shook her head gravely. ""That's nonsense, you know.""




""Of course it is. But the nonsense is Warburton's, not mine.""




""That would be very tiresome."" She spoke, as she flattered herself, with much subtlety.




""I ought to tell you indeed,"" Ralph went on, ""that to me he has denied it.""




""It's very good of you to talk about it together! Has he also told you that he's in love with Pansy?""




""He has spoken very well of her—very properly. He has let me know, of course, that he thinks she would do very well at Lockleigh.""




""Does he really think it?""




""Ah, what Warburton really thinks—!"" said Ralph.




Isabel fell to smoothing her gloves again; they were long, loose gloves on which she could freely expend herself. Soon, however, she looked up, and then, ""Ah, Ralph, you give me no help!"" she cried abruptly and passionately.




It was the first time she had alluded to the need for help, and the words shook her cousin with their violence. He gave a long murmur of relief, of pity, of tenderness; it seemed to him that at last the gulf between them had been bridged. It was this that made him exclaim in a moment: ""How unhappy you must be!""




He had no sooner spoken than she recovered her self-possession, and the first use she made of it was to pretend she had not heard him. ""When I talk of your helping me I talk great nonsense,"" she said with a quick smile. ""The idea of my troubling you with my domestic embarrassments! The matter's very simple; Lord Warburton must get on by himself. I can't undertake to see him through.""




""He ought to succeed easily,"" said Ralph.




Isabel debated. ""Yes—but he has not always succeeded.""




""Very true. You know, however, how that always surprised me. Is Miss Osmond capable of giving us a surprise?""




""It will come from him, rather. I seem to see that after all he'll let the matter drop.""




""He'll do nothing dishonourable,"" said Ralph.




""I'm very sure of that. Nothing can be more honourable than for him to leave the poor child alone. She cares for another person, and it's cruel to attempt to bribe her by magnificent offers to give him up.""




""Cruel to the other person perhaps—the one she cares for. But Warburton isn't obliged to mind that.""




""No, cruel to her,"" said Isabel. ""She would be very unhappy if she were to allow herself to be persuaded to desert poor Mr. Rosier. That idea seems to amuse you; of course you're not in love with him. He has the merit—for Pansy—of being in love with Pansy. She can see at a glance that Lord Warburton isn't.""




""He'd be very good to her,"" said Ralph.




""He has been good to her already. Fortunately, however, he has not said a word to disturb her. He could come and bid her good-bye to-morrow with perfect propriety.""




""How would your husband like that?""




""Not at all; and he may be right in not liking it. Only he must obtain satisfaction himself.""




""Has he commissioned you to obtain it?"" Ralph ventured to ask.




""It was natural that as an old friend of Lord Warburton's—an older friend, that is, than Gilbert—I should take an interest in his intentions.""




""Take an interest in his renouncing them, you mean?""




Isabel hesitated, frowning a little. ""Let me understand. Are you pleading his cause?""




""Not in the least. I'm very glad he shouldn't become your stepdaughter's husband. It makes such a very queer relation to you!"" said Ralph, smiling. ""But I'm rather nervous lest your husband should think you haven't pushed him enough.""




Isabel found herself able to smile as well as he. ""He knows me well enough not to have expected me to push. He himself has no intention of pushing, I presume. I'm not afraid I shall not be able to justify myself!"" she said lightly.




Her mask had dropped for an instant, but she had put it on again, to Ralph's infinite disappointment. He had caught a glimpse of her natural face and he wished immensely to look into it. He had an almost savage desire to hear her complain of her husband—hear her say that she should be held accountable for Lord Warburton's defection. Ralph was certain that this was her situation; he knew by instinct, in advance, the form that in such an event Osmond's displeasure would take. It could only take the meanest and cruellest. He would have liked to warn Isabel of it—to let her see at least how he judged for her and how he knew. It little mattered that Isabel would know much better; it was for his own satisfaction more than for hers that he longed to show her he was not deceived. He tried and tried again to make her betray Osmond; he felt cold-blooded, cruel, dishonourable almost, in doing so. But it scarcely mattered, for be only failed. What had she come for then, and why did she seem almost to offer him a chance to violate their tacit convention? Why did she ask him his advice if she gave him no liberty to answer her? How could they talk of her domestic embarrassments, as it pleased her humorously to designate them, if the principal factor was not to be mentioned? These contradictions were themselves but an indication of her trouble, and her cry for help, just before, was the only thing he was bound to consider. ""You'll be decidedly at variance, all the same,"" he said in a moment. And as she answered nothing, looking as if she scarce understood, ""You'll find yourselves thinking very differently,"" be continued.




""That may easily happen, among the most united couples!"" She took up her parasol; he saw she was nervous, afraid of what he might say. ""It's a matter we can hardly quarrel about, however,"" she added; ""for almost all the interest is on his side. That's very natural. Pansy's after all his daughter—not mine."" And she put out her hand to wish him goodbye.




Ralph took an inward resolution that she shouldn't leave him without his letting her know that he knew everything: it seemed too great an opportunity to lose. ""Do you know what his interest will make him say?"" he asked as he took her hand. She shook her head, rather dryly—not discouragingly—and he went on. ""It will make him say that your want of zeal is owing to jealousy."" He stopped a moment; her face made him afraid.




""To jealousy?""




""To jealousy of his daughter.""




She blushed red and threw back her head. ""You're not kind,"" she said in a voice that he had never heard on her lips.




""Be frank with me and you'll see,"" he answered.




But she made no reply; she only pulled her hand out of his own, which he tried still to hold, and rapidly withdrew from the room. She made up her mind to speak to Pansy, and she took an occasion on the same day, going to the girl's room before dinner. Pansy was already dressed; she was always in advance of the time: it seemed to illustrate her pretty patience and the graceful stillness with which she could sit and wait. At present she was seated, in her fresh array, before the bed-room fire; she had blown out her candles on the completion of her toilet, in accordance with the economical habits in which she had been brought up sand which she was now more careful than ever to observe; so that the room was lighted only by a couple of logs. The rooms in Palazzo Roccanera were as spacious as they were numerous, and Pansy's virginal bower was an immense chamber with a dark, heavily-timbered ceiling. Its diminutive mistress, in the midst of it, appeared but a speck of humanity, and as she got up, with quick deference, to welcome Isabel, the latter was more than ever struck with her shy sincerity. Isabel had a difficult task—the only thing was to perform it as simply as possible. She felt bitter and angry, but she warned herself against betraying this heat. She was afraid even of looking too grave, or at least too stern; she was afraid of causing alarm. Put Pansy seemed to have guessed she had come more or less as a confessor; for after she had moved the chair in which she had been sitting a little nearer to the fire and Isabel had taken her place in it, she kneeled down on a cushion in front of her, looking up and resting her clasped hands on her stepmother's knees. What Isabel wished to do was to hear from her own lips that her mind was not occupied with Lord Warburton; but if she desired the assurance she felt herself by no means at liberty to provoke it. The girl's father would have qualified this as rank treachery; and indeed Isabel knew that if Pansy should display the smallest germ of a disposition to encourage Lord Warburton her own duty was to hold her tongue. It was difficult to interrogate without appearing to suggest; Pansy's supreme simplicity, an innocence even more complete than Isabel had yet judged it, gave to the most tentative enquiry something of the effect of an admonition. As she knelt there in the vague firelight, with her pretty dress dimly shining, her hands folded half in appeal and half in submission, her soft eyes, raised and fixed, full of the seriousness of the situ ation, she looked to Isabel like a childish martyr decked out for sacrifice and scarcely presuming even to hope to avert it. When Isabel said to her that she had never yet spoken to her of what might have been going on in relation to her getting married, but that her silence had not been indifference or ignorance, had only been the desire to leave her at liberty, Pansy bent forward, raised her face nearer and nearer, and with a little murmur which evidently expressed a deep longing, answered that she had greatly wished her to speak and that she begged her to advise her now.




""It's difficult for me to advise you,"" Isabel returned. ""I don't know how I can undertake that. That's for your father; you must get his advice and, above all, you must act on it.""




At this Pansy dropped her eyes; for a moment she said nothing. ""I think I should like your advice better than papa's,"" she presently remarked.




""That's not as it should be,"" said Isabel coldly. ""I love you very much, but your father loves you better.""




""It isn't because you love me—it's because you're a lady,"" Pansy answered with the air of saying something very reasonable. ""A lady can advise a young girl better than a man.""




""I advise you then to pay the greatest respect to your father's wishes.""




""Ah yes,"" said the child eagerly, ""I must do that.""




""But if I speak to you now about your getting married it's not for your own sake, it's for mine,"" Isabel went on. ""If I try to learn from you what you expect, what you desire, it's only that I may act accordingly.""




Pansy stared, and then very quickly, ""Will you do everything I want?"" she asked.




""Before I say yes I must know what such things are.""




Pansy presently told her that the only thing she wanted in life was to marry Mr. Rosier. He had asked her and she had told him she would do so if her papa would allow it. Now her papa wouldn't allow it.




""Very well then, it's impossible,"" Isabel pronounced.




""Yes, it's impossible,"" said Pansy without a sigh and with the same extreme attention in her clear little face.




""You must think of something else then,"" Isabel went on; but Pansy, sighing at this, told her that she had attempted that feat without the least success.




""You think of those who think of you,"" she said with a faint smile. ""I know Mr. Rosier thinks of me.""




""He ought not to,"" said Isabel loftily. ""Your father has expressly requested he shouldn't.""




""He can't help it, because he knows I think of him."""|"The Portrait of a Lady"|"Henry James"
