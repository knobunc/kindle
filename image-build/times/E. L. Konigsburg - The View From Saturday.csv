Grandma Sadie returned to the kitchen to whip up a repair batch of icing. Grandpa Nate took the remains of the cake to the clubhouse, and I sat with Allen until the ambulance came. He was not good company."|"The View From Saturday"|"E. L. Konigsburg"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"In her former life, Bella had been an artist. She painted the pictures that went into the pattern books for people who sew their own clothes. In the real world I had never met anyone who sewed her own clothes, but in Century Village, I had met three. Bella had a supply of fabric paints, and within two hours, we had painted a T-shirt that looked like a tuxedo with a red bow tie. I say we because I helped color in the lines she drew. It’s not easy filling in the lines on T-shirt material; it scrunches up under the weight of the brush, leaving skip marks. You have to go over it again and again. Fortunately, the paints dry fast, and by four o’clock, it was ready to wear."|"The View From Saturday"|"E. L. Konigsburg"

Like the one on the first night of our turtle walks, this one also contained a hundred and seven eggs, but this time all one hundred seven turtles emerged. “One hundred percent,” Grandpa cried, and he hugged Margaret. Then he congratulated Ethan and Dad. Ginger and I stayed on the fringe because I had to hold Ginger on a short leash so that she would not start chasing the baby turtles. Grandpa did not hug or congratulate me."|"The View From Saturday"|"E. L. Konigsburg"

"ap > 04:00"|"after four o’clock"|"Even though Mrs. Olinski could not tell why, she could tell when she decided not to hold try-outs. It was on a Saturday in late October, some time after four o’clock. She had been correcting social studies papers and had just finished reading Noah Gershom’s essay on the First Amendment when the thought flew into her head. She would appoint her team, the way the president appointed his cabinet. She made her decision. Just. Like. That."|"The View From Saturday"|"E. L. Konigsburg"

"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"She looked around the room and saw the four children, Ethan, Noah, Nadia, and Julian sitting at a table on the far side of the room. They were talking among themselves and drinking tea. They did not interrupt one another, Mrs. Olinski thought, how unusual. There were nods and smiles and obvious pleasure in one another’s company. Mrs. Olinski thought, how unusual to find four sixth graders who listen to one another sympathetically, unselfishly. How curious. How courteous. Mrs. Olinski thought, when people come to tea, they are courteous. She thought, I believe in courtesy. It is the way we avoid hurting people’s feelings. She thought that maybe—just maybe—Western Civilization was in a decline because people did not take time to take tea at four o’clock."|"The View From Saturday"|"E. L. Konigsburg"

Mr. Singh’s teas at Sillington House were becoming well known in the community, and Mrs. Olinski remembered her half promise to herself after the matinee of Annie. She would have another cup of slow tea, and the children had just extended a half invitation. Two halves make a whole, she thought.
