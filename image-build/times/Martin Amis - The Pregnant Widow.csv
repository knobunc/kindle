"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"Keith took to going up to the tower, around noon, to read an English novel—and to get a little peace. This visit to his bedroom tended to coincide with the shower that Scheherazade tended to take before lunch. He heard it, her shower. The heavy beads of water sounded like car tyres on gravel. He sat there, with the morbidly obese paperback on his lap. Then he waited for five pages before going in to wash his face."|"The Pregnant Widow"|"Martin Amis"
"ap < 00:00"|"Just before twelve"|"After dinner he played an hour of cards with Scheherazade on the thick-rugged floor of a distant chamber (the den or the gunroom, with its moose’s head, its crossed cutlasses, its miniature cannons on either side of the grate). Keith had spent most of the evening in conversation with her mother, so he was now well placed (Scheherazade’s fanned cards were six inches from his chin) to see what youth was. Her face was actually narrower than Oona’s, but the flesh itself was full and plump. And it had a self-magnifying quality, her flesh—the plump peel of youth … There was much laughing and, on her part, some beaming; every now and then she beamed at him. Just before twelve they climbed the tower by lanternlight."|"The Pregnant Widow"|"Martin Amis"
"ap 08:30"|"Eight thirty"|"“Eight thirty, Lily. Beautiful morning. And I wanted to say goodbye to Conchita. You know, I have a bond with Conchita.

"ap ~ 04:00"|"around four"|"“Bit of a disappointment, frankly, after all that. Jorquil came, around four, and no one could find her. We went upstairs and all the bedrooms were locked. House policy. Then—in the passage. There were these two huge bunnies or pets or playmates. Ex-centrefolds, these huge madams. Incredible creatures. Like retired racehorses. They’d been trying to control her all day. They were banging on the bathroom door saying things like, Are you coming, Gloria? Have you flushed yet, Gloria? Then the door opened and she stumbled out. Followed by the polo pro.”"|"The Pregnant Widow"|"Martin Amis"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"That afternoon they went down the steep little lane towards the village, to stroll and hold hands and be a couple together: Lily and Keith. The deep streets, the crushed cobbles, the fig-dark shadows, all silent in the siesta hour, which was given over to the faint trickles of digestion. The graffito, daubed in white: Mussolini Ha Sempre Ragione! Mussolini Is Always Right! Above their heads, visible from almost any vantage, stood the arthritic neck of Santa Maria. It was five o’clock, and the bells wagged and swung. A chance to stroll and hold hands and be a couple, while there was still time."|"The Pregnant Widow"|"Martin Amis"
12:00|noon|"At noon Whittaker arrived with the coffee tray, and the party re-gathered in the sun. Beyond, three columns of smoke fumed skyward from the valley, olive-coloured and silvery-blue at the edges. Below, on the upper slope of the nearest foothill, you could see the two monks who often walked there—in impassioned conversation but without gesture, walking, pausing, turning, with hidden hands. Whittaker said,"|"The Pregnant Widow"|"Martin Amis"

Holding a lantern, under a skull-like moon, Keith went with the two girls to the dark tower."|"The Pregnant Widow"|"Martin Amis"
12:00|noon|"Adriano had many cars, including a racer that seated only one, like a canoe; at its wheel, in his goggles, he resembled a badger motoring its way through a children’s book. But today, at noon, it was the high-slung Land Rover that waited in the gravel drive at the castle’s gate—the size of a Sherman tank, it seemed, with Adriano standing on the driver’s seat, or the dashboard, and poking his head through the sunroof and waving his thick-gloved hands in the air. Scheherazade, Lily, and Whittaker climbed aboard; and off they drove to Rome."|"The Pregnant Widow"|"Martin Amis"
"ap 09:30"|"half past nine"|"By half past nine he was out on the loveseat of the west terrace, with the transient fireflies (like cigarette butts flicked through the air), and, by his standards, fairly drunkenly reading Mansfield Park. Taking the smoothest route to the reptile house, he thought, might involve a certain amount of medication. He couldn’t drug Scheherazade—but himself he could disorder and anaesthetise. And two whole glasses of wine, perhaps, would lead to the rediscovery of his glorious reptilian heritage … Oona, earlier, had taken a sandwich up to the apartment; and Gloria Beautyman, in a housecoat of brown duffel, wordlessly picked at a bowl of green salad while she stood over the kitchen sink."|"The Pregnant Widow"|"Martin Amis"
12:00|noon|"Mid-morning, now, and Scheherazade was packing her things: Keith had already sadly helped her with a suitcase and a stack of books. At noon, he came up with a mug of coffee and heard the clatter of the shower … He reached for his novel (he was still listlessly rooting for Catherine and the fixed lour called Heathcliff) … Now came a flurrying, rustling sound, and just then, too, the cicadas started up. The rhythmless marracas of the cicadas … As he listened, Keith felt his face go damp and flabby, like a face marooned and immobilised over a critically hot bath. Now silence."|"The Pregnant Widow"|"Martin Amis"
18:30|"six thirty that evening"|"At this point we should jump ahead to six thirty that evening. There are sour drinks on the castle’s west terrace. Sour drinks in the sour dusk. Adriano, perfunctorily asked up, had perfunctorily declined, and drove on. So the four of them are arranged out there, their faces averted in the private trials of digestion.

It was impressive, the magnitude of her indignation, and its content ran as follows: this indignation is uncontainable, and you’re lucky that it’s Gloria Beautyman who’s containing it, because nobody else could. Keith, perhaps, and certainly Whittaker were excused from the full sweep of her disgust; but Lily wasn’t. She’s hating me too, she said. So I’m hating her back. Woman–woman diplomacy or statecraft was something that Keith knew he would never understand; it was like looking down on a bright sea from a clifftop, the million points of light pinging from droplet to droplet—untrackably. An arcane discipline, like molecular thermodynamics. Whereas male disaffection was mere male sullenness, with its Queensbury rules … It’ll all ease off, said Lily. And it did."|"The Pregnant Widow"|"Martin Amis"

On the floor, on the tiger rug, Indian-fashion faced side-saddle: Keith faced the forbidding approachability, the illegible openness of Scheherazade. What was this alphabet that he couldn’t read? She wore a close dress of murky pink, with five white buttons down the front at six-inch intervals; she kept scratching at the little red swell on the paler side of her forearm where, the night before, a mosquito had inserted its syringe. Keith was in his usual state, which was this. Every other minute, he could hear heaven snickering at his forebearance; and every minute in between, he blushed white sweat at the thought of the sulphurous tar pit in his soul."|"The Pregnant Widow"|"Martin Amis"

On every fine summer day she took the children to the beach, and at some point she would rise from her towel, and go out there, way, way out. Keith always watched with admiration and not anxiety, her self-sufficient breaststroke, as she moved beyond the hulk of the anchored tanker and disappeared from sight just below the edge of the world. Nicholas was seven, and Keith was four, and the sleeping sister, whom they were to guard, was perhaps eleven months. Violet, whom they were to guard, as their mother went—out there, way, way out.

"ap ~ 06:40"|"about six forty"|"“Why would I want to be that old boot? I settled on Bianca. You know—Cassio’s slag. I want to show you my outfit. I’ll be there about six forty. And I’ll have to keep the cab at the door. Bianca was an inspiration. So much the better if I look as though I’ve just been had. Six forty. I’ll be covered in rags and grease. And d’you know what? Othello was queer for Cassio. Kiss.”"|"The Pregnant Widow"|"Martin Amis"

"ap 06:40"|"Six forty"|"Six forty came and went. This happened about every other time. Keith once drove to Coedpoeth in North Wales, where he checked into the Gamekeeper’s Arms, ate lunch alone, and drove back again. On the other hand, he once flew to Monaco and had a whole hour with her in a golfing ranch in Cap d’Antibes …"|"The Pregnant Widow"|"Martin Amis"
04:00|"four in the morning"|"That night he is awoken at four in the morning. So Violet’s dead, he decides as he reaches for the phone."|"The Pregnant Widow"|"Martin Amis"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"“Mm, the cusp of hell. I thought the sisters might’ve pushed that up a few years—say to thirty-three or thirty-four. But they’re all like that the minute they’re twenty-eight. Even the terrorists.”
“… She’s coming round at seven.”
“That’s all right,” says Nicholas (this has happened before). “I’ll go down the Shakespeare for half an hour.”"|"The Pregnant Widow"|"Martin Amis"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"At eleven Keith readied himself to drunk-drive back to London. He gave thanks and farewells, started off down the gangplank, and, with a perceptible spring, as if helped on his way by the toe of a boot, leapt into the brown ocean of riverine slime … Which wasn’t so remarkable, perhaps—except that an hour later, after Violet, with buckets and towels, had stripped him and sluiced him and somehow reassembled him, he went out and did it again."|"The Pregnant Widow"|"Martin Amis"
19:00|"7 p.m."|"It is 7 p.m. on the day of Gloria Beautyman’s marriage, and Keith is halfway through his fourth game of Scrabble—his opponent is Kenrik. And all this time Gloria has been desperately trying to reach him. But he isn’t to know that, is he (nor is he to know that she is now alone on the platform of the train station in Llangollen—the fine rain, the cold, the floating haloes of the lights): as Keith places his moves, and lays out the letters on his rack, and occasionally consults the dictionary, he is also on the phone with Violet."|"The Pregnant Widow"|"Martin Amis"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"Keith walked home through a fog the colour of withered leaves—through the sere fog, and its smell of the churchyard. He was remembering the time Kenrik rang him at two in the morning: Kenrik was in the process of getting arrested for the first time. You could hear the voices in the background. Put the phone down, sir. Come on now, sir. That was a phone call from another genre—another way of doing things."|"The Pregnant Widow"|"Martin Amis"
"ap 09:45"|"quarter to ten"|"Gloria and Huw, she briskly explains, were the occupants of the bridal suite at the Grand, in the border city of Chester. Huw had his stag night, and Gloria had her doe night, in two different dining rooms at the hotel. She went to bed at nine—for, as everybody knew, Beautyman must have her beautysleep. Briefly waking her, Huw came in at a quarter to ten."|"The Pregnant Widow"|"Martin Amis"
"ap 01:00"|one|"Gloria said, “I told you. A year or two. Well I’ve chosen. And it’s not two. It’s one. It’ll be exactly a year.”"|"The Pregnant Widow"|"Martin Amis"
00:00|Midnight|"That night they had sex for the first time in nearly a month, and there was a sour caloricity to it, as if they both had fevers and all their bones ached, with savoury breath and savoury sweat. It drew to an end. And with embarrassing copiousness he followed her four-word instruction. Gloria rose and went to the bathroom, and when she returned she was dressed in black.
“Notre Dame,” she said through her veil. “Midnight mass.”
He awoke at three in an empty bed with the image of a black shape in the brown Seine, the drifting tresses, the open eyes … She was in the other room, kneeling naked on the window seat and looking out at the moonlit square. She turned. Her face was a deathmask, encrusted with dried white."|"The Pregnant Widow"|"Martin Amis"
"ap > 01:00"|"Just after one o’clock"|"Just after one o’clock Gloria stood up suddenly. Her mouth opened and stayed open in disbelief and what seemed to be glee as she looked down at the sudden sarong of scarlet that swathed her hips. And on the sofa behind her, not a shapeless patch but a burning orb, like a sunset."|"The Pregnant Widow"|"Martin Amis"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"The unsuspected sensuality of stasis, of stillness, the expert caress of the cotton sheets. In normal times a combination of greed, boredom, and curiosity got him out of bed by nine o’clock (he wanted to know what had happened, while he slept, to the planet Earth). But now he stays horizontal until keeping his eyes shut is harder work than keeping them open. His body deeply needs this. And every night, for about an hour, he weeps and swears. He lies on the bed and swears with stinging eyes. When fully awake, he retains a stunned feeling. And he doesn’t know why. What has happened to him that he should have to carry all this weight?"|"The Pregnant Widow"|"Martin Amis"
"< 00:00"|"nearly midnight"|"She had been unconscious for over a hundred hours, and he told his mother and brother that there was no point in coming, she would not be waking up and there was no point in coming, coming from Andalucia, from Sierra Leone … It was nearly midnight. Her body was flat, sunken, on the raised bed, all buoyancy gone; but the lifeline on the monitor continued to undulate, like a childish representation of the ocean, and she continued to breathe—to breathe with preternatural force."|"The Pregnant Widow"|"Martin Amis"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"“Mm. Who aren’t marrying nine-year-old grooms. Imagine Isabel, at nine, getting married to anyone, let alone an old man. That’s violent. I can’t think of anything more violent. More richly violent.”"|"The Pregnant Widow"|"Martin Amis"
09:00|"nine o’clock in the morning"|"Who were these extremists and self-destroyers, these despiters, the people who couldn’t stand it another second in heaven? Yes go on, Kenrik, get caught after a long chase for driving five times over the limit at nine o’clock in the morning for the fourth time in three weeks (and serve a year in Wormwood Scrubs). Yes go on, Gloria, place yourself outside history, and live your twenties twice, and do it as a game, while in that way somehow making yourself invaluably dear to the memory. Yes go on, Violet, let the honeymoon last at least half a minute, and then run out over the fields, with no more thought in your head than a puppy, panting, heaving, running, flying, looking for someone you love."|"The Pregnant Widow"|"Martin Amis"
