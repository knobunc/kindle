"ap 06:00"|six|"The storm was over. The air was cooler and the tension, which had been almost suspended in the air, had been released as if the world had sighed. Jaunty climbed from bed. It was six. Silence filled the cabin, broken only by the screech of crows and curlews rising from the creek. Pulling on an old cashmere cardigan, she sat at her desk, wondering where she’d left off and knowing it didn’t matter."|"A Cornish Stranger"|"Liz Fenwick"
"< 16:00"|"just before 4 o’clock that afternoon"|"Jaunty took a breath. Her chest was tight. She could smell the harbour, the scent of seaweed and rotting fish. She sat back and shook her head. She should remember the smell of burning, but no, it was fish she could smell. How Jean had hated fish and Jaunty had sent Jean to her death in the sea. She closed her eyes. What else could she have done? Jean, even if she’d survived the attack on the Lancastria, just before 4 o’clock that afternoon, couldn’t swim. Jaunty had prayed for a long time that Jean had been killed instantly and hadn’t drowned."|"A Cornish Stranger"|"Liz Fenwick"
12:00|noon|"Had Alex survived, life would have been so different and she might well have lived a life of launches and society parties. But that didn’t happen and it was far too late to think of the ‘what ifs’. Jaunty looked at her watch. It was noon. ‘Would you pour me a whisky?’"|"A Cornish Stranger"|"Liz Fenwick"
"ap < 05:00"|"just before five"|"I walk through the gallery door just before five. This much I know. I have to do this. I am Jean Blythe. I pray she will understand. Jeanette died on the Lancastria. I can do this."|"A Cornish Stranger"|"Liz Fenwick"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"Jenna raised an eyebrow. ‘I like the five o’clock shadow he’s sporting.’"|"A Cornish Stranger"|"Liz Fenwick"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"Jaunty was up and dressed when Gabe came out of her room at seven. Gabe blinked when she saw her grandmother putting yoghurt into a bowl."|"A Cornish Stranger"|"Liz Fenwick"
19:00|"seven in the evening"|"‘True.’ Gabe looked at her watch. It was already seven in the evening. She opened the door and slid into the passenger seat."|"A Cornish Stranger"|"Liz Fenwick"
"ap 09:30"|"nine thirty"|"‘I rang the hospital and there’s no change. Jaunty is stable so they are moving her to another ward.’ Fin handed her a mug. It was what she should have been doing, not sleeping. A glance at the clock on the wall told her it was already nine thirty. She’d slept for twelve hours."|"A Cornish Stranger"|"Liz Fenwick"
"ap 04:00"|four|"When Gabe walked out into the grey afternoon, it was only four, but with the heavy cloud cover it felt much later. She called the number Fin had given her and arranged to meet him at the superstore. He had come in to Truro with her, but after a quick visit with Jaunty he had headed off to the library to do some research, he said, which seemed odd, but what did she know about him or what he did?"|"A Cornish Stranger"|"Liz Fenwick"
"~ 00:30"|"about half past midnight"|"Lying in bed, exhausted but unable to sleep, Gabe rolled over again. It was now approaching two and they had finished recording about half past midnight. Despite feeling like a wrung-out dishcloth, with eyes that were burning, her mind wouldn’t calm down. The music had stirred her too much. There was no sense in fighting it any longer. She might as well get up and have a cup of herbal tea."|"A Cornish Stranger"|"Liz Fenwick"
"~ 02:00"|"about two in the morning"|"A rueful smile crossed Gabe’s face. ‘I’ll try to make it as short as possible, if I can.’ She stopped. Her stomach clenched in spasms. ‘After a competition, a big one, there was a party where much alcohol was consumed.’ She frowned, struggling to find the words. ‘I was being hailed as the next big thing and I was walking on air, but I realised that I wanted to go to the hotel. I needed to be away from so many people, to let it all sink in.’ Gabe closed her eyes. She could do this. ‘One of the judges offered to walk me back because it was about two in the morning, and I agreed.’ She thought about the conversation. They had spoken about how well it had gone and the future. He had taken her hand and she had thought nothing of it. When he asked her to his room for a drink she should have said no but her ambition overruled her sense and the warnings she’d received. Even now she still felt it was her fault, despite what the counsellor had said. If she hadn’t said yes . . . ‘When we reached the hotel the bar was shut so he invited me to his room for a nightcap.’ Gabe swallowed. ‘I said yes. I didn’t think I could say no to him because he was one of the most renowned opera critics in the world. One good word and my career would be made.’ Gabe’s throat constricted. ‘He asked me to sing for him, and when I came to the end of the song . . .’ Gabe took a deep breath. ‘He raped me.’"|"A Cornish Stranger"|"Liz Fenwick"
12:00|noon|"It was noon when Gabe finally set out for Truro. Everything about her felt raw. Fin had left a note on the table saying he had caught a lift to Falmouth with Max to see how the repair of his boat was going. She wasn’t sure if she was relieved or not that he hadn’t been there when she woke. How could she have told him all of that last night?"|"A Cornish Stranger"|"Liz Fenwick"
"~ 16:30"|"Evening Prayer"|"‘Can we sing “The Evening Prayer” from Hansel and Gretel next?’ She pulled some crumpled sheets from her bag. ‘I’m working on it at the moment and it would really help to do it with you.’"|"A Cornish Stranger"|"Liz Fenwick"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"Max was drinking coffee with Fin when Gabe came out of the bedroom. She thought she’d heard voices when she stepped from the shower, but then dismissed it because it was only eight. But obviously it hadn’t been the radio."|"A Cornish Stranger"|"Liz Fenwick"
"ap 06:00"|six|"‘Hardly. I was up at six making used cars sound sexy and exciting.’ Gabe eyed the cafetière. There wasn’t enough in it to squeeze another cup out. Maybe she would have tea, but she had had that at six. ‘What brings you here so early?’"|"A Cornish Stranger"|"Liz Fenwick"
00:00|midnight|"Gabe swallowed and parked the car. Sun broke through the clouds as she walked up to the church. The last time she had been here was the previous Christmas for midnight mass. She and Jaunty had slipped in late and exited early so Jaunty wouldn’t be forced into chatting. Gabe hadn’t understood, but had always gone along with Jaunty’s eccentricities."|"A Cornish Stranger"|"Liz Fenwick"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"Eventually Gabe placed Jaunty gently back on the bed. What should she do now? She turned on the light. A glance at the bedside clock told her it was three in the morning. She tucked Jaunty in and went through to the kitchen, jumping when there was a knock on the door. Fin!"|"A Cornish Stranger"|"Liz Fenwick"
"ap 01:00"|one|"‘It’s a well, or rather it was one. Judging by the trees it’s considered a holy well.’"|"A Cornish Stranger"|"Liz Fenwick"
12:00|midday|"It was midday and the phone rang, probably for the fifth time. Gabe frowned. She would have to begin answering it again sometime. It might as well be now. ‘Hello.’"|"A Cornish Stranger"|"Liz Fenwick"
10:00|"ten in the morning"|"I walk into the big studio and immediately feel at home with the smell of paint and dust. A woman, nude, sits in the centre of the room on a stool. Light falls on her from the window in the ceiling, creating marvellous shadows. My fingers twitch. I want to paint immediately but Pierre comes to greet me and kisses me three times. He smells of tobacco and wine although it is only ten in the morning. When he releases me I see this elegant woman dressed like a man sitting quietly in the corner. I wonder who she is and if she is painting the nude. I am jealous for so many reasons, but mostly it is her confidence. I love her hair. It is cut in a short bob and is sleek, black and glossy. I touch my own and feel out of date, although I know it suits me."|"A Cornish Stranger"|"Liz Fenwick"
"ap 01:00"|one|"Jaunty dropped the charcoal, rubbing her fingers together to removed the sooty remains. The wind howled and she thought she heard Gabriella singing an old hymn, but Jaunty knew it must be her desire to hear her sing that was making the wind’s whining through the trees sound like music. Collecting her pen and notebook she settled back into bed, looking up at the ceiling as a thump hit the roof. The light blinked but remained on. She looked at her watch, then the bedside table. It was one thirty but the alarm clock showed one. The power must have gone off at some point. She hoped Fin had secured his boat well. He should be protected from the worst of the storm in the creek. It was a haven and had always been."|"A Cornish Stranger"|"Liz Fenwick"
