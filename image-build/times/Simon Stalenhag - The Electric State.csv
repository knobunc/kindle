03:30|"three thirty in the morning"|"The car moved through the pitch-black desert night like a submarine in a deep-sea trench. The dashboard clock said it was three thirty in the morning when we first saw the lights of Mojave on the horizon. When we got closer, I killed the headlights and drove as slowly as I could until I saw the flashing yellow lights of the roadblock. I stopped on the shoulder of the road and turned the engine off. Skip was asleep, and I had to wake him up. He sat up and stared out the window for a long while. I explained that I needed help with the roadblock, and then we got out of the car and walked the last few hundred yards. Together we managed to move the barriers enough to get the car through, and once we had driven past the roadblock we got out, walked back, and replaced the barriers. I didnâ€™t dare turn the headlights on before we were in the town."|"The Electric State"|"Simon Stalenhag"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"I set the alarm on the clock radio to three in the morning, and then I threw myself onto the covers and fell asleep."|"The Electric State"|"Simon Stalenhag"
