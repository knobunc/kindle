"~ 07:00"|"about seven o’clock this morning"|"And he did. Marcus played bridge with the bishop and knew all the Catholic hotshots. Some hotshot ran Saint Agnes Cemetery in Menands. Francis slept in the weeds on Dongan Avenue below the
  bridge and woke up about seven o’clock this morning, then went up to the mission on Madison Avenue to get coffee. Helen wasn’t there. She was truly gone. He didn’t know where she
  was and nobody had seen her. They said she’d been hanging around the mission last night, but then went away. Francis had fought with her earlier over money and she just walked off someplace,
  who the hell knows where?"|Ironweed|"William Kennedy"
04:00|"four in the morning"|"They walked from downtown Albany to the cemetery in Menands, six miles or more. Francis felt healthy and he liked it. It’s too bad he didn’t feel healthy when he drank. He felt good
  then but not healthy, especially not in the morning, or when he woke up in the middle of the night, say. Sometimes he felt dead. His head, his throat, his stomach: he needed to get them all
  straight with a drink, or maybe it’d take two, because if he didn’t, his brain would overheat trying to fix things and his eyes would blow out. Jeez it’s tough when you need that
  drink and your throat’s like an open sore and it’s four in the morning and the wine’s gone and no place open and you got no money or nobody to bum from, even if there was a place
  open. That’s tough, pal. Tough."|Ironweed|"William Kennedy"
12:00|noonday|"Francis stopped crying and tried to suck a small piece of bread out from between the last two molars in his all but toothless mouth. He made a slurping sound with his tongue, and when he did, a
  squirrel scratching the earth for food to store up for the winter spiraled up the box elder in sudden fright. Francis took this as a signal to conclude his visit and he turned his gaze toward the
  sky. A vast stand of white fleece, brutally bright, moved south to north in the eastern vault of the heavens, a rush of splendid wool to warm the day. The breeze had grown temperate and the sun was
  rising to the noonday pitch. Francis was no longer chilly."|Ironweed|"William Kennedy"
"ap ~ 08:00"|"about eight"|"“I was five years old,” Rudy said.
“How old are you now, about eight?”
They passed the old carbarns at Erie Street, all full of buses. Buildings a different color, and more of ’em, but it looks a lot like it looked in ’16. The trolley full of scabs and
  soldiers left this barn that day in ’01 and rocketed arrogantly down Broadway, the street supine and yielding all the way to downtown. But then at Columbia and Broadway the street changed its
  pose: it became volatile with the rage of strikers and their women, who trapped the car at that corner between two blazing bedsheets which Francis helped to light on the overhead electric wire.
  Soldiers on horses guarded the trolley; troops with rifles rode on it. But every scabby-souled one of them was trapped between pillars of fire when Francis pulled back, wound up his educated right
  arm, and let fly that smooth round stone the weight of a baseball, and brained the scab working as the trolley conductor. The troops saw more stones coming and fired back at the mob, hitting two
  men who fell in fatal slumps; but not Francis, who ran down to the railroad tracks and then north along them till his lungs blew out. He pitched forward into a ditch and waited about nine years to
  see if they were on his tail, and they weren’t, but his brother Chick and his buddies Patsy McCall and Martin Daugherty were; and when the three of them reached his ditch they all ran north,
  up past the lumberyards in the district, and found refuge with Iron Joe Farrell, Francis’s father-in-law, who bossed the filtration plant that made Hudson River water drinkable for Albany
  folk. And after a while, when he knew for sure he couldn’t stay around Albany because the scab was surely dead, Francis hopped a train going north, for he couldn’t get a westbound
  without going back down into that wild city. But it was all right. He went north and then he walked awhile and found his way to some westbound tracks, and went west on them, all the way west to
  Dayton, O-hi-o."|Ironweed|"William Kennedy"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"By then the bus was at Madison Avenue and Broadway, and Rudy and Francis stepped out into the frosty darkness of six o’clock on the final night of October 1938, the unruly night when grace
  is always in short supply, and the old and the new dead walk abroad in this land."|Ironweed|"William Kennedy"
"ap > 03:00"|"after three"|"Pee Wee stood up from the table and climbed the stairs to the rooms where the resident handful lived while they sorted out their lives. The preacher had invited Francis to stay if he could get
  the hooch out of his system. He would then have a clean bed, clean clothes, three squares, and a warm room with Jesus in it for as long as it took him to answer the question: What next? Pee Wee
  held the house record: eight months in the joint, and managing it after three, such was his zeal for abstention. No booze, no smoking upstairs (for drunks are fire hazards), carry your share of the
  work load, and then rise you must, rise you will, into the brilliant embrace of the just God. The kitchen volunteers stopped their work and came forward with solemnized pity to watch the eviction
  of one of their promising young men. Pee Wee came down with a suitcase and set it by the door."|Ironweed|"William Kennedy"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"“I could get something,” Pee Wee said, and he loosened his keys and opened the door of the darkened mission: all lights off save the kitchen, which would remain bright until eleven,
  lockout time. Pee Wee opened the door and entered as Rudy, Helen, and Francis huddled around Sandra, watching her breathe. Francis had watched two dozen people suspire into death, all of them bums
  except for his father, and Gerald."|Ironweed|"William Kennedy"
00:00|midnight|"The city had grown quiet at midnight and the moon was as white as early snow. A few cars moved slowly on Pearl Street but otherwise the streets were silent. Francis turned up his suitcoat collar
  and shoved his hands into his pants pockets. Alongside the mission the moon illuminated Sandra, who sat where they had left her. They stopped to look at her condition. Francis squatted and shook
  her."|Ironweed|"William Kennedy"
"ap 00:10"|twelve-ten|"Helen looked at the clock: twelve-ten. Pee Wee was calling the police."|Ironweed|"William Kennedy"
"ap ~ 06:00"|"about six o’clock"|"“Sure,” Francis said. “I had a bowl of soup about six o’clock but it went right through me. I’m gonna have to eat somethin’ soon.”"|Ironweed|"William Kennedy"
"ap 01:45"|one-forty-five|"On the street, Francis felt the urge to run. Ten Broeck Street, in the direction they were walking, inclined downward toward Clinton Avenue, and he felt the gravitational fall
  driving him into a trot that would leave her behind to solve her own needs. The night seemed colder than before, and clearer too, the moon higher in its sterile solitude. North Pearl Street was
  deserted, no cars, no people at this hour, one-forty-five by the great clock on the First Church. They had walked three blocks without speaking and now they were heading back toward where they had
  begun, toward the South End, the mission, the weeds."|Ironweed|"William Kennedy"
"ap 07:50"|Seven-fifty|"“You got better, take it. People feed families all week on seven dollar.”
“Seven-fifty.”
“Seven.”"|Ironweed|"William Kennedy"
12:00|"high noon"|"On this high noon in 1938, under the sun’s full brilliance, the tree restored itself to its half size of forty-one years past, a July morning in 1897 when Francis was sitting on a middle
  branch, sawing the end off a branch above him. He heard the back door of the Daughertys’ new house open and close, and he looked down from his perch to see Katrina Daugherty, carrying her
  small shopping bag, wearing a gray sun hat, gray satin evening slippers, and nothing else. She descended the five steps of the back piazza and strode toward the new barn, where the Daugherty landau
  and horse were kept."|Ironweed|"William Kennedy"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"The day had all but begun with music. She left Finny’s car humming the “Te Deum”; why, she could not say. But at six o’clock, when it was still dark and Finny and the
  other man were both snoring, it became the theme of her morning pathway. As she walked she considered the immediate future for herself and her twelve dollars, the final twelve dollars of her life
  capital, money she never intended to tell Francis about, money tucked safely in her brassiere."|Ironweed|"William Kennedy"
06:50|"ten minutes to seven in the
  morning"|"The sound of the organ resonated out from the church before the mass began, and on the sidewalk Helen knew the day boded well for her, with such sanctified music greeting her at the dawning.
  There were three dozen people in the church, not many for a holy day of obligation. Not everybody feels obligations the way Helen feels them, but then again, it is only ten minutes to seven in the
  morning."|Ironweed|"William Kennedy"
"ap 10:50"|"ten minutes to eleven"|"But Helen. Dare you be so vindictive? Did you not have tailfeathers of your own once, however briefly, however long ago? Just look at yourself sitting there staring at the bed with its dirty
  sheets beckoning to you. Your delicacy resists those sheets, does it not? Not only because of their dirt but because you also resist lying on your back with nothing of beauty to respond to, only
  the cracked plaster and peeling ceiling paint; whereas by sitting in the chair you can at least look at Grandmother Swan, or even at the blue cardboard clock on the back of the door, which might
  help you to estimate the time of your life: wake me at: as if any client of this establishment ever had, or ever would, use such a sign, as if crippled Donovan would ever see it if they did use it,
  or seeing it, heed it. The clock said ten minutes to eleven. Pretentious."|Ironweed|"William Kennedy"
"ap 10:50"|"ten minutes to eleven"|"And so when Helen holds the brass, and looks at the clock that still says ten minutes to eleven, and thinks of slippers and music and the great butterfly and the white pebble with the hidden
  name, she has this passing thought for priests. For when you were raised like Helen was, you think of priests as holding the keys to the door of redemption. No matter how many sins you have
  committed (sands of the desert, salt of the sea), you are bound to come to the notion of absolution at the time of brass holding and clock watching, and to the remembering of how you even used to
  put Violet de Paris on your brassiere so that when he opened your dress to kiss you there, he wouldn’t smell any sweat."|Ironweed|"William Kennedy"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"And so when crippled Donovan knocks again at eleven o’clock and asks if Helen needs anything, she says no, no thank you, old cripple, I don’t need anything or anybody anymore. And
  old Donovan says: The night man’s just comin’ on, and so I’m headin’ home. I’ll be here in the mornin’. And Helen says: Thank you, Donovan, thank you ever so
  much for your concern, and for saying good night to me. And after he goes away from the door she lets go of the brass and thinks of Beethoven, Ode to Joy,"|Ironweed|"William Kennedy"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"They were now pulling an empty wagon, fresh from dumping the day’s first load of junk back at Rosskam’s yard. Francis had lunched at the yard on an apple Rosskam gave him, and had
  changed into his new white-on-white shirt, throwing his old blue relic onto Rosskam’s rag mountain. They had then set out on the day’s second run, heading for the deep South End of the
  city, until the fire turned them around at three o’clock."|Ironweed|"William Kennedy"
"ap < 03:30"|"almost three-thirty"|"Francis, feeling the eyes of the four shades on him, gave them all the back of his neck as the wagon rolled north on Pearl Street, Annie’s street. Getting closer. He pulled up the collar
  of his coat against a new bite in the wind, the western sky graying with ominous clouds. It was almost three-thirty by the Nehi clock in the window of Elmer Rivenburgh’s grocery. First day of
  early winter. If it rains tonight and we’re outside, we freeze our ass once and for all."|Ironweed|"William Kennedy"
"ap 03:50"|Three-fifty|"“I worked more’n half a day. I worked more’n seven hours. I figure you can knock off a dollar. That’d be fair. I’ll take six ’stead of seven, and a quarter
  out for the shirt. Five-seventy-five.”
“Half a day you work, you get half pay. Three-fifty.”
“No sir.”"|Ironweed|"William Kennedy"
"ap 10:30"|ten-thirty|"They were walking down South Pearl Street toward Palombo’s Hotel. It was ten-thirty, a clear night, full of stars but very cold: winter’s harbinger. Francis had left the family just
  before ten o’clock and taken a bus downtown He went straight to the mission before they locked it for the night, and found Pee Wee alone in the kitchen, drinking leftover coffee. Pee Wee said
  he hadn’t seen, or heard from, Helen all day."|Ironweed|"William Kennedy"
"ap < 10:00"|"just
  before ten o’clock"|"They were walking down South Pearl Street toward Palombo’s Hotel. It was ten-thirty, a clear night, full of stars but very cold: winter’s harbinger. Francis had left the family just

"ap < 11:00"|"a little before eleven"|"At Palombo’s they met old man Donovan just getting ready to go off duty, making way for the night clerk. It was a little before eleven and he was putting the desk in
  order. Yes, he told Francis, Helen was here. Checked in late this morning. Yeah, sure she’s all right. Looked right perky. Walked up them stairs lookin’ the same as always. Took the
  room you always take."|Ironweed|"William Kennedy"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"So Donovan knocked on Helen’s door at eleven o’clock and found out she needed nothing at all, and he came back and told Francis."|Ironweed|"William Kennedy"
12:00|noon|"“I’m hungry,” Mac said. “I ain’t et since noon. Goin’ on thirteen, fourteen hours, whatever it is.”"|Ironweed|"William Kennedy"
"ap 03:15"|three-fifteen|"It would be three-fifteen by the clock on the First Church when Francis headed south toward Palombo’s Hotel to get out of the cold, to stretch out with Helen and try to
  think about what had happened and what he should do about it. He would walk past Palombo’s night man on the landing, salute him, and climb the stairs to the room he and Helen always shared in
  this dump. Looking at the hallway dirt and the ratty carpet as he walked down the hall, he would remind himself that this was luxury for him and Helen. He would see the light coming out from under
  the door, but he would knock anyway to make sure he had Helen’s room. When he got no answer he would open the door and discover Helen on the floor in her kimono."|Ironweed|"William Kennedy"
