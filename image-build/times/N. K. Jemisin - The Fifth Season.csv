12:00|Noon|"He rubs his face with both hands. She feels a little bad, but only a little.
“Fine,” he says, all business again. “Noon it is.”
So she heads out, sore and annoyed that she smells faintly like him, and tired. Probably it’s just stress that’s wearing her out—the idea of a month on the road with a man she cannot stand, doing things she doesn’t want to do, on behalf of people she increasingly despises."|"The Fifth Season"|"N. K. Jemisin"
"ap 00:00"|twelve|"“I think I have twelve children.” Alabaster pulls the blanket more closely about himself. “I’m not sure. They don’t always tell me. I don’t always see the mothers, after. But I’m guessing it’s twelve. Don’t know where most of them are.”"|"The Fifth Season"|"N. K. Jemisin"

"ap 06:35"|6:35|"“A shake in Erta emits push waves at 6:35 and seven seconds, and vibrational waves at 6:37 and twenty-seven seconds. What is the lag time?” This question becomes more complex if it is asked of older grits, going into logarithms and functions."|"The Fifth Season"|"N. K. Jemisin"

"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"Damaya waits awhile, leaning casually against the wall and listening with both ears and sessapinae for any vibration of feet or approaching voices—or worse, the buzz of an approaching Guardian. It’s after midnight by now, though, and even the most dedicated workers are either planning to sleep in their offices or have left for the night, so no one troubles them during the agonizingly long time it takes for Binof to figure out how to use the thing."|"The Fifth Season"|"N. K. Jemisin"
12:00|"high noon"|"This close, the scent of the man mingled rancid sweat, stale grease, and other odors into a pungent mix that left Ehiru momentarily queasy. He had forgotten the infrequent bathing habits of people from the north. Though the night was cool and breezy, the northerner—a trader from the Bromarte people, the commission had specified, though in truth Ehiru had never been able to tell one northern tribe from another—sweated profusely, his pale skin flushed and rash-prickled as if he slept in high noon’s swelter. Ehiru studied that face for a moment, wondering what peace might be coaxed from the dreams of such a man."|"The Fifth Season"|"N. K. Jemisin"
