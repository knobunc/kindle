Won’t do her any harm to find that jobs don’t grow on trees, though. Hard to believe that there’s a musician in the family.” Gideon went on, with barely subdued pride, “I can’t sing a note without being flat, and my wife – well, never mind. Will you be in today, if I need you?”
“I’ll be at lunch from twelve-thirty to three.”
Gideon kept a straight face. “Right, sir, thanks.” He went out, letting the door close silently behind him, and shook his head. “Two and a half hours for lunch, and I’ll be lucky if I have time to get a bowl of soup and a sandwich from the canteen.” But he said it in no resentful mood.

It was a crisp morning in April, no rain was about, the look of spring was upon London and the feel of spring was in Londoners. In a vague sort of way, Gideon knew that he loved London and after a fashion, loved Londoners. It wasn’t just sentiment; he belonged to the hard pavements, the smell of petrol and oil, the rumble and the growl of traffic, and the unending sound of footsteps, as some men belonged to the country. They could be said to love the soil. The only time that Gideon was really uneasy was when he had a job to handle outside of London or one of the big cities. The country hadn’t the same feel; he felt that it could cheat him, without him knowing it, whereas here in London the odds were always even."|"Gideon's Day"|"J. J. Marric"

She had the looks, the plumpness, the naïveté and the natural gaiety which could make a child win approval from everyone. The hug that Lucy Saparelli gave Dorothy each night and each morning was born of the little extra delight the child gave her. “Delight” was the word which mattered, was the thing the girl child brought to Lucy, to Jim Saparelli, to the two boys."|"Gideon's Day"|"J.
