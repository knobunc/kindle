Let’s take the old man who lived on the second floor right underneath the room where the murder took place. At ten minutes after twelve on the night of the killing he heard loud noises in the apartment upstairs. He said it sounded like a fight. Then he heard the kid shout out, “I’m gonna kill you.” A second later he heard a body fall and he ran to the door of his apartment, looked out and saw the kid running down the stairs and out of the house. Then he called the police. They found the father with a knife in his chest."|"Twelve Angry Men"|"Reginald Rose"

Know what I mean? Anyway, she looks out the window and right across the street she sees the kid stick the knife into his father. The time is twelve ten on the nose. Everything fits. Look, she’s known the kid all his life. His window is right opposite hers, across the el tracks, and she swore she saw him do it."|"Twelve Angry Men"|"Reginald Rose"

Now this is where the stories offered by the boy and the State begin to diverge slightly. He claims that he stayed home until eleven thirty and then went to one of those all-night movies. He returned home at about three fifteen in the morning to find his father dead and himself arrested. Now, what happened to the switch knife? This is the charming and imaginative little fable the boy invented. He claims that the knife fell through a hole in his pocket sometime between eleven thirty and three fifteen while he was on his trip to the movies and that he never saw it again. Now this is a tale, gentlemen. I think it’s quite clear that the boy never went to the movies that night. No one in the house saw him go out at eleven thirty. No one at the theater identified him. He couldn’t even remember the names of the pictures he saw. What actually happened is this: the boy stayed home, had another fight with this father, stabbed him to death with the knife at ten minutes after twelve and fled from the house. He even remembered to wipe the knife clean of fingerprints. The GUARD unlocks the door and enters carrying a curiously designed knife with a tag hanging from it."|"Twelve Angry Men"|"Reginald Rose"
