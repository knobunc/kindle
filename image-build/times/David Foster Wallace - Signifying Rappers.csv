02:00|"two AM"|"Driving was a major social easer for Dave Wallace. Normal conversational requirements—listening while thinking, while watching face-and body-language, while processing these sometimes undermining messages (your voice says that you’re interested, your face says that you’re bored), while also wondering about one’s own mixed messages of interest, boredom, politeness, contempt—could be a burden. Talking was easier when driving because both parties, seated, safety-belted, were positioned to stare out at the same relaxing blankness of the highway. The highway, saving eye contact, made interaction bearable when Dave’s nerves began to fray. His mood improved on drives at two AM with girlfriends to the beaches north of Boston or west to Walden Pond, an oasis in the suburbs now, where we would go swimming in the deep and spring-fed pond. Walden’s water tastes the way a sidewalk smells just before it rains. The water is very hard and excellent for swimming, like velvet drawn across the skin. Dave would roll his tan corduroys up and wade like Alfred Prufrock and worry, just a little, about snapping turtles. But he was happy; you could hear it. He felt good."|"Signifying Rappers"|"David Foster Wallace"
16:00|16|"One (1) four-car garage fitted with dubbing and remastering gear worth more than most of the rest of the real estate on the block;One (1) Touchtone telephone (leased);Two (2) Chevy Blazers, vanity-plated RJAM1 and RJAM2, each equipped with cellular phones and slick tape decks (also leased);One (1) VCR with Kathleen Turner’s Body Heat cued up on the morning in question;Most important, eight (8) promising acts under binding contract.If—as has happened to many local labels—RJam were liquidated to satisfy creditors, these would be the pieces. But there are stores of value in the converted garage beyond the reach of the auctioneer’s gavel. Schoolly D, the original Signifying Rapper, looms irresistibly from the pages of rap fanzines Hip-Hop and The Source; and RJam’s prime, unauctionable asset is the consuming ambition of the artists in its stable to be the next Schoolly D. Or the next Ice T or Kool Moe Dee or L.L. Cool J, or whoever’s the special hero of the kid cutting the demo. On this particular morning, the dream is to be the next MC Lyte—a hard-rapping woman known for jams like “Lyte Vs. Vanna Whyte” and “10% Dis”—since today is Tam-Tam’s day, and Tam-Tam is, at 16, a tough girl in the MC Lyte mold who, like MC Lyte, can dance, look good, and tell men to beat it, all at once."|"Signifying Rappers"|"David Foster Wallace"
"ap 01:00"|100|"Rap, like the avant-garde, deploys digital multitracked sampling to blow open the musical and political boundaries of the soul and funk that are the rappers’ Bach and Beethoven. Public Enemy’s Yo! Bum Rush the Show and It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back, cruising at 100–120 beats/minute, weave thick ‘sound carpets’ of tempo, other tempo, guitar riffs, constant sirens, radio tunings, buzz saws (or is that a dentist’s drill on P.E.’s “Terminator X Speaks With His Hands”?), motors, weird noises, chatter, and rhyme. P.E.’s producers, Hank Shocklee and Carl Ryder, wield techniques invented to eliminate sonic garbage to enhance that garbage. The result: aural paranoia."|"Signifying Rappers"|"David Foster Wallace"
12:00|"High Noon"|"An episode initially aired on June 12, 1967, features Tony, the space-age American, idly wishing aloud that he could live in the Old West, when men were Men. Jeannie, eager, all-powerful, and literal-minded (a deadly sit-combo), sends him and us back to Gopher Gulch, an old Rawhide set terrorized by rustlers led by veteran B-movie cowboy crooner Hoyt Axton. A High Noon spoof ensues, with Tony in good-guy white shooting his own foot but refusing Jeannie’s help: he must face Hoyt Axton alone. Tony finally ‘wins’ their burlesque gunfight, and he and Jeannie return to Cocoa Beach with a minute or so left in the episode (like suburbanites back from vacation the night before a workday) and just enough script left to savor, with an interrupting Roger Healey, their ended adventure."|"Signifying Rappers"|"David Foster Wallace"
12:00|"High Noon"|"Did anyone on the evening of June 12, 1967, snap off the set as the pseudo-Bedouin closing played to the roll of credits, turn to her hubby, and say, ‘What the hell was that’? The High Noon spoof certainly is a freaky premise for fantasy: Tony’s unwanted peril follows from getting his wish; but it turns out that this peril, this wish-gone-awry, is what he had craved without knowing it. All in a fantasy Florida never to be confused with the actual Florida of Walter Cronkite, itself the scene of some distinctly unfunny race riots in Tampa, which began the night before Tony Nelson went back to the Old West and raged at their worst between 8 PM and midnight Eastern Time, Monday, June 12, 1967, as the High Noon spoof aired."|"Signifying Rappers"|"David Foster Wallace"

"ap 04:46"|4:46|"But control is precisely what rap will not give her. Or me. Or you. Rappers don’t pay the emotional royalties to the dead called grief, just as they refuse to pay one dime to James Brown, whose “Say It Loud (I’m Black and I’m Proud)” from ’68 may be the real start of that wardrobe of ’tudes called rap. It is impossible to listen to more than 15 minutes of rap radio on any given night in Boston without hearing a backbeat, a guitar hook, or a snatch of vocals from “Say It Loud.” Hours of rap has found some part of itself in 4:46 of “Say It Loud.” And James Brown, popularity waning in the late ’70s, enjoys, as the backbone of Public Enemy’s sound carpet, a huge new listenership. He’s the uncredited (and, until the courts decide that sampling falls within federal copyright laws, uncompensated) father of a generation that thinks it’s listening—and is listening—to original rap."|"Signifying Rappers"|"David Foster Wallace"
