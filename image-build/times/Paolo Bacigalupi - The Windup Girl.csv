16:00|"four in the afternoon"|"Anderson draws again on his cigarette, irritated. He becomes aware of the heat. Overhead, his room’s crank fan has come to a halt. The winding man, who is supposed to arrive every day at four in the afternoon, apparently didn’t load enough joules. Anderson grimaces and rises to pull the shades, blocking out the blaze. The building is a new one, built on thermal principles that allow cool ground air to circulate easily through the building, but it is still difficult to withstand the direct blaze of equatorial sun."|"The Windup Girl"|"Paolo Bacigalupi"
12:00|noon|"He flips through the book but finds no other images, nor mentions of the kinds of fruits available. He straightens, agitated, and goes to the balcony again. Steps out into the sun’s blaze and stares out across the city. From below, the calls of water sellers and the cry of megodonts echo up. The chime of bicycle bells streaming across the city. By noon, the city will be largely stilled, waiting for the sun to begin its descent."|"The Windup Girl"|"Paolo Bacigalupi"
"ap 06:00"|"Six o’clock"|"Hock Seng glances at the clock on the wall. Six o’clock. “He shouldn’t be here for another hour or two. He is seldom early.”"|"The Windup Girl"|"Paolo Bacigalupi"
00:00|midnight|"Conversation around the table continues to carefully avoid the reason for their midnight rendezvous. They speak of harvests in the north, and discuss the problem of the Mekong now that the Chinese have placed more dams at its source. They talk about new clipper ship designs that Mishimoto is preparing for production."|"The Windup Girl"|"Paolo Bacigalupi"
12:00|noon|"At noon, an army truck arrives. It’s a huge thing, gouting exhaust, astonishingly loud, like something out of the old Expansion. She can hear it coming from a block away, but even with so much warning, she almost cries out when she sees the thing. So fast. So awfully loud. Once in Japan, Emiko saw a similar vehicle. Gendo-sama explained that it was powered by liquefied coal. Astonishingly dirty and terrible for carbon limits, but almost magically powerful. As if a dozen megodonts were chained within. Perfect for military applications, even if civilians could not justify either the power or the taxation."|"The Windup Girl"|"Paolo Bacigalupi"
00:00|midnight|"A strange silence has settled over the city. A few candles twinkle in windows where people keep midnight watch on the ravaged city, but nothing else is lit. No gas lights in the buildings or on the streets. Total blackness. It seems that either the city’s methane has run out, or someone has finally shut off the mains."|"The Windup Girl"|"Paolo Bacigalupi"
"ap > 03:00"|"After three"|"After the first hour of his work, Hock Seng’s arms are shaking. After three, he can barely stand. He teeters on his creaking ladder as he lowers each new sack, and gasps and shakes his head to clear sweat from his eyes as he waits for the next one to come down."|"The Windup Girl"|"Paolo Bacigalupi"
