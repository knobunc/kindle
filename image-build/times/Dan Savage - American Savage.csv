07:45|"seven forty-five in the morning"|"Fox News called and invited me to debate Bill Donohue about the Folsom poster. As qualified as I am to debate Bill Donohue (I was raised Catholic, my dad was a deacon, I’ve been known to shout), and as much fun as the interview sounded, I had to pass. First, it was Fox News, and I’ve made a policy of passing on Fox News. Second, the interview was scheduled for seven forty-five in the morning New York City time, which would’ve been four forty-five in the morning Seattle time. That’s too early to get into a shouting match with a Catholic to whom I’m not related."|"American Savage"|"Dan Savage"

19:42|1942|"Unlike most of the other boys in my posse, I knew a little gay history. I could also add and subtract. When the older men in the bars were seventeen, it was 1942 or 1932—and it might as well have been 1642 for all the difference it made."|"American Savage"|"Dan Savage"
05:00|"five that morning"|"Early one morning, a few weeks after I got back from Tucson, I was lying in bed listening to the radio. I had been up most of the night. I found it difficult to sleep after coming back home from Arizona, and so, at the urging of a friend, I began taking Ambien, a prescription sleeping pill. It wasn’t@”rkv until I tried to stop taking Ambien that I learned that insomnia is one of the drug’s possible side effects. That’s why I was awake, at five that morning, when a report came on about the impending vote on Washington’s Death with Dignity Act. Two women who had both recently lost their husbands were interviewed about the proposed new law. One of the widows planned to vote for it and the other planned to vote against it."|"American Savage"|"Dan Savage"
22:20|22:20|"But let a gay person bring up Deuteronomy 22:20–21 and the same people who were citing Leviticus 20:13 a minute ago, or standing silently by while others cited Leviticus 20:13, are suddenly up on their feet, loudly objecting to this spurious reference to the Old Testament. (For those of you who have yet committed the Pentateuch to memory—for shame—Deuteronomy 22:20–21 goes a little something like this: “If there is no proof that his bride was a virgin, the men of the town will take the woman to the door of her father’s house and stone her to death. This woman brought evil into your community by sleeping with someone before she got married, and you must get rid of that evil by killing her.”) Every time a gay person brings up a verse from the Old Testament in self-defense, the John Macs of the world start shouting, “Silly faggot! That stuff about girls being stoned to death on their wedding nights is in the Old Testament! That’s not in the New Testament!”"|"American Savage"|"Dan Savage"
