12:00|midday|"Fatefully during his Paduan idyll, while visiting friends outside the city, Galileo and two gentleman companions escaped the
midday heat one afternoon by taking a siesta in an underground room. Natural air-conditioning cooled this chamber by means
of a conduit that delivered wind from a waterfall inside a nearby mountain cave. Such ingenious systems ventilated numerous
sixteenth-century villas in the Italian countryside but may have admitted some noxious vapors along with the welcome zephyrs,
as apparently occurred in Galileo’s case. When the men awoke from their two-hour nap, they complained of various symptoms
including cramps and chills, intense headache, hearing loss, and muscle lethargy. Within days, the strange malaise proved
fatal for one of its victims; the second man lived longer but also died of the same exposure. Galileo alone recovered. For
the rest of his life, however, bouts of pain, later described by his son as arthritic or rheumatic seizures, would strike
him down and confine him to his bed for weeks on end."|"Galileo's Daughter"|"Dava Sobel"
12:00|"high noontime"|"Later Galileo would point out that when the Sun stood still in the biblical account, it did so “in the middle of the sky”—precisely
where the Copernican system placed it. This reference to location could not be taken to mean the Sun had been standing in
the high noontime position, for then Joshua would have found time enough to fight his battle without praying for a miracle
to prolong the day."|"Galileo's Daughter"|"Dava Sobel"
02:30|vigils|"To ban Copernicus now that his doctrine is daily reinforced by many new observations and by the learned applying themselves
to the reading of his book, after this opinion has been allowed and tolerated for those many years during which it was less
followed and less confirmed, would seem in my judgment to be a contravention of truth, and an attempt to hide and suppress
her the more as she revealed herself the more clearly and plainly. Not to abolish and censure his whole book, but only to
condemn as erroneous this particular proposition, would (if I am not mistaken) be a still greater detriment to the minds of
men, since it would afford them occasion to see a proposition proved that it was heresy to believe. And to prohibit the whole
science would be but to censure a hundred passages of Holy Scripture which teach us that the glory and greatness of Almighty
God are marvelously discerned in all His works and divinely read in the open book of Heaven. For let no one believe that reading
the lofty concepts written in that book leads to nothing further than the mere seeing of the splendor of the Sun and the stars
and their rising and setting, which is as far as the eyes of brutes and of the vulgar can penetrate. Within its pages are
couched mysteries so profound and concepts so sublime that the vigils, labors, and studies of hundreds upon hundreds of the
most acute minds have still not pierced them, even after continual investigations for thousands of years."|"Galileo's Daughter"|"Dava Sobel"
"~ 15:17"|"around 1517"|"Stunned by the Protestant Reformation fomented in Germany around 1517, the Roman Church struck a defensive posture throughout
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries called the Counter-Reformation. The Church hoped quickly to close the rift that had
split Protestantism from Catholicism by convening an ecumenical council, but intrigues and obstacles of all sorts— including
disputes over where to stage the event—postponed the meeting for many years, while the rift continued to widen. Finally, Pope
Paul III (the same pontiff honored in the dedication of Copernicus’s book) convened bishops, cardinals, and leaders of religious
orders at Trent, where Italy bordered the Holy Roman Empire of the German nation. On and off over a period of eighteen years,
from 1545 to 1563, the Council of Trent debated and voted and ultimately drafted a series of decrees* These dictated how the clergy were to be educated, for example, and who was empowered to interpret Holy Scripture. Rejecting
Martin Luther’s insistence on the right to a personal reading of the Bible, the council declared in 1546 that “no one, relying
on his own judgment and distorting the Sacred Scriptures according to his own conceptions, shall dare to interpret them.”"|"Galileo's Daughter"|"Dava Sobel"

20:00|20|"THE DISCOMFORT I HAVE ENDURED ever since I came to live in this house, for want of a cell of my own, I know that you know,
Sire, at least in part, and now I shall more clearly explain it to you, telling you that two or three years ago I was compelled
by necessity to leave the one small cell we had, for which we paid our novice mistress (according to the custom we nuns observe)
thirty-six scudi, and give it over totally to Suor Arcangela, so that (as much as possible) she could distance herself from this same mistress,
who, tormented to distraction by her habitual moods, posed a threat, I feared, to Suor Arcangela, who often finds interaction
with others unbearable; beyond that, Suor Arcangela’s nature being very different from mine and rather eccentric, it pays
for me to acquiesce to her in many things, in order to be able to live in the kind of peace and unity befitting the intense
love we bear each other. As a result I spend every night in the disturbing company of the mistress (although I get through
the nights easily enough with the help of the Lord, who suffers me to undergo these tribulations undoubtedly for my own good)
and I pass the days practically a pilgrim, having no place whatsoever where I can retreat for one hour on my own. I do not
yearn for large or very beautiful quarters, but only for a little bit of space, exactly like the tiny room that has just become
available, now that a nun who desperately needs money wants to sell it; and, thanks to Suor Luisa’s having spoken well on
my behalf, this nun prefers me over any of the others offering to buy it. But because its price is 35 scudi, while I have only ten, which Suor Luisa kindly gave me, plus the five I expect from my income, I cannot take possession of
the room, and I rather fear I may lose it, Sire, if you do not assist me with the remaining amount, which is 20 scudi."|"Galileo's Daughter"|"Dava Sobel"

she told Galileo on January 21, 1630. “For my part, I would judge the defect to be in the cord, which, owing to its being
old, no longer glides. Still, as I am unable to fix it, I turn it over to you, so that you can diagnose its deficiency, and
repair it. Perhaps the real defect was with me, in not knowing the right action to take, which is the reason I have left the
