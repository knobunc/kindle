I climbed up into this G2 and they said, “We hope you don’t mind but we are going to have to stop in Sun Valley and pick up another guest.” Clint Eastwood! So all of a sudden we’re feeling like really big shits. There were four of us on the team and after we land in New York we get picked up by a limousine and swept off to the Waldorf Towers: not just the Waldorf, the Waldorf Towers! It was a nine-room suite that had a pool table and a grand piano. Our normal fare was Holiday Inn. They were clearly warming us up.

00:00|midnight|"By the mideighties, the technologists who were creating the future in Silicon Valley started to see themselves as more than simply engineers. Alvy Ray Smith and his midnight crew at Xerox PARC, the game makers at Atari, and the Macintosh team at Apple all became convinced that they were pioneers in a new expressive medium. They felt like designers, authors, even artists—and they wanted to be recognized (and compensated!) as such. But while the engineers fought their individual battles for money and credit, it took a writer from New York City to realize that this new class of creatives added up to a bona fide culture complete with its own lore, jokes, and ethic. Steven Levy made the argument in a popular ethnography entitled Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution, and the weekend-long book party for its release was the first Hackers Conference. At the confab, the hackers of Silicon Valley (and beyond) met each other for the first time and awoke to the fact that they had nearly everything in common."|"Valley of Genius"|"Adam Fisher"

I remember posting it to the announcements board and that I had created this new star system for them and instead of getting a “Hey, thank you, that’s great!” I got “Your colors suck, and your numbers suck and who put you in charge of this?” And the harder they pushed back on my stars, the more I dug in my heels, until somebody shared my personal e-mail address with the community on the forum, and I would come in to the office at you know eight o’clock, open up my e-mail box, and it was full of stars, stars, stars, stars, conversations about stars. Pierre and Jeff had a policy that if a community member e-mailed you, you personally had to respond. You couldn’t just ghost them: You couldn’t not respond. So I would spend the better half of my morning responding to all of these e-mails about the color of the stars, and so after about three days of this, I went to Pierre: “I have to talk to you about the stars.” He says, “Yes, you do.” And I said, “Well, I guess it would be good if I went back and apologized?” He said, “Yes, that’s a good start. And then what are you going to do?” And so I went back and I posted an apology and said, “I’m going to take suggestions for stars’ colors and numbers for the next week. We’re going to take a vote on it and then we’ll implement it.” So the star system wasn’t our star system. It was a star system designed and created and implemented for and by our community.
