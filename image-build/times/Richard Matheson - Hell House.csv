Florence Tanner crossed the yard which separated her small house from the church and walked along the alley to the street. She stood on the sidewalk and gazed at her church. It was only a converted store, but it had been everything to her these past six years. She looked at the sign in the painted window: TEMPLE OF SPIRITUAL HARMONY. She smiled. It was indeed.

Edith finished brushing her teeth and gazed at her reflection in the mirror--at her short-cut auburn hair, her strong, almost masculine features. Her expression was a worried one."|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o'clock"|"Lionel was asleep. She sat on her bed and looked at him, listening to the sound of his heavy breathing. Poor dear, she thought. There had been so much to do. By ten o'clock he'd been exhausted, and she'd made him go to bed."|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"

He couldn't sleep. Fischer opened his eyes and looked around the cabin of Deutsch's private plane. Strange to be sitting in an armchair in an airplane, he thought. Strange to be sitting in an airplane at all. He'd never flown in his life."|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
11:19|"11:19 A.M."|"-----------------
11:19 A.M.
The two black Cadillacs moved along the road, which twisted through dense forest. In the lead car was Deutsch's representative. Dr. Barrett, Edith, Florence Tanner, and Fischer rode in the second, chauffeur-driven limousine, Fischer sitting on the pull-down seat, facing the other three."|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
"ap 06:00"|six|"The man leaned over. ""We're at the turnoff,"" he said. ""Your chauffeur is going into Caribou Falls with us, so one of you will have to drive to the house--it's just a little way.

11:47|"11:47 A.M."|"Fischer answered without looking back. ""Expect anything,"" he said.
11:47 A.M.
For the past five minutes Fischer had been inching the Cadillac along the narrow, fog-bound road. Now he braked and stopped the engine. ""We're here."" he said. He wrenched up the door handle and ducked outside, buttoning his Navy pea coat."|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
"ap 07:31"|7:31|"Fischer pointed the flashlight at the large electric wall clock above the stove. Its hands were stopped at 7:31. A.M. or P.M., and on what day? Barrett wondered as he limped along the wall to his right, pulling open drawers. Edith and Florence stood together, watching him. Barrett pulled open one of the cupboard doors and grunted as Fischer shone the light over. ""Genuine spirits,"" he said, looking at the shelves of dust-filmed bottles. ""Perhaps we'll raise some after supper."""|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
12:19|"12:19 P.M."|"""The food wasn't aimed at their hearts,"" said Fischer, taking a box of candles from the drawer.

12:46|"12:46 P.M."|"""Do you?"" Fischer's smile was strange as he looked at the phonograph. ""We all had our attention on that a few moments ago,"" he said. ""How do you know he didn't walk right by us while we were listening?""
12:46 P.M.
They were moving up the staircase when an icy breeze passed over them, causing their candle flames to flicker. Edith's flame went out. ""What was that?"" she whispered."|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
14:21|"2:21 P.M."|"He wasn't going to do anything prematurely, that was certain. He wasn't going to do a thing until he got the feel of the place.

Fischer came into the great hall carrying his flashlight. He had changed into a black turtleneck sweater, black corduroy trousers, and a pair of scuffed white tennis shoes. His steps were soundless as he moved toward the huge round table where Barrett, seated, and Edith, standing, were opening wooden boxes and unloading equipment. In the fireplace, a fire was burning."|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
14:53|"2:53 P.M."|"Edith put the list down numbly. My God, she thought. What kind of week was it going to be?
2:53 P.M.
The garage had been built to accommodate seven automobiles. Now it was empty. As they entered, Fischer thumbed off his flashlight, enough daylight filtering through the grimy door windows for them to see. He looked at the greenish mist which pressed against the panes of glass."|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"

After that, his mother called him Evil Emeric."""|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
20:46|"8:46 P.M."|"""Belasco was not among them.""
8:46 P.M.
Florence came walking back across the great hall. For the past ten minutes, she'd been sitting in a corner, ""preparing herself,"" she'd told them. Now she was ready. ""As ready as one can be in this kind of climate. Excessive dampness is always a handicap."" She smiled. ""Shall we take our places?"""|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
21:49|"9:49 P.M."|"""Just watch your step,"" he cut her off. ""The Lord may not have too much influence in Hell House.""

_Science is more than a body of facts. It is, first and foremost, a method of investigation, and there is no acceptable reason why parapsychological phenomena should not be investigated by this method, for, as much as physics and chemistry, parapsychology is a science of the natural._"|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
22:21|"10:21 P.M."|"Barrett chuckled. ""Nary a one.""

The hot stream of water sprayed off Florence's upper chest and rivuleted down between her breasts. She stood in the shower stall, head back, eyes shut, feeling the ribbons of water lace across her stomach and down her thighs and legs."|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"

Florence knocked softly on the door to Fischer's room. When there was no answer, she knocked again. ""Ben?"" she called."|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
"> 20:00"|"just past twenty"|"Florence nodded. ""But he did. He's here now, suffering, tormented. He must have gone into spirit at an early age-- just past twenty, I feel.

I believe if we can convince him to go on, a portion of the haunting force will be eliminated."""|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
13:17|"1:17 P.M."|"Barrett smiled with satisfaction. Now he could move.

The lights went on, and, in unison, all four uttered sounds of pleasure. ""I'll be damned,"""|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"

The cabinet had been constructed in the northeast corner of the great hall by the installation of an eight-foot-long round wooden bar between the walls. A pair of heavy green draperies was hanging from the bar on rings, forming a triangular enclosure seven feet high."|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
14:19|"2:19 P.M."|"At her.
2:19 P.M.
""Too tight?"" asked Barrett."|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"

16:23|"4:23 P.M."|"""Help her now,"" he said.
4:23 P.M.
Edith woke with a start. She checked her watch and saw that she'd been sleeping more than an hour."|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
16:46|"4:46 P.M."|"""To prove a point. That figure was undoubtedly supposed to be Belasco's son--a son who, I'm convinced, never existed.""

The cat lay warmly indolent beside her. Its body throbbed with purrs as Florence stroked its neck."|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
18:21|"6:21 P.M."|"It was a plea as well.
6:21 P.M.
Florence walked into the dining hall. ""Good evening,"" she said."|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
18:48|"6:48 P.M."|"He lurched away. Still moving, he glanced back at her. ""You're the one who'd better leave,"" he said. ""You're the one who's being used, not me.""
6:48 P.M.
Barrett sat down gingerly. ""My bag,"" he murmured. Edith let go of his arm and hurried to the Spanish table, lifting off the small black bag in which he kept his codeine and first-aid kit."|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
20:09|"8:09 P.M."|"Edith nodded, trying to suppress the rise of panic in herself. _Five more days of this_, she thought.
8:09 P.M.
As she paced restlessly, her mind kept going over it again and again. Was Barrett right?"|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
22:18|"10:18 P.M."|"She held herself in check until she'd returned to her room. There she sat down on the edge of her bed and started to cry. ""You're wrong,"" she whispered. ""Don't you see? You're wrong. You're _wrong_.""
10:18 P.M.
Edith lay on her back, staring at the ceiling. She'd closed her eyes a dozen times, only to open them again in seconds. She couldn't conceive of falling asleep. It seemed an impossibility to her."|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
23:23|"11:23 P.M."|"There couldn't be anyone looking at her. There were no such things as ghosts. Lionel had said so; Lionel knew. She closed her eyes. There are no such things as ghosts, she told herself. No one is looking at me. There are no such things as ghosts. _Dear God in heaven, there are no such things as ghosts_.
11:23 P.M.
Fischer broke the seal on the bottle and unscrewed its cap. He poured two inches of bourbon into a glass and set down the bottle. Picking up the glass, he swirled the liquor around."|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
23:56|"11:56 P.M."|"Now the house was getting to her as well.
11:56 P.M.
Something kept drawing her to the cellar. Florence descended the stairs and pushed through the swinging metal door that opened on the swimming pool. She remembered the feeling she'd had when she and Fischer had looked into the steam room yesterday: a sense of something perverted, something unwholesome. She could not resign that feeling to what she felt about Belasco's son."|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
06:47|"6:47 A.M."|"-----------------
6:47 A.M.
The distant scream cut like a knife into Edith's sleep. She twitched awake, staring upward in confusion. A sound of rustling made her jerk around. Lionel was propped on his left elbow, looking at her."|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
07:29|"7:29 A.M."|"_Was there really something down there?_
7:29 A.M.
Fischer drove the crowbar edge into the cleft, and, straining, levered out another chunk of brick and mortar. It had taken him more than twenty minutes to gouge away an opening no larger than his fist. His pants and tennis shoes were streaked with mortar stains; there was a film of powder on his hands. He sneezed as mortar dust got up his nostrils. Turning, he withdrew his handkerchief and blew his nose. He looked at Florence, who was watching him with anxious eyes. She forced a smile. ""I know it's hard."""|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
08:16|"8:16 A.M."|"Across the crest, in scroll-like letters, were the initials ""D. B.""

08:31|"8:31 A.M."|"he said.

So this broken body has released the spirit which shall never return to it again. This body has served its purpose, it can serve that purpose no more. Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Amen."""|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
09:14|"9:14 A.M."|"As she washed the wounds, she heard the cat outside the door, raking its claws through the wood and making the horrible noise in its throat.

""It's big,"" Edith said."|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
10:43|"10:43 A.M."|"""I don't intend to stand by knowingly and allow you to become yet one more victim of Hell House,"" Barrett told her. He snapped his bag shut, picked it up. ""My dear?"" he said. Struggling to his feet, he turned for the door.
10:43 A.M.
Edith turned onto her right side and looked at the other bed. Lionel was asleep. She should never have let him work on that crate. They should have asked Fischer to open it."|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
11:16|"11:16 A.M."|"""_I am not losing control_,"" she told him stiffly. She turned and went inside her room.
11:16 A.M.
Florence started as someone knocked on the door. ""Come in."""|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"""She was a fanatic,"" Fischer said. ""When I started showing signs of mediumship at nine, she devoted her existence to it."" His smile was humorless. ""My existence, too."""|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
12:16|"12:16 P.M."|"He left the room without another word.
12:16 P.M.
The cool water rippling against his face felt good. The skin of his burned calf had contracted, making it painful to kick, but he didn't want to stop. Every time he lifted his right hand from the water, the pain in his thumb intensified. I need this, though, he thought. He hadn't been swimming for almost a week."|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
12:47|"12:47 P.M."|"Suddenly the door was shoving in behind him, pushing him directly into the gelatinous form. It struck his face; his screaming mouth was filled with turgid jelly. Coldness washed across his side. He felt hands slip beneath his arms. He thought he heard Edith screaming. Someone started dragging him across the floor. Looking up, he made out Fischer's face above him, pale and indistinct. Just before he lost consciousness, Barrett saw his body. There was nothing on it.
12:47 P.M.
Fischer gulped down coffee, holding the cup with both hands. Once again the couple from Caribou Falls had come and gone, unseen."|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
13:57|"1:57 P.M."|"""And now I'm back,"" he muttered in a trembling voice. ""I'm _back_."" He closed his eyes and couldn't stop from shaking. _How?_ he thought. I'm not afraid to try, but how do I begin? A rage of bewilderment clamped his muscles suddenly. Jerking open his eyes, he grabbed his cup and hurled it far across the room. _It's too damn complicated!_ screamed his mind.
1:57 P.M.
She blinked her eyes. Lionel was awake. She put her hand in his. ""Are you all right?"""|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
14:21|"2:21 P.M."|"She stared at him, feeling lost and helpless. She had no faith of her own remaining. She could only cling to his. God help us if you're wrong, she thought.

""O Spirit of Immortal Truth,"" Florence began, ""help us, this day, to rise above the doubts and fears of this life. Open our natures to mighty revelations. Give us eyes to see, and ears to hear. Bless us in our efforts to lift the darkness from the world."""|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
15:47|"3:47 P.M."|"Fischer eyed her guardedly. ""I hope I do,"" he said.

Somewhere there was music playing, slowly, tenderly; a waltz. She was dancing to the music, gliding through a kind of mist. Was she in the ballroom? She could not be sure. Her partner's face was indistinct, yet she felt certain it was Daniel's. She could feel his arm around her and his left hand holding out her right. It was warm. There was a scent of flowers in the air; roses, she decided. A summer dance. A small string orchestra performing. Florence danced in languorous circles with her partner."|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
18:11|"6:11 P.M."|"_One way only_.
6:11 P.M.
Fischer stood at the edge of the tarn, shining his flashlight at the turbid surface of the water. Twice now, he was thinking. Edith first, then Florence. He moved the cone of light across the water, grimacing at the stench which hovered over it. Once when he'd been working in a hospital, an old man had died of gangrenous wounds on his back. The smell of his room had been like this."|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
"< 00:00"|"Near midnight"|"""Near midnight. You were asleep."" Fischer paused for emphasis. ""So was she."""|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"

Barrett stood beside the bed, looking at Edith, wondering whether to wake her or not. The food was getting cold; but was it food she needed, or rest?"|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"

_. . . Daniel, please. You have to understand. What you ask is inconceivable. You know that. It isn't that I have no sympathy. I do. I've opened up my heart completely to you. I believe in you and trust you. You saved my life. Now let me save your soul._"|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"

Barrett's eyes were slitted as he climbed the stairway slowly, his arm across Edith's shoulders. He tried not to put too much weight on her, tried not to make any sounds of pain. She'd had enough distress today; and it was only temporary, after all. Another pill, a good night's sleep, and he'd be fit enough by morning. He could endure the pain another day or so.

""There it stands! Your conqueror!"" He had to lean against the archway wall. He felt exhausted, racked by pain. It doesn't matter, he told himself. Whatever pain he felt was secondary now. He'd worry later about Fischer and Miss Tanner, worry afterward about Edith and himself. There was only one thing that mattered at this moment: his defeat of Hell House and the victory of his work.
10:33 A.M.
She felt herself begin to rise from darkness. Daniel's voice cajoled her. _You don't have to sleep_, he said. She seemed to feel her veins and arteries compressing, tissues drawing in, her body forcing out the darkness. There was burning pressure in her kidneys. She tried to hold it back but was unable to. The pressure kept building. _Go on_, Daniel told her; _let it go_."|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
11:08|"11:08 A.M."|"Slowly, agonizingly, she reached out to shape the moving scarlet ribbons.
11:08 A.M.
Fischer jarred up, heartbeat pounding, and looked around in dread. His head was throbbing violently. He wanted to fall back on the pillow, but something kept him from it."|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
11:47|"11:47 A.M."|"""It looks like the letter 'B.'""
11:47 A.M.
They stood in the doorway, watching Fischer's slowly moving form until it vanished in the mist. Then Barrett turned."|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
12:00|noon|"Exactly noon. Fittingly precise, he thought. He pushed the watch into his pocket and turned to Edith. ""We have to go."""|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
12:45|"12:45 P.M."|"Behind those windowless walls some several hundred yards distant, Hell House was dying.
12:45 P.M.
Barrett snapped his watch cover shut. ""It's done."""|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
14:01|"2:01 P.M."|"But not with the reek of the dead.
2:01 P.M.
Fischer braked a little as the Cadillac moved into another pocket of impenetrable mist."|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
14:17|"2:17 P.M."|"Why, then, was his foot pressing down harder and harder on the accelerator? Why was his heart beginning to pound? Why was there an icy prickling on the back of his neck? _Why did he have this constantly increasing dread that he had to get back to the house before it was too late?_
2:17 P.M.
Barrett came out of the bathroom, wearing robe and slippers. He limped to Edith's bed and sat on the edge of it. She was lying down, the comforter pulled over her. ""Feeling better?"" she asked."|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
14:46|"2:46 P.M."|"Then all was blackness, like a shroud enfolding him, as he descended into night.
2:46 P.M.
Edith's left hand jumped abruptly. Her wedding band had sheared in half and fallen to the bed. She snapped her eyelids back. The room was dark. ""Lionel?"""|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
15:31|"3:31 P.M."|"Madness took her then. She backed off, screaming, stumbling out into the corridor. A figure came leaping down the stairs and grabbed her by the arms. She fought it with demented strength, shrieks of frenzy flooding from her throat. The figure shouted at her, but she heard only her own voice. Something struck her on the jaw, and suddenly she was falling, screaming endlessly, as she went plummeting into the depths.
3:31 P.M.
Edith stirred again. Her eyes fluttered open. For several moments she stared toward the front of the car. Then she turned in confusion, twitching as she saw him. She looked at him in questioning silence."|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
18:29|"6:29 P.M."|"As he crossed the entry hall, he had the feeling that the house was swallowing him alive.
6:29 P.M.
Fischer sat at the huge round table in the great hall, eating a sandwich and drinking a cup of coffee; Edith had brought two sacks of food and left again without a word. It's insane, Fischer was thinking. He'd thought it endlessly for the past hour."|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
02:00|"2:00 A.M."|"He reached the altar and looked at the open Bible. The page he saw was headed BIRTHS. ""Daniel Myron Belasco was born at 2:00 A.M. on November 4, 1903."" He felt a chilling disappointment. That wasn't it; it couldn't be."|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
19:58|"7:58 P.M."|"Belasco had told him so.
7:58 P.M.
For the past half-hour Fischer had been hunched in the corner of the seat, face as white as chalk, teeth chattering, arms crossed across his stomach, eyes unblinking for minutes at a time, staring sightlessly ahead. His shaking had kept dislodging the blanket from his shoulders; Edith had had to draw it around him repeatedly. Fischer had not responded to her attentions in any way. She might have been invisible to him."|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
"ap > 08:00"|"Just past eight"|"Edith looked at her watch and saw that it had stopped. She twisted around to look at the dashboard. ""Just past eight."""|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
20:36|"8:36 P.M."|"His laugh was cold with defeat. ""His final jest. Even though we actually know his secret now, there's not a damn thing we can do about it.""
8:36 P.M.
Fischer held back as they reached the house. Edith turned to face him. He was staring at the doors. ""What is it?"" she asked."|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
21:12|"9:12 P.M."|"""_The walls, door, and ceiling are sheathed with lead_.""
9:12 P.M.
The two walked slowly down the steps, Edith carrying her suitcase, Fischer carrying Barrett's suitcase and his duffel bag."|"Hell House"|"Richard Matheson"
