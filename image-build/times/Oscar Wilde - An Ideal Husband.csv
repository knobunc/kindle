10:00|"ten o'clock in the morning"|"MABEL CHILTERN. How can you say such a thing? Why, he rides in the Row at ten o'clock in the morning, goes to the Opera three times a week, changes his clothes at least five times a day, and dines out every night of the season. You don't call that leading an idle life, do you?"|"An Ideal Husband"|"Oscar Wilde"
04:00|"four o'clock in the morning"|"LORD CAVERSHAM. Well, sir! what are you doing here? Wasting your life as usual! You should be in bed, sir. You keep too late hours! I heard of you the other night at Lady Rufford's dancing till four o'clock in the morning!"|"An Ideal Husband"|"Oscar Wilde"

LORD GORING. Only a quarter to four, father.
LORD CAVERSHAM. Can't make out how you stand London Society. The thing has gone to the dogs, a lot of damned nobodies talking about nothing."|"An Ideal Husband"|"Oscar Wilde"

"ap 11:30"|"half-past eleven"|"MRS. CHEVELEY. Yes. That is agreed. I will be in the Ladies' Gallery to-morrow night at half-past eleven. If by that time – and you will have had heaps of opportunity – you have made an announcement to the House in the terms I wish, I shall hand you back your letter with the prettiest thanks, and the best, or at any rate the most suitable, compliment I can think of. I intend to play quite fairly with you. One should always play fairly ... when one has the winning cards. The Baron taught me that ... amongst other things."|"An Ideal Husband"|"Oscar Wilde"

"ap 05:30"|five-thirty|"LORD GORING settling his buttonhole. Oh, I should fancy Mrs. Cheveley is one of those very modern women of our time who find a new scandal as becoming as a new bonnet, and air them both in the Park every afternoon at five-thirty. I am sure she adores scandals, and that the sorrow of her life at present is that she can't manage to have enough of them."|"An Ideal Husband"|"Oscar Wilde"
"ap 01:00"|one|"MRS. CHEVELEY rising. I don't mind waiting in the carriage at all, provided there is somebody to look at one."|"An Ideal Husband"|"Oscar Wilde"
12:00|noon|"MRS. CHEVELEY. My worst? I have not yet finished with you, with either of you. I give you both till to-morrow at noon. If by then you don't do what I bid you to do, the whole world shall know the origin of Robert Chiltern."|"An Ideal Husband"|"Oscar Wilde"
"ap 10:00"|"Ten o'clock"|"LORD GORING. That will do. Exit Phipps. Lady Chiltern's handwriting on Lady Chiltern's pink notepaper. That is rather curious. I thought Robert was to write. Wonder what Lady Chiltern has got to say to me? Sits at bureau and opens letter, and reads it. »I want you. I trust you. I am coming to you. Gertrude.« Puts down the letter with a puzzled look. Then takes it up, and reads it again slowly. »I want you. I trust you. I am coming to you.« She has found out everything! Poor woman! Poor woman! Pulls out watch and looks at it. But what an hour to call! Ten o'clock! I shall have to give up going to the Berkshires. However, it is always nice to be expected, and not to arrive. I am not expected at the Bachelors', so I shall certainly go there. Well, I will make her stand by her husband. That is the only thing for any woman to do. It is the growth of the moral sense of women that makes marriage such a hopeless, one-sided institution. Ten o'clock. She should be here soon. I must tell Phipps I am not in to any one else. Goes towards bell."|"An Ideal Husband"|"Oscar Wilde"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o'clock"|"LORD CAVERSHAM. Well, sir, it is only ten o'clock. What is your objection to the hour? I think the hour is an admirable hour!"|"An Ideal Husband"|"Oscar Wilde"

"ap 11:00"|eleven|"SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Arthur, you must let me stay for five minutes. I have made up my mind what I am going to do to-night in the House. The debate on the Argentine Canal is to begin at eleven. A chair falls in the drawing-room. What is that!"|"An Ideal Husband"|"Oscar Wilde"
"ap 10:30"|"half-past ten"|"LORD GORING. At half-past ten. And now I propose that we tell Robert the whole thing at once."|"An Ideal Husband"|"Oscar Wilde"
22:30|"half-past ten o'clock at night"|"LADY CHILTERN looking at him with amazement that is almost terror. You want me to tell Robert that the woman you expected was not Mrs. Cheveley, but myself? That it was I whom you thought was concealed in a room in your house, at half-past ten o'clock at night? You want me to tell him that?"|"An Ideal Husband"|"Oscar Wilde"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. As you choose. When I called on you yesterday evening I found Mrs. Cheveley concealed in your rooms. It was between ten and eleven o'clock at night. I do not wish to say anything more. Your relations with Mrs. Cheveley have, as I said to you last night, nothing whatsoever to do with me. I know you were engaged to be married to her once. The fascination she exercised over you then seems to have returned. You spoke to me last night of her as of a woman pure and stainless, a woman whom you respected and honoured. That may be so. But I cannot give my sister's life into your hands. It would be wrong of me. It would be unjust, infamously unjust to her."|"An Ideal Husband"|"Oscar Wilde"
