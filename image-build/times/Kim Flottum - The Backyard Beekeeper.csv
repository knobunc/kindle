10:00|"10:00 am"|"One of the greatest challenges to urban beekeeping is having bees near a neighbor’s swimming pool. Fences may minimize contact, but the attraction of all that chlorinated water can be an irresistible force. Make sure your water source never dries up, and install screens to get the bees’ flight path high above any swimmers.Bee TemperamentGentle bees are easier and more fun to manage. Due to studied, deliberate breeding programs, the bees you buy today are gentler than the bees available twenty years ago. Breeders and producers have selectively bred for gentleness for decades. Every line of bees is different though, and sometimes gentleness is more subdued.Experience is the best teacher when it comes to judging your bees’ character, but here are some guidelines to look for when evaluating your bees for gentleness:• Guard bees should not greet you before you get to the hive. They should stay in the hive or at the entrance. This doesn’t include bees leaving to forage.• In even a large colony you should not have many bees in the air after 10 minutes of having the colony open. A light puff of smoke should keep all the bees inside and between frames. There should be very few in the air when you remove the cover and inner cover.• Bees should remain relatively still on top bars when you remove the inner cover.• When a frame is lifted, the bees should remain calm, and should not fly away or become agitated.• Slow, easy movements should help you avoid any stings. Being stung should be the exception rather than the rule.• Bees should not run or fly out of a super when it is removed from the hive and set aside.• After examining a colony no bees should follow you more than a few steps from the hive.In addition, you have to work with your bees in such a way so they’ll stay gentle. Follow the guidelines below to keep your actions to a minimum, and to engage your bees as little as possible.• Only examine your colonies on sunny, wind-free, mild days (temperature between 65°F [18°C] and 98°F [37°C]) so the bees can take advantage of the honey flow.• Absolutely avoid working colonies when it’s cool, rainy, windy, cloudy, going to storm, or just finished storming.• Don’t start too early in the day, or too late in the evening. Between 10:00 am and 4:00 pm is usually the best time because that’s when the temperature is the warmest, the wind the least likely to be blowing, and the most bees out foraging.• Always be gentle when opening the colony. Quick movements and loud, snapping sounds irritate the bees.• Use enough smoke to make working the bees comfortable, but don’t overdo it. Too much smoke will overdose the bees and soon they won’t react to it at all.• Keep your bee suit clean, and wash it often. The occasional sting on the suit will allow venom to build up, giving off an “alarming“ odor to the bees.• A manipulating cloth, which is a canvas and wire device that covers all of the frames of an open colony except the one you are working on, keeps bees contained and in the dark.If your bees are not very gentle, and they begin to sting people and cause trouble, you can requeen the colony. (See page 90 for more information on requeening.)So, again, all the regular rules apply: screens, fences, gates, and buildings—anywhere the colonies are—should be out of sight. Neutral-colored hives work well, certainly better than white boxes, and living screens are effective—all this for ground-or near-ground level colonies. But remember the sun: Honey bee colonies do better in the sun. It keeps the bees warmer and drier, and makes it easier to dehydrate honey. It’s a trade-off. If the screens, fences, and gates are high enough to keep busy eyes away, they are probably high enough to keep sunlight off the bees most of the day. Try to locate your ground-resting colonies such that you only need two or three sides screened so that some sun gets to the bees in the morning or afternoon. They’ll be happier, and so will you."|"The Backyard Beekeeper"|"Kim Flottum"

12:00|midday|"As with backyards, when working colonies in an urban setting you have to consider the people and pets that may be near you. Honey bees will defend their nest if they are threatened, and opening a colony is easily and often considered a threat. If your bees are close to where other people are you want to open and work colonies when there are the fewest bees in the hive, which is midday during a honey flow when many of the older foragers are away, and many of the house bees are busy handling any nectar being brought back."|"The Backyard Beekeeper"|"Kim Flottum"
"ap 01:00"|one|"RobbingHoney bee foragers have a fundamental goal—finding food. Most often that food is nectar or pollen from flowers. Other food sources can include floral food, sugar syrup in a feeder, or honey found in another hive. Small, weak colonies with few guards are unable to defend themselves from an onslaught of foragers from other hives, but they will try. Guards will fight to the death to keep strangers from stealing their hard-won stores, but if they are overwhelmed, the colony will be robbed of all of its honey, and in the process, many of the bees will be killed.Beekeepers can inadvertently expose a weak colony to robbing by opening it during a dearth, or at any time foragers from other colonies are having difficulty finding food. Opening the colony sends an aromatic message—food!There are several signs that a colony is being robbed, and it pays to recognize them before the colony is destroyed. There will be many bees at the entrance fighting, with workers balling up together with five, six, or maybe ten in a ball. There will be individuals rolling on the landing board and falling off, and all the time more and more bees arriving at the colony. Bees from one, two, maybe all the rest of the colonies in your yard can become involved.Because of the mayhem and fighting, alarm phero mone fills the air. You may even smell the banana-like odor. Guards rush out of their colonies searching for the source of the alarm pheromone but will be unable to locate a typical intruder. When this happens, they can become defensive in a hurry, stinging everything and anything for several yards in all directions. A robbing situation can become fatal for the robbed colony and dangerous for people and pets in the area. If you suspect the colony you are working, or perhaps one you just finished, is being robbed, you have a responsibility to protect that colony before it succumbs. Immediately reduce entrances to all colonies in your yard using entrance reducers or even handfuls of grass. Apply smoke to every colony to disorient the inhabitants and disrupt their rush to rob. Close up the colony that is being robbed, making sure that upper entrances are closed. Seal off the front door with a reducer and grass. This stops outside bees from entering and allows the colony being robbed to reassemble its forces. Honey robbing by outsider bees can begin during a beekeeper’s inspection, when honey is exposed. If robbing begins, close up all colonies as fast as you can. Restrict the entrances of the colonies doing the robbing by inserting grass or a reducer, and completely close up the colony that is being robbed until the behavior ceases. A weak colony can be killed by robbing bees during the melee.Bees that were robbing will continue to investigate previous openings, trying to gain entrance. If you’ve done your job, they won’t be able to enter and in anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours, the turbulence in the area of the colony subsides. When it appears that life is back to normal, it will be safe to slightly open one entrance to the colony that was being robbed. Leave the entrance reduced for days, or even weeks if the colony remains small or weak. Don’t work any colony during a dearth, and know and watch for signs of robbing. It may be the worst thing that can happen to your colony and to your good reputation as a beekeeper."|"The Backyard Beekeeper"|"Kim Flottum"
"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"If food is dispersed evenly, foragers exploit nearby areas, circling the colony. This is seldom the case, however, because flowering trees, shrubs, and weeds grow where they can, rather than where bees would prefer them. And as the season progresses, bees’ tastes change. Therefore, the forage area changes from day to day. To add to this complexity, some plants produce flowers, nectar, and pollen during only part of the day. Cucumbers, for instance, bloom from very early in the morning until about noon, when their blossoms wither. Bees visiting a cucumber patch learn the daily schedule and visit during the morning only. They may turn their attention elsewhere in the afternoon or take the rest of the day off."|"The Backyard Beekeeper"|"Kim Flottum"
