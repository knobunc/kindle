         She was too scared to hold out on him, usually, but she’d needed wiz money."|"Mona Lisa Overdrive"|"William Gibson"
12:00|noon|"She spent fifty on the clothes. She worked her way through eighteen racks in four
         shops, everything the mall had, before she made up her mind. The vendors didn’t like
         her trying on so many things, but it was the most she’d ever had to spend. It was
         noon before she’d finished, and the Florida sun was cooking the pavement as she crossed
         the parking lot with her two plastic bags. The bags, like the clothes, were secondhand:
         one was printed with the logo of a Ginza shoe store, the other advertised Argentinian
         seafood briquettes molded from reconstituted krill. She was mentally mixing and matching
         the things she’d bought, figuring out different outfits."|"Mona Lisa Overdrive"|"William Gibson"
00:00|midnight|"Half a block on, the grim street empty—Kumiko had never seen an empty street before, aside from Swain’s crescent shrouded in midnight snow—Sally came to
         a halt beside an ancient and utterly unpromising storefront, its twin display windows
         silvered with a rich inner coating of dust. Peering in, Kumiko made out the glass-tube
         letters of an unlit neon sign: METRO, then a longer word. The door between the windows
         had been reinforced with a sheet of corrugated steel; rusting eyebolts protruded at
         intervals, strung with slack lengths of galvanized razor wire."|"Mona Lisa Overdrive"|"William Gibson"
12:00|noon|"Something moved behind the slot, its color the unhealthy pink of hot cigarette ash
         in noon sunlight, and Kumiko’s face was washed with a stutter of light."|"Mona Lisa Overdrive"|"William Gibson"
00:00|midnight|"But did it wake, Kumiko wondered, when the alley was empty? Did its laser vision scan
         the silent fall of midnight snow?"|"Mona Lisa Overdrive"|"William Gibson"

"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"The woman must’ve gotten in sometime after midnight, she figured later, because it
         was after Prior came back with the crabs, the second bag of crabs. They really did
         have some good crabs in Baltimore, and coming off a run always gave her an appetite,
         so she’d talked him into going back for some more. Gerald kept coming in to change
         the derms on her arms; she’d give him her best goofy smile every time, squish the
         trank out of them when he’d gone, and then stick them back on. Finally Gerald said
         she should get some sleep; he put out the lights and turned down the fake window to
         its lowest setting, a bloodred sunset."|"Mona Lisa Overdrive"|"William Gibson"
