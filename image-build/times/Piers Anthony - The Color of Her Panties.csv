00:00|midnight|"""I will come again tomorrow morning and show you the best route. That will be my good deed for that day."" Then the figure turned smoky, clouding up. ""Oh, I forgot; this is my last day! At midnight I must exchange with my successor, the Maiden Taiwan. Oops, I mean the Matron Taiwan; she's not exactly a maiden anymore. Or maybe Sofia. I will not be able to guide you."""|"The Color of Her Panties"|"Piers Anthony"
00:00|midnight|"There was the gold coast gold lace panty, trimmed with long chains of tinkling goldfish. When Mela walked or swayed there was gentle music. And the royal midnight blue panty, with a small silver moon complete with tiny moon moths and shining silver stars woven in. As she walked, the stars progressed across the flexing heaven, and the moon waxed and waned mysteriously. That almost satisfied her, but she was concerned about wearing it in daylight. The stars might fall out in the heat of the sun."|"The Color of Her Panties"|"Piers Anthony"
12:00|noon|"Next day they thanked the ministree for its hospitality, promised to treat plants and trees with respect, and set out refreshed. By noon they reached the Gap Chasm. It was as awesome as it had been from the other side."|"The Color of Her Panties"|"Piers Anthony"
12:00|"high noon"|"""Yes. And he is threatening to tell it to every child in Goblin Mountain, if he isn't made chief by high noon tomorrow."""|"The Color of Her Panties"|"Piers Anthony"
12:00|noon|"Sammy bounded off. But Che stretched out his hands and caught the sides of the chamber door. The spider cable went taut, holding the cat back. ""I didn't say to find him, Sammy!"" he said. ""I was asking Nada."" Then, to her: ""You see, we used up much of the night getting here, and our champion has to be there at noon tomorrow. If we go searching all over Xanth for him, we may be too late for Gwenny."""|"The Color of Her Panties"|"Piers Anthony"
12:00|noon|"""Yes, certainly, I will be Gwendolyn's champion,"" Naldo said. ""I shall be glad to facilitate the succession of the first female goblin chief."" He glanced at the bones. ""But first I must finish my game here.""
""But the champion must be there by noon!""
""Never fear, I'll be there. Goblin Mountain is not all that far from here, and I can travel rapidly in my large serpent form. Just put out a direction sign indicating exactly where the match is to occur, and I will appear promptly at noon."""|"The Color of Her Panties"|"Piers Anthony"

"> 12:00"|"after noon"|"As dawn came, Che reached Goblin Mountain. The sentry recognized him and let him pass. ""But after noon, you'll be horsemeat, you little winged freak,"" the goblin said pleasantly."|"The Color of Her Panties"|"Piers Anthony"
12:00|noon|"""Naldo Naga's coming at noon,"" he gasped. ""To be your champion. Put out a sign saying where the contest is to be."" Then he found a pile of pillows waiting for him and collapsed into them. He was asleep almost before he landed, but knew that the girls would take care of things."|"The Color of Her Panties"|"Piers Anthony"
"< 12:00"|"almost noon"|"Ida was worried. It was almost noon, and Naldo Naga had not yet shown up. It wasn't that she didn't believe him, but that she feared that something could happen to delay him, and that would be disastrous."|"The Color of Her Panties"|"Piers Anthony"
12:00|Noon|"Noon neared and still Naldo did not appear. Gwenny looked nervous. ""Are you sure you told him here, at noon?"" she asked Che, who had dragged himself up from his slumber for this occasion."|"The Color of Her Panties"|"Piers Anthony"
12:00|noon|"""Well, he'd better be here at noon, or you forfeit. Won't that be awful, ha-ha."" And the henchmen joined him, laughing coarsely."|"The Color of Her Panties"|"Piers Anthony"
12:00|Noon|"""Noon!"" Gobble cried exultantly. ""Come on, Smithereen! Time for the bashing!"""|"The Color of Her Panties"|"Piers Anthony"
