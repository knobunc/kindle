"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"‘I am speaking to you,’ he said, ’from the Cabinet Room at 10 Downing Street. This morning the British Ambassador in Berlin handed the German Government a final note stating that unless we heard from them by eleven o’clock that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, a state of war would exist between us."|"Good Night, Mr. Tom"|"Michelle Magorian"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"Zach glanced at the clock on the bookcase and stood up. ‘I say,’ he exclaimed, ‘it’s nine o’clock. Thanks awfully for the tea, Mr Oakley. May I come round tomorrow and see Will?’"|"Good Night, Mr. Tom"|"Michelle Magorian"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"Willie watched Mrs Hartridge approach him and Zach. Zach told her his age, which was nine, and spelt out his name, apologizing for it at the same time. She smiled. Willie handed her his label and said nothing. Her long flaxen hair was coiled up in a thick plait at the top of her head. Willie gazed with pleasure at her soft, pink-cheeked face and then suddenly his heart fell."|"Good Night, Mr. Tom"|"Michelle Magorian"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"‘It’s nine o’clock,’ cried Alec in alarm. ‘I’ve to do the milkin’ tomorrow mornin’. Goodnight, Mr Oakley. Thank you,’ he yelled, running out of the church."|"Good Night, Mr. Tom"|"Michelle Magorian"
"ap 08:45"|"quarter to nine"|"At a quarter to nine Willie had walked in, accompanied by Zach. The twins had followed soon after. By five minutes to nine George had arrived, looking very pale and swollen-eyed and wearing a black armband. He smiled weakly at Willie. His brother Michael had been reported ‘Missing, believed dead.’ A memorial service had been held for him the previous day and the village had given the Vicar money towards a plaque to be placed in the church."|"Good Night, Mr. Tom"|"Michelle Magorian"

03:00|"three a.m."|"One night he awoke violently from a nightmare. In the dream, he had been locked into a tiny space with no air inside. It was as though he was being buried alive. But it was the voice that had woken him. He thought he had heard William calling out to him for help. He woke with a jerk only to find Sammy standing by his bedside, panting. He staggered out of bed and fumbled his way towards the bedroom window. Carefully easing the blackout curtains to one side he peered out. It was still dark. He opened the door, walked across the hallway to the living room and looked at the clock. It was three a.m. Almost time for his fire duty anyway. He’d go and relieve Hubert Pullett early. He pulled his corduroys, thick jersey and boots on over his pyjamas, and stepped outside into the damp night slinging his trench-coat, cap and gas-mask on as he walked. Sammy followed him dragging a bit of old blanket in his teeth."|"Good Night, Mr. Tom"|"Michelle Magorian"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"It was nine o’clock when the train pulled into London. He clambered out with Sammy and stood on the platform feeling totally dazed. The noise was deafening. Hundreds of uniformed figures swirled about him shouting to each other. Another train pulled out and a voice over a Tannoy system was calling out platform numbers and destinations. It was a while before Tom could orientate himself enough to hand his ticket in. He must have looked a strange sight, with his thick white hair and weather-beaten face, clad in an old cord cap, overcoat and country boots with Sammy barking nervously at his ankles. Peering through the hordes of young men he finally spotted the ticket man. He slung the haversack that he had borrowed on to his back. It was filled with clothes and food for William, from people in the village."|"Good Night, Mr. Tom"|"Michelle Magorian"
00:00|midnight|"By the time Tom had changed buses and been directed and misdirected it was midnight before he reached the area where Willie lived. Accustomed now to the darkness, he could make out only too clearly the awful living conditions. Small dilapidated tenements stood huddled together, all in desperate need of care and attention. So this was William’s background, he thought."|"Good Night, Mr. Tom"|"Michelle Magorian"
04:00|"four o’clock in the morning"|"By four o’clock in the morning Will had soaked every sheet in the cottage and was now reduced to wearing yet another of Tom’s shirts. He grew increasingly hotter until, at one point, Tom was sorely tempted to run over to the Littles to fetch the Doctor. He quickly dismissed the idea. He didn’t dare leave in case Will should wake from one of his nightmares during his absence."|"Good Night, Mr. Tom"|"Michelle Magorian"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"Mrs Clarence didn’t understand the relationship of the two boys to Tom. It was obvious to her that he and the fair one were related but the dark precocious one didn’t look like either of them. She also wondered if Will was Tom’s son or grandson. When she discovered that he was a widower it unnerved her a little. She thought him a very attractive man and to her dismay found herself talking and chattering like an adolescent schoolgirl. It was really quite embarrassing. They had just finished listening to the eight o’clock news bulletin when she put down her knitting."|"Good Night, Mr. Tom"|"Michelle Magorian"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"During their stay, the news bulletins on the wireless had begun to grow ominous, so much so that one evening a worried Zach sneaked out of bed to listen to the eight o’clock news. Besides his mother being an ambulance driver his father was also with the Auxiliary Fire Service."|"Good Night, Mr. Tom"|"Michelle Magorian"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"‘I shall put that on my wall,’ said Will half to himself and half to Tom.
At eight o’clock they listened intently to the news on the wireless.
It was reported that flares had been dropped all over London and hundreds of German planes had been spotted. Spitfires and Hurricanes had soared up into the skies to fight them. It was one of the longest massed raids that London was experiencing. While the news was being read, heavy bombing was still continuing."|"Good Night, Mr. Tom"|"Michelle Magorian"
10:00|"10.00 a.m."|"At 10.00 a.m. the villagers were shocked by a Special News Bulletin on the wireless."|"Good Night, Mr. Tom"|"Michelle Magorian"
