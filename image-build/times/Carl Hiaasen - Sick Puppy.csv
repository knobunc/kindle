“Four times,” Desie said. “Starting at seven-thirty.”

03:00|"3:00 a.m."|"With the exception of the previous night, when he’d gone to a Republican fund-raiser and gotten so plastered that a cab had to carry him home. The time was 3:00 a.m., an hour at which Stoat could barely identify his own house, much less fit the new key in the door; typing a nonsequential five-digit code on the alarm panel required infinitely too much dexterity."|"Sick Puppy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"> 12:00"|"past noon"|"Stoat slept past noon and woke up to a grim hangover and a silent house. Spears of sunlight slanted harshly through the Bahamas shutters. Stoat buried his face in a pillow and thought again of the voluble prostitute at Swain’s. To meet someone with genuine political ideals was a rarity in Stoat’s line of work; as a lobbyist he had long ago concluded there was no difference in how Democrats and Republicans conducted the business of government. The game stayed the same: It was always about favors and friends, and who controlled the dough. Party labels were merely a way to keep track of the teams; issues were mostly smoke and vaudeville. Nobody believed in anything except hanging on to power, whatever it took. So, at election time, Palmer Stoat always advised his clients to hedge generously by donating large sums to all sides. The strategy was as immensely pragmatic as it was cynical. Stoat himself was registered independent, but he hadn’t stepped inside a voting booth in fourteen years. He couldn’t take the concept seriously; he knew too much."|"Sick Puppy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
00:00|midnight|"They were parked in palmetto scrub off a dirt road near Zolfo Springs when Vecker Darby came into their lives. It was close to midnight. Presumably, Desirata Stoat was home in Fort Lauderdale with her worthless dickhead of a husband, and Twilly found himself thinking about her. He was sitting in the rental car with an empty pizza box on his lap. McGuinn already had downed supper, four heaping cups of premium dry dog food; Desie had strictly instructed Twilly on which brand to purchase. Vet’s orders, she’d said. Typically, McGuinn wolfed the whole pile in about fourteen seconds. Afterward Twilly would sneak out the antibiotic pills, each concealed in a square-folded slice of rare roast beef, which McGuinn eagerly inhaled."|"Sick Puppy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"> 01:00"|"Shortly after one in the morning"|"Shortly after one in the morning, Desie tapped on the face of her wristwatch to show Dido it was time to leave. He took her home, walked her to the doorstep and kissed her tenderly on the crown of her head, the only part of her body that he could reach with his lips, without dropping to one knee. Then he placed his enormous slender hands on her shoulders and began speaking in a hushed, ardent tone. Desie, who was exhausted, nodded and smiled warmly and murmured all-purpose responses like “That’s so sweet,” or “I know what you mean.” But in fact she hadn’t a clue what Dido meant, for the next morning a large diamond engagement ring was delivered to her door. It arrived with a note; two notes actually—Dido’s original, scribbled in pencil on notepaper bearing the Reebok logo, and the laborious translation, which said: “I am so very happy you are to be my wife. Our life together will be full of many funs and pleasures. Thank you plenty for saying yes. Your truest love, Gorbak.”"|"Sick Puppy"|"Carl Hiaasen"

00:00|midnight|"After she was gone, Stoat briefly set out to make a hunting dog of his blood-champion Lab. Boodle proved excellent at fetching but not so good at retrieving. He could find a downed mallard in the thickest cattails but invariably he kept swimming. By the time Stoat and his hunting companions chased down the dog, there was too little remaining of the bedraggled game bird to cook. Stoat went through half a dozen Labrador trainers before giving up on Boodle; the retrieval talents for which his canine lineage was famous obviously had skipped a generation. Stoat consigned the dog to household-protection duties, for which he seemed well suited, given his daunting size and midnight blackness."|"Sick Puppy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 11:30"|"half past eleven"|"Palmer’s flight from Tallahassee was late, so he didn’t arrive home until half past eleven, after Desie was in bed. She heard him go into the den, where she’d left the package; heard him open the top drawer of his desk, where he kept the gold-plated scissors. For several moments she heard nothing else, and then came a quavering bleat that didn’t sound anything like her husband, though it was."|"Sick Puppy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
12:00|noon|"Desie returned the dog ear to the freezer—placing it out of sight, behind a half-gallon of rum raisin ice cream—and went to draw a hot bath. At noon the maid knocked on the door and said a “Mister Ezra Pound” was on the telephone. Desie asked the maid to hand her the portable."|"Sick Puppy"|"Carl Hiaasen"

22:30|"ten-thirty at night"|"“I want him dead.” Stoat said the words aloud, to hear how severe it sounded. Truly he did want the man killed . . . whacked, snuffed, offed, done, whatever guys like Mr. Gash called it. The man deserved to die, this young smart-ass, for interfering with the $28 million bridge deal that Palmer Stoat had so skillfully orchestrated; for abducting good-natured Boodle; for using severed dog parts as a lever of extortion; for mucking up Palmer Stoat’s marriage . . . how, Stoat wasn’t sure. But ever since she’d encountered the dognapper, Desie had been acting oddly. Case in point: Here it was ten-thirty at night and she wasn’t home. Mrs. Palmer Stoat, not home!"|"Sick Puppy"|"Carl Hiaasen"

“Well, you need to know.” The trooper waved. “Ten o’clock sharp?”

She didn’t know Dick Artemus had stayed up until 4:00 a.m. one night, grubbing through the documents and clippings until he seized with excitement upon the tragic story of Doyle Tyree, the ex-governor’s brother. Nor did Lisa June Peterson know about the unsigned communiqué given by her boss to the black state trooper, or the icy nature of her boss’s threat."|"Sick Puppy"|"Carl Hiaasen"

And when the surveyors showed up at the construction trailer at 7:00 a.m. sharp (a minor miracle in itself!), Krimmler could not bring himself to send them away, just because some shithead politicians were monkeying around with the bridge deal. Because the bridge was absolutely crucial to the project; without it, Shearwater Island would forever remain Toad Island. It had been hairy enough (and plenty expensive!) hauling the earth-moving equipment, one piece at a time, across the old wooden span. A fully loaded cement truck would never make it, and without cement you’ve got no goddamned seaside resort. Without cement you’ve got jack."|"Sick Puppy"|"Carl Hiaasen"

00:00|midnight|"To avoid the unappetizing prospect of competitive bidding, Lester/Lestorino had procured the lobbying services of Palmer Stoat, whose sway with Miami-Dade commissioners was well known. Once he had identified the necessary loophole and lined up the requisite voting majority, all that remained for Stoat was to make sure the fried-banana contract was placed far down on the agenda, so that the “debate” would be held no sooner than midnight. The strategy was to minimize public input by minimizing public attendance. A sparse crowd meant sparse opposition, reducing the likelihood that some skittish commissioner might get cold feet and screw up the whole thing."|"Sick Puppy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 02:30"|"half-past two"|"The plane landed at half-past two. Stoat searched for Desie inside the terminal but she wasn’t there. One of his cell phones rang—Stoat carried three—and he snatched it from a pocket. Durgess was on the line: No luck so far with the rhino, but good news about Robert Clapley’s cheetah! They’d found one in Hamburg, of all places, at a children’s zoo. The cat would arrive within days at the Wilderness Veldt Plantation, where it would be caged, washed and fattened up in advance of the big hunt. Anytime you’re ready! said Durgess, more perky than Stoat had ever heard him. I’ll inform Mr. Clapley, Stoat said, and get back to you."|"Sick Puppy"|"Carl Hiaasen"
