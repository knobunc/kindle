19:00|"seven o’clock that evening"|"By seven o’clock that evening, Trish’s mood has unaccountably transformed. Or maybe not so unaccountably. I arrive downstairs in the hall to see her wandering out of the living room with a cocktail glass, bloodshot eyes, and a high color."|"The Undomestic Goddess"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"“So I’ll see you tomorrow?”
“I’ll be at your mum’s at ten o’clock.”
He holds out his hand and we barely brush fingertips before he turns and walks away. I watch him disappear into the darkness, then turn and head down the drive to the house, my whole body still pulsating."|"The Undomestic Goddess"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"I’m woken the next day by Trish banging sharply on my door. “Samantha! I need to speak to you! Now!”
It’s not even eight o’clock on a Saturday morning. Where’s the fire?
“OK! Hang on a sec!” I call blearily."|"The Undomestic Goddess"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap ~ 09:00"|"around nine"|"I stumble downstairs in my robe at around nine, to find Eddie and Trish in the hall, dressed up very smartly. Eddie is in a blue blazer with shiny gold buttons, and Trish is in a white slub silk suit, with the biggest corsage of fake red roses I’ve ever seen. She also seems to be having the teeniest problem doing up the buttons of her jacket. At last she edges the last one into its buttonhole and stands back to look at herself in the mirror, panting slightly."|"The Undomestic Goddess"|"Sophie Kinsella"
20:00|"eight o’clock this evening"|"So… it’s just Nathaniel and me. Alone together. Until eight o’clock this evening. That’s the basic scenario."|"The Undomestic Goddess"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 05:40"|five-forty|"It’s five-forty now. The party’s at six. By about ten past, the eleventh floor should be clearing.Arnold is a very popular partner; no one’s going to miss his farewell speech if they can help it. Plus, at Carter Spink parties, the speeches always happen early on, so people can get back to work if they need to."|"The Undomestic Goddess"|"Sophie Kinsella"

"ap 05:50"|"ten to six"|"At ten to six we all gather in one of the kitchens and receive our orders. Hot canapes…"|"The Undomestic Goddess"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"It takes me until six o’clock. The lunch is over and I’ve cleared the table. Trish’s guests have wandered round the garden and had cups of tea and melted away. As I walk out into the soft, balmy evening, Nathaniel and Trish are standing by the pond, with a plastic tank by Nathaniel’s feet."|"The Undomestic Goddess"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"I spent the night at Nathaniel’s. We cooked mushroom omelets together and watched the end of an old war movie and had slow, tender sex. We didn’t talk any more about my going. But at three o’clock, when I looked over at him, he was awake too, staring up at the ceiling."|"The Undomestic Goddess"|"Sophie Kinsella"
"ap 00:00"|"twelve o’clock"|"By twelve o’clock I’m wearing a black suit, black tights, black high heels, and the crispest white shirt I’ve ever seen. I’ve been professionally made up and my hair has been scraped back into a bun."|"The Undomestic Goddess"|"Sophie Kinsella"
