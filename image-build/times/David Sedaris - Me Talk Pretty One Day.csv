         suggested that she might first want to change into something more appropriate. The woman was wearing what people in the South
         refer to as “hog washers,” the sort of denim overalls favored by farmers. The crowd at the Plaza would most likely be dressed

         question pertaining to sports or opera. Since moving to France my hobby has gotten considerably more expensive. The time difference
         isn’t winning me any friends, either. “Jesus Christ,” my father will say. “It’s four o’clock in the morning. Who cares who
         won the ’sixty-four U.S. Open?” The overseas calls were killing me, so I invested in an atlas and a shelfful of almanacs and
         reference books. I don’t always find what I’m looking for, but in searching for an answer, I’ll often come across bits of
         information I can use in some later puzzle. The Indian emperors of the Kanva dynasty, Ted Bundy’s assumed name, the winners
         of the 1974 Tony Awards: these things are bound to come in handy eventually."|"Me Talk Pretty One Day"|"David Sedaris"

         These are the mom-and-pop theaters, willing to proceed with the two o’clock showing of The Honeymoon Killers even if I’m the only one in the house. It’s as if someone had outfitted his den with a big screen and comfortable chairs.
         The woman at the box office sells you a ticket, rips it in half, and hands you the stub. Inside the theater you’re warmly
         greeted by a hostess who examines your stub and tears it just enough to make her presence felt. Somewhere along the line someone
         decided that this activity is worthy of a tip, so you give the woman some change, though I’ve never known why. It’s a mystery,

         rush” or claim to feel the immediate effect of a vitamin tablet. I’m not terribly in touch with my body but have noticed that,
         taken in great quantities, tea is actually pretty serious. Drink twelve cups at about eleven P.M., and you’ll really notice the difference between going to bed and going to sleep. Even if you’re lucky enough to lose consciousness,

"ap 09:30"|nine-thirty|"Sadly, my soap will not work on everyone. If you’ve had a lot of cosmetic surgery in the past — your eyes lifted, your wrinkles
         pumped with collagen — your youthful self will appear freakish and catlike, like one of those aliens rumored to have visited
         the town of Roswell, New Mexico. For reasons that confound medical science, the product also fails to affect those working
         in certain professions — the editors of fashion magazines, for example. Here are people who have spent their lives promoting
         youthful beauty, making everyone over the age of thirty feel like an open sore. Now, too late, they’ll attempt to promote
         liver spots as the season’s most sophisticated accessory. “Old is the new young,” they’ll say, but nobody will listen to them.
         Television executives will also be left out, especially those whose job it is to move a program from Sunday at eight to Wednesday
         at nine-thirty, then back to Sunday and on to Thursday, all so they can sell a few more soft-drink or taco commercials. When
         petitioned by these people to please, for the love of God, come up with something that can help them, I’ll redesign that goofy
         plastic bird that perpetually lowers its head into a little cup of water. My version will work just like the old one but —

         talking about pen-and-ink portraits and couldn’t understand my desire to drag a heavy cash register through the forest. I
         hadn’t actually done it, but it sounded like a good idea to me. These people were all stuck in the past, setting up their
         booths at the art fair and thinking themselves successful because they’d sold a silk screen of a footprint in the sand. It
         was sad in a way. Here they were, struggling to make art, while without the least bit of effort, I was living art. My socks
         balled up on the hardwood floor made a greater statement than any of their hokey claptrap with the carefully matted frames
         and big curly signatures in the lower left-hand corners. Didn’t they read any of the magazines? The new breed of artist wanted
         nothing to do with my sister’s idea of beauty. Here were people who made a living pitching tents or lying in a fetal position
         before our national monuments. One fellow had made a name for himself by allowing a friend to shoot him in the shoulder. This
         was the art world I’d been dreaming of, where God-given talent was considered an unfair advantage and a cold-blooded stare
         merited more praise than the ability to render human flesh. Everything around me was art, from the stains in my bathtub to
         the razor blade and short length of drinking straw I used to cut and ingest my speed. I was back in the world with a clear
         head and a keen vision of just how talented I really was."|"Me Talk Pretty One Day"|"David Sedaris"

         entry using an ink I’d made from the crushed bodies of ticks and mosquitoes.
