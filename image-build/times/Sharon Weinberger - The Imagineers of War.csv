He was clutching a rather large suitcase in one hand and a briefcase in the other and smiled warmly when Gale, the defense secretary’s special assistant, opened the front door. After confirming Gale’s identity, the stranger was ebullient. “Let me dismiss my cab,” he announced."|"The Imagineers of War"|"Sharon Weinberger"
02:20|"2:20 a.m."|"On August 25 and 26, practice rockets were launched from the Norton Sound, under the code name Pogo, as a dress rehearsal for the real shot. Finally, at 2:20 a.m. on August 27, amid rough seas, the ship launched the first missile as other ships and circling aircraft stood by to capture the event and record the effects of the blast. Those aboard ship assigned to monitor the missile stared at the night sky wearing high-density goggles meant to protect them in case of early detonation. On the observation aircraft, one pilot was instructed to keep the protective goggles on for a full sixty seconds, to make sure that in the worst-case scenario, an unimpaired pilot could control the aircraft. After the X-17A launched, everyone watched and waited."|"The Imagineers of War"|"Sharon Weinberger"
02:00|"two o’clock in the morning"|"Godel decided that beaming the president’s voice—that is, transmitting the new message over an open radio frequency to replace the recorded message inside the capsule—was less risky than physically removing the entire payload. “So, hoping that no radios would be on at two o’clock in the morning, the President’s voice went on the air, and erased that of the hapless Secretary Brucker,” Godel recalled. Now the only thing left was to launch the recording before anyone could figure out the missile was heading to space."|"The Imagineers of War"|"Sharon Weinberger"
18:02|"6:02 p.m."|"As Roy Johnson sat in the VIP bunker to monitor the launch, Godel stood in front of the launch control monitor. If anything went wrong, it was up to him to give the order to destroy the missile, which would obliterate months of work—not to mention his and Johnson’s reputations. At 6:02 p.m., the missile launched, and then everyone waited and watched. Suddenly the missile veered off course. Yet the members of Club 88, keeping up the charade to the end, did nothing. When the range safety officer saw that the missile was not heading into the ocean, he reached over to push the destruct button and had to be restrained. Godel recalled those first 180 seconds, during which the missile hurtled skyward on its path out of earth’s atmosphere, as “the longest of his life.”"|"The Imagineers of War"|"Sharon Weinberger"

The launch was a success, and two hours later ARPA held a celebratory press conference. The next day, however, ARPA announced that plans to recover the capsule had gone awry. The plan was for the capsule to be ejected at a precise time and place so that it would eventually land over Hawaii, where it would be picked up by the air force, but the ground controllers “goofed” and sent the signal at the wrong time. While the worst-case scenario was that the capsule would land in the middle of the Soviet Union, the second worst-case scenario took place. It landed somewhere in the vicinity of Norway’s Spitsbergen Islands inside the Arctic Circle, not far from the Soviet Union. Making matters worse, the island was home to Russian mining villages permitted by a treaty signed in 1920."|"The Imagineers of War"|"Sharon Weinberger"
02:00|"2:00 a.m."|"Wilson and his colleagues at Fort Bragg spent one furtive evening brainstorming, trying to come up with a name. “Counterguerrilla warfare” was the term that had been used up to that point, but Wilson did not feel the term captured what he had in mind. Nor did “counter-resistance,” because American forces had often worked with “the resistance,” particularly during World War II. The communists had already appropriated the term counterrevolutionary. Finally, at 2:00 a.m., Wilson approached the blackboard and scribbled, “Counterinsurgency.” One of the men in the room declared, “That’s it, let’s go home.”"|"The Imagineers of War"|"Sharon Weinberger"
19:53|1953|"“My son! My son! Bless the lord,” shouted Bessie Dickenson, standing on the ramp of Andrews Air Force Base, in Maryland, as the child she had not seen in more than three years got off the plane. It was 1953, and their reunion was short-lived; twenty-three-year-old Edward Dickenson, sometimes described as a “mountain boy” by the press, would soon be court-martialed for cooperating with the enemy. Dickenson was one of almost two dozen POWs from the Korean War who initially opted to stay in North Korea, throwing in his lot with the communists. Dickenson soon changed his mind and returned to the United States, where he was initially welcomed, then called a traitor. At his court-martial, defense lawyers argued that the young man, who hailed from the almost fictional-sounding Cracker’s Neck, Virginia, was a simple country boy who had been “brainwashed” by the communists during his years in captivity. Unmoved, a panel of eight officers convicted him, and he was sentenced to ten years in prison."|"The Imagineers of War"|"Sharon Weinberger"
"ap 01:00"|1|"Baran, however, was thinking about practical solutions to nuclear war. And in 1960, the same year that Licklider published his landmark paper “Man-Computer Symbiosis,” Baran was working with colleagues at Rand on simulations to test the resiliency of the communications system in case of nuclear attack. “We built a network like a fishnet, with different degrees of redundancy,” he recalled in an interview with Wired magazine. “A net with the minimum number of wires to connect all the nodes together, we called 1. If it was crisscrossed with twice as many wires, that was redundancy level 2. Then 3 and 4. Then we threw an attack against it, a random attack.”"|"The Imagineers of War"|"Sharon Weinberger"

Wylie was found guilty of embezzlement and fraud. Godel was acquitted of embezzlement but found guilty of making false statements and conspiring with Wylie. For Godel’s family and friends, it made no sense that the jury would clear him of stealing money and yet find him guilty of working with Wylie, a man Godel could barely tolerate.

"ap 05:00"|five|"It was all a lie. The Moscow Viral Study, as it was called, was the cover story for the American government’s top secret investigation into the effects of microwave radiation on humans. The Soviets, it turned out, were bombarding the embassy in Moscow with low-level microwaves. The “Moscow Signal,” as officials in Washington called the radiation, was too low to do any obvious harm to the people in the building. At five microwatts per square centimeter, the signal was well below the threshold needed to heat things, as a microwave oven does. Yet it was also a hundred times more powerful than the Soviets’ maximum exposure standards, which were much more stringent than those of the United States. That was cause for alarm."|"The Imagineers of War"|"Sharon Weinberger"

The rocket that launched the Apollo mission was the Saturn V, a descendant of the Saturn rocket that ARPA’s first director had fought for over “dying and bleeding bodies,” as William Godel had put it. The rocket that led to man’s first steps on the moon was credited to Wernher von Braun and his team of rocket scientists at NASA. The critical contribution that ARPA made to that mission had been long forgotten. By the time NASA reached the moon, ARPA was stuck in Vietnam."|"The Imagineers of War"|"Sharon Weinberger"

That was the entire content of the first transmission sent across the ARPANET. Charley Kline, a student programmer working for Professor Leonard Kleinrock at the University of California, Los Angeles, sent the message to Bill Duvall, a computer programmer at the Stanford Research Institute, and it was supposed to be “login,” but the system crashed before it could be transmitted in its entirety, sending just the first two letters."|"The Imagineers of War"|"Sharon Weinberger"
06:50|"650 hours"|"As it turns out, Karem and Williams, both known for single-minded pursuits, meshed well. Karem was a rogue aircraft designer whose vision left little room for tact. “Gentlemen, everything I see in this room is nonsensical,” he said at a meeting with a large defense firm. Williams was an engineer turned government bureaucrat with money to spend and whose love of visionaries could sometimes cloud his better judgment. As an initial step, Williams funded flight tests of the Albatross, a two-hundred-pound drone that Karem built in his garage. It flew an astounding fifty-six hours. When that design proved successful, DARPA then paid Karem to build Amber, an unmanned aircraft funded under the Teal Rain program. While Amber, which eventually flew 650 hours without a single crash, was ostensibly run in partnership with the navy, the real interest, according to Atkins, was from the CIA. “The navy was in it primarily for cover,” he said."|"The Imagineers of War"|"Sharon Weinberger"

The study was to design the smallest plane possible that could reach polar orbit and then return to earth. The magic number was a fifty-thousand-pound plane with a twenty-five-hundred-pound payload, and that was the design that duPont submitted.

Some senior intelligence officials who attended demonstrations at the “laboratory” appeared to embrace what Poindexter was trying to show, but others not as much. Poindexter described one demonstration, held for the chairman of the National Intelligence Council, who nodded off partway through the hour-long visit. “When it was over, this chairman said, ‘Well, John, this is very interesting, but we don’t really have time to do all those things.

20:04|2004|"While Tether was pushing the frontier of robotics with the Grand Challenge, DARPA-supported scientists were seeing the flip side of science fiction fandom. Tether was a disciple of George Heilmeier’s and his “catechism”—the seven questions the then director used to evaluate whether to start a program—to the point that chocolate bars with wrappers imprinted with the catechism were distributed at DARPATech. Like Heilmeier, Tether wanted breakthroughs, and he wanted those breakthroughs on a schedule, which he called go/no-go points. Programs that could not reach specific goals on schedule, such as six months or a year, were swiftly ended. University researchers accustomed to long-term funding took a hit. The New York Times reported in 2005 that DARPA had slashed its computer science funding for academics; by 2004, it had dropped to $123 million, down from $214 million in 2001. Tether defended the cuts, saying that he had not seen any fresh ideas from computer science departments. “The message of the complaints seems to be that the computer science community did good work in the past and, therefore, is entitled to be funded at the levels to which it has become accustomed,” Tether shot back, when faced with criticism."|"The Imagineers of War"|"Sharon Weinberger"
12:00|noonday|"The truck was equipped with television cameras, whose pictures were analyzed by the onboard computers to create what is known as “computer vision,” the term for how computers process and analyze images. The human brain does this well, letting someone know, for example, the difference between a tree and the shadow of a tree. The smart truck did this badly, so researchers found it was best to test it in the noonday sun, when there were no shadows. When Carnegie Mellon researchers took the truck out for a spin in Pittsburgh’s Schenley Park, they had to use masking tape to denote borders, because the truck’s computer vision would confuse inanimate objects, like a tree trunk, for the edge of the pavement. If robots were really going to take to the road, computer vision had to be improved well beyond the smart truck."|"The Imagineers of War"|"Sharon Weinberger"
