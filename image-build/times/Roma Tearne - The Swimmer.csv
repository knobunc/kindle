"< 00:00"|"Towards midnight"|"Towards midnight on that evening I woke with a start to the crackle and dance of white static on the television screen. I think I must have fallen asleep with my fingers wrapped around the remote control. It was stiflingly hot, unusual for East Anglia. I remember I wiped small beads of perspiration from my face with the back of my hand, thinking how unlike Britain this was, to feel so hot. I must have been disorientated, confused rather than frightened. No, I wasn’t frightened at all on this perfectly ordinary summer night. Car headlights swept up and down the length of the garden like giant eyelids lighting up parts of the river, dipping into wetland mud before vanishing. The summer renters from Italy had returned after an evening out. I heard them slamming doors in a reckless way, laughing, happy."|"The Swimmer"|"Roma Tearne"
00:00|midnight|"The tug of the water being pushed aside grew louder. It wasn’t an animal; there was too much control, too many regular pauses, as if something, or someone, was taking their time. The moon came out from behind a cigarette-paper cloud and I caught a glimpse of the row of wooden fence-posts rising up like the river’s rotten teeth, and then some spray as an arm rose and fell and turned again in the water. My first thought was that I ought to warn whoever it was that this inlet was dirty and had been stagnant for a long time. Swimming in it would only churn the mud up. My second was that the door into the house was not locked. Whoever was down there could easily come in. I was alone, of course. Earlier that evening Miranda, my sister-in-law, had rung to say they were leaving London the following morning for their annual visit. In the morning, too, the cleaner would arrive, but now, at midnight, I was alone. With the darkness and the soft paddling of human limbs in the water below."|"The Swimmer"|"Roma Tearne"
"ap < 10:00"|"almost ten"|"As if it was my fault. I know she stole money, too, but I had no way of proving it. Since it wasn’t possible to get another cleaner to come this far out of town, I continued to keep her on, but I didn’t leave anything of value lying around. I was on the point of looking in her bag for the missing fruit when she walked back into the kitchen and glared at me. Sighing, I picked up the paper and went into the dining room. Jack, Miranda and their children would have left London by now. I could hear Sarah going back upstairs to put clean sheets on all the beds. Then she would wash the kitchen floor and then, thank goodness, she would leave. It was almost ten. I sipped my tea and suddenly, without any warning, I remembered the swimmer. My God! How could I have forgotten him?"|"The Swimmer"|"Roma Tearne"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"It was eleven by now. Jack would be here by four. The house smelt of the eucalyptus polish that Sarah insisted on using. Sunlight poured in through the kitchen window. Relieved to be rid of her, I went upstairs."|"The Swimmer"|"Roma Tearne"
"ap 03:00"|three|"The afternoon moved slowly on. Guiltily, I wanted their car to break down, or the children to fall ill. I resisted an urge to drive out towards the fens and not return, to walk with the wind in my face and the reeds rustling beside the water’s edge. But the soup was almost ready and I had a loaf of bread in the oven. At three I glanced at my watch; they would be here in three-quarters of an hour. Going back out into the garden I cut handfuls of flowers; roses and some tendrils of honeysuckle. Then I filled a vase and went into the sitting room. It was a room I rarely used, except when I had visitors. Because of this the door was nearly always closed and as I approached from the kitchen with my huge jug of flowers, I registered, though with no special significance, that it was now ajar. I placed the jug on the top of the small Bechstein piano I had inherited. As I did so, a piece of sheet music drifted to the floor. I picked it up, stuffing it back into the seat of the piano stool. Then I plumped up the cushions and hurried out, for a car had driven up towards the front door. Jack, Miranda and the children had arrived early."|"The Swimmer"|"Roma Tearne"

"< 00:00"|"Towards midnight"|"My study was a tip. Somehow they had managed to knock over a glass and scatter the cushions. There were books on the floor and paper from the printer was everywhere. My good intentions evaporated completely. Furious, I closed the door. Then I cleared the mess and turned the television off. I no longer felt like working, but I didn’t feel like going to bed either. Upstairs, on the third floor, in the room above my study, the children made thumping sounds as though they were fighting. Taking up the book I had been reading I settled down on the sofa. The poem that had peeped out had taken fright and vanished. I could hear Miranda’s voice followed by Sophie screaming. Then Jack joined in and there was a stampede towards the guest bathroom. Miranda began calling me. Oh God! I thought guiltily. I sat pretending not to hear, feeling trapped. To think I had ever wanted children! Towards midnight things quietened down. The floorboards stopped creaking, the house was settling at last. I sighed and switched off the light. Was it safe to go to my bedroom?"|"The Swimmer"|"Roma Tearne"
00:00|midnight|"TUESDAY, AUGUST 23RD. ON THE MORNING that Jack and Miranda left for the Broads I awoke to them having breakfast noisily in the garden. I was exhausted. They had now been here for three days. Last night I had again waited up until midnight hoping to catch sight of the swimmer, but the garden had remained undisturbed. Then, just as I dozed off, the outside light came on and woke me. It was him! But by the time I crept downstairs he had vanished. There were damp marks on the kitchen floor."|"The Swimmer"|"Roma Tearne"
"ap 06:00"|six|"In all, my swimmer had appeared three times. Last night the images of him had played themselves over and over again. His visits were a puzzle, I was becoming mildly obsessed by them. Perhaps, I thought, I ought to write a poem about the mysterious way in which he visited and then vanished. I yawned. I had meant to wake at six, begin working, but not having managed this all I wanted to do now was sit in the sun. Miranda was probably right and I needed a holiday. The coffee was lukewarm. Could it be, I frowned, returning to my earlier train of thought, that I had imagined some of it? The facts were few. At some point in the night the outside light had come on and the bread was missing. That was all. I had no proof the swimmer had taken it. I had no proof that he had come into the house, even. I glanced at Jack, but he was concentrating on the map spread out in front of him. My baby brother has a round, slightly chubby face. Curiously unlined. Empty, Eric always said. Like a man who could not comprehend what was lost. I yawned, again, distracted. Hmm, I thought, but had I actually seen the swimmer?"|"The Swimmer"|"Roma Tearne"
12:00|midday|"By midday the house was mine again. The silence settled slowly like dust on the sunlit surface of the furniture. I tidied the detritus of the last few days in a desultory, half-hearted way, and went out. Orford is much smaller than Aldeburgh, a village really, with one main street. In reality it is an island, surrounded by marshland and the estuary running into the sea. For the past two years the heavy rains have brought extensive flooding to the area and house prices were going into a decline. Those who could had begun to move away. Others, like me, who chose to live close to the river, kept a supply of sandbags at the ready for the next deluge. As Orford has no tourist attractions it seldom gets crowded even at the height of summer. The smart London visitors come for the festivals and are interested only in Aldeburgh. They hardly ever venture as far as us. Which suits the xenophobic residents of Orford perfectly."|"The Swimmer"|"Roma Tearne"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"It was one o’clock. I bought some apples and a small pork pie and drove across the bridge to the other side of the riverbank in the direction of Orford Ness. When I was a teenager I used to sit for hours staring at this shingle desert of military ruin. The horizon remains the same through one hundred and eighty degrees. I used to love its other-worldliness. From here it is possible to catch a glimpse of Eel House as a faint smudge in the distance. Over time, the National Trust volunteers had grown used to seeing me sitting on the edge of its desert-like landscape, lost in thought."|"The Swimmer"|"Roma Tearne"

Then I went into my study and worked with a solid concentration and an enormous sense of relief. For two years I had been working on a collection of poems. Working and re-working, trying to find the clear stanza that stands for a lorry-load of elaborate prose. The collection was about water and the way memory travels through it. I had wanted a high, pure sound, an elegiac note, of life poised between two states. My past and all it represented was what interested me most, but I had been stuck for months and the collection had got nowhere. This afternoon, as I rewrote some of the clumsier passages, a sense of calm began to break over me. I worked solidly for nearly three hours.

I had completely forgotten about my swimmer of course and my plan to catch him in the act of stealing. Once again it was after midnight when I woke. The Verdi had long finished. The garden was completely silent, there was no moon tonight as I opened the window and breathed in the scent of newly opened jasmine flowers. The river glinted now and then. The starless sky made it impossible to distinguish water from garden. Nothing moved, there was no sound. I felt a small nudge of disappointment as the church clock struck one. The house next door was closed. Either the renters were asleep or they were out again. Well, that was that, I thought ruefully, aware of some disappointment. It was a simple enough explanation. A passing youth had decided to cool off by swimming upstream and then had discovered the house. Perhaps he had been on his way back from the pub, perhaps someone had even dared him, so that, in a moment of bravado, he had wandered in and stolen a loaf of bread. As I was the subject of some curiosity in Orford, what could I expect? Lucky he didn’t take anything valuable, I thought, pulling a face. Better lock the back door. The bare skeleton of the poem still glowed inside me. At least the swimmer’s appearance had given me the kick-start I needed. Reaching for the catch, I was about to close the window when I froze in my tracks. Someone was playing the piano downstairs with the soft pedal down."|"The Swimmer"|"Roma Tearne"

"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"Looking back, that day proved to be one of the most productive of the summer. I finished the poem and later even managed to do a bit of weeding in my vegetable patch. The sun had given my tomatoes an intensity of flavour. I picked a few and some runner beans, too. I decided to grill the fish with dill and parsley. It was all planned. The basil-soaked olive oil, the fresh bread. The pudding was to be apricots, halved and stoned and tossed with slices of watermelon and late strawberries in a dressing of my own invention. I had a bottle of wine chilling in the fridge but then, remembering how my swimmer had drunk his beer so thirstily, I put the last of Jack’s cans to cool. I was excited. It was years since I had cooked for a man. At six o’clock the phone rang. It was Heather. I sighed. Heather is my only friend left in Orford. As a child, Heather hated her own mother. She used to want to be part of our family and our mother was very fond of her. Later, when everything went cold at home, Heather would still sometimes visit us. Occasionally she even used to cook for us, making cakes that she knew Mum and Jack liked, fussing over them and bringing presents from the farm. I remember after one such visit Mum saying Heather should have been her daughter. I think I stopped believing that Heather was my special friend after that."|"The Swimmer"|"Roma Tearne"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"All that long, hot afternoon I tried and failed to work. So much for the run of creativity, I thought, pouring myself more white wine. Once again someone was disturbing my hard-won peace. Restlessly I kept going over our last conversation. Then, as the afternoon turned into early evening I began to worry that something might have happened to him. The image of the migrant workers in the watercress field recurred and I wondered uneasily if I ought to go over to one of the farms near Unthank and make a few enquiries. I could of course have visited Eric, but Eric would know the instant he saw me the kind of mood I was in, and I didn’t want his questions. In any case, I had no clear idea on which farm Ben worked. At six o’clock I poured myself a very large gin, thinking grimly I was drinking far too much. It was the only comfort of the lonely."|"The Swimmer"|"Roma Tearne"

Was he one of those unreliable men, never doing quite what they promised, always leaving one short-changed?

"ap 07:00"|seven|"MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 5TH. BEN HAD THE day off and arrived at seven. The weather changed, subtly. A late burst of summer heat embalmed the air. Not surprisingly, Ben still had heard nothing about his application for refugee status. I had been nagging him for days to let me ring the Home Office, but he had turned lazy and wouldn’t co-operate. I had the distinct feeling he wanted to shelve everything that was unpleasant and that this oasis of calm was all he needed.

I had tried the number on and off for a couple of days and in the end had given up. The website, too, was out of date and difficult to use. I had tried downloading a form but only half of it printed and I could not get a reply to any e-mail I sent, either. So I had booked a ticket on the six forty-five train to Liverpool Street. Ben must have been up working for two hours already, helping with the milking. All night it had rained and I had lain awake, worrying about him.

I needed to find out what the position was at the Home Office before I could say anything to anyone, even Eric. Jack with his xenophobia would have to be handled carefully.

The water meadow will return to a pale sodden green and although the grass will remain still flattened from my last pilgrimage to that spot, winter will edge a few minutes closer to a lighter hour. Tomorrow, what has been lost will be restored, outwardly at least. Trains will pass swiftly in the distance. Crows will sit on telephone wires, sheep will huddle under bare-branched trees. But I will be gone, my plane lifting through the heavy skies, turning and banking over the bitter sea. Over the snow-capped Alps, across Turkey, over Damascus and the Arabian Sea; across India then down, down, flying beside the Indian Ocean, homing. That is how, in a very few hours, I will go towards my journey’s end. Returning to the place that betrayed me, leaving the dead where they do not belong.

I was to give it to her when he left. At midnight they both returned to stand in the doorway, silently. Looking up, I had the strangest sense of their completeness and their quiet togetherness. This moment was their best, I thought. They should have got married even though she was still a schoolgirl. Instead he was leaving. Who knew if she would stay faithful to him? But this moment I felt was perfect. Ben must have thought so too, because a moment later he fetched the bird-egg necklace and took it out to her on the verandah. The murmur of their voices was breaking my heart. Later they went into his little alcove and closed the curtain. There were just three hours left. I hoped they would get some sleep.

I had not thought of Tara all these weeks and now I thought of her. Tara was from another kind of life. I looked at my watch. It was seven in the morning. It would be midday at home. Tara would be at her father’s shop and if there had been no trouble in the night she would be standing behind the till, staring out at the sea. She would be watching the glittering water, and waiting. I got out of bed. The sun glinted on the snow."|"The Swimmer"|"Roma Tearne"

"ap 10:00"|"TEN O’CLOCK"|"TEN O’CLOCK. M11 EXIT. HEATHROW. IN the few days left to us, Ria withdrew completely. She had such an air of stunned and mistrustful defeat, of such private desolation, that I began to ask myself, had she had found out about Eric? I oscillated between fear that she might have found out and anger at her neglect of me. Didn’t she know how much I was suffering? In Sri Lankan society, I wanted to tell her, nothing is more sacred than the relationship a mother has with a son. Blessed are the women who have many sons, I wanted to say. Whoever seeks to reverse the order of things in Nature will be cursed, was another saying that hovered constantly on my tongue."|"The Swimmer"|"Roma Tearne"

"ap 10:20"|"TEN TWENTY"|"TEN TWENTY. NEARING HEATHROW. SO HERE I am, on this bus nearing the airport. The snow has melted; the fields have a blanket of soft grey light thrown on them. I cannot but marvel at how many shades of grey this country has. I will never pass this way again. Beside me, the Italian woman sits up, waking. I have been half talking to her, but she must have dozed off, uncomprehending. Who can blame her? Mine is a story that beggars belief. For the hundredth time, I think, although I am leaving, some part of me will remain. We are almost at the drop-off point and the passengers move restlessly. When he said his goodbye, Eric had held me while I cried. His lips on mine were warm and full of an aftermath of love. Yes, love. I can say the word without flinching, for it is true. We had shared a kind of loving that belongs to us alone. In spite of everything, it had been possible."|"The Swimmer"|"Roma Tearne"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"As long as I could remember, my mother used to see a lawyer about something. When I was very small I used to have to stay with Jack and Miranda while she went up to London to see a lawyer about something. Both my uncle and aunt disapproved of these trips, and when she returned Mum was always bad tempered. I had no idea what it was all about. There were so many other pressing things going on that ‘seeing a lawyer about something’ never grabbed my curiosity. Anyway, that morning, before I left for school, she warned me she might be late. It was fine by me. As I hardly ever had the house to myself I looked on her absence that afternoon as a treat. So I didn’t worry when there was no sign of her at three o’clock or at four. At five thirty Sarah rang to say they had stopped off at her gran’s for tea but hoped to be at her aunt’s house later that evening. I could hear from her voice that she was disappointed. We had planned a trip up to Eric’s farm and we were going to take the smaller boat out on the river. We never did, of course. We never went up that river together again."|"The Swimmer"|"Roma Tearne"

12:00|midday|"After reading Eric’s letter, I had written to her. Then, fearful that the letter would not get through, I got the name of the place where she worked. It took a while to trace her, but eventually I did. And then I rang her. It was late afternoon in Batticlore, barely midday here. I had not long woken up. To tell you the truth, there had been an end-of-exams party the night before and I was a bit hung over. I heard her voice for the first time with a backdrop of other sounds. I have never been to the tropics and somewhere faintly behind her voice I could hear the sound of a bird cawing."|"The Swimmer"|"Roma Tearne"
