12:00|midday|"Finally, shuddering with exhaustion, he wiped his eyes, turned on his side, and slept, though it was still 
midday. The sun was high in the sky over Village. Matty dreamed of vague, frightening things connected to pain, and his body was tense even as he slept. Then his dream changed. His muscles relaxed and he became serene in his sleep. He was dreaming now of healed wounds, new life, and calm."|Messenger|"Lois Lowry"
12:00|midday|"But his body felt hot and weak, as if he were ill. Matty wanted to suggest that they stop here and rest, that they spread the blanket and lie down for a while. But he had never rested at midday on previous journeys. And now they could not afford the time. They had to move forward, toward the stench. At least the vines were behind them now, and he didn't see any ahead."|Messenger|"Lois Lowry"
