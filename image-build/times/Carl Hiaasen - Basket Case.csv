16:30|"four-thirty in the afternoon"|"The question of the moment: Have Juan and Emma started a sexual relationship? If so, there’s a strong possibility that I’m about to interrupt an act of copulation, which is hardly ever a good idea. In Emma’s windows the blinds are open, but no movement is visible except for a bony calico cat, grooming itself on a sill. Apprehensively I check my wristwatch—at four-thirty in the afternoon, it’s more likely that Juan and Emma are screwing than watching Oprah."|"Basket Case"|"Carl Hiaasen"
00:00|Midnight|"10
Midnight.
The old days, a newsroom at this hour reeked of coffee and cigarettes and stale pizza. You’d hear the wire machines chittering and the police scanners gabbling and the pasteup guys snorting at dirty jokes."|"Basket Case"|"Carl Hiaasen"
12:00|noontime|"When noontime rolls around, I pretend to be stuck on the phone in order to duck Emma’s offer of a ride. I tell her to go on ahead and I’ll catch up, thinking I can use the extra time to plot strategy. But my thoughts remain jumbled and I set off with no plan."|"Basket Case"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"Carla Candilla gets a regular five o’clock break from the photo counter at the drugstore. We meet at a yogurt shop in the same strip mall. Heads turn at the sight of her Vesuvius-inspired dye job, or perhaps it’s my fat purple nose. In a low voice I describe the scene on Cleo Rio’s balcony. Carla begs in vain for more details, and is slightly disappointed that the object of the widow’s affections wasn’t Russell Crowe, Leonardo DiCaprio or one of the Backstreet Boys, none of whom matches my description of the coppery-haired felatee. Carla promises to snoop around the circuit and report all rumors. She says Cleo’s favorite local hangout is a club called Jizz; down on South Beach, it’s Tetra."|"Basket Case"|"Carl Hiaasen"
01:00|"one in the morning"|"It’s one in the morning and Radiohead is playing on Emma’s stereo, a neat surprise."|"Basket Case"|"Carl Hiaasen"
00:00|midnight|"“Who knows. My Chagalls?”
“Jack, I’m not the one knocking on doors at midnight.”
“Yes, well, you are my editor. I felt you should be notified of what happened.”"|"Basket Case"|"Carl Hiaasen"
03:00|"Three a.m."|"“It’s now Saturday morning.” She points at her watch.
“Three a.m. We can’t possibly do this now,” I insist.
“Why not?”"|"Basket Case"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 01:00"|one|"“I wasn’t there,” Loréal says pointedly, “but I heard she did.” Two more beers have been delivered, and he snatches at one."|"Basket Case"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 09:15"|Nine-fifteen|"18
Nine-fifteen on Sunday morning, Emma calls.
“Hi, there. You awake?”"|"Basket Case"|"Carl Hiaasen"
00:00|midnight|"“Yes, honey, for now. But it’ll start all over again, like always. The obsessing, the dreams, the midnight monologues. . . .”"|"Basket Case"|"Carl Hiaasen"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"I couldn’t sleep last night so I drove back to Beckerville in a rainstorm at two in the morning. Janet’s Miata was filling with water in the driveway and the house was exactly as Emma and I had left it. Incredible: The cops never showed up. I thought about calling 911 again, but decided to hold off."|"Basket Case"|"Carl Hiaasen"
02:30|"two-thirty in the morning"|"“Now we’re even,” I say. “What brings you out at two-thirty in the morning?”"|"Basket Case"|"Carl Hiaasen"
08:00|"eight in the morning"|"Emma and Juan are still asleep when my mother calls at eight in the morning. She says she was planning to drive up from Naples and visit me on my birthday."|"Basket Case"|"Carl Hiaasen"
12:00|noon|"I hope to learn much more when, at noon sharp the day after tomorrow, the phone should ring in a booth at the end of the Silver Beach fishing pier. Maybe it’ll be Cleo calling, maybe somebody in her posse."|"Basket Case"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"“Do you have a credit card?” she says. “Because I haven’t figured out how to get the paper to pay for this yet. But I will, don’t worry. I’m waiting to corner Abkazion between the five- and six o’clock news meetings.”"|"Basket Case"|"Carl Hiaasen"
22:30|"ten-thirty at night"|"By the time I got to L.A. it was ten-thirty at night. Most hospitals are penetrable at any hour, so I was surprised to be turned away by the late-shift lobby crew at Cedars-Sinai. My next stop was the emergency room, but heart-wrenching lies failed to thaw the glacial resolve of a senior trauma nurse who had thrust herself, as demurely as Mario Lemieux, in my path."|"Basket Case"|"Carl Hiaasen"
00:00|midnight|"From Cedars I head straight to LAX and catch a flight that should get me home by midnight. Hunkered like a parolee in a window seat, I snap on the Discman and painstakingly tick through the “Shipwrecked Heart” tracks until I locate what sounds like a fully mixed version. It’s pretty good, too. I understand why Cleo Rio wants to steal it for herself."|"Basket Case"|"Carl Hiaasen"
01:15|"one-fifteen in the morning"|"A disagreement over lane-changing etiquette has resulted in two motorists pulling semiautomatics and inconsiderately shooting each other in the diamond lane of the interstate. The traffic jam is epic, and by the time I reach my apartment in Silver Beach it’s one-fifteen in the morning. Emma is asleep behind the wheel of her new Camry in the parking lot. Quietly I wake her and lead her upstairs, where I prop her in a chair, place a cup of decaf in her hand and make her listen to “Shipwrecked Heart.”"|"Basket Case"|"Carl Hiaasen"
12:00|"high noon"|"The pier at Silver Beach is not a big draw at high noon on a hot August day. I arrive half an hour early and, from the safety of my car, I scope the place thoroughly with binoculars. Team Cleo has had two days to run the phone number I wrote on the compact disc, an easy job for any private investigator."|"Basket Case"|"Carl Hiaasen"
12:00|noon|"And naturally some old guy is tying up the damn phone. I check my watch—twelve minutes until noon. I hope Cleo doesn’t give up because the line rings busy once or twice."|"Basket Case"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 10:00"|"Ten o’clock"|"“Ten o’clock. Come alone.” Jerry doesn’t seem eager to get to know me over the phone."|"Basket Case"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 03:30"|three-thirty|"Out of the corner of my eye I spy the eavesdropping opossum man, loping nimbly away. From the end of the phone line comes a muffled rustling—Jerry, covering the receiver while he and Jimmy’s widow debate strategy. Then: “Okay. The girl, she’ll call you at three-thirty. Gimme a number.”"|"Basket Case"|"Carl Hiaasen"
12:00|noon|"No sign of Emma when I arrive at the newsroom, but young Evan is eagerly waiting. He crowds my desk, whispering, “Well? Did it work?”
“Like a charm. She called at noon sharp.”
“How cool is that! I guess she found the CD.”"|"Basket Case"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap < 03:30"|"toward three-thirty"|"Time crawls toward three-thirty. My eyes tick between the phone on my desk and the clock on the newsroom wall. Two o’clock. Two-twenty. Two forty-three."|"Basket Case"|"Carl Hiaasen"

"ap 03:15"|"Quarter past three"|"It’s pleasing to report that since Maggad-Feist acquired the Union-Register, circulation has declined commensurately with each swing of the budget ax. This trend suggests newspaper readers expect some genuine news along with their coupons and crosswords. Young Race Maggad will tolerate losing readers only as long as profits rise, which he achieves by the aforementioned paring of the budget, shrinking of the staff and cold-blooded gouging of local retailers. Eventually, however, Wall Street will take note of the sliding circulation numbers and react in a manner that could jeopardize young Race Maggad’s blond and breezy lifestyle. His trepidation over this prospect has leached into the management ranks of all the company’s newspapers, including ours. The result has been the urgent convening of even more newsroom meetings, one of which undoubtedly imprisons Emma at this moment.
Quarter past three on Thursday afternoon.
Phone rings. Eddie Bell from the Bellmark Funeral Home."|"Basket Case"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 04:00"|four|"“I was looking for Emma,” he says. “The diversity committee meets at four.”"|"Basket Case"|"Carl Hiaasen"

"ap 10:15"|"quarter past ten"|"I arrive at the club at quarter past ten. Cleo Rio suspects I’m wearing a wire so, in a scene worthy of a Derek Grenoble potboiler, Jerry leads me to the men’s room and roughly pats me down. Fortunately, I’ve left Lady Colt under the front seat of the Mustang."|"Basket Case"|"Carl Hiaasen"
02:00|"Two in the morning"|"Two in the morning, this isn’t the best place to be. If I stay much longer I’ll put a fist through the wall. Emma is gone and it’s my fault."|"Basket Case"|"Carl Hiaasen"
16:00|"four that afternoon"|"Seized with dread, I sat glued to my desk from four that afternoon until eleven at night. My bladder was the size of Arkansas by the time Walter Dubb finally called. He’d killed a buck and skinned it out and then the pickup broke down in the woods and then a bear showed up and made off with the deer meat before Walter could get his rifle out of the rack—this was the tale he laid upon Mrs. Dubb, anyway. Whatever really happened that evening had put Walter in a highly contented frame of mind, and that’s all that mattered to me. I whooped and danced all the way to the john."|"Basket Case"|"Carl Hiaasen"

"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"I messed around with the guitar until an hour before dawn. Then I packed what I thought I’d need, drove to the paper and promptly fell asleep on the floor by my desk. The janitors worked around me, and the phone didn’t ring. Now it’s nine o’clock and the staff trickles into the newsroom. Abkazion is one of the first to arrive. Somewhere between the elevator and his office door, he spies me and alters course as silkily as a hawk."|"Basket Case"|"Carl Hiaasen"
12:30|"Half past noon"|"“I’ll tell you what I remember, Jack. I remember it seemed easy at the time.” Then he squeezes my shoulder and says, “The bad stuff comes later.”
Half past noon, the phone finally rings again.
“Tagger?”"|"Basket Case"|"Carl Hiaasen"

“Of course.”"|"Basket Case"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 08:05"|"five past eight"|"Juan reports that the GPS still works splendidly and that the mishap has cost us only seven minutes, which can be made up with extra speed. Darkness is rolling in but the worst of the weather has passed. We take a northbound heading and set off again in a muggy drizzle. The time is five past eight. As the storm leaves the lake, clouds high to the east pulse with bright jagged veins of orange and blue. The bursts are so regular I can steer by the light. Thirty-one minutes later, Juan’s hand shoots from under the tarp and makes a slashing motion."|"Basket Case"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"ap 00:00"|"twelve o’clock"|"Delicately I slip the Lady Colt into my waistband, the challenge being not to shoot myself. I move forward to sit beside Emma, who is wobbly and shuddering. I wrap one arm around her and with the other I point the Q-beam at twelve o’clock, so that Juan is able to see where we’re heading. In his fist the GPS screen glows a cozy green, and the unanimous hope is that it will guide us back to Ernie Bo Tump’s marina."|"Basket Case"|"Carl Hiaasen"

"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"He rears back with the rod and arcs the fresh bait toward the water. The heavy lead sinker makes a faraway plop. Emma motions that it’s time for us to go. Now that she’s a deputy editor, she cannot miss the one o’clock meeting. Some things haven’t changed at the Union-Register."|"Basket Case"|"Carl Hiaasen"
