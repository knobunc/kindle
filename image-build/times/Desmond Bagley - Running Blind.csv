"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"At ten o’clock I rang for a taxi and left for the airport, a move which resulted in some action. I looked back along the street and saw a car draw up near the alley into which my watcher jumped. The car followed the taxi all the way to the airport, keeping a discreet distance."|"Running Blind"|"Desmond Bagley"
05:00|"Five a.m."|"‘What time is it?’
‘Five a.m.’
I smiled. ‘Gestapo technique, eh! Oh, well: I suppose I’ll feel better when I’ve shaved.’"|"Running Blind"|"Desmond Bagley"
12:00|midday|"‘As of this moment I couldn’t tell you.’ I dried my face vigorously. ‘It was taken from me at midday yesterday by four unknown males—but you know that already from Graham.’"|"Running Blind"|"Desmond Bagley"
"ap ~ 11:30"|"About eleven-thirty"|"She asked if I had slept well and I assured her I had, then I said, ‘When will you get here?’
‘About eleven-thirty.’
‘I’ll meet you at the camp site,’ I said."|"Running Blind"|"Desmond Bagley"
15:00|"three in the afternoon"|"At three in the afternoon I packed up and went home and was scrambling down Sgurr Mor when I saw the car parked outside the cottage and the minuscule figure of a man pacing up and down. The cottage is hard to get to—the rough track from the clachan discourages casual tourists—and so anyone who arrives usually wants to see me very much. The reverse doesn’t always apply; I’m of a retiring nature and I don’t encourage visitors."|"Running Blind"|"Desmond Bagley"
12:00|midday|"It was not bad during the first morning. The track was reasonable and not too bone-jolting and paralleled the Jökulsá á Fjöllum which ran grey-green with melt water to the Arctic Ocean. By midday we were opposite Mödrudalur which lay on the other side of the river, and Elin broke into that mournfully plaintive song which describes the plight of the Icelander in winter: ‘Short are the mornings in the mountains of Mödrudal. There it is mid-morning at daybreak.’ I suppose it fitted her mood; I know mine wasn’t very much better."|"Running Blind"|"Desmond Bagley"
15:00|"three in the afternoon"|"At three in the afternoon we stopped at the rescue hut under the rising bulk of the great shield volcano called Herdubreid or ‘Broad Shoulders’. We were both tired and hungry, and Elin said, ‘Can’t we stop here for the day?’"|"Running Blind"|"Desmond Bagley"
15:45|"3:45 p.m."|"‘Good enough. Ask Seydisfjördur to contact us when the call comes through.’ I looked at my watch. In an hour it would be 3:45 p.m. British Standard Time—a good hour to catch Taggart."|"Running Blind"|"Desmond Bagley"

"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"‘We’ll have to assume so,’ I said. ‘It could be a charter plane full of tourists looking at the Óbyggdir from the air, but it’s a bit early in the day for that—tourists aren’t awake much before nine o’clock.’"|"Running Blind"|"Desmond Bagley"
03:00|"three a.m."|"‘Yes,’ I said lazily. I was feeling much better myself. ‘But you’d better sleep. We make an early start tomorrow.’ I calculated it would be light enough to move at three a.m. when the rivers would also be at their lowest. I leaned over and took the binoculars."|"Running Blind"|"Desmond Bagley"
"ap > 09:00"|"after nine o’clock"|"I stayed there for a couple of hours, smoking and thinking and looking at the river, and at the end of that time I had come up with nothing new despite my brain beating. The added factor of the American helicopter was a piece of the jigsaw that wouldn’t fit anywhere. I looked at my watch and found it was after nine o’clock, so I buried all the cigarette stubs, picked up the carbine and prepared to go back."|"Running Blind"|"Desmond Bagley"
02:00|"two a.m."|"I dropped into my berth fully clothed. I didn’t expect to sleep under the circumstances but nevertheless I set the alarm on my wrist watch for two a.m. And that was the last thing I remember until it buzzed like a demented mosquito and woke me up."|"Running Blind"|"Desmond Bagley"
"ap 02:15"|two-fifteen|"II
We were ready to move at two-fifteen. As soon as the alarm buzzed I woke Elin, ruthlessly disregarding her sleepy protests. As soon as she knew how close Kennikin was she moved fast. I said, ‘Get dressed quickly. I’m going to have a look around.’"|"Running Blind"|"Desmond Bagley"
"ap 08:30"|eight-thirty|"In reaching the Sprengisandur track we had crossed the watershed and all the rivers from now on would be flowing south and west instead of north and east. We hit the track at eight-thirty, and I said, ‘Breakfast. Climb in the back and get something ready.’"|"Running Blind"|"Desmond Bagley"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"So we ate on the move and stopped only once, at ten o’clock, to fill up the tank from the last full jerrycan. While we were doing that up popped our friend of the previous day, the US Navy helicopter. It came from the north this time, not very low, and floated over us without appearing to pay us much attention."|"Running Blind"|"Desmond Bagley"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"At eleven o’clock the worst happened—a tyre blew. It was a front tyre and I fought the wheel as we jolted to a stop. ‘Let’s make this fast,’ I said, and grabbed the wheel brace."|"Running Blind"|"Desmond Bagley"

I left Laugarvatn at eight that night. Punctuality may be a virtue but it has been my experience that the virtuous often die young while the ungodly live to a ripe age.

Case looked at his watch. ‘Eleven-thirty.’
I put down the whisky untasted. ‘It’s late—I’d better be going.’"|"Running Blind"|"Desmond Bagley"

I got into Laugarvatn just before five in the morning and parked the car in the drive. As I got out I saw the curtains twitch and Elin ran out and into my arms before I got to the front door. ‘Alan!’ she said. ‘There’s blood on your face.’"|"Running Blind"|"Desmond Bagley"
12:00|midday|"Even so, after we passed Hella I had a belated attack of nerves and left the main road to join the network of bumpy tracks in Landeyjasandur, feeling that anyone who could find me in that maze would have to have extrasensory perception.
At midday Elin said decisively, ‘Coffee.’
‘What have you got? A magic wand?’"|"Running Blind"|"Desmond Bagley"
"ap 08:00"|"Eight o’clock"|"I sat up and nearly cracked my head on a beam. Overhead a jet plane whined and when I went aft into the open I saw that the shore was quite close and a plane was just dipping in to land. I stretched, and said, ‘What time is it?’
‘Eight o’clock,’ said Valtyýr. ‘You slept well.’
‘I needed it after a session with you,’ I said, and he grinned."|"Running Blind"|"Desmond Bagley"

Nordlinger’s Chevrolet was too long, too wide and too soft-sprung and I wouldn’t have given a thank you for it in the Óbyggdir, but it was just what I needed to get into Reykjavik fast along the International Highway which is the only good bit of paved road in Iceland. I did the twenty-five miles to Hafnarfjördur at 80 mph and cursed when I was slowed down by the heavy traffic building up around Kopavogur. I had an appointment at midday in the souvenir shop of the Nordri Travel Agency and I didn’t want to miss it."|"Running Blind"|"Desmond Bagley"
12:00|midday|"It was still before the midday rush so I got a seat at the window and ordered pancakes and coffee. I spread open the paper and then glanced through the window at the crowded street below and found that, as I had planned, I had a good view of the travel agency which was on the other side of the street. The thin gauze curtains didn’t obstruct my view but made it impossible for anyone to recognize me from the street."|"Running Blind"|"Desmond Bagley"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"He wouldn’t be alone on a job like this and so I was interested in his relationship with the passers-by. As the minutes ticked on he appeared to become increasingly restless and consulted his watch frequently and, at one o’clock exactly, he made a decisive move. He lifted his hand and beckoned, and another man came into my line of sight and crossed the street towards him."|"Running Blind"|"Desmond Bagley"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"From the bit of action with the watch it seemed that they not only knew the rendezvous I was supposed to keep but the time I was to keep it.

"ap 02:45"|"quarter to three"|"It was quarter to three when he came back and by that time my own stomach was protesting at the lack of attention; it had had plenty of coffee but very little solid food.

Hell, he probably was a Russian, as had been Gordon Lonsdale, another of his stripe."|"Running Blind"|"Desmond Bagley"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"To this rhetorical question Ilyich made no answer, and Slade said, ‘All right; you and the others are to be at the Nordri Agency at eleven tomorrow. As soon as you spot Stewart I must be notified by telephone immediately. Is that understood?’"|"Running Blind"|"Desmond Bagley"

I discovered that the spare shirt in the cell was to be used as a night shirt, that lights-out was ten-thirty, that the waking call was six-thirty in the morning, that I was to be issued with a razor blade to be returned after shaving.

"ap 02:30"|two-thirty|"At two-thirty we were marched into the yard for free exercise. Some of the boys were kicking a ball about, but most strolled up and down enjoying the sun and the sky and the air. I drifted over to Cosgrove and we walked the length of the yard. He said, ‘I’ll tell you where it’s coming over and then we walk right past, see? Then I’ll take you to the place you have to wait. You stay there and you keep one eye on me and one on the wall—but don’t stare at it as though expecting something to happen.’"|"Running Blind"|"Desmond Bagley"

"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"I looked at my reflection in the mirror. Gone was the black hair and I was now middling blond. I was surprised at the difference it made; even Mackintosh wouldn’t recognize me now. I felt her fingers on my cheek. ‘You’ll have to shave twice a day.

"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"She was right, I thought; the five o’clock shadow does give the game away.

"ap 01:00"|one|"I jumped over the sprawl of wriggling bodies and ran down the corridor, the pistol in my hand with the safety catch off. The corridor was wood-panelled with doors on either side which I ignored. At the end was a stair landing with stairs going both up and down. I went up. I had made my decision on that one the previous evening. It’s a curious thing, but people escaping from a house always try to get immediately to the ground floor—which is why they’re usually caught. I suppose it’s an instinctive reaction, but the department that trained me worked hard to eradicate it."|"Running Blind"|"Desmond Bagley"
18:30|"six-thirty—early evening"|"‘You’re just in time for your tea,’ said Mrs O’Sullivan, and went off in a bustle into the kitchen with Alison close behind her.

It was six-thirty—early evening—less than twenty-four hours had passed since Alison had punctured Taafe in the kneecap."|"Running Blind"|"Desmond Bagley"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"‘I’m just going to make a telephone call,’ said Alison, and slipped away. I looked at the yachts and the sea and tried to figure how I could get aboard Artina but without much success because I didn’t know where she would be lying.

"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"IV
At ten o’clock next morning we were sitting on the terrace overlooking the yacht basin and imbibing something long, cold and not too alcoholic. We both wore sun-glasses, not as much to shade our eyes as to join the anonymous throng just as the film stars do. The binoculars were to hand and all that was lacking was Artina and Wheeler, and, possibly, Slade."|"Running Blind"|"Desmond Bagley"
"< 00:00"|"nearly midnight"|"We swam and lazed the days away and danced the nights away for three days and three nights until, on the morrow, Wheeler was due to arrive. It was nearly midnight when I brought up the subject of Mr Smith. Alison took no umbrage this time but, perhaps, it was because I had been plying her with the demon alcohol. Had it been the opposition tipping the bottle she would have been wary but the hand that filled her glass was the hand of a friend and she was taken unaware. Sneaky!"|"Running Blind"|"Desmond Bagley"
12:00|midday|"So the pair of us ate a hearty breakfast and sallied forth into the hot streets of Valletta, a heat seemingly intensified by the warm golden limestone of the buildings. The Port Captain expected Artina at midday and that was sad news. Sadder still was the information that the fuelling ship had been booked in advance and was to go alongside as soon as Artina anchored."|"Running Blind"|"Desmond Bagley"
"ap 02:30"|two-thirty|"It was a long hot day. Artina was late and I began to wonder if she hadn’t by-passed Malta and headed straight for Albania.

To our left Valletta rose, clifflike and impregnable, festooned with lights. There were no lights on Artina, though, apart from the obligatory riding lights; since it was 2.30 a.m. this was not surprising. I hoped everyone on board was in the habit of sleeping soundly."|"Running Blind"|"Desmond Bagley"
10:30|"ten-thirty that morning"|"III
It all took time, and we had little enough of that. I was right in thinking that I could get a suitable boatshed in Senglea, but moving in quickly was something else again. A few enquiries made in the district soon turned up just what I wanted but the dickering promised to be protracted and it was ten-thirty that morning before the deal went through and only then because of the production of a hundred pounds in crisp, British fivers."|"Running Blind"|"Desmond Bagley"
"ap 01:30"|one-thirty|"I got all my equipment to the shed and waited around for Alison. I stared across the Grand Harbour to Valletta and wished I could see through it and into Marsamxett Harbour where Artina was still anchored—I hoped.

19:00|"seven in the evening"|"Alison was back long before I had got that far and gave me a hand. It was hot and sweaty work and it took time. It was seven in the evening when I put the finishing touch to it. ‘Did you get the axe?’"|"Running Blind"|"Desmond Bagley"
