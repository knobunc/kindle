She gave him a closed-eye look and went through into the other room as the men left the house. The mutton fat spluttered in the lamp. Wearily, as she lay down again on the improvised bed — it might have been midnight, but she guessed that in a hypothetical world of clocks it would be accounted not yet nine p.m. — the face of Jeff Pitt came before her."|Greybeard|"Brian W.

Her captors had tied her to the supports of a heavy metal bench on which lay discarded galleys of lead type, and she had been unable to break free. She estimated she had been lying there since midnight."|Greybeard|"Brian W. Aldiss"

Perhaps because his father, it was rumoured, was a college servant, his attitude to the university was astonishingly respectful. We had to be inside college by seven p.m., but that was no hardship. I recall that even at the time we regarded his regime as one of historical necessity. It was after he died that things became really intolerable. Croucher’s soldiery turned into a rabble of looters. That was the worst time in our whole miserable half-century of decline.”"|Greybeard|"Brian W. Aldiss"
