of never rising before noon, and on one occasion, when a carelessly-thrown

remain between the sheets for forty-eight hours; but sloth on so majestic a

which one first became acquainted with this ma or that; for as a general thing
I lay no claim to the possession of one of those hair-trigger memories which
come from subscribing to the correspondence courses advertised in the
magazines. And yet I can state without doubt or hesitation that the individual
afterwards known as Battling Billson entered my life at half-past four on the
afternoon of Saturday, September the tenth, two days after my twenty-seventh
birthday. For there was that about my first sight of him which has caused the
event to remain photographically lined on the tablets of my mind when a
yesterday has faded from its page. Not only was our meeting dramatic and even
startling, but it had in it something of the quality of the last straw, the
final sling or arrow of outrageous Fortune. It seemed to put the lid on the
sadness of life."|Ukridge|"P. G. Wodehouse"

we bucked up again for a bit. Her room’s on the second floor, but I knew where
there was a ladder, so I went and got it, and she was just hopping up as merry

policeman, wanting to know what the game was. The whole trouble with the police

that they’re snoopers to a man. Zeal, I suppose they call it. Why they can’t
attend to their own affairs is more than I can understand. Dozens of murders
going on all the time, probably, all over Wimbledon, and all this bloke would

true reporter’s gift for picking out the detail that really mattered. One could
have said many things about Flossie’s mother, as, for instance, that she was
stout, cheerful, and far more tightly laced than a doctor would have considered
judicious; but what stood out above all the others was the fact that she was
wearing a pink hat. It was the largest, gayest, most exuberantly ornate
specimen of head-wear that I had ever seen, and the prospect of spending four
hours and a quarter in its society added the last touch to my already poignant
gloom. The only gleam of sunshine that lightened my darkness was the reflection
that, if we went to a picture-palace, she would have to remove it."|Ukridge|"P. G. Wodehouse"

six-forty-six, ignoring the pink hat which protruded from the window of a
third-class compartment and the stout hand that waved a rollicking farewell, I
turned from the train with a pale, set face, and, passing down the platform of
Euston Station, told a cabman to take me with all speed to Ukridge’s lodgings
in Arundel Street, Leicester Square. There had never, so far as I knew, been a
murder in Arundel Street, but I was strongly of opinion that that time was
ripe. Cecil’s society and conversation had done much to neutralise the effects
of a gentle upbringing and I toyed almost luxuriously with the thought of
supplying him with an Arundel Street Horror for his next visit to the
Metropolis."|Ukridge|"P. G. Wodehouse"

night, but it was nearly two in the morning. The streets were black and
deserted, silence was everywhere, and all London slept except Ukridge and a
friend of his whom I came upon standing outside Hardy’s fishing tackle shop.

on the pavement with his back against a lamp-post."|Ukridge|"P. G. Wodehouse"

cannot say that this suggestion gave me the rapturous pleasure it seemed to
give Bowles, who nearly dropped the potato dish in his emotion; but still I
must say that on the whole the man was not an exacting guest. His practice of
never rising before lunch-time ensured me those mornings of undisturbed
solitude which are so necessary to the young writer if he is to give Interesting
Bits of his best; and if I had work to do in the evenings he was always
ready to toddle downstairs and smoke a pipe with Bowles, whom he seemed to find
as congenial a companion as Bowles found him. His only defect, indeed, was the
habit he had developed of looking in on me in my bedroom at all hours of the
night to discuss some new scheme designed to relieve him of his honourable
obligations to Miss Mabel Price, of Balbriggan, Peabody Road, Clapham Common.
My outspoken remarks on this behaviour checked him for forty-eight hours, but
at three o’clock on the Sunday morning that ended the first week of his visit
light flashing out above my head told me that he was in again."|Ukridge|"P. G. Wodehouse"

that my aunt is dangerously ill.”"|Ukridge|"P. G. Wodehouse"

o’clock"|"At nine
o’clock on the following evening I stood on the steps of Balbriggan waiting for
my ring at the bell to be answered. Cats prowled furtively in the purple dusk,
and from behind a lighted window on the ground floor of the house came the
tinkle of a piano and the sound of voices raised in one of the more mournful
types of hymn. I recognised Ukridge’s above the rest. He was expressing with a
vigour which nearly cracked the glass a desire to be as a little child washed
clean of sin, and it somehow seemed to deepen my already substantial gloom.
Long experience of Ukridge’s ingenious schemes had given me a fatalistic
feeling with regard to them. With whatever fair prospects I started out to
co-operate with him on these occasions, I almost invariably found myself
entangled sooner or later in some nightmare imbroglio."|Ukridge|"P. G. Wodehouse"

once given, the nickname stuck; and this in spite of the fact—seeing that we
were caught half-way through the first cigarette and forcefully dealt with by a
muscular head master-that that magpie of his would appear to have known a
thing or two. For five happy years, till we parted to go to our respective
universities, I never called Coote anything but Looney; and it was as Looney
that I greeted him when we happened upon each other one afternoon at Sandown,
shortly after the conclusion of the three o’clock race."|Ukridge|"P. G. Wodehouse"

rather neat phrase happening to occur to me at the breakfast table, coincident
with the reflection that possibly Ukridge was right and it did behove his old
schoolfellows to rally round the candidate, I spent the morning turning out a
new ballad. Having finished this by noon, I dispatched it to the Bull Hotel,
and went off to lunch with something of that feeling of satisfaction which, as
Ukridge had pointed out, does come to altruists. I was strolling down
Piccadilly, enjoying an after-luncheon smoke, when I ran into Looney Coote."|Ukridge|"P. G. Wodehouse"

say another word, old man, not another word,” he pleaded. “It’s the sort of
thing that might have happened to anyone. And, as a matter of fact, the whole
affair has done me a bit of good. Dashed lucky it has turned out for me. You
see, it came as a sort of omen. There was an absolute outsider running in the
third race at Kempton Park the day after the car went called Stolen Goods, and
somehow it seemed to me that the thing had been sent for a purpose. I crammed
on thirty quid at twenty-five to one. The people round about laughed when they
saw me back this poor, broken-down-looking moke, and, dash it, the animal
simply romped home! I collected a parcel!”"|Ukridge|"P. G. Wodehouse"

paper which occasionally made use of my services as a special writer had sent
me to compose a fuller and more scholarly report than its local correspondent

those revivalists who periodically convulse the emotions of the Welsh mining

gone shares in this thing. Izzy came down a week ago, hired the hall, and
looked after the advertising and so on; and I arrived with good old Billson
this afternoon. We’re giving him twenty quid, and the other fellow’s getting
another twenty; and all the rest of the cash Izzy and I split on a fifty-fifty
basis. Affluence, laddie! That’s what it means. Affluence beyond the dreams of
a Monte Cristo. Owing to this Jones fellow the place is crowded, and every
sportsman for miles around will be there to-morrow at five bob a head, cheaper
seats two-and-six, and standing-room one shilling. Add lemonade and fried fish
privileges, and you have a proposition almost without parallel in the annals
of commerce. I couldn’t be more on velvet if they gave me a sack and a shovel

her, suspended by a strap, I fell in love absolutely in a flash. I give you my
honest word, laddie, I fell in love with her for all eternity between Sloane
Square and South Kensington stations. She got out at South Kensington. So did
I. I followed her to the house, rang the bell, got the maid to show me in, and,
once I was in, put up a yarn about being misdirected and coming to the wrong
address and all that sort of thing. I think they thought I was looney or trying
to sell life insurance or something, but I didn’t mind that. A few days later I
called, and after that I hung about, keeping an eye on their movements, met ‘em
everywhere they went, and bowed and passed a word and generally made my
presence felt, and—well, to cut a long story short, old horse, we’re engaged. I
happened to find out that Millie was in the habit of taking the dog for a run
in Kensington Gardens every morning at eleven, and after that things began to
move. It took a bit of doing, of course, getting up so early, but I was on the
spot every day and we talked and bunged sticks for the dog, and—well, as I say,
we’re engaged. She is the most amazing, wonderful girl, laddie, that you ever
encountered in your life.”"|Ukridge|"P. G. Wodehouse"

any trouble. Just throw it a word or two every now and then and give it a bit
of bread dipped in tea or something, and you won’t have to worry about it at
all. And I’ll be round by noon at the latest to take it away. May Heaven reward
