"ap 01:00"|"one o'clock"|"Cube stared down, seeing the river so close below that the centaur could almost have galloped on it. The loan sharks saw it too, and quickly clustered, snapping at hoofs. But Karia was already gaining altitude, just out of their reach. Still, it was scary; any mistake, and the sharks would feed on four centaur legs and two human legs, and four arms as well. Cube wasn't sure whether they ate anything other than arms and legs, and didn't care to find out.
""Dragon at one o'clock,"" the centaur murmured.
Was it that late in the day already? Oh--she meant a direction. Cube looked forward, just right of the arrow quiver. There it was, swooping down, not firing fire. Instead it was shaping its mouth to form a word. In this case, a word was more deadly than fire."|"Cube Route"|"Piers Anthony"
"~ 12:00"|"around midday"|"Still, around midday she was ready to rest, so she sat on a convenient bench and got the weight off her feet. Diamond seemed satisfied to get off her feet too. ""You're good company,"" Cube told her, patting her head. ""You don't complain, you don't rush ahead or drag behind, you don't criticize my decisions."" The dog's tail wagged."|"Cube Route"|"Piers Anthony"
00:00|Midnight|"The ghost looked at her watch. ""Midnight. That seems appropriate. Yes, I will be here then."""|"Cube Route"|"Piers Anthony"
00:00|midnight|"""But you say you will exchange back at midnight. Then she will have the same problem."""|"Cube Route"|"Piers Anthony"
00:00|midnight|"The woman talked until she fell asleep. Cube waited until midnight, then stood by the bed. She felt something overlapping her body. Hello Silhouette, she thought. Check your memory. You have a new boyfriend and a new life. She hoped that was true. It would be if Silhouette went along with it."|"Cube Route"|"Piers Anthony"
"ap ~ 02:00"|"about two"|"""Fourteen, I think. I was a foundling, about two when found in a cabbage patch."""|"Cube Route"|"Piers Anthony"
12:00|noon|"They continued along the path, following the thread. They stopped at a conveniently situated garden at noon, where Cube harvested and ate a peanut pie and Diamond discovered a biscuit tree with assorted dog biscuits. The dog was obviously surprised, but pleased, and feasted on them."|"Cube Route"|"Piers Anthony"
"> 02:00"|"Two hours after midnight"|"""When will we reach Castle Zombie?"" Cube asked.
""Two hours after midnight. You should get some sleep.""
""I should,"" Cube agreed. ""But wake me if there is any trouble."""|"Cube Route"|"Piers Anthony"
00:00|midnight|"""Because this is the Isle of the Goles. It relates to Xanth only once a day, actually night, at midnight, and has no connection at other times. So there is no way to the enchanted path. Not until next midnight."""|"Cube Route"|"Piers Anthony"
00:00|midnight|"""No,"" Cent said. ""I want you to help these nice folk get off the isle. Viate led them astray, and they need to leave immediately.""
""But they must wait until midnight.""
""We know that,"" Cube said. ""But we thought that if anyone could help us leave sooner, you are the one. You have such--"""|"Cube Route"|"Piers Anthony"
00:00|midnight|"""Not until midnight,"" Karia informed her. ""It seems we were led here at the one time it was possible."""|"Cube Route"|"Piers Anthony"
"< 00:00"|"before midnight"|"""I can't get you off the isle before midnight, either,"" the demon responded."|"Cube Route"|"Piers Anthony"
00:00|midnight|"""Hello,"" Goldie said. Her mane was bright golden yellow. ""We can give you housing for the night, and show you the isle in the day, and conduct you to the connection with Xanth at midnight."""|"Cube Route"|"Piers Anthony"
00:00|midnight|"""We're on Gole Isle. The goles are nice folk, but their island touches Xanth only at midnight. I have a baby to deliver, and--"""|"Cube Route"|"Piers Anthony"
"< 12:00"|"Near noon"|"Near noon they came to a wayside stop. A girl was already there, sitting at a table. ""Will you join me?"" she called. ""I have lots of incidentals."""|"Cube Route"|"Piers Anthony"
