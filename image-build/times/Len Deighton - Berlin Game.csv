He likes finding new pubs that no one knows about except the locals. It was closing time. He asked the publican for another drink and they wouldn’t serve him. Then a man standing at the counter offered to take him to a chess club in Soho – Kar’s Club in Gerrard Street. There’s a members’ bar there which serves drinks until three in the morning. This Russian was a member and offered to put Giles up for membership and Giles joined. It’s not much of a place, from what I can gather – arty people and writers, and so on. He plays chess rather well, and it began to be a habit that he went there regularly and played the Russian, or just watched someone else playing.’"|"Berlin Game"|"Len Deighton"

‘No, no, no. It’s midnight,’ he protested.
‘It’s Bernard Samson, from Operations,’ I said. Why the hell had I been worrying about Giles Trent recognizing me in the club? Here I was on his doorstep and he was treating me like a vacuum-cleaner salesman. ‘I work on the German desk with Dicky Cruyer.’"|"Berlin Game"|"Len Deighton"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"I’d returned home very late after my visit to Giles Trent and that night I slept heavily. By seven o’clock next morning, Fiona’s place alongside me in bed was empty.

"ap 08:30"|8.30|"Bret Rensselaer liked to describe himself as a ‘workaholic’. That this description was a tired old cliché didn’t deter him from using it. He liked clichés. They were, he said, the best way to get simple ideas into the heads of idiots. But his description of himself was accurate enough; he liked work. He’d inherited a house in the Virgin Islands and a portfolio of stock that would keep him idling in the sun for the rest of his days, if that was his inclination. But he was always at his desk by 8.30 and had never been known to have a day off for sickness. A day off for other reasons was not unusual: Easter at Le Touquet, Whitsun at Deauville, the Royal Enclosure in June and the Dublin Horse Show in August were appointments marked in red pencil on Bret’s year-planner."|"Berlin Game"|"Len Deighton"

The table at the Connaught Hotel Grill Room was for eight o’clock. No place for a big car like mine in Curzon Street. They’re double-parked there by seven on some evenings at this time of year.

No one got a wink of sleep.’ He sipped some of his brandy. ‘About three o’clock in the morning, a cipher clerk came in with an intercept from the Russian Army transmitter at Karlshorst. It was a message from the commanding general requesting that some military airfield in southwest Czechoslovakia be kept operational on a twenty-four-hour basis until further notice. I knew what that message referred to because of other signals I’d seen, and I knew it wasn’t anything to do with the Baader-Meinhof people, so I put a hold on that message. My interception unit was the only one to file that signal that night, and I’ve checked that one through NATO.’"|"Berlin Game"|"Len Deighton"

Unter den Linden suffered and the passage through to the Friedrichstrasse was ruined. There were unexploded bombs in the grounds of the Italian Embassy and the house of the Richthofen family. A bomb stopped the church clock on Ku-Damm and it’s stayed at seven-thirty ever since. Sometimes I say to him, “You stopped that clock the night you were born.” Werner’s mother was the cook for us. She lived with her husband in an attic just four doors along from here. I went and got her just before her contractions began. Werner was born in this house, did you know that? Of course you did. I must have told you a thousand times.’"|"Berlin Game"|"Len Deighton"

They’d taken my wristwatch, of course, along with my money, a packet of French cigarettes, and my Swiss Army knife, but I could hear a church or a municipal clock striking each hour. Lenin was amiable. He even laughed at a joke I made about the coffee. He was older than I had estimated: my age perhaps. No wonder that chase through the forest had made him puff. He wore a brown corduroy suit with button-down top pocket and braided edges to the lapels. I wondered if he’d designed it himself or had picked it up from some old village tailor in a remote part of Hungary or Rumania. He liked travelling; he told me that. Then he talked about old American films, the time he’d spent seconded to the security police in Cuba, and his love for English detective stories."|"Berlin Game"|"Len Deighton"
