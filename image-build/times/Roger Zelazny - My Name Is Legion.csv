"ap 05:10"|five-ten|"I studied her. Her hair was sort of reddish and she had freckles, lots of them. Her eyes were green. They seemed to be set quite far apart beneath the ruddy line of her bangs. She was fairly tall, like five-ten, though she was not standing at the moment I had danced with her once at a shipboard party."|"My Name Is Legion"|"Roger Zelazny"
00:00|midnight|"I send one Christmas card each year, and it is unsigned. All it bears, in block print, is a list of four bars and the cities in which they exist. On Easter, May Day, the first day of summer, and Halloween, I sit in those bars and sip drinks from nine until midnight, local time. Then I go away. Each year, they’re different bars."|"My Name Is Legion"|"Roger Zelazny"
"ap ~ 05:10"|"about five-ten"|"This seemed to relax them slightly, because they both sighed. The man asking the questions was about five foot eight in height, the other about five-ten. The taller man was heavy, though. Around two hundred pounds, I’d say."|"My Name Is Legion"|"Roger Zelazny"
"~ 04:00"|"about four in the morning"|"Then, about four in the morning, I decided that I should have phrased that question the other way around."|"My Name Is Legion"|"Roger Zelazny"
"ap 05:55"|"five till six"|"I couldn’t tell whether they thought I was bluffing. They had said I had a low violence index, which meant they had had access to my personnel file or to Central. Which meant I had to try keeping them off balance for the time I had remaining, there on the Eve of RUMOKO. But my bedside alarm showed five till six, and I went on duty at eight o’clock. If they knew as much as they seemed to know, they probably had access to the duty rosters also."|"My Name Is Legion"|"Roger Zelazny"

"ap 06:15"|"six fifteen"|"“Your boss obviously has a lot of money to throw around,” I said, glancing at me clock and seeing that it was now six fifteen. “No, I must refuse your offer.”"|"My Name Is Legion"|"Roger Zelazny"
"ap 06:25"|"Six twenty-five"|"… And he glanced at my clock, again.
Six twenty-five.
He had done it several times, and I had dismissed it. But now it seemed something more than a desire to know the time."|"My Name Is Legion"|"Roger Zelazny"
"ap 06:40"|Six-forty|"“Sergeant,” she then said, “I want you to make some arrests.” She looked at me. “What is your room number?” she asked.
“Six-forty,” I replied.
“Six-forty,” she said. “Two men … Right … Yes … Thank you.” And she hung up."|"My Name Is Legion"|"Roger Zelazny"
"ap 06:40"|Six-forty|"“Six-forty,” she said. “Two men … Right … Yes … Thank you.” And she hung up."|"My Name Is Legion"|"Roger Zelazny"

"ap > 11:00"|"a little after eleven"|"It was on May Day, not all that long ago, though it seems so, that I sat to the rear of the bar at Captain Tony’s in Key West, to the right, near to the fireplace, drinking one of my seasonal beers. It was a little after eleven, and I had about decided that this one was a write-off, when Don came in through the big open front of the place. He glanced around, his eyes passing over me, located a vacant stool near the forward corner of the bar, took it, and ordered something. There were too many people between us, and the group had returned to the stage at the rear of the room behind me and begun another set, with a loud opening number. So, for a time, we just sat there, wondering, I guess."|"My Name Is Legion"|"Roger Zelazny"
17:00|"Five that day"|"Paul and I were sent over to Station Five that day. Standard inspection and maintenance work. Dull, safe, routine. We scarcely got wet."|"My Name Is Legion"|"Roger Zelazny"
"ap 06:00"|six|"“Okay … Well, I’ll be seeing you.”
“Tomorrow, at six.”
“Right. Good night.”"|"My Name Is Legion"|"Roger Zelazny"
"ap 06:30"|"six thirty"|"“Oh?” I said, automatically glancing at my watch. “So we eat at seven instead of six thirty,” he said, chuckling."|"My Name Is Legion"|"Roger Zelazny"
"ap ~ 10:30"|"around ten-thirty"|"I went and rinsed my face, to complete the waking-up process and give me a chance to think. A glance at my watch showed me that it was around ten-thirty."|"My Name Is Legion"|"Roger Zelazny"
00:00|midnight|"I half hoped that this would be one of the occasions when Don failed to show up. I had sufficient funds to hold me through spring and I did not really feel like working. I had summered farther north, was anchored now in the Chesapeake, and was anxious to continue Caribbeanward. A growing chill and some nasty winds told me I had tarried overlong in these latitudes. Still, the understanding was that I remain in the chosen bar until midnight. Two hours to go."|"My Name Is Legion"|"Roger Zelazny"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"“Yes?”
“Mister Donne? It is eight o’clock.”
“Thanks.”"|"My Name Is Legion"|"Roger Zelazny"
