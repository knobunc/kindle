There’s no furniture in my cell—I’m stretched out on the painted green rectangle where I’m allowed to sleep. The way my skin is, I hardly feel it anyway. The facility is rated for enhanced offenders, but I’m the only one currently in residence. I am their showpiece, the pride of the system, and a regular feature on the governor’s tours for visiting dignitaries. They come and watch the performance, to see the tiger in his cage, and I don’t disappoint."|"Soon I Will Be Invincible"|"Austin Grossman"
06:20|"6:20 a.m."|"By the time the bus came that morning it was raining pretty hard, and the world was a grayed-out sketch of itself, the bus a dim hulk as it approached, the only thing moving. Inside the bus shelter, the rain drummed hollowly on the plastic ceiling, and my glasses were fogging up. It was 6:20 a.m., and my parents and I were standing, stunned and half-awake, in the parking lot of a Howard Johnson’s in Iowa."|"Soon I Will Be Invincible"|"Austin Grossman"
"ap 03:00"|three|"We kept driving through the slate gray morning that grew slowly brighter, although the rain kept up. Most people were asleep, and every twenty minutes or so we would stop to pick up another child, another one of us. Most of the kids must have gotten up at three or four in the morning to meet the bus as it crossed the state. Everyone was drowsing or sleeping or staring out the window. I slept a little myself, although it felt strange to be dozing off among all these strangers. No one talked, but there was a faintly intimate process taking place among us, a bond forming out of the shared unfamiliarity of the trip. We wouldn’t forget it. For all of us, it was the start of a new phase of our lives; a group identity was taking shape out of the rainy morning and the engine noises and forty-eight dreaming minds."|"Soon I Will Be Invincible"|"Austin Grossman"

21:30|"9:30 p.m."|"For the first few months we had to sleep in the gym. The student dormitories hadn’t been finished properly, and they flooded and had to be rebuilt. Sheets were hung for privacy. We congregated at 9:30 p.m. and were led to the bathroom in groups of fifteen, and there was the funny feeling of seeing kids from your math class again in their pajamas, each holding toothbrush, cup, and toothpaste, being herded sleepily to the line of sinks. We were seeing one another the way only our family had seen us. We’d get back, each to our sleeping bag, to stare up at the moths fluttering around by the ceiling. At 10:15 exactly, the big overhead lights audibly went out, and a chorus of whispers would rise. It was hard to fall asleep in such a big room—your ears picked up how big it was. The girls slept in the library, laid out among the shelves and study tables, but I never heard how that was, although I tried to imagine it—quieter, sounds vanishing instead of bouncing around."|"Soon I Will Be Invincible"|"Austin Grossman"

"ap 06:03"|"six three"|"At six three, Blackwolf is overmatched by a foot and a half, but it doesn’t seem to bother him. He looks like a masked Beowulf against a hairy Grendel.

05:00|"5:00 a.m."|"It’s 5:00 a.m., so I dress in street clothes and wait for the meet on a snowy bench in Boston Common, hood up, trying to look inconspicuous. One guy stops and stares at me, but I ignore him."|"Soon I Will Be Invincible"|"Austin Grossman"
10:30|"10:30 a.m."|"I kicked open the van’s rear door and stepped into the street. A light snow was falling, frosting the edges of things and darkening the asphalt. I had spent months designing and assembling the robots, sewing the costume, fabricating the equipment hanging from my belt. And now I was standing in the street in midtown Manhattan, squinting in the sudden light, midmorning traffic swerving around me, the crowd just beginning to react. It was 10:30 a.m. on a Tuesday, late January, and in the skyscrapers overhead office workers were just halfway through the morning’s work, rustling papers and chatting at their desks. I was twenty-four years old."|"Soon I Will Be Invincible"|"Austin Grossman"

"ap 11:00"|eleven|"Standing upright on the gravel surface of the roof, moonlight illuminates the whole city. Anyone looking up could see me, but although it’s only eleven, the world seems asleep. I recognize landmarks from years ago—Memorial Hall, Thayer Hall. The padlock on the skylight is the same as it was twenty-five years ago, and I reach for my utility belt. I manage to pick it silently, even in gloves."|"Soon I Will Be Invincible"|"Austin Grossman"
00:00|midnight|"I was halfway to being a campus legend; people would point me out when they saw me in the windowless snack room on the fourth level, sipping coffee and eating Skittles. I lived in the libraries doing my own research, hunting in the card catalog. Every night the security people ushered me out at midnight, and found me waiting every morning when they came to unlock the glass doors. I lived in the hum of the fluorescents, the muted rustling of paper and rumble of movable stacks. I began checking out older and older books, books whose call slips had not been stamped for decades; books with odd but informative notes scribbled in the margins by undergraduates from the twenties and thirties. It was in this way that I first became acquainted with the name of Ernest Kleinfeld. But no one listed in the libraries of America’s oldest, wisest institution had ever answered my questions."|"Soon I Will Be Invincible"|"Austin Grossman"
00:00|midnight|"After a while, I was asked by the university to take time off, counseling recommended. I refused. I went down to the library as I usually did, where I studied and read all day. At midnight, the stacks closed, and I sat down on the front steps. The long winter had passed, and it was a warm, misty night in May. Here and there, students were hurrying back to their dorms, laughing and talking about trivial things that I could no longer imagine."|"Soon I Will Be Invincible"|"Austin Grossman"
05:00|"five in the morning"|"I guess she got bored with me. Some nights on the island, it’s beautiful—tropical constellations, jungle sounds, and luminous fish. But when it’s five in the morning in the hideout and you can’t sleep, and CNN’s stuck on another economic summit, well, that’s another feeling. You’re blacked out and can’t work because some hero team is trolling the South Seas, the heat is unbearable, and it’s an hour until dawn, the slow tropical sunrise over the lagoon, and you’re thinking about how far you are from home, and that this whole thing was maybe not such a brilliant idea after all, but there’s nothing you can do about it now."|"Soon I Will Be Invincible"|"Austin Grossman"
11:31|"11:31 a.m."|"The day after the funeral, the old guard arrives to give us a briefing. Stormcloud and Regina, the surviving members of the Super Squadron, Damsel’s father and stepmother. It’s 11:31 a.m. by the digital clock that never stops blinking inside my left eye. There’s probably a way to turn it off, but that knowledge vanished with the rest of the Protheon Corporation."|"Soon I Will Be Invincible"|"Austin Grossman"
00:19|"12:19 a.m."|"It’s 12:19 a.m. at the Champions Building, but I guess superheroes are supposed to stay up late. It’s resident members only, plus Mister Mystic, who is favoring us with his absurdly dignified presence; apparently, he keeps odd hours as well.

"ap 02:30"|2:30|"I know Blackwolf keeps a lab somewhere upstairs. It’s already a late night, but I wait until 2:30 before I go looking.

There’s a keypad lock, but, as I said, I’m good at things like that."|"Soon I Will Be Invincible"|"Austin Grossman"
06:14|"6:14 a.m."|"Blackwolf’s scheme isn’t working. It’s 6:14 a.m. by that ever-blinking clock, and none of us has slept all night. I sag in my harness, tired of clinging to the museum roof. The Nightstar sits untouched in its leaded-glass display case at the Institute for Advanced Thought. Doctor Impossible didn’t come. No one is coming. And Blackwolf has managed to direct the whole operation without speaking to me once."|"Soon I Will Be Invincible"|"Austin Grossman"
12:00|noon|"“It was noon, and they were already a little drunk when they found me, a tiny woman in a nightdress, four and a half feet tall, inhumanly graceful even in sleep.

"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"“Like you, I had powers. I could have gone your way. I didn’t, but you know, I can almost imagine what it must have been like. The first time, as you waited for the sun to go down, not until eight o’clock maybe in the summer months. You’d wait in your room, doing a few stretches while the streets cleared. You were in your apartment, maybe, in New York."|"Soon I Will Be Invincible"|"Austin Grossman"
00:00|midnight|"“I want you to tell me when it’s midnight exactly.” The clock inside me counts slowly down while we watch the moon rise.

"ap < 00:00"|"almost twelve"|"I suppose I ought to vow to oppose him forever; make a nemesis issue out of it. But it’s a little beside the point. It’s not like I’d get to hunt him down—we’re about to send him to prison. And with CoreFire back, he’s already got a nemesis. I’d have to be co-nemesis. And since he saved my life and gave me superpowers, I’m not 100 percent sure what I’m supposed to be angry about, if we come down to it. Although I do wonder what scheme or inspiration I was part of at the beginning. One day, I’ll have to ask him.
It’s almost twelve. I nudge Elphin and whisper, “It’s coming. Now.”
“Here,” she says. She hands me the hammer. “I want you to finish this. Throw it out there. Far as you can.” She points out over the water."|"Soon I Will Be Invincible"|"Austin Grossman"
