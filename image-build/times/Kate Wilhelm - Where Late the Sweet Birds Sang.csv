"ap 06:30"|"six thirty"|"""Okay, Walt, you get in my bed,"" David said, almost resentfully. ""I'll go down to the lab, get things rolling there. I'll come up for you at six thirty."" Walt didn't protest, but fell onto the bed without bothering to take off his shoes. David pulled them off. Walt's socks were more holes than not, but probably they kept his ankles warm. David left them on, pulled the blanket over him, and went to the lab."|"Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang"|"Kate Wilhelm"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"For the next three hours they questioned, argued, prayed, formed alliances, reformed them as arguments broke out in the smaller groups. At ten Walt took his place on the table again and called out. ""We will recess this discussion until tomorrow night at seven. Coffee will be served now, and I understand we have cakes and sandwiches."" He jumped from the table and left before any of them could catch up with him, and he and David hurried to the cave entrance, locking the massive door behind them."|"Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang"|"Kate Wilhelm"

"ap 05:45"|"five forty-five"|"The bloodless births started at five forty-five, and at twelve thirty they had twenty-five infants. Four died in the first hour, another died three hours later, and the rest of them thrived. The only baby left in the tanks was the fetus that would be Celia, nine weeks younger than the others."|"Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang"|"Kate Wilhelm"

"ap 10:00"|"Ten o'clock"|"Her sisters would be in the food-processing kitchens this week, Molly thought, as she watched the oar dip into the clear water. Laughing together, moving together. Perhaps they missed her already . . . She pulled steadily, lifted the oar, watched it dip again.
""Rock! Ten o'clock, twenty yards!"" Lewis called.
They shifted course easily to give it a wide berth."|"Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang"|"Kate Wilhelm"
"ap 09:00"|"Nine o'clock"|"They shifted course easily to give it a wide berth.
""Nine o'clock, twenty yards!""
Thomas, in front of Molly, was wide-shouldered, his hair the color of straw, and as straight as straw. A slight breeze lifted it and let it fall over and over. His muscles moved fluidly, and perspiration glazed him. Molly thought he would make a fine drawing, a study in musculature. He turned and said something to Harvey, across the boat from him, and they both laughed."|"Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang"|"Kate Wilhelm"
"ap 00:00"|"Twelve o'clock"|"""Rocks! Twelve o'clock, thirty yards!"" Lewis called. Guiltily Molly flipped the sketch pad to a clean page and began to draw the river and its hazards."|"Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang"|"Kate Wilhelm"
"ap 11:00"|"Eleven o'clock"|"They stared at the school of fish in wonder, and the boat drifted until Lewis shouted, ""Obstacle! Eleven o'clock, ten yards!"" They pulled the oars hard and the school of fish vanished, but the gloom had lifted. While they rowed, they talked of ways of netting fish for dinner, of drying fish for the return trip, of the excitement in the valley when they learned that fish had survived after all."|"Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang"|"Kate Wilhelm"
12:00|noon|"""Let's split into pairs here,"" Lewis said, taking command once more. ""Meet back here at noon. Molly and Jed, over there. Ben and Thomas, that way. Harvey and I will start over there."" He pointed as he spoke, and the others nodded. Molly had identified the locations for them: the Senate Office Building was up there; the Post Office Building; the General Services Building . . ."|"Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang"|"Kate Wilhelm"
12:00|midday|"By the third day the return trip had turned into a nightmare. The wind became gusty, more dangerous than helpful, and they no longer tried to use the sail. The current was swifter, the water muddy. It must have rained much more inland than it had in Washington. Also, the air had a chill that persisted until midday, when the sun became too hot for the warm clothing they had put on earlier. By sundown it was too cool for the lighter garments they had changed into at the lunch break. They were always too hot or too cold."|"Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang"|"Kate Wilhelm"
"ap 08:00"|"Eight o'clock"|"Molly got up, continuing to pump until Thomas was in place, ready to take over without interruption. As she started for the rear oar, Lewis said, ""You take the prow."" They put the oars back in the locks. The rain pounded them, and Thomas pumped harder. The water was sloshing about their feet, and when the lines to shore were untied the boat swung sharply into the river. The water inside the boat surged back and forth.
""Log! Coming fast! Eight o'clock!"" Molly yelled.
They turned the boat, and it shot forward and they were flashing down the river, keeping abreast of the log that was off to their left."|"Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang"|"Kate Wilhelm"
"ap 00:00"|"Twelve o'clock"|"""Stump! Twelve o'clock! Twenty yards!"" Molly hardly had time to get the words out. They jerked the boat to the left and flew past the stump. The flood had changed everything. The stump had been ashore when they passed it before. The current became swifter, and they fought to get closer in. ""Tree! One o'clock! Twenty yards!"" They veered out again and now the log that was pacing them tumbled and came dangerously close. ""Log! Nine o'clock! Three yards!"""|"Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang"|"Kate Wilhelm"
"ap 01:00"|"One o'clock"|"""Stump! Twelve o'clock! Twenty yards!"" Molly hardly had time to get the words out. They jerked the boat to the left and flew past the stump.

"ap 02:00"|"Two o'clock"|"And on they went in the blinding rain, flying past a newly created shoreline, staying even with the massive log that turned and tumbled alongside them. Suddenly Molly saw the low spot and cried, ""Land! Two o'clock, twenty yards!"" They drove in sharply to shore. The boat dragged on something hidden in the muddy water and the front half swung out toward the river. It rocked violently and water sloshed in over the side. Lewis and Ben quickly jumped out and, with the brown water swirling about their chests, waded toward shore, dragging the boat in after them. The boat grated over mud and stones, and now the others jumped into the water and dragged the boat higher until it was beached, tilted, but for the moment safe. Molly lay in the mud panting until Lewis said, ""We've got to get it higher. The river's rising fast."""|"Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang"|"Kate Wilhelm"
"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"They came before noon, spent an hour looking around the house and yard, then left. Probably it would be safe now to return to the house, she thought, but she did not stir from her hole in the hill. They returned shortly before dark, and spent more time going over the same ground they had covered before. Now she knew it was safe to go to the house. They never went out after dark, except in groups; they would not expect her to wander about in the dark alone. She stood up, easing the stiffness out of her legs and back. The ground was damp, and this spot was cool, sheltered from the sun."|"Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang"|"Kate Wilhelm"
12:00|noon|"Bruce shrugged. ""Not in one hour or two,"" he said. ""At noon they'll eat, turn around, and come back."""|"Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang"|"Kate Wilhelm"
12:00|noon|"The sky was deep blue with puffs of white clouds and a very high band of cirrus clouds with no apparent beginning or end. It would be noon in less than two hours."|"Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang"|"Kate Wilhelm"
12:00|noon|"Anthony sat down, but the intent look didn't leave his face. The next morning they headed west again. By noon they were among hills, and now they knew that as soon as they got high enough to see over the trees they would be able to see the snow, if there was any snow to see."|"Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang"|"Kate Wilhelm"
