17:00|"five this evening"|"“Before you go any further,” said Bérard, holding up his fleshy hand, “I have some bad news. The dyers have called for a strike to begin tomorrow. The syndicate chiefs met the employers’ representatives at five this evening and that is their decision.”"|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
"ap < 11:00"|"toward eleven o’clock"|"The five of them set out toward eleven o’clock, with Marguérite, the maid, helping Stephen and Madame Azaire to carry the various baskets of food, parasols, rugs, and extra clothes that had been deemed necessary. It was only a short walk to the edge of the water gardens. They went down a flight of steps to the landing stage, where Bérard was waiting in a straw hat. Madame Bérard was already installed in the stern of a flat-bottomed boat that was shaped, after long local tradition, like a punt with a raised and squared-off end."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"Madame Azaire’s voice was audible from her place in the dining room, where she remained until eleven o’clock, either talking to Lisette or giving instructions to the various people who called on her. Among these was Madame Bonnet, wife of the elderly man in the factory, who came each day to do the cleaning Marguérite considered too menial or too strenuous. Madame Azaire would tell her which rooms were to be done and if there were special preparations to be made for guests. The old woman’s heavy, rolling step could be heard as she trundled to her prescribed task. Lisette sat in the sunlight that splashed into the room beneath the spokes of clematis at the window, watching the shadows on the polished table, listening to the way her stepmother ran the household. She enjoyed this shared morning routine; it made her feel trusted and important, and it had the further advantage of excluding Grégoire, with his uncouth behaviour and his childish remarks that, even at their most despicable and banal, sometimes threatened her precarious adult poise."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
"> 12:00"|"Shortly after midday"|"Shortly after midday Madame Azaire asked Stephen if he would be taking lunch with her and Lisette. Grégoire would still be at school, she said. Stephen accepted and spent the next hour working through the papers that had been sent from Azaire’s office."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
"ap > 01:00"|"a little after one o’clock"|"Madame Azaire returned a little after one o’clock to tell him lunch was ready. Three places had been set at the end of the table, by the window. The room looked quite different from the place of formal shadows with stiff-collared guests in the lowered evening lights that Stephen had seen at dinner. Lisette wore the little white dress her stepmother had forbidden on their visit to the water gardens. Her dark brown hair was tied back with a blue ribbon and her legs were bare. She was a good-looking girl, Stephen thought, as she looked up at him from under thick lashes; but he registered her looks quite dispassionately because his thoughts were elsewhere."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
17:00|"five in the afternoon"|"They had left the red room at five in the afternoon and she had not spoken to him since. She had no way of telling what had passed through his mind. Perhaps he was already regretting what had happened; perhaps he had done what he wanted to do and now the matter was finished for him."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"By one o’clock no one had caught anything. The river’s surface had been undisturbed by fish of any kind, though they could just make out the figure of a small boy some way down the opposite bank whose homemade float seemed barely to touch the water before the line was whisked in again with a flashing, heavy creature on the end. They walked back to the station and took a pony and trap up the hill to the village of Auchonvillers, which had been recommended by Bérard as having a passable restaurant. He had not been to it himself but had been told it was well known in the district."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
12:00|midday|"Stephen walked through the streets of the almost-deserted town. The fountain in the square around which people gathered in summer played coldly into its stone basin. The loose shutters on the houses were blown violently back against the buildings by the autumnal wind that was rolling in from the south. Stephen did not mind the feeling of loneliness, nor the tedium that awaited him in his work. He had found a job as an assistant to a furniture maker. He did the preliminary sawing and planing, and was occasionally allowed to do some of the more skilled work in design and carving. At midday he and the other four men employed in the business would go to a bar and smoke and drink pastis. Although he could see they thought him curious and he tried not to outstay his welcome, he was grateful to them for accepting him into their company."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
12:00|noon|"One Saturday at noon she went to meet him after he had finished work, and they went for a walk in the town. They stopped briefly at a café so he could eat after his morning’s exertion, then carried on past the town hall and out along a narrow street of shops toward the outskirts of the place. Their breath left thinning trails behind them as they climbed a slight gradient leading out of town. They arrived in a square, which was the last before the street became a road and vanished into the grey-and-purple countryside."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
12:00|midday|"In the days that followed, he returned to work. He arrived on time in the morning and exchanged pleasantries with the other men. He swore and spat at the snagging teeth of the saw as the blade caught in the grainy timber. He rolled off the long curls beneath his plane. He sanded with three grades of paper, feeling the surface of the finished wood beneath the soft skin of his fingers. He felt the sweet taste of aniseed on his tongue at midday and watched the viscous liquid cloud over in the glass as he poured in water. He talked and told jokes with the men and showed no sign that anything had changed."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"“Shaw, you’re needed in the tunnel,” he said. “I know you were in this morning, but they need help to clear the debris. You’d better report for duty, too, Tyson.”
“I’m on sentry duty at ten, sir.”
“Firebrace will have to do it for you. Come on, move yourselves. Sergeant Adams is in charge of the working party. Go and report to him.”"|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
12:00|midday|"With the mail had come rations. There were some tins of stew and bully beef that were held over to midday, but there was bread and jam to go with half a mug of tea. Hungry from his work underground, Jack ate quickly at an improvised station at the head of the communication trench. Sometimes the men who brought the rations had unreliable news of troop movements and plans from behind the lines; today there was no word. Jack ate in silence before returning to his position."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
"ap 06:00"|six|"“You were asleep on duty. It’s a court-martial offence. See me tomorrow at six. Your sergeant will bring you. You know the punishment.”"|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
06:00|"six this morning"|"“Who are you?” He was addressed by a lieutenant, who was one of two officers sitting at the table. The other was Jack’s own company commander, Captain Weir, on a visit to the infantry.
“Firebrace, sir. You told me to report to you at six this morning.”
“Why?”"|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
"ap < 06:00"|"nearly six"|"Riley appeared from the back of the dugout. “It’s nearly six, sir. Stand-to in ten minutes.”"|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"They collected their pay in five-franc notes in the evening and looked for ways of spending it. Since he had been cast as the joker in their section, Jack Firebrace was also regarded as the man who should be in charge of entertainments. Newly shaved, with combed hair and cap badges polished, Tyson, Shaw, Evans, and O’Lone presented themselves to him. “I want you back by nine o’clock, and sober,” said Sergeant Adams as they swung out through the gates of the farm. “Will you settle for half-past?” called out Evans."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
00:00|midnight|"Sleep took them all by midnight, when Tyson extinguished his last cigarette in the straw. In the loud noise of snoring they forgot what was unforgivable. Jack noticed how men like Wheeler and Jones treated each day as though it were a shift at work and talked to one another in the evening in the nagging, joking way they would have done at home. Perhaps, in some way he did not understand, that was what the two officers had been doing; perhaps all that talk about life-drawing was just a way of pretending everything was normal. As he began to drift toward sleep, he concentrated hard on the thought of his home; he tried to imagine the sound of Margaret’s voice and what she would say to him. The health of his son became more important than the lives of the company. No one had even raised a glass to Turner in the estaminet; no one remembered him or the three others who had been taken with him."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
"ap 05:00"|five|"Stephen talked briefly to Harrington, the lieutenant who also shared Gray’s dugout, then drank the tea Riley produced promptly at five. He went out to look at the late afternoon light. It had begun to rain again, but the shells kept coming along the blackened skyline, their flares like unexpected stars, in the grey-green, turbulent darkness."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
"< 00:00"|"Toward midnight"|"Toward midnight Weir came to the dugout. He had run out of whisky and wanted some of Stephen’s. He waited till Gray had gone out."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"He did not wake until seven the following morning. He looked in amazement at his watch. He had slept for twelve hours, unmoving, still in his uniform. No one had called him for dinner; he had heard no movement in the big house."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"It was Jack who, in addition to giving Evans five cigarettes, was required to escort the men down into the tunnel. They took gas masks and attached grenades to their belts. At ten o’clock they went to the tunnel head."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"Rations came up at ten o’clock. Byrne tried to force some rum between Stephen’s lips, but they would not open. In the bombardment, priority was given to repairing defences and to moving the wounded who could walk. Stephen lay for a day in the niche dug for him by Byrne until a stretcher-bearer finally got him out to a forward dressing station."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
"ap ~ 08:00"|"about eight o’clock"|"Michael Weir had detailed Adams to be in charge while he spent the evening in his dugout with a book. At about eight o’clock Stephen pulled back the gas curtain and let himself in. He was in a state of nervous excitement."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
12:00|midday|"“Oh yes,” beamed the colonel. “Over at dawn, don’t worry. Regroup and take a breather at midday. Back in the early evening to put the shoulder to the wheel if necessary. Your men ready for it?”"|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
"ap > 03:00"|"past three o’clock"|"A thin stew followed, then ripe cheese and fresh bread. Lunch went on past three o’clock, when they went to the sun-filled sitting room with coffee and cigars."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
"ap < 04:00"|"Toward four"|"Toward four, the lowest time of the night, there was a mortal quiet along the line. No one spoke. There was for once no sound of birds."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
"ap 07:30"|seven-thirty|"Gray, urgent, sour-breathed at the head of the communication trench. “The attack will be at seven-thirty.”"|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
"ap 07:15"|Seven-fifteen|"The noise overhead began to intensify. Seven-fifteen. They were almost there. Stephen on his knees, some men taking photographs from their pockets, kissing the faces of their wives and children. Hunt telling foul jokes, Petrossian clasping a silver cross."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
"ap 07:20"|"twenty past seven"|"Their own contribution to the day, the vast hole that had been blown at twenty past seven, had given the enemy ten minutes in which to take their positions at leisure. By the crater they saw young men dying in quantities that they had not dreamed possible. They had not fired a shot."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
12:00|noon|"It was noon and the sun was very hot above him. No clouds swathed it, no breeze cooled him. The noise had not diminished. He became aware of an acute exhaustion. He wanted to sleep. He reached down for his water bottles, but both were gone."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
12:00|noon|"Close to collapse, he staggered downhill toward the river, to the drink he had craved since noon. He left his rifle on the bank and stumbled down into the water. He dropped his head beneath the sluggish flow and felt it rush down into the pores of his skin. He opened his mouth like a fish."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"It was one o’clock when she let herself into the flat. As she turned on the light in the sitting room she saw her still-packed suitcase. She went into the kitchen to make some tea but found she had forgotten to buy any milk on her way back from the Underground. By the sink were her breakfast cup and plate from two days ago, when she had left in a hurry to get to the airport."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
"ap 08:30"|"half-past eight"|"Elizabeth straightened her hair in the mirror. She was wearing a suede skirt, leather boots, and a black cashmere sweater. She pushed the thick dark hair back a little from her ears and turned her head sideways to insert two costume earrings the color of oxblood. There was light mascara on her lashes; the paleness of her skin made her look less Gallic than Lindsay had been suggesting, but there was nevertheless something dramatic in her face that further makeup would have overstated. In any case, it was only Monday morning, time for the late walk to the Lancaster Gate Underground, her mouth still burning from the too-hasty coffee she had bolted as the radio told her it had turned half-past eight."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
"ap 00:00"|twelve|"“Of course, of course. Since eight-thirty. We’ve a big buyer coming at twelve, I told you.”"|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
00:00|midnight|"It was midnight when she finally rang for a taxi. She went downstairs happily humming the tune he had played. On the way home she had treacherous thoughts about Robert. She always told him that he made her unhappy by not leaving Jane; she promised him he would be happier with her. As far as she knew she was passionately sincere in all her protestations. However, she conceded, as the taxi crossed the Edgware Road, it was just possible that she had chosen someone unobtainable for that very reason: that he did not threaten her independence."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"Afterward he played cards with his parents in the sitting room until ten o’clock, when his mother said it was time for her to go to bed."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"Stephen breathed in deeply. He let his hands fall to his sides. “Go and look after your men,” he said softly. “It’s three o’clock. Go and talk to the sentries. You know how frightened they’ll be.”"|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"They walked up toward the cathedral. Some of the buildings bore the marks of shellfire. Only a few miles behind allied lines, Amiens had suffered according to the tide of the war. The recent allied advances had made it safe for the first time: there were no bombardments, and the local businessmen were trying to profit from the new calm in the Somme region. Shops were reopening; the eight o’clock curfew on bars and restaurants was lifted."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"“I’ll meet you in the same bar at nine o’clock tomorrow evening. Now I must get back.”"|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"At seven o’clock he ate fried eggs and bread in a café, with a bowl of coffee. He washed and shaved in a small room at the back indicated by the owner. He was so used to not sleeping that he felt no ill effects from the night. Perhaps he could find a place where they were showing a film; if not, he would buy a book and read it in the gardens by the cathedral."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
"ap 00:30"|"Half of one"|"He was thinking of a man whose face had been opened up by a bullet, a mere rifle shot. A neat triangle was made, with its apex in the middle of his forehead and the two lower corners on the midpoint of each jawline. Half of one eye remained, but there were no other features left except for some teeth buried at an angle; the rest of the face was flesh turned inside out. The man was conscious and awake; he could hear and follow instructions given to him by the medical officer. Compared to his wound, Isabelle’s was discreet."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
"~ 16:30"|evensong|"Ellis lit a cigarette. “It’s like that time of day on Sunday when you expect to hear the first bells of evensong,” he said. “I’d give anything not to have to go back.”"|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
"ap 08:30"|8:30|"The estaminet had to shut at 8:30, when the military police would come to make sure there were no men left there. With twenty minutes to go, the speed of drinking increased. Evans began to sing, and Jones, whose Welsh forebears had gone to London many generations earlier, found enough Celtic memory to support him. Then they put up Jack Firebrace to do his music hall turn."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
"ap 00:00"|"twelve o’clock"|"“I don’t know, Ellis. There’s something about you that makes me quite unsure. Get your working party ready for twelve o’clock. I’ll see you in the next firebay.”"|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
12:00|noon|"At noon on the firestep in gas masks. Taste of death, smell of it, thought Stephen. Coker slashed sandbags into gloves. “Wear these.” Firebrace and Fielding of the miners, Ellis, white like milk, Barlow, Bates, Goddard, Allen of the infantry; Weir taking rum on top of whisky, unsteady on the step of the ladder."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
12:00|midday|"There was a train to King’s Lynn at midday. He had time to go to a barber and have a haircut and shave before he bought a ticket and wandered up the platform. He climbed into a half-empty train and found a seat at leisure. The upholstery of the Great Eastern Railway was plush and clean. He sank into a corner seat and took out a book. The train jerked and clanked its way slowly out of the station, then began to gather speed as it left the low, grimed terraces of northeast London behind."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
00:00|midnight|"Weir came to his dugout at midnight. His eyes were wild and his hair disarrayed. Stephen felt dismayed at the sight. He did not want to catch the other man’s fear. He did not want him to breathe over him."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
12:00|midday|"“We’ll get support at midday from that wood on the right, from what Gray calls our Black Country friends. We have to secure the canal end, then press on to the second trench.”"|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
12:00|noon|"By late morning they had secured the support trench. Stephen sent a detachment down to the canal to dig in against counterattack. All they had to do now was hold the line until reinforcements arrived at noon to protect their other flank."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
12:00|noon|"He became aware of a concertina movement coming down the trench from the right as the furthest firebays were either being evacuated or merely silenced. At noon he climbed a ladder on what had been the parapet and looked up to the wood for reinforcements. There was no one there. He jumped down into the trench and found a periscope. He looked back over no-man’s-land and could see nothing except a distant line of prisoners being taken back. He closed his eyes and sighed quietly in the storm of fire. He might have known. He could have guessed."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
"ap < 03:00"|"Just before three o’clock"|"Just before three o’clock he was aware of a Yorkshire voice in his ear and an unfamiliar face. He looked with puzzlement into the man’s eyes. It was a lieutenant from the Duke of Wellington’s regiment. He shouted to Stephen that his men had regained control of the far end of the trench."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
"> 03:00"|"after three in the morning"|"He lay on the bed, dry-eyed. Soon after three in the morning the mines went up and shook the bed where he lay. “The explosion will be felt in London,” Weir had boasted."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"The telephone rang, and Stephen went back to the chair at the desk. Throughout the small hours of the morning he relayed messages. By nine o’clock the Second Army was on the ridge. Elation edged the voices he spoke to: something, at last, had gone right. The mines had been colossal and the infantry, using methods copied from the Canadians, had stormed through. Celebration seeped into the wires."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
12:00|noon|"Stephen was relieved at noon. He lay down on the bed and tried to sleep. He could hear the unrelenting bombardment continue on the German lines. He cursed his fortune that he could not go in behind it. Now, to answer Gray’s hypothetical question, now he would have taken life without compunction. He envied the men who could fire down on to the hopeless enemy, men with a chance to sink bayonets into unguarded flesh, men with the opportunity to pour machine-gun bullets into those who had killed his friend. Now he would have gone killing with a light heart."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"Lallement wiped his mouth finally on his napkin and suggested they go to a bar that a friend had told him about near the main square. They stayed till ten o’clock, when Stephen was dispatched to find the driver of Stanforth’s car. He found him asleep on the back seat. By the time they said good-bye to the French it had started to rain. Stephen looked back at Lallement and Hartmann standing together beneath the dripping colonnade."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"

"ap 10:00"|ten|"Elizabeth brought her mind back to the notebooks. She curled up in her dressing gown on the sofa and opened the first one. It had a date, 1915, inside the front cover. They were all dated, she discovered, from 1915 to 1917. The one she had given Bob had been from 1918, she thought. In some of them were lines of English. “Arrived back at Coy HQ at ten. Still no word from Gray abt attack.” Elizabeth felt a leap of excitement at the sight of the word “Gray.” Again she had touched the past. It had stopped being history and had turned into experience."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"

She was too sleepy to break the news gently, as she had intended. “I won’t tell anyone who the father is. These things can be kept secret,” she said."|Birdsong|"Sebastian Faulks"
12:00|midday|"“All right,” said Stephen. “I’ll come and inspect it, but I can’t be away for more than an hour. One of your men will have to bring me back.”
