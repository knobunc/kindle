"~ 20:00"|"around 2000"|"Nor can this success be dismissed as a one-off. Germany’s program mirrors one implemented in Denmark in the 1970s and 1980s, which helped switch more than 40 percent of the country’s electricity consumption to renewables, mostly wind. Up to around 2000, roughly 85 percent of Danish wind turbines were owned by small players like farmers and co-ops. Though large offshore wind operators have entered the market in recent years, this remains a striking commonality between Denmark and Germany: it’s neither big nationally owned monopolies nor large corporate-owned wind and solar operators that have the best track record for spurring renewable energy turnarounds—it’s communities, co-ops, and farmers, working within the context of an ambitious, well-designed national framework. Though often derided as the impractical fantasy of small-is-beautiful dreamers, decentralization delivers, and not on a small scale but on the largest scale of any model attempted thus far, and in highly developed postindustrial nations."|"This Changes Everything"|"Naomi Klein"
00:00|midnight|"In a 2007 cable about Nauru, made public by WikiLeaks, an unnamed U.S. official summed up his government’s analysis of what went wrong on the island: “Nauru simply spent extravagantly, never worrying about tomorrow.” Fair enough, but that diagnosis is hardly unique to Nauru; our entire culture is extravagantly drawing down finite resources, never worrying about tomorrow. For a couple of hundred years we have been telling ourselves that we can dig the midnight black remains of other life forms out of the bowels of the earth, burn them in massive quantities, and that the airborne particles and gases released into the atmosphere—because we can’t see them—will have no effect whatsoever. Or if they do, we humans, brilliant as we are, will just invent our way out of whatever mess we have made."|"This Changes Everything"|"Naomi Klein"

Nobody is going to start it from the grassroots.”—Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, 2013In his autobiography/New Age business manifesto Screw It, Let’s Do It, Richard Branson, the flamboyant founder of Virgin Group, shared the inside story of what he describes as his “Road to Damascus” conversion to the fight against climate change. It was 2006 and Al Gore, on tour with An Inconvenient Truth, came to the billionaire’s home to impress upon him the dangers of global warming, and to try to convince Branson to use Virgin Airlines as a catalyst for change."|"This Changes Everything"|"Naomi Klein"

The discrepancy is evident in actual measurements of these pollutants in the air near tar sands activities. The study’s coauthor, Frank Wania, an environmental scientist at the University of Toronto, described the official estimates as “inadequate and incomplete” and made the commonsense observation, “Only with a complete and accurate account of the emissions is it actually possible to make a meaningful assessment of the environmental impact and of the risk to human health.”"|"This Changes Everything"|"Naomi Klein"

Al Lameman had aged considerably in recent years and slipped in and out of the conversation. Anderson, almost painfully shy, had also struggled with her health. The spot where the family met for this gathering was where she spent the summer months: a small trailer in a clearing in the woods, without running water or electricity, entirely off the grid."|"This Changes Everything"|"Naomi Klein"
