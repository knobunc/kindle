"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"When the cathedral bells rang five o’clock and school let out, the streets of Abalia were still lively with mice. Squeaks filled the air and echoed off the buildings, along with the shouts and curses of hundreds of human mouse hunters. Official sorts of men dashed hither and thither: vergers, prebendaries, rectors, prelates, and sextons from the cathedral, marshals-of-the-peace from the Provost’s office, pudding-faced inquisitors from the fearful chambers of the Morals Proctor, black-hooded torturers and scrofulous gaolers from the Houses of Correction. All had been pressed into service in the campaign against the mice."|Half-Witch|"John Schoffstall"
05:00|Lauds|"She arrived at the Cathedral of St. Dessicata as the bells in the tower began ringing for Lauds. The first cocks were crowing in the distance. Lizbet crept in and found an empty confessional. “Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned,” she said to the hooded priest behind the screen."|Half-Witch|"John Schoffstall"
12:00|noon|"“Sit there,” the man said. He pointed to a row of benches against the wall, where a dozen anxious-looking commoners huddled together. “Wait your turn. The Margrave will be seeing petitioners and complainants at noon, or after.”"|Half-Witch|"John Schoffstall"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"She gobbled a breakfast of cheese and stale bread, and left by the house’s back door as the cathedral bells were tolling eight o’clock. She didn’t know what time the Magisters of Children were coming back, but she guessed they’d show up at the front door, and she didn’t want to run into them."|Half-Witch|"John Schoffstall"
"~ 09:00"|Terce|"Lizbet went directly to the Cathedral of St. Dessicata. You were supposed to fast before receiving the host. She hadn’t fasted. You were supposed to go to confession. But Lizbet had too much to confess, and didn’t have time. God would just have to put up with it. The short mid-morning service called Terce was in progress as she entered. She sat through two psalms, clicking the toes of her boots together with impatience and anxiety. When the priest invited the churchgoers to take the sacrament, Lizbet trooped down the aisle with a handful of others."|Half-Witch|"John Schoffstall"
"~ 12:00"|"Around noontime"|"Around noontime Lizbet stopped to rest. She was exhausted. No sooner had she sat down than the urge to sleep came over her, and she had to fight to stay awake in the hazy light of the forest and the turpentine smell of the conifers. She had meant to hoard the little food she had, but found she was ravenously hungry. She quickly finished the rest of the meat and bread, and she was still hungry."|Half-Witch|"John Schoffstall"
12:00|midday|"On either side, the crests of the Montagnes stretched to the north and south horizons, an archipelago of granite islands jutting through clouds that concealed the world below. Steep mountainside fell away to the east and west. Above, the sky was black as night, the sun hot and almost white. Strangely for midday, the stars were out."|Half-Witch|"John Schoffstall"
12:00|midday|"“It’s the heat of the midday sun,” Toadwipe said. “It addles the brains. I hardly know what I’m saying. I fear my health may be in danger. Free me now, so that I may seek respite in the shade. Oh, the fierceness of the sun!”"|Half-Witch|"John Schoffstall"
"> 12:00"|"a little past noon"|"It was a little past noon. The sun was high and bright. The surrounding stone buildings radiated heat. “Strix,” Lizbet said, “I want to let Toadwipe go.”"|Half-Witch|"John Schoffstall"
00:00|midnight|"The Pope of Storms’ voice whistled, whispered, boomed, and howled. It was the midnight wind hissing across the grass. It was the tempest roaring through the oaks. Lizbet felt a sense of helplessness and futility when she spoke. As if she were pleading with the wind."|Half-Witch|"John Schoffstall"
00:00|midnight|"For hours, Lizbet and Strix dreamed up plan after plan for escape. For hours, they discarded every one as unworkable, impractical, or madly dangerous. By midnight, their ideas spent and the wells of inspiration dry, they still had no clear idea how they might escape. Strix, with her usual insouciance in the face of impending catastrophe, gave up and threw herself into a hammock, and soon was fast asleep."|Half-Witch|"John Schoffstall"
"> 12:00"|"after midday"|"Sometime after midday, she spotted something colorful wedged in the branches of a bush that had been snapped by the wind. When she freed it, it proved to be a vessel of exquisite workmanship. It was the size of Lizbet’s fist. It was crafted of hedgehog quills, nettles, broken brown bottle glass, and black briar root. In it were strings and gobbets of stuff: red, green, yellow, blue, all moving and twisting restlessly. Vices and virtues of the sort Strix had harvested from the Outlaw."|Half-Witch|"John Schoffstall"
12:00|midday|"Untangling herself from Lizbet’s arms, and dropping to one knee, Strix yanked down Lizbet’s stockings and lifted up her skirt. Lizbet’s birchbark skin shone white in the midday sun. Strix said, “What part of this looks like a mortal to you?”"|Half-Witch|"John Schoffstall"
"< 12:00"|"nearly noon"|"Lizbet shook her head. “It’s nearly noon. Everyone should be on the street. Goodwives, servants, carriers, beggars.” She looked around. In a dark window, she thought she saw the flash of a pale face. She ran up the steps to that house and rapped on the door."|Half-Witch|"John Schoffstall"
