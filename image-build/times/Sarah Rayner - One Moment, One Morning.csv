She always finds it fascinating, watching other women do this, constructing themselves, on the train. Lou never wears make-up, really, other than for very special occasions, and although she can understand it saves time, she finds it odd – choosing to make the transformation from private to public persona whilst commuting. It takes away the mystery, covering the blemishes, thickening the lashes, widening the eyes, plumping the cheeks, surrounded by people. And on the seven forty-four to Victoria, Lou is surrounded by people: most of them silent; many of them asleep, or at least dozing; some of them reading, and a few, a minority, chatting."|"One Moment, One Morning"|"Sarah Rayner"

"ap 07:44"|"seven forty-four"|"I wonder, she muses, as they pull off the M23 and onto the dual carriageway into the drab outskirts of Coulsdon, whether we’ll ever see each other after today? She’s used to journeying up to London on her own in the morning, using the space to gather her thoughts. Still, it would be nice to have someone to chat to from time to time, when she is in the mood. Maybe, if Anna is on the seven forty-four as often as she says she is, they will see each other on board. That said, it is a long train and always packed with people. Being on it at the same time is no guarantee their paths will cross again."|"One Moment, One Morning"|"Sarah Rayner"

They’ll understand, and if they don’t, well, sod it. So, I dunno . . . wait there. I’ll be—’ She checks her watch. It’s five to ten. ‘I think the trains go at twelve minutes past the hour.

To her left the city sprawls up and over the Downs, row upon row of terraced houses getting smaller into the distance. The sign at the end of the carriage is scrolling in orange dots: The next station is Brighton. Although she is nearly there, she feels completely disoriented, emotions all over the place. She has travelled from Brighton to Wivelsfield to Clapham up the motorway and back, and it’s only eleven. She feels as if she has left pieces of her mind scattered along the way and is no longer herself as a result."|"One Moment, One Morning"|"Sarah Rayner"

She even rings on the landline so Lou can’t vet the call. It might, after all, be one of the other members of staff, who also know she has this time free, so Lou is obligated to answer. Lou really hates this habit of her mother’s, as she needs the space to clear her head, and her mother’s calls tend to be all-consuming, even three-minute ones. Her mother talks fast, and – it seems to Lou – manages to squeeze more neurosis into one hundred and eighty seconds than any other human being she has ever encountered. Today Lou’s head is especially full as she is still trying to process the experience on the seven forty-four. Right now though, there’s a fat chance."|"One Moment, One Morning"|"Sarah Rayner"

In the few months that she has been at the school, she has tried to make the space her own, or the students’ own, to be precise. Many of her clients find it hard to sit and focus one-to-one, so she has various toys and accessories for them to play with as they talk. Against the wall leans a giant bamboo filled with beans; a rain-stick – one boy seems to find it easier to confide with its gentle patter as a backdrop, and will repeatedly pick it up during their sessions and turn it to and fro. In the corner is a large plastic box of Play-Doh; several of the younger students – they start at eleven – seem better able to relax if they can twist and pull and thump it with their hands as they talk. There are a number of posters on the wall: printouts from the net she thought interesting, abstract patterns she hopes are restful on the eye, a ‘twentieth-century wonders of the world’ illustration that came with one of the Sunday papers. Last but not least, there is a giant pop-art print she has had framed over the sofa."|"One Moment, One Morning"|"Sarah Rayner"

It’s a few minutes’ walk to the Tube, and as she makes her way there, she spies Aaron and Kyra sitting on a wall outside the newsagent. It is impossible to avoid them; they will see if she turns back to take another route. So she carries on walking. As she approaches she can see they are smoking; her immediate fear is that it is weed, as Aaron smokes far too much of it, so she is actually relieved to see the brown filter ends of cigarettes. They are not supposed to smoke tobacco either, being underage, but Lou considers it the lesser of two evils. She is just wondering whether she should involve herself in a situation she can’t be sure won’t escalate, when they see her coming and rapidly stub the cigarettes out on the wall beside them, leaving black charcoal smears on the red brick. Given that they are out of school and she doesn’t like to come across as too authoritarian, it’s best to ignore it, she decides."|"One Moment, One Morning"|"Sarah Rayner"
"< 00:00"|"nearly midnight"|"It is nearly midnight. The lights are off, the curtains drawn, the alarm set. Anna lies snug under the duvet, conscious of Steve’s body wrapped in a large curl around hers.

Steve drifts off at once, but tonight her mind is still churning."|"One Moment, One Morning"|"Sarah Rayner"

Yet she can see light beginning to creep through the gap in the curtains, gulls are screeching and there is a scuttling downstairs. It’s Toby – though Luke would like it otherwise, he sleeps in the kitchen – and he will want breakfast, and so, soon, will the children. She could lie here forever, but she has to get up. Then she can start to do things. There are arrangements to be made, people to be told, decisions to be made about the house purchase. And first thing this morning there’s to be a post-mortem. The hospital has to do one as a matter of course, to establish the cause of death, officially. She is not sure what good it will do, and the idea of slicing open her beloved Simon . . ."|"One Moment, One Morning"|"Sarah Rayner"
"~ 03:00"|"around 3 a.m."|"Anna’s alarm goes off; she wakes with a lurch. She had finally fallen asleep around 3 a.m.; now she is launched straight into the world by the radio, tuned permanently to Radio 4. Even though Steve would prefer music, it is a battle Anna has won, arguing that she is the one who has to be up and out first. Anyway, Anna has the final say, although she has never had to articulate it: this is her house – Steve contributes to the mortgage, with sporadic payments of rent or else in DIY, but she is the one whose name is on the deeds. Anna is specific – even truculent – about her tastes. She doesn’t like music first thing, she can’t be doing with DJs. She finds their determined perkiness too much; it often clashes with her mood. Moreover, she finds music – pop songs especially – too loose, too vague. They leave her hanging, emotionally unsettled, and she doesn’t like that, not first thing, at any rate. Under normal circumstances she finds there is something about the spoken voice and news – however grim – that places her in reality, somewhere specific in time. It gives her a sense of stability, grounds her."|"One Moment, One Morning"|"Sarah Rayner"

"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"So the half of Karen’s mind that was functioning normally put the children in the back of the car, did up the seat belts and drove them at a careful thirty miles an hour to Portslade. They were there, as arranged, at nine o’clock exactly. Karen then drove herself back, locked the car and put the kettle on. It is coming to the boil any second."|"One Moment, One Morning"|"Sarah Rayner"

"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"They stop off at a Greek supermarket and run in to buy food and wine. In the cold light of day it is a grotty little shop, but this isn’t the cold light of day, it is a magical July evening; the world is bathed in the warm peachy glow of seven o’clock sunlight, and everything, everyone, looks stunning, including this funny, down-at-heel grocery store. Inside, it is as if a haven of seductive delicacies is offering itself up to them. So what would normally seem a fairly conventional selection of staple foods and cheap alcohol becomes a cornucopia of delights – hummus, taramasalata, olives, stuffed vine leaves, pitta bread – and they are utterly spoilt for choice. It will all, inevitably, taste delicious. Rapidly, they fill a basket, add a bottle of wine – they are agreed, it should be bubbly, chilled, and why not rosé? It seems to reflect the mood of the evening – heady yet light, harmless. Hardly the choice of immoral wrongdoers, surely: more that of two people enjoying the moment, caught up in such a forceful and unstoppable attraction that any implications their actions might have are pushed light years away."|"One Moment, One Morning"|"Sarah Rayner"

"ap 02:00"|"Two o’clock"|"‘I never said that.’ Lou’s response is clipped. She feels guilty, however: did she, maybe? She’s fairly sure not, but such a lot has happened in the last few days, she can’t be certain. ‘I thought I said I’d head to you on Saturday morning—’
‘Two o’clock is hardly morning, darling.’
Grrr! It’s a perfect example of her mother’s manipulation: ‘darling’ used to conjure up a sense of daughterly responsibility, not a term of endearment at all. Lou mutters, ‘I meant I was leaving in the morning, not that I’d be there then.’"|"One Moment, One Morning"|"Sarah Rayner"
12:00|midday|"‘Hm,’ says her mother. Lou can sense her calculating journey times – can almost hear the unspoken question down the line: what on earth is my daughter doing till midday? – not to mention the accompanying disapproval."|"One Moment, One Morning"|"Sarah Rayner"
"ap 10:30"|10.30|"She takes a moment to re-read it. Even at this hour, the professional writer in her won’t permit a reprieve. She presses the backspace several times, deletes ‘my stupid boyfriend’ and amends it to ‘me’. In so doing she is absolving Steve, but she also figures that it’s unreasonable to dump her frustration on Lou at 10.30 on a Friday night. She presses ‘Send’, drums her fingertips on the countertop. She wishes she could speak to Lou right now, but the odds of her having her phone switched on, or hearing it if she does, are negligible. For the time being Anna must wait, contained."|"One Moment, One Morning"|"Sarah Rayner"
"< 00:00"|"nearly midnight"|"‘Hello, darling, it’s Mum.’ The familiar voice takes her by surprise. It is late for her mother to be calling. She and Karen’s father live in the Algarve, where they are an hour ahead; it must be nearly midnight there. ‘I’d just thought I’d let you know I’ll be arriving at Gatwick at nine tomorrow morning, so I should be with you by eleven or so,’ she says. ‘I’ve managed to find someone to look after your father for a few days too, so I can stay until Tuesday, at least, or if he seems to be doing OK without me, Wednesday or Thursday.’"|"One Moment, One Morning"|"Sarah Rayner"
