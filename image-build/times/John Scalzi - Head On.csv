She was represented by a relatively rudimentary avatar. She looked like herself but in a lazy, computer-animation-from-the-turn-of-the-century way. Tony was also there, looking like himself. It was past midnight by this point. “That said, her fear at this point is entirely reasonable.”"|"Head On"|"John Scalzi"
"ap 00:30"|"twelve thirty"|"“Fine.” Vann looked up at the clock on the conference room wall. “It’s twelve thirty. Shane and I have an interview up in Trenton. That’s going to take a couple of hours. Let’s meet at the town house at four thirty. Then you can take us in.”"|"Head On"|"John Scalzi"

00:00|midnight|"“I’m not going to meet them in an isolated parking lot at midnight, for Christ’s sake,” Ramsey said. “I may not be a great FBI agent but I’m not entirely stupid. We’ll make the exchange in broad daylight somewhere busy.”"|"Head On"|"John Scalzi"
"< 23:00"|"nearly eleven at night"|"“We’re here to see Amelie Parker,” I said, to the woman who answered the door.

"ap 09:13"|"nine thirteen"|"“Yes,” I said. “To be fair it’s nine thirteen on a Monday morning. We’ll probably get the warrants first. And I’ll check with the league as soon as we’re done here.”"|"Head On"|"John Scalzi"

“It’s noon,” I said.
“I’m a doctor at a hospital,” she said. “I have long shifts. I’m going to have another long shift real soon. You’re lucky you don’t keep your body at the house or I’d walk my threep over to your room and punch you.”"|"Head On"|"John Scalzi"
11:00|"eleven A.M."|"“I’ve talked to my legal team and with the Bays organization, and we’ve all decided that it’s best if I cooperate fully with you. Would you be available to meet with me tomorrow? At eleven A.M. at the Bays’ practice facility?”"|"Head On"|"John Scalzi"
