"> 12:00"|"past midday"|"The sky, with the sun no longer overhead but sending shadows now into the Field of Leaving from the trees and thorn bushes at its edge, told her that it was long past midday. In her uncertainty she had lingered here too long. Carefully she gathered the skins on which she had slept these four nights guarding her mother's spirit. Her fire was cold ashes, a blackened smudge. Her water container was empty and she had no more food."|"Gathering Blue"|"Lois Lowry"
12:00|midday|"A messenger, bored and scratching at an insect bite on his neck, came to Kira in the dawn and told her that she must report to the Council of Guardians at late morning. When the sun was approaching midday, she tidied herself and went, obedient to his instruction."|"Gathering Blue"|"Lois Lowry"
"< 12:00"|"near midday"|"Kira, reporting near midday as she had been ordered by the messenger, walked alone down a long hallway lit on either side by sputtering flames from tall sconces fed with oil. She could hear the voices of the meeting ahead, behind a closed door: men's voices in muted arguing. Her stick thumped on the wooden floor and the foot of her flawed leg brushed the boards with a sweeping sound, as if she dragged a broom."|"Gathering Blue"|"Lois Lowry"
"ap 04:00"|four|"""Kira,"" Jamison said, ""go and gather what you need. Whatever you want to bring with you. Be back here when the bell rings four times. And we will take you to your quarters, to the place where you will live from now on."""|"Gathering Blue"|"Lois Lowry"
"ap 04:00"|four|"Kira slapped at a mosquito on her arm. She rubbed at the little smear of blood from its bite. ""I don't know,"" she admitted. ""They told me to come back to the Edifice when the bell rings four. I'm to gather my things."" She laughed a little. ""I don't have much to gather. My things were mostly burned."""|"Gathering Blue"|"Lois Lowry"
12:00|midday|"Kira followed her. She knew the flower heads would have to boil till midday and then remain steeping in their water for many hours more. Extracting the colors was always a slow process. The coneflower dye-water would not be ready for use until the next morning."|"Gathering Blue"|"Lois Lowry"
12:00|midday|"It was midday. Kira pointed down to the area below the window, a small piece of land between the Edifice and the edge of the woods. Thomas came to the window and looked. Workers had raised a structure that Kira could see was to be a shed; under its roof, long poles from which to hang the wet yarns and threads to dry were already in place."|"Gathering Blue"|"Lois Lowry"
12:00|midday|"""Thomas, I've worked hard all morning, and you have too. Would you take a walk with me? There's something I want to see.""
It was midday. They had both eaten lunch.
""You want to go down and look at what the workmen are doing? I'll go with you."" Thomas set aside the carving tool he had just picked up. Kira noticed again, with admiration, how intricate the work was on the large Singer's staff. Thomas had been smoothing the tiny rough spots from the worn, ancient carvings and reshaping the infinitesimally small edges and curves. It was very similar to the work that Kira herself had been assigned, the repair of the Singer's robe. And the entire top of the staff was undecorated; it was smooth, uncarved wood, in the same way that the expanse across the shoulders of the robe was untouched cloth. Kira's work was approaching that unadorned expanse. So was Thomas's, she realized."|"Gathering Blue"|"Lois Lowry"
12:00|midday|"It was the midday interruption of the Gathering, a lengthy gap in the day for food and rest. The tender pondered Kira's question and agreed. Leaving by the side door through which they had entered, Kira and Thomas, accompanied by Jo, yawning, went up the stairs to Kira's room and waited for their food to be brought. On the plaza outside, the people would be eating the food they had brought with them and discussing the Song. They would be anticipating the next section, a time of warfare, conflict, and death. Kira remembered it: the bright splatters of blood in crimson threads. But she put it out of her mind now."|"Gathering Blue"|"Lois Lowry"
