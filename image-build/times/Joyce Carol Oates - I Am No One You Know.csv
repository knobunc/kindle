I saw my mother’s lips move wordlessly as sometimes in church, at mass, she knelt, shut her eyes, moved her lips as she said the rosary like an exhausted woman in a trance. Such public behavior embarrassed me now that I was a teenager. Everything about my mother embarrassed me. I hated her for her spreading hips and flaccid upper arms, the creases in her face, her scared shiny eyes. That night, seeing her praying as she stared at the TV screen, I was filled with raging contempt."|"I Am No One You Know"|"Joyce Carol Oates"

As if he’d forgotten his brother was married to her, a white woman. As if he’d forgotten her existence."|"I Am No One You Know"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
"> 04:00"|"past 4 A.M."|"She would prepare a meal for D. She would not object to him sleeping in the family room for how could she who was the wife of D.’s older brother, the mother of his beautiful children, object. Her husband was angry with D. and frightened for D. and bitter and protective, the brothers shut in together in the family room talking in subdued, rapid voices until past 4 A.M. while she cleaned up in the kitchen rinsing plates to set in the dishwasher, carefully wiping with a sponge the Formica-topped breakfast table where D. had ravenously eaten without a further glance at her, hunched over his plate, young-looking for twenty, scared. And afterward quietly slipping from the house, descending the grassy slope to the river; her breath quickened, shallow; her feet in open-toed sandals wet from the grass; sitting then at this undefined twilit hour of early morning on the lowermost, just slightly rotted wooden steps leading to the dock. (Their house was a handsome multi-level structure with numerous plate-glass windows, sliding doors, and decks, built at the top of an incline above a narrow, deep river; in a residential area of tall trees, two-acre lots, a rural-suburban neighborhood.) Staring at the dark water lapping against the dock, the pebbly shoreline. Thinking I am his wife, I love him. What his life is, it’s mine. Except when he came to her, she flinched at his footsteps above her, steeled herself against his voice though she knew it would be a voice of calm, of control. He said, quietly, “Come back to the house, he’ll think you don’t want him here.” She was shivering, she drew breath to reply yet could not, so he said, “Should I send him away?” and still she could not reply, seeing how across the river the treeline was dense as a single tarry substance, thickly smudged as with a trowel. Above the Mendocino mountains miles away heat lightning was pulsing forked and silent. “All right, then,” her husband said, “I’ll send him away,” and now she spoke, her voice hoarse, “No. You can’t do that,” and affably he said, “No. That’s right, I can’t,” not ironic, or not ironic in such a way she would be left with no choice but to register as ironic; for always at such moments, such was her husband’s subtlety, his kindness and tact, he would allow her a margin of not-knowing, not acknowledging; and she said, not wanting to sound as if she were begging, “I love you,” and he said, “But I could go away, if you’d like that,” and she said quickly, in pain, “No,” and he said, patiently, as if addressing a frightened or intimidated child, “Then come back to the house, now.” She was staring at the slow-lapping shadowed water that might have been not water at all but molten lead, waves of whatever minor and inconsequential river flowing to what destination she could not, in the exigency of the moment, have named; understanding how it might be dangerous in this man’s presence to seem not to have heard when in fact one had heard but she still could not speak, nor did she glance back as with an exhalation of breath and a muttered inaudible expletive her husband ascended the steps, and was gone. She saw herself climbing up the steps, hurrying after him, Wait! I’m coming! clutching at his muscled forearm Yes of course I’m here yet she remained sitting on the steps, motionless, paralyzed, as if lost in a dream, in that suspension of volition and even thought between sleep and waking, staring at the river waiting to understand what she would do, or had already done."|"I Am No One You Know"|"Joyce Carol Oates"

Tears in her eyes Me demanded to know if Wolfie was in touch with you-know-who. Wolfie exhaled smoke & smirked. Like a kid with a secret. Me said, touching one of the stainless steel blades with just her fingertips, lightly as if it was burning hot, “You don’t want to test me, kid. You or that fucker.” Wolfie said, “What fucker? This is news to me.” Me asked if he’d come to the school & that was how he’d traced them? Wolfie registered under that other name. A name Me wouldn’t utter. Wolfie said shrugging, “Think any shit you want to think, Me. You’re gonna think it anyway at 4 A.M.” At this, Me had to laugh."|"I Am No One You Know"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
"~ 02:00"|"about 2 A.M."|"THAT SATURDAY NIGHT in Olcott there was a strong wind & pelting rain & Wolfie was awakened at about 2 A.M. by a sound of broken glass & his mother screaming. “Get away! God damn you! Get out of here! You fucker!” Wolfie thought: It’s a man. The tattoo freak. There’d been a signal between them Wolfie hadn’t comprehended, the guy must’ve come after Wolfie was in bed & Me had let him inside, in secret, as sometimes Me did with guys, & Wolfie stumbled in pajamas into the hall outside his room, already he was smelling whiskey, spilled whiskey, this was a smell he knew though he hadn’t smelled it yet in Olcott. Wolfie heard a sound of struggle, another scream of Me’s, & a deeper angry voice he believed he heard, & heavy footsteps, & more breaking glass, & standing in the doorway of her dim-lighted bedroom there was Me naked holding a sheet against her sweat-gleaming body. Me’s hair was disheveled & her mouth appeared to be bleeding. Seeing Wolfie she screamed, “No! Don’t come in here! It isn’t safe in here.” Wolfie was so scared the hairs lifted at the nape of his neck & his bladder pinched but he couldn’t see any figure other than Me, unless the guy was hiding in the closet or bathroom? In Me’s room lamplight spilled strangely against the ceiling & walls, the lampshade was knocked askew & still trembling. It looked as if a wind had blown through the room churning bedclothes & dragging the mattress partway off the box springs. There was an overturned whiskey bottle amid the sheets, & the smell of whiskey was sickening to Wolfie’s nostrils, it had associations of which he didn’t want to think & would not. He saw that the closet door was wide open, & nobody inside. Me’s clothes on the floor looking as if they’d been yanked off hangers. Where was the guy? Was there a guy? He might’ve escaped by the broken window, maybe he’d climbed into Me’s room through the window? (But why wouldn’t Wolfie have heard anything until now?) Me was sobbing angrily & bleeding from cut fingers & cuts on her face & her eyes were so dilated Wolfie thought she must be blind. Staring at him & stammering words he couldn’t comprehend. He saw, on the floor by the bed, a long-bladed knife glistening with blood. Me’d been stabbed! Wolfie tasted panic. Me was furious & not seemingly in pain & when he approached her she screamed at him to stay away, it was dangerous to touch her. “Call an ambulance! Call the cops! I’ve been attacked for Christ’s sake! The fucker tried to kill me!” Me tripped in the bedclothes & threw the sheet down in a rage & Wolfie saw to his horror that she’d been cut, stabbed, in her breasts, her belly, her thighs, & narrow rivulets of blood were running swiftly down her body. Wolfie was in terror that Me would die, & ran to the telephone to dial 911 but Me changed her mind & rushed at him & knocked the phone from him saying it was nobody’s business but her own, she didn’t want fucking cops barging into her home, rather bleed to death than invite cops into her home. Wolfie managed to walk Me into the bathroom & with badly shaking fingers dabbed at her wounds with a damp bath towel & Me sobbed quieter now, breathing swiftly & shallowly as if she’d been running, & her hair dark with sweat. Seeing that Wolfie was scared, his face pinched & dead-white, Me grabbed the bloody towel from him & tended to her own wounds, impatient, cursing. Wolfie tried to ask was it the guy they’d given a ride to? the guy with the tattoos? & Me said, “Who the fuck d’you think it was? That bastard, I’m gonna get a warrant for his arrest. I saw his face. I can describe him to a T. I can sketch his likeness.” But Wolfie had to wonder: had there been a guy? Any guy? An intruder? The knife on the bedroom floor was one of Me’s knives from her collection, & how’d a stranger get hold of it? Unless Me flashed it, first? & he got it away from her?"|"I Am No One You Know"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
06:00|"6 A.M."|"AT AGE 13 Wolfie was too young for even a driver’s permit in New York State but he could drive any reasonable vehicle, & had driven, spelling Me in the Chevy van on their long, mostly nighttime drive from Minnesota, & so that morning, a few hours later, Wolfie drove Me to a hospital in Newfane where in the emergency room, nearly deserted at 6 A.M., a young doctor treated her wounds & stitched the deep cuts in her fingers. The doctor was shocked & suspicious asking what had caused these cuts? & Me shrugged & murmured what sounded to Wolfie, some feet away, like “Life.” Wolfie came quickly to join Me. He was anxious, protective. He’d talked Me into coming to Newfane for medical treatment (he knew about infections) & now he was worried that even in her moderately subdued state, not exuding the actual stink of mania, Me yet gave off an odor any professional could detect, as dogs are trained to sniff out illegal drugs. Wolfie said, “My mom’s a sculptor, she carves things & cuts things up, like drift-wood & metal & stuff like that. Sometimes she hurts her hands.” This was such an inspired answer, & even proud, & that word mom at the core, Me brightened & smiled at Wolfie, & Wolfie saw that it would be O.K. The dice were being tossed again, & it would be O.K. “What about these other lacerations, on your body & face?” the doctor asked, & Me said with her most winning smile, like even with her stitched & bandaged fingers she was stroking this guy’s thigh, “These’re the hazards of being an artist, doctor. But I could use some painkiller.” A nurse completed Me’s treatment, putting gauze & bandages on Me’s wounds, four on her face alone, & giving Me a tetanus shot, & Me insisted that her son be given a shot, too—“There’s so much danger for kids these days. Even good, normal kids.”"|"I Am No One You Know"|"Joyce Carol Oates"

I’d been walking through the mall parking lot to the bus stop, about 5:30 P.M., a weekday, I’d come to the mall after school with some kids now I was headed home, and somehow it happened, don’t ask me how, a guy was asking me questions, or saying something, mainly I registered he was an adult my dad’s age possibly, every adult man looked like my dad’s age except obviously old white-haired men. I hadn’t any clear impression of this guy except afterward I would recall rings on his fingers which would’ve caused me to glance up at his face with interest except at that instant something slammed into the back of my head behind my ear knocking me forward, and down, like he’d thrown a hook at me from in front, I was on my face on the sun-heated vinyl upholstery of a car, or a van, and another blow or blows knocked me out.

The red rear lights of the Dodge pickup gone as soon as Dad turned out onto the highway. And the siren kept on at the firehouse. And after a few minutes the fire truck siren began, that sound that makes your heart race. And there was the fire itself we could see at some place two or three miles beyond the creek. The Temperance Vale Road it would turn out, the ramshackle old farmhouse the Barndollars rented, with a fallen-down hay barn at the rear and a rusted Harley-Davidson motorcycle in the front yard with a hand-lettered sign FORE SALE that’d been there for a year at least."|"I Am No One You Know"|"Joyce Carol Oates"

Nothing has much taste now which is O.K. with me, then I don’t get a sick stomach. We’ve been watching TV surfing the channels. Flickering faces is what TV mostly is, voices cranked up to sound important, corny mood music and laugh tracks and dumb-ass ads. After the fire it all seems like ways of not-thinking about real things but the real things poke through anyway. What Dad liked was sports mostly baseball which Tyrell and I tried to watch with him, but got restless when nothing happened. Every season Dad had some new player he liked, it was underdog teams he favored, and up to when he died it was a six-foot-ten gangling guy with lank hair and a mustache who pitched for Arizona who Dad was just thrilled by, said this character was the twin image of some old friend of his from high school who’d died in a car crash. I would watch Dad when this pitcher was on and Dad’s face was so tense, his fists closed on both his knees and his posture so straight, and the light of the TV flickering on him, and I was a little jealous I guess, and maybe Tyrell was, too, that nothing in actual life could mean so much to our father as some stranger pitching ball, and when a batter swung and missed one of these pitches it had the power to make Dad happy in a way we guessed we never could."|"I Am No One You Know"|"Joyce Carol Oates"

Mom says there was all just cornfields and grazing land here when I was a baby but it’s hard to believe. Just to see such ugliness makes you want to break something. Makes you want to toss a bomb. There was no plan that Tyrell had, though. We were out on the overpass kicking chunks of concrete and rocks and crap like metal rods, parts of tires, beer bottles, and cans down onto the highway and watching the stuff break, or bounce. There wasn’t much traffic this time of night about 2 A.M. A sick-looking moon behind some clouds tattered and blowing like old curtains.

I’m this jumpy homely girl, immature my mother would say, for my age. Maybe I like Irish McEwan too, more than I should, but I know he’d never glance twice at me, and it’s a surprise even he seems interested in Kathlee who’s never had a boyfriend, she’s so sweet and nervous and shy and blushes when boys talk to her, or tease her, though she can talk O.K. with girls, and adults, and gets B’s in school. Simple! some of the kids say of my sister and that is absolutely untrue. Now Irish McEwan is asking politely where do we live, exactly?—he thinks he knows, but better be sure. And Kathlee tells him. And we’re on the Strykersville Road, a two-lane blacktop highway leading away from Lake Ontario where the tavern is. It would be said of Irish McEwan that he’d had a dozen beers that afternoon, the alcohol count in his blood was high, but Irish never drove recklessly all the hours we were with him and has been polite not just to Kathlee and me, but to everybody we met. He’s a muscle-shouldered boy you might compare to a steer on its hind legs. He’s strong, and can be a little clumsy. He’s got pale skin, for a boy who works outdoors, with scatterings of freckles, and thick dark-red hair straggling over his ears and down his neck, he would’ve been good-looking except for his habit of frowning, grimacing with his mouth, as bad as my father who’s hard of hearing and screws up his face trying to figure out what people are saying. Irish McEwan is twenty-three years old and already his forehead’s lined like a man’s twice that age."|"I Am No One You Know"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"Then on the Strykersville Road, Irish says suddenly he has a feeling he’d better drop by his own house first. Because his father has been sort of expecting him and he hasn’t gone. Because of meeting up with Kathlee, and then with me. And his father was expecting him around noon but he’d been with Kathlee then, and lost track of time. And Kathlee says O.K., sure. So that’s what we do. Where the McEwans live, or used to live, it’s on the Strykersville Road about two miles closer to the lake than our house, and we live on a side road, so it makes sense to drop by Irish’s house before he takes us home. The McEwan house (that would be shown in newspapers and on TV always looking better, more dignified than it is) is back from the highway about a quarter-mile. One of these bumpy rutted dirt lanes. Except the house is on a little rise, and evergreens in the front yard are mostly dead, you couldn’t have seen it from the road. One of those old faded-red-brick houses along Lake Ontario that look larger from the outside than they actually are, and sort of distinguished, like a house in town, except the shutters and trim are rotting, and the roof leaks, and the chimney, and there’s no insulation, and the plumbing (as my father who’s a carpenter would say) is probably shot to hell. And the outbuildings in worse shape, needing repair. The McEwans are farmers, or were, but hadn’t much interest in farm work, at least not Malachi and Johnny who worked odd jobs in town, but never kept them long. These McEwans were men with quick tempers who didn’t like to be bossed around, especially when they’d been drinking. So we’re driving up the rutted lane and on one side is a scrubby cornfield and on the other is a rock-strewn pasture, and some grazing guernseys that raise their heads to look at us as Irish bounces past raising clouds of dust. My pa is gonna be madder than hell Irish says with this nervous laugh he wanted me here by noon. Parking then in the cinder driveway. And there’s an old Chevy sedan, and another pickup in the drive. And nobody around. Except scruffy chickens pecking in the dirt unperturbed, and a dog barking. This dog is a black mongrel-Labrador cringing by the rear door of the house, and when Irish climbs out of the pickup the dog shies away, barking and whining, as if it doesn’t recognize him. Irish calls to the dog Mick, what’s wrong? Don’t you know me? But the dog cringes and whimpers and runs away around the corner of the house."|"I Am No One You Know"|"Joyce Carol Oates"

(Their father worked for Niagara County: road repair, snow removal. He was paid to watch over cottages owned by summer residents.) Henry had been a happy-seeming boy. He’d been loud, pushy, aggressive. A rough boy, with other boys. By nine he’d seemed to her one of the older boys: he rode a bicycle, he swam, dived off the wharf at Olcott Beach. He seemed to her physically fearless. In his play with other boys he was frequently dominant. Carroty-brown hair and a stocky sturdy tanned body, and strong. Only around their father had Henry been quiet, watchful. Deferential. If Henry gave their father what their father called “lip” the air crackled with excitement. (“Give me any of your lip, you little cocksucker, and your ass will be warmed, got it?”) The danger increased when their father had been drinking, but you couldn’t always tell when he’d been drinking. It was like easing out onto the frozen lake: you couldn’t tell when the ice would begin to crack and buckle beneath your feet."|"I Am No One You Know"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
"~ 01:00"|"around 1 A.M."|"“He said, ‘How’d you kids like some Tastee-Freez?’ He tried to grab us. You were out of bed by now, and outside, you were in just pajamas, and he grabbed you. It was around 1 A.M. He wanted to take us with him in the car, the son of a bitch wanted to kill us, too.”"|"I Am No One You Know"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
01:00|"ONE AM"|"
WHICH ONE AM I, people used to try to guess. But no longer.
Are you Jamie, or are you Jorie? they would ask smiling. As if we had a choice which we could be. As if there is something to make you smile, just seeing twin little girls."|"I Am No One You Know"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
04:00|"4 A.M."|"The more Daddy was gone, “traveling,” “on business,” as Mom told us, the crazier Jorie behaved. Suspended from school, expelled from school, had to be bussed to a special school for “disturbed learning disability children” and eventually suspended from that school, too. She’d pick up dog shit outside and bring it into the house to throw it around laughing wildly at the looks on our faces. She stopped sleeping through the night, any night. At 4 A.M. she’d be out in the kitchen rummaging through the refrigerator eating anything she could find, for sure Mom couldn’t keep ice cream very long in the freezer, Jorie would eat it out of the containers with her fingers, walk away and leave the freezer door wide open. She’d wander into the living room and turn on the TV loud and so if Daddy happened to be home, he was furious, disgusted, and blamed Mom that she couldn’t control Jorie."|"I Am No One You Know"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
"< 22:00"|"nearly 10 P.M."|"ENTERING THE REAR, kitchen door of her two-story wood-frame and brick home on Cedar Drive, East Orange Mrs. Halifax heard muffled laughter in the TV room. Scarcely daring to breathe she came to the doorway seeing only shifting TV shadows. A hulking silhouette on the Barcalounger. It was nearly 10 P.M. A weekday evening! Mrs. Halifax would tell her husband Dwayne she’d been—where?—at a PTA meeting at the school. Her swollen, pale mouth would insist, yes she’d told him she wouldn’t be home until late, he should order a pizza for himself, wasn’t pizza Dwayne Halifax’s favorite favorite food? It was! Greasy Italian sausage, melted mozzarella cheese in yard-long sticky skeins, inch-thick chewy-dough crust that would set Mrs. Halifax’s sensitive bowels aflame, such was Dwayne Halifax’s favorite food which she was hoping he’d ordered so she’d feel less guilty. Not that she felt guilt for loving Rickie Swann! Never would Mrs. Halifax feel guilt for loving Rickie Swann, her love for the boy was the single pure clean selfless and innocent love of her life. There was only innocence between them. She was preparing to defend her love for Rickie Swann when she heard the moist rattle of snoring. Dear Dwayne had fallen asleep in the recliner. Thank God! As increasingly Dwayne was doing in the evenings since he’d lost his last job and his mysterious health symptoms had emerged. Poor Dwayne who’d once been a tight end on the Rutgers football team, with a head of shaggy curly hair, now nearly bald, pot-bellied and with a strangely shriveling right leg at the age of only thirty-seven, only five years older than Mrs. Halifax but looking at least fifteen years older, almost overnight it seemed Dwayne had become the type of man you might love but wouldn’t be in love with, not if you were a normal very intensely female woman like Mrs. Halifax. Noooooo. Also Dwayne Halifax had been a vigorous alpha-type male in his earlier life but of late he’d become one of that category of left-behind Americans you might say. A high-tech computer whiz straight out of college hired at a six-figure salary then in the mid-1990’s abruptly “downsized” and with no choice but to re-enter the work force on a far lower level of income and distinction, he’d taken a course in real-estate at the local community college and was hired by the region’s largest realtor then again abruptly downsized with plummeting real-estate sales in the wake of a recession, next, still robust and hopeful, vowing not to be discouraged he’d taken first aid, lifesaving and lifeguard training and showing up for his first day as a lifeguard at Jersey City Beach he was met by State of New Jersey health officials armed with documents shutting the beach for reasons of toxic chemical and cloacal bacterial contamination. It was following this new disappointment that Dwayne Halifax began to turn inward upon himself, increasingly brooding and withdrawn, and his right leg began to atrophy as a local doctor tentatively diagnosed, it was possibly the onslaught of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (“Lou Gehrig’s disease”) or a milder sclerosis, though perversely, and Mrs. Halifax supposed this must be a positive sign, Dwayne’s appetite was wholly unaffected, you should see Dwayne Halifax eat. Well, let him have his pleasures at least. What remained to him. She was smelling pizza-smells, and beer. In her stocking feet, holding her shoes she tiptoed to the snoring, open-mouthed man on the Barcalounger and gave him a breathy kiss on the forehead. Blessed with the love of Rickie Swann, Mrs. Halifax felt a surge of affection for her husband. She would take care not to wake him. Often he slept in the TV room now. Long groggy bouts of sleep, sometimes as many as fourteen hours at a stretch. Not for an instant did it occur to Mrs. Halifax God I hate him, wish he would die die DIE and certainly she did not think The boy will kill him for me, instead she pulled a quilt up over his bulky body and switched off the TV and lights that he might sleep undisturbed through the night. In her loins that still throbbed in the aftermath of passion, staining her black stretch panties was the boy’s silky semen seeping out of her, the hot deep secret core of her being, her eyeballs shuddered in their sockets as on tiptoe she ascended the stairs Oh Ricki-ie. Rick-ie Swann. I love you so."|"I Am No One You Know"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
22:00|"10 P.M."|"At 10 P.M. Mrs. Swann had begun to worry about her son, yes and she was suspicious of the way he pushed past her avoiding her eyes and with his greasy hair swinging in his face like he was hiding behind it, and his mouth looked swollen and raw (had he been kissing some hot-chick little cunt?) and the scent of his underarms made even her practiced nostrils pinch. Over his shoulder he growled, “Go to hell, Mom. I got homework.”"|"I Am No One You Know"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
"> 18:00"|"After 6 P.M."|"“I was…driving him home from school, Officer.”
“After 6 P.M.? What kind of school would that be, ma’am?”
“I was…you see, I was tutoring him. He’s behind in his studies. I was tutoring him after school, Officer.”"|"I Am No One You Know"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
22:30|"10:30 P.M."|"And so they were spared. And so they were allowed to leave Metuchen. Mrs. Halifax hadn’t been the cause of the accident but her car had to be towed off the highway and she’d had to give a police report; she hoped to God the accident wasn’t significant enough to be written up in the local papers. (It wasn’t.) But she had to call a taxi to take her and Rickie Swann to East Orange, and she had to call her husband. Rickie had to call his mother. Excuses were fumblingly made. Rickie didn’t get home until 10:30 P.M. that night, and Mrs. Halifax didn’t get home until later. As soon as she entered the house there was Dwayne Halifax waiting for her, up from his Barcalounger and limping about the kitchen with fierce eyes and a hurt, bruised mouth. “Tutoring some kid? What kid? What the fuck’s going on here? Where’ve you been all this week? Where’s my station wagon? What the fuck’ve you done with my station wagon?”"|"I Am No One You Know"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
12:00|midday|"IT WAS RICKIE who weakened. He called Mrs. Halifax on his cell phone. His voice was so raw, at first he couldn’t speak. Mrs. Halifax had been drinking (at midday, not like her!) and immediately she succumbed. The Chevy station wagon had been repaired, she swung by to pick her eager young lover up behind Home Depot and they drove to one of their secret places, a marshy area off the Turnpike north of Newark Airport where an access road led to a cul-de-sac amid six-foot rushes that rustled romantically in the wind and dank pools of standing water in which part-submerged tires crouched like alligators."|"I Am No One You Know"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
"> 18:00"|"Just past 6:00 P.M."|"IN STRAND USED BOOKS on Broadway and Twelfth one snowy March early evening in 1956 when the streetlights on Broadway glimmered with a strange sepia glow, we were two NYU girl-poets drifting through the warehouse of treasures as through an enchanted forest. Just past 6:00 P.M. Above light-riddled Manhattan, opaque night. Snowing, and sidewalks encrusted with ice so there were fewer customers in the Strand than usual at this hour but there we were. Among other cranky brooding regulars. In our army-surplus jackets, baggy khaki pants, and zip-up rubber boots. In our matching wool caps (knitted by your restless fingers) pulled down low over our pale-girl foreheads. Enchanted by books. Enchanted by the Strand."|"I Am No One You Know"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
21:00|"9:00 P.M."|"Marilyn Monroe drifted through the maze of books and we followed in her wake as through a maze of dreams, past SPORTS, past MILITARY, past WAR, past HISTORY/ANCIENT, past the familiar figures of Strand regulars frowning into books, past surly yawning bearded clerks who took no more heed of the blond actress than they ever did of us, and so to NATURAL HISTORY where she paused, and there again for unhurried minutes (the Strand was open until 9:00 P.M.) Marilyn Monroe in her mannish disguise browsed and brooded, pulling down books, seeking what? at last crouched leafing through an oversized illustrated book (curiosity overcame me! I shoved away your restraining hand; politely I eased past Marilyn Monroe murmuring “excuse me” without so much as brushing against her and without being noticed), Charles Darwin’s Origin of Species in a deluxe edition. Darwin! Origin of Species! We were poet-despisers-of-science, or believed we were, or must be, to be true poets in the exalted mode of T. S. Eliot and William Butler Yeats; such a choice, for Marilyn Monroe, seemed perverse to us. But this book was one Marilyn quickly decided to purchase, hoisting it into her arms and moving on."|"I Am No One You Know"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
"> 08:00"|"shortly after 8 A.M."|"As always on weekday mornings her fiancé left the apartment early. She’d gone out shortly after 8 A.M. to a nearby Kinko’s to pick up a color-xeroxed manuscript (of a children’s book) and she was crossing South End Avenue as the signal flashed WALK when she heard a droning noise at first annoying and then alarming as of a gargantuan hornet and when she looked up squinting she saw a sight so unnerving her eyes at first refused to decode it: an airplane, a commercial airliner, enormous, flying unnaturally low, careening out of the sky and out of her stunned vision behind a bank of buildings as, in the next instant, she was thrown to her knees on the pavement by a colossal explosion, and she thought There has been a ghastly accident though so formal and archaic a word as ghastly was not common in her vocabulary. She fell, she struck her knees on the pavement, it seemed to her that shards and slivers of glass were pelting her exposed skin like maddened insects yet in virtually the same instant, for she’d been an excellent basketball player in high school in Illinois, her reflexes were still rapid, unthinking, in the same instant in which she fell and in nearly the same instant in which she heard the explosion somewhere close by and overhead she was on her feet, and running into the building, her building, her place of sanctuary; she was running hunched over, still clutching the xeroxed manuscript; she was running past individuals stunned and un-comprehending as figures in a dream, now in the elevator and rapidly ascending to the thirty-sixth floor able to think calmly If I can do this, if the elevator is working I’m all right. The accident will be taken care of."|"I Am No One You Know"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
09:20|"9:20 A.M."|"Clearly hours had gone by since she’d been thrown to her knees on the sidewalk yet by her watch it was only 9:20 A.M. (Unless it was 9:20 P.M. and in her panic she’d lost an entire day.) The sky outside the building was a whirlwind of darkness. She located the flashlight in a kitchen closet. Never had she switched on this flashlight before and was startled and pleased that it worked. It worked! The beam was impressive and steady. She ran water in the bathroom again, laying the flashlight on its side on the counter. Unknowingly now she’d begun to repeat a small repertory of actions and she would repeat them many times. She washed her face that seemed to be throbbing with heat, she rinsed her eyes, thirstily lapped up lukewarm water. She felt the building sway beneath her but thought sternly This is imagination. There are no earthquakes in Manhattan. She was beginning to smell something new, corrosive, chemical. Nerve gas: her nerves were being paralyzed. Hours would pass in a haze of pacing the dimming rooms of the apartment with the flashlight beaming into corners as she held wetted towels against her nose and mouth. This terrible smell which she believed to be the smell of chemical warfare."|"I Am No One You Know"|"Joyce Carol Oates"

"ap 02:15"|two-fifteen|"Quickly she locked the door behind her. She lighted several candles. She lighted all her candles! Arranged them on the windowsills of all her windows. Like Christmas: there was an innocence to this. She thought This is the right thing to do at this time. If her fiancé looked up from the street he would see her lighted candles and know that she was alive. By her watch it was two-fifteen. Not afternoon but night. For she’d lost the day. Never would she recover the day. But always she would remember her shock, and the happiness of her shock, when, out of the shifting smoke and ashes separating her apartment windows from the windows of apartments in an adjacent tower of Battery Park City, she began to see candlelight there, glimmering like distant stars. Several candles, a half-dozen candles, floating in the dark, brave and festive in the dark."|"I Am No One You Know"|"Joyce Carol Oates"
