12:00|noon|"Squirrel-like, she scampered up a scaly trunk and along a fat branch. Though it was close to noon, the light was dappled, uncertain. The canopy was high above her, the floor lost in green layers far below. The forest was silent save for the rustling of leaves in the warm breeze and the call of the canopy birds, those colorful cousins of the vanished dinosaurs."|Evolution|"Stephen Baxter"
12:00|noon|"It was noon, and the sun was the highest it would travel today, but it was still low in the sky. Shafts of low green-filtered light slanted through the trees, illuminating the dense, warm mist that rose from the steaming mulch on the floor, and the tree trunks sent shadows striping over the forest floor."|Evolution|"Stephen Baxter"
12:00|noon|"Eggs. There were ten of them, nestling in the bird’s crude nest, each of them a reservoir of yolk as big as Roamer’s head. In the stillness of noon, with her mate away, the bird had left her nest briefly unguarded, taking the chance that no harm would come to it while she briefly assuaged her hunger. She was unfortunate that Roamer’s sharp eyes had detected the nest so quickly."|Evolution|"Stephen Baxter"
"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"The ground was hidden by a tangle of roots, branches, moss, and leaves. Wild celery grew in clumps everywhere. Although it was around noon, the air here was cold, made damp by a faint mist like a morning fog. The tree trunks were clammy, and thick lichen and moss left uncomfortable green streaks on his palms. The dampness seemed to dig through his fur. But after the aridity of the salt pan he relished the close, comforting tangle of green around him, and he devoured the leaves, fruit, and fungi he was able to pluck from the ground around him. And he felt safe from predators. Surely there was nothing that could strike at the hungry, weary band in this green density."|Evolution|"Stephen Baxter"
12:00|noon|"In the noon heat the grass eaters clustered in the shade, or simply lay in the dust. She glimpsed great static herds of elephant types, many species of them, like gray clouds in the distance. Clumsy, high-stepping ostriches pecked listlessly at the ground. Sleek predators slept lazily with their cubs. Even the scavengers, the wheeling birds and the scuttling feeders, were resting from their grisly chores. Nothing stirred but the dust that she kicked up, nothing moved but her own fleeting shadow, shrunk to a patch of darkness beneath her."|Evolution|"Stephen Baxter"
12:00|noon|"The sun had begun to slide away from the zenith, and already the shadow at her feet had lengthened. Soon the animals would begin to stir; she would no longer be safe, no longer be shielded by the noon world’s somnolence."|Evolution|"Stephen Baxter"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"The minds of the adults were about equivalent in complexity to a five-year-old human’s. Their children were not capable of speech— nothing beyond chimplike jabbers— until they reached adolescence. It had only been a year or two since the adults’ words had made any sense to Far, and the Brat, at seven, couldn’t talk at all. The kids were like apes born to human parents."|Evolution|"Stephen Baxter"
12:00|noon|"As noon approached, the desultory stillness of this strange, heavy day deepened. The savannah, open and free, beckoned Far, as it had done yesterday. As the emptiness in her belly diminished, the pressures of survival and familial duty were overcome by her longing to get out of here."|Evolution|"Stephen Baxter"
12:00|midday|"As midday approached, the hominids moved away from the water, relaxed, satiated."|Evolution|"Stephen Baxter"
"~ 12:00"|"about midday"|"By the time he left to rejoin his hidden companions, about midday the next day, he had a bag full of sample goods. And he had carefully memorized the location of every kiln, every elaborate hearth."|Evolution|"Stephen Baxter"
12:00|midday|"The sun climbed higher. Despite all that had happened to Remembrance, it was not yet midday."|Evolution|"Stephen Baxter"
"> 12:00"|"past noon"|"And, at some point past noon, when the sun had begun its climb down the sky, Ultimate suddenly found herself facing the sphere once again."|Evolution|"Stephen Baxter"
