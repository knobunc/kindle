"ap 01:50"|"one fifty"|"At least they were only dreams. She’d seen other things. For example, she’d never mentioned the strange woman in the dormitory the night Rebecca Snell put a tooth under the pillow. Susan had watched her come through the open window and stand by the bed. She looked a bit like a milkmaid and not at all frightening, even though she had walked through the furniture. There had been the jingle of coins. Next morning the tooth had gone and Rebecca was richer by one fifty-pence coin."|"Soul Music"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"Anyway, that was the incident of the midnight visitor. After a while, Susan considered that she must have imagined it. That was the only logical explanation. And Susan was good at those."|"Soul Music"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"“Oh, no,” said Susan. “It must be midnight already. And we’ve got a geography exam tomorrow.”"|"Soul Music"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap ~ 10:30"|"about half past ten"|"As Susan ran past, the Purple Bindweed was opening and Love-in-a-Spin was closing. This meant that it was about half past ten."|"Soul Music"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"“I’d better be going,” said Susan. “Miss Butts always checks the dorms on the stroke of midnight.”"|"Soul Music"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"“You believe she checks them all at midnight and you don’t believe in the Hogfather?”"|"Soul Music"|"Terry Pratchett"
"< 00:00"|"almost midnight"|"On the Discworld, he doesn’t bother to take the sand out first.
It was almost midnight.
Susan crept into the stables. She was one of those people who will not leave a loose thread unpulled or a mystery unsolved."|"Soul Music"|"Terry Pratchett"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"It was three in the morning. Sergeant Colon and Corporal Nobbs were reaching the conclusion that anyone who intended to invade Ankh-Morpork probably wasn’t going to do so now. And there was a good fire back in the watch house."|"Soul Music"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"Imp stood like a discus thrower as the chord filled across the noisy room.
It rang like an iron bar dropped on a library floor at midnight.
Echoes bounced back from the corners of the room. Each one bore its own load of harmonies."|"Soul Music"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"The Librarian knuckled and swung through the midnight drizzle, head exploding with music."|"Soul Music"|"Terry Pratchett"
02:00|"two o’clock in the morning"|"Something besides her didn’t want him dead.
It was two o’clock in the morning, and raining.
Constable Detritus, Ankh-Morpork City Watch, was guarding the Opera House. It was an approach to policing that he’d picked up from Sergeant Colon. When you were all by yourself in the middle of a rainy night, go and guard something big with handy overhanging eaves. Colon had pursued this policy for years, as a result of which no major landmark had ever been stolen."|"Soul Music"|"Terry Pratchett"
02:00|"2:00 A.M."|"For the last five minutes he’d also been hearing muffled thumps and the occasional tinkling noise from inside the Opera House. He’d made a note of it. He did not wish to appear stupid. Detritus had never been inside the Opera House. He didn’t know what sound it normally made at 2:00 A.M."|"Soul Music"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 07:00"|"Seven o’clock"|"“Good. Got things to organize,” said Dibbler. “See you tonight. The Cavern. Seven o’clock.”"|"Soul Music"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 01:02"|"One two"|"Asphalt ambled to the front of the stage.
“One two, one two,” he said. “One. One. One two, one tw—”
“Three,” said Buddy helpfully."|"Soul Music"|"Terry Pratchett"
"~ 00:00"|"gone midnight"|"“It’s gone midnight!” said the Lecturer in Recent Runes, snapping his fingers. “And I don’t care a bit! What shall we do now?”"|"Soul Music"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 02:00"|two|"Ridcully hammered on the door of the High Energy Magic Building as the city clocks were striking two. He was supporting Ponder Stibbons, who was asleep on his feet."|"Soul Music"|"Terry Pratchett"
"~ 02:00"|"gone two in the morning"|"“It’s gone two in the morning! What kind of music shop is open at two in the morning?” Glod struck a match."|"Soul Music"|"Terry Pratchett"

"~ 06:00"|"around six in the morning"|"The Mended Drum seldom closed. There tended to be a lull around six in the morning, but Hibiscus stayed open so long as someone wanted a drink."|"Soul Music"|"Terry Pratchett"
08:00|"eight in the morning"|"It was eight in the morning, a time when drinkers are trying either to forget who they are or remember where they live. The other occupants of the Mended Drum were hunched over their drinks around the walls and watching an orang-utan, who was playing Barbarian Invaders and screaming with rage every time he lost a penny."|"Soul Music"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 03:10"|"Three hours and ten minutes"|"“How long has it been now?” said Cliff.
“Three hours and ten minutes,” said Glod.
Buddy sighed."|"Soul Music"|"Terry Pratchett"
12:00|noon|"The Festival was due to start at noon. Dibbler had planned to put on a lot of the small, bad groups first—that is to say, all of them—and finish with The Band. So there was no reason to worry if they weren’t here right now."|"Soul Music"|"Terry Pratchett"
"< 12:00"|"almost noon"|"“It’s almost noon. Where did I leave the horses? Has anyone seen the cart? Someone wake him up!”"|"Soul Music"|"Terry Pratchett"
"~ 00:00"|"gone midnight"|"The teacher rallied. “Do you know it’s gone midnight? For shame! And you’re out of bed! And that is certainly not the school uniform!”"|"Soul Music"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"It wasn’t the taste. Plenty of hot dogs taste bad. But Dibbler had now actually managed to produce sausages that didn’t taste of anything. It was weird. No matter how much mustard, ketchup, and pickle people put on them, they still didn’t taste of anything. Not even the midnight dogs they sell to drunks in Helsinki can quite manage that."|"Soul Music"|"Terry Pratchett"
