There was even, it seemed to Ray, the hint of a delicate, delicious floral scent when she passed him. She provided little competition to Leona’s chic plumage, but the change was noticeable. Ray spoke to her only in passing—earning a suspicious and belligerent look from Claude—but he had no doubt that she had made the effort for him, and the thought made him giddy with pleasure."|"Old Bones"|"Aaron Elkins"

Now she was wondering what the estate was really worth, what it would mean to her. Well, he could tell her and no doubt would.

Yes, he thought, maybe he had. ""La lutte et les sacrifices,"" it said—""the struggle and the sacrifices."" There was no reference to executions; not even a mention of the Nazis. Why not? Was it simply the dignified restraint of a little village that had had enough of blood and passion? Or was it conceivable that Ray and his family had the story wrong?
