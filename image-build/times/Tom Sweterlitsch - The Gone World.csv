A quarter after 3:00 a.m., neighbors would know something had happened, but they might not know what yet—if they peered from their windows they would find a confusion of patrol units, sheriff’s cars and Canonsburg PD, state police cruisers, investigations a web of jurisdiction by the time federal agents were involved. Moss’s cases tended to concern Naval Space Command sailors home on shore leave from “Deep Waters,” the black-ops missions to Deep Space and Deep Time. Bar fights, domestic violence, drug charges, homicides. She had worked cases where NSC sailors had snapped and beaten their wives or girlfriends to death—tragic occurrences, some sailors spiraling after seeing the terrors of the Terminus or the light of alien suns. She wondered what she would find here. The county coroner’s van was parked nearby. Ambulances and fire engines idled.

An image sun-kissed and freckled, cutoffs and a tank top, her straight hair the color of coal. Moss’s breath caught at the similarities between her friend and the missing girl—casually beautiful, each with that long, dark hair. Moss had been trained in time travel—accustomed to reliving future events as they played out in the terra firma of the present, but this déjà vu was something else, like she’d caught the world repeating itself, the house, the girls, like she had seen something she wasn’t supposed to see, the repetitive mechanics of cyclical time. Or maybe the similarity between the girls was something more rare, something like a second chance. She had lost Courtney, but she could still save Marian. Moss relaxed into bed, comforted knowing that people would be looking for the girl, that someone might already have seen her, might know where she is, safe, safe—but as she drifted off for only a few hours of sleep, Moss could almost feel the girl’s body grown cold."|"The Gone World"|"Tom Sweterlitsch"

The mayor’s office was housed in the Borough Building, as was the Canonsburg Police Department, but they seemed unprepared for the sheer amount of news interest, Moss thought, pushing past a throng of photographers. She showed her credentials to a police officer and signed her name to a printout list of authorized personnel before she was allowed through to the conference room. An older man, someone from the borough, noticed her prosthesis and stepped aside. He laid his hand on the back of her blouse as she passed, and she stiffened at the touch, too familiar, at this man’s fingers lingering on the contours of her bra strap. He smiled, gesturing her to go ahead—chivalrous, he must have thought, or fatherly, but his touch remained between her shoulder blades until she managed to separate herself to the far side of the meeting room. Still a few minutes before nine. Several of the joint task force had already taken seats around a horseshoe of a half dozen banquet tables. Moss recognized faces from the night before, FBI men mostly, but their demeanors had changed, the dolor of the Mursult deaths dissipated in the light of day, replaced by fresh hair gel and changed clothes, Styrofoam cups of coffee, doughnuts from white boxes on the back table."|"The Gone World"|"Tom Sweterlitsch"

I landed on a pdf of a sheriff’s document that indicated a stint in county jail, drug-related—even more reason not to flash a badge and pepper her with questions about a past murder. Njoku’s file mentioned she was habitual at a bar called May’rz Inn. I thought of my mother, how if she wasn’t at home she would be at McGrogan’s. The name of Nicole Onyongo’s bar rang a bell, and I checked the address, knew where the place was, just a ten-minute drive from the Red Roof into downtown Washington, on South Main. Almost midnight, but a good chance it would be open, so I took my key card from the computer and drove over.

She pulled from 151 into the gravel drive, skidding as she braked. A pear tree grew in the front yard, and there was a hedgerow in front of the porch, but otherwise the house was the same as it would be years from now. Moss left her truck, every fondness for this place curdled. A black van with a red racing stripe was parked near the house. The barn doors were lit with a floodlight set to a motion sensor that had tripped. Around the far side of the barn, a Winnebago without wheels was up on cinder blocks—I’ve seen that before, she thought.

She had searched for the tree in the years since but hadn’t been able to find it and had grown to think of it as a mistake of memory, a hallucination—seeing it now was a relief, a confirmation.

Winter was general over the Earth; even the sandblasted deserts of Africa experienced snowfall. NPR news reported that suicides lined the streets of Manhattan, Los Angeles, London, copycat deaths of Heaven’s Gate, bodies draped in sheets. There had been minor looting of shoe stores, people stealing the black-and-white Nikes favored by the cult. This is how the world ends, Moss thought. No panicking, no riots. No reports of the hanged men appearing, or of people running in herds, not yet anyway, though when she arrived in Virginia Beach, its few snowplows deployed laying salt and scraping the roads clear of slush, she learned that scores of people had congregated on the beach, that they had bent and flailed in concert, a sort of calisthenics, before wading into the ocean to drown."|"The Gone World"|"Tom Sweterlitsch"
