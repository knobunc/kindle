         two hundred days a year, which works out to about twelve hundred hours of work annually. During harvest or spring planting,
         the day might be longer. In the winter, much less. In The Discovery of France, the historian Graham Robb argues that peasant life in a country like France, even well into the nineteenth century, was essentially
         brief episodes of work followed by long periods of idleness."|Outliers|"Malcolm Gladwell"
