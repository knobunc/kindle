"ap 06:30"|"six thirty"|"Richard waved away the interruption. Life was almost under his control, now. Just a little more time . . .
Garry said his name again. “Dick? It’s six thirty.”
“It’s what?” Papers and pens and spreadsheets and trolls were tumbled into Richard’s briefcase. He snapped it shut and ran."|Neverwhere|"Neil Gaiman"

00:00|midnight|"He wiped away the sleep grit that crusted his eyes, and took stock of himself, pleased to notice that he had at least taken off his shoes and jacket before he had fallen asleep. His shirt front was covered with dried blood and with dirt. The homeless girl didn’t say anything. She looked bad: pale, beneath the grime and brown-dried blood, and small. She was dressed in a variety of clothes thrown over each other: odd clothes, dirty velvets, muddy lace, rips and holes through which other layers and styles could be seen. She looked, Richard thought, as if she’d done a midnight raid on the History of Fashion section of the Victoria and Albert Museum, and was still wearing everything she’d taken. Her short hair was filthy, but looked like it might have been a dark reddish color under the dirt."|Neverwhere|"Neil Gaiman"
"ap 08:50"|"ten to nine"|"ON MONDAY MORNING RICHARD’S alarm failed to go off. He came out onto the street at a run at ten to nine, briefcase swinging, staring up and down the road like a madman, praying for a taxi. Then he sighed with relief, because a big black car was heading down the road toward him, its yellow “TAXI” sign bright. He waved at it and yelled."|Neverwhere|"Neil Gaiman"
"ap 10:30"|10:30|"“I’M SORRY I’M LATE,” said Richard, to no one in particular in the crowded office. The clock on the office wall said that it was 10:30. He dropped his briefcase on his chair, wiped the sweat from his face with his handkerchief. “You wouldn’t believe what it was like, getting here,” he continued. “It was a nightmare.”"|Neverwhere|"Neil Gaiman"
01:00|"one am"|"RICHARD WAS HANDED A bar of vending-machine-sized Cadbury Fruit and Nut chocolate, and a large silver goblet, ornamented around the rim with what appeared to Richard to be sapphires. The goblet was filled with Coca-Cola. The jester, whose name appeared to be Tooley, cleared his throat, loudly. “I would like to propose a toast to our guests,” he said. “A child, a bravo, a fool. May they each get what they deserve.”
“Which one am I?” whispered Richard to Hunter.
“The fool, of course,” she said."|Neverwhere|"Neil Gaiman"
"~ 19:33"|"about 1933"|"THE ADVERTISEMENTS ON THE walls were for refreshing and health-giving malted drinks, for two-shilling day excursions by train to the seaside, for kippered herrings, moustache wax and bootblack. They were smoke-blackened relics of the late twenties or the early thirties. Richard stared at them in disbelief. It seemed completely abandoned: a forgotten place. “It is British Museum station,” admitted Richard. “But . . . but there never was a British Museum station. This is all wrong.”
“It was closed down in about 1933, and sealed off,” said Door.
“How bizarre,” said Richard. It was like walking through history. He could hear trains echoing through tunnels nearby, felt the push of air as they passed. “Are there many stations like this?”"|Neverwhere|"Neil Gaiman"

"ap 01:02"|"one two"|"His skin felt clammy, and his eyes felt like they had been put in wrong, while his skull gave him the general impression that someone had removed it while he had slept, and swapped it for one two or three sizes too small. An Underground train went past a few feet from them; the wind of its passage whipped at the table. The noise of its passage went through Richard’s head like a hot knife through brains. Richard groaned."|Neverwhere|"Neil Gaiman"
"ap > 02:00"|"after two o’clock"|"Garry looked at his watch. “Bloody hell,” he exclaimed. “It’s after two o’clock. Let’s hope there are still a few taxis about.” They walked into Brewer Street, at the Piccadilly end of Soho, wandering past the lights of the peep shows and the strip clubs. Garry was talking about taxis. He was not saying anything original, or even interesting. He was simply fulfilling his obligation as a Londoner to grumble about taxis. “. . . had his light on and everything,” he was saying, “I told him where I wanted to go, he said, sorry, I’m on my way home, I said, where do all you taxi drivers live anyway? And why don’t any of you live near me? The trick is to get in first, then tell them you live south of the river, I mean, what was he trying to tell me? The way he was carrying on Battersea might as well have been in bloody Katmandu . . .”"|Neverwhere|"Neil Gaiman"

00:00|midnight|"The shepherd was plump, well-fed, and was excellently dressed. He had sandy-gray-colored hair and a harassed expression. He wore a remarkable coat, even if it was somewhat tight on him. The coat was the color of a wet street at midnight."|Neverwhere|"Neil Gaiman"
