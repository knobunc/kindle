07:30|"half past seven in the morning"|"And sometimes I did. In the early mornings, specially when it was all falling apart with me and Carol, when we weren’t even speaking. I’d slip out early and get the 63 as usual but get off two stops later and walk up from Farringdon Road, up Charterhouse Street, in the half light. Breakfast at Smithfield. We’d go to that caff in Long Lane or to one of those pubs that serves beer and nosh at half past seven in the morning. There was Ted White from Peckham and Joe Malone from Rotherhithe and Jimmy Phelps from Camberwell. And of course, in the early days, there’d be Vince, being trained up. Before he joined up."|"Last Orders"|"Graham Swift"
"ap 05:30"|"five thirty"|"He said, ‘Evening, Vic. You coming to the Coach?’ And that was strange, because either he’d see me at the Coach or he wouldn’t, I could find my own way there.

06:00|"six in the morning"|"Another man would’ve acted different. But what I did was to sit there in the dark, not moving, not budging, till I wasn’t sitting there any more, I was curled up with all my clothes still on and it was six in the morning. Then I got up and washed and shaved and changed my clothes and put two slices of toast under the grill and made tea like I wasn’t thinking of anything. I washed up what was in the sink. I checked what was in my wallet and put some things in a bag. Then I went round to the yard, where the old stable had been turned by Charlie Dixon into a lock-up. I bought a Sporting Life on the way and twenty Player’s and thought, I’m alive on this Wednesday morning. It was late April. I backed out the camper and wiped the dust off the windscreen with the engine still running. I looked at the tyres and thought of opening the engine compartment, but what was there to fuss over when the thing had hardly been driven? I checked all was okay in the back: the gas burners and cylinder, water carrier, the standby box with the kettle and mugs and tea-towel and stuff. Guide to Places of Interest in England and Wales. I drove out through the gates, stopped, got out and closed the gates, CHAS. DIXON, SITES CLEARED, and did the bolts and the padlock. It was a bright, clear morning. Then I jumped back in and drove to Newmarket."|"Last Orders"|"Graham Swift"
"ap ~ 02:15"|"Gone two fifteen"|"Vince glances up quick at Lenny but he don’t say nothing. He puffs his cigar, eyes narrowed, then he takes the stub from his mouth, there’s still a few puffs left, and crushes it in the ashtray. He says, ‘I don’t know about you, Lenny, but I’m here to take something to Margate, that’s what we’re all here to do. And Vic here would like us to pay a little extra call on the way, which I aint against, considering. We’re here to remember the dead.’ He looks at his watch. ‘Gone two fifteen. Now if you want to stay here drinking all afternoon’ – he sweeps his gaze round the table as if we’re all suddenly included in some plot against him, it’s not just Lenny – ‘that’s your business. But I’m going to the car right now and I’m driving to Margate. If you don’t want to come too, you better find out where the station is.’"|"Last Orders"|"Graham Swift"

"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"But we didn’t see so much of the races. It must’ve been the first time I’d been to a racecourse without taking a proper punt.

Her horse against mine, a quid says, and I made sure she won. Conquistador, seven to two. I could have put fifty on it and come home flush. But the weather was changing and before the next race it came on to rain, like you might have said it was timed special. Sometimes luck just runs. So I said, ‘Picnic time,’ and we hurried back to the camper. I suppose two people know when something’s going to happen, even when they’re not so sure it ought to and they don’t know how they’re going to bring it about and they’re as afraid of it as wanting it. But they know if it’s ever going to happen, now’s the time. There were curtains you draw across the windows in that camper, blue and white check, so no one would know. Except by the rocking of the suspension. But I don’t suppose there was much of that. I said, pulling the curtains, ‘Just like home, eh? Home from home.’ The rain was drumming on the roof. I thought, It can’t be helped, even if it aint right. I thought, Amy chose June, she didn’t choose Jack, now I’ve chosen Amy. They weren’t so faded. When the rain stopped we heard the crowd cheering for the three ten, the big race, the strange noise of people getting het-up over a bunch of horses.

"ap 03:00"|three|"Then she said crisply into the phone, ‘I see. I’ll tell him,’ then to me, with a sort of relish, ‘You’ll have to wait. The superintendent’s on a late lunch, he won’t be back till three.’"|"Last Orders"|"Graham Swift"
"ap 03:00"|"Three o’clock"|"But I would’ve known anyway. There’s always an incinerator chimney. There’s always a blank double door like the back exit of a cinema. If there’s no one about and there’s no other sign, you bang with your fist on the double door. Someone comes to a window and sees the Maria reversed up.
She said, ‘Three o’clock.’
It’s a sort of distaste. Stigma, that’s the word. Like you don’t want to know the man who takes away your rubbish. I’m used to it, it’s natural. The old man used to say an undertaker’s half lord, half leper. You shouldn’t hold it against."|"Last Orders"|"Graham Swift"
"ap 03:00"|"Three o’clock"|"I thought of asking: Is there somewhere I could get a bite? Then reckoned better of it. Then I thought, for a mad moment: Twenty minutes – I could see June. Just see her. Out of plain curiosity, out of I don’t know what. See what Jack never sees. I could find out and just go, a black jacket will take you most places. But then I thought, No, seeing June might not be so hard, might not be so bad, but first you had to get past this charmer.
I said, ‘Three o’clock,’ folding the forms back into my pocket.
But I looked towards where the corridors led off, thinking, So this is where. And this is where Amy comes twice a week, year in year out. I wonder if she says hello to this cow, I wonder if she gets a smile."|"Last Orders"|"Graham Swift"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"I climbed back into the Maria. From the front of the van I could see them clearly, fifty yards, ten o’clock, Ray on the side of the bench nearest me.

"ap 03:05"|"Five past three"|"Five past three and they were still there on the bench, and nothing in the van to pass the time, save an old thumbed A to Z and the forms in my pocket.

If it’s placed, I hang on, if it’s not, I sell. You shouldn’t bet on superstition. And it comes in fourth in a nine-horse race. O’Grady Says, five to one.

Thirty-three to one.
But it’s different if you know. And if it don’t come in, which it will, then Jack’ll get his money back. I’ll foot the bill for this bet, recoup it on another. Jack’ll get his thousand back, and that’s my conscience squared. Price of a camper."|"Last Orders"|"Graham Swift"

It’s just a matter of time, Bern.’ Looking at Slattery’s clock. Quarter past two. And Bernie shakes his head, like what’s happening to Jack is something that ought not to be possible, like it’s a miracle working the opposite way. I say, ‘You having one too, Bern? Have one on me. Fetch me a sandwich while you’re at it. Ham, no mustard.’ And up on its shelf, high up at the end of the bar, Bernie’s telly’s all set up and switched on, the screen angled and the sound pitched just right, so that any Joe sitting at the bar can keep his eye and ear on what’s showing, without having to move an inch to order a drink.

I don’t move a muscle when they click up the result and the SPs to confirm. Shortened a shade, but I don’t need no SPs.
Thirty-three to one.
Bernie says, ‘Someone’s lucky day.’ And I say, ‘Yep,’ picking up my whisky glass, draining it, looking through the bleary bottom of it. Then I look at my watch and at Slattery’s clock and put my empty glass on the bar and dismount my stool. ‘Well, must be getting along, Bern. See yer.’ Bernie says, ‘See yer,’ taking the glass.
