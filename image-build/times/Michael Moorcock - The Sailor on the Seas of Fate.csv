12:00|noon|"As the mist cleared, it revealed a landscape of dense shadows. The shadows spread over red rock and yellow vegetation and they were shadows of all shapes and dimensions, resembling all manner of things. They seemed cast by the huge blood-colored sun which stood at perpetual noon above the island, but what was disturbing about them was that the shadows themselves seemed without a source, as if the objects they represented were invisible or existed elsewhere than on the island itself. The sky, too, seemed full of these shadows, but whereas those on the island were still, those in the sky sometimes moved, perhaps when the clouds moved. And all the while the red sun poured down its bloody light and touched the twenty men with its unwelcome radiance just as it touched the land."|"The Sailor on the Seas of Fate"|"Michael Moorcock"
12:00|noon|"He climbed carefully and steadily, finding many footholds, and seemed to gain considerable height quite quickly, yet it was noon before he had reached the top and found himself standing at the edge of a broad, rocky plateau which fell away sharply to form a close horizon. Beyond the plateau was only the sky. Save for sparse, brownish grass, little grew here and there were no signs at all of human habitation."|"The Sailor on the Seas of Fate"|"Michael Moorcock"
12:00|noon|"Refreshed, the pair climbed over the boulders and left the river behind, ascending the slopes, speaking little so that their breath was saved for the exertion. It was noon by the time they reached the top of the valley and observed a plain not unlike the one which Elric had first crossed. Elric now had a fair idea of the island's geography: it resembled the top of a mountain, with an indentation near the center which was the valley. Again he became sharply aware of the absence of any wildlife and remarked on this to Count Smiorgan, who agreed that he had seen nothing-no bird, fish, nor beast since he had arrived."|"The Sailor on the Seas of Fate"|"Michael Moorcock"
12:00|noon|"And at noon they broke out of the forest and saw the ruins of R'lin K'ren A'a."|"The Sailor on the Seas of Fate"|"Michael Moorcock"
12:00|noon|"Outside in the middle of the square, at noon, still lay the lonely body of the last Vilmirian crewman."|"The Sailor on the Seas of Fate"|"Michael Moorcock"
