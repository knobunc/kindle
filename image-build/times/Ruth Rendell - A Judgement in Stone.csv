Very slowly Giles closed his copy of the Bhagavad Gita which had been propped against the marmalade pot, and with a kind of concentrated lethargy extended himself to his full, emaciated, bony height.

"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"George Coverdale was an exceptionally handsome man, classic-featured, as trim of figure as when he had rowed for his university in 1939. Of his three children, only one had inherited his looks, and Paula Caswall was not that one. A sweet expression and gentle eyes saved her from plainness, but pregnancy was not becoming to her, and she was in the eighth month of her second pregnancy. She had a vigorous mischievous little boy to look after, a fairly big house in Kensington to run, she was huge and tired and her ankles were swollen. Also she was frightened. Patrick’s birth had been a painful nightmare, and she looked forward to this coming delivery with dread. She would have preferred to see no one and have no one see her. But she realised that her house was the obvious venue for an interview with this London-based prospective housekeeper, and being endowed with the gracious manners of the Coverdales, she welcomed her stepmother affectionately, enthused over the daffodils, and complimented Jacqueline on her dress. They had lunch, and Paula listened with sympathy to Jacqueline’s doubts and forebodings about what would ensue at two o’clock."|"A Judgement in Stone"|"Ruth Rendell"

Patrick had gone for his afternoon sleep, and when the doorbell rang at two minutes to two Paula did no more than show the woman in the navy-blue raincoat into the living room. She left her to Jacqueline and went upstairs to lie down. But in those few seconds she spent with Eunice Parchman she felt a violent antipathy to her. Eunice affected her in that moment as she so often affected others. It was as if a coldness, almost an icy breath, emanated from her. Wherever she was, she brought a chill into the warm air. Later Paula was to remember this first impression and, in an agony of guilt, reproach herself for not warning her father, for not telling him of a wild premonition that was to prove justified. She did nothing. She went to her bedroom and fell into a heavy troubled sleep."|"A Judgement in Stone"|"Ruth Rendell"

It was only twenty past two and the interview was over.
Eunice said, “Thank you, madam. I can see myself out,” thus indicating, or so it seemed to Jacqueline, that she knew her place. She walked steadily from the room without looking back."|"A Judgement in Stone"|"Ruth Rendell"

Eunice Parchman answered the phone herself by giving the code correctly, followed by the four digits slowly and precisely enunciated.

The sun was shining, a wind was blowing, the whole kitchen was radiated with fluttering dancing sunbeams, and Melinda was off to the seaside with two boys and another girl in an orange and purple painted van. She picked up the note and. read it aloud. “What’s this? ‘Please would you be awfully kind and if you have the time press my yellow silk, the one with the pleated skirt. I want to wear it tonight.

Eunice fried (fried, not grilled) a big steak from the deep freeze, fried potatoes too, while the runner beans, the carrots, and the parsnips were boiling. Apple pudding and custard to follow, biscuits and cheese and strong black tea. She washed the dishes, dried them, and put them away. It was a relief not to be obliged to use that dishwasher.

Eunice went upstairs, drew her curtains, and settled down in deep contentment with her knitting in front of the screen.

She went downstairs and fetched herself jam sandwiches and a block of chocolate ice cream. At eight o’clock her favourite programme of the entire week was due to begin, a series about policemen in Los Angeles. It is hard to say why Eunice loved it so much. Certainly she confounded those analysts of escape channels who say that an audience must identify. Eunice couldn’t identify with the young police lieutenant or his twenty-year-old blonde girl friend or with the gangsters, tycoons, film stars, call girls, gamblers, and drunks, who abounded in each adventure. Perhaps it was the clipped harsh repartee she liked, the inevitable car chase and the indispensable shooting.

Eunice could only think of actually taking the list to the Stantwich store and handing the list to the manager. But how to get there? She knew there was a bus, but not where it stopped, only that the stop was two miles distant; not when it ran or where precisely it went or even where the shop was. Presently habit compelled her to stack the dishes in the washer, wipe clean the surfaces, go upstairs to make the beds and gaze sullenly at Giles’s Quote of the Month, which would have had a peculiarly ironical application to herself had she been able to understand it. Nine-fifteen. Eva Baalham didn’t come on Tuesdays, the milkman had already been. Not that Eunice would have dared expose herself by asking for enlightenment from these people.

But in the days that followed Vetch was often to wish that George’s watch had been broken by shot, for of all elements in a murder case he most disliked confusion over time, and the difficulty of fitting the facts to the times was to cause him much frustration."|"A Judgement in Stone"|"Ruth Rendell"
"ap > 07:30"|"after seven-thirty"|"According to the medical experts, the Coverdales and Giles Mont had met their deaths after seven-thirty and before nine-thirty, rigor mortis having already begun when the bodies were first examined at a quarter past midnight. Its onset is accelerated by heat, and the drawing room and kitchen had been very warm, for the central heating remained on all night at Lowfield Hall in the depths of winter. Many other factors were taken into consideration—stomach contents, post-mortem lividity, changes in cerebrospinal fluid—but Vetch could not persuade his experts to admit the possibility of death having occurred before half past seven. Not when that heat, a temperature of nearly eighty, was borne in mind, not in the face of Eunice’s evidence that the meal the Coverdales had eaten at six—tea and sandwiches and cake—had been completely digested. And Vetch himself thought it odd that a family who had eaten tea at six should start drinking coffee at, say, seven."|"A Judgement in Stone"|"Ruth Rendell"

"ap 07:50"|"ten to eight"|"Nevertheless, it could just be made to work out. The two youths in denim had come into the Blue Boar at ten to eight. That gave them fifteen minutes in which to kill the Coverdales—for what motive? For kicks? For some revenge against the social class the Coverdales represented?—and five minutes in which to leave the Hall and drive to Greeving. By the time Eunice came in at five to (or five past) eight, they were a mile away, leaving death and silence behind them."|"A Judgement in Stone"|"Ruth Rendell"

But Vetch believed she had never entered the Hall that evening, and with her he concerned himself only to check that Eunice had been correct in stating that the two of them had left the Epiphany Temple at seven-twenty. The brethren confirmed it, but not one of them told Vetch’s officers that Joan Smith had threatened George Coverdale’s life shortly before her departure. They hadn’t known it was George she was raving about, and if they had, the conduct and desires of the Epiphany People must be kept from policemen who were not of the elect."|"A Judgement in Stone"|"Ruth Rendell"
14:00|"two in the afternoon"|"It took place at two in the afternoon, and it was well attended. The press came and a few carefully chosen policemen. Brian Caswall came from London and Audrey Coverdale from the Potteries. Jeffrey Mont, the worse (or perhaps the better) for drink, was there, and so was Eunice Parchman. The Jameson-Kerrs, the Roystons, Mary Cairne, Baalhams, Meadowses, Higgses, and Newsteads. Under a blue sky, as brilliant as on the day Giles Caswall was christened, the closest mourners followed the rector from the church door along a little winding path to the southeast corner of the churchyard. Rugged elms and yew trees’ shade, and an east wind blowing. George Coverdale had bought a plot under those yews, and in this grave his body and the bodies of his wife and daughter were laid to rest."|"A Judgement in Stone"|"Ruth Rendell"
"ap 03:00"|three|"The car, Lovat said, had been for sale for eighty pounds, and he and Michael had gone up to Clacton by train to take a look at it.

"ap 07:00"|seven|"The flat tyre on the car having been changed for the spare one, he and Michael Scales decided to leave for home in it at seven, but not to take the A. 12 from Colchester, a fast road which would have taken them into East London. Instead they intended to go westwards to Sudbury and then south for Dunmow and Ongar, entering London by the A. 11 and the North Circular Road to Hendon. But before they left Michael was again playing with the dog, offering it a piece of chocolate and snatching it away when the dog came to take it. The result of this was that the dog bit him on his left hand."|"A Judgement in Stone"|"Ruth Rendell"
"ap ~ 07:40"|"About twenty to eight"|"They had turned into what was evidently Greeving Lane. The time? About twenty to eight, Lovat said. At the Blue Boar in Greeving Michael washed his hand and had a double brandy. They were directed to a self-service petrol station on the Sudbury road which, Lovat realised, was the road they had mistakenly left half an hour before."|"A Judgement in Stone"|"Ruth Rendell"
21:00|"nine in the evening"|"For the first time Lovat’s voice faltered. He hadn’t noticed a single house while driving along Greeving Lane. Strange, thought Vetch, when you remembered that Meadows’ farmhouse on its raised ground loomed over the only real bend in the road. But for the time being he let it pass, and Lovat went on to say that on the Tuesday he had realised it was he and Michael Scales for whom the police were hunting. He begged Michael to go with him to their local police station, but Michael, who had been in touch with Dick Scales by phone, refused. His hand had begun to fester and swell, and he hadn’t been to work since Wednesday. On Thursday morning Dick Scales phoned the Hendon house from a call box in the north of England, and when he heard of his son’s state he said he would call in on his way south. He reached Hendon at nine in the evening, and he and Michael and Keith Lovat had sat up all night, discussing what they should do. Dick wanted Michael to go to a doctor and say he had been bitten by a stray dog, mentioning nothing about the car or his visit to the caravan, and Michael was in favour of this. Lovat had been unable to make them see his point of view, that all the time they were getting themselves deeper into trouble and could be charged with obstructing the police. Moreover, he was prevented from having repairs done to the car and, as far as he could see, from using it perhaps for months. At last he decided to act on his own. When Dick had gone he walked out of the house and went to Hendon Police Station."|"A Judgement in Stone"|"Ruth Rendell"
"ap 07:40"|"Twenty to eight"|"It could be true. Lovat and Scales struck Vetch as being as pusillanimous and indecisive a pair as he had ever come across. Describe the house, he said, and Lovat said it was a big place with two long windows on either side of the front door, adding that he had heard music coming from the house as he hesitated on the drive. The time? Twenty to eight, said Lovat, and Scales said nearer a quarter to."|"A Judgement in Stone"|"Ruth Rendell"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"But the television set was in the morning room, and they couldn’t have been in the morning room from seven onwards, for they had taken coffee in the drawing room, and no amount of juggling with time could make that coffee drinking take place before seven. On the other hand, guilty or not, Lovat had said he had heard music. On Sunday afternoon Vetch broke the seals on the drawing-room door and revisited the scene of the crime. He was looking for signs that the television set had been in this room but, finding none, it occurred to him to check on the time the opera had begun. Vetch could easily have secured himself a copy of the Radio Times for that week from any newsagent. He still does not know to this day what made him pick up the Observer from the coffee table on the chance a Radio Times might have been underneath it. But it was. He opened it at the relevant page and noticed that page was splashed with blood. If anyone had previously observed this, he had not been told of it. In the margin, between and beneath the blood splashes, were three scribbled notes:"|"A Judgement in Stone"|"Ruth Rendell"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"Vetch had seen enough examples of Jacqueline’s handwriting to recognise that these notes had been made by her. And clearly they had been made by her while watching this particular broadcast. Therefore she had watched it or part of it. And, beyond a doubt, it had begun at seven. The only expert he had immediately to hand—and how much of an expert she was he couldn’t tell, he knew nothing of music—was Audrey Coverdale. He had the door resealed, and lingered for ten minutes to drink the tea Eunice Parchman had made for him. While he chatted with her and Eunice told him she had heard no music when she came in at five to (or five past) eight, that the television set was always in the morning room and had been in the morning room at the time of her discovery of the bodies, the Radio Times was a few feet from her, shut up in his briefcase."|"A Judgement in Stone"|"Ruth Rendell"
"ap 07:40"|"Twenty to eight"|"Twenty to eight. Vetch simply didn’t believe her. It was useless consulting amateurs. On Monday morning he sent his sergeant into Stantwich to buy a complete recording of the opera.
