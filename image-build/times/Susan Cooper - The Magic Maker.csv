"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"I wasn’t lonely, missing my parents — well, probably at first, but they kept you so busy. It was all rehearsals, going, going, going. Mitchell was a wonderful teacher. The way he trained our voices . . . it wasn’t the usual hootie-flootie sound that you hear in cathedrals in England, it had a ring to it. And he was an outstanding organist, a great technician, with all the repertoire including the then far-out music of Charles Tournamine, who’d been a pupil of César Franck. All the young organists about town used to turn up at our Evensong services, to hear Mitchell and his boy choir."|"The Magic Maker"|"Susan Cooper"
05:00|"five AM"|"Eventually Jack had a gig at CBS Radio as well. “My mother would pick me up at five AM and we’d be at CBS to perform by seven, along with all kinds of soloists and some awful poetry. . . . They’d pay me twenty dollars, or even fifty, and that was a lot then.” His repertoire included all the classic pieces then sung by boy sopranos, like “O for the Wings of a Dove,” but it also went way beyond. David Blair McCloskey, the singer-teacher who was John Fitzgerald Kennedy’s voice coach in his 1960 campaign, once reminisced about singing the baritone part in a performance of the Brahms Requiem in which young Jack Langstaff sang soprano."|"The Magic Maker"|"Susan Cooper"
"ap 00:00"|twelve|"Two years after Jack became a chorister, his brother Kennedy joined him. Since Ken had a tendency to sleepwalk, Jack was charged with looking after him. “He’d go toward the window, and I’d go and put a chair in his way.” Ken too had a beautiful voice, but he had not been given his brother’s sense that his voice was his identity. He was much less restrained than Jack in expressing his longing to be back at 39 Garden Place. Esther Langstaff kept every letter that her children ever wrote her, and after they had grown up she chose the letters she felt should be preserved, typed them all out, and had them compiled in seven leather-bound books. The two elder boys’ letters from choir school show a telling contrast.
Here is Jack at twelve, writing home on Mother’s Day 1933.

So we’d hide these, and then we’d have feasts, at night. About two thirty or three in the morning, we’d go down the corridor very quietly and sit and eat.”"|"The Magic Maker"|"Susan Cooper"

"ap 08:00"|eight|"An outstanding boy soprano does not necessarily find himself with a wonderful adult voice, but at eighteen Jack was drawing as much attention as he had at eight. When Choate joined forces with several other schools for a concert at the enormous Bushnell Hall in Hartford, Connecticut, he was the star of the evening. And his instincts as a performer took care of him even before a packed house of 2,800."|"The Magic Maker"|"Susan Cooper"

06:00|"six AM"|"Jack wrote that he was duty officer that evening, appointed to make hourly inspections of the whole camp until six AM. “The cooks just brought me over a big GI pitcher full of strong coffee and a whole pumpkin pie — both are sitting on the radiator in readiness for my midnight feast!” After this reminder of boarding school, he then tried to explain to his brothers the things that he had learned about, and from, the men in his charge — men who came from the world outside 39 Garden Place, Brooklyn Heights, and whose mothers were not acquainted with musicians or generals."|"The Magic Maker"|"Susan Cooper"

00:00|midnight|"On went the dancing, at the Country Dance Society’s party, until everyone went home exhausted and happy at midnight. It must have been like a dance-focused version of the Langstaff family carol party, just as joyous, just as unforgettable. And its mixture of folk dance, folk song, and the spoken word stayed in Jack’s mind and fermented. In 1957, two years after he began teaching at Potomac, he wove the three major elements into a more complicated pattern and took it public."|"The Magic Maker"|"Susan Cooper"
00:00|midnight|"There was the midnight sun, you know? Kids playing football at two o’clock in the morning. And outside a house I heard this amazing sound, music like I had never heard before, and I found five old women sitting on a bench singing folk song. I can still see them, outdoors there, singing. It was the real Russian folk song, from the old days — the old people had kept it alive."|"The Magic Maker"|"Susan Cooper"
