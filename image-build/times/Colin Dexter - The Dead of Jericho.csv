"~ 02:45"|"about 2.45 a.m."|"As it happened Walters had been unusually unlucky that day. But life can sometimes be a cussed business, and even a policeman with a considerably greater endowment of nous than Walters possessed
  must hope for a few lucky breaks here and there. And, indeed, Walters was no one’s fool. As he lay beside his young wife in Kidlington that night, there were several points that now appeared
  clear to him. Bell was quite right – there was no doubt about it: the Scott woman had hanged herself, albeit for reasons as yet unapparent. But there were several fishy (fishy?) aspects about
  the affair. The bridge evening (evening?) had finally finished at about 2.45 a.m., and almost certainly Anne Scott had gone home shortly after that. How, though? Got a lift with someone?
  In a taxi? On a bicycle? (He’d forgotten to put the point to the garish Gwendola.) And then something had gone sadly wrong. Time of death could not be firmly established, but the medical
  report suggested she had been dead at least ten hours before the police arrived, and that meant . . . But Walters wasn’t quite sure what it meant. Then again there was the business of the
  front door being left open. Why? Had she forgotten to lock it? Unlikely, surely. Had someone else unlocked it, then? If so, the key on the inside must first have been removed. Wasn’t that
  much more likely, though? He himself always took the key out of his own front door and placed it by the telephone on the hall table. Come to think of it, he wasn’t quite sure why he did it.
  Just habit, perhaps. Three keys . . . Three keys . . . and one of them must have opened that door. And if it wasn’t Anne Scott herself and if it wasn’t Mrs Purvis . . .
  Jackson! What if Jackson had gone in, unlocking the door with his own key, called out for Ms Scott, heard no reply, and so walked through – into the kitchen! Jackson would know all about that
  sticking door because he’d been through it at least twice on each of the two previous days. And what if . . . what if he’d . . . Yes! The chair must have been in the way and he would
  almost certainly have knocked it over as he pushed the door inwards . . . would probably have picked it up and placed it by the kitchen table before turning round and— Phew! That would
  explain it all, wouldn’t it? Well, most of it. Yet why, if that had happened, hadn’t Jackson phoned the police immediately? There was a phone there, in number 9. Had Jackson
  felt guilty about something? Had there been something – money, perhaps? – in the kitchen that his greedy soul had coveted? It must have been something like that. Then, of
  course, there was that other mystery: Morse! For it must have been Morse whom Jackson had seen there that day. What on earth was he doing there earlier in the afternoon? Was he
  taking German lessons? Walters thought back to those oddly tentative, yet oddly searching questions that Morse had asked that night. ‘Is she – is she dead?’ Morse had
  asked him. Just a minute! How on earth . . .? Had one of the policemen outside mentioned who it was they’d found? But no one could have done, for there was no one else who knew . . . Suddenly
  Walters shot bolt upright, jumped out of bed, slipped downstairs, and with fingers all thumbs, riffled through the telephone directory until he came to the M’s. Rubbing his eyes with
  disbelief he stared again and again at the entry he’d been looking for: ‘Morse, E., 45 The Flats, Banbury Road’. Morse! ‘E.M.’! Was it Morse who’d been
  expected that afternoon? Steady on, though! There were a thousand and one other people with those initials – of course there were. But Morse had been there that afternoon –
  Walters was now quite sure in his own mind of that. It all fitted. Those questions he’d asked about doors and locks and lights – yes, he’d been there, all right. Now if Morse had
  a key and if he, not Jackson, had found his way through into the kitchen . . . Why hadn’t he reported it, then? Money wouldn’t fit into the picture now, but what if somehow
  Morse had . . . what if Morse was frightened he might compromise himself in some strange way if he reported things immediately? He’d rung later, of course – that would have been his
  duty as a police officer . . . Walters returned to bed but could not sleep. He was conscious of his eyeballs darting about in their sockets, and it was in vain that he tried to focus them on some
  imaginary point about six inches in front of his nose. Only in the early hours did he finally drift off into a disturbed sleep, and the most disturbing thought of all was what, if anything, he was

  raison d’être for his presence in the area, but also to down a couple of double Scotches. Once inside the yard, he turned immediately to his left and felt his way along the
  brick wall, treading cautiously amid the petrol drums, the wooden spars, and the assorted, derelict debris of old canal barges. There was no one about, and the boatman’s hut just ahead of him

  own investigations, and revealed that after working late in St Aldates that night he had been on his way to return the few items taken from Canal Reach when he had seen the yellow glow flitting
  about the dark and silent rooms. Throughout Walters’ somewhat discontinuous narrative, Morse remained silent, attentive, and seemingly impassive. When Walters had mentioned the strange
  discoveries of the chair in the kitchen and the key on the doormat, Morse had nodded noncommittally, as though the incidents were either of little moment or perfectly explicable. Only during

  briefcase, and dressed in grey flannels and a check-patterned sports coat, who joined the bus queue for Banbury Road; and as the boy turned Morse could see the black tie, with its diagonal red
  stripes, of Magdalen College School. Games afternoon, perhaps? Morse immediately stopped outside the nearest shop, and divided his attention between watching the boy and examining the brown shoes
  (left foot only) that rested on the ‘Reduced’ racks. Edward Murdoch himself seemed restless. He consulted his wristwatch every thirty seconds or so, punctuating this impatience with a
  craning-forward to read the numbers on the buses as they wheeled round Carfax into Corn-market. Five minutes later, he felt inside his sports jacket for his wallet, picked up his briefcase, left
  the queue, and disappeared into a tiny side street between a jeweller’s shop and Woolworths. There, pulling off his tie and sticking it in his pocket, he walked down the steps of the entrance

  able to have a word with the chairman of the OBA about Anne Scott had finally tilted the balance in favour of ‘Charles Richards: Triumphs and Tribulations of the Small
  Publisher’. It took only a few minutes for Morse to feel glad he had made the effort to attend. It was not (in Morse’s eyes) that this thickishly set man, of medium height, had a
  particularly forceful presence – although, to be fair, his expensively cut dark blue suit lent a certain air of elegance and rank. It was his manner of speaking that was impressive.
  In his quietly spoken, witty, tolerant, self-deprecatory way, Richards spoke of his early days as a schoolmaster, his life-long interest in books, the embryonic idea of starting up for himself as a
  small publisher, his first, fairly disastrous months, his ladling of luck as time went by, with a few minor coups here and there, and finally the expansion of his company and the recent move to
  Abingdon. In his peroration he quoted Kipling (much to Morse’s delight), and exhorted his listeners to treat that poet’s ‘twin impos-ters’ with the same degree of amused

"ap 04:30"|four-thirty|"Morse had been a little surprised when earlier in the week, after seeking an interview with his Assistant Chief Commissioner, he learned that the ACC, in turn, would welcome a
  little chat with Morse, and that ‘a cup of tea up at my little place at Beckley’ would make a pleasant rendezvous. At four-thirty, therefore, on that sunny October afternoon, the two
  men sat on a weedless lawn overlooking the broad, green sweep of Otmoor, and Morse recounted to his senior officer the irregularities and improprieties of his own investigations over the previous
  fortnight. The ACC was silent for a long time, and the answer, when it finally came from those rather bloated lips, was unexpected."|"The Dead of Jericho"|"Colin Dexter"

"~ 18:30"|"about 6.30 p.m."|"AS HE DROVE back to Oxford that lunch-time, Morse thought about Celia Richards. She had told her tale with a courageous honesty and Morse had no doubt
  whatsoever that it was true. During her husband’s earlier liaisons with Anne Scott, Celia had no shred of evidence to corroborate her suspicions, although there had been (she knew) much
  whispered rumour in the company. She could have been mistaken – or so she’d told herself repeatedly; and when Anne left she had felt gradually more reassured. At the very
  least, whatever there might have been between the pair of them had gone for good now – surely! Until, that is, that terrible day only a few weeks earlier when, with Charles confined to bed
  with ’flu, she had gone into the office to see Conrad, Charles’s younger brother and co-partner, who worked on the floor above him. On Charles’s desk, beneath a heavy glass
  paperweight, lay a letter, a letter written in a hand that was known to her, a letter marked ‘Strictly Personal and Private’. And even at that very moment she had known, deep inside
  herself, the hurtful, heart-piercing truth of it all, and she had taken the letter and opened it in her car outside. It was immediately clear that Charles had already seen Anne Scott several times
  since the move to Abingdon, and the letter begged him to go to see her again – quickly, urgently. Anne was in some desperate sort of trouble and he, Charles, was the only person she could
  turn to. Money was involved – and this was stated quite explicitly; but above all she had to see him again. She had kept (she claimed) all the letters he had written to her, and
  suggested that if he didn’t do as she wished she might have (as far as Celia could recall the exact words) ‘to do something off her own bat which would hurt him’. She hated
  herself for doing it, but if threats were the only way, then threats it had to be. Celia had destroyed the letter – and taken her decision immediately: she herself would go to visit her
  husband’s former lover. And she had done so. On Wednesday, 3rd October, Charles said he had a meeting and had taken the Mini to work, telling her not to expect him home before about 6.30 p.m.
  The Rolls had been almost impossible to park – even the double yellow lines were taken up; but finally she had found a space and had walked up Canal Reach, up to number 9, where she found the
  door unlocked. (‘Yes, Inspector, I’m absolutely sure. I had no key – and how else could I have got in?’) Inside, there was no one. She had shouted. No one. Upstairs she had
  found the study immediately, and within a few minutes found, too, a pile of letters tied together in one of the drawers – all written to Anne by Charles. Somehow up until that point, she had
  felt an aggression and a purpose which had swamped all fears of discovery. But now she felt suddenly frightened – and then, oh God! the next two minutes were an unbearable nightmare. For
  someone had come in; had shouted Anne’s name; had even stood at the foot of the stairs! Never in the whole of her life had she felt so petrified with fear!"|"The Dead of Jericho"|"Colin Dexter"
15:40|"3.40 p.m."|"So it was that Lewis rang the number Morse gave him, discovered that Mrs Celia Richards was at home, and arranged to meet her that same afternoon. It seemed to Lewis an unnecessary duplication
  of mileage, but he forbore to make the point. As for Morse, his interest in the Richards clan appeared to be waning, and at 3.40 p.m. he found himself entering 10 Canal Reach – though he
  couldn’t have told anyone exactly why."|"The Dead of Jericho"|"Colin Dexter"
21:30|"9.30 p.m."|"Later that same evening Conrad Richards drove his brother Charles to Gatwick Airport. The plane was subject to no delay, either technical or operational, and at 9.30 p.m.
  Charles Richards took his seat in a British Airways DC 10 – bound for Madrid."|"The Dead of Jericho"|"Colin Dexter"
08:45|"8.45 a.m."|"THE NEXT MORNING, two box files, the one red and the other green, lay on the desk at Kidlington, marked ‘Anne Scott’ and ‘George
  Jackson’ respectively. They remained unopened as Morse sat contemplating the task before him. He felt it most unlikely that he was going to discover many more significant pieces to the puzzle
  posed by the deaths of two persons separated only by a few yards in a mean little street in Jericho. That the two deaths were connected, however, he had no doubt at all; and the fact that the
  precise connection was still eluding him augured ill for the cheerful Lewis who entered the office at 8.45 a.m."|"The Dead of Jericho"|"Colin Dexter"
"ap ~ 07:45"|"about quarter to eight"|"‘Ye-es.’ For a few seconds Morse’s excitement seemed on the wane, and he sat down once again. ‘But if they wrote to her the day before she – Lewis! Ring up the Post

‘It’ll be about quarter to eight – eightish.’
‘You think?’ asked Morse, rather weakly."|"The Dead of Jericho"|"Colin Dexter"

  if there was any news and she had been told that as soon as the report was through a letter would be in the post – which it had been on Tuesday, 2nd October: pregnancy was confirmed. The
  Jericho post was delivered somewhat variably, but during the week in question almost all letters would have been delivered by 8.30 a.m. Only with the Richards’ query had Lewis experienced any
  difficulty. No reply from Charles’s private residence; and at the business number, a long delay before the call was transferred to Conrad Richards, the junior partner, who informed Lewis that
  the company had indeed moved to Abingdon about three months ago: to be exact, twelve weeks and four days."|"The Dead of Jericho"|"Colin Dexter"
"~ 03:00"|"about 3 a.m."|"‘Indeed! I think you’ll agree that the main facts hang pretty well together now. Anne Scott goes to a bridge evening the night before she kills herself, and I’m certain she
  learns something there that’s the final straw to a long and cumulative emotional strain. She writes a note to Edward Murdoch, telling him she can’t see him for a lesson the next
  afternoon, and from that point the die is cast. She gets home about 3 a.m. or thereabouts, and we shall never know how she spends the next few hours. But whatever doubt or hesitation she may have
  felt is finally settled by the Wednesday morning post, when a letter arrives from the birth clinic. She burns the letter and she – hangs herself."|"The Dead of Jericho"|"Colin Dexter"

  ‘Oh dear!’, the occasional ‘I am sorry’, as he stood staring blankly at the grass verge. Fortunately the dog came to his rescue, and Morse felt relieved as the

  towels. A cosmopolitan room – a little antiseptic and anaemic, perhaps, but moderately expensive and adequately cosy. Two separate lights were affixed to the wall just above the headboard of
  the double bed, though neither was turned on as Charles Richards lay on his back, his left hand behind his head, smoking silently. He wasn’t sure of the exact time, but he thought it must be
  about 7.30 a.m, and he had been awake for over an hour. Beside him, her back towards him, lay a young woman, the mauve-striped sheet draped closely round her naked body. Occasionally she stirred
  slightly and once or twice her lips had mumbled somnolent endearments. But Charles Richards felt no erotic stirrings towards her that morning. For much of the time as he lay there he was thinking
  of his wife, and wondering sadly why it was that now, when she was willing to let him go, his thoughts kept drifting back to her. She had not cried or created any scene when at last the truth of
  his relations with Anne Scott had been forced into the open. But her eyes had betrayed her hurt and disappointment, and a hardness that made her face seem older and plainer; yet later she had
  looked so tender and so very vulnerable that he had almost found himself falling in love with her afresh. She had said little, apart from a few practical suggestions about the days immediately
  ahead: she was proud and wounded. He wondered where exactly she was at that moment. Almost certainly back home from Cambridge by now. And if she was, her bed would already have been made up neatly,
