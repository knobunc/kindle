12:00|midday|"It was long past the hour for midday dinner. Very few patrons sat at the long tables, silhouetted like ghosts against the fiery red bed of coals. In the dimness Fenton’s hands went unnoticed despite their bloodstains."|"The Devil in Velvet"|"John Dickson Carr"
"ap 01:00"|"one of the clock"|"“Why, as to that,” he said, and reached up under the back of his coat to wipe greasy hands on his satin waistcoat, so as to have the stains out of sight, “my lord is there on most afternoons. Save when the Lords sit, or His Majesty’s council. Come, I had forgot! My lord is always at the King’s Head on Tuesdays,” added George, forgetting this was a Tuesday, “from one of the clock until midnight. He …”"|"The Devil in Velvet"|"John Dickson Carr"

22:00|"ten o’clock that night"|"At ten o’clock that night, after being dressed by Giles, Fenton went out into the upstairs passage, now dimly lighted by a few wall sconces. He wore his usual loose, comfortable, sombre-hued velvet, and shoes now made to his liking. Giles was always in agony at his lack of jewelled rings, diamond waistcoat buttons, even lack of more than a plain laced neckband."|"The Devil in Velvet"|"John Dickson Carr"
12:00|noon|"Punctually at noon, as always, he took a key and opened the locked cabinet in an under part of one bookcase in the study. With another very small key he unlocked the book of days, which he had never shown to another person."|"The Devil in Velvet"|"John Dickson Carr"
00:00|midnight|"Dipping the pen carefully in the ink, he wrote the date June 6th, though he did not consider it was past until midnight."|"The Devil in Velvet"|"John Dickson Carr"
"> 12:00"|"past noon"|"Then, on the following morning, they lounged abed until past noon. Fenton had to go into the City on business in the afternoon. What he noted in his diary was the 7th of June."|"The Devil in Velvet"|"John Dickson Carr"
"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"Since by some (to him) miracle, Big Tom had repaired the shattered bedroom door before noon, he hastened up for last instructions."|"The Devil in Velvet"|"John Dickson Carr"
"ap 10:00"|"ten of the clock"|"“No! Never! That will warn them we expect them, if indeed they come. Every man to his bed, until roused. Let Harry stand watch; all lights gone by ten of the clock. And—and no word of this to my lady.”"|"The Devil in Velvet"|"John Dickson Carr"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"That night they went to bed before ten o’clock, in Lydia’s room as always. Still the sky was a hollow of thick heat; outside the windows, each leaf stood as still as though limned there."|"The Devil in Velvet"|"John Dickson Carr"
12:00|noon|"At noon, when he wrote in the date of June 9th for today, he went to one of the open windows of the study, which faced out on green shrubbery, and smoked his long pipe until the bowl burnt his fingers. As he looked back on that fight on the night of the 7th, and what happened when the file of dragoons splashed up in the rain, he could smile again."|"The Devil in Velvet"|"John Dickson Carr"
00:00|midnight|"An outside poisoner? Very well; but what could the enemy do? Lydia’s danger point began only with the stroke of midnight tonight, which would become the 10th. And he first ate half her food and drank of her wine. She refused to touch anything when he was from home."|"The Devil in Velvet"|"John Dickson Carr"
"ap 06:55"|"five minutes to seven"|"With his left hand he took from his waistcoat pocket one of the huge, thick watches, and opened its case. The hands stood at five minutes to seven. Outside the windows lay clear daylight."|"The Devil in Velvet"|"John Dickson Carr"
"ap 07:30"|"half-past seven"|"He had almost lost his anxiety as to time, as a quick look at his watch told him it was only half-past seven. He felt eager and alert. He had forgotten the ache of his bruises, even when someone jostled him. There was so much, so much, of which he must warn the King!"|"The Devil in Velvet"|"John Dickson Carr"
"ap > 10:00"|"past Ten of the Clock"|"“He hath but a minute gone from me (in hys owne Bedchamber), where he saith my Ilnesse may be cur’d by a Doctor of Physick. But he is gone below-stayres to give a Brisking to the Sarvants, poor Wretches, with a good Cat-of-Nine-Tayles. I fynde time to write these, at past Ten of the Clock. The Brisking, as I think, may be above an Houre. You will fynde him in Ded Man’s Lane, as He so said in my Hearing, which I take to be Strand, sure between Noone and One of the Clock; it may be earlier or later.

"ap 08:30"|eight-thirty|"He remembered how, as he went out from Whitehall Palace into Pebble Court, with torches shining about and the great coach in attendance, he had taken out his watch. He was astonished to find the hour was not quite eight-thirty. All his audience with the King, all that went into it, had taken less than an hour."|"The Devil in Velvet"|"John Dickson Carr"

23:30|"half before midnight"|"But he made his preparations too. It was almost three hours and a half before midnight; Lydia’s true danger began on the stroke of midnight, the tenth. Not once did he think of striding down to her bedroom, bursting in, and flinging that letter at her as accusation."|"The Devil in Velvet"|"John Dickson Carr"

"ap 08:50"|"ten minutes to nine"|"It was ten minutes to nine. Already he had come to one resolve. He sprang up again, putting his watch back into his pocket. At the same time there was a light knock on the door."|"The Devil in Velvet"|"John Dickson Carr"

00:00|Midnight|"Lydia! Midnight! He had promised to return before then! With fingers all thumbs, he shakily drew his watch out of his pocket. His arm trembled, and the watch almost slipped from his fingers. His tired eyes, by firelight, could not read the numbers on the dial. But it could not possibly be very late."|"The Devil in Velvet"|"John Dickson Carr"
00:00|midnight|"“Yes, yes, yes!” cried Fenton. “Tomorrow, beginning with midnight, will be June 10th. Yet must I be there from the stroke of midnight, lest harm befall Lydia!”"|"The Devil in Velvet"|"John Dickson Carr"
"ap 09:30"|nine-thirty|"Fenton raced forward towards the dying fire, holding the open case and dial of the watch towards red lumps and red embers. The watch had stopped at nine-thirty, the very time he crossed Meg’s threshold."|"The Devil in Velvet"|"John Dickson Carr"

00:00|MIDNIGHT|"CHAPTER XXII
THE WOMAN AT MIDNIGHT:
A NAME IS PUT TO THE POISONER
ON FENTON’S TABLE there was a great trencher of food and a bottle of wine, evidently left for him while he slept; the food as cold as charity. He picked up the heavy chair, weighed it in his hands, and decided it would do as a weapon."|"The Devil in Velvet"|"John Dickson Carr"
00:00|midnight|"“Stab my belly,” yelled another voice from the window of the Wakefield Tower, “but too long we’ve abused Sir Robert’s hospitality. It must be the quarter-hour to midnight.”"|"The Devil in Velvet"|"John Dickson Carr"

"ap > 08:30"|"after half-past eight of the clock"|"“Now do you recollect it! You came to your bedchamber close after half-past eight of the clock. Or say by your watch, which you put down on the dressing table. Of late you had grown accustomed to take a good deal of claret at supper; and you kept a decanter of claret, with goblet, on your dressing table. Now speak! Was that decanter full to the stopper, or no?”"|"The Devil in Velvet"|"John Dickson Carr"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"“The time was short, so very brief! You were in Lydia’s bedchamber but two minutes, entering shortly beyond twenty minutes towards the hour of nine. Now ask of yourself but what a cunning magistrate would ask!”"|"The Devil in Velvet"|"John Dickson Carr"

"ap 08:50"|"ten minutes to nine"|"“More! With so monstrous great a quantity of arsenic, the pain would come well within eight minutes; on Lydia, it worked swifter than with most. All was squeezed and compressed into brief seconds. The murderer had returned to his bedchamber. Judith Pamphlin, upon her coming upstairs, did in truth hear Lydia moan even before my wits were unsealed, and I awoke. And this, I think, was at ten minutes to nine. True?”"|"The Devil in Velvet"|"John Dickson Carr"
"ap > 10:00"|"after ten o’clock"|"Fenton was conscience-stricken. He must not keep the child up after ten o’clock, or her parents would worry. Nevertheless, even as he escorted her to the front door, he felt piqued that she made no comment."|"The Devil in Velvet"|"John Dickson Carr"
"ap > 08:00"|"Past eight of the clock"|"“How late?”
“Past eight of the clock. And Lord George will be here soon.”
“D’ye call that late?” asked Fenton, simulating a yawn and a half-boozy eye. “Be quick, carrot-pate: What’s the day and the month? If it comes to that, ecod, what’s the year?”"|"The Devil in Velvet"|"John Dickson Carr"
"> 00:00"|"Past midnight"|"“Then last night,” reflected Fenton, “was a part of this morning. Past midnight, of course!” The devil always kept his bargains to the letter, if not to the spirit. And Lord George, naturally, must be George Harwell, second son of the Earl of Bristol; he was Sir Nick’s closest friend and boon companion."|"The Devil in Velvet"|"John Dickson Carr"
12:00|noon|"“I did not go down to table. I could partake only of a bowl of sack posset, which the chambermaid carried up to me each day at noon precisely. Yet even the sack posset—not each day, but on occasion—did near to double me up: oh, most horrid!”"|"The Devil in Velvet"|"John Dickson Carr"
