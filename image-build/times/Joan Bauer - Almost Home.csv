19:00|"seven at night"|"I’m trying to picture Shush as a mighty guard dog helping the helpless, but that’s as big a reach as Mr. Leeland being a fine gentleman.

“Sugar, did your mom know she was supposed to be at work at 7:30?”
“She knew,” I whisper."|"Almost Home"|"Joan Bauer"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"Leona shook her head and went back to sweeping. I walked in the front door, wiped my feet on the welcome mat that read GO AWAY, and walked past her collection of cuckoo clocks. It was exactly three o’clock, and all the cuckoos went crazy."|"Almost Home"|"Joan Bauer"
