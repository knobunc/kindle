12:00|noonday|"THE HANDLESS SHADOWS hung long in the noonday sun, lifeless as their bodies, slightly twitching, swaying in the breeze. Slowly, as the boats sailed away, the shadowsâ€™ twitches became more pronounced. And then they became movements. And the movements became dancing. And finally the shadows wrestled away from their bodies, loosed from the moorings of their mortal shells, free to roam and stand up on their own, no longer bound to the flat of the ground. They stood up, square faced, boxy, and malformed, racing for the nearest pools of shadow before the sun could strike them down."|"Queen of the Dark Things"|"C. Robert Cargill"
12:00|midday|"One of the only things more depressing than the current state of the Cursed and the Damned was seeing it cower in the alley from daylight. Though it had no windows, there was something about the harsh, stinging light of midday waiting just outside the door that made it all the more sad. Bars were places meant to be refuges from the dark, not suppliers of it. While it was easy to forget the time of day, and buy into the shadows of the piss-poor lighting and dim booths, all that goodwill went away the moment you stepped into the bustling afternoon of downtown."|"Queen of the Dark Things"|"C. Robert Cargill"
12:00|noonday|"This was no normal light. This was raw, lambent dreamstuff, brighter even than the sun. The whole landscape lit up with the fire, blazing like noonday, incinerating every bit of brush nearby."|"Queen of the Dark Things"|"C. Robert Cargill"
00:00|midnight|"Yashar and Colby ran out into the midnight alley, the air gamy with rotting fish, standing paces away from both the Dumpster in which they were laid to rest and the door to the Cursed and the Damned. The city blazed halogen orange, spilling faintly into the narrow access."|"Queen of the Dark Things"|"C. Robert Cargill"
"ap 02:00"|two|"Colby sat at a wobbly metal kitchen table, easily sixty years old, its lacquered top whittled down and chipped in places. The chairs were mismatched, some almost as old as the table, others decades newer but in no better condition. The man opened a rounded, avocado-green icebox, older than anything else in the kitchen, and pulled from it two, frosty, ice-cold beers."|"Queen of the Dark Things"|"C. Robert Cargill"
