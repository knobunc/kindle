"ap 02:58"|"two of three"|"The Vietnam War isn't nearly as contentious as some other issues from the recent past; 
        today more than two of three adult Americans consider the war to have been morally wrong 
        as well as tactically inept.50 More controversial is the women's movement. Every school district includes parents who 
        strongly affirm traditional sex roles and other parents who do not. Homosexuality is even 
        more taboo as a subject of discussion or learning. Raising the topic of affirmative action 
        leads to angry debates. A negative evaluation of the Carter or Reagan administrations 
        would surely offend some Democratic or Republican patents, respectively, Mel and Norma 
        Gabler, who organize right-wingers to pressure textbook publishers, seek to make labor 
        unions and the National Council of Churches too controversial for authors and publishers 
        even to mention. Since all parents have opinions about events they lived through, teachers 
        and authors may feel they must approach most topics in the sasha with extreme caution. The 
        result is a history of the recent past along the line suggested by Thumper's mom: “Ifyou can't say 
        somethin' nice, don't say nothin' at all.” Unsurprisingly, only 2 to 4 percent of college 
        students say that they had any substantial treatment of the Vietnam War in high school."|"Lies My Teacher Told Me"|"James W. Loewen"
05:00|lauds|"Other textbook authors have shared similar comments with me. They want to produce good 
        citizens, by which they mean people who take pride in their country. Somehow authors feel 
        they must strap on the burden of transmitting and defending Western civilization. 
        Sometimes there was almost a touch of desperation in their commentssort of an “apres moi, 
        le deluge.” Authors can feel that they get only one shot at these children; if they do not 
        reach them now, America's future might be jeopardized. In turn, this leads to a feeling of 
        selfimportancethat one is on the front line of our society, helping the United States 
        continue to grow strong. Not only textbook authors feel this way: historians and history 
        teachers commonly cite their role in building good citizens to justify what they da In “A 
        Proud Word for History,” Allan Nevins waxes euphoric over “school texts that told of 
        Plymouth Rock, Valley Forge, and the Alamo,” He lauds history's role in making a nation 
        strong. “Developing in the young such traits as character, morals, ethics, and good 
        citizenship,” according lo Richard Gross, former president of the National Council for the 
        Social Studies, “are the reasons for studying history and the social sciences.”58 When we were writing our Mississippi history my coauthors and I felt the same way that we 
        mighc improve our state and its citizens by imparting knowledge and changing attitudes in 
        its next generation."|"Lies My Teacher Told Me"|"James W. Loewen"
"~ 13:11"|"around 1311"|"When Columbus reached Haiti, he found the Arawaks in possession of some spear points made 
        of “guanine.” The Indians said they got them from black traders who had come from ihe 
        south and east. Guanine proved to be an alloy of gold, silver, and copper, identical to 
        the gold alloy preferred by West Africans, who also called it “guanine.” Islamic 
        historians have recorded stories of voyages west from Mali in West Africa around 1311, 
        during the reign of Mansa Bakari II. From time to time in ihe fourteenth and fifteenth 
        centuries, shipwrecked African vessels-remnants, presumably, of transatlantic 
        tradewashed up on Cape Verde. From contacts in West Africa, the Portuguese heard that 
        African traders were visiting Brazil in the mid-1400s; this knowledge may have influenced 
        Portugal to insist on moving the pope's “line of demarcation” further west in the Treaty 
        of Tordesillas (1494). Traces of diseases common in Africa have been detected in pre-Columbian corpses in Brazil. 
        Columbus's son Ferdinand, who accompanied the admiral on his third voyage, reports that 
        people they met or heard about in eastern Honduras “are almost black in color, ugly in 
        aspect,” probably Africans. The first Europeans to reach Panama-Balboa and 
        company-reported seeing black slaves in an Indian town. The Indians said they had captured 
        them from a nearby black community. Oral history from Afro-Mexicans contains tales of 
        pre-Columbian crossings from West Africa. In all, then, data from diverse sources suggest 
        that pre-Columbian voyages from West Africa to America were probable."|"Lies My Teacher Told Me"|"James W. Loewen"
"ap 23:54"|"six of twelve"|"To make a better myth, six of twelve textbooks exaggerate the crew's complaints into a 
        near-mutiny. The primary sources differ. Some claim the sailors threatened to go back home 
        if they didn't reach land soon. Other sources claim that Columbus lost heart and that the 
        captains of the other two ships persuaded him to keep on. Still other sources suggest 
        that the three leaders met and agreed to continue on for a few more days and then reassess 
        the situation. After studying the matter, Columbus's biographer Samuel Eliot Mortson reduced the complaints to 
        mere griping: “They were all getting on each other's nerves, as happens even nowadays,”46 So much for the crew's threat to throw Columbus overboard."|"Lies My Teacher Told Me"|"James W. Loewen"
"> 18:15"|"after 1815"|"From the opposite coast, here is a story that might help make such dispersal 
        understandable: “An old white settler told his son who was writing about life on the 
        Oregon frontier about an incident he recalled from the cowboys and Indians days. Some 
        cowboys came upon Indian families without their men present. The cowboys gave pursuit, 
        planning to rape the squaws, as was the custom. One woman, however, pushed sand into her 
        vagina to thwart her pursuers.”65 The act of resistance is what made the incident memorable. Otherwise, it was entirely 
        ordinary. Such ordinariness is what our textbooks leave out. They do not challenge our 
        archetypal Laura Ingalls Wilder picture of peaceful white settlers suffering occasional 
        attacks by brutal Indians, If they did, the fact thai so many tribes resorted to war, even 
        after 1815 when resistance was clearly doomed, would become understandable."|"Lies My Teacher Told Me"|"James W. Loewen"
05:34|"534 hours"|"Perhaps the most pervasive theme in our history is the domination of black America by 
        white America. Race is the sharpest and deepest division in American life. Issues of 
        black-white relations propelled the Whig Party to collapse, prompted the formation of 
        the Republican Party, and caused the Democratic Party to label itself the “white man's 
        party” for almost a century. The first time Congress ever overrode a presidential veto was 
        for the 1866 Civil Rights Act, passed by Republicans over the wishes of Andrew Johnson. Senators mounted the longest 
        filibuster in U.S. history, more than 534 hours, to oppose the 1964 Civil Rights bill. 
        Thomas Byrne Edsall has shown how race prompted the sweeping political realignment of 
        1964-72, in which the white South went from a Democratic bastion to a Republican stronghold.6 Race still affects politics, as evidenced by the notorious Willie Horton commercial used 
        by George Bush in the 1988 presidential campaign and the more recent candidacies of the Ku 
        Klux Klan leader David Duke, Race riots continue to shake urban centers from Miami to Los 
        Angeles."|"Lies My Teacher Told Me"|"James W. Loewen"
"ap 23:54"|"Six of twelve"|"With the exception of The American Way and Discovering, American History, each of the twelve textbooks includes at least a paragraph on white violence during 
        Reconstruction. Six of twelve textbooks tell how that violence, coupled with failure by 
        the United States to implement civil rights laws, played a major role in ending Republican 
        state governments in the South, thus ending Reconstruction. Hut, overall, textbook treatments of Reconstruction still miss the point: the problem of 
        Reconstruction was integrating Conjvdfrates, not African Americans, into the new order. As soon as the federal government stopped addressing the 
        problem of racist whites, Reconstruction ended. Since textbooks find it hard to say 
        anything really damaging about white people, their treatments of why Reconstruction 
        failed lack clarity. Triumph presents the end of construction as a failure of African Americans: “Other northerners 
        grew weary of the problems of black southerners and less willing to help them learn their 
        new roles ;is citizens.” The American Adventure echoes: ""Millions of ex-slaves could not be converted in ten years into literate voters, or 
        successful politicians,"|"Lies My Teacher Told Me"|"James W. Loewen"
00:00|midnight|"The treatment of Brown, like the treatment of slavery and Reconstruction, has changed in 
        American history textbooks. From 1890 to about 1970, John Brown was insane. Before 1890 he 
        was perfectly sane, and after 1970 he regained his sanity. Since Brown himself did not change after his death, his sanity 
        provides an inadvertent index of the level of white racism in our society. In today's 
        textbooks, Brown makes two appearances: Pottawatomie, Kansas, and Harpers Ferry, Virginia. 
        Recall that the 1854 Kansas-Nebraska Act tried to resolve the question of slavery through 
        “popular sovereignty.” The practical result of leaving the slavery decision to whoever 
        settled in Kansas was an ideologically motivated settlement craze. Northerners rushed to 
        live and farm in Kansas Territory and make it “free soil.” Fewer Southern planters moved 
        to Kansas with their slaves, but slaveowners from Missouri repeatedly crossed the Missouri 
        River to vote in territorial elections and to establish a reign of terror to drive out the 
        free-soil farmers. In May 1856 hundreds of proslavery “border ruffians,” as they came to 
        be called, raided the free-soil town of Lawrence, Kansas, burning down the hotel and 
        destroying two printing presses. The American Tradition describes Brown's action at Pottawatomie: “In retaliation, a militant abolitionist named 
        John Brown led a midnight attack on the proslavery settlement of Pottawatomie. Five people were killed by Brown and his followers.” Discovering American History describes Brown's 1859 Harpers Ferry raid:"|"Lies My Teacher Told Me"|"James W. Loewen"
