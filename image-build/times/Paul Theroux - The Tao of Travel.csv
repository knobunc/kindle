18:00|"six P.M."|"And remember, a campsite suitable for you may be a disaster area for a hungry horse or mule. Then you must press on, often to a site hardly fit for humans but providing adequate grazing. People can do the mind-over-matter bit, and resolve never again to let supplies run so low, but an equine helper doesn’t have that sort of mind. If there’s no fodder at six P.M., the mule cannot have consoling thoughts about stuffing it in at six P.M. the next day. And there is nothing more guilt-provoking than seeing a pack animal who has worked hard for you all day going without sustenance."|"The Tao of Travel"|"Paul Theroux"
12:00|noon|"Stephen Crane in “The Open Boat”: A day and a half, from late afternoon on January 1 to noon on January 3, 1897, off the Florida coast. Subtitled “A Tale Intended to Be After the Fact”, this story is regarded as a classic in ordeal literature. But the ordeal (Crane and three others splashing fifteen miles to Daytona Beach in a dinghy after their ship, the Cuba-bound Commodore, sank) is a landlubber’s exercise in mythomania and hyperbole. Though a literary critic was later emboldened to write, “Captain Bligh’s account of his small boat journey … seems tame in comparison”, it is a matter of record that Bligh’s treacherous voyage of four thousand miles in a small lifeboat took him six weeks, compared to Crane’s thirty-six hours."|"The Tao of Travel"|"Paul Theroux"

Half a day passes — no water. Night falls — and twelve hours pass — no water. They set off at six A.M. and walk and ride most of the morning.

12:00|noonday|"Looking eastward from the summit of the Pacheco Pass one shining morning, a landscape was displayed that after all my wanderings still appears as the most beautiful I have ever beheld. At my feet lay the Great Central Valley of California, level and flowery, like a lake of pure sunshine, forty or fifty miles wide, five hundred miles long, one rich furred garden of yellow compositae. And from the eastern boundary of this vast golden flower-bed rose the mighty Sierra, miles in height and so gloriously coloured and so radiant, it seemed not clothed with light, but wholly composed of it, like the wall of some celestial city. Along the top and extending a good way down, was a rich pearl-grey belt of snow; below it a belt of blue and dark purple, marking the extension of the forests; and stretching along the base of the range a broad belt of rose-purple; all these colours, from the blue sky to the yellow valley smoothly blending as they do in a
				rainbow, making a wall of light ineffably fine. Then it seemed to me that the Sierra should be called, not the Nevada, or Snowy Range, but the Range of Light. And after ten years of wandering and wondering in the heart of it, rejoicing in its glorious floods of light, the white beams of the morning streaming through the passes, the noonday radiance on the crystal rocks, the flush of the alpenglow, and the irised spray of countless waterfalls, it still seems above all others the Range of Light."|"The Tao of Travel"|"Paul Theroux"
"~ 19:00"|"About seven in the evening"|"Toward the end of July, the wind picks up and proves helpful, and a full month after setting off, Fielding is at last on his way, at sea. The rest of the voyage is brisk. Next day they are “thirty miles to the westward of Plymouth”, and the day after in the Bay of Biscay, and becalmed, then in a gale: “Our voyage was retarded.” Several days after the gale they are off the Portuguese coast and soon at Lisbon. The actual voyage is so abbreviated as to seem an anti-climax: “About seven in the evening I got into a chaise on shore, and was driven through the nastiest city in the world, tho’ at the same time one of the most populous, to a kind of coffee-house, which is very pleasantly situated on the brow of a hill, about a mile from the city, and hath a very fine prospect of the river Tajo from Lisbon to the sea.”"|"The Tao of Travel"|"Paul Theroux"
"> 18:37"|"after 1837"|"HENRY DAVID THOREAU was so emotionally attached to his home in Concord that he found it almost impossible to leave. In fact, after 1837 he did so only for short periods — thirteen days on the Concord and Merrimack rivers, some visits to Cape Cod, three trips to the Maine woods, brief spells in Staten Island and Minnesota. He was never alone on these excursions; he always went with a friend or relative. Although he philosophized constantly about travel (he was widely read in the travel books of his time), he is a much better example of someone who really didn’t go anywhere. The Maine trip was a team effort, and Thoreau was a follower. A Yankee in Canada is about a one-week train trip with several hundred tourists, what we would call a package tour today. He made no bones about not being a traveller. He boasted of staying
			home; indeed, he made a virtue of it: “Live at home like a traveller.” Homesick on Staten Island, he wrote, “My thoughts revert to those dear hills … Others may say, ‘Are there not the cities of Asia?’ But what are they? Staying at home is the heavenly way” (letter to Ralph Waldo Emerson)."|"The Tao of Travel"|"Paul Theroux"

12:00|noontime|"“Sometimes it don’t seem possible that we’re living at all, especially when I wake up in the morning and see the children getting up and dressing and walking around in the kitchen where there’s hardly a crumb of food. They make a fire in the cook-stove and I scrape together a little corn meal, when there’s any to scrape, and I cook it with salt and water. Once in a while we have some molasses, or maybe just some sugar-water to eat with it. When noontime comes, they start another fire, and I cook some more cornbread. A lot of times lately I’ve just sat and wondered if there’s anything else in the world to eat. I know there must be other things in the world to eat, because the rich wouldn’t eat cornbread, and I wouldn’t if I could help it. Not just cornbread and nothing else. Once in a while we have some store-bought canned beans, just one or two cans among us, and that don’t go far
				when there’s nine hungry children besides me. The two oldest boys manage to earn a little money somehow, and they bring home all they make. Altogether, what money there is comes to two or three dollars a week. We eat on that, except for the twenty-five cents a week house rent I pay the landlord. We’ve been getting along somehow for three years since my husband died. Every time it rains hard all of us have to crawl under the house to keep from getting wet, because I don’t reckon there’s a landlord in the country who would patch a roof for only twenty-five cents a week rent.”"|"The Tao of Travel"|"Paul Theroux"

"ap 01:00"|one|"Solitude, I reflected, is the one deep necessity of the human spirit to which adequate recognition is never given in our codes. It is looked upon as a discipline or a penance, but hardly ever as the indispensable, pleasant ingredient it is to ordinary life, and from this want of recognition come half our domestic troubles. The fear of an unbroken tête-à-tête for the rest of his life should, you would think, prevent any man from getting married … Modern education ignores the need for solitude: hence a decline in religion, in poetry, in all the deeper affections of the spirit: a disease to be doing something always, as if one could never sit quietly and let the puppet show unroll itself before one: an inability to lose oneself in mystery and wonder while, like a wave lifting us into new seas, the history of the world develops around us. I was thinking these thoughts when Husein, out of breath and beating the
			grey mare for all he was worth with the plaited rein, came up behind me, and asked how I could bear to go on alone for over an hour, with everyone anxious behind me."|"The Tao of Travel"|"Paul Theroux"
