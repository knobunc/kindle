07:00|"7 A.M."|"In the old days I used to sally forth, sponge in hand, to the nursery bathroom which was down a terrifying, twisting staircase, and I could still remember how cold it used to be outside, in the passages, though there was always a blazing fire in my room. But now the central heating had been brought up to date and the temperature everywhere was that of a hot-house. The fire which flickered away beneath the spires and towers of the chimney-piece was merely there for show, and no longer to be lighted at 7 A.M., before one was awake, by a little maid scuffling about like a mouse. The age of luxury was ended and that of comfort had begun. Being conservative by nature, I was glad to see that the decoration of the room had not been changed at all, though the lighting was very much improved. There was a new quilt on the bed, the mahogany dressing table had acquired a muslin petticoat and a triple looking-glass, and the whole room and bathroom were close carpeted. Otherwise everything was exactly as I remembered it, including two large yellow pictures which could be seen from the bed, Caravaggio’s “The Gamesters” and “A Courtesan” by Raphael."|"Love in a Cold Climate"|"Nancy Mitford"
"ap - 09:05"|"between five and fifteen minutes past nine"|"“Oh,” she said vaguely, “nine-ish, you know,” and I took that to mean, as it meant at home, between five and fifteen minutes past nine. In the morning I was woken up at eight by a housemaid, who brought me tea with slices of paper-thin bread and butter, asked me, “Are these your gloves, miss, they were found in the car?” and then, after running me a bath, whisked away every other garment within sight, to add them no doubt to the collection she had already made of yesterday’s tweed suit, jersey, shoes, stockings and underclothes. I foresaw that soon I should be appearing downstairs in my gloves and nothing else."|"Love in a Cold Climate"|"Nancy Mitford"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"By nine o’clock I was bathed and dressed and quite ready for some food. Curiously enough, the immense dinner of the night before, which ought to have lasted me a week, seemed to have made me hungrier than usual. I waited a few minutes after the stable clock struck nine, so as not to be the first, and then ventured downstairs, but was greatly disconcerted in the dining room to find the table still in its green baize, the door into the pantry wide open and the menservants, in striped waistcoats and shirt sleeves, engaged upon jobs which had nothing to do with an approaching meal, such as sorting out letters and folding up the morning papers. They looked at me, or so I imagined, with surprise and hostility. I found them even more frightening than my fellow guests and was about to go back to my bedroom as quickly as I could when a voice behind me said, “But it’s terrible, looking at this empty table.”"|"Love in a Cold Climate"|"Nancy Mitford"

"ap 04:45"|4.45|"I was obliged to admit that this was the case. From a tiny child, ever since I could remember, in fact, some delicious image had been enshrined in my heart, last thought at night, first thought in the morning. Fred Terry as Sir Percy Blakeney, Lord Byron, Rudolph Valentino, Henry V, Gerald du Maurier, blissful Mrs. Ashton at my school, Steerforth, Napoleon, the guard on the 4.45, image had succeeded image. Latterly it had been that of a pale, pompous young man in the Foreign Office who had once, during my season in London, asked me for a dance, had seemed to me the very flower of cosmopolitan civilization, and had remained the pivot of existence until wiped from my memory by Sauveterre. For that is what always happened to these images. Time and hateful absence blurred them, faded them but never quite obliterated them until some lovely new broom image came and swept them away."|"Love in a Cold Climate"|"Nancy Mitford"

"ap ~ 00:00"|"about twelve"|"“Oh, nothing very much.”
“Don’t be so tiresome. You got to London at about twelve, I suppose?”
“Yes, we did,” said Polly in a resigned voice. She would have to account for every minute of the day, she knew. Quicker to tell of her own accord than to have it pumped out of her. She began to fidget with her bridesmaid’s wreath of silver leaves. “Wait a moment,” she said. “I must take this off, it’s giving me a headache.”"|"Love in a Cold Climate"|"Nancy Mitford"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"The rest of the evening was spent by me in a happy trance, and I remember no more about the party, as such. I know that I was taken back to the Goring Hotel, where we were all staying, at five o’clock on a fine May morning by Mr. Wincham, who had clearly shown me, by then, that he was not at all averse to my company."|"Love in a Cold Climate"|"Nancy Mitford"
"ap 05:00"|"five-o’clock"|"So round I went, trembling rather. Bullitt, the butler, always frightened me into a fit. He was like Frankenstein’s monster and one had to follow his jerky footsteps as though through some huge museum before arriving at the little green room, the only room in the house which did not seem as if it had been cleared ready for a reception, and in which they always sat. Today, however, the front door was opened by a footman of more human aspect, and, furthermore, he told me the good news that Her Ladyship had not yet come in, but Lady Polly was there alone, so off we trudged and presently discovered her amid the usual five-o’clock paraphernalia of silver kettle on flame, silver tea pot, Crown Derby cups and plates, and enough sugary food to stock a pastrycook’s shop. She was sitting on the arm of a chair reading the Tatler."|"Love in a Cold Climate"|"Nancy Mitford"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"And it was not, in the end, too bad at all. The fact is that Uncle Matthew’s tremendous and classical hatred for me, which had begun when I was an infant and which had cast a shadow of fear over all my childhood, had now become more legend than actuality. I was such an habitual member of his household, and he such a conservative, that this hatred, in common with that which he used to nurture against Josh, the groom, and various other old intimates, had not only lost its force but I think had, with the passage of years, actually turned into love; such a lukewarm sentiment as ordinary avuncular affection being, of course, foreign to his experience. Be that as it may, he evidently had no wish to poison the beginning of my married life and made quite touching efforts to bottle up whatever irritation he felt at Alfred’s shortcomings, his unmanly incompetence with his motor car, vagueness over time and fatal disposition to spill marmalade at breakfast. The fact that Alfred left for Oxford at nine o’clock, only returning in time for dinner, and that we spent Saturday to Monday of every week in Kent with Aunt Emily made our visit just endurable to Uncle Matthew, and, incidentally to Alfred himself, who did not share my unquestioning adoration for all members of the Radlett family."|"Love in a Cold Climate"|"Nancy Mitford"
00:00|midnight|"Aunt Sadie, during a little graveside chat with Lady Montdore, had gathered that the death had come as a shock and surprise to all of them, that, although they had known Lady Patricia to be far from well, they had no idea that she was in immediate danger; in fact, she had been greatly looking forward to her trip abroad the following week. Lady Montdore, who resented death, clearly thought it most inconsiderate of her sister-in-law to break up their little circle so suddenly, and Lord Montdore, devoted to his sister, was dreadfully shaken by the midnight drive with a death-bed at the end of it, but, surprisingly enough, the one who had taken it hardest was Polly. It seemed that she had been violently sick on hearing the news, completely prostrated for two days, and was still looking so unwell that her mother had refused to take her to the funeral."|"Love in a Cold Climate"|"Nancy Mitford"
"ap 02:30"|"half-past two"|"I THINK IT WAS about a fortnight after Lady Patricia’s funeral that Uncle Matthew stood, after luncheon, outside his front door, watch in hand, scowling fiercely, grinding his teeth and awaiting his greatest treat of all the year, an afternoon’s chubb fuddling.

The door of my house was always kept on the latch, like a country-house door, and she never bothered to ring but just stumped upstairs. On this occasion it was five minutes to one and I plainly saw that I would have to share the little bit of salmon I had ordered for myself, as a treat, with her."|"Love in a Cold Climate"|"Nancy Mitford"
"ap 06:00"|six|"“Well, I warn you I shall wake you up for it at six. Now finish your tea, dear, and come, we ought to be getting back.

One o’clock then.”"|"Love in a Cold Climate"|"Nancy Mitford"
00:00|midnight|"“Quite another way, darling. You haven’t started about Boy, have you? Oh, how loyal. I was delayed by Sonia, too, on the telephone. She’s in a terrible do.… It seems they’ve had her up for stealing the nurses’ breakfast—well, had her up in front of the principal, who spoke quite cruelly to her, and said that if she does it again, or gets one more bite of illicit food, he’ll give her the sack. Just imagine, no dinner, one orange juice at midnight, and woken up by the smell of kippers. So naturally the poor darling sneaked out and pinched one, and they caught her with it under her dressing gown. I’m glad to say she’d eaten most of it before they got it away from her. The thing is she started off demoralized by finding your name in the visitors’ book, Davey, apparently she gave a scream and said, ‘But he’s a living skeleton, whatever was he doing here?’ and they said you had gone there to put on weight. What’s the idea?”"|"Love in a Cold Climate"|"Nancy Mitford"
"ap 06:30"|"half-past six"|"“But, my dearest Mrs. Cozens, I don’t want a hunter. It’s the last thing. I’d be far too frightened. Besides, look at the time you have to get up—I heard them the other morning in the woods, half-past six. Well, you know, I’m afraid it’s ‘up before seven dead before eleven’ with one. No, I just wanted this special old clipper-clopper. She’s not the horse to make claims on a chap. She won’t want to be ridden all the time, as a younger horse might, and there she’ll be, if I feel like having a few words with her occasionally. But the great question now, which I came to tease practical Fanny with, is how to get her home?”"|"Love in a Cold Climate"|"Nancy Mitford"

And you’ll never believe this, but they are two hours late for every meal—two hours, Fanny—(can we lunch at half past twelve to-day?) so of course by then you’ve stopped feeling hungry and only feel sick. Then, when the food comes, it is all cooked in rancid oil. I can smell it now, it’s on everybody’s hair, too, and to make it more appetizing there are pictures all round you of some dear old bull being tortured to death. They think of literally nothing all day but bulls and the Virgin. Spain was the worst of all, I thought. Of course Boy doesn’t mind abroad a bit, in fact, he seems to like it, and he can talk all those terribly affected languages (darling, Italian! you’d die!) but I truly don’t think I could have borne it much longer. I should have pined away with homesickness. Anyway, here I am.”"|"Love in a Cold Climate"|"Nancy Mitford"

It seems to have been very splendid, Cedric changed his dress five times. He started with tights made of rose petals and a pink wig and ended as Doris Keane in Romance and a black wig. He had real diamonds on his mask. Your mother was a Venetian youth, to show off her new legs, and they stood in a gondola giving away wonderful prizes to everybody—Norma got a silver snuffbox—and it went on till seven.
