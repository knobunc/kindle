I wondered whether it was to do with the strike: some York enginemen had been on strike for the best part of a month.
I looked above the bar: 5.45 p.m.
I would drink my pint before asking after my magazines, and I would have ten minutes’ study. So I left the Evening Press and, taking from my side coat pocket my Railway Police Manual, I sauntered over to one of the long wooden benches lining the room."|"The Blackpool Highflyer"|"Andrew Martin"

I looked again at the clock: eight-eleven.
I ducked back inside and reached across to the locker for my tea bottle . . . but I was vexed by the tin tub. They would be tied together all day carrying it. And what was it for?

It was all part of his exquisite ways, like not being able to stand coal dust on the footplate. Down along the platform Reuben Booth was untangling the green flag from the shoulder strap of his satchel, and trying not to bring his hat off while he was about it. Superannuation seemed to have passed Reuben by.

The Hind’s lot would have missed their teas under the Tower, and the white rosettes would have gone for nothing.

He’d have to be on the milk train at four though, and back over the Pennines before first light, because the two of us had a seven o’clock go-on at Sowerby Bridge shed. How was he able to be so cool about the prospect of another smash? Maybe it was just his nature. Perhaps that was how a fellow of the right sort ought to be. Then again, perhaps he knew for a fact there wouldn’t be another smash, the first one having been arranged by himself. But why would he do that? So that he could get his medal and come out the hero. But why would he want to come out the hero? He was not so determined to get on in his work, as far as I could see.

Alongside it was a poster for the Halifax Building Society: ‘AS SAFE AS HOUSES’ read the slogan, and that made me hurry along faster still towards Hill Street, where there was just one light burning—upstairs in our house."|"The Blackpool Highflyer"|"Andrew Martin"

It was Friday 30 June, four days after the late turn at Blackpool. We’d not been back since and there’d just been one other excursion in the week: church ladies to Southport on the Wednesday—trouble-free, but I’d been fretting about George Ogden, who, by paying for the window, had only made me think he must have been the one who smashed it.

Most likely because he didn’t write off for replacements, as he’d said, but stole the deliveries as they came in.
