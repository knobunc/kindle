A couple of old creatures, a tramp or a beggar and his wife, in long greasy overcoats that reached almost to the ground, were shuffling towards the shop.  Book-pinchers, by the look of them.  Better keep an eye on the boxes outside.  The old man halted on the kerb a few yards away while his wife came to the door.  She pushed it open and looked up at Gordon, between grey strings of hair, with a sort of hopeful malevolence."|"Keep the Aspidistra Flying"|"George Orwell"

Bed-sitting-rooms, with gaslight laid on and find your own heating, baths extra (there was a geyser), and meals in the tomb-dark dining-room with the phalanx of clotted sauce-bottles in the middle of the table.

As Gordon came in, the door at the end of the passage opened a foot or so.  Mrs Wisbeach's face emerged, inspected him briefly but suspiciously, and disappeared again.  It was quite impossible to get in or out of the house, at any time before eleven at night, without being scrutinized in this manner.  Just what Mrs Wisbeach suspected you of it was hard to say; smuggling women into the house, possibly.  She was one of those malignant respectable women who keep lodging-houses.  Age about forty-five, stout but active, with a pink, fine-featured, horribly observant face, beautifully grey hair, and a permanent grievance."|"Keep the Aspidistra Flying"|"George Orwell"
12:00|midday|"Gordon went down.  The dining-room was on the first floor, at the back, opposite Flaxman's room.  It was a cold, close-smelling room, twilit even at midday.  There were more aspidistras in it than Gordon had ever accurately counted.  They were all over the place-- on the sideboard, on the floor, on 'occasional' tables; in the window there was a sort of florist's stand of them, blocking out the light.  In the half-darkness, with aspidistras all about you, you had the feeling of being in some sunless aquarium amid the dreary foliage of water-flowers.  Gordon's supper was set out, waiting for him, in the circle of white light that the cracked gas- jet cast upon the table cloth.  He sat down with his back to the fireplace (there was an aspidistra in the grate instead of a fire) and ate his plate of cold beef and his two slices of crumbly white bread, with Canadian butter, mousetrap cheese and Pan Yan pickle, and drank a glass of cold but musty water."|"Keep the Aspidistra Flying"|"George Orwell"
"ap 10:30"|"half past ten"|"Down in Mrs Wisbeach's lair the clock struck half past ten.  You could always hear it striking at night.  Ping-ping, ping-ping--a note of doom!  The ticking of the alarm clock on the mantelpiece became audible to Gordon again, bringing with it the consciousness of the sinister passage of time.  He looked about him.  Another evening wasted.  Hours, days, years slipping by.  Night after night, always the same.  The lonely room, the womanless bed; dust, cigarette ash, the aspidistra leaves.  And he was thirty, nearly. In sheer self-punishment he dragged forth a wad of London Pleasures, spread out the grimy sheets, and looked at them as one looks at a skull for a memento mori.  London Pleasures, by Gordon Comstock, author of Mice.  His magnum opus.  The fruit (fruit, indeed!) of two years' work--that labyrinthine mess of words!

"ap 06:15"|six-fifteen|"They moved away from Acton and took a flat in a desolate red block of flats somewhere in the Paddington district.  Mrs Comstock had brought her piano, and when she had got some of her strength back she gave occasional lessons.  Gordon's wages were gradually raised, and the three of them 'managed', more or less.  It was Julia and Mrs Comstock who did most of the 'managing'.  Gordon still had a boy's selfishness about money.  At the office he got on not absolutely badly.  It was said of him that he was worth his wages but wasn't the type that Makes Good.  In a way the utter contempt that he had for his work made things easier for him.  He could put up with this meaningless office-life, because he never for an instant thought of it as permanent.  Somehow, sometime, God knew how or when, he was going to break free of it.  After all, there was always his 'writing'.  Some day, perhaps, he might be able to make a living of sorts by 'writing'; and you'd feel you were free of the money-stink if you were a 'writer', would you not?  The types he saw all round him, especially the older men, made him squirm.  That was what it meant to worship the money-god!  To settle down, to Make Good, to sell your soul for a villa and an aspidistra!  To turn into the typical little bowler-hatted sneak-- Strube's 'little man'--the little docile cit who slips home by the six-fifteen to a supper of cottage pie and stewed tinned pears, half an hour's listening-in to the B. B. C. Symphony Concert, and then perhaps a spot of licit sexual intercourse if his wife 'feels in the mood'!  What a fate!  No, it isn't like that that one was meant to live.  One's got to get right out of it, out of the money- stink.  It was a kind of plot that he was nursing.  He was as though dedicated to this war against money.  But it was still a secret.  The people at the office never suspected him of unorthodox ideas.  They never even found out that he wrote poetry--not that there was much to find out, for in six years he had less than twenty poems printed in the magazines.  To look at, he was just the same as any other City clerk--just a soldier in the strap-hanging army that sways eastward at morning, westward at night in the carriages of the Underground."|"Keep the Aspidistra Flying"|"George Orwell"

He learned what it means to live for weeks on end on bread and margarine, to try to 'write' when you are half starved, to pawn your clothes, to sneak trembling up the stairs when you owe three weeks' rent and your landlady is listening for you.  Moreover, in those seven months he wrote practically nothing. The first effect of poverty is that it kills thought.  He grasped, as though it were a new discovery, that you do not escape from money merely by being moneyless.  On the contrary, you are the hopeless slave of money until you have enough of it to live on--a 'competence', as the beastly middle-class phrase goes.  Finally he was turned out of his room, after a vulgar row.  He was three days and four nights in the street.  It was bloody.  Three mornings, on the advice of another man he met on the Embankment, he spent in Billingsgate, helping to shove fish-barrows up the twisty little hills from Billingsgate into Eastcheap.  'Twopence an up' was what you got, and the work knocked hell out of your thigh muscles. There were crowds of people on the same job, and you had to wait your turn; you were lucky if you made eighteen-pence between four in the morning and nine.  After three days of it Gordon gave up.

His feet were sore and most of the benches were empty, but he would not sit down.  If he halted for an instant the longing for tobacco would come upon him.  In the Charing Cross Road the teashops called like sirens.  Once the glass door of a Lyons swung open, letting out a wave of hot cake-scented air.  It almost overcame him.  After all, why NOT go in?  You could sit there for nearly an hour.  A cup of tea twopence, two buns a penny each.  He had fourpence halfpenny, counting the Joey.  But no!  That bloody Joey!  The girl at the cash desk would titter.  In a vivid vision he saw the girl at the cash desk, as she handled his threepenny-bit, grin sidelong at the girl behind the cake-counter.

In Camden Town the pubs were full and noisy, though this was only Thursday.  Three women, red-armed, squat as the beer mugs in their hands, stood outside a pub door, talking.

You were allowed to smoke--matches were forbidden, but the constable on duty outside would give you a light through the trap in the door.  Nobody had any cigarettes except the publican, who had his pockets full of them and distributed them freely.  Prisoners came and went.  A ragged dirty man who claimed to be a coster 'up' for obstruction was put into the cell for half an hour.  He talked a great deal, but the others were deeply suspicious of him; when he was taken out again they all declared he was a 'split'.  The police, it was said, often put a 'split' into the cells, disguised as a prisoner, to pick up information.  Once there was great excitement when the constable whispered through the trap that a murderer, or would-be murderer, was being put into the cell next door.  He was a youth of eighteen who had stabbed his 'tart' in the belly, and she was not expected to live.  Once the trap opened and the tired, pale face of a clergyman looked in.  He saw the burglar, said wearily, 'YOU here again, Jones?' and went away again.  Dinner, so-called, was served out at about twelve o'clock.  All you got was a cup of tea and two slices of bread and marg.  You could have food sent in, though, if you could pay for it.  The publican had a good dinner sent in in covered dishes; but he had no appetite for it, and gave most of it away.  Ravelston was still hanging about the court, waiting for Gordon's case to come on, but he did not know the ropes well enough to have food sent in to Gordon.  Presently the burglar and the publican were taken away, sentenced, and brought back to wait till the Black Maria should take them off to jail.  They each got nine months.  The publican questioned the burglar about what prison was like.  There was a conversation of unspeakable obscenity about the lack of women there."|"Keep the Aspidistra Flying"|"George Orwell"
"ap 02:30"|"half past two"|"Gordon's case came on at half past two, and it was over so quickly that it seemed preposterous to have waited all that time for it. Afterwards he could remember nothing about the court except the coat of arms over the magistrate's chair.  The magistrate was dealing with the drunks at the rate of two a minute.  To the tune of 'John-Smith-drunk six-shillings-move-on-NEXT!' they filed past the railings of the dock, precisely like a crowd taking tickets at a booking-office.  Gordon's case, however, took two minutes instead of thirty seconds, because he had been disorderly and the sergeant had to testify that Gordon had struck him on the ear and called him a ---- bastard.  There was also a mild sensation in the court because Gordon, when questioned at the police station, had described himself as a poet.  He must have been very drunk to say a thing like that.  The magistrate looked at him suspiciously."|"Keep the Aspidistra Flying"|"George Orwell"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o'clock"|"On the other side of the court there was a room where a police sergeant sat with a large ledger, entering up the drunks' fines and taking payment.  Those who could not pay were taken back to the cells.  Gordon had expected this to happen to himself.  He was quite resigned to going to prison.  But when he emerged from the court it was to find that Ravelston was waiting there and had already paid his fine for him.  Gordon did not protest.  He allowed Ravelston to pack him into a taxi and take him back to the flat in Regent's Park.  As soon as they got there Gordon had a hot bath; he needed one, after the beastly contaminating grime of the last twelve hours.  Ravelston lent him a razor, lent him a clean shirt and pyjamas and socks and underclothes, even went out of doors and bought him a toothbrush.  He was strangely solicitous about Gordon. He could not rid himself of a guilty feeling that what had happened last night was mainly his own fault; he ought to have put his foot down and taken Gordon home as soon as he showed signs of being drunk.  Gordon scarcely noticed what was being done for him.  Even the fact the Ravelston had paid his fine failed to trouble him. For the rest of that afternoon he lay in one of the armchairs in front of the fire, reading a detective story.  About the future he refused to think.  He grew sleepy very early.  At eight o'clock he went to bed in the spare bedroom and slept like a log for nine hours."|"Keep the Aspidistra Flying"|"George Orwell"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"At seven Ravelston was awakened by a tap on his door.  He rolled over and said sleepily, 'Hullo?'  Gordon came in, a dishevelled figure almost lost in the borrowed silk pyjamas.  Ravelston roused himself, yawning.  Theoretically he got up at the proletarian hour of seven.  Actually he seldom stirred until Mrs Beaver, the charwoman, arrived at eight.  Gordon pushed the hair out of his eyes and sat down on the foot of Ravelston's bed."|"Keep the Aspidistra Flying"|"George Orwell"

"ap ~ 01:00"|"about one o'clock"|"Ravelston came back at about one o'clock.  He pulled his gloves off and threw them into a chair.  He looked tired and depressed. Gordon saw at a glance that the game was up."|"Keep the Aspidistra Flying"|"George Orwell"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"But of course, in his inmost heart, he didn't really like having Gordon there.  How should he?  It was an impossible situation. There was a tension between them all the time.  It is always so when one person is living on another.  However delicately disguised, charity is still horrible; there is a malaise, almost a secret hatred, between the giver and the receiver.  Gordon knew that his friendship with Ravelston would never be the same again. Whatever happened afterwards, the memory of this evil time would be between them.  The feeling of his dependent position, of being in the way, unwanted, a nuisance, was with him night and day.  At meals he would scarcely eat, he would not smoke Ravelston's cigarettes, but bought himself cigarettes out of his few remaining shillings.  He would not even light the gas-fire in his bedroom. He would have made himself invisible if he could.  Every day, of course, people were coming and going at the flat and at the office. All of them saw Gordon and grasped his status.  Another of Ravelston's pet scroungers, they all said.  He even detected a gleam of professional jealousy in one or two of the hangers-on of Antichrist.  Three times during that week Hermione Slater came. After his first encounter with her he fled from the flat as soon as she appeared; on one occasion, when she came at night, he had to stay out of doors till after midnight.  Mrs Beaver, the charwoman, had also 'seen through' Gordon.  She knew his type.  He was another of those good-for-nothing young 'writing gentlemen' who sponged on poor Mr Ravelston.  So in none too subtle ways she made things uncomfortable for Gordon.  Her favourite trick was to rout him out with broom and pan--'Now, Mr Comstock, I've got to do this room out, IF you please'--from whichever room he had settled down in."|"Keep the Aspidistra Flying"|"George Orwell"
"ap ~ 06:00"|"about six o'clock"|"After a little while she went away.  Later in the evening or tomorrow he would let her know what he decided.  Of course it was not absolutely certain that the New Albion would give him a job even if he asked them; but presumably they would, considering what Mr Erskine had said.  Gordon tried to think and could not.  There seemed to be more customers than usual this afternoon.  It maddened him to have to bounce out of his chair every time he had sat down and deal with some fresh influx of fools demanding crime-stories and sex-stories and ROmances.  Suddenly, about six o'clock, he turned out the lights, locked up the library, and went out.  He had got to be alone.  The library was not due to shut for two hours yet.  God knew what Mr Cheeseman would say when he found out.  He might even give Gordon the sack.  Gordon did not care."|"Keep the Aspidistra Flying"|"George Orwell"
