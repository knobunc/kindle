Perhaps that sort of sadism shows in the curvature of the spine. Perhaps I’m just good at seeing what I want to see. However you account for it, I felt, in advance, the ‘sting of his disregard’ – I steal the phrase from Leopold Bloom, Bloomuponwhom, the patron saint of the subjugated and deceived – as acutely as those girls would have felt it at four o’clock on whatever day in whatever place Marius did not turn up to meet them."|"The Act of Love"|"Howard Jacobson"

I pounded the far end of the platform in irritation, looking for somewhere to sit in the sun, wondering whether to pick fights with people who took up seats with their luggage. People with backpacks always the worst offenders. Walkers! Those masochists who think their minds are healthy. At last a seat fell empty and I bagged it.

He was twenty, she was . . . but it didn’t matter how old she was in actuality; in expectation she was twenty too. It was four o’clock in the afternoon, an hour when her husband the professor was either lecturing or taking a nap, or, as Elspeth joked, her voice as merry as a young girl’s, doing both things simultaneously. She would have preferred to be driven away at night, with only the moon as their witness, but Marius couldn’t borrow the car for that long."|"The Act of Love"|"Howard Jacobson"

Never mind midnight. Midnight was obvious. If the twenty-four-hour day marked nothing but the fluctuations of our desires, four o’clock was, for him, the hairspring hour. Once upon a time it had affected him like a transfusion of vital fluids. He walked the streets and felt the oscillation between day and evening as a change in the temperature of his own body.

The one routine of his I could count on – four o’clock coffee at whatever tin table he could find vacant on the High Street, by preference one of those outside the Greek café opposite the travel bookshop – was too risky to take advantage of. I doubted he’d recognise me from Shropshire, but I couldn’t take the chance. It was important, for what I wanted of him, that he didn’t know of my existence."|"The Act of Love"|"Howard Jacobson"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"It was impossible to tell from Marisa’s demeanour when I first met her whether she was happy in her marriage or she was not. She looked impermanent, that was my strongest impression of her. She looked as though she hadn’t settled, as a butterfly never settles; indeed had someone told me that, like the butterfly which accompanied Thanatos, she would die before the afternoon was out I’d have believed it possible, for all that she had the bloom of health upon her. Though absolutely of the here and now in her dress, never not elegant in the steely heeled, city-woman style, a powerhouse capable of taking on any man at his own game, she somehow wasn’t with us. When she smiled at something one of us said – we were just the three, Marisa, her husband and I, taking tea at Claridge ’s, the four o’clock ritual – it was as though she were playing catch-up, smiling at something that had been said the last time she was here. She wasn’t slow, far from it, she was simply operating in another dimension, thinking her thoughts and saving up whatever was said for an hour when she would be more receptive to it."|"The Act of Love"|"Howard Jacobson"
"ap ~ 04:00"|"about four o’clock"|"At around about four o’clock my host nodded off in his chair. On the grass by him lay a copy of Don Quixote, which he’d presumably brought out so that he could read an extract from the story of Anselmo and Lothario aloud to me. While he slept I leafed through the novel to see if I could find their names, which proved not to be too difficult as many of the scenes in which they appeared were marked. Their adventure, if it could be so called, appeared to be another version of a plot in a Shakespeare play I’d read at school – one man inviting another to try the fidelity of the woman he loved, to tragic or near-tragic effect. According to the notes in my Arden Shakespeare, the ‘fidelity test’ was a recurring motif in medieval Italian novellas, from which Cervantes too must have borrowed. I was too young to know anything for sure, but something told me that a fidelity test was more likely to be a literary device than a strategy much resorted to in real life. But it could only have cropped up frequently in literature if it answered to something that gave real men cause for concern: namely, the character of their wives when subjected to overwhelming temptation, for where, as Anselmo says to Lothario, is the merit in her being virtuous ‘when nobody persuades her to be otherwise? What mighty matter  if she be reserved and cautious, who has no opportunity given her of going astray?’ A fear which once acted upon, it occurred to me, must surely stimulate a curiosity that is never to be assuaged. Why should Anselmo stop with a Lothario no matter how true this Lothario proves his wife to be? Indeed it would be illogical to do so. For is there not always to be encountered a Lothario more persuasive than the last? Will there not always be an ‘opportunity’ for disloyalty greater than the one before?"|"The Act of Love"|"Howard Jacobson"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"But every day has its pivotal four o’clock and a marriage is no different. Imperceptibly but decisively we yielded to those equinoctial hours when relations between lovers quiver on their axes. And where we didn’t quiver as perilously as I wished, I applied my weight. An old acquaintance of mine would come to stay and I would feign indisposition in the middle of the evening, leaving Marisa to do the entertaining. I would make myself scarce at Marisa’s Oxfam and Samaritans parties, watching from the shadows while she talked and laughed with whom she chose, to all intents and purposes a woman who had only her own engagement book to consult. I danced with her less than in the days of our courtship, either missing out on the school’s social nights, so that she could mingle freely with those against whom she’d earlier pressed her body, or arriving opportunely late for one of our periodic classes, in the hope of finding her tangoing like a mare on heat with the newest teacher, an Argentinian with punched-out eyes and a ponytail."|"The Act of Love"|"Howard Jacobson"

By ten I liked to have changed out of my business suit or whatever I was wearing that attached me to any purpose other than Marisa. In the days before she ’d taken ill in Florida, Marisa had bought me white pyjamas in a shop in Key West that sold only garments Hemingway might have worn. Hemingway’s connection to white pyjamas was a mystery to us, but they were certainly more suited to the damp and heat than those I’d brought with me. Marisa had laughed, I remember, on discovering I had brought any pyjamas to Florida. Why pack such things to go on honeymoon? ‘So that you can laugh at me,’ I told her. There was no laughter associated with my white pyjamas now. These were sacrificial garments, the vestiture which signified the abnegation of my virility and independence. I was Marisa’s to do with as she willed, and let my icy blood stain the garments I wore in her service until every corner of them was incarnadined.

Or might do the very opposite and leave me al-together, in which case again my devotions would be over.

"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"I had felt, even as she was talking to me, great sympathy for Lionel. I had met him a few times, either on the Antiquarian Booksellers Association’s equivalent of a works outing, or at occasional recitals his quartet gave at the Wigmore Hall or other local venues which I felt we owed it to Dulcie to attend. I can’t say I cared for him. He was at once a little too manly in the basso profundo, real-ale sense, and a little too womanly in the organisational way of things, ringing up unnecessarily to confirm dates and making lists of people ’s orders at restaurants – particularly Chinese restaurants where he liked to order by number – so as not to confuse the waiters, though his officiousness invariably confused them more. He had a long, Founding Father’s face, marked by a sort of wolfish puritanism which he exaggerated by wearing what couldn’t quite be called a beard, more a permanent five o’clock shadow which was sculpted into points on his cheeks and below his ears. There was something about the way he moved his mouth I didn’t like either, as though it pained his teeth to talk to you. And he couldn’t stop touching his hair. Even on stage, when he wasn’t playing, his hair appeared to plague him. I’d have said it was a wig, except that no one would have paid good money for such a mildewed patch. But you don’t have to like a man to feel for his predicament as a husband. He had been happily and conventionally married for too long. Nothing wrong with Dulcie. If you had to be happily and conventionally married for an eternity, Dulcie was probably the ideal person to be happily and conventionally married to. But the strain of keeping to the straight and narrow had begun to tell on him as it tells at last on everybody. It is too cruel, the way our society packages and sells the ideal of blissful conjugal normality. There is not enough room left for people to be peculiar. And by and large it is only by being peculiar that we achieve a measure of happiness. The majority of people who rang Marisa at their wits’ end were not at their wits’ end being peculiar. The peculiar are too busy being peculiar to have time to ring the Samaritans. It is not odd sex that drives people to the window ledge, it’s no sex.

They were counting up or checking till rolls. At the fromagerie they were worrying about food going off. In the patisseries they were running out of cakes. Outside the restaurants the chefs and waiters were in the street, smoking their last cigarettes before the night’s business began. I exchanged vaguely criminal looks with them as I passed. We were in something underhand together.

Maybe he would take the hint and go there. That’s a joke. I didn’t want him out of the country quite yet. I inscribed it, as I always like to inscribe a book, though this time with a message I had not employed before. It would, however, be familiar to Marius on several counts. It went – ‘There is no pleasure sweeter than surprising a man by giving him more than he had hoped for.’ And was signed in initials he would not be able to distinguish. The surprise – assuming the book itself was not surprise enough – was contained in the long white envelope I had slipped inside its pages. It contained a letter advising him that the woman to whom he had formed an intense attachment and who he had reason to believe was no less attached to him, had – even now, now, very now – another lover coterminous with him. It was in order to be with this second lover that she had, at late notice, put off their Sunday date. If his curiosity extended to such a thing, he could find the two of them in Regent’s Park that same Sunday afternoon – why not say four o’clock? – dancing, for all the world to see, that dance of port prostitutes, brothels, low dives and lechery: the tango."|"The Act of Love"|"Howard Jacobson"
"ap ~ 07:00"|"about seven o’clock"|"The following evening at about seven o’clock the doorbell rang. I was sitting in my study drinking blood-red wine and listening to lieder. The bell startled me. Seven o’clock was not a time when people rang our bell. Too late for tradesmen or deliveries, and in London friends don’t call on you without at least a fortnight’s warning. So it was good news or bad. My first excited thought was Marisa, ringing rather than letting herself in as a way of signalling she did not live here any more. I did not check my appearance before I opened the door. Let her see me looking rough, whether it inspired pity or satisfaction. Just let her see me."|"The Act of Love"|"Howard Jacobson"

"< 00:00"|"almost midnight"|"I let half the day go by in morbid self-indulgence – going through the things of hers that still remained, looking at old photographs and letters, blaming myself, imagining life without her, exactly as I hadimagined life without my mother and every other woman I had ever cared for, then retreating again behind the sheet of tears. In the afternoon I pulled myself together and began going through the phone book, systematically ringing every hospital in London to find which one had admitted her. Eventually I located her in a private hospital in Kingston. By then it was almost midnight. They were surprised, when I told them I was Marisa Quinn’s husband, that I didn’t know her operation wasn’t scheduled until the day after next. ‘I’m away,’ I explained, which surprised them more."|"The Act of Love"|"Howard Jacobson"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"I couldn’t change – that was why she wasn’t coming back to me. I was stuck in who I was. Marius, I believed, was stuck in four o’clock, and I, Marisa believed, was stuck in Marius. I wasn’t but I could see it looked that way. I was just stuck in myself, and myself needed a Marius, which was not quite the same thing."|"The Act of Love"|"Howard Jacobson"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"He had died walking in the Brecon Beacons. He had lost his way and suffered a heart attack. He had been dead three days when he was found. That was the official version. His heart had never been sound, it seemed, and fatigue and exposure had done the rest. My own view, based on no evidence, was that he’d walked out one afternoon when there was less than usual to live for and willed himself to death. I had no doubt that on whatever day he did this, it would have been four o’clock, the light not yet spent, the wheels of evening just beginning to turn. The hour when men dream of being somewhere else."|"The Act of Love"|"Howard Jacobson"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"She was standing with someone I took to be the old friend Marius had never mentioned, an unexpectedly red-faced man with a nautical expression. Who knew who Marius knew? She waved to me – a hesitant, fragile, fluttering gesture I was unable to read, almost like the action of someone troubled by summer flies, though there were no summer flies here. I couldn’t decipher its meaning – stay away, come here, meet me at four o’clock behind the headstones? I waved back. It was impossible to tell how she looked. She was wearing a long black coat, a black hat, a black veil. Did anyone wear a veil for funerals any more? Did anyone wear black even? Had Elspeth worn a veil at her husband’s funeral, I tried to remember. I thought not. But I recalled how like a fallen woman in a Victorian novel she had looked, conscious of an ancient and never to be repaired wrong, and Marisa, to my eye, appeared even more the mistress whom everyone in this superstitious place would obscurely blame for Marius’s death."|"The Act of Love"|"Howard Jacobson"
