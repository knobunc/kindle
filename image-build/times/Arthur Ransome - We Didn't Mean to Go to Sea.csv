"ap 06:00"|six|"It was getting on for low water. They had watched the falling tide leave boat after boat high, but, as Roger said, not exactly dry, on the shining mud. On the hard, men were walking round a barge that had been afloat in the middle of the day, and were busy with scrapers and tar-brushes. A clock chimed six from among the trees on the further side of the river. The river, wide as it was, seemed almost narrow between the bare mudflats, but a tug, fussing down from Ipswich, set the moored yachts rocking as it passed."|"We Didn't Mean to Go to Sea"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"“Gosh!” said Roger. “Were you sailing in the dark?”
“Left Dover two o’clock yesterday,” said the skipper of the Goblin.
“He’s been sailing all night,” said Roger. “Did you hear?”"|"We Didn't Mean to Go to Sea"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap < 07:00"|"nearly seven o’clock"|"“But it’s nearly seven o’clock. Haven’t you had anything to eat all day?”"|"We Didn't Mean to Go to Sea"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 04:00"|four|"“I promise too,” said Jim. “It’s high water at four on Friday. I’ll have them here at Pin Mill in time for tea.”"|"We Didn't Mean to Go to Sea"|"Arthur Ransome"
07:00|"seven o’clock in the morning"|"It was seven o’clock in the morning and they had been waked by a shout down the forehatch, “Rouse up there, the watch below. Anybody want a dip? No time to spare, if we’re going down the harbour before the tide turns.” Jim was already on the foredeck, in bathing things. There had been a hurried rush to join him."|"We Didn't Mean to Go to Sea"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 08:10"|"ten minutes past eight"|"“They’ll be as hard as stones,” she cried. “It’s ten minutes past eight and I put them in at … Bother it. When did the engine stop?” She took the heavy saucepan off the stove and fished for the eggs with a tablespoon. One good thing about being anchored. No deafening, throbbing engine, and those two would at least be able to finish their breakfasts properly. She set up the folding flap of the cabin table, and took the roll of American cloth from the shelf."|"We Didn't Mean to Go to Sea"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 08:16"|"Sixteen minutes past eight"|"“Sixteen minutes past eight,” said Susan. “Is he in sight? Breakfast’s all ready.”"|"We Didn't Mean to Go to Sea"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 08:39"|"twenty-one minutes to nine"|"“Quick!” said Susan. She put Jim’s two eggs into the saucepan. “You keep an eye on the clock, Titty, in case I forget, and sing out when it’s twenty-one minutes to nine.”"|"We Didn't Mean to Go to Sea"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 11:30"|"half-past eleven"|"“It’s half-past eleven,” said Susan, after looking at the clock and at the cabin table, where Jim’s breakfast still waited and his second pair of eggs had gone cold. “What can have happened to him?”"|"We Didn't Mean to Go to Sea"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"“They’re all right so far,” said Susan. “But I can’t help thinking something must have happened to Jim. It’s two o’clock already.”"|"We Didn't Mean to Go to Sea"|"Arthur Ransome"
15:10|"fifteen … ten"|"He was up in the cockpit in a moment, bumping his head on the way but hardly feeling it. He saw this buoy all right. A huge cage buoy, with a flat top and a lantern on it, had loomed out of the fog and was coming at them amidships. It was twenty yards off … fifteen … ten …"|"We Didn't Mean to Go to Sea"|"Arthur Ransome"
15:20|"fifteen … twenty"|"The Goblin, slowly turning in the tide, came end on just in time. The monstrous buoy slid past with hardly a foot to spare, while Titty frantically poked at it with the mop. It was ten yards off … fifteen … twenty … It faded into the fog."|"We Didn't Mean to Go to Sea"|"Arthur Ransome"

From the cockpit they watched John slither along the cabin roof to the foredeck. They saw him pull first at one and then at another of the ropes until he had made sure of having found the right one. They saw him pulling on it hand over hand. The head of the mainsail shook itself free of the mass of red canvas and began to climb the mast. It stuck. John was scrambling aft to cast off a tyer half way along the boom. Susan and Titty, ill as they were feeling, jumped to cast off other tyers close above their heads. The sail was all loose now, and a great fold of it suddenly filled with wind, billowed up, and flopped down again. John was hauling away again. Up went the big sail, foot after foot up the mast, bellying as it rose. Again it stuck."|"We Didn't Mean to Go to Sea"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"“Susan,” he said. “It’s ten o’clock. Don’t you think I might dig out a bit of chocolate. I know just where it is.”"|"We Didn't Mean to Go to Sea"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 10:00"|"Ten o’clock"|"“Ten o’clock,” exclaimed Susan. “Look out of the way, Rogie. It’s time everybody had something to eat …”"|"We Didn't Mean to Go to Sea"|"Arthur Ransome"
"> 12:00"|"after midday"|"“I suppose you haven’t seen her anywhere?” said Mother quietly, just as if it did not really matter very much. “Some of my young ones are in her with Mr Brading, and I was a little worried yesterday when it came on so thick after midday, and then all that wind and rain.”"|"We Didn't Mean to Go to Sea"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap > 02:00"|"after two o’clock"|"She opened one side of the door a little way so that she could see the clock.
“I say, it’s after two o’clock. You must be awfully tired.”
“Only sleepy,” said John. “My eyes will keep shutting. Look here. It’ll be all right if you talk to keep me awake.”"|"We Didn't Mean to Go to Sea"|"Arthur Ransome"

He read: “Patient’s name …” Someone had written in ink, “Unknown Seaman.? Dane?? …” Then he saw the word “Pulse,” and after it a row of figures … “Temperature,” and another lot of figures. “Notes.” Under that someone had written, “Injection A.2,” and “Sleeping Draught, 9 p.m.” Then he saw that someone had drawn a line in pencil from the space for “Patient’s Name” down to the bottom of the card, where, in round, clear handwriting, he read the words, “Talks English.”"|"We Didn't Mean to Go to Sea"|"Arthur Ransome"
