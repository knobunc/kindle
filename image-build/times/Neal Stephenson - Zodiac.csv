ourselves into a berth meant for one. That was okay, since today was
our first time. But in a week or so we'd need a kingsize waterbed. Fisk
hung out on the deck in a sleeping bag, drinking brandy and making
Artemis laugh. Jim just curled up next to the tiller, looking at the
stars and thinking about whatever a forty-five-year-old sea drifter
thinks about. The Atlantic rocked us to sleep, even as it was killing
some more dolphins. The Toxic Jolly Roger grinned down over one and all."|Zodiac|"Neal Stephenson"

with genes. Looking for the Holy Grail."|Zodiac|"Neal Stephenson"

close in to shore. As soon as the Swiss flack started in with his

loud, in neutral, forcing him to raise his voice. That's very
important. They want to be media cool, like JFK, and if you make them
shout they become media hot, like Nixon. I started thinking about
five-o'clock shadows and how we could cast one on a flack's face. An
idle inspiration that was probably too subtle for us."|Zodiac|"Neal Stephenson"

up there, answering the phone, and armed. He was into some kind of
martial art that involved samurai swords, so I felt better. I took
another shower and then started drinking. Bart and I sat in the living

THE DAY
was brute labor. We lined the back of the U-Haul with plastic and
dumped the cement and the gravel in a big mound and stirred it
together. Then I went out and found a bar. Around 11:30 I tore myself
away from a ski-ball game and allowed myself to be picked up by Alan
and Frank in the U-Haul. We drove down to the Boner plant, found the
cul-de-sac, and backed the truck up to the manhole. The rest was
simple, stupid and obvious. We lifted the lid. We didn't have a manhole
cracker, but a big strong guy like Frank can do it with a prybar and a
chisel. We formed an assembly line, shoveling the cement and gravel
mixture into the gunny sacks and stacking them in the sewer line until
it was filled, top to bottom, side to side. Then we did it again so we
had a double-thickness wall. We even pounded a few segments of rebar
into it to make it all the stronger. By that time the sewer had backed
up about halfway and dioxin-laden juices were oozing out between the
sacks. I got sick because I'd had three dozen red-hot chicken wings in
the course of my ski-ball, and I had to toss them right down the
manhole. Probably not the first half-digested load of hot wings to
visit those sewers."|Zodiac|"Neal Stephenson"
07:00|"7:00 A.M."|"For a night gig,
this one turned out to be not bad from the media-circus point of view.
No one knew why we were parked here - we figured we'd let them puzzle
it out for themselves - but Buffalo loves to see scruffy
environmentalists irritate Boner Chemical. A crew came around with
donuts at 7:00 A.M. and interviewed us for a local morning show. A
whole series of panjan-drums from Boner came around and told us to get
off Boner property or we'd be arrested, and we told each one that we
were on a public street, not Boner property. Then they sent some
lawyers around to tell us the same thing, as though the messenger would
make a difference. The cops came around once or twice and we showed
them the official city maps. We also pointed out that there were no NO
PARKING signs in this vicinity. That satisfied them. California cops
would have beat us up and searched our rectums for crack, but these
guys thought we were nice, spunky kids."|Zodiac|"Neal Stephenson"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"WHEN I GOT
BACK HOME there was the usual post-trip crap to take care of. Mail and
messages. Had to get a birthday present for Auntie. Had to sign a bunch
of papers to continue Tanya's “studies” at GEE. They shut off our phone
service so we all had to sit down and thrash out about three months'
worth of unpaid long-distance bills. In the middle of a spirited
discussion of who had made seven consecutive calls to Santa Cruz at
three in the morning, Ike got up and announced that he was moving out.
He was tired of the plumbing problems, he said, and the weird messages
on the answering machine, and Roscommon had come in while he was at
work and torn down the Mel King campaign poster on our front balcony.
That was okay. Ike was a shitty gardener anyway and he complained when
I ran my model trains after bedtime. Tess and Laurie, the lesbian
carpenters, announced that they liked the kitchen better after we'd
untrashed it and cleaned it up, so why not try to keep it that way? I
pointed out that I had bought three new badminton birdies before I left
for Buffalo and now they were all gone. Should we call this place a
“co-op” or a “commune”? How about calling it a “house”? Who had
scrubbed the Teflon off the big frying pan?"|Zodiac|"Neal Stephenson"

And then, deliverance. Bart pulled the van forward; I got out and
replaced the lid; and we were the fuck out of there. Not a single gang

at a Louisiana catfish restaurant for a 1:00 A.M. dinner."|Zodiac|"Neal Stephenson"

cruising around this well-scrubbed development at four in the morning
in our battered black van with an environmental group's Zodiac strapped
to its roof, we pulled in at a gas station-cafe on Route 9, just a
couple of blocks away. We topped off the van and filled up the Zodiac's
tanks with 50:1 mix, all on the GEE gold card. We went in for more
coffee. What the fuck, we scarfed down tremendous breakfasts and
punched some tunes on the jukebox. We struck up a warm relationship
with our waitress, Marlene. We asked her about the industrial park and
she started rattling off the names of the occupants."|Zodiac|"Neal Stephenson"

It's about 1:00 A.M. Look, I borrowed the Omni and took it to a party,

this is happening. I heard something outside, looked out the window,
there was a big guy out there - in a suit - and there was a big black
car waiting next to him, and this guy just got into the car with keys
and started it up and drove away. They already had keys made.”"|Zodiac|"Neal Stephenson"
"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"I ran out of gas
half a mile off the coast sometime before noon. It was time to start
hitting the LSD. I'd been up for more than twenty-four hours, I hurt
real bad, I'd thrown my back out hauling on that ripcord and now I had
to paddle this son of a bitch through a rainstorm. Fortunately the
swell had gone down to about five feet.. I was carrying the acid on a
sheet of paper in my wallet, a sheet of blotter paper with a bogus map
drawn on it, stuck behind Debbie's graduation picture. When I took it
out, I sat and looked at that photo for a while and started crying. A

It was 1:00 A.M. on a Friday night. Within a couple of hours we'd found
Survival Game headquarters - a fairly new log cabin built up against
some private forest. As we were pulling around into a parking space,
our headlights swept through the cockpits of several parked cars,
mostly beaters from the Seventies, and we caught brief silhouettes of
men in baseball caps sitting up to look at us. Jim and I unrolled some
sleeping bags on the ground, quietly, and went to sleep. Boone drove
out to scavenge some newspapers and see if he could figure out Pleshy's
schedule for the next couple of days."|Zodiac|"Neal Stephenson"

their new toys, Kelvin's wife, Charlotte, fetching big tumblers of
cranraz. All the kids were running around either naked or in diapers
and pretty soon I joined them as Charlotte wouldn't let me out of the
foyer without removing my pants. All I managed to hang on to was my
colored jockey shorts and my t-shirt. Boone had to give up his socks

anchorwoman's shoulder, they had him labeled as “Winchester.” So nobody
had recognized him. That was probably good, though I didn't really know
if it mattered. They spent a while on Boone and Pleshy, then moved
onward to Dolmacher, showing a police cordon around his house, and a
closet shot of Bathtub Man being hauled out in a sack."|Zodiac|"Neal Stephenson"

Bart and I were standing in the parking lot of the Charles River

surrounded on all sides by toxic water. Boone was on a ship that was
probably headed for Everett right now. When it got there, my favorite
environmentalist, Smirnoff, was going to blow it up. Laughlin and the
other bad guys would die. That was good. Our sailor friend, the skipper
and Boone would probably die too, though. And the evidence we wanted so
badly, the tank full of concentrated organophosphates down in the belly
of the ship, would become shrapnel. The PCB bugs would be gone from the
Harbor, with no way to trace them back to Basco. Pleshy would become
president of the United States and eight-year-old schoolchildren would
write him letters. My aunt would tell me what a great man he was and
military bands would precede him everywhere. And, what really hurt: Hoa

bottom fish would do to your health, especially to the health of unborn
children. Tried to make it simple: no chemical terms, no words like

persuaded Hoa to translate it to Vietnamese for me. Took it to an
interpreter at City Hospital and got her to translate it into
Cambodian. Had a friend do it in Spanish. Put them all together on a
sign, sort of a toxic Rosetta Stone, made numerous copies and then made
a few midnight trips to the piers where they like to do this fishing.

Bastards' private detectives. There was nothing subtle about the tail,
they were just trying to intimidate. Tanya, our other Boston
participant, was driving the car and Debbie was lying down in the back
seat. Tanya led the tail onto a twisting road that wasn't sympathetic
to the Lincoln Town Car following them. She thrashed the Omni for five
minutes or so, putting half a mile between herself and the private
dicks, then threw a 180 in the middle of the road - a skill she'd
learned on snowy Maine roads last February while we were driving up to
Montreal to get some French fries. Debbie jumped out and crouched in
the ditch. Tanya took off and soon passed the Lincoln going the other
way. The private dicks in the Lincoln were forced to make an
eleven-point turn across the road, then peeled out trying to catch up
with her."|Zodiac|"Neal Stephenson"

Artemis powered up her favorite Zode and prominently roared off,
heading for some dim lights about half a mile away. The lights belonged
to a twenty-foot coast guard boat that was assigned to keep an eye on
us. It happens that boats of that size don't have cooking facilities,
so Artemis had whipped up a couple of extra omelets, put them in a
cooler to keep them warm and was headed out to give these guys
breakfast. She took off flashing, glowing and smoking like a UFO, and
within a couple of minutes we could hear her greeting the coast guards
with an enthusiasm that was obscene at that time of the morning. They
greeted her right back. They knew one another from previous Blowfish
