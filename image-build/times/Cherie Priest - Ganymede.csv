"ap 07:50"|"ten till eight"|"“The time? Oh, yes.” Josephine reached into her front left pocket and retrieved a watch. It was an engineer’s design with a glass cutout in the cover, allowing her to see the hour at a glance. “It’s ten till eight. Don’t worry, your meeting with Mr. Spring has not been compromised—though, knowing him, he’s already waiting downstairs.”"|Ganymede|"Cherie Priest"
12:00|noon|"Even when he was standing at street level on Seattle’s topside, Andan Cly still felt like he was underneath something. A long shadow covered much of the contained city, cast by the two-hundred-foot wall that surrounded it, and the sky above was gray like usual. Even at the very height of noon, any light that managed to make it past the shadow was filtered and dim. Direct sunlight, on those few days of the year when it appeared, was never quite brilliant within the wall, either. Every speck of illumination—from the sun, from the ever-present lanterns—was rendered thick and watery by years of accumulated blight gas, which filled the blocks with a thick, yellowish fog."|Ganymede|"Cherie Priest"
"ap 09:30"|"nine thirty"|"There weren’t many people on board—not at this hour, coming up close to nine thirty, and not with the curfew dealing a death blow to the nightlife."|Ganymede|"Cherie Priest"
00:00|midnight|"“I wouldn’t write them off yet,” Gifford argued as another streak of antiaircraft fire broke the velvet blackness of the marshland midnight. “They were caught off guard, that’s all. Texas will get bored. They’ll eventually figure out Ganymede isn’t there and wander off—or the Lafittes will safely abandon the place and restore it later.”"|Ganymede|"Cherie Priest"
00:00|midnight|"The blower drifted from violent night to sudden midnight, emerging on the other side of the mouse hole into a ground-floor warren that was more mud than water. It heaved and skidded sideways up onto the closest bank, lodging itself in the mud and settling with a wet sucking sound."|Ganymede|"Cherie Priest"
00:00|midnight|"“The city goes home at sundown,” she said, swooshing the broom back and forth, clearing a day’s worth of dust from the two short steps. “Ever since those two Texians went missing. As if the world ought to stop for a pair of brownbacks without the sense to come up from the river at midnight.” The woman spit fast and hard, leaving a damp spot on the cobbled walkway."|Ganymede|"Cherie Priest"
"> 12:00"|"Shortly after noon"|"Shortly after noon—perhaps half an hour later—Marylin announced herself with a delicate knock on the open office door."|Ganymede|"Cherie Priest"
00:00|midnight|"She took the next turn and proceeded via dead reckoning, the kind that was engraved in her blood. She’d lived in the Quarter all her life, and she knew it like the corridors of the Garden Court. She could have navigated it blindfolded, in the fog, at midnight. Even so, her heart pounded, and she did not know why. She knew only that she had to keep moving. “Because of the curfew,” she muttered to herself, but did not believe a word of it."|Ganymede|"Cherie Priest"
