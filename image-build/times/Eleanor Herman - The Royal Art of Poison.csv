The king generally preferred to dine at one o’clock in his own apartments. Though he was the only one eating, he wasn’t alone. In addition to the bevy of servants assisting him, courtiers and ambassadors stood watching him. Sometimes the king joined the court and the rest of the royal family at a banquet where the protocol was even more stifling, and members of the public were allowed to walk by, gaping at the sight of a monarch chewing."|"The Royal Art of Poison"|"Eleanor Herman"

It is not known if the mad former monarch noticed a metallic taste to his soup. But within a few hours, Erik complained of pain in his stomach and chest and took to his bed.

In the case of a royal illness, protocol demanded that a team of doctors—as many as a dozen—assist the patient, confer and consult with one another, and write copious notes on symptoms and treatment. But the official report on Erik’s final illness was written by two priests in the vaguest of terms. Erik had been sick for years, they said, complaining of pain in his chest and stomach. After feeling ill for several days, they reported, he received Holy Communion, lay quietly, and died at two o’clock on the morning of February 26.

Though a girl could legally consummate a marriage at twelve and a boy at fourteen, many people felt that sex at such a young age could stunt growth and cause mental retardation, even death. Adolescents, it was believed, required the bodily humors voided by sex to develop their still-growing brains and other organs. They were right about early marriage endangering girls, though for the wrong reasons. An immature reproductive tract can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, and health complications. In the developing world today, girls under twenty are twice as likely to die during pregnancy or childbirth, and girls under fifteen are five times more likely."|"The Royal Art of Poison"|"Eleanor Herman"

She thought she would die while her foot was in the water. “The priest gave her a crucifix, she took it and kissed it ardently. Her strength failed her and she let it fall, losing the power of speech at almost the same moment as her life.

For years, Marie Louise had eaten mostly oysters, olives, and cucumbers, just as her mother had only consumed milk for weeks at a time, possibly because these foods did not irritate a gastric ulcer. At five o’clock on the morning of February 10, 1689, Marie Louise awoke with excruciating pain, vomiting, and diarrhea, and died two days later. Marie Louise had so feared being poisoned at the treacherous Spanish court she had asked Louis XIV for antidotes. Everyone at the courts of both France and Spain believed she had been murdered for not giving her impotent husband, the horrifically inbred Carlos II, an heir. But in retrospect, it is possible she inherited from her mother a genetic predisposition to gastric ulcers."|"The Royal Art of Poison"|"Eleanor Herman"

After studying all the reports, he wrote that the average amount of polonium in an individual who has died of natural causes is between 25 and 50 millibecquerels per gram of calcium, a tiny level from the decay of radon naturally occurring in the environment. “Arafat’s ribs were around 900 millibecquerels,” Barclay pointed out. “That is 18 to 36 times more than the average, even at the time of exhumation. And remember, that took place over eight years later when the polonium-210 had been reduced by twenty-one half-lives. So at the time of his death in 2004, he had over two million times that level circulating in his blood and being deposited in his bones.” He added that results showed that the polonium-210 had been manufactured in a nuclear reactor.

Then they put caustic plasters on the soles of his feet to raise blisters. The learned physicians prepared potions for him that induced violent vomiting and a steady stream of diarrhea. They gave Charles a drink with Spanish fly, also known as cantharides, an irritant that causes topical blistering. But when it is consumed, cantharides weakens the kidneys and causes burning urination and sometimes death. To prevent him from biting his tongue during his convulsions, they jammed a stick into his mouth, which wounded his throat. Then they took ten ounces of blood from his jugular vein. They fed him extract of human skull and the magical bezoar stone. As he slipped into unconsciousness, they took another twelve ounces of blood.
