He'll go on battering away at us until he's squeezed us dry of reserves--and all because you, Kahlenberge, made a palpably ill-advised choice. God knows where it'll lead to.""
9.59 a.m.
The battalion commanders of the Nibelungen Division had turned out in full force to hear General Tanz deliver his first situation report since returning from leave."|"The Night of the Generals"|"Hans Hellmut Kirst"
10:10|"10.10 a.m."|"""Headquarters gave us three weeks to patch up the Division. My G.S.O.1 estimated that it would take two weeks. I put the time at ten days. Well, we're going to beat that. During the course of this afternoon I shall start inspecting units for combat readiness. Stand by for my arrival.""
10.10 a.m.
A telephone rang on a desk in an office building in the Rue de Surene. The desk belonged to Colonel Finckh, Chief of Staff to the Quartermaster-General, Western Command."|"The Night of the Generals"|"Hans Hellmut Kirst"
11:15|"11.15 a.m."|"Hitler's end seemed imminent.
11.15 a.m.
Inspector Prevert began his regular daily conference at the Surete. Persons present: an inspector of the secret police, a municipal police officer, a detective-inspector from the criminal branch and two officers on special duties. Purpose of the meeting: a review of the general situation with special reference to any points which might have a bearing on Franco-German co-operation."|"The Night of the Generals"|"Hans Hellmut Kirst"
11:47|"11.47 a.m."|"The detective-inspector passed it across to him. Only one unusual feature caught Prevert's eye, and that was the signature. It read: ""Kahlenberge, Lieutenant-General, Chief of Staff.""
11.47 a.m.
Lance-Corporal Rainer Hartmann gazed at the sloping ceiling above his head. It was decorated with pictures cut from magazines. There were no illustrations of people or buildings, only woods and fields, flowers and animals."|"The Night of the Generals"|"Hans Hellmut Kirst"
12:30|"12.30 p.m."|"""That's all right with me,"" she told him, smiling. ""I'm not so keen to show you off in front of people, you know. More than half the world's population are women! I'll keep you all to myself for as long as possible.""
12.30 p.m.
In answer to an urgent summons, General von Seydlitz-Gabler went to see his wife at the Hotel Excelsior. He found her in the drawing-room of her suite with Ulrike. Both women looked resentful."|"The Night of the Generals"|"Hans Hellmut Kirst"
13:25|"1.25 p.m."|"""Hartmann a deserter?"" Frau Wilhelmine regarded her daughter's waxen face with unabashed triumph. ""You see! That's the sort of man you've been consorting with! A thoroughly untrustworthy specimen--a deserter!""
1.25 p.m.
Prevert and Grau had left their respective offices and gone to meet each other--half way, so to speak--at the Relais Bisson, a restaurant on the Quai. Their pretext for this meeting, a plausible one, was a consignment of fresh lobsters and a bottle of Chablis. Grau had recently exploited every available opportunity to profit from Prevert's extensive knowledge of cuisine, cellar and criminal procedure."|"The Night of the Generals"|"Hans Hellmut Kirst"
14:07|"2.07 p.m."|"""Absolutely anything. A whole wagonload of French patriots, if you like.""
1.50--2.07 p.m.
A telephone conversation between Inspector Prevert and General Kahlenberge, conducted from the porter's lodge of the hotel attached to the Relais Bisson. The house exchange was cut off and Lieutenant-Colonel Grau listened in. After a few preliminary courtesies, the following dialogue took place:"|"The Night of the Generals"|"Hans Hellmut Kirst"
14:04|"2.04 p.m."|"Prevert: ""Good. All the best, then. I'll keep in touch.""
2.04 p.m.
Once again the Quartermaster-General's office at Zossen came on the line asking for Colonel Finckh, and once again Finckh heard the quiet, unemotional unfamiliar voice. This time it said: ""Gone off."" Then the 'phone went dead."|"The Night of the Generals"|"Hans Hellmut Kirst"
14:08|"2.08 p.m."|"Why wait any longer?
2.08 p.m.
Inspector Prevert outlined his plan of action to Lieutenant-Colonel Grau:"|"The Night of the Generals"|"Hans Hellmut Kirst"
14:52|"2.52 p.m."|"""Of course. But then I'll make a thorough job of it.""
2.52 p.m.
General von Seydlitz-Gabler was resting. He had doffed his uniform jacket, pulled off his glossy shoes and opened his waist-band. He lay motionless on the bed, his slightly parted lips emitting an occasional rattling sound."|"The Night of the Generals"|"Hans Hellmut Kirst"
15:45|"3.45 p.m."|"""But you haven't received it yet, so it's not official. What do you expect me to do, Kahlenberge? Why must you insist on pestering me with vague assumptions? I badly need my afternoon sleep. Kindly bear that in mind.""
3.45 p.m.
A preliminary conference in Inspector Prevert's office at the Surete. Those present: Lieutenant-Colonel Grau and Inspector Prevert. Matters under discussion:"|"The Night of the Generals"|"Hans Hellmut Kirst"
16:06|"4.06 p.m."|"""Here's where we'll start,"" he said. ""You know, Colonel, elementary reasoning turns up trumps again and again, mainly because people tend to be elementary themselves. They think and act accordingly, especially when they're in a hurry. Leave this part of it to me and concentrate on your generals.""
4.06 p.m.
The Headquarters of the G.O.C.-in-C., France, were located in the Hotel Majestic. The conspirators waiting there included the G.O.C.-in-C. himself--General von Stulpnagel--and several members of his staff, among them Lieutenant-Colonel Casar von Hofacker, hub of the conspiracy in Paris."|"The Night of the Generals"|"Hans Hellmut Kirst"
16:26|"4.26 p.m."|"""The coup d'etat is under way. Government offices are being occupied at this moment.""
4.26 p.m.
After a brief but vigorous interrogation of the proprietor of the Mocambo Bar, Inspector Prevert was directed to an address in the Rue de l'Universite, near the Pont des Invalides. Here he climbed to the third floor, which comprised two studios and a number of attic rooms."|"The Night of the Generals"|"Hans Hellmut Kirst"
17:52|"5.52 p.m."|"""Don't worry,"" Prevert said encouragingly. ""I have a feeling that you're over the worst. You may be luckier than you know, if anyone can be described as lucky in times like these.""
5.52 p.m.
General von Stulpnagel, G.O.C.-in-C., France, summoned the G.O.C. of the Greater Paris area."|"The Night of the Generals"|"Hans Hellmut Kirst"
17:58|"5.58 p.m."|"The G.O.C. took the proffered map showing the location of all S.S. and S.D. barracks, clicked his heels again, and withdrew.

General Kahlenberge received more news from Berlin, again via his old and trusted friend in the Bendlerstrasse. Apparently, all was going according to plan."|"The Night of the Generals"|"Hans Hellmut Kirst"
18:08|"6.08 p.m."|"""Perhaps, but I suggest we keep on the move. It would be foolhardy to sit around in our offices waiting to be picked up. You know at least three places where I can be reached. I've got a couple of your telephone numbers. Let's try our luck. One more thing: Lance-Corporal Hartmann is locked up in a cell at the Suirete. He's not ready to talk yet, but it can only be a matter of minutes. I'll keep you posted.""
6.08 p.m.
The code-word ""Valkyrie"" reached von Seydlitz-Gabler's headquarters. As soon as the signal came through, Kahlenberge hurried in to see the G.O.C."|"The Night of the Generals"|"Hans Hellmut Kirst"
18:18|"6.18 p.m."|"He turned to Sandauer. ""Alert all units under my command. And make it clear, in case anyone needs reminding of the fact, that in my division only my orders count. No one else has any jurisdiction over it.""
6.18 p.m.
Inspector Prevert looked at his watch. Hours had passed, and that at a time when every minute was precious. Prevert had taken off his coat, loosened his tie and opened his collar. He was chain-smoking."|"The Night of the Generals"|"Hans Hellmut Kirst"
18:49|"6.49 p.m."|"""I distrust everyone!"" Hartmann shouted. ""Why should I confide in you? I don't know who you are or who you're working for. I've seen everything now. As far as I'm concerned, anything's possible, and the viler it is the more likely it is. You can string me up for all I care. It's only what I'd expect.""
6.49 p.m.
Lieutenant-General Tanz, escorted by a motorized unit, drove to Corps Headquarters. As his staff car screeched to a halt, Tanz pumped the sub-machine-gun in his right hand up and down three times. Men swarmed from the trucks and raced to take up their prearranged positions, blocking every exit and entrance and occupying the surrounding area."|"The Night of the Generals"|"Hans Hellmut Kirst"
19:04|"7.04 p.m."|"Von Seydlitz-Gabler hastened to assure Tanz of his unqualified support. ""This is an emergency. No one shall say that I failed my country in its hour of need.""

7.19 p.m.
General Kahlenberge walked into the Hotel Majestic, headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief, France, and made his way to General von Stulpnagel's office. The place was buzzing like a beehive, and Kahlenberge's heart beat higher at the sight of so much bustling activity. He asked to speak to the G.O.C.-in-C."|"The Night of the Generals"|"Hans Hellmut Kirst"
19:52|"7.52 p.m."|"""Goddammit!"" Kahlenberge said helplessly.
7.52 p.m.
Going in search of General Tanz, Lieutenant-Colonel Grau found him at Corps Headquarters. Tanz was sitting at the G.O.C.'s desk in full battle order except for his steel helmet. General von Seydlitz-Gabler, virtually demoted for the time being, was obligingly signing or confirming all orders issued in his name."|"The Night of the Generals"|"Hans Hellmut Kirst"

8.20 p.m.
At the operational headquarters of Army Group West in La Roche-Guyon, Field-Marshal von Kluge turned to General von Stulpnagel and his companions. ""Well, gentlemen,"" he said tersely, ""they've bungled it."" With that, the Field-Marshal had said all he had to say. His mind was made up. General von Stulpnagel turned deathly pale."|"The Night of the Generals"|"Hans Hellmut Kirst"
21:20|"9.20 p.m."|"""For you, I imagine, my dear General.""
9.20 p.m.
Inspector Prevert's influence had so far remained unimpaired. The police departments under his supervision still obeyed his orders and his network of contacts appeared to be functioning as well as ever."|"The Night of the Generals"|"Hans Hellmut Kirst"
21:30|"21.30 hrs"|"I am being forcibly detained. The bearer will give youmore details. Mobilize the whole squad at once.

An ""order of the day"" issued by the Commander-in-Chief of the German Navy reached Paris. It opened with the words:"|"The Night of the Generals"|"Hans Hellmut Kirst"

10.30 p.m.
The military commander of the Greater Paris area, Lieutenant-General Boineburg-Lengsfield, directed operations against the S.D. and S.S. in person, escorted by members of his staff. He was bold enough to wait until this juncture because Retreat was at 10 p.m. and he wanted to bottle up as many men as possible simultaneously."|"The Night of the Generals"|"Hans Hellmut Kirst"

10.38 p.m.
Grau's flying squad drew up outside the prison. His picked men overran the sentries and stormed into the cellars, where they came up against the battle-seasoned detachment from the Nibelungen Division. The two parties flew at each other's throats like beasts of prey--or, in more prosaic language: fierce hand-to-hand fighting took place."|"The Night of the Generals"|"Hans Hellmut Kirst"
