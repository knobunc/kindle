00:00|midnight|"We had left Barsoom about the middle of the eighth zode, which is equivalent to midnight earth-time; and a rather rough computation of the distance to be travelled and our estimated speed, suggested that we should arrive on Thuria about noon of the following day."|"Swords of Mars"|"Edgar Rice Burroughs"
"< 12:00"|"near noon"|"Each day, near noon, our single meal was served to us. It was always the same. We each received a large jar of water, I a bowl of food, and Umka a cage containing one of the strange bird-like animals which apparently formed his sole diet."|"Swords of Mars"|"Edgar Rice Burroughs"
"< 00:00"|"before midnight"|"“Whenever you can bring them without danger of detection, but certainly before midnight tonight.”"|"Swords of Mars"|"Edgar Rice Burroughs"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"I went at once to the window, after rebolting the door. It was very dark outside. I had wanted to wait until after midnight and until the castle was asleep before I attempted to put into practice the plan I contemplated for the rescue of Ozara, but the knowledge that they were searching the castle for me forced me to put aside every consideration except haste."|"Swords of Mars"|"Edgar Rice Burroughs"
"~ 00:00"|"around midnight"|"It was half after the eighth zode, or around midnight earth-time, that we reached Gar Nal’s. Rapas admitted us and led us to the third level of the house, up narrow ramps at the rear of the building where we met no one. We moved silently without speaking, and at last our guide halted before a door."|"Swords of Mars"|"Edgar Rice Burroughs"
"~ 20:05"|"about twenty-five"|"That evening I spent alone with Dejah Thoris; and about twenty-five xats past the eighth zode, or at midnight earth time, I changed to a plain leather harness without insignia, and prepared to leave upon my adventure."|"Swords of Mars"|"Edgar Rice Burroughs"
