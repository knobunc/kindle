07:00|"seven a.m."|"‘Yes, sir. The poet Browning in his Pippa Passes, having established that the hour is seven a.m., goes on to say, “The lark’s on the wing, the snail’s on the thorn.” ‘"|"Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"‘I’m going down to the country this afternoon to stay with some people. I’m taking the four o’clock train at Paddington.’"|"Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
"ap 02:35"|2.35|"She spoke lightly, but I found myself eyeing her with a certain respect. Myself, I’ve never found a host and hostess who could stick my presence for more than about a week. Indeed, long before that as a general rule the conversation at the dinner table is apt to turn on the subject of how good the train service to London is, those present obviously hoping wistfully that Bertram will avail himself of it. Not to mention the time-tables left in your room with a large cross against the 2.35 and the legend ‘Excellent train. Highly recommended.’"|"Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
"ap 03:00"|"Three o’clock"|"Let’s just review the situation. Ever since breakfast my guardian angel had been scaring the pants off me by practically saying in so many words that Totleigh Towers was all set to re-enter my life, and it was now clear that what he had had in mind had been the imminence of this plea to me to go there, he feeling that in a weak moment I might allow myself to be persuaded against my better judgment. The peril was now past. Totleigh Towers had made its spring and missed by a mile, and I no longer had a thing to worry about. It was with a light heart that I joined a group of pleasure-seekers who were playing Darts and cleaned them up with effortless skill. Three o’clock was approaching when I left the club en route for home, and it must have been getting on for half past when I hove alongside the apartment house where I have my abode."|"Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"‘I wish I could, but I can’t,’ he sighed. ‘I should miss my train. I’m off to Totleigh on the four o’clock at Paddington.’"|"Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
"ap ~ 04:40"|"about four-forty"|"We had made goodish going on the road, and it wasn’t more than about four-forty when I rang the front-door bell. Jeeves took the car to the stables, and the butler - Butterfield was his name, I remembered - led me to the drawing-room."|"Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"At that lunch of ours she had told me in no uncertain terms that she was off to Totleigh on the four o’clock train that afternoon, and however leisurely its progress it must have got there by this time, because Gussie had travelled on it and he had fetched up at the joint all right. But I could detect no sign of her on the premises. It seemed to me, sifting the evidence, that only one conclusion could be arrived at, that she had been pulling the Wooster leg."|"Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"‘You said it. I seek in vain for a solution. When I gave her lunch yesterday, she told me she was off on the four o’clock train to go and stay at Totleigh Towers, and the point I want to drive home is that she hasn’t arrived. You remember the day I lunched at the Ritz?’"|"Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
"> 00:00"|"shortly after midnight"|"‘Yes, sir. I found him most co-operative. He plans to present himself in the kitchen shortly after midnight. Cold steak and kidney pie is, of course, merely a palliative -‘"|"Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"‘She explained that fully to me on the train. It appears that she’s dependent on a monthly allowance from her father in New York, and normally she gets by reasonably comfortably on this. But early this month she was unfortunate in her investments on the turf. Sunny Jim in the three o’clock at Kempton Park.’"|"Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
00:00|midnight|"Elsewhere, however, being just where I wasn’t, I had no option but to grapple with this midnight marauder, and when I did so I was glad to find that he was apparently one who had stunted his growth by smoking as a boy. There was a shrimp-like quality about him which I found most encouraging. It seemed to me that it would be an easy task to throttle him into submission, and I was getting down to it with a hearty good will when my hand touched what were plainly spectacles and at the same moment a stifled ‘Hey, look out for my glasses!’ told me my diagnosis had been all wrong. This was no thief in the night, but an old crony with whom in boyhood days I had often shared my last bar of milk chocolate."|"Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
01:00|"one o’clock in the morning"|"It was a moment fraught with embarrassment. It’s bad enough to be caught by your host prowling about his house after hours even when said host is a warm admirer and close personal friend, and I have, I think, made it clear that Pop Bassett was not one of my fans. He could barely stand the sight of me by daylight, and I suppose I looked even worse to him at one o’clock in the morning."|"Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
"~ 01:00"|"about one a.m."|"‘Yes, we got together in the hall at, I suppose, about one a.m. I had gone down to see if I could get a bit of that steak and kidney pie.’"|"Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
