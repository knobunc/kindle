They had breakfast at eight and worked inside the burrow after that, as there were a great many Human Beings about because of the warm weather. Lunch, a not very big meal, was served at one, and there were a few more jobs to do, and then at three, sharp bells rang up and down the passages and all the Wombles, Great Uncle Bulgaria included, went to their beds and slept, or tried to. At ten the bells were rung again, and up and down the burrow Wombles stirred and brushed themselves and cleaned their teeth and looked at their excited reflections in mirrors. For the Midsummer party is the biggest, most important and happiest occasion of the year."|"The Wombles"|"Elisabeth Beresford"

By ten thirty, with eyes shining and fur gleaming, they were lining up by the main door, where Tomsk, looking very important, was on duty with a list of names. At ten forty-five there was a rumbling noise and Tobermory, wearing a flat cap, goggles and a long coat, appeared at the wheel of the Silver Womble which bore the number plate:"|"The Wombles"|"Elisabeth Beresford"

00:00|midnight|"Slowly and very carefully the Silver Womble moved across Wimbledon Common beneath the golden light of the rising moon. Tobermory, who was always very thorough, had taken the time and trouble to study all the latest road maps, so he completed the journey to Battersea Park without a hitch, dropping his party at the gates at exactly midnight."|"The Wombles"|"Elisabeth Beresford"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"By one o’clock every single Wimbledon Womble – and Cousin Yellowstone of course – was in Battersea Park. They strolled about and had a look at the River Thames, which had turned to silver in the moonlight, and admired the flower beds and the lake and the tennis courts. The deer looked rather startled, but soon went back to sleep again and one or two rabbits and a few squirrels came out to see what was going on, but the Wombles, naturally, ignored them."|"The Wombles"|"Elisabeth Beresford"
"ap 02:10"|"ten minutes past two"|"As always Great Uncle Bulgaria was perfectly correct. The rain started with a soft sighing sound at ten minutes past two. As the night wore on the rain grew heavier and heavier and when the first Wombles stirred just before dawn it was coming down in steady driving sheets which were so thick you could hardly see through them."|"The Wombles"|"Elisabeth Beresford"

Orinoco blinked his eyes and made a sound which was almost a sob. He was so upset that for a minute or two he didn’t realise that something unusual was happening by the flashing lights of the black and white crossing. Then it did slowly occur to him that there was a great deal of activity for one o’clock in the morning, so he edged towards the snowy bushes to investigate."|"The Wombles"|"Elisabeth Beresford"
