"ap 10:40"|Ten-forty|"""Ten-forty,"" said the console clock politely. He used the ladder instead of the small one-person lift to get up to the catwalk, hoping the exertion would keep his muscles from knotting. Just as he reached the top, something in his pocket dug into his thigh. The key to the freight elevator; he'd forgotten to return it to Security. The hell with it. If they wanted it, let them come and get it."|Synners|"Pat Cadigan"
"ap 03:00"|three|"""My plans for him don't concern you. Just stay with him,"" Rivera said, getting up. ""I've got quite a lot of other things to take care of before I meet with our friend here; he won't be going anywhere, either."" He picked up the briefcase he'd left on the highly polished conference table in the center of the room. ""Download me two more copies to chip—no, make it three. Have them packed for me when I come back tomorrow, along with three copies of whatever else you tap from him between now and then. You've got supper makings in the kitchenette, full dataline subscription for your entertainment. No pharmaceuticals, I'm afraid—"""|Synners|"Pat Cadigan"
"ap 05:00"|five|"""That what you did to me last night, give me a little help?"" Keely snapped. ""You better let me detox soon, or maybe you'll come back here at five and find nothing but a little pool of shit and blood on this chair where I used to be."""|Synners|"Pat Cadigan"

11:30|"eleven-thirty in the morning"|"Have to take that up with Mom, he thought sourly. Now he was sitting on a bar stool at eleven-thirty in the morning, not caring that he was incredibly late for work, sipping bad coffee in elbow-to-elbow isolation with a rather questionable clientele. Possibly more questionable than Gina Aiesi, though he wouldn't have laid any bets."|Synners|"Pat Cadigan"
