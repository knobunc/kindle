09:00|"nine this Sunday morning"|"He let himself into her place with his thumbprint. Amelia was actually up at nine this Sunday morning, in the shower. He decided against surprising her there. Showers were dangerous places—he had slipped in one once, experimenting with a fellow clumsy teenager, and had wound up with a cut chin and bruises and a decidedly unerotic attitude toward the location (and the girl, for that matter)."|"Forever Peace"|"Joe Haldeman"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"I called Amelia from the airport and said I’d be home in a few hours, and would explain later. It would be after midnight, but she said to come straight over to her place. That was a relief. Our relationship didn’t have any restrictions, but I always hoped she slept alone, waiting, the ten days I was away."|"Forever Peace"|"Joe Haldeman"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"The waiter was a surly handsome young man who looked as if he’d stepped out of a movie poster. “Last call.”
“It’s only eleven,” Marty said.
“So maybe you get one more.”"|"Forever Peace"|"Joe Haldeman"
"ap < 02:00"|"almost two"|"All the lights were out; it was almost two. I let myself in through the back and belatedly thought I should have buzzed. What if she wasn’t alone?"|"Forever Peace"|"Joe Haldeman"
"ap 08:45"|8:45|"I slept like a creature stunned and woke to an empty house. She’d left a note on the microwave that she had a sequence scheduled at 8:45 and would see me at the lunch group meeting. It was after ten."|"Forever Peace"|"Joe Haldeman"

"ap 10:00"|ten|"It was only ten, but he answered no-face. When he heard it was me, he turned on the screen, rubbing his face. I’d obviously gotten him out of bed."|"Forever Peace"|"Joe Haldeman"
"ap ~ 01:30"|"about one-thirty"|"It was only three hours to Guadalajara, but a bad three hours. I got to the hospital about one-thirty but of course couldn’t get past the front desk. Not until seven; even then, I wouldn’t be able to see Amelia until Dr. Spencer came in, maybe eight, maybe nine."|"Forever Peace"|"Joe Haldeman"

"ap 07:00"|seven|"I went over to the waiting room at seven and read less interesting magazines for an hour and a half, when Dr. Spencer finally showed up. He was tall and blond and spoke English with a Mexican accent thick as guacamole."|"Forever Peace"|"Joe Haldeman"
"ap > 09:00"|"after nine o’clock"|"“Bueno, okay.” He picked a card out of a drawer and passed it over. “Go to this office after nine o’clock and this woman will issue you a temporary designación de responsabilidad.” He repeated it into the drawer. “State of Jalisco Temporary Assignment of Legal Responsibility,” it translated."|"Forever Peace"|"Joe Haldeman"
14:00|"two in the afternoon"|"That part was familiar from walking around Portobello. Housewives, a few men, came to the mercado every morning to haggle over the day’s supplies. Still plenty here at two in the afternoon. To an outsider, it looks as if half the stalls are scenes of pretty violent argument, voices raised, arms waving. But it’s really just part of the social routine, for vendor and customer alike. “What do you mean, ten pesos for these worthless beans? Last week they were five pesos and excellent quality!” “Your memory is fading, old woman. Last week they were eight pesos and so shriveled I couldn’t give them away! These are beans among beans!” “I could give you six pesos. I need beans for supper, and my mother knows how to soften them with soda.” “Your mother? Send your mother down here and she’ll pay me nine pesos,” and so on. It was a way to pass the time; the real battle would be between seven and eight pesos."|"Forever Peace"|"Joe Haldeman"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"When I finished the book it was only eight, still two hours before I could check on Amelia. I didn’t want to go hang around the clinic, but the mall was getting oppressively loud as it moved from evening into night-time mode. A half-dozen mariachi bands competing for attention along with the blare and rumble of modern music from the night clubs. Some very alluring women sitting in the windows of an escort service, three of them wearing PM buttons, which meant they were jacked. That would be a great way to spend the next two hours—jacksex and guilt."|"Forever Peace"|"Joe Haldeman"
"ap 01:30"|1:30|"Marty and I went down to the machine cantina in the basement. He had a cup of strong Bustelo—stay awake for the 1:30 train—and I had a beer. It turned out to be nonalcoholic, specially brewed for hospitals and schools. I told him about “Armadillo’s Number” and all."|"Forever Peace"|"Joe Haldeman"
00:00|midnight|"compromising, julian took the train up to Houston, staying just long enough to cover Amelia’s particle seminar—the students weren’t wild about having a young postdoc unexpectedly substitute for Dr. Blaze—and then caught a midnight train back to Guadalajara."|"Forever Peace"|"Joe Haldeman"

08:00|"eight in the morning"|"More than two hundred children had been squeezed into one room on the sixth floor, bound and gagged and drugged. It turned out that they were from a suburban private school. A guerrilla team had come in at eight in the morning, killed all the teachers, kidnapped all the children, and moved them into the condemned building in crates covered with UN markings, just an hour before we had gotten there."|"Forever Peace"|"Joe Haldeman"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"“And I want to see you”—he checked a desk calendar—“at ten o’clock on July ninth. I want to jack with you and check your responses to this and that. It’ll be a two-way jack; I won’t hold anything back from you.”"|"Forever Peace"|"Joe Haldeman"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"And when I came home, she was gone. Gone to see a friend in Washington, the note said. I called the base and found I could fly out to Edwards as a supernumerary if I could get my butt down there in ninety minutes. I was in the air over the Mississippi before I realized I hadn’t called the lab to arrange for someone else to monitor the scheduled runs. Was that the pills? Probably not. But there was no way to call from a military plane, so it was ten o’clock Texas time before I was able to phone the lab. Jean Gordie had covered for me, but that was pure luck; she’d come in to grade some papers, seen I wasn’t in, and checked the run schedule. She was more than slightly pissed off, since I couldn’t offer a really convincing excuse. Look, I had to take the first flight to Washington to decide whether or not to kill myself."|"Forever Peace"|"Joe Haldeman"
00:00|Midnight|"She nodded and took the cup. “And Geneva and Tokyo. I had to talk with some people at CERN and Kyoto.” She looked at her watch. “Midnight flight to Washington.”"|"Forever Peace"|"Joe Haldeman"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"It was three o’clock; I’d been gone for six hours. Peter would throw a fit. I took the Metro back and got an armload of groceries at the station store."|"Forever Peace"|"Joe Haldeman"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"At seven I put the chicken into a pot of water and dumped the frozen vegetables on top; sliced up an onion and added it with some garlic. Zapped it to a quick boil and then left it to simmer for forty-five minutes, while I put on headphones and listened to some of this new Ethiopian stuff. The enemy, but their music is more interesting than ours."|"Forever Peace"|"Joe Haldeman"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"Our custom was to eat at eight and watch at least the first part of the Harold Burley Hour, a Washington news distillation for people who could read without moving their lips."|"Forever Peace"|"Joe Haldeman"

03:00|"three in the morning"|"There were four of us in the plain conference room, besides the jacked couple: Amelia and me, Mendez, and Megan Orr, the doctor who checked out Ingram and administered the antitrank. It was three in the morning, but we were pretty wide awake."|"Forever Peace"|"Joe Haldeman"
"< 00:00"|"just before midnight"|"The next stage depended on luck. The Iridium system that provided global communication by way of a fleet of low-flying satellites had been quietly co-opted by the government after the start of the Ngumi War; all of the satellites had been replaced by dual-function ones: they still took care of phone service, but each one also spied continuously on the strip of land it passed over. Had one of them passed over Omaha, over Grand Street, just before midnight on the 11th?"|"Forever Peace"|"Joe Haldeman"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"It was after midnight by the time she got to Seaside. She got a room at the hotel closest to St. Bartholomew’s, slightly more than a kilometer away, and walked over to take a look."|"Forever Peace"|"Joe Haldeman"

03:00|"three A.M."|"The JPL action was trivially easy. A convoy pulled up at three A.M. and chased out all the night workers, and then locked the place up tight. Lawyers rejoiced, as did America’s persistent antimilitary minority. Some scientists felt the celebration was premature. If the soldiers stayed in place for a couple of weeks, constitutional issues would become irrelevant."|"Forever Peace"|"Joe Haldeman"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"This was at two in the morning. By two-thirty, all the soldiers had been awakened at gunpoint and marched to a maximum-security compound. They gave up without a shot being fired, which was not surprising, given that they faced thousands of apparently angry armed enemy prisoners. They couldn’t know that the enemy were not really angry, and constitutionally unable to pull the trigger."|"Forever Peace"|"Joe Haldeman"

"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"It was about noon. Amelia and I were dog-tired, but unwilling, almost unable, to sleep.
