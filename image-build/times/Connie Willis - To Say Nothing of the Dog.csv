We cleared every inch of the cathedral, and it wasn’t there. But it was in the cathedral during the raid. The Head of the Flower Committee, this horrible old spinster sort named Miss Sharpe—you know the type, gray hair, long nose, hard as nails—saw it at five o’clock that afternoon.

So it couldn’t be later than half past eight, and Verity couldn’t have been here more than a few minutes."|"To Say Nothing of the Dog"|"Connie Willis"
