Chief among these are the symmetries that arise from the homogeneity of space and time. Take time: apart from cosmology, where the big bang marked the beginning of time, there is nothing in physics to distinguish one moment of time from the next. Physicists say that the world is ""invariant under time translations,"" meaning that whether you take midnight or mid-day to be the zero of time in your measurements, it makes no difference to the description of physical phenomena. Physical processes do not depend on an absolute zero of time. It turns out that this symmetry under time translation directly implies one of the most basic, and also most useful, laws of physics: the law of conservation of energy. This law says that you can move energy around and change its form but you can't create or destroy it. Feynman makes this law crystal clear with his amusing story of Dennis the Menace who is always mischievously hiding his toy building blocks from his mother (Chapter Four)."|"Six Easy Pieces"|"Richard Feynman"

Atom number eight is called oxygen, etc., because the chemical properties depend upon the electrons on the  outside,  and in fact only upon  how many electrons there are. So the  chemical  properties of a substance depend only on a number, the number of electrons. (The whole list of elements of the chemists really could have been called 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. Instead of saying ""carbon,"" we could say ""element six,"" meaning six electrons, but of course, when the elements were first discovered, it was not known that they could be numbered that way, and secondly, it would make everything look rather complicated. It is better to have names and symbols for these things, rather than to call everything by number.)"|"Six Easy Pieces"|"Richard Feynman"
"ap 05:13"|5-13|"watch the stars go around each other, why can we not take a ball of lead and a marble and watch the marble go toward the ball of lead? The difficulty of this experiment when done in such a simple manner is the very weakness or delicacy of the force. It must be done with extreme care, which means covering the apparatus to keep the air out, making sure it is not electrically charged, and so on; then the force can be measured. It was first measured by Cavendish with an apparatus which is schematically indicated in Fig. 5-13. This first demonstrated the direct force between two large, fixed balls of lead and two smaller balls of lead on the ends of an arm supported by a very fine fiber, called a torsion fiber. By measuring how much the fiber gets twisted, one can measure the strength of the force, verify that it is inversely proportional to the square of the distance, and determine how strong it is. Thus, one may accurately determine the coefficient  G  in the formula"|"Six Easy Pieces"|"Richard Feynman"
"ap 04:17"|4.17|"The ratio is shown in Fig. 5-14. The gravitational attraction relative to the electrical repulsion between two electrons is 1 divided by 4.17 X 10 42 ! The question is, where does such a large number come from? It is not accidental, like the ratio of the volume of the earth to the volume of a flea. We have considered two natural aspects of the same thing, an electron. This fantastic number is a natural constant, so it involves something deep in nature. Where could such a tremendous number come from? Some say that we shall one day find the ""universal equation/' and in it, one of the roots will be this number. It is very difficult to find an equation for which such a fantastic number is a natural root. Other possibilities have been thought of; one is to relate it to the age of the universe. Clearly, we have to find  another  large number somewhere. But do we mean the age of the universe in  years?  No, because years are not ""natural""; they were devised by men. As an example of something natural, let us consider the time it takes light to go across a proton, 10 ~ 24 second. If we compare this time with the  age of the universe, 2  X 10 10  years, the answer is 10 -42 . It has about the same number of zeros going off it, so it has been proposed that the gravitational constant is related to the age of the universe. If that were the case, the gravitational constant would change with time, because as the"|"Six Easy Pieces"|"Richard Feynman"
