"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"The men assembled here at eleven o’clock just as the bell in the church across the manor grounds was sounding for morning service. Some of the men wore uniforms, but most of them had suits. They marched up and down on the paved yard of the manor, swinging left at each corner and coming to a halt when the sergeant in charge called out. He came in a small army truck which, once they had finished marching, some of the men took turns in driving round the yard, calling out and laughing, crashing the gears."|Saville|"David Storey"
00:00|midnight|"He bought plants on the way home from work and set them out in neat rows; cabbages with pale-green leaves on yellow stalks, cauliflowers and sprouts. While Colin dug back the grass on one side, turning it over and breaking it up in the earth, his father would rake out the rows, sifting the soil and drawing the stones and larger pieces away. Crouching down at the end of each row he would take out the gaily coloured packets of seed from his waistcoat pocket, tearing off a corner and tapping a few of the seeds into his hand. With his fist clenched he would waft them out on to the soil like a man shaking dice, crouching down or stooping, and covering the seeds up with the edge of his boot as soon as they were scattered. When he had reached the end of the row he would look for a stick, pierce the empty packet, and set it in the ground. In this way he planted carrots and beetroot, while peas and beans he carried in large packets in his coat, sticking his finger in the soil if it was soft and setting one bean or one pea at the bottom of each hole. Finally, when all the seeds were planted, he cut sticks out from the hedge at the end of the allotment and set them over the rows like a net, occasionally breaking off to cross over to where Colin was digging and say, ‘Here, let’s have a go: we’ll be here till midnight,’ digging in the spade and turning over the heavy sods. ‘You’d have thought they’d have ploughed it over for us, for a start. It’s like trying to dig a mountain.’"|Saville|"David Storey"
"< 00:00"|"before midnight"|"The day before the exams he and the other children who were taking them were given a new pen, a new pencil and a new ruler at school to bring home with them. In the evening Colin had gone to bed early, his mother coming up to tuck in the blankets and his father coming up before he got ready for work. ‘Think of something nice,’ he said, ‘like your holidays, and you’ll soon be asleep. An extra hour’s sleep before midnight is as good as half a dozen next morning.’ And after he had gone out his grandfather came in and said, ‘Are you asleep, lad? Spend this on ought you like,’ putting a coin in his hand. When the door had closed he put on the light and saw that it was half-a-crown."|Saville|"David Storey"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"When the day came his mother offered to go with him to the stop. It was barely seven o’clock; the streets of the village were still deserted. He stood at the door, conspicuous in his uniform, while his mother pulled on her coat."|Saville|"David Storey"
"ap 08:30"|"half-past eight"|"It was half-past eight. Other groups joined those emerging from the alley: a mass of dark-blue figures moved slowly along each pavement."|Saville|"David Storey"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"He didn’t see Connors on the way to the stop; by the time he reached the bus he found a queue had formed. He stood for the first few miles. It was six o’clock by the time he got back home; he’d been away from the house for over ten hours."|Saville|"David Storey"
"ap 05:00"|five|"Towards the end of that month his mother went away, to hospital, and in the mornings he and Steven went to Mrs Shaw’s for breakfast. His father was working mornings and got home each day in the afternoon. He was there to put Steven to bed at night but would come into Colin’s room each morning at five, whispering, laying the alarm clock beside his bed."|Saville|"David Storey"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"His father had no one else to talk to now. It would be two hours or more after his bed-time frequently before Colin went to bed; his father would follow him. ‘Now you get to sleep. I’ll put out the light. I’ll set thy alarm for seven o’clock.’"|Saville|"David Storey"
"ap 06:30"|"half-past six"|"It was always half-past six when the alarm clock went; at the last minute, as if loath to let him sleep in, he’d set it earlier. ‘Think on. As soon as it rings, get up. If Mrs Shaw sleeps in tha’ll be in trouble.’"|Saville|"David Storey"
"ap 02:30"|Two-thirty|"‘Yes,’ he said.
‘Two-thirty, Saturday.’
Colin walked over to the pavilion. Stafford, his canvas bag beneath his arm, was coming out."|Saville|"David Storey"
"ap 07:45"|"Quarter to eight"|"‘You’re up bright and early,’ the foreman said. ‘Quarter to eight, I make it.’ He took out a watch from his waistcoat pocket. ‘Got your snap, then, have you?’"|Saville|"David Storey"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"Colin sat on the sacks by the door of the shed. He drank the bottle of cold tea his mother had given him and ate the dried-egg sandwiches she’d made.
The foreman drew out his watch at one o’clock.
‘Jack. Gordon.’ He got up slowly, lifting his scythe. He’d brought a thermos which he propped up by his bike. There was a smell of straw and grease from inside the shed."|Saville|"David Storey"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"They worked till seven. It had taken them six hours of the afternoon and three hours of the morning to open up the field. He could hardly mount the bike when he got back to the sheds."|Saville|"David Storey"

‘Eight o’clock tomorrow,’ the foreman said.
‘Don’t come too early, now,’ the bow-legged man had said. He and the bony man had laughed. They stood talking by the sheds while the foreman locked the door. Finally the older of the two set off across the fields and the other rode off on his bike towards the track."|Saville|"David Storey"

"ap >> 08:00"|"well after eight"|"At each of the hills Colin got off to walk. It was well after eight when he got back home. He’d been away from the house for over thirteen hours. He leant the bike against the wall and staggered in."|Saville|"David Storey"

"ap > 05:00"|"just after five"|"‘You two can get off now. It’s just after five,’ the farmer said. ‘We’ll finish cutting tonight and start stooking first thing tomorrow morning. There’ll be too much dew to start cutting then.’"|Saville|"David Storey"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"They worked into the evening; the farmer stooked as well. At six o’clock he went to the car and got out a flask of tea. They sat in the shade of the hedge, drinking the tea from metal mugs and eating sandwiches which he’d also brought."|Saville|"David Storey"
"ap 06:00"|six|"‘This is Fritz,’ the farmer said, indicating the shorter of the two, ‘and this is Luigi,’ he added. He indicated the other man, who stooped down and shook his hand. ‘They’re prisoners of war, so if they try to escape you’ll let me know.’ The farmer laughed, the two strangely contrasted prisoners laughing with him. ‘They’ve to be back in camp, tha knows, by six, so if there’s any hanky-panky tha mu’n march ’em to the gate.’ He turned with a wink, thickening his accent. ‘They’re all right,’ he added. ‘I’ve had ’em afore: but tek no notice of the way they wuk.’"|Saville|"David Storey"

"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"He left the house at seven o’clock. A meal was being laid in the room across the hall, a smell of roast meat and vegetables coming from the kitchen. The brothers, the two men in uniform and the three women had now returned. A bottle of wine was standing on the table, while from an adjoining room across the hall, where Mr and Mrs Stafford, the brother in uniform and several of the other figures were now gathered, came the sound of a cork being drawn from a bottle, of glasses clinking, and, as Stafford followed him out to the porch, a burst of laughter was ended abruptly by his mother calling from the door."|Saville|"David Storey"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"‘Usually we get the five o’clock. Though I suppose it’s going to be crowded,’ Stafford said. ‘If you get the four o’clock it’s often empty, and you can get a compartment to yourself.’ He looked across. ‘Aren’t you coming on the train?’"|Saville|"David Storey"

‘About half-past seven to eight,’ she said.
‘I might see you there,’ he said, and turned away."|Saville|"David Storey"
"ap < 08:00"|"nearly eight o’clock"|"He tucked Steven up, read him a story, then waited while he fell asleep. It was nearly eight o’clock."|Saville|"David Storey"
"ap >> 09:00"|"long after nine"|"He set off up the road, following the bus route back towards the farm. A car came past him and roared off, leaving a cloud of dust. It was long after nine when he crested the hill above the farm. He freewheeled down the heath and cycled slowly past the gate. There was no sign of movement either in the yard or along the track: the wooden gate itself was closed."|Saville|"David Storey"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"‘I shouldn’t come to the house,’ she added. ‘I’ll meet you at the corner. Will seven o’clock, do you think, be any good?’"|Saville|"David Storey"
"ap < 10:00"|"nearly ten o’clock"|"One evening, coming back with her through the centre of the village, he met his father setting off for work. He’d already passed them in the road, cycling slowly, his father pausing in the darkness, calling, ‘Colin is that you?’ drawing his bike against the kerb, waiting for his answer, looking back towards the girl. ‘Your mother’s wondering where you’ve got to. Do you realize it’s nearly ten o’clock?’ His voice was muted, as if oppressed, like someone calling from beneath a stone."|Saville|"David Storey"
01:00|"one in the morning"|"Partly discomposed by Reagan’s appearance, and partly by the fact that none of the girls they could see in the immediate vicinity of the door were to his liking, Bletchley stood, his hands in his pockets, gazing with an aggrieved expression across the heads of the swaying dancers, turning finally to Colin and saying, ‘What a terrible lot. He really pulls in the dregs, as we might have imagined if we’d given it a little thought,’ a sweat already forming on his massive features, his thick red neck protruding in heavy rolls above his collar. As a last concession to his university identity, he’d put on a striped and crested university tie. ‘I should think most of the people here are colliers. As for the girls, I should think they’ve brought them in from the mill. Have I told you about the varsity dances? They go on sometimes till one in the morning and some of the girls don’t mind where they go on to after that.’"|Saville|"David Storey"

"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"When they went back, later in the evening, to the flat, he felt his resistance, a slow, half-hesitant rancour, rising. He’d become peculiarly brutal: it was he who was frightened, and he was frightened more by himself, he thought, than by anything outside. He had left her after midnight, when the last bus had gone, and had hitched a lift part of the way to the village in a lorry. It was two o’clock in the morning by the time he got back home."|Saville|"David Storey"

"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"His mother was completing dressing herself behind a chair. It was something that he hated: she would come down with her worn skirt and jumper, or her faded dress, and stand behind a chair to put on her stockings. It was some habit from her childhood, for she always took off her stockings in the evening, by the fire, and laid them on a chair; they were invariably in holes. It tormented him to watch her: it tormented him to ignore it. He never knew why she persisted, and she went on with it mechanically, finally flinging down the hem of her dress with an absurd gesture of propriety.
‘Your dad said it was two o’clock.’
‘So what?’ he said."|Saville|"David Storey"
"ap 05:30"|"half-past five"|"‘Because we lie awake wondering where you are. Then, if we do fall asleep, we’re woken up when you do come in. Then your dad has to get up at half-past five.’"|Saville|"David Storey"
