20:00|"eight that evening"|"He had a blind date at eight that evening, and the hot August day was a shimmer of nerves, with little breezy interludes of
            lustful dreaming. The date wasn’t totally blind—”just very short-sighted,” Catherine Fedden said, when Nick showed her the
            photograph and the letter. She seemed to like the look of the man, who was called Leo, and who she said was so much her type;
            but his handwriting made her jumpy. It was both elaborate and impetuous. Catherine had a paperback called Graphology: The Mind in the Hand, which gave her all sorts of warnings about people’s tendencies and repressions (“Artist or Madman?” “Pet or Brute?”). “It’s
            those enormous ascenders, darling,” she said: “I see a lot of ego.” They had pursed their lips again over the little square
            of cheap blue writing paper. “You’re sure that doesn’t just mean a very strong sex drive?” Nick asked. But she seemed to think
            not. He had been excited, and even rather moved, to get this letter from a stranger; but it was true the text itself raised
            few expectations. “Nick—OK! Ref your letter, am in Personnel (London Borough of Brent). We can meet up, discuss Interests
            and Ambitions. Say When. Say Where”— and then the enormous rampant L of Leo going halfway down the page."|"The Line of Beauty"|"Alan Hollinghurst"
12:00|midday|"Leo hadn’t learnt his mock-pompous tone yet. “I dare say bumshoving isn’t permitted either,” he said. The gate closed behind
            them, an oiled click, and they were together in the near-darkness of the shrubbery. Nick wanted to hold Leo and kiss him at
            once; but he wasn’t quite certain. Bumshoving was unambiguous, and encouraging, but not romantic exactly … They strolled
            cautiously forward, leaning against each other for a step or two as they steered for the path. There was the slightest chill
            in the air now, but Nick shivered wildly in a spasm of excitement. His fingers felt oddly stiff, as though he was wearing
            very tight gloves. Even in the deep shadow he wanted to conceal his weird smirk of apprehension. He did so hope it would be
            him who got to do the shoving, but didn’t know how you arranged that, perhaps it all just became clear. Perhaps they both
            had to have a go. He led Leo through on to a wide inner lawn, the bike bouncing out beside them, controlled only by a hand
            on its saddle—it seemed to quiver and explore just ahead of them. To the right rose a semicircle of old planes and a copper
            beech whose branches plunged to the ground and made a broad bell-tent that was cool and gloomy even at midday. Away to the
            left ran the gravel walk, and beyond it the tall outline of the terrace, and the long, intermitted rhythm of glowing windows.
            As they skirted the lawn Nick counted confusedly, searching for the Feddens’. He found the first-floor balcony, the proud
            brightness of the room beyond the open French windows."|"The Line of Beauty"|"Alan Hollinghurst"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"Paul smiled at him, as if at a country cousin. “My dear, don’t take it so seriously. Anyway, they’re all tarts, these boys,
            they’ve all got a price. Get Toby at two in the morning, when he’s had a bottle of brandy, and you’ll be able to do what you
            want with him. I promise you.”"|"The Line of Beauty"|"Alan Hollinghurst"
01:00|"one in the morning"|"He could hear the music in the distance, and the burble and laughter from the library, and a high ringing in his own ears.
            Up above, the hundred lilies of the electrolier glowed and twitched—there was a hesitant animation to things, all beating
            to his own pulse. He went sidling and parading through a suite of lit rooms, abandoned, amusing, a bolster or pulled-back
            curtain like a glimpse of a person in hiding. Stopped and stooped now and then to appreciate a throbbing little bronze or
            table that revolved as you looked away from it. Leant caressingly, a little heavily, on the escritoire of the dear old Marquise
            de Pompadour, which creaked—he was a lover of that sort of thing, if anyone was watching … He went into the dining room
            where they’d had lunch, found the light switches and looked very closely at the landscape by Cezanne, which pulsed as well,
            with secret geometries. Why did he talk to himself about it? The imaginary friend was at his shoulder, the only child’s devoted
            companion, needing his guidance. The composition, he said … the different greens … He had a keen idea, which he was
            cloaking and avoiding, and then licensing step by step as he opened a side door into a brown passageway, that turned a corner,
            and had other doors off it, and then came in a quickening cool draught to an open back door with the service yard beyond,
            glittering in drizzle. The glare was bright and unsentimental here. No enriching glow of candles or picture lights. Men in
            jeans were stacking and crashing things, and carried on shouting to each other as they passed Nick, so that he felt like a
            ghost whose “Thanks!” and “Sorry!” were inaudible. Tristao was washing glasses in a pantry and he walked in behind him with
            his heart suddenly thumping, smiling as if they were more than friends, and aware none the less that Tristao was working,
            it was one in the morning, and he himself was just a bow-tied drunk, a walking wrong note of hope and need."|"The Line of Beauty"|"Alan Hollinghurst"
20:00|8pm|"Tristao looked inside his packet of cigarettes, where he’d stowed Polly’s card. “That him?” he said. Nick glanced dismissively
            at the card but felt he’d been taught a lesson by it. Dr Paul Tompkins, 23 Lovelock Mansions … so established already, like a consulting room, with the boys coming through. He turned the card over, where Polly
            had scribbled Sep 4, 8pm sharp! “Why he say sharp?” said Tristao."|"The Line of Beauty"|"Alan Hollinghurst"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"“I got to go.” Tristao tugged his bow tie out of his pocket, and fiddled with the elastic and the clip. Nick waited for him
            to take his apron off. “Look, OK, I see you, by the main stairs, three o’clock.”"|"The Line of Beauty"|"Alan Hollinghurst"
"ap 03:00"|"Three o’clock"|"“Oh … OK, great!” said Nick, and found a happy relief in both the arrangement and the delay. “Three o’clock …”"|"The Line of Beauty"|"Alan Hollinghurst"
"ap 02:00"|two|"He looked in at the door of Toby’s bedroom. A group of his friends had come up here when the music stopped at two, and they
            seemed lazily to assess him. “Come in and close the door, for god’s sake,” said Toby, beckoning from the vast bed where he
            was propped up among sprawling friends. He had been given the King’s Room, where Edward VII had slept—the swags of blue silk
            above the bedhead were gathered into a vaguely comic gilded crown. On the opposite wall hung a comfortable Renoir nude. Nick
            picked his way between groups sitting on the floor in front of an enormous sofa where fat Lord Shepton was lying with his
            tie undone and his head on the thigh of an attractive drunk girl. The curtains were parted and a window open to carry the
            reek of marijuana far away from the nose of the Home Secretary. Somehow they had re-created the mood of a college room late
            at night, girls’ stockinged feet stretched out across boyfriends’ knees, smoke in the air, two or three voices dominating.
            Nick felt the charm as well as the threat of the group. Gareth Lane was holding forth about Hitler and Goebbels, and his lecturing
            drone and yapping laughs at his own puns brought back something dreary from the Oxford days. He was said to be the “ablest
            historian of his year,” but he had failed to get a first, and seemed now to be acting out some endless redemptive viva. The
            talk went on, but there felt to Nick’s tingling drunk ears to be a residual silence in the room, on which his own movements
            and words were an intrusion … and yet left no trace. Several of his other pals were here, but the two months since term
            had distanced them more than he could explain. Some simple but strong and long-prepared change had occurred, they had taken
            up their real lives, and left him alone in his. He came back and perched on the edge of the bed and Toby leaned forward and
            passed him the joint."|"The Line of Beauty"|"Alan Hollinghurst"
"ap 04:07"|4.07|"A joint came round again, and Nick took a serious pull on it. Then he got up and went to the open window, to look out at the
            damp still night. The great beeches beyond the lawn showed in grey silhouette against the first vague paling of the sky. It
            was a beautiful effect, so much bigger than the party: the world turning, the bright practical phrases of the first birds.
            Though there were hours still, surely, before sunrise … He stiffened, grabbed at his wrist, and held his watch steady
            in front of him. It was 4.07. He turned and looked at the others in the room, in their stupor and animation, and his main
            heavy thought was just how little any of them cared—they could never begin to imagine a date with a waiter, or the disaster
            of missing one. He made the first steps towards the door, and slowed and stopped as the pot took his sense of direction away.
            Where, after all, was he going? Everything seemed to have petered into a silence, as if by agreement. Nick felt conspicuous
            standing there, smiling cautiously, like someone not on to a joke; but when he looked at the others they seemed equally stilled
            and bemused. It must be some amazingly strong stuff Nick thought his way towards moving his left leg forward, he could coax
            his thought down through the knee to the foot, but it died there with no chance of becoming an action. It was slightly trying
            if he had to stand here for a long time. He looked more boldly round at the others, not easy to name at the moment, some of
            them. Slow blinks, little twitches of smiles. “Yah … ” said Nat Hanmer, very measuredly, nodding his head, agreeing with
            some statement that only he had heard. “I suppose … ” said Nick, but stopped and looked around, because that was part
            of a conversation about Gerald and the BBC. No one had noticed, though. “But you’re thinking, wasn’t that Bismarck’s whole
            point?” Gareth said."|"The Line of Beauty"|"Alan Hollinghurst"

"ap 05:45"|"five forty-five"|"At table the movement of Nick’s left arm was limited by the leaning tower of “Welcoming Jesus In Today.” He came down on his
            food in a hesitant but predatory fashion. The meal was a bold combination of bland and garishly spicy, and he wondered if
            Rosemary had mockingly overdone the chillies to make fun of his good manners. He was full of round-eyed appreciation, which
            was also a cover for the surprise of having his evening meal at five forty-five; some absurd social reflex, the useful shock
            of class difference, a childish worry perhaps at a changed routine, all combined in a mood of interesting alienation. At Kensington
            Park Gardens they ate three hours later, and dinner was sauntered towards through a sequence of other diversions, chats and
            decantings, gardening and tennis, gramophone records, whisky and gin. In the Charles household there was no room for diversions,
            no garden to speak of, and no alcohol. The meal came on straight after work, a wide-ranging grace was declaimed, and then
            it was eaten and done with, and the whole long evening lay ahead. There were things Nick guessed about them, from the habits
            of his own family, which lay somewhere between the two; but there were others he would have to wait for and learn. He had
            never been in a black household before. He saw that first love had come with a bundle of other firsts, which he took hold
            of like a wonderful but worrying bouquet."|"The Line of Beauty"|"Alan Hollinghurst"
"ap 07:15"|"seven fifteen"|"Nick had a large wild plan of his own for the night, but for now he let Leo take charge: they were going to go back to Notting
            Hill and catch the seven fifteen screening ofScarface at the Gate—it had just come out and Leo had all the facts on it, including its enormous length, 170 minutes, each one of
            which appeared to Nick like a shadowy unit of body heat, of contact and excitement. They would be pressed together in the
            warm darkness for three hours. Leo said what a great actor Al Pacino was, and spoke of him almost amorously, which Nick couldn’t
            honestly do—to him Pacino wasn’t that sort of idol. There was an interview with him in the new Time Out, which Leo had probably read, since his ideas on film seemed to Nick to be drawn pretty closely from the capsule reviews in
            that magazine. Still, film was Leo’s province, rather humourlessly patrolled against Nick’s pretensions, it was one of the
            interests he’d originally advertised, and Nick conceded, “No, he’s a genius,” which was a word he could thrill them both with.
            They stood at the bus stop with that idea in their heads."|"The Line of Beauty"|"Alan Hollinghurst"
"ap 03:00"|three|"Nick couldn’t quite have defined his own role there, and he only learned what it was when he was suddenly invited to Lowndes
            Square for Sunday lunch. He’d been dancing at Heaven till three the night before, and was still struggling with the rubber
            mask, the wobbly legs, the trill and glare of a beer and brandy hangover when Bertrand Ouradi grasped his hand very hard and
            said, “Ah, so you’re Antoine’s aesthete.”"|"The Line of Beauty"|"Alan Hollinghurst"
"ap 04:58"|"two to five"|"THE PIANO TUNER came in the morning, and then the pianist herself, little Nina Something-over as Gerald called her, came from
            two to five to practise: it was a wearing day. The tuner was a cardiganed sadist who tutted at the state of the piano and
            took a dim view in general of its tone, the tiny delay and bell-like bloom that were its special charm. (“Oh,” said Rachel,
            “I know Liszt enjoyed playing it …”) From time to time he would break off his pitiless ascent of the keyboard to dash
            out juicy chords and arpeggios, with the air of a frustrated concert pianist, which was even worse than the tuning. Little
            Nina, too, drove them mad with her fragments of Chopin and Schubert, which went on long enough to catch and lull the heart
            before they dropped it again, over and over. She had a lot of temperament and a terrifying left hand. She played the beginning
            of Chopin’s Scherzo No. 2 like a courier starting a motorbike. When she’d finished Nick helped Elena bring up and arrange
            the old gilt ballroom chairs from the trou de gloire. The sofas were trundled into new alignments, tall flower arrangements mounted the stairs on Elena’s legs, and the room took
            on an unnerving appearance of readiness. Nick had one more task to do, which was to phone Ronnie, and he eyed the clock, in

            was a strange delaying manner that would have seemed sleepy if it hadn’t been also a kind of vigilance. He never rushed, he
            was never on time, and he had a puzzled porous memory. Nick had only met him once, when they’d driven round the block in his
            red Toyota and he’d watched the simple way the exchange was made. Ronnie was a cockneyfied Jamaican, with a tall shaved head
            and doleful eyes. He talked a lot about girlfriend troubles, perhaps just to make things clear. His voice was an intimate
            murmur, and since he was giving them something they wanted he had seemed to Nick both seductive and forgivable."|"The Line of Beauty"|"Alan Hollinghurst"

            by the prospect of making speeches at at least two of these events. Rachel had stayed at home, and Penny had come up with

            or being told what it was: he had an image of its roof, like a Loire chateau. He parked opposite, outside some dark ministry.
            The whole street was oddly dark, except for the glowing glass canopies of the chateau’s doorways, somehow redolent of gaslight
            and cab horses, at one of which a porter in a peaked cap was silhouetted. For a moment a London sensation, unnoticed and perpetual
