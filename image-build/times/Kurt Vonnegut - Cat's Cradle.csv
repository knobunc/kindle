20:00|20|"When World War II broke out, Vonnegut was sixteen: at 20 he entered the army and was sent to Europe, where he was almost immediately captured by the Germans in the Battle of the Bulge. He was sent as a POW to Dresden, where on February 13, 1945 British and American bombers destroyed the city by dropping high explosives followed by incendiary bombs. The resulting firestorm turned the non-militarized city into an inferno that killed up to 60,000 civilians. Vonnegut and his fellow POWs survived by accident only because they were housed some sixty feet underground in a former meat locker and slaughterhouse. Vonnegut’s job for weeks after the bombing was to gather up and burn the remains of the dead. His experience at Dresden marked him for life and eventually resulted in his literary masterpiece, Slaughterhouse-Five. Yet another sorrow of the war years was the suicide by drug overdose in 1944 of Vonnegut’s mother."|"Cat's Cradle"|"Kurt Vonnegut"
