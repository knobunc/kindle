00:00|midnight|"Above them now the clouds have vanished. A blue velvet sky is further softened by a large yellow moon, whose light casts their long shadows upon the rushing meadowlands below, while the horizon shows a glint of the midnight sea and is filled with the emerald points of stars, and only as he begins to recognize the landscape below him does Elric know fear."|"Elric Swords and Roses"|"Michael Moorcock"
"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"“—for instance, I look up at about noon. Silver light pours like water down the massed clouds, themselves vast floating asymmetric sea-beasts so large they are host to whole nations of other species, including, surely, Man? As if they entirely surfaced from their element, ready to plunge again into depths as mysterious to those below as oceans are to those above them.” His face glowed a richer red with all this bright recollection, his eyes appeared to focus again upon those clouds, upon those monumental natural barges, like raised wrecks, alarmingly complete after millennia, alien beyond imagining, beyond any impulse of ordinary mortals to follow, which one’s very soul yearned to forget, those obscenely ancient beast-ships grown insubstantial in their sudden element, this brilliancy of sun and sky, and gradually their outlines dim, turn grey and fade one into another until only the sun and the sky remain, witnesses of their unmourned passing. “Have they grown invisible or are they gone for ever, even from our blood’s strange memory, that tiny speck of ancestral matter that informs our race’s united soul? Would that be to say they never existed and never could exist? Many things existed before our ancestors ever lifted one webbed foot upon a steamy shore …”"|"Elric Swords and Roses"|"Michael Moorcock"
12:00|noon|"Slowly now the black-and-yellow ship moved through the tugging currents of the reef—a few inches this way, a few that, sometimes touching a rock so lightly there was the barest whisper of friction, sometimes seeming to squeeze between pillars of basalt and obsidian, while the wind yelled and the surf crashed and the whole world seemed once more to be given up to Chaos. It was noon before they had negotiated the first line of reefs and lay at anchor in the calm waters between themselves and the second line. Now the navigator gave instructions for the crew to eat well and to rest. They would not attempt the next line until the following day."|"Elric Swords and Roses"|"Michael Moorcock"
12:00|noon|"So the three of them—tall figures, lean as winter weasels—began their journey eastward, up the steep slopes of the valley, through frozen foothills, to a range of ancient mountains, whose rotting granite threatened to collapse with every foot they set upon it, while the snow came thicker now and they must break ice to get their water, save at noon, when the thin sun warmed the world enough to make it run; wide ribbons of silver racing through the glittering white shards."|"Elric Swords and Roses"|"Michael Moorcock"
12:00|"noon that next day"|"“It was on the night of the full moon that I saw her take out the folded wolfskin and drape it around her shoulders, saw her drop to all fours and in a bewildering instant stand, growling faintly at the children to stay close to the fire, looking out into the night, an enormous wolf. Yet still she did not see me, did not scent me. I was invisible to her supernatural senses. She moved off towards the mountains and was back at noon that next day with a kill, some nomad boy, probably a herder, and two lambs, which she had dragged, using the boy’s body as a kind of sledge. The human remains she left for herself, but assumed her woman form once she had brought the lambs into camp. These she prepared for her children. Later that evening, as they ate the rich-smelling stew she had cooked, she returned to her human kill and devoured a good deal of him, almost certainly in wolf shape. I was too cautious to get closer to her."|"Elric Swords and Roses"|"Michael Moorcock"
12:00|noon|"The endless dunes of the Sahara at noon. We hear hoofbeats before we see mounted Arabs, swathed in flowing black robes, their faces hidden save for the occasional glitter of dark eyes, suddenly reining in their magnificently caparisoned horses. They stare in wonder at the sky. These Arabs are not armed—there is not a sword, dagger or rifle amongst them. The Arab leader is distinguished by a scarlet headband. The Arabs stare in silence but we hear a hint of sound, a faint rushing and fluttering from the sky which comes from—"|"Elric Swords and Roses"|"Michael Moorcock"
12:00|noon|"MELIADUS: “Here, Lord Urlik, we’ll begin your education at once. By morning we’ll be at sea—and by noon we’ll have sighted Paphanal …”"|"Elric Swords and Roses"|"Michael Moorcock"
12:00|noonday|"“Oh, ’tis best you ask no more questions concerning this sword, your highness.” He pretended further interest in the boat’s equipment. On both distant banks of the river, under the blaze of the noonday sun, the dark jungle moved slowly by. “Indeed, it is in none of our interests for me to release this sword.”"|"Elric Swords and Roses"|"Michael Moorcock"
12:00|noon|"Dawn came again and they rowed on upstream. By noon the sun was a throbbing, glaring eye gazing pitilessly down on them as they sweated to force their course on a river grown increasingly difficult to navigate, whose bends twisted and snaked, narrowing then widening unpredictably at every turn. Dyvim Mar warned them not to drag their hands in water now seething with poisonous reptiles and giant cephalopods. “And all are hungry for our flesh, or blood, or both.” As he spoke, to illustrate his warning, a great coiling serpent leapt from the water to snap at a bird skimming the surface in pursuit of a giant dragonfly."|"Elric Swords and Roses"|"Michael Moorcock"
00:00|midnight|"“The noibuluscus must be plucked at the optimum moment. We must wait until the moon is full. It’s not even twilight. We must somehow hold out against the savages until midnight.” He had waited so many months, he could feel the last of his strength ebbing out of him. He thought only of his own needs."|"Elric Swords and Roses"|"Michael Moorcock"
00:00|midnight|"He managed to respond, his smile ironic, panting. “Madam, you must try to wait until midnight before you condemn me entirely …”"|"Elric Swords and Roses"|"Michael Moorcock"
