It said that the weather for the next day would be normal. I was appeased that the weather would be normal. It would make our search cinchier. After the vodka, we went up to our room, which flanked the room of the hero. ""I will repose on the bed, and you will repose on the floor,"" Grandfather said. ""Of course,"" I said. ""I will make my alarm for six in the morning."" ""Six?"" I inquired. If you want to know why I inquired, it is because six is not very early in the morning for me, it is tardy in the night. ""Six,"" he said, and I knew that it was the end of the conversation."|"Everything Is Illuminated"|"Jonathan Safran Foer"
"ap 05:00"|five-o'clock|"Yankel was already seventy-two years old when the wagon went into the river, his house more ready for a funeral than a birth. Brod read under the muted canary light of oil lamps covered with lace shawls, and bathed in a tub lined with sandpaper to prevent slipping. He tutored her in literature and simple mathematics until she had far surpassed his knowledge, laughed with her even when there was nothing funny, read to her before watching her fall asleep, and was the only person she could consider a friend. She acquired his uneven walk, spoke with his old man's inflections, even rubbed at a five-o'clock shadow that was never, at any time of any day of her life, there."|"Everything Is Illuminated"|"Jonathan Safran Foer"

""Go get the Jew,"" Grandfather said. ""I will loiter downstairs."" ""Breakfast?"" I asked. ""Oh,"" he said. ""Let us descend to the restaurant and eat breakfast. Then you will get the Jew."" ""What about his breakfast?"" ""They will not have anything without meat, so we should not make him an uncomfortable person."" ""You are smart,"" I told him."|"Everything Is Illuminated"|"Jonathan Safran Foer"
"ap 06:30"|6:30|"""Listen,"" he said, ""what do you say we have a little breakfast?"" ""What?"" ""Breakfast,"" he said, putting his hands on his stomach. ""No,"" I said, ""I think it is superior if we commence the search. We want to search as much as possible while light still exists."" ""But it's only 6:30."" ""Yes, but it will not be 6:30 forever. Look,"" I said, and pointed to my watch, which is a Rolex from Bulgaria, ""it is already 6:31. We are misplacing time."" ""Maybe a little something?"" he said. ""What?"" ""Just a cracker. I'm really hungry."" ""This cannot be negotiated. I think it is best—"" ""We have a minute or two. What's that on your breath?"" ""You will have one mochaccino in the restaurant downstairs, and that will be the end of the conversation. You must try to pull a fast one.""

""It is beautiful, yes?"" I said to the hero. ""What?"" ""The day. It is a beautiful day."" He put down the glass of his window, which was acceptable because Sammy Davis, Junior, Junior was sleeping, and he put his head outside of the car. ""Yes,"" he said. ""It's absolutely beautiful."" This made me proud, and I told Grandfather, and he smiled, and I could perceive that he also became a very proud person. ""Inform him about Odessa,"" Grandfather said. ""Inform him how beautiful it is there."" ""In Odessa,"" I rotated to the hero and said, ""it is more beautiful than even this. You have never witnessed a thing similar to it."" ""I'd like to hear about it,"" he said, and opened his diary. ""He wants to hear about Odessa,"" I told Grandfather, because I wanted for him to like the hero. ""Inform him that the sand on the beaches is more soft than a woman's hairs, and that the water is like the inside of a woman's mouth."" ""The sand on the beaches is like a woman's mouth."" ""Inform him,"" Grandfather said, ""that Odessa is the most wonderful place to become in love, and also to make a family."" So I informed the hero. ""Odessa,"" I said, ""is the most wonderful place to become in love, and also to make a family."" ""Have you ever fallen in love?"" he inquired me, which seemed like such a queer inquiry, so I returned it to him. ""Have you?"" ""I don't know,"" he said. ""Nor I,"" I said. ""I've been close to love."" ""Yes."" ""Really close, like almost there."" ""Almost."" ""But never, I don't think."" ""No."" ""Maybe I should go to Odessa,"" he said. ""I could fall in love. It sounds like that would make more sense than Trachimbrod."" We both laughed. ""What is he saying?"" Grandfather inquired. I told him, and he also laughed. All of this felt so wonderful. ""Show me the map,"" Grandfather said. He examined it while he drove, making his blindness even less trustworthy, I must confess."|"Everything Is Illuminated"|"Jonathan Safran Foer"

"ap 10:00"|ten|"Not long after their exile to the rooftops, the Wisps of Ardisht realized that they would soon run out of matches to light their beloved cigarettes. They kept a chalk-line count on the side of the tallest chimney. Five hundred. The next day three hundred. The next day one hundred. They rationed them, burned them down to the striker's fingers, trying to light at least thirty cigarettes with each. When they were down to twenty matches, lighting became a ceremony. By ten, the women were crying. Nine. Eight. The clan leader dropped the seventh off the roof by accident, and proceeded to throw his own body after it in shame. Six. Five. It was inevitable. The fourth match was blown out by a breeze—a gross oversight by the new clan leader, who also plunged to his death, although his nosedive was not of his own choosing. Three: We will die without them. Two: It's too painful to go on. And then, in the moment of deepest desperation, a grand idea emerged, devised by a child, no less: simply make sure that there is always someone smoking. Each cigarette can be lit from the previous one. As long as there is a lit cigarette, there is the promise of another. The glowing ash end is the seed of continuity! Schedules were drawn up: dawn duty, morning smoke, lunchtime puffer, midafternoon and late-afternoon assignments, crepuscular puller, lonely midnight sentinel. The sky was always lit with at least one cigarette, the candle of hope."|"Everything Is Illuminated"|"Jonathan Safran Foer"

Babies were brought before him—always at noon when he cast no shadow at all—to be protected from lightning, the evil eye, and stray partisan fire. The old folks told him their secrets, hoping he might be amused, take pity on them, grant a few more years. Unmarried women kissed his lips, praying for love, so many kisses that the lips became indented, became negative kisses, and also had to be rebronzed. So many visitors came to rub and kiss different parts of him for the fulfillment of their various wishes that his entire body had to be rebronzed every month. He was a changing god, destroyed and recreated by his believers, destroyed and recreated by their belief."|"Everything Is Illuminated"|"Jonathan Safran Foer"
"ap ~ 04:00"|"approximately four o'clock"|"We walked out and closed the door behind us. I yearned to be on the other side of the door, the side on which such momentous truths were being uttered. Or I yearned to press my ear to the door so that I could at minimum hear. But I knew that my side was on the outside with the hero. Part of me hated this, and part of me was grateful, because once you hear something, you can never return to the time before you heard it. ""We can remove the skin from the corn for her,"" I said, and the hero harmonized. It was approximately four o'clock of the afternoon, and the temperature was commencing to become cold. The wind was making the first noises of night."|"Everything Is Illuminated"|"Jonathan Safran Foer"

""He must be present at the train by 19:00 of the evening, yes?"" ""Yes,"" I said, ""so we will desire to depart the hotel at lunch, to be on the side of safety."" ""Perhaps we will have time for more searching."" ""I am not so certain,"" I said. ""And where would we search? There is nothing. There is no one to inquire. You remember what she said."" The hero was not giving any attention to us, and never asked even one time what we were conversing about. He was being sociable only with the peanuts. ""This would be more easy without him,"" Grandfather said, moving his eyes at the hero. ""But it is his search,"" I said. ""Why?"" ""Because it is his grandfather."" ""We are not looking for his grandfather. We are looking for Augustine. She is not any more his than ours."" I had not thought of it in this way, but it was true. ""What are you talking about?"" Jonathan asked me. ""And could you ask the waitress for some more of these peanuts?"""|"Everything Is Illuminated"|"Jonathan Safran Foer"
"ap 07:00"|7:00|"I told the waitress to retrieve us more peanuts, and she said, ""I will do this, even though the owner commands that no one should ever receive more than one bowl of peanuts.

""I have to be at the train at 7:00, right?"" ""Correct."" ""What will we do until then?"" ""I am not a certain person. We must depart very early, because you must be at the train station two hours before your train goes forth, and it is a three-hour drive, and it is likely that we will become lost people."" ""It sounds like we should leave now,"" he said,

It would be nine months—on Trachimday, no less—before the shtetl was the focus of direct Nazi assault. But the Brod's waters roiled onto its banks that night with the same fervor as if it had been war, the wind snapped in the explosive wake with the same resonance, and the shtetl folk trembled as if the sites were tattooed on their bodies. From that moment on—9:28 in the evening, June 18, 1941—everything was different."|"Everything Is Illuminated"|"Jonathan Safran Foer"
