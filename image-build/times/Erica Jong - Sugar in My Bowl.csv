"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"The needle was so fine she barely felt it go in. Ten minutes later, she was out into the sunlight with a Band-Aid on the side of her breast. After fighting traffic on the Schuylkill for forty-five minutes, she arrived home to a sink full of dishes and two screaming, overtired boys, a sitter (a little rat-faced girl who Lizzie just bet would be pregnant before she finished high school) demanding eighty dollars, and a husband who rolled in at eight o’clock (after the baths, after the stories, after twenty minutes of nursing and two diaper changes), cast a cool eye over the cluttered counters and the floor dotted with rotini and peas, and said, “No dinner, huh?” and didn’t even ask how her appointment had gone."|"Sugar in My Bowl"|"Erica Jong"
06:00|"six in the morning"|"Three days later, at six in the morning, she rolled over, and announced, “I’m going shopping.” Beside her in bed, Cal merely nodded. Her husband, normally so tanned, rosy-cheeked, and cheery, looked pale and shell-shocked, his face slack and jowly, his eyes wet and wounded, as if, she thought meanly, cancer was something she’d gotten just to upset him."|"Sugar in My Bowl"|"Erica Jong"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"At three in the morning, when one or the other of the twins usually woke up, she pulled the crisp white cover up to his chin, and bent to deposit a gentle kiss between his shoulder blades."|"Sugar in My Bowl"|"Erica Jong"
"ap 06:00"|six|"At six, he woke up, drew her against him. Oh, baby, he groaned, his mouth hot against her breast where, until that morning, the bandage had been, and she felt her throat close. I should tell you, she started to say. Tell me what? he asked, and she shook her head, swallowing the words I’m sick, I’m having an operation, I won’t have breasts at all next week. Instead, she pressed her lips against his and straddled him, slipping him inside of her and riding him, with her breasts dangling over his lips like ripe fruit, like the grapes Tantalus could never quite reach."|"Sugar in My Bowl"|"Erica Jong"
03:00|"3 A.M."|"I woke up with a start; I had to pee. Had it been hours or minutes? The streetlight poured in through Stan’s bamboo blinds. I could see a blue clock in the corner that Ambrose had donated to our new branch organizer’s furnishings. 3 A.M. It’d been twelve hours since we were in the parking lot."|"Sugar in My Bowl"|"Erica Jong"
09:00|"9 A.M."|"No longer being able to fuck around felt weird, like an infringement on my personal bill of rights. But, on the other hand, I was as jealous of him as he was of me. Later, when he was deployed to Germany for three years, my sister Anne—privy to my previous life—was amazed that I was faithful to him. She didn’t know that he called me every Saturday morning at 9 A.M., undoubtedly thinking there was no way I was going to talk to him with another man in the room."|"Sugar in My Bowl"|"Erica Jong"
20:09|2009|"“Sex and death are the only two things worth writing about,” wrote the great poet William Butler Yeats. And when I was asked to write this essay, I was immersed in the latter. It was 2009, and my adult son, David, had just died at my home after a ten-month illness during which I had held my breath, praying every day for his healing, but also knowing it wasn’t likely to happen. As I held him in my arms just after his breath expired, I placed my hands in his still-warm armpits, seeking to will him back to life, and embracing him in a way he, as an adult man, wouldn’t have permitted. My most recent writing had been the memorial letter I had sent to friends everywhere."|"Sugar in My Bowl"|"Erica Jong"
20:00|"eight at night"|"Also, there’s what we both accept as fact: to lead the simple, peaceful life he now leads—so different from his years as a paratrooper, then over-the-road trucker, outdoing himself physically every day of his life, he’s had to change, giving up the rage that had fueled him for so long. He now takes Wellbutrin for depression, Depakote and lithium for bipolar, other pills for high blood pressure and for high cholesterol—sixteen each morning and eight at night. Over the past few years, he’s lost his father, his mother, and his brother, so there’s nobody left but me and my two daughters."|"Sugar in My Bowl"|"Erica Jong"
"ap 06:00"|six|"Callie’s always run around naked and carefree like a wood nymph. At six, she’s in love with herself in a way she never will be again. She doesn’t have long before she starts comparing herself to other girls, before she wants to wear a bra instead of nothing at all. I’d like her to stay naked and carefree as long as possible."|"Sugar in My Bowl"|"Erica Jong"
17:45|"5:45 P.M."|"And so—every Wednesday at 5:45 P.M.—Ida has an appointment with the doctor at his consulting rooms. She wears exotic underwear and he opens up his drawer of toys. He has introduced her to slipper spanking, ostrich feather ticklers, and some light whipping. He courteously ensures that she comes at least once before he goes for his own climax. They talk a little before and after, but not much. The point is to fuck, not to make friends."|"Sugar in My Bowl"|"Erica Jong"
"ap 08:13"|8h13|"Back in New York, divorced and working in television, Miss Honeypot met them all. There were the men who flattered, chased, pursued, begged, threatened, abused, drank, drugged, and sometimes even made it past passable. There was the anchor who used toys, the Greek who used drugs, and the producer who used the 8h13 back to Scarsdale to excuse his premature ejaculation. Another husband followed, a man whose face she couldn’t quite place years after the divorce when they crossed paths at an airport."|"Sugar in My Bowl"|"Erica Jong"
03:00|"3:00 A.M."|"But now, six months after my wedding, up at 3:00 A.M. nursing Ivy, I was starting to obsess about that hotel. A place like that could be just what Henry and I needed, a change of scene and some real romance. How could you not have great sex at a place like that? I got up and went to my desk, digging out the brochure. My mouth dropped open as I looked at the glossy photos, fantasizing about the clean towels, the room service, and the giant TV. The resort seemed to offer everything I craved. I was breast-feeding 24/7, why not do it with an ocean view? When Henry woke up the next day, I told him I wanted to go as soon as possible, convincing him it would be good for us."|"Sugar in My Bowl"|"Erica Jong"
