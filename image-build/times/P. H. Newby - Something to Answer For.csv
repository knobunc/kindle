Elie had his funeral. But first of all I have to tell you that Madame was intercepted by the Israeli navy! They made her open the coffin. Can you imagine it? The deep, rolling, blue water all around them, a Jew gunboat, and this mad old English woman with the skin peeling off her nose. You can see the coffin with the lid off and Elie’s face and crossed hands in the midday sun. The Jews took their hats off while Madame swore at them. They all bobbed up and down. There was a dolphin. They even asked her how she knew her course. She had the salt dried on her face and hands, so much white powder. Her father was a sailor. By night she kept the North Star well on her port. By day she’d recognise any landfall. She’d know Carmel. Beyond that Naqura. The truth is, the set of the wind this time of year you wouldn’t go far wrong if you just sailed with it. There’s a dolphin I know, goes that way too in the middle of June. He may have had something to do with it. Thirty miles out at sea you can see snow on Lebanon. She came back by air. I asked her what she did with the boat. She said she’d burned it on the shore.”"|"Something to Answer For"|"P. H. Newby"

He paid more attention to the car and what was going on in the immediate neighbourhood than he did to the woman. So far as he could tell it was just an ordinary car. It was a couple of years old, perhaps, and it looked as though it had not been cherished. There were dents. The front bumper was tied up at one end with string. She was parked immediately opposite Simon Artz’s store and nothing in any way remarkable seemed to be going on. A Chrysler was parked outside the cable office. A long way down to the left cars were queueing for the ferry. A small group of what, judging by their little hats and wide shoulders, might be German tourists with a ship’s officer in attendance were away up towards the front looking at the Anzac memorial. It was only ten o’clock but the sun had a bite.

"<< 12:00"|"Well before noon"|"Townrow looked up and saw there was a third man in the cell. He was a major in the Egyptian army, sitting at a table with an open notebook in front of him. He nodded and smiled at Townrow and began writing with a huge fountain pen. Well before noon they had forced Townrow to admit the British had bombed the military airstrips and hangars outside Cairo (they brought in a radio and let him hear the B.B.C. on short wave) and this meant the British and French would be landing any day now. Townrow saw he had been dead wrong about practically everything but the more he confessed the less the Egyptians believed him. They thought he was just pretending to be a crook in order to convince them he wasn’t a spy. He couldn’t make them understand he had been turned inside out. He was obsessed with Leah. He thought about her all the time, even as he lay on the bed talking to these two Egyptians. This was all part of the reversal. No, not that stuff about being redeemed by the love of a good woman. She happened to be the one good he could think of. If there had been any redemption it had been brought about by the shock of disillusionment; if the ordinary man did not instinctively understand the acts of his government and, indeed, found them bestial he could only respond by taking himself in hand. He must tell the truth. He must be honest. That was the logic of it. Otherwise he lost the right to criticise. Townrow rocked from side to side. These bloody Egyptians couldn’t understand the agony he was going through. He just wanted to go on being a bastard, the way he’d always been since they slung him out of college, but, for Christ’s sake, how could he if Eden was one too?"|"Something to Answer For"|"P. H.

In a vague sort of way he had threatened her and she was frightened. She was always frightened of Cypriots. Nevertheless she was going to this same spot that very evening and in case anything happened to her she wanted Townrow to know about Christou’s threat. That was the man’s name. He was a certain John Christou who ran the Cyprus Bar and Townrow remembered him from way back, when he was here with the army. He had been in his bar once or twice this trip, too. Come to think of it, he had been in there with Mrs K herself."|"Something to Answer For"|"P. H. Newby"
12:00|noon|"He wore this same grey linen suit for the first time. It had been tailored while he had been shut up in that bedroom with nothing much to do but read, make passes at Leah and get himself measured for suits. He was not complaining. After all the days were cooler. It was October and he could sit on the balcony wearing nothing but a pair of drawers in the noon sun. He was brown in places he’d never been brown before.

It was absurd. The occasional table with cherubs had cost Elie fifty guineas in Wigmore Street and the grand total, the chairs, that big picture of a cock and hens, would be nearer a thousand.

He held her tight in his arms but the long glide into a mindlessness where no clocks struck was so unmistakable he felt himself going too. She was going to wherever she had disappeared to that morning at the Greek Club when he had searched in those showers and walked about the garden and ended up drinking with that mat-chested trio. They swore she didn’t exist. Maybe she didn’t, just at that moment. She had expunged herself. She was doing it again and this time she was expunging him as well. He came to want being expunged.

Planes had been over earlier and there had been sound of bombs falling perhaps twenty or thirty miles away. No ack-ack. The barred window was so high they could not see the night sky.

Military policemen walked about shouting. From the air it must have looked like a fairground: unshaded lights burned, a bell clanged, and a mad, sighing snarl came from a loaded camel being led between the tracks. Townrow was watching his chance to make a bolt for it. The first thing he did on being pushed into an empty first class compartment was to hop to the opposite door and try the handle. It was locked. He wondered whether Amin, who had a great pistol on his thigh, would have tried a pot shot. Probably, and missed.

They were so black there might have been annihilation behind what they covered. The city hung in strips and patches. That was how he saw his own life. The clearest strip was the moving picture of his father stepping out of the car, climbing the wall, and setting off across the field to the trees. And that girl, she was seventeen, saying, “I’ve got news for you, boy,” and laughing as though pregnancy was a joke, the foetus actually tickled. He tried to fix his mind on what his life had been. Ma talking on and on about Dublin and the Post Office and his saying, “Why did Uncle Rob hit Dad with a big stick?” Well, what else could an Irishman do when his sister married an English soldier? Photographs taken through some great astronomical telescope revealed gaps in the universe like the gaps he studied in the structure of Port Said, 11.25 hours, November 6; and the gaps in his mind.

They seemed to release their rockets dead overhead to go screaming away south. Somebody might take it into his head to blow up the ferry in which case the Greek Sailing Club would probably stop a few rockets. Townrow turned this possibility over but he continued down the path. He came to a pergola with loofahs hanging down, some of them dead ripe and ready for the bath. Now, that pergola really was something he had forgotten. On the other side of the banana leaves there was a clicking noise. He paused. Perhaps some sort of weapon was being set up. Or it might have been rifle fire from a long way off.
