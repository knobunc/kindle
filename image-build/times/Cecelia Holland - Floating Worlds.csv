22:00|"ten in the evening"|"Bunker was coming in on the underground train; at ten in the evening she went to meet him. He came across the platform toward her, putting on his sweater. “I thought it never got cold here.” Paula turned to walk beside him. They climbed the stairs to the ground level. She handed him an envelope."|"Floating Worlds"|"Cecelia Holland"
00:00|midnight|"Paula took the midnight train to New York. Walking up the aisle of the car, she saw Bunker sitting next to the window on a forward bench. After a moment she put her bag on the rack over his head and sat down opposite him. He had a book plug in his ear; he ignored her. She stretched her legs out before her. The train was almost empty. The lights flashed on and off, and the bench under her jerked forward. She braced herself. The train bounded forward, stopped cold, and started up again. They rolled off into the dark."|"Floating Worlds"|"Cecelia Holland"

"ap 05:00"|"Five o’clock"|"“You’re damned right it wouldn’t. I’m going. You come up to my place tomorrow. Five o’clock. What do I call you?”"|"Floating Worlds"|"Cecelia Holland"
"ap 04:30"|four-thirty|"“Gone.” Paula glanced at the clock. It was four-thirty. “What do you mean?”"|"Floating Worlds"|"Cecelia Holland"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"He was bent over the desk doing the anagram in the ten o’clock hourly. He did not look up. “Did it involve a Styth?”"|"Floating Worlds"|"Cecelia Holland"
">> 12:00"|"well after noon"|"She went with him out to the park. She had gotten up well after noon, and the sun was falling toward the horizon, the domelight was coming on. He stayed in the cool and shade of the great deodar trees that lined the golf course. The ground was deep in spongy grass, even where the trees’ cloaking branches kept the light out all day long. Paula lagged behind him. On the far side of the path he stopped to let her catch up. Two Martians in knee-length pants, a man and a woman, were coming toward her. Another man in the hotel’s livery pulled a cart full of golf clubs after them. She paused to let them pass."|"Floating Worlds"|"Cecelia Holland"
"ap 01:00"|one|"The Styths were moving. Sril went across the restaurant, through the scattered tables, and the others spread out between him and the Akellar like a cordon. The young man on the chair followed them with his gun, pointing it now at one and now at another. He was too frightened to shoot."|"Floating Worlds"|"Cecelia Holland"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"“You come down to my place at seven and have dinner with me and we’ll talk about the fine points. There’s somebody you have to meet.” He stepped wide past Sril and out the door."|"Floating Worlds"|"Cecelia Holland"
01:35|"135 hours"|"Paula rubbed her face. She was tired. The trip from Mars had taken 135 hours. She was space-sick and she could not eat. Bunker tapped her arm. She went after him and Jefferson down a step to the middle track and onto the slow track and to the motionless floor. The officer took them down ten levels in a vertical car."|"Floating Worlds"|"Cecelia Holland"
00:00|midnight|"A thick dark stream wound along the holograph. The ship bucked down, lurched to the left as if she were sliding down a wave, and heaved herself straight again. The suit was rigid. Paula could move her fingers inside the fat gloves but the gloves were immovable. The light was fading. They passed into a deep dusk, into a midnight darkness. The pressure suit had hardened like a shell around her. She looked up overhead. The darkness was complete. Suddenly a fragment of coherent light appeared, a long streak that melted away while she watched."|"Floating Worlds"|"Cecelia Holland"
"ap 03:04"|Three-four|"“One-two,” Tanuojin said. “One-two. You’re going too fast. Three-four. Three-four.”"|"Floating Worlds"|"Cecelia Holland"
"ap 01:04"|One-four|"“One-four,” Tanuojin read. “Three-sixteen. Saba, you could fly a piece of silk. One-eight, one-eight.”"|"Floating Worlds"|"Cecelia Holland"

"ap 03:00"|three|"At three bells she went after him down the winding tunnel to the bridge. The rest of his watch was gathered around the hatch. Saba pushed the hatch open, and she followed him into the hollow bridge."|"Floating Worlds"|"Cecelia Holland"
"ap ~ 00:30"|"About thirty minutes to one"|"Tanuojin said, “What’s the watch?”
“About thirty minutes to one bell.”
They went through Saba’s office, across the narrow filing room, and into the little sleeping room. There was a crystal lamp burning and the place was relatively warm. She took off her coat."|"Floating Worlds"|"Cecelia Holland"
"ap > 01:00"|"Just after one"|"“Go ask Illy what she will drink,” Paula said to the slave. Saba was picking up a handful of cakes. Just after one bell he had come back from six hundred watches in Ybix; he had spent the whole low watch in bed with Illy. Boltiko caught Paula’s eye. Her small mouth was clamped shut, as if she bit on something foul. The slave poured whiskey for Saba and Paula and kakine for Boltiko."|"Floating Worlds"|"Cecelia Holland"
"ap > 02:00"|"After two"|"Saba gave David a robot that talked in pidgin Styth when it was wound up. After two watches of its screechy little voice Paula broke off the key. None of the women was talking to any of the others. Saba noticed it and made several remarks to Paula he obviously thought were the fine edge of wit. Everything he said convinced her that he knew about her and Illy. Whenever Paula was in sight, Illy hung on him. Paula could barely eat. Finally he went down to Yekka, and she went limp with relief, and the next watch woke up with a piercing pain in her belly."|"Floating Worlds"|"Cecelia Holland"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"A young man with an intense bushy mustache answered Jefferson’s extension. “Look, it’s two o’clock.”"|"Floating Worlds"|"Cecelia Holland"
14:00|"fourteen o’clock"|"“Your prerogative, Mr. Parine.” The little judge banged on the table. “I’ll break for lunch. Until fourteen o’clock. Don’t bother to sit, Tanuojin.” He walked out the little door in the wall behind his table."|"Floating Worlds"|"Cecelia Holland"
"< 02:40"|"nearly 240 hours"|"“I have evidence,” Wu-wei said. “I’m not blind, and I’m not incapable of reasoning, or I wouldn’t be here in the first place. The Ybix incident was part of a whole field. This trial has been another aspect of the same field. This isn’t the place to comment on people who aggravate the natural tensions between races and individuals for their personal ends, however grandiose, and I won’t do that. The Ybix incident was a practical exercise. General Gordon made a misjudgment, to which he was helped by a variety of people not even on trial here and for which he has suffered. Certainly neither of the two ships destroyed at Luna would have been shot down if not for Ybix’s presence, but Ybix had been there for nearly 240 hours without a problem, and therefore I conclude that without General Gordon’s miscalculation, the incident would not have occurred. I am holding Ybix responsible for one ship and General Gordon for the other. The eight men who died in the ships cannot be brought to life again by any piety or wit in this courtroom. They were soldiers and carried guns, and men who use force must accept it will be used against them. As for the rest of the charges, Mr. Parine of Mars ought to remember when he makes up cases that simple is best. Since Luna brought the case here and then withdrew it, Luna will pay the court charges.” He tapped his fingers on the tabletop. “As for Ybix, the trial ought to be punishment enough. Are there comments?”"|"Floating Worlds"|"Cecelia Holland"
"ap 01:00"|one|"The mob swelled larger through the watch, packing the street and crowding through the arches of the arcade. Fights broke out here and there. At one bell, Leno came down from the House, his bullet head set forward on his shoulders. The man who had shot Saba had confessed: he was an agent of the Sunlight League. Leno went away, but the mob stayed. Their noise kept Paula awake. She sat at the front desk while Ketac slept in the chair before the window and Sril and Bakan walked aimlessly around the office."|"Floating Worlds"|"Cecelia Holland"
"ap > 01:00"|"Just after one"|"She and Saba lived in the same cabin. She slept during the high watch and he slept during the low watch. Just after one bell, while he was getting undressed and she was dressing, she said, “What kind of a sailor is Kasuk?”"|"Floating Worlds"|"Cecelia Holland"
"ap 02:30"|two-thirty|"Michalski came in again, saying, “Jefferson, two-thirty.” He popped out without pausing. Paula stood, picking up her jacket."|"Floating Worlds"|"Cecelia Holland"
"ap 03:00"|three|"“Thanks.” Paula took it. The white band around the plug was marked with numbers. “I’ll see you in half an hour.” The afternoon meeting started at three."|"Floating Worlds"|"Cecelia Holland"
11:50|"ten minutes to noon"|"The time meter on the wall read ten minutes to noon. At four they were due in New York again. Stacks of bound hourlies cluttered the floor. She sat up and rested her feet on a bundle. In her ear the plug played back the maddening small talk of the trip from New York to New Haven. Maybe she should wire Tanuojin. Plant a homing device on him in case he went somewhere else. That was desperate. She wondered what they would do when they found out she was spying on them."|"Floating Worlds"|"Cecelia Holland"

18:00|"six in the evening"|"At six in the evening by the clock, most of the lighting in Luna dimmed out, signaling the beginning of the artificial night. Newrose and his staff were quartered on the fourteenth floor, where Paula also lived. She took a current book of codes and went down the empty corridor to Newrose’s suite. She knocked on the door, and Newrose himself opened it."|"Floating Worlds"|"Cecelia Holland"
00:00|midnight|"David left her as soon as they entered the long room. The air was freezing. Along the illusion wall the ocean streamed midnight blue up to the thin white curl of surf. Against that background the Styths moved in silhouette. She crossed the room toward the tall stocky shape standing against the ocean."|"Floating Worlds"|"Cecelia Holland"
"ap < 01:00"|"Just before one"|"Just before one bell, she went down to her room. Saba lay on her bed with his head turned away. She walked to the side of the bed. His face was smooth, without any sign of pain. She put her hand on his forehead. He was dead. He had been dead for hours."|"Floating Worlds"|"Cecelia Holland"
