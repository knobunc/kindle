"ap 05:30"|"Half past five"|"“What time is it?”
“Half past five.”
I have always got up early, especially after my years in the sanatorium, where, in summer, they used to bring us the thermometer at six in the morning."|"The Train"|"Georges Simenon"

02:00|"two o’clock in the morning"|"She tried to drop off to sleep, but often it was two o’clock in the morning before she succeeded and afterward it was not uncommon for her to sit up with a cry."|"The Train"|"Georges Simenon"
"ap ~ 07:00"|"about seven o’clock"|"Recently she had been getting up about seven o’clock and coming downstairs after that to make breakfast."|"The Train"|"Georges Simenon"
01:00|"one o’clock in the morning"|"It was still from Belgium that it was coming, given out by a dramatic staccato voice. This voice announced that at one o’clock in the morning some Messerschmitts and Stukas had flown over Belgian territory and had dropped bombs at several points."|"The Train"|"Georges Simenon"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"At eleven o’clock we were still not ready and Jeanne delayed us still further by being sick. I hesitated. I felt sorry for her. I asked myself whether, in view of her condition, I had any right to take her off into the unknown. She didn’t complain, bustling about and bumping her huge belly against the furniture and the door jambs."|"The Train"|"Georges Simenon"
"ap 10:30"|"Half past ten"|"I gave a start when somebody, striking a match to look at his watch, announced in an undertone:
“Half past ten …!”
Time was passing at once fast and slowly. To tell the truth, there was no time anymore."|"The Train"|"Georges Simenon"
"ap 09:10"|"Nine … ten"|"“Nine … ten … eleven … twelve … there are twelve of them … probably what they call a squadron. If it was the right time of the year and they weren’t making any noise, I’d swear they were storks.…”"|"The Train"|"Georges Simenon"

"~ 05:30"|"ABOUT HALF past five in the morning"|"AS USUAL, I WOKE UP AT DAWN, ABOUT HALF past five in the morning. Several of my companions, mostly peasants, were already sitting, wide awake, on the floor of the car. So as not to wake the others, they just said good morning to me with their eyes."|"The Train"|"Georges Simenon"
"ap 06:10"|"Ten past six"|"“What time is it?”
“Ten past six.”
“Where are we?”"|"The Train"|"Georges Simenon"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"Anna was still looking at me, and I wondered if she knew what mass on Sunday was like. Before Sophie was born, Jeanne and I used to go to high mass at ten o’clock. Afterward we went for a stroll around the town, greeting our acquaintances, before stopping at her sister’s to collect our cake."|"The Train"|"Georges Simenon"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"After Sophie, Jeanne got into the habit of going to the seven o’clock mass while I looked after the child, and later, when the little girl could walk, I took her with me to the ten o’clock mass while my wife cooked lunch."|"The Train"|"Georges Simenon"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"After Sophie, Jeanne got into the habit of going to the seven o’clock mass while I looked after the child, and later, when the little girl could walk, I took her with me to the ten o’clock mass while my wife cooked lunch."|"The Train"|"Georges Simenon"
10:30|"half past ten in the morning"|"The old men were eating in silence, as they must have done in the institution. The tables had been put together. The priest was at one end, the oldest of the nuns at the other. It was half past ten in the morning. Presumably to provide two meals in one, or because nobody knew what lay ahead of us, each of them had been given some cheese and a hard-boiled egg."|"The Train"|"Georges Simenon"
08:00|"eight o’clock this morning"|"“A train went to pick them up and left the dead and wounded at a bigger station, they don’t know which. Here, they made them get off their train because they needed the carriages, and they’ve been waiting since eight o’clock this morning.”"|"The Train"|"Georges Simenon"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"Jeanne had nothing to do with what was happening now, any more than the ten o’clock mass, for instance, my sister-in-law’s confectionery business, or the labeled radios on the shelves in my workshop."|"The Train"|"Georges Simenon"
18:00|"six o’clock in the evening"|"It was six o’clock in the evening. You couldn’t feel the chill of twilight yet. Nearly everybody got out to stretch their legs, except for the old men in the care of the priest and the nuns, and I saw middle-aged women with grim faces bending down to pick daisies and buttercups."|"The Train"|"Georges Simenon"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"“At the sanatorium they used to turn the lights out at eight o’clock.”"|"The Train"|"Georges Simenon"
03:00|"three o’clock in the morning"|"A clump of three trees hid us from sight and there was also a big, smelly patch of cow dung in which somebody had walked. The moon wouldn’t rise before three o’clock in the morning."|"The Train"|"Georges Simenon"
00:00|midnight|"More often than not she was still there at midnight, making a silent tour of inspection with the aid of a pocket flashlight, comforting women in tears, scolding men who were making too much noise."|"The Train"|"Georges Simenon"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"It was after midnight. The quay was deserted, all the lights camouflaged. Any footsteps could be heard a long way off. The hardest thing about it was going down the iron ladder embedded in the stone. The last few rungs were slimy."|"The Train"|"Georges Simenon"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"At five o’clock some German motorcyclists stopped outside the town hall and an officer asked to see Monsieur Vieiljeux."|"The Train"|"Georges Simenon"
"ap ~ 09:00"|"about nine o’clock"|"No trains had arrived for two days. The platforms were deserted, as were the waiting rooms, the refreshment room, and the military commandant’s office. The two soldiers, not having received any orders, didn’t know what to do, and it wasn’t until about nine o’clock that they propped their rifles against the wall and went off."|"The Train"|"Georges Simenon"
16:00|"four o’clock in the afternoon"|"It was dark by four o’clock in the afternoon and the street lamps were still painted blue, the shop windows unlighted. I had just finished a job when I remembered Dr. Wilhems, and I told myself that I had time to go over to his house before dinner."|"The Train"|"Georges Simenon"
