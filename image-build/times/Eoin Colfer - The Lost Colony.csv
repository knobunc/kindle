"ap > 08:00"|"After eight"|"‘Yes, Holly. Demons do not grow like other fairies. They are quite cuddly until they hit puberty, then their bodies undergo a violent and painful spasm, or warp. After eight to ten hours they emerge from a cocoon of nutrient slime as demons. Before that, they are simply imps. Not the warlocks though, they never warp. Instead, their magic blossoms. I don’t envy them. Instead of acne and mood swings, a pubescent warlock demon gets lightning bolts shooting out of his fingers. If he’s lucky.’"|"The Lost Colony"|"Eoin Colfer"

"ap 10:04"|"Ten four"|"Holly understood exactly what Foaly was trying to tell her.
‘Ten four, Foaly. I’m on my own. Officially.’
‘Exactly. As far as Commander Sool knows, you are simply shadowing the suspects. You are only to take action if they decide to go public. In that case your orders are, and I’m quoting Sool here, “to take the least complicated and most permanent course of action”.’"|"The Lost Colony"|"Eoin Colfer"
12:00|"twelve noon"|"‘I am deadly serious. Taipei is my second home. I know it well. You will have a tough enough time getting there by the deadline, so there will be no tricks. We will exchange on the observation deck at twelve noon, two days from now. If you don’t show, then the girl takes the express elevator down. If you see what I mean.’"|"The Lost Colony"|"Eoin Colfer"
12:00|noon|"The noon sun flashed through the ceiling-to-floor windows, catching on the silver of the mass damper, lighting it up like a disco ball. The tabletops loomed just above head height. Waiters and waitresses bustled past with loaded trays. Glasses fell; children screamed."|"The Lost Colony"|"Eoin Colfer"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"‘No, no. Salmon is not good enough. Squid and lobster are what we ordered. You have them here by eight o’clock, or I will come down there, slice you up and serve you as sushi instead.’"|"The Lost Colony"|"Eoin Colfer"
