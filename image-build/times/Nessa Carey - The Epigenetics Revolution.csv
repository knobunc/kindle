"ap 00:59"|"A to one"|"It’s all to do with a process called editing. It seems that human cells just can’t leave well-enough alone, particularly when it comes to ncRNA22. Once an ncRNA has been produced, human cells use various mechanisms to modify it yet further. In particular, they will often change the base A to one called I (inosine). Base A can bind to T in DNA, or U in RNA. But base I can pair with A, C or G. This alters the sequences to which an ncRNA can bind and hence regulate."|"The Epigenetics Revolution"|"Nessa Carey"
"ap 09:22"|9:22|"This rearrangement of chromosomes 9 and 22 actually happens relatively frequently in cells of the immune system. In fact it happens so often that this 9:22 hybrid has a specific name. It’s called the Philadelphia chromosome, after the city where it was first described. Ninety-five per cent of people who have a form of cancer called chronic myeloid leukaemia have the Philadelphia chromosome in their cancer cells. This abnormal chromosome causes this cancer in the cells of the immune system because of where the breaking and rejoining happen in the genome. The fusion of the two chromosome regions results in the creation of a hybrid gene called Bcr-Abl. The protein encoded by this hybrid gene drives cell proliferation forwards very aggressively."|"The Epigenetics Revolution"|"Nessa Carey"
