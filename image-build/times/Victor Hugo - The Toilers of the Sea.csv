12:00|noon|"In the archipelago of the Channel certain things belonging to the past can still be seen. This, for example: “Fief court held in the parish of St. Ouen, in Monsieur Malzard’s house, on Monday, May 22, 1854, at noon. Presided over by the seneschal, with the provost on his right and the serjeant on his left. Also present the noble squire, seigneur of Morville and other places, who possesses part of the parish in vassalage. The seneschal called on the provost to take the oath, in these terms: ‘You swear and promise, by your faith in God, that you will well and faithfully perform the duties of provost of the fief and seigneurie of Morville and preserve the rights of the seigneur.’ And the said provost, having raised his hand and bowed to the seigneur, said: ‘I swear so to do.’ ”"|"The Toilers of the Sea"|"Victor Hugo"
"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"The right of primogeniture exists; the tithe exists; the parish exists; the seigneur exists, both the seigneur of a fief and the seigneur of a manor; crying haro exists, as witness “The case of crying haro between Nicolle, esquire, and Godfrey, seigneur of Mélèches, was heard by the justices, after the court had been opened by the customary prayer” (Jersey, 1864). The livre tournois exists; seisin and disseisin exist; the right of forfeiture exists; feudal tenure exists; the redemption of family property exists; the past exists. There is the style of messire. There are the bailiff, the seneschal, centeniers, vingteniers, and douzeniers. There are the vingtaine at St. Savior’s and the cueillette at St. Ouen’s.54 Every year there is the “constables’ ride” to survey the state of the roads. It is headed by the viscount, 55 “bearing in his hand the royal staff.” There is the canonical hour, before noon. Christmas, Easter, Midsummer, and Michaelmas are the legal quarter days. Property is not sold, it is granted on lease. A dialogue like this may be heard in court: “Provost, is this the day, the place, and the hour at which the pleadings of the court of the fief and seigneurie have been published?”—“Yes.”—“Amen.”— “Amen.”"|"The Toilers of the Sea"|"Victor Hugo"

About nine o’clock, just after sunrise, since it was not yet time for the Anglicans to go to St. Sampson’s Church and the Wesleyans to the Eldad Chapel, the road was practically deserted. In the whole stretch between the first and second Martello towers there were only three people—a child, a man, and a woman. These three, walking at some distance from one another, had apparently no connection with one another. The child, whose age might be about eight, had stopped and was looking curiously at the snow. The man was perhaps a hundred paces behind the woman. Like her, he was making for St. Sampson. Youngish, he looked like a workman or seaman or something of that kind. He was dressed in his workaday clothes, a jacket of coarse brown cloth and trousers with tarpaulin leggings—suggesting that, notwithstanding the holy day, he was not on his way to church or chapel. His thick shoes of rough leather, the soles studded with large nails, left prints on the snow more like the lock of a prison gate than a man’s footprint. The woman for her part was evidently dressed for church: she wore a wide padded cloak of black ribbed silk, under which was a smart dress of Irish poplin striped white and pink, and but for her red stockings could have been taken for a Parisienne. She walked with a light and lively step, a gait that had not yet borne the weight of life and that revealed her to be a young girl. She had the fugitive grace of bearing that marks the most delicate of transitions— adolescence, the mingling of two twilight periods, the first emergence of a woman in the final stage of childhood. The man was paying no attention to her."|"The Toilers of the Sea"|"Victor Hugo"

00:00|midnight|"Witches and warlocks are by no means uncommon on Guernsey. In certain parishes they still practice their profession, and the nineteenth century makes no difference. Some of their practices are decidedly criminal. They boil up gold. They gather herbs at midnight. They cast the evil eye on people’s livestock. They are consulted by the local people; they ask to be brought the “water” of sick people in bottles, and are heard to murmur, “The water seems very sad.” One day in March 1856 one of them found seven devils in the “water” of a sick person. They are fearsome and are feared. One of them recently bewitched a baker “along with his oven.” Another is villainous enough to wafer and seal with great care envelopes “that contain nothing.” Another again goes so far as to have three bottles labeled B on a shelf in his house. These monstrous facts are well authenticated. Some witches and warlocks are obliging and, for two or three guineas, will take over your illnesses. Then they writhe about on their bed, groaning. While they are writhing you say: “There! I’m all right again.” Others will cure you of all ills by tying a handkerchief around your body: a remedy so simple that it is surprising no one has thought of it before. Last century the Royal Court of Guernsey put them on a pile of faggots and burned them alive. Nowadays it sentences them to eight weeks in prison, four weeks on bread and water alternating with four weeks in solitary confinement.

"~ 18:20"|"around 1820"|"Forty years ago the classical language of the sea could be heard in the mouths of the seamen of Jersey and Alderney. A visitor would have found himself carried back to the seafaring world of the seventeenth century. A specialist archaeologist could have gone there to study the ancient language, used in working ships and in battle, roared out by Jean Bart88 through the loud-hailer that terrified Admiral Hyde. The seafaring vocabulary of our fathers, almost completely changed in our day, was still in use on Guernsey around 1820. A ship that was a good plyer was a bon boulinier, one that carried a weather helm, in spite of her foresails and rudder, was a vaisseau ardent. To get under way was prendre l’aire; to lie to in a storm was capeyer; to make fast running rigging was faire dormant; to get to windward was  faire chapelle; to keep the cable tight was faire teste; to be out of trim was être en pantenne; to keep the sails full was  porter plain. All these terms have fallen out of use. Today we say  louvoyer (to beat to windward), they said leauvoyer; for naviguer (to sail) they said naviger; for virer (to tack) they said  donner vent devant; for aller de l’avant (to make headway) they said tailler de l’avant; for tirez d’accord (haul together) they said halez d’accord; for dérapez (weigh anchor), déplantez; for embraquez (haul tight), abraquez; for taquets (cleats), bittons; for burins (toggles),  tappes; for balancines (lifts), valancines; for tribord  (starboard), stribord; for les hommes de quart à bâbord (men of the port watch), les basbourdis. Admiral Tourville89 wrote to Hocquincourt, Nous avons singlé (sailed) instead of  cinglé. They said le ra fal for la rafale (squall);  boussoir for bossoir (cathead); drousse for drosse (truss);  faire une olofée for lo fer (to luff ); alonger for élonger (to lay alongside); survent for  forte brise (stiff breeze); jas for jouail (stock of an anchor); fosse for soute (storeroom)."|"The Toilers of the Sea"|"Victor Hugo"

Its left-hand corner, however, had broken away, forming one of those natural staircases commonly found in granite cliffs, with awkwardly shaped steps that sometimes call for the strides of a giant or the agility of a clown.

Its rectilinear radiance, broken up into long straight shafts of light over the opacity of the depths, growing lighter or darker from one crevice in the rock to another, looked as if it were divided by sheets of glass. There was light in this cavern, but light of an unknown kind. It had nothing of the quality of our everyday light. It was as if one had found one’s way onto another planet. This light was an enigma; it was like the glaucous gleam in the eye of a sphinx. The cavern resembled the interior of an enormous and magnificent skull; the vault was the cranium, the arch was the mouth; the sockets for the eyes were missing. The mouth, swallowing and disgorging the inflow and outflow of the sea, wide open to catch the full light of midday, drank in light and vomited forth bitterness. There are some beings, intelligent and evil, like that. The rays of the sun, passing through this porch obstructed by a vitreous mass of seawater, became green, like the glimmering light from Aldebaran. The water, filled with this moist light, appeared like molten emerald. The whole cavern had a soft aquamarine tinge of extraordinary delicacy. The vault of the cavern, with its lobes resembling those of a brain and its intricate ramifications like a network of nerves, was bathed in a tender shade of chrysoprase. The shimmering ripples on the water were reflected on the roof of the cavern, where they dissolved and re-formed endlessly, forming a golden mesh that was now wider and now narrower, in a mysterious dance movement. It had a spectral aspect; observing it, one might well wonder what prey secured or expectation to be realized gave rise to this joyously magnificent network of living fire. From the projections in the vault and the irregularities in the rock there hung long thin trails of vegetation, their roots probably bathed in some deposit of water higher up in the granite, with drops of water trickling like pearls, one after the other, from their tips. These pearls dropped into the gulf below with a gentle splash. The effect of the scene was indescribable. It was charming beyond all imagination and at the same time melancholy beyond all expression."|"The Toilers of the Sea"|"Victor Hugo"
12:00|"high noon"|"The weather seemed inclined to help him. It continued to be dry, and had little of an equinoctial feel about it. The month of March had come, but it had come in quietly. The days were growing longer. The blue of the sky, the vast gentle movements of the great expanse of space, the serenity of high noon—all this seemed to exclude any idea of evil intention. The sea looked cheerful in the sun. A preliminary caress gives piquancy to acts of betrayal; and the sea is lavish with such caresses. When you are dealing with a woman you must beware of her smiles."|"The Toilers of the Sea"|"Victor Hugo"

"< 00:00"|"almost midnight"|"But how long would it be before this happened? It would take six hours, and in six hours it would be almost midnight. How could Gilliatt possibly try to get away at that time of night? How could he trace the passage between the rocks, so inextricable even in daylight, and how could he risk sailing through the surrounding shoals in total darkness?"|"The Toilers of the Sea"|"Victor Hugo"
"< 12:00"|"Toward noon"|"Toward noon the sun seemed to him to be hotter than it should be. Midday is the critical hour of the day. Standing on the sturdy framework he had erected, Gilliatt looked out again at the vast expanse of sea."|"The Toilers of the Sea"|"Victor Hugo"

12:00|midday|"The trembling expanses of sea suffer assault and battery at their hands. What happens in these great wastes cannot be expressed. Some mysterious horseman is concealed amid the shadows. There is the noise of a forest in the air. Nothing can be seen, but the sound of horses galloping is heard. It is midday, and all at once it is night; a tornado sweeps past; it is midnight, and suddenly it is broad daylight; the emanations of the Pole are illuminated. Whirlwinds pass to and fro, reversing their direction in a kind of hideous dance: the trampling of plagues on the water. An overheavy cloud breaks in two and falls in pieces into the sea. Other clouds, purple-tinged, flash and rumble, then turn dark and somber; the cloud, emptied of its thunder, blackens like an extinguished ember. Sacks of rain burst open and dissolve into mist. Here there is a furnace amid falling rain, there a wave emitting flame. The white gleam of the sea beneath the rain reflects light on astonishing distant vistas; in the depths, constantly changing, can be seen vaguely recognizable forms. Monstrous navels open up in the clouds. Vapors swirl around, the waves pirouette; naiads, drunk, tumble about; as far as the eye can see the massive sluggish sea is in movement, but moving nowhere; everything is livid; from the pallor emerge desperate cries."|"The Toilers of the Sea"|"Victor Hugo"

"< 00:00"|"before midnight"|"The water was now becoming calmer, but there was still enough agitation out at sea to make immediate departure impossible. Moreover, it was too late in the day. With the load that the paunch now had on board, it would be necessary to leave in the morning in order to arrive in Guernsey before midnight."|"The Toilers of the Sea"|"Victor Hugo"
12:00|midday|"For the quest on which Gilliatt was engaged the outside of the reef offered better prospects than the interior. At low tide crabs are accustomed to take the air; they like to warm themselves in the sun. These misshapen creatures are happiest at midday. Their emergence from the water in the full light of day is a curious sight. Swarming in such numbers, they arouse a feeling almost of disgust. When you see them, with their awkward sidelong walk, clambering heavily from crevice to crevice up the lower parts of the rocks as if they were climbing a staircase, you are compelled to admit that the ocean has its own type of vermin."|"The Toilers of the Sea"|"Victor Hugo"
12:00|midday|"The sun continued its caresses, which were now almost ardent. The wind, which was already the wind of midday and of spring, drew close to Gilliatt, like a mouth breathing gently on him. He moved."|"The Toilers of the Sea"|"Victor Hugo"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"One evening in early May, after briefly watching the crescent moon amid the trees and listening to Déruchette walking by herself in the garden of Les Bravées in the evening coolness, Mess Lethierry had withdrawn to his room overlooking the harbor and gone to bed. Douce and Grace were already in bed. Except for Déruchette the whole house was asleep. In St. Sampson, too, everyone was asleep. Everywhere doors and shutters were closed. No one was moving in the streets. A few lights, like winking eyes about to close, shone here and there through dormer windows, showing that the servants were going to bed. It was some time since nine o’clock had struck on the old ivy-covered Norman belfry that shares with St. Brelade’s church on Jersey the peculiarity of having a date consisting of four ones (IIII), for the year eleven hundred and eleven."|"The Toilers of the Sea"|"Victor Hugo"
12:00|noon|"Mess Lethierry’s popularity in St. Sampson had depended on his success; and when his success was taken from him his popularity had declined. Bad luck seems to be contagious, and unlucky people seem to be stricken with plague, so quickly are they put into quarantine. The eligible sons of good families now avoided Déruchette. The isolation of Les Bravées was so complete that the household knew nothing of the great event—great by local standards—which that day had been the talk of St. Sampson. The rector of the parish, the Reverend Ebenezer Caudray, was now rich. His uncle, the magnificent dean of St. Asaph’s, had died in London, and the news had been brought from England that very morning by the mail sloop, the  Cashmere, whose mast could be seen in the anchorage at St. Peter Port. The Cashmere was due to leave for Southampton on the following day at noon, and, it was said, would have among its passengers the rector, recalled to England at short notice for the official reading of the will, to say nothing of other urgent matters concerned with the inheritance of a large estate. All day there had been much confused discussion of the event. The Cashmere, the Reverend Ebenezer, his late uncle, his wealth, his departure, his future prospects had kept the town in a buzz of interest. Only one house, Les Bravées, knew nothing of the news and remained silent."|"The Toilers of the Sea"|"Victor Hugo"
"ap 02:00"|two|"Mess Lethierry had thrown himself down on his hammock, fully dressed. Since the catastrophe that had hit the Durande this was all he felt like doing. Prisoners regularly resort to their wretched pallet, and Lethierry was a prisoner of his chagrin. He went to bed each night: it was a truce, a breathing space, a suspension of thought. Did he sleep at night? No. Did he lie awake? No. It would be true to say that for the past two and a half months—it was two and a half months since the catastrophe—Mess Lethierry had been living like a sleepwalker. He had not yet regained possession of his faculties. He was in the cloudy and confused state of mind of those who have suffered great afflictions. His reflections did not amount to thought; his sleep did not bring him repose. During the day he was not a man in a waking state, and during the night he was not a man asleep. He was up, and then he was lying down: that was all. When he was in his hammock he had some moments of forgetfulness that he called sleep; chimeras floated over him and within him, and the cloud of night, filled with blurred faces, passed through his brain; the emperor Napoleon dictated his memoirs to him; there were several Déruchettes; strange birds perched in trees, the streets of Lons-le-Saunier turned into snakes. Nightmares offered a respite from despair. He spent his nights in dreaming, his days in daydreams."|"The Toilers of the Sea"|"Victor Hugo"
"~ 00:00"|"around midnight"|"He remained with his eyes closed for some two hours, sleeping a little, meditating for much of the time. Such a state of torpor overlies a continuing activity of the brain that is very fatiguing. About the middle of the night, around midnight—a little before or a little after—he shook off his lethargy. He awoke, opened his eyes, and, looking out of the window, which was immediately opposite his hammock, saw an extraordinary sight."|"The Toilers of the Sea"|"Victor Hugo"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"Gilliatt’s return to St. Sampson was trouble-free but slow because of the weight of the paunch’s cargo. He arrived after dark, nearer ten o’clock than nine. He had calculated the time of his return: it was half-tide. There was enough water and there was a moon: it was possible to enter the harbor."|"The Toilers of the Sea"|"Victor Hugo"
12:00|noon|"“When does the Cashmere sail?”
“At noon.”
“By then the tide will be coming in. She’ll have the tide against her.”"|"The Toilers of the Sea"|"Victor Hugo"
"< 10:00"|"just short of ten o’clock in the morning"|"It was just short of ten o’clock in the morning—a quarter to, as they say on Guernsey. The crowds in St. Sampson, to all appearance, were still increasing. The mass of the population, consumed with curiosity, had flocked to the north of the island, and Havelet Bay, lying to the south, was even more deserted than usual."|"The Toilers of the Sea"|"Victor Hugo"
12:00|noon|"The Cashmere could be seen at anchor in the roads. Since it was not due to sail until noon, it was making no preparations for departure."|"The Toilers of the Sea"|"Victor Hugo"
12:00|midday|"“Boatman, wait for us here. We shall come back. Miss Déruchette, you asked me how I came here. The answer is very simple: I was walking behind you. You are twenty-one. In this country, when people are of age and dependent only on themselves, they can get married in a quarter of an hour. Let us take the path along the shore. It is quite safe: the sea will not cover it until midday. We must go at once. Follow me!”"|"The Toilers of the Sea"|"Victor Hugo"
"ap 10:30"|"half-past ten"|"The clock was striking half-past ten as they entered St. Sampson’s church. Because of the time, and also because of the abandonment of the town by its inhabitants on this particular day, the church was empty."|"The Toilers of the Sea"|"Victor Hugo"
12:00|noonday|"There was one spot on the deck that was bathed in sunshine, and it was this he was looking at. In this patch of sunlight were Ebenezer and Déruchette. They were sitting side by side, nestling close together, like two birds warming themselves in the noonday sun, on one of those benches sheltered under a tarpaulin awning that well-equipped vessels provide for their passengers, labeled, in the case of an English vessel, FOR LADIES ONLY. Déruchette’s head was on Ebenezer’s shoulder and his arm was around her waist; they held each other’s hands, the fingers intertwined. The difference between one angel and the other was reflected in these two exquisite faces informed by innocence. One was more virginal, the other more astral. Their chaste embrace was expressive: it held all the closeness of marriage, and all its modesty. The bench they were sitting on was a private nook, almost a nest. It was, too, a glory: the gentle glory of love fleeing in a cloud."|"The Toilers of the Sea"|"Victor Hugo"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"Hugo politely offered a piano. But, as the Ocean pointed out, a piano could never express the synaesthetic dialogue of sounds, sights, and scents. “The piano I need would not fit into your house. It has only two keys, one white and one black, day and night; the day full of birds, the night full of souls.” Hugo then suggested using Mozart as a go-between: “Mozart would be better,” agreed the Ocean. “I myself am unintelligible.”
HUGO: “Could you ask Mozart to come this evening at nine o’clock?”
THE OCEAN: “I shall have the message conveyed to him by the Twilight.”"|"The Toilers of the Sea"|"Victor Hugo"
