"> 19:00"|"after seven o’clock in the evening"|"By the time Mordechai Rottenberg married Dwora and Hershl on October 29, 1941, the Germans had occupied Antwerp for almost a year and a half. Every week, Jewish life was becoming more restricted. Banks could not accept Jewish deposits. Jews could not operate stores. The traditional Orthodox wedding at night under the stars was now impossible, because Jews were not allowed outside after seven o’clock in the evening. Rabbi Rottenberg had to make one of his rare compromises and perform the wedding ceremony during the day, inside the synagogue. Then lists of Jews who were to report to the train station for deportation to “work camps” started appearing. Dwora’s parents feared for their children, because they thought that labor camps would be looking for young people. So they persuaded the newlyweds to flee to France. Tens of thousands of Belgian Jews had already gone there, including Dwora’s brother and his wife, who were now in Lyons. The Jewish underground could get them through the occupied zone to southern France."|"A Chosen Few"|"Mark Kurlansky"

"> 19:48"|"after 1948"|"As in Czechoslovakia and everywhere else where Stalin’s influence was felt, the Polish regime hardened in tone and substance after 1948. Władysław Gomułka, with his Polish-nationalist brand of Communism, was removed from power, even imprisoned, and a government that followed every hand-gesture in the Kremlin was installed. But once again as things worsened for Poles, Jews saw an improvement in their lives. As the police state cracked down on the population, fascist and anti-Semitic activities were no longer tolerated. A Pole caught throwing Jews off trains or scribbling anti-Semitic graffiti—or, for that matter, any kind of graffiti—was quickly arrested. Also, Jews profited from the anti-Semitic stereotype of the żydokomuna (Jewish Communist). Polish anti-Semites became afraid of Jews because their own hate propaganda had convinced them that all Jews had connections to top-ranking state security people."|"A Chosen Few"|"Mark Kurlansky"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"Sunday morning, Gyula was sleeping in his bed. At six o’clock he was awakened and given some new books that had been wrapped for Christmas. These Jewish atheists celebrated Christmas. Then he was led to the bomb shelter that had been set up in the basement of the building in preparation for World War III. Gyula had spent his childhood dreading World War III, the inevitable showdown with the Americans that could happen at any time. All buildings had to have bomb shelters where the residents could sit out the nuclear holocaust."|"A Chosen Few"|"Mark Kurlansky"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"But another nine-year-old boy, Andras Kovacs, did think it was fun. Kovacs, like Konrád, was changed from a Kohen name in the last century. Andras’s father, Imre, was a Sachsenhausen survivor with many relatives who didn’t survive. Living in the sixth district in central Pest, not far from the traditional Jewish area, they had many Jewish neighbors. This was also a convenient location for the uprising. Only a few yards from the Kovacses’ building was a barricade, and neighborhood people would go home and shower or eat or rest and then go back to the barricades. One young man in their building went to the barricade faithfully every morning at eight o’clock. Andras remembers it as “a sort of comfortable revolution.” His parents seemed confident that soon United Nations troops would arrive and Hungary would be declared neutral—the Austrian solution. But one day, as Andras was walking in the street with his mother, two rebels raised their arms in fascist salutes and greeted each other, “Sieg heil,” and then his mother started to be frightened."|"A Chosen Few"|"Mark Kurlansky"

He observed strange things going on in this imposing building, in a strange language with strange music. Zoltán may have been drawn to other Jews, but he did not feel that his place was in the Dohány."|"A Chosen Few"|"Mark Kurlansky"

Then they had breakfast together–coffee, herring, eggs. A few deals were made. A broken watch could be shown to the jeweler, some silver might be discussed with the silver dealer. And there were family matters–matches to be made, marriages to be arranged. By nine o’clock, they were all off to work. It was all in Yiddish, and some older immigrants, finding that Yiddish was all that they needed, never learned Flemish."|"A Chosen Few"|"Mark Kurlansky"

15:00|15|"Levy Kohane was there with his father, seeing off his younger brother David. David was very quiet and studious. He had been very attached to his mother and had seemed depressed since her death a year before. At 15, he was the baby of the family, and everyone fussed over him and worried about him. The summer camp would probably be good for him. His brother and father said their good-byes and walked away. As Levy crossed the street, he noticed a young man at the corner throwing rocks. This kind of thing was happening sometimes now—some troubled kid would decide to throw a few rocks at the Jews."|"A Chosen Few"|"Mark Kurlansky"
"ap 07:30"|7:30|"On Friday, October 3, at 7:30, when the evening Sabbath service should have been ending, a bomb exploded in front of the Rue Copernic synagogue. Because the service had run a little late, there were fewer fatalities than planned. Still, more than twenty people were injured, including some inside the synagogue. Four people who had happened down the short street at the time were killed. One of them, by coincidence, was an Israeli tourist. The others were non-Jews. French Prime Minister Raymond Barre was quick to denounce “this odious attack which was intended for Jews on their way to the synagogue and which struck innocent Frenchmen crossing the street.”"|"A Chosen Few"|"Mark Kurlansky"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"Three months after the Goldenberg attack, a bomb exploded in front of a synagogue in the Antwerp diamond district. Once again, the attackers had completely misread their target. They imagined that a synagogue in the heart of the diamond district, the only nonmodern building in that little hook of streets behind the Pelikaanstraat, would be a direct hit on the Jewish establishment. In fact, the synagogue has little to do with the diamond district and serves the small Sephardic community. The bomb was placed there on the morning of Simchat Torah, a holiday which celebrates the conclusion of the annual cycle of Torah readings, when all of the Torahs are removed from the arc and carried around the synagogue to the accompaniment of singing and dancing. Children join in, carrying candles and little flags. The next morning, the celebration is repeated. But because in Antwerp Jews tend to be excessive about these events, the night before they had danced late into the night. Realizing that they would have only a few hours to sleep, they postponed the nine o’clock morning service to nine-thirty. The bomb went off at nine-fifteen, blowing out the metal and glass facades of the diamond district and killing three and wounding 106 people, all of them non-Jews. The Jews who worked in diamonds were all in synagogues outside of the diamond district."|"A Chosen Few"|"Mark Kurlansky"

12:00|midday|"The Czech Republic was selling off its state industries by offering shares to the public. But the new Slovak state was deferring such decisions, because it was keeping the economy at least limping for the time being and besides, it was hard to imagine anyone buying into a Slovak steel mill. Life was, if not prosperous, at least peaceful in the new republic. The inevitable economic crisis had not yet hit, and while the government took a strident tone toward Czechs and gypsies, there were few problems for Jews. There were occasional incidents. In September 1993 the skinheads who based themselves by the bridge cornered Baruch Myer on a quiet street at midday and beat him. But most Slovaks were still honoring Jews, still thinking of this as an anti-Communist act."|"A Chosen Few"|"Mark Kurlansky"
"ap 05:15"|"quarter past five"|"Isaac was a successful and well-adjusted man. The great irony of his life was that if his world had not been torn up by a Holocaust, he would have spent his life selling bananas in the Rotterdam market. When he turned 50, he completely broke down and sought psychiatric help. “You start looking back. I have reached things my parents couldn’t dream of. My father was a poor man working in the market. My brothers worked in the market. All my uncles, as far as I know, worked in the market. Without a war I would have, too. Without any doubt. I worked so hard that I became a professor. I studied so hard. I was from such poor surroundings that I would never have gone to a secondary school. But I worked so hard, when I came home at quarter past five and I asked my wife when we would have dinner and she would say ten minutes, I would go to my study and work for ten minutes. Later, with the help of a psychiatrist, I found out that I didn’t want to give myself the leisure to think. To sit and think, to sit and listen to music. I was frightened. If you are fifty, you can’t stand it anymore. You have to sit down and think over what you have done in your life. And then the war comes. The memories. The problems.”"|"A Chosen Few"|"Mark Kurlansky"

They were wound up and waiting for their father to get home. The Passover seder is for children—to teach them the meaning of freedom. To ask them questions. Challenge them. It is fun because it is a ritual in which they play a central role.

Seders were messy at the Altmanns’. Four times the wineglass gets filled to the brim for blessings, and little six-year-old Ariel, with bright dark eyes like his mother, invariably kicked the table as he anxiously shifted around and the wine always spilled. Daniel drank each glass in a single long gulp, leaning on his left arm. “We drink on the left side because we are free men,” he explained.
