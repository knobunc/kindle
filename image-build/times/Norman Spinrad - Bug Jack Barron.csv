"ap 09:57"|9:57|"Howards’ eyes fell on the wall clock: 9:57, Mountain Time. Reflexively, his attention shifted to the tiny dormant screen of the vidphone (Mr. Howards is not to be disturbed by anyone for anything tonight, not even Jack Barron) on the bedside table next to the small TV set. His stomach tightened with fear of the unknown, the random, exposure."|"Bug Jack Barron"|"Norman Spinrad"
00:00|midnight|"Nevertheless, Benedict Howards reached out, turned on the TV set, waited stomach-knotted, through color images of Dodges, network emblem, Coke bottles dancing, plastic piece of ass starlet smoking Kools Supreme, station emblem, waited frowning tense in the cool night breeze, knowing others waited, bellies rumbling with his in quiet air-cooled vaults of power in New York, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Washington waiting for three words (scarlet on midnight-blue background) to begin the hour’s ordeal of waiting, glancing at dead vidphones, pustules of Harlem, Watts, Mississippi, Strip City, Village niggers, loafers, losers randomly popping—a hundred million cretins, hunched forward, smelling for blood, blue venous blood from circles of power:"|"Bug Jack Barron"|"Norman Spinrad"

"ap 02:00"|"Two o’clock"|"“Never mind all that,” Howards said coldly. “We’ve got some business to transact, remember? You’ve already cost me Christ knows how many votes in Congress with this last disaster, and it’s about time—”
“Not on the phone,” Jack broke in. “My office. Two o’clock tomorrow.”
“Look, Barron, you’ve mickey moused me long enough. No one plays games with Benedict How—”"|"Bug Jack Barron"|"Norman Spinrad"
"ap ~ 07:00"|"about seven"|"Howards tucked the contracts safely into his attaché case. “Okay,” he said, “so then I suppose I can talk freely in front of her. (Time for the spurs, Barron, you’ll have to get used to ’em anyway, and your woman might as well get the message right at the beginning, see who’s boss, how’s that grab you, smart-ass?) I’ll send a car for you about seven tonight, take you to the airport. We’ll have plenty of time to put your next show together on the way to Colorado."|"Bug Jack Barron"|"Norman Spinrad"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"“We’ll play it your way,” Howards said. “You’ve been at it a long time, and should know what you’re doing.” He got up, feeling a day’s work well done. “Car’ll pick you up at seven, and about two days from now you’ll have had the big payoff. Think about it, getting up every morning for the next million—”"|"Bug Jack Barron"|"Norman Spinrad"
05:00|"five in the morning"|"“You know what time it is, Donner?” Barron snarled, then lowered his voice, remembering Sara’s sleeping against his lap and, boy, what a night, am I sore! “’Cause I sure don’t. Must be four or five in the morning. Where’d you learn your manners, in the Gestapo?”"|"Bug Jack Barron"|"Norman Spinrad"
04:00|"four a.m."|"“Bully for you, Donner,” Barron grumbled. Figures that this putz with all his S.J.C. bullshit would end up as flack for a lox like Hennering! Now with Hennering dead, I’m supposed to get him another job—at four a.m.? Jesus—"|"Bug Jack Barron"|"Norman Spinrad"
05:00|"5 a.m."|"’Course there’s something to be said for the jungle, Barron thought, clocking the alive, desperate faces, jazz of the streets moving nice and easy in a liquid sulky beat, sensual relief of a junkie making his score, smirking mating-dance bridal-bargain between a tall thin cat and a little A-head-eyed whore. It’s nitty and it’s gritty and it’s all here you happen to be black, in Strip City, the Village, H-A, you happen to be cool. But if you’re a square old shade with no jungle inside you at all, never walked down MacDougal at 5 a.m., never from door to East Side Puerto Rican door, never felt the heat, never saw The Man out there waiting—then, baby, when you hear those tom-toms wailing from Evers Harlem East Village tribal jungles, better pour another stinger, rub on the old citronella, and fit a new clip in your carbine, ’cause the natives are restless tonight."|"Bug Jack Barron"|"Norman Spinrad"
00:00|midnight|"“Man’s as old as his glands,” Howards was saying. “You could keep the hormone balance you had as a kid, you’d never stop growing…No, that’s wrong, I think…or…but that’s not important. Point is, you’re no older than your glands. Up to a point, a kid’s glands keep his body from aging, something about anabolism exceeding catabolism, whatever that means. Anyway, whatever it means, the moment it reverses you start to age, start dying, fading black…Way they explained it, normally a human being’s either growing or aging, never inbetween, depending on the balance of his glands. It’s like a clock at midnight—between one tick and the next it’s a different day, one tick you’re growing, next tick you’re aging. You keep growing, sooner or later it kills you, they told me, but I don’t really understand why…But anyway, the moment your glands pass over that line, sometime in your teens, they say, you start to die. You see, Barron? You see? Immortality’s all in the tick.”"|"Bug Jack Barron"|"Norman Spinrad"
"ap 00:00"|"twelve o’clock"|"“You’re pretty dumb, Barron, can’t you see it? If it’s exactly twelve o’clock Tuesday night and you stop the clock right on the moment it stops being Tuesday, and before it can start being Wednesday you’re caught inbetween. Not growing, not aging. That smart-ass Palacci calls it ‘Homeostatic Endocrine Balance.’ Stop that gland ‘clock’ right between ticks and keep it there, balanced between growing and aging, and that’s immortality. That’s what we’ve got, way to take all the glands and keep ’em balanced what they call homeostatically forever. Forever! We got glands that’ll stay young forever, Barron. That’s why we’ll never die.”"|"Bug Jack Barron"|"Norman Spinrad"
