"< 06:29"|"just before half past six in the morning"|"“At a time like this, too,” said Miss Treason, laying down the shamble. “This is so inconvenient. But there is no doubt.” She paused for a moment and said: “I will die the day after tomorrow. On Friday, just before half past six in the morning.”"|Wintersmith|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap ~ 06:30"|"around half past six"|"“She’s not really dying, is she?”
“Yes. At around half past six tomorrow morning.”
“But she’s very old!”"|Wintersmith|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap ~ 04:00"|"around four o’clock"|"The witches started arriving around four o’clock, and Tiffany went out into the clearing to do air traffic control. Annagramma arrived by herself, looking very pale and wearing more occult jewelry than you could imagine. And there was a difficult moment when Mrs. Earwig and Granny Weatherwax arrived at the same time, and circled in a ballet of careful politeness as each waited for the other to land. In the end, Tiffany directed them into different corners of the clearing and hurried away."|Wintersmith|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"I took the hiver through the Dark Door, Tiffany thought, as she viciously scraped food scraps into the garden for the birds. The White Horse came out of the hill for me. I got my brother and Roland back from the Queen of the Elves. And I danced with the Wintersmith, who turned me into ten billion snowflakes. No, I don’t want to be in a cottage in these damp woods, I don’t want to be a kind of slave to people who can’t be bothered to think for themselves, I don’t want to wear midnight and make people afraid of me. There is no name for what I want to be. But I was old enough to do all those things, and I was acceptable."|Wintersmith|"Terry Pratchett"
12:00|noon|"It was noon. Tiffany had invented the word noonlight because she liked the sound of it. Anyone could be a witch at midnight, she’d thought, but you’d have to be really good to be a witch by noonlight."|Wintersmith|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"It was noon. Tiffany had invented the word noonlight because she liked the sound of it. Anyone could be a witch at midnight, she’d thought, but you’d have to be really good to be a witch by noonlight."|Wintersmith|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap ~ 07:00"|"About seven"|"“What time is it?” she managed.
“About seven,” said the woman.
“Seven!” Tiffany pushed the sheets back. “I’ve got to get up! Mrs. Ogg will be wanting her breakfast!”"|Wintersmith|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap ~ 07:00"|"around seven"|"“And as for skulls,” said Tiffany, “just wait a moment.” She went upstairs and got the Boffo catalogue, which she’d hidden in her old suitcase. She came back with it carefully rolled up and handed it over. “Don’t look at it now,” she said. “Wait until you’re alone. You might find it gives you ideas. Okay? I’ll come and meet you around seven tonight.”"|Wintersmith|"Terry Pratchett"
"~ 02:00"|"around two o’clock in the morning"|"It was important to remember these things around two o’clock in the morning. Vitally important, when the candle flickered."|Wintersmith|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 05:30"|"half past five"|"Then there was another night without dreams, but Tiffany woke up with a snap at half past five, feeling…odd."|Wintersmith|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 01:00"|one|"“But it is one,” said Nanny Ogg innocently. “It’s the larder. It’s, like, everything waiting to grow next spring.”"|Wintersmith|"Terry Pratchett"
"~ 00:00"|"Around midnight"|"Around midnight, Tiffany woke up because a white chicken was standing on her chest. She pushed it off and reached down for her slippers, and found only chickens. When she got the candle alight, she saw half a dozen chickens on the end of the bed. The floor was covered in chickens. So were the stairs. So was every room down below. In the kitchen, chickens had overflowed into the sink."|Wintersmith|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"“You’ve been sleeping since nine o’clock, my girl,” she said. “Time to go home, I think.”"|Wintersmith|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"Very, very thick would be the best way to describe the walls of the castle. There were no guards at night, because they locked up at eight o’clock and went home. Instead, there was Old Robbins, who’d once been a guard and was now officially the night watchman, but everyone knew he fell asleep in front of the fire by nine. He had an old trumpet that he was supposed to blow if there was an attack, although no one was entirely sure what this would achieve."|Wintersmith|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"Roland slept in the Heron Tower because it was up a long flight of steps that his aunts didn’t much like climbing. It also had very, very thick walls, and this is just as well, because at eleven o’clock someone stuck a trumpet against his ear and blew on it hard."|Wintersmith|"Terry Pratchett"
