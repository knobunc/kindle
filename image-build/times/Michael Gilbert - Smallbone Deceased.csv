It was a night of low clouds, with rain behind the clouds, and he buttoned his mackintosh round his neck determined to keep his mind rigorously away from anything to do with Horniman and Birley and Craine."|"Smallbone Deceased"|"Michael Gilbert"

A two-berth boat really—but he handles her alone and it’s wholly pretty to watch him.”"|"Smallbone Deceased"|"Michael Gilbert"
"ap 06:45"|"quarter to seven"|"“Of course,” said Bob. “Well, that evening Miss Chittering was killed, of course, we were having dinner together. Not at that place in the Strand.

"ap ~ 11:15"|"about a quarter past eleven"|"“Yes,” said Bob. “Well, as you can imagine, we neither of us felt like doing much office work. We pushed off at about a quarter past eleven, as a matter of fact, and caught the midday train for Chaffham. It gets in at two o’clock. I expect Mrs. Mullet would confirm—oh, there’s the phone.”"|"Smallbone Deceased"|"Michael Gilbert"

21:00|"nine o’clock that evening"|"It was nine o’clock that evening. Hazlerigg was sitting in a third-class railway carriage, on his way back to London. When he had got into the carriage it had been empty, but he had been vaguely aware that two girls had got in at Ipswich. He was deeply engaged with his own thoughts."|"Smallbone Deceased"|"Michael Gilbert"
12:00|midday|"He was reviewing the case to see how it looked without its central character. For Bob Horniman, in his opinion, was out of it. Not that his Saturday morning alibi was worth much. He could have murdered Smallbone and been in plenty of time to catch the midday train for Chaffham. Nor could you describe as strong corroboration the evidence of the girl with whom you were in love. But on one factor of certainty, on one base of the living rock, Hazlerigg rested his conviction of Bob’s innocence. The same pair of hands had committed both murders. No one, be they never so crafty or calculating, could have reproduced that fractional left-handed pull which hallmarked both killings. And if Bob had been at his Soho restaurant at a quarter to seven he could not have killed Miss Chittering. The alibi had to be verified, but he was certain he would find that it was so."|"Smallbone Deceased"|"Michael Gilbert"

"ap 10:15"|"quarter past ten"|"“Look here,” he said. “You’ll have to listen and not ask questions. I’ve just stopped the Cromer Express and I reckon I’ve got two minutes. Get hold of that chap Hayman—the shop assistant in that bag shop in the Strand—yes—Miss Chittering’s boyfriend. I want to find out who bought a rucksack there on the morning of—let me see—Saturday, February 20th. A large green rucksack. Play fair. Show him all the photographs. Yes, I know it’s Saturday night. I don’t care how you set about it. You can ask for what help you like. If he isn’t at home, put out a general alert and pick him up where you find him. At the cinema, at the pub, on the streets. This train is due at Liverpool Street at a quarter past ten, and I want you to get the information and meet me at the station with a police car and a good driver. I know it doesn’t leave you much time, but that’s the way it’s got to be.”"|"Smallbone Deceased"|"Michael Gilbert"

"~ 21:00"|"about nine o’clock that evening"|"At about nine o’clock that evening Bohun was sitting in his upper room, underneath the portrait of the severe lady (who was his grandmother), and he was thinking about developments in automatic accounting machinery. He had seen an up-to-date model demonstrated recently. Accounts were fed into it in the form of cards, each card being punched with a combination of holes and slots representing the figures of the account. The machine would then perform any operation of addition, subtraction, proportion, collation or extraction which the abstrusest fancy of the accountant might dictate. What had particularly amused Bohun had been that on an incorrectly punched card being inserted, the machine gave a most human scream, a red light shone, and the card was ejected on to the floor. It occurred to him that this was exactly what was wrong with the proposition of Bob Horniman as murderer. Every time he presented that particular card to his mental processes they as promptly rejected it."|"Smallbone Deceased"|"Michael Gilbert"
"ap 00:10"|"ten past twelve"|"Apart from this there was the consideration that if Bob Horniman had committed the murder on his Saturday morning at the office, then Anne Mildmay must almost certainly have been privy to it. Their statements proved this. They said they had left the office together at ten past twelve and had parted at about twenty past. Now with Smallbone due at the office at twelve-fifteen (vide his letter) either this meant that they were both lying about times or that Bob had not left the office at all, but had got Miss Mildmay to perjure herself and say that he had. In which case she must have had more than a shrewd idea all along that he was the murderer. This Bohun refused to believe. There was something between them – you didn’t have to be very observant to see that. Anne Mildmay was angry and hurt with Bob, and there was a state of emotional tension between them. But it wasn’t the tension of guilty knowledge shared."|"Smallbone Deceased"|"Michael Gilbert"

"ap 06:45"|"quarter to seven"|"“Yes,” said Anne, “it wouldn’t be awfully convincing, I know. But that Tuesday night, when Miss Chittering got killed. That’s absolutely watertight.

"ap 06:40"|"twenty to seven"|"“A bit before, I should say. The waiter—that is, he’s really the proprietor’s brother—said something to Bob about ‘On time, as usual’ and Bob said: ‘Your clock’s fast.

"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"He wondered if everybody was always as slow and as stupid as they had all been, at seeing what lay under their noses. Of course, neither of her alibis was worth the paper it was written on. To start with, her companion at the office on that Saturday morning had been Eric Duxford. He could guess how much that meant. Eric no doubt arrived, put in a nominal ten minutes’ work and then went straight away to his other office. In fact, now that Bohun thought of it, had there not been an entry in Eric’s “private” appointment diary for eleven o’clock on February 10th – the very Saturday morning in question? Then, again, was it pure luck that Miss Cornel should have been at the office with such an accommodating partner? He rather thought not. It had originally been Miss Chittering’s Saturday. Miss Cornel’s story was that Miss Cluttering had asked her to change Saturdays. What would Miss Chittering’s version have been – if anyone had thought to ask her?"|"Smallbone Deceased"|"Michael Gilbert"
