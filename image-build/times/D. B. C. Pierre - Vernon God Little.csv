Or rather, I would’ve been hung out to dry if I was even coming back to pay him. But I ain’t coming back. Today I’ll give the gun a wipe, grab my escape fund from the bank, and blow the hell out of town. For real.

"ap 02:29"|"twenty-nine minutes after two"|"I lean my bike against the fence and step up to the phone. It’s twenty-nine minutes after two. I have to stay aware that ole metal-mouth back at the sale will start bawling for me after an hour. I wipe the phone mouthpiece on my pants leg, a thing you learn to do up this end of town, and call up CMN in Nacogdoches. CMN – CNN – Get it? Fucken Lally, boy. New York my fucken wiener."|"Vernon God Little"|"D. B. C. Pierre"
14:38|"two thirty-eight in the afternoon"|"It’s two thirty-eight in the afternoon. Hot and sticky, with fast-moving clouds bunched low across the sky. I get to within two hundred yards of the den and hear a hammer-blow. Something moves in the bushes up ahead. It’s ole Tyrie Lasseen, who runs Spares & Repairs, sinking markers into the ground. He’s dressed in a suit and tie. He jackrabbits before I can hide."|"Vernon God Little"|"D. B. C. Pierre"
"ap 02:56"|"four minutes to three"|"It’s the meatworks posse. I know it even before the marching band strikes up.

Lally’s rental car is out front. I enter like a ghost through the kitchen screen. At first everything’s quiet inside. Then there’s a knock at the front door.

07:30|"seven-thirty this Monday morning"|"By seven-thirty this Monday morning I’m sat in a dirt clearing behind some bushes at Keeter’s, sucking beer and waiting for ideas about cash. From where I sit you can watch the sun piss orange around the rims of those ole abandoned toilet bowls. I have my beers, my joints, and Country music pumping deep into my brain. I’m ready to howl like a coon-dog. I use it all to try and plot my position in life. There’s me here, and Mexico down there. Taylor Figueroa in between. All I have to figure out is the rest of it. ‘Get to the Nub of Things,’ as Mr Nuckles used to say, back when his goddam mouth worked. To be honest, the only new information that comes to me is a whole swarm of lies about my so-called job. Take note of what happens in a lie-world like this; by the time you’re in this deep, and you’ve invented an imaginary job, with an imaginary start time, and imaginary pay, and put your loved-ones through the sandwich routine, and ‘Oh my God should I call Hildegard Lasseen,’ and all – it doesn’t matter anymore whether you admit the lie, or just get fucken busted doing it. People go, ‘But he was so credible.’ They start to realize you introduced them to a whole parallel world, full of imaginary shit. It’s a pisser, I know it, I don’t blame them at all. But it’s like suddenly you qualify for membership in the fucken Pathology Zone, even though those same people immediately turn around and go, ‘Can’t make it, Gloria – my folks just flew in from Denver.’"|"Vernon God Little"|"D.

"ap 10:30"|ten-thirty|"The Lechugas’ teddy farm seems ole and squashed when I wake up next morning. Another Tuesday morning, two weeks after That Day. The shade under their willow is empty. Kurt is quiet, Mrs Porter’s door is closed. Beulah Drive is clean of strangers for the first time since the tragedy. June is barely underway, but it’s as if summer’s liquor has evaporated, leaving this dry residue of horror. At ten-thirty the phone rings."|"Vernon God Little"|"D. B. C. Pierre"
"ap < 10:00"|"a little before ten"|"It’s a little before ten. I can reach the highway in a couple of hours, then maybe hitch a ride, or catch a bus or something, down to San Antone. I take a last look at Martirio sparkling across the flats, my universe for all these long years. Then I set off toward the hills, all crusty and alone. My coping mechanisms open up to some cream pie. Remember that ole movie, with the beach-house? Plenty of folks must do that, for real. Nothing says you have to be a particular kind of person to do that. I imagine Mom coming down, after things blow over. I buy her some souvenirs. Maybe I send a maid back with her; she can jam that up Leona’s fat ass. A learning: deep shit sweetens your plans like crazy."|"Vernon God Little"|"D. B. C. Pierre"
00:00|midnight|"It’s midnight when the first headlights flicker through the branches by the highway. To be honest, I don’t even know which way is south. My ole man thought Scouts was for sissies, so I don’t even know which fucken way is south in life. Instead of trying to figure it out, I call some Glen Campbell to mind, to help me lope along, crusty and lonesome, older than my years. ‘Wichita Lineman’ is the song I call up, not ‘Galveston’. I would’ve conjured Shania Twain or something a little more sassy, but that might boost me up too much. What happens with sassy music is you get floated away from yourself, then snap back to reality too hard. I hate that. The only antidote is to just stay depressed."|"Vernon God Little"|"D. B. C. Pierre"
"ap < 01:00"|"nearly one o’clock"|"It’s nearly one o’clock Wednesday morning when moonlight finally drips through the clouds to color everything frosty gray. Texas is so fucken beautiful. If you ain’t here already, you should come. Feel free to skip Martirio, that’s all. Herds of trucks and cars pass on the highway, but none of them look like they’d stop. I mean, I know they won’t stop if I don’t get up and stop them, don’t get me wrong. I just don’t like my chances. A better idea is to wait for a bus, which has an established tradition of stopping. I settle in the crook of a bend in the highway, pull my jacket from the pack, and fashion a backrest against a bush. I sit and wait, and turn some learnings over in my head."|"Vernon God Little"|"D. B. C. Pierre"
"> 05:00"|"after five in the morning"|"A chill wades through my skin to wake me. It’s after five in the morning. I hear the roar of a bus on the highway, and hoist my pack up to the roadside. A motorcoach hammers around the bend, glowing cool and cozy inside. I flap my arms, and make like I just arrived from the scene of an urgent reason to travel. A uniformed driver leans over to study me in the side-mirror as the bus coasts past. Then, ‘Pschhsss,’ he pulls over and stops, two hundred yards down the highway. I fly towards those tail-lights."|"Vernon God Little"|"D. B. C. Pierre"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"It’s light when we roll into San Antone, but too early to be busy. I’m as hungry as a loose dog. My eyes are still gritty with salt. I skulk around the terminal restroom until eight o’clock, then I go to the phones to call Taylor Figueroa’s folks. I just feel empty, drained of my life juices. The current logic is this: if I can get Taylor’s number, and take the first step into my dream, it’ll boost me up, maybe even enough to call home and explain things. If I don’t get Taylor’s number, then I’ll have so little left to lose that I’ll call home anyway, because I won’t care about being boosted up."|"Vernon God Little"|"D. B. C. Pierre"

"ap < 01:00"|"just before one o’clock"|"The Houston bus costs twenty-two bucks. I’m hungry, but I only have forty-four bucks fifty left. Getting both of us to Mexico will cost more than that. When my bus pulls into Houston, just before one o’clock, I head to the phones and look up ‘Cash’ in the yellow pages. My music has to go. A cab drives me miles away, to a pawnbroker where I get offered twenty-five bucks for my two-hundred-dollar stereo, which I accept because the taxi meter is running, and already cost me ten bucks, which I had to pay up-front as soon as the driver knew we were going to a fucken pawnbroker. I also get offered twenty-five cents apiece for my discs. I sneer at the pawnbroker, and he gets mad. Real red ass on the pawnbroker, actually, as we say down here."|"Vernon God Little"|"D. B. C.

"ap < 11:00"|"nearly eleven o’clock"|"The unexpected thing when the bus rolls into McAllen is the stillness. The driver switches off the engine, the door goes ‘Pschsssss,’ and the world just parks. It’s nearly eleven o’clock and there’s a new silence, loud with the creasing of clothes, as I rise out of the seat. It’s like waking from a fever, specially after all these venomous thoughts. I follow other unfolded travelers to the front of the bus, where a smoky breath meets me at the door. Maybe a tang of freedom. The border is less than ten miles away."|"Vernon God Little"|"D. B. C. Pierre"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"I cross the highway at the darkest point, and pound along its shadow side, invisible, just two clear veins throbbing slime and lightning. Up ahead a road sign points to Mexico. Traffic trickles past it. I don’t even know how far I have to go, I just run till I’m dead, then limp till I can run again. It’s after midnight when the sparks die under my feet. I slow to a shuffle, and strangle a hiss in my throat. Waves loom at my back, crested waves which instead of foam spill flies, flies I have to kill, thoughts of defeat in a grubby swarm. Jesus comes with them, waving, but he’s engulfed, drowning, gulping flies that join with the night to claim all his colors, return him to black. I stop, the way a rock stops that never moved. My head hangs buzzing in the dark, and when I raise it up, after a century’s pause, I see a glow up ahead. I stumble forward, and see the glow become a glare, a kind of high-beam extravaganza in the middle of nowhere."|"Vernon God Little"|"D. B. C. Pierre"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"I limp to an ole phone on the wall, and pretend to put coins in it. Then I fuck around in my pack like a total dork-hole. I even pretend to talk on the goddam phone. Really, it’s this kind of shit that brings up the whole psycho argument. After chewing the fat with my so-called parents, I sit on an empty stretch of bench, drifting into this endless purgatory while the fan squeaks like a sackful of rats. I sit until three in the morning, then three-thirty, horny for cool bedsheets. You know the one voice in your head that makes sense, like your internal nana or whatever? Mine just says, ‘Grab a burger and cop some Zs, until it all makes a little more sense.’"|"Vernon God Little"|"D. B. C. Pierre"

00:00|midnight|"By midnight on this foreign Friday in June, a permanent shiver hangs around me. I leave my flesh and bones at the northern edge of Mexico City, and just the noodles of my nervous system drive with me south. We only nearly get killed a dozen times. When we finally pop out of the city, we’re in a dangerous condition to be driving. Just like everybody else around. Alpine forests we drive through, dodging humongous motorcoaches lit up like space shuttles, down to tropical places that give way to areas of rock and cactus, and empty noise on the radio. Everything adds up to make me edgy. I expect to see Dr Goosens’s secretary out here, or the meatworks’ marching band or something. I try to keep the dream weaving in my head, a thread of Taylor, a thread of beach, a thread of ‘Sailing’. But the weaving gets harder, the threads get matted and replaced by veins. ‘Devastated, devastated, devastated . . .’"|"Vernon God Little"|"D. B. C. Pierre"

After a couple of hours of flashes, which is a lot, we descend through puffy tumors that hang over Houston Intercontinental airport. When the plane turns to land you get a view of eight thousand patrol cars on the ground, lights flashing off recently wet concrete, and probably sirens and game-show buzzers running as well. All for little Vernon, Vernon Little. After landing, the plane turns toward some bleachers set up around an empty section by the airport perimeter. We slow and park sideways to the stands, and I’m drenched through the window by flashlight from crowds of media. You physically feel the jackrabbit pulse that says, ‘There he is!’ It’s Tuesday, exactly three weeks since hell’s tumble-dryer went to work on our lives. Although it’s four in the morning, you just know every household in the land is tuned in. ‘There he fucken is!’"|"Vernon God Little"|"D. B. C. Pierre"
