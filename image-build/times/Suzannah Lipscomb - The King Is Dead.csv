02:00|2am|"There is a strange symmetry to the dates. The founder of the Tudor dynasty, Henry VII, was born in obscurity on 28 January 1457; his famous, infamous, son died in the profound darkness of a winter’s night on the same day ninety years later. He was fifty-five years old, grossly overweight, and had been plagued for a decade by a terrible running sore on his leg that had recently forced him into the Tudor equivalent of a wheelchair and a stairlift.1 He was also still ‘Henry the Eighth, by Grace of God, King of England, Ireland and France, Defender of the Faith, and Supreme Head of the Church of England’, and at 2am on 28 January 1547, in the thirty-eighth year of his reign, he took his last breath."|"The King Is Dead"|"Suzannah Lipscomb"
09:00|"nine in the morning"|"Just as with his grandfather Edward Stafford, Duke of Buckingham (in 1521), and later his son Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk (in 1572), Surrey’s display of hubristic conceit in an age of personal monarchy and capital punishment was enough to spell his ruin. Pride, treason – and execution – seemed to run in the family. Surrey’s foolishness now meant not only his own destruction, but that of his father – yet it is hard to feel sorry for the old man. On the day before Surrey’s trial, Norfolk confessed to concealing ‘high treason… most presumptuously committed by my son Henry Howard Earl of Surrey’, thereby dictating the judicial outcome for his son.46 At the trial – a long and public affair on 13 January 1547, which ran from nine in the morning until five at night – Surrey defended himself with wit and courage, but all in vain.47 In fact, in an age when prosecution and the judiciary were one and the same, and where an indictment could create a crime, the result of Surrey’s trial was probably never in doubt: he was found guilty. An Act of Attainder passed through Parliament on 24 January and condemned Surrey and Norfolk to forfeit their lands, chattels, titles, and offices – and lives – to the king.48 This was a mere rubber stamp to secure the Howard lands. On 19 January 1547, Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey had already been beheaded."|"The King Is Dead"|"Suzannah Lipscomb"

"ap ~ 02:00"|"around 2 o’clock"|"Henry VIII may have died at around 2 o’clock on the morning of Saturday 28 January 1547; but for several days, his death was kept a secret.1 Everything carried on as normal. Parliament, which should instantly have dissolved upon the death of the king, remained in session. Food continued to be conveyed with all the usual ceremony and trumpet fanfare to the king’s chambers. Ambassadors were kept in the dark.2 This was not unusual – Henry VII’s death had been concealed in the same way – but it was crucial to the ambitions of two men: it gave Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford and Sir William Paget a chance to lock down power and to implement a hastily conceived plan."|"The King Is Dead"|"Suzannah Lipscomb"
03:00|3am|"Three letters, two from Hertford himself, give us our only clues as to how the process of assuming power was managed between the time of Henry’s death and its public proclamation. The letters demonstrate the way in which Paget and Hertford were carefully controlling the flow of information and managing the unfurling of events. That much business, which no longer survives, was being done – or at least, that Hertford was sleepless and agitated – is also betrayed by his first letter, written between 3am and 4am on Sunday 29th, after receiving an urgent note from Paget between 1am and 2am – just twenty-four hours after Henry’s death. The matter so pressing as to prevent sleep was Henry’s will."|"The King Is Dead"|"Suzannah Lipscomb"

He wrote to the Council discussing the possibility of instantly offering a general royal pardon, which they had raised in their letter, and instructed them to wait until Edward’s coronation so that the new king would benefit from the praise and thanks of the people.11 Hertford was already starting to act as though he were in charge. He noted, in the first time this phrase was used of Edward in the surviving papers, that he intended to have ‘the king’s majesty’ ‘a-horseback tomorrow by xi of the clock’ – 11am – so that by 3pm on 31 January they should be at the Tower of London.12 He also urged the Council to inform Anne of Cleves of the king’s death; we do not know when Henry VIII’s widow, Kateryn Parr, learnt of the news.13"|"The King Is Dead"|"Suzannah Lipscomb"
