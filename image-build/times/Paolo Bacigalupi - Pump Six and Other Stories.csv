04:00|"four a.m."|"It's true, I guess. Sitting next to Alice in the waiting room, I don't feel dizzy or anything, even if I am tired. Last night, she put the dinosaur on the bedside table, right in with her collection of little jeweled music boxes, and the damn thing looked at me all night long. Finally at four a.m. I couldn't stand it anymore and I shoved it under the bed. But in the morning, she found it and put it back, and it's been looking at me ever since."|"Pump Six and Other Stories"|"Paolo Bacigalupi"
03:00|"Three a.m."|"Three a.m. Another call, windows down, howling through the humidity and swelter of Newfoundland. Alice wants me to come home, come back, relax, but I can't. I don't want to. I'm not sure what I want, but it's not brunch with Belgian waffles or screwing on the living room floor or a trip to the movies or . . . anything, really."|"Pump Six and Other Stories"|"Paolo Bacigalupi"
"ap > 03:00"|"After three"|"After the first hour of his work, Tranh's arms are shaking. After three, he can barely stand. He teeters on his creaking ladder as he lowers each new sack, and gasps and shakes his head to clear sweat from his eyes as he waits for the next one to come down."|"Pump Six and Other Stories"|"Paolo Bacigalupi"
00:00|midnight|"""How many times have I told you, that's the first thing you do? How long has it been out?""
""Since midnight?"" He screwed up his face, thinking. ""No, since ten.""
""You switch the flows over?"""|"Pump Six and Other Stories"|"Paolo Bacigalupi"
00:00|midnight|"The night was finally cool, in the sweet spot between end of midnight swelter and beginning of morning smother. There was a blanket of humidity, wet on us, and seductive after the club. Without rain or freezes, I barely had to watch for concrete rain at all."|"Pump Six and Other Stories"|"Paolo Bacigalupi"
05:00|"five in the morning"|"At five in the morning, Chee called again, his voice coming straight into my head through my earbug. In all the excitement and Effy, I'd forgotten to take it out. Pump Six was down again. ""You said I was supposed to call you,"" he whined."|"Pump Six and Other Stories"|"Paolo Bacigalupi"
06:00|"six a.m."|"I just looked at her. Zoned out of her mind at six a.m., romping around with her secretary girlfriend while she tried to crack the whip on the rest of us. Now that's leadership. Suddenly I thought that maybe I needed to get a different job. Or needed to start licking big piles of Effy before I came to work. Anything to take the edge off Suze."|"Pump Six and Other Stories"|"Paolo Bacigalupi"
"> 12:00"|"a little past noon"|"Inside, everything was silence and dust. Big old chandeliers hung down from the ceiling, sparkling with orangey light that filtered in through the dirt on the windows. The light made if feel like it was the end of day with the sun starting to set, even though it was only a little past noon. A heavy blanket of dust covered everything; floors and reading tables and chairs and computers all had a thick gray film over them."|"Pump Six and Other Stories"|"Paolo Bacigalupi"
03:00|"3 a.m."|"I don't have a retort. Dmitri knows me too well to feed him the stories I tell myself, the ones that comfort me at 3 a.m. when Justin's asleep and I'm staring at the ceiling listening to his steady honest breathing: It's for our marriage . . . It's for our future . . . It's for our baby."|"Pump Six and Other Stories"|"Paolo Bacigalupi"
