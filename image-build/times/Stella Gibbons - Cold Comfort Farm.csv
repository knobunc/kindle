Each time she returned she found the empty plates and cups packed neatly outside the closed door. From within there came the steady rise and fall of voices; but though she listened for many minutes she could not distinguish a word; and this disappointing piece of information was all she had to carry back to the eagerly waiting group downstairs."|"Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"At seven o’clock Mr Mybug and Rennett joined the band of watchers, and after waiting until nearly eight o’clock for Flora to come downstairs, they decided that it would be best to begin without her, and made their supper off beef, beer and pickled onions, pleasantly spiced by anxiety and speculation."|"Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"
"ap < 08:00"|"nearly eight o’clock"|"At seven o’clock Mr Mybug and Rennett joined the band of watchers, and after waiting until nearly eight o’clock for Flora to come downstairs, they decided that it would be best to begin without her, and made their supper off beef, beer and pickled onions, pleasantly spiced by anxiety and speculation."|"Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"After supper they settled down once more to watch and wait. Mrs Beetle wondered a dozen times if she should not just run up with a few sandwiches and some cocoa at nine, in order to see whether there were any developments to be observed. But Reuben said no, she was not to; she had been told to take up hot milk at ten o’clock, and hot milk at ten she should take; he would not have Flora’s instructions disobeyed by the tiniest detail. So she stayed where she was."|"Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"After supper they settled down once more to watch and wait.

"ap 10:00"|ten|"They were talking away so hard that they never heard the clock strike ten, and it was not until nearly a quarter past that Mrs Beetle suddenly made them all jump by leaping from her chair and saying loudly: ‘There now! I fergot the milk! I’ll ferget me own name next. I’ll take it up at once.’"|"Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"
"ap 08:30"|"half-past eight"|"At half-past eight everybody sat down to breakfast in the dairy, for the kitchen was being prepared for the reception, and could not be used for meals today."|"Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"So Mrs Beetle ran; but was heard to observe that it would take more than a mess like that to keep her stomach from rumbling before one o’clock. As for the other Starkadders, they were considerably intrigued by this dramatic change in Aunt Ada’s diet."|"Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"
"ap 00:30"|"half-past twelve"|"Breakfast over, they all fell to work like demons, for the ceremony was at half-past twelve and there was much to be done."|"Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"
"ap 10:30"|"half-past ten"|"It was half-past ten. The awning was up, looking immediately festive, as awnings always do. And in the kitchen the two long trestle tables were decorated and ready."|"Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"Flora took a last look round, and was utterly satisfied.
It was eleven o’clock.
She went upstairs to Aunt Ada’s room, knocked at the door, and in response to a crisp: ‘Come in, my dear’, entered and shut the door carefully behind her."|"Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"
"ap 00:30"|twelve-thirty|"‘Did ’ee see that, soul? Ah! there’s somethin’ strange in the air today, love ’ee. And to think on it … our Rennett is no more a maid! Last night, as ever was, ’un came to say goodbye to me before ’un took the twelve-thirty train from Godmere with un’s husband-to-be.’"|"Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"
"ap 11:30"|"half-past eleven"|"A hush now fell upon the cool, flower-garlanded, sweet-smelling farm. The sun climbed royally towards his zenith, and the shadows grew shorter. In a dozen bedrooms the Starkadders struggled with their wedding garments. Flora came out of Aunt Ada’s room exactly at half-past eleven, and went along to her own room."|"Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"
"ap 00:00"|twelve|"The other Starkadders now began to come downstairs; and as the sound of the church clock coming across the sunny fields now warned them it was twelve, they thought it time to go down to the church."|"Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"
"ap 03:30"|three-thirty|"‘Now let’s go back and drink a good deal more,’ suggested Ralph Pent-Hartigan, taking Flora’s hand in a familiar but rather pleasing way. ‘Dick and the sposa will be taking off in half an hour, you know. Their ’plane is timed for three-thirty.’"|"Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"
06:00|"six o’clock that morning"|"One by one the guests departed, and the Starkadders, sleepy with champagne and the novelty of enjoying themselves in a normal manner, slipped away to their bedrooms to sleep it off. The figure of the last guest, Agony Beetle, disappeared over the curve of the hill on the path that led down to Howling, accompanied by the jazz-band. Quiet, which had been driven from the farm at six o’clock that morning, began timidly to creep out of shadowy corners and to take possession of it once more."|"Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"
"ap < 05:00"|"nearly five o’clock"|"‘Oh, yes, just outside. Can you be here by eight, do you think? It’s nearly five o’clock now.’"|"Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"
"ap < 05:00"|"nearly five o’clock"|"‘Oh, yes, just outside. Can you be here by eight, do you think? It’s nearly five o’clock now.’
‘Of course. I’ll be there at eight.’
There was a pause."|"Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"‘Oh, yes, just outside. Can you be here by eight, do you think? It’s nearly five o’clock now.’
‘Of course. I’ll be there at eight.’
There was a pause."|"Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"It was six o’clock when she came slowly downstairs again. The kitchen was tidy and empty. All signs of the feast had been cleared away. Only the awning was left, its stripes of red and white glowing against the deep blue sky of early evening. The shadows of the bean rows were long across the garden, and their flowers were transparent red in the sunlight. All was cool, quiet, blessedly peaceful. Flora’s supper was neatly laid and of the Starkadders there was not a sign. She supposed that they must all be asleep upstairs or else gone a-mollocking off to Godmere. She hoped they would not come downstairs before she left. She loved them all dearly, but this evening she just did not want to see them any more."|"Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"
"ap 06:30"|"half-past six"|"She sat down, with a sigh, in a comfortable deep chair, and relaxed all her limbs. She would sit here, she thought, until half-past six; then she would eat her supper; and then go out into the Big Field and sit on the stile under the may-tree and wait for Charles."|"Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"The Big Field was covered with long, fresh grass which threw millions of tiny lengthening shadows. There was not a breath of wind. It was the loveliest hour of the English year: seven o’clock on Midsummer Night."|"Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"
"ap 07:55"|"five to eight"|"The countryside was falling asleep. Flora drew her coat round her, and looked up into the darkening vault of the sky. Then she glanced at her watch. It was five to eight. Her ears had caught a steady, recurrent murmur that might or might not have been the beating of her own blood."|"Cold Comfort Farm"|"Stella Gibbons"
