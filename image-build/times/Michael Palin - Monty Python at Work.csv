But our mirth was great when we saw a man struggling to stick an ‘Eric Idle’ sign on the back of a picnic chair. Did we really all have chairs with our name on? Yes we really did and, by the end of an eleven-and-a-half-hour day, with only a half-hour break at lunch, I realised that the caravan, the chairs and the ever-helpful production assistants were there to help us work harder, and they were vital.

For the first half of the show there was a vocal majority killing lines, laughs and all attempts at timing.

They started with our signature tune, and there was a roar of recognition from the audience. The lights were very bright, so one couldn’t really see the audience, and it was difficult to judge the laughs, which came as a distant rumble – like the beginning of an avalanche. There seemed to be more people on the stage behind us than the entire audience we usually get at cabarets. I had the feeling that we had a certain interest above those of the other groups because revue has never really been attempted on this scale before. On either side of the stage were 60 x 40-foot Eidiphor4 screens with TV pictures of our faces, and the sound was very good. We tried some new material from the third series – and one of the sketches, the ‘Proust competition’, lay there.

Eric and Mark won a point over the Three-Headed Knight, which is now back in for us to look at. The animation has been cut down (the first time I can remember in all Python history when we have actually chopped any of TG’s stuff). Some of Neil’s music was thought to be not right, so we are putting on a lot of stock music. We have lost more of the ‘Ni’ sequence. There was nearly deadlock over reshooting the very important opening joke with the coconuts. Mark clams up on any mention of reshooting, and TJ rises accordingly."|"Monty Python at Work"|"Michael Palin"

As JC says, though, considering this is the first day of principal photography on a ‘major motion picture’, there’s no sense of occasion, we just get on with it. Terry J hops about in a businesslike way, and doesn’t exude any of the egomania of the Great Director.

Their presence had set a very different pace to this last week. On Saturday, Tom [aged ten] decided he would like to appear in the afternoon’s filming, so he was supplied with a long robe and turban and looked very handsome. He was the only one of the Python children to have a go but was very proud of himself.

We chat for a half-hour, but I take a while to settle, having been far more rattled than I should have been by EI’s outburst over our Tom Snyder Tomorrow show interview. Eric, who has become far more obsessed with the interviews than I would have expected from such a press-hater, berates me for mentioning the Gay News blasphemy case and the Jorgen Therson Sex Life of Christ in the same breath as Brian."|"Monty Python at Work"|"Michael Palin"

He seems, as usual, not quite in tune with what’s going on around him. I record the Headmaster’s speech and that’s about all."|"Monty Python at Work"|"Michael Palin"
"ap 02:00"|two|"To Denis O’B for a meeting at two. For the first time we are being offered the prospect of quite considerable financial rewards. At the moment he seems to have admirable goals, but I have this nagging feeling that our ‘freedom’ to do whatever we want may be threatened if Denis is able to build up this juggernaut of Python earning power and influence. A few of the most interesting projects may be rolled flat."|"Monty Python at Work"|"Michael Palin"
"ap 03:00"|three|"Coffees are poured and we settle round JC’s ex-prison table, which now seems to be Python’s favourite writing venue. No one wants to spend time on business, we all want to write and make each other laugh, but business has to be done, so it’s decided that we will make a clean sweep of it today. So Anne stays with us, and Denis is summoned at three."|"Monty Python at Work"|"Michael Palin"

"ap ~ 10:00"|"about ten o’clock"|"At about ten o’clock we start interviews in our room, followed by a press conference downstairs, after which we are to give a TV interview. The Danes and Swedes both find the Norwegians a Scandinavian joke – slow-witted, thick-headed, humourless fishing folk – and they send them up unmercifully. The fact that Python’s Life of Brian has been banned in Norway causes our hosts great glee and the Swedes have a poster tagging the film ‘So Funny it was Banned in Norway’."|"Monty Python at Work"|"Michael Palin"
