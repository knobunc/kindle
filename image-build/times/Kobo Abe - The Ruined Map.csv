"> 22:00"|"after ten in the evening"|"I went past a movie theater and turned down an alleyway. Dark depressions, ripped asphalt, uneven walls crowded against expectant faces. But the commotion was illusory, and what I saw was in reality only a man, squatting in the shadow of a telephone pole plastered with advertisements. Hastily I finished urinating and with a blank expressionless face pushed open the left-hand side of the great double doors leading into a brightly lit saké cafeteria on the next corner. I was surprised at how late it was. I had an unpleasant feeling of quiet, for there was less than half of the usual number of customers. At the cashier’s box by the entrance I changed four hundred-yen coins into ten-yen pieces. Against the back wall, side by side, stood white rectangular boxes bordered in vermilion—eight in all—which, had brand names not been painted on them, would have looked for all the world like pumps in a gas station. Slipping between the long, narrow tables, which were arranged in five parallel rows, I at once placed myself in front of the machine on the far right, which happened to be free. A characteristic pungent smell. The city stench of foul water backing up when, after ten in the evening, the flushing of sewage suddenly slackened. I inserted a ten-yen coin into the brass-framed opening beneath the red arrow on the right of the machine. With every succeeding coin a piano wire resounded, and at the eighth a red bulb flashed on. I shoved the paper cup provided for the purpose into place and when I pulled on the stainless-steel lever, precisely 4.0 ounces of a slightly overheated amber liquid spurted out. I cradled the cup in my two hands lest the warmth escape, downing in a swallow about a third of the drink. Then I drank the rest in five or so gulps as I shifted to the machine bearing my preferred brand name."|"The Ruined Map"|"Kobo Abe"
"ap 08:00"|"eight-o’clock"|"There was already a customer standing at my machine. Under his faded dark-blue work clothes he wore a gaudy muffler, into which was knitted a design. He wore no overcoat. He was well built and thick-set. Black oil had collected underneath the nails of the hand holding the paper cup; perhaps he was a boilerman from a nearby building. Most of the eight-o’clock customers were white-collar workers, but after that hour, the type abruptly changed. As the fellow made place for me, he looked over his shoulder and remarked: “Hey! If we pissed in dribbles like that, we’d be diabetics.” He put the tip of his tongue between his gaping front teeth. He seemed to be drunk already, and as he swayed, his center of gravity shifted back and forth between his heels and his toes, but unfortunately there were no chairs in the place. Noisily sipping at his paper cup, he kept steadily observing my hands. “Hey, you like this saké too. What about that!” Then lowering his voice: “Come on, lend me ten yen. I’m a regular customer here. I’m not trying to get away with anything. If you think I’m lying I’ll sign an I.O.U. Just ten yen. You can’t be crooked here.”"|"The Ruined Map"|"Kobo Abe"

The whole west side, separated by the street, is the third ward of F—— City. In F—— Village which appears on my map (published in a previous year) there is no such division into wards, and the relative position of the streets appears to be quite different. When I inquired I found that they had decided to build near here an interchange for the turnpike at present under construction, that there was a lively buying and selling of land and subdividing into house lots, that the municipal cooperative movement was bearing fruit and was being extended to the present F—— City. So the place was crawling with heavy trucks filled with dirt."|"The Ruined Map"|"Kobo Abe"

Like a withering flower photographed at high speed, her two eyes hollowed as I watched her, her nose constricted, and even the color of her soft skin lost its vitality like an old chamois skin. I was beginning to feel a deep remorse for what I had said. Those to whom murder is legal are only executioners and soldiers on the battlefield; doctors have no right to practice euthanasia no matter how much they are badgered by the patient.

No, it was not only this moment; I had practically no hope of anything to report on, even after an hour, three hours, or ten hours. Harassed by these thoughts, I downed the remaining coffee and rose. But what should I do? Was there something to be done? Again I stood there indecisively … just standing, like the girl I had left behind at the foot of the library steps. Being dragged around in the dark, deprived of freedom, ignorant of one’s whereabouts or objective, was vexing enough, but suddenly being picked up on the street with neither explanation nor excuse was really insulting treatment."|"The Ruined Map"|"Kobo Abe"

For an instant, I suspected he might have already heard about the death, but apparently not. As soon as I recalled to him his promise to have a drink with me, his tone changed to one of friendliness and intimacy—perhaps he had little experience in sharing confidences like this with strangers. I stared at the thick line of hair behind the girl’s ears. “Let’s meet at S—– station … where you drew the map for me yesterday … hmm, the spot where you were supposed to meet Mr. Nemuro.… I’d just like to check it out. Let’s say seven o’clock, all right? Then, most important, I’d like you not to forget to bring along the … uh … those special nude shots.” The girl hastily brought the radio to her ear, but there was no sign that she had turned it on. “After I’ve thoroughly gone over the nudes again, I’d like, if possible, to interview the model as soon as I can.…” Of course she could not hear the suddenly businesslike answers, so my exchange sounded quite meaningless. Then I lowered my voice and added—no, rather than an addition it was probably my real purpose: “Another thing I’d like you to think about: how would you go about blackmailing a fuel supplier? An ordinary fuel supply place … hmm … a retailer. I’d like your advice. What kind of blackmail is there? Think about it till we meet.”"|"The Ruined Map"|"Kobo Abe"
"~ 07:00"|"about seven in the morning"|"The old man’s troubled gaze, like a cornered mouse running around trying to find its hole, shifted in a triangle formed by me, the black window of the Camellia, and the burned spot in the blanket over his knees. He gave a short cough, plunged his hands under the blanket and then immediately withdrew them and rubbed them together. Resignedly, he wiped away the secretion from the corners of his eyes with the same finger he had used to wipe the dribble of his nose, and clicking his tongue, said: “Well then, please yourself. Try driving around here about seven in the morning.”"|"The Ruined Map"|"Kobo Abe"

Toyama was not at home, but I was told that he was expected for lunch, being under treatment for a stomach disorder. I decided to ask if I might not wait for him a while. Toyama’s house was not number 24, as my client had told me, but 42, and therefore it took me some time and pains to find it. Even so, I was obliged to wait. The silver lining to my cloud was that at least I reduced the waiting time."|"The Ruined Map"|"Kobo Abe"

The motor sputtered, making a sound like a piece of wire thrust into the blades of a fan; the tires screeched like adhesive tape being torn away. I was immersed to my very core in noise, but I heard nothing; it was as if I were in a great silence. All I could see was the concrete road running straight to the sky. No, it was not a road, it was a band of flowing time. I was not seeing but only feeling time."|"The Ruined Map"|"Kobo Abe"
"> 12:00"|"after noon"|"However, my expectations were disappointed. A rude interruption of the role I was deliberately playing. It was the chief. Another tedious lecture. Why did he always have to start all over again from lesson one? Because an investigator was no more than a drain cleaner, that was why. He crawls around in the midst of filth, unexposed to light.—“I want you detectives to be far more careful about cleanliness and pay attention to your health.” I realized, without being told, the chief’s perplexity when without contacting him I broke my promise to put in an appearance at the office after noon. Although he was most considerate and thoughtful of others he demanded the strictness of an ascetic in matters of self-defense and the cash register, but only in these areas. My thoughts about a chief like this were never unhappy ones. I rather admired his professional conscientiousness when I reflected that many people put up a pretense of evil and hypocrisy as temporary painkillers.—“You had better watch out. As far as your client’s brother’s concerned, it’s a case of murder. It’s preposterous. May I remind you again, if you get involved in a police case without consulting first with me, from that instant on you’re going to have nothing more to do with this office. It sounds unfeeling, but I can’t do anything about it. It’s company policy. You get in trouble if you force a man to stay here who doesn’t really fit in.” I did not usually find this tone unpleasant. On the contrary, it usually made a favorable impression on me. But today for some reason it was without effect. My client came back at just the right point in the conversation. Moreover, she had, in the meantime, changed from her mourning clothes into an ordinary dress—extremely rapidly, I thought. Apparently I no longer had to fear being plagued by the stench of death. It was a dress of black crepe that loosely molded her body. I wondered if she remembered that I had said black became her. She tilted her head to one side. I shook my own from left to right, indicating with my free hand that the call was for me. She circled the table and sat down immediately in front of me. At the closest point we were about eight inches apart. Her hair was long, the peculiar waves equally divided between shallow and full ones. The curve of her shoulders would fit in the hollow of my hand, were I to place it on them. Without realizing it, I laughed, interrupting the chief’s words.—“Thanks for the enjoyable scolding. These days I’ve been doing nothing but walking around and looking for someone. It’s not at all unpleasant to have someone looking for me.” No, it was not a lie. But after saying that, I realized rather sentimentally that my words were those I might have used to my own wife rather than to my chief. Any number of times I had visited my wife and had got in touch with her, but when I thought about it she had not once contacted me. Perhaps it wasn’t right. The fact that I didn’t have the courage to wait in silence until she sought me out may have eroded our relationship."|"The Ruined Map"|"Kobo Abe"

"ap < 05:00"|"a few minutes before five o’clock"|"In the little apartment room that I used only as sleeping quarters and where I lived my unaccustomed solitary life, the night was as slow in falling as the day was in rising. I set the hands of my alarm clock at a few minutes before five o’clock, wound it up, and placed it just out of reach on the window ledge; I turned on the radio to drown out the sounds from the mah-jong players on the second floor and crawled into my cool bed, which because of the whisky I had spilled began to stink more than I did myself. From among the nude photos I had taken from Tashiro, I chose one which, though not characteristic, best showed the woman’s femaleness and placed it side by side with the picture of the husband on the table by the bed. As I sipped my whisky straight from a small bottle I concentrated intensely on the relationship between the two photos. The somewhat elongated face of the man, suggestive of an enthusiastic type, was slightly asymmetrical. The surface of the face seemed rough, perhaps due to the splotches of color and not to the roughness of the skin … evidently a type given to allergies. The right eye was strong and gave a feeling of willfulness, but the left one drooped at the corner, and had a conspicuous sag in the lid, giving a kind of sorrowful, doglike expression. The long, thin nose was bent slightly to the left. The lips joined in an almost straight line, as if drawn by a ruler. The upper lip was thin and nervous, but the lower was heavy and calm. To the left of the mouth were some hairs skipped by the razor. The main impression I had had up to now was of a businessman’s temperament, but tonight—perhaps it was my own fancy—the face had taken on the cast of a visionary. I felt no hostility or resistance, but I could not believe that a real man would materialize and speak to me. The face was one that was best suited to the present pose, as if he had been born as an image on a piece of negative paper. A blurred line of light ran diagonally across the background, perhaps a part of a building gleaming in soft beams of sunlight, or an elevated toll road."|"The Ruined Map"|"Kobo Abe"

Though uneconomical, I had had it installed, thinking it would be of some use for my business. I was almost never at home, but on the rare occasions I overslept I could call in at the office. There had not been a single incoming call in over a fortnight. I wondered, indeed, whether I should not get rid of it. The bell rang a third time. It was unbelievable. Maybe a wrong number. No, maybe it was her. Some unforeseen happening that had made the curtain turn a lemon-yellow again. Or was it my wife?

The street was light enough for me to be able to make out the five-inch-spaced grooves, yet not light enough to cast shadows. On the protective wall to the left—doubtless due to its material—the moss, mottled with dampness, was rapidly absorbing the darkness, changing the surface into a mass of shadow. At the top of the wall a vague, weathered line diagonally blocked my view; only there was the sky suddenly bright. It was, of course, impossible for me to see what lay beyond, but, if I remembered rightly, there were only three small wooden houses and a building surrounded by clumps of trees that seemed to be an inn or a lodging house, forming a cluster half way up the slope. Another road led away from the foot of the slope, and as I had seldom been there it was not surprising that my memories of it were somewhat hazy. I wanted to pin my hopes on the fact that such contours of memory, vague as they might be, had been preserved. If the scene before my eyes was not opening up some avenue to the past, such memories would never have arisen. Actually, if I was imagining I recognized a completely unknown place, shouldn’t all the worlds outside my vision completely disappear?

But I was confident that I could faithfully follow in my memory the entire stretch of road that led to the public bath at the end, in the middle of the labyrinth. The street that the old men, smoking their cigarettes, sitting in front of the bath, waiting to be first in, used to like to walk down … the street where after three o’clock, women would hurry along, wash basins in hand.
