00:00|Midnight|"It was Christmas Eve. There had been snow, then a dripping thaw that had filled the river, followed by a sudden hard frost. The trees dangled with icicles that tinkled like Japanese bells. The eaves were jagged with ice daggers. The ground was hard like glazed rock, the moat frozen. Toby and Alexander, with their mother, had gone on foot to Midnight Mass at the big church in Penny Soaky across the river. The little church in this village belonged to what Linnet called the preachies, who did not celebrate Midnight Mass. The family had gone on foot because the road was too slippery for horses, the ruts too hard for a coach. Linnet could not walk so far, so she was put to bed and the grandmother sat downstairs alone. Linnet took Orlando, her little black and white curly dog, to bed with her."|"The Children of Green Knowe Collection"|"L. M. Boston"
00:00|Midnight|"Out into the moonlight came St Christopher himself, huge and gentle and with his head among the stars, taking the stone Child on his shoulders to Midnight Mass. As they went past, Orlando lifted his chin and gave a little cry, and from the stables came a quiet whinny. All the birds in the spruce tree woke up and flew out of the window, circling round St Christopher with excited calls. The stone giant strode across the lawns with his bare feet and soon came to the river. At the edge there was thin, loose ice that shivered like a window-pane as he stepped in. The water rushed round his legs and the reflection of the moon was torn to wet ribbons. The stream crept up to his waist and, as he still went on, to his armpits. When it looked as if he could go no farther Linnet heard a child’s voice singing gaily. The sound was torn and scattered by the wind as the moon’s reflection had been by the water, but she recognized the song as it came in snatches."|"The Children of Green Knowe Collection"|"L. M. Boston"
00:00|midnight|"When St Christopher was out of sight Linnet realized that it was cold. She also remembered that she had got into bed without saying her prayers. She said them now, and Orlando lay on her feet and kept them warm till she had finished. Then she got into bed again and before long the bells rang out for midnight, and it was Christmas morning. When the boys came back she told them what she had seen. Alexander said he too had seen St Christopher kneeling among the tombstones outside the church in the shadow of a big cypress tree. He thought nobody else had noticed."|"The Children of Green Knowe Collection"|"L. M. Boston"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"‘That means I can’t take you, Tolly. What a shame. But we will go together another time. Boggis will have to look after you. Please thank her, Boggis, and say I will be ready at eleven. What are those papers?’"|"The Children of Green Knowe Collection"|"L. M. Boston"
00:00|Midnight|"‘I shall take you to Midnight Mass tomorrow, if you would like to come – and if the weather is possible. It is a long walk. Do you know, I thought I heard thunder a minute ago? Who ever heard of thunder at Christmas?’"|"The Children of Green Knowe Collection"|"L. M. Boston"
00:00|Midnight|"Tolly was far too excited to think of going to bed. His head was in a whirl, thinking of the Christmas tree, of the live partridge that should arrive tomorrow, of his present for his great-grandmother, of the probability that there would be some sort of a present for him, of the cradle song in Mrs Oldknow’s room, of the children, of the loveliness of everything. The only thing he never thought of was something he had done himself that morning. Now he was trying to contrive ways of staying up longer. Asking questions seemed the easiest way.
‘Shall we go to Midnight Mass if it snows?’
‘I believe it is thunder,’ said Mrs Oldknow. ‘Open the door, Tolly, and listen.’ Tolly opened the door into the garden. It was a dark evening with tattered clouds in front of a slatey sky. He heard no thunder. It was even unnaturally quiet. Perhaps it only seemed unnatural because he himself was brimming with excitement. He heard the weir pounding at the end of the garden. It only made the quietness quieter. It was rather like a heart that is only heard when it beats too loud. Tolly wondered how loud Feste’s heart would sound if you put your head against his ribs after a gallop."|"The Children of Green Knowe Collection"|"L. M. Boston"
00:00|Midnight|"THAT NIGHT THERE was neither thunder nor snow, but a bright moon and keen frost. Before starting to walk to Midnight Mass with Mrs Oldknow, Tolly had been privately to look at St Christopher. The moon shone full on his weathered stone face. He looked as if he had not moved since the beginning of time. As they set off with their moon shadows playing on the path round their feet, Tolly wondered if Linnet was looking out of the top window."|"The Children of Green Knowe Collection"|"L. M. Boston"
00:00|MIDNIGHT|"AT MIDNIGHT, WHEN Ida woke the two boys, a dusty curtained blackness filled the house, and the cold windowpanes were all that separated them from the void outside. They put on their warmest clothes and crept silently downstairs. Although nobody had told them they were not to go out at midnight, they knew enough of grown-ups to expect to be sent back to bed if they were caught. Creaking floors and old obstinate doors and steep uncarpeted stairs had to be passed, the flashlight travelling from banister to banister till they were down on the brick floor of the hall, where all the scents of the day before were settling as mud settles in still water."|"The Children of Green Knowe Collection"|"L. M. Boston"
12:00|midday|"It was very hot. The midday siesta was on. The birds had vanished, the butterflies lay with wide-open wings fearing no attack. The harvest mice went in to sleep. Smaller things crept under leaves. Ida and Ping were drowsy too. Looking at tiny things closely for a long time makes one sleepy. They lay back in the grass and snoozed."|"The Children of Green Knowe Collection"|"L. M. Boston"
12:00|noon|"Ida looked towards the windmill. She had been facing it all the time, but had been more interested in what was round her – water rats swimming in search of land, earwigs troubled at finding themselves afloat on sticks. Now she searched the hillock where the windmill stood for something unusual. She saw nothing except a dead tree lying uprooted near the water’s edge. Its roots had been broken off, all but two which were bent back under one of those fuzzy knobs that the boles of elm trees often have, which, if the tree had been a piece of sculpture, would have been the head of a reclining figure. There were only two branches left, and they were crossed one over the other like legs. Quite an ordinary thing to see, really. Only while she was looking at it the branches moved and crossed the other leg over. And the foot swung contentedly in the lazy noon air."|"The Children of Green Knowe Collection"|"L. M. Boston"
"ap ~ 00:00"|"about twelve o’clock"|"‘I suppose you’re the lot we’re looking for,’ one of them said as they drew nearer. ‘Three kids in a canoe who shot under the bridge at Wigglesoke at about twelve o’clock? We’re the search party,’ he added with a grin. ‘Lucky you didn’t get out into the Wash. Tide’s running out strongly there. What a trio of innocents! Didn’t you know any better than that? However, it looks as though we shan’t need you, Doctor,’ he said to his companion. ‘Unless it’s to certify them as idiots. Come on now. We’ll give you a lift home and tow the canoe. Where do you come from?’"|"The Children of Green Knowe Collection"|"L. M. Boston"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"They took a much longer route because the launch could not pass under the stone bridge at Wigglesoke. When they arrived home Miss Sybilla was certainly flustered, but it was difficult to tell whether it was because it had been given out on the one o’clock news that three children were at large on the flood, or whether it was because for some reason the cream would not whip up. Maud Biggin was not upset at all."|"The Children of Green Knowe Collection"|"L. M. Boston"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"They calculated that the moon should rise at eleven and might be over the house by midnight. There was a light in Maud Biggin’s room when the children crept out. ‘She’s still thinking about the tooth. She won’t hear us.’"|"The Children of Green Knowe Collection"|"L. M. Boston"

00:00|midnight|"The hunters streamed by the children, almost jostling them, but as the leaders had passed them unnoticed, so did all the rest, like a herd of animals. They boarded canoes that from the sound of it were hidden in the rushes near at hand. Their rapid paddle strokes drove through the water, where the moorhens fled with loud midnight cries, and the wild duck wheeled into flight with half-breathed clucks of alarm."|"The Children of Green Knowe Collection"|"L. M. Boston"
00:00|midnight|"The children cautiously parted the leaves and crept out from their hiding-place. They looked down the river hoping to see the craft with its standing crew. But the moon had now met the shoal of cloud and passed behind it, so that from one moment to the next everything became dim and shadowy. A cold shudder of wind blew on the backs of their necks and ears, and rustled the balancing surface of blade and leaf along the river’s edge and across the wide meadows. They were standing at midnight, alone, under a sky that was there before either earth or moon had been, and would be there long after. In this agonizing second of revelation that all passes, the bark of a disturbed heron caused them to clutch each other, and jerked loose their tongues."|"The Children of Green Knowe Collection"|"L. M. Boston"
