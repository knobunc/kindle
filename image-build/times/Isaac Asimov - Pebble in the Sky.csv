"> 12:00"|"past noon"|"When Schwartz opened his eyes, it was past noon. He felt that dull, heart-choking pain that feeds on itself, the pain of a wife no longer by his side at waking, of a familiar world lost . . ."|"Pebble in the Sky"|"Isaac Asimov"
"< 00:00"|"Before midnight"|"Before midnight the Procurator had quietly left the gathering and, with a bare word to his wife only, departed in his private cruiser on the two-hour trip to the city of Chica, with the slight frown still on his forehead and a raging anxiety in his heart."|"Pebble in the Sky"|"Isaac Asimov"
"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"There remained yet several hours, during which a library of recordings were taken, to an undertone of almost wild excitement. It was well past midnight when the hypodermic was pressed home and the sleeper’s eyes fluttered."|"Pebble in the Sky"|"Isaac Asimov"
22:00|"ten in the evening"|"But it was submission. Shekt said, “I’m not asking you for your name. Come a week from today at ten in the evening. I’ll be waiting for you at the door of the garage, the one we took in your biwheel at. You must believe me, man; you have nothing to fear.”"|"Pebble in the Sky"|"Isaac Asimov"
"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"It was past midnight before Shekt thought of retiring, and then only because the troubled Pola insisted. Even then he did not sleep. His pillow was a subtle smothering device, his sheets a pair of maddening snarls. He arose and took his seat by the window. The city was dark now, but there on the horizon, on the side opposite the lake, was the faint trace of that blue glow of death that held sway over all but a few patches of Earth."|"Pebble in the Sky"|"Isaac Asimov"
11:00|"11 a.m."|"But this Outsider, that was different. He surveyed the item with a feeling of pleasure: “Bel Arvardan, Baronn, Sirius Sector—curious about the Sixty—secretive about own affairs—entered Chica by commercial plane 11 a.m. Chica time, 12 October—anti-Terrestrian attitude very marked.”"|"Pebble in the Sky"|"Isaac Asimov"
"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"They had left the dark garrison walls behind them. It had been a short and silent ten-minute air-taxi ride to the city proper, and now they stood at the deserted blackness of the Institute. It was past midnight."|"Pebble in the Sky"|"Isaac Asimov"
"ap 04:30"|four-thirty|"It was growing dark, and the wind had a dying chill to it. As usual, it didn’t seem right. Schwartz judged it to be December, and certainly sunset at four-thirty was right for it, but the wind’s chill was not the iciness of a midwestern winter."|"Pebble in the Sky"|"Isaac Asimov"
20:00|"eight this evening"|"“Ask your way to the Great Playhouse at eight this evening. Make sure you are not followed.”"|"Pebble in the Sky"|"Isaac Asimov"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"At eight o’clock he was making his slow way as part of a long line of ground cars along the serpentine way that apparently led to the Great Playhouse. He had asked only once, and the passerby questioned had stared suspiciously at him (apparently no Earthman was ever free of that all-pervasive suspicion) and had said curtly, “You just follow all the rest of the cars.”"|"Pebble in the Sky"|"Isaac Asimov"
"ap > 10:00"|"after ten"|"Her cheeks were pink with earnestness, and Arvardan longed to touch them. (Had he ever before touched her and felt horrified at it? What was happening to him?)
“Is it after ten?” asked Pola.
“Yes,” he replied."|"Pebble in the Sky"|"Isaac Asimov"
00:00|midnight|"It was close upon midnight. The day had been long and much had happened. But now something stirred within Arvardan. He said tightly, “I wish you’d get to the point.”"|"Pebble in the Sky"|"Isaac Asimov"
"ap 03:00"|three|"“Do you realize,” said Shekt in feeble wonder, “that he has a vermiform appendix, which is three and a half inches long? Do you remember, Pola? And wisdom teeth. And hair on his face.”"|"Pebble in the Sky"|"Isaac Asimov"
06:00|"six in the morning"|"Schwartz said, “I didn’t. I wasn’t looking for it, and it passed my notice. . . . But I can look for it now. Two days—Less—Let’s see—Tuesday—six in the morning—Chica time.”"|"Pebble in the Sky"|"Isaac Asimov"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"And she could only shake her head and say, “There’s not enough time. We only have till six o’clock Tuesday.”"|"Pebble in the Sky"|"Isaac Asimov"
12:00|noon|"It was at noon that the High Minister at Washenn inquired via Communi-wave after his Secretary, and a search for the latter failed. The High Minister was displeased; the minor officials at the Hall of Correction were perturbed."|"Pebble in the Sky"|"Isaac Asimov"
10:30|"ten-thirty in the morning"|"Questioning followed, and the guards outside the assembly room were definite that the Secretary had left with the prisoners at ten-thirty in the morning. . . . No, he had left no instructions. They could not say where he was going; it was, of course, not their place to ask."|"Pebble in the Sky"|"Isaac Asimov"
14:00|"2 p.m."|"At 2 p.m. the first report arrived that the Secretary’s ground car had been seen that morning—no one had seen if the Secretary was within—some thought he had been driving, but had only assumed it, it turned out—"|"Pebble in the Sky"|"Isaac Asimov"
"ap 02:30"|two-thirty|"By two-thirty it had been ascertained that the car had entered Fort Dibburn."|"Pebble in the Sky"|"Isaac Asimov"
18:00|"6 p.m."|"The professional demagogues were on the street corners. The secret arsenals were broken open and the hands that reached withdrew with weapons. There was a twisting drift toward the fort, and at 6 p.m. a new message was sent to the commandant, this time by personal envoy."|"Pebble in the Sky"|"Isaac Asimov"
"ap 05:15"|five-fifteen|"Lieutenant Claudy laughed and put his blaster away. “It’s too bad I have to save you for the colonel. He’s to see you at five-fifteen.”"|"Pebble in the Sky"|"Isaac Asimov"

06:00|"six in the morning"|"Arvardan interrupted by striking his fist on the arm of his chair and roaring, “Is this a law court? Has someone been guilty of violating a traffic ordinance? We have no time to weigh evidence on an analytical balance or measure it with micrometers. I tell you we have till six in the morning, five and a half hours, in other words, to wipe out this enormous threat. . . . You knew Dr. Shekt previous to this time, Your Excellency. Have you known him to be a liar?”"|"Pebble in the Sky"|"Isaac Asimov"
06:00|"six in the morning"|"The Secretary said, “So we are reduced to the screams of a hysterical girl. . . . Your Excellency, I have this proposition. My accusers say that all this, the alleged virus and whatever else they have in mind, is scheduled for a definite time—six in the morning, I believe. I offer to remain in your custody for a week. If what they say is true, word of an epidemic in the Galaxy ought to reach Earth within a few days. If such occurs, Imperial forces will still control Earth—”"|"Pebble in the Sky"|"Isaac Asimov"

“It’s past seven,” she whispered. “Past the deadline.”
He looked about wildly, starting from the cot on which he lay, disregarding the burning in his joints. Shekt, his lean figure huddled in a chair, raised his head to nod in brief mournfulness."|"Pebble in the Sky"|"Isaac Asimov"
"ap > 06:00"|"after six o’clock"|"“It is after six o’clock.” Ennius had not slept that night. With his official absolution of Balkis had come no absolute assurance that the accusers were completely mad—or under mental control.

03:00|"three in the morning"|"“In my time,” said Schwartz, “there was a city called St. Louis. It was at the junction of two great rivers. . . . We found Senloo. It was night, but there was a dark patch in a sea of radioactivity—and Dr. Shekt had said the Temple was an isolated oasis of normal soil. We dropped a flare—at least it was my mental suggestion—and there was a five-pointed building below us. It jibed with the picture I had received in the Secretary’s mind. . . . Now there’s only a hole, a hundred feet deep, where that building was. That happened at three in the morning. No virus was sent out and the universe is free.”"|"Pebble in the Sky"|"Isaac Asimov"
"ap 06:00"|six|"“I never touched him,” said Schwartz softly. Then, staring thoughtfully at the fallen figure, “I was back before six, but I knew I would have to wait for the deadline to pass. Balkis would have to crow. I knew that from his mind, and it was from his own mouth, only, that I could convict him. . . . Now there he lies.”"|"Pebble in the Sky"|"Isaac Asimov"
