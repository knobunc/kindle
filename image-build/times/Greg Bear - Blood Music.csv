"ap 11:00"|eleven|"The spaces between his toes seemed alive with invisible ants. He hadn’t felt so miserable since he had had chicken pox at eleven, a month before his father’s departure. With the unspeculating concentration of misery, Vergil stripped off his pajamas and crawled into the shower, hoping for relief under cold water."|"Blood Music"|"Greg Bear"
22:00|"ten P.M."|"Vergil returned at ten P.M. and met Edward at the appointed place, on the third floor of what the nurses called the Frankenstein Wing. Edward sat on an orange plastic chair, reading a desk copy of My Things magazine. Vergil entered the small lobby, looking lost and worried. His skin was olive-colored under the fluorescent lighting."|"Blood Music"|"Greg Bear"
01:00|"one o’clock in the morning"|"It was one o’clock in the morning when Vergil walked out of the examination room. The samples had been taken. In the main lobby, Vergil shook hands with Edward. Vergil’s palm was damp, nervous. “Be careful with the specimens,” he said. “Don’t ingest anything.”"|"Blood Music"|"Greg Bear"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"Edward watched Vergil cross the parking lot and get into his Volvo. Then he turned slowly and went back to the Frankenstein Wing. He poured a cc of Vergil’s blood into an ampoule, and several cc’s of urine into another, inserting both into the hospital’s tissue, specimen and serum analyzer. He would have the results in the morning, available on his office VDT. The stool sample would require manual work, but that could wait; right now he felt like one of the undead. It was two o’clock."|"Blood Music"|"Greg Bear"
06:30|"6:30 A.M."|"Edward shaved with an old straight razor kept in his desk drawer for just such emergencies, examined himself in the mirror of the doctor’s dressing room and rubbed his cheek critically. He had used the straight razor regularly in his student years, an affectation; since then the occasions had been seldom and his face showed it: three nicks patched with tissue paper and styptic pencil. He glanced at his watch. The batteries were running low and the display was dim. He shook it angrily and the display became crystal-clear: 6:30 A.M. Gail would be up and about, preparing for school."|"Blood Music"|"Greg Bear"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"“You were still at the hospital. Of course. Your shift is at eight today?”"|"Blood Music"|"Greg Bear"
"ap 05:30"|five-thirty|"“Got to go. Six?”
“Maybe five-thirty.”
“I’ll still be critiquing videos.”"|"Blood Music"|"Greg Bear"
09:00|"nine in the morning"|"He stood in the empty lobby for a few minutes, trying to control his erratic breathing. He glanced at his watch: nine in the morning."|"Blood Music"|"Greg Bear"
"ap 09:00"|"Nine o’clock"|"Edward thought of driving up and back, of time lost and of Gail, worrying. It all seemed trivial. “Yes,” he said.
“Nine o’clock, at Genetron. 60895 North Torrey Pines Road.”
“Fine.”"|"Blood Music"|"Greg Bear"
"ap 04:30"|Four-thirty|"“I just got home.”
“Four-thirty. Christ. Have I been asleep?”
“I wasn’t here,” Gail said. “Have you?”"|"Blood Music"|"Greg Bear"
00:00|midnight|"When Vergil had entered the Mount Freedom Medical Center. This was another of Vergil’s jokes. Ha. Turn your whole life deep midnight blue, Edward; never forget a friend."|"Blood Music"|"Greg Bear"
"ap > 10:00"|"past ten o’clock"|"She didn’t keep clocks in her room but the sun outside the window was high enough for it to be past ten o’clock. The bedroom doors were closed. “Mother?” She knocked on the door of her mother’s room. No answer."|"Blood Music"|"Greg Bear"
"ap 10:30"|"Ten thirty"|"“Hey,” she called out from the living room, confused and unhappy. “Nobody woke me up. I’ll be late for work.” She was in her third week of waitressing at a neighborhood deli. She enjoyed the work—it was much more interesting and real than working at the Salvation Army thrift store—and it helped her mother financially. Her mother had lost her job three months before and lived on the irregular checks from Suzy’s father, plus their rapidly diminishing savings. She looked at the Benrus ship’s clock on the table and shook her head. Ten thirty; she was really late. But that didn’t worry her as much as where everybody had gone. They fought a lot, sure, but they were a close family—except for her father, whom she hardly missed any more, not much anyway—and everybody wouldn’t just go away and not tell her, not even wake her up."|"Blood Music"|"Greg Bear"
08:00|"eight in the morning"|"The street was deserted. Parked cars lined both sides—inexplicably, for parking was forbidden between eight in the morning and six at night every day but Thursday and Friday, and this was Tuesday, and the enforcement was strict. Nobody was driving. She couldn’t see anybody in a car or walking or sitting in a window. She ran up one side of the street, weeping and shouting first in supplication, then in anger, then terror, then again begging for help."|"Blood Music"|"Greg Bear"

13:00|"one o’clock in the afternoon"|"It was one o’clock in the afternoon, the ship’s clock said. She regained her breath and then went around the house, turning off the lights. The miraculous energy might last longer if she didn’t use it up immediately."|"Blood Music"|"Greg Bear"
"ap 05:30"|"five thirty"|"He pulled away the scratched black enamel binoculars and wiped fatigue and sweat from his eyes with a red bandana. Then he continued his peering. He was surveying the broad spread of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, and the Sandia Labs across the road. The smell of dried grass and dust made him want to blow his nose, leave, pack up . . . and go nowhere because that was exactly the only place he had left to go. It was five thirty and dusk was coming on. “Wave your flag, Jerry,” he murmured, “you sonofabitch.”"|"Blood Music"|"Greg Bear"
08:30|"eight thirty in the morning"|"She began her climb at eight thirty in the morning. It was best, she thought, to climb steadily ten floors and then rest, or explore and see what was visible from that level. That way, she might reach the top by the end of the day."|"Blood Music"|"Greg Bear"
15:00|"three P.M."|"At three P.M., Paulsen-Fuchs arrived with his elaborations of the news reports Bernard had read or seen earlier that morning. The news was invariably bad and getting worse. The Soviet Union, like an untamed horse set loose, had now left Europe panicked and bristling with helpless rage. It had then retreated into sullen silence, which reassured no one. Bernard thought briefly of these problems, then asked Paulsen-Fuchs what progress there was on controlling the intelligent cells."|"Blood Music"|"Greg Bear"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"“Martians,” John said. That was his last protest to April’s claim of knowing what had really happened. He said very little after that, until they started the climb up the Grapevine, past the unconverted trees and buildings of Fort Tejon and the vague outlines of tiny Gorman. As they neared the ridge, he stared at Jerry with wide eyes, pupils dilated, and said, “City of Angels, coming up.”
It was five o’clock, early evening and getting dark.
The air over Los Angeles was as purple as raw meat."|"Blood Music"|"Greg Bear"
12:00|noon|"At noon, Bernard’s lunch was delivered through the small hatch—a bowl of fruit and a roast beef sandwich with a glass of sparkling water. He ate slowly, reflectively, occasionally glancing at the monitor. It displayed the tab’s recent results in analyzing some of his serum proteins."|"Blood Music"|"Greg Bear"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"He hadn’t called him Dad since he had been thirteen. But the old (old) man didn’t hear. He was asleep. Bernard picked up his coat and valise and left, passing the nurse’s station to inquire—out of habit—when the next medication would be.
His father died at three o’clock the next morning, asleep and alone.

04:00|"four in the morning"|"“I don’t usually stay the night, you know,” she said. “I call a lot of cabs at four in the morning when the guy’s asleep. But you kept me busy until five and I just . . . didn’t want to. You wore me out.”"|"Blood Music"|"Greg Bear"

"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"“Good. Done with your breakfast?”
Three more before noon. He couldn’t believe it.
Candice was sore when she left. “I feel like I’ve just trained a year for the pentathlon,” she said as she stood at the door, coat in hand. “Do you want me to come back tonight? I mean, to visit?” She looked anxious. “I couldn’t make love any more. I think you’ve brought on my period early.”"|"Blood Music"|"Greg Bear"
