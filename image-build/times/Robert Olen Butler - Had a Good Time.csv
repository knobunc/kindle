"~ 10:00"|"about ten in the morning"|"The next morning I was sent to John Stanford Barnhill’s rooms on the eighth floor. On the silver tray balanced on my palm was a bottle of whiskey. This was about ten in the morning, though I shouldn’t sneer because even Papa started early some days. So I knock on his door, which is slightly open, and he calls for me to come in. I push the door and step into the place, a regular cut-velvet and leather sitting room. It smells strong of cigar smoke. He’s left one lit on a saucer on the reading table. The gentleman himself is hanging out the open lower sash like the women in the tenements."|"Had a Good Time"|"Robert Olen Butler"

12:00|noon|"I stopped, still separate from them. My daughter, a tall gangly girl, my sweet Naomi, emerged from the house, and for a moment they all three were before me, and the house itself, a fine house, a house we’d lived in for four years now, a solid house with its hipped roof and double-windowed dormer and its clapboard siding the color of sunlight in the brightness of noon."|"Had a Good Time"|"Robert Olen Butler"
"< 12:00"|"near noon"|"I have seen men die before. My father, long ago, his lungs bricked up solid with pneumonia. A man in the Alleghenys, broken beneath a felled tree, when I was young and working in timber. And another in New York City on that day in 1909 when I went out of the Singer Building and into the streets that were dim even near noon, streets narrow and full of rushing men and the hammering of metal and the whine of wheels and the mutter of automobile engines and the clatter of a distant elevated train, and I turned to look up at the place where I’d stood, in the middle of the air, and my eyes went up and up, impossibly high, up the great bluestone and redbrick column, up to its great mansard roof and cupola and the bright sky beyond. “Step lively,” a voice said, and I looked and I could not pick the speaker out of a hundred bowlered men moving all about me."|"Had a Good Time"|"Robert Olen Butler"

"> 00:00"|"After midnight"|"After midnight I arose and I took a lantern and a shovel and I made a way to the bam, the new snow biting at me all the while, but at last I came in to Sam and hung the lantern, and he muttered in that way he sometimes did, like he knew a thing before it would happen—he knew I’d be there—and I lay down by my horse and I put my arms around him. “Aren’t you glad you’re in your stable,” I whispered to him. “I brought you here away from the storm.” And I held him tight."|"Had a Good Time"|"Robert Olen Butler"

They coated the six offending actors, not sparing the two women of the troupe. Following the tarring all six were dumped into a creek and then told to hasten out of the village. They walked eight miles to Washington after midnight, but were told there to keep moving."|"Had a Good Time"|"Robert Olen Butler"
"ap 10:00"|"10 o’clock"|"I flinch. I am on the beach at Coney Island. I am surrounded by strangers. I am holding my New York Times. It is still lifted, wide open to pages two and three. I heard my father’s voice with perfect clarity, right here beside me. I listen, but he does not speak again. I look back to the newspaper, returning to the last sentence I read at the foot of page two, a numbering of the police force. I lift my eyes to the top of the page. DENTIST SHOT DOWN TALKING IN STREET. But he seemed to know his assailant. No Attempt to Rob Murdered Man—Police Believe the Motive Was Jealousy. Dr. W. F. Michaelis of Chicago, what could have possessed you to do what you seem to have done? Miss Inez Wilcox, a young stenographer employed in a downtown office, was at the office of Dr. Michaelis until within half an hour of the time of the murder. She had been employed in clerical work by the dentist, she explained, and was so occupied until 10 o’clock last night. She left the office at the same time as Dr. Michaelis, and parted from him in the street. Half an hour later he was shot to death."|"Had a Good Time"|"Robert Olen Butler"
