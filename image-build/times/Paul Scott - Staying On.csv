00:00|midnight|"The last Monday morning in this April (April 24) was such a morning; if anything heavier than usual with the pressure of Mrs Bhoolabhoy’s martyrdom which throbbed like a silent fog-warning through the hotel from the shuttered bedroom (the old Number One) where she lay on a massive double bed which she took up most of. Occasionally Mr Bhoolabhoy was detailed to share this bed but had not been the previous night when he had slept in his own room (the old Number Two). The two rooms were en-suite with a communicating door which Mr Bhoolabhoy never bolted his side of but which frequently did not give to his gentle midnight nudge. He had not nudged it the night before. Sunday had been a shattering day."|"Staying On"|"Paul Scott"

Minnie was now plump, middle-aged and grumpy. Mr Bhoolabhoy got no change out of her. She took orders only from Mrs Bhoolabhoy, and not always from her. Mr Bhoolabhoy maintained a cautious attitude to Minnie. Sometimes Minnie complained about him to Mrs Bhoolabhoy, or about what she called Management which came to the same thing. This led to Mrs Bhoolabhoy shouting at him. At other times when Minnie was being uncooperative even with Mrs Bhoolabhoy he got shouted at again."|"Staying On"|"Paul Scott"
00:00|midnight|"What gave Monday evenings their attraction was not just that Mrs Bhoolabhoy could be counted on to stay late at the club but also that on these evenings Mrs Smalley took herself to the pictures at the New Electric. Once Mr Bhoolabhoy had seen the last evening guest out of Smith’s dining-room and ensured that the servants were beginning to clear up and the kitchen-staff to wash up, that cook had remembered to prepare Mrs Bhoolabhoy’s midnight snack, that Minnie had properly arranged her mistress’s bed and was somewhere within her mistress’s immediate call, then he and Tusker could meet over a bottle either at The Lodge or on the verandah of the hotel (where the sound of Mrs Bhoolabhoy returning could be better heard)."|"Staying On"|"Paul Scott"
00:00|midnight|"This tended to depend on how much she had won. More often than not she came home up on the evening in which case Mr Bhoolabhoy had to be prepared to be up to things too. He had to be similarly prepared if she had lost so much in the day-long bridge session that she was feeling unloved and unwanted in an unkind and swindling world. He found this rather touching and on such occasions, after their combined and gigantic climax, they often had a little weep together and exchanged protestations of their beholdeness one to the other and of their resolve to be beholden forever. (Her break-even nights could be very dull.) Too often, though, the combination of money lost, midnight snack, violent intercourse and tears of relief and love, led next day to Mrs Bhoolabhoy’s further prostration."|"Staying On"|"Paul Scott"

You poked fun at the Laytons even in front of Indians and were insensitive to the fact that very often the Indians were shocked and that I was embarrassed and am still embarrassed by the way you belittle things and people that belong to a part of your life you have decided is behind you. In Bombay you poked fun at the Indian officers you’d been working with who’d taken over the reins, you poked fun at them to all those box-wallahs. It is not an attractive trait Tusker, and it is too late for you to do anything about it, it seems to be part of your nature to attack, to denigrate and now to obfuscate, and I have lived with it too long to have the strength to do anything but regret it and to observe it as the reason why I have no friends, because all our friends are your friends, Tusker, not mine, and – yes, I will say it – they are all black and I want you to realize that it has been much on my mind recently that if you had not recovered from your attack I would have been alone here, alone, Tusker, and having to rely for human sympathy and moral support upon people who frankly do not care for me, not deeply, and for whom I do not deeply care either.”"|"Staying On"|"Paul Scott"

But Susy was still having to hammer out the hymns on the piano and tune it herself; and the congregation had to be content to celebrate Holy Communion when it suited the Reverend Stephen to officiate, which wasn’t often because unlike old Tom Narayan he insisted on doing so no later than eight o’clock in the morning, on an empty stomach, which meant that he could usually conduct the service only at those weekends which brought him up to Pankot on Fridays or Saturdays, weekends which seemed difficult not to connect with the weekends when the Inspector-General of Police in Ranpur came up to play golf; arriving in his official car with the identifying flag fluttering and Mr Ambedkar sitting next to him wearing dark glasses and looking forward to some golf too and to a weekend not at the Menektaras but at the old Flagstaff House where they would both be fellow guests of General Krippalani, the senior officer in the Ranpur area."|"Staying On"|"Paul Scott"

Mr Ambedkar was persona grata with the director of the Indian Airlines office in Ranpur and occasionally got a free air passage to Nansera, which meant that he arrived in Pankot on the airport bus late on a Saturday afternoon but then usually had to return to Ranpur on Sunday evening. Sometimes Mr Bhoolabhoy had very short notice of Mr Ambedkar’s intended arrival by this method and was hard put to it to spread the news to intending communicants to be at St John’s by eight o’clock on Sunday morning if they wished to avail themselves of the opportunity offered. Mr Ambedkar always expressed his understanding of this difficulty but you could see he was a little put out if less than half-a-dozen turned up to kneel at the rail. Before beckoning them forward he rather ostentatiously counted them and then consecrated the requisite number of wafers, and the wine. Mr Bhoolabhoy noticed that his accuracy in regard to the wafers did not extend to accuracy over the amount of wine, of which there was usually a fair swig left at the bottom of the chalice which Mr Ambedkar drained and then wiped with a sigh of resignation."|"Staying On"|"Paul Scott"

I have seen you attempt to make a curry. In the bazaar I’ve known you to squander half the week’s housekeeping in half-an-hour. I have watched you poach an egg. If you insist on having a poached egg for lunch I am prepared to poach it for you myself in order not to see several eggs wasted, and because as mistress of the house it’s my duty to see the master fed. But after that, Tusker, I shall go across and have my chicken pulao. I shall expect to sleep between three o’clock and five o’clock and providing Ibrahim brings back enough eggs I may even poach you another one for your evening meal. Then I’ll have to decide whether to have one too, or dine at Smith’s or at the Club or at the Shiraz.”"|"Staying On"|"Paul Scott"

"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"It was dark when she woke. For a moment she thought it must be the middle of the night, but light was coming into the bedroom from the living-room and Tusker’s bed was empty. Someone had covered her with a light blanket and she was fully clothed. She reached for her bedside clock. It wasn’t quite eight o’clock. She had slept for nearly four hours. She put her shoes on and tottered into the bathroom, splashed her face, combed her disordered hair and dabbed cologne on her temples."|"Staying On"|"Paul Scott"
20:00|"8 pm"|"“Thought I’d dine at the Club tonight so booked a table when out for my walk. Couldn’t wake you. So gone on. Table’s for 8 pm but I’ll hang on until 8.30ish in case you want to join me. Otherwise back about eleven. The enclosed is the clear statement you asked for.” It was signed T, and marked 7.30 pm. Perhaps it was Tusker, not Ibrahim, who had covered her with the blanket."|"Staying On"|"Paul Scott"

"ap ~ 11:00"|"gone eleven"|"She would be sixty-seven next birthday. If Tusker died she would be lucky to have £1500 a year. For capital, there would be only the £2000 plus profits from the insurance. She would have enough to take her home, but what then? She dropped off, woke, tossed, turned. Presently she switched the light on to see the time. It was gone eleven. In the dark again still juggling with figures and possibilities she remained alert, for a while. Then she must have dozed. She was woken by voices and identified Tusker’s and Dr Mitra’s and Mrs Mitra’s. God forbid that they stayed. Presumably they’d brought him home and he’d invited them in. Within a few moments she was relieved to hear their goodnights, Tusker locking up after them, going to the kitchen to make his cocoa."|"Staying On"|"Paul Scott"
"ap 07:15"|7.15|"AT 7.15 ON THE MORNING of Monday April 24, Lucy finished her bed tea. Over at the hotel, Mr Bhoolabhoy heard Mrs Bhoolabhoy moan in Room 1. Fifteen minutes later Lucy tiptoed out of the bathroom, having dressed in there in order not to disturb Tusker who had had a restless night and was now asleep. She went to tell Ibrahim to delay Burra Sahib’s tea until 8.15, when she would be leaving for the Shiraz. While she was telling Ibrahim this and giving him the shopping list, Mr Bhoolabhoy, summoned by Minnie, was tiptoeing into Mrs Bhoolabhoy’s room. He too had spent a restless night, after a strangely puzzling and taxing day with Father Sebastian, Mr Thomas and Susy. Entering, he found Lila as he’d expected to find her: prostrate, moaning gently. They had not spoken since the row on Saturday."|"Staying On"|"Paul Scott"

"ap ~ 10:30"|"about 10.30"|"“Well, yes, we’ll need more drink, but I think that is Burra Sahib’s responsibility. I’ll discuss it with him when I get back, round about 10.15 or 10.30. What I want you to do directly I’ve gone is give him his tea and then make his breakfast, and then go down to the bazaar. We can all meet up again at about 10.30 and have a little conference, and then Sahib can take Bloxsaw for a walk and buy the booze.”"|"Staying On"|"Paul Scott"
"ap 08:30"|eight-thirty|"He watched her go. She took the side path to the side entrance where the Shiraz loomed. She paused again, bent and touched the petals of a potted petunia. Then he went indoors, put a kettle on, set up Smalley Sahib’s breakfast tray. At eight-thirty he took the bed tea in and opened the curtains. He went to the garage to let Bloxsaw out. The creature slunk to the verandah and lay down again. Then he cut bread for toast, put the water for Sahib’s boiled egg on to simmer in a pan. Simmer or boil over. Who could tell?"|"Staying On"|"Paul Scott"

"ap 09:15"|9.15|"Ibrahim went. He glanced at his watch. 9.15. He waited for a moment inside the bungalow in case the Sahib cried for help because the egg was off, but the only sound was that of Bloxsaw beginning to whine. He went out to find Joseph and tell him to pack his bags too. I do not want the garden to go jungly. I have no intention of letting it go jungly, Memsahib had said. In spite of being paid off on the spot for once, the business of reinstatement should not take long. “He is, after all, my mali,” Ibrahim murmured. “One out all out.”"|"Staying On"|"Paul Scott"
"ap ~ 09:30"|"gone half-past nine"|"She drank her coffee and noted in the mirror that the first of the smart young assistants had arrived, which meant it was gone half-past nine. She looked down at the magazines on her knee. Toole stared up at her in his Steve McQueen persona. Paris-Match: a paper left by a tourist, presumably. She flipped through the pages, trying to read the captions. She had never had any gift for languages. Her first French school book had been called Le Livre Bleu. She could remember the first sentence. “On m’appelle Jet.” My name is Jet. Or Blackie. Black cat. Lucky cat. The French mistress at the Girls’ High School was a Miss Hoad. Known as Miss Toad, or Froggie. Nobody had liked her until she was ill. Mysteriously ill. A hysterectomy, probably. Then all the girls sent flowers to the cottage hospital. Her own box full had been culled from the vicarage garden. Syringa. Cabbage roses, white and crimson and sweet smelling. A spike of delphinium. Lupin. A peony. June–July flowers. Rita Chalmers’s parents had ordered a bunch from the florist. Everything Rita Chalmers did was elegant. She had married a man whose parents had a Rolls. Lucy wondered whether Rita had been happy. She had not thought of Rita Chalmers for years, nor of Miss Hoad, nor of the box of flowers. She remembered how superstitious her mother was of dreams about flowers. “If I dream of flowers,” Mumsie had said, “I inevitably have news afterwards of a death.”"|"Staying On"|"Paul Scott"
"ap 03:30"|3.30|"Woke, shivering. Her watch showed 3.30. She should not have gone to bed so early. The pill had worked, but worn off. She got out of bed, put on her gown and slippers and was shattered by recollection, Tusker’s empty bed. Going past it to the living-room she switched his lamp off. The living-room was unlit except by the light coming from the bedroom. She trod gently. Curled up near the almost dead fire were two shapes in blankets. Minnie and Ibrahim, one on each side of the fireplace. Going gently past them she caught her breath because there was a third shape, huddled with its back to the wall."|"Staying On"|"Paul Scott"
