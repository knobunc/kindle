00:00|midnight|"…but there were no hours here. There was dawn and dusk, morning and afternoon, and presumably there was midnight and midday, but mainly there was heat. And redness. Something as artificial and human as an hour wouldn’t last five minutes here. It would be dried out and shriveled up in seconds."|"The Last Continent"|"Terry Pratchett"

"< 02:00"|"just before two A.M."|"Ponder must have nodded off, because he was awakened just before two A.M. by a scream and realized he was face down in half of his supper. He pulled a piece of banana-flavored mackerel off his cheek, left Hex quietly clicking through its routine and followed the noises."|"The Last Continent"|"Terry Pratchett"
02:00|"two A.M."|"The rest of the sentence was drowned out not by a noise but by a sort of bloom of quietness, which rolled over the wizards and was so oppressive and soft that they couldn’t even hear their own heartbeats. Old Tom, the University’s magical and tongue-less bell, tolled out two A.M. by striking the silences."|"The Last Continent"|"Terry Pratchett"
03:00|"three o’clock in the morning"|"Now it was three o’clock in the morning. Ridcully was good at doing without other people’s sleep."|"The Last Continent"|"Terry Pratchett"
03:00|"three A.M."|"“He must come out sometimes,” said the Senior Wrangler. “Besides, sensible men should be in bed at three A.M.”"|"The Last Continent"|"Terry Pratchett"
04:00|"four in the morning"|"“At four in the morning? For the beach?” said the Lecturer in Recent Runes. “Of course not.”"|"The Last Continent"|"Terry Pratchett"
12:00|noon|"By noon the track crossed another one, which was much wider. Hoofprints and wheel ruts suggested that it got a lot of traffic. Rincewind brightened up, and followed it through thickening trees, glad of the shade."|"The Last Continent"|"Terry Pratchett"
"~ 01:00"|"around one o’clock in the morning"|"His gummed-up gaze fell upon last night’s magnificent experiment in cookery. Yeasty vegetable soup, what a wonderful idea. Exactly the sort of idea that sounds really good around one o’clock in the morning when you’ve had too much to drink."|"The Last Continent"|"Terry Pratchett"
"~ 12:00"|"around midday"|"Now he remembered, with a shudder, some of the great wheezes he’d had on similar occasions. Spaghetti and custard, that’d been a good one. Deep-fried peas, that’d been another triumph. And then there’d been the time when it had seemed a really good idea to eat some flour and yeast and then drink some warm water, because he’d run out of bread and after all that was what the stomach saw, wasn’t it? The thing about late-night cookery was that it made sense at the time. It always had some logic behind it. It just wasn’t the kind of logic you’d use around midday."|"The Last Continent"|"Terry Pratchett"
"~ 05:00"|"about five A.M."|"“Thank you.”
“Until about five A.M.”
“Good,” said Rincewind gloomily."|"The Last Continent"|"Terry Pratchett"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"“You put pies upside down in runny peas and then put sauce on them. Someone actually sat down one day, after midnight if I’m any judge, and thought that would be a good idea. No one will ever believe this one.” Rincewind looked at the submerged pie. “That’s going to make the story about the land of the giant walking plum puddings look very tame, I don’t mind telling you. No wonder you people drink so much beer…”*"|"The Last Continent"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 03:00"|three|"“Three,” said Rincewind. “It was three. I heard. Someone told me. Not a dozen. Three.”"|"The Last Continent"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 01:00"|one|"In short, they’d written on the walls. Rincewind could make out careful inscriptions telling posterity that, for example, B. Smoth Is A Pozza. While he didn’t know what a pozza was, he was quite, quite sure that B. Smoth didn’t want to be called one. It was amazing how slang seemed to radiate its meaning even in another language."|"The Last Continent"|"Terry Pratchett"
10:00|"ten in the morning"|"Someone tapped him on the shoulder. It was Neilette. Letitia and Darleen were standing behind her, grinning. It was ten in the morning. They were wearing sequined evening gowns."|"The Last Continent"|"Terry Pratchett"
