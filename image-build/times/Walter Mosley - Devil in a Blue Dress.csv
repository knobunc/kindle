"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"IT WAS STILL EARLY when I left Piney’s, about noon. I drove up toward Watts thinking that I should have been at work instead of in the company of naked women. Whorehouses and prostitutes belonged in my past. I had a job and a family to worry about. And as much as I missed him, Mouse, Raymond Alexander, was dead."|"Devil in a Blue Dress"|"Walter Mosley"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"That February, 1964, Medgar was sixty-one and still going strong. He might have been the richest black man in Los Angeles, but he still wore homemade suits and shined his own shoes every morning. The old market had become the school, and the storefront was now the church business office.
I got to the business office a few minutes shy of one o’clock.
The woman sitting behind the long desk at the back of the room was over sixty. She wore glasses with white frames and a green blouse with a pink sweater draped over her shoulders. Six of eight fingers had gold rings on them and, when she opened her mouth, you could see that three of her teeth were edged in gold. She was buxom but otherwise slender. She seemed unhappy to see me, but maybe that was her reaction to anyone coming in the door."|"Devil in a Blue Dress"|"Walter Mosley"

THE CALL CAME a little before nine o’clock Sunday night.
“Mr. Rawlins?” a young woman’s voice asked."|"Devil in a Blue Dress"|"Walter Mosley"

03:00|"three in the morning"|"JOHN’S PLACE WAS A SPEAKEASY before they repealed Prohibition. But by 1948 we had legitimate bars all over L.A. John liked the speakeasy business though, and he had been in so much trouble with the law that City Hall wouldn’t have given him a license to drive, much less to sell liquor. So John kept paying off the police and running an illegal nightclub through the back door of a little market at the corner of Central Avenue and Eighty-ninth Place. You could walk into that store any evening up until three in the morning to find Hattie Parsons sitting behind the candy counter. They didn’t have many groceries, and no fresh produce or dairy goods, but she’d sell you what was there and if you knew the right words, or were a regular, then she’d let you in the club through the back door. But if you thought that you should be able to get in on account of your name, or your clothes or maybe your bankbook, well, Hattie kept a straight razor in her apron pocket and her nephew, Junior Fornay, sat right behind the door."|"Devil in a Blue Dress"|"Walter Mosley"

And even though he was a God-fearing man he’d find his way down to John’s about three or four times a week. He’d sit there until midnight nursing a bottle of beer, not saying a word unless somebody spoke to him."|"Devil in a Blue Dress"|"Walter Mosley"

She was younger than the rest of them, maybe seventeen, and it seemed like she was the only girl without a date.
