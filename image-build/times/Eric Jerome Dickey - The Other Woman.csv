By then, Charles is on the way home. Today, like most days, he calls me while he’s fighting rush hour on the 60 westbound, and at the same time I’m running to find a quiet spot to have a private conversation with my man, which ends up sounding a lot like another business tete-a-tete, being mostly talk about things we need to take care of around the house: paying the bills, dropping clothes off at the dry cleaners, reminding him that there are clothes in the washer that need to get tossed in the dryer, or him telling me how his day went, what twelve-year-old got caught with LSD, or what preteen kids got caught fucking in the bathroom, how the Asian kids continue to be much smarter than the blacks and Hispanics, what some stupid asshole parent said at a parent-teacher meeting."|"The Other Woman"|"Eric Jerome Dickey"

Hard to meet and maintain a steady lover on the schedule she has. I know how it is. Been there, done that for years.

I remember us laughing and joking about what would have happened if we had gotten too enthusiastic and the rail had given out and we had plunged down through the palm trees, coming and screaming. A day later, we made love in the ocean, moonlight over our heads and waves hitting us from the back. That was when we were new to each other.

Give me a start date. The first time it happened (location) and when. Last time. You claim this wasn’t that serious, but her husband seems to think differently, so I need to know whose fuck ‘n’ chuck count is off. Guess how many times you were with her.5. Where did you meet to have sex? Give me geographi callocations. Cities, hotels, homes, apartments, parks, vehicles, all of that should be included.6. Did you use a condom EVERY time? (If so, did it ever break or slip off? If not, what were you thinking?)7. Did you give her oral sex at ANY time?8. Did she go down on you?9. Did you ever tell her you loved her?10. Did you ever tell her that you didn’t or don’t love me?11. Did you discuss our sex life with her?12. After sex did you hold her?13. Who else knows? How many other people? Give me names. Friends and non-friends. Coworkers count as non-friends.14. How often did you meet? Approximate dates.15. Did you date? (The answer is obvious.) Where did you go? And a DATE (to avoid any double-talk or ambiguity) includes being in separate cars OR traveling in the same plane, train, or automobile, and it doesn’t matter if you split the tab or one of you picked up the check. It doesn’t have to be a high-class dinner at EuroChow or a discreet meeting at TGIF, could just be walking on the beach, in a mall, on Crenshaw, talking.16. Did you fuck her the same days you made love to me?17. Did you make love to me the same days you went off and fucked her? I know this sounds like question 16, but trust me, in my mind it’s different.18. Were you ever planning to leave me for her?19. Did you ever want her to want you in that way, to take you away from me?20. What did I do wrong? Or what didn’t I do?21. Since trust is no longer a constant in our relationship (your fault, not mine), we have to come up with a way to verify your answers. And to verify all of your answers, this is what we do: Arrange a meeting between David and Jessica Lawrence, not over the phone, face-to-face, like mature adults, at a neutral place, a public place where we can check ID (driver’s license or passport) and verify that everyone is who they say they are, so we can sit down and talk this out and see where we all stand. We’ll split the tab 50/50.22. Questions 22-25 are pending.

"ap 11:34"|11:34|"Subj: What I feel for youTime: 11:34:02 PM Pacific Daylight TimeFrom: JessicaTo: Charles

Every time you touch me, a part of me walks away from him. Every time we leave our haven, our heaven, I feel guilty. Not for what we did, but for leaving you. I sit with my husband, talk with my husband, eat dinner with my husband, and I feel alone. I’m broken, a woman who is living many lives in many pieces.I have to see movies twice. l go with him and pretend that it’s all new to me. And I know you do the same. This treachery is making me weary.Do you know how hard it is to be in love with someone and I can’t tell anyone? I can’t put a picture of you up. I can’t even own one. Do you know how bad I want to call you right now? I can’t call you. I can’t wait for your calls, because I know you’re not going to call. I can’t look at you too long at work. I can’t speak your name in the tone it deserves, the one that rises from my heart. I can’t make love to you and wear our aroma. I have to wash away all traces of us before I leave the room. And when I watch you do the same, see how careful you are, the way you make sure you have all of your belongings, how you make sure you leave with the same scent you left home wearing, one that has no traces of me. I remember the day you left your watch at the hotel. How you freaked out, had to go back and get it. Then you explained that your watch was a present from your wife. I said nothing, but now I hate that watch. Hate when you look at it to see how much time we have, because in my mind you’re looking at her. Now I see how you keep all of your things in a neat pile so nothing will be forgotten, it bothers me. We wash each other as if we’re washing the lies off our bodies. We shouldn’t be ashamed of what we have, of what we feel.I’m even afraid to dream about you because I might wake up in a haze, moaning your name. We’re going out less and less, spending most of our time in rented rooms, rooms that many others come to rest in, to make love in, then go. I wish we could have our own space. Our own heaven, our own sheets that are unsoiled by the sins of others. I want a place where I can put pictures of us up. Maybe I can get us a place during the summer, an apartment, so when the both of us are off work for those months, we can come and go as we please. A place where I can wait for you, or you can wait for me, and we can bathe and massage each other. We can leave each other love letters.I love you and I’ve never spent the night with you. I’ve never seen you in the morning’s light.What we have has gravity. The kind that I can’t ignore. I’ll give up all I have and eat rice and beans if you tell me that we can grow old together.Your touch is liberation.What I feel for you is incurable.As always, you are the love of my life. The one I can’t live without.Forever goes by before Charles opens the bedroom door. He walks in, bouncing those sheets of paper against his leg, and stares at my reflection in the mirror."|"The Other Woman"|"Eric Jerome Dickey"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o‘clock"|"His voice softens. “Jessica cried about it. Didn’t detach herself, she didn’t try to make it a special report for the damn ten o‘clock news. She did what real people do, she cried.”"|"The Other Woman"|"Eric Jerome Dickey"
06:00|"six in the morning"|"A little more than five years ago I met Charles on a crowded bus heading to Mammoth. We were on a KJLH and Four Seasons West ski trip. Saw my future husband when I was struggling to toss my luggage under the bus at six in the morning. I wasn’t interested in him at that moment. He came over and helped me, took charge the moment I met him. I liked that about a man. I wasn’t in the talking mood, but when I saw him up close, I did my best to sip my coffee and perk up, tried to be grateful for his help."|"The Other Woman"|"Eric Jerome Dickey"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"We ended up sitting across from each other, but I tucked a pillow under my head and went to sleep as soon as I got on the bus. After being up until two in the morning, not even a quadruple cappuccino could wake me up. But my people were yakking and getting their party on by sunrise, had the music bumping like it was New Year’s Eve, so I had to wake up, and Charles and I ended up talking off and on. We ended up in the same ski school, with all that bulky equipment weighing us down, learning how to turn and wedge, and falling off the ski lift, then tumbling down the bunny slopes together."|"The Other Woman"|"Eric Jerome Dickey"
"ap 06:00"|"six o‘clock"|"I nodded. “Well, all I’m worried about is your woman rolling up on me from the backside. Last thing I need is to become the lead story on the six o‘clock news.”"|"The Other Woman"|"Eric Jerome Dickey"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"We hooked up after I got off work pretty much every night, and I cooked a late dinner for him, easier to cook for two than for one was what I had said, and that had us eating after midnight, then with the kissing, and his hard-on would betray him, we moved toward the inevitable, his fingers would find their way to my vagina, the way he traced the edges, made circles, massaged that button while he sucked on my breasts ... that combination was dangerous ... made my voice change ... eyes tightened ... pre-orgasmic growls came from deep inside ... famished moans ... then my panties were at my ankles ... my skirt pulled up high ... his change jingling as his pants fell and bunched at his feet ... right there ... kitchen counter ... up against the front door ... on the carpet ... got to the point that if I knew he was coming over I wore a skirt ... high heels that pimped out my calves and made my butt curve more ... no panties ... always played the role and waited for him to make his move ... to get past all the talking about our families ... about Bible study and church and God ... about jobs ... beyond all the laughing at each other’s stupid jokes ... starting off polite ... watching the clock ... waiting for him to shut me up and get inside me ... melting when his lips finally touched my neck ... playing cool and aching for the next level ... dizzy when his hand held my ass ... then ... his erection pressing up against me ... fucking our hearts out ... sometimes candles burning ... sometimes music ... sometimes no time for sensual ceremonies and going all the way in a room with all the lights on ... Venetian blinds cracked for the voyeuristic ... in my old creaky bed ... my first bed from my college days ... first with condoms ... then lust disguised as trust numbed the sensibilities ... I’m not seeing anybody ... you’re not seeing anybody ... I’m HIV negative ... you’re negative ... I’m on the pill ... never miss one ... helps me with my period ... then ... condoms abandoned for real contact ... moved toward recklessness ... no barrier ... skin to skin ... so intense ... was like starting all over again ... he’d sex me awhile ... stop ... lay me down and stroke my clit ... stroke ... give me agony ... stroke ... make me beg ... then his tongue dancing inside my pussy ... turned his body until ... until ... invited his penis to find shelter in the warmth of my mouth ... taking him slow ... methodical ... playing his sex like it was my sax ... while being licked slow in figure eights ... then using my hand and mouth ... punishing him ... being punished ... trying to make him go crazy before he made me go insane ... me, the woman who looks like a freckle-faced church girl, giving deep throat on a Sunday afternoon ... me and the innocent-looking history teacher who dined on my clit like it was a French cuisine ... then lying next to each other ... caressing and confessing ... feeling high and heady ... couldn’t help saying things from the heart ... he told me he never met anybody like me ... beautiful ... got that from my momma ... professional ... afraid of failure ... cooked ... got that from my momma ... kept a clean apartment ... from my momma ... so eager to please ... no comment on that one ... not flaky ... too busy working, no time for games ... no phones ringing all times of the night ... no time for conventional dating, no secret lovers ... not like the typical L.A. girls ... try not to be ... a total package ... damn, really ... a renaissance woman ... then he massaged me with hot oils ... painted my toes ... scratched my scalp ... oiled my hair ... cooked Cajun dishes for me ... made my heart sing ... always there when I called ... reliable ... romantic ... the start of our inseparable summer."|"The Other Woman"|"Eric Jerome Dickey"

00:00|midnight|"I confess that in a shaky voice, a bewildered tone, don’t try to romanticize what went down between midnight and sunrise. I slept with a married man.

Need to scrub away all the bad karma that is clinging to me. I want to bathe so I can soak awhile, but I can’t find the stopper to the tub. I say three tears in a bucket and go for the shower. I close the door and get the water hot enough to make Yvette’s petite bathroom steam up like a sauna, and I strip down, look at my bruised knee. I ran into the corner of that metal entertainment center harder than I thought. It’s a dark purple, like a swollen eye. Looks worse than it feels."|"The Other Woman"|"Eric Jerome Dickey"
