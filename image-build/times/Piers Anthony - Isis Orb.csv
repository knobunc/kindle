"< 12:00"|"Before noon"|"They trudged on through the rain. At least Hapless and Cylla had their umbrellas, and there wasn’t far to go, thanks to the good traveling the day before. Before noon they came in sight of the Good Magician’s Castle."|"Isis Orb"|"Piers Anthony"
"ap 11:00"|Eleven|"“It is Eleven Elves, settled by ground-dwelling elves. As you know, there are many species of elves, the best known of which are the Elm elves whose strength is inversely proportional to their distance from their tree. These are separate, but they have their skills. They prefer to remain inconspicuous, to avoid mischief from passing dragons and monsters with too much time on their claws.

"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"“Big snake at seven o’clock,” Myst announced. She was pretty good as a spotter, thanks to her sensitivity in mist form."|"Isis Orb"|"Piers Anthony"
"ap 03:00"|three|"But the siege was hardly over. “Bogies at three and five o’clock,” Myst announced. “Goblins and wolves.” She paused. “The Garbage Goblin tribe, I think; they’re bad. Rabid wolves, by the smell of it. Can’t let any spit touch you.”"|"Isis Orb"|"Piers Anthony"
