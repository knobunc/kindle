"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"I slept with her that night, for the first and last time. In the morning I broke down the set in the living room while she packed. I promised to write. I promised to come and visit when I could. I carried her bags down to the car, and stowed them inside. I kissed her and waved goodbye. I went looking for a drink, and at four o’clock the next morning a mugger decided I looked drunk enough and I broke his jaw, his nose and two ribs, and then sat down on him and cried. On Monday morning I showed up at the studio with my hat in my hand and a mouth like a bus-station ashtray and crawled back into my old job. Norrey didn’t ask any questions. What with rising food prices, I gave up eating anything but bourbon, and in six months I was fired. It went like that for a long time."|"The Stardance Trilogy"|"Spider Robinson"

I grunted, hung the phone up on thin air, stepped out of bed and into a hotel wastebasket, cannoned into the bedside table destroying table and accompanying lamp, and ended up prone on the floor with my chin sunk deep into the pile rug and my nose a couple of centimeters from a glowing clockface that said it was 4:42. In the morning. At the moment that I came completely awake, the clock expired and its glow went out."|"The Stardance Trilogy"|"Spider Robinson"

I thought you were the jackass of the world. That night I blew up at you in Le Maintenant, that last time that we argued religion—remember? I walked out of there that night and took a copter straight to Nova Scotia to that damned commune you grew up in. Landed in the middle of the garden at three in the morning, woke half of ’em up. I raved and swore at them for over an hour, demanding to know how in the hell they could have raised you to be such a misguided idiot. When I was done they blinked and scratched and yawned and then the big one with the really improbable beard said, ‘Well, if there’s that much juice between you, we would recommend that you probably ought to start courting,’ and gave me a sleeping bag.”"|"The Stardance Trilogy"|"Spider Robinson"

A month he’d been home already, and she was just getting used to having him around again. Every home should have a husband. She shut off the light with a wall switch and left the bathroom, walked down the short hallway to the bedroom. In her mind’s eye she was still seeing the slow dance of Monument and moon in the crisp cold starlight as she opened the bedroom door and stepped into New Mexico desert at high noon."|"The Stardance Trilogy"|"Spider Robinson"

I always said I was going to check out when and if my clock showed three figures…and I came here to the Shimizu for that purpose. I stopped controlling my cosmetic age the day I moved into this suite, as a sign that I was withdrawing from human affairs. I’ve been saying goodbye for the last sixteen years.

Every few minutes she found something that made her giggle and call Rhea or Rand to “Look!” or “Come see!” Rhea let her roam unchecked, knowing she would tire herself out and nap soundly soon. They’d all had to get up before dawn to make the flight, and it was now nearly 6 PM, Shimizu time. Besides, this suite was safe for kids.

He and Rand had accomplished so much work that he decided to celebrate. He jaunted to Jake’s, in the Deluxe Tier, one of the livelier of the Shimizu’s twenty-one taverns—and one of only three in which off-duty employees were welcome. There he found some friends, and settled down to matching orbits with them."|"The Stardance Trilogy"|"Spider Robinson"
"~ 16:30"|Vespers|"From somewhere in the far distance to the north came the half-mournful, half-comic sound of a Tibetan mountain horn like the two Gunter had been shown downstairs, a sustained baritone bleat that made him think of a brontosaur dying in agony. It made the mountains ring with echoes. “What’s that?” he asked idly. “Call to prayer? Some sort of religious ceremony in another temple?” Perhaps this trip need not be a total loss. Exotic religions were a hobby of Gunter’s; having had his mouth set for a grand festive colorful Buddhist ceremony, he was now prepared to settle for the local equivalent of Vespers, rather than go home empty-handed."|"The Stardance Trilogy"|"Spider Robinson"

Coincidentally it was lined up roughly with our seatbacks in one axis, so the effect was to push us gently down into our seats. But if you considered the round bulkhead up front as a clock, “down” was at about 8:30: we all tilted to the right like bus passengers on a long curve. I found my face pressed gently against Robert’s, my weight supported by his strong shoulder, with Kirra’s head on my lap.
