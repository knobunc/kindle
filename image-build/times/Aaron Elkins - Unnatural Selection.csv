"ap < 06:00"|"a few minutes before six"|"The Bishop and Wolf had been the consortium’s pub of choice during its first convening two years earlier, and Julie had pointed it out on their walk through Hugh Town when they’d arrived. The oldest building in the village, an attractive, mid-seventeenth-century stone inn with pansy-filled window boxes that added a whimsical and unlikely Bavarian air to the façade, and a hanging sign that showed a gigantic, slavering wolf crouching over a bishop’s mitre-topped light-house (the pub had been named for the Bishop and the Wolf, two of St. Mary’s earliest lighthouses). Situated in the center of the village, on the little square where the Strand and the Parade angled together, it was only a five-minute walk from Garrison Hill, so that it was a few minutes before six when Gideon pulled open the door and entered an old English pub, traditional in the extreme: cozy and plain, with nets, glass globes, and odds and ends on the walls; dark, old wooden tables; and a fitting, not-really-unpleasant fug of beer, wine, and cigarette smoke in the air."|"Unnatural Selection"|"Aaron Elkins"
"> 10:00"|"shortly after 10:00 A.M."|"THE strands of fog continued to thicken and spread through the night, so that in the morning several of the interisland commercial boat operators called off nonessential operations for the day, and there was some doubt about whether it would be possible to get Hicks and his dog from St. Agnes to St. Mary’s. But Ron, the pilot of the police launch/water ambulance, was up to the task, and shortly after 10:00 A.M., Truscott Hicks and Tess the Border collie were deposited on the Hugh Town quay, where they were met by Gideon, Clapper, and Robb. At Gideon’s request, Robb had brought a couple of trowels for digging (although Gideon was privately counting on the sand’s being soft enough for bare-handed retrieval); a toothbrush and paintbrush for cleaning; some large paper bags and marking pens; and, from Islands Home Hardware, a few doors down from the police station, a three-foot length of large-gauge wire screening and a five-gallon bucket. He would use the last two items to sift the sand around and under any finds that were made, hunting for anything that might turn up."|"Unnatural Selection"|"Aaron Elkins"

"ap > 06:00"|"a little after six"|"AS Clapper had predicted, the fog had continued to thicken, swirling in tendrils of graveyard gray, like mist on a stage set. Walking from the police station to the museum, he could actually see it part in front of him, like water before the prow of a ship, and then close again behind him. “Haven’t seen muck like this in donkey’s years,” he heard one dimly seen passerby complain to another. It was only a little after six, three hours until dark, but the store windows were already lit and the street lights were on, although they did little but contribute an occasional sickly, sulfurous, yellow nimbus to the all-enveloping gray goop. Even the footsteps of others and the occasional whispered snatches of conversation he heard were dulled and muffled by the atmosphere. “This is cool! It really creeps you out,” the distorted voice of an invisible child exulted."|"Unnatural Selection"|"Aaron Elkins"
22:00|"ten o’clock at night"|"WHEN it came to work, Maude Bewley was not the sort to procrastinate. The more of tomorrow’s work you did today, the less work you’d have to do tomorrow; that was her motto. This was the reason she was still puttering around in the Star Castle kitchen at ten o’clock at night. By doing some of the breakfast preparation now, she’d have that much less to do in the morning. She wouldn’t have to come in until it was time to put on the bacon, which meant she could stay in her warm bed an extra half hour, a welcome treat that her joints would appreciate. Having seen to the juices and milk in the refrigerator, she set out the warming pans in the dining room, making sure there was fuel in the burners; laid out the silverware, dishes, and cups; filled the urn with water and its basket with pre-ground coffee (not a one of these Americans wanted tea, even in the morning!); and stepped back to survey her handiwork. Very nice. Everything looked clean and appetizing."|"Unnatural Selection"|"Aaron Elkins"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"Because it was nine o’clock and the police department was open to the public for its daily hour, Robb and Clapper were busy with island police matters (a report of a lost cat, a complaint about a neighbor’s wind chimes), and he was on his own, which suited him. Not that he really minded their being around, but this way he could mumble, exclaim, and go “Hm” to his heart’s content without having to explain what he was doing. Things would go faster. He could get right down to business."|"Unnatural Selection"|"Aaron Elkins"
09:45|"9:45 A.M."|"It was 9:45 A.M. The second urn of post-breakfast coffee, prepared by Mrs. Bewley, was on the seventeenth-century sideboard, and the light had gone on indicating that it was ready. Various items of administrivia had been disposed of, and it was time to get down to the serious business of the day: the reading and discussion of Donald’s paper on the many social and ecological benefits of properly regulated sport-hunting. But one member had yet to arrive."|"Unnatural Selection"|"Aaron Elkins"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"“Then you already know what we have.” He straightened the form on which he’d been writing and read aloud: “‘Cause of death, crushing head injuries; manner of death, undetermined; contributing causes of death, none indicated. ’” He looked up with a shrug. “Been dead twelve to twenty-four hours, from the looks of him; rigor is quite pronounced and hasn’t begun to break up yet. So if what Kozlov told me is so—that he was alive and well as late as eleven o’clock last night—why then, we’d have to put the time at right around then, say somewhere between eleven and one. Body temperature, assuming that it was normal to begin with, is down fourteen degrees Celsius, so that fits nicely enough as well.”"|"Unnatural Selection"|"Aaron Elkins"
"ap > 01:00"|"after one"|"The work—after the earlier excitement of finding the knife cuts, and then of pulling Edgar Villarreal out of the hat, so to speak—seemed pedestrian, even a little boring, so he was glad to take a break and run over to the museum a few blocks away to get the calipers. When he returned, the rumbling coming from his stomach prompted him to look at his watch. He was astonished to see that it was after one. Past time to go and meet Julie for lunch."|"Unnatural Selection"|"Aaron Elkins"
"ap > 01:00"|"after one"|"“Which sent the ogre into remission and brought back the genial, amiable Sergeant Mike,” Gideon said, nodding. “I see. Julie, it’s after one. Would you rather go back into town and get some lunch somewhere? A pot of tea, maybe?”"|"Unnatural Selection"|"Aaron Elkins"
"ap ~ 10:00"|"about ten"|"Julie shook her head. “No. Mr. Moreton locked up after we all got in from the museum, which was about ten. He locks up every night.

I specifically asked about that.”"|"Unnatural Selection"|"Aaron Elkins"
12:00|noon|"CLAPPER yawned and stretched. It had been a long afternoon and little had come of it. He was feeling grungy and depleted. Grumpy, too; not wanting to violate Kozlov’s no-smoking policy, he’d had but one fag since noon, when he’d run outside for a quick break; half a fag, actually. He reassured himself by touching his breast pocket to make certain they were still there. He was on his last interview of the day; in twenty minutes he’d be leaving and lighting up in the fresh air."|"Unnatural Selection"|"Aaron Elkins"

That was everything. Clapper hadn’t expected much to come of it, and he’d been right. If Kozlov had come back saying that he was unable to find it, that it was inexplicably lost, well, that might have been something to think about; but here it was. And it proved nothing, disproved nothing. Gideon was perfectly right: anyone could have sent it."|"Unnatural Selection"|"Aaron Elkins"

Clapper and Madeleine were to be married in the fall and would live, not above the police station, but in a nineteenth-century house on Tresco that had been in Madeleine’s family since the 1930s and was now being restored. They would have a view over the famous old Abbey Gardens and out across the Sound toward St. Mary’s, from which they would be a mere ten minutes by boat. Gideon and Julie were enthusiastically invited to the wedding and enthusiastically accepted.

He climbed the stone steps to find them just arranging themselves in plastic lawn chairs, most of them balancing cups and saucers in their hands or on their thighs, and some managing to deal with a pastry as well.

And what do you know, up popped the name of one Rudolph Walker, who had flown from Toronto on the morning of the eighth, having flown to Toronto from London the day before. He stayed five hours, long enough, I should say, to send the fax and to pick up Mr. Villarreal’s car and dispose of it somewhere, then catch a 3:00 P.M. flight back to Toronto.
