"~ 09:00"|"approximately 9am"|"A Beaverton man was killed at approximately 9am Friday in an accident at the city’s wastewater treatment plant on South River Road. Dead is Xavier Ulysses Lightman, 19, of 603 Bluebonnet Ave., an employee of the city of Beaverton. The Washington County Coroner pronounced Lightman dead at the scene. Lightman was working near a storage tank when an undetected methane leak rendered him unconscious. Investigators surmised a spark from an exposed electrical circuit ignited the gas, and Lightman was killed instantly in the subsequent explosion. A lifetime resident of Beaverton, Lightman is survived by his wife, Pamela, and son, Zackary. Funeral arrangements—"|Armada|"Ernest Cline"
20:00|8pm|"She frowned and continued to block my path, arms folded to indicate that getting past her wasn’t going to be that easy. But then, like a gift from the gods, my phone chimed to inform me I had a new text message. I fumbled it out of my pocket and studied its display: Urgent Reminder—Earth Defense Alliance Command—Lt. Lightman, you are ordered to log in for your mission briefing at 8pm PST."|Armada|"Ernest Cline"
"ap 00:00"|"twelve o’clock"|"The first wave of responding enemy ships was already pouring out of the bottom of the nearest Dreadnaught Sphere like hornets from a metal hive and streaking down on us out of the blackness, approaching fast along our twelve o’clock."|Armada|"Ernest Cline"
19:26|"7:26 p.m."|"“In 1973, NASA discovered the first evidence of a nonterrestrial intelligence, right here in our very own solar system, when the Pioneer 10 spacecraft sent back the first close-up image of Europa, Jupiter’s fourth-largest moon. It was received and decoded at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, on December 3rd at 7:26 p.m. Pacific Standard Time.”"|Armada|"Ernest Cline"

"ap 07:54"|07:54|"A second later, my QComm beeped and its display lit up on my wrist, just as every other QComm in the auditorium did the same thing, creating a single loud beep that echoed through the crowd. I glanced down at my wrist and saw that the same invasion countdown clock now appeared on my QComm’s display, perfectly in sync with the one on the giant projection screen behind the admiral.

“Jesus,” Lex muttered, staring at the QComm strapped to her wrist, watching the seconds tick down. “Now I feel like Snake Plissken.”"|Armada|"Ernest Cline"
"ap < 02:00"|"just before two"|"Down on the surface, I saw Lex’s Sentinel overtake the lead Glaive mech. The two towering opponents began to grapple with one another at the edge of the widest breach in the blast doors. The Sentinel executed an impressive move, spinning counter-clockwise and bringing up one of its massive arms in a clothesline maneuver that knocked the enemy mech’s leg completely off of its hodgepodge torso. Lex power-jumped her Sentinel clear of it just before two other Sentinels unloaded on the immobilized metal beast. This barrage was joined by hundreds of ATHIDs who began to fire on it, too. Within seconds, the five-Glaive mech exploded, raining wreckage and debris down onto the smoking blast doors, which pinged and clanged as each piece impacted on it."|Armada|"Ernest Cline"
"ap 07:02"|"7 hours 02 minutes"|"His gaze drifted back up to the countdown clock mounted on the wall above his desk, and mine followed: 7 hours 02 minutes and 11s remaining. I glanced down at my QComm and saw the countdown mirrored there. It was hard to believe the attack and subsequent battle had all occurred in less than an hour. I watched the seconds tick off."|Armada|"Ernest Cline"
"ap 06:43"|"six hours and forty-three minutes"|"“Now I’ve got your number, and you’ve got mine,” she said. “We can stay in touch.” She pointed to the countdown clock on her QComm and smiled. “We’ll probably only be able to stay in touch for another six hours and forty-three minutes, so it’s no big deal.”"|Armada|"Ernest Cline"
"> 02:00"|"just after two o’clock in the morning"|"Finally I got curious and jumped ahead to the collection of video messages he’d recorded. I clicked on the most recent one, dated less than a week ago. The timestamp said it was just after two o’clock in the morning, by MBA time."|Armada|"Ernest Cline"
"ap 00:00"|"twelve o’clock"|"But with the fearlessness of drone pilots, we continued to charge forward, straight toward our advancing enemy, until we were just within visual contact. Then, at my father’s order, we all slammed on our brakes, and our wing came to a collective, drifting stop. “Bad guys at twelve o’clock,” my father announced over the comm. “Fangs out. Prepare to engage, as soon as we’re within range. You can bet they will.”"|Armada|"Ernest Cline"
