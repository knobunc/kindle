I got into bed, and for the next hour or so I lay reading some more of Gilbert White’s Natural History of Selborn. That also helped, and at last, somewhere between midnight and one a.m., there came a time when I was able to switch out the light and prepare myself for sleep without altogether too many regrets."|"The Best of Roald Dahl"|"Roald Dahl"

"ap > 10:00"|"after ten o’clock"|"The next morning I did not awaken until after ten o’clock. I got out of bed and drew open the curtains. It was another brilliant, hot, desert day. I took a leisurely bath, then dressed myself as carefully as ever. I felt relaxed and chipper. It made me very happy to think that I could still summon a woman to my room with my eyes alone, even in middle-age. And what a woman! It would be fascinating to find out which one of them she was. I would soon know."|"The Best of Roald Dahl"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"The ratman’s face was about eighteen inches from the rat. Twelve inches. Then ten, or perhaps it was eight, and soon there was not more than the length of a man’s hand separating their faces. The rat was pressing its body flat against the car-bonnet, tense and terrified. The ratman was also tense, but with a dangerous active tensity that was like a tight-wound spring. The shadow of a smile flickered around the skin of his mouth."|"The Best of Roald Dahl"|"Roald Dahl"
"~ 15:00"|"Around three in the afternoon"|"Around three in the afternoon, Rummins and Bert were seen riding up the road in a cart drawn by a ponderous and magnificent black carthorse. Opposite the filling-station the cart turned off into the field and stopped near the hayrick."|"The Best of Roald Dahl"|"Roald Dahl"
12:00|noon|"Claud and I had worked beside Rummins on the rick itself, helping to shape it, and I could remember how very hot it had been and the flies around my face and the sweat pouring out everywhere; and especially I could remember the grim scowling presence of Rummins beside me, working with a desperate urgency and watching the sky and shouting at the men to hurry.
At noon, in spite of Rummins, we had knocked off for lunch.
Claud and I had sat down under the hedge with Ole Jimmy and another man called Wilson who was a soldier home on leave, and it was too hot to do much talking. Wilson had some bread and cheese and a canteen of cold tea. Ole Jimmy had a satchel that was an old gas-mask container, and in this, closely packed, standing upright with their necks protruding, were six pint bottles of beer."|"The Best of Roald Dahl"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 00:00"|"twelve o’clock"|"So all I had to do this morning was go to the bank in the village and draw out fifty pounds for myself and fifty for Claud which I would lend him as an advance against wages, and then at twelve o’clock lock up the filling-station and hang the notice on one of the pumps saying GONE FOR THE DAY. Claud would shut the ringer in the pen at the back and put Jackie in the van and off we’d go. I won’t say I was as excited as Claud, but there again, I didn’t have all sorts of important things depending on it either, like buying a house and being able to get married. Nor was I almost born in a kennel with greyhounds like he was, walking about thinking of absolutely nothing else all day – except perhaps Clarice in the evenings. Personally, I had my own career as a filling-station owner to keep me busy, not to mention second-hand cars, but if Claud wanted to fool around with dogs that was all right with me, especially a thing like today – if it came off. As a matter of fact, I don’t mind admitting that every time I thought about the money we were putting on and the money we might win, my stomach gave a little lurch."|"The Best of Roald Dahl"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 00:00"|twelve|"At twelve sharp I locked up and hung the notice on the pump. Claud came round from the back leading Jackie and carrying a large suitcase made of reddish-brown cardboard."|"The Best of Roald Dahl"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap ~ 08:00"|"Round eight"|"‘How old were you then?’
‘Round eight, I should think,’ Claud said.
As we drew closer to Oxford, he became silent again. He kept twisting his neck to see if Jackie was all right, to touch him, to stroke his head, and once he turned around and knelt on the seat to gather more straw around the dog, murmuring something about a draught. We drove round the fringe of Oxford and into the network of narrow country roads, and after a while we turned into a small bumpy lane and along this we began to overtake a thin stream of men and women all walking and cycling in the same direction. Some of the men were leading greyhounds. There was a large saloon car in front of us and through the rear window we could see a dog sitting on the back seat between two men."|"The Best of Roald Dahl"|"Roald Dahl"

‘Midnight,’ a man said who was holding a black dog.
Mr Feasey stepped back a pace and looked most carefully at the dog."|"The Best of Roald Dahl"|"Roald Dahl"

"ap 00:35"|"twenty-five to one"|"On every board all down the line the Black Panther was chalked up at twenty-five to one. I edged forward to the nearest book."|"The Best of Roald Dahl"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 00:45"|"fifteen to one"|"All down the line the twenty-fives were wiped out and it was fifteen to one the Panther now. I took it quick, but by the time I was through the bookies had had enough and they weren’t quoting him any more. They’d only taken six pounds each, but they stood to lose a hundred and fifty, and for them – small-time bookies at a little country flapping-track – that was quite enough for one race, thank you very much. I felt pleased the way I’d managed it. Lots of tickets now. I took them out of my pockets and counted them and they were like a thin pack of cards in my hand. Thirty-three tickets in all. And what did we stand to win? Let me see … something over two thousand pounds. Claud had said he’d win it thirty lengths. Where was Claud now?"|"The Best of Roald Dahl"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 00:35"|"twenty-five to one"|"‘I bet Black Panther,’ I said. ‘Two separate bets of three pounds each at twenty-five to one. Here’s the second ticket.’"|"The Best of Roald Dahl"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 00:35"|"twenty-five to one"|"‘I had three pounds on Black Panther at twenty-five to one,’ I said firmly. ‘Seventy-eight pounds to come.’"|"The Best of Roald Dahl"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap > 05:00"|"Just after five"|"‘Don’t they look marvellous!’ Claud cried, rubbing his hands together hard. ‘What time is it, Gordon?’
‘Just after five.’
Through the window we could see a station-wagon pulling up at the pumps with a woman at the wheel and about eight children in the back eating ice-creams."|"The Best of Roald Dahl"|"Roald Dahl"
"ap 08:40"|"twenty to nine"|"Across the road, a line of cars had already started forming behind the brick-lorry and the grocery-van, and people were opening their doors and getting out and beginning to cross over to have a closer look. I glanced at my watch. It was twenty to nine. Any moment now, I thought, a large black car is going to come streaking along the road from the direction of the village, and the car will be a Rolls, and the face behind the wheel will be the great glistening butcher’s face of Mr Victor Hazel, maker of sausages and pies."|"The Best of Roald Dahl"|"Roald Dahl"
