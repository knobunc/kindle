The doorbell rang about a quarter to eight.
Tressilian went to answer it. he returned to his pantry to find Horbury there, picking up the coffee cups off the tray and looking at the mark on them."|"Hercule Poirot's Christmas"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap ~ 05:00"|"about five o’clock"|"“I’d like you to hear my story first, sir. These are the circumstances: This afternoon, about five o’clock, I was rung up by Mr. Lee at Addlesfield police station. He sounded a bit odd over the phone—asked me to come and see him at eight o’clock this evening—made a special point of the time. Moreover, he instructed me to say to the butler that I was collecting subscriptions for some police charity.”"|"Hercule Poirot's Christmas"|"Agatha Christie"

"ap < 08:00"|"a little before eight o’clock"|"“That’s right, sir. Well, naturally, Mr. Lee is an important person, and I acceded to his request. I got here a little before eight o’clock, and represented myself as seeking subscriptions for the Police Orphanage. The butler went away and returned to tell me that Mr. Lee would see me. Thereupon he showed me up to Mr. Lee’s room, which is situated on the first floor, immediately over the dining room.”"|"Hercule Poirot's Christmas"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 09:15"|"nine fifteen"|"“Yes, sir. I asked him various routine questions, but his manner was very uncertain and his replies were somewhat vague in character. At last he said, ‘You must understand, Superintendent, that I may be mistaken in this matter.’ I said, ‘I do not quite understand, sir. Either the diamonds are missing or they are not missing—one or the other.’ He replied, ‘The diamonds are certainly missing, but it is just possible, Superintendent, that their disappearance may be simply a rather foolish kind of practical joke.’ Well, that seemed odd to me, but I said nothing. He went on: ‘It is difficult for me to explain in detail, but what it amounts to is this: So far as I can see, only two persons can possibly have the stones. One of those persons might have done it as a joke. If the other person took them, then they have definitely been stolen.’ I said, ‘What exactly do you want me to do, sir?’ He said quickly, ‘I want you, Superintendent, to return here in about an hour—no, make it a little more than that—say nine fifteen. At that time I shall be able to tell you definitely whether I have been robbed or not.’ I was a little mystified, but I agreed and went away.”"|"Hercule Poirot's Christmas"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 09:15"|"nine fifteen"|"“I returned to the house, sir, at nine fifteen precisely. Just as I was about to ring the front door bell, I heard a scream from inside the house, and then a confused sound of shouts and a general commotion. I rang several times and also used the knocker. It was three or four minutes before the door was answered. When the footman at last opened it I could see that something momentous had occurred. He was shaking all over and looked as though he was about to faint. He gasped out that Mr. Lee had been murdered. I ran hastily upstairs. I found Mr. Lee’s room in a state of wild confusion. There had evidently been a severe struggle. Mr. Lee himself was lying in front of the fire with his throat cut in a pool of blood.”"|"Hercule Poirot's Christmas"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap < 08:00"|"just before eight o’clock"|"“It’s what I thought myself to begin with. But it’s difficult. There are eight servants in the house; six of them are women, and of those six, five have been here for four years and more. Then there’s the butler and the footman. The butler has been here for close on forty years—bit of a record that, I should say. The footman’s local, son of the gardener, and brought up here. Don’t see very well how he can be a professional. The only other person is Mr. Lee’s valet attendant. He’s comparatively new, but he was out of the house—still is—went out just before eight o’clock.”"|"Hercule Poirot's Christmas"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 01:00"|one|"Poirot said:
“Yes, there is a lot of blood—it strikes one, that. A lot of blood.”
Superintendent Sugden said respectfully:"|"Hercule Poirot's Christmas"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap ~ 05:45"|"about a quarter to six"|"“It was after tea. I was with him for a short time. Finally I said good night to him and left him at—let me see—about a quarter to six.”"|"Hercule Poirot's Christmas"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"“No. My father’s supper, a light meal, was always brought to him at seven. After that he sometimes went to bed early or sometimes sat up in his chair, but he did not expect to see any members of the family again unless he specially sent for them.”"|"Hercule Poirot's Christmas"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"“We had our dinner at eight o’clock. Dinner was over and my wife and the other ladies had gone into the drawing room.” His voice faltered. His eyes began to stare again. “We were sitting there—at the table . . . Suddenly there was the most astounding noise overheard. Chairs overturning, furniture crashing, breaking glass and china, and then—Oh, God”—he shuddered—“I can hear it still—my father screamed—a horrible, long-drawn scream—the scream of a man in mortal agony. . . .”"|"Hercule Poirot's Christmas"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"“Now, about this fellow, Horbury, the valet,” said the chief constable. “Are you definitely prepared to swear that he was out of the house by eight o’clock?”"|"Hercule Poirot's Christmas"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap >> 09:30"|"well after half past nine"|"“Not without passing through the kitchen, sir. And the kitchen would be occupied till well after half past nine or a quarter to ten.”"|"Hercule Poirot's Christmas"|"Agatha Christie"

"ap < 08:00"|"just before eight"|"“I left the house just before eight, sir. I went to the Superb, sir, just five minutes’ walk away. Love in Old Seville was the picture, sir.”"|"Hercule Poirot's Christmas"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap ~ 07:30"|"about half past seven"|"“It was about half past seven, sir. Mr. Lee had a light supper brought to him every evening at seven o’clock. I then prepared him for bed. After that he would sit in front of the fire in his dressing gown till he felt like going to bed.”"|"Hercule Poirot's Christmas"|"Agatha Christie"

"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"“It varied, sir. Sometimes he would go to bed as early as eight o’clock—that’s if he felt tired. Sometimes he would sit up till eleven or after.”"|"Hercule Poirot's Christmas"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"“No, sir. He preferred to be in just the one room. Mr. Lee wasn’t luxurious in his tastes. It was a big room with plenty of air and light in it.”
“Mr. Lee had his supper at seven, you say?”
“Yes, sir. I took the tray away and put out the sherry and two glasses on the bureau.”"|"Hercule Poirot's Christmas"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"“I heard the words robbery and diamonds, and I heard him say, ‘I don’t know who to suspect’—and I heard him say something about this evening at eight o’clock.”"|"Hercule Poirot's Christmas"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap ~ 05:10"|"About five ten"|"Superintendent Sugden nodded.
“That was to me he was speaking, my lad. About five ten, was it?”
“That’s right, sir.”"|"Hercule Poirot's Christmas"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"“Seems to me there are three possibilities: (1) Horbury’s a thief and a murderer. (2) Horbury’s a thief, but not a murderer. (3) Horbury’s an innocent man. Certain amount of evidence for (1). He overheard telephone call and knew the theft had been discovered. Gathered from old man’s manner that he was suspected. Made his plans accordingly. Went out ostentatiously at eight o’clock and cooked up an alibi. Easy enough to slip out of a cinema and return there unnoticed. He’d have to be pretty sure of the girl, though, that she wouldn’t give him away. I’ll see what I can get out of her tomorrow.”"|"Hercule Poirot's Christmas"|"Agatha Christie"

"ap 08:58"|"two minutes to nine"|"“Yes, I’ve had a certain amount of luck over the telephone calls. Mr. George Lee put through a call to Westeringham at two minutes to nine. That call lasted under six minutes.”"|"Hercule Poirot's Christmas"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 03:30"|3:30|"“3:30. Family gathering. Telephone conversation to lawyer overheard by all the family. Then the old man lets loose on his family, tells them where they all get off. They slink out like a lot of scared rabbits.”"|"Hercule Poirot's Christmas"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 08:59"|8:59|"“Quite so—quite so, Mr. Lee. We’re not disputing that point. Your call went through at 8:59 exactly.”"|"Hercule Poirot's Christmas"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 08:59"|8:59|"“Ah,” said Sugden. “But we can! We always check up on these things very carefully. Very carefully indeed. The call was put through at 8:59 and it was terminated at 9:4. Your father, Mr. Lee, was killed about 9:15. I must ask you once more for an account of your movements.”"|"Hercule Poirot's Christmas"|"Agatha Christie"

"< 20:00"|"just before eight that night"|"“No, you killed him before you left the house the first time. No one saw him alive after you left. It was all so easy for you. Simeon Lee expected you, yes, but he never sent for you. It was you who rang him up and spoke vaguely about an attempt at robbery. You said you would call upon him just before eight that night and would pretend to be collecting for a police charity. Simeon Lee had no suspicions. He did not know you were his son. You came and told him a tale of substituted diamonds. He opened the safe to show you that the real diamonds were safe in his possession. You apologized, came back to the hearth with him and, catching him unawares, you cut his throat, holding your hand over his mouth so that he shouldn’t cry out. Child’s play to a man of your powerful physique."|"Hercule Poirot's Christmas"|"Agatha Christie"
