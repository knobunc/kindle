"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"Miles smiled at her and she waved, but when he motioned for her to join him, she shook her head. It was unseasonably warm, and all around her, people were partying in that intensely determined way that happened only on New Year’s Eve after midnight: This will be the most fun we’ve ever had; we will do and say outrageous things; we are loving our lives and everyone around us. The massive hot tub was packed with a dozen revelers, all with drinks in hand, and another group sat around the perimeter, content to dangle their feet while they waited for a few inches of space to free up. On the deck above the pool a DJ blasted remixed hip-hop, and dancers everywhere—on the patio, in the pool, on the pool deck, streaming in and out of the house—all moved happily to his playlist. On the chair to Emily’s left, a young girl wearing only bikini bottoms straddled a guy and massaged his shoulders while her bare breasts dangled freely. She worked her way down his back and began a rather aggressive handling of his glutes. She was twenty-three, twenty-five at most, and while her body was far from perfect—slightly rounded belly and overly curvy thighs—her arms didn’t jiggle and her neck didn’t sag. No crepey anything. Just youth. None of the small indignities of Emily’s own body at thirty-six: light stretch marks on her hips; cleavage with just the smallest hint of sag; some errant dark hairs along her bikini line that just seemed to sprout now willy-nilly, indifferent to Emily’s indefatigable waxing schedule. It wasn’t a horror show, exactly—she still looked thin and tan, maybe even downright hot in her elegant Eres two-piece—but it was getting harder with every passing year."|"When Life Gives You Lululemons"|"Lauren Weisberger"

06:00|"six a.m."|"“The first flight out of here is six a.m. I’m going home to pack, and then I’ll head to the airport. The story will definitely break while I’m in the air, if not before. Do not—I repeat, do not—make a statement. Do not let him talk to anyone, not even the delivery guy who brings up the food. Information lockdown, you understand? No matter how bad the photos are, or how horrified the reaction—and trust me, it’s going to be bad—I want no response until I get there, okay?”"|"When Life Gives You Lululemons"|"Lauren Weisberger"
06:00|"six a.m."|"Emily knelt. “Of course I’m not mad. If you’re going to cheat, you better pick someone a hell of a lot hotter than that.” She nodded toward the girl, who looked not at all pleased with her wet hair. “I got a call from New York. It’s an emergency with Rizzo. I’m running home to get a bag and hopefully get to LAX for the six a.m. I’ll call you when I land, okay?”"|"When Life Gives You Lululemons"|"Lauren Weisberger"
07:00|"seven o’clock in the morning"|"But she had shown up! Wasn’t that what all the feel-good bloggers and motivational authors were always screeching about? No judgments, just show up! Show up and you’ve already won the battle! Don’t expect perfection—showing up is enough! “Fuckers,” she mumbled, streaming massive puffs of steam in the freezing January air. Motivating for a jog at seven o’clock in the morning on January 1—was more than just showing up. It was a downright triumph."|"When Life Gives You Lululemons"|"Lauren Weisberger"

15:00|"three in the afternoon"|"Emily followed her into the blindingly white lacquered kitchen where a uniformed Hispanic woman stood in front of a Starbucks-level espresso machine. “Clara, could we each get a flat white with a shot of Baileys, please?” If Clara thought it even a tiny bit strange that these two professional women were requesting a spiked coffee at three in the afternoon, she gave no indication.

The only men able to survive it were the ones older than eighty or too rich to even pretend to work anymore, but they didn’t spend their time in Starbucks. It was women as far as the eye could see. Women in their thirties, pushing strollers and chasing toddlers; in their forties, eking out every second before school let out at three; in their fifties, meeting for a cappuccino and a chat; in their sixties, accompanying their daughters and grandchildren. Nannies. Babysitters. The odd twentysomething who taught a local yoga or spin class. But not one damn man. Emily noticed how different it looked from L.A., where everyone was freelance and flexible and sort of working and sort of not. She missed L.A., but it was not missing her back.

Now Wednesdays at eight-fifteen were the new weekend: Paul worked from his home office that day and made it a point not to start until ten, since most other days he was up and out early.

Whether she was working eighty hours a week at Skadden or enjoying her new, more leisurely life, he was completely behind her.

"ap 00:30"|Twelve-thirty|"Miriam was scanning the room when she felt her phone vibrate. Worried that it was one of the kids’ schools, she pulled it out. A meeting reminder. She’d set it when she first started working at Skadden so she never forgot the weekly lunch meeting, where the partners would take turns presenting their case updates to everyone else. Twelve-thirty on the dot, every Wednesday. She had hated that meeting, absolutely dreaded it, but for some reason, she had never deleted the automatic reminder. Now she looked around the beautiful room at all the beautiful plants and the stylish women, nibbling gourmet treats and sipping morning cocktails, and she felt a pang of yearning for that drab conference room with its droning partners and dry turkey club sandwiches. Only for a split second. But still."|"When Life Gives You Lululemons"|"Lauren Weisberger"
17:00|"five in the afternoon"|"It wasn’t even five in the afternoon, but she was entirely alone: the caretaker couple had already called twice to ask if she needed them to return, but Karolina had insisted that she was fine by herself. A local woman came a couple mornings a week to clean, but she didn’t come on Fridays. With no choice but to actually leave her house, Karolina padded to the kitchen. Unable to resist, she swiped open her email on her iPad and scrolled through the new messages. She didn’t make it past the first one, a note from her aunt that contained only two items: an attached photo with a long chain of question marks preceding it. The quality was grainy, since her aunt had taken a picture of the picture using her phone and then emailed it—surely on the lowest resolution—to Karolina, but it didn’t take long to make out the players. Seated at Capitol Prime in D.C., known as the power lunch place for politicos, were Trip, Graham, and Joseph, Graham’s chief of staff. The interesting addition was the striking woman seated to Graham’s left. Regan. The Ice Queen. The camera caught her only in profile, but she was gazing at Graham while tossing her head back slightly and laughing. Graham was cutting his food and grinning a smile much wider than his grilled salmon probably warranted. All four wore business suits. To the normal onlooker, it appeared to be exactly what it was: a business lunch among colleagues. Your average Joe would not look at that photo and immediately think, Those two are fucking, but Karolina would bet her life they were. And so, obviously, would her aunt."|"When Life Gives You Lululemons"|"Lauren Weisberger"

She must have fallen asleep at some point, because when she woke up five hours later, it was nearly two in the morning and someone had turned off the lights and pulled up her covers. The memory came back: she had reached out to Graham to reconcile, to work through this horrible misunderstanding. She would apologize for thinking the worst of him; he would beg her forgiveness for leaving her overnight in jail. They would vow to get to the bottom of this whole situation together. As a team. She saw her phone sitting peacefully on the night table, charging with its ringer thoughtfully turned off. Miriam. Always considerate Miriam. No wonder she hadn’t heard him call back!

Every thirty seconds or so he would lift his head and look directly at Emily and give her that smile, the one that confirmed she was the only one in the room. Which of course she was, because she was riding on Karolina’s Peloton, and the hot instructor was on the screen, and his direct eye contact with Emily was actually shared with 1,294 other home riders. No matter. She could sweat with him and his alt-country playlist all night long. She had no idea what had inspired her to get off her ass in this beautiful, empty house and get on the bike at ten o’clock in the evening, but she was going with it. This beat SoulCycle any day of the week: no people, no socializing, and she could spin in her sports bra and a pair of ripped spandex shorts.

She took a long, deep sip and, realizing it tasted like cough medicine, poured the rest in the sink. The clock on the microwave read 10:28.

But then she tried to figure out what else she was doing at ten-thirty in the morning on a Friday. Or any day, really. Ashley had assured her a hundred times that it was fun and relaxed and super-casual—that everyone came in workout clothes—but Miriam knew better by now. Even though it took nearly an hour, she showered, shaved her legs, blew out and straightened her hair, applied full makeup, and dressed in a pair of newly ripped jeans and a rag & bone cold-shoulder sweater.
