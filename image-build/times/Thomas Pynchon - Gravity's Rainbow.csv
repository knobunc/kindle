               was a European. Not that it makes him unique among the Erdschweinhöhlers here: there’s
               German, Slavic and Gypsy blood mixed in by now too. Over the couple of generations,
               moved by accelerations unknown in the days before the Empire, they have been growing
               an identity that few can see as ever taking final shape. The Rocket will have a final
               shape, but not its people. Eanda and oruzo have lost their force out here—the bloodlines
               of mother and father were left behind, in Südwest. Many of the early emigrants had
               even gone over to the faith of the Rhenish Missionary Society long before they left.
               In each village, as noon flared the shadows in tightly to their owners, in that moment
               of terror and refuge, the omuhona took from his sacred bag, soul after converted soul,
               the leather cord kept there since the individual’s birth, and untied the birth-knot.
               Untied, it was another soul dead to the tribe. So today, in the Erdschweinhöhle, the
               Empty Ones each carry one knotless strip of leather: it is a bit of the old symbolism

               Džaqyp Qulan. Tchitcherine’s horse is a version of himself—an Appaloosa from the United
               States named Snake. Snake used to be some kind of remittance horse. Year before last
               he was in Saudi Arabia, being sent a check each month by a zany (or, if you enjoy
               paranoid systems, a horribly rational) Midland, Texas oil man to stay off of the U.S.
               rodeo circuits, where in those days the famous bucking bronco Midnight was flinging
               young men right and left into the sun-beat fences. But Snake here is not so much Midnight-wild
               as methodically homicidal. Worse, he’s unpredictable. When you go to ride him he may
               be indifferent, or docile as a maiden. But then again, with no warning, seized out
               of the last ruffling of a great sigh, he could manage to kill you simply as the gesture
               of a hoof, the serpent tuck of a head toward the exact moment and spot on the ground
               that you’ll cease to live. No way to tell: for months he can be no trouble at all.
               So far he’s ignored Tchitcherine. But he’s tried for Džaqyp Qulan three times. Twice
               dumb luck preserved the Kirghiz, and the third time he actually hung on and rode the
               colt a long time down to a fair kind of obedience. But each time Tchitcherine goes
               up to Snake’s jingling picket on the hillside, he carries, with his leather gear and
               his bit of scarred tapestry for the horse’s back, the doubt, the inconsolable chance
               that the Kirghiz didn’t really break him last time. That Snake is only waiting his

               of concrete and steel masses reflecting the noon heat. The air rippled like camouflage.

               on the eastern slopes of the Andes. According to an Argentine legend from the last

               not too much different from that of plants and animals, except for the time scale.
               Rock’s time scale is a lot more stretched out. “We’re talking frames per century,”
               Felipe like everybody else here lately has been using a bit of movie language, “per

               seldom do, that history as it’s been laid on the world is only a fraction, an outward-and-visible
               fraction. That we must also look to the untold, to the silence around us, to the passage

19:20|1920|"Säure got a lotta gall picking on other people’s language like this. One night, back
               when he was a second-story man, he had the incredible luck to break into the affluent
               home of Minne Khlaetsch, an astrologer of the Hamburg School, who was, congenitally
               it seems, unable to pronounce, even perceive, umlauts over vowels. That night she
               was just coming on to what would prove to be an overdose of Hieropon, when Säure,
               who back in those days was a curly-haired and good-looking kid, surprised her in her
               own bedroom with his hand around an ivory chess Läufer with a sarcastic smile on its
               face, and filled with good raw Peruvian cocaine still full of the Earth—“Don’t call
               for help,” advises Säure flashing his phony acid bottle, “or that pretty face goes
               flowing off of its bones like vanilla pudding.” But Minne calls his bluff, starts
               hollering for help to all the ladies of the same age in her building who feel that
               same motherly help-help-but-make-sure-there’s-time-for-him-to-rape-me ambivalence
               about nubile cat burglars. What she means to scream is “Hübsch Räuber! Hübsch Räuber!”
               which means “Cute-looking robber! Cute-looking robber!” But she can’t pronounce those
               umlauts. So it comes out “Hubschrauber! Hubschrauber!” which means “Helicopter! Helicopter!”
               well, it’s 1920-something, and nobody in earshot even knows what the word means, Liftscrewer,
               what’s that?—nobody except one finger-biting paranoid aerodynamics student in a tenement

               on to become “Spörri” of Horst Achtfaden’s confession to the Schwarzkommando. But
               he didn’t go to see what Minne was hollering about that night. She would’ve OD’d except
               for her boy friend Wimpe, an up-and-coming IG salesman covering the Eastern Territory,
               who’d blown into town after unexpectedly dumping all of his Oneirine samples on a
               party of American tourists back in hilltop Transylvania looking for a new kind of
               thrills—it’s me Liebchen, didn’t expect to be back so—but then he saw the sprawled

               of that other domestic incarnation will never see. Yet the continuity, flesh to kindred
               metals, home to hedgeless sea, has persisted. It is not death that separates these
               incarnations, but paper: paper specialties, paper routines. The War, the Empire, will
               expedite such barriers between our lives. The War needs to divide this way, and to
               subdivide, though its propaganda will always stress unity, alliance, pulling together.
               The War does not appear to want a folk-consciousness, not even of the sort the Germans
               have engineered, ein Volk ein Führer—it wants a machine of many separate parts, not
               oneness, but a complexity. . . . Yet who can presume to say what the War wants, so vast and aloof is it . . . so absentee. Perhaps the War isn’t even an awareness—not a life at all, really. There may only
               be some cruel, accidental resemblance to life. At “The White Visitation” there’s a
               longtime schiz, you know, who believes that he is World War II. He gets no newspapers, refuses to listen to the wireless, but still,
               the day of the Normandy invasion somehow his temperature shot up to 104°. Now, as
               the pincers east and west continue their slow reflex contraction, he speaks of darkness
               invading his mind, of an attrition of self. . . . The Rundstedt offensive perked him
               up though, gave him a new lease on life—“A beautiful Christmas gift,” he confessed
               to the resident on his ward, “it’s the season of birth, of fresh beginnings.” Whenever
               the rockets fall—those which are audible—he smiles, turns out to pace the ward, tears
               about to splash from the corners of his merry eyes, caught up in a ruddy high tonicity
               that can’t help cheering his fellow patients. His days are numbered. He’s to die on
               V-E Day. If he’s not in fact the War then he’s its child-surrogate, living high for
               a certain term but come the ceremonial day, look out. The true king only dies a mock
               death. Remember. Any number of young men may be selected to die in his place while
               the real king, foxy old bastard, goes on. Will he show up under the Star, slyly genuflecting
               with the other kings as this winter solstice draws on us? Bring to the serai gifts
               of tungsten, cordite, high-octane? Will the child gaze up from his ground of golden
               straw then, gaze into the eyes of the old king who bends long and unfurling overhead,
               leans to proffer his gift, will the eyes meet, and what message, what possible greeting
               or entente will flow between the king and the infant prince? Is the baby smiling,
               or is it just gas? Which do you want it to be?"|"Gravity's Rainbow"|"Thomas Pynchon"
02:30|vigils|"Advent blows from the sea, which at sunset tonight shone green and smooth as iron-rich
               glass: blows daily upon us, all the sky above pregnant with saints and slender heralds’
               trumpets. Another year of wedding dresses abandoned in the heart of winter, never
               called for, hanging in quiet satin ranks now, their white-crumpled veils begun to
               yellow, rippling slightly only at your passing, spectator . . . visitor to the city
               at all the dead ends. . . . Glimpsing in the gowns your own reflection once or twice,
               halfway from shadow, only blurred flesh-colors across the peau de soie, urging you
               in to where you can smell the mildew’s first horrible touch, which was really the
               idea—covering all trace of her own smell, middleclass bride-to-be perspiring, genteel
               soap and powder. But virgin in her heart, in her hopes. None of your bright-Swiss
               or crystalline season here, but darkly billowed in the day with cloud and the snow
               falling like gowns in the country, gowns of the winter, gentle at night, a nearly
               windless breathing around you. In the stations of the city the prisoners are back
               from Indo-China, wandering their poor visible bones, light as dreamers or men on the
               moon, among chrome-sprung prams of black hide resonant as drumheads, blonde wood high-chairs
               pink and blue with scraped and mush-spattered floral decals, folding-cots and bears
               with red felt tongues, baby-blankets making bright pastel clouds in the coal and steam
               smells, the metal spaces, among the queued, the drifting, the warily asleep, come
               by their hundreds in for the holidays, despite the warnings, the gravity of Mr. Morrison,
               the tube under the river a German rocket may pierce now, even now as the words are
               set down, the absences that may be waiting them, the city addresses that surely can
               no longer exist. The eyes from Burma, from Tonkin, watch these women at their hundred
               perseverances—stare out of blued orbits, through headaches no Alasils can ease. Italian
               P/Ws curse underneath the mail sacks that are puffing, echo-clanking in now each hour,
               in seasonal swell, clogging the snowy trainloads like mushrooms, as if the trains
               have been all night underground, passing through the country of the dead. If these
               Eyeties sing now and then you can bet it’s not “Giovinezza” but something probably
               from Rigoletto or La Bohème—indeed the Post Office is considering issuing a list of Nonacceptable Songs, with
               ukulele chords as an aid to ready identification. Their cheer and songfulness, this
               lot, is genuine up to a point—but as the days pile up, as this orgy of Christmas greeting
               grows daily beyond healthy limits, with no containment in sight before Boxing Day,
               they settle, themselves, for being more professionally Italian, rolling the odd eye
               at the lady evacuees, finding techniques of balancing the sack with one hand whilst
               the other goes playing “dead”—cioé, conditionally alive—where the crowds thicken most feminine, directionless . . .
               well, most promising. Life has to go on. Both kinds of prisoner recognize that, but
               there’s no mano morto for the Englishmen back from CBI, no leap from dead to living at mere permission
               from a likely haunch or thigh—no play, for God’s sake, about life-and-death! They want no more adventures: only the old
               dutch fussing over the old stove or warming the old bed, cricketers in the wintertime,
               they want the semi-detached Sunday dead-leaf somnolence of a dried garden. If the
               brave new world should also come about, a kind of windfall, why there’ll be time to
               adjust certainly to that. . . . But they want the nearly postwar luxury this week
               of buying an electric train set for the kid, trying that way each to light his own
               set of sleek little faces here, calibrating his strangeness, well-known photographs
               all, brought to life now, oohs and aahs but not yet, not here in the station, any
               of the moves most necessary: the War has shunted them, earthed them, those heedless
               destroying signalings of love. The children have unfolded last year’s toys and found
               reincarnated Spam tins, they’re hep this may be the other and, who knows, unavoidable
               side to the Christmas game. In the months between—country springs and summers—they
               played with real Spam tins—tanks, tank-destroyers, pillboxes, dreadnoughts deploying
               meat-pink, yellow and blue about the dusty floors of lumber-rooms or butteries, under
               the cots or couches of their exile. Now it’s time again. The plaster baby, the oxen
               frosted with gold leaf and the human-eyed sheep are turning real again, paint quickens
               to flesh. To believe is not a price they pay—it happens all by itself. He is the New
               Baby. On the magic night before, the animals will talk, and the sky will be milk.
               The grandparents, who’ve waited each week for the Radio Doctor asking, What Are Piles?
               What Is Emphysema? What Is A Heart Attack? will wait up beyond insomnia, watching
               again for the yearly impossible not to occur, but with some mean residue—this is the hillside, the sky can show us a light—like a thrill, a good time you wanted too much, not a complete loss
               but still too far short of a miracle . . . keeping their sweatered and shawled vigils,
               theatrically bitter, but with the residue inside going through a new winter fermentation
               every year, each time a bit less, but always good for a revival at this season. . . .
               All but naked now, the shiny suits and gowns of their pubcrawling primes long torn
               to strips for lagging the hot-water pipes and heaters of landlords, strangers, for
               holding the houses’ identities against the winter. The War needs coal. They have taken
               the next-to-last steps, attended the Radio Doctor’s certifications of what they knew
               in their bodies, and at Christmas they are naked as geese under this woolen, murky,
               cheap old-people’s swaddling. Their electric clocks run fast, even Big Ben will be
               fast now until the new spring’s run in, all fast, and no one else seems to understand
               or to care. The War needs electricity. It’s a lively game, Electric Monopoly, among
               the power companies, the Central Electricity Board, and other War agencies, to keep
               Grid Time synchronized with Greenwich Mean Time. In the night, the deepest concrete
               wells of night, dynamos whose locations are classified spin faster, and so, responding,
               the clock-hands next to all the old, sleepless eyes—gathering in their minutes whining,
               pitching higher toward the vertigo of a siren. It is the Night’s Mad Carnival. There
               is merriment under the shadows of the minute-hands. Hysteria in the pale faces between
               the numerals. The power companies speak of loads, war-drains so vast the clocks will
               slow again unless this nighttime march is stolen, but the loads expected daily do
               not occur, and the Grid runs inching ever faster, and the old faces turn to the clock
               faces, thinking plot, and the numbers go whirling toward the Nativity, a violence, a nova of heart that
               will turn us all, change us forever to the very forgotten roots of who we are. But
               over the sea the fog tonight still is quietly scalloped pearl. Up in the city the
               arc-lamps crackle, furious, in smothered blaze up the centerlines of the streets,
               too ice-colored for candles, too chill-dropleted for holocaust . . . the tall red
               busses sway, all the headlamps by regulation newly unmasked now parry, cross, traverse
               and blind, torn great fistfuls of wetness blow by, desolate as the beaches beneath
               the nacre fog, whose barbed wire that never knew the inward sting of current, that
               only lay passive, oxidizing in the night, now weaves like underwater grass, looped,
               bitter cold, sharp as the scorpion, all the printless sand miles past cruisers abandoned
               in the last summers of peacetime that once holidayed the old world away, wine and
               olive-grove and pipe-smoke evenings away the other side of the War, stripped now to
               rust axles and brackets and smelling inside of the same brine as this beach you cannot
               really walk, because of the War. Up across the downs, past the spotlights where the
               migrant birds in autumn choked the beams night after night, fatally held till they
               dropped exhausted out of the sky, a shower of dead birds, the compline worshipers
               sit in the unheated church, shivering, voiceless as the choir asks: where are the
               joys? Where else but there where the Angels sing new songs and the bells ring out
               in the court of the King. Eia—strange thousand-year sigh—eia, wärn wir da! were we but there. . . . The tired men and their black bellwether reaching as far
               as they can, as far from their sheeps’ clothing as the year will let them stray. Come
               then. Leave your war awhile, paper or iron war, petrol or flesh, come in with your
               love, your fear of losing, your exhaustion with it. All day it’s been at you, coercing,
               jiving, claiming your belief in so much that isn’t true. Is that who you are, that
               vaguely criminal face on your ID card, its soul snatched by the government camera
               as the guillotine shutter fell—or maybe just left behind with your heart, at the Stage
               Door Canteen, where they’re counting the night’s take, the NAAFI girls, the girls
               named Eileen, carefully sorting into refrigerated compartments the rubbery maroon
               organs with their yellow garnishes of fat—oh Linda come here feel this one, put your
               finger down in the ventricle here, isn’t it swoony, it’s still going. . . . Everybody you don’t suspect is in on this, everybody but you: the chaplain, the doctor,
               your mother hoping to hang that Gold Star, the vapid soprano last night on the Home
               Service programme, let’s not forget Mr. Noel Coward so stylish and cute about death
               and the afterlife, packing them into the Duchess for the fourth year running, the
               lads in Hollywood telling us how grand it all is over here, how much fun, Walt Disney
               causing Dumbo the elephant to clutch to that feather like how many carcasses under
               the snow tonight among the white-painted tanks, how many hands each frozen around
               a Miraculous Medal, lucky piece of worn bone, half-dollar with the grinning sun peering
               up under Liberty’s wispy gown, clutching, dumb, when the 88 fell—what do you think,
               it’s a children’s story? There aren’t any. The children are away dreaming, but the
               Empire has no place for dreams and it’s Adults Only in here tonight, here in this
               refuge with the lamps burning deep, in pre-Cambrian exhalation, savory as food cooking,
               heavy as soot. And 60 miles up the rockets hanging the measureless instant over the
               black North Sea before the fall, ever faster, to orange heat, Christmas star, in helpless
               plunge to Earth. Lower in the sky the flying bombs are out too, roaring like the Adversary,
               seeking whom they may devour. It’s a long walk home tonight. Listen to this mock-angel
               singing, let your communion be at least in listening, even if they are not spokesmen
               for your exact hopes, your exact, darkest terror, listen. There must have been evensong
               here long before the news of Christ. Surely for as long as there have been nights
               bad as this one—something to raise the possibility of another night that could actually,
               with love and cockcrows, light the path home, banish the Adversary, destroy the boundaries
               between our lands, our bodies, our stories, all false, about who we are: for the one
               night, leaving only the clear way home and the memory of the infant you saw, almost
               too frail, there’s too much shit in these streets, camels and other beasts stir heavily
               outside, each hoof a chance to wipe him out, make him only another Messiah, and sure
               somebody’s around already taking bets on that one, while here in this town the Jewish
               collaborators are selling useful gossip to Imperial Intelligence, and the local hookers
               are keeping the foreskinned invaders happy, charging whatever the traffic will bear,
               just like the innkeepers who’re naturally delighted with this registration thing,
               and up in the capital they’re wondering should they, maybe, give everybody a number, yeah, something to help SPQR Record-keeping . . . and Herod or Hitler, fellas (the
               chaplains out in the Bulge are manly, haggard, hard drinkers), what kind of a world
               is it (“You forgot Roosevelt, padre,” come the voices from the back, the good father
               can never see them, they harass him, these tempters, even into his dreams: “Wendell
               Willkie!” “How about Churchill?”“‘Arry Pollitt!”) for a baby to come in tippin’ those
               Toledos at 7 pounds 8 ounces thinkin’ he’s gonna redeem it, why, he oughta have his

               again for the yearly impossible not to occur, but with some mean residue—this is the hillside, the sky can show us a light—like a thrill, a good time you wanted too much, not a complete loss
               but still too far short of a miracle . . . keeping their sweatered and shawled vigils,
               theatrically bitter, but with the residue inside going through a new winter fermentation
               every year, each time a bit less, but always good for a revival at this season. . . .
               All but naked now, the shiny suits and gowns of their pubcrawling primes long torn
               to strips for lagging the hot-water pipes and heaters of landlords, strangers, for
               holding the houses’ identities against the winter. The War needs coal. They have taken
               the next-to-last steps, attended the Radio Doctor’s certifications of what they knew
               in their bodies, and at Christmas they are naked as geese under this woolen, murky,
               cheap old-people’s swaddling. Their electric clocks run fast, even Big Ben will be
               fast now until the new spring’s run in, all fast, and no one else seems to understand
               or to care. The War needs electricity. It’s a lively game, Electric Monopoly, among
               the power companies, the Central Electricity Board, and other War agencies, to keep
               Grid Time synchronized with Greenwich Mean Time. In the night, the deepest concrete
               wells of night, dynamos whose locations are classified spin faster, and so, responding,
               the clock-hands next to all the old, sleepless eyes—gathering in their minutes whining,
               pitching higher toward the vertigo of a siren. It is the Night’s Mad Carnival. There
               is merriment under the shadows of the minute-hands. Hysteria in the pale faces between
               the numerals. The power companies speak of loads, war-drains so vast the clocks will
               slow again unless this nighttime march is stolen, but the loads expected daily do
               not occur, and the Grid runs inching ever faster, and the old faces turn to the clock
               faces, thinking plot, and the numbers go whirling toward the Nativity, a violence, a nova of heart that
               will turn us all, change us forever to the very forgotten roots of who we are. But
               over the sea the fog tonight still is quietly scalloped pearl. Up in the city the
               arc-lamps crackle, furious, in smothered blaze up the centerlines of the streets,
               too ice-colored for candles, too chill-dropleted for holocaust . . . the tall red
               busses sway, all the headlamps by regulation newly unmasked now parry, cross, traverse
               and blind, torn great fistfuls of wetness blow by, desolate as the beaches beneath
               the nacre fog, whose barbed wire that never knew the inward sting of current, that
               only lay passive, oxidizing in the night, now weaves like underwater grass, looped,
               bitter cold, sharp as the scorpion, all the printless sand miles past cruisers abandoned
               in the last summers of peacetime that once holidayed the old world away, wine and
               olive-grove and pipe-smoke evenings away the other side of the War, stripped now to
               rust axles and brackets and smelling inside of the same brine as this beach you cannot
               really walk, because of the War. Up across the downs, past the spotlights where the
               migrant birds in autumn choked the beams night after night, fatally held till they
               dropped exhausted out of the sky, a shower of dead birds, the compline worshipers
               sit in the unheated church, shivering, voiceless as the choir asks: where are the
               joys? Where else but there where the Angels sing new songs and the bells ring out
               in the court of the King. Eia—strange thousand-year sigh—eia, wärn wir da! were we but there. . . . The tired men and their black bellwether reaching as far
               as they can, as far from their sheeps’ clothing as the year will let them stray. Come
               then. Leave your war awhile, paper or iron war, petrol or flesh, come in with your
               love, your fear of losing, your exhaustion with it. All day it’s been at you, coercing,
               jiving, claiming your belief in so much that isn’t true. Is that who you are, that
               vaguely criminal face on your ID card, its soul snatched by the government camera
               as the guillotine shutter fell—or maybe just left behind with your heart, at the Stage
               Door Canteen, where they’re counting the night’s take, the NAAFI girls, the girls
               named Eileen, carefully sorting into refrigerated compartments the rubbery maroon
               organs with their yellow garnishes of fat—oh Linda come here feel this one, put your
               finger down in the ventricle here, isn’t it swoony, it’s still going. . . . Everybody you don’t suspect is in on this, everybody but you: the chaplain, the doctor,
               your mother hoping to hang that Gold Star, the vapid soprano last night on the Home
               Service programme, let’s not forget Mr. Noel Coward so stylish and cute about death
               and the afterlife, packing them into the Duchess for the fourth year running, the
               lads in Hollywood telling us how grand it all is over here, how much fun, Walt Disney
               causing Dumbo the elephant to clutch to that feather like how many carcasses under
               the snow tonight among the white-painted tanks, how many hands each frozen around
               a Miraculous Medal, lucky piece of worn bone, half-dollar with the grinning sun peering
               up under Liberty’s wispy gown, clutching, dumb, when the 88 fell—what do you think,
               it’s a children’s story? There aren’t any. The children are away dreaming, but the
               Empire has no place for dreams and it’s Adults Only in here tonight, here in this
               refuge with the lamps burning deep, in pre-Cambrian exhalation, savory as food cooking,
               heavy as soot. And 60 miles up the rockets hanging the measureless instant over the
               black North Sea before the fall, ever faster, to orange heat, Christmas star, in helpless
               plunge to Earth. Lower in the sky the flying bombs are out too, roaring like the Adversary,
               seeking whom they may devour. It’s a long walk home tonight. Listen to this mock-angel
               singing, let your communion be at least in listening, even if they are not spokesmen
               for your exact hopes, your exact, darkest terror, listen. There must have been evensong
               here long before the news of Christ. Surely for as long as there have been nights
               bad as this one—something to raise the possibility of another night that could actually,
               with love and cockcrows, light the path home, banish the Adversary, destroy the boundaries
               between our lands, our bodies, our stories, all false, about who we are: for the one
               night, leaving only the clear way home and the memory of the infant you saw, almost
               too frail, there’s too much shit in these streets, camels and other beasts stir heavily
               outside, each hoof a chance to wipe him out, make him only another Messiah, and sure
               somebody’s around already taking bets on that one, while here in this town the Jewish
               collaborators are selling useful gossip to Imperial Intelligence, and the local hookers
               are keeping the foreskinned invaders happy, charging whatever the traffic will bear,
               just like the innkeepers who’re naturally delighted with this registration thing,
               and up in the capital they’re wondering should they, maybe, give everybody a number, yeah, something to help SPQR Record-keeping . . . and Herod or Hitler, fellas (the
               chaplains out in the Bulge are manly, haggard, hard drinkers), what kind of a world
               is it (“You forgot Roosevelt, padre,” come the voices from the back, the good father
               can never see them, they harass him, these tempters, even into his dreams: “Wendell
               Willkie!” “How about Churchill?”“‘Arry Pollitt!”) for a baby to come in tippin’ those
               Toledos at 7 pounds 8 ounces thinkin’ he’s gonna redeem it, why, he oughta have his
               head examined. . . ."|"Gravity's Rainbow"|"Thomas Pynchon"
"~ 16:30"|evensong|"Advent blows from the sea, which at sunset tonight shone green and smooth as iron-rich
               glass: blows daily upon us, all the sky above pregnant with saints and slender heralds’
               trumpets. Another year of wedding dresses abandoned in the heart of winter, never
               called for, hanging in quiet satin ranks now, their white-crumpled veils begun to
               yellow, rippling slightly only at your passing, spectator . . . visitor to the city
               at all the dead ends. . . . Glimpsing in the gowns your own reflection once or twice,
               halfway from shadow, only blurred flesh-colors across the peau de soie, urging you
               in to where you can smell the mildew’s first horrible touch, which was really the
               idea—covering all trace of her own smell, middleclass bride-to-be perspiring, genteel
               soap and powder. But virgin in her heart, in her hopes. None of your bright-Swiss
               or crystalline season here, but darkly billowed in the day with cloud and the snow
               falling like gowns in the country, gowns of the winter, gentle at night, a nearly
               windless breathing around you. In the stations of the city the prisoners are back
               from Indo-China, wandering their poor visible bones, light as dreamers or men on the
               moon, among chrome-sprung prams of black hide resonant as drumheads, blonde wood high-chairs
               pink and blue with scraped and mush-spattered floral decals, folding-cots and bears
               with red felt tongues, baby-blankets making bright pastel clouds in the coal and steam
               smells, the metal spaces, among the queued, the drifting, the warily asleep, come
               by their hundreds in for the holidays, despite the warnings, the gravity of Mr. Morrison,
               the tube under the river a German rocket may pierce now, even now as the words are
               set down, the absences that may be waiting them, the city addresses that surely can
               no longer exist. The eyes from Burma, from Tonkin, watch these women at their hundred
               perseverances—stare out of blued orbits, through headaches no Alasils can ease. Italian
               P/Ws curse underneath the mail sacks that are puffing, echo-clanking in now each hour,
               in seasonal swell, clogging the snowy trainloads like mushrooms, as if the trains
               have been all night underground, passing through the country of the dead. If these
               Eyeties sing now and then you can bet it’s not “Giovinezza” but something probably
               from Rigoletto or La Bohème—indeed the Post Office is considering issuing a list of Nonacceptable Songs, with
               ukulele chords as an aid to ready identification. Their cheer and songfulness, this
               lot, is genuine up to a point—but as the days pile up, as this orgy of Christmas greeting
               grows daily beyond healthy limits, with no containment in sight before Boxing Day,
               they settle, themselves, for being more professionally Italian, rolling the odd eye
               at the lady evacuees, finding techniques of balancing the sack with one hand whilst
               the other goes playing “dead”—cioé, conditionally alive—where the crowds thicken most feminine, directionless . . .
               well, most promising. Life has to go on. Both kinds of prisoner recognize that, but
               there’s no mano morto for the Englishmen back from CBI, no leap from dead to living at mere permission
               from a likely haunch or thigh—no play, for God’s sake, about life-and-death! They want no more adventures: only the old
               dutch fussing over the old stove or warming the old bed, cricketers in the wintertime,
               they want the semi-detached Sunday dead-leaf somnolence of a dried garden. If the
               brave new world should also come about, a kind of windfall, why there’ll be time to
               adjust certainly to that. . . . But they want the nearly postwar luxury this week
               of buying an electric train set for the kid, trying that way each to light his own
               set of sleek little faces here, calibrating his strangeness, well-known photographs
               all, brought to life now, oohs and aahs but not yet, not here in the station, any
               of the moves most necessary: the War has shunted them, earthed them, those heedless
               destroying signalings of love. The children have unfolded last year’s toys and found
               reincarnated Spam tins, they’re hep this may be the other and, who knows, unavoidable
               side to the Christmas game. In the months between—country springs and summers—they
               played with real Spam tins—tanks, tank-destroyers, pillboxes, dreadnoughts deploying
               meat-pink, yellow and blue about the dusty floors of lumber-rooms or butteries, under
               the cots or couches of their exile. Now it’s time again. The plaster baby, the oxen
               frosted with gold leaf and the human-eyed sheep are turning real again, paint quickens
               to flesh. To believe is not a price they pay—it happens all by itself. He is the New
               Baby. On the magic night before, the animals will talk, and the sky will be milk.

               middle age, men fattening despite their hunger, flatulent because of it, pre-ulcerous,
               hoarse, runny-nosed, red-eyed, sore-throated, piss-swollen men suffering from acute
               lower backs and all-day hangovers, wishing death on officers they truly hate, men

               for strangers, give you this evensong, climaxing now with its rising fragment of some
               ancient scale, voices overlapping three- and fourfold, up, echoing, filling the entire
               hollow of the church—no counterfeit baby, no announcement of the Kingdom, not even
               a try at warming or lighting this terrible night, only, damn us, our scruffy obligatory
               little cry, our maximum reach outward—praise be to God!—for you to take back to your war-address, your war-identity, across the snow’s footprints
               and tire tracks finally to the path you must create by yourself, alone in the dark.
               Whether you want it or not, whatever seas you have crossed, the way home. . . ."|"Gravity's Rainbow"|"Thomas Pynchon"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"Paradoxical phase, when weak stimuli get strong responses. . . . When did it happen?
               A certain early stage of sleep: you had not heard the Mosquitoes and Lancasters tonight
               on route to Germany, their engines battering apart the sky, shaking and ripping it,
               for a full hour, a few puffs of winter cloud drifting below the steel-riveted underside
               of the night, vibrating with the constancy, the terror, of so many bombers outward
               bound. Your own form immobile, mouth-breathing, alone face-up on the narrow cot next
               to the wall so pictureless, chartless, mapless: so habitually blank. . . . Your feet pointed toward a high slit window at the far end of the room. Starlight,
               the steady sound of the bombers’ departure, icy air seeping in. The table littered
               with broken-spined books, scribbled columns headed Time / Stimulus / Secretion (30 sec) / Remarks, teacups, saucers, pencils, pens. You slept, you dreamed: thousands of feet above
               your face the steel bombers passed, wave after wave. It was indoors, some great place
               of assembly. Many people were gathered. In recent days, at certain hours, a round
               white light, quite intense, has gone sliding along and down in a straight line through
               the air. Here, suddenly, it appears again, its course linear as always, right to left.
               But this time it isn’t constant—instead it lights up brilliantly in short bursts or
               jangles. The apparition, this time, is taken by those present as a warning—something
               wrong, drastically wrong, with the day. . . . No one knew what the round light signified.
               A commission had been appointed, an investigation under way, the answer tantalizingly
               close—but now the light’s behavior has changed. . . . The assembly adjourns. On seeing
               the light jangling this way, you begin to wait for something terrible—not exactly
               an air raid but something close to that. You look quickly over at a clock. It’s six
               on the dot, hands perfectly straight up and down, and you understand that six is the
               hour of the appearance of the light. You walk out into the evening. It’s the street
               before your childhood home: stony, rutted and cracked, water shining in puddles. You
               set out to the left. (Usually in these dreams of home you prefer the landscape to
               the right—broad night-lawns, towered over by ancient walnut trees, a hill, a wooden
               fence, hollow-eyed horses in a field, a cemetery. . . . Your task, in these dreams,
               is often to pens. Often you go into the fallow field just below the graveyard, full
               of autumn brambles and rabbits, where the gypsies live. Sometimes you fly. But you
               can never rise above a certain height. You may feel yourself being slowed, coming
               inexorably to a halt: not the keen terror of falling, only an interdiction, from which
               there is no appeal . . . and as the landscape begins to dim out . . . you know . . . that . . .) But this evening, this six o’clock of the round light, you have set out leftward
               instead. With you is a girl identified as your wife, though you were never married,
               have never seen her before yet have known her for years. She doesn’t speak. It’s just
               after a rain. Everything glimmers, edges are extremely clear, illumination is low
               and very pure. Small clusters of white flowers peep out wherever you look. Everything
               blooms. You catch another glimpse of the round light, following its downward slant,
               a brief blink on and off. Despite the apparent freshness, recent rain, flower-life,
               the scene disturbs you. You try to pick up some fresh odor to correspond to what you
               see, but cannot. Everything is silent, odorless. Because of the light’s behavior something
               is going to happen, and you can only wait. The landscape shines. Wetness on the pavement.
               Settling a warm kind of hood around the back of your neck and shoulders, you are about
               to remark to your wife, “This is the most sinister time of evening.” But there’s a
               better word than “sinister.” You search for it. It is someone’s name. It waits behind
               the twilight, the clarity, the white flowers. There comes a light tapping at the door."|"Gravity's Rainbow"|"Thomas Pynchon"

               in Katje’s direction.
