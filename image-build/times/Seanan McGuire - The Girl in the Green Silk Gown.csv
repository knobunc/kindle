00:00|midnight|"Below the twilight you have the starlight, and under that you have the midnight, and if those seem like trite ways to label a place that isn’t a place, one that predates our current ideas about the living and the dead, remember that the dead are still people. We get to be trite and simplistic and weird. There are sublevels, slices where the light varies, where the ghosts of stars shine a little brighter or disappear altogether, but those are the big ones."|"The Girl in the Green Silk Gown"|"Seanan McGuire"
"ap 02:40"|"third of three"|"I was born in 1936, third of three and the only girl in a house that seemed to consist more of draft than timber. Daddy made it eight years before the pressure got to be too much and he split. He’s got to be dead by now, one more phantom drifting somewhere out there in the void, and he must have heard that his darling girl went and made something of herself, me, Rosie Marshall, the Phantom Prom Date, the Girl in the Green Silk Gown. Me, Rosie Marshall, who broke every rule and somehow kept on going. If he’s impressed by what I grew up to be, he’s never cared enough to come and tell me about it. That’s all right. I got here without him. I sure don’t need him now."|"The Girl in the Green Silk Gown"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"See, those of us who stay here in the twilight, or even down as far as the midnight, and on all the layers in-between, we’re really like . . . kids playing house before they put their toys away and go home for the night. We’re playing out the last vestiges of our mortality, dealing with the unfinished business we should have taken care of before we died. Once we get tired of the game, we go past the last exit on the ghostroads, past the diners and the rest stops and the way stations we build to keep our hearts happy while our souls look for peace, and that’s all she’s wrote for the dead who walk among the living. People who go past the end of the road don’t come back."|"The Girl in the Green Silk Gown"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"I’d stay if I could, Emma. Persephone knows, I’d stay if I could. But I can’t, I can’t, I’m going; the parking lot is turning hazy, red glare turning into red absolutely everything, the world washed in blood, the world become blood, and then even that is gone, replaced by blackness so profound that it has neither beginning nor end. It’s like the sky has been stripped from the midnight, divested of stars and wrapped around me, a shroud secure enough to bind the dead."|"The Girl in the Green Silk Gown"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"This is new. Also new: the utter absence of anything resembling a road. I’m in the twilight, no question of that, not with the sky like a bruise and the corn whispering unforgivable secrets on every side, but the ghostroads aren’t here to meet me. I can’t go up. I try to drop down into the starlight or the midnight, and I can’t do that either."|"The Girl in the Green Silk Gown"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"“Halloween will cast you in skin again, make it so the world fixes its eyes on you. The road will remember your name, and it’ll read the power you’ve collected for what it is. That means that when the clock strikes midnight and the night officially ends, you’ll be your own sacrifice, and that sacrifice will be greater than Dana’s. It’ll be enough to burn the blood away. It’s all about power, and putting the distance you carry on your skin to work.”"|"The Girl in the Green Silk Gown"|"Seanan McGuire"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"She makes me stand against the hallway wall with a blank expression on my face while she snaps half a dozen photographs and sends them to her contact. Then she ushers me back inside and boils a box of macaroni on the stove, mixing it with cheese powder, milk, and margarine until she has something she says is Kraft dinner. Nothing about it tastes like the Kraft dinner I remember. The cheese is too sweet and the macaroni is too starchy. But it’s food, and it fills my stomach, and by the time we finish, she has a note from the “pizza delivery service,” telling her she can pick up my new ID in front of the library tomorrow morning at eight."|"The Girl in the Green Silk Gown"|"Seanan McGuire"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"“We’re picking up your ID in half an hour, and the Target is right around the corner from the drop point. Then we come back here, shower, and catch a cab to the airport. Our flight leaves at eight. We’ll be in Maine by midnight.”"|"The Girl in the Green Silk Gown"|"Seanan McGuire"

00:00|midnight|"How fast the human world has become while I wasn’t looking. They’ve taken distance and boiled it down to minutes, stripping away the magic of the journey in favor of the destination. I can’t blame them—time is so precious here, and Maine by midnight sounds like an impossibility beyond all measure. I nod, still silent, and take another bite of granola bar."|"The Girl in the Green Silk Gown"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"I nod, still silent, trying to digest everything that’s happened since this day began. Natural midnight presses in around us, thick as velvet, darkness spangled with glittering stars. I don’t want to look at the shoulder of the road if I can help it. This is a night for hitchers and homecomers, for ghosts looking for a little warmth, and I don’t want to see them. I don’t want to be reminded that existence in the twilight is going on like it always has while I’m still trapped out here."|"The Girl in the Green Silk Gown"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"Odds are good that whatever road we find at midnight wouldn’t be visible at noon, because there are ways to drive off the map without entering the twilight, ways to blend the levels of reality. I don’t know how I know them, I just do, and always have. Maybe that’s another point of proof for the assertion that I should have been a routewitch. I don’t know."|"The Girl in the Green Silk Gown"|"Seanan McGuire"

23:59|"a minute to midnight"|"The enthusiasm fades as I continue to work, replaced first by concentration, and then, slowly, so slowly that I barely notice it happening, by habit. It’s been decades since I stood on this side of a broom, but there are things the body never forgets, not in life and not in death. I may be the girl in the green silk gown now—and sweet Persephone, I miss that dress, I miss it like I never thought I would or could, like it’s the answer to a question I never realized I was asking; I, the Cinderella girl from the wrong side of town, trapping herself a minute to midnight for sixty years, so the clock could never chime and the spell would never end—but I was little Rosie Marshall once. My mother was trash and so was I, at least if you asked the kids I grew up with, the ones whose awareness of the social structure was even more set in stone than that of their parents. The adults in Buckley might have been willing to see me as a child, worthy of protection, worthy of a chance, at least until puberty brought me the breasts that meant I was going to be exactly like my mother, and no better than I should have been. Their offspring were never that generous."|"The Girl in the Green Silk Gown"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|Midnight|"“Midnight came and midnight went, and you were left among the living.” Persephone sounds thoughtful. I hear her move behind me, coming closer to Laura, and I ache for her proximity, even as I allow myself to breathe in relief that she isn’t touching me anymore."|"The Girl in the Green Silk Gown"|"Seanan McGuire"
00:00|midnight|"Bela da meia-noite. The bela da meia-noite, or “midnight beauty,” is an exclusively female type of ghost, capable of appearing only between sunset and midnight. They enjoy trendy clubs and one-night stands. They’re generally harmless, and some have proven very helpful in exorcising hostile spirits, since they’d prefer that no one get hurt."|"The Girl in the Green Silk Gown"|"Seanan McGuire"
