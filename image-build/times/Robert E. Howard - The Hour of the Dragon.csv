00:00|midnight|"Many men passed through the great arched gates of Tarantia between sunset and midnight—belated travelers, merchants from afar with heavily laden mules, free workmen from the surrounding farms and vineyards. Now that Valerius was supreme in the central provinces, there was no rigid scrutiny of the folk who flowed in a steady stream through the wide gates. Discipline had been relaxed. The Nemedian soldiers who stood on guard were half drunk, and much too busy watching for handsome peasant girls and rich merchants who could be bullied to notice workmen or dusty travelers, even one tall wayfarer whose worn cloak could not conceal the hard lines of his powerful frame."|"The Hour of the Dragon"|"Robert E. Howard"
00:00|Midnight|"‘You are not as prompt as your predecessor, master headsman,’ he grumbled. ‘Midnight has just struck, and masked men have gone to milady’s cell. They await you.’"|"The Hour of the Dragon"|"Robert E. Howard"
">> 00:00"|"long after midnight"|"A broad red moon was shining through the trees, by which he knew that it was long after midnight. He had lain senseless for hours, long enough to have recovered from that terrible blow Beloso had dealt him, as well as the fall which had rendered him senseless. His brain felt clearer than it had felt during that mad ride after the fugitive."|"The Hour of the Dragon"|"Robert E. Howard"
00:00|midnight|"The others obeyed hesitantly, as if reluctant to touch the man they had recreated, and they seemed not easier in their minds when they felt firm muscular flesh, vibrant with blood and life, beneath their fingers. But they lifted him upon the table, and Orastes clothed him in a curious dark velvet robe, splashed with gold stars and crescent moons, and fastened a cloth-of-gold fillet about his temples, confining the black wavy locks that fell to his shoulders. He let them do as they would, saying nothing, not even when they set him in a carven throne-like chair with a high ebony back and wide silver arms, and feet like golden claws. He sat there motionless, and slowly intelligence grew in his dark eyes and made them deep and strange and luminous. It was as if long-sunken witchlights floated slowly up through midnight pools of darkness."|"The Hour of the Dragon"|"Robert E. Howard"
00:00|midnight|"That last command was unnecessary. No man in that host could have been bribed to approach that mysterious black silken pavilion, the door-flaps of which were always closely drawn. None but Xaltotun ever entered it, yet voices were often heard issuing from it; its walls billowed sometimes without a wind, and weird music came from it. Sometimes, deep in midnight, its silken walls were lit red by flames flickering within, limning misshapen silhouettes that passed to and fro."|"The Hour of the Dragon"|"Robert E. Howard"
"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"They crossed by the flare of torches. The hoofs of the horses clinked on the rocky bridge, splashed through the shallows. The glint of the torches on shields and breast-plates was reflected redly in the black water. The rock bridge was broad on which they crossed, but even so it was past midnight before the host was camped in the plain beyond. Above them they could see fires winking redly in the distance. Conan had turned at bay in the Goralian hills, which had more than once before served as the last stand of an Aquilonian king."|"The Hour of the Dragon"|"Robert E. Howard"
"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"‘Five thousand should be enough,’ answered Amalric. ‘A surprise attack on their rear will throw them into confusion, and that will be enough. I shall expect your attack about noon.’"|"The Hour of the Dragon"|"Robert E. Howard"
12:00|noonday|"He rode straight on toward the sound of the distant drum as one who knows his ground at last. Valerius followed, cursing the fog. Then it occurred to him that it would mask his advance. Conan could not see him coming. He would be at the Cimmerian’s back before the noonday sun dispelled the mists."|"The Hour of the Dragon"|"Robert E. Howard"
"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"‘Haste!’ she whispered urgently. ‘It is past midnight. You must be gone.’"|"The Hour of the Dragon"|"Robert E. Howard"
00:00|midnight|"‘Because she would not become the mistress of Valerius. Her lands are forfeit, her henchmen sold into slavery, and at midnight, in the Iron Tower, her head must fall. Be advised, my king—to me you will ever be my king—and flee before you are discovered. In these days none is safe. Spies and informers creep among us, betraying the slightest deed or word of discontent as treason and rebellion. If you make yourself known to your subjects it will only end in your capture and death."|"The Hour of the Dragon"|"Robert E. Howard"
