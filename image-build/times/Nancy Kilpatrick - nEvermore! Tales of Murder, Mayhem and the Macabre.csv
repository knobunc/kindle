02:00|"two in the morning"|"But the answer’s no, of course. The answer will always, for the rest of my entire fucking life, be no. True, I’d stayed up some nights with her until two in the morning, chatting with her on Facebook while she asked me increasingly personal questions about my body and my sexual urges. I’d pull back slightly when the questions got too inappropriate, assuming that she was looking for a father figure and didn’t know how to go about getting one in a healthy way, or maybe she was just stoned or a little drunk or both. But now I can see what Naomi was after, confirmation that we were not the same, she and I. I was gay; she’d been born in the wrong body. Once my answers to her prying questions made this clear, she’d pulled away on her own. Stupidly, I had assumed she’d gone looking for help from someone else, and I had also, just as stupidly, assumed my sister’s stories about being clean and sober for three years now were the truth. Meanwhile, Naomi had done the worst thing a kid in her position could do; she’d gone to school."|"nEvermore! Tales of Murder, Mayhem and the Macabre"|"Nancy Kilpatrick"
12:00|mid-day|"One of my few joys was simply being outside. The most useful skills I’d learned at college were from friends who taught me how to hike and camp. Just before graduation, one of my friends had told me about how much he’d enjoyed being a volunteer in his home town search and rescue team, so I signed up when I came back from college. By the end of my fifth week, I’d been involved with finding a runaway kid who was hiding out in a cave on Mount Yaanek, I’d rescued a family dog from a bear trap, and I’d tracked down a grandfather with Alzheimer’s who’d wandered away from home one night. It was mid-day when I located Grandpa Henry, so the poor old guy had spent the long October night there, turning this way and that, with no idea where he was or why he was there. When I spotted him, he was standing beneath the shade of a sycamore, facing the trunk, chattering. I made out part of it before he knew I was there. “…they’re all here, I seen ‘em but goddamnit I can’t remember the names, but I knowed every goddamn one of ‘em, and—”"|"nEvermore!

02:00|"two in the morning"|"I’m listening at the lighthouse door. It’s two in the morning and Uncle Nat isn’t back yet. He always sticks his head in to get my report before retiring to bed, but tonight there is no sound of clomping boots, no whistling. The air is dead still and heavy with dew. Not a good sign. I look anxiously out to sea, which glistens like molten tar under the starless sky. There is a sliver of crescent moon in the west, but a wall of fog is rolling in from the east, swallowing sea and sky."|"nEvermore! Tales of Murder, Mayhem and the Macabre"|"Nancy Kilpatrick"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"The solitude is worst at two in the morning, so I busy myself with my duties. First I check the ship-to-shore wireless for nearby ships. Even the rat-a-tat of Morse code would be welcome company on a night like this, but there’s no one out there. Since the U-boat attack on the passenger ferry, everyone is spooked. Next I get the furnace going for the foghorn and polish up all the lenses on the lantern."|"nEvermore! Tales of Murder, Mayhem and the Macabre"|"Nancy Kilpatrick"
"ap 10:00"|"10 o’clock"|"10 o’clock. Temp. 37°, Wind 0. I am still on duty. The fog is a pale gauze now in the morning light. There is still no trace of Uncle Nat. I’ve stopped being mad at him; I just want him to walk through that lighthouse door, safe and sound. The lighthouse is cold and I think about the cozy warmth of my bed. I stoke the fire, refill the lanterns, and rewind the clockwork yet again, my arms aching."|"nEvermore! Tales of Murder, Mayhem and the Macabre"|"Nancy Kilpatrick"
01:00|"1 a.m."|"1 a.m. I’m wide awake! Scribbling down my radio play as fast as I can. Ghosts and fog and little dinghies that bump in the night, all inside the lonely lightkeeper’s mind."|"nEvermore! Tales of Murder, Mayhem and the Macabre"|"Nancy Kilpatrick"
"ap 10:00"|"ten-o’clock"|"Winter came and went. The constant drizzle gave way to sunshine, lush greenery and abundant flowers. Each morning, before my late ten-o’clock commute, I would sit on the flagstone terrace and watch the mist dissipate under the warm rays to reveal a spectacular view of the Channel and Salt Spring Island. These days, I thought to myself, had become the best of my short life."|"nEvermore! Tales of Murder, Mayhem and the Macabre"|"Nancy Kilpatrick"
"ap > 05:00"|"past five o’clock"|"I glanced at my watch and realized it was already past five o’clock. It would soon be getting dark, and I stared back the way I had come, thinking, there must be a shorter path back! Ahead the road turned eastwards, and I reckoned that should be more direct."|"nEvermore! Tales of Murder, Mayhem and the Macabre"|"Nancy Kilpatrick"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"As Gabriel walked into the office at eight Tuesday morning, he hung out his shingle. That was the common phrase for it, derived from the Old West, when lawyers and doctors would use shingles as business signs. Of course, in 2007 one didn’t hang out a real shingle. One put a brass plate on the door or a discreet sign in the lobby. Unless one was a new lawyer who time-shared the space and literally had to hang out his sign when he started work for the day."|"nEvermore! Tales of Murder, Mayhem and the Macabre"|"Nancy Kilpatrick"
"ap 06:04"|six-four|"Gabriel rose and the man’s gaze rose with him. Then the man stepped back again. At six-four, Gabriel wasn’t simply tall— he was big. Not overweight, though it was easy to slide in that direction if he paid too little attention to his diet and exercise."|"nEvermore! Tales of Murder, Mayhem and the Macabre"|"Nancy Kilpatrick"
"ap 02:00"|two|"When the phone rang at two the next morning, Gabriel was expecting it. Indeed, that’s why he’d given Patton his cell number. If the cat returned, Patton was to contact him immediately and Gabriel would be there in twenty minutes, regardless of the time of day or night. Because while Gabriel could tell himself that he simply wanted to know if the cat returned, that promise suggested that, perhaps, he had developed a certain respect for the feline. Far more than he had for Patton. The man was a bully and a coward. There had been plenty of those in Gabriel’s life. The cat, however? It was a survivor, and that was to be admired. Despite the possible inconvenience of the hour, Gabriel would intervene to ensure it did not suffer further at Patton’s hands."|"nEvermore! Tales of Murder, Mayhem and the Macabre"|"Nancy Kilpatrick"

"~ 16:00"|"Around 4:00 pm"|"Around 4:00 pm I heard the deep chime of the front door, followed by Peter’s loud, bullying voice demanding to see me. Then Jake, equally aggressive but speaking with a higher pitch that set my teeth on edge said, “Get out of the way, old man! We have a right to come in!”"|"nEvermore!

00:00|midnight|"Great Aunt Ida had raised that raven with the damaged wing from babyhood, keeping it in the Victorian cage. And I had been given the hateful task of looking after the creature with midnight wings one summer. I was afraid of birds, and this one was smart and had grown large. It seemed to take pleasure in frightening me with sudden weird caws. But I carried out my duties… until that day…"|"nEvermore! Tales of Murder, Mayhem and the Macabre"|"Nancy Kilpatrick"

00:00|midnight|"He said more, but I didn’t hear. In my mind I saw that horrifying scene I had repressed for so long: the terrified Annabel, slamming her shiny midnight wings against the window pane, her talons scratching the glass frantically, desperate to escape the claws and teeth of the feral grey cat that snarled and leapt and… And while I screamed, two unbearable boys hid in the dark shadows and laughed…"|"nEvermore!
