"ap < 06:00"|"nearly six o'clock"|"MEANWHILE, BACK TO THE HISTORICAL RECONSTRUCTION:
It is nearly six o'clock when Mr. Dower finishes typing his report.
He's lost track of the time, his head locked inside the scope of his postmortem on the instrument. He's read about its like before. Their design is attributed to a deaf-mute German violinist in Paris in the early 1920s, but nobody actually built one until the ghastly Dr. Mabuse commissioned an entire string section from a certain Berlin instrument maker in 1931. (It should be no surprise that the instrument maker prospered under the subsequent regime, but was executed after a summary trial by SMERSH investigators in 1946.) This particular instrument made its way to the West in the luggage of a returning GI, was retrofitted with electric pickups during the 1950s, and after a spectacular run of accidents was acquired by a reclusive collector in 1962--believed by some to be a front for a British government department who, as a matter of state policy, did not like to see such instruments in the wrong hands."|"The Fuller Memorandum"|"Charles Stross"
"ap 06:40"|"six forty"|"I pause briefly in my own rabbit hutch of an office, scan my email, respond to a couple of trivial pestiferations (no, I am no longer in charge of the structured cabling specifications for D Block; yes, I am still attached to the international common insourcing and acquisition standards committee, for my sins in a previous life; no, I do not have a desktop license for Microsoft Office, because my desktop PC is a Microsoft-free zone for security reasons--and would you like fries with that?). The scanner has finished digesting all those dusty letters from Arthur to John; I squirt the PDFs across to the NecronomiPod and then I grab my backpack and umbrella and head for home. Iris isn't in her office as I pass the window, and Rita on the front desk has pissed off early--then I check my watch and do a double take. It's six forty. Shit. Mo will kill me, I think as I head down the main staircase at a fast clip and barrel through the staff exit."|"The Fuller Memorandum"|"Charles Stross"
19:20|1920|"On the third day, just as I was on my way back to the palace, Teapot is said to have sat up in bed, whereupon he asked, ""What year is it?"" Upon being told it was 1920, he collapsed in a dead faint. And although he is now back at his duties, he is not the same. There is a cold intellect in him that was hitherto absent. Before, he was a loyal brute, but limited: he gave no thought to the morrow. Now he anticipates my orders with eerie efficiency, organizes the men under his command to meet any contingency, shows an unerring ability to sniff out spies--indeed, he has begun to unnerve me, the more so since I discovered he has other qualities. It is commonplace for war to degrade a good man to the level of a brute, but unique in my experience for it to elevate one such as Ensign Burdokovskii."|"The Fuller Memorandum"|"Charles Stross"
"ap 10:30"|"ten thirty"|"I push the button on the dishwasher, straighten up, and glance at the kitchen clock. It's pushing ten thirty, but I'm wide awake and full of bleak existential rage. I don't want to go to bed; I might disturb Mo, and she really needs her sleep right now. So I tiptoe upstairs to check on her, use the bathroom, then retreat downstairs again. But that leaves me with a choice between sitting in a kitchen that smells of bleach and a living room that smells of sour fear-memories. I can't face the inanities of television or the solace of a book. I feel restless. So I clip on my holster, pull on my jacket, and go outside for a walk."|"The Fuller Memorandum"|"Charles Stross"

I keep a proper torch there, a Maglite that'll work properly when it's time to go visit Angleton's lair and turf those files from top to bottom.

I've got Amarok running on my desktop (playing ""Drowning in Berlin"" on endless repeat, because I need a pounding beat to keep me awake) and I've plowed through the CODICIL BLACK SKULL file that Angleton left me, and then on into a bunch of tedious legwork for this morning's session. I'm suffering from severe cognitive dissonance; every so often you think you've got a handle on this job, on the paper clip audits and interminable bureaucracy and committee meetings, and then something insane crawls out of the woodwork and gibbers at you, something crazy enough to give James Bond nightmares that just happen to be true."|"The Fuller Memorandum"|"Charles Stross"
