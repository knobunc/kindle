"ap ~ 01:25"|"about 1.25"|"This isn’t to say that there aren’t still a lot of great teachers. Of course there are. But overall teacher skill declined during these years, and with it the quality of classroom instruction. Between 1967 and 1980, U.S. test scores fell by about 1.25 grade-level equivalents. The education researcher John Bishop called this decline “historically unprecedented,” arguing that it put a serious drag on national productivity that would continue well into the twenty-first century."|SuperFreakonomics|"Steven D.

As an adult, she was the same. “You know, yard-of-the-month in the suburbs, no more than two beers a night and never before seven.” But as a young divorcée, she started visiting online dating sites—she liked men, and she liked sex—and just for fun listed “escort” on her profile. “I mean, it was so instantaneous,” she recalls. “I just thought I’d put it up and see what happens.”"|SuperFreakonomics|"Steven D.

(This is a good clue that many ailments aren’t so serious that they can’t wait until the weekend’s activities are over.) The peak hour is 11:00 A.M., which is five times busier than the slowest hour, which is 5:00 A.M. Six of every ten patients are female; the average age is forty-seven."|SuperFreakonomics|"Steven D.

12:00|noon|"But for the same reasons you shouldn’t put much faith in doctor report cards, a comparison like this is highly deceptive. Two doctors in the same ER are likely to treat very different pools of patients. The average patient at noon, for instance, is about ten years older than one who comes in the middle of the night. Even two doctors working the same shift might see very different patients, based on their skills and interests. It is the triage nurse’s job to match patients and doctors as best as possible. One doc may therefore get all the psychiatric cases on a shift, or all the elderly patients. Because an old person with shortness of breath is much more likely to die than a thirty-year-old with the same condition, we have to be careful not to penalize the doctor who happens to be good with old people."|SuperFreakonomics|"Steven D.

"ap 02:00"|2:00|"Thanks to the nature of the emergency room, there is another sort of de facto, accidental randomization that can lead us to the truth. The key is that patients generally have no idea which doctors will be working when they arrive at the ER. Therefore, the patients who show up between 2:00 and 3:00 P.M. on one Thursday in October are, on average, likely to be similar to the patients who show up the following Thursday, or the Thursday after that. But the doctors working on those three Thursdays will probably be different. So if the patients who came on the first Thursday have worse outcomes than the patients who came on the second or third Thursday, one likely explanation is that the doctors on that shift weren’t as good. (In this ER, there were usually two or three doctors per shift.)"|SuperFreakonomics|"Steven D. Levitt"

A variety of innovations, none particularly complex—they included higher-yielding crops, better tools, and a more efficient use of capital—changed farming and, subsequently, the face of the earth. In late eighteenth-century America, “it took 19 out of 20 workers to feed the country’s inhabitants and provide a surplus for export,” wrote the economist Milton Friedman. Two hundred years later, only 1 of 20 American workers was needed to feed a far larger population while also making the United States “the largest single exporter of food in the world.”"|SuperFreakonomics|"Steven D.
