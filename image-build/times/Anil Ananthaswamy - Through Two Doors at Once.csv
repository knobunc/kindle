"< 03:00"|"almost three o’clock in the morning"|"Heisenberg’s
 insight was prophetic. In the spring of 1925, suffering from severe hay
 fever, he decamped to Helgoland in the North Sea, a rocky island devoid
 of pollen. There, between long walks and contemplating Goethe’s West-östlicher Divan, he developed the early mathematics that would become the basis for modern quantum theory. Heisenberg recalled later, “It
 was almost three o’clock in the morning before the final result of my 
computations lay before me . . . I could no longer doubt the 
mathematical consistency and coherence of the kind of quantum mechanics 
to which my calculations pointed. At first, I was deeply alarmed. I had 
the feeling that, through the surface of atomic phenomena, I was looking
 at a strangely beautiful interior, and felt almost giddy at the thought
 that I now had to probe this wealth of mathematical structures nature 
had so generously spread out before me. I was far too excited to sleep, 
and so, as a new day dawned, I made for the southern tip of the island, 
where I had been longing to climb a rock jutting out into the sea. I now
 did so without too much trouble, and waited for the sun to rise.”"|"Through Two Doors at Once"|"Anil Ananthaswamy"
"ap ~ 08:00"|"about 8"|"Arndt continued his postdoc phase with Anton Zeilinger, first in
 Innsbruck, Austria, and then moved with Zeilinger to the University of 
Vienna, and now runs his own labs on Boltzmanngasse. Among the many 
experiments Arndt’s group is doing,
 one with particular relevance to questions about the foundations of 
quantum mechanics has to do with molecular interferometry: doing 
advanced variants of the double-slit experiment with large molecules and
 nanoparticles. Zeilinger, in his early days, had been part of a team 
that demonstrated a double-slit experiment with single neutrons, the 
most massive particle to be tested in the 1970s. Soon physicists began 
showing that atoms could be placed in superposition of states and made 
to interfere. In 1991, Jürgen 
Mlynek and colleagues in Konstanz, Germany, sent helium atoms through 
two 1-micrometer-wide slits, about 8 micrometers apart, and saw the 
atoms interfere. (The history of atom interferometry is rich. Other 
prominent names include David Pritchard at MIT, who showed in 1983 that atoms could be diffracted at gratings, and Fujio Shimizu at the University of Tokyo, who reported in 1992 a
 double-slit experiment done with neon atoms.) Since then, it has become
 a race of sorts, with the attention shifting to molecules, to see who 
can bell the biggest Schrödinger’s cat."|"Through Two Doors at Once"|"Anil Ananthaswamy"
