19:48|"7:48 P.M."|"Eugene glanced at his watch. It was an antique mechanical piece, a gift from the university upon the end of his tenure, and quite valuable to the right collector. Feeling a little ancient himself, he wore the anachronism proudly, even though it had taken over a year to get used to reading the hands. He still couldn’t do it at a glance, which forced him to look a second time: 7:48 P.M."|"Gate Crashers"|"Patrick S. Tomlinson"
12:00|noon|"“I wish you wouldn’t say that, Tom,” Felix replied. “There are a few warm-up procedures to run first, but we should be ready to make the first attempt by noon.”"|"Gate Crashers"|"Patrick S. Tomlinson"
"ap < 06:00"|"almost six"|"“It’s almost six. They were supposed to have made the first run nearly seven hours ago.”"|"Gate Crashers"|"Patrick S. Tomlinson"
12:00|noon|"“Forgive the professor,” Jeffery cut in. “He’s been on pins and needles since noon.”"|"Gate Crashers"|"Patrick S. Tomlinson"
"ap 02:10"|"ten past two"|"Eventually, he gained control of his body and picked up the offending phone from the nightstand. A weak holographic field traced a ghostly image of his assistant, annoyingly well groomed for the middle of the night. At this hour, one should look as if they’d just been mugged.
“God, Jeffery, what? It’s ten past two.”
“I’m sorry to wake you, Professor, but you’re needed in the Fleet Com QER Center right away.”"|"Gate Crashers"|"Patrick S. Tomlinson"
23:55|"five to midnight"|"The larger of the two guards looked up from his display after he read the name, stood to attention, and threw a crisp salute. He was as dark as five to midnight and appeared to be made of recycled warship keels."|"Gate Crashers"|"Patrick S. Tomlinson"
12:00|noon|"Eugene leaned over to whisper to Jeffery. “I give it until noon.” He stepped to the door and looked back as it opened. “Once you have the meeting set, go home and get some sleep. I have a feeling we’re both going to run low in the coming weeks.”"|"Gate Crashers"|"Patrick S. Tomlinson"
00:00|midnight|"No one had any doubt which company’s R&D department Rockwell had in mind. Half the room was looking uncomfortably at Eugene, unsure of what to say or do. Eugene loomed over the table menacingly.
“Have you finished?” Eugene asked, his voice warm as arctic midnight.
Rockwell stared back at him, but said nothing."|"Gate Crashers"|"Patrick S. Tomlinson"
"ap 05:12"|five-twelve|"“Four shiny new, five-twelve kilobyte QERs. Two for Bucephalus, two for Magellan.”"|"Gate Crashers"|"Patrick S. Tomlinson"
"ap 05:30"|0530|"Felix tried to force himself to relax. Eventually, he gave up as the butterflies massed in his stomach like the Mariposa Monarca Reserve. It was 0530 in the morning, and he hadn’t slept a wink. The moment Felix had been working feverishly toward for the last three years, and in a sense his whole life, arrived in two hours."|"Gate Crashers"|"Patrick S. Tomlinson"
"ap 11:50"|"Eleven fifty"|"At least it’ll make good drama, Felix thought. “Eleven hundred meters. Eleven fifty. Twelve hundred. Locking the window.”"|"Gate Crashers"|"Patrick S. Tomlinson"
17:00|"1700 hours"|"Maximus nodded. “We’ll be back with you at 1700 hours, Captain Ridgeway.”"|"Gate Crashers"|"Patrick S. Tomlinson"
19:47|1947|"“Here’s what we know.” Allison pointed to one of the huts in the display and twisted her wrist, leaving a red dot. “Mr. Fletcher was in the sleeping hut until 1947 today, about an hour after sunrise. Then he got up and made a beeline for the forest.” She dragged her finger through the air, leaving a red path behind her on the map."|"Gate Crashers"|"Patrick S. Tomlinson"
"ap < 00:57"|"almost three to one"|"“Their annual celebrations have a somewhat … deleterious effect on the male population. Women outnumber the adult men almost three to one.”"|"Gate Crashers"|"Patrick S. Tomlinson"
01:00|"1:00 A.M."|"What he saw didn’t merely defy understanding. It snuck out of its bedroom window at 1:00 A.M., stole understanding’s prized collector car from the garage, and crashed it into a tree."|"Gate Crashers"|"Patrick S. Tomlinson"
20:19|"Twenty … nineteen"|"“All right, fine. But this delay is pointless, human.” The Turemok set his feet and crossed his arms in annoyance. “Twenty … nineteen … eighteen…”"|"Gate Crashers"|"Patrick S. Tomlinson"
"ap 00:00"|twelve|"“Thirteen…,” the monster said. “Ah, what comes after thirteen?”
“Oh, that’s a tricky one. It’s twelve,” Felix said helpfully.
“Why isn’t it twoteen?”"|"Gate Crashers"|"Patrick S. Tomlinson"
"ap 04:07"|four-seven|"“Never mind. See that big, ugly thing bearing three-zero-six by four-seven at fifty-three point seven kilometers?”"|"Gate Crashers"|"Patrick S. Tomlinson"
"> 03:00"|"just after three in the morning"|"Eugene waited impatiently for the elevator to reach the QER center basement level. It was just after three in the morning when Kiefer had screened to let him know Felix wanted to talk. Whatever it was, it had to be important, because he specifically refused to talk to anyone but Eugene or Jeffery."|"Gate Crashers"|"Patrick S. Tomlinson"
01:20|"0120 hours"|"The cause of her insomnia sat strapped in a cradle as she passed Shuttle Bay Two. Flickering lights danced across the artifact in the observation gallery windows. Despite being 0120 hours, a solitary figure remained hard at work."|"Gate Crashers"|"Patrick S. Tomlinson"
17:00|"1700 hours"|"“That’s simple. We can epoxy the fissure and restore airtightness within the hour. Then we can pressurize the bay and weld in a permanent patch. Call it 1700 hours.”"|"Gate Crashers"|"Patrick S. Tomlinson"
