Much can be said against the Revd. J. G. Keach. Alas, yes. But, when he stands at the Judgement Seat, this also must be said in extenuation – he was businesslike, Lord. And, in Englishmen, this is a rare virtue. We could have done with a few depot supply-majors like him in France. He had said that the scaffold would be ready and it was. He had said that, if I arrived on the quarter-past seven train, he would meet me in the church at seven-thirty. And he did."|"A Month in the Country"|"J. L. Carr"

And then there’s the blow-back and, when this … well, blows back, it erupts. Smoke, sparks, ash … yes, ash, it showers ash on the congregation. I have had several complaints. During evensong on January 15th this year, some even fell on the choir during the anthem. Not merely ash! Ashes! I’ve had an expert from York to look at it. He charged us a guinea and said it wouldn’t give us any more trouble. But within the month it was at it again. Just now it seems to have settled down; I know you can be relied on not to interfere with it.’"|"A Month in the Country"|"J. L. Carr"

As far as I’m concerned he might just as well have gone round the corner and died. But that goes for most of us, doesn’t it? We look blankly at each other. Here I am, here you are. What are we doing here? What do you suppose it’s all about? Let’s dream on. Yes, that’s my Dad and Mum over there on the piano top. My eldest boy is on the mantelpiece. That cushion cover was embroidered by my cousin Sarah only a month before she passed on. I go to work at eight and come home at five-thirty. When I retire they’ll give me a clock – with my name engraved on the back. Now you know all about me. Go away: I’ve forgotten you already."|"A Month in the Country"|"J. L. Carr"

Up on my platform I used to warily circle my quarry (if that isn’t too dramatic a way of putting it) in my mind’s eye trying first this and then that for, in my job, there can’t be a second shot.

12:00|mid-day|"So, next day, we downed tools and went off to the big field where Mossop was working. Already it was a day of great heat, the barley heads were brittle and bowed and you could have sworn there was an oven smell in the air. When the dew had dried, the reaper-binder, its sails flickering, the team fresh and skittish, began tossing out sheaves and we started to stook. But heavens, the thistles! After a time I learnt to kick sheaves over until I saw a firm handhold before jamming them, heads together, into the stubble, four or five pairs to a stook. And we went on back and forth across the cracked earth in the growing heat till mid-day, when each sheaf’s shadow was no more than a black tip. Then it was dinner-time (‘t’Missus’s expecting you two gents’) and rabbit-and-potato pie put fresh heart into us and carried us on until, at four, ‘th’allooance’ came, greengage pie and scalding tea in a can."|"A Month in the Country"|"J.

He had an impressively comprehensive stock; there must have been thirty pianos, as many American organs and harmoniums and a couple of pipe organs. ‘It’s t’Deputation frev Osgodby Wesleyans come about t’organ,’ Mr Dowthwaite said, bending forward nervously. ‘Mr Baines knows all about us; Mr Ellerbeck here wrote a letter to say we were coming on the 2.15.’"|"A Month in the Country"|"J.

12:00|midday|"The anxious time was over; I was in calm water now. The weather, those long warm days, went on in majestic succession right through August. The front gardens of cottages were crammed with marjoram and roses, marguerites, sweet william, at night heavy with the scent of stocks. The Vale was heavy with leaves, motionless in the early morning, black caves of shadow in the midday heat, blurring the sound of trains hammering north and south."|"A Month in the Country"|"J. L.

Their acceptance of the sacrament is perfunctory: I have yet to meet the man whose hair rose at the nape of his neck because he was about to taste the blood of his dying Lord. Even when they visit their church in large numbers, at Harvest Thanksgiving or the Christmas Midnight Mass, it is no more than a pagan salute to the passing seasons. They do not need me. I come in useful at baptisms, weddings, funerals. Chiefly funerals – they employ me as a removal contractor to see them safely flitted into their last house.’ He laughed bitterly."|"A Month in the Country"|"J. L. Carr"

So I sent word that I shouldn’t be able to umpire for the team at Steeple Sinderby and, after working through the morning, came down about two o’clock. I took my bread and cheese outside, half hoping Moon would be about. But he wasn’t and, later, I found that he’d gone to York on the morning train."|"A Month in the Country"|"J. L. Carr"
"ap > 09:00"|"past nine"|"So I humped my pack and went out into the yard. Though it was past nine, the grass was soaking with dew and cobwebs drifted, breaking away from bushes and briars. All was as it had been – the fields, the high woods, even the crouching cat. It stared hostilely at me as I lifted the loop of binder-twine to open the gate, meaning to cross the meadow to say cheerio to Moon before going down to the station and the Ellerbecks. Then (and I can’t explain it) the numbness went and I knew that, whatever else had befallen me during those few weeks in the country, I had lived with a very great artist, my secret sharer of the long hours I’d laboured in the half-light above the arch. So I turned and climbed the ladder for a last look. And, standing before the great spread of colour, I felt the old tingling excitement and a sureness that the time would come when some stranger would stand there too and understand."|"A Month in the Country"|"J.

12:00|Noon|"She comes not when Noon is on the roses –

    Too bright is Day.

She comes not to the Soul till it reposes

    From work and play.

But when Night is on the hills, and the great Voices

    Roll in from sea

By starlight and by candlelight and dreamlight

    She comes to me.
