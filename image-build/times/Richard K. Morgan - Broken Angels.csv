12:00|midday|"I made myself lie back again and relax into the day. The morning sun was already beginning to build toward semitropical midday heat, and the rock was warm to the touch. Between my half-closed eyelids, light moved the way it had in the lochside convalescent virtuality. I let myself drift."|"Broken Angels"|"Richard K. Morgan"
12:00|midday|"I walked with Schneider through badly kept streets full of urban detritus and reddish desert sand. The air was hot and dry, and the shade cast by the blocks on either side provided little respite from the high-angled rays of the sun. I could feel sweat beading on my face and soaking the hair at the back of my neck. In windows and mirror-shielded frontages along the way, our black-uniformed reflections kept pace. I was almost glad of the company. There was no one else out in the midday heat, and the shimmering stillness of it was uncanny. The sand crunched audibly underfoot."|"Broken Angels"|"Richard K. Morgan"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"“I doubt it. The automated systems won’t be tuned for it. War’s too far off for emergency default settings. These are friendly uniforms, and curfew isn’t till ten. We’re nothing out of the ordinary.”"|"Broken Angels"|"Richard K. Morgan"
12:00|midday|"The top three floors of the Mandrake Tower were executive residential, access barred from below and topped off with a multilevel roof complex of gardens and cafés. A variable-permeate power screen strung from parapet pylons kept the sun fine-tuned for luminous warmth throughout the day, and in three of the cafés you could get breakfast at any hour. We got it at midday and were still working our way through the last of the spread when an immaculately attired Hand came looking for us. If he’d been listening in on last night’s character assassination, it didn’t seem to have upset him much."|"Broken Angels"|"Richard K. Morgan"
"ap 03:50"|350|"Back in the machine, Hand’s virtual self worked the long shortlist down to eleven. It took nearly three months to do it. Run at the A.I.’s top capacity of 350 times real time, the whole process was over shortly before midnight."|"Broken Angels"|"Richard K. Morgan"
"< 00:00"|"shortly before midnight"|"Back in the machine, Hand’s virtual self worked the long shortlist down to eleven. It took nearly three months to do it. Run at the A.I.’s top capacity of 350 times real time, the whole process was over shortly before midnight."|"Broken Angels"|"Richard K. Morgan"
00:00|midnight|"We went down to look at what we had, blinking in the suddenly harsh lights inside the Tower and yawning. Less than an hour later, as midnight turned over and the new day began, we turned off Hand’s virtual self and uploaded ourselves into the machine in his place."|"Broken Angels"|"Richard K. Morgan"
"< 00:00"|"a little before midnight"|"“Deng left the Tower in his own transport early last night. He disappeared in the Old Clearing House mall a little before midnight.”"|"Broken Angels"|"Richard K. Morgan"
05:00|"five in the fucking morning"|"Hand breathed out, compressed. “I am not going to debate employment law with you, Kovacs, at five in the fucking morning.” He turned on his heel. “You two had better get your act together. We download into the Dangrek construct at nine.”"|"Broken Angels"|"Richard K. Morgan"

"ap 01:53"|"One hour, fifty-three minutes"|"I slumped against a bulkhead and squeezed my eyes closed. The countdown flared in the sudden darkness behind my eyelids. One hour, fifty-three minutes. Counting down."|"Broken Angels"|"Richard K. Morgan"
"ap 01:17"|"one hour and seventeen minutes"|"Hand called the meeting formally at one hour and seventeen minutes. Cutting it fine, but then maybe he was letting everybody air their feelings informally first. There’d been shouting from the upper deck pretty much since I left. Down in the hold, I could hear the tone of it but not, without applying the neurachem, the substance. It seemed to have been going on for a long time."|"Broken Angels"|"Richard K. Morgan"
"ap ~ 08:00"|"About eight"|"“About eight to ten hours. No more than twelve, certainly.” Sun turned to the archaeologue. “How long will it take you, Mistress Wardani, to open the docking bay?”"|"Broken Angels"|"Richard K. Morgan"
