09:19|"9:19 A.M."|"He pushed his chair back to get a locked drawer open. He took out a folded paper and passed it over. I unfolded it and saw it was a Postal Telegraph form. The wire had been filed at El Paso on June 14th at 9:19 A.M. It was addressed to Derace Kingsley, 965 Carson Drive, Beverly Hills, and read:"|"The Lady in the Lake"|"Raymond Chandler"
"~ 04:00"|"about 4 A.M."|"“That night. I wasn’t even here. I felt too mean to stay even half sober. I hopped into my Ford and went over to the north side of the lake and holed up with a couple of no-goods like myself and got good and stinking. Not that it did me any good. Along about 4 A.M. I got back home and Muriel is gone, packed up and gone, nothing left but a note on the bureau and some cold cream on the pillow.”"|"The Lady in the Lake"|"Raymond Chandler"
"~ 03:00"|"about three in the morning"|"The clerk yawned, got a delayed reaction, and said brightly: “It gets quite cool here about three in the morning. From then on until eight, or even nine, it’s quite pleasant.”"|"The Lady in the Lake"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"The clerk yawned, got a delayed reaction, and said brightly: “It gets quite cool here about three in the morning. From then on until eight, or even nine, it’s quite pleasant.”"|"The Lady in the Lake"|"Raymond Chandler"
00:00|midnight|"I wiped the back of my neck and staggered out to the car. Even the seat of the car was hot, at midnight."|"The Lady in the Lake"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap ~ 02:45"|"about two-forty-five"|"I got home about two-forty-five and Hollywood was an icebox. Even Pasadena had felt cool."|"The Lady in the Lake"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"It was nine o’clock when I woke up again. The sun was on my face. The room was hot. I showered and shaved and partly dressed and made the morning toast and eggs and coffee in the dinette. While I was finishing up there was a knock at the apartment door."|"The Lady in the Lake"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 08:30"|eight-thirty|"“That,” she said, “would probably have been quite late. I’ve been here since eight-thirty.”"|"The Lady in the Lake"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 08:27"|"eight twenty-seven"|"Cooney said: “Time is eight twenty-seven. Write it down, Officer Dobbs.”"|"The Lady in the Lake"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 09:54"|"Nine fifty-four"|"I looked at my watch. Nine fifty-four. Time to go home and get your slippers on and play over a game of chess. Time for a tall cool drink and a long quiet pipe. Time to sit with your feet up and think of nothing. Time to start yawning over your magazine. Time to be a human being, a householder, a man with nothing to do but rest and suck in the night air and rebuild the brain for tomorrow."|"The Lady in the Lake"|"Raymond Chandler"
"< 00:00"|"almost midnight"|"The Chrysler was in the police lot at the side of the building with the keys in the ignition and none of the fenders smashed. Cooney hadn’t made good on his threat. I drove back to Hollywood and went up to my apartment in the Bristol. It was late, almost midnight."|"The Lady in the Lake"|"Raymond Chandler"
00:00|midnight|"The discreet midnight tapping sounded on the door and I went over and opened it. Kingsley looked as big as a horse in a creamy Shetland sports coat with a green and yellow scarf around the neck inside the loosely turned-up collar. A dark reddish brown snapbrim hat was pulled low on his forehead and under its brim, his eyes looked like the eyes of a sick animal."|"The Lady in the Lake"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap < 06:30"|"almost half-past six"|"“It was almost half-past six,” Kingsley said. “We had to sit there in the office and wait for her to call. You tell him.” He turned his head to the girl."|"The Lady in the Lake"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 01:15"|one-fifteen|"I reached for the envelope and put it in my pocket. “She will, if she wants this.” I looked at my strap watch. “If I start right away, I might make the one-fifteen deadline. They must know her by heart in that bar after all these hours. That makes it nice too.”"|"The Lady in the Lake"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap > 01:15"|"just past one-fifteen"|"A wizened waiter with evil eyes and a face like a gnawed bone put a napkin with a printed peacock on it down on the table in front of me and gave me a Bacardi cocktail. I sipped it and looked at the amber face of the bar clock. It was just past one-fifteen."|"The Lady in the Lake"|"Raymond Chandler"
04:23|"twenty-three minutes past four in the morning"|"“Certainly I have,” the clerk said coldly. “We don’t announce guests at—” he lifted his arm and turned it neatly to look at the narrow oblong watch on the inside of his wrist—“at twenty-three minutes past four in the morning.”"|"The Lady in the Lake"|"Raymond Chandler"
12:00|noon|"We reached the long slope south of San Dimas that goes up to a ridge and drops down into Pomona. This is the ultimate end of the fog belt, and the beginning of that semi-desert region where the sun is as light and dry as old sherry in the morning, as hot as a blast furnace at noon, and drops like an angry brick at nightfall."|"The Lady in the Lake"|"Raymond Chandler"
