"~ 21:00"|"approximately 21.00 hrs"|"We have reason to believe that the break-in took place at approximately 21.00 hrs. The local vicar assured PC Hill that he posted a letter (case letter 15) at about 20.55 that evening, when everything appeared ‘just as normal – in fact, if anything, more normal than normal’. (PC Hill comments in his accompanying notes that he found this ‘more normal than normal’ statement, ‘slightly odd’, but that he didn’t press the reverend any further on the point because ‘he had just started a nose bleed and only had one tissue’.)"|"Burley Cross Postbox Theft"|"Nicola Barker"

"ap 05:00"|five|"Horsmith, while professing himself to be ‘very interested’ in my theories, calmly informed me that unless he was able to catch TP red-handed (transporting faeces from her home and depositing them on the moor) then he would be unable to take any kind of prohibitive action against her. Given that TP prefers to walk only after dark and Trevor Horsmith’s working hours finish promptly at five, the likelihood of this ever happening is – at best, I feel – extremely limited. Horsmith also went on to discourage me – and in no uncertain terms, either – from taking any kind of independent action myself, claiming that a matter this sensitive was – I quote – ‘always better left in the hands of qualified professionals’."|"Burley Cross Postbox Theft"|"Nicola Barker"

I looked it up recently in my Encyclopedia of Names (I’d been considering giving the name to the hero of my first novel, a reformed sex abuser who has been made sole custodian of a small Romanian boy – I won’t bother you with the backstory, but it’s all perfectly credible – and is then obliged to go on the run with him to keep him from the clutches of a Russian crime syndicate)."|"Burley Cross Postbox Theft"|"Nicola Barker"

If I don’t manage to catch it then the samples – there’s only two of them, they’re minuscule – won’t reach you until the day after tomorrow and that would be a serious, serious pain in the arse (why am I telling you this? What good will it do? Balls! I’ll definitely miss it at this rate! In fact… Great. I have missed it. I’m screwed. You’re screwed. Carol-Ann’s going to throw the most monumental strop.

Given that I haven’t seen you, I’m presuming that either you didn’t make it to Burley Cross after all, or that you’ve happened across somewhere you think Mr Booth will prefer in Ilkley itself (although the noise will be a factor there, I can assure you, especially at the weekend. And if you’re seduced by the apparent grandeur of The Railway Hotel – and it does look grand on paper – be assured that the central heating groans like a wounded heifer, every night, without fail, from 3 a.m. onwards)."|"Burley Cross Postbox Theft"|"Nicola Barker"

I can’t exactly recollect the word you preferred to use instead; it began with an e, I think. Was it ‘evocation’? No. It was something else.

"~ 14:00"|"approximately 14.00 hrs"|"I had observed a man – youthful, brown-haired, quite fit and handsome, dressed for hiking – entering the toilets at approximately 14.00 hrs on a quiet Tuesday afternoon. He was driving a dark, metallic-green hatchback (some kind of Hyundai, I think). When he initially pulled up I noticed that he had a very beautiful, large and finely bred Red Setter accompanying him."|"Burley Cross Postbox Theft"|"Nicola Barker"
"~ 15:30"|"about half past three in the afternoon"|"Anyway, I walked over to his house (it’s this big place called The Old Hall), and when I got there (it’s about half past three in the afternoon – freezing cold), the front door is wide open! I knocked a few times (no answer) and considered just leaving the wallet on the hallway table, but then became convinced that a passing stranger might come in and steal it (unlikely, really, and I could’ve just closed the door after me, anyway)."|"Burley Cross Postbox Theft"|"Nicola Barker"

I went down there yesterday morning early (must’ve been around 8 a.m. – sun’d hardly rose) and found that confounded bloody woman (Tilly Brooks) accompanied by that confounded bloody duck (repulsive thing it is – face like a piece of broiled tongue), swimming around – trespassing – in my Private Fishing Lake again."|"Burley Cross Postbox Theft"|"Nicola Barker"

She had planned to arrive earlier in the day to host an inspection of the local B&Bs (which she has already contacted by phone) in order to drum up interest in Mr Booth’s Ilkley show (also, perhaps, to ‘case’ these properties for any objects of exceptional value while accumulating a useful store of information, which she can then follow up on the internet, through detailed searches of local papers, obituaries, MySpace pages, websites etc.)."|"Burley Cross Postbox Theft"|"Nicola Barker"
21:22|"21.22 hrs"|"Fifteen minutes later (21.22 hrs), Miss Squire arrives in Skipton where she is booked into a local B&B. This B&B is located directly across the road from Mhairi Callaghan’s Feathercuts. Miss Squire informs the proprietress of the B&B (Margaret Bridge) that she is late because of a blow-out on the motorway, then heads straight up to her room to retire for the night."|"Burley Cross Postbox Theft"|"Nicola Barker"
13:15|"13.15 hrs"|"Oh yes… One small detail Mhairi didn’t forget: while she was finishing up Miss Squire’s haircut, Miss Squire received a phone call (at 13.15 hrs, approx., from Mr Booth) and apparently became ‘quite agitated’. Mhairi is uncertain as to the finer details of this exchange because she was rushed off her feet at the time, juggling Miss Squire’s cut with a difficult tinting job, but Miss Squires left the salon shortly afterwards (too flustered to remember to leave a tip!)."|"Burley Cross Postbox Theft"|"Nicola Barker"
