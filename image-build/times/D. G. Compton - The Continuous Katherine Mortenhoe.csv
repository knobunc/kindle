She didn’t hear him. Ethel Pargeter now behind her, she was at the title stage of the new Celia Wentworth, and she positively did not hear him.

“Outies at ten,” Peter said. “Surely you’ve looked in your diary?”
For some curious reason she hadn’t turned over the pages of her diary since last week. Barbara ticked, and put out a small, polite blue tongue. A Fit for a Queen, Katherine read. She crumpled the blue slip and threw it away, then reached for her jotter. It had to be her fault that watchful Barbara had missed the epilepsy connotation: she must check the cross-associations in the word store. Apart from that it was neat. Every young girl’s dream.

The bell rang and rang, and Harry wouldn’t answer it because he wouldn’t be there. She imagined the empty flat and the telephone ringing in it. The idea was comforting, and she left it ringing while she started drafting her official letter of resignation. Then she tore up the draft and cut the ringing, and decided she’d resign from nothing. And she’d tell nobody, not until—in Dr. Mason’s words—not until her coordination fell below that level necessary for full manual dexterity."|"The Continuous Katherine Mortenhoe"|"D. G. Compton"

DOCTOR GROUPING. RANDOMIZE. The printout came back at her fast and she sorted sequences. Since the new working day had been introduced, Harry was usually home by three-thirty. He’d chosen his department’s morning shift and he’d be down in the Hobby Room, dutifully making his wooden ship models. The flat was cluttered with them. Impossible to dust. Recently he’d talked to her obliquely of moving—the men in their block were a pushy lot, very competitive, and Harry had ten thumbs. 7–5–3, she typed. 10–7–1–1–4–3–6. Men never grow up, she thought. And then remembered the different, frailer vanities of women. Barbara scanned for familiarity, and returned a sequence four points similar, over a date two years old.

She didn’t want anything to do with it. Then she spent the next half-hour getting it back, persuading the man at the sorting office counter three floors down that she’d posted it by mistake. He asked her for proof of identity, examined her driving license, her Computabook pass, her blood-group sticker, her travelator season ticket, her pedestrian’s permit, her Social Security card, currency card, diners’ card, voter’s card, civil offenses card (unmarked), and post box registration certificate, and then said he would have to ask his superior who didn’t get in till nine.

She bounced off the bed, caught sight of her crumpled clothes in the mirror, rubbed them down with her Smoothit, and revolved slowly, considering her reflection. Not bad for forty-four, and the grave only twenty-six days off. She went in search of Harry’s travel brochures. It was odd how the old ways of thought lingered. The old phrases. She hadn’t heard of a grave, not a real corpse-and-coffin grave, not in ten or fifteen years. Her writer ladies used them. Herself, she’d give her altered organism to a medical school: young ones—well, middle-aged ones—must be fairly hard to come by.

If she had been willing, with only four weeks left, to live her dwindling days to the full via a wide range of soft drinks, hair conditioners, chocolate bars, hi-fi sets, sexual appliances, nicotine-free cigarettes, and instant spray-on wallpaper, she could, Harry calculated, enrich her residual estate by some seventeen thousand. Furthermore, a mountain leisure center famous for its Rocky Haven Waffles offered her four weeks free accommodation for herself and her husband, plus a single room and exclusive use of the camp chapel for an additional seven-day period. All this in exchange for the simple statement that if she’d only discovered the mountain air (and the Waffles) sooner she was sure she’d have lived to a hundred and ten.

  I FIRST heard of the kidnapping of Katherine Mortenhoe on the all-night telly in the Night Hawk’s coffee bar. At three in the morning you find yourself watching anything, even the Tokyo Stock Market slotted into fifth reruns of your own six-year-old Great Men of the Century shows. You watch too much, and you drink too much coffee, and you eat too many doughnuts. It’s funny how hungry you can feel, even at that dead, overlit, hopeless hour.

His assistant would make all arrangements, and the documentation would be ready for them to pick up when they came to NTV House at four. On the question of suitable clothes, though, he’d prefer Mrs. Mortenhoe to buy her own. Neither he nor his assistant would presume to choose clothes for a beautiful woman.

There were a couple of detractors, of course, but clearly the show was a certain award-winner. The telephone calls had started coming in even while it was being screened.
