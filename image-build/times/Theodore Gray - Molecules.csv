00:00|0000|"It may surprise you to learn that metal, even iron, burns quite easily under the right conditions. This 0000 grade (very fine) steel wool was simply hung up and lit with a cigarette lighter. Iron burning is the same chemical process as rusting, just happening much, much faster. Iron pots don’t burn only because their large mass keeps the temperature at the surface well below the ignition point. A truly massive amount of heat could cause them to burn, but this wouldn’t happen on an ordinary stove or camp fire. There’s a fascinating thing to notice about how metal burns: there is no “flame” in the conventional sense. When organic materials burn, you see glowing fire well away from the material itself; this is the burning of gases that have been liberated from the material by the heat of the fire. These flammable gases rise and mix with air before burning, resulting in pretty, flickering flames. When metal burns, there is nothing to be liberated, so all the burning happens directly on the surface of the metal. (Any smoke you see is from a bit of oil left over from the making of the wires.) The tiny, glowing beads of flame chasing each other along these fine strands of steel are both remarkable and beautiful to watch."|Molecules|"Theodore Gray"
