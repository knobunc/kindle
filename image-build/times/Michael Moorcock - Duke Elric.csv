12:00|noon|"As the mist cleared, it revealed à landscape of dense shadows. The shadows spread over red rock and yellow vegetation and they were shadows of all shapes and dimensions, resembling all manner of things. They seemed cast by the huge blood-coloured sun which stood at perpetual noon above the island, but what was disturbing about them was that the shadows themselves seemed without a source, as if the objects they represented were invisible or existed elsewhere than on the island itself. The sky, too, seemed full of these shadows, but whereas those on the island were still, those in the sky sometimes moved, perhaps when the clouds moved. And all the while the red sun poured down its bloody light and touched the twenty men with its unwelcome radiance just as it touched the land."|"Duke Elric"|"Michael Moorcock"
12:00|noon|"He climbed carefully and steadily, finding many footholds, and seemed to gain considerable height quite quickly, yet it was noon before he had reached the top and found himself standing at the edge of a broad, rocky plateau which fell away sharply to form a close horizon. Beyond the plateau was only the sky. Save for sparse, brownish grass, little grew here and there were no signs at all of human habitation. It was now, for the first time, that Elric realized the absence of any form of wildlife. Not a single seabird flew in the air, not an insect crept through the grass. Instead, there was an enormous silence hanging over the brown plain."|"Duke Elric"|"Michael Moorcock"
12:00|noon|"Refreshed, the pair climbed over the boulders and left the river behind, ascending the slopes, speaking little so that their breath was saved for the exertion. It was noon by the time they reached the top of the valley and observed a plain not unlike the one which Elric had first crossed. Elric now had a fair idea of the island's geography: it resembled the top of a mountain, with an indentation near the centre which was the valley. Again he became sharply aware of the absence of any wildlife and remarked on this to Count Smiorgan, who agreed that he had seen nothing—no bird, fish nor beast since he had arrived."|"Duke Elric"|"Michael Moorcock"
12:00|noon|"And at noon they broke out of the forest and saw the ruins of R'lin K'ren Aa."|"Duke Elric"|"Michael Moorcock"
12:00|noon|"Outside in the middle of the square, at noon, still lay the lonely body of the last Vilmirian crewman. Nobody had known his name. Nobody felt grief for him or tried to compose an epitaph for him. The dead Vilmirian had died for no high purpose, followed no fabulous dream. Even in death his body would fulfill no function. On this island there was no carrion-eater to feed. In the dust of the city there was no earth to fertilize."|"Duke Elric"|"Michael Moorcock"
00:00|midnight|"Elric, Isaak, Rebecca and Mustapha the Goth are tiny figures aboard their ship as crashing waves descend on them, lightning rends the midnight black and we get a full-strength sturm und drang. Ah, Pathetic Mortals so weak before the Mighty Power of Nature."|"Duke Elric"|"Michael Moorcock"
12:00|noon|"At that moment any casual customer of the salon would have seen one elegant man of the world in amiable conversation with another. An observer might have noted that both seemed to be taking an admiring interest in the tall woman walking, à la Colette, her two Oriental cats in the noon sunlight sparkling through the waters of the central fountain where classical marble merfolk paid homage to a Neptune whose trident was green with verdigris. The spraying water formed a blur of rainbow colour giving the woman an almost unearthly appearance as she passed by. She stood for a while staring thoughtfully into the middle distance seemingly utterly oblivious of the two men."|"Duke Elric"|"Michael Moorcock"
00:00|Midnight|"People who want to get an idea of what we sounded like can obtain the albums on CD, though I still think we did a messy, fussy production on the Deep Fix's The New World's Fair! You can hear cleaner versions on Roller Coaster Holiday. I'd also recommend the excellent compilation album of Grove bands and performers Cries from the Midnight Circus."|"Duke Elric"|"Michael Moorcock"
