She became the first female US photo-intelligence officer. While working in occupied France, she met and subsequently married Colonel Huntingdon D Sheldon. Huntingdon Sheldon subsequently became one of the founding officers of the nascent CIA, and Alice Sheldon continued to do work for it, particularly around photo-intelligence. Judging by her own testimony, she became sceptical of the value and efficacy of intelligence work as practised by the CIA, especially around the Bay of Pigs fiasco. But she was also fond of emphasising her connection with this world. One of her editors, David Hartwell, once told me that she was fond of dropping into conversation tantalising snippets like, “You have no idea how tough it was in the 1960s when we were trying to get hold of a sample of Fidel Castro’s urine.” In the late 1950s she had a hiatus for taking stock, which led to another change of career. She took degrees in psychology, concentrating on the workings of visual perception. This culminated in a PhD in 1967."|"Her Smoke Rose Up Forever"|"James Tiptree Jr_"

Sleep which merges into feedings and washings and more sleeps, into drowsy moments of afternoon where midnight should be, and gentle businesslike voices and friendly (but very few) faces, and endless painless hyposprays and peculiar numbnesses. And later comes the steadying rhythm of days and nights, and a quickening which P. Burke doesn’t identify as health, but only knows that the fungus place in her armpit is gone. And then she’s up and following those few new faces with growing trust, first tottering, then walking strongly, all better now, clumping down the short hall to the tests, tests, tests, and the other things."|"Her Smoke Rose Up Forever"|"James Tiptree Jr_"

Bud’s reflected face looks downward, grin gone. Dave’s beard moves silently; praying, Lorimer realizes. Alone of the crew Dave is deeply religious; at Sunday meals he gives a short, dignified grace. A shocking pity for Dave rises in Lorimer; Dave is so deeply involved with his family, his four sons, always thinking about their training, taking them hunting, fishing, camping. And Doris his wife so incredibly active and sweet, going on their trips, cooking and doing things for the community. Driving Penny and Jenny to classes while Ginny was sick that time. Good people, the backbone . . . This can’t be, he thinks; Packard’s voice is going to come through in a minute, the antenna’s beamed right now. Six minutes now. This will all go away. Before the year two thousand—stop it, the language would have changed. Think of Doris. . . . She has that glow, feeding her five men; women with sons are different. But Ginny, but his dear woman, his wife, his daughters—grandmothers now? All dead and dust? Quit that. Dave is still praying. . . . Who knows what goes on inside those heads? Dave’s cry . . . Twelve minutes, it has to be all right. The second sweep is stuck, no, it’s moving. Thirteen. It’s all insane, a dream. Thirteen plus . . . fourteen. The speaker hissing clicking vacantly.
