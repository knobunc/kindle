The interstate, encountering this obstacle, had dealt with it with dynamite, opening up what highway engineers call a benched throughcut and geologists finding such a thing in nature call a wind gap. When we reached it, we stopped, got out, and put our noses on the outcrop, for this high multitiered exposure was Frontier sandstone, and Love referred to it as ""a published roadcut,"" studied to the last grain by paleontologists and stratigraphers. The reason for so much attention was not readily apparent in the gray and somewhat gloomy, sooty-looking rock, antiqued with fossil burrows. Nonetheless, it seemed to excite Love— as he picked at it with his hammer—at least as much as the woody asters had repelled him. The rock had been submarine sand, not far offshore. ""Frontier is one of the great oil sands in the Rocky Mountain region,"" he said. At five, ten, twenty thousand feet, wildcat after wildcat had found handsome pay in this celebrated host formation, and here it was at the surface, fresh, unweathered, presenting clues to its wealth. Oil almost always moves from one place to another, from source rock to host rock—from, for example, a buried lagoon, where it forms, to a fossil beach, whose permeable sands it fills. Petroleum is the transmuted remains of marine algae"|"Rising From the Plains"|"John McPhee"

"~ 18:00"|"about 18"|"Despite her relative disadvantages as a newcomer, an outlander, and an educational ingenue, Miss Wax-ham was a quick study. Insight was her long suit, and in no time she understood Wyoming. For example, an entry in her journal says of George Ehler's father, ""He came to the country with one mare. The first summer, she had six colts! She must have had calves, too, by the way the Ehlers' cattle increased."" These remarks were dated October 22, 1905—the day after her stagecoach arrived. In months that followed, she sketched her neighbors (the word applied over many tens of miles). ""By the door was Mrs. Frink, about 18, with Frink junior, a large husky baby. Ida Franklin, Mrs. Frink's sister and almost her double, was beside her, frivolous even in her silence."" There was the story of Dirty Bill Collins, who had died as a result of taking a bath. And she fondly recorded Mrs. Mills' description of the libertine Guy Signor: ""He has a cabbage heart with a leaf for every girl."" She noted that the nearest barber had learned his trade shearing sheep, and a blacksmith doubled as dentist. Old Pelon, a French Canadian, impressed her, because he had refused to ask for money from the government after Indians killed his brother. ""Him better dead,"" said Old Pelon.

"ap 10:00"|ten|"cV\* Along the Nebraska-Wyoming line, in the region of the forty-first parallel, is a long lumpy break in the plains, called Pine Bluffs. It is rock of about the same age and story as Scotts Bluff, which is not far away. David Love—standing on top of Pine Bluffs—remarked that for a great many emigrants with their wagons and carts these had been the first breaks in the horizon west of Missouri. From the top of the bluffs, the emigrants had their first view of the front ranges of the Rockies, and the mountains gave them hope and courage. For our part, looking west from the same place, we could not see very far across the spring wildflowers into the swirling snow. The Laramie Range was directly ahead and the Never Summer Mountains off somewhere to the southwest—at ten and nearly thirteen thousand feet indeed a stirring sight, but not today. Love said a spring snowstorm was ""sort of like a kiss—it's temporary, and it will go away."" (That one stopped us for three days.) Meanwhile, there were large roadcuts to examine where Interstate 80 sliced through the bluffs, and scenes to envision that were veiled by more than snow."|"Rising From the Plains"|"John McPhee"
19:10|1910|"ready to be cashed in. Leaving them in the care of a herder, he rode to Thermopolis, where he made a down payment on a flock of his own. The conditions of the deal were rigid: the rest of the money was to be paid in seven days or the deposit was forfeit and the animals, too. Within the week, he would have to return to his fattened sheep, move them to Lander, collect his money, and return to Thermopolis—a round trip of two hundred and fifty miles. The sky over Thermopolis was dark with snowcloud. In his bearskin cap, his bearskin coat, his fleece-lined leather chaps, he saddled up Big Red— Big Red, whose life had begun somewhere in the Red Desert in 1888, a wild horse. The blizzard began as horse and rider were climbing the Owl Creek Mountains. Through steep terrain that would have been hazardous in warm clear weather, they felt their way in white-outs and darkness, in wind-chill factors greater than fifty below zero. Covering about six miles an hour, they reached the herd in twenty-one hours, and almost immediately began the gingerly walk to Lander, conserving the animals' weight. John won his bet, got back on Big Red, and flew across the mountains with the money. He and the horse beat the deadline. He collected his ewes, took them home, and bred them. In seven days, he had, among other things, set himself forward one year. By 1910, when he married Miss Waxham, he owned more than eleven thousand sheep and hundreds of cattle and horses—a fortune in livestock which today would be valued at roughly five million dollars."|"Rising From the Plains"|"John McPhee"
