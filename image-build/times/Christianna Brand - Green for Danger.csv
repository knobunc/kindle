The man shrank and groaned. “It’s all right, old chap. It won’t be long now, and then we’ll give you another dose of something and send you off to sleep. It isn’t very serious. You’re going to be all right.” He straightened himself and moved away from the bed. “Fractured his femur all right. Everything else seems to be intact. There’s no internal injury.” Sister arrived while he was washing his hands in the lavatory outside the ward. “I don’t think we’d better touch him to-night,” he said, explaining the state of affairs to her there. “He’s too badly shocked, and anyway we’ve got all we can cope with. They’ve fixed him up with a splint at the Emergency Post and I think we’ll leave him undisturbed and have him up to the theatre in the morning.

Nurses and sisters and all—flirting away with them doctors in a way I wouldn’t like to describe,” cried Mrs. Higgins, describing it in detail all over again. “Call themselves nurses, indeed! Sluts, more like! And cruel—well! Left ’im lying on ’is bed half an hour or more before they even washed the dirt off of him; never give him a nice cup of tea or anything; just a nasty prick with a needle and told ’im to go to sleep. Sleep! Much sleep he could get with all them goings on to be watched through the window of that little room. And the next morning! Five o’clock they had ’im up and washed his face all over again, as if he could of got dirty, laying there in a nice clean bed; and one miserable cuppa tea, and nothing else till ’e went for ’is operation. I wish I’d of known, I’d of smuggled ’im in somethink, but of course how was I to know he’d have the operation, and it’s my belief he’d of been a lot better off without it, anyway; always cutting bits off of you, these doctors are. I don’t ‘old with it, myself. So there ’e was, ’ungry as a ’unter, pore old boy, and no bloody wonder, well, excuse my language, Inspector, but you know what I mean. I ’adn’t ’ardly settled down to have a nice chat with him, when a whole lot of men come in and starts giving him an X-ray, or some such, a nasty looking lamp affair they had with them, and I don’t know what all; then they put a lot of screens round him and started getting him ready for the operation; no sooner than I sits down again, and it’s one of the doctors comes and wants to listen to ’is chest; and ’e was just going to tell me somethink, I don’t know what, and then another one comes and there’s a lot more screens put round ’im and I’m turned out again; and two minutes later I’m told, ‘You’ll ’ave to go now, Mrs. ’Iggins!’ ‘Well, all right,’ I thought to meself, ‘I’ll go, but I won’t go far,’ and I stood in that round hall place outside the ward, and I watched them wheel him out on a stretcher thing, all covered up with blankets and ’is pore old face quite red, laying on the pillar. That young ’ussy was wheeling him, that Nurse Samson, they call her; a cruel girl she is, cruel hard to the patients, Inspector, I can tell you that. ‘Well,’ I thought, ‘that’s a nice thing,’ I thought, ‘leaving my pore old man in charge of a chit like that,’ and I was just going up and say somethink about it, when another one come up to her, the night nurse, Lingley or some such name. ‘Oh,’ ’allo, Nesta,’ she says …”"|"Green for Danger"|"Christianna Brand"
