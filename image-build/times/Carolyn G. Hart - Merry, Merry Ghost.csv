00:00|midnight|"The last door revealed a spacious bedroom with a fireplace. A too-thin woman sat in a Sheraton chair to one side of the fireplace with glowing fake logs. Her oval face, even though drooping with pain and illness, was lovely, a high forehead, finely arched brows, eyes dark as shadows at midnight, long narrow nose, narrow lips, a firm chin, an air of command. Silver frosted her softly waved chestnut hair. She rested against the cushion, her gaze remote, sorrow her companion. She was in the room yet she seemed distant and unapproachable. There were no garlands of evergreen, no flicker of red candles, no red-and-green taffeta bows in this room. On a cushion by her feet, a large calico cat slumbered, her patches of red-and-black fur striking against the white."|"Merry, Merry Ghost"|"Carolyn G. Hart"

For the past hour, Leon had guided children up the steps to a platform. Each child carried a decoration large enough to be visible on the big tree."|"Merry, Merry Ghost"|"Carolyn G. Hart"
00:00|midnight|"Ends justifying means rarely received plaudits, but in this instance everything had worked out well and surely that was a mitigating circumstance. However, I suspected I would be climbing aboard the Rescue Express as soon as I returned Jake’s car. Perhaps she’d never notice that scrape on the left rear fender. I’d hoped to stay through Christmas—was there anything lovelier than the peal of bells at the midnight service?—but it looked as though my work was done. Keith was authenticated as Mitch’s son and was now officially Susan’s heir. I would go by the post office and drop the letter in the slot."|"Merry, Merry Ghost"|"Carolyn G. Hart"

When I approached the vehicle”—there was an odd look of discomfort on his face, perhaps reflecting a memory that the front seat had at first appeared to be unoccupied—“the driver rolled down the window. When I looked inside, I saw Mrs. Flynn.”"|"Merry, Merry Ghost"|"Carolyn G. Hart"

Only rock stars take farewell tours, but this was my ghostly—forgive me, Wiggins—version. Everything was turning up roses. Chief Cobb was looking for Susan’s murderer.

"~ 08:30"|"About eight-thirty this morning"|"Price interrupted. “How’d you know? Haskins just called in. About eight-thirty this morning, he saw a horseman on a hill overlooking the pit, challenged him. Satterlee told Haskins he heard on the eight o’clock news about a car going into the pit and he rode over to take a look since the property belonged to the Flynn estate. Satterlee thought somebody from the family should check out what was happening.”"|"Merry, Merry Ghost"|"Carolyn G. Hart"

"ap ~ 11:00"|"Around eleven o’clock"|"“Satterlee was also out on a horse last night.” Cobb’s voice was grim. “Around eleven o’clock. Maybe he was out to a pasture to see about birthing a calf. Maybe he was on that hill overlooking the pit. Now we’ll never be able to prove anything. All we know for sure is that if hoof marks were left last night, they can never be distinguished from the ones his horse left this morning.” He stalked to his desk, picked up the phone. “Benson, get with Haskins out at the brick plant. Rope off the area where he saw a horseman this morning. Search the area for a rifle shell. Or for footprints or bike-tread prints. Search like you’re hunting for a silver grain of sand.” He clicked off the phone, slammed into the swivel chair behind his desk, slammed a fist on the desktop. “I don’t like to be screwed over. But Satterlee’s too clever by half. He drew a fat red arrow pointing to the place the shooter stood.”"|"Merry, Merry Ghost"|"Carolyn G. Hart"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"“A will that leaves everything to Susan Flynn’s grandson. That will has disappeared.” Cobb leaned forward and stared at Johnny with gimlet eyes. “Kim Weaver called each of Susan Flynn’s heirs to tell them about the meeting at Farrell’s office at two o’clock. I’m guessing she told one of them about the new will and together they agreed that she’d keep it quiet. For a price. Or maybe she called Peg Flynn’s boyfriend Dave Lewis. Whoever she called, we know she had an appointment with someone at the old brick plant at eleven o’clock and she was to bring the will. You can help us find out which of Susan Flynn’s heirs”—he ticked them off one by one—“Jacqueline Flynn, Peg Flynn, Tucker Satterlee, Gina Satterlee, and Harrison Hammond, knew Kim Weaver well enough to conspire to prevent that will from reaching Susan Flynn’s lawyer. Or maybe the contact was with Dave Lewis. Peg Flynn should know whether Lewis knew Weaver.”"|"Merry, Merry Ghost"|"Carolyn G. Hart"

00:00|midnight|"The early evening Christmas Eve service for families with young children had always been one of my favorites. The magnificent midnight service is triumphant and glorious, an outpouring of joy, but there is something heartfelt and touching when the younger children, to the vibrant sound of “Once in Royal David’s City,” come down the central aisle, the little boys in bathrobes as shepherds and the little girls with wire halos and cardboard angel wings, to gather around the wooden crib and sing “Away in the Manger,” their childish voices rising in the sweetest song of all."|"Merry, Merry Ghost"|"Carolyn G. Hart"
00:00|Midnight|"Outside I circled high above Adelaide, glorying one last time in the brilliance of the holiday lights. I heard clear and sweet and beautiful the strains of “It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,” a midnight such as this."|"Merry, Merry Ghost"|"Carolyn G. Hart"
