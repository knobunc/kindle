02:00|"2 A.M."|"I cannot say I am nostalgic for the outhouse, because anyone who has ever had to visit one at 2 A.M. in January with a flashlight and a rolled-up back issue of the Anniston Star will tell you that the first contact with that cold pine board is damned exhilarating. When I was five, as I was then, I had to get a running start from the willow tree to leap high enough to reach the seat, and then was left with the uncomfortable truth that there was no way to shut the door. Sometimes Momma would see me and, understanding, close the door for me, and she would not grin about it. Sam would not only leave the door open but would sneak around the corner of the house and throw rocks at me, once my britches were down, and once he locked a mean tomcat in there with me and just leaned against the door, laughing. It sounds, now, like a cartoon. I damn near died."|"All Over but the Shoutin'"|"Rick Bragg"
06:30|"6:30 A.M."|"I came to see the little house we lived in, surrounded on two sides by the cotton field, on one side by a vast green pasture and on the other by creek and swamp, as the place we belonged. I knew that if I ran outside at precisely 6:30 A.M., I could see the big yellow bus come and take my brother to Roy Webb Elementary School. I knew that most of the time he would throw a rock at me before he got on that bus but sometimes he would wave, and I thought that was the best thing in all the world."|"All Over but the Shoutin'"|"Rick Bragg"

You could not have forced him into a church pew with a bazooka. But we did not need a hymnal. We did not need an eighty-year-old woman pecking on a church organ. We got out of bed at 6 A.M. on Sunday and heard “Closer Walk with Thee” sung by people who owned a tour bus."|"All Over but the Shoutin'"|"Rick Bragg"
12:00|noon|"In Protestant churches throughout the South, Dinner on the Ground is nothing more than a big picnic held at dinnertime, which to us is the noon meal. But imagine a hundred church ladies, all schooled in the culinary genius of generations, unloading trunkloads of potato salad, homemade pickles, barbecued pork chops, beans (butter, green, pole, lima, pinto, baked, navy and snap), deviled eggs dusted with cayenne pepper, pones of cornbread cooked with cracklin’s, fried chicken, squash boo cane or a set of support hose. But such an act would have been suicide. The old were of value. The old men could look at a leaf a younger man brought to church in his shirt pocket and tell him what kind of worms were gnawing at his tomato plants, and how to kill them. They could peek under the hood of a car that was running rough and, with a Case pocketknife, adjust the idling, reset the points and adjust the gap on the plugs, all before the first strains of “I’ll Fly Away” drifted from the door."|"All Over but the Shoutin'"|"Rick Bragg"

It was after nine o’clock, but a river of yellow taxi cabs still ebbed and flowed down Broadway and Seventh Avenue, merging with a chorus of curses shouted in a dozen languages, unheard behind the tightly closed windows. The sidewalks still teemed, even at that hour, and I thought to myself, “Don’t any of these damn people ever go home?” Some of them, the ragged ones who clutched at wrinkled garbage bags full of treasure and used plastic forks, were home already."|"All Over but the Shoutin'"|"Rick Bragg"

I knew that across town, near the United Nations, the homeless would be spreading their blankets over the hot steam from the sewer grates, retiring for the evening. On Madison Avenue they would pull cardboard into the recessed foyers of the stores, and lie down just inches from the wealth that glinted on the other side of the glass. Down in the Meat Packing District, transvestite hookers would prance from car to car, nearly naked, their skin turning bone white in the cold."|"All Over but the Shoutin'"|"Rick Bragg"

I have been so sickened by killing and dying that sleep was just one more dream in bed at 4 A.M. But even then, I was drawn to those stories. There was something about the rich darkness of it, of that struggle by people at risk, people in trouble, that made all other stories seem trivial. They were the most important stories in the newspaper. I wanted to write them, only them."|"All Over but the Shoutin'"|"Rick Bragg"

The corrupt military has its own sources of income, contraband, drugs and protection rackets. The embargo only inconveniences the rich. But a missionary said he had seen the number of people in line for food double in just two weeks at his mission. The army shoots people who break in line for gasoline. The migration already has started in Port-au-Prince. The people are walking out of the city, into the mountains, to get closer to the food. From the air, they look like a caravan of rags, with buckets on their heads and babies in their arms. Trucks that carry food from the docks and fields don’t reach the poor of the cities because the trucks don’t have fuel. Aristide wants a complete embargo to force his return, but the hungry and the well-fed agree it won’t happen that way. The embargo already has cost an estimated 5,000 jobs, as plants close. Another 10,000 were lost over the past year as the political tension grew. Many people with jobs can’t get to their work because there is no gas. Stalled cars block the roads. Blackouts silence the music in the bars. Sirens sound at 10 and 11, warning people to go inside. At 11:01 sharp, gunshots break the silence, and people hope it’s only the soldiers firing warning shots into the air. Haiti’s society is disintegrating. Aristide waits. The soldiers play with their guns. Ask Haitians what they think will come of all this and they shake their heads. Haiti’s story, the religious say, is pulled straight from the Book of Exodus. The poor Haitians wandered in the wilderness for 200 years, and found the man who promised to lead them out. His exile is just part of their wandering, their suffering.”"|"All Over but the Shoutin'"|"Rick Bragg"

Angeles grabbed the gun of one young man and the hammer chewed a groove in his hand as the man jerked over and over on the trigger. Finally one of the bullets hit him in the hip. He lay on the floor, pretending to be dead, quietly praying the men would not shoot again. One robber dragged the bleeding Celado into a storeroom and started beating him in the head with a gun, trying to make him tell where the store kept its money. When Leon ran into the room the man shot him in the arm and ran. A few hours after being shot, while Celado and Angeles lay in the hospital, Leon was back at the cash register of his bodega. Blood still seeped from the bandage. ‘I have nine children,’ he said. Angeles was back at work a few days later. He is still in pain, the bullet grating against muscle tissue.
