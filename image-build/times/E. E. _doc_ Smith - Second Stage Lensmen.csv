12:00|noon|"Listen, my beautiful but dumb guide,"" Kinnison counseled the Lyranian girl as they neared their objective. ""I see that you're forgetting all your good girl-scout resolutions and are getting all hot and bothered again. I'm telling you now for the last time to watch your step. If that zwilnik person has even a split second's warning that I'm on her tail all hell will be out for noon, and I don't mean perchance."""|"Second Stage Lensmen"|"E. E. _doc_ Smith"
"ap 05:36"|"Twenty Four of Six"|"""And when Nadreck of Palain VII admits to being certain of anything,"" another thought appeared, ""nothing in the macrocosmic universe is more certain.""
""I thank you, Twenty Four of Six, for the expression of confidence.""
""And I thank both of you particularly, as well as all of you collectively,"" Kinnison broadcast. Intelligences by the millions broke away from the linkage. As soon as the two were alone:"|"Second Stage Lensmen"|"E. E. _doc_ Smith"

At two disadvantages, really, for Boskonia then had neither Lensmen nor a  Z9M9Z;  and Haynes, canny old master strategist that he was, worked upon them both."|"Second Stage Lensmen"|"E.

First, stupidity: He did not perceive, at even as late a time as noon, when he took all my air away from me to meet the feint from the north, that the attack was not to follow any orthodox pattern. Second, incompetence: The orders he gave me could not possibly have stopped any serious attack through any one of the passes I was supposed to defend. Third, inefficiency: No efficient commander refuses to listen to suggestions from his officers, as he refused to listen to me last night."""|"Second Stage Lensmen"|"E. E. _doc_ Smith"

No one who has once smelled the fragrance of Thralian thorn-flower at midnight will ever forget itâ€”it is as though the poignant sweetness of the mountain syringa has been blended harmoniously with the heavy, entrancing scent of the jasmine and the appealing pungency of the lily-of-the-valley. Statues of gleaming white stone and of glinting metal were spaced infrequently over acres and acres of springy, close-clipped turf. Trees, not over-high but massive of bole and of tremendous spread and thickness of foliage, cast shadows of impenetrable black."|"Second Stage Lensmen"|"E. E. _doc_ Smith"
