"ap 04:00"|four|"She makes me sweat it out and doesn’t answer for a good ten seconds, though it feels a lot longer. “Sure,” she says at last, like she doesn’t really care. “Come over to my house tomorrow at four. I should be back from lacrosse practice by then.”"|"Being Henry David"|"Cal Armistead"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"“All right, just let me know as soon as possible so we can put it in the program,” says Ms. Coleman. “Good work today. Be here at seven on Saturday, ready to play.”"|"Being Henry David"|"Cal Armistead"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"“We will,” Hailey says. She turns to the rest of us. “Can you all practice at my house Wednesday afternoon? Like three o’clock?” Everybody says yes."|"Being Henry David"|"Cal Armistead"
"~ 02:00"|"around two a.m."|"I got home around two a.m., paid Jessica almost an entire month’s allowance for baby-sitting Rosie, and then slept in till noon on Saturday. That’s when I woke up to Rosie standing by my bed, staring down at me with her hands on her hips. I must have felt those huge blue eyes boring into my skull, demanding that I wake up. Of course, she was already dressed in her white tights and pink leotard."|"Being Henry David"|"Cal Armistead"

"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"It’s around noon when a park ranger heading downhill meets me on the trail. I register a gray-beige shirt and brown shorts, a straw-colored hat. “The wind is getting fierce up there,” he tells me. “We haven’t closed down the summit yet, but we probably will. You might want to turn around and try this another day.”"|"Being Henry David"|"Cal Armistead"
00:00|midnight|"“Henry,” he says doubtfully, trying it out. “You don’t look like a Henry. I’ll call you Hank.” And just like that, I become Hank. “So, Hank, I think it’s about time for a midnight snack. You got any money?”"|"Being Henry David"|"Cal Armistead"
"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"“Look, it’s past midnight in New York City, Hank. You really want to be here at Penn Station all alone with the crazies?”"|"Being Henry David"|"Cal Armistead"
"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"Jack leads me through the charged air, turning left down one street, then another. The place is alive with people and noise, even though it’s past midnight. Taxicabs clatter by and honk for no apparent reason. A guy in a dirty black jacket sits on a milk crate playing an acoustic guitar, and I stop to watch his fingers fly across the frets, his right hand picking and strumming. A woman drops a dollar bill into his open guitar case. Jack comes back and grabs my arm just as I empty out the coins in my pocket."|"Being Henry David"|"Cal Armistead"
"~ 16:00"|"about 4 p.m."|"Twenty minutes into the four-hour ride to Boston, I finally relax, going over my itinerary in my head over and over again to settle my twitchy brain. The train will arrive at South Station in Boston. The lady in the ticket booth told me I should take a cab to North Station. And from there, a commuter train to Concord. If all goes well, I should get in about 4 p.m. today."|"Being Henry David"|"Cal Armistead"
"~ 00:00"|"around midnight"|"After playing around with this bizarre phenomenon for a while, it occurs to me that what I’ve got has a name: photographic memory. And I almost laugh out loud, right there in the train. I’m a kid with amnesia and a photographic memory. Can’t remember anything that happened to me before around midnight last night, but everything I’ve read since then is chiseled into my brain. Talk about a memory gone completely twisted."|"Being Henry David"|"Cal Armistead"
07:00|"seven a.m."|"He smiles, which makes friendly creases around his eyes. “Well, just so you know, Walden Pond doesn’t officially open until seven a.m.” He pulls back a coat sleeve to consult his watch. “And it’s about six forty-five at the moment.”"|"Being Henry David"|"Cal Armistead"
