12:00|noon|"FOUR days later the small green schooner lay motionless on a glassy sea. No land was in sight nor any other vessel. It was close on noon. Captain Flint was standing by the deckhouse with his sextant at his eye. John was beside him with a stopwatch. At any moment now the sun would be at its highest, Captain Flint and John would work out latitude and longitude and presently a new red-inked circle on the chart would show exactly where they were. Titty and Roger were watching the navigators, Susan was sewing, sitting on the skylight, and Nancy was up at the foremast cross-trees looking hopefully out through a telescope."|"Missee Lee"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 01:00"|"One o’clock"|"“We’ll shift petrol, anyway,” said Captain Flint, “but not till evening. What about those curried eggs?” He glanced in through the deckhouse window to see the clock. “One o’clock.”"|"Missee Lee"|"Arthur Ransome"
12:00|noon|"“Not enough to stir a feather,” said Captain Flint. “And whatever you say, I don’t like it. Roger’s right. We’ll wear a hole in the chart if we keep on marking noon positions all in the same place. As soon as the engineer’s awake, we’ll shift some petrol from the main tanks and let the little donkey push her along.”"|"Missee Lee"|"Arthur Ransome"
12:00|noon|"“Let’s have a look at that almanac,” he said. “It’s not noon yet. We’ve time to do it, if we can only get a sea horizon. I can make a good guess at the longitude. Wish I was surer of the day. One night in that junk, one in the fort, three in Chang’s zoo. How many days have I been cramming Latin?” He turned the pages of the almanac, tore out the table of corrections, folded it carefully and put it in his pocket, and then tore out an advertisement page and scribbled some figures in the margin."|"Missee Lee"|"Arthur Ransome"
">> 00:00"|"long after midnight"|"IT was long after midnight. Here and there the lanterns hung from the houses were guttering out. The legs of the little dragon felt as if they were made of lead."|"Missee Lee"|"Arthur Ransome"
00:00|midnight|"The night was no longer silent. There was a noise of rushing, splashing water, growing louder every minute, echoing to and fro between the high cliffs of the gorge. The little junk leapt and swerved, so that even lying down they had to hang on to something so as not to slide across the deck. On the open river they had seen the first faint promise of dawn. Here, between the cliffs, they were back at midnight. They could see nothing. Water that must have been tossed up a wall of rock came down in spray, like fine rain, wetting them where they lay. The mainsail with a frantic creaking of the bamboo battens flung violently across, and was brought up with a jerk and twang of the sheets."|"Missee Lee"|"Arthur Ransome"
