"ap ~ 05:10"|"about five-ten"|"“We’ve got somebody coming up fast from astern, Skip.” Commander Hurlman never looked up from her display. “Looks fairly small, maybe seventy, eighty k-tons, but whoever it is has a military-grade compensator. He’s eighteen-point-three light-seconds back, but he’s got an overtake of two thousand KPS and he’s pulling about five-ten gees.” The captain nodded, and his expression was grim."|"Honor Among Enemies"|"David Weber"
"ap 10:37"|Ten-Thirty-Seven|"“First,” she said, “we’ve finally received our unit designation. As of zero-three-thirty today, we’re on the list as Task Group Ten-Thirty-Seven.” She smiled wryly. ” Task group’ may be a bit grand for the likes of us, but I thought you’d like to know we have a name now.”"|"Honor Among Enemies"|"David Weber"
"ap 07:10"|Seven-Ten|"“Of course, My Lady. Your convoy is scheduled for a three-day layover. If you’ll take a pinnace to Alpha Station, one of my pinnaces will pick you up there for delivery to Derfflinger. I’ve taken the liberty of pre-clearing you for an approach to the civilian VIP bay at Alpha Seven-Ten, and station security will see to it that the gallery is unoccupied when you dock.”"|"Honor Among Enemies"|"David Weber"
"ap ~ 00:58"|"about two to one"|"“Guts?” Harkness repeated very softly, then laughed. “Kid, you’ve got a hell of a lot more guts than Steilman!” Aubrey blinked at him, and the senior chief shook his head. “You’re scared to death of him, but you’re not exactly falling apart in panic,” he pointed out. “If you were gonna do that, you’d’ve been screaming for the Bosun the minute you reached sickbay. Nope, your problem, Wanderman, is that you’ve got too much guts to panic and not quite enough to do the same thing ‘cause you thought it through and realized it was the smart move. You’re sort of stuck out there in the middle. But I want you to think about Steilman for a minute. Think about who he decided to beat the crap out of. He outmasses you, what, about two to one? He’s more’n twice your age, and he’s got ten times your experience. But did he pick a fight with me? Did he stand up to the Bosun? Or Bruce Maxwell? Nope. He went after a green kid he figured for an easy mark, and he was real careful to get you alone. How much guts d’you think that took?”"|"Honor Among Enemies"|"David Weber"
"ap 05:53"|"seven to six"|"Twenty minutes later, Aubrey Wanderman knew he never, and he meant never, wanted to get the Captain or Sergeant Major Hallowell pissed at him. The Sergeant Major had out-pointed the Captain by seven to six, but even Aubrey knew it could have gone the other way just as easily. She’d also managed something else Aubrey never had; Gunny Hallowell was actually sweating and out of breath when they exchanged bows at the end of the session. Of course, the Captain was, too, and she had an interesting bruise developing on her right cheek."|"Honor Among Enemies"|"David Weber"
"ap 03:15"|"Three hours and fifteen minutes"|"Three hours and fifteen minutes. She and Fred Cousins had considered the maximum range of Warnecke’s hand-held transmitter carefully before she allowed the privateer to exchange it for the original. It was remotely possible, assuming a sufficiently sensitive receiving array, that a unit that small might have a range of as much as two light-minutes. With that in mind, Honor had decided Warnecke had to be at least five light-minutes from the planet before she dared take any action against him, and that time had now come."|"Honor Among Enemies"|"David Weber"
"ap 01:01"|One-Oh-One|"“Sure. It’s listed as Constructive Paranoia One-Oh-One in the catalog,” Honor said deadpan, and Cardones chuckled. Then she took her feet from her desk and let her chair come back upright. “Okay. I’ll float the basing idea by Gutierrez before we leave, no commitment, just sounding her out. Assuming we detach LAC One and the pods, how soon can we pull out?”"|"Honor Among Enemies"|"David Weber"
"ap 02:05"|"two hours, five minutes"|"“Time to enemy intercept?”
“Missile range in two hours, five minutes.”
“But she still has us only on gravities?”"|"Honor Among Enemies"|"David Weber"
"ap 01:17"|"one hour, seventeen minutes"|"“He’s found another few gees of acceleration somewhere, Skipper,” Jennifer Hughes said. “Revised time to missile range is now one hour, seventeen minutes.”"|"Honor Among Enemies"|"David Weber"
"ap 06:50"|Six-Fifty|"Her entire starboard side was shattered from Frame Thirty-One aft to Frame Six-Fifty. The empty LAC bays blew open like so many glasses shattering under an enraged heel. Magazines Two and Four were torn apart, along with every tube except Missile Two. Six of her eight graser mounts exploded in ruin, taking virtually their entire crews with them. A laser slashed deep into the heart of her hull, destroying Fusion One and stabbing through the brig, where Randy Steilman and his fellows would never come to trial, and another blew straight into the command deck itself. Shock and concussion whipsawed the bridge madly, bulkheads and hull members tore like tissue, and a raging hurricane plucked Jennifer Hughes from her bridge chair despite her shock frame and whipped her into space. No one would ever find her body, but it scarcely mattered, for the tidal bore of atmosphere slammed her against the edge of the hull breach and shattered her helmet instantly. John Kanehama screamed over his com as a flying alloy spear impaled him; Senior Chief O’Halley was cut in half by a splinter as long as he was tall; and Aubrey Wanderman retched into his helmet as the same splinter slashed through his own control party and tore Carolyn Wolcott and Lieutenant Jansen apart."|"Honor Among Enemies"|"David Weber"
"ap 07:17"|Seven-Seventeen|"“All right, Haverty,” she said briskly. “Once you’ve got that leak in Seven-Seventeen patched, I want pressure back in there. Commander Ryder needs to move people out of sickbay to relieve crowding, and that’s the best place to put them. So as soon as we’ve got pressure, inform Senior Chief Lewis so we can organize a working party to move them. Once you’re through in Seven-Seventeen, I want you and your people to do an eyeball on Main Environmental. Then…”"|"Honor Among Enemies"|"David Weber"
