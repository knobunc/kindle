"ap ~ 00:58"|"about two to one"|"“Guts?” Harkness repeated very softly, then laughed. “Kid, you’ve got a hell of a lot more guts than Steilman!” Aubrey blinked at him, and the senior chief shook his head. “You’re scared to death of him, but you’re not exactly falling apart in panic,” he pointed out. “If you were gonna do that, you’d’ve been screaming for the Bosun the minute you reached sickbay. Nope, your problem, Wanderman, is that you’ve got too much guts to panic and not quite enough to do the same thing ‘cause you thought it through and realized it was the smart move. You’re sort of stuck out there in the middle. But I want you to think about Steilman for a minute. Think about who he decided to beat the crap out of. He outmasses you, what, about two to one? He’s more’n twice your age, and he’s got ten times your experience. But did he pick a fight with me? Did he stand up to the Bosun? Or Bruce Maxwell? Nope. He went after a green kid he figured for an easy mark, and he was real careful to get you alone. How much guts d’you think that took?”"|"Honor Among Enemies"|"David Weber"
"ap 05:53"|"seven to six"|"Twenty minutes later, Aubrey Wanderman knew he never, and he meant never, wanted to get the Captain or Sergeant Major Hallowell pissed at him. The Sergeant Major had out-pointed the Captain by seven to six, but even Aubrey knew it could have gone the other way just as easily.

Of course, the Captain was, too, and she had an interesting bruise developing on her right cheek."|"Honor Among Enemies"|"David Weber"
"ap 03:15"|"Three hours and fifteen minutes"|"Three hours and fifteen minutes. She and Fred Cousins had considered the maximum range of Warnecke’s hand-held transmitter carefully before she allowed the privateer to exchange it for the original. It was remotely possible, assuming a sufficiently sensitive receiving array, that a unit that small might have a range of as much as two light-minutes. With that in mind, Honor had decided Warnecke had to be at least five light-minutes from the planet before she dared take any action against him, and that time had now come."|"Honor Among Enemies"|"David Weber"
"ap 02:05"|"two hours, five minutes"|"“Time to enemy intercept?”
“Missile range in two hours, five minutes.”
“But she still has us only on gravities?”"|"Honor Among Enemies"|"David Weber"
"ap 01:17"|"one hour, seventeen minutes"|"“He’s found another few gees of acceleration somewhere, Skipper,” Jennifer Hughes said. “Revised time to missile range is now one hour, seventeen minutes.”"|"Honor Among Enemies"|"David Weber"
