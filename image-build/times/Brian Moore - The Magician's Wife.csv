"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"The Colonel left the house at five o’clock. As his carriage drove out towards the main gates Emmeline put down her petit point and went to look through the window of her sitting room. She wondered about this visitor. He must be important. For the last two weeks her husband had refused to see anyone, remaining locked up in his workroom with orders that he not be disturbed. As the Colonel’s carriage reached the gates, a painted mechanical gate-keeper wheeled jerkily out of its lodge, legs moving on an electric track as it approached and touched the lock of the gates. The gates swung open, the automaton stiffly raising its right arm in salute. When the carriage had crossed the hidden trip wire which lay at the entrance the gates began to close. As the carriage moved off in a wall of dust down the rutted road which led to Tours, the automaton trundled back into its lodge and an electric bell sounded within the house signalling that the visitor had departed. A moment later she heard a second bell. She looked up at the bell panel installed in her sitting room. That would be for Jules. Soon Jules would come upstairs to tell her that the Master could not leave his work to join her for supper."|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"
12:00|noon|"‘I don’t know. I may have to come to Paris for a day or two but in the meantime I must get on with my work. Now what about you, do you think you could leave tomorrow? If so, I’ll order the phaeton to be ready to take you to the station. The Paris train leaves at noon.’"|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"The Emperor. Society. The Second Empire. Everyone talked about this new Paris. The year before last in the Rue de Rivoli at eight o’clock on a September evening Emmeline stood in a crowd of spectators, watching a file of carriages move into the courtyard of the Palais des Tuileries. From these carriages she saw, descending, gentlemen in knee breeches and silk stockings, officers in dress uniforms and decorations, ladies in billowing crinolines, their breasts almost bare, their necks and arms adorned with pearls, rubies and diamonds. A woman beside Emmeline pointed out two famous beauties, the Duchesse de Pourtales and the Marquesa de Contadades, as the guests moved under a marquee into the entrance hall of the Pavillon de l’Horloge. Swiss guards stood to attention there, halberds to hand, plumed helmets on their heads. It was a sight Emmeline would not forget, a sight she had gazed on that night with the pleasure of watching actors in some theatrical extravaganza, a glimpse of a grand world she would never know. And now, suddenly, her husband had entered it."|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"
15:00|"3 p.m."|"‘There’s no need,’ Madame Cournet said. ‘I’ve already received Monsieur Lambert’s permission to make the appointment. It’s arranged for Thursday at 3 p.m. in Monsieur West’s villa at Suresnes. Believe me, it will be one of the most delightful experiences of your life. Such taste, such an artist. You’ll be enchanted.’"|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"
15:00|"three o’clock in the afternoon"|"That Thursday, arriving with Madame Cournet at precisely three o’clock in the afternoon at a Parisian villa in the suburbs of Paris, Emmeline wearing her very best daytime dress, coat and hat was shown by a servant into a reception room crowded with gilt-edged chairs, gold mirrors, embroidered pillows, small tables covered with knick-knacks and silver-framed photographs. She and Madame Cournet were invited to sit on a large red satin sofa. In an adjoining room a fountain of eau-de-Cologne spurted continuously, filling the air with a sweet yet pungent odour. Monsieur West made his entrance ten minutes later, accompanied by three young male assistants. He was enormously fat and spoke French with an English accent which Emmeline found hard to understand. He wore a loose silk smock, black velvet trousers and a huge velvet beret which fell over his right eye. He described himself as an artist and in the next hour, having inspected Emmeline as though she were a piece of furniture, he made sketches and notes which in subsequent weeks evolved into morning costumes of grey velvet, black velvet and dark-blue poplin adorned with sable tippets. There were also sable and chinchilla hats with coats to match; five afternoon gowns and seven sumptuous evening dresses, each costume, gown and dress made to emphasize that it was unique and indisputably the work of an artist in haute couture. Because all of the evening dresses were crinolines, Emmeline had to practise walking in them, so difficult were they to manoeuvre. In addition, under their wide hoops she must wear pantaloons. And as she lacked certain items of jewellery which Monsieur West considered essential, Madame Cournet took her to a discreet boutique where decorated fans, bracelets and bandeaux were rented out to her for a period of a month against a large deposit."|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"
14:00|"2 p.m."|"So, on the morning of the 22nd, Emmeline, dressed in Monsieur West’s elegant travelling clothes, took the old woman to the Gare du Nord where Jules, uncomfortable in his new uniform, stood at the station entrance guarding four trunks and the six huge wooden boxes that housed the West crinolines. When porters had been summoned, the two servants followed the luggage into the station, Emmeline remaining outside the entrance not wanting to be the first guest to arrive. At 2 p.m. when at last she went in, she saw at once, on Platform Number One, a smart train, its carriages adorned with the Napoleonic eagle, waiting under a sign, Extra et Imperial. Standing near this sign was a gentleman who, when he saw her approach, introduced himself as Vicomte Walsh, an imperial chamberlain. She was obliged to tell him that her husband had not yet arrived."|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"
"ap 02:15"|two-fifteen|"He ushered her on to the train and installed her in a large salon carriage fitted out with comfortable armchairs and tables strewn with illustrated newspapers. She thanked him and sat uneasily alone until two-fifteen when, suddenly, the seven first-class passenger coaches began to fill with gentlemen in morning clothes and ladies in travelling cloaks and hats, many of whom seemed to know each other, bowing, nodding, exchanging conversation about acquaintances, receptions, balls and other matters of which Emmeline knew nothing. Her unease became panic. Where was Henri?"|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"
"ap 02:25"|two-twenty-five|"At two-twenty-five precisely the train engine sounded a piercing signal. At that moment, as though he had planned it, Lambert came strolling down the platform. He stopped to consult the imperial chamberlain and on entering her carriage, came to Emmeline, kissing her formally on both cheeks."|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"
14:33|"2.33 p.m."|"Reluctantly, he sat facing her after bowing to the other gentlemen and ladies in the carriage, strangers who formally and distantly bowed back. At 2.33 p.m., with a second piercing shriek and a sudden convulsive jerk, the imperial train left the station."|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"
"ap 07:30"|seven-thirty|"‘Your servants will be sent up at once, Monsieur,’ the valet said. ‘And the First Chamberlain wishes to remind you that dinner is at seven-thirty and that the Emperor and Empress will welcome you in the grande salle des fêtes at 7 p.m.’"|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"
19:00|"7 p.m."|"‘Your servants will be sent up at once, Monsieur,’ the valet said. ‘And the First Chamberlain wishes to remind you that dinner is at seven-thirty and that the Emperor and Empress will welcome you in the grande salle des fêtes at 7 p.m.’"|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"
"ap 04:30"|four-thirty|"He pretended not to hear. She sat down on the bed. She felt dizzy. It was nerves, she knew, but knowing it did not help. Madame Cournet had told her one must change costumes three times daily. It was now four-thirty. As she must prepare for the imperial reception in the grande salle des fêtes, she would not have time to change into afternoon costume but must put on the evening dress of black lace over white tulle with twisted green velvet bows, a décolleté and crinoline. Madame Cournet had recommended it as the proper choice for a first meeting with the Emperor and Empress."|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"
"ap < 07:00"|"Shortly before seven"|"Shortly before seven, having completed her toilette with the aid of Françoise, the old but skilful lady’s maid, Emmeline went out into the sitting room. Her husband, following instructions which had been given him earlier, had dressed for this first evening in court dress of white knee breeches with white silk stockings and a dress frock coat. She saw him rub his hands together for warmth as he stared at his image in the pier glass which was placed in a corner of the sitting room. The fire had long gone out."|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"
"ap 07:10"|"ten minutes past seven"|"He was right, she supposed, for as they left their room a valet was waiting for them in the corridor. With a bow, he indicated that they follow him, leading them downstairs and through long corridors to arrive at last at the grande salle des fêtes. Here, footmen stood at the doors of an immense salon. Emmeline looked up at the painted frescoed ceiling, the glitter of crystal chandeliers and then, in trepidation, at the guests now coming into the room. At precisely ten minutes past seven a footman announced the arrival of the First Chamberlain, the Vicomte de Laferrière, and the Grande Maîtresse, the Duchesse de Bassano, who moved down the lines of guests murmuring formal words of welcome. Emmeline did not know whether to curtsy or bow and so stood, bobbing her head foolishly as these grand persons passed by. Although she guessed that by now there must be almost a hundred people in this huge salon, it still seemed half deserted. A chamberlain came up to Henri."|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"
"ap 08:30"|eight-thirty|"She nodded in a way which she hoped could mean either yes or no. And again felt panic. Aristocrats, hunting dogs, things she knew nothing about. How was she going to get through this conversation, this evening, this week? But then she looked again to her right. The Colonel, talking to his neighbour, caught her eye and gave her a complicit smile. Reassured, she picked up the menu. There were six courses, soup, foie gras, fish, roasts, lobsters, desserts. How could they possibly eat all of this in an hour? But as the band continued to play and the dishes were put in front of her it was, at least, a reprieve from having to talk to the Count de Burgos, who, once he saw food, abandoned all attempts at speech. Coffee and liqueurs were served at the table and precisely at eight-thirty the Emperor and Empress rose. At once, lackeys came forward and drew chairs from under the guests, forcing everyone to stand up."|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"
12:00|Noon|"Noon. In the city’s mosques, in the enclosed courtyards of private dwellings, in dark alleys, in narrow lanes, and, outside the walls of Milianah throughout the great encampment of tents and huts, men covered their heads, removed their shoes, unrolled carpets and rugs, prostrating themselves in prayer. In the barracks square of the French fort, the Kabyle workers who had erected the stands, ignoring Lambert, Emmeline and Deniau who stood under the shaded arches of the square, knelt in unison, heads turned towards Mecca, murmuring their prayers as though each were alone with God. Emmeline, as always moved by this devotion, turned to Deniau and asked, ‘I have been wondering. What is it they are saying?’"|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"
"ap 01:00"|one|"‘I’m afraid I want you to take up your position hidden in the wings, shortly before one. I know it will be an hour’s wait there, alone, behind the stage. I apologize. But it is one way of ensuring that Henri’s entrance has the maximum effect.’"|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"At one o’clock in the arid midday heat, Emmeline, wearing the long grey dress Lambert had chosen for her and carrying the headdress and veil given her by Deniau, came down from the apartments and, unnoticed by the workmen who were putting the last benches in place at the rear of the square, entered the makeshift room in the wings to the left of the stage. There in a corner were the electric levers she must pull, the cornucopia she must hand to her husband, the feather plumes he would scatter on the floor for her to pick up, the bonbons and favours which she must offer to the audience. She sat at a small mirror, first covering her hair with the headdress, then fitting the veil over her face so that only her eyes and forehead were visible. When she had done this a masked Arab woman stared at her through the mirror as though by this simple act of disguise Emmeline Lambert was no more. Minutes later, from the streets outside, she heard the clatter of horses’ hooves, the shouted cries of camel drivers, the distant firecracker sound of rifles. Turning to look through the slats of the dressing room she saw the first of the Arab companies arriving in the square of the fort. An unseen French military band struck up a martial air as below her vantage point a colourful mass of Arab men, wearing white, red or blue burnouses, many carrying old-fashioned rifles, some with swords and daggers, came strolling through the aisles where French soldiers and a handful of interpreters waited to show them to their seats. There were no women in this audience. She looked again at the veiled female in the mirror. She looked at the levers, those black handles which she must pull to inflict pain. Today, Henri depends on me. He will not forgive me if I fail."|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"

"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"At eight o’clock the following morning Emmeline and Lambert saw, circling below in the courtyard, four horsemen: Deniau, Hersant and two young lieutenants of a Zouave regiment. Two additional horses were held by grooms, waiting their arrival. Once mounted their procession trotted out into the streets of Milianah. There, ten Arab riders, wearing red burnouses and armed with rifles, moved in as escort."|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"
12:00|noon|"Ahead on the plain, shimmering like a mirage in the noon sun, Emmeline saw an encampment of tents grouped around a large, high-domed, gaily pelmeted central structure. Camels, horses, sheep and goats were enclosed in a sort of paddock, guarded by armed horsemen. Deniau, now riding between Emmeline and Lambert, told them that the Aga would be waiting to receive them. ‘Even when he is travelling, as he is now, he moves with a large entourage of warriors, wives and servants. As you can see, this is no ordinary encampment.’"|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"

Luncheon at eleven, less than thirty minutes to change. He led her back to her rooms and went off to summon the old maid. Frantic, Emmeline sat, her shoulders bare, while the old maid, mouth full of pins, began to put up her hair."|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"

The Emperor then sent for the actors, who, having changed out of their costumes, appeared to a round of applause. Emmeline watched Coquelin talk to the Emperor and saw that he was able to put the Emperor at ease, laughing and chatting with him in a casual way which none of the distinguished guests seemed to have managed in the preceding days. For some reason this comforted her and made her feel more secure than at any time since her arrival in Compiègne. The Emperor was a man, he was human, he wanted to enjoy himself; he who was at the top of the social ladder did not look down on Coquelin who, like her husband, was a person who performed on stage."|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"At eleven o’clock refreshments were brought in, the carriages were announced and making a ‘reverence’ to Their Majesties the artists took their leave.

"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"At eight o’clock she was escorted in to dinner, not by Colonel Deniau but by a gentleman whose name she did not catch, a stout dyspeptic person who talked constantly throughout the meal. ‘Are you cold?’ was his first question and then without waiting for an answer he complained that his room was in a part of the château filled with draughts and a fireplace that smoked. ‘If you’re not a prince or a baron or some grande horizontale who the Emperor is trying to entice into his bed you will always be freezing in this place. And the entertainment! I was here two years ago and on four different evenings we were forced to take part in boring charades. They have rooms full of theatrical costumes and you are asked to choose some ridiculous getup to illustrate an idiotic sentence. Luckily, this isn’t one of the aristocratic séries. Aristocrats love charades. I don’t know about you, Madame, but I find the aristocracy incredibly stupid. Dieu merci, this is what they call a third-tier série where the great majority of our guests, are, as you may have noticed, not the gratin but rich bourgeois, bankers or moneyed foreigners, people the Emperor wants to use in some way.

On His Majesty’s right was an empty chair. The Emperor did not rise, but smiled at her as she slipped into her place. Across the table the Empress nodded to Emmeline in a queenly manner. The Emperor then gestured to the maître d’hôtel and at once the first dishes were brought into the dining room. Behind the Emperor’s chair his personal chasseur took the dish from the hands of the maître d’hôtel and presented it to His Majesty who then helped himself, whereupon the chasseur handed the dish back to the maître d’hôtel as a signal that guests could now be served."|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"

Amid a hubbub of anticipation, the Emperor and Empress led the way into the long gallery which overlooked the cour d’honneur, the vast central courtyard of the château. The Empress, accepting a sable cloak from her lady-in-waiting, followed the Emperor on to the balcony as chamberlains, circulating among the guests, discreetly advised certain favoured ladies, including Emmeline, to follow the imperial couple out into the night. Most of the remaining guests positioned themselves at the twenty windows of the long gallery, while some of the gentlemen, including Lambert, sat on an exterior flight of steps which led down to the cour d’honneur."|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"
17:00|"five o’clock that same afternoon"|"À bientôt? But, at the final luncheon, and afterwards, on the drive to the Compiègne station and during the train journey to Paris, they had no further chance to speak to Their Majesties, who, surrounded by sycophantic guests, seemed hurried and distraught as though, the série ended, they must rush on to yet another engagement. And so it was that at five o’clock that same afternoon on their arrival at the Gare du Nord they watched Colonel Deniau, his luggage carried by two soldiers, striding down the platform as though he also was in a hurry. He saw them and came over, saying to Lambert, ‘We shall be in touch next week. I’ll make all the necessary arrangements. And thank you again, my dear fellow.’ Then, turning to Emmeline, he kissed her hand and oddly enough, said goodbye with the same phrase as the Emperor. ‘À bientôt, dear Madame.’"|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"In the semi-darkness of the hall, clocks in every room of the manor began to sound the hour of eleven, drowning out his final words. Lambert smiled as though their cacophony of chimes was, for him, a sweet, familiar music."|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"
00:00|midnight|"An hour later as the myriad clocks struck midnight Emmeline lay sleepless in her bed. She saw, again, the frightened face of their driver as he whipped up his horse and rushed his carriage towards the mechanical gate, fearing to be trapped in a wizard’s house. To the peasants and even the townspeople in nearby Tours her husband was not, as he thought, a person they regarded with fear and reverence. Fear, yes, but it was a fear of witchcraft, of persons in league with the Evil One. Emmeline knew this, as Lambert would never know it, for her mother was a country woman, born in the Bercy, not far from here. Her mother, while pretending to laugh at such superstitions, was, Emmeline knew, no different from her peasant forebears. In the unchanging world Parisians called La France profonde, night was host to hobgoblins, witches and will-o’-the-wisps. Even in the bright sunlight of a summer’s day you might touch a grassy mound or venture into a field sacred to the fairies, those malevolent others who could cast a spell on you, a spell which brought misfortune. And why should the peasants not believe in such things, passed down from generation to generation? For them the world did not exist outside their townlands. Most did not know how to read or write, few had ever been in a theatre and, even in cities like Tours or Rouen, many among her husband’s audiences believed his inventions and illusions were a gift, granted him by that world which lies hidden behind our visible world, a world ruled by mysterious powers stronger than the Church, capable of miracles no saint could match."|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"
"ap 08:15"|eight-fifteen|"‘We will tie up at eight-fifteen, sir. You will disembark shortly after nine.’"|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"
12:00|noonday|"He then told them that this was the European quarter and that most of the houses here were new. Emmeline saw that the new houses had vaulted arcades in the style of the Rue de Rivoli in Paris. Intersecting the Rue de la Marine were dozens of dark alleys less than four feet in width where passersby must turn sideways to avoid someone coming from the opposite direction. These glimpses of a city hidden behind the new European houses, a warren of windowless buildings, their upper storeys projecting over the lower floors in a way which made the alleys dark and ominous even in the noonday sun, filled Emmeline with a sense of foreboding. How could people living in these obscure menacing mazes be impressed by the man who sat beside her, anxiously questioning the aide-de-camp about the safe transport of his magician’s paraphernalia through these narrow lanes?"|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"
11:00|"11 a.m."|"At 11 a.m. when they had washed and changed, a servant appeared to tell them that they were invited to luncheon with the Governor-General’s principal secretary, Monsieur de la Garde. The meal was served in a shuttered dining room cooled by fans, wielded by Negro servants. The food was French and in addition to Monsieur de la Garde there were present three senior diplomatic officers and their wives. The conversation, after some initial welcoming pleasantries, turned quickly to Maréchal Randon’s absence."|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"
21:00|"nine o’clock in the cool of the evening"|"The Lieutenant shook his head. ‘He has not yet been accepted as the Mahdi. That will only happen if he calls for a holy war.’ He turned to Emmeline. ‘I imagine political talk must be boring for you, Madame. Besides, we should be getting back to the residence. We dine at nine o’clock in the cool of the evening. That will give you time to change.’"|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"‘We will assemble in the central court at seven,’ an aide-de-camp told Lambert. ‘Maréchal Randon will arrive at approximately seven-twenty. Those who will be attending this evening are the spiritual and temporal leaders in Algiers and in the regions immediately surrounding the city. The marabouts and sheikhs from other, more distant regions will not be arriving until next week. So, although this is a reception in honour of the Governor-General’s triumph in Kabylia, it is also a rehearsal of your presentation to the Muslim élite. Because of that, and because in the Arab world the marabout is a personage more highly regarded than any sheikh or temporal ruler, Colonel Deniau has suggested that you be the first guest of the evening to be presented to Maréchal Randon. Consequently, in Arab eyes, you will be seen as our leading marabout, a figure of great power.’"|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"

"ap 07:20"|seven-twenty|"And now, at seven-twenty precisely, Emmeline stood beside her husband facing the colonnaded archways through which she could see the Governor-General and his staff approaching, a group of ten officers in dress uniforms wearing decorations followed by several aides-de-camp, and then by the senior French diplomats led by Monsieur de la Garde. The Governor-General, Maréchal Randon, was, Emmeline saw, a short spare man in his late fifties with the air of an administrator rather than a highly decorated soldier. She felt Henri come to attention beside her, felt his tension as he prepared to step on stage in a role different from any he had played before. But at that moment she saw Deniau, walking a little to the left of the Maréchal but with the air of someone of equal rank to the Governor-General himself. And in that moment he raised his head and looked directly at her. He smiled, gave a slight bow and kept on looking at her as the Maréchal’s cortège reached the spot where she and Henri stood. He had not looked at, or acknowledged, her husband and she, for her part, was so transfixed by his gaze that in the moment of being presented to the Governor-General she almost forgot to curtsy. Randon, for his part, bowed in her direction and then, almost theatrically, made a sort of reverence in greeting her husband. Lambert, ever the actor, received this false tribute with a certain solemn dignity, befitting his role of marabout. The Governor-General then passed on down the receiving line, pausing to speak to an old sheikh and to three high-turbaned holy men who had been pointed out earlier as revered marabouts of the Algerine plain. A military band struck up a triumphal march as the Governor’s cortège made a leisurely circle of the colonnaded court. At this point Deniau was lost to Emmeline’s view behind the plumes of water rising from the central fountain. She stood, impatient, as aides-de-camp brought up various sheikhs to exchange greetings with her husband and, as soon as the presentations ended, hurried across the courtyard, pretending to look for someone, but in reality moving directly to the spot where Deniau stood chatting to an imposing figure who was wearing a richly embroidered waistcoat and a red fez."|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"
12:00|midday|"‘And I will be delighted to show it to her. Madame? Could you be ready at, say, midday? I warn you, the streets are too narrow for carriages. You can, however, travel on muleback. Do you ride?’"|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"
12:00|noon|"At noon, from their high towers throughout the city, muezzins raised the white flag of faith, calling believers to prayer. Emmeline, who had spent most of the morning preparing herself for this luncheon, now ran out on to her balcony, hoping to catch a glimpse of these Muslim devotions. But as she stood searching the adjoining rooftops the maid assigned to her quarters came to tell her that a messenger from Colonel Deniau was waiting at the main gates of the residence. When she went down through the central courtyard past the Zouave sentries who saluted her as they held open the gates she saw, standing in the street outside, a Negro, so tall he was almost a giant, his ashen grey skin giving him the look of a corpse. He wore an orange burnous and a red fez, and was holding the reins of a small mule which had been fitted with a sidesaddle. On seeing her he bowed and knelt, cupping his hands in a stirrup with which he lifted her lightly on to the saddle. He then took the reins and guided the mule, walking beside her as they moved along the dark narrow street which wound uphill under stone archways and overhanging balconies that completely shut out the hot noonday sun. This street, like a turn in a maze, led to yet another dark narrow lane and then another and as they progressed the ascent became steeper, the mule carefully picking its way, guided by the black giant who, when the animal hesitated, slapped its flanks with the flat of his huge hand, the palm of which was white as a lady’s glove. In these narrow lanes when Arab pedestrians came towards them, the presence of the mule forced them to take refuge in a doorway or turn sideways as they eased past. But apart from these passersby the city seemed empty of people. The façades of the buildings were uniformly plain, their infrequent windows small, grated holes which gave no view of the interiors. And yet, as her ear became attuned to the jumble of sounds, Emmeline heard, behind these façades, the murmur of female voices, the cries of children and, once, the disconsolate braying of an ass."|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"

12:00|midday|"The roof on to which Deniau now led her was sheltered from the midday sun by a stone arcade running around the parapet. He pointed to an irregular mass of white buildings at the very top of the hillside. ‘That is the Citadel. It was the residence of the Princes of Algiers. If you look at those loopholes in the walls you’ll see where their huge cannons once dominated the city. The Citadel was where the Turkish ruler held court. Over there to the left were the private apartments where he lived with his wives. And then, one morning, almost forty years ago, walking on his rooftop he looked down and saw our fleet approaching these shores. That was the end of Turkish rule.’"|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"
12:00|noonday|"François du Chatel, Archbishop, a gross, towering presence in his white episcopal robes, waited under a parasol held by an acolyte on the steps of the cathedral at the entrance to Rue Divan. At the sound of trumpets which announced that the Governor-General’s party had entered the street, a double row of French officers lined up behind the Archbishop came to attention and drew their sabres to form a ceremonial arch. Emmeline, disembarking from her carriage with the official party, stood beside her husband, waiting, as the Governor-General kissed the episcopal ring and was led inside to the surprising accompaniment of an overture from an Auber opera, played by an army band positioned in a side aisle of the church. Fanning themselves in the noonday heat, the congregation made up of diplomatic representatives, the Prefect and his staff, the leading French, German and Syrian merchants, French army officers, nuns and priests from the diocese’s convents and seminaries, waited for the Mass to begin. In this former mosque, columns fifty feet high supported the cupola which was lit from above by stained-glass windows. The altar was on the north side, decorated by a painting of the Virgin which had been presented to the cathedral by the Pope. Yet above this painting in prominent relief was a series of ornate, interlaced sentences from the Koran which had not been erased despite the fact that they proclaimed in Arabic that there is only one God and Muhammad is his prophet. Even stranger than this juxtaposition was the Mass itself. As priests and acolytes filed out on to the altar the gay martial music continued. Ranks of soldiers in full regimentals stood before the tabernacle and as the service got under way and the sacramental bell rang to announce the miracle of transubstantiation, the noise of twenty drums thundered under the cupola. At the command of their officer the soldiers presented muskets, at the same time bending the right knee and bowing their heads towards the ground. The thundering drumroll continued until the priest finished his prayer."|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"
"> 12:00"|"Shortly after noon"|"Shortly after noon when the muezzins sounded the call for devotions Emmeline, looking down at the courtyard of their lodgings, saw, behind the field of Arab backs prostrate in prayer below her, the arrival of three camels through the main gates of the building. On the leading camel, sitting cross-legged and at ease, wearing a brown burnous over his military uniform, Deniau, who stayed the little caravan until the prayers had ceased. Then making his camel kneel, he gracefully slipped off its back and strode across the courtyard, looking up at her, waving his riding crop in welcome."|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"
"< 12:00"|"Towards midday"|"Next morning as their caravan set out, the sun rose like a threat in the pale dawn sky. The road Deniau had spoken of was a trackless desert landscape with no sign of other travellers. Against the red background of the desert soil neutral shades stood out: their servants’ ochre clothing, the rust and beige of the camels’ hides, the black and brown coats of the horses; all of these dull colourings seeming to intensify the growing heat. Within two hours the sun became a punishment. She felt her hair grow wet. Rivulets of sweat trickled down between her breasts as she spurred her horse, moving ahead of Deniau, unwilling to let him see her heated face and disarrayed coiffure. Towards midday the desert’s rolling dunes changed to a series of steep ravines where her horse slithered and stumbled in a near vertical descent, threatening to tumble her on to the ground. Shortly after noon Deniau halted the caravan, the servants quickly erecting a goatskin lean-to, under which they laid out a frugal meal of dates, ewe’s milk and bread. Emmeline retired behind this shelter attempting with soap and a basin of water to make a hasty toilette before sitting down on the carpet where the meal was served. She heard Deniau tell her husband that they would lodge that evening in the house of a sheikh named Ben-Gannah where they would be served a proper meal. ‘Tomorrow we will travel on a less demanding road. The worst part of the journey is over.’"|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"

"ap < 04:00"|"shortly before four"|"Deniau came down into the courtyard, shortly before four, watching as Lambert rehearsed his and Emmeline’s performance, for the eighth time. When Lambert had finished Deniau applauded, then vaulted on to the stage and kissed Emmeline’s hand, congratulating her. ‘Wonderful! No magician in history has had so beautiful a foil. And now I want to ask one last favour of you, dear Madame. As Bou-Aziz has already arrived, we are planning a dinner for him this evening and we very much hope you will attend.’"|"The Magician's Wife"|"Brian Moore"
