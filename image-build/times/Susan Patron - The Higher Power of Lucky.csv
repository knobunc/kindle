"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"Lucky looked up at the arched wooden ceiling of the kitchen trailer and narrowed her eyes, like someone remembering something from long ago. “While I was at work dynamiting for silver in the mine, Chesterfield went to be with the other burros, but she was always waiting for me at five o’clock on the dot when my shift ended."|"The Higher Power of Lucky"|"Susan Patron"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"Brigitte swung up the steps to the kitchen trailer carrying two plastic sacks full of Government Surplus commodities. “Even though it is only eight o’clock, I do not want to see the temperature in centigrade,” she said. “If I see it only in Fahrenheit I am not so shocked—I do not let myself know what it really means. Miles, do you want to wash your hands?”"|"The Higher Power of Lucky"|"Susan Patron"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"The timing to work on her secret museum-display idea was perfect, because at ten o’clock everyone in Hard Pan went to the post office for their mail. Since there was no market or restaurant or even a gas station in Hard Pan, people liked to stand around getting the latest news in town while they waited for the Captain to distribute the mail into each P.O. box. So Brigitte would be gone for at least half an hour, enough time for Lucky to get a good start on her display."|"The Higher Power of Lucky"|"Susan Patron"
12:00|noon|"Lucky imagined a restaurant where the menu had things like tongue and sweetbreads, which are really some kind of glands, and oysters and snails and rabbits—things she was pretty sure French people sat around eating morning, noon, and night. She doubted there would be any customers for a restaurant like that in Hard Pan."|"The Higher Power of Lucky"|"Susan Patron"
"ap 04:15"|"four fifteen"|"Lucky looked out the rear window. HMS Beagle stood watching the bus, then turned and trotted toward home. She would be waiting when the bus arrived back at four fifteen, as she did every day."|"The Higher Power of Lucky"|"Susan Patron"
"ap 03:15"|"three fifteen"|"Just after lunch, when Lucky thought she could not bear to wait until three fifteen for the school bus to arrive for the ride home, the principal came to Room Four. Lucky sat forward in her seat to stare at Ms. Baum-Izzart, who was eight months pregnant and wore black pants and a tight-fitting flowered shirt that showed exactly the shape of her pregnant stomach. Ms. Baum-Izzart smiled at Ms. McBeam and at the fifth graders. She put her two hands on her shirt, holding the sides of her stomach. Lucky noticed that there were slightly darker marks where Ms. Baum-Izzart put her hands, like the dark stains on the sides of Miles’s pants where he wiped his hands. She figured Ms. Baum-Izzart spent a lot of time feeling the interesting huge round ball of her stomach."|"The Higher Power of Lucky"|"Susan Patron"
