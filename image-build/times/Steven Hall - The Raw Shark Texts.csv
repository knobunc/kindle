16:34|"4.34 p.m."|"I counted to ten then I looked up from the floor. I propped up onto my elbows and when that seemed okay, all the way up onto my knees. I was kneeling at the foot of a double bed in a bedroom. A bedroom stocked with all the ordinary, usual things. There was a wardrobe in the corner. A bedside table with a collection of water glasses of varying ages and an alarm clock with red digital numbers – 4.34 p.m., a chest of drawers cluttered with deodorant cans and lids, a tub of multivitamins and the remains of a blue toilet roll, used right down to where the paper goes wrinkly, like bath fingers. All just normal bedroom things – but I didn’t recognise any of them. None of it felt strange, but none of it was familiar either. It was all just there; unremarkable but alien stuff. The thought came that maybe I’d fallen and concussed myself, except nothing hurt. I felt around my skull to make sure, but no, nothing."|"The Raw Shark Texts"|"Steven Hall"
"ap > 00:00"|"Just after twelve"|"Just after twelve there was a sound in the hallway. I straightened up and stood very still and very quiet. I’d been putting clothes back in the wardrobe when it happened and when I went to investigate I carried two shirts downstairs with me, not really aware of having them in my hands. There was a big A4 envelope sitting on the doormat. My name and address were written across the front in black felt-tip."|"The Raw Shark Texts"|"Steven Hall"
15:30|"3.30 p.m."|"At 3.30 p.m. on the second day of my second life, a big ginger tomcat arrived in the kitchen. He hauled his heavy self in through the open window, stepped across the worktops and planted himself down solid in the middle of the floor. Then he just sat there, staring up at me with round cynical eyes. I stared back, surprised. I thought he might run if I tried to get too close but he didn’t budge at all, he just kept on looking at me as I knelt down to read his collar tag: There was a name – Hello! I’m Ian – and a full address, although the first line told me everything I needed to know."|"The Raw Shark Texts"|"Steven Hall"
20:26|"Twenty…Twenty-six"|"I shuffled out into the hallway all dream-fuddled and struggling through sleep sand but as I reached the hallstand table the ringing stopped. An empty sound-break of after-echoes bounced off the walls around me. I dialled 1471. A noise came down the line like the hiss of a seashell; that close-to-the-ear sound of almost-waves breaking far far away. I pressed down the little black bails on the phone cradle a couple of times and tried again. This time I got the clunky voice of the computerised telephone woman: “You were called at…Twenty…Twenty-six…Hours…The caller withheld their number.”"|"The Raw Shark Texts"|"Steven Hall"
03:00|"3 a.m."|"A couple of days before the bikini top/saluting incident, I’d discovered there’s so little light pollution over our part of the island that, if you’re lying on your back on a clumpy little sand dune at 3 a.m., you can see the blues and purples of the Milky Way all across the sky. I’d never seen the Milky Way before and thought there was something quite 1950s sci-fi about the whole thing. Lost in Space."|"The Raw Shark Texts"|"Steven Hall"
02:00|"Two a.m."|"Two nights after my living room floor disintegrated into a wet, deep concept and I’d swum and recited the Ryan Mitchell Mantra for my life, the shark came back. Two a.m. and me sitting up in bed, cold with panic sweat and covers bunched up in my white knuckled fists. The walls strained and stretched, sending odd shadows and strange associations rippling around the room. But the First Eric Sanderson’s newly unpackaged Dictaphones chattered away to themselves in each corner of the bedroom and the memory shark, the Ludovician, stayed locked out behind the plaster. It couldn’t cross the perimeter. It couldn’t break through the non-divergent conceptual loop. The First Eric Sanderson’s letters ranged from lucid to almost indecipherable, but his tactics worked. They all worked."|"The Raw Shark Texts"|"Steven Hall"
"ap ~ 04:00"|"around four o’clock"|"I finally closed the book of codes and charts around four o’clock the following morning. I’d been decoding and deciphering the Light Bulb text for almost thirteen hours straight, carefully chiselling out each letter from the sediment; verifying, classifying, contextualising, bringing old buried things back up into the world."|"The Raw Shark Texts"|"Steven Hall"
03:00|"3 a.m."|"I think there’s still a small block of original quiet that exists in the world. 3 a.m. to 5 a.m. – a last natural wilderness, time’s shrinking little Antarctica. In the heart of this remote and silent time-place, I finally closed my book of notes and decoding tables. I’d finished. I flipped through the completed text of The Light Bulb Fragment one more time and closed the notebook. I paced around the room for a few minutes without really seeing or looking, all heavy and sleep-staring. There were things in the text I hadn’t been expecting. Uncomfortable, complicating passages."|"The Raw Shark Texts"|"Steven Hall"

"ap > 10:00"|"after ten o’clock"|"My coat was finally dry and warm from half a day over the radiator (the radiators were on constantly at the Willows Hotel, a preference shared by Aunty Ruth and Ian). My room key came with a front door key because reception went unmanned after ten o’clock and this meant I could come and go whenever I chose, which was useful for the kind of early morning surveillance necessary to collect a new supply of post. I already knew where I could get a good view of the town."|"The Raw Shark Texts"|"Steven Hall"
12:30|"12.30 p.m."|"I understand your situation and the dangers you face every day. You are not alone. Please meet me at the old Manor Infirmary at 12.30 p.m. this afternoon. The building is disused and the front doors will be open."|"The Raw Shark Texts"|"Steven Hall"
"ap 11:33"|11.33|"I stretched for my mobile. 11.33. The meeting at the Manor Infirmary was in less than an hour. Shit. So much for finding the place early and checking the lie of the land."|"The Raw Shark Texts"|"Steven Hall"
14:00|"2 p.m."|"“Well, if you change your mind. Actually, I need to take the pills for my eyes at 2 p.m.. I’m always forgetting. You couldn’t do me a favour and remind me, could you?”"|"The Raw Shark Texts"|"Steven Hall"
13:32|13.32|"I took the mobile out of my pocket and glanced at the clock on screen: 13.32."|"The Raw Shark Texts"|"Steven Hall"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"“I can’t take them before two o’clock,” Nobody interrupted gently. “I know you think it doesn’t matter because it’s only a few minutes. But it does. The amounts are perfectly balanced. Like seconds. Sixty seconds perfectly balanced against a minute. And dividing it up. You can’t carry a second over.”"|"The Raw Shark Texts"|"Steven Hall"
05:14|"5.14 a.m."|"5.14 a.m. and the yellow Jeep’s wheels rumbled on dark roads, its back filled with boxes of books, packed-up bags and a sleepy pissed-off Ian in his cat carrier. I’d been waiting for Scout to suggest doing something with Ian – checking him into some cattery or asking Aunty Ruth to take care of him for a few days, but our guide seemed to take the fact that Ian would be coming with us as a given. I was glad about that, I wasn’t about to leave him anywhere and my mind was still too drifty and loaded up with early morning stares to have any sort of argument about it. Instead, we’d just packed up the yellow Jeep, quietly and mechanically, and gone. Scout threw Nobody’s bag of pills and the book he’d sent me into the dumpster at the back of the hotel car park. I put a note and a cheque for more than the cost of my stay on the front desk as we left. It was a small relief to know Ruth and John would understand; Ian and I were shipping out to the front line."|"The Raw Shark Texts"|"Steven Hall"
"~ 18:00"|"Around 6 p.m."|"We stopped to rest every two or three hours. Scout would check our progress in a little red notebook and we’d have water and maybe something to eat, then we’d swap custody of Ian and start out again. Stretches of colourless time passed. Afternoon became evening and we wore thin with the jokes and the games, the journey becoming a mostly silent, thoughtful and leg-aching march. Around 6 p.m. Scout finally called a halt and we dropped bags for the night."|"The Raw Shark Texts"|"Steven Hall"
"< 12:00"|"almost midday"|"I thought about her skin under my fingers, her ribs and her hips. I thought of her wet black hair fallen over her eyes and cheeks and nose and her breath and the sounds she made blowing it, moving it. The thoughts spiked in me, hot needles.
“It’s almost midday,” she said, seeing me shift around.
Under both our sleeping bags, I shuffled up into a sitting position. “Thanks for the lie-in.”"|"The Raw Shark Texts"|"Steven Hall"
03:00|"3 a.m."|"“Yeah,” she smiled a vague smile. “You know, if I ever snuck in late at night I’d have to creep past her room to get to mine and if she heard me, I’d get a note under my door – £5 or Dad finds out where you weren’t at 3 a.m. this morning.”"|"The Raw Shark Texts"|"Steven Hall"
00:21|"12.21 a.m."|"Nobody had been one of Mycroft Ward’s most important operatives and for sixty seconds every day, between 12.21 a.m. and 12.22 a.m., his laptop was permitted to connect directly with the gigantic online database of self that was Mycroft Ward’s mind. During this single minute, Nobody would upload his reports directly into Ward’s vast consciousness. During this single minute, a direct channel opened between Ward’s mind and the outside world. Scout would convert one of Fidorous’s email rerouting programs to hold open the connection between the laptop and Ward once it occurred. Fidorous, Scout hoped, would create some sort of device to channel the Ludovician into the laptop and into Ward. Simple. The only difficult, dangerous part would be getting close to the Ludovician in the first place."|"The Raw Shark Texts"|"Steven Hall"

“Eight o’clock.”

12:00|midday|"I know I probably won’t see any of her family again. It’s just too hot and too sharp and we’ll only cut ourselves on each other if we try to stay in touch.
It’s midday. All Clio’s stuff is gone.
For so long I didn’t touch anything. Timelessness again, the house like a secret temple as dust built up on things that were never meant to have dust on them–Clee’s toothbrush and hairdryer and left-out-of-the-box CDs and deodorant on the bathroom window ledge. Ordinary things carefully kept in place because the last person to touch them would never put a cup down on the edge of the table again, or ever leave a book half-read. The world strained to move on without her and I strained to hold back the tide. My dad came over to see me not too long ago. He’s not too good at talking, my dad, but he did try to tidy up a bit as I made him a coffee. He moved one of Clio’s books and I screamed at him until I almost lost my voice but he still didn’t understand and tried to put the book back where it was, saying there, look, it’s alright, see? You’d never know. In the end he just held onto me as I sobbed and I knew he was crying too, but silently, white stripes down his tough stubbly face."|"The Raw Shark Texts"|"Steven Hall"
