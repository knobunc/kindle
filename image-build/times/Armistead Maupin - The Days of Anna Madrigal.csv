"ap 09:00"|nine|"Both things were true; tonight was Lasko’s night at the Martin, and he got off work at nine. It wasn’t the ideal solution to the problem, but Andy had been left with no other choice. Lasko hadn’t shown up at school for several days, and Andy’s low-key detective work at Eagle Drugs had produced only a cryptic explanation from Mr. Yee: “He got the day off. He’s not feeling so good.”"|"The Days of Anna Madrigal"|"Armistead Maupin"
10:00|"10:00 a.m."|"Brian felt the same way. Was there anything more depressing than a sex joint at 10:00 a.m.—without lights or music or lust itself to transform reality?"|"The Days of Anna Madrigal"|"Armistead Maupin"
"ap 01:00"|"one of the clock"|"They took their inaugural bike ride after breakfast. Michael was buzzed from the Bloody Marys, which helped to loosen him up as he attempted a bicycle for the first time in years. Fortunately, there were not that many other bikes to dodge as they pedaled down one of the clock-numbered streets toward the playa. He had not made a point of noticing street signs. He’d resolved simply to follow Ben and Shawna until he got the hang of things. He was happy to be their duckling."|"The Days of Anna Madrigal"|"Armistead Maupin"
12:00|noonday|"This time, though, it was. The deep playa freed them from the crush of others, and soon the three of them—just the three of them—were racing across a hard platinum plain under the noonday sun, scarves streaming like banners, arms held aloft like Evita, or the queens in Priscilla. The arm thing, of course, was mostly Ben and Shawna’s contribution, though Michael shared their exhilaration. He had never ridden a bike with such sustained abandon. He felt like one of those kids from ET, lifting off into the sky while the orchestra swelled accordingly."|"The Days of Anna Madrigal"|"Armistead Maupin"
00:00|midnight|"Margaret knew lots of things about Andy. She knew things that happened before he was born, back when Mama was teaching piano in Rapid City and Margaret was her friend, working at the five-and-dime. Margaret had always claimed that they were both ready to get out of there, and the opportunity presented itself when Mama got pregnant by a piano pupil whose father was, in Margaret’s words, “a big muckety-muck in the Chamber of Commerce and a hotheaded Greek to boot.” Margaret’s mean-as-a-snake husband had keeled over dead at the cement plant a week earlier, so she paid her debt to the Almighty by helping Mama through her ordeal. “She was our salvation in our flight from the Pharisees” was how Mama had put it, implicating the unborn Andy in this biblical-sounding event, but it would be years before he would learn that their midnight motor trip to Nevada had been paid for with cash Margaret had lifted from the notions counter at the five-and-dime."|"The Days of Anna Madrigal"|"Armistead Maupin"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"He would learn this from Margaret, mind you, not Mama. Mama, when pressed on the matter, had said only that Andy’s father was a “a hero of the Great War who succumbed to his wounds”—an explanation that, even at nine, Andy had found unconvincing, since he knew the radio show she was referencing. They had listened to it together, in fact, him and Mama, down in the parlor on a slow night. A doughboy and a crippled Irish girl finding true love in New York City, if only briefly."|"The Days of Anna Madrigal"|"Armistead Maupin"
"ap 04:00"|four|"Andy’s first memory was not of the house, or even the huge neon moon Mama had erected by the highway, but the cool, vaulting interior of the Catholic church on Melarkey Street. At four, Andy was a little old for a christening (and Mama wasn’t even Catholic), but St. Paul’s had just been completed, and it was the grandest place in town, a Spanish-style edifice with towers like a castle. Mama wanted folks to see that her son was being raised a proper gentleman. To that end, Margaret had made him a christening outfit with Irish lace she ordered from Denver. Technically, it was a dress, since she had simply enlarged a McCall’s pattern meant for babes-in-arms, but Andy had not complained. He had worn it all day, in fact, chasing a billy goat around the yard. He could still remember how fine it felt against his skin, and the flinty look in Mama’s eyes when he refused to take it off."|"The Days of Anna Madrigal"|"Armistead Maupin"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"By nine o’clock the yard was full of cars, so Andy stayed in his room, reading under a lampshade printed with a map of the world. Down below he could hear the usual music from the Victrola, the usual howls from the customers and counterfeit squeals from the girls. Not an awful sound, really, just an awfully familiar one, and the wrong accompaniment to Richard Halliburton’s Book of Marvels. He wondered if Mama truly wanted to go on like this forever, selling good-for-all-night tokens unto death, or if she ever dreamed of being somewhere else entirely. That would be fine with him, unless her escape plan involved the acquisition of a wealthy daughter-in-law, in which case leaving would be just as grimly unimaginable as staying."|"The Days of Anna Madrigal"|"Armistead Maupin"

Thousands, maybe, if he counted glory holes and Lands End and back rooms and the woods along Wohler Creek and Dick Dock in P-town and the Warm Sands resorts of Palm Springs and, okay fine, the men’s room at Penn Station one sultry midnight in the late 1970s. It had been as easy as falling off a log. Or falling onto one, as the case may be. So what was so different now?"|"The Days of Anna Madrigal"|"Armistead Maupin"

"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"By five o’clock Andy was hitchhiking home on Jungo Road. A breeze had rolled down from the mountains, warm and velvety. Andy felt buoyed by nature and a wondrously unthinkable thought: I have a date tomorrow. He may not know it, and he may not even know my name, but I have a date for the first time in my life."|"The Days of Anna Madrigal"|"Armistead Maupin"
