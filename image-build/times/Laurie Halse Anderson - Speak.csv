08:50|"8:50 in the morning"|"My first class is biology. I can’t find it and get my first demerit for wandering the hall. It is 8:50 in the morning. Only 699 days and 7 class periods until graduation."|Speak|"Laurie Halse Anderson"
"ap 03:10"|3:10|"I order my dinner at 3:10 and eat it on the white couch. I don’t know which parent was having seizures when they bought that couch. The trick to eating on it is to turn the messy side of the cushions up. The couch has two personalities: “Melinda inhaling pepperoni and mushroom” and “No one ever eats in the family room, no ma’am.” I chow and watch TV until I hear Dad’s Jeep in the driveway. Flip, flip, flip—cushions reversed to show their pretty white cheeks, then bolt upstairs. By the time Dad unlocks the door, everything looks the way he wants to see it, and I have vanished."|Speak|"Laurie Halse Anderson"
00:00|midnight|"Last year, our clan all dressed up as witches. We went to Ivy’s house because she and her older sister had theatrical makeup. We traded clothes and splurged on cheap black wigs. Rachel and I looked the best. We had used baby-sitting money to rent black satin capes lined in red. We rocked. It was an unusually warm, wicked evening. We didn’t need long underwear and the sky was clear. The wind kicked up, skimming clouds over the surface of the full moon, which was hung just to make us feel powerful and strong. We raced through the night, a clan of untouchable witches. I actually thought for a moment that we could cast spells, could turn people into frogs or rabbits, to punish the evil and reward the good. We ended up with pounds of candy. After Ivy’s parents went to bed, we lit a candle in the totally dark house. We held it in front of an antique mirror at midnight to see our futures. I couldn’t see anything."|Speak|"Laurie Halse Anderson"
"ap 03:15"|3:15|"If I were tied to railroad tracks and the 3:15 train to Rochester was ready to cut a path across my middle, would I (a) scream for help? (b) ask my little mice friends to chew through the ropes? (c) remember that my favorite jeans were in the dryer and were hopelessly wrinkled? (d) close my eyes and pretend nothing was wrong?"|Speak|"Laurie Halse Anderson"
"ap 03:15"|315|"The Neck is back in control. Show time is over. I try to draw a branch coming out of a tree trunk for the 315th time. It looks so flat, a cheap, cruddy drawing. I have no idea how to make it come alive. I am so focused I don’t notice at first that David Petrakis My Lab Partner has stood up. The class stops talking. I put my pencil down."|Speak|"Laurie Halse Anderson"
22:00|"10 p.m."|"I go to bed the night before Thanksgiving at 10 p.m. She’s pounding on her laptop at the dining-room table. When I come downstairs Thanksgiving morning, she’s still there. I don’t think she slept."|Speak|"Laurie Halse Anderson"
12:00|noon|"We sleep in till noon on Christmas. I give Mom a black sweater and Dad a CD with sixties hits. They give me a handful of gift certificates, a TV for my room, ice skates, and a sketch pad with charcoal pencils. They say they have noticed me drawing."|Speak|"Laurie Halse Anderson"
"~ 02:00"|"around 2 a.m."|"I wipe my eyes. They wait with unsure smiles. The snowball grows larger. When I snuck home that night, they weren’t in the house. Both cars were gone. I was supposed to have been at Rachel’s all night long—they weren’t expecting me, that’s for sure. I showered until the hot water was gone, then I crawled in bed and did not sleep. Mom pulled in around 2 a.m., Dad just before sunup. They had not been together. What had they been doing? I thought I knew. How can I talk to them about that night? How can I start?"|Speak|"Laurie Halse Anderson"
"ap 02:48"|2:48|"I spend the rest of the day waiting for it to be 2:48, so it’s not all that different from school. I figure I learned a good lesson, and set my alarm clock early for the next day. I wake up on time for four days in a row, get on the bus four days in a row, ride home after school. I want to scream. I think I’ll need to take a day off every once in a while."|Speak|"Laurie Halse Anderson"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"We had eight inches of snow last night. In any other part of the country, that would mean a snow day. Not in Syracuse. We never get snow days. It snows an inch in South Carolina, everything shuts down and they get on the six o’clock news. In our district, they plow early and often and put chains on the bus tires."|Speak|"Laurie Halse Anderson"
"ap 08:45"|8:45|"For a minute there, I think that I’ve tripped into the land of the truly insane, but then a crowd roars. It is a basketball game, last game of the season. I check my watch—8:45. I’ve been asleep for hours. I grab my backpack and fly down the hall."|Speak|"Laurie Halse Anderson"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"Heather: “Actually, we can’t start until three o’clock Saturday afternoon because of some stupid meeting of Chrysler salesmen. But I know we can do it. I’m asking other kids, too. Do you know anyone who could help?”"|Speak|"Laurie Halse Anderson"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"When I get home, it’s time for lunch. I make two egg-salad sandwiches and drink an enormous glass of milk. I eat an apple and put my dishes in the dishwasher. It’s only one o’clock. I suppose I should clean the kitchen and vacuum, but the windows are open and robins sing on the front lawn, where a pile of mulch with my name on it is waiting."|Speak|"Laurie Halse Anderson"
"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"I lie down on the couch to watch TV, but my eyes close and I’m out. When I wake up, it’s past midnight, and someone has covered me with an afghan. The house is quiet, dark. Cool breeze slides in between the curtains."|Speak|"Laurie Halse Anderson"
