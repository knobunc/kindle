  breakthrough was that it could be refined. For, instead of trapping the circle between a small and a large square, he then trapped the circle between a small and a large hexagon. If you have ten

"ap 01:29"|"1 hour 29 minutes"|"Another way to express admiration for e is to memorize its digits. In 2004, Andreas Lietzow from Germany memorized and then recited 316 digits while juggling five balls. However,
  Lietzow was spectacularly trumped on November 25, 2007, when Bhaskar Karmakar from India, unencumbered by balls, set a new world record by reciting 5,002 digits of e in 1 hour 29 minutes
  and 52 seconds. That same day he also accurately recited 5,002 digits of e backward. These are incredible feats of memory, but we can all memorize ten digits of e by learning this
  mnemonic: “I’m forming a mnemonic to remember a function in analysis.” The numbers of letters in each word represent the digits of e."|"The Simpsons and Their Mathematical Secrets"|"Simon Singh"
