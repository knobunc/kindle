19:22|"nineteen twenty-two"|"In the early hours of an August morning in nineteen twenty-two, the Turkish Nationalist Army under the command of Mustafa Kemal Pasha attacked the centre of the Greek army at Dumlu Punar on the plateau two hundred miles west of Smyrna. By the following morning, the Greek army had broken and was in a headlong retreat towards Smyrna and the sea. In the days that followed, the retreat became a rout. Unable to destroy the Turkish army, the Greeks turned with frantic savagery to the business of destroying the Turkish population in the path of their flight. From Alashehr to Smyrna they burnt and slaughtered. Not a village was left standing. Amid the smouldering ruins the pursuing Turks found the bodies of the villagers. Assisted by the few half-crazed Anatolian peasants who had survived, they took their revenge on the Greeks they were able to overtake. To the bodies of the Turkish women and children were added the mutilated carcases of Greek stragglers. But the main Greek army had escaped by sea. Their lust for infidel blood still unsatisfied, the Turks swept on. On the ninth of September, they occupied Smyrna."|"The Mask of Dimitrios"|"Eric Ambler"

His papers had already been examined by the Greek and Bulgarian officials in the corridor outside and Latimer did not have an opportunity of ascertaining the nationality of the citizen of the world. A Bulgarian customs official put his head in the compartment, frowned at their suitcases and then withdrew. Soon the train moved on over the frontier. Dozing fitfully, Latimer saw the thin strip of sky between the blinds turn blue-black and then grey. The train was due in Sofia at seven. When, at last, he rose to dress and collect his belongings, he saw Mr. Peters had switched off his reading lamp and had his eyes closed. As the train began to rattle over the network of points outside Sofia, he gently slid the compartment door open."|"The Mask of Dimitrios"|"Eric Ambler"

The preceding two hours they had spent in Madame Preveza’s private office, a beflowered room filled with furniture: a walnut grand piano draped in a white silk shawl with a fringe and pen-painted birds in the corner of it, small tables loaded with bric-a-brac, many chairs, a browning palm tree in a bamboo stand, a chaise-longue and a large roll-top desk in Spanish oak. They had reached it, under her guidance, via the curtained door, a flight of stairs and a dimly lit corridor with numbered doors on either side of it and a smell that reminded Latimer of an expensive nursing home during visiting hours."|"The Mask of Dimitrios"|"Eric Ambler"

But for their presence and the fact that in the morning light his room looked like a rag-picker’s workshop, he might have dismissed his recollections of the visitation as being no more than part of the bad dreams which had troubled his sleep.

It is curious how everyone will suddenly begin to go to one particular place in the quarter for no other reason than that everyone else is going there. There are other ways of filling one’s place, of course. The tourist guides will bring people to you but the guides have to be paid and the profit is reduced. Another way is to let your place be one where special sorts of people may meet. But it takes time to be known for one’s type of clientele and the police are not always friendly even though one does not break the law. It is best and cheapest to have luck. And Giraud and I had luck in due course. Naturally the tango was chic because of Valentino, and our South Americans soon learned to play well so that people came to dance. When more people came we had to put out more tables so that the floor was smaller; but it did not make any difference. People still came to dance.

Latimer had seen a draft of the letter and had found it gratifyingly similar in tone to a letter he himself had written for a blackmailer in one of his books. It began, with sinister cordiality, by trusting that, after all these years, Monsieur C.K. had not forgotten the writer and the pleasant and profitable times they had spent together, went on to say how pleasing it was to hear that he was so successful and hoped sincerely that he would be able to meet the writer who would be at the So-and-So Hotel at nine o’clock on the Thursday evening of that week. The writer concluded with an expression of his ‘plus sincere amitie’ and a significant little postscript to the effect that he had chanced to meet someone who had known their mutual friend Visser quite well, that this person was most anxious to meet Monsieur C.K. and that it would be so unfortunate if Monsieur C.K. could not arrange to meet the appointment on Thursday evening."|"The Mask of Dimitrios"|"Eric Ambler"

There would be a hired car waiting for him there with two men in it. The two men would have been recruited for the purpose by Mr, Peters. Their business would be to pick up the messenger and drive along the Quai National in the direction of Suresnes until they were quite sure that they were not being followed and then to make for a point on the Avenue de la Reine near the Porte de St. Cloud where ‘Mr. Petersen’ and ‘Mr. Smith’ would be waiting to receive the money.

The afternoon he spent alone at the Vincennes Zoo. The subsequent dinner was tedious. Little was said about their plans, and Latimer concluded that the invitation had been another of Mr. Peters’ precautions. He was making sure that his collaborator, who now had no financial interest in the business, had not changed his mind about collaborating. Latimer spent two hours listening to Mr. Peters’ discovery of the works of Dr. Frank Crane and a defence of his contention that Lame and Lovely and Just Human were the most important contributions to literature since Robert Elsmere. On the pretext of having a headache, Latimer escaped soon after ten o’clock and went to bed. When he woke the following morning he actually had a headache and concluded that the carafe burgundy which his host had recommended so warmly at dinner had been even cheaper than it had tasted. As his mind crept slowly back to consciousness he had, too, a feeling that something unpleasant had happened. Then he remembered. Of course! Dimitrios had by now received the first letter."|"The Mask of Dimitrios"|"Eric Ambler"

It was as if someone had dealt him a light blow there. He concluded that it was Mr. Peters’ corrosive burgundy fighting a rearguard action and stopped in one of the cafes on the Champs Elysees for an infusion. But the feeling persisted, and he found himself becoming more and more conscious of it. Then, as his gaze rested for a moment on a party of four men and women talking excitedly and laughing over some joke, he realised what was the matter with him. He did not want to meet Mr. Peters. He did not want to go on this blackmailing expedition. He did not want to face a man in whose mind the uppermost thought would be to kill him as quickly and quietly as possible. The trouble was not in his stomach. He had cold feet."|"The Mask of Dimitrios"|"Eric Ambler"
"ap 07:45"|"quarter to eight"|"Yet the visit to the police Paste had eased his conscience considerably. He did not feel quite as irresponsible as he had felt before. He had made an effort to bring the police into the affair. It had been an abortive effort; but short of collecting his passport from the other side of Paris and starting all over again (and that, he decided uncomfortably, was out of the question) there was nothing more he could do. He was due to meet Mr. Peters at a quarter to eight in a cafe in the Boulevard Hausmann. But by the time he had finished a very light dinner the curious feeling had returned to his solar plexus and the two brandies which he had with his coffee were intended to do more than pass the time. It was a pity, he reflected as he went to keep his appointment, that he could not accept even a small share of the million francs. The cost of satisfying his curiosity was proving, in terms of frayed nerves and an uneasy conscience, practically prohibitive."|"The Mask of Dimitrios"|"Eric Ambler"
