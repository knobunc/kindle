"ap 01:00"|one|"Merger under the threat of external force is well illustrated by the for- mation of the 
        Cherokee Indian confederation in the U.S. Southeast. The Cherokees were originally divided 
        into 30 or 40 independent chiefdoms, each consisting of a village of about 400 people. 
        Increasing white settle- ment led to conflicts between Cherokees and whites. When 
        individual Cherokees robbed or assaulted white settlers and traders, the whites were 
        unable to discriminate among the different Cherokee chiefdoms and retali- ated 
        indiscriminately against any Cherokees, either by military action or by cutting off trade. 
        In response, the Cherokee chiefdoms gradually found themselves compelled to join into a 
        single confederacy in the course of the 18th century. Initially, the larger chiefdoms in 
        1730 chose an overall leader, a chief named Moytoy, who was succeeded in 1741 by his son. 
        The first task of these leaders was to punish individual Cherokees who attacked whites, 
        and to deal with the white government. Around 1758 the Chero- kees regularized their 
        decision making with an annual council modeled on previous village councils and meeting at 
        one village (Echota), which thereby became a de facto “capital.” Eventually, the Cherokees 
        became literate (as we saw in Chapter 12) and adopted a written constitution."|"Guns, Germs and Steel"|"Jared Diamond"

        Australia one summer, we decided to visit a site with well- preserved Aboriginal rock 
        paintings in the desert near the town of Menindee. While I knew of the Australian desert's reputation for dryness and summer heat, I 
        had already spent long periods working under hot, dry conditions in the Californian desert 
        and New Guinea savanna, so I consid- ered myself experienced enough to deal with the minor 
        challenges we would face as tourists in Australia. Carrying plenty of drinking water, 
        Marie and I set off at noon on a hike of a few miles to the paintings."|"Guns, Germs and Steel"|"Jared Diamond"

        full of Indians, halting periodically to wait for more Indians who kept filing out of the 
        camp behind them. They kept filling out in separate detachments into the afternoon. The 
        front detachments were now close to our camp, and still more troops kept issuing from the camp of the 
        Indians. In front of Atahuallpa went 2,000 Indians who swept the road ahead of him, and 
        these were followed by the warriors, half of whom were marching in the fields on one side 
        of him and half on the other side."|"Guns, Germs and Steel"|"Jared Diamond"
