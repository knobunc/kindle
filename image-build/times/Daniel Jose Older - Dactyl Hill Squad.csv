12:00|noon|"So Magdalys mostly had to be content with watching the great beasts cavort along outside her window: The lamplighter’s iguanodons would pass first thing in the morning, extinguishing the lanterns as the day broke. Then the commuter brachys would stomp past, passengers cluttered on the saddles and hanging from straps along the side. By noon the streets would fill with stegosaurs lugging supplies and the duckbill riders in fancy dress clothes, heading off to important meetings, while microraptors scurried across the roads, carrying messages or making nuisances of themselves. Most of the trikes and raptors had been sent down south to fight the Confederates, but every once in a while she’d see one of those too. Magdalys could watch them out her window all day, but it wasn’t the same as being out there with the dinos."|"Dactyl Hill Squad"|"Daniel Jose Older"

"> 12:00"|"JUST past noon"|"IT WAS JUST past noon by the time Magdalys, Mapper, and Miss Josephine made it back to the Bochinche. They stumbled in, exhausted and filthy from their long journey and near escape from the flames, the two satchels full of documents clutched tightly in their arms."|"Dactyl Hill Squad"|"Daniel Jose Older"
"ap > 05:00"|"past five o’clock"|"IT WAS WELL past five o’clock when David, Cymbeline, and Louis Napoleon walked through the door of the back room arm in arm like they’d been friends their whole lives. David stopped mid-laughter when he saw Magdalys, Mapper, Two Step, and Amaya gathered around the stack of papers on the big wooden table. (Sabeen had long since curled up and passed out in the corner.)"|"Dactyl Hill Squad"|"Daniel Jose Older"
00:00|midnight|"THEY LOADED THE weapons stash onto the raptor (who Redd informed them was named Reba) and made their way quietly through the midnight streets of Dactyl Hill, glancing around for slinking shadows or dinoriders at each turn."|"Dactyl Hill Squad"|"Daniel Jose Older"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"Mapper pulled out the floor plans he’d drawn and unrolled them. “Two at each gun turret, four at the front gate, two walking the walls, so at least eight on a normal night.”"|"Dactyl Hill Squad"|"Daniel Jose Older"
