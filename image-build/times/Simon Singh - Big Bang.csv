15:37|15:37|"Pythagoras of Samos helped to reinforce the foundations of this new rationalist movement from around 540 BC. As part of his philosophy, he developed a passion for mathematics and demonstrated how numbers and equations could be used to help formulate scientific theories. One of his first breakthroughs was to explain the harmony of music via the harmony of numbers. The most important instrument in early Hellenic music was the tetrachord, or four-stringed lyre, but Pythagoras developed his theory by experimenting with the single-stringed monochord. The string was kept under a fixed tension, but the length of the string could be altered. Plucking a particular length of string generated a particular note, and Pythagoras realised that halving the length of the same string created a note that was one octave higher and in harmony with the note from the plucking of the original string. In fact, changing the string’s length by any simple fraction or ratio would create a note harmonious with the first (e.g. a ratio of 3:2, now called a musical fifth), but changing the length by an awkward ratio (e.g. 15:37) would lead to a discord."|"Big Bang"|"Simon Singh"
12:00|noon|"While at the library, Eratosthenes learned of a well with remarkable properties, situated near the town of Syene in southern Egypt, near modern-day Aswan. At noon on 21 June each year, the day of the summer solstice, the Sun shone directly into the well and illuminated it all the way to the bottom. Eratosthenes realised that on that particular day the Sun must be directly overhead, something that never happened in Alexandria, which was several hundred kilometres north of Syene. Today we know that Syene lies close to the Tropic of Cancer, the most northerly latitude from which the Sun can appear overhead."|"Big Bang"|"Simon Singh"
12:00|noon|"Aware that the Earth’s curvature was the reason why the Sun could not be overhead at both Syene and Alexandria simultaneously, Eratosthenes wondered if he could exploit this to measure the circumference of the Earth. He would not necessarily have thought about the problem in the same way we would, as his interpretation of geometry and his notation would have been different, but here is a modern explanation of his approach. Figure 1 shows how parallel rays of light from the Sun hit the Earth at noon on 21 June. At exactly the same moment that sunlight was plunging straight down the well at Syene, Eratosthenes stuck a stick vertically in the ground at Alexandria and measured the angle between the Sun’s rays and the stick. Crucially, this angle is equivalent to the angle between two radial lines drawn from Alexandria and Syene to the centre of the Earth. He measured the angle to be 7.2°."|"Big Bang"|"Simon Singh"
12:00|noon|"Figure 1 Eratosthenes used the shadow cast by a stick at Alexandria to calculate the circumference of the Earth. He conducted the experiment at the summer solstice, when the Earth was at its maximum tilt and when towns lying along the Tropic of Cancer were closest to the Sun. This meant that the Sun was directly overhead at noon at those towns. For reasons of clarity, the distances in this and other diagrams are not drawn to scale. Similarly, angles may be exaggerated."|"Big Bang"|"Simon Singh"
12:00|noon|"Whether he was accurate to 2% or 15% is irrelevant. The important point is that Eratosthenes had worked out how to reckon the size of the Earth scientifically. Any inaccuracy was merely the result of poor angular measurement, an error in the Syene—Alexandria distance, the timing of noon on the solstice, and the fact that Alexandria was not quite due north of Syene. Before Eratosthenes, nobody knew if the circumference was 4,000 km or 4,000,000,000 km, so nailing it down to roughly 40,000 km was a huge achievement. It proved that all that was required to measure the planet was a man with a stick and a brain. In other words, couple an intellect with some experimental apparatus and almost anything seems achievable."|"Big Bang"|"Simon Singh"
18:00|"6 p.m."|"The most fastidious calculation was by James Ussher, who became the Archbishop of Armagh in 1624. He employed an agent in the Middle East to seek out the oldest known Biblical texts, to make his estimate less susceptible to errors in transcription and translation. He also put an enormous effort into anchoring the Old Testament chronology to an event in recorded history. In the end, he spotted that Nebuchadnezzar’s death was indirectly mentioned in the Second Book of Kings, so it could be dated in terms of Biblical history; the death and its date also appeared in a list of the Babylonian kings compiled by the astronomer Ptolemy, so it could be linked to the modern historical record. Consequently, after much tallying and historical research, Ussher was able to pronounce that the date of creation was Saturday 22 October, 4004 BC. To be even more precise, Ussher announced that time began at 6 p.m. on that day, based on a passage from the Book of Genesis which proclaimed: ‘And the evening and the morning were the first day.’"|"Big Bang"|"Simon Singh"

"ap 01:08"|1.08|"Figure 34 shows the principle of Bessel’s measurement. When he observed 61 Cygni from the Earth at position A, he did so along a particular line of sight. Six months later, when he observed the star from the Earth at position B, he noticed that his line of sight had shifted slightly. The right-angled triangle formed by the Sun, 61 Cygni and the Earth allowed him to use trigonometry to estimate the distance to the star, because he already knew the Earth-Sun distance and now he knew the angle in one corner of the triangle. Bessel’s measurements implied that the distance to 61 Cygni was 1014 km (100 trillion km). We now know that his measurement was approximately 10% too short, because modern estimates put the distance to 61 Cygni at 1.08 × 1014km, or 720,000 times as far as the distance to the Sun. As explained in the caption to Figure 34, this is equivalent to 11.4 light years."|"Big Bang"|"Simon Singh"

On the night of 1 November, Hale had the honour of being the first person to stare into the eyepiece—and was shocked to see Jupiter overlapped by six ghost planets. Blame for the optical defect was immediately laid on the bubbles in the glass, but calmer minds came up with an alternative theory. Workmen had left the roof of the observatory open that day while they completed installation, so sunlight had been warming the mirror, which had possibly become distorted as a result. The astronomers adjourned until 3 a.m., by which time they hoped that a cooling-off period would have solved the problem. In the chill of the night, Hale’s next view of the heavens was clearer than any previous observation in history The Hooker Telescope was capable of revealing nebulae that previously had been too faint to show up in any other telescope; it was so sensitive that it could have detected a candle at a distance of 15,000 km."|"Big Bang"|"Simon Singh"

19:23|1923|"To compound their problems, Alpher, Herman and Gamow suffered from an image problem. They were often looked down upon as two young upstarts led by a joker. Gamow was infamous for his limericks and his sometimes offbeat application of physics. On one occasion, he argued that God lived 9.5 light years from the Earth. This estimate relied on the fact that in 1904, at the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War, churches across Russia had offered prayers requesting the destruction of Japan, but it was not until 1923 that Japan was struck by the Kanto earthquake. Presumably prayers and God’s wrath were limited by the speed of light, and the time delay indicated the distance to the Lord’s abode. Gamow also became famous for Mr Tompkins in Wonderland, a book in which he described a world where the speed of light was just a few kilometres per hour, so that a bicycle ride would reveal the weird effects of relativity, such as time dilation and length contraction. Unfortunately, some rivals viewed this approach to popularisation as childish and trivial. Alpher summarised their predicament: ‘Because he wrote on physics and cosmology at a popular level and because he injected a considerable amount of humour into his presentations, he was frequently not taken seriously by too many of his fellow scientists. His not being taken seriously is something that rubbed off on the two of us as his colleagues, particularly because we were working in such a speculative area as cosmology.’"|"Big Bang"|"Simon Singh"
"ap 07:20"|"twenty past seven"|"Hoyle showed his talent for observation and deduction at an early age. When he was just four years old, he worked out for himself how to tell the time through a process of detailed analysis. Fred noticed that when one of his parents asked the time, the other would look at the grandfather clock before answering. So Fred began to ask the time over and over again to find out what was going on. One evening he was sent to bed having been told that it was ‘twenty past seven’, and in the moments before falling asleep he solved the mystery:"|"Big Bang"|"Simon Singh"
"ap 07:20"|"twenty past seven"|"An idea suddenly occurred to me. Could it be that the ‘time’, instead of being a mysterious number unknown to me called ‘twenty past seven’, was really two separate numbers, twenty and seven?…There were two hands on the clock. Perhaps one number belonged to one hand and the other number belonged to the other hand. A few more repetitions of the question ‘What’s the time?’ the following day showed that this was indeed so. Because the numbers on the clock face were big and clear, it was easy now to see there were two sets of them. One hand went with one set and the other hand went with the other set. Refinements remained, like the meaning of ‘past’ and ‘to’, but, to all intents and purposes, the problem was solved and I could turn to other puzzling things, like what made the wind blow."|"Big Bang"|"Simon Singh"

He would sit there and say, ‘Now come on, do this, do that,’ and Bondi would calculate with furious speeds, though what he was calculating was not always clear to him—as on the occasion he asked Fred, ‘Now at this point do I multiply or divide by 1046?’"|"Big Bang"|"Simon Singh"

The BBC kept files on prospective contributors, and Hoyle’s file was marked with the words ‘Do not use this man’, probably because he was considered to be a troublemaker who continually kicked against the establishment. Nevertheless, producer and fellow Cambridge academic Peter Laslett disregarded the warning label and invited Hoyle to broadcast a series of five lectures on the Third Programme radio network. The series was aired at eight o’clock on Saturday evenings, and transcripts were published in the Listener magazine. The entire project was a huge success, turning Hoyle into a celebrity."|"Big Bang"|"Simon Singh"
23:56|"23 hours and 56 minutes"|"Jansky mentioned the curious time interval to his colleague Melvin Skellet, who had a Ph.D. in astronomy and who was able to point out the significance of the missing four minutes. Each year the Earth spins on its axis 365/4 times, and each day lasts 24 hours, so one year consists of 365/4 × 24 = 8,766 hours. However, as well as spinning on its own axis 365/4 times, the Earth effectively makes one extra spin each year by going once around the Sun. Therefore, the Earth actually makes 366/4 rotations in 8,766 hours (one year), so each rotation takes 23 hours and 56 minutes, which is known as the sidereal day. The significance of the sidereal day is that it is the duration of our rotation with respect to the entire universe, as opposed to our provincial 24-hour day."|"Big Bang"|"Simon Singh"
