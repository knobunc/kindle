Geography, without “consideration of the celestial bodies,” measures the world in terms of its land forms and political divisions, and describes the inhabitants and their cities “and other things worthy of memory.” Cosmography, in contrast, “according to the order of the heavenly bodies and their division showeth the situation of countries … by the measures of degrees and minutes, and with mathematical rules teacheth the order of the climates, the difference of the day and night, the quarters from whence the winds do blow, the divers risings of the stars, the elevations of the poles, the parallels, and noon tides …” (Agrippa 1974: 85)."|"Doctor Faustus"|"Christopher Marlowe"

And taking his way to a thick wood near to Wittenberg, called in the German tongue Spisser Waldt […], he came into the same wood towards evening to a cross way, where he made with a wand a circle in the dust, and within that many more circles and characters: and thus he passed away the time, until it was nine or ten of the clock in the night, then began Doctor Faustus to call for Mephostophiles the spirit, and to charge him in the name of Beelzebub to appear there personally without any long stay: then presently the devil began so great a rumor in the wood, as if heaven and earth would have come together with wind, the trees bowing their tops to the ground; then fell the devil to bleat as if the whole wood had been full of lions, and suddenly about the circle ran the devil as if a thousand wagons had been running together on paved stones. After this at the four corners of the wood it thundered horribly, with such lightnings as if the whole world, to his seeming, had been on fire. Faustus all this while half amazed at the devil’s so long tarrying, and doubting whether he were best to abide any more such horrible conjurings, thought to leave his circle and depart; whereupon the devil made him music of all sorts, as if the nymphs themselves had been in place: whereat Faustus was revived and stood stoutly in his circle aspecting his purpose, and began again to conjure the spirit Mephostophiles in the name of the prince of devils to appear in his likeness: whereat suddenly over his head hanged hovering in the air a mighty dragon: then calls Faustus again after his devilish manner, at which there was a monstrous cry in the wood, as if hell had been open, and all the tormented souls crying to God for mercy; presently not three fathom above his head fell a flame in manner of a lightning, and changed itself into a globe: yet Faustus feared it not, but did persuade himself that the devil should give him his request before he would leave […]. Faustus, vexed at the spirit’s so long tarrying, used his charms with full purpose not to depart before he had his intent, and crying on Mephostophiles the spirit, suddenly the globe opened and sprang up in height of a man: so burning a time, in the end it converted to the shape of a fiery man. This pleasant beast ran about the circle a great while, and appeared in manner of a grey friar, asking Faustus what was his request. Faustus commanded that the next morning at twelve of the clock he should appear to him at his house, but the devil would in no wise grant.
