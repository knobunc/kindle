Why, now that I come to think of it, I’m not even sure whether any cars have wire screens over the headlamps; the radiators, yes, but the headlamps? Still, that’s easily enough verified. But even supposing my whole train of argument has by some miracle hit the truth, I am almost as far away from him as ever. There are probably thousands of garage proprietors who own sports cars. The accident occurred about six twenty in the evening. Assuming it took him a maximum of three hours to refit with new parts and get rid of the old ones, he would still have had ten hours of darkness to play about with, which means that his garage may be anywhere within a three-hundred-mile radius. A bit less, perhaps. He wouldn’t be likely to stop anywhere for petrol, with the mark of the beast on his car. But think of all the garages within even a hundred-mile radius. Am I going round to each of these, asking the proprietor if he owns a sports car? And what if he says, yes? The prospect is as sickening as the endless reaches of eternity. My hatred for this man must have swept my common sense right off its feet."|"The Beast Must Die"|"Nicholas Blake"

It was so childishly simple, too – both my opportunity and his escape. Shall I ever get such an opportunity again?

It gave me a hell of a turn, as you can imagine. He had been taken ill after dinner. Lena described the symptoms; it sounded to me exactly like strychnine. I went straight over to the Ratterys’ house; the doctor was still there and he confirmed it. I was properly caught. There was my diary, in the hands of his solicitors, to be opened in the event of his death. It was going to tell the police that I had set out to murder George, and there was George murdered; an open-and-shut case for them.’"|"The Beast Must Die"|"Nicholas Blake"

He, Mrs Rattery, Lena Lawson, old Mrs Rattery, his mother, and his son Philip – a wee boy – had dinner together. They all ate the same food. The deceased and his mother took whisky with their food, the rest water. None of the others suffered any ill effects. They left the dinner table about quarter-past eight, the women and the wee boy first, the deceased following them in a minute’s time. They all repaired to the drawing room with the exception of Master Philip. George Rattery was seized with severe pains between ten and fifteen minutes later. The women folk, poor souls, were helpless. They gave him a mustard emetic, but that only aggravated the seizure; the symptoms, of course, are very horrifying. Their own medical man, whom they rang up first, was out to a road accident, and by the time they had got hold of another, it was too late. Dr Clarkson arrived a little before ten – he’d been out on a maternity case – and applied the usual chloroform treatment, but Rattery was too far gone then. He died five or ten minutes later. I’ll not bother you with the details. I’ve assured myself, however, that the poison could not have been introduced through any of the food or drink taken at dinner. The symptoms of strychnine poisoning, moreover, rarely take longer than an hour to supervene. The company sat down to dinner at quarter-past seven, therefore Rattery could not likely have taken the poison before dinner. There remains the interval of one minute between the time the others left the dining room and the time Rattery rejoined them in the drawing room.’"|"The Beast Must Die"|"Nicholas Blake"

If its inhabitants, gossiping at the mouths of its picturesque, historical and squalid alleys, were aware that the prosperous businessman who trotted past them was in reality New Scotland Yard’s most formidable Chief Inspector, they concealed their curiosity with remarkable ease. Even when Nigel Strangeways began to sign, mezzo forte, the ‘Ballad of Chevy Chase’, it caused no sensation – except in the bosom of Inspector Blount, who quickened his step and began to wear a rather hunted look. Severnbridge, unlike Inspector Blount, was quite inured to discordant voices raised in song along its main thoroughfare, though not usually at so early an hour.

The grandfather clock in the hall outside gave a long, bronchial wheeze, gasped, announced that the time was midnight. Nigel took up the folder in which was fastened a carbon copy of Felix Cairnes’ diary. Something caught his eye on the page at which it fell open. His body stiffened, his tired brain became suddenly alert. He began to flick the pages, looking for another reference. An extraordinary idea began to build up in his head – a pattern so logical, so neat, so convincing, that he had to distrust it. It was too like one of those marvellous poems one composes on the edge of sleep and looks at again in the disillusioned light of morning and finds commonplace, meaningless or mad. Nigel decided to leave it till the morning; he was not in a state now to test its truth; he shrank from its harsh implications. Yawning, he got up, put the folder under his arm and made for the door of the writing room."|"The Beast Must Die"|"Nicholas Blake"

As the car took him there, he reviewed the disappearance of Phil, pieced together from the almost incoherent words of Lena and Felix Cairnes. In the confusion from last night’s attack on Nigel, no one had noticed that Phil had not been in the hotel for breakfast. Felix assumed he had already had breakfast before he himself came down; Georgia had been too busy attending to Nigel; the hotel waiter thought the boy must have gone to his mother’s house for breakfast. So it was not till the housemaid entered Phil’s bedroom at 10 a.m., and found the bed had not been slept in, that anyone realised he was gone. She had also found, on the chest of drawers, an envelope addressed to Inspector Blount.

Just as he gets to the bottom of the stairs, he hears the door of the writing room open. He knows there is someone between him and the front door by which he’d intended to leave the hotel. He knows, too, that whoever it is has just come out of the writing room will likely switch on the hall lights, and then he’ll be discovered. As he cowers close to the wall, his hand touches that putter which has been left leaning against it. He’s desperate and terrified – the poor laddie – in a trap. He takes up the putter and swings it blindly in the darkness, hitting out towards this invisible person who stands between him and escape. He hits you and you fall. Phil is horrified by what he’s done. He’s afraid to turn on the lights, afraid of the body that lies between him and the front door. He remembers the French windows in the dining room, and slinks out that way instead. It was his fingerprints on the French windows, we compared them with the prints he’d left in his bedroom.’"|"The Beast Must Die"|"Nicholas Blake"
