"< 00:00"|"toward midnight"|"But somewhere one GTX computer has been tickling another, and toward midnight something does happen. First comes an attendant who pulls screens around her. Then a man in a business doublet comes daintily down the ward. He motions the attendant to strip off the sheet and go."|"The Girl Who Was Plugged In"|"James Tiptree Jr_"
00:00|midnight|". . . Sleep which merges into feedings and washings and more sleeps, into drowsy moments of afternoon where midnight should be, and gentle businesslike voices and friendly (but very few) faces, and endless painless hyposprays and peculiar numbnesses. And later comes the steadying rhythm of days and nights, and a quickening which P. Burke doesn't identify as health, but only knows that the fungus place in her armpit is gone. And then she's up and following those few new faces with growing trust, first tottering, then walking strongly, all better now, clumping down the short hall to the tests, tests, tests, and the other things."|"The Girl Who Was Plugged In"|"James Tiptree Jr_"

Every noon beside the yacht's hydrofoils darling Delphi clips along in the blue sea they've warned her not to drink. And every night around the shoulder of the world an ill-shaped thing in a dark burrow beats its way across a sterile pool."|"The Girl Who Was Plugged In"|"James Tiptree Jr_"
"< 00:00"|"near midnight"|"And then near midnight Delphi says roughly, ""Ag-ag-ag—"" and slips onto the floor, making a rough noise like a seal."|"The Girl Who Was Plugged In"|"James Tiptree Jr_"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"Paul screams. There's more of the ag-ag business and more gruesome convulsive disintegrations, until by two in the morning Delphi is nothing but a warm little bundle of vegetative functions hitched to some expensive hardware—the same that sustained her before her Life began. Joe has finally persuaded Paul to let him at the waldo-cabinet. Paul stays by her long enough to see her face change in a dreadfully alien and coldly convincing way, and then he stumbles out bleakly through the group in Tesla's office."|"The Girl Who Was Plugged In"|"James Tiptree Jr_"
