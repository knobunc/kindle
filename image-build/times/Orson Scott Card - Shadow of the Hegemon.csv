It took yet another hour to shoo everyone out of the house, and by then all Petra wanted was to curl up in bed and hide from the world for at least a week."|"Shadow of the Hegemon"|"Orson Scott Card"
"ap 04:00"|0400|"They rousted Ender’s jeesh out of bed at 0400 and assembled them in the dining room. No one explained anything, and they were forbidden to talk. So they waited for five minutes, ten, twenty. Petra knew that the others were bound to be thinking the same things she was thinking: The Russians had caught on that they were sabotaging their own battle plans. Or maybe somebody had noticed the coded message in the dragon picture. Whatever it was, it wasn’t going to be nice."|"Shadow of the Hegemon"|"Orson Scott Card"
12:00|noon|"It was noon when the smell of oranges woke him. Sister Carlotta was peeling a mexerica orange. “People are eating these things on the street and spitting the pulp on the sidewalk. You can’t chew it up enough to swallow it. But the juice is the best orange you’ll ever taste in your life.”"|"Shadow of the Hegemon"|"Orson Scott Card"
12:00|noon|"“Tell you what,” Peter said. “Mom and Dad, you’ve got stuff to do tomorrow, but my first class isn’t till noon. Why don’t I go with these two wherever they’re spending the night and talk through the possibility of maybe taking a field trip with them.”"|"Shadow of the Hegemon"|"Orson Scott Card"

After all these months of never seeing the Chakri’s face, he was surprised that the meeting was granted—and without delay. He sent his request when he got up at five in the morning. At seven, he was in the Chakri’s office, with Suriyawong beside him."|"Shadow of the Hegemon"|"Orson Scott Card"

09:00|"nine in the morning"|"Both of them said the same thing. The message had arrived at nine in the morning, Thailand time. They were supposed to wait twelve hours in case Sister Carlotta herself contacted them to retract the message. But when they learned with independent confirmation that there was no chance she was alive, they decided not to wait. Whatever the message was, Sister Carlotta had set it up so that if she didn’t take an active step to block it, every day, it would automatically go to Graff and to Peter to send on to him."|"Shadow of the Hegemon"|"Orson Scott Card"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"When Suriyawong came to see if Bean wanted any dinner—a nine o’clock repast for the officers on duty, not an official meal with the P.M.—Bean almost followed him right down. He needed to eat, and now was as good a time as any. But he realized that he had not read any of his email after getting Sister Carlotta’s last letter, so he told Suriyawong to start without him but save him a place."|"Shadow of the Hegemon"|"Orson Scott Card"
