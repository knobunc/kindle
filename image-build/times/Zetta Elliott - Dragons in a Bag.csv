"ap 11:20"|11:20|"The clock on the wall reads 11:20, but I don’t tell my grandmother that. I just sit down and open my own bottle of root beer. I take a small sip and watch the box on the counter. I think I see it move a fraction of an inch, but maybe my eyes are playing a trick on me. Maybe my grandmother just moved the box so I wouldn’t get any peanut butter on it. Or maybe she doesn’t want me to know what’s inside."|"Dragons in a Bag"|"Zetta Elliott"
