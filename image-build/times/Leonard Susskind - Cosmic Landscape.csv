"ap 01:08"|1.08|"Then it hit me! There are three basic units describing length, mass, and time: the meter, kilogram, and second. There are also three fundamental constants. If I change the units, say, to centimeters, grams, and hours, the numerical value of all three constants will change. For example, the speed of light will get worse. It will become 1.08 × 10 centimeters per hour. But if I use years for time and light-years for distance, then the speed of light will be exactly one since light travels one light-year per year. Doesn’t that mean that I can invent some new units and make the three fundamental constants anything I want? I can even find units in which all three fundamental constants of physics are equal to one! That will simplify so many formulas. I’ll call the new units natural units since they’re based on the constants of nature. Maybe if I’m lucky, people will start calling them Planck units."|"Cosmic Landscape"|"Leonard Susskind"
"ap 01:00"|one|"Let’s make a chart to show all the possible values of the cosmological constant. Take a sheet of paper and draw a horizontal axis. Halfway along the line mark a point and call it zero. At the right mark a point and call it one. The value one stands for the benchmark value of the vacuum energy—one Unit. Now start marking all the points that correspond to the vacuum energies of the 10 valleys. With a very sharp pencil you may be able to make one thousand random dots before they begin to run into one another and make a continuous line."|"Cosmic Landscape"|"Leonard Susskind"
"ap 01:00"|one|"The decaying neutron is a good illustration to start with. With a bit of simplification, we can suppose there are only two possible outcomes when we observe the neutron: either it has decayed or it hasn’t. The list of possibilities is a short one, and the wave function has only two entries. We start with the neutron in its undecayed form so that the wave function has value one for the first possibility and zero for the second. In other words initially the probability that the neutron is undecayed is one, while the probability that it has decayed (when we start) is zero. But after a short time, there is a small probability that the neutron has disappeared. The two entries to the wave function have changed from one and zero to something a bit less than one and something a bit more than zero. After about ten minutes the two entries have become equal. Go on for another ten minutes, and the probabilities will be reversed: the probability that the neutron is still intact will be close to zero, and the probability that it has become a proton/ electron/ antineutrino will be up near one. Quantum mechanics contains a set of rules for updating the wave function of a system as time unfolds. In its most general form, the system of interest is everything—the entire observable universe, including the observer doing the observations. Since there may be more than one lump of matter that might be called an observer, the theory must give rise to consistent observations. The wave function contains all of this and in a way that will prove consistent when two observers get together to discuss their findings."|"Cosmic Landscape"|"Leonard Susskind"
12:00|noon|"Let’s examine the best known of all thought experiments in physics: the famous (or should I say infamous?) Schrödinger’s cat experiment. Imagine that at noon a cat is placed in a sealed box along with a neutron and a gun. When the neutron decays (randomly), the ejected electron activates a circuit that causes the gun to shoot and kill the cat."|"Cosmic Landscape"|"Leonard Susskind"
12:00|noon|"A practitioner of quantum mechanics—call him S—would analyze the experiment by constructing a wave function: a list of the probabilities for the various outcomes. S cannot reasonably take the entire universe into account, so he limits the system to include only those things in the box. At noon only one entry would exist: “The cat is alive in the box with the loaded gun and the neutron.” Then S will do some mathematics analogous to solving Newton’s equations in order to find out what will happen next—say, at 12:10 p.m. But the result is not a prediction of whether the cat will be dead or alive. It is an updating of the wave function, which will now have two entries: “The neutron is intact/ the gun is loaded/ the cat is alive” and “The neutron has decayed/ the gun is empty/ the cat is dead.” The wave function has split into two branches—the dead and alive branches—whose numerical values give the square roots of the probabilities for the two outcomes."|"Cosmic Landscape"|"Leonard Susskind"
