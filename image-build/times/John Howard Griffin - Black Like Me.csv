00:00|midnight|"How did one start? The night lay out there waiting. A thousand questions presented themselves. The strangeness of my situation struck me anew - I was a man born old at midnight into a new life. How does such a man act? Where does he go to find food, water, a bed?"|"Black Like Me"|"John Howard Griffin"
00:00|midnight|"The phone rang and I felt my nerves convulse. I answered and told the caller my host was out for the evening. Again the strangeness, the secret awareness that the person on the other end did not know he talked with a Negro. Downstairs, I heard the soft chiming of the old clock. I knew it was midnight though I did not count. It was time to go."|"Black Like Me"|"John Howard Griffin"

12:00|noon|"Here sensuality was escape, proof of manhood for people who could prove it no other way. Here at noon, jazz blared from jukeboxes and dark holes issued forth the cool odors of beer, wine and flesh into the sunlight. Here hips drew the eye and flirted with the eye and caused the eye to lust or laugh. It was better to look at hips than at the ghetto. Here I saw a young man, who carried in his body the substance of the saint, stagger, glass-eyed, unconscious from the dark hole, sit down on the curb and vomit between his feet."|"Black Like Me"|"John Howard Griffin"

Sterling suggested I go to the Negro YMCA on Dryades, some distance across town. “You better drink some water before you go,” he said. “You might not find any before you get to Dryades.” I up-ended the bucket and saw brass-colored circles at the bottom through the clear water."|"Black Like Me"|"John Howard Griffin"

As I turned the corner, I noticed two large white boys sprawled on the front steps of a house across the wide boulevard. One of them, a heavyset, muscular fellow in khaki pants and a white sweatshirt, whistled at me. I ignored him and continued walking. From the corner of my eye, I saw him get slowly to his feet and angle across under the streetlight to my side of the street."|"Black Like Me"|"John Howard Griffin"

"ap 07:50"|"seven fifty"|"In the rest room, I saw the remains of a loaf of French bread lying on the floor beside the waste bin. It told the story of some poor devil who had come there, closed himself in the cubicle and eaten his meal of a half a loaf. The small room was perfectly clean except for a placard attached to the back of the door. I read the neatly typed NOTICE! until I saw that it was only another list of prices a white man would pay for various types of sensuality with various ages of Negro girls. The whites frequently walk into colored rest rooms, Scotch-tape these notices to the wall. This man offered his services free to any Negro woman over twenty, offered to pay, on an ascending scale, from two dollars for a nineteen-year-old girl up to seven fifty for a fourteen-year-old and more for the perversion dates. He gave a contact point for later in the evening and urged any Negro man who wanted to earn five dollars for himself to find him a date within this price category. He would probably have success, I thought, glancing at the butt of bread. To a man who had nothing to eat but bread and perhaps a piece of cheese in a public rest room, five dollars could mean a great deal. I wondered about the Negro who had left this trace of his passing. What sort of man was he? A derelict? No, a derelict would have left an empty wine bottle. Someone who could not find work and had grown too hungry to wait for something better? Probably. If the woman in the Catholic Book Store had not cashed my traveler’s check, I might have been reduced to the same thing. What astonished me was that he had not carried the remains of the bread with him. Perhaps he, too, had seen the notice on the door and counted on five dollars for a decent supper."|"Black Like Me"|"John Howard Griffin"
00:00|midnight|"This shift was nerve-racking. As a white man I could not be seen leaving a Negro home at midnight. If I checked into a white hotel and then got too much sun, it would, in combination with the medication still in my system, turn me too dark and I would not be able to return to the hotel."|"Black Like Me"|"John Howard Griffin"
"< 00:00"|"near midnight"|"I took out my cleansing cream and rubbed it on my hands and face to remove the stain. I then removed my shirt and undershirt, rubbed my skin almost raw with the undershirt, and looked into my hand mirror. I could pass for white again. I repacked my duffel, put my shirt and coat back on and wondered how I could best leave the colored rest room without attracting attention. I guessed it was near midnight, but the traffic in and out remained heavy."|"Black Like Me"|"John Howard Griffin"
00:00|midnight|"The shift back to white status was always confusing. I had to guard against the easy, semi-obscene language that Negroes use among themselves, for coming from a white man it is insulting. It was midnight. I asked a doorman where to find a room for the night. He indicated a neon sign that stood out against the night sky - YMCA, only a block or so away. I realized that though I was well dressed for a Negro, my appearance looked shabby for a white man. He judged me by that and indicated a place where lodging was inexpensive."|"Black Like Me"|"John Howard Griffin"

I then had a visit from a young college instructor of English - a born Southerner of great breadth of understanding. He told me that his more liberated views of the Negro were in such contradiction to those of his elders, his parents and uncles, that he no longer went home to visit them. We talked until midnight.

We feared that he would be victimized by character assassins, perhaps even entrapped into this kind of “woman rap.” I went to Chicago to brief him on the precautions he must take now that he stood as a symbol for civil rights, warning him that he must not be alone with any woman, that he must always be able to account for his time so that no one could say he was at such and such a place at such and such a time. He and his host priests were quite dumfounded. When I saw that they were not really going to believe that men would go to such lengths to vilify Father Coffield, I called Dick Gregory, who happened to be at his home in Chicago. I told him my situation and said I felt Father Coffield would believe him if he would come over and add his warnings to mine. He came to the rectory and we sat up and talked with the priests until six in the morning. He, of course, knew about Father Coffield. He had heard the same rumors I had heard - that Father might be subjected to character assassination. Dick Gregory had already telephoned Chicago’s city officials and told them that if there was any attempt on the part of any racist group to smear Father Coffield, Chicago’s black citizens would block every freeway leading into the city and tie up Chicago until Father’s name was cleared."|"Black Like Me"|"John Howard Griffin"
18:00|"6 P.M."|"During the Miami Republican convention of 1968, because the media had black reporters who could get into the black area even in crisis times, this whole nation saw the making of a riot unfold before them on TV screens. They saw the unwarranted police raids on black political caucuses because these caucuses refused to allow white reporters. They saw a curfew that was ordered in the afternoon when most black people were at work or did not have their radios on. They saw that curfew really being made known for the first time to most black people that evening when law enforcement men rolled into the black areas, unleashed a cloud of tear gas and only then announced on their portable speakers that a 6 P.M. curfew had been ordered and all people should return to their homes and stay inside. After that series of provocations, the city exploded into a riot. The country saw it, got a good and expert report on it. The commentators even mentioned the fact that it was very hot and the people were cooling themselves outdoors, since there was little or no air-conditioning in the dwellings of that part of the city. And yet, within hours, one of the state’s top officials blandly announced that they were looking for the communists and black outside agitators who had caused it. Presumably they never found them. Black people who had witnessed this all over the country could only despair at the gullibility of white people who, seeing all this, swallowed the old line that it was caused by communists and black agitators."|"Black Like Me"|"John Howard Griffin"
