How could they have possibly known that if they had only been able to climb some thousands of feet outward and upward, the blackness would be transmuted magically into gold and orange and purple, their dripping bastions of black lava sculpted into delicate cliffs and pinnacles of sunburned sandstone, endlessly repeating themselves in marvelous chaos, to produce one of the most incredible sights on the surface of the earth?"|"The Men Who United the States"|"Simon Winchester"

The official party, barrels and boxes and bottles in hand, boarded steamboats that were suited—as canal narrowboats were not—to the roll of the open ocean. And that rolling duly began, as most on board promptly noticed uneasily, just as the craft headed out past Governors Island and through the Narrows—over which the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge arches today—and into the wide expanse of Lower Bay."|"The Men Who United the States"|"Simon Winchester"

He said he was going next to the small town of Ilion, where the Remington Company had once had a plant that made rifles and until 2007 still owned a museum that showed its complete range of typewriters, the more constructive side of its business."|"The Men Who United the States"|"Simon Winchester"

I got to Winnemucca at dusk, Reno at ten. Though it was cold and starting to rain lightly, slicking the roadway, problems seemed unlikely: the Nevada Highway Patrol’s radio station was reporting that the Donner Pass was dry and clear."|"The Men Who United the States"|"Simon Winchester"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"There would soon be many other lines built across the country and scores of others constructed to run north and, to a lesser extent, south. Fifty years after the ceremony in Utah, there were 250,000 miles of track that seemingly connected every town and hamlet with almost every other. The smallest of places invariably had a train. There is a famous depot in Winesburg, Ohio. In the classic Western comedy Ruggles of Red Gap, Charles Laughton, playing Ruggles the butler, leaves his bags with a kindly stationmaster in Red Gap, Oregon. And when I wandered the country to all the towns called Paradise, my old Official Guide showed me, deep in the Union Pacific timetables, train No. 545, which would bring farmers’ wives who had been shopping in Salina back home to Paradise, Kansas, each evening at six o’clock, in time to make their husbands’ dinner. Ninety-six percent of Americans, when they went anywhere in the late nineteenth century, went by train."|"The Men Who United the States"|"Simon Winchester"

After five unsuccessful attempts this truck was finally rescued by the combined efforts of the Militor and the Tractor, the cargo having first been removed. All trucks, except the FWDs and some of the Class A trucks had to be pulled thru this 200 yd stretch of quicksand. The Militor handled 16 trucks, the Tractor 10, and in 8 instances the combined efforts of both the Militor and Tractor were required. Delay 7 hours 20 minutes. Five small bridges were damaged during the day. Between Paxton and Roscoe 2 smaller sand holes were encountered, one on an up-grade, only the FWDs and Militor going through unassisted.

He had already forbidden any aircraft to take off from any airport anywhere under his vast national jurisdiction. He had already closed the Atlantic and Pacific approaches to the United States, and planes were already turning around high over the oceans, returning to where they started, or diverting to some safe haven nearby."|"The Men Who United the States"|"Simon Winchester"
"ap 09:45"|9:45|"But now at 9:45, Ben Sliney instructed that word of a strange and seldom heard procedure—SCATANA—be broadcast to every one of almost five thousand commercial aircraft that were in the air. “This is not a drill!” was then broadcast immediately afterward, many times, for emphasis. The announcement was a formal, legally and militarily enforceable order for which all aircraft officers were in theory well prepared. It was an order made under the terms of the regulation for which it was the acronym—the plan for the Security Control of Air Traffic and Air Navigation Aids—and it required all aircraft then in flight to land immediately at the airport closest to where they happened to be."|"The Men Who United the States"|"Simon Winchester"

And as one could then see from the monitor screens showing the aircraft images bleeding away, second by second, the icons of their presence seeming to evaporate like spray on a hot plate, it was effective, in double-quick time. By 11:20, an hour and thirty-five minutes later, every plane was safely down, somewhere, on North American ground. Airport aprons were crowded. Passengers bound for Oregon fetched up in Oklahoma; others, wanting to reach New York, found themselves in the cornfields of Nebraska. Most famously of all, thousands were marooned in Gander in Newfoundland and were made more welcome and at their heart’s ease than they could have ever imagined. Millions were inconvenienced."|"The Men Who United the States"|"Simon Winchester"

That ploy, together with his adroit plan to stage contests and offer as prizes small galena crystals—which were known to be tunable to specific radio frequencies and so could be used to make the new “crystal set” receivers—led his listenership to mount steadily, until soon several hundred were tuning in. Most of his listeners were on the Peninsula; but on some atmospherically favored listeners as far away as Oregon and New Mexico were able to hear the music, interspersed with Sybil’s sweet made-for-radio voice, swooping and soaring above the crackle of static."|"The Men Who United the States"|"Simon Winchester"

NBC had at the time the technical capacity to hook up stations for coast-to-coast live broadcasts, but if everyone back east was asleep, there was clearly no reason to. What the network did not have, however, was the ability to send the show down the line and have stations record it for broadcast the following day. Hence the visit to the airport; hence the concern that the tapes were treated royally, being worth millions in potential East Coast revenue."|"The Men Who United the States"|"Simon Winchester"

It is surely evident now that the Internet, the great new technological missionary of the age, is obliged to a future lying well beyond America. Its creators have as their unstated vision the uniting of the whole world. The unum that is America’s proudest accomplishment today will in time become part of an even greater pluribus, which one day will be similarly forged by electronics into one great planetary unity."|"The Men Who United the States"|"Simon Winchester"
