"ap ~ 01:00"|"around 100"|"Quite dangerous. As we'll see, physics tells us that when it hits the ground the bullet will have the same velocity it had when it left the muzzle of the pistol, which can be 700 to 800 miles per hour (1,100 to 1,300 kilometers per hour). But that ignores air resistance. More realistically, the bullet's landing speed can be around 100 to 150 miles per hour (160 to 240 kilometers per hour). That's fast enough to penetrate human skin, and even if it doesn't penetrate it can still do a lot of damage. But just try to tell that to the idiots who like to shoot their guns “harmlessly” into the air."|"What Einstein Told His Barber"|"Robert L. Wolke"
"ap 00:00"|"twelve o'clock"|"Let's say that one of the wagon wheel's spokes is painted red. And let's say that when the camera snaps picture number one, the red spoke is pointing straight up, at the twelve o'clock position. Depending on the speed of rotation of the wheel, when picture number two is snapped a twenty-fourth of a second later, the red spoke might happen to be caught in the one o'clock position—even if it had made a couple of complete turns in the interim. That makes it look as if it had moved to the right, or clockwise. Or, it might happen to be caught in the eleven o'clock position, making it look as if it had moved to the left, or counterclockwise. As the camera continues to take its 24 pictures per second, the red spoke—together with the rest of the wheel—will look as if it is moving continuously, either clockwise or counterclockwise."|"What Einstein Told His Barber"|"Robert L.

"ap 01:00"|"one o'clock"|"In reality, of course, the wheels don't have one red spoke; they all look alike. Any spoke is a double for any other. Therefore, any spoke at all might be in the one o'clock or eleven o'clock position when the camera's shutter clicks, and it will still look as if the wheel is turning right or left."|"What Einstein Told His Barber"|"Robert L.

"ap 04:00"|400|"The next time you have the privilege of witnessing a bang-up thunderstorm, count the number of seconds between a lightning flash and the beginning of the associated thunderclap. Divide that number of seconds by 4 to find out roughly how many miles away the lightning was. Or multiply the number of seconds by 400 to get the approximate distance in yards. (But see the Nitpicker's Corner.) You may be shocked—sorry, I mean surprised—to find how close many of the lightning strikes are. And while you're at it, notice that the closer the lightning is, the higher-pitched “crack” you hear. Read on."|"What Einstein Told His Barber"|"Robert L. Wolke"
