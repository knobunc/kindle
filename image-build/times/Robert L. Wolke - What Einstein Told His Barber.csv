"ap 00:00"|"twelve o'clock"|"Let's say that one of the wagon wheel's spokes is painted red. And let's say that when the camera snaps picture number one, the red spoke is pointing straight up, at the twelve o'clock position. Depending on the speed of rotation of the wheel, when picture number two is snapped a twenty-fourth of a second later, the red spoke might happen to be caught in the one o'clock position—even if it had made a couple of complete turns in the interim. That makes it look as if it had moved to the right, or clockwise. Or, it might happen to be caught in the eleven o'clock position, making it look as if it had moved to the left, or counterclockwise. As the camera continues to take its 24 pictures per second, the red spoke—together with the rest of the wheel—will look as if it is moving continuously, either clockwise or counterclockwise."|"What Einstein Told His Barber"|"Robert L.

"ap 01:00"|"one o'clock"|"In reality, of course, the wheels don't have one red spoke; they all look alike. Any spoke is a double for any other. Therefore, any spoke at all might be in the one o'clock or eleven o'clock position when the camera's shutter clicks, and it will still look as if the wheel is turning right or left."|"What Einstein Told His Barber"|"Robert L.
