02:30|Matins|"By a mount in the morning merrily he was riding

into a forest that was deep and fearsomely wild,

with high hills at each hand, and hoar woods beneath

of huge aged oaks by the hundred together;

the hazel and the hawthorn were huddled and tangled

with rough ragged moss around them trailing,

with many birds bleakly on the bare twigs sitting

that piteously piped there for pain of the cold.

The good man on Gringolet goes now beneath them

through many marshes and mires, a man all alone,

troubled lest a truant at that time he should prove

from the service of the sweet Lord, who on that selfsame night

of a maid became man our mourning to conquer.

And therefore sighing he said: ‘I beseech thee, O Lord,

and Mary, who is the mildest mother most dear,

for some harbour where with honour I might hear the Mass

and thy Matins tomorrow. This meekly I ask,

and thereto promptly I pray with Pater and Ave"|"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_Pearl_Sir Orfeo"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"

O Lord?’ said the gentle knight.

‘Here the Devil might say, I ween,

his matins about midnight!’"|"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_Pearl_Sir Orfeo"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"
"~ 00:00"|"about midnight"|"‘Can this be the Chapel Green,

O Lord?’ said the gentle knight.

"~ 16:30"|evensong|"In that place at time of evensong,

One hour before the set of sun,

He saw there idle labourers strong

And thus his earnest words did run:

‘Why stand ye idle all day long?’

They said they chance of hire had none.

‘Go to my vineyard, yeomen young,

And work and do what may be done!’

The hour grew late and sank the sun,

Dusk came o'er the world apace;

He called them to claim the wage they had won,

For time of day had passed that place."|"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_Pearl_Sir Orfeo"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"
12:00|noon|"Neither sun nor moon ever shone so sweet

As the pouring flood from that court that flowed;

Swiftly it swept through every street,

And no filth nor soil nor slime it showed.

No church was there the sight to greet,

Nor chapel nor temple there ever abode:

The Almighty was their minster meet;

Refreshment the Victim Lamb bestowed.

The gates ever open to every road

Were never yet shut from noon to noon;

There enters none to find abode

Who bears any spot beneath the moon."|"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_Pearl_Sir Orfeo"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"
12:00|noon|"and every field is filled with flowers,

on every branch the blossom blows,

in glory and in gladness grows,

the lady Heurodis, the queen,

two maidens fair to garden green

with her she took at drowsy tide

of noon to stroll by orchard-side,

to see the flowers there spread and spring

and hear the birds on branches sing."|"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_Pearl_Sir Orfeo"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"
12:00|midday|"beneath a fair young grafted tree;

and soon it chanced the gentle queen

fell there asleep upon the green.

Her maidens durst her not awake,

but let her lie, her rest to take;

and so she slept, till midday soon

was passed, and come was afternoon.

Then suddenly they heard her wake,

and cry, and grievous clamour make;

she writhed with limb, her hands she wrung,"|"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_Pearl_Sir Orfeo"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"
12:00|noontide|"‘Nay, nay, sir, words avail thee naught.

I will tell thee how this woe was wrought:

as I lay in the quiet noontide

and slept beneath our orchard-side,

there came two noble knights to me

arrayed in armour gallantly.

“We come”, they said, “thee swift to bring

to meeting with our lord and king.”

Then answered I both bold and true"|"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_Pearl_Sir Orfeo"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"
12:00|noon|"not of red gold nor silver white,

but of one single gem 'twas hewn

that shone as bright as sun at noon.

And coming, straightway he me sought,

and would I or no, he up me caught,

and made me by him swiftly ride

upon a palfrey at his side;

and to his palace thus me brought,

a dwelling fair and wondrous wrought.

He castles showed me there and towers,"|"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_Pearl_Sir Orfeo"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"
12:00|noon|"but none could find him help or plan.

On the morrow, when the noon drew near,

in arms did Orfeo appear,

and full ten hundred knights with him,

all stoutly armed, all stern and grim;

and with their queen now went that band

beneath the grafted tree to stand.

A serried rank on every side

they made, and vowed there to abide,

and die there sooner for her sake"|"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_Pearl_Sir Orfeo"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"
12:00|noon|"There often by him would he see,

when noon was hot on leaf and tree,

the king of Faerie with his rout

came hunting in the woods about

with blowing far and crying dim,

and barking hounds that were with him;

yet never a beast they took nor slew,

and where they went he never knew.

At other times he would descry"|"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_Pearl_Sir Orfeo"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"
12:00|noon|"for when it came to dusk of night

from precious stones there issued soon

a light as bright as sun at noon.

No man may tell nor think in thought

how rich the works that there were wrought;

indeed it seemed he gazed with eyes

on the proud court of Paradise."|"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_Pearl_Sir Orfeo"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"
12:00|noon-tide|"and mad were some, and some were dead;

and passing many there lay beside

as though they slept at quiet noon-tide.

Thus in the world was each one caught

and thither by fairy magic brought.

There too he saw his own sweet wife,

Queen Heurodis, his joy and life,

asleep beneath a grafted tree:

by her attire he knew 'twas she."|"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_Pearl_Sir Orfeo"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"
12:00|noon|"Next day, when hour of noon was near,

he bade his wife await him here;

the beggar's rags he on him flung,"|"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_Pearl_Sir Orfeo"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"
