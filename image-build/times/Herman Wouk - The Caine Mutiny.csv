She listened a moment to echoes of the music that still rang in her mind, then sat up as she realized that she was hearing real music-Cherubino’s love song, floating across the hallway from Willie’s room. She got out of bed and put on a blue silk kimono. “Willie dear-records at this hour?”"|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"

“What, during study hour? Twelve demerits!” Keggs said.
“Come here, fella.” Keefer pointed out through the window. The spring lay in a rain gutter at the edge of a steeply slanting copper-covered roof projection beneath the window. The tenth floor was set slightly back from the rest of the building."|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
12:00|noon|"Willie Keith became the oracle of the tenth floor in matters of naval ordnance. Actually he was a blockhead on the subject. Reputations are made queerly and swiftly in wartime. It happened that in the first week a terrible examination was scheduled in Ordnance, with the announced purpose of causing weaklings to go down. Everybody crammed feverishly, of course. Willie was as earnest as the rest, but one page of the book, composed in the worst Navy jargon, baffled him; a description of a thing called a Frictionless Bearing. Keefer and Keggs had given it up. Willie read the page over seventeen times, then twice more aloud, and was on the point of quitting when he noticed that whole sentences had become embedded in his memory. He worked another half hour and memorized the entire page, word for word. The chief essay question on the examination, as luck would have it, was Explain the Frictionless Bearing. Willie happily disgorged the words, which meant no more to him than a Hindu chant. When the results of the test were announced he stood first in the school. “Apprentice Seaman Keith,” shouted Ensign Acres, squinting in the sunlight at noon assembly, “is officially commended for a brilliant Ordnance paper. He was the only man in the school to give an intelligent explanation of the Frictionless Bearing.”"|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"

They had been imprisoned incommunicado for three weeks. Willie telephoned May Wynn joyously and told her to meet him outside the school at one minute past twelve next day. She was there in a taxi; and she looked so beautiful stretching her arms eagerly to him that Willie momentarily pictured a wedding and all its consequences as he hugged her. He was still kissing her when he regretfully decided against it, for all the old reasons. They went to Luigi’s, and Willie was so stimulated by the beauty of his girl and the first taste of wine in three weeks that he ate a couple of pizzas.

Just before the ten o’clock floor show Roland Keefer came rolling through the smoke and din. His hair was disheveled, his paper collar wilted, his eyes bloodshot.

At three minutes to twelve, he started a desperate harangue to recover lost ground. On the sidewalk outside, midshipmen were running, walking, and staggering toward the entrance. Several were kissing girls in nooks of the building. The tenor of Willie’s plea was that he and May ought to live for the hour, and gather rosebuds while they might, and drink for once dead they never would return, and youth was a stuff that would not endure, and so forth. It took him the whole three minutes to round out this message. The couples outside finished their business. The stream of midshipmen disappeared. But Willie, with demerits beginning to pile up, was compelled in courtesy to wait for May’s answer. He hoped it would be favorable and short."|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"

How perfect a setting the evening was for May’s sweet voice, and the Mozart aria! She had recorded it for him in a Broadway shop one eight when they were both giddy with champagne. Willie smiled as he thought of the delicious April evenings with May during his ten days’ leave. He reached for the telephone, then pulled back his hand, realizing that it was near midnight in the Bronx, when all candy stores were shut and dark. Besides, he reminded himself, he was giving May up, because he couldn’t marry her, and she was too good a girl to be kept dangling. His plan had been to enjoy an ecstatic farewell, then depart and never write or answer letters, allowing the relationship to die peacefully of malnutrition. May hadn’t been informed of the plan. He had fulfilled the first part, now he must remember the second."|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"

For a couple of hours he tossed and thrashed in an eerie doze full of nightmares, wakened every few minutes by a burst of clattering from the workmen. Harding passed into a dead stupor. At midnight the workmen quit, but the sudden quiet and gloom brought no relief; it merely made Willie more conscious of the heat, and of the stinking miasma of the stack gas.

His cap was pushed back to allow the breeze to fan his pale bald brow. He was leaning against the gangway desk, happily eating an apple, when blue sleeves with two and a half gold stripes rose along the ladder railings, followed by the face and form of Lieutenant Commander Queeg. Harding was not alarmed. Officers of such rank often came aboard; usually they were engineering specialists coming to the rescue of some vital machinery on the decaying Caine.

It was not likely-but it was possible, whereas it was not possible, for example, that his mother might do it. The OOD, Keefer, added to his exaltation by putting him in charge of the zigzag plan, allowing him to give the orders to the helm.

"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"San Francisco was his boyhood home, and he had been full of nostalgia for it from the moment the Caine had steamed under the Golden Gate Bridge. But finding himself on Market Street again, he didn’t know what to do with himself. He killed time in aimless dull wandering until one o’clock."|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"After a while the novelist captured two of the prettiest girls, and they went to dinner in a candlelit French restaurant overlooking the bay.

00:00|midnight|"But Ensign Keith had a worm’s-eye view of the war remarkably different from that of the post-war historians. Standing in the black cold wheelhouse of the Caine at midnight on New Year’s Eve, as the ship plowed its old snout through the murky sea toward the west, he took a very gloomy view of the world situation."|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
12:00|noon|"On this day Willie took a mighty leap upward in life. He stood the noon-to-four watch as officer of the deck. Keefer was present to correct any disastrous mistake, and Captain Queeg himself perched in his chair throughout the watch, alternately dozing or blinking placidly in the sunshine. Willie conducted a faultless watch. It was a simple matter of staying on station in the screen while the convoy zigzagged. Whatever his inner shakiness, he kept a bold front, and maneuvered the ship firmly. When the watch was over he penciled in the log:"|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
00:00|midnight|"Willie Keith was a full-fledged officer of the deck now, and he took for granted all the mechanical aids that eased his task. He did not consider the work easy. He was enormously and continually impressed with his quick-won mastery of the sea, and with his military authority. He prowled the wheelhouse, lips compressed, chin high, forehead puckered in a squinting scowl, shoulders hunched forward, hands clenching the binoculars through which he frequently frowned at the horizon. Histrionics apart, he was a competent OOD. He quickly developed the impalpable nervous feelers, reaching from stem to stern of the ship, which are the main equipment of a conning officer. In five months on the bridge he had picked up the tricks of station keeping, the jargon of communications and reports, and the ceremonial pattern of the ship’s life. He knew when to order the boatswain’s mate to pipe sweepers, when to darken ship, when to call away cooks and bakers in the early morning, when to rouse the captain and when to allow him to sleep. He could gain or lose a few hundred yards by slight changes of rudder or engines, and could calculate course and speed to a new screening station in ten seconds by drawing a single pencil line on a maneuvering diagram. The dense blackness of a rain squall at midnight did not scare him; not while the radar scope picked out the task force for him in a neat pattern of green dots."|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
23:52|eight-to-midnight|"The evening before the fleet was due to arrive at Kwajalein, Willie had the eight-to-midnight watch. He observed an increased tension among the sailors on the bridge. Silence, even in the captain’s absence, hung heavily in the wheelhouse. The perpetual discussion of sex in the black radar shack, among ghostly faces lit by the dim green glow of the scopes, had not ceased; but it was sluggish, and dwelt mainly on venereal disease. The signal gang crouched on the flagbags over cups of rancid coffee, muttering."|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
"ap 10:30"|Ten-thirty|"“Officer of the deck!” It was the voice of Queeg, resonating in the speaking tube from the charthouse. Surprised, Willie glanced at the dim phosphorescent clockface. Ten-thirty, time for the captain to be in his cabin. He stooped to the conical brass mouthpiece of the tube."|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
"ap 23:45"|"quarter to twelve"|"But the watch passed in the routine of pinging, zigzagging, and maintaining station. Harding stumbled up to him in the breezy gloom of the starboard wing at a quarter to twelve. “Ready to relieve you,” he said sadly, exhaling a faint fragrance of coffee."|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
"ap 03:30"|three-thirty|"The general alarm had not yet stopped ringing when he came bolting out on deck in his underwear, clutching shoes, socks, shirt, and trousers. He saw a calm sea, a starry black sky, and ships crisscrossing here and there in the melting formation. Sailors went thundering through the murky passageways and up and down ladders; no need to penalize any of them this time for not wearing helmet and life jacket! As Willie stepped into his pants the hatchway to the wardroom clanged shut behind him, and sailors of the forward repair party dogged it down hard. The ensign slipped his shoes on his naked feet and scrambled up the bridge ladder. The clock in the wheelhouse showed three-thirty. The little space was crowded with shadowy figures. Willie could hear the rasping of steel balls rubbed together. He took his life jacket and helmet from a hook and approached the stoop-shouldered form of Harding. “Ready to relieve you. What’s up?”"|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
03:00|"three o’clock this morning"|"“Sir, we’ve been at battle stations since three o’clock this morning-”"|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
01:00|"one o’clock in the morning"|"Harding said, “My audit of the ship’s service accounts is due.” He tossed aside a magazine and yawned. “Guess I’d better do it before I turn in. Last month he sent for me at one o’clock in the morning and asked for it.”"|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
"ap 08:30"|"half-past eight"|"The Caine’s three-inch pop guns had no part to play in the barrage. Queeg kept the crew at battle stations until the sun rose, and then dismissed them. Willie remained on the bridge to enjoy the thumping, blazing show. At half-past eight a long arc of assault boats crept across the quiet waters toward Roi-Namur, main northern fortress of the atoll. The islands were no longer green at all, but sandy gray, spotted here and there with black. Little fires flickered on them, pale in the white sunlight. The foliage had all burned or withered away, leaving splintered, crisscrossed tangles of tree trunks, through which could be seen ruins of squat buildings, and some empty broken walls. Willie watched through binoculars the arrival of the assault boats on the beaches, the swarming forward of the tanks and the marines, the unexpected puffs of white and orange from the inner gray wastes of the islands. He saw some marines fall. The sight was thrilling and a little saddening, like seeing a fighter knocked out."|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
"ap ~ 03:30"|"around three-thirty"|"Ordinarily when a detached officer quitted the Caine nobody took notice except the gangway watch, who had to log the exact time of his leaving. But Willie, who had the watch that afternoon, began to see around three-thirty that something extraordinary was going on. Sailors were congregating near the sea ladder, talking in low tones. The officers began to drift to the quarterdeck, too, one by one. Officers and men alike watched the movements of troops and machines on the battered gray islands, or made jokes about the physiques of swimmers splashing around a destroyer anchored close by, or gawked at the deck hands painting number-three stack slate blue. The sweet oily smell of paint was strong in the warm air."|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
"~ 12:00"|"Around noon"|"Around noon, human nature revolted. The black gang began to bootleg water in the after engine room, where the evaporators were, so that no pressure would be found by Queeg in any pipes. The word passed through the ship like a telegram. The two narrow steel ladders descending to the broiling, clanking engine space became choked with sailors. Paynter quickly discovered what was happening, and reported it to Maryk in the charthouse. The executive officer shrugged. “Can’t hear a word you’re saying,” he said. “Stack gas has got my ears ringing.”"|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"Ducely, indeed, dropped his head on his arms beside the coding machine at three o’clock, and bleated to Willie that he could stand it no more; he was going aft to get a drink in the engine room. Willie glared at him. Ensign Keith bore small resemblance at this moment to the chubby, cheery-faced piano player who had walked into Furnald Hall fourteen months earlier. He had marked lines around mouth and nose; cheekbones and chin stood out from the round face. His eyes were sunk in smudged sockets. His face was grimy, and brown hairs bristled all over it. Trickles of sweat ran down his face into the neck of his open collar, staining the shirt dark brown. “You go back aft, you sad little bastard,” he said (Ducely was three inches the taller of the two), “and you had better start living in your life jacket. I swear to God I’ll throw you over the side.”"|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"“The water in the pipes, hey? Very good. That’s what the officers on this ship can all use for a while. The crew’s water restriction goes off at five o’clock. The officers’ restriction will continue for another forty-eight hours. You inform Mr. Maryk of that fact, Mr. Jorgensen, and then submit a written report to me explaining why I should not make out an unsatisfactory fitness report for you” (he spat out the word “fitness” as though it were an oath) “at once!”"|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
12:00|noon|"Stilwell was in the captain’s cabin for an hour. Willie lurked on the well deck, perspiring in the vertical bluish glare of the noon sun, watching the captain’s door. At last the gunner’s mate came out. In one hand he carried his Courts and Boards, in the other a sheet of white paper. His face was lead-colored, and trickling with sweat. Willie ran up to him. “What’s the dope, Stilwell?”"|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
"> 08:00"|"after eight o’clock in the morning"|"Queeg came in head down, shoulders hunched, his face gray with rage. He announced that he was now convinced there was no loyalty whatever to him in the wardroom. Therefore all gentle treatment of officers was at an end. He laid down several new edicts. There would be five points off a fitness rating for any mistake in a log; another five points off for every hour that a report or statement was overdue; and an automatic unsatisfactory fitness rating if any officer was caught sleeping any time after eight o’clock in the morning or before eight at night."|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"

12:00|noon|"Things were so quiet in the patrol sector that the captain secured the crew from battle stations at noon, and went below to his cabin. Willie was relieved of the deck. He was desperately tired, having been awake for more than thirty hours, but the captain’s edict against daytime sleeping made retirement to his bunk too risky. He knew Queeg was heavily asleep in his cabin; but there was always the chance that a call of nature would bring the captain down to the wardroom. Willie went up to the flying bridge, nestled down on the hot iron deck, and slept in the blazing sun like a cat for four hours. He went back to the wheelhouse for the afternoon watch much refreshed."|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
04:00|"4 A.M."|"Willie took uneasy note of these peculiarities. They reminded him of incidents in novels about men on long sea voyages, and there was a not quite pleasant amusement in seeing the classic symptoms popping out in his shipmates. And then he himself was stricken. One day the thought occurred to him, as he was drinking coffee on the bridge during a watch, that it would be rather elegant to have his own monogrammed coffee mug. In itself the notion was not odd, but his response to it was. In a few minutes, a monogrammed coffee mug came to seem to him the most wonderful imaginable possession on earth. He could not pay attention to the watch for thinking of the mug. He could see it floating in the air before his eyes. When he was relieved he rushed to the shipfitter’s shack, borrowed a small file, and spent several hours gouging “WK” into a crockery cup with a jeweler’s precision and delicacy while the dinner hour passed and night fell. He filled the excavated letters with a rich blue paint, and laid the mug tenderly in his desk drawer to dry, cushioned with socks and underwear. When he was wakened at 4 A.M. to go on watch his first thought was of the mug. He took it out of the drawer and sat gloating over it like a girl over a love letter, so he was ten minutes late in relieving, and drew a snarl from the weary Keefer. The following afternoon he brought the cup up. to the bridge and casually handed it to the signalman Urban, asking him to fill it from the radar-shack Silex. The envious, admiring glances of the sailors filled Willie with pleasure."|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"It was only eight o’clock, but the sun was already hot on the unprotected flying bridge. Keefer squinted at the carriers, seven of them now, moving slowly over the glittering water. The Montauk was sixth in line. Down-channel, the leading carrier swung ponderously to port and headed out toward the open sea. “Wrong way for the south anchorage,” Keefer said bitterly."|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
"ap 00:00"|"twelve o’clock"|"Willie came off watch that night at twelve o’clock and tumbled heavily into bed. He was dozing amid brightening visions of May Wynn when a hand poked his ribs.

"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"The captain sent down again and again for helpings, the last time at eleven o’clock, when all the officers were sitting around in rare good-fellowship, exchanging sex reminiscences as they smoked and drank coffee.

At ten o’clock he was distracted from the strawberry crisis by the arrival of the two new ensigns, Farrington and Voles, in a landing craft from the beach. The OOD inspected the uneasy recruits as they stood on the quarterdeck, waiting for the sailors to pass up their gear from the boat, and decided he liked Farrington and didn’t like Voles. The latter was round-shouldered, and had a greenish complexion and a high voice. He seemed several years older than Farrington, who looked like an ensign in a cigarette advertisement, ruddy, handsome, and blue-eyed. The muss and fatigue of travel, and a certain mischievous humor with which he looked around at the dirty old ship, relieved his good looks. Willie liked him for his soiled gray shirt and his impish smile. Voles’s shirt was stiffly starched. “Wait here, gentlemen,” he said. He went forward and knocked at the captain’s door."|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"

“The crew expected an arrest at noon,” said the exec.
“Always good to keep ’em guessing. The next thing we’ve got to do-the last thing, actually-is find that duplicate key. And how do you gentlemen suggest we do that?” Queeg grinned from one officer to another. “Pretty tough, you think, hey? Well, here’s what we’re going to do. It’s three simple steps. Step one. We’re going to collect every single key aboard ship, tagged with the name of the owner. Step two. We’re going to make an intensive search of the ship and a personal search of everybody to be sure we’ve got all the keys. Step three. We test all the keys on the wardroom padlock.

In the dismal yellow-gray daylight the sea was heaving and bubbling like black mud. White streaks of foam lay along the tops of the deep troughs. The wind pulled at Willie’s eyelids. All around there was nothing to be seen but ridges and valleys of water, except at moments when the old minesweeper labored to the top of a swell. Then they caught glimpses of ships everywhere, the great battleships and carriers, the tankers, the destroyers, all plunging through waves which broke solidly on their forecastles and smashed into creamy streams. The Caine’s forecastle was inches deep in water all the time. The anchors disappeared every few minutes under black waves, and foam boiled down along the deck, piled against the bridgehouse, and sloshed over the side. It was not raining, but the air was like the air of a bathhouse. Dark gray clouds in masses tumbled overhead. The ship was rolling less than during the night, and pitching much more. The rising and dropping deck felt like the floor of an elevator."|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"

They did not know, of course, that the admiral was committed to an air strike in support of a landing by General MacArthur on Mindoro, and had to fuel his ships, or else deprive the Army of air cover. At half-past one the task force discontinued fueling and began to run southwest to get out of the storm."|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"

He came to the slow realization, during the watch, that this was extremely bad weather; weather to worry about; during a couple of steep rolls he had flickers of panic. He drew reassurance from the stolidity of the helmsman and the quartermasters, who hung onto their holds on wheel or engine-room telegraph, and droned obscene insults at each other in fatigued but calm tones, while the black wheelhouse rolled and fell and rose and trembled, and rain drummed on the windows, dripping inside in trickles on the deck. The other ships were invisible. Willie maintained station by radar ranges and bearings on the nearest tanker."|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"

He had thought that the blackness at the top of the ladder was open night. Now he glanced at his watch. It was seven o’clock in the morning."|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"“It began dropping while I was on the mid. I’ve stayed here ever since. The captain and Steve have been on deck since one o’clock. This terrific wind just came up-I don’t know, fifteen or twenty minutes ago-must be a hundred knots-”"|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
"ap ~ 07:00"|"around seven o’clock"|"“Well, sir, on that big roll around seven o’clock, I-I set ’em. The whole fantail was awash. Had to rig a life line-”"|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
"ap 09:45"|"fifteen minutes to ten"|"Willie was looking at the clock. It was fifteen minutes to ten. He was dumfounded to think he had had the deck less than two hours. The import of what was taking place between Maryk and Queeg penetrated his mind slowly. He could not believe it was happening. It was as incredible as his own death."|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
"ap 23:45"|"quarter to twelve"|"Willie looked at the clock in astonishment. Time had stopped running in his mind. It was a quarter to twelve. “Okay,” he said. The formulas of the relieving ceremony came mechanically to his lips. “Steaming on various courses and speeds to look for survivors of the George Black. Steaming on boilers one, two, and three. Depth charges set on safe. Condition Able set throughout the ship. Last time I saw the barometer it had risen to 29.10. Fleet course is 180, but we’ve lost contact with formation due to jammed radars, and I don’t know where we are. About one hundred and fifty miles east of Ulithi, I’d say. You can check our 0800 dead reckoning position. We’re in the same place, more or less. The captain has been relieved under Article 184, and is still on the bridge. The executive officer has command and is at the conn. I guess that’s all.”"|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"

“Captain White won’t be back till six o’clock, sir.”
“Captain who? White?”"|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
"ap 03:30"|three-thirty|"“No, no! Honey, I’ll be through around three-when, Marty?-three-thirty, Willie-meet me in the Brill Building, can you do that?”"|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
"ap 03:30"|Three-thirty|"“Oh, Willie. The Brill Building. Hell, I keep forgetting you’re not a song plugger. Well, you know, across the street from the Rivoli-the big gray building-listen, it’s the Sono-phono Studios, can you remember that? Sono-phono.”
“Okay. Three-thirty. I’ll be there. Don’t you go to school anymore?”
“Oh.” May’s voice became apologetic. “That. I’m afraid I’ve been playing hooky. I’ll tell you all about it.”"|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
"ap 07:30"|seven-thirty|"“Some home-coming. A weepy, drunken, jabbering sweetheart passing out on you in a roach trap-” May slid down into the bed, and closed her eyes, murmuring, “I have amazing powers of recuperation. Wake me at seven-thirty. You may have to dump over the bed, but get me up. I’ll surprise you-just pretend we’re meeting for the first time at seven-thirty-” She was asleep in a minute, her hair tumbled loosely, dark red on the white pillow. Willie looked for a long time at the pallid face smudged with lipstick. Then he took up Troilus and Cressida, opened it at random, and began to read. But as soon as he struck a speech about love, halfway down the page, his mind wandered off."|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"“I have other clients. Get her to bed after the two o’clock show, Willie.”"|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
"ap 02:45"|"quarter to three"|"When they came into her squalid room back at the hotel, it was a quarter to three. Willie was suppressing yawns, and his eyes smarted. Without a word they took off their coats, lay on the bed, and kissed hungrily and wildly for a few minutes. Her forehead, her hands, felt hot to Willie’s lips, but he went on kissing her anyway. At last with a common impulse, they slowed and stopped. She looked him full in the face, her eyes shining in the dim light of the floor lamp."|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
"~ 00:00"|"around midnight"|"“Sure.”
“It’ll be around midnight.”
“All right.”"|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
07:00|"Seven o’clock in the morning"|"“When are you leaving?”
“Seven o’clock in the morning.”
May rose, and slipped the bolt on her door. “Nosiest musicians in the world work here.” She came to Willie and put her arms around him. They exchanged a fearfully long, blind wild kiss. “That’s all,” May said, pushing herself out of his arms. “Remember it the rest of your life. You’ll have to go. I find it hurts to have you around.” She opened the door; Willie walked out and threaded through the jostling dancers to the street."|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
"~ 11:00"|"about eleven o’clock in the morning"|"Willie Keith returned to the Chrysanthemum about eleven o’clock in the morning. He dropped his bags in his room and looked through the other rooms for Caine officers, but found only empty rumpled bunks. Then he heard faintly from the shower a bellowing of “Partez-moi d’amour Rrrrrredites-moi des choses tendres ...” and he knew that Keefer was back. He found the novelist drying himself before a mirror, standing on wooden clogs. “ ‘Ja vous aim-uh-’ Willie, you old Dickens lover! How are you, my lad?”"|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"The large wall clock over Challee’s desk ticked around from ten o’clock to quarter of eleven while various legal ceremonies, incomprehensible to Maryk, were performed. For his first witness, Challee called Lieutenant Commander Philip Francis Queeg."|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"

"ap 10:02"|"two minutes past ten"|"“Okay, Lieutenant Keith,” said an orderly, opening the door to the anteroom at two minutes past ten."|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
00:00|midnight|"Willie hesitated for several seconds, feeling the weight of the court members’ unfriendly looks like a pressure on his forehead. “Maybe you can make them all sound silly and trivial here, sir, but at the time they were serious. He cut off the movies for six months just because he wasn’t invited to a showing by mistake-he cut off the water at the equator because he was annoyed by the detachment of an officer-he called midnight conferences on insignificant details with department heads who were standing a one-in-three deck watch. And he forbade sleeping by day so there was no chance to catch up on sleep-”"|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
"ap 10:50"|"ten minutes of eleven"|"Willie looked at the clock as he left the stand. It was ten minutes of eleven. He was amazed, just as he had been on the morning of the typhoon, by the slow passage of time. He imagined he had been in the witness chair for four hours."|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
"ap 02:05"|"five minutes past two"|"“Dr. Bird will be my last witness, sir,” Challee said to the court, as the orderly went out to call the second psychiatrist. “Very well,” said Blakely, glancing at the clock. It was five minutes past two. The lieutenant who came in was an extremely slender, youthful-looking man with dark hair, sallow skin, and sharp sensitive features. His eyes were brown, deep-set, large, and penetrating. There was something of the fanatic in his look. He was quite handsome."|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"“It’s three o’clock,” said Blakely. “Is the defense ready to present its case?”"|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
"ap 02:05"|Two-five|"“That’s hard to answer.”
“I’ll bet it is. Four-oh? Two-five? Zero?”
“I think I was a loyal officer.”"|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"“Did you tell the other officers that you had intended to come north, as Maryk did, at ten o’clock-that is, about fifteen minutes after the relief took place?”"|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"There was a long silence. Then Queeg said, “Well, I don’t see any inconsistency there. I’ve repeatedly stated in my testimony that my rule is safety first. As I say the ship wasn’t in danger but a typhoon is still a typhoon and I’d just about decided that we’d do as well riding it out head to sea. I might have executed my intention at ten o’clock and then again I might not have. I was still weighing all the factors but as I say I had that ship under control and even after Maryk relieved me I saw to it that it remained under control. I never abandoned my post.”"|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"Greenwald said, “Defense has finished its presentation.”
“Recess until one o’clock,” said Blakely.

"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"Was written on it in flourishing letters of thick yellow sugar. It was surrounded by a bank of ferns and roses. The table was crowded with flowers, and candles, and silver, and bottles of champagne. Shreds of gold and silver foil from the wine bottles were scattered on the white cloth. It was seven o’clock, the chair at the head of the table was still vacant, and no food had yet been served. The officers were already boisterously drunk. Mr. and Mrs. Maryk smiled uncomfortably at the roistering jokes all around them, and laughed aloud whenever their son did. The exec sat at the right of Greenwald’s empty chair, with his parents beside him. Opposite them were Keefer and Keith, side by side, sparking the merriment with a running fire of shouted jokes about Old Yellowstain. It was an inexhaustible topic. Jorgensen, at the foot of the table, was dissolved in howling giggles; tears ran down from his squinting bloodshot eyes. Several new officers who had reported aboard since the ship’s return, and who had never seen Queeg, listened in wide-eyed wonder, and laughed uneasily at the jokes, and drank vast quantities of Keefer’s champagne."|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"Willie was in the charthouse, marking bearings along the course line. The Caine was rounding the southern end of Okinawa en route to Nakagusuku Wan to pick up mail for the mine fleet. There had been no air-raid warning. It was ten o’clock in a gray cloudy morning. The sea was calm and lonely."|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
12:00|noon|"Keefer was on the bridge, his arm in a new white sling, when the report came up. The Caine was lying to in the waters where it had been hit. It was noon, and the sun was hot and dazzling overhead. A stale, sour smell of burning pervaded the sooty ship."|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
">> 00:00"|"long after midnight"|"It was long after midnight when Willie closed Keefer’s manuscript, put it aside, and went to the ship’s office. Snapping on the yellow desk lamp, he bolted the door and uncovered the typewriter. There was dead silence in the airless room except for the muffled creaking of fenders between the hull and the side of the Pluto. (The Caine was alongside the tender for repairs.) In the drawer for paper he found some of the yeoman’s tattered pornography, and was amused by the fact that he didn’t feel like stopping to read it. He rolled paper into the machine and wrote in a steady rattle, never pausing."|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
02:15|"quarter past two in the morning"|"Well, it’s now a quarter past two in the morning, and I could easily write into the dawn and not be tired. I wish, my sweet, that I might have proposed to you in the most beautiful place in the world with music and perfume all around instead of pounding out an incoherent letter in a dismal ship’s office, which you will receive all crumpled and dirty. But if this letter can make you half as happy as your answer saying yes would me, then no trappings could make it any better."|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"He read this letter over perhaps twenty times, cutting a phrase here, inserting a sentence there. He finally became numb to its meaning. Then he copied it all over on the typewriter, dropped the papers in his room, and made himself a cup of coffee. It was four o’clock when he picked up the smooth draft and read it for the last time. He got a very clear picture of how it would strike May: astounding, somewhat groveling, wild, and babbling-but still, the truth. There were a dozen more places where he wanted to correct it, but he decided to let it go. It was impossible to make it a good, dignified letter; he was in a bad, undignified position. He was crawling back to a girl he had jilted. No words could change that. If she still loved him-and he was fairly sure she did, judging by their last kiss-then she would swallow his foolishness and her pride and accept him. That was all he wanted, and this proposal sufficed for it, if any would. He sealed the letter up, dropped it in the ship’s mailbox, and went to sleep, feeling that life from now on, failing another Kamikaze, would be an empty wait while his letter went halfway around the world and the answer returned the same long way."|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
"< 12:00"|"just before noon"|"The minesweeping career of the Caine was destined to be brief-to that extent his instinct had been right. Willie was just beginning to enjoy the perilous game when the fuel pumps of number-one boiler collapsed, and the ship was slowed to twelve knots. This reduced the maneuverability of the long vessel below the safety point in an area of drifting mines. The OTC ordered the Caine to drop out of line and return to Okinawa. It was just before noon. An auxiliary mine sweeper, one of the clean-up ships in the rear, steamed forward to close the gap, and the Caine faltered and turned away. Keggs, on the bridge of the Moulton next in line, waved good-by to Willie and sent him a blinker message: Lucky. Maybe I’ll try throwing a wrench in my pumps, too. See you later."|"The Caine Mutiny"|"Herman Wouk"
