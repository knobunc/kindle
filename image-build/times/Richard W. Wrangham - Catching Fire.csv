At 8:30 A.M. she had a bowl of “energy soup,” which she describes as a “room-temperature concoction made of sunflower greens, which are the tiny first shoots of a sunflower plant, and rejuvelac, a fermented wheat drink that tastes a lot like bad lemonade.” She added a couple of spoonfuls of blended papaya for interest. Lunch was a salad of sunflower greens, sprouted fenugreek seeds, sprouted broccoli seeds, fermented cabbage, and a loaf made of sprouted sunflower seeds, dehydrated seaweed, and some vegetables. Dinner was more sprouts, avocado chunks, pineapple, red onion, olive oil, raw vinegar, and sea salt. An hour later she was hungry again. In photographs she looks distinctly thin, but she was happy.

He began on August 1, 1825. “At 12 o’clock, M., I introduced through the perforation, into the stomach, the following articles of diet, suspended by a silk string, and fastened at proper distances, so as to pass in without pain—viz.:—a piece of highly seasoned a la mode beef; a piece of raw, salted, fat pork; a piece of raw, salted, lean beef; a piece of boiled, salted beef; a piece of stale bread; and a bunch of raw, sliced cabbage; each piece weighing about two drachms; the lad [St. Martin] continuing his usual employment around the house.”"|"Catching Fire"|"Richard W.

He was explicit in the case of potatoes. “Pieces of raw potato, when submitted to the operation of this fluid, in the same manner, almost entirely resist its action. Many hours elapse before the slightest appearance of digestion is observable, and this only upon the surface, where the external laminae become a little softened, mucilaginous, and slightly farinaceous. Every physician who has had much practice in the diseases of children knows that partially boiled potatoes, when not sufficiently masticated (which is always the case with children), are frequently a source of colics and bowel complaints, and that large pieces of this vegetable pass the bowels untouched by digestion.” It was the same with meat. When Beaumont introduced boiled beef and raw beef at noon, the boiled beef was gone by 2 P.M. But the piece of raw, salted, lean beef of the same size was only slightly macerated on the surface, while its general texture remained firm and intact."|"Catching Fire"|"Richard W. Wrangham"

Homo erectus was as poorly defended a creature as we are, unable to sprint fast and dependent on weapons for any success in fighting.

If he had eaten nothing while on the hunt, he would need to be back in camp before midday, and there he would find his mate’s gathered foods (assuming she had been able to complete her food gathering so early in the day). He would then have to spend the rest of the day eating, resting, eating, resting, and eating. In short, the long hours of chewing necessitated by a raw diet would have sharply reduced hunting time. It is questionable whether the sexual division of labor would have been possible at all."|"Catching Fire"|"Richard W. Wrangham"

05:00|"5.3 hours"|"65 Cooking increased the protein value of eggs by around 40 percent: The discovery that we do not digest raw egg protein nearly as well as cooked egg protein is the first to identify the effects of heat on the digestibility of protein in the human gut. But the evidence that raw eggs are a relatively poor food has been hinted at by other studies. For example, allergy researchers collected breast milk from women who had eaten either raw or cooked eggs for breakfast. They found that the concentration of ovalbumin rose in breast milk after eating eggs, and that the rise was about twice as fast when eggs were cooked as when they were raw. Again, the cooked eggs appeared more digestible. Allergy study: Palmer et al. (2005). The recent data about the effects of cooking on digestibility of eggs were anticipated by at least two groups. Hawk (1919) claimed his research team had evidence that raw egg white is used less completely than cooked egg white. Cohn (1936) showed that rats grew poorly on diets rich in raw egg white compared to those eating cooked egg white. She attributed this partly to the anti-trypsin factor and partly to raw egg proteins being passed more rapidly than cooked egg proteins from the stomach to the small intestine, an effect also found by Evenepoel et al. (1998). Cohn’s suggestion that a rapid gastric emptying rate might be responsible for the poor energy supply from raw eggs is not supported by modern data. First, in recent decades the idea that the stomach was responsible for a large proportion of digestion has given way to the orthodoxy that most digestion occurs in the small intestine. Second, Evenepoel et al. (1998) found no difference in transit time to the ileocecal junction (the half-time averaged 5.3 hours in both cases). This meant that raw eggs spent more time than cooked eggs in the small intestine, where digestive processes are most active, so they should have been better digested than the cooked eggs."|"Catching Fire"|"Richard W.
