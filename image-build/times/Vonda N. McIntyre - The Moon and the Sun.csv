"ap 08:00"|"Eight o’clock"|"Eight o’clock chimed. Servants opened the window-curtains, flooding the room 
with eastern sunlight and cold air from the open windows. Sunshine doubly gilded 
the tapestries and the brocade bed-curtains, shimmered from the golden-tan 
parquet floor, illuminated the fine paintings and the mirrors, accentuated the 
high relief of the image of 
France
watching over the King’s sleep."|"The Moon and the Sun"|"Vonda N. McIntyre"

forgot the time.”"|"The Moon and the Sun"|"Vonda N. McIntyre"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"Count Lucien laughed. “I assure you, His Majesty will be occupied from morning 
till after midnight. Ceremonies, entertainments, the luncheon in his Menagerie. 
Planning Pope Innocent’s crusade against heretical shopkeepers. His Majesty 
expects to conduct his regular council meeting, and he must practice for 
Carrousel.”"|"The Moon and the Sun"|"Vonda N. McIntyre"
00:00|midnight|"Once Mother Superior lectured her students about fornication. She left them in 
such a state of confusion and excitement that at bedtime they whispered instead 
of sleeping. When the holy sisters checked their charges at midnight, they heard 
the whispers. That night, and for a month afterwards, the sisters laid 
themselves down next to the students, rigid and wakeful, to prevent forbidden 
words and to enforce the proper sleeping position among their charges: on their 
backs, their hands on top of the covers."|"The Moon and the Sun"|"Vonda N. McIntyre"
00:00|midnight|"His Majesty led the way toward the Salon of Abundance and the midnight 
collation. His Holiness accompanied him, after a single glance that singled Yves 
out and excluded Marie-Josèphe as well as Count Lucien. Marie-Josèphe looked 
down at Count Lucien and up at 
Lorraine."|"The Moon and the Sun"|"Vonda N. McIntyre"
00:00|midnight|"He bowed sharply and disappeared. Marie-Josèphe, faint with hunger, wanted only 
to abandon the argument with Yves and join the other courtiers at midnight 
supper. But her brother led her deeper into the State Apartments. The Salon of 
Mercury was only dimly-lit, and deserted. Marie-Josèphe wondered if they should 
be here, all alone except for Mercury. The messenger of the gods raced across 
the ceiling; wavering candlelight ruffled the feathers of the roosters drawing 
his chariot."|"The Moon and the Sun"|"Vonda N. McIntyre"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"At six o’clock, Marie-Josèphe put several finished drawings away and slipped 
into her room to change clothes; she and Odelette must attend Lotte; they must 
all help Madame dress; they must gather in the antechamber outside His Majesty’s 
bedroom and join the procession to Mass."|"The Moon and the Sun"|"Vonda N. McIntyre"
12:00|noon|"The coolness of the chateau gave way to the warmth of the terrace above the 
gardens. The sun had already sped halfway to noon. It’s warm today! 
Marie-Josèphe thought gratefully."|"The Moon and the Sun"|"Vonda N. McIntyre"

A long rope of lustrous pearls twined through her blue-black hair."|"The Moon and the Sun"|"Vonda N. McIntyre"
00:00|midnight|"“Your Majesty, the Church deems it a fish, suitable for Fridays. But its flesh 
is said to be succulent as meat. If I butcher it now, Your Majesty, I might make 
a dish — a little dish, for Your Majesty alone, perhaps a paté — for your supper 
alone, so you need not wait for midnight feast.”"|"The Moon and the Sun"|"Vonda N. McIntyre"
00:00|midnight|"“M. Boursin begs for time to prepare the monster’s flesh. I shall give him one 
day, though he will spoil my peace with complaints. You may have until midnight 
of Carrousel, midnight tomorrow, to find the treasure.”"|"The Moon and the Sun"|"Vonda N. McIntyre"

turned back from Yves’ laboratory. “Where is the key to the cage, if you please, 
Mlle de la Croix?”
“It isn’t time! It’s only noon! His Majesty promised — !”
“Calm yourself. His Majesty orders the sea monster to perform for his guests.” 
He rattled the bars of the cage. “Leap, sea monster!”"|"The Moon and the Sun"|"Vonda N. McIntyre"
00:00|midnight|"“No!” Marie-Josèphe cried. “She has until midnight!” She turned on 
Lorraine
in a fury. Sherzad screamed. Her claws ripped the sling with a high harsh tear.

“Not till after midnight.”
“At one minute past!”"|"The Moon and the Sun"|"Vonda N. McIntyre"
00:00|Midnight|"Yves hardened his heart against the sea woman’s pleas and his sister’s 
supplication. Midnight would bring Sherzad’s doom. He could not save the 
creature, he could not save his sister from grief, or from her own stubborn 
folly. He could only save himself."|"The Moon and the Sun"|"Vonda N. McIntyre"

one minute after midnight. He might wait a moment for Marie-Josèphe to appear,

sea monster flesh had been a wonder, stretching past sunset, when the servants 
whisked away the flowers from the candle-stands and replaced them with 
candelabra, and beyond midnight, when the servants replaced the guttering 
candles and carried in another course. Marie-Josèphe had not been able to eat a 
bite."|"The Moon and the Sun"|"Vonda N. McIntyre"
