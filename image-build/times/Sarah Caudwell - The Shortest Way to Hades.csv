"ap 05:15"|"quarter past five"|"It had been about three months earlier, a Thursday in late February. I had been persuaded by an obligation of friendship to attend a seminar in the London School of Economics. By a quarter past five I could endure no more: I slipped out into Lincoln’s Inn Fields and sought refuge in 62 New Square."|"The Shortest Way to Hades"|"Sarah Caudwell"
"ap 07:30"|"half past seven"|"“Look here, Larwood, do be reasonable—you can’t seriously expect me to tell Tancred’s to drag Camilla out of bed in the middle of the night—”
“It’s only half past seven,” said Selena mildly.
“—well, drag her away from dinner in the middle of the evening, and tell her she’s got to cough up another eighty thousand quid—”"|"The Shortest Way to Hades"|"Sarah Caudwell"
"ap 10:30"|ten-thirty|"“Sweet suffering swordfish,” said Cantrip, clutching his forehead in an interesting dramatic gesture, “there ought to be a law against it. All right—tell Camilla that she’s got to cough up an extra hundred and sixty thousand if she wants this thing to go through and she’s got until ten-thirty tomorrow morning to decide about it.”"|"The Shortest Way to Hades"|"Sarah Caudwell"
"ap 10:30"|"half past ten"|"“I see,” said Selena, rising from her chair. “I’d better ring Tancred’s, I suppose, and see if they can arrange for us all to have further instructions from our clients before half past ten tomorrow. After that, perhaps we can all go and eat something. Aren’t you joining us, Julia?” For Julia had begun that process of gathering things together which signifies her intention to depart."|"The Shortest Way to Hades"|"Sarah Caudwell"

You will perhaps recall, however, that I am hoping to catch a plane to Athens this evening, with a view to sailing round the Ionian Islands. The crew—namely Sebastian—has been instructed to report promptly for duty at 17:00 local time—or, as you landsmen would say, five o’clock this afternoon. To arrive late might seriously impair the authority of the skipper—namely mine—for the duration of the voyage.”"|"The Shortest Way to Hades"|"Sarah Caudwell"

"< 12:00"|"Towards noon"|"Towards noon—Selena, I supposed, was by then already under sail on the blue waters of the Ionian—I went out into Middle Temple Lane and turned my steps towards Fleet Street. The news-vendor on the corner of these two thoroughfares was already offering for sale the earliest edition of the evening paper. I paused to glance at the placard proclaiming the latest news:"|"The Shortest Way to Hades"|"Sarah Caudwell"
"~ 03:00"|"about three o’clock in the morning"|"They had gone out with their nets as usual on Thursday night, not quite trusting the weather but unwilling to lose a night’s work and meaning to make for Parga if it looked like breaking. The storm, however, blew up more suddenly than they had expected, and overtook them a few miles south of Parga at about three o’clock in the morning—a force eight gale, gusting nine, and blowing from the south. Parga is at the center of a stretch of rock-bound coast running west to east for about twelve miles, almost at right-angles to the main coastline—when the wind is from the south, an absolute lee shore: a dangerous harbor to run for in a southerly gale. The skipper accordingly decided to ride out the storm at sea. They had just settled down comfortably for the night—I tell the story as it was told to me—when a distress flare went up somewhere on the starboard bow."|"The Shortest Way to Hades"|"Sarah Caudwell"
"ap < 06:00"|"a little before six o’clock"|"Our own landing had no such traumatic qualities. We anchored at Casiope, at the northern end of the island, a little before six o’clock, and went ashore to drink ouzo in one of the pavement cafes."|"The Shortest Way to Hades"|"Sarah Caudwell"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"On Thursday they had sailed down to Preveza in Camilla’s yacht, the Sycorax, for a dinner party with friends. The gathering, however, had been less convivial than they expected, and by eleven o’clock they were back on board. A south wind had sprung up, which Camilla and Leonidas thought it a pity to waste: they both enjoy night sailing, and it would have been annoying to wait at Preveza until morning and then find that the wind had dropped."|"The Shortest Way to Hades"|"Sarah Caudwell"
"ap ~ 02:00"|"about two o’clock"|"The sky at this stage was clear, and it did not occur to anyone to listen to the weather forecast. Camilla took the first watch, having laid a course for Port Gaio on the island of Paxos and expecting to arrive there in the early hours of the morning. Leonidas took over at about two o’clock, with instructions to keep on a compass heading of 295 degrees. By this time it was very dark, the sky having clouded over, and the wind had freshened to something like a force five. There was some discussion about whether they should hoist the storm jib instead of the genoa. Leonidas thought he could handle the boat without any change of sail, and Camilla agreed in the end that it would be enough to take a reef in the mainsail."|"The Shortest Way to Hades"|"Sarah Caudwell"
09:30|"half past nine this morning"|"Soon after this Dolly joined us, and we talked of other matters; but her husband and Sebastian continued their conversation until an hour at which she easily persuaded me that it would be “simply too ridiculous” to go back to the Kymothoe when a spare room and a comfortable bed were available at the Villa Miranda. They were still talking when the rest of us went to bed, and I have no idea when they adjourned—late enough for Sebastian still to be sleeping at half past nine this morning."|"The Shortest Way to Hades"|"Sarah Caudwell"
"ap 06:10"|"ten minutes past six o’clock"|"Aristotle, I suppose, would have approved of cricket—a game which peculiarly demonstrates how a moment’s error may bring down the protagonist from the heights of prosperity to the depths of disaster. At ten minutes past six o’clock the Writers seemed in an enviable position: a mere forty runs needed for victory; thirteen overs in which to make them; eight wickets standing; and their captain still at the crease in apparently invincible form. By half past the hour matters were very different."|"The Shortest Way to Hades"|"Sarah Caudwell"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"On the following morning, having accepted the hospitality of the spare bed in Timothy’s flat, I woke to find him making a hurried breakfast. At nine o’clock, if the efforts of their solicitors could achieve it, the parties to the Remington-Fiske application were to be gathered together in 62 New Square to receive advice and give instructions on Julia’s minor amendment. In order to discuss certain preliminary matters with the other Counsel concerned, Timothy proposed to be there at half past eight."|"The Shortest Way to Hades"|"Sarah Caudwell"

"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"Not the most graceful of letters, from a young woman asking a favor of a comparative stranger; but that might perhaps be shyness. I was not surprised by the letter’s effect on Julia. In the circumstances it had something of the quality of a deathbed request, and Julia would feel a sense of guilt that she had not complied with it—though, had she done so, she would have waited in vain for Deirdre, who by seven o’clock on the Saturday of the Boat Race had already the best of all excuses for failing to keep her engagements. She had wanted to tell Julia of something she had discovered; some childish and trivial secret, very probably, of no interest to anyone; but she had died without telling it. I could understand that Julia would feel troubled."|"The Shortest Way to Hades"|"Sarah Caudwell"

"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"“It isn’t really as bad as it looks,” she said, leaning back and drawing a deep breath. “I’ve only two Opinions and a Statement of Claim to do, and Sebastian isn’t collecting me until five o’clock. I ought to have finished them by then—in manuscript, that is. Having them typed depends on the temporary typist.” Her optimism seemed to fade a little. “Still, if the worse comes to the worst, they can be typed next week, and Julia can sign them off for me.”"|"The Shortest Way to Hades"|"Sarah Caudwell"
"ap 02:30"|"half past two"|"In 63 New Square, however, I was told by Julia’s Clerk that she had as yet made no appearance there: in the afternoon, he added with touching confidence, I could be sure of finding her, since she had an important conference at half past two; but of her present whereabouts he had no idea."|"The Shortest Way to Hades"|"Sarah Caudwell"
"ap 02:30"|two-thirty|"“One would not wish,” he said, “to speak critically of one’s friends. It has to be admitted, however, that Julia is not wholly free of the sin of sloth. If she woke up this morning and found herself with no immediate engagements, it is quite possible that she simply went back to sleep again. And she is capable, in that case, of failing to wake up again in time for her conference at two-thirty, which I understand to be rather important. Shall we stroll along to Bloomsbury and make sure she’s up and about?”"|"The Shortest Way to Hades"|"Sarah Caudwell"
"ap ~ 08:30"|"about half past eight"|"Of Julia, however, there was no sign. At about half past eight on the previous evening she had triumphantly announced that she had at last finished her Opinion on Part XV of the Taxes Act and intended to reward herself with dinner at Guido’s: Carlotta had not seen her since and was beginning to be anxious."|"The Shortest Way to Hades"|"Sarah Caudwell"
"~ 02:00"|"about two o’clock in the morning"|"“At about two o’clock in the morning. And she was still with the parlormaid person—the girl called Rowena.

They apparently intended to go back there and console themselves by drinking his whiskey.”"|"The Shortest Way to Hades"|"Sarah Caudwell"
"ap ~ 10:00"|"about ten o’clock"|"“Oh no,” said Julia, a little surprised. “Rowena woke me up at about ten o’clock, when she had to go to her agency, and gave me a cup of coffee. But I found, in spite of the coffee, that I was in that state of health in which one cannot usefully give one’s mind to the Taxes Acts. The sensible thing seemed to be to take one or two Alka-Seltzers and go to sleep again. But I knew, of course, that I mustn’t sleep too long, because of my conference this afternoon. So that’s when I rang and left my message for you.”"|"The Shortest Way to Hades"|"Sarah Caudwell"

I withdrew to the drawing-room."|"The Shortest Way to Hades"|"Sarah Caudwell"
