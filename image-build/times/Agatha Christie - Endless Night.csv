"ap 00:00"|"12 o’clock"|"The first to arrive was Mr. Andrew P. Lippincott. He was an elderly man, dry and precise in appearance. He was long and lean with suave and courteous manners. He was a Bostonian and from his voice I wouldn’t have known he was an American. By arrangement through the telephone he called upon us in our suite at 12 o’clock. Ellie was nervous, I could tell, although she concealed it very well."|"Endless Night"|"Agatha Christie"
01:00|"one this morning"|"“You know what they’d have been like,” said Ellie. “You too,” she added accusingly. She added, “I’ve had two letters from Cora. One yesterday and one this morning.”"|"Endless Night"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 01:00"|"One o’clock"|"I said to Ellie, “Well, if Greta is going to London for the day, why don’t you drive in and meet us at the George in Bartington. The food there’s very good, so old Phillpot said. He suggested you might come. One o’clock. You go through Market Chadwell and then you take a turning about three miles after that. It’s sign-posted, I think.”"|"Endless Night"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap > 01:00"|"just past one"|"We got to the George and found a good many cars standing there already. Possibly some of the people from the auction. I didn’t see Ellie’s though. We went inside and I looked around for her but she hadn’t turned up yet. However, it was only just past one."|"Endless Night"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap ~ 09:45"|"About quarter to ten"|"“Oh, must have been—well, it must have been three or four hours ago when I went down the road this morning. About quarter to ten maybe, I saw that gipsy woman. The one as lives in the cottages in the village. Least I think it was she. I wasn’t near enough to be sure. But she’s the only one as goes about hereabouts in a red cloak. She was walking up a path through the trees. Somebody told me as she’d said nasty things to the poor American young lady. Threatened her. Told her something bad would happen if she didn’t get out of this place. Very threatening, I hear she was.”"|"Endless Night"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap ~ 04:30"|"About half past four"|"“I’m sure it’ll be very nice,” she said. “Yes. I’ll come. About half past four, will that be right?”"|"Endless Night"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 05:30"|5:30|"Well, that’s how my first meeting with Ellie went. I was in Market Chadwell the next day waiting in the Blue Dog and she came. We had tea together and we talked. We still didn’t say much about ourselves, not about our lives, I mean. We talked mostly about things we thought, and felt; and then Ellie glanced at her wristwatch and said she must be going because her train to London left at 5:30—"|"Endless Night"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 03:30"|3:30|"The funny thing is that I was shocked. I felt a priggish distaste for the corruption of modern society in its richer phases. There had been something so little-girl-like about Ellie, so simple, almost touching in her attitude that I was astonished to find how well up she was in worldly affairs and how much she took for granted. And yet I knew that I was right about her fundamentally. I knew quite well the kind of creature that Ellie was. Her simplicity, her affection, her natural sweetness. That didn’t mean she had to be ignorant of things. What she did know and took for granted was a fairly limited slice of humanity. She didn’t know much about my world, the world of scrounging for jobs, of race course gangs and dope gangs, the rough and tumble dangers of life, the sharp-Aleck flashy type that I knew so well from living amongst them all my life. She didn’t know what it was to be brought up decent and respectable but always hard up for money, with a mother who worked her fingers to the bone in the name of respectability, determining that her son should do well in life. Every penny scrimped for and saved, and the bitterness when your gay carefree son threw away his chances or gambled his all on a good tip for the 3:30."|"Endless Night"|"Agatha Christie"
