         for hotel rooms depending on whether viewers were using Mac or Windows. Other travel
         sites showed people different offers based on their browsing history. Many sites estimate
         your income level, and show you different pages based on that. Much of this is subtle.
         It’s not that you can’t see certain airfares or hotel rooms, it’s just that they’re
         ordered so that the ones the site wants to show you are easier to see and click on.
         We saw in Chapter 3 how data about us can be used to predict age, gender, race, sexual
         preference, relationship status, and many other things. This gives corporations a
         greater advantage over consumers, and as they amass more data, both on individuals
         and on classes of people, that edge will only increase. For example, marketers know
         that women feel less attractive on Mondays, and that that’s the best time to advertise
         cosmetics to them. And they know that different ages and genders respond better to
         different ads. In the future, they might know enough about specific individuals to
         know you’re not very susceptible to offers at 8:00 am because you haven’t had your
         coffee yet and are grouchy, you get more susceptible around 9:30 because you’re fully
         caffeinated, and then are less susceptible again by 11:00 because your blood sugar
         is low just before lunch."|"Data and Goliath"|"Bruce Schneier"
