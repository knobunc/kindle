Whittaker, a plant ecologist at Cornell University for whom “broad classification,” as he called it—numbering and delineating the kingdoms of life—was a sidelight. Whittaker’s tree had little to recommend it by way of artistic flair but delivered some provocative content. It looked like an annotated balloon animal. Or maybe, to be more polite and botanical: a prickly pear cactus. It consisted of five roughly oval lobes: three, stacked upon one, stacked upon another. The lobes represented what Whittaker proposed as the five kingdoms of all life."|"The Tangled Tree"|"David Quammen"
"ap < 01:00"|"just to one"|"So there’s an extraordinary amount of evolutionary pressure, out there in the world, forcing bacteria to acquire resistance or die. But the most startling aspects of the trend have been how speedily resistance has spread and how many different kinds of bacteria have acquired multiple resistance—that is, resistance not just to one antibiotic but also to whole arsenals of different kinds. The danger of multiple resistance is that whatever antibiotic may be prescribed, whatever pharmaceutical may be thrown at it, the bacteria just keep eating a person’s flesh or blood or guts, sometimes to the death. The death of the patient is no dead end to the strain of bacteria, of course, if it has managed to infect other victims in the meantime. And the appearance of resistance to each drug so quickly, in one strain of bacteria and another, as occurred in the 1940s and 1950s, was a phenomenon that couldn’t be explained by the slow Darwinian process of mutation, natural selection, and ordinary inheritance, occurring independently in each case. Darwinian selection was certainly involved, but selection can act only on variation: genetic differences between one individual and another. What was the source of the variation? Mutation alone couldn’t account for the appearance of so many new genes, so fast, in so many different organisms. It had to be something else—something that moved speedily and sideways, even between members of different bacterial species. Tsutomu Watanabe recognized the alternate explanation and, based on research by him and his Japanese colleagues, laid it out in English for the first time."|"The Tangled Tree"|"David Quammen"
"ap ~ 02:23"|"about 223"|"Other scientists, even some deeply engaged with the subject of horizontal gene transfer, found the Salzberg critique persuasive. Ford Doolittle and two colleagues wrote a comment in Science, calling the original claim about 223 transferred genes “the most exciting news” from the Human Genome Project so far, but concluded that it was “probably overenthusiastic.” William F. Martin, a tall American biologist at Heinrich Heine University in Düsseldorf, known for his ferocious intelligence, his important ideas, and his bluntness, called the Consortium’s claim “at least an overstatement, very probably a gross exaggeration and possibly altogether erroneous.” The New York Times took note of this “fresh skirmish in the genome wars,” under a headline about HGT into humans being “Hotly Debated by Rival Scientific Camps.” To the Times reporter, Steven Salzberg said that he’d been surprised by the Consortium’s report of 223 alien genes, but that as he read further, “I was immediately struck by the fact it was likely to be an error, because the method was simply wrong.” Eric Lander, also reached by the Times, didn’t admit being wrong but declined to insist he was right."|"The Tangled Tree"|"David Quammen"
"ap 10:30"|"ten thirty"|"Bill Martin’s lab is in the Department of Molecular Evolution at Heinrich Heine University, in the heart of Düsseldorf, not far from a great bend of the Rhine. I arrived early, was ushered through by his secretary, and sat waiting in his inner office while Martin finished participating in a PhD examination. That left me time to browse the books on his shelves, gaze at the arcane scribblings on a large standing flipchart, and notice the poems, cartoons, and other whimsical décor on the back of his door, including photographs of notable predecessors and colleagues, such as Constantin Merezhkowsky and Ford Doolittle. There were also framed photos of two smiling young daughters. Martin appeared at ten thirty, a large man, large enough to have played lineman during his time at Texas A&M University, though he did not. He greeted me with a robust Texas handshake, we sat at his table, and he talked for two hours, almost without need of prompting by questions from me."|"The Tangled Tree"|"David Quammen"
03:58|"two to four that morning"|"Did I like Japanese food? he asked. Sushi? Yes indeed I did. Good, Martin said, because I’m supposed to be losing weight, but you’re my excuse. We drove to his favorite Japanese restaurant, where he ordered us a huge and very excellent meal, ate voraciously, and allowed me to pay for nothing. Over the noodle soup and the combo plates, we talked more about the origin of eukaryotic cells, the origin of the cell nucleus, and the ultimate origin of life. I shared with him, somewhat shamefacedly, the fact that I had watched the Super Bowl broadcast from two to four that morning, streaming it live on my computer at the hotel, then went back to bed for a few hours’ rest before meeting him. Patriots over Seattle on Malcolm Butler’s last-second interception, worth every minute of lost sleep. I know, I watched it too, he said. All this time, I kept wondering: Where is the famously brusque, intolerant-of-fools, formidably combative Bill Martin?"|"The Tangled Tree"|"David Quammen"
08:00|"eight in the morning"|"Thierry Heidmann is a generous man as well as a distinguished researcher. When he heard where I’d be staying in Paris, he said: Ah, very near my neighborhood. Forget the Metro, I’ll pick you up. So I stood outside my little hotel in the 17th Arrondissement and, promptly eight in the morning, a small white Volkswagen pulled to the curb. Out stepped a man with a graying beard, robust eyebrows, and a blue blazer worn over his sweater, welcoming me to hop in. Instead of swinging north to the nearby Boulevard Périphérique, the great ring road, as I had expected, he drove southeast on a picturesque avenue toward the heart of the city. Traffic wasn’t bad, and along the way, he pointed out some sights: there’s the church de la Madeleine, this is the Place de la Concorde, the Louvre on our left as we cross the Seine, Notre-Dame, of course, just upriver, now here’s Boulevard St.-Germain, and the Sorbonne, and over there the École Normale Supérieure, where I went to school, he said. This man, every day, makes the world’s most elegant commute. We reached the Gustave Roussy Institute in less than an hour, talking the whole way about his background and his work, and then talked for another six hours in his lab office, interrupted barely by lunch."|"The Tangled Tree"|"David Quammen"
