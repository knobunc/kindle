"ap > 01:00"|"a few minutes after one o’clock"|"My prediction that the rain came only in the afternoons was only just right. It was a few minutes after one o’clock when the rain started. Dicky took me in the car as far as the university, where he was to see one of his Oxford friends, and there – on the open plaza – let me out into steady rain. I cursed him, but there was no hostility in Dicky’s self-interest; he would have done the same thing to almost anyone."|"Mexico Set"|"Len Deighton"
12:00|midday|"By midday we’d been waiting nearly three hours, and our plane had still not arrived. Other departures were also delayed. The official explanation was the hurricanes. Mexico City airport was packed with people. There were Indian women clasping sacks of flour and a sequin-suited rock group guarding their amplifiers. All found some way to deal with the interminable delay: mothers suckled babies, boys raced through the concourse on roller-skates, a rug pedlar – burdened under his wares – systematically pitched his captive audience, tour guides paced resolutely, airline staff yawned, footsore hikers snored, nuns told their rosaries, a tall Negro – listening to a Sony Walkman – swayed rhythmically, and some Swedish school kids were gambling away their last few pesos."|"Mexico Set"|"Len Deighton"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"The radio alarm clock was tuned to Radio 3 so that I could hear the seven o’clock news bulletin and then spend fifteen minutes on the exercise bike to the sounds of Mozart and Bach. Since living alone I’d connected the coffee-machine to a time-switch so that I could come downstairs to a smell of fresh coffee. I opened a tin of Carnation milk and found a croissant in the bread-bin. It was old and dried and shrivelled like something discovered in a tomb of the Pharaohs. I chewed it gratefully. I hadn’t had a decent meal since well before getting on the plane. But I wasn’t hungry. My mind was fully occupied with thoughts of the children and the conversation I’d had with my father-in-law. I didn’t want to believe him but his warnings about money worried me. He was seldom, if ever, wrong about money."|"Mexico Set"|"Len Deighton"
"ap 08:45"|"eight forty-five"|"I was outside in the street, unlocking the door of my car, when the girl approached me. She was about thirty, maybe younger, dark-skinned and very attractive. She was wearing a nurse’s uniform complete with dark-blue cloak and a plain blue handbag. ‘My damned car won’t start,’ she said. Her accent was unmistakably West Indian; Jamaica, I guessed. ‘And matron will kill me if I’m not at St Mary Abbots Hospital at eight forty-five. Are you going anywhere in that direction? Or to somewhere I can get a taxi?’"|"Mexico Set"|"Len Deighton"
"ap 08:45"|"eight forty-five"|"‘No, the nurses at St Mary Abbots don’t wear the uniform you described and they don’t change shifts at eight forty-five."|"Mexico Set"|"Len Deighton"
"ap 08:30"|"eight thirty"|"‘He’d like us there at seventy forty-five, for drinks. They sit down to eat at eight thirty. If you live too far away, I’m sure Mrs Cruyer will be happy to let you have a room to change. Come to that,’ I said, ‘you could have a drink at my house and change there. Then I could drive you over. His house is rather difficult to find.’"|"Mexico Set"|"Len Deighton"
"ap ~ 03:00"|"about three"|"Dicky brightened at the idea. ‘That might be a way of doing it,’ he said. The wall behind Dicky was almost completely covered with framed photos of Dicky smiling and shaking hands with important people. This form of self-advertisement, more usually found in the offices of extrovert American film producers, was considered bad form when Dicky first began his collection. But Dicky had made it into a prank, a droll collegiate form of fun, so that now he was able to have his joke and eat it too. One of the photos showed Dicky in Calcutta, while on a tour with Sir Henry Clevemore, the Director-General. It was a large colour photo in a gold frame. The two men were standing in front of a stall displaying crude lithographic posters. By looking closely you could recognize portraits of John Lennon, Napoleon, Marilyn Monroe, Lenin and John F. Kennedy. Somehow I always thought of Dicky as that young man in the photo, smiling at his boss amid a galaxy of successful people. ‘I’ve told Berlin that I want Werner over here immediately. He’ll be on the morning plane. I’ve sent a car to the airport so he will be here about three. We’ll sit him down and find out what the hell it’s all about. Okay, Bernard?’"|"Mexico Set"|"Len Deighton"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"‘The Restaurant, darling, not the Grill. I never see any of my friends when I go to the Grill. Shall we say one o’clock? When you phone, ask for the chef, Mr Edelmann. George knows him awfully well. Mention George.’"|"Mexico Set"|"Len Deighton"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"‘Savoy Restaurant, one o’clock sharp,’ said Tessa. She was muddle-headed and vague about most things, but she was making sure there would be no mistake about our lunch. I suppose anyone who had the number of illicit love affairs and assignations that Tessa enjoyed would have to be methodical and precise about appointments."|"Mexico Set"|"Len Deighton"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"Werner did not arrive at three o’clock. He did not get Dicky’s message until after lunch. The plane on which he was due to fly out of Berlin-Tegel had some mechanical malfunction. Since the old agreements specify that German airliners may not use the airlanes between Berlin and West Germany, there was a delay while another British Airways plane was brought into service. When eventually the plane did arrive in London, Werner was not aboard."|"Mexico Set"|"Len Deighton"
"< 00:00"|"nearly midnight"|"I looked at my watch. It was nearly midnight. ‘What would you like, Tessa?’"|"Mexico Set"|"Len Deighton"

06:00|"six in the morning"|"‘Does it? It would to you, of course. But I’m a Catholic.’ Of course, how could I have forgotten? I felt a fool for having mentioned divorce, and George must have known that, for he quickly added, ‘No crucifix in the living room, no gold cross dangling round my neck, but I’m a Catholic and my faith is important to me. I’m up before six in the morning, so I can be at seven o’clock mass and not be late for work. My Dad and Mum were the same. Until Dad fell into the hold of a ship and smashed his legs and spent the rest of his days in the wheelchair. After that she took him to a later mass. Back in Poland both my mother’s brothers are priests. I wasn’t brainy enough for the priesthood but my faith is strong.’ He smiled. I suppose by now he knew how surprising such announcements could be to people who thought of him as a cockney capitalist who would bow only before Mammon. ‘It will be easier for me here. I’ll go to mass at Farm Street. I am Jesuitical . . .’ He smiled. ‘Always have been. And it’s only a few steps along the road. It’s a wonderful little church and I’ll get an extra few minutes in bed every morning.’ He smiled artfully but I couldn’t imagine anyone for whom an extra few minutes in bed would make so little difference."|"Mexico Set"|"Len Deighton"

"< 00:00"|"before midnight"|"I got home before midnight, having spent a pleasant evening dining with George. He’d gone on about what he described as exactly the right car for me: ‘Shabby appearance but a lot of poke under the bonnet.’ Was that what George felt about me, or subconscious reflections upon his own shortcomings?"|"Mexico Set"|"Len Deighton"
"ap 11:45"|11.45|"The doorbell rang. 11.45. My God, but they took their time. There had been no sound of a motorcycle, and that was unusual for deliveries at this time of night.

But stay in the cab. Arrive at nine o’clock. The time might change if the plane is late. Phone the number I gave you between six and seven to confirm. Whoever answers will give a time but no place. That means Garibaldi Square. No baggage. Wear something that won’t look too conspicuous in England.’"|"Mexico Set"|"Len Deighton"

At first I thought it was just a disturbed dream, but then the bright patch of light flashed across the ceiling again and I heard the diesel engine. It never struck me that it might be Paul Biedermann or any of the family coming home. I knew instinctively that there was danger."|"Mexico Set"|"Len Deighton"
