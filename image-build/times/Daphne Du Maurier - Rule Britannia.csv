"ap > 07:00"|"a few minutes after seven"|"Emma looked at her bedside clock—it was a few minutes after seven—and then switched on her radio to the local station. But there was no time signal, no announcer with the news, nothing but an interminable hum that must mean there was a fault somewhere, and it wasn’t any better when she tried the national program. The hum persisted, with crackling and spitting thrown in for good measure. “Oh, to hell with it!” She pushed the transistor aside and lay back on her pillow, her hands behind her head, transposing “To be or not to be” from Hamlet into a critical assessment of her own ambivalent life. To leave or not to leave, that is the question; whether ’tis nobler to continue living, sharing Mad’s life, her home, her whole existence, or to break here and now with all dominion, cut myself loose, start on a separate road…"|"Rule Britannia"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 06:00"|six|"“What’s going on?” she said to Emma. “The blessed things don’t give one a moment’s peace. I didn’t need my alarm clock this morning. It was one long throb-throb before six. They ought to have more consideration for the general public.”"|"Rule Britannia"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 09:35"|9:35|"“Just that,” said Mad dryly. “Go and make me a cup of coffee, and tell Dottie to carry on with breakfast. It’s exactly 9:35. If that man knew what he was talking about, there may be some announcement at ten o’clock. Switch the radio on in the kitchen, just before the hour. I’ll do the same with the television. If there’s anything doing I’ll give you and the boys a shout. This is something we’ve all got to share, children and adults alike.”"|"Rule Britannia"|"Daphne Du Maurier"

"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"“Mad thinks there will be some announcement at ten o’clock,” she said. “The soldier who brought Sam back told her to keep tuned in. He said there was a state of emergency throughout the country, and everyone has got to stay indoors.”"|"Rule Britannia"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"“No,” said Emma, “no…” Terry stared at her defiantly, then stuck his hands in his jeans pockets and kicked at the leg of the kitchen table. But before he could start arguing the music on the radio ceased and a voice said, “In a few moments, after the time signal at ten o’clock, there will be an important announcement.”"|"Rule Britannia"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
00:00|midnight|"“Good day to you all,” said Admiral Jollif. His tone was grave, but not unduly so, and at least it must mean, thought Dottie, that Buckingham Palace had not been bombed and the dear Queen was safe. “It is my duty to inform you,” he continued, “that since midnight the country has been placed in a state of emergency. Measures have been taken throughout the United Kingdom to ensure the safety of all members of the community, and to maintain power supplies and essential services. There will be no postal services, however, and after midnight trains will not be running for at least twenty-four hours, possibly longer. Telephone switchboards will be manned only for emergency calls. Except for those engaged upon essential work, everyone is instructed to stay at home until further notice, or to return there immediately if they have already left for work, or for any other purpose."|"Rule Britannia"|"Daphne Du Maurier"

"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"“There was nothing on the one o’clock news,” Emma said. “Just a repeat of that statement by the Admiral, so we switched to the news from London and it was the same. Only this time the statement was made by the Commander-in-Chief Land Forces, General Something. Slightly different wording, but otherwise unchanged.”"|"Rule Britannia"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
06:00|"6 a.m."|"Lieutenant Sherman stroked his chin. “Well now,” he replied, “as to your first question, yes, your telephone should be working normally from 6 a.m. onwards. As to the second… I fear I’ve not been briefed. But I rather think your schools will remain closed until next week.”"|"Rule Britannia"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"“There’s notices posted round the town. Meeting at town hall seven o’clock. Questions from the general public to be answered by our Member and this Yankee colonel who’s in charge.”"|"Rule Britannia"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"“The reason I telephoned,” he said, and his voice was lower than before, “is that I’ve just been listening to the seven o’clock local news. There was quite a bit about the scuffle last night between our local lads and the marines. The marines set up these roadblocks everywhere, and it seems they’ve taken a number of lads into custody, but they don’t say where. I’m only hoping your Terry isn’t among them.”"|"Rule Britannia"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"“I wouldn’t have your grandmother worried for the world, but if she listens to the radio it’s bound to be repeated at eight o’clock. Peggy will bring your car round for you. One of my heifers has gone sick and I have to see to her. We’ll keep hoping Terry will turn up.”"|"Rule Britannia"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"Emma replaced the receiver. Mad would be bound to turn on her radio at eight o’clock, and then what? Supposing the marines had picked up Terry, what would they do to him? She went upstairs to her bedroom, dressed hurriedly, and then ran down and out into the garden to tell Joe. He threw down his hoe."|"Rule Britannia"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"“I tried the police first,” she said, “after I heard the eight o’clock news. They don’t have any information. I asked how one could get in touch with the U.S. Commander. They gave me a number, which I rang, and the American voice that answered said the Commander was taking no calls himself, and if there was anything I wanted to know, would I apply in person or in writing. So I’m trying Jimmy Jollif. He at least will give me some advice.”"|"Rule Britannia"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"Emma and Sam threaded their way through the wood and up to the plowed field above, and so home. It was still blowing hard, and raining too. They shed their boots and raincoats in the porch, and Emma heard the dining room clock strike eleven. So much had happened since Jack Trembath had telephoned around seven, half the day seemed to have gone already. The television was on in the library, an unusual thing for Mad—it must be she wanted to hear the latest news bulletin. Her grandmother was standing in front of the set, and when Emma appeared she switched it off."|"Rule Britannia"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’ clock"|"“Following the explosions in the Falmouth area, there have been two more, one near Camborne and a second in the clay district, a mile from Nanpean. Other disturbances have been reported from South Wales. It is believed that Celtic factions among the population are taking this opportunity of giving vent to their dissatisfaction with the Coalition Government and the formation of USUK. Elsewhere the country is quiet. The President of the United States—I beg your pardon, of USUK—gave a dinner party and reception for Her Majesty the Queen at the White House last night… Football. The match between Exeter University and Plymouth has been postponed owing to weather conditions. The next news bulletin from the southwest will be at three o’ clock.”"|"Rule Britannia"|"Daphne Du Maurier"

"ap 03:30"|"half-past three"|"They stood there side by side staring down. Joe did not let go of her hand. The arrow’s jagged tip must have pierced some vital point behind the corporal’s right eye, because part of the eye lolled out, horribly, and the blood that had flowed at first was now congealed. Neither of them spoke. Emma tried to remember when it was that Myrtle had telephoned. Was it half-past three, was it four? Corporal Wagg had been on his way, having already left the farm. He might have wandered about the fields first, he might have gone onto the main road from the farm track and then cut back. He was off duty. Time was no object."|"Rule Britannia"|"Daphne Du Maurier"

Has Bevil Summers been again?” Pa never waited for one to answer his questions. He was always on to the next before you could frame your reply. He was lugging his bag from the back seat as he spoke. “Where’s Joe?” he asked. “Will he put away the car? I want a drink, I’m dying for a drink, I must have a bath too before eating. How’s Dottie, is she in good form? Those horrible children won’t be feeding with us, will they?”"|"Rule Britannia"|"Daphne Du Maurier"

"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"“I wonder.” Mad turned from the window. “What’s the betting they’re all sitting huddled over the calor-gas stoves in the caravans they’ve commandeered?

We had a lovely silent hour, he even went to sleep in the chair while I held my breath, and then the telephone rang, his damn secretary from London. Don’t ask me what it’s all about. Zurich… New York… I’m not sure he didn’t even say Brazil. Anyway, he’s got to get back to London right away.”"|"Rule Britannia"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
12:00|midday|"The eardrum-splitting crashes that came from the basement throughout the day only served to reinforce Mad’s faith in the eldest of her adopted brood and his apparently willing henchman, as they chipped and smashed at the concrete surround to the old well in the cellar. Folly, her sense of hearing rudely awakened, limped from the most comfortable chair in the library overhead and with a senile whine of protest gave tongue at the top of the basement stairs. Ben, surfeited with a midday diet of sausages, fell asleep in the playroom on top of his own small sack of fir cones, and by the time his companions returned from school—no Jesus talk today, no think-in, to Andy’s relief but Colin’s disappointment—Joe and Terry had not only uncovered the old well but had drawn to the surface three buckets of crystal clear water."|"Rule Britannia"|"Daphne Du Maurier"

This is official—Jack Trembath had it straight from one of his farmer friends, whose daughter works in the telephone exchange. So… the screws are on, or whatever the expression is. Just Poldrea, mark you. We are the scapegoats. I think they, and by “they” I mean the marines, imagine that by doing this to the neighborhood somebody is going to turn informer and come clean about the dead corporal. The guilty person will be caught and punished, the informer recompensed, and the scapegoat community revert to normal, or as normal as USUK allows us to be.”"|"Rule Britannia"|"Daphne Du Maurier"

"ap 05:30"|"half-past five"|"She hoped her grandmother would forget what Sam had said, but her hope was in vain. They busied themselves all afternoon with sawing and wood-gathering, for most of the cooking was now being done by a reluctant Dottie on the music room fire, as slates were starting to fall inexplicably into the old grate in the basement, and the music room fireplace devoured fuel like a hungry furnace. It must have been half-past five, and the boys were installed in the kitchen munching Dottie’s home-baked bread, when Mad, whom nothing seemed to tire, turned to Emma in the library and said, “Do you suppose they’ve finished milking yet?”"|"Rule Britannia"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"“In that case,” said Mad, “let’s you and I slip down to Taffy’s hut and see if he is there, and if he is we can hear the six o’clock news.”"|"Rule Britannia"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"Emma looked closely at her grandmother. It wasn’t the six o’clock news she wanted to hear; it was because of the chance, the slim chance, that Mr. Willis might know something, have heard a whisper, that would bring a ray of hope about Joe, about Terry. The good humor, the energy, the joking with the younger ones, was all a bluff. More than Dottie, more than Emma, Mad herself was worried sick about her boys."|"Rule Britannia"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"“The U.S. forces here locally, and wherever else they’ve established themselves,” said Mr. Willis. “The Coalition Government up at Whitehall will have to think again, or they’ll find the population of this country splitting into sections.

"ap < 06:00"|"just before six"|"He climbed down from his bed and switched on the set. It was just before six. They heard the weather report and the time signal. Then the regional announcer, after a momentary hesitation, said there had been a few minor disturbances throughout the west country, chiefly among the farming community, but that the situation was well under control. He then passed on to the news they had already heard at lunch."|"Rule Britannia"|"Daphne Du Maurier"

"ap > 03:00"|"just after three"|"She glanced at her watch. It had stopped just after three, she had forgotten to wind it. The light was gray, seeping in through the small basement windows. It must be seven, perhaps later. Ben, fumbling with his brief shorts, looked enquiringly at her. She put her fingers to her lips. It didn’t matter about the boys, but Mad and Dottie must sleep on. Ben grinned, and scrambling to the far end of the cellar made water onto a pile of logs. This is what we shall all be doing, she thought, if it continues, if the rumbles in the distance never cease, for, although the house no longer shook, somewhere, higher than it had been during the night, aircraft were flying, but in what direction, whether inland or out to sea, it was impossible to tell."|"Rule Britannia"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"Two sounds greeted her as she entered the hall. Normal sounds, belonging to the everyday world that seemed to have been absent for so long. One was the television, which the boys had switched on in the library. The other was the telephone. She decided for the television because it must be just on eight and with luck the announcer would be reading the local news. “Hurry,” shouted Andy. “It was a sub, Mr. Willis was right.” She went and stood beside them, first of all drawing the curtains to let in light and air, and there was the young announcer, looking a bit paler than usual and wearing his terrible purple tie, and he was saying, “… Depth charges were dropped and the combined forces of USUK were put on the alert, but no statement has been issued from joint high command, and it is not yet known whether a submarine was in fact involved and, if so, whether it was identified. It is now reported, but this again has not yet been confirmed, that the explosion which destroyed the U.S. vessel some days ago at anchor in Poldrea bay with severe loss of life may also have been caused by torpedo action. In any event, the recent security regulations affecting the local population have now been relaxed, and the marine commandos have relinquished the port and beach of Poldrea for the time being and handed them back to the local authorities, who state that it may be a few days before things return to normal.” He looked down at a piece of paper in his hand. “A Cabinet meeting will be held in Downing Street this morning. It is understood there is some conflict of opinion among members regarding policy in general and the future of USUK. There will be a further bulletin at nine o’clock.”"|"Rule Britannia"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
