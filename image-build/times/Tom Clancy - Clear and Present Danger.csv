     his legs were telling him about every meter.  Fatigue, he was learning again, was a cumulative factor.  It took more than one day's rest to slough off all of its effects, no matter what sort of shape you were in.  He wondered if the altitude wasn't also to blame.  In any case he was still fighting to keep up the pace, to keep alert, to remember the path he was supposed to follow.  Infantry operations are far more demanding intellectually than most people realize, and intellect is ever the first victim of fatigue."|"Clear and Present Danger"|"Tom Clancy"
