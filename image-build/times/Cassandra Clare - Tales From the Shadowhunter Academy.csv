07:00|"seven in the morning"|"Mostly. Then there were mornings like the ones this week, which were all bluster. Winds with little fishhooks at the end of every gust. Cold that got inside the clothes. Shadowhunter gear, while practical, wasn’t necessarily very warm. It was light, easy to move in, like fighting gear should be. It was not made for standing outside on a boggy stretch at seven in the morning when the sun was barely up. Simon thought of his puffy jacket from home, and his bed, and heating in general. Breakfast, which had been a glue substitute under the banner of porridge, sat heavily in his stomach."|"Tales From the Shadowhunter Academy"|"Cassandra Clare"
22:00|"ten at night"|"The long, long London summer days that Tessa was still getting used to, even after several years, were now starting to shorten rather rapidly. No more sunlight at ten at night—now the night was gathering at six, and the fog was heavy, and faintly yellow, and it pressed against the windows. Bridget had drawn the curtains, and the rooms were dim but cozy."|"Tales From the Shadowhunter Academy"|"Cassandra Clare"
01:00|"one in the morning"|"“This is right off of Berner Street, you see? This was Elizabeth Stride, and she was found at one in the morning. Similar injuries, but seemingly incomplete. Just forty-five minutes later, the body of Catherine Eddowes is found in Mitre Square.”"|"Tales From the Shadowhunter Academy"|"Cassandra Clare"
"~ 15:00"|"around three in the afternoon"|"It had gotten dark outside, even though it was only around three in the afternoon. The hall had gotten considerably colder as the sun had faded, and all of the students were hunkered down in the seats, arms wrapped around themselves to keep warm, but utterly alert. Tessa had been talking for some time, showing maps of London, describing truly horrific murders. It was the kind of thing that kept you awake."|"Tales From the Shadowhunter Academy"|"Cassandra Clare"
02:30|"two thirty in the morning"|"While Tessa took the clothes and changed herself into the form of Abberline, Will filled her in on a few more facts he had gotten from people in the street. Mary Kelly was probably last seen at two thirty in the morning, but one person claimed to have seen her as late as eight thirty. No matter what, whatever had killed her had probably long since vanished."|"Tales From the Shadowhunter Academy"|"Cassandra Clare"
00:00|midnight|"Robert Lightwood stretched out on the quad, trying not to think about how he’d spent this week the year before. The days after exams and before the summer break were, traditionally, a bacchic release of pent-up energy, faculty looking the other way as students pushed the Academy rules to their limits. A year ago, he and Michael Wayland had snuck off campus and taken a boldly illicit midnight skinny-dip in Lake Lyn. Even with their lips firmly sealed shut, the water had taken its hallucinogenic effect, turning the sky electric. They had lain on their backs side by side, imagining falling stars carving neon tracks across the clouds and dreaming themselves into a stranger world."|"Tales From the Shadowhunter Academy"|"Cassandra Clare"
00:00|midnight|"“No one has ever accused my father of being fun,” Isabelle said flatly. “But I assume my reputation precedes me. If you meet me here at midnight tomorrow, I’ll show you what you’ve been missing.” She took Jon’s hand in her own and allowed him to pull her off the couch. “Now. Will you show me to my room? This place is simply impossible to navigate.”"|"Tales From the Shadowhunter Academy"|"Cassandra Clare"
"ap 00:00"|twelve|"At twelve Robert had been scrawny but sure-footed, quick for his age, strong for his size, sure of the Shadowhunting glory that awaited him. As his extended family looked on, his father carefully traced the Voyance rune across Robert’s hand."|"Tales From the Shadowhunter Academy"|"Cassandra Clare"
"< 05:00"|"nearly five a.m."|"“What’s wrong? What’s wrong is it’s nearly five a.m. and Julie and the others are still off somewhere with your stupid girlfriend and what do you think is going to happen if they don’t come back before the morning lecture starts and who knows what could have happened to them out there?”"|"Tales From the Shadowhunter Academy"|"Cassandra Clare"
21:00|"Nine p.m."|"Isabelle brushed past Simon on his way out of the lecture.
“Nine p.m., Jon’s room,” she whispered in his ear.
“What?” It was like she was informing him of the exact time and place of his death—which, if he was forced to imagine what she might be doing in Jon Cartwright’s dorm room, would be imminent."|"Tales From the Shadowhunter Academy"|"Cassandra Clare"
00:00|midnight|"It was midnight before Magnus got all of the Lightwoods out of their suite. Isabelle had left to see Simon some time before, and Clary and Jace could usually be persuaded to go off together, but for a while he thought he was actually going to have to use magic on Maryse and Robert. He shoved them out of the door while they were still giving him helpful baby tips."|"Tales From the Shadowhunter Academy"|"Cassandra Clare"
23:00|"eleven p.m."|"“It’s eleven p.m., Simon,” Clary said. “You know she’s still awake. And even if she’s not, you know—”"|"Tales From the Shadowhunter Academy"|"Cassandra Clare"
00:00|midnight|"Of course, the thing about dating a superhero was that you couldn’t exactly ask them to take a break from saving the world just because you were in the mood for a last-minute date. So Simon kept walking, soaking in the rhythm of the midnight city, letting his mind wander as aimlessly as his feet. At least, he thought he was wandering aimlessly, until he found himself on a familiar block of Avenue D, passing a bodega where the milk was always sour but the guy behind the counter would give you free coffee with your morning doughnut, if you knew enough to ask."|"Tales From the Shadowhunter Academy"|"Cassandra Clare"
