11:00|"11 a.m."|"Dr Craik applied some cantharides (a preparation of dried beetles) to his throat. When this did not have any effect, he opted to bleed the General and removed another half a litre of blood. At 11 a.m. he removed a similar amount again. The average human body contains only 5 litres of blood, so a significant fraction was being bled from Washington at each session. Dr Craik did not seem concerned. He performed venesection again in the afternoon, removing a further whole litre of blood."|"Trick or Treatment_"|"Simon Singh"
"ap < 10:00"|"a few minutes to ten"|"As the night advanced it became evident that he was sinking, and he seemed fully aware that ‘his hour was nigh’. He inquired the time, and was answered a few minutes to ten. He spoke no more – the hand of death was upon him, and he was conscious that ‘his hour was come’. With surprising self-possession he prepared to die. Composing his form at length and folding his arms on his bosom, without a sigh, without a groan, the Father of his Country died. No pang or struggle told when the noble spirit took its noiseless flight; while so tranquil appeared the manly features in the repose of death, that some moments had passed ere those around could believe that the patriarch was no more."|"Trick or Treatment_"|"Simon Singh"
"ap 01:00"|100|"For example, homeopathic strengths of 30C are common, which means that the original ingredient has been diluted 30 times by a factor of 100 each time. Therefore, the original substance has been diluted by a factor of 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. This string of noughts might not mean much, but bear in mind that one gram of the mother tincture contains less than 1,00 0,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 molecules. As indicated by the number of noughts, the degree of dilution is vastly bigger than the number of molecules in the mother tincture, which means that there are simply not enough molecules to go round. The bottom line is that this level of dilution is so extreme that the resulting solution is unlikely to contain a single molecule of the original ingredient. In fact, the chance of having one molecule of the active ingredient in the final 30C remedy is one in a billion billion billion billion. In other words, a 30C homeopathic remedy is almost certain to contain nothing more than water. This point is graphically explained in Figure 2. Again, this underlines the difference between herbal and homeopathic remedies – herbal remedies will always have at least a small amount of active ingredient, whereas homeopathic remedies usually contain no active ingredient whatsoever."|"Trick or Treatment_"|"Simon Singh"
"ap 01:20"|120|"On the other hand, there have been occasional papers that claim to replicate the sort of effects observed by Benveniste, but so far none of them has consistently or convincingly presented the sort of evidence that would posthumously vindicate the Frenchman. In 1999, Dr Andrew Vickers looked at 120 research papers related to Benveniste’s work and other types of basic research into the actions of homeopathic remedies. At the time, he was based at the Royal London Homoeopathic Hospital, so he was certainly open-minded about the potential of homeopathy. Yet Vickers was struck by the failure of independent scientists to replicate any homeopathic effect: ‘In the few instances where a research team has set out to replicate the work of another, either the results were negative or the methodology was questionable.’ Independent replication is a vital part of how science progresses. One single set of experiments can be wrong for a range of reasons, such as lack of rigour, fraud or just bad luck, so independent replication is a way of checking (and re-checking) that the original discovery is genuine. Benveniste’s research had failed this test."|"Trick or Treatment_"|"Simon Singh"
"ap 02:40"|"third of three"|"The hallmark treatment of the chiropractor is a range of techniques known as spinal manipulation, which is intended to realign the spine in order to restore the mobility of joints. Chiropractors also call this an adjustment. It can be a fairly aggressive technique, which pushes the joint slightly beyond what it is ordinarily capable of achieving. One way to think about spinal manipulation is as the third of three levels of flexibility that can be achieved by a joint. The first level of flexibility is that which is possible with only voluntary movement. A second and higher level of flexibility can be achieved by exerting an external force, which pushes the joint until there is resistance. The third level of flexibility, which corresponds to spinal manipulation, involves a thrusting force that pushes the joint even further. The chiropractor will submit the vertebrae of the spine to this third level of motion by using a technique called high-velocity, low-amplitude thrust. This means that the chiropractor exerts a relatively strong force in order to move the joint at speed, but the extent of the motion needs to be limited, because otherwise there would be damage to the joint and its surrounding structures. Although spinal manipulation is often associated with a cracking sound, this is not a result of the bones crunching against each other or a sign that bones are being put back in their right place. Instead, the noise is caused by the release and popping of gas bubbles, which are generated when the fluid in the joint space is put under severe stress."|"Trick or Treatment_"|"Simon Singh"
