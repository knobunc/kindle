11:00|"11 a.m."|"Dr Craik applied some cantharides (a preparation of dried beetles) to his throat. When this did not have any effect, he opted to bleed the General and removed another half a litre of blood. At 11 a.m. he removed a similar amount again. The average human body contains only 5 litres of blood, so a significant fraction was being bled from Washington at each session. Dr Craik did not seem concerned. He performed venesection again in the afternoon, removing a further whole litre of blood."|"Trick or Treatment_"|"Simon Singh"
"ap < 10:00"|"a few minutes to ten"|"As the night advanced it became evident that he was sinking, and he seemed fully aware that ‘his hour was nigh’. He inquired the time, and was answered a few minutes to ten. He spoke no more – the hand of death was upon him, and he was conscious that ‘his hour was come’. With surprising self-possession he prepared to die. Composing his form at length and folding his arms on his bosom, without a sigh, without a groan, the Father of his Country died. No pang or struggle told when the noble spirit took its noiseless flight; while so tranquil appeared the manly features in the repose of death, that some moments had passed ere those around could believe that the patriarch was no more."|"Trick or Treatment_"|"Simon Singh"
"ap 02:40"|"third of three"|"The hallmark treatment of the chiropractor is a range of techniques known as spinal manipulation, which is intended to realign the spine in order to restore the mobility of joints. Chiropractors also call this an adjustment. It can be a fairly aggressive technique, which pushes the joint slightly beyond what it is ordinarily capable of achieving. One way to think about spinal manipulation is as the third of three levels of flexibility that can be achieved by a joint. The first level of flexibility is that which is possible with only voluntary movement. A second and higher level of flexibility can be achieved by exerting an external force, which pushes the joint until there is resistance. The third level of flexibility, which corresponds to spinal manipulation, involves a thrusting force that pushes the joint even further. The chiropractor will submit the vertebrae of the spine to this third level of motion by using a technique called high-velocity, low-amplitude thrust. This means that the chiropractor exerts a relatively strong force in order to move the joint at speed, but the extent of the motion needs to be limited, because otherwise there would be damage to the joint and its surrounding structures. Although spinal manipulation is often associated with a cracking sound, this is not a result of the bones crunching against each other or a sign that bones are being put back in their right place. Instead, the noise is caused by the release and popping of gas bubbles, which are generated when the fluid in the joint space is put under severe stress."|"Trick or Treatment_"|"Simon Singh"
