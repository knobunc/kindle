12:00|noontide|"This ship’s history has, however, prov’d too hectick for its Military Band. The Frigate life is not for ev’ryone,— it seems wherever this one put in, whenever any sailor went over and fail’d to return, he was a Seahorse musician. One by one, thro’ the years of the Rivalry with France, the little Combination dwindl’d,— upon the North American Station, they lost their Inner Voices, halfway thro’ the West Indies their Continuo,— until, home again, the Hautboy-player having been one night absorb’d into that Other World of which Wapping is the anteroom, the Seahorse found herself down to a single Fifer, to whom it fell, the noontide the Frenchman appear’d, to inspire the Lads into battle with his one silver Pipe."|"Mason & Dixon"|"Thomas Pynchon"

It is nearly time for his midday break, and he wants to hurry this up and get to a Tavern. Yet if Mason is acting so unrestrain’d with a Deputy direct from the Castle itself, how much more dangerous may his rattling be in the hearing of others,— even of Slaves? He must therefore be enter’d in the Records as a Person of Interest, thereby taking up residence, in a pen-and-paper way, in the Castle of the Compagnie. Into the same Folder, of course, goes a file for the Assistant,— harmless, indeed, in some Articles, simple, though he appears,— pending the Day when one may have to be set against the other."|"Mason & Dixon"|"Thomas Pynchon"

Ev’ry Midnight the baleful thing is there, crossing directly overhead,— the Yellow Dog. There inverted among the Wires, all but flowing.

For years now, after midnight Culminations, has he himself lain and listen’d to the Sky-Temptress, whispering, Forget the Boys, forget your loyalties to your Dead, first of all to Rebekah, for she, they, are but distractions, temporal, flesh, ever attempting to drag the Uranian Devotee back down out of his realm of pure Mathesis, of that which abides."|"Mason & Dixon"|"Thomas Pynchon"
12:00|Noon|"At first, and then upon re-reading, he could make no more sense of the Letter than Bradley had done. One of Mason’s chores as Assistant was to review just such Correspondence. Since the Longitude Act of 1714, which offer’d Prizes up to twenty thousand Pounds for a reliable way to find the true Longitude at Sea, the Observatory had become a Target for Suggestions, Schemes, Rants, Sermons, full-length Books, all directed to Bradley’s Attention, upon the Problem of the Longitude. Though some were cagy, hinting at Amazing Simplicity and Ingenious Devising, whilst giving no details, most of the letters were all-out philosophick confessions, showing either an unhealthy naïveté, or an inner certainty that the Scheme would never work anyway. For many, it was at least a chance to Rattle at length to a World that was ignoring them. Others were more passionate as to the worth of their Inventions, though employing Arts more of the Actor-Projector than of the Geometer. Occasionally Insanity roll’d a sly Eye-ball into the picture. Treatises on “Para-geography” arriv’d, with alternative Maps of the World superimpos’d upon the more familiar ones. Many,— as had the elder Cabot upon his deathbed,— claim’d to’ve been told the Secrets of the Longitude by God (or, as some preferr’d, Thatwhichever Created Earth and her Rate of Spin). Others told of Rapture by creatures not precisely Angels, nor yet Demons,— styl’d “Agents of Altitude.” That they were taken aloft and shewn the Earth as it appear’d from the Distance of the Sun, and that the Navigator of the Vessel us’d a kind of Micrometer, whose Lines were clapp’d to the Diameter of the Earth, and that the measuring device read 8.75 seconds of Arc, “not in our numbers of course, not until accurately transnumerated, from theirs.— More than happy to share details of this toilsome Conversion, upon duly authorized request.— Yet, as there now exists no further need for a foreign expedition to obtain the Earth’s Solar Parallax from the Transit of Venus, You would oblige me by recalling your own Parties and using what influence you can with Astronomers of other Principalities, as well as among the Jesuits &c.” A retir’d Naval officer wrote from Hampshire of the great Asymmetrick Principle he had discover’d, “an invisible Grain built into Creation, whereby, ’tis less work to rip than to cross-cut, to multiply than to divide, to take the Derivative than the Integral,— and, coming to my Point,— to obtain the Latitude than the Longitude. For the one, we need only know the Sun’s elevation at Noon,— yet from the difficulty of finding the other, enterprizes have founder’d, fleets have perish’d, treasure unreckonable lies beneath th’ indifferent Sea. The solution is simple enough, though lengthier. I have practis’d its Elements from various Quarter-decks, in all conditions from close-reef d to becalm’d,— my Zero Meridian not upon Greenwich, nor Paris, but a certain Himalayan Observatory, in Thibet, the Book of Tables I consult being reduced from Observations made there by the celebrated Dr. Zhang, then, as now, in exile. These are not Lunars, nor yet Galileans, but based upon the very slow Progress of what is undoubtedly a Planet, though no one else claims to’ve seen it, near  Geminorum.”"|"Mason & Dixon"|"Thomas Pynchon"

After they are gone passes a silent period, an enshadowment which, prolonged past a certain point upon the Clock-Face, begins to rouse apprehension among the filles, for they know their Night has begun, and who is coming for them now, and some of what will be done to them. Many who have been to Rooms forbidden the others, report seeing, inside these, a Door to at least one Room further, which may not be opened. The Penetralia of the Lodge are thus, even to those employed there, a region without a map. Anything may be there. Perhaps miracles are still possible,— both evil miracles, such as occur when excesses of Ill Treatment are transform’d to Joy,— quite common in this Era,— and the reverse, when excesses of Well-being at length bring an Anguish no less painful for being metaphysickal,— Good Miracles. Even in a Polity sunny, bustling, and order’d as Cape Town, for reasons that mystify all (some blame the South-East winds, pointing to now-legendary examples of insane behavior in the dry season, whilst others whisper of magickal Practices of the Natives or Malays), howbeit, now and then, Madness will visit by Surprize, taking away to its Realm of Voices and Pain even a mind in the rosiest fullness of Sanity. When they are too dangerous to roam free, the town Madmen are kept as a responsibility of the Company, confin’d in padded rooms in the Slave Lodge. Sometimes for their amusement the Herren will escort a particularly disobedient employee to a Madman’s cell, push her inside, and lock the door. Next to each cell is a Viewing Room where the gentlemen may then observe, through a wall of Glass disguis’d as a great Mirror, the often quite unviewable Rencontre. The Madmen are of every race, condition, and degree of Affliction, from the amiably delusionary to the remorselessly homicidal. Some of them hate women, some desire them, some know hate and desire as but minor aspects of a greater, Oceanick Impulse, in which, report those who survive, it is unquestionably better not to be included. Again, some do not survive. When the Herren cannot return their Remains to their villages, they dispose of them by sea, that the Jackals may not have them."|"Mason & Dixon"|"Thomas Pynchon"

Whereupon, ’twas Mason’s midnight Duty to go in, and open the shutters of the roof, and fearfully recline, to search for her, find her, note her exact location, measure her. On his back. And when she was so close that there could remain no further doubt, how did he hold himself from crying out after the stricken bright Prow of her Face and Hair, out there so alone in the Midnight, unshelter’d, on display to ev’ry ’Gazer with a Lens at his disposal? He could not look too directly . . . as if he fear’d a direct stare from the eyes he fancied he saw, he could but take fugitive Squints, long enough to measure the great Flow of Hair gone white, his thumb and fingers busy with the Micrometer, no time to linger upon Sentiments, not beneath this long Hovering, this undesired Recognition."|"Mason & Dixon"|"Thomas Pynchon"

Smells of wood-smoke, horses, and human sewage blow in the windows, along with the noise.

Smoke from their bright pale pipes hangs like indoor fog, through which, a-glimmering, the heavy crockery and silverware claps and rings. Servant lads in constant motion carry up from the cellar coffee sacks upon their shoulders, or crank the handles of gigantic coffee grinders, as the Assembly clamors for cup after cup of the invigorating Liquid.

(“Aye,” Dixon agrees, “the Planet London. And its principal Moon,” nodding at Mason, “Greenwich.”) The farmer can hear them at midnight, when a whisper will carry a mile, as in the Day-time, conversing like ship-captains through Speaking-Trumpets. Numbers. Words that sound like English but make no sense. Of course he starts finding reasons to go back there and look about. He comes upon the Astronomers scribbling by beeswax light, before a tent pitch’d beneath a wavelike slope in the Earth, a good sledding hill, part field, part woods, this being a region of such mariform grades. They have been bringing the Instrument into the Meridian. “Because of the way Earth spins,” Mason explains, “the Stars travel in Arcs upon the Sky.

I took a few precious Breaths to curse myself for ever settling so close to the limits of Maryland, yet, as I foolishly trusted, south of the Forty-Degree Parallel,— and wagering that the real Susquehanna would prove a more potent Boundary than any invisible Line drawn by Astronomers or Surveyors,— oh, that’s right you’re one of each ain’t you, so sorry,— and that surely no Sheriff of Lancaster would mount the naval Expedition he did. Gawwwd, Boats? There was sailboats and there was rafts, there was Battoes oar’d by match’d twenty-six-man African slave crews, there was even Sailing Ships out there upon broad Susquehanna that night in the dark of the Moon, thirty years ago now, but I’m no closer to forgetting it. For most of the settlers about, in the places they’d come from, troops of Horsemen upon the Roads late at night were far from rare,— but being invaded out of that midnight River, by a small Brigade,— betray’d by me own Bound’ry Line, as ye’d say, taken by total Surprize,— I suppose once in ev’ry lifetime it’s necessary. They descended upon my Land with all the pitilessness of an Army in full Sunlight, and proceeded to build a camp and dig in to obsess us. And ’twas my young Daniel who was Hero of the Battle.”"|"Mason & Dixon"|"Thomas Pynchon"
"> 00:00"|"past Midnight, that Night"|"And so on (records the Revd). This actually very interesting Discussion extended till well past Midnight, that Night. If I did lose full Consciousness now and then, ’twas less from their issueless Bickering, than from the Demands of the Day, as part of the Tribute we must pay, merely to inhabit it."|"Mason & Dixon"|"Thomas Pynchon"
12:00|midday|"“Sooner or later,” Dixon far too brightly, “— a Slave must kill his Master. It is one of the Laws of Springs.” The Herdsman of Humans, who has been staring at Dixon, now looks about for a line of Withdrawal. “Give me Engines, for they have no feelings of injustice,— sometimes they don’t exist, either, so I have to invent what I need . . . ,” at which point the Enterpriser has edg’d his way as far as the door.
“Remember, tomorrow, midday at the Pier!” and he is off like a shot.
Attention shifts to Dixon, whose insane demeanor has vanish’d with the Dealer’s Departure."|"Mason & Dixon"|"Thomas Pynchon"
00:00|midnight|"In ’55, at the grim news of Braddock’s Fate, Pennsylvanians had come flying Eastward before the Indians, over Susquehanna, in a panic,— here in the Chesapeake Slave country, rather stretch’d long nights of Apprehension, the counting of Kitchen Knives, Fears conceal’d, Fears detected, Fears betray’d, of poisons in the food, stranglings at midnight, Women violated, Horses and Cash, House and Home, gone,— as their Spoliators into the boundless Continent,— and everywhere the soft Weight of the nocturnal Breath, above that water-riddl’d Country."|"Mason & Dixon"|"Thomas Pynchon"
"> 00:00"|"after Midnight"|"“Attend me,— nothing would lie beyond our grasp. We would be the King’s Own Astronomers, living in a Palace, servants to obey our desires! Weighty stipends, unlimited Credit! Wenches! Actresses! Observing Suits of gold lamé! Any time, day or night, you wanted,— what do you people eat? Haggis! You want a Haggis after Midnight, all you need do is pull upon a bell-cord, and hi-ho!”"|"Mason & Dixon"|"Thomas Pynchon"
00:00|Midnight|"The Rain has rais’d in ev’ryone an insomniack Apprehension, in which all talk of Bog-bursts is avoided,— yet ’tis but a Question of where the black Flood shall break thro’. The longer it rains, the higher too the level of Nerves and Vapors. No-one here, or for miles, will need to be awaken’d for it. At last, one Midnight,—"|"Mason & Dixon"|"Thomas Pynchon"
00:00|midnight|"In an ordinary Dream, Rebekah appears. “No need to feel pleas’d with yourself. What you found was not their sacred Well, but only a Representation of it.” He wakes up into a midnight sadness, trying to say, I have tasted it, yet he has not tasted it. Now he is afraid ever to, lest his Spring be discover’d as soil’d as the Holy Wells of Gloucestershire, and therefore the Krees, and therefore his Dreams."|"Mason & Dixon"|"Thomas Pynchon"
"> 00:00"|"after Midnight"|"He prays to see her Face in the new Comet,— each night, this time, in terror of not seeing it. He tries to will it there, yet is amaz’d that for some Minutes now, he cannot even remember her Face. Yet at last arrives a clear night of seeing, so clear in fact that sometime after Midnight, supine in the Star-light, rigid with fear, Mason experiences a curious optical re-adjustment. The Stars no longer spread as upon a Dom’d Surface,— he now beholds them in the Third Dimension as well,— the Eye creating its own Zed-Axis, along which the star-chok’d depths near and far rush both inward and away, and soon, quite soon, billowing out of control. He collects that the Heavenly Dome has been put there as Protection, in an agreement among Observers to report only what it is safe to see. Fifteen years in the Business, and here is his Initiation."|"Mason & Dixon"|"Thomas Pynchon"
00:00|Midnight|"When the Hook of Night is well set, and when all the Children are at last irretrievably detain’d within their Dreams, slowly into the Room begin to walk the Black servants, the Indian poor, the Irish runaways, the Chinese Sailors, the overflow’d from the mad Hospital, all unchosen Philadelphia,— as if something outside, beyond the cold Wind, has driven them to this extreme of seeking refuge. They bring their Scars, their Pox-pitted Cheeks, their Burdens and Losses, their feverish Eyes, their proud fellowship in a Mobility that is to be, whose shape none inside this House may know. Lomax wakes, sweating, from a poison’d Dream. Euphrenia has ascended the back Stairs, as the former Zab Cherrycoke those in front, to Slumber. Ethelmer and DePugh, Brae and the Twins, have all vanish’d back into the Innocence of Unconsciousness now. Ives is off at his Midnight Junto,— yet Mr. LeSpark and the Revd remain. The Room continues to fill up, the Dawn not to arrive."|"Mason & Dixon"|"Thomas Pynchon"
