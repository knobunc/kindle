I think winter-time would have weighed less on our spirits: the drawn curtains, and the bright lamps, and the companionable fires would have helped us. We were only five in the house altogether – after having once been so many! I can’t tell you how dreary the grey daylight looked, towards seven o’clock, in the lonely rooms, and on the noiseless staircase. Surely, the prejudice in favour of long summer evenings, is the prejudice of happy people? We did our best. We kept ourselves employed, and Miss Garth helped us. The prospect of preparing for our departure, which had seemed so dreadful earlier in the day, altered into the prospect of a refuge from ourselves, as the evening came on. We each tried at first to pack up in our own rooms – but the loneliness was more than we could bear. We carried all our possessions downstairs, and heaped them on the large dining-table, and so made our preparations together, in the same room. I am sure we have taken nothing away which does not properly belong to us."|"No Name"|"Wilkie Collins"

The few attempts he made to vary the sternly practical nature of the evening’s occupation by slipping in compliments sidelong, she put away from her with the contemptuous self-possession of a woman of twice her age. She literally forced him into his part. Her father fell asleep in his chair. Mrs Vanstone and Miss Garth lost their interest in the proceedings, retired to the farther end of the room, and spoke together in whispers. It grew later and later; and still Magdalen never flinched from her task – still, with equal perseverance, Norah, who had been on the watch all through the evening, kept on the watch to the end. The distrust darkened and darkened on her face as she looked at her sister and Frank; as she saw how close they sat together, devoted to the same interest and working to the same end. The clock on the mantelpiece pointed to half-past eleven, before Lucy the resolute, permitted Falkland the helpless to shut up his task-book for the night. ‘She’s wonderfully clever, isn’t she?’ said Frank, taking leave of Mr Vanstone at the hall-door. ‘I’m to come tomorrow, and hear more of her views – if you have no objection. I shall never do it; don’t tell her I said so. As fast as she teaches me one speech, the other goes out of my head. Discouraging, isn’t it? Good night.’"|"No Name"|"Wilkie Collins"

At a private interview with Miss Garth, she had referred again, of her own accord, to the subject of her letter from London – had spoken self-reproachfully of her weakness in admitting Captain Wragge’s impudent claim to a family connection with her – and had then reverted to the state of her health, and to the doubtful prospect that awaited her in the coming summer, in a tone of despondency which it was very distressing to hear. Anxious to cheer her spirits, Miss Garth had changed the conversation as soon as possible – had referred to the approaching theatrical performance – and had relieved Mrs Vanstone’s mind of all anxiety in that direction, by announcing her intention of accompanying Magdalen to each rehearsal, and of not losing sight of her until she was safely back again in her father’s house. Accordingly, when Frank presented himself at Combe-Raven on the eventful morning, there stood Miss Garth, prepared – in the interpolated character of Argus1 – to accompany Lucy and Falkland to the scene of trial.

‘In the shrubbery at ten?’ asked Frank in a whisper.
She drew up the hood of her cloak, and nodded to him gaily. Miss Garth, standing near, noticed the looks that passed between them, though the disturbance made by the parting guests prevented her from hearing the words. There was a soft, underlying tenderness in Magdalen’s assumed gaiety of manner – there was a sudden thoughtfulness in her face, a confidential readiness in her hand, as she took Frank’s arm and went out to the carriage. What did it mean? Had her passing interest in him, as her stage-pupil, treacherously sown the seeds of any deeper interest in him, as a man? Had the idle theatrical scheme, now that it was all over, graver results to answer for than a mischievous waste of time?"|"No Name"|"Wilkie Collins"

Surely I had an engagement for Saturday afternoon?’ He consulted his pocket-book, and read over one of the entries, with a look of annoyance. ‘Grailsea Mill, three o’clock, Saturday. Just the time when Pendril will be here; and I must be at home to see him. How can I manage it? Monday will be too late for my business at Grailsea. I’ll go to-day, instead; and take my chance of catching the miller at his dinnertime.’ He looked at his watch. ‘No time for driving; I must do it by railway.

She was too restless to lie still, and sleep. For a moment, she directed her steps towards the portico – then turned, and looked about her, doubtful where to go, or what to do next. While she was still hesitating, the half-open door of her husband’s study attracted her attention. The room seemed to be in sad confusion. Drawers were left open; coats and hats, account-books and papers, pipes and fishing-rods were all scattered about together. She went in, and pushed the door to – but so gently that she still left it ajar. ‘It will amuse me to put his room to rights,’ she thought to herself. ‘I should like to do something for him, before I am down on my bed helpless.’ She began to arrange his drawers; and found his banker’s book lying open in one of them. ‘My poor dear, how careless he is! The servants might have seen all his affairs, if I had not happened to have looked in.’ She set the drawers right; and then turned to the multifarious litter on a side table. A little old-fashioned music-book appeared among the scattered papers, with her name written in it, in faded ink. She blushed like a young girl in the first happiness of the discovery. ‘How good he is to me! He remembers my poor old music-book, and keeps it for my sake.’ As she sat down by the table and opened the book, the bygone time came back to her in all its tenderness. The clock struck the half-hour, struck the three-quarters – and still she sat there, with the music-book on her lap, dreaming happily over the old songs; thinking gratefully of the golden days when his hand had turned the pages for her, when his voice had whispered the words which no woman’s memory ever forgets."|"No Name"|"Wilkie Collins"

She delayed her return to the mother’s bedside to say her parting words of comfort to the daughters, before she left them for the night. Norah’s room was the nearest. She softly opened the door and looked in. The kneeling figure by the bedside, told her that God’s help had found the fatherless daughter in her affliction.

Cabs rattled by him over the bridge on their way to meet the train from London, at twenty minutes to six. After a moment’s hesitation, the captain sauntered after the cabs. When it is one of a man’s regular habits to live upon his fellow-creatures, that man is always more or less fond of haunting large railway stations.

It was then twenty minutes to seven. The sun had set more than half an hour since; the red light lay broad and low in the cloudless western heaven; all visible objects were softening in the tender twilight, but were not darkening yet.

If she is, her friends may whistle for her. If she isn’t, I have only to keep her till the bills are posted.’ Fortified by this simple plan of action, the captain returned to the charge; and politely placed Magdalen between the two inevitable alternatives of trusting herself to him, on the one hand, or of returning to her friends, on the other."|"No Name"|"Wilkie Collins"

"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"The captain’s first inquiry, after hearing this message, referred to Magdalen. ‘Where was Miss Bygrave?’ ‘In her own room.’ ‘Where was Mrs Bygrave?’ ‘In the back parlour.’ Captain Wragge turned his steps at once in the latter direction; and found his wife, for the second time, in tears. She had been sent out of Magdalen’s room, for the whole day; and she was at her wits’ end to know what she had done to deserve it. Shortening her lamentations without ceremony, her husband sent her upstairs on the spot; with instructions to knock at the door, and to inquire whether Magdalen could give five minutes’ attention to a question of importance, which must be settled before two o’clock."|"No Name"|"Wilkie Collins"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"Captain Wragge forthwith opened his paper-case, and wrote these lines: – ‘Accept my warmest congratulations on the result of your interview with Mr N. V. He is coming again at two o’clock; no doubt to make his proposals in due form. The question to decide is, whether I shall press him or not on the subject of settlements.1 The considerations for your own mind are two in number. First, whether the said pressure (without at all underrating your influence over him) may not squeeze for a long time, before it squeezes money out of Mr N. V. Secondly, whether we are altogether justified – considering our present position towards a certain sharp practitioner in petticoats – in running the risk of delay. Consider these points, and let me have your decision as soon as convenient.’"|"No Name"|"Wilkie Collins"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"When Mrs Lecount’s master made his appearance at two o’clock, he stood alarmingly in need of an anodyne application from Mrs Lecount’s green fan. The agitation of making his avowal to Magdalen; the terror of finding himself discovered by the housekeeper; the tormenting suspicion of the hard pecuniary conditions which Magdalen’s relative and guardian might impose on him – all these emotions, stirring in conflict together, had overpowered his feebly-working heart with a trial that strained it sorely. He gasped for breath, as he sat down in the parlour at North Shingles; and that ominous bluish pallor which always overspread his face in moments of agitation, now made its warning appearance again. Captain Wragge seized the brandy bottle, in genuine alarm; and forced his visitor to drink a wine-glassful of the spirit, before a word was said between them on either side."|"No Name"|"Wilkie Collins"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"‘I’ll tell you to-morrow,’ said the captain. ‘Go out for your walk alone, and drop in here, as you dropped in to-day, at two o’clock. In the mean time, don’t forget those things I want you to send me. Seal them up together in a large envelope. When you have done that, ask Mrs Lecount to walk out with you as usual; and while she is upstairs putting her bonnet on, send the servant across to me. You understand? Good morning.’"|"No Name"|"Wilkie Collins"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"An hour afterwards, the sealed envelope, with its enclosures, reached Captain Wragge in perfect safety. The double task of exactly imitating a strange handwriting, and accurately copying words written in a language with which he was but slightly acquainted, presented more difficulties to be overcome than the captain had anticipated. It was eleven o’clock before the employment which he had undertaken was successfully completed, and the letter to Zürich ready for the post."|"No Name"|"Wilkie Collins"

Noel Vanstone (after submitting himself to the sine qua non, and destroying the letter) waited anxiously for results; while Mrs Lecount, on her side, watched patiently for events. Towards three o’clock in the afternoon, the carriage appeared again at the gate of North Shingles. Mr Bygrave got out and tripped away briskly to the landlord’s cottage for the key. He returned with the servant at his heels. Miss Bygrave left the carriage; her giant-relative followed her example; the house-door was opened; the trunks were taken off; the carriage disappeared, and the Bygraves were at home again!"|"No Name"|"Wilkie Collins"

"< 12:00"|"Towards noon"|"No letters came that morning. Towards noon the weather changed for the worse, and all idea of walking out as usual was abandoned. Hour after hour, while her master sat in one of the parlours, Mrs Lecount kept watch in the other – with the door into the passage open, and with a full view of North Shingles through the convenient side window at which she had established herself. Not a sign that was suspicious appeared; not a sound that was suspicious caught her ear. As the evening closed in, her master’s hesitation came to an end. He was disgusted with the weather; he hated the place; he foresaw the annoyance of more meetings with Mr Bygrave – and he was determined to go to St Crux the first thing the next morning. Lecount could stay behind to pack up the curiosities and settle with the tradespeople, and could follow him to the admiral’s on the next day. The housekeeper was a little staggered by the tone and manner in which he gave these orders. He had, to her own certain knowledge, effected no communication of any sort with North Shingles – and yet he seemed determined to leave Aldborough at the earliest possible opportunity. For the first time she hesitated in her adherence to her own conclusions. She remembered that her master had complained of the Bygraves, before they returned to Aldborough; and she was conscious that her own incredulity had once already misled her, when the appearance of the travelling carriage at the door had proved even Mr Bygrave himself to be as good as his word."|"No Name"|"Wilkie Collins"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"The next morning she rose at seven o’clock. In half an hour more she saw the punctual Mr Bygrave – as she had seen him on many previous mornings, at the same time – issue from the gate of North Shingles, with his towels under his arm, and make his way to a boat that was waiting for him on the beach. Swimming was one among the many personal accomplishments of which the captain was master. He was rowed out to sea every morning, and took his bath luxuriously in the deep blue water. Mrs Lecount had already computed the time consumed in this recreation by her watch; and had discovered that a full hour usually elapsed, from the moment when he embarked on the beach to the moment when he returned."|"No Name"|"Wilkie Collins"
"ap 00:54"|"Six of one"|"‘There!’ said Mrs Wragge, throwing open the wardrobe, and taking a dress down from one of the pegs. ‘Look there! There’s plaits on her Boasom, and plaits on mine. Six of one, and half a dozen of the other; and mine are the biggest – that’s all!’"|"No Name"|"Wilkie Collins"
12:00|"noon that day"|"Not a word of comment on the disaster of the morning escaped him, when Magdalen returned, and found him at his post. His flow of language seemed at last to have run dry. ‘I told you what Mrs Wragge would do,’ he said – ‘and Mrs Wragge has done it.’ He sat unflinchingly at the window, with a patience which Mrs Lecount herself could not have surpassed. The one active proceeding in which he seemed to think it necessary to engage, was performed by deputy. He sent the servant to the inn to hire a chaise and a fast horse, and to say that he would call himself, before noon that day, and tell the ostler when the vehicle would be wanted. Not a sign of impatience escaped him, until the time drew near for departure of the early coach. Then the captain’s curly lips began to twitch with anxiety, and the captain’s restless fingers beat the devil’s tattoo unremittingly on the window-pane."|"No Name"|"Wilkie Collins"
"< 15:00"|"Towards three o’clock in the afternoon"|"Towards three o’clock in the afternoon, Captain Wragge stopped at the nearest station to Ossory which the railway passed in its course through Essex. Inquiries made on the spot, informed him that he might drive to St Crux, remain there for a quarter of an hour, and return to the station in time for an evening train to London. In ten minutes more, the captain was on the road again, driving rapidly in the direction of the coast."|"No Name"|"Wilkie Collins"
"ap < 09:00"|"Towards nine o’clock"|"By slow degrees, her mind recovered its balance, and she looked her position unflinchingly in the face. The vain hope that accident might defeat the very end for which, of her own free will, she had ceaselessly plotted and toiled, vanished and left her; self-dissipated in its own weakness. She knew the true alternative, and faced it. On one side, was the revolting ordeal of the marriage – on the other, the abandonment of her purpose. Was it too late to choose between the sacrifice of the purpose, and the sacrifice of herself? Yes! too late. The backward path had closed behind her. Time that no wish could change, Time that no prayers could recall, had made her purpose a part of herself: once she had governed it; now it governed her. The more she shrank, the harder she struggled, the more mercilessly it drove her on. No other feeling in her was strong enough to master it – not even the horror that was maddening her; the horror of her marriage.
Towards nine o’clock, she went back to the house.
‘Walking again!’1 said Mrs Wragge, meeting her at the door. ‘Come in and sit down, my dear. How tired you must be!’"|"No Name"|"Wilkie Collins"
00:00|midnight|"The confession in the newspaper had taken a fearful hold on her mind. As she paced the walk, the black night opened over the sea, and showed her the murderer in the field, hurling the Spud of the plough into the air. She ran, shuddering, back to the house. The murderer followed her into the parlour. She seized the candle, and went up into her room. The vision of her own distempered fancy followed her to the place where the laudanum was hidden – and vanished there.
It was midnight; and there was no sign yet of the captain’s return.
She took from the writing-case the long letter which she had written to Norah, and slowly read it through. The letter quieted her. When she reached the blank space left at the end, she hurriedly turned back, and began it over again."|"No Name"|"Wilkie Collins"

The last lines written above the space ran thus:… ‘I have laid my whole heart bare to you; I have hidden nothing. It has come to this. The end I have toiled for, at such terrible cost to myself, is an end which I must reach or the. It is wickedness, madness, what you will – but it is so.

"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"The sea showed it to her. Dimly distinguishable through the mist, she saw a little fleet of coasting vessels slowly drifting towards the house, all following the same direction with the favouring set of the tide. In half an hour – perhaps in less – the fleet would have passed her window. The hands of her watch pointed to four o’clock. She seated herself close at the side of the window, with her back towards the quarter from which the vessels were drifting down on her – with the poison placed on the window-sill, and the watch on her lap. For one half hour to come, she determined to wait there, and count the vessels as they went by. If, in that time, an even number passed her – the sign given, should be a sign to live. If the uneven number prevailed – the end should be Death."|"No Name"|"Wilkie Collins"

It must be a hardy appetite which can contemplate without a momentary discouragement, the battered egg-shell, the fish half-stripped to a skeleton, the crumbs in the plate, and the dregs in the cup. There is surely a wise submission to those weaknesses in human nature which must be respected and not reproved, in the sympathizing rapidity with which servants in places of public refreshment, clear away all signs of the customer in the past, from the eyes of the customer in the present. Although his predecessor may have been the wife of his bosom or the child of his loins, no man can find himself confronted at table by the traces of a vanished eater, without a passing sense of injury in connection with the idea of his own meal."|"No Name"|"Wilkie Collins"

When dinner was over he returned to his comfortable chair before the fire, and Mrs Lecount followed him. He resumed the conversation –  which meant, in his case, repeating his questions.

Mrs Drake happened to be otherwise engaged; and referred her to the head housemaid. The head housemaid happened on that particular morning to be in the same condition as Mrs Drake; and referred her to the under-housemaids. The under-housemaids declared they were all behindhand and had not a minute to spare – they suggested, not too civilly, that old Mazey had nothing on earth to do, and that he knew the house as well, or better than he knew his A B C. Magdalen took the hint, with a secret indignation and contempt which it cost her a hard struggle to conceal. She had suspected, on the previous night, and she was certain now, that the women-servants all incomprehensibly resented her presence among them, with the same sullen unanimity of distrust. Mrs Drake, as she had seen for herself, was really engaged that morning over her accounts.

I shall break down again if I think of it – and I shall think of it, if I lie awake in the dark.’ She had brought a work-box with her to St Crux, as one of the many little things which in her character of a servant it was desirable to possess; and she now opened the box, and applied herself resolutely to work.
