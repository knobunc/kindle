But this flawless afternoon in June knows nothing of them yet: from the dovecot beyond the home orchard floats the drowsiest of all English sounds: the jackdaws wheel to the same lazy tempo above the elm walk; a bell in the distant stables chimes four; Scamnum slumbers. On the hill no tourist, field-glass in hand, disturbs the gently nibbling sheep or speculates on such activity as Scamnum reveals. There is no one to identify as the Duke the little knicker-bockered figure who has paused to speak to a gardener by the lily-pond; no one to recognize in the immaculately breeched and booted youth sauntering up from the stables Noel Yvon Meryon Gylby, a scion of the house; no one to guess that the tall figure strolling down the drive is his old tutor Giles Gott, the eminent Elizabethan scholar, or that the beautiful girl, looking thoughtfully after him from the terrace, is the Lady Elizabeth Crispin. Nobody knows that the restless man with the black box is not a photographer from the Queen but an American philologist. And nobody knows that the Rolls-Royce approaching the south lodge contains the Lord High Chancellor of England, come down to play a prank with his old friend Anne Dillon, the present Duchess of Horton."|"Hamlet, Revenge!"|"Michael Innes"
"ap 07:30"|"half past seven"|"It was half past seven. Noel Gylby sat on the west terrace, dividing his attention between a cocktail, Handley Cross, and his former tutor, who had sat down with a brief ‘Hullo, Noel,’ to stare absently and a shade disapprovingly at the beginnings of a garish sunset."|"Hamlet, Revenge!"|"Michael Innes"
"ap 08:15"|eight-fifteen|"The minute hand of the Dutch bracket-clock dropped to the horizontal of eight-fifteen. Bagot, Scamnum’s venerable butler, appeared through a vista of opening doors. The Duke carried off Mrs Terborg without more ado. Noel, releasing himself from Anna Merkalova an improper moment before that lady was handed over to Bunney, made across the room. He was too late. Mr Piper and Miss Sandys, in unbroken talk, had been waved forward by their hostess. Timothy Tucker and Melville Clay had a Terborg twin apiece. Elizabeth held on to the black man, having to superintend – as Noel, gloomily returning, explained to Gott – the special oriental nosebag, Gott and Noel, with Gervase Crispin and Max Cope, went forward together as momentarily superfluous bachelor familiars of the house. The Duchess followed with Lord Auldearn. ‘Mixed biscuits, Ian,’ she said, ‘and champagne with an “h” in the Reims!’"|"Hamlet, Revenge!"|"Michael Innes"
22:30|"Ten-thirty at night"|"Ten-thirty at night is not a wholly polite hour at which to arrive for a long weekend: explanations, previously offered no doubt by letter, were reiterated now.

Sir Richard Nave had been lecturing to the Society for Improving Sex on ‘The Psychological Basis of Matrilinear Communities’. Professor Malloch had been conducting viva-voce examinations in his native Aberdeen, The Marryats had felt that a week away from London so early would be an experience, but things turned up so that only five days were possible.

The play was to begin at nine o’clock; there was to be one interval only, taken at the end of the second act; it was to be over just before midnight. There was no scenery to change, and few properties to manipulate. Now on one and now on another of the three stage spaces – front stage, rear stage, upper stage – the action would run smoothly forward. As the first scene, ‘The Battlements of Elsinore’, ended on the upper stage, Claudius and his court would enter in procession for Scene Two, ‘The Council Chamber in the Castle’, on the front stage. And as soon as the last characters in this scene had made their exit the curtain of the rear stage would be drawn back, revealing Laertes and Ophelia in Scene Three, ‘A Room in the House of Polonius’. The curtain would no sooner be drawn again on this than Hamlet and his companions would appear ‘aloft’ for the meeting with the Ghost in Scene Four. In this way the play was assured something of the impetus it enjoyed three hundred years ago. An audience accustomed to the constant dropping of a curtain over a proscenium-arch and to a succession of elaborate stage sets might be disconcerted for a time, but they would be seeing Hamlet played in the manner in which Shakespeare himself had played in it."|"Hamlet, Revenge!"|"Michael Innes"

It was the Duke of Horton. He told me that Auldearn had been shot dead on the stage, apparently in circumstances which afford no light on his assailant. That is very extraordinary, but I suppose it may be so. Horton either knew or guessed that public issues might be involved. He said he was holding everybody tight and he begged me to act at once. He particularly asked for somebody who would not be scared by a high and mighty mob; he was referring, no doubt, to the sort of house-party he has down there. When I got hold of Haddon he named you.’ There was a pause. ‘Much may depend on you.’"|"Hamlet, Revenge!"|"Michael Innes"
"ap 00:40"|twelve-forty|"Just at twelve-forty, with some eight miles to go, they met the first car – a large limousine dimly lit within, and with a footman beside the chauffeur. ‘Nobs,’ said Thomas as they flashed past with dipped headlights."|"Hamlet, Revenge!"|"Michael Innes"
"ap 11:35"|"eleven thirty-five"|"There was little to observe. The Duke came back to speak for a few minutes to his mother; he was followed by Gervase and then by Dr Biddle, who had succeeded in walking on as an attendant lord and who now brought the Dowager a drink in his everyday capacity as medical attendant to the family. After he had retired old Max Cope made a slightly disconcerting appearance on the upper stage, surveying the hall placidly, palette in hand, as if nothing whatever had happened. Presently he was joined by Melville Clay – clad in a sombre dressing-gown, as if he kept a stock about him for all emergencies – and led off. A minute later Clay emerged below, crossed the front stage and dropped down beside the Dowager. He sat down and talked quietly, the soothing murmur of his musical voice audible in snatches to the people near by. Then he went away again, returned with Max in tow, set the old man safely down beside the old lady, and disappeared once more. Twice a telephone buzzer could just be heard behind the stage; the murmur of voices there occasionally rose into a half distinguishable phrase. Then at eleven thirty-five the door at the rear of the hall opened and a police sergeant and three constables entered, ushered by Bagot."|"Hamlet, Revenge!"|"Michael Innes"
"ap 11:45"|"eleven forty-five"|"And that was all. That – several people remarked next day, with the changed attitude that the chasm of sleep will bring – was all that the audience got from the violent death of a Lord Chancellor.

For fifteen minutes cups were handed and accepted; sandwiches were handed and either declined as frivolous or consumed as a species of funeral baked meat according to the temperament of the individual.

"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"‘When somebody dies in this way – is shot, murdered – one’s first feeling is not of mystery, but of alarm. One looks round for a maniac brandishing a revolver and threatening further lives. There’s a young man upstairs who might bear that in mind when he next writes up that sort of thing.’ The Duke did not stop to elucidate this. ‘But there was no maniac. My second thought was of robbery, robbery of no common sort. I seized the most reliable fellow beside me and sent him to secure the door behind the audience. There is only one other door – behind the green-room here – and I went straight to that and locked it myself. We had had a telephone put in so that we could communicate easily with the house. I went to it and was through to the Prime Minister by eleven o’clock, within five minutes of the shooting. Then I rang up the local police at Horton. Then somebody suggested that Auldearn’s bedroom should be guarded and I agreed; I was for every precaution. I let my cousin Gervase and the man I’d sent to the farther door – a kinsman of my wife’s – out by this door here and locked it after them. The next important thing was to prevent the audience and the players from mingling. Behind the scenes I had a manageable crowd, and a crowd I could take drastic measures with if necessary. But the audience was a mob and it included one or two diplomatic people; one can’t go through an ambassador’s pockets can one?’"|"Hamlet, Revenge!"|"Michael Innes"
"ap 11:12"|eleven-twelve|"‘At eleven-twelve my cousin Gervase came back from Auldearn’s room and I let him into the hall. He had startling news. The room had been burgled. Professionally it would seem, for the safe had been cracked.’"|"Hamlet, Revenge!"|"Michael Innes"

00:00|midnight|"‘Mr Bose found the document by accident. Just on midnight I became aware of him standing beside me – one never notices him approach – and looking miserable. It occurred to me he wanted to be helpful; he’s a friendly little person enough. So I asked him to find my daughter Elizabeth; I meant to send her forward to my mother, about whom I was a little anxious. He went through the species of curtained corridor you will find behind the rear stage, and in doing so he nearly slipped on something that had apparently rolled off the rear stage itself. It was a little parchment scroll which Polonius was designed to carry throughout the play; part of his stage business was that of referring to it from time to time in a slightly fussy manner. Well, Mr Bose picked it up – and noticed a different coloured paper inside. He is an alert and subtle creature and he brought it to me at once. That is what I meant by saying that it had, in a manner of speaking, been on Auldearn all the time. And at that I let the audience go. If there had been an attempt on the document Auldearn had outwitted it. Perhaps he knew there was to be an attempt. Perhaps the inexplicable messages had warned him.’"|"Hamlet, Revenge!"|"Michael Innes"
"ap ~ 10:55"|"round ten fifty-five"|"The rear stage was simply a large rectangular curtained recess into which one could slip through a parting on any of its sides. But because the single curtain had been found insufficient to deaden green-room noises, further curtains had been hung on the three backstage sides, giving the effect of a corridor with two right-angled turns. This multiplicity of thick and in places overlapping drapery would have given a bold man a chance to slip into hiding unobserved at some favourable moment, and a less substantial chance of so manoeuvring after the shot as to escape discovery. And it seemed that this must, indeed, have happened. Suspicions might yet be reported, but had anything damning been observed there would surely have been denunciations long ago. Diligent ferreting, such as the Duke claimed to have begun, lay ahead if the movements or whereabouts of some thirty people were to be pinned down for the fatal minutes round ten fifty-five."|"Hamlet, Revenge!"|"Michael Innes"

03:00|"three o’clock in the morning"|"‘So then, when we were in town, I used to go to the British Museum sometimes and look things up there. I noticed Mr Bose  the very first time. There are so many queer-looking people in the Reading Room – sandals, you know, and bearded sages in semi-religious robes and muddled women doing Higher Thought – that anybody who is remarkable rather than queer strikes one at once. And, of course, Mr Bose was remarkable. He used to drift about, very shy and looking rather lost. I don’t know what his work was exactly, but I think it was all half mysterious to him – a ritual that would bring him at last to the secret of the astounding and alarming West. One thought of the Reading Room as a temple whenever one looked at him; and – as you will hear – he thought of it as a temple himself.’ The Duchess paused a little dubiously, as if aware of an incongruity in these reminiscences at three o’clock in the morning. ‘But you cannot want all this, really?’"|"Hamlet, Revenge!"|"Michael Innes"
"ap 03:00"|"Three o’clock"|"‘No doubt. Read unvarnished accounts of spy-work and you see that muddle’s it’s middle name. And I have no doubt that if Auldearn were being stalked with the object of theft and then this killing happened, a spy in the audience might jump to the conclusion that his friends had acted a little more vigorously than expected and send off a rash promise from the first callbox. In fact Auldearn’s death may have been, as you say, a private affair and the document never got at all. But I can take no chances. And so, back to your theatre.’ He looked at his watch. ‘Three o’clock.’"|"Hamlet, Revenge!"|"Michael Innes"

12:00|noon|"So Appleby paced the little stage, reviewing a tolerable confusion of materials and planning the morning’s attack upon them. He was interrupted by Sergeant Trumpet, who brought news of difficulty with Scamnum’s awakening domestic staff. You may isolate some two hundred people without much inconvenience during the hours of the night, but in the morning what of the butter, the milk, and the eggs; what of those outdoor servants who came into the servants’ ball for meals; what of the bevy of chauffeurs at the Scamnum Arms who would expect breakfast in the steward’s room; what of the guests, not involved in the play, who would presently be proposing to pack? The last question, obviously, was one for the Duke when he should be available: the others Appleby resolved to turn to the solution of himself. He would hold the blockade rigidly if possible till noon, by which time he should be able to report comprehensively to, and get further instructions from, London. Meantime it was simply a matter of organization; butter and eggs and chauffeurs must come in and nothing must go out. Appleby went in search of Bagot, whom he supposed the fountain-head of authority of Scamnum’s menial affairs."|"Hamlet, Revenge!"|"Michael Innes"
"ap 04:22"|four-twenty-two|"The message, Gott said, had been in typescript on a quarto page of common paper. He had noticed it, a crumpled ball, in a corner of the car a few minutes after getting in and just before drawing up at Scamnum. The chauffeur, Williams, who had looked at the clock on his dashboard on arrival in order to time the run, could name the minute: four-twenty-two. By about four-twenty on the Friday afternoon, then, the message had been in the car. What of an anterior limit? When had it certainly not been in the car? It had not been in the car, Williams could swear, when Lord Auldearn got in outside his London house; had it been there he, Williams, would have spotted it when arranging the rugs. And that had been at two-five. But it might have been tossed in within the next five minutes, when he had gone to his place at the wheel and they were waiting for a stray suitcase to be brought out. Would Lord Auldearn not have noticed it himself if it had been in the car throughout the journey? And would he not have been likely to notice its being tossed in? No, said Williams; his Lordship was distinctly short-sighted and often failed to notice more conspicuous things than a ball of paper. If they had not picked up Mr Gott he would certainly have found it himself sooner or later; probably on handing out to the footmen on arrival. And, of course, he would have given it to his lordship; he would not take the responsibility of destroying what might be of consequence. When one was with a Lord Chancellor – Quite so, said Appleby – and turned to the next point. After starting from town what opportunities would there have been? Williams looked doubtful.

Two-five to two-ten in town was a likely time; two-ten to four-ten on the route was possible but not probable; four-ten at the south lodge was likely again. A suspected person would have to be cleared in relation to these times. Going back to the house, Appleby tried another line. Gott didn’t remember anything special about the text of the message – any sign, say, of its having been taken from a particular edition?

"ap ~ 02:30"|"about two-thirty"|"Appleby turned to the gramophone records and the opportunities of access to the radio-gramophone at about two-thirty on the previous morning. If the records were new there would be some chance of wringing information from them. Neither the carillon nor Clay’s reading from Macbeth would be big-selling recordings and the manufacturing company’s files would show what retailers could usefully be questioned. Appleby sent for the records; they were much scratched disks and both recordings were old. If the Black Hand had bought them when new, the transaction probably lay too far in the past to get any line on. And if he had picked them up recently and second-hand there would be needed a very elaborate net indeed, if there was to be even a slender chance of successful inquiry. Nevertheless, Appleby communicated with London at once. He then considered the matter of access to the machine and found no progress was to be made, It stood in a small ante-drawing-room, close to a service door. Anyone could have gone down in the middle of the night, set the machine going, slipped through the door, and returned to an upper corridor by more than one pair of service stairs. Scamnum was a building made for such tricks. And in the alarm, occasioned by the pealing bell, nobody had been on the look-out for suspicious movements. From all this there was derivable only one inference: the Black Hand had a fair familiarity with the house. Which told one really nothing. So far, Appleby said to himself, the enemy was winning all along the line."|"Hamlet, Revenge!"|"Michael Innes"
"< 00:00"|"just short of midnight"|"An understanding of Bunney’s box and private access to it some time before breakfast on the Saturday morning, were the next points. The most important witness here was not available; it would be some time before Bunney could again be on speaking terms with the world. But significant facts were to be gleaned. Bunney had arrived after luncheon on Friday and had lost no time in bringing his machine into play – as Gott had discovered on the terrace before dinner. Mysterious phonetic nicety apart, there was nothing particularly novel about the machine, except that it combined recording and reproducing units in an unusually compact way. But Bunney, being proud of it, hawked it round. Late on Friday night he had been demonstrating to all comers in the library; in the library just short of midnight, the somewhat reluctant Bagot had repeated the Lord’s Prayer; and in the library, finally, the machine had been left for the night. The Black Hand had merely to walk in. Which was not helpful, thought Appleby – and turned to his last chance."|"Hamlet, Revenge!"|"Michael Innes"
14:15|"two-fifteen p.m."|"So that was it. That was why Gervase had received his message when he did. There was one day in the year on which anybody could send off a telegram from the little post office of Scamnum Ducis without the slightest chance of being remembered. And that was on the day of the local race-meeting, when the village became an artery for streams of cars, and when scores of these stopped hourly at the post office to enable their owners to wire or telephone bets. Not only could anyone have driven down from London or anywhere else and sent the telegram in perfect safety; anyone from Scamnum could safely have sent it too. For there had been two strange assistants working hard, and the Duke himself could have handed a telegram to one of these without anyone being the wiser. And, finally, the message had been handed over the counter, not telephoned. The old person found it without difficulty, duly endorsed as having been despatched at two-fifteen p.m. It was a common telegraph form with the message pencilled in neat block capitals – a thing with which nothing could be done outside a fairy-story."|"Hamlet, Revenge!"|"Michael Innes"
"ap 02:15"|two-fifteen|"Appleby walked back to Scamnum with the feeling that in the matter of the messages he had come off second-best. All he had gained was certain exiguous facts of time and place. Setting aside the thoughts of agents and accomplices, he had it that the Black Hand had been in Scamnum Duds post office at two-fifteen on the Monday before the murders and that a few days later – on the Friday – he had been either outside Auldearn’s London home just after two or in the neighbourhood of the Scamnum south lodge just after four or – less probably – somewhere on the route between these places at the time of the passing of Auldearn’s car. But this information, if slight, was not valueless; it might serve to eliminate – at least in a tentative way – this person and that from what was an alarmingly large body of suspects. And in conjunction with the other similar tests a good deal of progress might be made. Take, for example, Malloch as a suspect. One would ask could he, on his verifiable movements, have (a) thrown the message into the car, (b) sent the telegram, (c) shot Auldearn, (d) stabbed Bose, and (e) attacked Bunney. By this means, laborious as it would be to apply to over a score of people, one should get a long way. And this was a fact that the murderer must have reckoned on; it was his rashness again. And suddenly Appleby halted in his stride; he thought it likely that he had got somewhere already – and not where he wanted to be."|"Hamlet, Revenge!"|"Michael Innes"

By this means, laborious as it would be to apply to over a score of people, one should get a long way. And this was a fact that the murderer must have reckoned on; it was his rashness again.

"ap > 04:00"|"just after four"|"Appleby walked back to Scamnum with the feeling that in the matter of the messages he had come off second-best. All he had gained was certain exiguous facts of time and place. Setting aside the thoughts of agents and accomplices, he had it that the Black Hand had been in Scamnum Duds post office at two-fifteen on the Monday before the murders and that a few days later – on the Friday – he had been either outside Auldearn’s London home just after two or in the neighbourhood of the Scamnum south lodge just after four or – less probably – somewhere on the route between these places at the time of the passing of Auldearn’s car.

"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"‘Yes, sir. I’ll begin with the first murder, although there are earlier events to be considered. Lord Auldearn was shot through the heart just on eleven o’clock last night. Owing to the construction of what they call the rear stage no one could see what happened, with the probable exception of the prompter – the Indian gentleman – who seems to have paid for his knowledge with his life. But we have a certain amount of evidence as to what occurred, nevertheless. There is the remarkable fact that the shot was not fired from the shelter of the double curtains: the experts swear to that on the strength of the powder-marks. Just conceivably the shot might have come from above when Lord Auldearn was in the act of lying down; in other words, just conceivably the shot might have come from the painter, Mr Cope. But it seems more likely that the shot was fired by a person who walked straight across the rear stage to effect it – risking the observation of the prompter in doing so. There may have been a moment’s struggle or flurried movement, because an iron cross was knocked off what they call, I think, the faldstool; or this may have happened when the murderer was making his hurried escape back to the curtains. We must notice that the revolver – a small foreign weapon which it will not be easy to trace – was carried off the scene of the shooting and hidden in a very odd spot in this green-room here. And there’s a point where I differ from you a little, sir. You see that as evidence of deliberate hardihood – one of a number of such. pieces of evidence. But whatever we may think of placing the gun in the skull, I feel that carrying it away would be automatic. Calculation would no doubt tell the murderer to drop it before attempting his getaway through the curtains – I admit that. But calcution may not have come in. It isn’t a man’s instinct to drop a gun after firing; he makes off, gun and all.’"|"Hamlet, Revenge!"|"Michael Innes"

And now at half past nine the Chief Constable had collected a small group of people in the little drawing-room. Plainly he was pleased – exultant in the knowledge that he had taken action and that there was calm in Whitehall. But he was decently subdued, semi-official to just that degree which becomes a soldier playing policeman at Scamnum Court – in fact altogether correct. The Duke might have repented about his dispositions in the matter of port."|"Hamlet, Revenge!"|"Michael Innes"

Clay knew the ways of big houses and knew that no footman up at two a.m. was going to clean out such a thing; it would be put by for the appropriate maid or boy in the morning. And he knew, roughly, where he could find it in the small hours. What he didn’t know was the severe nature of Mr Rauth, who likes to lock things up. As a consequence of that he had to break into the pantry where it was and so leave traces of himself. And to avert suspicion from what he had really been after he broke open a tin of biscuits, filled his pockets with them, and later transferred them to the box in his bedroom. And that was his undoing. For Lady Elizabeth, who was familiar with the precise dispositions in these matters imposed, again, by the excellent Rauth, knew at once that he must have been the raider of the pantry. And Clay made the slip of denying it."|"Hamlet, Revenge!"|"Michael Innes"
