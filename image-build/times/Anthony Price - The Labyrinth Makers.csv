Even the presence of Mrs Harlin in her usual place–Mrs Harlin certainly represented all those virtues–could not turn 6 a.m. into 10."|"The Labyrinth Makers"|"Anthony Price"
"ap 07:00"|"7 o'clock"|"'Dr Audley–Sir Frederick wishes me to tell you that there is a file on your desk. If you would let him have your observations on it in the conference room at 7 o'clock he would be most grateful. The regular records staff is not available yet, so if you require anything else perhaps you could ask me?'"|"The Labyrinth Makers"|"Anthony Price"

In any case, they had him now, and their official status would probably strengthen their hand rather than weaken it. He held his identification open for Morrison to see, just above the spotty face of the latest customer.
'Until 5.25, then, Mr Morrison. Don't go away.'
Outside the crowds seemed even thicker and more determined. The two small boys were still glued to the window, and one of them instantly buttonholed Roskill."|"The Labyrinth Makers"|"Anthony Price"
"ap 05:25"|5.25|"'Mr Morrison was helping us with some information concerning a matter we are investigating, inspector. A matter falling under the Official Secrets Act. He was only marginally concerned with it. We spoke to him briefly early in the afternoon and arranged to see him again at 5.25, just before he closed. We found the shop locked, and Squadron Leader Roskill went round to the service entrance. He found the body at the bottom of the stairs.'"|"The Labyrinth Makers"|"Anthony Price"
