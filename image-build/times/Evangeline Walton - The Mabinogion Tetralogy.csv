12:00|noon|"“He would have here if our host’s wife had been young and pretty,” mumbled a second man, still chewing. “Then he might have stayed in bed till noon.” Which was true, for Pwyll was of the New Tribes, among whom hospitality included the use of one’s wife as well as of one’s best food and bed. It was different with the Old Tribes, who did not know marriage and whose women slept with men only when it pleased them, although they often pleased."|"The Mabinogion Tetralogy"|"Evangeline Walton"
12:00|noon|"Joy leapt in Pwyll; a last flare of strength. Then, black and bleak, came understanding. On earth is sunset near? Does his strength grow until noon, then ebb as the light ebbs? As the shadows rise to become Lords of the earth?"|"The Mabinogion Tetralogy"|"Evangeline Walton"
12:00|noon|"The cry was Kueli’s. He was running, staggering as he ran, he who since noon had not been able to rise, and his face was blanched with horror."|"The Mabinogion Tetralogy"|"Evangeline Walton"
01:00|"1 am"|"Branwen thought, This much I can do. For this little while longer 1 am needed."|"The Mabinogion Tetralogy"|"Evangeline Walton"
00:00|midnight|"“They cannot have been happy, those six fine ladies—each of them had a daughter or a sister that she said would have brought Pwyll four fine boys in those four winters instead of only one. A bitter pill it must have been, too, to know that now, because of her one son, this stranger woman would queen it over them forever. But they dared not say so; they had to pretend to be proud and happy. For no higher trust could have been given to any women in Dyved. They knew that they must guard that mother and son as each would her own two eyes. Yet by midnight every last one of them was fast asleep.”"|"The Mabinogion Tetralogy"|"Evangeline Walton"
12:00|noon|"“Woman of the house,” he said, “let you tell your man to make haste with my master’s shield. He wants it by tomorrow noon.”"|"The Mabinogion Tetralogy"|"Evangeline Walton"
12:00|noon|"Rhiannon thought a moment. “There are several ahead of him. We cannot have his shield ready before the third noon from now. But I will speak to my man. We will do what we can.”"|"The Mabinogion Tetralogy"|"Evangeline Walton"
12:00|noon|"“You must do better than that, woman. My master must have his shield by tomorrow noon.”"|"The Mabinogion Tetralogy"|"Evangeline Walton"
"< 12:00"|"toward noon"|"Feet glowed and gleamed, they flashed and sparkled. They twinkled like fireflies, they moved sedately like the moon, they strode ponderously and stately like the sun marching triumphantly toward noon."|"The Mabinogion Tetralogy"|"Evangeline Walton"
12:00|midday|"Cold and lonely was that journey. Winter’s teeth already were biting, frost-white, through the autumn winds. The trees that at first flamed like torches soon were stripped and bare, their naked boughs shivering in the gusts, the fallen leaves beneath them brown as themselves. All their brief glory of red and gold was gone, withered as their summer greenness. Soon man and girl wore their heavy cloaks even at midday, and when night came they tethered the donkeys where the trees grew lowest, and there was most shelter."|"The Mabinogion Tetralogy"|"Evangeline Walton"
00:00|Midnight|"But nothing happened. Not one footfall out of all those pattering clawed softnesses came near them. Not one sound took on size or purpose; any purpose that had to do with them . . .
The moon rose higher. The night wore. Midnight came.
It happened then. That terrible, blazing spear of light shot out, stretching from end to end of heaven, slashing across the moon’s bright face. All the stars of heaven seemed to be falling, and as they fell, the sky roared with thunder. Earth herself seemed to shake beneath the force of that blast that was the loudest ever heard."|"The Mabinogion Tetralogy"|"Evangeline Walton"
12:00|noon|"By noon Pryderi’s chief men and nobles were assembled and they talked of Gwydion’s offer in sight of the glittering things that he had brought. Nor was there one that did not marvel over these treasures, the splendid beasts and the gleaming gold; nor loathe in his heart the thought that such riches might leave Dyved, and be seen there no more. Yet the new beasts too were a unique and priceless possession, a race of beings that had come from out the glamorous, mystical regions of Faery, and were held by Dyved alone, of all the lands of earth, her singular and choice crown."|"The Mabinogion Tetralogy"|"Evangeline Walton"
12:00|Noon|"All day they fought, and the air rang with the clash of weapons, and the waters of the ford were stained with red. The shadows shortened and the sun moved forward in his triumphal march above the world. Noon came and went. The shadows lengthened and the sun moved downward toward the west. And the two distant camps were shrouded in a stillness in which the beating of the heart could be heard, and that made thunderous the rustling of the leaves in the wind."|"The Mabinogion Tetralogy"|"Evangeline Walton"
12:00|noon|". . . Silence like night come at noon. Silence and all the immeasurable weight of silence. “What is this?” he had said; and the listening girls never knew whether he had spoken it aloud, or whether it was only in their own minds that they had heard the force of his thought, echoing and re-echoing, loud as thunder in that soundlessness, crashing and reverberating from wall to wall. . . ."|"The Mabinogion Tetralogy"|"Evangeline Walton"
12:00|noon|"And then and for long after none ever dreamed that the Castle of the Silver Wheel did not stand firm in its place forever. Nor did Gwydion and Arianrhod think of gods or deluges when they strolled on the white shores at evening, or dreamed under the shade of great trees by noon, looking out towards the green isle of Mona of the Druids, or back towards the mouth of the Menai and the shore where loomed Gwydion’s fortress that a later day was to call Dinas Dinllev."|"The Mabinogion Tetralogy"|"Evangeline Walton"
00:00|midnight|"At night he went forth again, when all the world was asleep except for the wild things in the wood, and the fox that creeps through the field on his way to seek the hens of men. In that lonely hour of midnight gloom and stillness, so like so many nights now happily bygone, did Gwydion remember that he too had once roamed the wildwood and worn fangs and fur?"|"The Mabinogion Tetralogy"|"Evangeline Walton"
"ap 01:00"|one|"She could have complained to Mâth her uncle. But he might have answered that if she was not willing to be a virgin, she had no right to lament if she was not called one; and had she told him lies about what had passed between herself and Gwydion, he would have read them in her mind."|"The Mabinogion Tetralogy"|"Evangeline Walton"
12:00|noontide|"Flowers the servants carried there also, at every noontide. Great heaps of the blossoms of oak and broom and meadow-sweet, the finest and fairest to be gathered in the woods and the fields. But what use Mâth and Gwydion made of those flowers, like all else they did in those three days, is one of the mysteries that lie dead with the druids—though perhaps yellow men, fashioning their thought into palpable images in lonely monasteries in the snowy mountains of Tibet, retain fragments of that strange science that may once have travelled from Stonehenge to the menhirs on far southern isles in an ocean of whose existence the folk of Gwynedd never knew."|"The Mabinogion Tetralogy"|"Evangeline Walton"
12:00|noonday|"And on a day in autumn, when the leaves were red as blood and the footsteps of approaching winter chilled the sea, Gwydion the son of Dôn rode in haste to Caer Dathyl and the palace of Mâth the King. He had spared neither himself nor his beast in that coming, and the thing that greeted him was silence. A shadow lay over Caer Dathyl even there in the noonday sun."|"The Mabinogion Tetralogy"|"Evangeline Walton"
12:00|noon|"On the third noon Gwydion and Mâth sat alone in the chamber of the son of Mathonwy; and their hands and minds were idle and their faces grey and spent. A bleak gloom hung around them, a dulling shadow that the sun’s gold could not warm or dispel. They looked old as they sat there, tired men who had failed. Sometimes the eyes of one would turn and search the deeps of the other’s, as though seeking in them for some means yet untried, some art that had not yet been defeated."|"The Mabinogion Tetralogy"|"Evangeline Walton"
12:00|noon|"He rode forth at noon. From the palace doorway Llew watched him go, this man who had given him life and then dragged him back to life, that in this moment seemed a heavy weariness. Much as he loved Gwydion, in that hour he almost resented those encircling battlements of love that would not let him go when happiness was spoiled and hope dead and the future a mighty loneliness, grey at dusk. . . ."|"The Mabinogion Tetralogy"|"Evangeline Walton"
