20:00|"eight P.M."|"At the Clarissa Frayne Institute for Parentally Challenged Boys, every day was basically the same. Toil by day, fitful sleep by night. There were no days off, no juvenile rights. Every day was a work day. The marshals worked the orphans so hard that by eight P.M. most of the boys were asleep standing up, dreaming of their beds."|"The Supernaturalist"|"Eoin Colfer"
12:00|noon|"Stefan opened the door a crack, slipping into the Satellite City dawn. Sunrise used to be orange. But now sunrises were a multicolored affair, as the sun’s light illuminated whatever chemicals were in the smog that particular day. Today the smog was deep purple, so that probably meant pesticides. The air would stink by noon. Still it was better than red. Nobody ventured outdoors without a mask when the smog was red."|"The Supernaturalist"|"Eoin Colfer"

Some old guy had stuck his hand in the microwave while it was still on, setting off his personal alarm. Many citizens carried personal alarms that could be activated in the event of danger or illness, summoning a protection or medical team.

And that two minutes could mean the difference between life and death."|"The Supernaturalist"|"Eoin Colfer"

00:00|midnight|"There was something else unusual. An absence of a noise that was as much a part of the Abracadabra Street warehouse as the curtains. The computer off-line. Of course it was. There would be no more midnight jaunts. No more lightning rods and no more blue spheres. People would just have to lose their life force, as they had probably been doing for thousands of years."|"The Supernaturalist"|"Eoin Colfer"
17:00|"five P.M."|"“Hey, we’re maintenance, not royalty,” said Stefan, trying to sound injured. “The five P.M. advertisement is skipping, so they sent us up to clip on a new panel.”"|"The Supernaturalist"|"Eoin Colfer"
00:00|midnight|"“A couple of midnight scientists? Very dangerous. The security people are already wrapped.”"|"The Supernaturalist"|"Eoin Colfer"
