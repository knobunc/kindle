"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"“Mr. Wickersham will be your tutor. He lives at Geo C/15/37. You’re to meet him at his home at two o’clock Wednesday afternoon, and thereafter three times a week at your mutual convenience. And please, let’s not be late on Wednesday. Now come along and I’ll show you your room for first hour.”"|"Rite of Passage"|"Alexei Panshin"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"“Mr. Mbele is your tutor now. Not Mr. Wickersham as I told you this morning. I assume everything else I told you this morning will apply. Show up at two o’clock on Wednesday and please remember what I said about being late. I don’t want the students in my charge being late. A bad reputation always gets back and I’m the one who has to think up explanations.”"|"Rite of Passage"|"Alexei Panshin"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"I saw Daddy after he closed his office for the day. That is, he closed our living room to new people at five o’clock, and by almost eleven he’d seen the last person who was waiting."|"Rite of Passage"|"Alexei Panshin"
"~ 14:00"|"about two o’clock in the afternoon"|"I wanted to get away. I wanted someplace dark to hide. I wanted something to do to occupy my mind. When I got back to our apartment—a place that held the furniture but not the feel of home—I hunted up a piece of chalk and one of those small lights that dorm mothers use to count heads with after lights-out. Then I went out again. It was about two o’clock in the afternoon then, and though I hadn’t eaten for hours I was far too agitated to think of food."|"Rite of Passage"|"Alexei Panshin"
"ap 02:00"|two|"JIMMY AND I got off the shuttle at Entry Gate 5 on the Third Level. This was supposedly where our group was to meet at two o’clock. We were about ten minutes early. The shuttle door slid open and we left the car. When we were clear, the car flicked away, responding to a call from another level, much like an elevator. On the cross-level line, a few feet away, there were several cars just sitting and waiting to be called."|"Rite of Passage"|"Alexei Panshin"
"ap 02:00"|two|"It was still before two, so the kids who were there already were standing under the trees by the corral and watching the horses. I recognized Venie Morlock among them. I wasn’t surprised to see her there since she was only one month older than I and I had expected that we would wind up in the same Trial group."|"Rite of Passage"|"Alexei Panshin"
"ap 00:30"|12:30|"Then he turned to us and said, “My name is Fosnight. I’m in charge of coordinating all Trial and pre-Trial programs, and that includes survival classes. There are, at present, six classes in training, counting this one, meeting in various areas of the Third Level. This class is scheduled to meet regularly from now on, here at Gate 5, on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoons at 12:30. Third Class is here on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. If the meeting times conflict with school, tutorial sessions, or anything else, you’ll have to find a way out. Reschedule, perhaps—the other, of course, not this—or skip one or the other. That is strictly up to you to settle. It is strictly up to you whether or not you decide to attend, but I can guarantee that almost anyone will find his chances of coming back from Trial alive infinitely improved if he attends Survival Class regularly. Your group is somewhat smaller than the usual one, so you should do very well. You are also lucky to have Mr. Marechal here as your instructor—he’s one of our six best chief instructors.” He smiled at his little joke."|"Rite of Passage"|"Alexei Panshin"
"ap 06:30"|six-thirty|"“You said to be here at six-thirty,” he said apologetically, seeing that we were not finished as yet."|"Rite of Passage"|"Alexei Panshin"
"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"We were clearly beaten by Mr. Marechal’s group, which finished almost an hour before we did and then came over and made comments, but we were done before noon, too. I looked over the other building when we were done, along with some curious friends, and I’ll have to honestly say that I preferred our cabin to their shed—better workmanship."|"Rite of Passage"|"Alexei Panshin"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"We were to leave at eight. At quarter to eight, Mr. Marechal came in, wished us luck, and went on his way. His new class was to have its first meeting that afternoon and I think he was probably already memorizing names."|"Rite of Passage"|"Alexei Panshin"
"ap 07:45"|"quarter to eight"|"We were to leave at eight. At quarter to eight, Mr. Marechal came in, wished us luck, and went on his way. His new class was to have its first meeting that afternoon and I think he was probably already memorizing names."|"Rite of Passage"|"Alexei Panshin"
"ap < 08:00"|"Just before eight"|"Just before eight, George Fuhonin and Mr. Pizarro arrived. George was quite bright and cheerful in spite of the early hour. I was standing near the ramp and he stopped."|"Rite of Passage"|"Alexei Panshin"
13:00|"one that second day"|"Mr. Kutsov had a good library of books and I looked through them, in the process finding a number of very interesting things. History—the Losels’ natural home was on a continent to the west where they had been discovered one hundred years earlier. Since that time they had been brought over by the shipload and used for simple manual labor. There had previously been no native population of Losels on this continent. Now, in addition to those owned and used for work, there was a small but growing number of Losels running wild in the back country. Most of the opinions I read granted them no particular intelligence, citing their inability to do anything beyond the simplest sort of labor, their lack of fire, and their lack of language. For my part, I remembered what Mr. Kutsov had said about the ability of the wild ones to recognize their particular enemies and that didn’t seem stupid to me at all. In fact, I was relieved that I had come off so well from my encounter with one that second day."|"Rite of Passage"|"Alexei Panshin"
