"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"For some female journalists it was where they felt most comfortable, but for others the banishment to the women’s page brought only boredom, frustration, and despair at the waste of their talents. In an 1890 Harper’s Weekly article entitled “A Woman’s Experience of Newspaper Work,” a reporter who gave her name only as J.L.H. described her long and fruitless effort to escape society reporting. “I think there is no class of employment in the world which I would have liked less than professional intrusion upon the august movements of the élite,” she wrote; “but again it was no question of choice. I was obliged to accept the position of society reporter because managers stoutly maintained that there was nothing else about a newspaper office which a woman could do.” The year before, in an article for The Journalist, the newspaper writer Flora McDonald likewise bemoaned the sorry lot of the intelligent, ambitious female reporter forced to attend one dreary society event after another. “Life,” wrote McDonald, “becomes to her one long-drawn-out five o’clock tea of somebody else. She is in the swim, but not of it, and, recording the flops and flounders of the big fish, she in time descends to a state of mental and moral petrifaction that is simply awful. One woman says ‘society reporting is prostitution of brains.’ Oh, that it were no worse! It is prostitution of soul, too.”"|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"
"ap 01:00"|one|"Bly was sending her reports regularly back to Pittsburgh, where they were published in the Dispatch; eventually word of one of her articles, about the arrest of a local newspaper editor who had dared to criticize the government, came to the attention of some Mexican government officials. Before long they were threatening to arrest her for violating Article 33 of the country’s constitution, which barred foreigners from participating “in any way” in Mexico’s politics. Facing the prospect of an extended stay in a Mexican jail, Bly returned to Pittsburgh with her mother, one month earlier than they had intended. Back home, she lashed out at the corruption of the Mexican political system, which she derided as “a republic only in name, being in reality the worst monarchy in existence.” One of her articles described how the recently retired president Manuel González had enriched himself by some $25 million during his four years in office; another criticized Mexico’s newspapers as little more than “tools of the organized ring.” The Mexican people themselves understood how newspapers were complicit in their exploitation, and as a consequence it was possible to travel all day in Mexico and never see a man reading one. “They possess such a disgust for newspapers,” Bly observed, “that they will not even use one of them as a subterfuge to hide behind in a street car when some woman with a dozen bundles, three children and two baskets is looking for a seat.”"|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"
12:00|noon|"Half of all the commerce that entered the United States came through New York, and three-quarters of the immigrants; the clerks of the city’s post office handled more than a billion letters each year, and another forty thousand tons of newspapers. Around Manhattan, local branches of the Western Union telegraph company were connected to the main office on Broadway by a series of pneumatic tubes. Every day at noon a ball was dropped from a flagpole in front of the Western Union office; a few minutes before that, a crowd of onlookers began to gather, all waiting to set their watches. On the streets everyone seemed to be late for an appointment. The opening page of a tourist guide to New York promised “the crush of carriages, drays, trucks, and other vehicles, private and public, roaring and rattling over the stone-paved streets; the crowds of swiftly-moving men walking as if not to lose a second of time, their faces preoccupied and eager.” Visiting the city, the British philosopher Herbert Spencer warned its inhabitants that “Immense injury is done by this high-pressure life” and counseled what he called “the gospel of relaxation.” The latest style of men’s canes had watches concealed in their handles. Few restaurants in commercial areas could prosper that did not offer the so-called quick lunch for their patrons, and recent years had brought an even more startling development: “lunches sent out,” as the new culinary fashion was called, meals delivered on trays directly to the work desk, so that a banker or broker might snatch a few quick bites of his sandwich without missing even a single minute of work. “A life-curtailing habit it is no doubt,” editorialized the Tribune, “but it illustrates the high voltage system under which business is done in this, the world’s busiest commercial centre.”"|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"

She fell asleep with the first gray shimmer of dawn; at five o’clock the cell door was unlocked and a voice commanded her to get up.

Those few blocks, though—no more than ten minutes’ walk—bridged two very different worlds. On West Thirty-fifth Street by Broadway, Nellie Bly was living at the northwest edge of the notoriously louche neighborhood that a New York police captain, in honor of the plentiful opportunities for graft to be found there, had dubbed the Tenderloin (“I’ve been having chuck steak ever since I’ve been on the force,” he gloated upon his transfer, “and now I’m going to have a bit of tenderloin”). An out-of-town theatergoer making a wrong turn away from the Rialto would find that just to the east, on Sixth Avenue, the lights emanating from the storefronts had become at once dimmer and more lurid, the crowds jamming the sidewalks less expensively dressed and a good deal livelier, the avenue itself lined on both sides with raucous dance halls, gambling parlors, and saloons with names like Paddy the Pig’s and the Burnt Rag (each of them, courteously, had a separate Ladies’ Entrance), as well as numerous whorehouses more politely termed “houses of assignation.” Some of the houses catered to more upscale customers; their front parlors were scented with patchouli and brightened with sprays of fresh-cut flowers, and at midnight the evening’s patrons were served an oyster supper."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"

No invitations to the Royal Street salon were ever sent out, and none needed to be—the right people knew to attend, among them Kate Chopin and Grace King (both of whom would become famous authors), as well as New Orleans’s most celebrated writer, George Washington Cable. This salon, as Davis herself characterized it, was “a place of resort for men and women of brains and wit, where fashion is subservient to mind, and where the twaddlers cease to twaddle”—a place that provided exactly the type of intelligent, stimulating talk that Elizabeth Bisland had longed for since those long-ago dinner table conversations about English poetry. Now she could have those conversations again, week after week; in this house on Royal Street she was not the shy country girl cowering behind the door of the cheap boardinghouse but was instead a talkative, self-assured, radiant young woman. One of the salon’s participants would later recall how on those afternoons Bisland smiled spontaneously and with delight, seeming to create around her “a little circle of magnetic sunshine.”"|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"

As time went on it offered members regular concerts, plays, and lectures on topics ranging from English and Russian literature to Louisiana history and the role of the press in shaping public opinion, as well as classes that taught skills such as typewriting, stenography, telegraphy, needlework, and elocution. A Daily Picayune article remarked that, as late as ten o’clock at night, it was not unusual “to see two or more score of husbands amiably cooling their heels in the club halls while their wives in the pretty parlors beyond were listening to literature lectures, to good music, or to practical talk, calculated to make them better homemakers or more sensible women.” The club established its own Bureau of Employment, and members took on projects to place matrons in police station houses, provide supplies to the local Woman’s and Children’s Hospital, and distribute food and clothing to flood victims. A reporter of the time, describing the successes of the New Orleans Woman’s Club to the readers of the New York weekly The Epoch, declared, “This Louisiana sisterhood … owes its existence to one woman—in this case to a journalist, Miss Elizabeth Bisland.”"|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"
08:00|"eight o’clock that morning"|"At eight o’clock that morning Elizabeth Bisland had been awakened by the maid with the breakfast tray, on which were also the morning newspapers and a pile of letters. Bisland was pleased to see half a dozen acceptances of invitations she had sent out for tea the following day; there were a few notes from friends as well, and a bill, and a notice from her tailor that a dress she had ordered was ready for a final fitting. She had a leisurely breakfast and read the papers. The Madison Square Theatre, just a few blocks away, was beginning matinee performances of Little Lord Fauntleroy; the boy playing the title role, in the estimation of the Sun, was “a prodigy without the parrot traits so dreaded in children on the stage.” The Times reported that the previous evening had been “ladies’ night” at the New York Press Club—on that night the club’s members, all of them men, had been allowed to bring their wives and daughters. That morning’s World contained another installment of Robert Louis Stevenson’s latest novel, The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter’s Tale, which the paper was trumpeting as “The Greatest Story of Modern Times.” If Bisland noticed the news about Nellie Bly’s race around the world, she never made any mention of it. She might also have missed the small item about the new fast mail train that had left New York the previous evening for San Francisco, with the goal of cutting a day’s time from the delivery of transcontinental mail; in retrospect, it was an article that would have been worth her attention."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"

"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"It was only a few minutes’ walk from her apartment to the offices of The Cosmopolitan. The morning was chilly but clear, the thin November sunlight a restorative after several days of rain. Bisland, though, would scarcely have noticed, her mind too filled with questions about what might have precipitated such a sudden and mysterious request. John Brisben Walker was known to be a very demanding employer—“the stiffest man in New York to work for,” by one account—restless, ambitious, occasionally impulsive. Perhaps her most recent feature article had caused consternation among some of the magazine’s more important readers: she had suggested that carefully planned tenement buildings, providing modern hot water plumbing, shared laundry facilities, and a well-stocked reading room and making provision for cooperative marketing and cooking among the tenants—and paid for by charitable millionaires—might “reconcile some of the terrible inequalities that make anarchists among a people with the most liberal institutions, the greatest natural wealth, and the most wonderful industrial development on the globe.” It was, of course, possible that some of the magazine’s backers were not as forward-thinking as was Mr. Walker himself. By eleven o’clock she had reached the headquarters of The Cosmopolitan, where she was immediately ushered into the office of the publisher."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"

She took a cab to a previously scheduled fitting with her tailor (where, after “a vigorous interview,” she managed to convince him that she could wear that dress at six o’clock that evening), and then returned home. For the next several hours Bisland’s apartment was a scene of bustle and confusion. Fifty people had been invited for five o’clock tea the next day; her sister Molly said that she would make the necessary apologies. Two dinner engagements, as well, had to be broken. She had letters to write, maps and schedules to consult, bags to pack. She was having trouble anticipating exactly what lay ahead of her. There would be railway dust, sea damps, tropical heat: that much at least she knew. The thought occurred to her that she could not be both a hard-working bee and, in the saying of the day, a butterfly of fashion, and that helped to simplify matters. She finally settled on two cloth dresses, half a dozen light bodices, and a silk dress for evening wear. She made sure to pack lots of hairpins, as they had always had a way of playing hide-and-seek with her, and she knew that if this happened in a foreign country it would undermine her mood. She packed shoes, and gloves, and underwear (silk, she thought, would not gather dust, nor conduct changes in temperature), and a nightdress and dressing gown, and slippers as well, and toiletries of all sorts, and a sewing case for necessary repairs along the way, and a traveling inkstand for the writing she planned to do, and a supply of books and paper. For colder weather she packed a heavy wool overcoat and a travel rug to wrap herself in while aboard ships and trains; for wet weather, a pair of rubber overshoes and an umbrella. It would not do, she warned herself, to forget anything now, or to make any mistakes, particularly ones that could not be rectified later.

Nellie Bly stood at the port rail with the other passengers and waved her cap to those she was leaving behind; she could not help but wonder if she would ever see them again. Seventy-five days, which had seemed so short in the planning, now seemed an age. Smoke poured from the ship’s three funnels in thick black columns, then turned an irresolute gray and dissipated into the sky. The timbers of the deck thrummed softly beneath her feet. Behind her, just beyond the greenery of the Battery, the Tribune’s brick clock tower, seeming part schoolhouse, part church steeple, rose over the city’s newspaper district; before the day was out, Bly knew, her name would be repeated a thousand times there, in every newsroom and beanery and oyster saloon, wherever the men of the press congregated."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"

Sundays were the days Bly customarily devoted to thinking up ideas for new stories, and though good ones were never easy to come up with, on this particular Sunday she had spent most of the day and half of the night searching in vain for even a single suitable idea. Of late her exhausting work pace had begun to take a toll on her; after a lifetime of near-perfect health, she had started to get migraine headaches, some of them so severe that she was confined to her bed. Now, once again, her head was aching, and the longer she tossed and turned in bed the more frustrated she became. Her want of ideas kept her from getting sleep, and her want of sleep kept her from getting ideas, and by three o’clock in the morning she had decided that she could think of nothing worse than being a newspaper columnist, and at some point the thought occurred to her that she wished she was at the other end of the earth."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"

Ghormley had opened his shop ten years earlier, and over that time he had become one of the favored dressmakers of New York society, his agents in Paris, Lyons, London, and other European fashion capitals always on the lookout for the latest styles and colors."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"

Within a few minutes he had decided on a plain blue broadcloth and patterned camel’s hair as an attractive and durable combination for a traveling gown, and immediately set to work measuring and cutting.

Van Zile arrived in Washington late Monday night, and the next morning managed to obtain a meeting with no less a personage than Secretary of State James G. Blaine. Hearing of The World’s passport dilemma, Blaine promised Van Zile that he would personally handle the matter. The secretary of state proved to be as good as his word, and the next day, Wednesday, he delivered a temporary passport for Nellie Bly. At once Van Zile sped back to New York, arriving in the city at four-thirty Thursday morning—exactly five hours before Bly’s scheduled departure—with Special Passport Number 247 in hand."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"Lunch was served on the Augusta Victoria at one o’clock. On the first day, still weak from her earlier attack of seasickness, Bly made her way to the first-class passengers’ dining hall in the ship’s deckhouse. It was a large room, decorated in a rococo style that the industry journal The Marine Engineer generously termed “mixed Renaissance.” Overhead arched a canopy of stained glass; there were bronze statues, gilded mirrors, intricately painted panels done by “the best artists of the German school.” Stewards in full dress and white gloves moved noiselessly about, seeming to anticipate passengers’ needs before they were spoken. A group of musicians—the stewards of the second-class dining hall, hired in part for their musical skills—played an overture for the passengers as they arrived. As an honored guest, Bly was seated at the captain’s table, in the armchair directly to his left. Soon the captain himself, handsome and bearded, took his place at the head of the table. The waiters ladled out the soup; Bly discovered that she had an overwhelming desire not to see, smell, or taste food at least until they had reached land. The passengers began to introduce themselves. To Bly’s embarrassment, the others at the table turned out to be old hands at ocean crossings, and she thought she saw indulgent smiles on all their faces when, feeling another attack coming on, she put a handkerchief over her mouth and did her best to excuse herself politely from the table. “Miss Bly,” said Captain Albers, “you must come back every time.” One of the stewards helped her to a secluded spot on the deck, where again she was sick. Back inside the dining room, she was greeted with a hearty round of congratulations for her fortitude—“The only way to conquer seasickness is by forcing oneself to eat,” the captain noted approvingly—but the bravos of her tablemates only made her more conscious of her precarious condition, and when the fish course was placed before her she felt her stomach start to turn, and, choking behind her handkerchief, she was forced to excuse herself to the deck for a second time."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"

The government had offered the Union Pacific and associated railroads a contract worth $750,000 if the trip could be accomplished in that time. The very first run of the transcontinental fast mail train had left New York’s Grand Central Depot on the evening of November 14—just three hours after Elizabeth Bisland’s Fast Western Express—to determine whether it might be done. The train was carrying a mail car, a baggage car, two sleeper cars, a dining car, and a private car belonging to Edward Dickinson, general manager of the Union Pacific Railroad; the passengers included several railway and postal officials, as well as newspaper reporters from some of the cities along the cross-country route, who were looking to provide their readers with firsthand accounts of the historic trip. Elizabeth Bisland was the only woman aboard the train."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"
00:55|"12:55 A.M."|"At precisely 12:55 A.M., Cyclone Bill pulled out the throttle and the train lurched into motion. Using every pound of steam the engine could handle, the train climbed the eastern slope of the Wasatch mountain range, its speed increasing as it neared the summit, where it paused momentarily and then, with a stomach-lurching plunge, began its race downhill. The train careened wildly around the mountain passes, swept across plateaus, shot through tunnel after tunnel, going faster and faster; still the engineer did not ease up on the throttle. The local superintendent for the Railway Mail Service, James E. White, tried to joke that Downing was straightening out all the curves on the line, but there was no laughter in the car. Someone murmured that it would be a terrible thing to run off the track. No one said anything to that—derailments happened more often than anyone in the car cared to think about, and particularly at high rates of speed. An isolated mountain pass late at night, it didn’t need saying, would be the worst possible place to derail. To Elizabeth Bisland the train felt like a runaway horse; one of the reporters compared it to “some insane monster striving to free himself.” Its roar reverberated like a cannonade off the rocky sides of the canyons. At Devil’s Gate, where the track was not as crooked, the train seemed, impossibly, to pick up speed. The car rocked side to side like a ship in a storm, and some of the passengers actually became seasick, turning, in their urgency, to the nearby cuspidors. The warm, crowded car took on an unpleasant aroma. One man began to writhe on the floor in terror and was handed a flask of brandy to calm himself. From the rear platform of the car the passengers could see a shower of sparks trailing behind them; the tracks looked like two lines of fire in the night. “The telegraph poles,” Bisland wrote, “reeled backwards from our course and the land fled from under us with horrible nightmare weirdness.” She was not sick, but she could feel her nerves beginning to give way. Everyone sitting down held tight to the armrests; those who had mistakenly imagined they might sleep clutched the sides of their berths to keep from falling out. The train passed into the longest tunnel on the road, more than seven hundred feet cut out of hard red clay and sandstone; for endless seconds the blackness outside the windows seemed to grow still blacker. Just beyond the tunnel was the approach to Echo Canyon, where the declivity was 250 feet per mile and the road was said to be as crooked as a ram’s horn. Here the tracks hugged close to the hillsides, running along a narrow strip of earth high above the canyon. They could hear the steel wheels grinding on the curves; behind them the double stream of fire was almost continuous. James White got up to check the speed indicator that had been installed in the car and gasped at what he read there. Incredibly, a mile through Echo Canyon had been run in fifty-two seconds. Ahead lay an even more treacherous bit of road, the reverse loop at Antelope Gap. The train hit the first curve at full speed, and as it did, one side of the car was lifted into the air, so that only one set of wheels still clung to the tracks; there was an awful moment of suspense and then the car managed to right itself, the wheels landing down with a bump, before the train hit the reverse turn and the other set of wheels went up. Finally General Manager Edward Dickinson could take no more. “Let the schedule go!” he shouted to C. E. Brown, the Union Pacific press agent. “Pull the bell rope, Brown, then run forward and tell Downing to stop this if he wants us to reach Ogden alive.”"|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"
12:00|noon|"Indeed, time itself had been forever changed by the railroads. Until the latter decades of the nineteenth century, communities had the power to establish their own time zones in what was known as “local mean time,” determined by the position of the sun as it passed overhead. The state of Illinois contained twenty-seven different time zones, Wisconsin thirty-eight. In Pittsburgh the train station had six clocks, and each one showed a different time. When a clock struck noon in Washington, D.C., the time was 12:08 in Philadelphia, 12:12 in New York, and 12:24 in Boston. Local mean time was a perfectly fine standard when a day’s travel brought one only to a nearby town, but far less so when trains could cover a mile in a single minute and railroad companies operated in several states at once. The B&O Railroad, for instance, ran its eastern trains by Baltimore time, its Ohio trains by Columbus time, and those out west by the time of Vincennes, Indiana. Trains were moving at speeds never before seen, with the ever-present risk of catastrophe if one collided with another, and the widespread confusion about the exact times of arrivals and departures was, if nothing else, a major safety issue (particularly as railroads frequently ran trains in opposite directions on the same stretch of track). In October 1883, representatives of the largest railroad companies met at a General Time Convention in Chicago, at which it was decided to divide the country into four time zones, corresponding to the mean sun time at the meridians near Philadelphia, Memphis, Denver, and Fresno. This action had been taken without the consent of the president, the Congress, or the courts, but almost immediately it became the de facto law of the land. On Sunday, November 18, 1883, clocks across the country were changed to the new railroad standard; that Sunday became known as “the day of two noons.” Local mean time was gone; now everyone was living by railroad time. As one Indianapolis newspaper observed in a widely quoted editorial: “People will have to marry by railroad time, and die by railroad time. Ministers will be required to preach by railroad time, banks will open and close by railroad time; in fact the Railroad Convention has taken charge of the time business, and the people may as well set about adjusting their affairs in accordance with its decree.”"|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"

This action had been taken without the consent of the president, the Congress, or the courts, but almost immediately it became the de facto law of the land. On Sunday, November 18, 1883, clocks across the country were changed to the new railroad standard; that Sunday became known as “the day of two noons.” Local mean time was gone; now everyone was living by railroad time. As one Indianapolis newspaper observed in a widely quoted editorial: “People will have to marry by railroad time, and die by railroad time. Ministers will be required to preach by railroad time, banks will open and close by railroad time; in fact the Railroad Convention has taken charge of the time business, and the people may as well set about adjusting their affairs in accordance with its decree.”"|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"
"ap 00:24"|12:24|"Indeed, time itself had been forever changed by the railroads. Until the latter decades of the nineteenth century, communities had the power to establish their own time zones in what was known as “local mean time,” determined by the position of the sun as it passed overhead. The state of Illinois contained twenty-seven different time zones, Wisconsin thirty-eight. In Pittsburgh the train station had six clocks, and each one showed a different time. When a clock struck noon in Washington, D.C., the time was 12:08 in Philadelphia, 12:12 in New York, and 12:24 in Boston. Local mean time was a perfectly fine standard when a day’s travel brought one only to a nearby town, but far less so when trains could cover a mile in a single minute and railroad companies operated in several states at once. The B&O Railroad, for instance, ran its eastern trains by Baltimore time, its Ohio trains by Columbus time, and those out west by the time of Vincennes, Indiana.

"ap 09:15"|"quarter past nine"|"Awaking at daybreak, Bisland saw from the window of her berth the Sacramento Valley opening itself up below her, grassy, rounded hills with wisps of mist like whitecaps rolling among them. The sky had now grown cloudy, the light filtered and low across the horizon. She opened the window wider and was startled to see the distinctive spreading canopy of live oaks, unexpected but absolutely unmistakable, and wonderfully reminiscent of her home places of Louisiana and Mississippi. The western edge of America seemed almost to be echoing the eastern, another sign that her cross-country journey was nearing its end. Just after breakfast the train rolled into the Oakland Mole, a pier built fully two miles out into the bay, where the train passengers boarded the ferry to San Francisco. The boat made its way through the choppy waters of the bay toward the narrower strait of the Golden Gate, passing the lighthouse at Alcatraz, the Army barracks of Angel Island, the island itself ringed by cannons. Through the rain and the mist San Francisco rose into view, a vision in white, lines of elegant frame houses spread out over the steep hills, broad streets running up and down between them. Just ahead was the ferry house at the foot of Market Street, a low wooden building on which stood a single clock tower. At a quarter past nine on Tuesday, November 19, the ferry bumped up against the San Francisco wharf: Elizabeth Bisland had traveled coast to coast in only four days, fifteen hours, and fifteen minutes. The mail, too, had arrived on time, and the railroad officials cheered and clasped hands in jubilation and then went to deliver their statements to the reporters. Bisland made her way to the terminal, through the rain and the oozing mud, feeling great pleasure in walking with long strides and swinging arms after days of confinement on the train, delighted to be rid of the roar of the engine in her ears."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"

That morning Elizabeth Bisland used her remaining time in San Francisco to make the final preparations for her voyage. She exchanged American banknotes for English gold, read telegrams, wired parting messages to New York, and revised her itinerary. The plan now was for her to sail with the Oceanic to Yokohama and then board a train for Tokyo, where she would charter a special steamer to Hong Kong in order to catch the North German Lloyd ship Prussian, bound for Genoa. (The World had declared that Nellie Bly would not charter any special trains or steamers on her trip, but John Brisben Walker had never made such a stipulation.) In Genoa she would take an express train to Le Havre, where the fast French steamer La Champagne was departing for New York. She thought the trip might be accomplished in as little as seventy-two days, though (as she was quick to add to all the reporters who arrived to interview her) there was no predicting the final outcome."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"

Nellie Bly and Tracey Greaves, The World’s London correspondent, who would be accompanying her to France, had traveled for two hours in the train’s single passenger car, the locked compartment heated only by foot warmers and dingily lit by a smoky oil lamp. At that moment Elizabeth Bisland was beginning her trip across the Pacific Ocean, but Nellie Bly was unaware of this fact—no one from the World staff had wired the information about Bisland to Tracey Greaves, or if they had, he had neglected to tell her. As far as Bly knew, she was racing purely against a timetable established by a fictional character named Phileas Fogg, and she was thrilled by the opportunity she had now been given to meet Fogg’s creator, the world-famous novelist Jules Verne."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"

In his habits he is as regular as clockwork, and the adjective Verne most often uses to describe him is “mathematical.” Fogg’s predictable routine, however, is disturbed one evening by a discussion around the whist table about the shrinking of the globe in the new age of rapid travel. One player suggests that a complete circumnavigation of the earth might now be made in as little as three months. “Eighty days,” corrects Phileas Fogg. The others are skeptical of Fogg’s claim—what about unfavorable weather, they ask, or headwinds, or shipwrecks, or derailments? All of those contingencies, Fogg coolly replies, are accounted for in his schedule. That might be well and good in theory, his tablemates insist, but actually putting such an idea into practice is an entirely different matter. Ever the English empiricist, Fogg wagers twenty thousand pounds—half his fortune—that he can complete the trip in eighty days or less (“i.e., in 1,920 hours or 115,200 minutes,” he elucidates mathematically). The whist players agree to the bet, and Fogg sets off on his trip that very evening, accompanied by his French manservant Passepartout—and carrying, like Nellie Bly after him, only a single bag."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"

This warmly furnished sitting room was where, in the evenings, Honorine entertained guests in whom her husband had no interest, where she had given interviews to journalists that ended up embarrassing or upsetting him, as, for instance, when she pointed out how few women characters he had included in his books. Over time it had become clear to him that she did not understand his literary ambitions. At eleven each morning they had lunch together in the small breakfast room next to the kitchen, usually eating in silence while Jules brooded about his latest book. He was increasingly withdrawn; his wife frequently burst into tears, often for reasons he did not comprehend. She resented that he did not like to take her into Amiens society, and complained to friends that “he piles the problems produced by his discouragement onto me.” Always on Sundays she wanted him to accompany her to Mass; he had gone at first to appease her and then, after a while, he gave it up for good. Marriage, Verne once wrote in a letter to his brother—meaning the institution in general and his own in particular—constituted “an immense and irreparable folly.” Still, the two worked hard to keep up appearances, to be in public the couple the world wished them to be."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"

The glow of the meeting with the Vernes still lingered in Bly’s mind, how Jules Verne had traced out her route side by side with that of Phileas Fogg, how Honorine Verne had expressed her confidence that she would beat Fogg’s time. All the way to Calais, Greaves later wrote, “Nellie did nothing but talk about the motherly kindness of Mrs. Verne.” The Calais agent of the International Sleeping-Car Company met them at the station. Against company regulations he offered to open the train’s sleeping car ahead of time, to allow Nellie Bly the opportunity to go to bed, but though she had barely slept in more than forty-eight hours she turned down the offer. “This is the first time since I started when I really felt I had an hour to call my own,” she said. “I want to look about a bit.”"|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"

Leaving Calais every Saturday morning precisely at one-thirty, the train sped down France’s western coast to Amiens, skirted the suburbs of Paris, and ran through Burgundy to Dijon; crossing the Italian border during the night, the train arrived in Turin around lunchtime, then continued south along the Adriatic coast until it reached the port city of Brindisi, where its mailbags would be unloaded onto ships bound for India and Australia."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"

A few ruined houses were all that remained of Brundisium, the great port city of the ancient Romans, where Virgil died after contracting a fever in Greece. Beyond the walls of the town, now, marshes were being drained; the most recent Baedeker guide warned visitors that “the environs are fertile, but malarious.” One of the train guards volunteered to escort the female passengers to their ships and make sure that they were not charged more than the correct fare.

As of today she had been traveling for a full week, one quite unlike any other she had ever lived through, and she was still feeling the effects of that mad rush by train across the country. Even amid the luxury of the Palace Hotel—with its marble-paved courtyard and wood-paneled rising rooms and concierges on every floor, communicating with the front desk via an ingenious series of speaking tubes—she had had little time to rest, what with the final preparations to be made for her trip, the sightseeing expeditions organized by her newspaper hosts in the city (they had been so gracious she could not possibly say no), and of course the constant interruptions from curiosity seekers wanting just to get a glimpse of her, that newfound celebrity, that inexpensive freak show. She was relieved finally to be rid of them, excited to be leaving her country for the first time, and very much looking forward, on this long voyage across the Pacific, to leisurely meals with congenial companions, to many long hours of reading and writing and many more with no greater obligation than just to gaze at sea and sky: to the opportunity of returning to her senses."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"

The ship’s passenger was Joseph Pulitzer, owner and publisher of The World, and he was setting out on his own trip around the world, though far more slowly than his star reporter, Nellie Bly, and at the instruction not of editors but of doctors. His health, while never robust, had of late grown increasingly precarious, and his physicians believed that a long, leisurely sail, far removed from the stress of work, might help calm his nerves and restore his fading eyesight. As it turned out, Pulitzer would make it no farther than Constantinople; one afternoon, standing at the rail of the ship, he turned to his English secretary, Claude Ponsby, and remarked, “How suddenly it has gotten dark.” Ponsby looked at him in confusion and concern, for the midday sun was very bright. As it turned out, Pulitzer had suffered a detached retina in his left eye (which had been, up until then, his “good” eye), and he was immediately sent back to Europe to receive the care of ocular specialists.

As of the first of December her exact whereabouts were unknown, but she was somewhere on the Red Sea, on a steamship sailing eastward toward Ceylon, where she would connect with another steamship bound for Hong Kong. If Bly was able to get to Hong Kong by December 25 to meet the steamship Oceanic, and if the Oceanic crossed the Pacific Ocean smoothly and delivered Bly to San Francisco on time, she would then depart for New York on January 22 by way of the Central Pacific, Union Pacific, and Pennsylvania Railroads; and if she did not encounter any broken bridges, snow blockades, or derailments Bly would arrive at the Pennsylvania Railroad’s Jersey City depot sometime around seven P.M. on January 27, 1890. If she did manage to maintain that schedule the entire way (“the ‘if,’ ” The World felt obliged to point out, “is a big one”) and arrived on the dot of seven o’clock, the trip would have been completed in precisely 74 days, 9 hours, 19 minutes, and 30 seconds.

She had reached the midpoint on only her thirty-third day out of New York, but she knew that she could not maintain that pace—the trip across the South China Sea would be against the wind, and she would likely have a long wait for the connecting steamship in Hong Kong—and she was eager to make port in Singapore before night fell. The Oriental, though, did not reach Singapore’s waters until nearly six o’clock in the evening, and many more long minutes passed before the harbor pilot came aboard the ship to instruct the captain about how to proceed. Anxiously Bly awaited his verdict. The Oriental, the pilot finally decided, would have to anchor outside the harbor until morning, it being too dangerous to try to dock the steamship after dark. Bly could barely contain her frustration and rage; in her mind the delay “was the result of slowing down to leave off the coolies at Penang.” And this delay, in turn, would lead to an even greater one:"|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"

It was the Oriental’s maiden voyage to China, and despite the monsoon on the South China Sea, the ship had broken all records for the fastest passage from Colombo to Hong Kong. (Not surprisingly, perhaps, one of the Oriental’s passengers sued the P&O for bringing him to Hong Kong two days early. He claimed that he had purchased his tickets to cover a certain span of time, and if the company got him in before that time expired, then they were responsible for his expenses and had to pay his hotel bill. Bly did not report how that suit turned out.)"|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"
12:00|midday|"In town, most of the houses were made of lime-washed brick, and most had been built without windows, to keep out as much as possible of the sun’s heat and glare. The inside of Bisland’s hotel offered cool, pleasing dimness, with cloistered arcades and a loftily vaulted dining hall where potted palms swayed in the breeze made by huge fans revolving overhead. The guests were dressed all in white, like brides or debutantes: tall men in linen suits and pith helmets; slim girls in muslin frocks, their cheeks pink from the heat and their blond hair curled in damp ringlets about their brows and necks; imposing British matrons with the haughtiness of old Rome in their bearing, who carried themselves as the mothers and wives of conquerors. Bisland arrived during the midday meal called tiffin; young Indian waiters in tunics and turbans brought out rolls on banana leaves and platters of rice and curry that they served with spoons made from large pink shells. She sat with three soldiers, two of them young subalterns with “the sappy red of English beef still in their cheeks” on their first tour of service in the East. Rather than curry they ordered beef with beer; they mopped their faces from time to time with handkerchiefs and listened to the talk of their superior officer, who was dressed much like them but for the gold epaulets on his shoulders. The tropical sun had long ago burned the red English beef out of him, leaving him as dark and lean and dry as jerky; he drank a little iced brandy and soda, ate a bit of curry and a few pieces of fruit, and seemed to pay no attention to the heat. “He has no enthusiasms,” Bisland tartly noted, “he has no interests except duty and the service, and he does not think any brown or yellow person in the least pretty or pleasant.” His tone was gloomy, full of the disillusionment brought by years of colonial rule, and she could tell that the subalterns listened with respect but not enthusiasm, not wanting anything to dampen the pleasure they took in their own youthful fervor."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"
16:30|"four-thirty in the afternoon"|"The Thames left Singapore at four-thirty in the afternoon. An hour later the ship was steaming along the palm-fringed coast when up on deck Elizabeth Bisland heard a sudden cry and the sounds of a struggle. She caught a glimpse of the naked back of a young Chinese man with hands manacled behind him; the man tried to wrest himself from a sailor’s grip, and then suddenly, shockingly, he darted to the side of the ship and threw himself overboard. He was a Chinese prisoner, Bisland learned, convicted of forgery, who was being transported to Penang to face the punishment of the native authorities. (In Penang’s prisons inmates received no food, and had to depend on the charity of loved ones to keep from starving to death. “If I feed them,” the local sultan was said to have remarked, “my whole country will want to go to jail.”) Almost as soon as the prisoner plunged into the sea the ship’s engines were reversed and a life buoy thrown overboard, but he did not reappear. Long seconds ticked by, the Thames’s crew scanning the horizon like seamen on a whaler watching for the telltale plume of spray. Finally a cry went up: in the distance one of the sailors had seen the faint outline of a head bobbing up from the surface and moving rapidly toward the shoreline some four miles in the distance. Evidently the prisoner was a very strong swimmer, and something of a magician besides, for he had managed, while in the water, to slip his handcuffs. A lifeboat full of cheering Lascar sailors, under the command of a “calm and dominant” third officer, was lowered into the water and sent out in pursuit. The sailors rowed in unison, their oars cutting through the placid sea; from the deck of the Thames, Bisland watched the dash of the lifeboat slowly converge with the dot of the swimmer. In the distance she could make out some doubling back and forth by the lifeboat, presumably as the officer shouted commands at the man in the water, and then an oar raised menacingly overhead, until at last the fugitive submitted to being pulled into the boat. The trip back to the Thames took a good deal longer than the trip out, lacking, as it did, the thrill of the chase."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"
18:00|"six o’clock that evening"|"Captain Goggin politely excused himself and left to prepare for the ship’s departure. At six o’clock that evening—Christmas Eve—the Powan set sail for Canton, some ninety miles up the Pearl River, where it would make port the following morning. The Powan was a broad white-painted ship with the multiple arcaded decks of an American riverboat, flying the Union Jack and the white St. Andrew’s cross of the Hong Kong, Canton & Macao house flag. Bly visited below decks, where hundreds of Chinese passengers shared a single cabin. The room was large and noisy and reeked of the distinctive smell of opium, something like gunpowder and flowers and the sweaty musk of a horse after a run. Thick clouds of gray smoke hung above the passengers who sat cross-legged and crouching on the floor, reading, talking, playing fan-tan, cooking rice, and brewing tea; some of them even managed to stretch out and sleep amid the clamor. Like immigrants in the steerage of transatlantic steamships, the Chinese passengers had to supply their own beds (really little more than bits of straw matting) and their own food as well. An English traveler on the Powan would later write: “These ships carry, each trip, from five hundred to two thousand Chinamen, and the monthly circulation between Hongkong and Canton amounts to over one hundred thousand pigtails. This enables the Company, who practically have a monopoly of the business, to pay a very handsome dividend.”"|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"

There was Longevity Street, Bright Cloud Street, Street of the Ascending Dragon, Street of One Hundred Grandsons, Street of Nine Fold Blessings, Street of One Thousand Fold Peace. The group rode over a bridge across a dull, muddy stream to a little island called Shameen, where the foreign residents of Canton lived, through an entryway guarded by policemen. No Chinese were allowed on Shameen without a pass; at nine o’clock each night a trumpet sounded, a cannon was fired, all of the island’s gates were closed, and, in the words of the United States Consul General in Hong Kong, “the foreigner lies down to sleep as safe as though he were in Hong Kong or New York.”"|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"

"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"IN CEYLON, ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE NEW YEAR, ELIZABETH BISLAND boarded the Peninsular and Oriental steamship Britannia, bound for Brindisi, Italy. Like the Victoria, on which Nellie Bly had sailed east from Brindisi to Ceylon, the Britannia was one of the P&O’s “Jubilee” steamships, launched by the company in 1887 to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of Queen Victoria’s coronation. It was a single-screw steamship with two funnels and four masts, large enough to accommodate 410 passengers and four thousand tons of cargo. Each of the passengers was provided with his or her own bamboo lounging chair, little table, and tea service for the indispensable ceremony of five o’clock tea. Three times a week, Bisland learned, the ship’s band played for dancing on deck; the other evenings were filled with tableaux vivants and private theatricals and fancy balls. The days on the water were long and, other than the occasional cricket match on the afterdeck, uneventful. The sea rose and fell not in waves, but in steady, almost imperceptible exhalations. Sometimes, toward the end of the day, rosy clouds floated up from the horizon. They were sailing now in the regions that early mapmakers had believed were inhabited by dragons; as far as she could tell, none lurked in these waters, though sometimes a whale surfaced to send up a jet of shining spray, leaving a long green ribbon of wake behind it. Occasionally schools of fish with wings of film rose into the path of the ship, then flitted away like flocks of sparrows. But day after day, little marked the passing of the hours but the coming and going of the light."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"
12:00|noon|"Initially it seemed a safe enough prediction, for after three days at sea the Oceanic was 110 miles ahead of the pace it had set in November. On the fourth day, though, the weather turned unexpectedly foul, with torrential rains and fierce winds. Some of the officers tried to reassure Bly, predicting that the storm would last only a day, but the following day the weather was even worse. The ship plunged through the wild, roaring sea, buffeted by mountainous waves, rolling, pitching, the storm never letting up for even a moment. Chief Allen, who had been making the run from Hong Kong to San Francisco for eleven years, admitted to Bly that he had never encountered such adverse weather. Hour after hour, day after day, the rain continued to beat down on the ship. Every day Bly anxiously waited for noon, when the figures for the most recent 24-hour run were posted in the dining room; each time she hoped that the ship would have gained a few miles on the day before, and each time she was disappointed. The Oceanic’s captain, William Smith, had earned the nickname “Typhoon Bill” for the skillful seamanship with which he brought his ships safely through fearsome storms on the China seas—but even Typhoon Bill could not maintain full speed in the face of such unrelenting wind."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"
14:00|"two in the day"|"The Oceanic had been designed to burn 58 tons of coal per day at regular cruising speed; when steaming at full power it required 70. This was by any standard a huge amount, but in fact was highly economical compared to newer ships like the Augusta Victoria, which burned an average of 220 tons of coal per day. A New York Times editorial called this amount “almost appalling,” but even it was modest in comparison to the latest class of ships that regularly consumed 300 tons of coal every twenty-four hours—“and if they could burn more,” a correspondent for The Cosmopolitan wrote in 1892, “it would be gladly supplied for the sake of an extra knot or two in the day’s run.” On these ships, as on the railroads, speed was a product of steam, and steam was a product of fire, and fire was a product of coal. Before setting out on its voyage a passenger steamship would be loaded with hundreds of tons of coal, all of it brought aboard by means that had barely progressed since the time of the pyramids. A small coal barge pulled up alongside the steamship; a bucket was lowered from the ship, and men aboard the barge shoveled the coal into the bucket. The bucket was unloaded into the ship’s hold, where trimmers delivered the coal in wheelbarrows to bunkers distributed around the ship, and then, when it was needed for burning, brought it from the bunkers to the fire room, in the lowest depths of the ship."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"

Wilson, told a reporter from the St. Louis Republic, “The steamer is due in this city the following Sunday and the company has promised us that every effort will be made to secure a quick passage.” Wilson said that he now felt confident that Bisland would win the race around the world."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"

Walker, as a longtime Cosmopolitan editor once remarked, was “a czar in his own world,” who was “firm that his orders should be carried out.” So it is not difficult to imagine his astonishment and distress when he received a cable from one of the Paris welcoming party informing him that Elizabeth Bisland had not gone to Paris after all, that La Champagne had waited at Le Havre until ten A.M. and had finally sailed without her, and that she was now apparently on her way to London."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"
04:30|"half past four in the morning"|"At half past four in the morning Elizabeth Bisland returned to the India mail train. She was already dressed, too confused and jangled to go back to sleep, so there was nothing to do but throw herself down on her seat and wait for the coming of day. When next the sun went down, she told herself, she would be in London. From London it was but a five-hour train ride to Southampton, where she could catch the fast steamship Ems the next day; the Ems was due into New York on January 27, making for an around-the-world trip of just under seventy-four days. Outside the sky slowly turned from black to gray. Here and there a thin plume of smoke curled up against the sky from the chimney of a thatched cottage. Peasants who seemed to have stepped out of a Millet canvas trudged along the road in heavy boots and homespun clothing, carrying sticks or baskets of potatoes and turnips. A cart full of milk jugs was being pulled, incongruously, by a large dog, while a woman wearing a cap and tucked-up skirts walked alongside, blowing on her fingers to keep them warm."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"It was ten o’clock when the train reached Calais. The ferry for Dover had just left and the next would not leave until one o’clock, so she had time to eat breakfast—a lucky break, as things turned out, for she would not eat again for another forty-eight hours. As she set out on the afternoon ferry the Channel was gray and stormy, the wind brisk, a spatter of rain splashing down every now and again. Some of the passengers, defying the rain, spread themselves out in chaise longues; others turned up the collars of their long coats, thrust their hands in the pockets, and strode along the rolling deck. Later the sun broke through the clouds, turning the sea a stormy gray-green—and there before her, appearing through the mists, were the cliffs of Dover. For a moment she stood transfixed, dazzled by the unexpected whiteness of the stone. The chalk cliffs jutted straight up from the water, as solid and immovable as the sea was restless and shifting, grand and dignified as any national monument. Nothing on this trip had moved her quite as much as that sight; it was worth a journey around the world, she told herself, just to have seen it. Two months earlier she had started out from a continent that English people had claimed as their own, where the English language, English laws and customs reigned from sea to sea; as far as she traveled she had heard that same language, seen the same laws, found the same people.

"ap 08:20"|8:20|"The Grand Hotel’s dining room had marble walls, electric lights in the gilt chandeliers, and carpeting so thick that a piece of cutlery, if accidentally dropped, would make no sound. The food was lavish in the French style, but Bisland was too tired and distraught to eat and only sipped at her wine and absentmindedly crumbled her bread. A reporter from the Paris News Association came to the table to talk to her. Elizabeth Bisland, he would later write, “was very much annoyed to learn that the fast steamer, Ems, which she had expected to meet at Southampton for home, had been taken off. Otherwise she would have been sure that her voyage would be a success. Now the Bothnia, at Queenstown, is the only boat available and, as it is a very slow one, she fears she will arrive in New York too late.” When dinner was over, her helpful friend from the India mail train arrived to accompany her to the Euston station, where the train for Holyhead was scheduled to depart at 8:20. He had brought with him traveling rugs and cushions, a spice cake in case she became hungry, and a stack of books and newspapers; on the train he made sure that her foot warmer was filled with hot water and directed the guard to give her his best care and attention. “There is a vast amount of chivalry and tenderness distributed in the hearts of men,” Bisland wrote in that same travel essay, “and while the woman who goes guarded may be quite unaware of it, because nothing in her case calls it forth, the chivalry is there, and ready for almost unlimited draughts upon its patience, devotion, and sympathy.”"|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"
12:00|noon|"Bisland felt wretched and grimy—she had not changed her clothes in nearly three days—and so worn down that the remarkable beauty of the passing landscape was scarcely able to revive her spirits. Filmy mists swept across the land like phantoms, the countryside a lush green even in January. It was Sunday now, she realized, watching the peasants tramp the muddy roads to church. These were faces, broad and ruddy, that she recognized from back home. She gazed at the sturdy young men, wondering idly how soon they would be mayors in New York or aldermen in Chicago, at the girls in their bunchy provincial dresses, whose daughters might someday be Washington society ladies wearing gowns made by Worth. The train kept up its incessant rattle. She tried reading one of her books, but the words danced on the page. Her hunger was making it difficult to concentrate. She had not eaten since the previous morning in Calais, nearly twenty-four hours before. She still had the spice cake, but it was very dry and she had nothing to wash it down with except a bit of brandy in a flask; after a few bites she choked on the cake and set it aside. Due to the late arrival of the Holyhead boat the train was running late and stopped only for the shortest possible time at each station, not long enough for her to get anything to eat. The train passed the beautiful city of Cork, with its fine old mansions and crumbling castles covered with ivy; half an hour later, at noon, it arrived at the railway station, dockside in Queenstown. The Bothnia, thankfully, had not yet arrived, the bad weather having delayed it as well, but the steamship was expected in just a few minutes. From the train Bisland’s luggage was sent down to the tender, and she went off quickly in search of food. The large and stately Queen’s Hotel was not far from the landing, but the bad luck that had followed her for the better part of two days required that the hotel kitchen should be undergoing repairs, and only by “frantic protest” did she manage to obtain from a kitchen worker a cup of cold, bitter tea and a bit of bread as limp and dingy as a scrub rag. Back at the terminal, one of the porters warned her that she should be ready at a moment’s notice to be summoned to the tender, for when the steamship was signaled offshore there would be no time to waste. Bisland found the ladies’ room and made her toilet as best she could—her toiletries case was in her Gladstone bag, aboard the tender—and then took a seat on a bench in the damp, chilly waiting room."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"
"ap < 06:00"|"near six o’clock"|"Hour after hour passed with no summons to the tender. The rain drummed on the roof; the wind whistled through the thin glass of the windows. In her exhaustion, the walls themselves seemed slightly to tremble. In the previous two days she had been in Italy, France, England, Wales, and now Ireland. This was not traveling, as Jules Verne had once observed about Phileas Fogg; it was only describing a circumference. All afternoon Bisland sat in the waiting room, as she later recalled it, “hopeless, helpless, overwhelmed with hunger, lack of sleep, and fatigue.” She closed her eyes and tried to summon her strength. Her wool overcoat hung heavily on her shoulders, soaked from the rain and the spray. She felt chilled to the bone; it would take time, she knew, to recover from her night on the Irish Sea, and now she was about to cross the Atlantic Ocean. In those two days she had been on a train, a boat, another train, another boat, and still another train. It was best not to think about those meals on the India mail train, the warming soup, the fresh bread and butter, especially the strong hot coffee. From the window a line of hills rose an irresolute gray, seeming to blend into the sky churning with low clouds. The gray and beamless atmosphere, Shelley had written of days like this one. Outside the station she could hear the cries of beggars imploring newly arrived travelers for pennies; here was the poverty of Ireland that had brought so many to New York. There had been beggars at the train stations of the American West, beggars in the harbors of Singapore and Aden, beggars outside the temples in Colombo. On this trip, as Scripture said, the poor had always been with her. Slowly the room darkened. Finally, near six o’clock, when her patience was at an end and she was demanding food from one of the station clerks, the long-awaited notice came: the Bothnia had been signaled, and the tender must be off."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"
12:00|noon|"The World cabled General Passenger Agent T. H. Goodman of the Southern Pacific Railroad, asking him to charter a special train to carry Nellie Bly from Oakland to Chicago by a southern route. According to one report, “The New York journal sent instructions to spare no expense in attaining the object desired.” Goodman immediately began consultations with officials of the Southern Pacific and Santa Fe Railroads, and at noon on Monday, January 20, the Queen, one of the Southern Pacific’s fastest locomotives, with the Pullman sleeper car San Lorenzo attached to it, was moved to the depot at the Oakland Mole, to be ready as soon as Bly’s steamship arrived. It would function as a regular train on the Southern Pacific system down through central California to Mojave, and then proceed east as a special train on the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad’s “New Mexico Southern” road east to Albuquerque; there it would switch to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe road, heading briefly northeast to La Junta, Colorado, before resuming a more direct eastward path to Kansas City and then on to Chicago. The Southern Pacific sent telegrams up and down the route instructing local companies to have the fastest engines and best men available as needed; extra engines were placed on side tracks, ready to be called into service in case of an emergency. Bly’s train was given a “regardless order,” which meant that it would have the right of way over everything else on the road. To make those accommodations from Mojave to Chicago, the Santa Fe railroad charged The World a dollar a mile, for a total of $2,190; Nellie Bly’s train ride across America thus cost more than all the other parts of her trip put together."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"

Jennings himself had no experience in the mountains—he had grown up in St. Louis and was a drama critic by trade—but a local miner named J. W. Deuel, who had lived in the Sierra for twenty-five years, agreed to guide him to Alta for a price of twenty-five dollars. At the Western Union office by the train station, Jennings sent a telegram to the division superintendent of the railroad asking that an engine be made available for a trip to Colfax or farther; almost immediately the superintendent cabled back granting the request. The telegraph operators warned Jennings that he was facing a desperate trek across the mountains at night. The summit had received twenty to thirty feet of snow, they reminded him, and there was a risk of snowslide at any time. A telegraph lineman had started out the night before from the nearby town of Summit and was thought to be lost in the snow; a Chinese laborer had perished in Towles, near Alta, within fifty feet of the train station.

Each man wore a buttoned-up overcoat, leather gloves, and a hat with flaps that covered his ears, and carried his skis on one shoulder and a snow pole on the other; each had on several pairs of socks and wore long rubber boots, keeping his shoes in his coat pockets. Earlier that day a rotary plow had dug out the railroad track from Emigrant Gap almost to Blue Canyon, five miles away, and the men walked in the cuts that the plow had made. The cuts ranged from eight to sixteen feet deep, making high walls of snow as smooth and solid as plaster; it was like walking down a narrow windowless corridor with no end. The great danger, of course, was that a train would come through and the men would be trapped on the track with no way to escape. This was a form of death not unheard of in the mountains. Each man, as he walked, listened for a distant whistle. The only light came from the orange glow of the lantern, which reflected eerily off the walls of snow. The amount of snowfall was almost unimaginable: only the very tops of the pine trees peeked above the snow lines, and the telegraph poles were buried up to their top arms. Once they passed an abandoned two-story house, covered in snow to the chimney. Above them the sky was blue-black; the snow crunched loudly underfoot. Just past midnight they arrived at Shady Run, two miles west of Blue Canyon. There the trail became indistinct: they would have to ski the remaining five miles to Alta."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"

They included the deputy collector of the Port of San Francisco, the inspector of customs, the superintendent of the Occidental and Oriental steamship line, and the port’s quarantine officer, who had to examine all of the ship’s passengers for smallpox before they would be allowed to come ashore. The lone reporter in the group was Charles Low of the San Francisco Examiner, who had been asked by The World to accompany Nellie Bly to New York in the event that John Jennings did not arrive in time."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"
"ap < 09:00"|"shortly before nine o’clock"|"The tugboat set out across San Francisco Bay for the brief trip to the Oakland Mole, where her train awaited. Bly stood by the capstan with her face to the salty breeze, taking in the sights: Goat Island, Angel Island, Alcatraz with its lighthouse and ring of cannons shining in the morning sun. She had seen none of this before, but after so long traveling in the East it all seemed reassuringly familiar. Slowly the dark mass at the end of the long pier differentiated into a crowd of people; as the tugboat drew closer she could see the excited, expectant faces. The tug pulled up and a gangway was thrown across, and shortly before nine o’clock, to the cheers of the onlookers, Nellie Bly set foot again on America. She waved and flashed that dazzling smile; she thought she had never felt a more exquisite happiness."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"

The San Lorenzo, one of the newest cars in the Pullman fleet, contained a buffet, drawing room, and observation parlor; the wood finishing was of mahogany and bird’s-eye maple, the upholstery was purple velvet. Settling in for the ride, Bly arranged the monkey cage with the bars facing outward so that McGinty could watch the country as it passed. Wilder and Donaldson would be escorting her as far as Port Costa, along with William A. Bissell, general freight and passenger agent of the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. As the train set off, Bissell asked Nellie Bly when she would like to arrive in New York. Bly inquired about Elizabeth Bisland, and looked relieved to hear that Bisland was then struggling with storms over the Atlantic. She considered Bissell’s question, her eyes seeming to darken as she furrowed her brows in calculation. “Not later than Saturday evening,” she replied after a moment, although privately she doubted they could get her there that quickly."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"
"ap 11:10"|"ten minutes past eleven"|"At ten minutes past eleven the train stopped for lunch in the little town of Lathrop, where the train would begin its journey south through central California. In Lathrop the train was held over in the station for four minutes, an unanticipated development but one that Bly understood when she looked up and saw, coming through the vestibule into the car, The World’s own John J. Jennings, just off the train from Sacramento and ready to take his place as Nellie Bly’s Escort Corps. As the train sped south, Jennings related to the others the story of his remarkable overnight trek across the mountains. Not surprisingly, he still seemed shaken by the events of the previous days. “I have seen snow and blizzards in New York,” he said wonderingly, “but the people back there don’t know what snow is.” Jennings was by nature self-effacing, but his reputation had been made: in the news stories the reporters sent back east he was already being referred to as “Snowshoe” Jennings."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"
"ap < 01:00"|"Just before one o’clock"|"Just before one o’clock the train stopped in Merced. A large crowd, all dressed in their best clothes, had gathered around the station. Bly assumed that the people were having a picnic, and was amazed to hear that they were waiting for her. In answer to the crowd’s calls she stepped out to the train’s back platform, prompting a cheer so loud that, as she recalled later, it “almost frightened me to death.” Immediately the town band struck up a chorus of “My Nellie’s Blue Eyes,” the popular song that in the coming days she would hear more times than she could count. Afterward, a delegation of fifty townswomen visited Bly in her car to wish her Godspeed. Someone passed her a large tray of fruit and nuts and candy, the tribute of a local newsboy; Bly remarked that she was more grateful than if it had been the gift of a king."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"

Four staff members of the Fresno Evening Expositor brought aboard a large basket of fruits and wines, all products of Fresno County, to present to Bly. Soon the bell rang and the crowd filed slowly out of the vestibule. As the train pulled away from the depot, Nellie Bly stepped back onto the platform of her car and waved her cap to the crowd standing below; in response the men waved their hats, the women raised their handkerchiefs, and everyone gave a parting cheer."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"As the sun rose, the train began to climb into the mountains; by ten o’clock, at Williams, Arizona, the elevation was more than eight thousand feet. After the station stop at Williams, the engineer surprised Nellie Bly by inviting her to ride in the cab, and even to operate the throttle, for much of the thirty-one miles to Flagstaff. Bly was thrilled by the unexpected opportunity and took it for all it was worth, pushing the throttle as far as the engineer would allow; sometimes, when he wasn’t looking, she nudged it just a bit further, and on the straight stretches of road she pushed it open as far as it would go, until she was sure that nothing had ever run so fast over the Atlantic and Pacific line. For The World Nellie Bly had learned to ride a bicycle, which she called “the most delightfully perfect amusement ever invented or imagined,” because it came closer than anything else to satisfying her lifelong desire to fly; but riding a bicycle was nothing compared to this. The air roared in her ears—she had to shout at the engineer, right next to her, just to be heard—and the telegraph poles flashed by like lightning. One man standing near the track, she was delighted to see, had to hold his hat on his head as the train went whizzing past. Ahead of her the snowy crown of Flagstaff Mountain rose in the distance; as the track curved, the mountain would appear first on one side of the engine and then the other, and Bly watched it loom closer and closer all the way to the end of her run. For a woman to operate a locomotive was highly unusual, and it was an achievement of which she was very proud. The next day she told a reporter from the Philadelphia Inquirer, “For a new engineer the master mechanic said I was a rushing success.”"|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"
16:00|"four o’clock in the afternoon"|"At four o’clock in the afternoon the train crossed the state line into New Mexico. The Navajo reservation was about twenty miles south of the railroad tracks, near the town of Gallup, and Bly saw many Indians on horseback riding nearby. The Rand McNally guide to the area advised travelers that the Navajos “display their only interest in civilization by looking at the trains. There is no telling what they think of the innovation.” Just east of Gallup, railroad men were repairing a bridge that spanned a deep ravine. While the repairs were in progress the bridge was held up only by jackscrews, without the girders that normally helped to support it. Hearing Bly’s unscheduled train coming, the workmen frantically tried to flag it down before it reached the bridge, but they were too late and they watched helplessly as it thundered past at fifty miles an hour, over the weakened bridge and safely across to the other side. “The escape is a miraculous one,” The World marveled the next day, “and section men who witnessed the train flash past on the frail structure regard the escape as one of the most miraculous in railway history.”"|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"

The 134 miles between Dodge City and Hutchinson were covered in exactly 134 minutes; east of Ellinwood, seven miles were made in six minutes. “It is doubtful whether such marvelous speed has ever before been made on the Santa Fe line,” noted the Topeka Daily Capital. Nellie Bly thoroughly enjoyed it. “This is the way I like to travel,” she called happily to one of the reporters.

10:30|"ten-thirty in the morning"|"The Pennsylvania Railroad train to New York, known as the Atlantic Express No. 20, departed at ten-thirty in the morning. Nellie Bly had been given exclusive use of the rear parlor car, the Ilion; it was, in the words of one reporter aboard the train, “a perfect bower of beauty and comfort.” The walls were painted a peacock blue, set off by curtains and lambrequins of fawn gray. The stateroom was already full of flowers sent by well-wishers—so full, in fact, that many more had to be left behind. In one corner of the room sat the red and gold temple chair from Hong Kong; on the wall hung a Japanese mandolin that Bly was saying had been a gift from a prince in Yokohama. Just before the train started east, a telegram intended to have been delivered in San Francisco was handed to her. It read: “Mr. Verne wishes the following message to be handed to Nellie Bly the moment she touches American soil: Monsieur and Madame Jules Verne address their sincere felicitations to Miss Nellie Bly at the moment when that intrepid young lady sets foot on the soil of America.”"|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"
"ap > 08:00"|"after eight o’clock"|"The closer the train got to New York, it seemed, the louder and more demonstrative the crowds became. Though it was after eight o’clock when the train arrived in Columbus, Ohio, more than five hundred men and women were waiting at the station to greet Nellie Bly. It was an outpouring with no precedent in recent memory. The Columbus station-master told a reporter from Pittsburgh, “When ex-President Cleveland passed through here in ’87, and in ’88 when President Harrison utilized the same railway portals, I thought I had seen crowds and heard noise that came near the limit of pandemonium, but this ovation to Nellie Bly tonight tops the record.” The people were lined many deep along the entire length of the train platform and into the station itself, and as the train stopped they called to her to come out so they could see her; and when she appeared at the rear of the train they surged toward her with such speed and force that a phalanx of blue-suited policemen formed themselves into a wall in front of the car, and so they had to content themselves with giving three cheers several times as Bly smiled and waved her cap and bowed at them. Noted the Cincinnati Commercial, “Miss Bly is about twenty years old, of medium build, with dark hair, piercing eyes, and a bewitching smile. She captured the crowd as soon as she appeared.”"|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"
00:34|"12:34 A.M."|"The train remained in the station for only a few minutes, just long enough to change engines, and then set off east again. Only three stops remained before Pittsburgh, in Newark, Dennison, and Steubenville. In Steubenville a crowd of two hundred was waiting for her in the cold and dark. It was then 12:34 A.M., the beginning of the last day of her journey. Inside the Ilion, a sense of anticipation hung in the air; the talk was carried on in low tones. In the distance, the orange glow from open furnaces and coke ovens seemed to turn the dark river into molten lava. “There is the Ohio,” Bly observed at one point, glancing out the window. “I’m nearing dear old Pittsburgh.” Before long she excused herself to rest for a couple of hours. It had been an especially long, eventful day—the meeting with the men of the Chicago Press Club already seemed ages ago—and she had gotten almost no sleep the night before. She wanted to be alert for the friends and colleagues she expected would be there to greet her in Pittsburgh."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"

Inside the Ilion, she was warmly embraced by relatives and friends, and a delegation of local newspapermen offered hearty congratulations to their former colleague. The reporter from the Pittsburg Press gave her his silver press badge to wear; delighted, Bly pinned it to her dress and promised to return it when she got to New York. That was the dress in which she had raced around the world; that dress, the reporter noted silently, was now historical."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"
18:32|"6:32 P.M."|"The French Line steamship La Champagne, which Elizabeth Bisland had hoped to meet at Le Havre, ran into the same North Atlantic storms that assailed so many other ships that January. Like the others its decks were swept, its riggings ice-coated, its railings damaged, but the steamer managed to sail through a maddening week of calms and squalls with no loss other than a few lifeboats. On the eighth day at sea, Harper’s Weekly reported later, “her people were treated to a display of nature’s handiwork which they are not likely to forget as long as they live”: south of Greenland near the Newfoundland coast, La Champagne encountered three massive icebergs amid a vast field of heaving ice. The icebergs were tinted the bluish-green of a tropical sea; the tallest rose some two hundred feet above the waterline, its sides as intricately faceted as a square-cut diamond. On board the passengers marveled at the shifting effects of light and shade as the ship slowly plowed its way through the ice field until the icebergs were out of sight. The weather was fine for the rest of the voyage, and La Champagne arrived at Sandy Hook—the spit of land that set the outer limit of New York’s waters—at 6:32 P.M. on January 27. The normally fast and reliable steamer was two days overdue; if Elizabeth Bisland had taken La Champagne, as planned, her trip would have been completed in seventy-four days and thirty-two minutes."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"

It stopped before the Seventeenth Street signal tower, where a shifter engine nimbly detached the rear car of the train and backed it up fifty feet; the Atlantic then rolled in under the iron-roofed train shed to Track 3, coming to a halt with a great wheeze and last puff of white smoke as the shifter pushed the Ilion onto a special track.

The trees on the hillside were bare now; at Princeton the clustered blue and gray slate roofs of the College of New Jersey rolled across the window like a moving diorama. The train passed New Brunswick, Rahway, Trenton, suburban towns with wide streets and handsome houses. From the dining car, where lunch was being served, Nellie Bly looked out at the people waiting at each of the stations. The train, they must have known, would not even be stopping; they just wanted to wave hello and call a welcome and perhaps catch a glimpse of the young globe-trotter about whom they had heard so much. “I feel a little like a presidential candidate,” Bly had remarked back in New Mexico, when her cross-country trip, with all the bouquets and brass bands, was starting to take on the festive trappings of a whistle-stop tour. Now, though, she was actually drawing crowds as large and enthusiastic as the ones that turned out for presidential candidates, and even for sitting presidents: “Poor Nellie’s hand was worked harder than President Harrison’s limb was ever pumped,” one Philadelphia newspaper had noted. As she sat with her mother and Cora Linn Daniels in the dining car, Bly sipped her champagne and picked at her salad, too excited and exhausted to eat. She had barely slept since setting foot on the western edge of the United States, and now the eastern edge was just ahead. The conversation at the table was desultory; there was so much to say it was difficult to know how to begin. Of course she was delighted to be returning home again—and ahead of time—but this train ride had been so enjoyable she almost hated for it to end. It was approaching three o’clock in the afternoon. She wondered where she would be at this time the next day, and the day after that.

20:30|"eight-thirty P.M."|"NELLIE BLY’S TOUR began auspiciously, at the Union Square Theatre in New York, where J. M. Hill had booked her to lecture for three successive Sunday evenings. (This would not have been especially difficult for him to arrange, as he owned the theater.) The Union Square Theatre was widely considered to be one of the most beautiful in New York. From the entrance, a broad columned portico on Fourteenth Street, patrons passed through a brilliantly lit vestibule to the auditorium, which was painted white and ornamented throughout with gold fluting. Across the ceiling ran a series of frescoes depicting figures from Greek mythology; the proscenium arch had been painted maroon with gold at the bottom edge to simulate drapery. The auditorium held about twelve hundred seats in three steeply rising tiers, and on the evening of February 9 they were all filled with well-dressed New Yorkers. On the stage, furniture had been arranged in a typical drawing-room scene; it was the set for the other show currently playing at the theater, The County Fair, a comedy starring the popular female impersonator Neil Burgess as the spinster aunt Abigail Prue. At eight-thirty P.M., J. M. Hill himself walked onto the stage, coming down to the footlights to briefly address the audience. He was a handsome man in his middle years, his most distinguishing feature a pair of bushy sideburns; a few years earlier The New York Times had described him as resembling “a particularly good-looking curate.”"|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"
"ap 04:30"|four-thirty|"At the close of the London season Bisland left the city for Oxford, where she took lodgings at 26 Holywell Street, a three-story stone house on a narrow medieval lane. Directly across the way was Rhoda Broughton’s house, where in the oak-ceilinged drawing room, with her two pugs and Yorkshire terrier sleeping in baskets by the fireplace, friends gathered for tea at four-thirty each afternoon. Broughton also hosted regular gatherings of Oxford’s Browning Society, where the guests occasionally included Robert Browning himself. It was the type of literary salon, full of warm hospitality and intelligent, animated conversation, to which Bisland had gravitated since her earliest days in New Orleans."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"
00:00|midnight|"In her sorrow Bisland turned to gardening for relief. The previous fall she had planted daffodils, jonquils, crocus bulbs, in the fervent hope that a show of blossoms might celebrate peace in the spring; spring came with still no peace, but the blossoms at least had arrived. In the grounds near her house she created a wildflower sanctuary; up early every morning, she worked the soil with basket and spade. Hard work at the beginning of the day, she had found, brought better sleep at the end, and in the meantime it kept her from thinking too much about her own sorrows and those of the wider world. She read every night, turning out the light only reluctantly at midnight, resentful at not being able to plunge into the next chapter. Reading had always been for her a doorway into another world, but now it became something more, an anodyne that dulled aches, an opiate that stilled the incessant turning over of questions that had no answers. She described herself, in those days, as a clock with a broken mainspring. “If you shake me hard I tick for a few moments, but soon relapse into silence and uselessness.”"|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"

"ap 10:30"|"half past ten"|"ON THE MORNING OF NOVEMBER 14, as Nellie Bly made her way to the Hoboken docks, a man named John Brisben Walker was on a ferry headed in the opposite direction, bound from Jersey City to Cortlandt Street in lower Manhattan. Walker was the wealthy publisher of a high-toned monthly magazine called The Cosmopolitan (in later years it would be purchased by Joseph Pulitzer’s rival William Randolph Hearst and subsequently assume a very different character), and as the ferry crossed the river he read The World’s front-page article revealing Nellie Bly’s plan to race around the world. Instantly he recognized the publicity value of such a scheme, even as it occurred to him that a world traveler might do better by heading west rather than east as Bly was planning to do. At once an idea suggested itself: The Cosmopolitan would sponsor its own competitor in the around-the-world race, traveling in the opposite direction. Of course, The Cosmopolitan’s circumnavigator would have to be, like Bly, a young woman—there was a pleasing symmetry to the notion, and in any case a man racing against a woman would never win anyone’s sympathy—and she would have to leave immediately, if she was to have any chance at all of returning to New York before Nellie Bly. After a quick conference at the office with his business manager, John Brisben Walker sent him off to a travel agency to prepare an itinerary, and at half past ten he sent a message to Elizabeth Bisland’s apartment, only a few blocks away in Murray Hill. It was urgent, he indicated; she should come to the office at once."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"

Bly did her best to smile, so that her friends’ last recollections of her would be cheering ones. Her head felt suddenly dizzy, and her heart, she would say later, felt as if it were about to burst. Her friends moved slowly away, joining the line of other well-dressed people making their way down the gangplank. From the railing of the ship she could see for miles; out toward the horizon the water turned imperceptibly from blue to gray. The world seemed to have lost its roundness, become a long distance with no end. The moment of departure was at hand. Solemnly Nellie Bly and the man from the New York Athletic Club synchronized their watches."|"Eighty Days"|"Matthew Goodman"
