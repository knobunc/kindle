After he left the Court at five-thirty p.m., my client took a taxi to a discreet address in Devonshire Place which was known to house a massage parlour offering more exotic services to regular and affluent clients. He emerged and took another taxi to an Indian restaurant in Kensington High Street, where he ate Tandoori chicken with vegetable curry and drank mineral water and strong black tea. He walked to the Kensington Odeon, where he chose the screen presenting Message in a Bottle starring Kevin Costner. He left the cinema shortly after ten, visibly moved."|"Rumpole Rests His Case"|"John Mortimer"

At 19.15 the young girl I know as a part-time babysitter rang at the bell and was admitted by Hedwig, the au pair, whom I knew from past enquiries to be due for her evening off. At 19.30 a radio taxicab arrived. At 19.35 Dame Phillida Erskine-Brown (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Judge’) emerged from the house and entered the said radio cab. I followed in the vehicle in which I had kept observation (details of petrol charges and mileage are included in the overall sum set out at the foot of this report). The taxi took the Judge to the Ivy restaurant in West Street. I was able to observe her enter the restaurant and I should at this juncture make it clear that the Judge was dressed, as I would phrase it, ‘up to the nines’. She was wearing a well-cut black dress, with several pieces of jewellery. I came to the conclusion that she had come to meet ‘someone special’, and subsequent events confirmed this view.I was fortunate to secure a parking spot and I approached the Ivy restaurant on foot. A man of Irish extraction wearing a top hat tried to prevent my entry but I told him I was booked in and walked past him. The young lady in charge of the coats was similarly discouraging. However, I got past the glass doors into the dining area and was met by a further young woman in a black trouser suit. I again claimed to have a booking and, as she went to check at the desk, I was able to obtain a view of the assembled diners.I have to report that the Judge was there with another man. They were both smiling, and talking in an animated manner. Her hand was on the table and he was holding it. During the minutes for which I kept observation, the Judge made no attempt to withdraw her hand. I would describe the man in question as ‘furtive’, ‘sly looking’, ‘talkative' and not, I would have thought, ‘attractive to women’. He had mouse-coloured, receding hair, a weak chin and wore spectacles and a dark, pinstriped suit. Before I could approach the table more closely, the girl in the black trouser suit, by now accompanied by a small Maître d' with a determined look and a trace of a cockney accent, told me in no uncertain terms that I had no booking for that night or indeed any other night, and he invited me to leave immediately. As I left the Ivy restaurant, the man in the top hat suggested he call me a cab. I declined, having my own transport and not wishing to put the client to further expense.At 22.00 hours the Judge left the Ivy restaurant with the ‘furtive-looking' man I have previously described. He seemed to be looking about him in some fear of observation, but he didn't notice me in my vehicle parked up in the shadows of West Street. The parties got into another cab. I noticed that the Judge gave money to the man in the top hat, her date of the evening having clearly protested that he had ‘no change’.At 22.15 the parties stopped outside a large building, in clear need of a lick of paint, in one of the streets behind Whitehall. I was able to follow them into the hallway, where the ‘furtive man' asked a sleepy porter for ‘The key to my bedroom.’ They both then took a lift to an upper floor. I was unable to follow as the sleepy porter asked me my business, and when I said, ‘Just looking around. What is this place?’, he said, ‘The Sheridan Club. Members Only' and instructed me, again in no uncertain terms, to leave. Seated in my vehicle, I kept observation on the entrance of the Sheridan Club until 03.00 hours on the nineteenth. Neither the Judge nor the ‘furtive' companion had emerged by that time, from which I deduced that intimacy had undoubtedly taken place.‘“Furtive! Sly looking! Weak-chinned!

If made by our clerk, Henry, or one of the Timsons, or even my most regular client and solicitor, Bonny Bernard, it would have seemed no more than a background noise in the meaningless chatter of everyday life. None of those people would have thought of making any sort of amorous approach to Mizz Liz. Had she turned to face them, they would have been almost deferential in their approach. But this was Soapy Sam, leading light of the Lawyers as Christians, tied, you might say cocooned, by his marriage to Matey, the formidable nursing sister who manned the casualty room at the Old Bailey, ready with cough sweets or Elastoplasts and calming words for lawyers attacked by disappointed clients or the victims of bungled attempts at suicide. To hear Ballard, who had adopted self-righteousness as a way of life and regarded the lighting up of a small cheroot as a breakdown in public morality, use such an expression about any member of the Bar was like hearing a bishop break out into a couple of verses of ‘The Good Ship Venus' during evensong.
