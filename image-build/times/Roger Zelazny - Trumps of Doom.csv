"ap 03:00"|"three o'clock"|"“On the way out, set that sign for three o'clock and let the bolt in the door snap shut again.”"|"Trumps of Doom"|"Roger Zelazny"
"ap 01:00"|one|"The altar toppled backward. The wizard scurried to avoid it, but it struck one—perhaps both—of his legs. Immediately, as he fell to the ground, I felt the spell depart from me. I could move properly again and my mind was clear."|"Trumps of Doom"|"Roger Zelazny"
"> 12:00"|"a little after noon"|"“I checked his room in the morning. It was just as I'd left it. I went by the desk. Nothing, like I said. Then I had breakfast and I checked again. Nothing again. So I took a long walk around the town. Got back a little after noon, had lunch, and tried the room again. It was the same. I borrowed the car keys then and drove back up to the place we'd been the night before. No sign of anything unusual there, looking at it in the light of day. I even climbed down the slope and hunted around. No body, no clues. I drove back, replaced the keys, hung around the hotel till dinner time, ate, then called you. After you told me to come on up, I made a reservation and went to bed early. Caught the Shuttlejack this morning and flew here from Albuquerque.”"|"Trumps of Doom"|"Roger Zelazny"
"ap 02:00"|"two o'clock"|"“Let's head on back and drive into town for lunch. I want to stop by the office and pick up some papers and make some phone calls. Then I have to see a client at two o'clock. You can take the car and knock around while I'm doing that.”"|"Trumps of Doom"|"Roger Zelazny"
"> 00:00"|"a little after midnight"|"The drive back was uneventful, and no one followed us. We got in a little after midnight, said good night, and I went straight to my room. I shrugged out of my new jacket and hung it in the closet, kicked off my new shoes and left them there, too. As I walked back into the room, I noticed the white rectangle on the pillow of my bed."|"Trumps of Doom"|"Roger Zelazny"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"“The bar at a country club in the place I just came from,” I replied. “I'm supposed to meet an unknown party there at ten, local time. Hopefully, I will obtain information as to who has been trying to kill me, and why, and possibly even learn something of other matters that have been troubling me.”"|"Trumps of Doom"|"Roger Zelazny"
"ap 09:48"|9:48|"After several moments, the scene took on depth and color. I sank into the emerging textures, and everything advanced toward me, growing larger, crowding out my immediate surroundings. My gaze sought the wall clock I remembered; to the right of the bar...
9:48.
I couldn't have cut things much closer."|"Trumps of Doom"|"Roger Zelazny"
"ap 10:00"|"Ten o'clock"|"Ten o'clock came and went. So did a few patrons, new and old. None of them seemed particularly interested in me, though my own attention was drawn to an unescorted young lady with pale hair and a cameolike profile, which ends the resemblance because cameos don't smile much and she did the second time she glanced at me, right before she looked away. Damn, I thought, why did I have to be wrapped up in a life-and-death situation? Under almost any other circumstances I would have finished the beer, walked over for another, passed a few pleasantries, then asked her whether she'd care to join me. In fact..."|"Trumps of Doom"|"Roger Zelazny"
"ap 10:20"|10:20|"I glanced at the clock.
10:20.
How much longer should I give the mystery voice? Should I just assume it had been George Hensen, and that he'd given up on tonight when he'd seen me fade? How much longer might the lady hang around?"|"Trumps of Doom"|"Roger Zelazny"
"ap 10:25"|10:25|"I growled softly. Stick to business. I studied the narrowness of her waist, the swell of her hips, the tension of her shoulders...
10:25.
I noticed that my mug was empty. I took it over for a refill. Dutifully, I watched the progress of the mug."|"Trumps of Doom"|"Roger Zelazny"
"ap 10:45"|10:45|"“Oh, I've spent a lot of time there. What do you do?” I resisted a sudden impulse to tell her that I was a sorcerer, and instead described my recent employment at Grand Design. She, I learned in turn, had been a model, a buyer for a large store, and later manager of a boutique. I glanced at the clock.
It was 10:45. She caught the look.
“I think we've both been stood up,” she said."|"Trumps of Doom"|"Roger Zelazny"
"ap 11:00"|"Eleven o'clock"|"Eleven o'clock came and went. I'd finished my drink and the food, and I didn't really want another."|"Trumps of Doom"|"Roger Zelazny"
"ap 11:30"|eleven-thirty|"At eleven-thirty we checked the bar. There were several couples there, but her date wasn't. And no one even gave me a nod. We returned to the music."|"Trumps of Doom"|"Roger Zelazny"
