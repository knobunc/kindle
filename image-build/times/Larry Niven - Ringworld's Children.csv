"< 12:00"|"toward noon"|"The Arch—the far side of the Ringworld—arced from horizon to horizon, broad above the haze at the spinward and antispin horizons, narrowing toward noon where it passed behind the sun. Louis hadn’t seen the Arch in some time."|"Ringworld's Children"|"Larry Niven"
12:00|noonday|"The terminator, the shadow of the edge of a shadow square, swept over them. A growing sliver of sun became a noonday glare. How long had it been since Louis saw a sunrise?"|"Ringworld's Children"|"Larry Niven"
12:00|noon|"The light should have grabbed his attention. But Louis was facing Roxanny and Claus and two guns. His mind caught up too slowly. Hidden or not, the sun is always at noon. That couldn’t be the sun."|"Ringworld's Children"|"Larry Niven"
12:00|noon|"Louis didn’t answer. What should “Luis Tamasan” know about this? But shadows just didn’t happen in a place where it was always noon, and Louis Wu found it freaky."|"Ringworld's Children"|"Larry Niven"
12:00|noon|"Shadows ticked at the corners of her vision. Tree shadows wouldn’t move in this weird place where it was always noon or night. Roxanny became sure that there were animals in the forest, watching them."|"Ringworld's Children"|"Larry Niven"
12:00|noon|"So she temporized. “We learned a lot before any ship landed. It’s always noon here. I expect that could drive a person nuts. If you ever saw a sunset, it would be the end of the world.”"|"Ringworld's Children"|"Larry Niven"
12:00|midday|"Wembleth and Roxanny went out again after breakfast.
Proserpina was back at midday. She asked, “What are stepping disks?”
“Where did you find those?”"|"Ringworld's Children"|"Larry Niven"
12:00|noon|"An inner ring of shadow squares block the sun, giving periods of night; else it would always be noon. A system of pipes leads from the bottoms of oceans, under the Ringworld floor, up the back of the rim wall and over the edge, to recycle seabottom ooze (or flup) into spill mountains. Huge attitude jets stand atop the rim wall, Bussard ramjets using the solar wind of protons for their fuel, to hold the Ringworld against its inherent instability. There are spaceport ledges outside the walls. Two vast salt oceans serve as preserves for seagoing life, and as something more: maps of several worlds at one-to-one scale. The Ringworld floor is of unnaturally strong material, dubbed scrith, with other unusual properties."|"Ringworld's Children"|"Larry Niven"
