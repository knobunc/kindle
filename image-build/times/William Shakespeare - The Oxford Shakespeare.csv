"ap 06:00"|six|"John Shakespeare’s position in Stratford-upon-Avon would have brought certain privileges to his family. When young William was four years old he could have had the excitement of seeing his father, dressed in furred scarlet robes and wearing the alderman’s official thumb-ring, regularly accompanied by two mace-bearing sergeants in buff, presiding at fairs and markets. A little later, he would have begun to attend a ‘petty school’ to acquire the rudiments of an education that would be continued at the King’s New School, an established grammar school with a well-qualified master, assisted by an usher to help with the younger pupils. We have no lists of the school’s pupils in Shakespeare’s time, but his father’s position would have qualified him to attend, and the school offered the kind of education that lies behind the plays and poems. Its boy pupils, aged from about eight to fifteen, endured an arduous routine. Classes began early in the morning: at six, normally; hours were long, holidays infrequent. Education was centred on Latin; in the upper forms, the speaking of English was forbidden. A scene (4.1) in The Merry Wives of Windsor showing a schoolmaster taking a boy named William through his Latin grammar draws on the officially approved textbook, William Lily’s Short Introduction of Grammar, and, no doubt, on Shakespeare’s memories of his youth."|"The Oxford Shakespeare"|"William Shakespeare"

The circumstance I’ll tell you more at large. 
The tenth of August last, this dreadful lord, 
Retiring from the siege of Orléans, 
Having full scarce six thousand in his troop, 
By three-and-twenty thousand of the French 
Was round encompassed and set upon. 
No leisure had he to enrank his men. 
He wanted pikes to set before his archers—
Instead whereof, sharp stakes plucked out of hedges 
They pitched in the ground confusedly, 
To keep the horsemen off from breaking in. 
More than three hours the fight continued, 
Where valiant Talbot above human thought 
Enacted wonders with his sword and lance. 
Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him; 
Here, there, and everywhere, enraged he slew. 
The French exclaimed the devil was in arms: 
All the whole army stood agazed on him. 
His soldiers, spying his undaunted spirit, 
‘A Talbot! A Talbot!’ cried out amain, 
And rushed into the bowels of the battle. 
Here had the conquest fully been sealed up, 
If Sir John Fastolf had not played the coward. 
He, being in the vanguard placed behind, 
With purpose to relieve and follow them, 
Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke. 
Hence grew the general wrack and massacre. 
Enclosèd were they with their enemies. 
A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin’s grace, 
Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back—

The play is full of details that would have been familiar to Elizabethan Londoners, and the language is colloquial and up to date. The plot, however, is made up of conventional situations whose ancestry is literary rather than realistic. There are many analogues to Shakespeare’s basic plot situations in medieval and other tales, some in books that he probably or certainly knew. The central story, of Sir John’s unsuccessful attempts to seduce Mistress Page and Mistress Ford, and of Master Ford’s unfounded jealousy, is in the tradition of the Italian novella, and may have been suggested by Ser Giovanni Fiorentino’s II Pecorone (1558). Alongside it Shakespeare places the comical but finally romantic love story of Anne Page, wooed by the foolish but rich Abraham Slender and the irascible French Doctor Caius, but won by the young and handsome Fenton. The play contains a higher proportion of prose to verse than any other play by Shakespeare, and the action is often broadly comic; but it ends, after the midnight scene in Windsor Forest during which Sir John is frightened out of his lechery, in forgiveness and love."|"The Oxford Shakespeare"|"William Shakespeare"

My reasons are most strong, and you shall know them

May token to the future our past deeds.

With all his convent, honourably received him,

An old man broken with the storms of state 
Is come to lay his weary bones among ye. 
Give him a little earth, for charity.’

Pursued him still, and three nights after this,
