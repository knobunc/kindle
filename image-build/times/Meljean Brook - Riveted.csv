"< 00:00"|"almost midnight"|"A glance at his pocket watch told him that it was almost midnight. Annika’s shift would be over in a few minutes…but he wouldn’t seek her out. Her intention to spend every moment of this journey with him probably didn’t include the moments in the middle of the night."|Riveted|"Meljean Brook"
"ap 07:56"|four-to-eight|"It seemed only seconds after Annika had fallen into a fitful sleep that Elena nudged her awake again. Blearily, she glanced at the clock. Ten minutes until the four-to-eight watch began. A month of this would kill her."|Riveted|"Meljean Brook"
00:00|midnight|"“We’ll wait. Komlan said di Fiore had a camp on the southern rim; we’re probably there now. If so, this submersible might not be manned overnight. Most of the camp should be asleep by midnight. We’ll go then.”"|Riveted|"Meljean Brook"
00:00|midnight|"She put such imaginings away for now; she had more important matters to consider, such as not dying. They wouldn’t be in a rush at midnight, and could spend more time collecting the items needed for a trek through the snow. Food from the galley kitchen—and knives, too. More spark lighters and kindling. If her pack had been soaked, she would need another coat. Her wet boots posed a serious problem; she couldn’t walk on frozen feet. Most of the crew would have been wearing theirs when they’d abandoned ship, and few would have an extra pair lying about. They were simply too expensive."|Riveted|"Meljean Brook"
"> 12:00"|"after noon"|"David never got the chance. The distant thrum of an airship engine alerted him after noon. It flew south of them—heading west. Returning to the rail camp, and hopefully abandoning the search."|Riveted|"Meljean Brook"
"~ 12:00"|"Around noon"|"Around noon, David wagered. He’d seen the airship returning to the rail camp. “Is he coming back with supplies?”"|Riveted|"Meljean Brook"
00:00|midnight|"She agreed. They could be in Vik by midnight. “We need to fire up that balloon so it’ll be hot enough by the time we’re ready to go.”"|Riveted|"Meljean Brook"
"ap > 06:00"|"just after six"|"Oh, blast. It was just after six now. Lorenzo had probably timed it so they’d have time to reach the ship…but not wait so long that they wouldn’t see the launch."|Riveted|"Meljean Brook"
12:00|noon|"They couldn’t have left, anyway. It snowed that night and through the next day. David ventured outside a few times to dig the entrance clear, but spent most of the day in the snow dome, reading to Annika from his journal. The next noon, the snow stopped. He crawled out and looked south. Only a few wisps of steam and ash still rose from the volcano. No animal tracks marked the fresh snow, though he searched through the afternoon for any sign. When he returned to the snow house, they shared the last piece of flatbread, stuffed their belongings into one pack, and decided to leave the next day."|Riveted|"Meljean Brook"
"> 12:00"|"A few minutes after noon"|"Every step was an effort. The nanoagents made him stronger, but the strength couldn’t last with nothing to fuel it. He trudged on anyway, fighting past the burning ache in his chest, the muscles that shook when he stopped to rest. A few minutes after noon, her arms fell away from his shoulders. David’s heart didn’t beat again until he felt her thin pulse. Abandoning the pole, he reached behind, bent over and held her against his back. He trudged on."|Riveted|"Meljean Brook"
