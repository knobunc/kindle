09:30|"nine-thirty that same morning"|"Over breakfast afterward—and it was Ava who remarked that it was still unbelievably only nine-thirty that same morning—they said nothing about what had just happened. The sudden wordless episode, the snatched sex in the room, seemed as remote as the long disruptive flight, the annoying passengers, the unhelpful taxi driver, the fiesta and its masks and costumes."|"Blinding Light"|"Paul Theroux"
"ap 01:00"|one|"He hoped the trip might result in a book, and perhaps he could make it one, part of the novel he had planned, an in-search-of book, exaggerating the dangers, profiling the people, attributing the sexual experiences he had already unexpectedly enjoyed, masked and blindfolded in the Quito hotel, to someone else, who perhaps he could say had bared his soul to him—or, coming completely clean, using his relationship with Ava. This travel-book-as-fiction would include food, drugs, sex, exotic landscapes, remoteness—snowcapped peaks rising above the green heat; the jungle in the shadow of Cotopaxi; romantic failure, disillusionment, disappointment; a breakup book, more about trespassing than Trespassing had been."|"Blinding Light"|"Paul Theroux"
"ap 05:08"|"Five eight"|"“Listen, want to hear something totally awesome?” Hack said to the others. Then he spoke to Wood in the tone of a quizmaster: “Edgar Allan Poe?”
“Five eight,” Wood said.
“Marquis de Sade?”"|"Blinding Light"|"Paul Theroux"
"ap 05:03"|"Five three"|"“Marquis de Sade?”
“Five three.”
Ava said, “William Burroughs.”"|"Blinding Light"|"Paul Theroux"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"It was after midnight when they entered the empty streets, lurid in the glare of small orangy light bulbs, traveling first on a bumpy road and then the uneven pavement of the main street, flanked by the same ocherous shadows. All the shops were shuttered and dark. Only a handful of shadow-faced people lurked by pillars in the arcades, where some open fires were glowing, cut off oil drums serving as braziers. Ava and Steadman were first off the bus, and even in the semidarkness, smelling dampness, ant-chewed wood, moistened dirt, dog shit, rusty pipes, and the smutty smoke from the braziers, they sensed the town was ugly—not old but hastily built, a kind of blight in the jungle, a sudden wasteland of dead trees, a slum smelling of blackened pots and stale bread and frying and decay. Another stink in the air was subtly toxic, the sour-creamy tang of fuel oil."|"Blinding Light"|"Paul Theroux"
12:00|noon|"“Meet back here at noon,” Nestor said. “Hernán will go with you. If you get lost, ask for the Colombiana.”"|"Blinding Light"|"Paul Theroux"
09:00|"nine in the morning"|"Steadman glanced at his watch. “It’s nine in the morning. The whorehouses are open now?”"|"Blinding Light"|"Paul Theroux"
"~ 11:00"|Elevenses|"The rest of them ate impatiently, hardly speaking, but self-conscious in the silence, Janey said, “Oh, super. Elevenses.”"|"Blinding Light"|"Paul Theroux"
07:00|"seven in the morning"|"It was seven in the morning, sunset almost twelve hours away, and already the heat and the biting flies and the stink that rose from the sodden earth seemed unbearable."|"Blinding Light"|"Paul Theroux"
"< 12:00"|"Toward noon"|"They walked on for another hour, but slowly, because of the mud and the heat. Toward noon they came to an area where some trees had fallen and littered the earth around them with heaps of dead leaves and the withered trash of dead branches. Some of the trunks looked rotted and infested but one firm trunk remained, the right height for a seat. Ava approached it to sit down."|"Blinding Light"|"Paul Theroux"
"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"But they complained in better spirits, dismissively, knowing they were leaving. The van was waiting at Chiritza, where Nestor gathered the blindfolds. They arrived before noon at Lago Agrio and had lunch. After the simplicity of the Secoya village, the town looked especially vicious to Steadman now, for he saw—somehow knew—that the town of drug dealers and gunrunners and whorehouses had once, before the oil boom, been a sleepy village on a riverbank. They boarded the van and took the long road to Baeza, ate there in twilight, passed by Papallacta, and made the long climb to Quito in darkness. The village was not very far after all, yet it now seemed inaccessible."|"Blinding Light"|"Paul Theroux"
"ap > 10:00"|"a little past ten o’clock"|"As Steadman touched his watch face—it was a little past ten o’clock—the president was answering questions: “Paris ... that very night ... in the hospital ... No other news.”"|"Blinding Light"|"Paul Theroux"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"That week of revelation on the Aguarico River reminded Steadman that they had not left the Vineyard since arriving back from Ecuador last November—had been buried alive all winter and spring and into the summer, those dazzling months of work and sex. And then at nine, starting for the airport, Ava at the wheel, Steadman furious in the passenger seat, scowling at an impenetrable line of traffic they were trying to join, they came to a dead stop at the junction of his country lane and the main road."|"Blinding Light"|"Paul Theroux"
12:00|noon|"Ava said, “Anyway, there’s another flight at noon,” and kept on, sounding hopeful, offering consolation, until she became aware of the silence from Steadman."|"Blinding Light"|"Paul Theroux"

"ap 02:00"|"Two O’Clock"|"The driver said, “Where to?”
“You know the Two O’Clock Lounge?”
“It’s not called that anymore.”"|"Blinding Light"|"Paul Theroux"
"ap 02:00"|"Two O’Clock"|"The place was called Pinky’s, at the same address on Washington Street where the Two O’Clock Lounge had once been. Leaving the hot sidewalk, they entered the darkened doorway into a room of loud music that was cool and poorly lit and dirty, smelling of spilled beer. He sniffed again: naked flesh, two women dancing slowly on a mirrored floor, a pair of long-legged nudes, seeming to ignore the beckoning men."|"Blinding Light"|"Paul Theroux"
02:00|"two A.M."|"“That’s against hospital rules—and unprofessional. I’m a doctor. You’re my patient. Anyway, I have a woman in labor. She’s due any minute but I have a feeling it will be two A.M. It always is.”"|"Blinding Light"|"Paul Theroux"
"< 20:00"|"almost eight o’clock this August night"|"When the phone rang, his blindness had moderated to the point that on the second ring he actually saw the telephone by the window in the last light of the waning day, almost eight o’clock this August night."|"Blinding Light"|"Paul Theroux"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"The routine was the same every day. Up at seven, and after breakfast, the lake. Hot dogs and milk at the cabin for lunch, then bike riding or back to the lake in the afternoon. Supper at six, the meal Slade looked forward to, because Tom’s mother would be dressed up. They played in the meadow until the mosquitoes started biting. Then to bed. The house smelled of its pine floors and newly sawn timber, and at night there was always a radio playing, Tom’s mother downstairs alone, leafing through a magazine, Collier’s or the Saturday Evening Post."|"Blinding Light"|"Paul Theroux"

14:00|"two that day"|"That gave him a story to tell interviewers. There were two that day, and each time he boasted of his blindness. The journalists were kind, yet he knew that they would mention the crumbs on his shirt front, his wild hair, and if his socks didn’t match they would say so."|"Blinding Light"|"Paul Theroux"
"< 00:00"|"almost midnight"|"Steadman sat, a film of guilt like scum on his face. Needing to complain, he rubbed his eyes and dialed Ava. Just as quickly he hung up, realizing as he tapped the keypad how late it must be. He had not checked his watch—he unconsciously assumed that his watch face would be visible. It usually was at this hour. Touch was like sight: he stroked the hands of his watch—almost midnight. He cursed Manfred. And he imagined the phone call he had just aborted, Ava saying, You pushed your luck—what did you expect?"|"Blinding Light"|"Paul Theroux"
05:00|"five a.m."|"The man pitied him with a helpless, burdening concern, easing him into the taxi as Steadman studied him, summing him up as someone poor and unappreciated, living on his own but with children somewhere, who were kept away from him. Having to be at work at five a.m., he was already weary. His uniform was fairly new but his shoes were worn, the leather crushed, with thin soles. The man coughed, covering his wide scraped-looking face and his bruised lips. His lungs were spongy and rotten."|"Blinding Light"|"Paul Theroux"

19:00|"seven in the evening"|"He took some comfort in being able to recognize the changes in the weather. Some days he sweltered, the Vineyard afternoons when the wind dropped and there was no air, the long summer days of humidity, bright sunshine at seven in the evening, and some nights could seem suffocating. But then the wind would rise, the air cooled, and within a short time, hours sometimes, he would fumble in drawers for his sweater. These simple perceptions seemed to him necessary victories."|"Blinding Light"|"Paul Theroux"
