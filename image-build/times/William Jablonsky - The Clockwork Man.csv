"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"She is a highly intelligent girl, and despite her age—she is but three months from her seventeenth birthday—she has demonstrated an intellectual curiosity that matches her father’s. She has been the Master’s closest companion since the death of Frau Gruber two years before I was first wound, and he has on many occasions benefited from her assistance in his workshop. Just last night, in fact, she stayed up well past her usual bedtime of eleven o’clock (despite it being a school night) helping him perfect the rotation on a multi-ringed carousel clock meant as a gift for Jakob’s middle school. She has, with the Master’s help, built herself an impressive attic observatory, where she often retreats after dinner to peer at the stars through the homemade telescope she and her father built together. It is her place of refuge, where she records whatever new phenomenon shemight observe in the hope of discovering something heretofore unknown. In fact, she believes she has charted a new comet that has thus far gone unnoticed, and is in the process of taking notes to submit to the Astronomical Society. Her only qualm is that she will undoubtedly have to submit her findings through her father, as her recent posts to the Society have gone without response. The Master has remarked several times that she may well become the next Copernicus, and that he ought to send her to Oxford or Wittenberg to foster her magnificent intellect, but as soon as the words leave his lips, his face falls and he goes quiet. I have observed his behavior long enough to know her absence would fill him with great sadness. I myself can scarcely imagine life in this house without her."|"The Clockwork Man"|"William Jablonsky"
22:44|"10:44 p.m."|"Herr Gruber immediately sent me to his workshop, a teeming labyrinth in the cellar whose walls are covered in diagrams and blueprints of his automated clocks, the many workbenches littered with half-finished scale models. Giselle cleared off one of the benches and gently removed my jacket so her father could repair the dent in my outer shell with a thick, heavy suction cup. I lay facedown on his workbench, forbidden to move lest I cause him to slip and damage me. As he worked Giselle gently intertwined her fingers with mine, and I was not afraid.

The two shared a carafe of black coffee and an assortment of small pastries—petit fours, Giselle called them, though I was unfamiliar with the term—while I watched over their parcels. They invited me to sit with them, and even the café’s owner urged me to sit down—because of the Master I am something of a local celebrity, and often draw onlookers—but the Master insists I conduct myself like a gentleman at all times, and it is my habit to do so."|"The Clockwork Man"|"William Jablonsky"

"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"Upon further thought, I feel it necessary to explain that exile into the Master’s workshop is not an unpleasant fate. It is not simply some bare-walled cellar devoid of stimulation—quite the opposite. In fact, I find myself fascinated by the many sketches and designs for his great clocks, those already constructed and others he is currently planning. The blueprints are so intricate, it would take me many hours to fully comprehend the design and function of each component, much less the whole mechanism. A few of these magnificent spectacles have taken years to construct, particularly the steeple design commissioned by a hotel owner in London, which features hundreds of tiny swallows perched all over the clock’s face, who flap their wings at seven o’clock each morning. The Master fashioned them one at a time, testing each individually before mounting them to the clock. While he was completing the project, the tiny, feathery, flapping things covered his worktables so that there was not a free inch of space. They were quite realistic, with real feathers he and Giselle had glued on, and beady, glinting onyx eyes, though I have come to expect nothing less from his craftsmanship. When Jakob, then only five, saw them flapping their wings on the tabletops, he screamed, and the Master laughed with pride before rushing up to comfort him. (Giselle has since informed me that, during a foray in the park before I was wound, he wandered too close to a flock nesting in several trees, and was attacked.) On occasion he still has nightmares in which he is swarmed by dense flocks of tiny birds, pecking and scratching at his limbs and face. (The problem was once so severethe Master feared Jakob would require the services of a mental health specialist, but it has since leveled off to rare bouts.)"|"The Clockwork Man"|"William Jablonsky"
17:58|"5:58 p.m."|"The reader may recoil at the intimacy of my actions. But I assure you I merely carried out my duty as this family’s faithful servant, and would have performed such a task for Jakob, or the Master himself, if called upon to do so. I consider it an excellent and fitting end to the day.

12:28|"12:28 this afternoon"|"I should first provide some context to the event, which happened outside the market on Elisabeth Street at 12:28 this afternoon. The Master and Frau Gruber had gone shopping with the children—despite her exacting standards, Frau Gruber is quite fond of the clothing stores in the vicinity—and at the Master’s suggestion, I accompanied Fräulein Gruenwald on an errand. Frau Gruber, while sifting through the Master’s pantry, had discovered the kosher salt Fräulein Gruenwald had purchased to encrust her pork shoulder roast, and had found it unacceptable. I am still uncertain as to why, but I have no knowledge of the culinary arts and so must assume she had good reason. Fräulein Gruenwald volunteered to replace it with a coarse sea salt, and before leaving the Master instructed me to accompany her, if only to free me from his workshop for a while, and to provide Fräulein Gruenwald with a suitable escort."|"The Clockwork Man"|"William Jablonsky"

Outside I heard the sound of horses’ hooves, drawing a carriage away, and the children bidding their grandmother good-bye. Thirty-three seconds later, the door burst open; Giselle stood in the doorway, her arms spread wide. “I release you!” she said. “Come, feel the sun on your face again.”"|"The Clockwork Man"|"William Jablonsky"
23:56|"11:56 p.m."|"I apologize for meandering in personal matters, for there is much else to report. In two days the Master will host a pair of distinguished American visitors who wrote several months ago asking to view me, a visit about which he has been most excited for some time—so much so, that he fabricated a business appointment in Berlin so Frau Gruber might leave earlier. (The Master dearly loves his mother; however, around guests she has a tendency to be somewhat abrasive, and he admires these visitors too much to risk embarrassment.) Then, soon after, I will accompany him on a long train trip to survey sites for new commissions, and to service some of his existing models. He has determined that in light of my miscalculated rescue in front of the taxidermist’s shop, it might be a sound idea for me to spend some time away from this place, so that the population might forget their nervousness around me. (I also accompany him for practical reasons; some of his clocks contain large components far too heavy for him to manipulate alone.) While I have traveled with him before, he has promised that on this trip, I will see things I have only read about in his library. So while I shall, no doubt, bemoan my separation from Giselle, as well as Jakob and Fräulein Gruenwald, I nonetheless look forward to the opportunities that await me.

Throughout the dinner it became clear that the Master was unimpressed by Herr Ford, who talked, cumulatively, for one hour and twenty minutes about his horseless carriage—or “quadricycle,” as he called it—which he hoped to one day produce in large enough numbers to be commercially profitable. The idea amused the Master, who delighted in informing Herr Ford that several German inventors had already developed similar creations. Herr Ford conceded this point; however, he insisted his means of production, using assembly lines and interchangeable parts, would be the key to his success. The Master scoffed at this. “Where’s the art in it, my friend?” he asked."|"The Clockwork Man"|"William Jablonsky"

Thus, he is currently asleep on the bench in our passenger cabin, his head resting on my shoulder (a rarity, as he generally cannot sleep on trains). Due to the nature of his profession, the Master is not an early riser; rather, he prefers to work well into the night and sleep until at least eleven o’clock, even on weekdays. It is one of the reasons he ultimately hired Fräulein Gruenwald, lest he be unavailable to prepare the children for school in the morning. While Giselle is reasonably self-sufficient, Jakob has proven extremely difficult to pry from his bed in the morning. I have tried on numerous occasions, only to be met with a pillow to the head, and Jakob wrapping himself in a nearly impenetrable cocoon of blankets."|"The Clockwork Man"|"William Jablonsky"

12:00|noon|"Then it was on to Vienna—a marvelous city full of ornate cathedrals, stately Baroque buildings trimmed with gold and crowned with copper towers, and centuries-old cobblestone streets—where Herr Gruber had been summoned to repair a glitch in his automated clock near the Imperial Palace. Apparently its workings are too complex for the local engineers to comprehend. I have seen the Master’s drawings before, but in person the clock is grander than I could have imagined: an automated string quartet powered by steam that, when the clock strikes noon, emerges from the base on a series of interconnected tracks and plays Mozart’s Eine kleine Nachtmusik in its entirety. This clock, in particular, isclose to his heart. He claims Mozart’s music is clockwork transformed into sound, each note a tiny cog that moves the whole toward a singular effect, and when he hears it played he drifts off into a kind of blissful trance."|"The Clockwork Man"|"William Jablonsky"
12:00|noon|"He tinkered with the violist for three days, and by noon on the third day, had the entire mechanism working again. When the music began, the gathered crowd marveled at the display, then broke into raucous applause. He waved to them once, then closed his eyes and rested his hand on my shoulder. “Listen,” he said. “Beautiful, isn’t it?”"|"The Clockwork Man"|"William Jablonsky"
21:58|"9:58 p.m."|"The performance itself was miraculous, the music filling the amphitheater like a thousand bells ringing, a sound so rich and full the whole of my body trembled at the crescendos—a very pleasant and intense sensation. I have read the story of Orpheus, but onstage the stuff of myth, previously relegated to words on a page, became real. The tenor’s affected pain was all too apparent as he mourned his deceased Eurydice, his grief so great, it drove him to enter the underworld where no living man could go to retrieve her. I have seen the same look on the Master’s face, after he has gazed upon the photograph of his late wife, and am sure he would sacrifice nearly anything to have her back. I wonder if my own cog-driven heart might love or grieve as much, and if so, what it might lead me to do. But it is pointless to reflect on this; I was not made for such depth of joy or sorrow. Such feeling is strictly the purview of flesh and blood. And perhaps I should be grateful for that.

After he drank it down, the tension gradually vanished from his forehead and eyes, and it gratified me to see serenity return to his face.

And I must confess I still eagerly await the surprise Giselle has planned for me; it is a little thing, and perhaps unworthy of so much thought, but I find a certain peace in it.

I wondered why, despite his confidence that Herr Edison could never duplicate his design, he continued to brood so. Upon reflection I believe his long-held admiration for the great inventor blinded him to Herr Edison’s motives, and is the source of his disappointment. I have yet to know such disappointment or betrayal, and it comforts me that, so long as I am in the care of the Master and his family, I never will.

01:43|"1:43 a.m."|"Since then I have been considering our conversation at some length without arriving at an explanation. Perhaps the Master has seen some additional quality in me that makes me a more perfect approximation of life. Giselle believes that since our business trip, he is closer to viewing me as a living being in my own right; though her sentiments are flattering, I myself remain unsure of their truth. In the meantime the Master has offered me greater freedom outside his home, should I wish to go somewhere (accompanied by Giselle or Fräulein Gruenwald, of course, to avoid any misunderstandings), a relaxation of my household duties, additional books as my interests grow. But my earlier statement holds: I want for nothing within the Master’s power to grant, and my contentment is assured so long as I remain in the service of his family.

In my mind I have replayed the experience several times over, searching for the one moment that cements my guilt, but in recalling it, I find only a vague sense of warmth coursing through the thin copper beneath my suede skin.

He was tall, lean, with short-cropped blond hair and a pinkish complexion. She spoke to him as if she knew him—I assumed from the formal ball. She paused for a moment, as if to consider his request, then held up her index finger, left his side, and headed toward me. I stepped forward, but rather than coming to me, she grasped Fräulein Gruenwald’s hand, and led her to the butcher, Herr Maier, whom she had also invited (I suspect she had been planning this all along).

The copper telescope pointing aimlessly at the heavens is yet another cruel reminder of her absence—one wonders how many twinkling spheres and comets will now go undiscovered—and so I have covered it with a swatch of black cloth. Until such time as the Master sees fit to summon me, I will remain here. My peculiar nature has afforded me a special gift: I remember perfectly every moment of my life, and may revisit any experience with but a thought. I have been told this is an enviable quality.

The reader must understand that, for a being such as I, this is an appalling state, akin to being in a play with no knowledge of the script. I cannot accurately tell how long I have been unconscious, but it has been forty-seven hours, thirty-eight minutes since my stark awakening, in which time I have discovered no details about my present situation. I can only assume a considerable amount of time has passed, as my suede skin has been tamped smooth and leathery; my tweed suit has become faded and threadbare. Apparently, this volume has not reached you, as I found it stuffed in the side pocket of my jacket; I will see that it gets to you at the earliest opportunity. The pages are yellowed and rather fragile, and I must apologize for their condition."|"The Clockwork Man"|"William Jablonsky"

The night watchman had been sitting near my window for most of the evening, but had wandered off again, perhaps to use the water closet or attend to some personal business. I briefly peeked out from behind my curtain, but drewback quickly when the two masked men—one a white man, the other another Negro (I could see their skin under the masks)—crept very near to my window. I heard the faint rustling of fabric and metal, then the quiet hum of the electric eye grew fainter, as if they had covered it over with some article of apparel. From the opposite end of the store came an urgent “Let’s move,” then the desperate ringing of the cash registers as they were mishandled, the smashing of glass in display cases. A moment later I heard another set of rushed footsteps: the night watchman returning from his respite. A mechanical voice rang out from an instrument at his side, in clipped phrases, which gave his position away to the two masked men. Concerned for his safety, I peeked out again."|"The Clockwork Man"|"William Jablonsky"

In this I find one faint (and perhaps foolish) hope: if his family has endured, if they still value their legacy, I may yet regain some small part of the world I knew.

It was not as old as the cobblestone streets of Frankfurt, which still boasted structures from medieval times, but it bore similarities to the construction taking place in the city before my long sleep."|"The Clockwork Man"|"William Jablonsky"

We did not have the advantage of darkness, as the library closes promptly at 8:00 p.m., so for the first time since my escape, I was forced to venture out into daylight. We waited until the great rush of traffic had subsided, then walkedthrough the park beside the lake as far as we could, allowing the trees to conceal us; when the trail ended, we flitted in and out of alleys on our way there. Once we reached the library, we went inside through a side entrance. The structure itself is magnificent—a tremendous, sheer building with rounded windows and a large dome on its roof reminiscent of some of the state buildings in Vienna and Berlin—and I suspected we could easily become lost inside it. Herr Greeley assured me we could browse without being seen, as parts were already dark and the vast rows of bookshelves could hide me from view. (He claims to have snuck in from time to time during the winter and slept there for warmth, hidden among the stacks.) Luck was also with us, as there were only a few others inside—mostly young people reading in booths or at tables, and I saw no evidence of electric eyes on the walls. I have not been surrounded by so many books since the Master granted me access to his personal library, and it made me think of home."|"The Clockwork Man"|"William Jablonsky"
"ap < 07:00"|"nearly seven o’clock"|"We had little time; when we arrived it was nearly seven o’clock, and the library would be closing within the hour, so I was not able to search freely, but Herr Greeley made me promise to stay hidden among some nearby shelves while he searched the catalog for several headings, which I jotted down on a scrap of paper he took from the circulation desk. The lights had already been turned off above that particular section, and so my concealment was easy. Through the stacks I watched him sitting in front of a square of silver light, typing random words onto a flat panel with typewriter-like keys."|"The Clockwork Man"|"William Jablonsky"

Our only visitors have been a rather spindly, gray-haired Negro named Vernon, who came looking for cigarettes (apparently Greeley disclosed our new location to him on a panhandling session yesterday), and a girl of about sixteen, with slightly greasy shoulder-length hair dyed a faded pink, and soft, elegant features despite her rough appearance. Greeley had not mentioned her previously, but seemed to know her well, embracing her tightly when she entered. Greeley often takes part in bartering sessions with his associates, trading what few necessary items they have procured, so this is nothing unusual; however, this is the first time he has done so at our hideout. Vernon did notice me standing in the shadows of a washing bay, and began to approach. “Who’s that, Greeley?” he asked. “That ain’t your mechanical man, is it?”"|"The Clockwork Man"|"William Jablonsky"

At exactly 4:05 yesterday morning, I had left my note for Herr Greeley and begun my trek toward the river, where I intended to take my last look at open water. My eyes fell upon a long bridge over a silty, churning river, with twin white spires that shot up into the dark predawn sky, dotted with electric lights—a beautiful sight, like the Iron Bridge cast in brilliant light. Across the river, partly illuminated by the light from the bridge, were a number of former warehouses and factories which, if the signs are accurate, will soon be transformed into fashionable luxury apartments."|"The Clockwork Man"|"William Jablonsky"

Yet I find the idea of allowing such evil to go unchecked difficult to accept. I should very much like the Master’s counsel, but he is gone now, and I am filled with doubt.

Perhaps she will find a sympathetic and obliging ear, someone who will appreciate this volume for whatever scientific merits it possesses, and who, more importantly, will recognize its validity. They may profit from it if they wish; my only concern is the restoration of the Master’s reputation in the eyes of history. But this can wait, for now.

On either side were vacant lots, the nearest house two blocks away. The words Lakeside Floral And Gifts were painted on the front window, which was filled with red-and-white carnations and lined with cardboard cutouts in the shape of daisies and roses. Next to the building was a small greenhouse, its walls papered over, sporting signs advertising discounts on various plants. I saw no lights on from my vantage point. At the time I was concerned that the culprits might have stolen the van, or taken Carrie elsewhere to commit their perversions upon her. Had that been the case our cause would be lost and Carrie doomed. As Greeley seemed to care deeply for her welfare, and in my brief contact with her she had been kind to me, that result would be unacceptable.

I find it marvelous that the house still stands; yet I recall the oppressive silence after I had been left alone. Without the family there, I can only assume it is similarly empty and silent, and while I might inhabit all the familiar places of my past, I should never be able to share them, save with the occasional visiting tourist. And there are certain rooms in which I could not bring myself to set foot, lest I be reminded that my happiest, most intimate moments are but distant memories.
