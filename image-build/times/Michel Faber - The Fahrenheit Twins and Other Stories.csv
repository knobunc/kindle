"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"By ten o’clock, I’ve been stopped in the street three times already, by people who say they want to help me."|"The Fahrenheit Twins and Other Stories"|"Michel Faber"
12:00|midday|"By midday, I’m right back to the state I was in when I first went missing. I have pains in my guts, I feel dizzy, I can’t catch my breath, there are shapes coming at me from everywhere. The sky loses its hold on the rain, starts tossing it down in panic. I’m soaked in seconds, and even though getting soaked means nothing to me, I know I’ll get sick and helpless if I don’t get out of the weather soon."|"The Fahrenheit Twins and Other Stories"|"Michel Faber"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"After another little while, I become aware that the windows of the Safehouse have turned black. Night has fallen on the outside world. I feel a cold thrill of anxiety, the instinctive dread that comes over you when you realise you’ve foolishly put off the essential business of finding a soft enclave of rubbish or an obscure stairwell until it’s too late. I imagine the bony old nurse coming up to me and saying it’s time for me to go home now, and that the Safehouse opens again at ten o’clock tomorrow. But deep down I know this isn’t going to happen. I’m here to stay."|"The Fahrenheit Twins and Other Stories"|"Michel Faber"
"ap ~ 02:45"|"about 2:45"|"At about 2:45 by the strange new alarm clock on his side of the bed, Andrew got out and put on his dressing-gown and slippers. Carefully making his way through the black corridor in case he tripped on foreign junk, he finished up in the living room, trying to look out through the gauzy curtains. It grew in him how good it would feel to be outside."|"The Fahrenheit Twins and Other Stories"|"Michel Faber"
12:00|noonday|"Mounted high on one of the walls of the conference room is a slender grey surveillance camera, pointed not at the empty expanse of purple carpet where Miss Soedhono will soon stand, but at the audience. It moves from left to right in an oiled, leisurely arc, like a snake half-dozing over an uneventful hole in the earth. Its dark glassy eye glints each time its slow-motion swivel catches the light from the spherical lamps hanging from the ceilings. These lamps, switched on despite the noonday sunshine penetrating the thin fabric of the curtains, cast an ambiguous luminosity over the men, yellowing them in much the same way that a grimy refrigerator bulb discolours leftover hunks of beef and neglected jars of mayonnaise."|"The Fahrenheit Twins and Other Stories"|"Michel Faber"
"ap 06:38"|"six thirty-eight"|"This done, undetected, he relaxed a little. The light in the supermarket seemed less harsh, the central heating less high. Mrs Weymouth was at the far end of the store, pretending to care about a disabled shopper. The clock above the community noticeboard said six thirty-eight. Another hour-and-a-half and he was a free man."|"The Fahrenheit Twins and Other Stories"|"Michel Faber"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"At eight o’clock, as the last shoppers were being ushered out of the supermarket into the summer dusk, Lachlan was already outside, standing right next to the girl’s bicycle, waiting."|"The Fahrenheit Twins and Other Stories"|"Michel Faber"
"ap 08:15"|8:15|"As always, she felt like shoving him into a chair, standing over him, and telling him exactly what her day had been like. She wanted to let him know that her day had been an outrage, a mockery, an insult. All those minutes joined end to end, yet endless; an eternity of useless minutes spent either waiting for nothing to happen, or of waiting for something to stop; of longing for someone else’s sleep (never your own) to go on and on, of being bored and anxious knowing it wouldn’t. She wanted to rail against all the hands-on fussery, the brainless drudgery, the interminable succession of soft interventions, pathetically small triumphs erased by repetition, washed away by piss and tears and lukewarm water, all to achieve an illusion of normality. Every morning at 8:15, her husband would leave her alone in the house with an infant gurgling in a bed of clean fluffy cotton; at 5:45 he would return and find her alone in the house with an infant gurgling in a bed of clean fluffy cotton; nothing, apparently, had happened. She had, apparently, lain around the house like a trusted pet, luxuriating in the quiet and the central heating. No one could begin to understand the violence that was done to her mind and spirit every day, the way her soul was tenderised by a thousand hammer blows delivered with instinctive accuracy and force by a furious little fist."|"The Fahrenheit Twins and Other Stories"|"Michel Faber"

"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"We are finally allowed to board the bus, coach, whatever. It’s five o’clock by now, but just about all the light in the sky is gone.

21:00|"nine o’clock at night"|"Manny suddenly felt very tired. It was only nine o’clock at night. He had eaten too much pizza maybe. There was no Coke left except the carbonless dregs in about a zillion bottles lying around the flat. An ambulance dragged its lonely siren through the streets outside his tenement building. He walked over to the living room window and looked down three storeys to the grocery store across the road. A Pakistani woman was putting more oranges on a display crate already piled high with oranges. The whole shopfront was like an art exhibition of fruits and vegetables. Manny liked to look at all the exotic colours and shapes, although he wouldn’t dream of buying anything that wasn’t in a packet or a take-away carton."|"The Fahrenheit Twins and Other Stories"|"Michel Faber"
06:00|"six in the morning"|"‘HU is an ancient name for God,’ she explained, and yawned, showing all her grey fillings and a cute pink tongue. ‘Sorry, I’m really sleepy. I start work at six in the morning, so this is way past my bedtime.’"|"The Fahrenheit Twins and Other Stories"|"Michel Faber"

The gig at the castle was due to kick off at seven thirty, with Corpse Grinder following Ferfiak (the homegrown pretenders) at eight fifteen.

"ap 06:00"|six|"At six, Morpheus was on his way to the castle, to rendezvous with his fellow Corpse Grinders. It was a twenty-minute drive, with Ildiko at the wheel of her pirated Volvo. Morph was in the back, as the front passenger seat was taken up by a carefully balanced, quivering, transparent plastic bag filled with water and tropical fish. The exotic creatures swam backwards and forwards in their fragile polythene home, the water vibrating in the thrum of the engine."|"The Fahrenheit Twins and Other Stories"|"Michel Faber"
"ap 10:03"|10.03|"It’s 10.03 according to his watch, and he is travelling down through the Scottish highlands to Inverness, tired and ever-so-slightly anxious in case he falls asleep between now and when the train reaches the station, and misses his cue to say to Alice, Drew and Aleesha: ‘OK, this is Inverness, let’s move it.’ His wife and children are dozing, worn out by sightseeing; the responsibility rests on his shoulders. He doesn’t know that the train terminates in Inverness and that everyone will be told by loudspeakers to get out; he imagines it rolling smoothly on, ferrying them farther south, stealthily leaving their pre-booked bed & breakfast behind. This is his first visit to Scotland; the film in his camera has only two shots left; there’s no Diet Coke on the refreshment trolley; his wife’s head sags forward, giving her a double chin; big raindrops skid silently against the thick glass of the train windows."|"The Fahrenheit Twins and Other Stories"|"Michel Faber"
"ap 05:11"|five-eleven|"Don and his family have occupied the table seating on both sides of the central aisle: eight seats in all, for four people. He reassures himself that this is OK: the train isn’t very full. Plus, he and his family are big people: Americans, head-and-shoulders above most of the other passengers. Drew, just turned fifteen, is five-eleven; Don is six-two. Both of them have hands like boxers. Three hours ago, on the way down to breakfast in an overheated hotel near Dunrobin Castle, Drew had a little blow-out and said ‘Fuck you, Dad’, but they’ve made up since then, and Don is two minutes away from the big moment."|"The Fahrenheit Twins and Other Stories"|"Michel Faber"
