"< 00:00"|"Toward midnight"|"Toward midnight Broca roused. The fever had left him but he was morose and silent. He thrust Alor roughly aside and took the sweep and the Ethne gathered speed."|"Sea-Kings of Mars and Otherworldly Stories"|"Leigh Brackett"
"< 12:00"|"Before noon"|"Before noon they sighted land, a rocky and forbidding coast. The cliffs rose sheer out of the sea and behind them forested mountains towered like a giant's wall. Here and there a narrow fiord sheltered a fishing village and an occasional lonely steadying clung to the high pasture-land. Millions of sea birds nested on the rocks and the surf made a collar of white flame along the cliffs."|"Sea-Kings of Mars and Otherworldly Stories"|"Leigh Brackett"
04:00|"four A.M."|"Lundy turned his head. Normally he had a round, fresh, merry face, with bright dark eyes and a white, small-boyish grin. Now he looked like something the waiter had swept out from under a table at four A.M. on New Year's Day."|"Sea-Kings of Mars and Otherworldly Stories"|"Leigh Brackett"
12:00|"high noon"|"As he looked farther over the plain, the light seemed to coalesce into a shimmering curtain that wavered like the heat veils that dance along the Mercurian Twilight Belt at high noon. For one brief instant he glimpsed a picture on the curtain—a city, black, shining, fantastically turreted, the gigantic reflection of a Titan's dream. Then it was gone, and the immediate menace of the foreground took all of Starke's attention."|"Sea-Kings of Mars and Otherworldly Stories"|"Leigh Brackett"
00:00|midnight|"In answer, an entire section of ebon stones fell back on silent hinge work. Starke saw a long slender black marble table. Six people sat behind it in carven midnight thrones."|"Sea-Kings of Mars and Otherworldly Stories"|"Leigh Brackett"
00:00|midnight|"The wind had dropped by midnight and for hours the galley forged on under oars, moving at far less than her normal speed because they were short-handed in the rowers' pit, having lost the Khonds that made up the full number."|"Sea-Kings of Mars and Otherworldly Stories"|"Leigh Brackett"
12:00|noon|"That was shortly after dawn. By noon the council of the Sea Kings was assembled in the throne room with Rold at their head and Emer, who had refused to stay behind in Khondor."|"Sea-Kings of Mars and Otherworldly Stories"|"Leigh Brackett"
00:00|midnight|"Presently Kynon said, 'Delgaun and I have some talking to do, so I'll bid you gentlemen farewell for the present. You, Stark, and Luhar — I'm going back into the desert at midnight, and you're going with me, so you'd better get some sleep.'"|"Sea-Kings of Mars and Otherworldly Stories"|"Leigh Brackett"
00:00|midnight|"He would have said more in his anger, but Berild said sharply,
'We will not speak of time. Go now, Stark. Be ready at midnight.'
Stark went. And as he went, his brow was furrowed deep by a strange doubt."|"Sea-Kings of Mars and Otherworldly Stories"|"Leigh Brackett"
00:00|midnight|"At midnight, in the great square of the slave market, Kynon's caravan formed again and went out of Valkis with thundering drums and skirling pipes. Delgaun was there to see them go, and the cheering of the people rang after them on the desert wind."|"Sea-Kings of Mars and Otherworldly Stories"|"Leigh Brackett"
12:00|noon|"For three days they marched without incident. At noon they made a dry camp and slept away the blazing hours, and then went on again under a darkening sky, a long line of tall men and rangy beasts, with the scarlet litter blooming like a strange flower in the midst of it. Jingling bridles and dust, and padded hoofs trampling the bones of the sea, toward the island city of Sinharat."|"Sea-Kings of Mars and Otherworldly Stories"|"Leigh Brackett"
12:00|midday|"There was no way to shelter themselves from the midday sun. The sun of Mars at its worst, however, was only a pale candle beside the sun of Mercury, and it did not bother Stark. He made Berild lie in the shadow of his own body, and he watched her face, relaxed and unfamiliar in sleep."|"Sea-Kings of Mars and Otherworldly Stories"|"Leigh Brackett"
12:00|"high noon"|"Stark heaved the body over his shoulder and followed the girl through a twisting maze of corridors, some pitch dark, some feebly lighted by the moons. Fianna moved as surely as though she were in the main square at high noon. There was the silence of death in these cold tunnels, and the dry faint smell of eternity."|"Sea-Kings of Mars and Otherworldly Stories"|"Leigh Brackett"
12:00|noon|"It was a long fight. Stark watched it hungrily from the roof all that morning. The soldiers of Kushat did bravely and well, but they were as folded sheep against the tall killers of the mountains. By noon the officers were beating the Quarters for men to replace the slain."|"Sea-Kings of Mars and Otherworldly Stories"|"Leigh Brackett"
00:00|midnight|"By midnight the sounds began to slacken, and by the second hour after the city slept, drugged with wine and blood and the weariness of battle. Stark went silently out into the streets, toward the King City."|"Sea-Kings of Mars and Otherworldly Stories"|"Leigh Brackett"
"> 12:00"|"PAST NOON"|"IT WAS PAST NOON. HE HAD climbed high toward the saddle of the pass. Kushat lay small below him, and he could see now the pattern of the gorges, cut ages deep in the living rock, that carried the spring torrents of the watershed around the mighty ledge on which the city was built."|"Sea-Kings of Mars and Otherworldly Stories"|"Leigh Brackett"
12:00|noon|"He went to his doctor, who could find no sign of infection but gave him a shot on general principles. He went to his office, but it was only a gesture. He returned home at noon on a two-day sick leave. The temperature had crept up to ninety and the humidity dripped out of the air in sharp crashing showers."|"Sea-Kings of Mars and Otherworldly Stories"|"Leigh Brackett"
00:00|midnight|"He slept downstairs that night, on the living-room couch. He had done that before during heat waves. It gave the illusion of being cooler. He dosed himself heavily with aspirin, and for a time he lapsed into a drugged slumber full of dark shapes that pursued him over a landscape he could not quite see but which he knew was alien and hateful. Then in the silent hours between midnight and dawn he started up in panic. He could not breathe. The air was as thick as water, and a weight as of mountain ranges lay along his chest, his thighs, his shoulders."|"Sea-Kings of Mars and Otherworldly Stories"|"Leigh Brackett"
"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"On the fourth day at dawn the wind dropped to a flat calm. The sun burned hot, setting sand and rock to shimmering. The water of the canal showed a surface like polished glass, and in the east the sharp line of the horizon thickened and blurred and was lost in a yellow haze. Derech stood sniffing like a hound at the still air, and around noon he gave the order to tie up. The crew, ten of them, ceased to lounge on the bales and got to work, driving steel anchor pins for the cables, rigging a shelter for the beasts, checking the lashings of the deck cargo. Carey and Derech worked beside them, and when he looked up briefly from his labors Carey saw Arrin crouched over the fire-pit cooking furiously. The eastern sky became a wall, a wave curling toward the zenith, sooty ocher below, a blazing brass-color at its crest. It rushed across the land, roared, and broke upon them."|"Sea-Kings of Mars and Otherworldly Stories"|"Leigh Brackett"
