"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"I had walked from Gaga’s in Marston’s Mills to Mashpee, where Dada was living with Vera, his Wampanoag woman, and when I got there he was black-out drunk and she was gone. I looked at Dada lying on the floor and made sure he was not dead. He was usually drunk on his day off, but he had promised to be at the fair today. It was nine o’clock on a hot Saturday morning in July. The bus shook and farted on the broken road. I sat on the back seat so nervous I sucked my thumb the whole way."|"Millroy the Magician"|"Paul Theroux"

		He was not at the Gas and Go – and he should have been. He was not at Ma Glockner’s, nor at the Cheapo-Depot. He was not at Mister Donut, not at the Trading Post, not at the Rod and Gun Club where he often drank. We looked. Dada had to be black-out drunk, though it was not even noon and I was sorry, because I knew what he was like sober, but I never could predict what he would be like drunk."|"Millroy the Magician"|"Paul Theroux"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"So the name Paradise Park stayed the same, but the material was Millroy’s: more magic, more food, more humor, fewer puppets, children everywhere. The show was more popular than ever. Each morning there was a long line of children waiting in the six o’clock darkness to get into the studio to be part of the audience. Some came with their parents, or in little packs, looking wolfish, others were alone and, when I told Millroy that those were the ones I felt sorry for, he chose them first – ‘Who’s here alone?’ There were eighty seats for children on the show, but within a week there were two or three hundred children waiting to get in."|"Millroy the Magician"|"Paul Theroux"
"ap 02:00"|two|"‘This old basket has swallowed her up,’ Willie Webb was saying, as he removed the lid. ‘And in her place is an apple. Or is it two?’"|"Millroy the Magician"|"Paul Theroux"
"ap 04:00"|four|"Lunch at Pilgrim Pines was always something that Millroy had prepared, Ezekiel bread and fish, or vegetables, barley or pottage, raisin cakes, sour cheese, a waxy wedge of honeycomb. Then we went for a walk or lounged around planning the next day’s show, reading the fan letters – Millroy took the comments in children’s letters very seriously – and had a snack and went to bed early. ‘All good people ought to be in bed by eight.’ Then we were up again at four, on the road by five – eating our breakfast in the car or in the rest area at exit five, where there was water, and in the studio for the first rehearsal at six-thirty, the children wired."|"Millroy the Magician"|"Paul Theroux"

"ap 08:00"|eight|"I waited until bedtime, which was eight or so, the usual. I did not speak until he had put the lights out and had stopped fumbling with his pillow. He was at the other end of the trailer, on his own shelf, in his own cubicle, sighing, submerging himself in sleep as he had taught me to do."|"Millroy the Magician"|"Paul Theroux"
12:00|noon|"‘I guess not,’ Fredette said.
Millroy said, ‘Can you be at this number tomorrow at noon?’
Fredette said yes, and Millroy hung up. But Millroy did not call back. He paid a visit in person instead. If I had told him I was coming he might have spread it around. We drove up in the Ford, Millroy intimidating in a black leather biker’s jacket and sunglasses, his mustache shaggy, and I was a boy in boots, two inches taller than I really was."|"Millroy the Magician"|"Paul Theroux"
"ap 02:00"|two|"But Fredette was thinking about his diner. He said, ‘The rotten thing about food and beverage is the hours. I never get to bed before two. I’m here again at six, heating the deep fat in the Fry-O-Later, revving the salamander, defrosting the hamburg, slicing baloney, mixing up the juice, making the batter.’"|"Millroy the Magician"|"Paul Theroux"

		The first night we slept at the Day One Diner, Millroy’s voice woke me like a slap in the face saying, ‘No!’ and he thumped and fought, as though someone were trying to drag him away. Then he choked, then let off a thirsty gasp of fright, then deep silence, then another thump, then a small sorrowing sound, hoo-hoo-hoo, and I could imagine his shoulders."|"Millroy the Magician"|"Paul Theroux"
"ap 06:30"|six-thirty|"They showed up hungry, Willie and Stacy, before sun-up, six-thirty or so, the next morning, rapping on the diner door, asking could they come in?"|"Millroy the Magician"|"Paul Theroux"
"ap 05:00"|five|"We were putting out the breakfast for ourselves before setting up the diner for the morning opening. The ovens had been turned on at five and were fragrant with baking loaves of bread, and awaiting us on the counter-tops were vegetables to be chopped and fish to be gutted and lamb to be cut and skewered or seethed. The pottage smelled of earth and it bubbled on the stove making the sound of a small outboard on a skiff. Kayla and Stacy were drizzling honey on bread slices."|"Millroy the Magician"|"Paul Theroux"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"The Day One Program had high viewing figures in those cities, even though it was only once a week – eight o’clock on Sunday morning cable, an inexpensive time slot, between Body Shaping and The Hour of Power Prayer Line."|"Millroy the Magician"|"Paul Theroux"
13:00|"one in the Day"|"I imagined that I had seen her clenching her fists, but no. Her fingers were twisted and swollen like Gaga’s, with arthritis. No one in the Day One Diner was ever this old or this feeble, and I was so unused to being with such a person that I was as amazed by her kindness as I had been by her threats against Mister Phyllis."|"Millroy the Magician"|"Paul Theroux"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"I was glad he was saying this before the Sons and Daughters had arrived. It was after sunrise, but on these summer mornings it was light at five o’clock, and by that time Millroy was on his fourth baking sequence."|"Millroy the Magician"|"Paul Theroux"
"ap 07:30"|seven-thirty|"It was seven-thirty. We opened to the public just after that, there were fewer people than usual, and all the Sons and Daughters serving made the diner seem lopsided – more employees than customers. The eaters were uncomfortable, with the men passing out handbills at the front door. The morning was slow, lunch was quiet, the afternoon was dead, dinner looked promising but after a busy start the diner emptied, people leaving fast and no one else coming to take their places."|"Millroy the Magician"|"Paul Theroux"
"ap 04:30"|four-thirty|"He had been up since four-thirty, moving furniture, baking bread, mashing lentils, peeling fruit, juicing vegetables, and, from time to time, hopping to the floor and doing knee-bends and push-ups, and you didn’t know whether he was genuflecting or exercising."|"Millroy the Magician"|"Paul Theroux"
00:00|midnight|"Millroy had introduced us to some strange meals, but this was the strangest one we had ever eaten – midnight, sixteen of us going whoopsie in the trailer as we shoved tables together, everything tipping on the turns in the Boston streets, and then speeding down the Mass Pike. That was just before we sat down to eat, but we never stopped rolling, and the trailer swayed like a boat in a breeze."|"Millroy the Magician"|"Paul Theroux"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"It was three in the morning when we swung by the Day One Diner again, and the Sons and Daughters stood up unsteadily in the trailer."|"Millroy the Magician"|"Paul Theroux"
"< 12:00"|"Towards noon"|"Towards noon, we entered a small town of white-painted houses, with a simple white fence around the village green, more snow scarves twisted under bushes and trees, and a tarnished metal statue of an old soldier in a baggy uniform on a stone pedestal. Beyond the statue was a church with a golden arrow as its weathervane."|"Millroy the Magician"|"Paul Theroux"
"~ 12:00"|"Around noon"|"When the wind dropped, when the surf eased, when the birds took a breath, I could hear island music, island television, and the bumping of rusty cars on the narrow Opihikao road. Around noon there were food shouts, someone calling to his friend to get some shaved ice at Yamamoto’s, or a plate lunch in Pahoa."|"Millroy the Magician"|"Paul Theroux"
06:30|"six-thirty this morning"|"I was not alarmed by those words. I had heard him say such things before. Talking about cramps and muscle control he had seemed human to me.
‘I have been trying to expel it since six-thirty this morning.’
Even that five hours of struggle did not seriously worry me. He was still smiling, as though he had just chased the neighbor’s dog out of the yard – the old Millroy."|"Millroy the Magician"|"Paul Theroux"
00:00|midnight|"I was hesitant to try again, but facing a calm sea in the stillest air I had known on this island, I knelt again and watched for Millroy. In the five hours until shivery midnight I doubted everything that had happened. How could it be magic? It was my imagination, just nerves, because I was alone, because Millroy was gone."|"Millroy the Magician"|"Paul Theroux"
