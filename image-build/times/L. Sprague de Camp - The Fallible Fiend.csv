We planned to spend two full days there and to give three performances: two of evenings and one on the second afternoon. We opened the first show on the even of the first day."|"The Fallible Fiend"|"L. Sprague de Camp"
12:00|midday|"The increasing cold made me sluggish and stiff. The robe that Aithor had given me was of little help, since we demons do not have a source of internal heat like the higher animals of the Prime Plane. Hence our bodies cool down to the temperature of the ambient air, and our activity slows proportionately. The first two nights, I could thaw myself out enough by my campfire to carry me through the following day; but then I found that I needs must stop at midday, build a fire, and warm myself then as well."|"The Fallible Fiend"|"L. Sprague de Camp"
12:00|noon|"At noon by my pocket sun-ring, I stopped to build a fire. The horse ate a small bagful of grain that I carried for such emergencies, since there was too little herbage at this height to keep him fed."|"The Fallible Fiend"|"L. Sprague de Camp"
12:00|midday|"This put a new complexion on things. The man’s garments would furnish me with some insulation against extremes of temperature, for the midday heat of the steppe nearly prostrated me and the cold of midnight froze me almost to immobility. I therefore adopted the man’s fur hat, sheepskin coat, and felt boots. The trousers I gave up because of the discomfort of cramming my tail into them. I also adopted the man’s weapons and his flint and steel."|"The Fallible Fiend"|"L. Sprague de Camp"

It were worth your while to be there, Admiral, since I understand that Ir owes you money, too. Now were the time to present your reckoning.”"|"The Fallible Fiend"|"L. Sprague de Camp"
