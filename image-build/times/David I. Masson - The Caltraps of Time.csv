The river was not large here — a shallow, stony but attractive stream — and the Great Valley (all of whose breadth could now be seen) was at this western point no more than a third of a mile across.

Up here, a fine velvety backdrop for the display was made by the inky black of the northern sight-barrier, which cut off the stars in a gigantic arc. Fortunately the weather was fine. The silhouettes of the firework boats could just be discerned. In a world which knew no moon the pleasures of a ‘white night’ were often only to be got by such displays. The girl and Derestó were swimming round and round the launch. Even the small boy had been brought out, and was rather blearily staring northward. Eventually the triple green star went up and the exhibition was over; at the firework boats a midnight had been reached. Derestó and Venoyyè were called in, located by a flare, and ultimately prevailed on to climb in, shivering slightly, and dry off in the hot-air blaster, dancing about like two imps. Arisón turned the launch for the shore and Silarrè was found to be asleep. So was Venoyyè when they touched the jetty. Their parents had each to carry one in and up to the beach house."|"The Caltraps of Time"|"David I. Masson"

I cou’d understand little yet, but what my Host (or his Wife at home) spoke to me slowly, so I sate like one abroad in a far Countrey. Afterwards he brought me to his Bank, the House where he had his Money in loan. He told them, he wou’d draw an extraordinary Fund out of his Moneys, which he was pleas’d to name, the Antiquitys Account, and before me he paid into this Fund, all the Moneys he had agreed to pay me for my Goods, but all was done meerly upon Paper, with much writing and signing. He told me privatly, he durst not make me a Customer of this House, for fear, too many Questions shou’d be ask’d, but I stood by and they were to think, I was a Man of his. Then he draws out twenty Pound for smaller Expences, which he gives to me, some of it Coyn, but what they call Pounds, are nothing but Scraps of Paper, with green Pictures on ‘em; yet he assures me, they shou’d buy a Pounds worth of Goods, and indeed ‘twas so, as I found (except that a Pound goes such a little way with them). He takes me to the Taylors, and buys me a Suit of Cloathes, with all kind of Linnen, and pays for all out of a new Book of Papers, that he calls Checks, subscrib’d for this new Account, and shews me, how much it comes to, which was a great number of Pounds, that I was still not us’d to."|"The Caltraps of Time"|"David I.

But anon there came a Rumbling, and in another Part of the Sky a Thing like a huge Bird, but that mov’d not it’s Parts. Says he, that was another Plain.

If we came home, I often stay’d there afterwards, and try’d some Husbandry in their Garden, or walk’d abroad untill I knew the Neighbourhood well. The Wife, who also controul’d the Chariot, sometimes kept it by her after Dinner, while the Husband return’d to his Shop in one of their Busses. If the day were bright, she wou’d then bring me out in this Car, and over the Countrey-side. I suffer’d a Surprize, when I saw our Range of Hills, not much chang’d, tho’ with single Houses here and there built over ‘em, and Poles of Metal to carry their Electricity over the Land. But every where was a Vapour or Smoak on the brightest of days. A Stream, where I am wont to fish, was become a Sluice between Walls of Stone, and black besides, in the midst of another Town, where is nothing today but a Farm (after which this Town was nam’d, as I found). The great part of the Land about is cover’d with their Houses, and where our Farm-tracks wind, are hard Roads, where-on their Chariots continually rush by and roar. Their Towns are for the most part built of red Bricks, but blacken’d by their Smoaks, of which a great amount comes from Factorys as wide as Villages and as populous as Towns, where they make their many Goods."|"The Caltraps of Time"|"David I.

It turned up only nine units within a range of 60 to 70 per cent on the desirability scale, and this is the best it could do. Six were filled units with families leaving inside four days, three were new units. Two of the three were pods in pod-batteries, the third was an unbooked unit in a new block.

Flight between about 11 a.m. and midnight was considered meteorologically impossible owing to the severe up-currents and the electrical disturbances. They took off at 7 a.m. just before dawn, using powerful searchlights.
