23:56|"twenty-three hours and fifty-six minutes"|"By spending a couple of years painstakingly tracking and timing the static hiss that registered on his jury-rigged antenna, Jansky had discovered that radio waves emanate not just from local thunderstorms and other known terrestrial sources, but also from the center of the Milky Way galaxy. That region of the sky swung by the telescope’s field of view every twenty-three hours and fifty-six minutes: exactly the period of Earth’s rotation in space and thus exactly the time needed to return the galactic center to the same angle and elevation on the sky. Karl Jansky published his results under the title “Electrical Disturbances Apparently of Extraterrestrial Origin.”†††††"|"Astrophysics for People in a Hurry"|"Neil deGrasse Tyson"
