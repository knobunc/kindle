"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"I have become fixed in my customary vices. I work and read into the early morning; I sleep long and rise late. Book dealing is a business best conducted from your own bed. In the deep three o’clock, four o’clock, there is something old and feral and rather beautiful about Clapham. The wind seems to blow from a direction not marked on any compass; new, fresh, music carries far on it, imbued with a lonely splendor I never hear in the flat, tinny light."|"Time Was"|"Ian McDonald"

"< 00:00"|"Towards midnight"|"Towards midnight Tom roared in on an Enfield—Lord knows where he had commandeered it, let alone how he had navigated Cairo in a blackout. He had a pillion passenger, a sallow, dark-haired lad, rather sloppy in his dress, I thought. His insignia—a sphinx and the motto Vigilant—was not familiar to me. Photoreconnaissance, Cowan later informed me. RAF. That explained the general slovenliness. Tom pulled off his riding gloves, banged the dust out of them and bellowed for a gin and tonic. The pillion passenger introduced himself as Ben Seligman. He carried no baggage but a single book: some rum, arty thing about time."|"Time Was"|"Ian McDonald"
"ap 02:00"|"Two o’clock"|"“Two o’clock, sweetie. Some of us do our best work in the morning.” Shahrzad time, of course. But only two days since I had seen Thorn off on her train to the Fens. “Sent you a something. I knew it, I knew I knew it.”"|"Time Was"|"Ian McDonald"
21:13|21:13|"La Sauterelle was created to caress my bibliophile nerve endings. Eccentric architecture. Stacks in corridors, staircases lined with books so you had to side-wind up them, cautious of triggering a paper avalanche; rooms connected like synapses. Idiosyncratic cataloguing: by jacket color rather than subject, by poetic theme, by the geographical location of the author. An entire room was dedicated to pastry-cooking. I knew I could lose hours—ideally days—in this paper labyrinth. Our train left Gare du Nord at 21:13."|"Time Was"|"Ian McDonald"
"ap 01:30"|"one thirty"|"I stayed until one, one thirty, then slept until the light through my sagging blinds woke me. Espresso at Linari. Three sips watching the shop, always an eye on the shop."|"Time Was"|"Ian McDonald"
