"ap 00:01"|"twelve one"|"“So was Juan Olivar. At twelve one is not a man. Even though one is a matador, one is not a man.”"|"Shadow of a Bull"|"Maia Wojciechowska"
"ap 00:00"|twelve|"“I remember it as if it were yesterday! Still on her knees, she looked at the tiny baby and crossed herself. ‘At twelve, not before, but at twelve, the boy will bring great glory to Arcangel. It will be in the bull ring. He will fight, and he will kill his first bull. And he will go on killing bulls for as long as he lives. And this town will have Spain’s greatest matador!’ ”"|"Shadow of a Bull"|"Maia Wojciechowska"
"ap 00:00"|twelve|"“It was there, at the spring tienta of Count de la Casa, that Juan Olivar, twelve, made his first pass with a cape. He went into the ring with a three-year-old bull, and the bull was dead fourteen minutes after Juan Olivar made his very first pass. In those fourteen minutes, the boy fought the animal with rare grace, fine skill, and great courage. And the bull was dead of a sword that was placed as calmly and as beautifully as any sword that has ever reached the heart of a bull has ever been placed. At twelve, having never practiced, or even shown any interest in the corridas he had seen, Juan Olivar was a matador. And the gypsy’s prophecy was fulfilled.”"|"Shadow of a Bull"|"Maia Wojciechowska"
16:00|"four in the afternoon"|"It was four in the afternoon in the plaza with his father’s statue at its center. The men who were always sitting at the tables of the café were all there as usual. As he fell, he heard them laugh."|"Shadow of a Bull"|"Maia Wojciechowska"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"They walked into the bull ring in the bright daylight of five o’clock. It was not the crowd that Manolo first saw, but the great ring of sand, half light, half dark. Empty. Quiet. And then he saw the people. The crowd was colorful, loud, waiting. From them there was no escape for anyone, Manolo thought, unless it was into the tranquil smoothness of the sand. And before he even sat down he decided that if his father had ever been afraid, it had not been of fighting a bull but of that ring of waiting people."|"Shadow of a Bull"|"Maia Wojciechowska"
"ap 00:00"|twelve|"“But a cape! Let the boy play, practice what he’s learning. I wouldn’t give him a muleta, but a cape! What harm in letting him start with the cape?”
“At twelve. With the bull. For the first time.”
“Like his father. Everything must be like his father.”"|"Shadow of a Bull"|"Maia Wojciechowska"
"ap 04:00"|four|"The argument was familiar. He had heard it before; almost since he could remember anything at all, it had been the same argument. They had tried to give him a handkerchief at four, then a tablecloth, later a man’s jacket, and always there had been the argument. It had to be just like his father. For the first time with the bull. Not until he was twelve. Neither he nor they were to know if there was any talent in him, if his hands, like his father’s, were born for the art of bullfighting."|"Shadow of a Bull"|"Maia Wojciechowska"
"ap 00:00"|twelve|"That was the reason he began to practice. Manolo knew he could not possibly remember all that he had been told, but he felt he must not disappoint them completely. Even though he might die of fright, he would know how to move, what to do with the lure, how at least to pretend that he was, at twelve, a little like his father had been."|"Shadow of a Bull"|"Maia Wojciechowska"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"At ten, like everyone else in Arcangel, Manolo Olivar was waiting for the day, when, in two years, he would face his first bull. Like his father."|"Shadow of a Bull"|"Maia Wojciechowska"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"Each year when he came to Arcangel, a few days before the tienta, he summoned Manolo. They met in a café that was more a shrine to Juan Olivar than it was a restaurant or bar. When Manolo was small, his mother had taken him there. Now at ten, he went alone. He did not have to be reminded this time to put on a clean shirt and to wet down his hair. This year he was almost eager to see the old man. He wanted to ask him some questions, mostly about the testing of the animals. And also, he wanted to find out what was expected of him. He knew that it was most unusual to fight and to kill a bull during the tienta, for only cows were tested on foot; bulls were tested from horseback. Because of the gypsy’s prophecy, the Count had had a bull waiting for his father. But possibly for him, for Manolo, he would only have a small cow to play with. If he were not expected to kill a bull, he thought hopefully, he might not disappoint them after all. He might be almost as good as his father was that first time."|"Shadow of a Bull"|"Maia Wojciechowska"
"ap 00:00"|twelve|"“Oh!” The Count was surprised. He took a large swallow of wine, and Manolo, lifting his head, saw disappointment on the old man’s face. He shouldn’t be surprised, Manolo thought angrily. He knows very well when I was born; he knows that I will not be twelve for another year and a half. They all know it. Surely they won’t make me fight before I am really twelve. The thought came like a nightmare. It had been all their decision, he thought desperately, for him to do everything like his father. His father had been twelve and not eleven. At twelve, perhaps he, too, would be ready."|"Shadow of a Bull"|"Maia Wojciechowska"
"ap 00:00"|twelve|"“He is ready now.”
“He is as tall as Juan was at twelve.”
“He knows as much, maybe more, than his father did at his age.”"|"Shadow of a Bull"|"Maia Wojciechowska"
"~ 02:00"|"about two o’clock in the morning"|"“That’s wonderful!”
“I’ll come by your house at about two o’clock in the morning.”
“Thank you, thank you, Juan.”"|"Shadow of a Bull"|"Maia Wojciechowska"
"> 02:00"|"past two o’clock in the morning"|"They were very careful not to be seen by anyone. Although it was past two o’clock in the morning, there were still many people on the streets. The two did not talk and walked a little apart from each other."|"Shadow of a Bull"|"Maia Wojciechowska"
"ap 00:00"|twelve|"Yet the thought persisted. His father might also have been afraid. If not as a man, perhaps as a boy. He could not ask his mother, because she had always thought her husband a saint, and saints were not afraid. But he could ask his grandmother. She was the only one he would dare ask. After all, his father left from her house that day, at twelve, to fight his first bull. She might know; she would remember how it was with him at that age."|"Shadow of a Bull"|"Maia Wojciechowska"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"That night he could not fall asleep. They were coming for him at eight. He would not eat breakfast, not because anyone told him that he shouldn’t, but because he knew a bullfighter fights on an empty stomach. He supposed it would be best to get as much sleep as possible and not to think. But he could not help thinking as he was lying in the dark. He thought about what his mother had told him, and he thought of what it would be like tomorrow. Finally he said one prayer after another, hoping that saying them would make him sleepy. And then, because that was a sinful thing to do, he got up and knelt in front of La Macarena."|"Shadow of a Bull"|"Maia Wojciechowska"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"“It’s a beautiful day.” Juan García had been waiting in front of Manolo’s house since six o’clock. “It’s the most beautiful day I have ever seen in the fourteen years of my life. It is so beautiful that I want to cry. Do you feel the breeze? Manolo, there is just a whisper of a breeze! Not enough to move the muleta. It is the dream day of my life!” He threw up his arms and whirled around as a small child would do at Christmas time."|"Shadow of a Bull"|"Maia Wojciechowska"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"The men drove up at exactly eight o’clock. He wanted very much to kiss his mother, but he did not. Instead she passed her hand over his head, very briefly, and went inside the house without waving good-by."|"Shadow of a Bull"|"Maia Wojciechowska"
"ap 00:00"|twelve|"“Exactly, and well said!” Castillo’s voice seemed proud of Manolo’s answer. “At that precise moment your father was leaving his childhood behind. And he was happy to be doing it at twelve. He was not only becoming a bullfighter, he was also taking on the responsibility of being a man.”"|"Shadow of a Bull"|"Maia Wojciechowska"
