"ap 00:00"|"twelve o’clock"|"“Yes, yes, but Poirot, surely we ought to be making arrangements? The express to London has gone—it leaves at twelve o’clock. The next—”"|"Peril at End House"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 06:30"|"half past six"|"“It is arranged, my friend. We are to call on Mademoiselle at End House at half past six. She will be returned from the motoring by then. Yes, yes, surely she will have returned—in safety.”"|"Peril at End House"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 06:30"|"six thirty"|"“I asked her to accord me an interview—as soon as possible. She was a little unwilling—naturally. She thinks—I can see the thoughts passing through her mind: “Who is he—this little man? Is he the bounder, the upstart, the Moving Picture director?” If she could have refused she would—but it is difficult—asked like that on the spur of the moment it is easier to consent. She admits that she will be back by six thirty. Ça y est!”"|"Peril at End House"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"I remarked that that seemed to be all right then, but my remark met with little favour. Indeed Poirot was as jumpy as the proverbial cat. He walked about our sitting room all the afternoon, murmuring to himself and ceaselessly rearranging and straightening the ornaments. When I spoke to him, he waved his hands and shook his head.
In the end we started out from the hotel at barely six o’clock.
“It seems incredible,” I remarked, as we descended the steps of the terrace. “To attempt to shoot anyone in a hotel garden. Only a madman would do such a thing.”"|"Peril at End House"|"Agatha Christie"
00:30|"twelve-thirty this morning"|"“The answer to one simple little question, for instance, might make a great difference. If M. Charles Vyse was in his office at twelve-thirty this morning, then it was not he who fired that shot in the garden of the Majestic Hotel.”"|"Peril at End House"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap ~ 11:30"|"about half past eleven"|"The following day was Sunday. We were sitting on the terrace in front of the hotel, and it was about half past eleven when Poirot suddenly rose to his feet."|"Peril at End House"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 05:30"|5:30|"Poirot read it aloud.
“Arrive 5:30 today. Maggie.”
“My nurse and guardian!” said Nick. “But you’re wrong, you know. Maggie’s got no kind of brains. Good works is about all she’s fit for. That and never seeing the point of jokes. Freddie would be ten times better at spotting hidden assassins. And Jim Lazarus would be better still. I never feel one has got to the bottom of Jim.”"|"Peril at End House"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"“By the way, there are fireworks tonight. Will you come? Dinner at eight o’clock. The fireworks begin at nine thirty. You can see them splendidly from the garden where it overlooks the harbour.”"|"Peril at End House"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 09:30"|"nine thirty"|"“By the way, there are fireworks tonight. Will you come? Dinner at eight o’clock. The fireworks begin at nine thirty. You can see them splendidly from the garden where it overlooks the harbour.”"|"Peril at End House"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap ~ 00:30"|"about half past twelve"|"“Miss Buckley,” said Poirot, promptly. “Your cousin, is she not? A most charming young lady. I happened to mention that I was in perplexity and she told me to come to you. I tried to see you on Saturday morning—about half past twelve—but you were out.”"|"Peril at End House"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 00:30"|"half past twelve"|"“What was that?”
“He was not in his office at half past twelve on Saturday.”"|"Peril at End House"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"She left the room. I glanced at my watch. It was just nine o’clock. Dessert was brought, and port. Poirot and Lazarus were talking Art. Pictures, Lazarus was saying, were a great drug in the market just now. They went on to discuss new ideas in furniture and decoration."|"Peril at End House"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 09:20"|"twenty past nine"|"Frederica Rice sat dreamily silent, her elbows on the table and the smoke from her cigarette curling round her fair head. She looked like a meditative angel.
It was just twenty past nine when Nick put her head round the door.
“Come out of it, all of you! The animals are coming in two by two.”"|"Peril at End House"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 01:30"|"one hour and a half"|"“Doubtless. Oh, yes, it narrows down now. You remember my list—a list of persons numbered from A. to J. It has narrowed down to only two persons. I dismiss the servants. I dismiss the Commander Challenger—even though he did take one hour and a half to reach here from Plymouth—and the distance is only thirty miles. I dismiss the long-nosed M. Lazarus who offered fifty pounds for a picture that was only worth twenty (it is odd, that, when you come to think of it. Most uncharacteristic of his race). I dismiss the Australians—so hearty and so pleasant. I keep two people on my list still.”"|"Peril at End House"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap ~ 05:30"|"about half past five"|"“The father and mother are coming from Yorkshire today. They’ll arrive about half past five. Poor souls. I’m heartily sorry for them. They are taking the body back with them the following day.”"|"Peril at End House"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap > 08:30"|"past 8:30"|"Poirot smiled indulgently at the bronzed face in front of him. “You left Devonport at a few minutes past 8:30. You arrived here at five minutes past ten—twenty minutes after the crime had been committed. But the distance from Devonport is only just over thirty miles, and you have often done it in an hour since the road is good. So, you see, your alibi is not good at all!”"|"Peril at End House"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 10:05"|"five minutes past ten"|"Poirot smiled indulgently at the bronzed face in front of him. “You left Devonport at a few minutes past 8:30.

"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"“Mais oui. We shall catch the two o’clock train very comfortably. All is peaceful here. Mademoiselle is safe in the nursing home. No one can harm her. The watchdogs, therefore, can take leave of absence. There are one or two little pieces of information that I require.”"|"Peril at End House"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap > 06:00"|"past six o’clock"|"Poirot had arranged for an appointment beforehand, and although it was past six o’clock, we were soon closeted with Mr. Whitfield, the head of the firm."|"Peril at End House"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap ~ 06:00"|"About six o’clock"|"“It’s difficult to say, sir,” he said, slowly. “Lots of people come and inquire and leave things for the different patients.”
“The nurse says this came last night,” I said. “About six o’clock.”
The lad’s face brightened."|"Peril at End House"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap ~ 05:30"|"about half-past five"|"“Must have been about five thirty, or a little after. I know the post had just been, and that’s usually at about half-past five. It was a pretty busy afternoon, a lot of people leaving flowers and coming to see patients.”"|"Peril at End House"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"This proved to be one of the probationers, a fluffy little person all agog with excitement. She remembered taking the parcel up at six o’clock when she came on duty."|"Peril at End House"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 06:00"|"Six o’clock"|"“Six o’clock,” murmured Poirot. “Then it must have been twenty minutes or so that the parcel was lying on the table downstairs.”"|"Peril at End House"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap ~ 10:00"|"about ten o’clock"|"Here, however, I misjudged him. That night, when I came into the sitting room about ten o’clock, I found Poirot carefully building card houses—and I remembered!"|"Peril at End House"|"Agatha Christie"
"~ 05:00"|"about five in the morning"|"“Yes—you remember. One needs the precision. One card on another—so—in exactly the right place and that supports the weight of the card on top and so on, up and up. Go to bed, Hastings. Leave me here, with my house of cards. I clear the mind.”
It was about five in the morning when I was shaken awake.
Poirot was standing by my bedside. He looked pleased and happy."|"Peril at End House"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"I had hardly seen Poirot all day. He had been out for dinner but had left me a message that I was to be at End House at nine o’clock. Evening dress, he had added, was not necessary."|"Peril at End House"|"Agatha Christie"
