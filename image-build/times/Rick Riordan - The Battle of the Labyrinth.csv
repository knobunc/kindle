12:00|noonday|"‘This meeting of the council is adjourned,’ Silenus said. ‘And now let us enjoy our noonday meal!’"|"The Battle of the Labyrinth"|"Rick Riordan"
"~ 00:00"|"around midnight"|"So I was still awake around midnight, staring at the bunk-bed mattress above me, when I realized there was a strange light in the room. The saltwater fountain was glowing."|"The Battle of the Labyrinth"|"Rick Riordan"
"~ 03:00"|"around three in the morning"|"Apparently around three in the morning an Aethiopian drakon had been spotted at the borders of camp. I was so exhausted I slept right through the noise. The magical boundaries had kept the monster out, but it prowled the hills, looking for weak spots in our defences, and it didn’t seem anxious to go away until Lee Fletcher from Apollo’s cabin led a couple of his siblings in pursuit. After a few dozen arrows lodged in the chinks of the drakons armour, it got the message and withdrew."|"The Battle of the Labyrinth"|"Rick Riordan"
00:00|midnight|"It was still light when we got into the woods, but the shadows from the trees made it feel like midnight. It was cold, too, even in summer. Annabeth and I found tracks almost immediately – scuttling marks made by something with a lot of legs. We began to follow the trail."|"The Battle of the Labyrinth"|"Rick Riordan"
00:00|midnight|"He froze when he saw us. Then he drew his sword. The blade was just like I’d seen in my dream: short, sharp and dark as midnight."|"The Battle of the Labyrinth"|"Rick Riordan"
02:00|"Two in the morning"|"‘Two in the morning,’ Grover said. ‘I couldn’t sleep. I was watching the Nature Channel.’ He sniffled. ‘I miss Juniper.’"|"The Battle of the Labyrinth"|"Rick Riordan"
05:00|"five in the morning"|"I walked along the beach for several hours. When I finally came back to the meadow, it was very late, maybe four or five in the morning, but Calypso was still in her garden, tending the flowers by starlight. Her moonlace glowed silver, and the other plants responded to the magic, glowing red and yellow and blue."|"The Battle of the Labyrinth"|"Rick Riordan"
"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"It was Saturday, and traffic was heavy going into the city. We arrived at my mom’s apartment around noon. When she answered the door, she gave me a hug only a little less overwhelming than having a hellhound jump on you."|"The Battle of the Labyrinth"|"Rick Riordan"
12:00|noon|"At noon, the Council of Cloven Elders held an emergency meeting in their sacred grove. The three senior satyrs were there, along with Chiron, who was in wheelchair form. His broken horse leg was still mending, so he would be confined to the chair for a few months, until the leg was strong enough to take his weight. The grove was filled with satyrs and dryads and naiads up from the water – hundreds of them, anxious to hear what would happen. Juniper, Annabeth and I stood by Grover’s side."|"The Battle of the Labyrinth"|"Rick Riordan"
"> 12:00"|"past noon"|"July passed, with fireworks on the beach at the Fourth of July. August turned so hot the strawberries started baking in the fields. Finally, the last day of camp arrived. The standard form letter appeared on my bed after breakfast, warning me that the cleaning harpies would devour me if I stayed past noon."|"The Battle of the Labyrinth"|"Rick Riordan"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"At ten o’clock I stood on the top of Half-Blood Hill, waiting for the camp van that would take me into the city. I’d made arrangements to leave Mrs O’Leary at camp, where Chiron promised she’d be looked after. Tyson and I would take turns visiting her during the year."|"The Battle of the Labyrinth"|"Rick Riordan"
