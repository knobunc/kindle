"ap 03:00"|three|"I went on sitting for about five minutes, too apprehensive about the possible effects of the drug to mind the rain. Then I heard the church clock strike three, and glanced down at my watch to check the time. It was a few minutes slow, so I altered it, and almost immediately I heard shouting from the village, or cheering, perhaps—a curious mélange of the two—and a creaking sound like wheels. Oh God, what now, I thought, a traveling circus about to descend the village street? I shall have to move the car. I got up and started to walk along the path to the churchyard gate. I never arrived, because the gate had gone, and I was looking through a rounded window set in a stone wall, the window facing a cobbled quadrangle bounded by shingle paths."|"The House on the Strand"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"~ 16:30"|vespers|"The reception appeared over, but the visit was not yet through, for a bell summoned one and all to vespers and the company divided, the more favored to the Priory chapel, the lesser ranks to the church, which was at the same time part of the chapel, an arched doorway, with a grille, dividing the one from the other."|"The House on the Strand"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"~ 16:30"|vespers|"I thought I might dispense with vespers, though by standing close to the grille I could have watched Isolda; but my inevitable guide, craning his neck with the same thought in mind, decided that he had been idle long enough, and, signaling to his companion with a quick jerk of the head, made his way out of the Priory building and across the quadrangle to the entrance gate. Someone had flung it open once again and a cluster of people, lay brothers and servants, were standing there, laughing, as they watched the Bishop’s attendants struggle to turn the clumsy vehicle towards the Priory yard. The wheels were stuck between muddied road and village green, but this was by no means the only fun to be observed, for the green itself was crowded with men, women and children. Some sort of market seemed to be in progress, for there were little booths and stalls set up, some fellow was beating a drum and another squeaked on a fiddle, while a third nearly split my ears with two horns as long as himself, which he managed by sleight of hand to play simultaneously."|"The House on the Strand"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"~ 16:30"|Vespers|"Vespers was over, and the faithful who had attended were emerging from the church, to mingle with the crowd upon the green. Roger made his way into the quadrangle, and so to the Priory building itself, where the Prior’s guests were gathering before departure. Sir John Carminowe was in the forefront, and beside him Sir Henry’s lady, Joanna de Champernoune.

I wrote a letter to my mother, describing the house in boring detail just to fill the pages, reminding me of the duty letters I used to write from school: “I’m in another dormitory this term.

He was not at the flat. So I left a message with his secretary at the University saying I wanted to speak to him very urgently, but it might be better if I put the call through to him rather than he to me.

A moment in time, long past, that had no bearing on the present, that served no purpose in his life or mine, and could as little benefit the world in which we lived as a scrapbook of forgotten memories lying idle in a dusty drawer. So I argued, up to midnight and beyond, but common sense has a habit of vanishing when the demon of insomnia rides us in the small hours, and as I lay there, counting first two, and then three, on the illuminated face of the traveling clock beside the bed, I remembered how I had walked about that other world with a dreamer’s freedom but with a waking man’s perception. Roger had been no faded snapshot in time’s album; and even now, in this fourth dimension into which I had stumbled inadvertently but Magnus with intent, he lived and moved, ate and slept, beneath me in his house Kylmerth, enacting his living Now which ran side by side with my immediate Present, and so the two merged."|"The House on the Strand"|"Daphne Du Maurier"

We are all bound, one to the other, through time and eternity, and, our senses once opened, as mine had been opened by the drug, to a new understanding of his world and mine, fusion would take place, there would be no separation, there would be no death… This would be the ultimate meaning of the experiment, surely, that by moving about in time death was destroyed. This was what Magnus so far had not understood. To him, the drug released the complex brew within the brain that served up the savored past. To me, it proved that the past was living still, that we were all participants, all witnesses. I was Roger, I was Bodrugan, I was Cain; and in being so was more truly myself."|"The House on the Strand"|"Daphne Du Maurier"

It meant that Vita and the boys could go to bed, or at any rate only stay up for the courtesy of greeting the new arrival, and then Magnus and I could talk in comfort on our own.

Underlying this was a depressed fracture of the right parietal region of the skull, accompanied by lacerations of the brain and bleeding from the right middle meningeal artery. The stomach was found to contain about one pint of mixed food and fluid, which on subsequent analysis contained nothing abnormal and no alcohol. Blood samples examined were also normal, and the heart, lungs, liver and kidneys were all normal and healthy.

"ap 10:30"|"half-past ten"|"We settled for Wednesday. No tradesmen called that day, so it suited me. If they left at half-past ten and picked up Mrs. Collins again around five o’clock, they’d be home by seven at the latest."|"The House on the Strand"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap ~ 05:00"|"around five o’clock"|"We settled for Wednesday. No tradesmen called that day, so it suited me. If they left at half-past ten and picked up Mrs. Collins again around five o’clock, they’d be home by seven at the latest."|"The House on the Strand"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap > 10:30"|"after half-past ten"|"Wednesday dawned fine, luckily, and I saw the party off in the Buick soon after half-past ten, knowing that I had at least eight hours ahead of me, hours for experiment and recovery too. I went up to the dressing-room and took bottle C out of my suitcase. It was the same stuff all right, or appeared to be, but there was a brownish sediment at the bottom, like cough-mixture put away after the winter and forgotten until the cold weather comes again. I took out the stopper and smelt the contents: they had no more color and smell than stale water—less, in fact. I poured four measures into the top of the walking-stick, and then decided to screw it up for future use, and pour a fresh dose into the medicine-glass, which was still lying on a shelf with the jars in the old laundry."|"The House on the Strand"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 00:00"|"twelve o’clock"|"At twelve o’clock I returned to the lab and poured a few more drops into the medicine-glass. This had done the trick once before, and without any ill effect."|"The House on the Strand"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap > 01:00"|"after one o’clock"|"I returned to the patio and stayed until after one o’clock, but still nothing happened, so I went upstairs and had some lunch. It must mean that the contents of bottle C had lost their strength, or Magnus had somehow missed out on the special ingredients and bottle C was worthless. If this was so, I had made my last trip. The curtain had risen on my journey across the Treesmill stream in the snow, only to fall by the railway tunnel at the close of the third act. I had come to journey’s end."|"The House on the Strand"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap < 09:30"|"almost half-past nine"|"I awoke with a sudden jerk, to find the room in darkness. I glanced at my watch, and it was almost half-past nine. I had slept for nearly two hours. I felt quite normal, hungry too. I went through the dining-room into the hall, and heard the sound of the gramophone coming from the music-room, but the door was shut. They must have finished eating ages ago, for the lights were turned out in the kitchen. I rummaged in the fridge to find eggs and bacon to fry, and I had just put the frying-pan on the stove when I heard someone moving about in the basement. I went to the top of the back stairs and called, thinking it was one of the boys, who might report to me on Vita’s mood. Nobody answered."|"The House on the Strand"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 10:40"|"twenty to eleven"|"I went back downstairs and opened the front door, and stood waiting there on the steps. It was a fine night, the sky ablaze with stars. There was no sound anywhere; the campers in the field across the Polkerris road must have turned in. I looked at my watch. It was twenty to eleven. Then I heard the sound of the doctor’s car coming along the main road from Fowey, and I began to sweat again, not from fear but from relief. He turned down the drive and came to a standstill in the sweep before the house. I went through the garden to meet him."|"The House on the Strand"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"He came down just after the clock in the hall struck eleven. “Everything’s under control,” he said. “No panic stations. Your wife’s all right, and so are your stepsons. Now what about you?”"|"The House on the Strand"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 00:35"|"twelve thirty-five"|"I walked rapidly across the lounge as I saw the hostess enter the door, and waited inside the gents. I heard the flight number called over the loudspeaker, and after a few minutes, when I came out again, our party was walking with the hostess across to the aircraft, Vita and the boys in the van. As I watched, they disappeared into the plane, followed by the school-children and the priests. It was now or never. I went rapidly out of the main door of the airport building, and crossed over to the car park. In a moment I had started the Buick and pulled out of the airport entrance. Then I drew into the side of the road and listened. I could hear the sound of the engines before the plane taxied to the start, which must mean that everyone was aboard. If the engines ceased it would mean my plan had gone for nothing, and the hostess had discovered that I was missing. It was twelve thirty-five exactly. Then I heard the engines increase in pitch and in a few minutes, unbelievably, my heart pounding, I saw the silver streak of the aircraft speeding along the runway and take off, gain height and flatten out, and then it was away among the clouds and out of sight, and I was sitting there, at the wheel of the Buick, on my own."|"The House on the Strand"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
"ap 01:50"|one-fifty|"They were due to touch down at Dublin at one-fifty. I knew exactly what Vita would do. She would put through a call from the airport to Dr. Powell in Fowey, and find him out. He would be out because it was his half-day. He had told me so, when I had rung up after breakfast to say good-bye. He had said that, if it was fine, he was going to take his family over to the north coast to surf, and he would be thinking about us, and would I please send him a postcard from Ireland saying “Wish you were here.”"|"The House on the Strand"|"Daphne Du Maurier"
