They visit a range of colors, but since red flowers are invisible to most bees (or at least more difficult to find), they offer birds a nectar source with far fewer competitors, encouraging bird/plant specialization. Without bee competition driving that system, birds might be just as likely to visit other colors, such as in the bee-free flora of the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands, where only three of fourteen hummingbird-pollinated species are red."|Buzz|"Thor Hanson"
