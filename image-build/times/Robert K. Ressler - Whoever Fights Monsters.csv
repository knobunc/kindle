"ap ~ 06:00"|"about six"|"On a Monday night, January 23, 1978, that local police confidence had translated into a call to Russ from a small department north of Sacramento. A terrible homicide had been committed, one that was far beyond the ordinary murder in terms of the violence done to the victim. David Wallin, twenty-four, a laundry-truck driver, had returned to his modest suburban rented home after work, about six on the evening of January 23, and found his twenty-two-year-old, three-months-pregnant wife, Terry, in the bedroom, dead, with her abdomen slashed. He ran screaming to a neighbor’s house, and that neighbor called the police. Wallin was so upset that he could not talk to the authorities when they arrived. The first policeman who entered the home, a sheriff’s deputy, was similarly shocked. Later, the deputy said that he had nightmares for months from viewing the carnage."|"Whoever Fights Monsters"|"Robert K. Ressler"
13:30|"one-thirty in the afternoon"|"More details continued to surface over the next forty-eight hours. Sacramento is the capital of California; Terry Wallin had been a state worker, on a day off. That Monday morning, she’d cashed a check at a shopping center within walking distance of her home, and there was speculation that the killer had seen her do that and had followed her home. Her mother had called Terry’s home at one-thirty in the afternoon and had gotten no answer, and the coroner’s office said Terry had been killed prior to that time. The coroner’s office also was of the opinion that some of the stab wounds had been inflicted prior to Terry’s death, but that fact was not told to the public. The men in charge of the investigation put out the word through the news media that the killer probably had had blood on his shirt as a result of the crime and asked anyone who had seen a man with blood on his shirt to call a special number."|"Whoever Fights Monsters"|"Robert K.

"~ 12:30"|"about 12:30 P.M."|"On Thursday, the north Sacramento area was jolted with the news of more grisly murders. At about 12:30 P.M., a neighbor had discovered three bodies in a suburban home that was within a mile of the Wallin murder. Dead were Evelyn Miroth, thirty-six, her six-year-old son, Jason, and Daniel J. Meredith, fifty-two, a family friend; in addition, Miroth’s twenty-two-month-old nephew, Michael Ferriera, was missing and presumed to have been abducted by the killer. All the dead had been shot, and Evelyn Miroth had been slashed in a manner similar to Mrs. Wallin. The killer had apparently escaped in Meredith’s red station wagon, which was found abandoned not far from the crime scene. Once again, there was no apparent motive for the crime. The house was reported as not having been ransacked. Evelyn Miroth had been the divorced mother of three children; one resided with her former husband, and another child had been at school when the slaying occurred."|"Whoever Fights Monsters"|"Robert K.

23:30|"eleven-thirty that night"|"Here’s how it had begun. December 11, 1978 was Elizabeth Piest’s birthday, and she was waiting for her fifteen-year-old son, Robert Piest, to finish up work at a drugstore in Des Plaines so she could drive him home for the family party. Robert told his mother he had to go out to the parking lot to see a contractor about a summer construction job, one that would pay him nearly twice as much as he was currently making at the drugstore. Ten minutes later, when Bob didn’t come back for her, Mrs. Piest became alarmed, went home, and called the police. They told her that adolescent boys often don’t come home when they’re supposed to, and advised her to stay calm. By eleven-thirty that night, Mrs. Piest could wait no longer, and she insisted to the police that they start to search for her son."|"Whoever Fights Monsters"|"Robert K. Ressler"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"Frazier and Mullin were apprehended, but the killings continued until Easter weekend of 1973. The Tuesday afterward, at three in the morning on April 24, 1973, a call came in to the Santa Cruz police department from a public phone booth in Pueblo, California. The caller said he was Ed Kemper—a highway-department employee well known to the police because he often hung out with them in the bar near the courthouse and in the town’s gun shop. Kemper wanted to talk to a particular police lieutenant but settled for the man on duty. He wanted, he said, to confess to the killings of various coeds from the Santa Cruz campus and to the killing of his mother and a friend of his mother’s. If someone would come to Pueblo and pick him up, he’d point out where the bodies could be found."|"Whoever Fights Monsters"|"Robert K. Ressler"
"ap 06:09"|"six nine"|"There was some disbelief at the Santa Cruz station; one of those on duty thought Kemper was just pulling the desk man’s leg. But Kemper responded to some questions with more intimate knowledge of the details of the coed murders than anyone other than the killer might possess. While Kemper was still on the line, the Santa Cruz department contacted the Pueblo department and asked them to pick up Kemper and hold him until a Santa Cruz man arrived. When the Pueblo department went to the phone booth, they thought at first that it was occupied by two people—Kemper, at six nine and three hundred pounds, was large enough to convey that illusion."|"Whoever Fights Monsters"|"Robert K.

05:00|"five in the morning"|"Two weeks after the sheriff picked up the .44, on Good Friday, April 20, 1973, Kemper went to his mother’s home. She arrived later, after a faculty meeting, and they had a brief conversation in which his mother was, as usual, sarcastic to him. Once she had fallen asleep, at five in the morning, Kemper took a claw hammer from the kitchen and, as he had done so often in his imagination, went into her bedroom while she slept. This time, he actually brought the hammer down with considerable force on her right temple, then slashed her throat with his pocketknife. Blood was still gushing from her as he decided to sever the head as he had done with his other victims. Another slice removed her larynx, and he threw this part into the disposal unit in the kitchen sink. When the disposal was unable to digest the larynx and spewed it back out, Kemper thought this was poetic justice. He wrapped the body in the bloody sheets and stashed it in the closet."|"Whoever Fights Monsters"|"Robert K. Ressler"

My dad worked in security and maintenance for the Chicago Tribune, so we always had the newspaper around the house. In the Tribune the summer before, I had read about the killing of a middle-aged married woman in an apartment building. It was just an isolated case until the following December, when an ex-Wave was killed in an apartment hotel. The killer had written on a wall, in the woman’s lipstick, “For heavens sake catch me Before I kill more I cannot control myself.” From evidence that was too awful to print in the newspaper (and at which I could not even guess), the police thought the killings of the two women might be connected."|"Whoever Fights Monsters"|"Robert K.

"ap 05:06"|five-six|"Key to deciphering the enigma of Charlie Manson is the fact that, indeed, he had had a rotten early life. By the time he was thirty-two, he had been in prison or juvenile institutions twenty years, from his teenage years up until the day when he emerged from the Terminal Island facility in California with the determination to remain out of prison for the rest of his life. (Many men who were criminals in their teens and twenties mature out of their antisocial behavior in the early thirties and do manage to sustain noncriminal lives after getting out.) A small man, physically unprepossessing at five-six and 130 pounds, Manson was perceptive emotionally. In prison, he had learned to play the guitar, and even wrote some music. He planned to be a musician and earn his living that way. When he got out of prison, it was the middle 1960s, and he was able to slip right into the counterculture life that was then becoming prevalent among young people on the West Coast. He locked into the youth movement and rode it."|"Whoever Fights Monsters"|"Robert K. Ressler"
"ap 06:00"|six|"In his adolescent years, Berkowitz admitted to me, he had started developing these fantasies that involved sex but also violent acts, disruptive and homicidal themes mingling with normal erotic ones. Even earlier in his life, at six or seven, he remembered pouring ammonia into his adoptive mother’s fish tank to kill her fish, and spearing them with a pin. He also killed her pet bird with rat poison—he got a thrill out of watching the bird die slowly, and from his mother’s anguish at being unable to reverse the illness. He tortured small animals such as mice and moths. All of these were control fantasies, involving power over living things. Berkowitz also confided to me his fantasies about wishing to cause fiery air crashes. He had actually never interfered with an airplane, but arson was a logical extension of this fantasy. Most arsonists like the feeling that they are responsible for the excitement and violence of a fire. With the simple act of lighting matches, they control events in society that are not normally controlled; they orchestrate the fire, the screaming arrival and deployment of the fire trucks and fire fighters, the gathering crowds, the destruction of property and sometimes of people. Berkowitz loved to watch bodies being carried out of burning buildings. These fires were all a prelude to his moving into the arena in which he could exercise the ultimate in control, homicide. Here was a man who obtained his biggest thrills in life from sitting at home and watching the news on television as it reported his latest killing and the fear that he caused to grip the city."|"Whoever Fights Monsters"|"Robert K.

"ap 23:52"|eight-to-twelve|"Potential murderers became solidified in their loneliness first during the age period of eight to twelve; such isolation is considered the single most important aspect of their psychological makeup. Many factors go into fashioning this isolation. Among the most important is the absence of a father. When there’s no father or father figure present for an eight- or ten- or twelve-year-old boy, this is embarrassing for the child in front of his peers. He begins to avoid friends, to avoid situations in which father-and-son teams are usually present, such as Little League or the Boy Scouts. His preadolescent sexual activity, rather than being connected to other human beings, starts as autoerotic. More than three-quarters of the murderers we investigated began autoerotic sexual practices as preadolescents; half reported rape fantasies occurring between the ages of twelve and fourteen; more than 80 percent admitted to using pornography, and to tendencies toward fetishism and voyeurism. Again, we must realize that many boys grow up in homes without a father and do not turn into sociopaths; but for the ones who do become sociopaths, the eight-to-twelve period is critical. Investigation often leads back to just this time, and the set of circumstances in which the father figure is absent, as the period when bizarre behavior began."|"Whoever Fights Monsters"|"Robert K.

"ap 00:00"|twelve|"Jerome Brudos, at twelve and thirteen, began to abduct girls his own age or younger at knife point and take them into the barn on the family farm. There, he would tell them to disrobe, and then he would photograph them but do nothing else, since he was not sexually aware enough to go further. Then he’d lock them in a corncrib and go away. Minutes later, he would reappear in the barn with his clothes changed and his hair combed differently, unlock the corncrib, and announce to the girl that he was Ed, Jerry’s twin brother. He would profess horror that Jerry had locked her in there, and say, “He didn’t hurt you, did he?” The girl would explain that Jerry had taken pictures, and “Ed” would locate the camera and destroy the film in it, then say, “Jerry’s been in therapy; we have him in psychological counseling. This is going to set him back a lot. Please don’t tell my parents or anyone about this.” The girl would acquiesce. Later in life, Brudos put advertisements in campus newspapers asking for women to come and model shoes and hose for him. When they arrived for appointments in his motel room, he would abduct and murder some of them, then hang them in his garage and photograph them, either nude or in various outfits (and especially shoes) that he had put on the dead bodies."|"Whoever Fights Monsters"|"Robert K.

"~ 02:00"|"around two in the morning"|"The escalation of Monte Rissell’s crimes from rape to murder came when he was back in high school after serving some time in juvenile institutions, and he was actually receiving psychiatric counseling as part of his probation. Before this, he had committed rape, but had not progressed beyond that to even greater violence. His girlfriend, a year ahead of him in high school, had graduated, gone on to college, and had sent him a Dear John letter saying that she preferred to spend time with other men. Rissell drove to the college and observed the woman with her new boyfriend, but he took no immediate action. Back at home near Washington, D.C., he sat in his car in a parking lot, had a beer and smoked a joint, and thought about things until quite late at night. At around two in the morning, a woman appeared, alone in a car; she was a prostitute. There was no one around, and Rissell thought to himself that he would take from this woman—at gunpoint—what he could no longer obtain from his former girlfriend. With a .45 pistol in his hand, he approached the prostitute’s car and then abducted, raped, and killed the woman. Later, he went on to kill four more women."|"Whoever Fights Monsters"|"Robert K.

The remaining newspapers were still in the bag, and there was no sign of a struggle. Danny had just vanished. The police were contacted, and they called the FBI’s Omaha office. There was some suspicion that Danny might have accompanied his aunt and uncle on a trip out of state, where his uncle was going to look for employment; that notion was quickly disproved. A massive building-to-building search of the area was begun, and on Wednesday afternoon Danny’s dead body was found in some high grass alongside a gravel road, four miles from the site where his bike had been found, and only a few miles from the Iowa state line."|"Whoever Fights Monsters"|"Robert K.

06:00|"six in the morning"|"I knew that the killer had been out at six in the morning, which indicated that he had no one to whom he was responsible, and therefore was most likely not living with a wife or with overly concerned parents. Sometimes when there is a case that occurs at this early-morning hour, it’s the result of a killer who has been up all night, drinking, to raise his courage to the point where he can do the crime. If he had kept the child alive for some time, he must have had a place in which to do so. I was not certain why the victim had been found in only his underwear, because there could have been reasons other than sexual for keeping him that way—to prevent him from running away, for instance. I had the distinct impression from the gravity and incompleteness of the wounds that the killer had murdered the boy somewhat spontaneously and then after death had cut the victim on the back of the neck, thinking perhaps that he would decapitate him and dismember the body and scatter the parts—but then pulling back because this was hard to do, and just leaving the body somewhere that seemed remote. This indicated to me that he had never before dismembered a body—but suggested that he might have killed before."|"Whoever Fights Monsters"|"Robert K. Ressler"

Another boy had been abducted near Omaha and found brutally murdered three days later. Our worst fears had been realized. I rushed to Omaha, once more without benefit of an overcoat, and was soon wading through the snow with Thomas Evans and many of the same people whose acquaintance I had made in September. At around 8:30 Friday morning, December 2, young Christopher Paul Walden, the son of an officer at Offutt Air Force Base, had been walking to school in Sarpy County, and was last seen getting into a car with a white male. Three days later, in the afternoon, Walden’s body was found by two bird hunters in a heavily wooded area five miles from the abduction site. He, too, was wearing only his undershorts and had been stabbed, and had his throat slashed so far that he was nearly decapitated. There was no question in the minds of any of the law-enforcement people who viewed the damage done to the Walden boy that the killer was the same person who had similarly savaged and mutilated Eberle’s body. The pattern of postmortem wounds on the second victim indicated that the killer was escalating his sadistic slashing of the victims.
