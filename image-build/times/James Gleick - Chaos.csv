The simulated weather in Edward Lorenz’s new electronic computer changed slowly but certainly, drifting through a permanent dry midday midseason, as if the world had turned into Camelot, or some particularly bland version of southern California."|Chaos|"James Gleick"

Suppose every sensor gives perfectly accurate readings of temperature, pressure, humidity, and any other quantity a meteorologist would want.

"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"Now, in spite of himself, Hubbard began using a computer to do what the orthodox techniques had not done. The computer would prove nothing. But at least it might unveil the truth so that a mathematician could know what it was he should try to prove. So Hubbard began to experiment. He treated Newton’s method not as a way of solving problems but as a problem in itself. Hubbard considered the simplest example of a degree-three polynomial, the equation x– 1 =0. That is, find the cube root of 1. In real numbers, of course, there is just the trivial solution: 1. But the polynomial also has two complex solutions: –½ + i√3/2, and –½ – i√3/2. Plotted in the complex plane, these three roots mark an equilateral triangle, with one point at three o’clock, one at seven o’clock, and one at eleven o’clock. Given any complex number as a starting point, the question was to see which of the three solutions Newton’s method would lead to. It was as if Newton’s method were a dynamical system and the three solutions were three attractors. Or it was as if the complex plane were a smooth surface sloping down toward three deep valleys. A marble starting from anywhere on the plane should roll into one of the valleys—but which?"|Chaos|"James Gleick"

Spiegel, an astrophysicist, at one o’clock in the morning in the lobby of a Boston hotel, where they were attending a conference on general relativity. “Hey, I’ve just been listening to the Lorenz attractor,” Spiegel said. Spiegel had transmuted this emblem of chaos, using some impromptu circuitry connected to a hi-fi set, into a looping slide-whistle antimelody. He brought Burke into the bar for a drink and explained."|Chaos|"James Gleick"
00:00|midnight|"The prediction was surprising, but Winfree’s experiments bore it out. “You go to a mosquito at midnight and give him a certain number of photons, and that particularly well-timed jolt turns off the mosquito’s clock. He’s an insomniac after that—he’ll doze, buzz for a while, all at random, and he’ll continue doing that for as long as you care to watch, or until you come along with another jolt. You’ve given him perpetual jet lag.” In the early seventies Winfree’s mathematical approach to circadian rhythms stirred little general interest, and it was hard to extend the laboratory technique to species that would object to sitting in little cages for months at a time."|Chaos|"James Gleick"

Mines was lying under the laboratory bench surrounded by twisted electrical equipment. A broken mechanism was attached to his chest over the heart and a piece of apparatus nearby was still recording the faltering heartbeat. He died without recovering consciousness.”"|Chaos|"James Gleick"
