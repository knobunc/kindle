12:00|midday|"Frowning, you go to the door of the apartment, pulling open the thin curtain. You’re not particularly concerned; your sessapinae haven’t even twitched, and anyway if there’s ever a shake down here in Castrima-under, everyone’s dead no matter how quickly they leave their homes. Outside there are lots of people up and about. A woman passes right by your door, carrying a big basket of the same mushrooms you almost ate; she nods at you distractedly as you come out, then almost loses her load as she tries to turn toward the noise and nearly bumps into a man pushing a covered, wheeled bin that stinks to the sky and is probably from the latrines. In a comm with no functional day-night cycle, Castrima effectively never sleeps, and you know they have six work shifts instead of the usual three because you’ve been put on one. It won’t start till midday—or twelvebell, as the Castrima folk say—when you’re supposed to look for some woman named Artith near the forge."|"The Obelisk Gate"|"N. K. Jemisin"
12:00|Noon|"Finally the man is done, and with a flat look in your direction that nevertheless conveys his opinion that you should have been the one to administer the food, he leaves. But when you straighten and open your mouth to ask more questions, Alabaster says, “I’m probably going to need to use that bedpan soon. I can’t control my bowels very well anymore, but at least they’re still regular.” At the look on your face, he smiles with only a hint of bitterness. “I don’t want you to see that any more than you want to see it. So why don’t we just say you should come back later? Noon seems to work better for not interfering with any of my gross natural functions.”"|"The Obelisk Gate"|"N. K. Jemisin"
00:00|midnight|"That’s midnight, the time-keeper calls. Eight hours till the vote in the morning."|"The Obelisk Gate"|"N. K. Jemisin"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"You offer her the respect of honesty. “Yes. You did.”
It’s two o’clock.
"|"The Obelisk Gate"|"N. K. Jemisin"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"By five o’clock, you’re thinking about sleeping. It’s been quieter than you expected. Lerna and Hjarka have come to join you at Ykka’s. No one says you’re keeping vigil, commiserating in silence, mourning Cutter, waiting for the world to end (again), but that’s what you’re doing. Ykka’s sitting on a divan with her arms wrapped around her knees and her head propped against the wall, gaze weary and empty of thought."|"The Obelisk Gate"|"N. K. Jemisin"
"ap 05:30"|"five thirty"|"Or maybe you can just call it Alabaster.
It’s five thirty.
"|"The Obelisk Gate"|"N. K. Jemisin"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"At seven o’clock, Lerna comes to where you huddle on the floor in front of Alabaster’s corpse. You barely hear him settle nearby, and you wonder why he’s come. He knows better. He should go, before you snap again and kill him, too."|"The Obelisk Gate"|"N. K. Jemisin"
"ap 07:45"|"seven forty-five"|"
At seven forty-five you sit alone again.
Lerna’s gone to speak to one of his assistants, and maybe to the Strongbacks who are watching you from the infirmary doorway. At the bottom of your runny-sack is a pocket for hiding things. It’s why you bought this particular runny-sack, years ago, from this particular leatherworker. When he showed you the pocket, you thought immediately of something that you wanted to put in it. Something that, as Essun, you didn’t let yourself think about often, because it was a thing of Syenite’s and she was dead. Yet you kept her remains."|"The Obelisk Gate"|"N. K. Jemisin"
"ap 08:00"|"Eight o’clock"|"Eight o’clock. Representatives of the comm’s households gather at the Flat Top."|"The Obelisk Gate"|"N. K. Jemisin"
00:00|midnight|"The twig jutted up out of a black splotch in his shirt, and the slice in his neck had curled over like gone meat. His bad eye was a swamp of black, but then, everything was black at midnight. His mouth was open, the lips drawing back over too-white teeth, several of which looked like they’d come out of a panther. He wasn’t breathing, and Pap wasn’t coming, and Nettie’s finger reached out as if it had a mind of its own and flicked one big, shiny, curved tooth."|"The Obelisk Gate"|"N. K. Jemisin"
