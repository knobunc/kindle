‘Six-thirteen.’
Gadfium looked at Rasfline, who was smiling thinly. ‘Has the Palace been in touch with the observatory since?’"|"Feersum Endjinn"|"Iain M. Banks"

06:13|"six-thirteen this morning"|"‘The circle began forming at six-thirteen this morning,’ the chief observer told them. ‘It was complete by six forty-two. All thirty-two stones are present. The distance between the stones is a uniform two metres - the same as their diameter. They have arranged themselves in a perfect circle with an accuracy of better than a tenth of a millimetre. The predicted-motion discrepancy factor for certain of the stones during the period they were forming the current pattern was as high as sixty per cent. It has never in the past exceeded twelve point three per cent and over the last decade has averaged below five per cent.’"|"Feersum Endjinn"|"Iain M. Banks"

Gad,’ she laughed gently, ‘all our preparations and cryptography went for nothing; the signal came in light all right, but not in any ancient code or any fancy wavelength, and not in frequency or amplitude modulation; they just manipulated the beam to make actual letters appear upon the plain, shining lines like the reflections waves cast on a wall or ceiling.’"|"Feersum Endjinn"|"Iain M.

Asura looked intently at the older man, who presently opened his eyes again and said, ‘Yes, we’re booked on a flight from SF del Apure, leaving at noon. I can be back on the return service a little after midnight. The jalop claims to be charged up, so I’ll drive us to the rail station. I’ve left a message for Cousin Ucubulaire in Serehfa. I dare say you two will manage to keep yourselves occupied without me?’ he said to Gil and Lucia, who both smiled."|"Feersum Endjinn"|"Iain M. Banks"
