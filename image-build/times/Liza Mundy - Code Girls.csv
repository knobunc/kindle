In such a massive fleet system, it would sometimes happen that an oblivious radioman would send a message in the clear—plain Japanese—that others were sending in code. The women could use the plain Japanese as a crib. The Japanese, like the Germans, also tended to send out fleet messages that were formulaic and patterned. Japanese merchant ship captains often sent a shoo-goichi message, stating what their exact position would be at noon. Anne learned the code groups for “noon position,” and she learned where the phrase was likely to appear. When she saw an enciphered group in that place, she could subtract the code group and obtain the additive."|"Code Girls"|"Liza Mundy"

When they did this, they would include a code group that stood for “begin message here” to show where the message started. The women learned the code groups for “begin message here”—there were several—and gained another point of entry. There also was something called “tailing.” Japanese encoders were told not to end a message at a certain point in an additive book and then begin the next message at the next additive number—they were supposed to choose another random starting point—but often, they were lazy or harried, and they did. The women mastered these ins and outs and quirks. Whenever they saw a mistake, they pounced. The shoo-goichi messages did more than help recover additives; the noon position would be swiftly radioed to an American submarine captain, who would be waiting for the Japanese ship when it appeared on the horizon."|"Code Girls"|"Liza Mundy"

They knew Yamamoto would be flying in a Japanese bomber the Americans called a Betty, escorted by Zero fighter planes. The Americans calculated their own flight plan to meet the route they anticipated Yamamoto would be taking, planning to encounter him over Bougainville. They flew for so long that the pilots were getting drowsy; the white coastline of Bougainville was racing beneath them when one of the pilots broke radio silence and shouted, “Bogeys! Eleven o’clock!” There they were, on the horizon: six Zeros, two Bettys. The Japanese did not see the Americans at first, but once they did, the escorting Zeros moved to block the U.S. fighter planes, firing so the bombers could escape. There was a hectic battle in which it never became clear who had shot down whom, but one Betty bomber plummeted into the trees, the other into the surf.

They understood now that some digits in early groups seemed to be exerting control over other digits, and they saw that if two-number pairs, such as 11 or 77, appeared in a certain place, another pair appeared elsewhere. It was like a call and response between groups. The numbers were controlling one another’s behavior in a way that suggested they were interdependent.

The 2468 code routed nearly every single maru making its way around the Pacific to supply the Japanese Army. As with Japanese Navy vessels, many marus sent a daily message giving the exact location where they would be at noon. The information would be turned over to American sub commanders. “What nicer bit of information would be necessary for a submarine than to know that the ship was supposed to be at a certain spot at a certain day?” Kullback said later. The U.S. military employed ruses so the Japanese wouldn’t know the maru sinkings were the result of a broken code. American planes would be sent up so it would look as though they had spotted the maru from the air.

On May 3, 1944, Department K read a series of messages indicating the noon positions through May 8 of fifteen ships headed for New Guinea. Shortly thereafter, the U.S. Navy sank four of them. Another memo pointed out that the New York Times had reported on one of many successes. In September 1943, a Times piece had noted a Pacific engagement in which “our strongly escorted medium bombers attacked an enemy convoy of five cargo ships and two destroyers which arrived during the night with reinforcements and supplies for the enemy garrison. Coming in at masthead height, our bombers scored direct hits with 1,000 pound bombs on three freight transports, each of 7,000 tons, sinking them.” The internal Arlington Hall memo noted that a Times reader probably thought it was “chance” that the bombing mission found the convoy.

There, a commander named Kenneth Knowles, working with a counterpart tracking room in England, would make decisions about whether to use the intelligence defensively to reroute convoys or offensively to sink the U-boats. The downtown tracking room at first was staffed by enlisted men, but as the war proceeded, WAVES took over there as well. One male officer said the WAVES did a better job because they had had to meet stiffer selection requirements. When the intelligence they generated was passed to the fleet for action, the source of the information was never revealed.

It was nearing midnight as Ann, wearing her uniform, turned off Nebraska Avenue and entered the Naval Communications Annex compound. She passed the now familiar double line of Marine guards, showed her badge, saluted the men as she went past, and made her way into the rooms that held the German Enigma section, where she relieved the officer heading the evening watch. Ann was a watch officer, now—a lieutenant—and supervised the midnight watch of women reading Enigma traffic. She had trained on the pistol range and knew how to shoot the gun that was always kept lying on the watch officer’s desk.

Ann, knowing German, was able to read the words even before the Enigma message was taken upstairs and translated into English. It was a terse message, sent by central command to all U-boats on the circuit. “Enemy landing at the mouth of the Seine.” All up and down the coast of France, the Enigma machines were chattering, spitting out the same warning. “Enemy landing at the mouth of the Seine.” And here in northwest Washington, the women read the words as quickly as the U-boat crews themselves."|"Code Girls"|"Liza Mundy"

At 1:40 in the morning they were warned to “make no reference of any kind to the fact that we know about the invasion, even after the news comes out officially,” according to the watch officer log. All night the women bolted up and down the stairs of the laboratory building, taking the messages to the translators one floor above—even though Ann could read them herself. They felt excitement, relief, horror. They well knew how momentous the event was. But how was it evolving? They could not be sure.

12:00|"High Noon"|"“Liza Mundy’s Code Girls reveals one of World War II’s last remaining secrets: the true tale of the young American women who helped shorten the war and saved thousands of lives by breaking the codes of the German and Japanese armed forces. But it’s also a superbly researched and stirringly written social history of a pivotal chapter in the struggle for women’s rights, told through the powerful and poignant stories of the individuals involved. In exploring the vast, obscure, and makeshift offices of wartime Washington where these women performed seemingly impossible deeds, Mundy has discovered a birthplace of modern America.”
—Glenn Frankel, Pulitzer Prize–winning author of High Noon
“Code Girls is a riveting account of the thousands of young coeds who flooded into Washington to help America win World War II. Liza Mundy has written a thrilling page-turner that illuminates the patriotism, rivalry, and sexism of the code breakers’ world.”"|"Code Girls"|"Liza Mundy"
