At three, Michael was taken to a playgroup in the hall of St Cuthbert’s, Philbeach Gardens: a cosy, eccentric set-up, where the lady in charge kept order by issuing the children with linoleum ‘islands’ on which they would be asked to sit if they threatened to become unruly. At five, he moved on to the local state primary school, St Matthias, across Warwick Road. It seemed a cavernous, grim place to a small boy, with painted brick walls as in a prison or hospital, and windows so high that if a child tried to look out all he could see were small segments of sky."|"Michael Morpurgo"|"Maggie Fergusson"

In fact, once you have moved through the wooden postern from the city into King’s Mint Yard, it is easy to feel you have left the present behind, and have entered instead a world of cloisters, arches and twisting stone stairways. Lawns and passages have Arthurian names – the Green Court, the Dark Entry – and Tudor buildings jostle with medieval. Michael’s house was Galpin’s, Norman in origin. It was bordered on one side by the old pilgrims’ lodgings and on the other by the thick, flint city walls round which a night-watchman walked in the dark. He came right past Michael’s dormitory window, intoning ‘Twelve o’clock, fine night and all’s well’ as the great cathedral bell chimed midnight."|"Michael Morpurgo"|"Maggie Fergusson"

He had been placed in Victory College, in Alamein Company, and from 6 a.m., when he and his fellow cadets presented themselves for drill on the parade ground, his days were filled with exercises, inspections, kit polishing and running with weights up and down Sandhurst’s notorious ‘Heartbreak Hill’. All this took place to the accompaniment of volleys of abuse from Sergeant-Major Bostock, later the model for Sergeant Hanley in Private Peaceful: ‘What are you, sir? I’ll tell you what you are! You are an effing waste of space, sir! Get running, sir, or I’ll castrate you with the rough end of a ragman’s trumpet, sir!’"|"Michael Morpurgo"|"Maggie Fergusson"
00:00|midnight|"Next to St Faith’s, and separated from it by a high wall, was an old people’s home, Meadowcroft, with a large garden. One of the ways that the boys liked to prove their courage was to creep out of their dormitories at night, climb over the Meadowcroft wall, and go for what they called ‘a midnight walk’. This, needless to say, was strictly forbidden, and the standard punishment was a beating. But for the boys in Firwood Michael introduced a new rule. ‘I don’t mind if you go for a midnight walk,’ he told them. ‘But, if you do, you must write a poem about it.’"|"Michael Morpurgo"|"Maggie Fergusson"

For the last half-hour of the school day, therefore, she asked the teachers to read them stories. As the weeks went by Michael found that he looked forward to this half-hour. Drawing on his memories of Kippe reading to him as a child he found that, if he could himself enter into a story, he could hold the children’s attention perfectly until the bell went. But some stories worked better than others, and one February afternoon, reading Year Six the first chapter of Stig of the Dump, he realised he had lost them."|"Michael Morpurgo"|"Maggie Fergusson"

"ap 11:00"|eleven|"Clare had always been acutely aware of those less fortunate than herself. In early childhood she had a strong religious streak. Her sister Christine remembers her, as a small girl, ‘staring out of the window one Christmas Eve, hoping to see God and his angels’, and ‘taking her role as Mary in the school nativity play extraordinarily seriously’. At eleven she was sent to a Quaker boarding school, The Hall, near Wincanton in Somerset. Influenced by the formidable but inspiring headmistress, Monica Brooks, she developed a lifelong passion for the countryside, for poetry, and for reaching out to those on the margins of society. Girls at the Hall learned to think of service to others as far more important than any kind of academic success. In their free time they knitted blanket squares for a village in Switzerland, set up after the war to offer refugee children an education of ‘head, heart, and hands’."|"Michael Morpurgo"|"Maggie Fergusson"
12:00|midday|"On a holiday in France, he and Clare had stopped one hot midday in a medieval town with a moated château at its centre. As nobody seemed to be about, they wandered across the drawbridge. It was only when they were in the shady courtyard that they noticed towels and clothes draped from the windows. On enquiring in the town, they discovered that this was a colonie de vacances, a ‘holiday colony’, where working-class urban children could escape the city for a week or so and get a taste of outdoor life – canoeing, walking in the forests, cooking on campfires. It was the first time Michael or Clare had come across such an enterprise, and they were moved by it."|"Michael Morpurgo"|"Maggie Fergusson"

During lambing, he battles with a combination of sub-zero temperatures and a severe shortage of sleep: ‘When you turn out yet again at 3 in the morning on a freezing windy night,’ he notes on 3 January, ‘it is a little difficult to be even-tempered with the milking cows 4 hours later down in the dairy.’ Three months on, in late March, the temperatures have barely risen, and it is time for ploughing in gale-force winds and lashing, horizontal rain."|"Michael Morpurgo"|"Maggie Fergusson"

They divided into three groups. One walked with Graham Ward to the milking parlour, to help milk the cows and feed the calves. Another piled into the back of David Ward’s trailer, and bumped down the lane to see to the pigs, sheep and beef cattle.

On Tuesday morning Michael walked the children over the moor to Hatherleigh to see the livestock market. On Thursday afternoon he took them to Iddesleigh to visit the village hall, with its photographs of turn-of-the-century children in hobnailed boots; and to wander round the church, and read the headstones in the graveyard. It was a learning experience for the villagers as well as the children: ‘We had none of us ever seen a black child,’ says Joan Weeks."|"Michael Morpurgo"|"Maggie Fergusson"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"Like Cinderella’s carriage, the limousine had disappeared by the end of the evening. Michael and Clare returned to Paddington by tube, caught the night train home, and by seven o’clock the following morning were getting ready to set off for work at Nethercott. Then the telephone rang. It was Ted Hughes, suggesting that he and Michael go out and spend the day together. They did a bit of fishing, then poked about in bookshops and antique shops in Bideford – ‘Ted loved pottering’. The Whitbread was not mentioned until, over tea in a café, Ted leaned forwards. He and Carol had watched the award ceremony on television. Michael must understand that these things did not matter: they were all a lot of nonsense. ‘You wrote a fine book,’ he said. ‘And you’ll write a finer one.’"|"Michael Morpurgo"|"Maggie Fergusson"

From 6 to 7 p.m. he was out with them again, milking, and feeding the pigs, lambs and calves.

00:00|midnight|"A few months after its British publication, Kensuke’s Kingdom was published in Canada, and Michael went to help launch it in Toronto. From there he caught a night ferry across Lake Ontario. He was almost the only passenger on board as the ferry ploughed through the dark water, and when it arrived at Niagara-on-the-Lake at midnight his father was on the quayside to meet him. They had hardly ever spent time alone with each other, but now they had three days together – ‘and they were quiet, gentle, good days’. They breakfasted in a diner; they pottered about the town, Tony Bridge pedalling a giant tricycle like Mr McHenry in The Magic Roundabout. Tony was acting in the evenings in Conan Doyle’s A Story of Waterloo, and Michael saw how, like himself, his father was two people: a passionate, energetic man who strode and bellowed about the stage; a shy, sometimes painfully reticent man in private life. After one performance Tony threw a party so that Michael might meet the rest of the company at the Shaw Festival Theatre. The theatre had become his home, Michael saw, and his fellow actors his surrogate family."|"Michael Morpurgo"|"Maggie Fergusson"
"ap < 03:00"|"Nearly 300"|"Once Michael was back at home in Devon one small exhibit in Piet Chielens’s museum began to gnaw at his imagination. It was a letter from a British army officer to a mother in the Midlands informing her that her son had been court martialled, and was to be shot at dawn. Nearly 300 soldiers had been executed in this way, Michael learned, most for desertion or ‘cowardice’, two simply because they had fallen asleep at their posts. Many were known to be suffering from shell-shock, and a disproportionate number were Irish or black. As he began to study the records of their short trials, it became clear that very often executions had taken place ahead of major attacks – as a sort of warning to the other soldiers. ‘There was an agenda here,’ Michael says. Yet, despite repeated pleas from soldiers’ descendants, the British government had doggedly refused to grant retrospective pardons."|"Michael Morpurgo"|"Maggie Fergusson"
"ap 05:59"|"one minute to six"|"Initially there were to have been just two Peaceful brothers; then a letter arrived from Scotland. It was from the mother of three sons, one of them, Joe, autistic. Joe had loved The Butterfly Lion; he had rocked with pleasure when his mother read it aloud to him. Michael was touched by this. He had learned over the years, first from his sister-in-law Anna Lane, who has Down’s syndrome, then from children visiting Nethercott, that those who appear weak and broken often have gifts of the heart that many ‘normal’ people lack. In response to the letter he created a third brother, Big Joe, a gentle giant filled with affection, humour and intuitive wisdom, around whom the Peaceful family revolves. It is to Big Joe, and his favourite song, ‘Oranges and Lemons’, that Charlie Peaceful’s thoughts turn for comfort when, at one minute to six, he walks out to face the firing squad."|"Michael Morpurgo"|"Maggie Fergusson"
"ap > 02:00"|"after two"|"Simon Reade, then director of the Bristol Old Vic, heard the reading in his bath, and was struck by the possibility that Private Peaceful might make a powerful one-man play. He got in touch with Michael; they arranged to have lunch. Reade had decided that, for theatrical purposes, the ending of the story would need to be changed: it was Tommo, and not Charlie, who must die on stage. He sensed that he would need to tread carefully in suggesting this. Behind all Michael’s apparent confidence, Reade was aware of a nagging sense of inferiority – ‘I think he asks himself, “Am I a major minor writer, or a minor major one?”’ He was also aware of an unusual warmth and generosity. That first lunch was the beginning of a close and enduring friendship. For Reade, whose own father died when he was very young, Michael has become ‘a quasi father’, who has nursed him through a time of great trauma. ‘He doesn’t drop you when things get tough,’ Reade says. ‘He’s loyal.’ It was the beginning, too, of a fruitful working relationship. The one-man play of Private Peaceful, after two sell-out seasons at the Bristol Old Vic, went on to tour the country to enormous acclaim."|"Michael Morpurgo"|"Maggie Fergusson"
