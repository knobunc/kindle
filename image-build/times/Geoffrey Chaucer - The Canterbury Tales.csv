We shullen yeven rekeninge of everich ydel word.« / Ther shul we han a juge that may nat been deceyved ne corrupt. And why? For certes, alle oure thoghtes been discovered as to hym, ne for preyere ne for meede he shal nat been corrupt. / And therfore seith Salomon, »The wratthe of God ne wol nat spare no wight for preyere ne for yifte.« And therfore at the Day of Doom ther nys noon hope to escape. /Wherfore, as seith Seint Anselm, »Ful greet angwyssh shul the synful folk have at that tyme. / Ther shal the stierne and wrothe juge sitte above, and under hym the horrible put of helle open to destroyen hym that noot biknowen his synnes, whiche synnes openly been shewed biforn God and biforn every creature. / And in the left syde, mo develes than herte may bithynke, for to harye and drawe the synful soules to the peyne of helle. / And withinne the hertes of folk shal be the bitynge conscience, and withoute forth shal be the world al brennynge. / Whider shal thanne the wrecched synful man flee to hiden hym? Certes, he may nat hiden hym; he moste come forth and shewen hym.« / For certes, as seith Seint Jerome, »The erthe shal casten hym out of hym, and the see also, and the eyr also, that shal be ful of thonder clappes and lightnynges.« / Now soothly, whoso wel remembreth hym of thise thynges, I gesse that his synne shal nat turne hym in delit, but to greet sorwe for drede of the peyne of helle. / And therfore seith Job to God, »Suffre, Lord, that I may a while biwaille and wepe er I go withoute returning to the derke lond covered with the derknesse of deeth, / to the lond of mysese and of derknesse where as is the shadwe of deeth, where as ther is noon ordre or ordinaunce, but grisly drede that evere shal laste.« / Loo, heere may ye seen that Job preyde respit a while, to biwepe and waille his trespas, for soothly a day of respit is bettre than al the tresor of the world. / And forasmuche as a man may acquiten hymself biforn God by penitence in this world, and nat by tresor, therfore sholde he preye to God to yeve him respit a while, to biwepe and biwaillen his trespas. / For certes, al the sorwe that a man myghte make fro the bigynnyng of the world nys but a litel thyng at regard of the sorwe of helle. / The cause why that Job clepeth helle ›the lond of derknesse,‹ / understondeth that he clepeth it ›londe‹ or erthe for it is stable and nevere shal faille; ›dirk,‹ for he that is in helle hath defaute of light material. /For certes, the derke light that shal come out of the fyr that evere shal brenne shal turne hym al to peyne that is in helle; for it sheweth hym to the horrible develes that hym tormenten. / ›Covered with the derknesse of deeth‹ – that is to seyn that he that is in helle shal have defaute of the sighte of God, for certes the sighte of God is the lyf perdurable. / ›The derknesse of deeth‹ been the synnes that the wrecched man hath doon whiche that destourben hym to see the face of God, right as dooth a derk clowde bitwixe us and the sonne. / ›Lond of misese,‹ by cause that ther been three maneres of defautes agayn three thynges that folk of this world han in this present lyf, that is to seyn, honours, delices, and richesses. / Agayns honour have they in helle shame and confusioun. / For wel ye woot that men clepen ›honour‹ the reverence that man doth to man; but in helle is noon honour ne reverence. For certes, namoore reverence shal be doon there to a kyng than to a knave. / For which God seith by the prophete Jeremye, »Thilke folk that me despisen shul been in despit.« / ›Honour‹ is eek cleped greet lordshipe; ther shal no man serven other but of harm and torment. ›Honour‹ is eek cleped greet dignitee and heighnesse, but in helle shul they been al fortroden of develes. / And God seith, »The horrible develes shulle goon and comen upon the hevedes of the dampned folk.« And this is forasmuche as the hyer that they were in this present lyf the more shulle they been abated and defouled in helle. / Agayns the richesses of this world shul they han mysese of poverte. And this poverte shal been in foure thinges: /in defaute of tresor, of which that David seith, »The riche folk that embraceden and oneden al hire herte to tresor of this world shul slepe in the slepynge of deeth; and nothyng ne shal they fynden in hir handes of al hir tresor.« / And mooreover the myseyse of helle shal been in defaute of mete and drinke. / For God seith thus by Moyses, »They shul been wasted with hunger, and the briddes of helle shul devouren hem with the bitter deeth, and the galle of the dragon shal been hire drynke, and the venym of the dragon hire morsels.« / And fortherover, hire myseyse shal been in defaute of clothyng, for they shulle be naked in body as of clothyng, save the fyr in which they brenne and othere filthes. / And naked shul they been of soule as of alle manere vertues, which that is the clothyng of the soule. Where been thanne the gaye robes and the softe shetes and the smale shertes? / Loo, what seith God of hem by the prophete Ysaye, that under hem shul been strawed motthes, and hire covertures shulle been of wormes of helle. / And fortherover, hir myseyse shal been in defaute of freendes, for he nys nat poure that hath goode freendes. But there is no frend, / for neither God ne no creature shal been freend to hem, and everich of hem shall haten oother with deedly hate. / »The sones and the doghtren shullen rebellen agayns fader and mooder, and kynrede agayns kynrede, and chiden and despisen everich of hem oother,« bothe day and nyght, as God seith by the prophete Michias. / And the lovynge children, that whilom loveden so flesshly everich oother, wolden everich of hem eten oother if they myghte. / For how sholden they love togidre in the peyne of helle, whan they hated ech of hem oother in the prosperitee of this lyf? / For truste wel, hir flesshly love was deedly hate, as seith the prophete David, »Whoso that loveth wikkednesse, he hateth his soule.« / And whoso hateth his owene soule, certes he may love noon oother wight in no manere. / And therfore in helle is no solas ne no freendshipe, but evere the moore flesshly kynredes that been in helle, the moore cursynges, the moore chidynges, and the moore deedly hate ther is among hem. / And fortherover, they shul have defaute of alle manere delices. For certes, delices been after the appetites of the fyve wittes, as sighte, herynge, smellynge, savorynge, and touchynge. / But in helle hir sighte shal be ful of derknesse and of smoke, and therfore ful of teeres; and hir herynge ful of waymentynge and of gryntynge of teeth, as seith Jesu Crist; / hir nosethirles shullen be ful of stynkynge stynk. And as seith Ysaye the prophete, »Hir savoryng shal be ful of bitter galle.« / And touchynge of al hir body ycovered with »fir that nevere shal quenche and with wormes that nevere shul dyen,« as God seith by the mouth of Ysaye. / And for as muche as they shul nat wene that they may dyen for peyne, and by hir deeth flee fro peyne, that may they understonden by the word of Job that seith, »Ther as is the shadwe of deeth.« / Certes a shadwe hath the liknesse of the thyng of which it is shadwe, but shadwe is nat the same thyng of which it is shadwe. / Right so fareth the peyne of helle. It is lyk deeth for the horrible anguissh, and why? For it peyneth hem evere as though they sholde dye anon; but certes they shal nat dye. / For as seith Seint Gregorie, »To wrecche caytyves shal be deeth withoute deeth, and ende withouten ende, and defaute withoute failynge. / For hir deeth shal alwey lyven, and hir ende shal everemo bigynne, and hir defaute shal nat faille.« / And therfore seith Seint John the Evaungelist, »They shullen folwe deeth and they shul nat fynde hym, and they shul desiren to dye and deeth shal flee fro hem.« / And eek Job seith that in helle is noon ordre of rule. / And al be it so that God hath creat alle thynges in right ordre, and nothing withouten ordre, but alle thynges been ordeyned and nombred, yet nathelees they that been dampned been nothyng in the ordre, ne holden noon ordre, / for the erthe ne shal bere hem no fruyt. / For as the prophete David seith, »God shal destroie the fruyt of the erthe as fro hem,« ne water ne shal yeve hem no moisture, ne the eyr no refresshyng, ne fyr no light. / For as seith Seint Basilie, »The brennynge of the fyr of this world shal God yeven in helle to hem that been dampned, / but the light and the cleernesse shal be yeven in hevene to his children,« right as the goode man yeveth flessh to his children and bones to his houndes. / And for they shullen have noon hope to escape, seith Seint Job atte laste that ther shal horrour and grisly drede dwellen withouten ende. / Horrour is alwey drede of harm that is to come, and this drede shal evere dwelle in the hertes of hem that been dampned. And therfore han they lorn al hire hope for sevene causes. / First, for God that is hir juge shal be withouten mercy to hem, and they may nat plese hym ne noon of his halwes; ne they ne may yeve nothyng for hir raunsoun; / ne they have no voys to speke to hym; ne they may nat fle fro peyne; ne they have no goodnesse in hem that they mowe shewe to delivere hem fro peyne. / And therfore seith Salomon, »The wikked man dyeth, and whan he is deed he shal have noon hope to escape fro peyne.« / Whoso thanne wolde wel understande these peynes, and bithynke hym weel that he hath deserved thilke peynes for his synnes, certes, he sholde have moore talent to siken and to wepe than for to syngen and to pleye. / For as that seith Salomon, »Whoso that hadde the science to knowe the peynes that been establissed and ordeyned for synne, he wolde make sorwe.« / »Thilke science,« as seith Seint Augustyn, »maketh a man to waymenten in his herte.« /"|"The Canterbury Tales"|"Geoffrey Chaucer"
12:00|noon|"The sixte thyng that oghte moeve a man to contricioun is the hope of three thynges: that is to seyn, foryifnesse of synne, and the yifte of grace wel for to do, and the glorie of hevene with which God shal guerdone a man for his goode dedes. / And for as muche as Jesu Crist yeveth us thise yiftes of his largesse and of his sovereyn bountee, therfore is he cleped Iesus Nazarenus rex Iudeorum. / Iesus is to seyn ›saveour‹ or ›salvacioun,‹ on whom men shul hope to have foryifnesse of synnes, which that is proprely salvacioun of synnes. / And therfore seyde the aungel to Joseph, »Thou shalt clepen his name Jesus, that shal saven his peple of hir synnes.« / And heerof seith Seint Peter, »Ther is noon other name under hevene that is yeve to any man by which a man may be saved, but only Jesus.« / Nazarenus is as muche for to seye as ›florisshynge,‹ in which a man shal hope that he that yeveth hym remission of synnes shal yeve hym eek grace wel for to do. For in the flour is hope of fruit in tyme comynge, and in foryifnesse of synnes hope of grace wel for to do. / »I was atte dore of thyn herte,« seith Jesus, »and cleped for to entre.

God woot that what day that ye eten therof, youre eyen shul opene and ye shul been as goddes knowynge good and harm.« / The womman thanne saugh that the tree was good to feedyng, and fair to the eyen, and delitable to the sighte. She took of the fruyt of the tree and eet it, and yaf to hire housbonde and he eet, and anoon the eyen of hem bothe openeden. / And whan that they knewe that they were naked, they sowed of figeleves a maner of breches to hiden hire membres. / There may ye seen that deedly synne hath first suggestion of the feend, as sheweth heere by the naddre; and afterward, the delit of the flessh, as sheweth heere by Eve; and after that, the consentynge of resoun, as sheweth heere by Adam. / For trust wel, though so were that the feend tempted Eve, that is to seyn the flessh, and the flessh hadde delit in the beautee of the fruyt defended, yet certes, til that resoun, that is to seyn Adam, consented to the etynge of the fruyt, yet stood he in th'estaat of innocence. / Of thilke Adam tooke we thilke synne original; for of hym flesshly descended be we alle, and engendred of vile and corrupt matiere. /And whan the soule is put in oure body, right anon is contract original synne, and that that was erst but oonly peyne of concupiscence is afterward bothe peyne and synne. / And therfore be we alle born sones of wratthe and of dampnacioun perdurable, if it nere baptesme that we receyven which bynymeth us the culpe.

But lat the justice bewar that he do it rightfully, and that he do it nat for delit to spille blood, but for kepynge of rightwisenesse. / Another homycide is that is doon for necessitee, as whan o man sleeth another in his defendaunt, and that he ne may noon ootherwise escape from his owene deeth. / But certeinly, if he may escape withouten manslaughtre of his adversarie, and sleeth hym, he doth synne, and he shal bere penance as for deedly synne. / Eek if a man by caas or aventure shete an arwe or caste a stoon with which he sleeth a man, he is homycide. / Eek if a womman by necligence overlyeth hire child in hir slepyng, it is homycide and deedly synne. / Eek whan man destourbeth concepcioun of a child, and maketh a womman outher bareyne by drynkinge venemouse herbes, thurgh which she may nat conceyve, or sleeth a child by drynkes wilfully, or elles putteth certeine material thynges in hire secree places to slee the child, / or elles doth unkyndely synne by which man or womman shedeth hire nature in manere or in place ther as a child may nat be conceived, or elles if a womman have conceyved and hurt hirself and sleeth the child, yet is it homycide. / What seye we eek of wommen that mordren hir children for drede of worldly shame? Certes, an horrible homycide. /Homycide is eek if a man approcheth to a womman by desir of lecherye, thurgh which the child is perissed, or elles smyteth a womman wityngly, thurgh which she leseth hir child.

What seith Seint John eek in thys matere? / Seint Gregorie eek seith that no wight seketh precious array but oonly for veyne glorie to been honoured the moore biforn the peple. / It is a greet folye, a womman to have a fair array outward and in hirself be foul inward. / A wyf sholde eek be mesurable in lookinge and in berynge and in lawghynge, and discreet in alle hire wordes and hire dedes. / And aboven alle worldly thyng she sholde loven hire housbonde with al hire herte, and to hym be trewe of hir body. / So sholde an housbonde eek be to his wyf. For sith that al the body is the housbondes, so sholde hire herte been, or elles ther is bitwixe hem two as in that no parfit mariage. / Thanne shal men understonde that for thre thynges a man and his wyf flesshly mowen assemble. The firste is in entente of engendrure of children to the service of God, for certes that is the cause final of matrimoyne. / Another cause is to yelden everich of hem to oother the dette of hire bodies, for neither of hem hath power over his owene body. The thridde is for to eschewe leccherye and vileynye. The ferthe is for sothe deedly synne. /As to the firste, it is meritorie. The seconde also, for as seith the decree that she hath merite of chastitee that yeldeth to hire housbonde the dette of hir body, ye though it be agayn hir lykynge and the lust of hire herte. / The thridde manere is venyal synne, and trewely scarsly may ther any of thise be withoute venial synne for the corrupcion and for the delit. / The fourthe manere is for to understonde, if they assemble oonly for amorous love and for noon of the forseyde causes, but for to accomplice thilke brennynge delit, they rekke nevere how ofte, soothly it is deedly synne. And yet with sorwe somme folk wol peynen hem moore to doon than to hire appetit suffiseth. /"|"The Canterbury Tales"|"Geoffrey Chaucer"
12:00|noon|"The seconde manere of chastitee is for to been a clene wydewe and eschue the embracynges of man, and desiren the embracynge of Jesu Crist. / Thise been tho that han been wyves and han forgoon hire housbondes, and eek wommen that han doon leccherie and been releeved by penitence. / And certes, if that a wyf koude kepen hire al chaast by licence of hir housbonde so that she yeve nevere noon occasion that he agilte, it were to hire a greet merite. / Thise manere wommen that observen chastitee moste be clene in herte as well as in body and in thoght, and mesurable in clothynge and in contenaunce, and been abstinent in etynge and drynkynge, in spekynge, and in dede. They been the vessel or the boyste of the blissed Magdelene, that fulfilleth Hooly Chirche of good odour. / The thridde manere of chastitee is virginitee, and it bihoveth that she be hooly in herte and clene of body; thanne is she spouse to Jesu Crist, and she is the lyf of angeles. / She is the preisynge of this world, and she is as thise martirs in egalitee; she hath in hire that tonge may nat telle ne herte thynke. / Virginitee baar oure lord Jesu Crist, and virgine was hymselve. /"|"The Canterbury Tales"|"Geoffrey Chaucer"
12:00|noon|"Now for as muche as the second partie of penitence stant in confessioun of mouth, as I bigan in the firste chapitre, I seye, Seint Augustyn seith, / »Synne is every word and every dede and al that men coveiten agayn the lawe of Jesu Crist.« And this is for to synne in herte, in mouth, and in dede, by thy five wittes, that been sighte, herynge, smellynge, tastynge or savourynge, and feelynge. / Now is it good to understonde that that agreggeth muchel every synne. / Thow shalt considere what thow art that doost the synne, wheither thou be male or femele, yong or oold, gentil or thral, free or servant, hool or syk, wedded or sengle, ordred or unordred, wys or fool, clerk or seculeer, / if she be of thy kynrede bodily or goostly or noon, if any of thy kynrede have synned with hire or noon, and manye mo thynges. /"|"The Canterbury Tales"|"Geoffrey Chaucer"
12:00|noon|"Another circumstaunce is this: wheither it be doon in fornicacioun or in avowtrie or noon, incest or noon, mayden or noon, in manere of homicide or noon, horrible grete synnes or smale, and how longe thou hast continued in synne. / The thridde circumstaunce is the place ther thou hast do synne, wheither in oother mennes hous or in thyn owene, in feeld or in chirche or in chirche hawe, in chirche dedicat or noon. / For if the chirche be halwed and man or womman spille his kynde in with that place by wey of synne, or by wikked temptacioun, the chirche is entredited til it be reconciled by the bishop; / and the preest that dide swich a vileynye, to terme of al his lif he sholde namore synge masse, and if he dide he sholde doon deedly synne at every tyme that he so songe masse. / The fourthe circumstaunce is by whiche mediatours or by whiche messagers as for enticement or for consentement to bere compaignye with felaweshipe, for many a wrecche for to bere compaignye shal go to the devel of helle. / Wherfore they that eggen or consenten to the synne been parteners of the synne, and of the dampnacioun of the synnere. / The fifthe circumstaunce is how manye tymes that he hath synned, if it be in his mynde, and how ofte that he hath falle. / For he that ofte falleth in synne, he despiseth the mercy of God, and encreesseth hys synne, and is unkynde to Crist; and he wexeth the moore fieble to withstonde synne, and synneth the moore lightly, / and the latter ariseth, and is the moore eschew for to shryven hym, namely, to hym that is his confessour. / For which that folk whan they falle agayn in hir olde folies, outher they forleten hir olde confessours al outrely, or elles they departen hir shrift in diverse places. But soothly, swich departed shrift deserveth no mercy of God of his synnes. / The sixte circumstaunce is why that a man synneth, as by whiche temptacioun, and if hymself procure thilke temptacioun, or by the excitynge of oother folk; or if he synne with a womman by force, or by hire owene assent; / or if the womman, maugree hir heed, hath been afforced, or noon. This shal she telle, for coveitise or for poverte, and if it was hire procurynge or noon, and swiche manere harneys. / The seventhe circumstaunce is in what manere he hath doon his synne, or how that she hath suffred that folk han doon to hire. / And the same shal the man telle pleynly with alle circumstaunces, and wheither he hath synned with comune bordel wommen or noon, / or doon his synne in hooly tymes or noon, in fastyng tymes or noon, or biforn his shrifte, or after his latter shrifte, / and hath peraventure broken therfore his penance enjoyned, by whos help and whos conseil, by sorcerie or craft, al moste be toold. / Alle thise thynges, after that they been grete or smale, engreggen the conscience of man, and eek the preest that is thy juge may the bettre been avysed of his juggement in yevynge of thy penaunce, and that is after thy contricioun. / For understond wel that after tyme that a man hath defouled his baptesme by synne, if he wole come to salvacioun ther is noon other wey but by penitence and shrifte and satisfaccioun, / and namely by the two if ther be a confessour to which he may shriven hym, and the thridde if he have lyf to parfournen it. /"|"The Canterbury Tales"|"Geoffrey Chaucer"
12:00|noon|"The seconde condicion of verray confession is that it be hastily doon, for certes if a man hadde a deedly wounde, evere the lenger that he taried to warisshe hymself, the moore wolde it corrupte and haste hym to his deeth, and eek the wounde wolde be the wors for to heele. / And right so fareth synne that longe tyme is in a man unshewed. / Certes, a man oghte hastily shewen his synnes for manye causes, as for drede of deeth that cometh ofte sodenly and is in no certeyn what tyme it shal be, ne in what place. And eek the drecchynge of o synne draweth in another, / and eek the lenger that he tarieth, the ferther he is fro Crist. And if he abide to his laste day, scarsly may he shryven hym or remembre hym of his synnes or repenten hym for the grevous maladie of his deeth. /And for as muche as he ne hath nat in his lyf herkned Jesu Crist whanne he hath spoken, he shal crie to Jesu Crist at his laste day and scarsly wol he herkne hym. /And understond that this condicioun moste han foure thynges. Thi shrift moste be purveyed bifore and avysed, for wikked haste dooth no profit. And that a man konne shryve hym of his synnes, be it of pride, or of envye, and so forth of the speces and circumstances; / / and that he have comprehended in hys mynde the nombre and the greetnesse of his synnes, and how longe that he hath leyn in synne; / and eek that he be contrit of his synnes and in stidefast purpos, by the grace of God, nevere eft to falle in synne; and eek that he drede and countrewaite hymself that he fle the occasiouns of synne to whiche he is enclyned. / Also thou shalt shryve thee of alle thy synnes to o man, and nat a parcel to o man and a parcel to another, that is to understonde, in entente to departe thy confessioun as for shame or drede, for it nys but stranglynge of thy soule. / For certes, Jesu Crist is entierly al good; in hym nys noon inperfeccioun; and therfore outher he foryeveth al parfitly or never a deel. / I seye nat that if thow be assigned to the penitauncer for certein synne that thow art bounde to shewen hym al the remenaunt of thy synnes, of whiche thow hast be shryven to thy curaat, but if it like to thee of thyn humylitee. This is no departynge of shrifte. / Ne I seye nat, theras I speke of divisioun of confessioun, that if thou have licence for to shryve thee to a discreet and an honeste preest, where thee liketh, and by licence of thy curat, that thow ne mayst wel shryve thee to him of alle thy synnes. / But lat no blotte be bihynde; lat no synne been untoold, as fer as thow hast remembraunce. /And whan thou shalt be shriven to thy curaat, telle hym eek alle the synnes that thow hast doon syn thou were last yshryven.

12:00|noon|"Also the verray shrifte axeth certeine condiciouns. First, that thow shryve thee by thy free wil, noght constreyned, ne for shame of folk, ne for maladie, ne swiche thynges.

Ne he shal nat nayte ne denye his synne, ne wratthe hym agayn the preest for his amonestynge to leve synne. / The seconde condicioun is that thy shrift be laweful, that is to seyn, that thow that shryvest thee, and eek the preest that hereth thy confessioun, been verraily in the feith of Hooly Chirche, / and that a man ne be nat despeired of the mercy of Jesu Crist, as Caym or Judas. / And eek a man moot accusen hymself of his owene trespas, and nat another; but he shal blame and wyten hymself and his owene malice of his synne, and noon oother. /But nathelees, if that another man be occasioun or enticere of his synne, or the estaat of a persone be swich thurgh which his synne is agregged, or elles that he may nat pleynly shryven hym but he telle the persone with which he hath synned, thanne may he telle, / so that his entente ne be nat to bakbite the persone, but oonly to declaren his confessioun. /"|"The Canterbury Tales"|"Geoffrey Chaucer"
