06:00|"six in the morning"|"It’s not often I wake up at six in the morning and find I’ve overslept, but it happened to me on my second morning at Polyface. By the time I hauled my six-foot self out of the five-foot bed in Lucille’s guest room, everyone was already at work. In fact, morning chores were nearly done. Shockingly, chores at Polyface start as soon as the sun comes up. Even worse, they start before breakfast. Before coffee!"|"The Omnivore's Dilemma"|"Michael Pollan"
07:00|"seven a.m."|"When I got there, Joel was bolting the Eggmobile to the hitch of his tractor. It wasn’t quite seven a.m. yet, but he seemed delighted to have someone to talk to. Talking about farming is one of his greatest pleasures."|"The Omnivore's Dilemma"|"Michael Pollan"
05:30|"5:30 a.m."|"So that morning I managed to get up right on time—5:30 a.m., to be exact. I made my way to the broilers’ pasture. We had to catch and crate three hundred chickens. While we waited for Daniel to show up with the chicken crates, I helped Peter move the pens to a new spot of grass."|"The Omnivore's Dilemma"|"Michael Pollan"
"> 12:00"|"after noon"|"We cleaned up, scrubbing the blood off the tables and hosing down the floor. Meanwhile customers began arriving to pick up their chickens. This was another reason Joel has a slaughterhouse with no walls. Polyface’s customers know to come after noon on a chicken day, but there’s nothing to prevent them from showing up earlier and watching their dinner being killed. They don’t need USDA rules to ensure that the meat they’re buying has been humanely and cleanly processed. They can see for themselves."|"The Omnivore's Dilemma"|"Michael Pollan"
05:45|"5:45 a.m."|"And then there is Joel’s brother, Art, who makes deliveries to area restaurants once a week. On Thursday I woke to the sound of Art’s panel truck noisily backing up to the salesroom door. The clock said 5:45 a.m. I threw on some clothes and dashed out to meet him."|"The Omnivore's Dilemma"|"Michael Pollan"
"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"We divided into pairs, me with Angelo. Our plan was to meet back at the cars for lunch around noon. Jean-Pierre and  Richard walked off into the lower forest. Angelo and I rode up to the top of a grassy ridge on his four-wheel-drive ATV. The bike made a racket, but Angelo claimed it didn’t bother the pigs and would allow us to cover a lot more ground than we could on foot."|"The Omnivore's Dilemma"|"Michael Pollan"
"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"We saw no pigs that morning, and around noon, we met back at the cars as planned. Jean-Pierre had shot a small boar and Angelo hung it from a nearby branch. Then we turned to eating. Being Europeans, Angelo and Jean-Pierre take lunch very seriously, even when out in the woods. “So I brought with me a few little things to nibble on,” Jean-Pierre mumbled. “Me too,” chimed Angelo. And out of their packs came course after course of the most astonishing picnic. They laid the feast on the hood of Angelo’s SUV. There was:GELLED LOBSTER AND HALIBUT 
HOMEMADE SALAMI, PROSCIUTTO, AND MORTADELLA 
HOMEMADE PȂTÉ OF BOAR 
HOME-CURED OLIVES 
CHICKEN SALAD 
A GENEROUS SELECTION OF CHEESES AND BREADS 
FRESH STRAWBERRIES 
PASTRIES"|"The Omnivore's Dilemma"|"Michael Pollan"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"Well, I had gone hunting. Plus, Jean-Pierre offered me some cuts from his pig, so I had some meat for my meal. But I hadn’t done what I’d set out to do—kill my own food. So I asked Angelo if I could go out with him again. He called me about  a month later, said to meet him on a Monday morning, six o’clock sharp. We would be going back to Richard’s property again and this time it would be just the two of us."|"The Omnivore's Dilemma"|"Michael Pollan"
"> 09:00"|"A little after nine in the morning"|"A little after nine in the morning we were walking together down a logging road cut into a steep hillside. Then we heard it. We were stopped in our tracks by a grunt so loud and deep that it seemed to be coming from the bowels of the earth. A very big pig was very close by. But where? What direction to look? We crouched down low, and I listened as hard as I’ve ever listened for anything before."|"The Omnivore's Dilemma"|"Michael Pollan"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"Anthony e-mailed that I should meet him in front of his house Friday morning at six o’clock sharp. He warned me to come prepared for any weather. “We’ll go rain, snow, or shine.” He wasn’t kidding. The weather up where we were going was extreme. It could snow in May or be very hot or both in the same day."|"The Omnivore's Dilemma"|"Michael Pollan"
04:30|"4:30 a.m."|"Suddenly, morel hunting didn’t sound like much fun. In fact it  like survival training than a walk in the woods. I crossed my fingers that Anthony was just trying to scare me, and set my alarm for 4:30 a.m. I wondered why it is all these hunting-gathering expeditions had to begin at such ungodly hours in the morning. I understood why you had to hunt pigs early in the day when they were active. But it’s not as though these morels were going to disappear after lunch. Perhaps the idea is to use as much daylight as possible. Or maybe we wanted the early start to beat other mushroomers to the best spots."|"The Omnivore's Dilemma"|"Michael Pollan"
