12:00|noon|"Zennor church door creaks and opens. Outside, the unusual May heat simmers. It is noon and quiet. Dogs lie in the dust. Butterflies skim gravestones and the pointing finger of shadow on the sundial to the left of the church porch is sharply distinct. The Glory of the World Passeth, it says. Lawrence stops to look up at it, notes the name of the sundial-maker. Paul Quick."|"Zennor in Darkness"|"Helen Dunmore"
"ap 05:45"|"quarter to six"|"Clare snaps fully awake at quarter to six in her dark room. She’s had to change her white lace curtains for chenille because of the war. No one must show a light to U-boats lying out in the Channel, sinking ship after ship after ship, creeping in at night to refuel at secret dumps along the miles of toothed coastline, fed by the Unseen Hand of German collaborators, a cancer working in the body militant, a nest to be smoked out by every observant man, woman and child. Or so they say. Clare hates the blotting out of her landscape of clouds and sea. The chenille is stuffy and faded, and, even though she aired the curtains in the sun for a full day before hanging them, a smell of must seeps out of them and taints the room."|"Zennor in Darkness"|"Helen Dunmore"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"Clare will go out. She can’t wait to be out of the house, away from this frowst of curtains and stale air. Down there to her right all the cottages hump, still sleeping. No, not quite all. The first smoke goes up from a stubby chimney wedged into a slate roof. Father’s still asleep, in his dark red bedroom at the back of the house, closed in against the rising sun. He has had black shades fitted to his windows, because his eyes are sensitive to light. He won’t get up for hours yet, and when he does he’ll meander down to the kitchen in his Paisley silk dressing-gown (because it isn’t one of Hat’s days) and make tea for himself, whistling between his teeth, book in one hand. He doesn’t sleep well, and Daylight Saving makes it even worse for him. She never sees him before eight, and it will be later today. She didn’t hear him come in last night, even though she lay there, half dozing, half waiting, on edge. But before the door snicked she fell asleep, into heavy confused dreams which still hang about her now."|"Zennor in Darkness"|"Helen Dunmore"
"~ 00:00"|"around midnight"|"‘They set off back around midnight. To be skinned alive by Aunt Annie, I daresay. I went walking.’"|"Zennor in Darkness"|"Helen Dunmore"
"ap 07:00"|"Seven o’clock"|"‘Goodbye, then,’ she says.
‘I’ll call for you, Clarey. Seven o’clock.’
She nods, and turns to go. He hunches forward, clasping his knees. She’s going, so he’ll hold on to himself, smelling his own khaki, watching his boots glitter. The others are up already, working. Essential workers they are, Jo and Albert and George, and they are there to be seen working essentially by anyone prowling or nosing up at the farm. Coast-watchers, military police, tribunal members, let em all come. The boys will be blinding their way across the yard to swill down the pig-sheds now, hung-over and breakfastless."|"Zennor in Darkness"|"Helen Dunmore"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"But Clare knows that they can, and that nothing is impossible any more. There is no language to describe the world she lives in now, where lists of thousands of dead are published in the newspapers each morning as routinely as the small advertisements. She reads the newspaper. Not in The Times, but in Grandad’s Daily Mail there are stories of heroic mothers who give up eight sons, or ten sons, to conscription. Stories of families who have eighteen adult males fighting at the front – sons, cousins, husbands. And all we have is John William. Of course they’ll take Kitchie. Her heart tightens as she looks at him in his best white shirt and a waistcoat she recognizes as an old one of John William’s. He’s brushed his hair down flat for the concert, and his Sunday boots are carefully cleaned and polished. He’s ready and she’s not. Quick, she must get changed – John William will be here at seven."|"Zennor in Darkness"|"Helen Dunmore"
12:00|noon|"‘In a minute,’ says John William. The crowd bulges around the entrance, under the bunting, the home-made red, white and blue decorations and the skewed portrait of the King. There are farmers, shop-people, fishermen and swarms of kids without tickets getting their caps knocked off as they dive under people’s elbows to see through the door. Not many in khaki. They’d all make way for John William. The Belgian singer has arrived. She’s in the back, resting her voice. She’s been sucking glycerine lozenges since noon, they say, because this is the last leg of a tour which has taken her from Exeter all down Cornwall. Travelling through all that dust, no wonder she’s hoarse. But she’s good. Oh, yes, there’s no doubt about that. Your Uncle Arthur spoke to someone at Penzance market who heard her up at Plymouth and he did say…"|"Zennor in Darkness"|"Helen Dunmore"

"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"Here they are. There is always wind here, enough to flap her white skirts and strew her hair over her face. He is fully dressed and they have cut his hair so close that the wind can do nothing but comb through it. They stand side by side on the rock, facing out to sea. They are hidden from land here. Even spies would see nothing of them. Clare’s heard how people used to spy on lovers on the Island, in their private places where they thought they were alone. Some of the watchers even took a telescope and claimed they were watching the boats go out. Then there would be scandal, hot and delicious, licking up narrow streets until it reached the watched girl’s home in a thunderous explosion. The wind blows John William and Clare. It feels strong and warm, even though she knows it cannot be warm, for this is only May and long past midnight."|"Zennor in Darkness"|"Helen Dunmore"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"She says nothing more. If it’s today, then it’s already the morning when John William leaves on the eleven o’clock train."|"Zennor in Darkness"|"Helen Dunmore"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"Now Clare sits naked on the rock for John William. They’re quiet for a long while and they don’t touch. It’s getting darker, and the moon is going down. There’s not much time – soon dawn will start to streak in the sky behind them, and there’ll be people about, and voices, and the milk-cart moving, and the boats ready to go out, and the coal that’s lying heaped in the sidings will be stoked into the train John William will catch. But she’ll keep her back to all of it – she’ll only look at the sea. Or she’ll shut her eyes and when she opens them it’ll be blazing July and they’ll be six years old again, sent out for the day by Nan with their pasties and a bottle of cold tea and a handful of cherries. ‘And don’t come in till you hear five o’clock on the church bell, for I’ve all my washing to do. And you, Hannah, you’re the eldest, you watch out for our Clarey. Mind she don’t run too much and start up her coughing.’ For Hannah is seven, and responsible for them."|"Zennor in Darkness"|"Helen Dunmore"
"ap 10:50"|"ten to eleven"|"John William was right about the rain. By ten to eleven on Grandad’s watch big drops of rain are falling, pocking the sand of Porthminster Beach below the railway station. The wind has whipped up coldly, and everyone’s clothes are quickly spattered. They stand in a tight family bunch, smelling of damp cloth and hair. Nan is in her best black, standing with Aunt Annie and Aunt Mag. Aunt Mabel isn’t here yet – perhaps she’s not coming. The women surround Aunt Sarah, who is struggling to keep back tears the way she managed to do last autumn, when John William went out first time. She held them back until the train was past the platform then. Heroic, uncharacteristic effort; but it’s plain she won’t equal it today. Uncle Arthur stands aside, talking to Uncle John. They’ve heard this morning that Harry has been called up for re-examination. Clare watches Uncle Arthur fumble the letter out of his pocket and show it to his brother."|"Zennor in Darkness"|"Helen Dunmore"
00:00|midnight|"He sees dripping sun; tall glasses of hock and seltzer. Montfort has just finished reading his new poem. They sprawl in a circle and he stands, his back to the chimney-piece. One of his arms lies easily along the stone shelf, but his left hand grips the paper tight, with the words on it which he’s worked at from tipsy midnight through to morning. He stares round at his friends. For all his nervousness he can’t help knowing, knowing, that they must find it good, as he does. Stacey, Coyne, Chatterne. What will they say?"|"Zennor in Darkness"|"Helen Dunmore"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"‘Yes,’ she says. ‘He went on the eleven o’clock train on Sunday morning.’"|"Zennor in Darkness"|"Helen Dunmore"
"ap > 06:00"|"past six o’clock"|"Clare snaps a band round her sketchbook, and stands up. She does not know what to say to Frieda. It was so lovely earlier on, and now the war is here too. It seeps everywhere, like dark-brown London fog. It’s time to go – besides, it’s getting late. Well past six o’clock, and although Clare has left a cold supper ready, her father will worry if she is not back by nine. Now she looks forward to the walk home, in the long, light, sweet May evening."|"Zennor in Darkness"|"Helen Dunmore"
"ap 07:30"|"half past seven"|"‘Clare, I’m taking the half past seven train. I am going to make arrangements at the officers’ training camp. I have been thinking about it, and I must go.

"ap 23:45"|"quarter to twelve"|"The house makes settling night noises around the two girls, one sleeping, one wide awake. Hannah has the best half of Clare’s bed and her warmth fills it. She lies round and peaceful and still, drinking up sleep, snuffling against the pillow, her dark night-plait coiled against her spine. But Clare lies on the cold edge of the bed, so that her body will not touch Hannah’s. She does not want to touch anybody. She lies on her back, her arms behind her head like a declaration of wakefulness, and she stares into the dark. It is not so very late: it is somewhere between quarter to twelve and midnight. Soon the clock in the hall will strike, because her father is not here to muffle it for the night. It will go on striking each quarter until morning. But Clare prefers not to tamper with it. That clock is one of the few things in the house which her father takes care of, and Clare was told too often as a child that its delicate coilings could be wrecked for ever by one interfering finger."|"Zennor in Darkness"|"Helen Dunmore"

12:00|noon|"The glass in the train window rattles. Cold for June, they’ll say, just as they said before that it was hot for May. There is strangeness in the weather these days. It is as if the days have misplaced themselves. Sometimes the wind tastes as if it has blown here across a desert. Heat swells until it seems as if the spirits-of-wine will burst through the top of the thermometer. The sky is brassy and frighteningly indifferent. Why shouldn’t it roast us if it wants? We believe it will not do so, because it has never done so before. This is our world, and it will not turn on us and rend us. But it’s the same sun that glitters over the trenches on perfect June mornings before the obliteration of thousands in a couple of hours. Men who shave themselves in the morning, and put tissue-paper over a shaving cut are blown to rags by noon. Phoebus Apollo, flame-crowned. What are those lines?"|"Zennor in Darkness"|"Helen Dunmore"

I want to tell you to come on in, girl, and get your things off and sit down with your Nan, but I don’t say anything. For fear of scaring you. You don’t want to be with us, do you, my lovey? You don’t want us to share your grieving. You don’t want your Nan."|"Zennor in Darkness"|"Helen Dunmore"
"ap 04:45"|"quarter to five"|"It’s not easy to say why suspicion and fear and curiosity and excitement and disbelief should suddenly vanish, leaving nothing but hard certainty. But it’s very easy to say when it happened. It was at quarter to five last Friday evening, between peeling the potatoes and dropping them into a panful of cold salted water. Before, when she fetched the potatoes out of the cellar, she was not pregnant. Her visitor was late: but then it had been late before. Eight days; well, perhaps not quite as late before. Fourteen days. It is the shock of John William. I’m quite well and not any fatter. Peer in the mirror: my face is thinner, if anything. Look at my eyes. Seventeen days. A hot, insistent beat of panic behind everything, all day long. Twenty-one days. A surge of confidence. I am stupid to worry. It’s perfectly all right. It is simply that I’m going to miss out one month, and then everything will go on as usual."|"Zennor in Darkness"|"Helen Dunmore"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"A cool, still October morning in Zennor. It is early, not quite yet eight o’clock. Four men turn off the high road which leads from St Ives to Zennor, and tramp down the farm lane towards Higher Tregerthen. Pods of Himalayan balsam burst with sudden explosions as the men brush past them. They know their way; they have been here before. They know every inch of the Lawrences’ bare little cottage with its bits of fabric draped over furniture and its pink-washed walls. They have flipped over Frieda’s embroideries and left them lying skew-whiffed. They would not be caught dead living in a place like this themselves. They are contemptuous of the Lawrences’ meagre possessions. And yet this Lawrence is an educated man – surely it only confirms the suspicion that he must have some hidden motive for living in such an out-of-the-way place, high above the coast where a light can be seen for miles out to sea? They have rifled the cottage once, and it will open its doors to them easily this time. The man is as frail as a dandelion puff, so there is no fear of a fight there. And if need be they can put the fear of God into the German woman. A few words about the risk of internment should silence her."|"Zennor in Darkness"|"Helen Dunmore"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"By eleven o’clock the second search is over and the men have gone. They have left behind the smear of the oldest message in the world: ‘We can do what we like to you, and you cannot stop us, for we have the power and you are powerless.’ She has writhed and wept under the weight of it, and her own helplessness, but now she is silent. In the solicitor’s office she learned the cost of leaving her husband for Lawrence. Now she learns that the cost of living with him still has to be paid, over and over. She will pay it."|"Zennor in Darkness"|"Helen Dunmore"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"It’s a rare hot Saturday in May, and the girls are out in it, free for the afternoon. Hannah is free until she has to go back to sprinkle the shop-boards with water and sweep the dust. Peggy is not required until six o’clock, because little Georgie’s parents are taking charge of him themselves for once, and he is going to visit his grandmother. Not required like a piece of luggage which is indispensable but can go in the guard’s van for the time being, thinks Clare. And Clare has done her week’s baking, and made her father turn out of his study while she cleaned it. Her bread came out of the oven hard and grey, but even Francis Coyne is unlikely to be fastidious about it. No one can do better now, not with this flour. It is all they can get, and Clare knows they are lucky to have it. In the cities women queue for hours, and besiege the bakers’ shops as soon as they open. But she won’t think of that now. It is Saturday afternoon, and she is lying in the sun, which fixes on her dark dress like a burning-glass, soaking away the tiredness in her thigh muscles. Out of the wind, it is almost too hot. She hoists herself up on her elbows, and the wind tugs at her again. The coast and country stream with light. Sea and grass pucker like cat’s fur under the warm May wind."|"Zennor in Darkness"|"Helen Dunmore"

It is taking advantage of the calm weather to come close under the cliffs, searching for evidence. Is there a patch of oil, or a place where someone might set a signal-light? The boat rocks while its crew look and listen. Their eyes rake the rocks. Nothing. But there must be something. It is four o’clock. The men out in the fields straighten as they see the girl reach the gate with a cloth-covered basket and a jug of cold tea. She will hand it over the gate to them, because she does not want the dung on her skirts.

Westerly light drips through stained glass on to her hair, through the languid figure of a craggy-jawed Pre-Raphaelite beauty. Her long green robes make green blobs on the black and white tiled floor. Clare runs a finger round the outline of a big, bare foot which peeks out of the draperies.

We’re not supposed to pray for the war to end. We’re meant to pray for victory. The boys go out to France just as they used to go off on the drift-boats, or down the tin-mines, or to work on the farms. They all go: Medlands and Pascoes, Vivians and Trethakes, Popes and Mawgans. A whole landscape of family faces crushed into thin black lines, so dense you could not read them but that your fear and curiosity made you read them. You looked out for local names. What was cholera compared to the emptiness of the sea, the quiet streets, and the clumsy-booted young men, first time away from home, entraining and vanishing through the foggy curtain of war. We don’t know what’s happening behind that curtain. There’s a silence which all the yammering headlines can’t break."|"Zennor in Darkness"|"Helen Dunmore"
