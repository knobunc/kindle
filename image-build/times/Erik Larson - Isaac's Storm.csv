The stories Louisa told her hosts of what she had seen on her journey frightened them. With Louisa's help, they began bracing the windows and doors. They nailed an ironing board across a window. A neighbor came over with her two children seeking shelter or company and brought the total number of people in the house to ten. They closed all the upstairs doors and gathered on the stairway. They had a pitcher of water and a lantern. Soon they heard the shattering of windows and blinds in the bedrooms behind the doors they had just closed.

One local historian believed he was in the hospital recovering from his injuries, but this seems unlikely. Isaac was not seriously injured, at least not physically. He continued to file telegrams to Washington. Most likely he spent this time struggling with the hunt for his wife, the care of his children, and his own grief. There was much for him to do. He needed to find a permanent home for his children and a woman to care for them. He put Joseph in charge of the office, although it must have pained him to do so. Joseph reveled in his new command, and in his brother's absence. Telegrams from the bureau became more dramatic. At 11:30 A.M., Tuesday, September 11, Joseph fired off a breathless telegram to Moore, in which he reported that Bornkessell was still missing, Isaac had been injured but ""not seriously,"" and ""nearly half the city"" had been washed away.

The last storm advisory received from Washington, he said, was an order that arrived at 10:30 A.M. Saturday specifying only a change in wind direction of an existing storm warning.

When Joseph describes his own journey to Isaac's house on the Saturday of the storm, he never identifies its owner. It is only ""a house"" in which fifty people happened to have congregated. ""At eight o'clock,"" Joseph writes, ""the house we were in went to pieces, and as the house went over I broke through the window and climbed on the side of the framed house, and carried two children to safety. . . .
