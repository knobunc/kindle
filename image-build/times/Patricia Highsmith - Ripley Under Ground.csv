Tom wished he could count on a girl, Cynthia for instance, to supervise it, but Cynthia and Bernard had broken up two or three years ago.

He held the cup of cold sweet tea between his hands and stared unseeing at a photograph of Heloise—long blonde hair on either side of a slender face, a pleasant and meaningless design to Tom just now rather than a face—and he thought of Bernard working in secret on his Derwatt forgeries in a closed, even locked room in his studio apartment. Bernard’s place was pretty crummy, as it always had been. Tom had never seen the sanctum sanctorum where he painted his masterpieces, the Derwatts that brought in thousands of quid. If one painted more forgeries than one’s own paintings, wouldn’t the forgeries become more natural, more real, more genuine to oneself, even, than one’s own painting? Wouldn’t the effort finally go out of it and the work become second nature?"|"Ripley Under Ground"|"Patricia Highsmith"

Tom painted landscapes and portraits mainly. He was ever trying to simplify, to keep the example of Matisse before him, but with little success, he thought.

Impossible to believe Bernard had registered at the Grande Bretagne, Tom thought, the most expensive hotel in Athens.

Tom doubted that any inhabitant of Icaria would react to the name Derwatt, but Tom tried it with the café proprietor, without success. Derwatt had been here scarcely a month, Tom thought, and that six long years ago.

Bernard’s hair lifted and fell over his forehead with the wind. He was going to kill himself, Tom realized. Maybe not this instant. Maybe he would walk around and come back in an hour, in two hours. Maybe this evening. Two women, walking past Bernard, glanced at him with a brief curiosity. When the women had gone by, Tom walked toward Bernard, neither fast nor slowly. Below, the river foamed quickly over the rocks that bordered its banks. Tom had never seen a boat on the river, that he could recall. The Salzach was perhaps rather shallow.

14:17|"2:17 p.m."|"A car went by on the road, a truck, judging from the grinding sound of its motor. It was out of sight to Tom because of the trees. Its sound faded, and Tom hoped it had not stopped to investigate. But for three or four minutes nothing happened, and Tom assumed the driver had gone on. Without looking at the remains of Bernard, Tom poked branches nearer the flames. He was using a long stick. He felt he was doing things clumsily, that the fire was not hot enough—nowhere near the intense heat needed to cremate a body properly. The only thing he could do, therefore, was make the fire burn as long as possible. It was now 2:17 p.m. Quite a heat came from the fire, because of the overhang, and Tom had to toss branches finally. He did this steadily for several minutes. When the flames died down a little, he could approach the fire, pick up the half-burnt branches, and throw them back again. There was still half the can of gasoline left."|"Ripley Under Ground"|"Patricia Highsmith"
20:00|"8 p.m."|"Orly by 8 p.m. Tom presented his own passport. A glance at him and his photograph, and no stamping was done. He took a taxi to Villeperce. He had been afraid Heloise would have visitors, and he was right, he saw from the slumping dark red Citroën in front of the house. The Grais’ car."|"Ripley Under Ground"|"Patricia Highsmith"
00:00|midnight|"“That’s quite ordinary,” Tom said in French, as the telephone rang. He waved her away from the suitcase. Tom was told that Jeff’s telephone did not answer, and Tom asked the operator to keep trying. It was nearing midnight."|"Ripley Under Ground"|"Patricia Highsmith"
"ap 06:45"|"quarter to seven"|"He went downstairs. A quarter to seven by the clock near the telephone. The fire looked like white ashes, but was no doubt still warm. Tom took a twig and scraped for the silver ring, prepared at the same time to conceal the green passport in his hand—he had bent the passport in half—in case Mme. Annette came in. Tom found the ring, blackened and somewhat out of shape, but not the collapsed thing he had expected. He put the ring on the hearth to cool, stirred up the embers, and tore apart the passport. He used a match to hasten the burning of the passport, and watched until it was done. Then he went upstairs with the ring, and put it with the indescribable black and red stuff in the pigskin suitcase from Salzburg."|"Ripley Under Ground"|"Patricia Highsmith"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"“I’d like to see you, Mr. Ripley, and the reason I ring so early is because I find I can take a nine o’clock plane. Can I come to see you this morning ’round eleven?”"|"Ripley Under Ground"|"Patricia Highsmith"
"~ 08:30"|"around 8:30 a.m."|"Mme. Annette arrived around 8:30 a.m., and Tom signaled that he would take his coffee but Heloise would prefer to sleep longer. Tom sipped his coffee and thought what he must do, how he must behave. Honest above all, Tom thought, and he went over the story in his mind. Derwatt ringing because he was distressed about Murchison’s disappearance (over-distressed, oddly, just the sort of illogical thing that would ring true, an unexpected reaction that would sound real), and could he come to see Tom? And Heloise telling him that Tom had gone to Salzburg to look for Bernard Tufts. Yes, best if Heloise mentioned Bernard to Webster. To Derwatt, Bernard Tufts was an old friend whose name he would have responded to at once. In Salzburg, he and Derwatt had been more concerned over Bernard than Murchison."|"Ripley Under Ground"|"Patricia Highsmith"
"~ 09:30"|"about 9:30 a.m."|"When Heloise stirred, Tom got out of bed and went downstairs to ask Mme. Annette to make fresh tea. It was about 9:30 a.m."|"Ripley Under Ground"|"Patricia Highsmith"
"ap ~ 10:00"|"Around ten"|"Tom went out to look at the former grave of Murchison. Some rain had fallen since he had last seen it. He left the few branches over it as they were, because they looked natural, not as if someone had tried to conceal the spot, and Tom had no reason anyway to conceal the policemen’s digging.
Around ten, Mme. Annette went out to do the shopping.
Tom told Heloise that Inspector Webster was due and that he, Tom, would like her to be present. “You can say quite frankly I went to Salzburg to try to find Bernard.”"|"Ripley Under Ground"|"Patricia Highsmith"
"ap 10:45"|"quarter to eleven"|"Webster arrived at a quarter to eleven. He came in with his black attaché case, looking as efficient as a doctor."|"Ripley Under Ground"|"Patricia Highsmith"
"~ 10:00"|"around ten in the morning"|"Tom glanced at Heloise. “Well, on Tuesday, we all had an appointment to meet around ten in the morning. Derwatt had taken sedatives, he said. He’d talked before of killing himself and said he wanted to be cremated—by us, Bernard and me. I at least hadn’t taken it too seriously until he turned up groggy Tuesday and sort of—making jokes. He took more pills as we walked. We were in the woods, where Derwatt wanted to go.” Tom said to Heloise, “If you don’t want to listen, dear, you should go upstairs. I have to tell it as it happened.”"|"Ripley Under Ground"|"Patricia Highsmith"
12:00|noon|"Webster said, writing, “The next day. November the sixth, Wednesday.” Where had Bernard been staying? Tom was able to say Der Blaue something in the Linzergasse. But after Wednesday, Tom was not sure. Where and when had they bought the petrol? Tom was vague about the place, but it was Wednesday noon. Where had Derwatt been staying? Tom said he had never tried to find out."|"Ripley Under Ground"|"Patricia Highsmith"
"ap ~ 09:30"|"around nine-thirty"|"“Bernard and I had promised to meet around nine-thirty Thursday morning in the Alter Markt. Wednesday night, Bernard gave me his duffelbag and asked me to keep it while he found another hotel that night. I asked him to stay at my hotel, but he didn’t want to. Then—he didn’t keep our date Thursday. I waited an hour or so. I never saw him again. He had left no message at my hotel. I felt Bernard didn’t want to keep that date, that he’d destroyed himself probably—probably by drowning himself in the river. I came home.”"|"Ripley Under Ground"|"Patricia Highsmith"
"< 22:00"|"just before 10 p.m."|"So he gardened. And in the evening they lay in pajamas on Heloise’s bed and watched television and sipped tea. The telephone rang just before 10 p.m. and Tom answered it in his room. He had been braced for Webster, and had a pen in hand ready to take down the schedule for tomorrow, but it was Chris Greenleaf in Paris. He had returned from the Rheinland and wondered if he could visit with his friend Gerald."|"Ripley Under Ground"|"Patricia Highsmith"
