12:00|noontime|"The most brilliant young economist in America—the one so deemed, at least, by a jury of his elders—brakes to a stop at a traffic light on Chicago’s south side. It is a sunny day in mid-June. He drives an aging green Chevy Cavalier with a dusty dashboard and a window that doesn’t quite shut, producing a dull roar at highway speeds. But the car is quiet for now, as are the noontime streets: gas stations, boundless concrete, brick buildings with plywood windows."|Freakonomics|"Steven D. Levitt"
16:00|16|"In practice, we see, if anything, slightly fewer long losing streaks than expected based on these calculations. The last really long losing streak was that of the Cubs in 1996–1997, which was 16 games. (There is actually a good reason that long streaks occur a little less than in the simple model I was using. It is because a team that wins 35 percent of their games doesn’t have the same likelihood of winning every game: sometimes it has a 50 percent chance and sometimes a 20 percent chance; that sort of variability lessens the likelihood of long streaks.)"|Freakonomics|"Steven D.

"~ 21:00"|"about 9 p.m."|"So Levitt and I were in Las Vegas this weekend, doing some research. (Seriously.) We had a little downtime and decided to play blackjack. It was New Year’s Eve, at Caesars Palace, about 9 p.m. We sat down at an empty table where the dealer, a nice young woman from Michigan, was very patient in teaching us the various fine points that neither of us knew and which indicated that we were both inexperienced. Keep one hand in your lap, e.g. When you want a card, just flick your cards twice on the felt. When you’re standing, tuck one card under your chip/s. And so on."|Freakonomics|"Steven D. Levitt"
16:00|"4 p.m."|"Imagine for a moment that you are the manager of a day-care center. You have a clearly stated policy that children are supposed to be picked up by 4 p.m. But very often parents are late. The result: at day’s end, you have some anxious children and at least one teacher who must wait around for the parents to arrive. What to do?"|Freakonomics|"Steven D. Levitt"
00:00|midnight|"Some cheating leaves barely a shadow of evidence. In other cases, the evidence is massive. Consider what happened one spring evening at midnight in 1987: seven million American children suddenly disappeared. The worst kidnapping wave in history? Hardly. It was the night of April 15, and the Internal Revenue Service had just changed a rule. Instead of merely listing the name of each dependent child, tax filers were now required to provide a Social Security number. Suddenly, seven million children—children who had existed only as phantom exemptions on the previous year’s 1040 forms—vanished, representing about one in ten of all dependent children in the United States."|Freakonomics|"Steven D.

"ap 03:57"|"three of four"|"There is another oddity about the suspicious answer string. On nine of the fifteen tests, the six correct answers are preceded by another identical string, 3-a-1-2, which includes three of four incorrect answers. And on all fifteen tests, the six correct answers are followed by the same incorrect answer, a 4. Why on earth would a cheating teacher go to the trouble of erasing a student’s test sheet and then fill in the wrong answer?"|Freakonomics|"Steven D. Levitt"
00:00|midnight|"As institutions go, the Ku Klux Klan has had a markedly up-and-down history. It was founded in the immediate aftermath of the Civil War by six former Confederate soldiers in Pulaski, Tennessee. The six young men, four of whom were budding lawyers, saw themselves as merely a circle of like-minded friends. Thus the name they chose, “kuklux,” a slight mangling of kuklos, the Greek word for “circle.” In the beginning, their activities were said to be harmless midnight pranks—for instance, riding horses through the countryside while draped in white sheets and pillowcase hoods. But soon the Klan evolved into a multistate terrorist organization designed to frighten and kill emancipated slaves. Among its regional leaders were five former Confederate generals; its staunchest supporters were the plantation owners for whom Reconstruction posed an economic and political nightmare. In 1872, President Ulysses S. Grant spelled out for the House of Representatives the true aims of the Ku Klux Klan: “By force and terror, to prevent all political action not in accord with the views of the members, to deprive colored citizens of the right to bear arms and of the right of a free ballot, to suppress the schools in which colored children were taught, and to reduce the colored people to a condition closely allied to that of slavery.”"|Freakonomics|"Steven D.

When he had to pee, he went where they went—on the stairwell landing one floor up. J. T. stopped by a few times during the night but didn’t have much to say. Daybreak came and then noon. Venkatesh would occasionally try to discuss his survey, but the young crack dealers just laughed and told him how stupid his questions were. Finally, nearly twenty-four hours after Venkatesh stumbled upon them, they set him free."|Freakonomics|"Steven D. Levitt"
