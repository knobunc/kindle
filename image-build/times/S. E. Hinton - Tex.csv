"ap 06:00"|six|"I woke up at six, just like always, pulled on my boots and jacket, and stumbled out the back door to the garage, where we keep the feed. I noticed we were low on grain, and thought about reminding Mason to get some. Then I went up the well-beaten path to the corral. It wasn’t till I got there, wondering why nobody was nickering, that I remembered."|Tex|"S. E. Hinton"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"Me and Johnny kept our word and didn’t pester Bob a bit on the way to the Fair, in case he decided to turn around and take us back. (We had several things planned for the way home, when he couldn’t do much about it.) We did clown around a little bit, but I doubt that he heard us—his girl friend talked a mile a minute. Bob dropped us off in front of the north entrance to the Fair grounds and told us to meet him there at ten o’clock, then he drove on to the movies or wherever he was going."|Tex|"S. E. Hinton"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"I was real sorry when ten o’clock came and we had to split up—Jamie and Marcie going to the south entrance to meet Marcie’s mother, Johnny and me heading for the north to meet Bob. I could be wrong, but I think they were sorry we had to split up, too."|Tex|"S. E. Hinton"
05:00|"five in the morning"|"I shook my head. The only thing Mason minded me doing was skipping school. I could come in at five in the morning, just as long as I was up at six to get ready for school."|Tex|"S. E. Hinton"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"“Okay, okay. But you’ll have to get up early, I got a nine o’clock appointment.”"|Tex|"S. E. Hinton"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"It looked like everybody in the county decided they had to be in the city by nine o’clock. Pretty soon Mason was gripping the steering wheel so hard his knuckles turned white. Then he was either muttering to himself or hollering out the window. Being a jock he knew some good things to holler."|Tex|"S. E. Hinton"
"ap ~ 09:59"|"about one minute before ten"|"He sat down with me about one minute before ten. “I hope they didn’t get too much of the crummy truck in the film.” Suddenly he paused. “You think they’re going to show that interview you did with that lady reporter? If they do, man, I’m going to kill you…”"|Tex|"S. E. Hinton"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"I felt real funny. I’d had a long day and it was after midnight and I could tell I was tired, but I was so wound up I could actually feel the nerves humming along in my body like charged electric wires. Mason, who would usually kill for his eight hours of sleep, sat around and drummed his fingers, or got up and paced around, like a chained dog."|Tex|"S. E. Hinton"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"He answered the phone and even across the room I recognized the voice that said, “What have you been doing? It’s two in the morning.”"|Tex|"S. E. Hinton"
06:00|"six in the morning"|"“Even if he left at six in the morning, which isn’t likely, he couldn’t be here this quick,” Mason told me. He was making a big show out of being unconcerned. He was driving me nuts."|Tex|"S. E. Hinton"
06:00|"six this morning"|"“Mason,” I said, “I thought you said it wasn’t likely that he left at six this morning…”"|Tex|"S. E. Hinton"
12:00|noon|"“He used to be my horse,” I said. I reached out and stroked his neck. Man, he was clean. He must have been brushed morning noon and night to be that clean. It’s a mess trying to get dust out of a winter coat."|Tex|"S. E. Hinton"
"ap 10:30"|10:30|"“All day?” I looked at the dock. It was 10:30. “What about the rest of the tests I’m having today?”"|Tex|"S. E. Hinton"
"ap ~ 04:00"|"about four"|"“Now just take your seat again. Your father ought to be here about four.”"|Tex|"S. E. Hinton"
"ap ~ 04:00"|"About four"|"About four. It was noon. I’d heard the phrase killing time, but now I knew what it meant. I felt like I had murdered a whole day. I could never hack an office job. You know how it feels when your foot goes to sleep? Well, by four I felt like my whole body had gone to sleep, including my brain."|Tex|"S. E. Hinton"

"ap 04:00"|four|"Mason came stalking in, right at four. He didn’t say much, but it was pretty clear that he’d used up his quota of self-control for the day."|Tex|"S. E. Hinton"
