'Well, half sozzled, then. And it's only ten o'clock.'
'If a man isn't half sozzled by ten o'clock, he isn't trying. Don't you worry about me, Reggie, old man. You don't understand the wonders of the Californian climate yet. So superbly bracing is it that day by day in every way you can put away all you want to, and not a squawk from « the old liver. That's what they mean when they speak of California as an earthly Paradise, and that's why train-loads of people are pouring in all the time from the Middle West with their tongues hanging out. I expect that's why you came here, isn't it?'"|"Laughing Gas"|"P. G. Wodehouse"

For the first time, it had struck me like a blow from a stuffed eel-skin that if this bally Screen Beautiful was housed within anything like a reasonable distance, Chaffinch should long since have returned from his mission.
