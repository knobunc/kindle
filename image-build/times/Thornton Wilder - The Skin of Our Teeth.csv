Chateau Frontenac"|"The Skin of Our Teeth"|"Thornton Wilder"
"~ 16:30"|Vespers|"Then I got home and went to church to Vespers at St. Matthew’s, which on All Soul’s Day—November first, as all readers of Finnegans Wake must know well—will celebrate its mere 150th anniversary, which must arouse a scornful laugh from the Roman Catholic churches, all fifty of them, nearby. Half the congregation was in uniform, and we prayed for the Royal Family, and sang “God Save the King,” and the Rector cast some of those condescending bathetic references to our dear boys in the service which would make a conscientious objector out of a Theodore Roosevelt."|"The Skin of Our Teeth"|"Thornton Wilder"
"~ 16:30"|Vespers|"Then I stopped for something to eat in town, knowing the worst, for the food in this city is so dreadful that when I eat anywhere except in this hotel I am indubitably poisoned and belch darkly throughout the night. Then I came home to couch on paper the new suggestions for Act Two that had arrived to me during Vespers—your church-going being a lively incentive to your playwriting, though the point-de-départ is left far behind. On my door I found word that a special delivery was waiting for me below. It seemed impossible that you could have already received and replied To my Special, and yet you’re the only correspondent whom I told my address. I thought I had turned in for the night, but just before I went below to claim the letter I looked out of the window at my now cherished view and saw Everything Covered with Snow. Well, the first snow of the year is one of my fêtes, and I had always felt that Quebec, like Litchfield, and Oxford, and, I assume, Prague, mutely waits for snow. So I put on my overshoes—packed, remember? at the last moment, and have taken another walk. . . ."|"The Skin of Our Teeth"|"Thornton Wilder"
"ap 00:00"|"twelve o’clock"|"“In the beginning, God created the Heavens and the earth. . . .” Mr. Tremayne (Ralph Kellard), playing twelve o’clock, passes behind the Antrobuses, who are spending a quiet evening at home at the end of the play . . . and starting over once more."|"The Skin of Our Teeth"|"Thornton Wilder"
06:32|"6:32 a.m."|"The sun rose this morning at 6:32 a.m. This gratifying event was first reported by Mrs. Dorothy Stetson of Freeport, Long Island, who promptly telephoned the Mayor."|"The Skin of Our Teeth"|"Thornton Wilder"
"ap 06:00"|"Six o’clock"|"SABINA:
Oh, oh, oh! Six o’clock and the master not home yet.
Pray God nothing serious has happened to him crossing the Hudson River. If anything happened to him, we would certainly be inconsolable and have to move into a less desirable residence district."|"The Skin of Our Teeth"|"Thornton Wilder"
"ap 06:00"|"Six o’clock"|"Oh, oh, oh! Six o’clock and the master not home yet. Pray God nothing has happened to him crossing the Hudson. Here it is the middle of August and the coldest day of the year. It’s simply freezing; the dogs are sticking. One more tight squeeze like that and where will we be?"|"The Skin of Our Teeth"|"Thornton Wilder"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"I wish eleven o’clock were here; I don’t want to be dragged through this whole play again."|"The Skin of Our Teeth"|"Thornton Wilder"
00:00|midnight|"—By midnight we’d turn to ice. The roads are full of people now who can scarcely lift a foot from the ground. The grass out in front is like iron,—which reminds me, I have another needle for you.—The people up north—where are they?"|"The Skin of Our Teeth"|"Thornton Wilder"
"ap 11:00"|"Eleven o’clock"|"Thank you.—Now for those of you who are listening perhaps I should explain that at the end of this act, the men have come back from the War and the family’s settled down in the house. And the author wants to show the hours of the night passing by over their heads, and the planets crossing the sky . . . uh . . . over their heads. And he says—this is hard to explain—that each of the hours of the night is a philosopher, or a great thinker. Eleven o’clock, for instance, is Aristotle. And nine o’clock is Spinoza. Like that. I don’t suppose it means anything. It’s just a kind of poetic effect."|"The Skin of Our Teeth"|"Thornton Wilder"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"Thank you.—Now for those of you who are listening perhaps I should explain that at the end of this act, the men have come back from the War and the family’s settled down in the house.

"ap 00:00"|"Twelve o’clock"|"Not mean anything! Why, it certainly does. Twelve o’clock goes by saying those wonderful things. I think it means that when people are asleep they have all those lovely thoughts, much better than when they’re awake."|"The Skin of Our Teeth"|"Thornton Wilder"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"Well, well, maybe that’s it. Thank you, Ivy. Anyway,—the hours of the night are philosophers. My friends, are you ready? Ivy, can you be eleven o’clock? “This good estate of the mind possessing its object in energy we call divine.” Aristotle."|"The Skin of Our Teeth"|"Thornton Wilder"
"ap 00:00"|"twelve o’clock"|"Yes, sir. I know that and I know twelve o’clock and I know nine o’clock."|"The Skin of Our Teeth"|"Thornton Wilder"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"Yes, sir. I know that and I know twelve o’clock and I know nine o’clock."|"The Skin of Our Teeth"|"Thornton Wilder"
"ap 00:00"|"Twelve o’clock"|"MR. FITZPATRICK:
Twelve o’clock? Mr. Tremayne, the Bible.
TREMAYNE:"|"The Skin of Our Teeth"|"Thornton Wilder"
"ap 10:00"|"Ten o’clock"|"MR. FITZPATRICK:
Ten o’clock? Hester,—Plato?
She nods eagerly."|"The Skin of Our Teeth"|"Thornton Wilder"
"ap 09:00"|"Nine o’clock"|"She nods eagerly.
Nine o’clock, Spinoza,—Fred?
BAILEY:"|"The Skin of Our Teeth"|"Thornton Wilder"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"Ladies and gentlemen, the planets are singers. Of course, we can’t replace them, so you’ll have to imagine them singing in this scene. Saturn sings from the orchestra pit down here. The Moon is way up there. And Mars with a red lantern in his hand, stands in the aisle over there—Tz-tz-tz. It’s too bad; it all makes a very fine effect. However! Ready—nine o’clock: Spinoza."|"The Skin of Our Teeth"|"Thornton Wilder"
"ap 10:00"|"Ten o’clock"|"FITZPATRICK:
Do you know the rest? All right. Ten o’clock. Hester. Plato.
HESTER:"|"The Skin of Our Teeth"|"Thornton Wilder"
00:00|Midnight|"Midnight. Midnight, Mr. Tremayne. That’s right,—you’ve done it before.—All right, everybody. You know what you have to do.—Lower the curtain. Houselights up. Act Three of THE SKIN OF OUR TEETH."|"The Skin of Our Teeth"|"Thornton Wilder"
12:00|noon|"Why, it sounds like . . . it sounds like what used to be the noon whistle at the shoe-polish factory."|"The Skin of Our Teeth"|"Thornton Wilder"
"ap 09:00"|"Nine o’clock"|"Nine o’clock I used to call Spinoza. Where is it: “After experience had taught me—”"|"The Skin of Our Teeth"|"Thornton Wilder"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"“Then tell me, O Critias, how will a man choose the ruler that shall rule over him? Will he not choose a man who has first established order in himself, knowing that any decision that has its spring from anger or pride or vanity can be multiplied a thousand fold in its effects upon the citizens?”
HESTER disappears and IVY, as eleven o’clock starts speaking.
IVY:"|"The Skin of Our Teeth"|"Thornton Wilder"
00:00|midnight|"Sudden black-out and silence, except for the last strokes of the midnight bell. Then just as suddenly the lights go up, and SABINA is standing at the window, as at the opening of the play."|"The Skin of Our Teeth"|"Thornton Wilder"
"ap 06:00"|"Six o’clock"|"Oh, oh, oh. Six o’clock and the master not home yet. Pray God nothing serious has happened to him crossing the Hudson River. But I wouldn’t be surprised. The whole world’s at sixes and sevens, and why the house hasn’t fallen down about our ears long ago is a miracle to me."|"The Skin of Our Teeth"|"Thornton Wilder"
