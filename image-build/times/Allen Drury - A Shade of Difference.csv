Who else is there for us to talk to?”—and some combination of like, dislike, affection, annoyance, love, hate, whatever, had kept them together, bickering through their school years and bickering still. It was true that they did know each other better than anyone else did, and that included ’Gage’s placidly limited wife and the hellcat he himself happened to have drawn in the Lord’s sardonic lottery. When things got unhappiest for him, he could always think—and it was genuinely comforting, he would admit— Well, I’ll bet ’Gage knows how I feel; and he was sure ’Gage did, and that ’Gage often thought the same about him, although they rarely came even as close to touching on it as ’Gage had done just now. It was a curious and apparently unbreakable relationship, whose possible implications they had finally faced one time in senior year in a completely candid discussion that certainly didn’t change matters any. “Well, it’s obvious neither of us is a woman,” Cullee had said, “but I guess we can’t live with each other or without each other.” “You make me awful mad sometimes,” ’Gage had agreed, “but I expect if I was ever really—really—in trouble, I’d come to you.” “Me, too,” Cullee said, and they had shaken hands very solemnly, at twenty-one. Then divergent paths to the same objectives had brought increasing criticism, increasing nagging, growing uneasiness and sharpness between them, inflamed and embittered the tensions of their youth, made their friendship ever harder to live with, or without.

Another coffee line soon formed under the great oaks and the air was filled with gossip and speculation about the luncheon to come, its principal guest, its principal organizers, and the pertinence of it all to political events both foreign and domestic. So quietly that hardly anyone at “Harmony” noticed, shades were drawn on the windows of the two houses overlooking the old mansion and a deliberate hush descended on the Battery. Against it the noise and bustle in that one place, emphasized by the surrounding silence, appeared to take on the volume of a small but crowded midway at a circus.

To the insistent demands of the reporters the old and dear friend refused comment.

For a moment the M’Bulu looked puzzled; but the tune sounded familiar, and with a sudden start the former graduate student of Harvard realized what it was. He glanced quickly at his host and was startled to find that for just a second the President gave him the slightest of winks. With a sudden broad grin, he returned it; and so, to the strains of “When the Saints Go Marching In,” played with solid relish by the band, the glittering assemblage passed through the receiving line (“Miss Mumble, Mr. President—sorry, Mrs. Mumble—Mr. Murmur, Your Royal Highness”) through the Green Room, the Blue Room, the Red Room, and so to the State Dining Room, where the hungry throng fell at last upon the lavish repast."|"A Shade of Difference"|"Allen Drury"

Yet there was evident in the glances of the Africans and Asians a subtle but deep-seated satisfaction, a lively sense of the humiliation of their host and his country which thrilled them all, no matter what their other differences and antagonisms might be. On this they were all agreed, and it gave them a certain powerful unity of attitude, made even stronger because it was not matched in the remainder of the company. Senator Cooley might feel angry and resentful (he had carefully been placed between Celestine Barre and Dolly Munson, who did their best to soothe him), and some others might also have no doubts of where they stood, but in the more complex and conscientious minds of many at that pleasant board, not including LeGage Shelby but certainly including Cullee Hamilton, there were doubts and worries, shame for what had happened in Charleston, shame for what it symbolized, angry and conflicting emotions about it, and also, in the hearts and minds of many, a desperate attempt to try to find some fair ground on which all disputing claims and all opposing prejudices could be composed and led to work together toward constructive solution. None of this, however—the smug, superior, supercilious hatred or the troubled, uncertain attempt to be fair—broke through the surface of that distinguished assemblage, whose members talked merrily of this and that as they ate their way steadily through Sea Food Marguery, Broiled Filet Mignon, and assorted side dishes, in an atmosphere inwardly electric with racial tensions and outwardly bland with the necessary suppression of true emotion that so often characterizes the formal occasions of Washington officialdom."|"A Shade of Difference"|"Allen Drury"

He murmured something to his guest of honor, who smiled and apparently agreed, and nodded to the Secretary of State, who shortly thereafter sent his wife home with the Munsons and lingered behind casually. Fifteen minutes later, so skilled and practiced were the White House staff and the military aides at this routine, the last guest had been coated, carred, and carried away. The bands departed, the cleaning crews went busily to work dismantling the table in the state dining room and waxing the East Room, the First Lady said good night and disappeared to the family quarters on the third floor, and in his study on the second the President faced his two remaining guests with a relaxed and comfortable air."|"A Shade of Difference"|"Allen Drury"

The sky was bright with the exaggerated blue of autumn, a very few clearly defined clouds drifted white above the New Jersey Palisades, a lone river steamer plowed slowly up the wind-whipped channel of the Hudson, and close to the churning gray water the sea gulls dipped and swung. Not many cars were on the Drive at ten o’clock on this beautiful Sunday morning, and he drove with the feeling, sometimes unexpectedly granted even in the city of New York, that he was master of the universe. It was a feeling he would have enjoyed any other time, but today, as always on these visits that now extended back over so many years, he felt only a sadness so deep he wondered if he would ever recover from the burden.

It was five o’clock; the early dusk was beginning to fall; the river glinted like molten brass as it stretched away south on his right. Wrapped in a mixture of sunset, fog, and haze, their mystery and magic increased by the twilight, the towers of Manhattan shot up in jumbled confusion against the sky. Like no other city, he thought: no other city. In many buildings the lights were already beginning to come on; across on the Palisades as he went down Riverside Drive the neon signs of amusement parks and grocery products added their twinkling glitter.

22:00|"10 p.m."|"This situation was, of course, attributable principally to the one man to whom such bursts of legislative speed in the House were almost always attributable. The Speaker, who moved in obvious and powerful ways his wonders to perform, had followed up his success in bringing the resolution out of the Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday on a 15-13 vote by arranging for the House Rules Committee to meet later this afternoon and approve the debate rule for Monday. Even with the parliamentary delaying tactics permissible under House rules, this would probably mean a final vote not later than 9 or 10 p.m.; assuming, of course, that the narrow vote in the Foreign Affairs Committee did not accurately reflect the divided sentiment in the House, and assuming also that Seab’s southern friends would not stand together. If the South remained solid and the House was as divided as the Foreign Affairs vote indicated, then the resolution might be stopped in the chamber of its birth and Seab would not have to fight it in the Senate."|"A Shade of Difference"|"Allen Drury"

And there, he suspected, he too should go, having given way to anger, having revealed his own terrible unease, having laid bare the terrible choices that could not be rationalized in a world clamoring for certainties and viciously eager to condemn the middle ground. Into the night he should go and there find—what? More liquor, and what good would that do? More sex, and how permanent an answer would that provide? There were many ways to run away from thinking and self-knowledge in the Borough of Manhattan, but he had discovered one thing, somewhere along the years, and that was the truth of what his mother had said one time when he had done something naughty as a child and threatened loudly to run away from home if he got licked for it. “You can run and run and run,” she had said, “’way down that long dark street, and at the end of it you know what you still going to find?

Now as he looked around his ornate old gold-and-glass office just off the House floor and studied the group draped on sofas and chairs or standing against the wall or crowded up to his desk awaiting his word, he could sense that today they would have been difficult if they had had the time.
