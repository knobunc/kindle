In the giddy relief following her acceptance, he confessed that he had been planning to pop the question in the Thai restaurant where they just had eaten dinner, but that he had reckoned without the silent couple beside them, who had eavesdropped on their entire conversation. He had therefore suggested a walk through the darkening streets, in spite of Robin’s protests that they both needed to be up early, and finally inspiration had seized him, and he had led her, bewildered, to the steps of the statue. There, flinging discretion to the chilly wind (in a most un-Matthew-like way), he had proposed, on one knee, in front of three down-and-outs huddled on the steps, sharing what looked like a bottle of meths."|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"

Was it over, really over, this time? Cocooned in his tiredness, Strike recalled the scenes of last night and this morning. Finally she had done something he could not forgive, and the pain would, no doubt, be excruciating once the anaesthetic wore off: but in the meantime, there were certain practicalities to be faced. It had been Charlotte’s flat that they had been living in; her stylish, expensive maisonette in Holland Park Avenue, which meant that he was, as of two o’clock that morning, voluntarily homeless."|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"

We have seen plenty like you, they seemed to murmur soothingly, as he limped along Oxford Street carrying a boxed-up camp bed. Seven and a half million hearts were beating in close proximity in this heaving old city, and many, after all, would be aching far worse than his.

The grand and gracious white buildings that lined the wide street; the plane trees; the butcher’s shop that might have been stuck in the 1950s; the cafés bustling with the upper middle classes; the sleek restaurants; they had always felt slightly unreal and stagey to Strike.

Sick of the smell of artificial limes, he managed to force open the painted-shut window behind his desk, which allowed a cold, clean breeze to wipe the fusty corners of the two small rooms. Avoiding every CD, every track, that transported him back to those excruciating, exhilarating periods he had shared with Charlotte, he selected Tom Waits to play loudly on the small CD player he had thought he would never see again, and which he had found at the bottom of one of the boxes he had brought from Charlotte’s. He busied himself setting up his portable television, with its paltry indoor aerial; he loaded his worn clothes into a black bin bag and walked to a launderette half a mile away; back at the office, he hung up his shirts and underwear on a rope he slung across one side of the inner office, then watched the three o’clock match between Arsenal and Spurs."|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"

Strike had always suspected that she wanted to prove to herself and the world that she was nothing like their fly-by-night mother, who had dragged the two of them all over the country, from school to school, house to squat to camp, in pursuit of the next enthusiasm or man. Lucy was the only one of his eight half-siblings with whom Strike had shared a childhood; he was fonder of her than of almost anyone else in his life, and yet their interactions were often unsatisfactory, laden with familiar anxieties and arguments. Lucy could not disguise the fact that her brother worried and disappointed her.

LulaMyInspirationForeva had a long list of Unanswered Questions, which included, at number five, ‘Who called off the paps before she fell?’; at number nine, ‘Why did the men with the covered faces runnin away from her flat at 2 a.m. never come forward?

A furore had sprung up, a week after the inquest had returned a verdict of suicide, around the advertising shot for the wares of designer Guy Somé. It featured two models posing in a dirty alleyway, naked except for strategically placed handbags, scarves and jewels. Landry was perched on a dustbin, Ciara Porter sprawled on the ground.

The producer was currently going to court to refute claims, by two newspapers, that he had behaved with gross impropriety towards a young female employee, whose silence he had subsequently bought. The accusations, carefully hedged around with many ‘alleged’s and ‘reported’s, included aggressive sexual advances and a degree of physical bullying. They had been made ‘by a source close to the alleged victim’, the girl herself having refused either to press charges or to speak to the press. The fact that Freddie was currently divorcing his latest wife, Tansy, was mentioned in the concluding paragraph, which ended with a reminder that the unhappy couple had been in the building on the night that Lula Landry took her own life.

"ap 08:30"|"half past eight"|"‘How’s tricks, Federico?’ asked a pallid, straggly-haired young man at half past eight. The newcomer, who dropped into the seat opposite Strike, wore jeans, a psychedelic T-shirt, Converse sneakers, and a leather bag slung diagonally across his chest."|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 11:10"|"ten past eleven"|"Was it convenient now? he asked himself, lying in pain that the pills had yet to touch. He glanced at the time: ten past eleven. She was clearly still awake."|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 10:30"|"ten thirty"|"‘I saw in the file that she was supposed to attend an outpatient clinic at St Thomas’s,’ said Robin excitedly, flushed and talking fast, ‘so I rang up the hospital yesterday evening, pretending to be her, and I said I’d forgotten the time of my appointment, and they told me it’s at ten thirty on Thursday morning. You’ve got,’ she glanced at her computer monitor, ‘fifty-five minutes.’"|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap > 10:00"|"shortly after ten"|"Strike’s memory and map sense were more than adequate to the task of locating the entrance to the psychiatric unit at St Thomas’s, and he proceeded there without mishap, arriving at shortly after ten. He spent five minutes checking that the automatic double doors were the only entrance on Grantley Road, before positioning himself on a stone wall in the car park, some twenty yards away from the entrance, giving him a clear view of everyone entering and leaving."|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 10:20"|"twenty past ten"|"Knowing only that the girl he sought was probably homeless, and certainly black, he had thought through his strategy for finding her on the Tube, and concluded that there was really only one option open to him. At twenty past ten, therefore, when he saw a tall, thin black girl walking briskly towards the entrance, he called out (even though she looked too well-groomed, too neatly dressed):"|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 10:30"|"Half past ten"|"Half past ten passed, and no black girl went through the doors. Either she had missed her appointment, or she had used a different entrance. A feather-light breeze tickled the back of his neck as he sat smoking, watching, waiting. The hospital building was enormous, a vast concrete box with rectangular windows; there were surely numerous entrances on every side."|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
12:00|midday|"Strike straightened his injured leg, which was still sore, and considered, again, the possibility that he would have to return to see his consultant. He found even this degree of proximity to a hospital slightly depressing. His stomach rumbled. He had passed a McDonald’s on the way here. If he had not found her by midday, he would go and eat there."|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap > 11:00"|"just after eleven"|"Then, just after eleven, a short, stocky black girl emerged from the hospital with a slightly awkward, rocking, side-to-side gait. He knew quite well that he had not missed her going in, not only because of her distinctive walk, but because she wore a very noticeable short coat of magenta-coloured fake fur, which flattered neither her height nor her breadth."|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"‘John Bristow called with a mobile number for Marlene Higson. He’s also got through to Guy Somé, who could meet you at ten o’clock on Thursday morning at his studio in Blunkett Street, if that suits. It’s out in Chiswick, near Strand-on-the-Green.’"|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 04:50"|"ten to five"|"They said very little else to each other that day. Strike spent the greater part of the afternoon at the pub, returning only at ten to five. The awkwardness between them persisted, and for the first time, he was quite pleased to see Robin leave."|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"‘I’ve got an appointment with Mr Somé at ten,’ he told her. ‘Cormoran Strike.’"|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
00:00|midnight|"‘No. By midnight I was tucked up in bed with Viktor and Rolf. My cats,’ he added with a flicker of a grin. ‘I took an Ambien, slept for a few hours, then woke up at five in the morning. I switched on Sky News from the bed, and there was a man in a horrible sheepskin hat, standing in the snow in Cuckoo’s street, saying she was dead. The ticker-tape across the bottom of the screen was saying it too.’"|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
05:00|"five in the morning"|"‘No. By midnight I was tucked up in bed with Viktor and Rolf. My cats,’ he added with a flicker of a grin. ‘I took an Ambien, slept for a few hours, then woke up at five in the morning.

The ticker-tape across the bottom of the screen was saying it too.’"|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"‘Why did you think it was Duffield?’ asked Strike, once he judged Trudie to be safely out of earshot.
‘Who else would Cuckoo have let in at two in the morning?’
‘How well do you know him?’"|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"‘She phoned me on the Wednesday, while I was still in Tokyo,’ said Somé. ‘Silly cow always forgot it was eight hours ahead; I had my phone on mute at two in the morning, so I didn’t pick up; but she left a message, and she was not suicidal. Listen to this.’"|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"‘She’d been through this head-fuck for a few months. There’d been a stalker who was hand-delivering letters through her front door at three in the morning; she kept getting woken up by the letter box going. The things he said he wanted to do to her, it scared her. Then she split up with Duffield, and she had the paps round the front of her house all the bloody time. Then she finds out they’re hacking all her calls. And then she had to go and find that bitch of a mother. It was all getting too much. She wanted to be away from it all, to feel secure. I told her to move in with me, but instead she went and bought that fucking mausoleum."|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"‘Fuck… Freddie Bestigui? Well, he’s a shit, I know that. This little girl I know… well, friend of a friend… she was working for his production company, and he tried to fucking rape her. No, I am not exaggerating,’ said Somé. ‘Literally. Rape. Got her a bit drunk after work and had her on the floor; some assistant had forgotten his mobile and came back for it, and walked in on them. Bestigui paid them both off. Everyone was telling her to press charges, but she took the money and ran. They say he used to discipline his second wife in some pretty fucking kinky ways; that’s why she walked away with three mill; she threatened him with the press. But Cuckoo would never have let Freddie Bestigui into her flat at two in the morning. Like I say, she wasn’t a stupid girl.’"|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
11:00|"eleven in the morning"|"The Ordnance Arms sat beside the English Pawnbroking Company Ltd. It was a large, low-slung, off-white-painted pub. The interior was no-nonsense and utilitarian, with a selection of wooden clocks on a terracotta-coloured wall and a lividly patterned piece of red carpet the only gesture to anything as frivolous as decoration. Otherwise, there were two large pool tables, a long and accessible bar and plenty of empty space for milling drinkers. Just now, at eleven in the morning, it was empty except for one little old man in the corner and a cheery serving girl, who addressed her only customer as ‘Joey’ and gave Strike directions through the back."|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 05:00"|five|"‘OK.’
‘If I’m not back at five, you can lock up.’
‘Yes, of course.’"|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 07:10"|"ten past seven"|"Checking her watch, she saw that it was now ten past seven. She called Matthew, and told him she was dealing with an urgent situation at the office. He did not sound pleased."|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
14:00|"2 p.m."|"I have set an alarm just outside your door for 2 p.m., so that you have enough time to get ready for your 5 p.m. appointment at 1 Arlington Place, to interview Ciara Porter and Bryony Radford."|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
17:00|"5 p.m."|"I have set an alarm just outside your door for 2 p.m., so that you have enough time to get ready for your 5 p.m. appointment at 1 Arlington Place, to interview Ciara Porter and Bryony Radford."|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"A cautiously light meal, copious amounts of water, another evacuatory trip to the restaurant bathroom, more painkillers; then, at five o’clock, a prompt arrival at number 1, Arlington Place."|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap ~ 03:00"|"about three"|"‘I got there about three. She and Ciara were all excited about Deeby Macc arriving. Girlie gossip, you know. I’d never have guessed what was coming. Never.’"|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap < 09:00"|"nearly nine o’clock"|"The shoot lasted for another three hours. Strike waited in the garden, smoking and consuming more bottled water, while dusk fell. From time to time he wandered back into the building to check on progress, which seemed immensely slow. Occasionally he glimpsed or heard Somé, whose temper seemed frayed, barking instructions at the photographer or one of the black-clad minions who flitted between clothes racks. Finally, at nearly nine o’clock, after Strike had consumed a few slices of the pizza that had been ordered by the morose and exhausted stylist’s assistant, Ciara Porter descended the stairs where she had been posing with her two colleagues, and joined Strike in the make-up room, which Bryony was busy stripping bare."|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
"~ 12:00"|"around midday"|"‘Lula called you repeatedly between around midday and six in the evening, but you didn’t answer your phone.’"|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"

"ap 04:30"|"Half past four"|"‘Oh, cheers. Cheers. Yeah. Well, I got the driver to drop me off and I went to visit my friend, who has since given the police a full statement to that effect, as Uncle Tony might say. Then I wandered around a bit, and there’s camera footage in that station to prove that, and then about, I dunno… threeish? Fourish?’
‘Half past four,’ said Ciara.
‘Yeah, I went to crash at Ciara’s.’"|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
02:30|"half past two that morning"|"It was a photograph of Ciara following Duffield into his flat. Ciara looked stunning; for half a second Strike was transported back to half past two that morning, when she had lain, white and naked, beneath him, that long silky hair spread on the pillow like a mermaid’s as she whispered and moaned."|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 02:00"|two|"‘It says,’ said Robin, turning to the inside page, ‘that she left Duffield’s with her security guard at two.’"|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
"> 01:00"|"after one in the morning"|"‘If she was, why turn up at all? Because it was worth it, for some purpose of her own. And if she wasn’t a spoiled bitch, she must have been in some kind of emotional state that made her act out of character. There’s a living witness to the fact that Lula begged somebody, over the phone, to come and see her, at her flat, sometime after one in the morning. There’s also that piece of blue paper she had before she went into Vashti, and which nobody’s admitting to having seen since. What did she do with it? Why was she writing in the back of the car, before she saw Rochelle?’"|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 05:00"|five|"It was she who had called Strike. Hours had passed since she had received a text saying that he had been compelled to go with the police to Scotland Yard, and asking her to lock up the office behind her at five. Robin had been worried."|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 10:30"|"half past ten"|"Strike roused himself and looked at his watch. It was half past ten, but he was sure the man to whom he wished to speak would be awake. He flicked on his desk lamp, took up his mobile and dialled, this time, a number in Germany."|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap ~ 11:00"|"About eleven"|"‘What time did you get there?’
‘About eleven, but he’d—’
‘Cyprian must’ve sent you out the moment you got to work, did he?’"|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 10:30"|"Ten thirty"|"Strike waited.
‘All right,’ said Bristow. ‘All right. Ten thirty tomorrow.’
"|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 10:30"|"Ten thirty"|"Ten thirty arrived, but John Bristow did not. The square remained deserted, but for the twenty small children running between hoops and coloured cones beyond the railings."|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 10:45"|"ten forty-five"|"At ten forty-five, Strike’s mobile vibrated in his pocket. The text was from Robin:"|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 10:55"|"five to eleven"|"It was five to eleven. Strike waited, phone in hand, in the peaceful, leafy square, while the gambolling children played with their hoops and their beanbags, and a tiny silver plane drew a thick white line across the periwinkle sky. At last, with a small chirrup clearly audible in the quiet street, Bristow’s texted reply arrived:"|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"Robin had been calling Strike every ten minutes since one o’clock, but he had not picked up. She rang again as he was climbing, with enormous difficulty, up the metal stairs towards the office, heaving himself up with the use of his arms. She heard his ringtone echoing up the stairwell, and hurried out on to the top landing."|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 00:45"|"quarter to one"|"He looked down at his wrist. His cheap watch seemed to have hit something when he had fallen downstairs, because it had stopped at a quarter to one."|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"But six o’clock came, and then half past, and nobody rang the bell. Strike rubbed more cream into the end of his leg, and reattached the prosthesis, which was agony. He limped through into the inner office, emitting grunts of pain, slumped down in his chair and, giving up, took the false leg off again and slid down, to lay his head on his arms, intending to do no more than rest his tired eyes."|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"‘… an appointment for Tuesday, I’m afraid, because Mr Strike’s busy all day Monday… Yes… absolutely… I’ll put you down for eleven o’clock, then. Yes. Thank you. Goodbye.’"|"The Cuckoo's Calling"|"Robert Galbraith"
