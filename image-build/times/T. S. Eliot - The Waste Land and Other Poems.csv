"ap 06:00"|"Six o’clock"|"The winter evening settles down 
With smell of steaks in passageways. 
Six o’clock. 
The burnt-out ends of smoky days. 
And now a gusty shower wraps 
The grimy scraps 
Of withered leaves about your feet 
And newspapers from vacant lots; 
The showers beat 
On broken blinds and chimney-pots, 
And at the corner of the street 
A lonely cab-horse steams and stamps."|"The Waste Land and Other Poems"|"T. S. Eliot"
"ap 04:00"|four|"His soul stretched tight across the skies 
That fade behind a city block, 
Or trampled by insistent feet 
At four and five and six o’clock; 
And short square fingers stuffing pipes, 
And evening newspapers, and eyes 
Assured of certain certainties, 
The conscience of a blackened street 
Impatient to assume the world."|"The Waste Land and Other Poems"|"T. S. Eliot"

Along the reaches of the street 
Held in a lunar synthesis,  
Whispering lunar incantations 
Dissolve the floors of memory  
And all its clear relations 
Its divisions and precisions. 
Every street lamp that I pass 
Beats like a fatalistic drum, 
And through the spaces of the dark 
Midnight shakes the memory 
As a madman shakes a dead geranium."|"The Waste Land and Other Poems"|"T. S. Eliot"

"ap 01:30"|"Half-past one"|"Half-past one, 
The street-lamp sputtered, 
The street-lamp muttered, 
The street-lamp said, ‘Regard that woman  
Who hesitates toward you in the light of the door 
Which opens on her like a grin. 
You see the border of her dress 
Is torn and stained with sand, 
And you see the corner of her eye 
Twists like a crooked pin.’"|"The Waste Land and Other Poems"|"T. S. Eliot"
"ap 02:30"|"Half-past two"|"Half-past two, 
The street-lamp said, 
‘Remark the cat which flattens itself in the gutter, 
Slips out its tongue 
And devours a morsel of rancid butter.’ 
So the hand of the child, automatic, 
Slipped out and pocketed a toy that was running 
along the quay. 
I could see nothing behind that child’s eye. 
I have seen eyes in the street 
Trying to peer through lighted shutters, 
And a crab one afternoon in a pool, 
An old crab with barnacles on his back, 
Gripped the end of a stick which I held him."|"The Waste Land and Other Poems"|"T. S. Eliot"
"ap 03:30"|"Half-past three"|"Half-past three, 
The lamp sputtered, 
The lamp muttered in the dark. 
The lamp hummed: 
‘Regard the moon, 
La lune ne garde aucune rancune, 
She winks a feeble eye, 
She smiles into corners. 
She smooths the hair of the grass. 
The moon has lost her memory. 
A washed-out smallpox cracks her face, 
Her hand twists a paper rose, 
That smells of dust and eau de Cologne, 
She is alone 
With all the old nocturnal smells 
That cross and cross across her brain.’ 
The reminiscence comes 
Of sunless dry geraniums 
And dust in crevices, 
Smells of chestnuts in the streets, 
And female smells in shuttered rooms, 
And cigarettes in corridors 
And cocktail smells in bars.  
The lamp said, 
‘Four o’clock, 
Here is the number on the door. 
Memory! 
You have the key, 
The little lamp spreads a ring on the stair. 
Mount. 
The bed is open; the tooth-brush hangs on the 
wall, 
Put your shoes at the door, sleep, prepare for life.’"|"The Waste Land and Other Poems"|"T. S. Eliot"

00:00|midnight|"She turned away, but with the autumn weather 
Compelled my imagination many days, 
Many days and many hours: 
Her hair over her arms and her arms full of 
flowers. 
And I wonder how they should have been together! 
I should have lost a gesture and a pose. 
Sometimes these cogitations still amaze 
The troubled midnight and the noon’s repose."|"The Waste Land and Other Poems"|"T. S. Eliot"

"ap 09:00"|nine|"Unreal City,  
Under the brown fog of a winter dawn, . 
A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many, 
I had not thought death had undone so many.  
Sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled,  
And each man fixed his eyes before his feet. 
Flowed up the hill and down King William Street, 
To where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the hours 
With a dead sound on the final stroke of nine.  
There I saw one I knew, and stopped him, crying: 
‘Stetson! 
‘You who were with me in the ships at Mylae!  
‘That corpse you planted last year in your garden, 
‘Has it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year? 
‘Or has the sudden frost disturbed its bed? 
‘O keep the Dog far hence, that’s friend to men,  
‘Or with his nails he’ll dig it up again! 
‘You! hypocrite lecteur!—mon semblable.—mon 
frère!’"|"The Waste Land and Other Poems"|"T. S. Eliot"

Under the brown fog of a winter noon 
Mr. Eugenides, the Smyrna merchant 
Unshaven, with a pocket full of currants  
C.i.f. London: documents at sight, 
Asked me in demotic French 
To luncheon at the Cannon Street Hotel  
Followed by a weekend at the Metropole."|"The Waste Land and Other Poems"|"T. S. Eliot"
12:00|noon|"‘This music crept by me upon the waters’  
And along the Strand, up Queen Victoria Street.  
O City city, I can sometimes hear 
Beside a public bar in Lower Thames Street,  
The pleasant whining of a mandoline 
And a clatter and a chatter from within 
Where fishmen lounge at noon: where the walls 
Of Magnus Martyr hold 
Inexplicable splendour of Ionian white and gold."|"The Waste Land and Other Poems"|"T. S. Eliot"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o‘clock"|"They are going to take the eight o‘clock train  
To prolong their misery from Padua to Milan  
Where one finds The Last Supper, and a cheap restaurant.  
He thinks about tips, and draws up his balance sheet.  
They will have seen Switzerland and crossed France.  
And Saint Apollinaire, stiff and ascetic,  
Old deconsecrated factory, still holding  
In its crumbling stones the precise form of Byzantium."|"The Waste Land and Other Poems"|"T. S. Eliot"
