"ap 07:25"|7:25|"I pause by a window in the E Wing and wait for the Dauntless to arrive. I do this every morning. At exactly 7:25, the Dauntless prove their bravery by jumping from a moving train."|Divergent|"Veronica Roth"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"“Some ground rules,” he says. “You have to be in the training room by eight o’clock every day. Training takes place every day from eight to six, with a break for lunch. You are free to do whatever you like after six. You will also get some time off between each stage of initiation.”"|Divergent|"Veronica Roth"

You are free to do whatever you like after six. You will also get some time off between each stage of initiation.”"|Divergent|"Veronica Roth"
"ap 05:00"|5:00|"But she doesn’t fall. She grabs the bars of the barrier. Her fingers slide down the metal until I can’t see her head anymore; they are all I see.
Al’s watch reads 5:00.
“Five minutes are up,” he says, almost spitting the words at Eric."|Divergent|"Veronica Roth"
"ap 08:15"|"eight fifteen"|"“I just wanted to tell you that you missed Eric’s announcement. We’re going on a field trip tomorrow, to the fence, to learn about Dauntless jobs,” he says. “We have to be at the train by eight fifteen.”"|Divergent|"Veronica Roth"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"The clock reads eight. We’re supposed to be at the tracks by eight fifteen."|Divergent|"Veronica Roth"

"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"Once we cross the bridge, the city changes. Behind us, most of the buildings were in use, and even if they weren’t, they looked well-tended. In front of us is a sea of crumbling concrete and broken glass. The silence of this part of the city is eerie; it feels like a nightmare. It’s hard to see where I’m going, because it’s after midnight and all the city lights are off."|Divergent|"Veronica Roth"
12:00|NOON|"CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
IT’S NOON. LUNCHTIME.
I sit in a hallway I don’t recognize. I walked here because I needed to get away from the dormitory. Maybe if I bring my bedding here, I will never have to go to the dormitory again. It may be my imagination, but it still smells like blood in there, even though I scrubbed the floor until my hands were sore, and someone poured bleach on it this morning."|Divergent|"Veronica Roth"
"ap 04:00"|Four|"The answer is obvious: Eric. They trained him to be vicious, and now he will train the rest of us to be vicious too.
I look at Four. Their training didn’t work on him.
“So if you were ranked first in your initiate class,” I say, “what was Eric’s rank?”"|Divergent|"Veronica Roth"
"ap 04:00"|Four|"I turn away from the chasm and see movement on the right side of the Pit. A figure climbs toward the glass ceiling, and judging by the smooth way he walks, like his feet barely leave the ground, I know it is Four."|Divergent|"Veronica Roth"
00:00|midnight|"I run quietly, breathless when I reach the stairs, and stand at one end of the glass room while Four stands at the other. Through the windows I see the city lights, glowing now but petering out even as I look at them. They are supposed to turn off at midnight."|Divergent|"Veronica Roth"
"ap 04:00"|Four|"“Like you wouldn’t use an advantage if you had one,” retorts Uriah.
Christina ignores them. “I hope it’s Four’s landscape.”
“Why?” I ask. The question comes out too incredulous. I bite my lip and wish I could take it back."|Divergent|"Veronica Roth"
"ap 11:30"|"eleven thirty"|"“Not now.” He glances around. “Meet me back here at eleven thirty. Don’t tell anyone where you’re going.”"|Divergent|"Veronica Roth"
"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"I nod and open my eyes. We both stand, and he tugs me with him to the open door of the train car. The wind is not as strong now that the train has slowed. It’s past midnight, so all the street lights are dark, and the buildings look like mammoths as they rise from the darkness and then sink into it again. Tobias lifts a hand and points at a cluster of buildings, so far away they are the size of a fingernail. They are the only bright spot in the dark sea around us. Erudite headquarters again."|Divergent|"Veronica Roth"
12:00|noon|"Initiation day plunges the Dauntless compound into insanity and chaos. There are people everywhere, and most of them are inebriated by noon. I fight my way through them to get a plate of food at lunch and carry it back to the dormitory with me. On the way I see someone fall off the path on the Pit wall and, judging by his screams and the way he grabs at his leg, he broke something."|Divergent|"Veronica Roth"
"ap 03:12"|"Three twelve"|"“What time is it?” I ask Caleb.
He checks his watch. “Three twelve.”
“Should be here any second,” I say."|Divergent|"Veronica Roth"
