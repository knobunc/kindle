"ap > 09:00"|"just after nine"|"She was not long left in doubt on that point. She and Miss Lawson returned from attending Early Service just after nine. Dr. and Mrs. Tanios were in the dining room, but there were no signs of the two Arundells. After breakfast, when the others had left, Miss Arundell sat on, entering up some accounts in a little book."|"Dumb Witness"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 10:30"|"half past ten"|"“At half past ten breakfast will be cleared away,” said Miss Arundell. “I know it is the fashion not to consider servants nowadays, but that is not the case in my house.”"|"Dumb Witness"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 06:30"|"half past six"|"Miss Arundell stooped down, picked up the ball from where Bob laid it at her feet and went into the house, Bob followed her closely. She shut the side door, went into the drawing room, Bob still at her heels, and put the ball away in the drawer.
She glanced at the clock on the mantelpiece. It was half past six.
“A little rest before dinner, I think, Bob.”"|"Dumb Witness"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"Dr. Donaldson did not stay late. He rose to go at ten o’clock. After he had taken his departure Emily Arundell herself announced that she was going to bed. She went upstairs and her young relations went up also. They all seemed somewhat subdued tonight. Miss Lawson remained downstairs performing her final duties, letting Bob out for his run, poking down the fire, putting the guard up and rolling back the hearth rug in case of fire."|"Dumb Witness"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 01:00"|"One o’clock"|"She raised herself on her elbow and by the light of the nightlight that always burned in a little saucer she looked at the time.
One o’clock and she had never felt less like sleep.
She got out of bed and put on her slippers and her warm dressing gown. She would go downstairs and just check over the weekly books ready for the paying of them the following morning."|"Dumb Witness"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"She went over in her mind all the events from six o’clock yesterday evening… She retraced every step…till she came to the moment when she arrived at the stairhead and started to descend the stairs…."|"Dumb Witness"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 00:00"|"twelve o’clock"|"Our drive took us about an hour and a half, and it was close upon twelve o’clock when we came into the little town of Market Basing. Originally on the main road, a modern bypass now left it some three miles to the north of the main stream of traffic and in consequence it had kept an air of old-fashioned dignity and quietude about it. Its one wide street and ample market square seemed to say, “I was a place of importance once and to any person of sense and breeding I am still the same. Let this modern speeding world dash along their newfangled road; I was built to endure in a day when solidarity and beauty went hand in hand.”"|"Dumb Witness"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap ~ 02:00"|"about two o’clock"|"“Certainly—certainly. I’ll ring up and tell them to expect you about two o’clock—eh? Is that right?”"|"Dumb Witness"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"“By Jove, do you know it’s three o’clock already? What will Anderson think? I ought to telephone to him.” I turned to the woman. “I wonder if I might use your telephone if you have one.”"|"Dumb Witness"|"Agatha Christie"
04:00|"four in the morning"|"“Oh, it’s quite true, sir. Once or twice he’s gone off and come home perhaps at four in the morning. Then he sits down on the step and barks till he’s let in.”"|"Dumb Witness"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"“Yes, it was horrible… It was also unsuccessful… Miss Arundell was very little hurt though she might easily have broken her neck. Very disappointing for our unknown friend! But Miss Arundell was a sharp-witted old lady. Everyone told her she had slipped on the ball, and there the ball was in evidence, but she herself recalling the happening felt that the accident had arisen differently. She had not slipped on the ball. And in addition she remembered something else. She remembered hearing Bob barking for admission at five o’clock the next morning."|"Dumb Witness"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 05:30"|"half past five"|"“I have regarded it—looked at it, I mean. It’s half past five. Tea is clearly indicated.”"|"Dumb Witness"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap > 06:00"|"after six o’clock"|"“Always the afternoon tea with you English! No, mon ami, no tea for us. In a book of etiquette I read the other day that one must not make the afternoon call after six o’clock. To do so is to commit the solecism. We have, therefore, but half an hour in which to accomplish our purpose.”"|"Dumb Witness"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap ~ 04:00"|"about four o’clock"|"We arrived in Harchester about four o’clock and made our way straight to the offices of Purvis, Purvis, Charlesworth and Purvis."|"Dumb Witness"|"Agatha Christie"

"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"He then wrote a note to Miss Lawson saying that he would call at Littlegreen House at eleven o’clock."|"Dumb Witness"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap ~ 10:15"|"about a quarter past ten"|"After that we breakfasted and then strolled out into the Square. It was about a quarter past ten and a hot sleepy morning."|"Dumb Witness"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap ~ 01:40"|"about twenty to two"|"On the way to London we talked very little. I am not fond of talking and driving, and Poirot was so busy protecting his moustaches with his muffler from the disastrous effects of wind and dust that speech was quite beyond him.
We arrived at the flat at about twenty to two.
George, Poirot’s immaculate and extremely English manservant, opened the door."|"Dumb Witness"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap ~ 10:30"|"About half past ten"|"“What time was this?”
“About half past ten, sir.”
Poirot shook his head as he passed on towards the sitting room."|"Dumb Witness"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"“Mrs. Tanios left the hotel this morning early. She returned at eleven, waited in the taxi whilst her luggage was brought down and drove away with it.”"|"Dumb Witness"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"“Yes? Yes… certainly. Yes, quite convenient. The afternoon, I think. Yes, two o’clock will do admirably.” He replaced the receiver and turned to me with a smile."|"Dumb Witness"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"“Dr. Donaldson is anxious to have a talk with me. He is coming here tomorrow afternoon at two o’clock. We progress, mon ami, we progress.”"|"Dumb Witness"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"Donaldson arrived punctually at two o’clock. He was as calm and precise as ever."|"Dumb Witness"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"“Captain Hastings? This is Mrs. Tanios speaking. Will you tell M. Poirot that he is perfectly right. If he will come here tomorrow morning at ten o’clock, I will give him what he wants.”"|"Dumb Witness"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"“Captain Hastings? This is Mrs. Tanios speaking. Will you tell M. Poirot that he is perfectly right. If he will come here tomorrow morning at ten o’clock, I will give him what he wants.”
“At ten o’clock tomorrow?”
“Yes.”"|"Dumb Witness"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap > 09:00"|"a few minutes past nine"|"It was a few minutes past nine when I entered the sitting room the next morning. Poirot was at the breakfast table—as usual neatly slitting open his letters."|"Dumb Witness"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap ~ 00:30"|"about half past twelve"|"Mrs. Peters as she had called herself and her two children had arrived about half past twelve. They had had lunch at one o’clock."|"Dumb Witness"|"Agatha Christie"

"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"At four o’clock a man had arrived with a note for Mrs. Peters. The note had been sent up to her. A few minutes later she had come down with the two children and a suitcase. The children had then left with the visitor. Mrs. Peters had gone to the office and explained that she should only want the one room after all."|"Dumb Witness"|"Agatha Christie"
"ap ~ 07:30"|"about seven thirty"|"She had not appeared exceptionally distressed or upset, indeed she had seemed quite calm and collected. She had had dinner about seven thirty and had gone to her room soon afterwards."|"Dumb Witness"|"Agatha Christie"

It was eleven o’clock the following morning.
Seven people were assembled at Littlegreen House."|"Dumb Witness"|"Agatha Christie"
