I was sitting around with nothing to do, getting bored, when suddenly I remembered there was a dessert to eat. I went over to the icebox and opened it up, and there she’d left _six_ desserts! There was a chocolate pudding, a piece of cake, some peach slices, some rice pudding, some jello–there was everything! So I sat there and ate the six desserts–it was sensational!"|"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"|"Richard P. Feynman"
"ap 01:00"|one|"I did the same kind of trick four years later at Princeton when I was talking with an experienced character, an assistant of Einstein, who was surely working with gravity all the time. I gave him a problem: You blast off in a rocket which has a clock on board, and there’s a clock on the ground. The idea is that you have to be back when the clock on the ground says one hour has passed. Now you want it so that when you come back, your clock is as far ahead as possible. According to Einstein, if you go very high, your clock will go faster, because the higher something is in a gravitational field, the faster its clock goes. But if you try to go too high, since you’ve only got an hour, you have to go so fast to get there that the speed slows your clock down. So you can’t go too high. The question is, exactly what program of speed and height should you make so that you get the maximum time on your clock?"|"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"|"Richard P. Feynman"
