The snake put out its forked tongue tentatively, hesitated, and began to penetrate the cage, moving slowly over the dried grass. Meanwhile Henny had burned herself again, under the ear, an ugly burn that she could not afford, for her hair scarcely fell there. But the slot door fell to, and the snake was home again, sitting in the eleven o’clock sun, grudgingly awake on this cold day."|"The Man Who Loved Children"|"Christina Stead"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"It was not raining, but it should have rained. No fresh breeze had cleared away the exhalations since the evening before, and the air stuck to them like a wet rag. There were bucketfuls of water hanging in the air over their heads. Sam, towhead bare, panama in hand, all in crumpled white, with his Indian secretary, a Madrasi Kerani, trotting, walking hurriedly a step in the rear, went pushing his way along the busy five o’clock street. The immense open gutters, pitfalls, were spanned every few feet by large flagstones, and Sam and Naden had to keep dodging over these into the open street to avoid crushes and social affairs on the pavement—a family with its mattresses and rags preparing to sleep out during the steaming night, a wedding feast, with its tables and benches and hundred guests taking up several frontages, the thirteen-year-old bridegroom bedizened and bedaubed, in white cap, posing with father and uncles for his photograph. All the traffic of the pavement as well as Sam and Naden had to serpentine around these knots. Chinese lanterns and naked bulbs were strung across the pavement, and open flares lighted the tables. A Chinese peddler with a small basket was selling noisemakers, a whirring whistle very loud and highly painted, and red, white, and blue trumpets, but he could hardly make himself heard, even though Sam and Naden were thrusting along right beside him. A peddler somewhere in the throng was shouting “choklets-choklets,” but all they saw were two sandaled feet sticking out of a globular swarm of market baskets of all sorts—no head was visible, nor a body, but through the rattan and pandanus solar system came the voice."|"The Man Who Loved Children"|"Christina Stead"
"ap 04:00"|"four-o’clock"|"Sam was thinking about the night ahead of him. He would sink on his fresh pillow and at once sweat would start from him, a Niagara of sweat, and drown the pillow and the bedding and his pajamas. Shutters, cool floors, open verandas, baths, and changes of clothes twice daily did nothing against the exhausting sweating and the heat. He would drowse and wake up any moment, any hour, with fear in him, his heart yawing and plunging into some small but bottomless pit, his head full of lead. All he could do, if it was near morning, would be to call to the boy, “Syce, tea,” and swing slowly up and out, balancing himself and his head carefully. The tea would help him for a while, making him sweat profusely, and he would have half an hour in which to hope that one of his heat headaches was not going to arrive and stay with him till the four-o’clock breeze or the next nightfall."|"The Man Who Loved Children"|"Christina Stead"

He would take exercise every day, walk wherever he could, to find out how the people lived and what they were; he would speak to the dark skin and strange nether garment as a brother, and he would never fall under the sodden spell of alcohol. He struggled unaided except by iced water, through the drowsiness of the siesta hours, trying to write his impressions and articles for papers back home (he very much admired the profession of the journalist, thinking him a good retail purveyor of enlightenment); and about five or six would go home to take a shower and would sit with a bath towel round his loins, or with nothing on at all but a clout, while he wrote up his diary or his mail for the day. But in this climate everything had become a weariness of the flesh, even writing and speaking. He, a man capable of doing walks of twenty miles on Sundays, at home, here could hardly make ten paces without feeling weak. Still he kept it up, walking round Singapore, or the other towns, or struggling through the jungle without a moan, avoiding the European streets and shops, finding the poorest, immigrant and native-born people, the ones with no home, the ones that walked the streets all night, even after nightfall and against all warnings roaming the congested streets, through dark throngs whose faces he could not see but only suspect in the flashing of an eyeball, tooth, or trinket, in the light of a shop lamp, or electric sign hanging downwards, or the frosted bleary sparkle of some miserable shopwindow, perhaps mildew-grown."|"The Man Who Loved Children"|"Christina Stead"

You see the glorious foreshores, with their four tiers of trees, the fifty feet, the hundred, the hundred and fifty, and the two hundred, all shades of green, all fronds and foliages laced together; and it is too hot to take a boat to go there. (There is such a lovely stretch behind Singapore in the Strait.) Then you see a lovely sheet of water; but it is too hot to so much as go down to it. You are invited to tea by a lovely lady, and it is too hot to go. You try to keep your temper with a foolish, vain gnat of a human being, and it is too hot to do so. Because it is TOO HOT everywhere.

Beyond were brilliant green islets and jetties with water in every direction, the long, low shoulders sloping towards the town and huts on piers standing in the water. The ship was gorgeous as ships can be in the tropics, with decks, walls, and every object radiating heat and light, the women in colored dresses of semi-transparent stuff or white tropical weaves, handkerchiefs on their heads and waists, and everyone bustling and gay, glad to be going, excited by the Singapore stop."|"The Man Who Loved Children"|"Christina Stead"

In the meantime, sounds of cheer came from the house where everyone was helping Jinny, Sam’s sister-in-law, and Louie and Hazel decorate the place and get ready for the banquet to which they would sit down at six o’clock. Bonnie was there, not herself, a little sad and quiet, with a thin face. She was staying with Jinny in Baltimore and helping in the house. But Bonnie, after quietly embracing and weeping over Sam, had gone back to work for his party, just the same, and she was at present tasting her Badminton Cup, her own secret specialty, for which dear Lennie, her brother, had brought three bottles of claret and one of curaçao. As all Sam’s parties hitherto had been nonalcoholic, this was to be the great surprise of the day; for certainly, everyone argued, since Sam went abroad, he had learned to be more a man of the world, and he, at least, would never object."|"The Man Who Loved Children"|"Christina Stead"

Not even a breeze stirred the hundred-year-old elms on the south-facing bluff of Tohoga Place. Overhead stretched an immense, tender spring sky. The budding trees, already root-hid in weeds, ran up the hill on all sides. The surrounding streets, their hollows, the lesser heights, and dome bubbles of reeking Washington were visible; the world was a milky cameo at sunup. The neglected garden thronged upwards with all its plants into the new sun, with its guava trees, peach trees, magnolia trees, apple trees, seedling pines and forsythia, and the wild double narcissus that grew so rank and green on the possums’ graves."|"The Man Who Loved Children"|"Christina Stead"

"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"Sam told Louie first, trailing out his misery, then Ernie, and then took the three little boys away down to the snake cages and told them they had to leave those slopes and gardens bursting up into a new spring. They were to be sold: other children would have the right to be there. One by one, the children became subdued, all except Little-Womey, who, with the orange wreath in her hair, was running to all her friends, the neighbors, showing off her beauty, with her soft deer eyes running over with mirth and excitement, while she told them they were all going away from Tohoga House and going to live in Virginia. By ten o’clock the next morning everyone knew it who knew Sam, and the Department was full of excitement. So he got nothing out of the old man at the last: so he had sold out for the fleshpots of Egypt and in the pots was nothing but dandelion salad. So Old Softsoap wasn’t going from triumph to triumph; and one evil young man got up a story that it was very queer, Sam had been away from home ten months and yet he arrived home to the birth of a new son, oh, entirely in order, the result of a queer gynecological condition. Although it was a lie, everyone was delighted and by nightfall, instead of its being a joke and a tall story, it had become a bit of truthful scandal, the low-down on the private life of a social and service climber, a grinning Pharisee and rich man’s pet. Twenty-four hours before, Sam had been the rising star of the service and now people skipped from desk to desk laughing about him and saying that he was a sneak, milksop, and goody-goody. Sam, for all his credo of the firm handclasp and frank smile, had made a sufficiency of enemies for all sorts of reasons—little enemies, people beneath him in grade and fortune, people he had never troubled to conciliate because they were mean. He had refused to consider religious partisanship or join any fraternities, “no phratries,” he said contemptuously, and he had joined gaily, frequently, and with the naïvest faith in his luck, in all sorts of foolish campaigns against minor bureaucrats, sprinkling his talk with their insulting nicknames."|"The Man Who Loved Children"|"Christina Stead"

Other members of the Expedition were mentioned, including Samuel Pollit, originally of the Bureau of Fisheries and organizer and now head of the Conservation Bureau; and it was hinted (much to Sam’s surprise) that Sam now might move to another sphere of activities. As the Conservation Bureau was Sam’s beloved child, and yet coveted by numerous others who considered themselves better qualified than he, this unexpected paragraph in the Post gave him a sinking feeling; and he began harking back to the dreams of snakes he had had since his return home. “Shoals ahead,” said Sam in a midday conference with his old friend Saul Pilgrim, “but I am on deck, they won’t torpedo me. This is Crabby Willets’ doing. Residents of Virginia and Maryland are allowed to crab in the Potomac, not in the Bureau.”"|"The Man Who Loved Children"|"Christina Stead"

Sam, with the boys, was taking the house apart and putting it together again on a different plan. He himself would renew the furnace system, take down the chimneys, pull out the bathroom, install a shower room, make new steps, put in timbers in the decrepit veranda, put in glass where it was broken, patch the plaster, calcimine, paint, and otherwise repair. The great project filled him with joy. “With my own labor union,” said he to them, “I need nobody; no strikes, no trouble, only the work going up fast.”"|"The Man Who Loved Children"|"Christina Stead"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"When he felt cheerfully warm, they began to talk about the neighbors, about whom they had just as many comical legends as about the Georgetown neighbors; and the kingpin, of course, was the atrocious “Coffin” Lomasne. Fearful tales were told of him—he was a vile spider of usury spinning foolish, weak, necessitous flies into his web. Sam told them all about poor Lai Wan Hoe and his troubles with the usurers, how he had to embezzle and fly, all because of Usurious Greed; and how they should not say such a man was an octopus, because an octopus was a sweet, clean beast whose rose-pink flesh they had eaten, but who would want to eat ghoulish Lomasne? An octopus was swift as shadow, a subtle chameleon, brave, clever, a battler—who could say so of “Coffin” Lomasne? And then they invented wilder tales about “Coffin”—dead marines rose out of his cheap coffins at night; one night the sucking marsh would open underneath him and try to digest him into the black mud where his poor corpses, oozing from their cheap coffins, lay, but being too vile and indigestible, he would be spewed up again. He was so mean, said Sam (inventing freely), that he kept his own excrement in a pit and doled it out to his own vegetables. The children shrieked, gasped with laughter, and got red in the face; for in general such jokes were not allowed at Spa House. Sam averred that “Coffin” was slowly turning diarrhea color, his clothes were stolen “from the swaddling clothes they wraps corps [corpses] in,” and his cap was a candle extinguisher stolen from a wake. He made his wife eat candles stolen from wakes, said Sam, and they ate dandelion salad. What were the rats and cats that hung round “Coffin” Lomasne’s, asked Sam, especially at night? Where did “Coffin” put his money, Sam speculated. He pictured the money put away in one of the coffins, and then he pictured “Coffin’s” end: one night at one o’clock when all slept and the mud bubbled round his place, the mud that could not digest him, three poor blacks, invisible in the black night, would come and take “Coffin,” place him in one of his own coffin-rowboats and row him out and across the deeps of the Chesapeake; and when they came to the Happy Hunting Grounds of the dead Susquehannocks, the shady braves would skin him alive and skin him dead and burn him at the stake and chop him up to feed the ghosts of sharks upon, and those ghostly sharks expiring in a shady way would become devil sharks and feed upon the others, and so on to a great Armageddon in the shadow world, all because no one could stand the poison of “Coffin’s” shade."|"The Man Who Loved Children"|"Christina Stead"
11:00|"eleven in the morning"|"Ernie thought about it all during long hours. He harried Henny many days with his questions and calculations. He alone knew, of all the children, that Daddy had realized on his life insurance, that there was no fire insurance, and that there was a second mortgage on the house. He knew there was some delay about Daddy’s getting his new job, and he had already asked Sam to sell the strip of viny wilderness at Spa House alongside the dead end or at least build two garages there and rent them. With his money so low, Ernie found it next to impossible to sell his lead in dribs and drabs to get a few cents, but wanted to accumulate it, in order to get a fat sum at the end. If only his mother had allowed him to sell papers, he would have been happier. Meanwhile, Ernie’s lead was a standing joke, and even Henny grumbled perpetually about his “damnfool lead collection collecting dust and making rust marks on the cement floor, under his bed.” Sam wisely kept away from the washhouse while the children were showing their presents to Saul Pilgrim and, having nothing better to do, went into the boys’ room to smile to himself and also to step off the dimensions of a darkroom for photography that he proposed to build in one corner of it, near the kitchen sink, until such time as he could build in a bench and sink for the darkroom. He moved Ernie’s bed, and an astonishing sight met his eyes, five or six large lumps of lead, irregularly formed, and several small ones that seemed to have been hammered out of shape. He had not looked for several weeks and had no idea how Ernie had got so much. Beside the lead were the bottles and several pieces of iron. In moving the bed, he had upset a chamber pot, and the urine, with the sight of the lead and the rust marks on the floor, caused him to begin hallooing and howling for the children, in a great state of excitement, fun, and horror. Saul Pilgrim had to come in and see how his house was kept at eleven in the morning; and then Sam flung out of the room with him, until the mess was cleaned up, and then once outside he began to poh! and pooh! and fooey! and fwow! at the smells and sights, while the little boys stamped around giggling, and Ernie, the cause of all this, stood aside mournfully, until Sam called him “Glossy-eyes,” when he turned the corner, even more mournfully, and went down to poke a stick in the sand and write his name, “Ernest Paine Pollit.” On the beach their shouts still reached him, “Oh, fwow! What a pigsty!” and then commandment, “Goyls, clean up the stinking shop! It’s a pigsty! It’s a sump! It’s a garbage tip! Chicago is a violet farm by comparison,” then the boys giggling again, and a remark by Saul Pilgrim, and Henny shrieking out of a top window, “What’s the matter?” and Sam, actually replying to her, “Tell the dirty girls to clean up this pigsty of a house for once,” and Henny answering (all in the tops of the trees), “Ten maids couldn’t clean up after the filth you slop over the house every minute,” and Sam shouting, in a towering passion, “You look after my house and children, or I’ll get a separation,” and Henny yelling, “I couldn’t look after your child if I had ten hands and twenty eyes. Why don’t you stop her picking her nose?” (For Henny had had a row with Louie ten minutes ago.) After this came a calm, during which the girls, both bawling, cleaned up the room and stripped the beds to air, while Sam, in a low, sad voice, lectured the boys outside on female sluttishness, and told them the sort of wives they must pick. “When I saw my first baby was a girl,” continued Sam, pathetically, “I gave a whoop of joy, I wanted a little girl—”"|"The Man Who Loved Children"|"Christina Stead"

When they had been round once, Butch Brewer, looking in the pail, asked if he could take some home to his little brother, at which all the girls cried, “Ooh!” and shushed and giggled, themselves looking hungrily at the pails, while the Pollit children stood a little apart, somewhat grim, hoping there would be a bit left over for them after; but Sam at once made them all march round again and gave them all a lick-and-a-half, so that all was fair. …"|"The Man Who Loved Children"|"Christina Stead"

Louie, looking every minute from the front windows, saw her as soon as she came to the boathouse at the end of Duke of Gloucester Street, and shrieking, “Mother, she’s coming,” rushed madly round the house down the drive and along the street towards the bridge. At the gas station she slowed down, but too late, for her face was already scarlet. She had left behind her a pandemonium of brotherly laughs, fatherly witticisms, wondering children, staring neighbors and barking dogs, but when she reached the Eastport end of the bridge and looked towards Spa House, for one minute, to see the flag, she saw all her family, except Henny, lined up along the front grass, staring eagerly at the bridge. Very self-consciously she strutted along the bridge, looking everywhere, up, down, at Bancroft Hall, up the creek, at the boathouse, at the ferry, while the fat grin on her face swelled and swelled until she felt as if she must tumble into her own mouth.

She came into the silent playground and went straight to the class that was being held at this hour, which happened to be Miss Aiden’s, not observing, still, how the few girls who passed her stared at her. She came slowly into the class, while Miss Aiden and all the pupils stared at her. Her dirty blouse, which lacked buttons, was open and showed a torn slip and foul underwear; her skirt, spotted with food, had a ripped hem at the bottom; she was slipshod, and her stockings had mud on them.

It was a to-and-fro all the time, with the children simmering and carrying messages to each other and to their father, and Henny coming out to find out what was that horrible smell and was it going on all night. The boiling water was now covered with large oil spots and scum, which they occasionally ladled off into the available enamel hand basins and the kitchen pail; long tubes of steam went off, and the air in the washhouse was palpable. Henny was walking through the house now, wringing her hands on her skirts and saying she would never get the smell out of the house."|"The Man Who Loved Children"|"Christina Stead"

"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"The sun had come out hot again; and the house settled down to a needed siesta, by which time the heavy reek of fish oil rose up, swirled quietly round, and invaded the timbers of the house. One marlin had been enough, with their kneading, manuring, trotting about, plastering, oiling, and dripping, to give Spa House a scent of its own for many years to come. When they were all resting, prior to the four o’clock snack, Henny came downstairs in one of her silk dressing gowns, to look round. At least they had cleaned the copper, and perhaps it was imagination when she thought she smelled it in everything. On the shelf in the washhouse were bottles neatly labeled in Sam’s capitals: FISH-FRY, BIKE-OIL, MARLIN-BALM, MACHINE-OIL, HAIR-OIL, LEATHER-GREASE; OIL, OIL, OIL on the rest. When she went back upstairs, she was conscious of the rich rotten smell and the softness of it in her hair; there was a faint mark already on the pillow where she had lain and a greasy finger mark on the library book. She lifted her old slippers and smelled it on their sodden soles; there was a dark mark on the light gray silk hem. Just when she had reached this point in her examination, Evie came panting up the stairs, holding a little medicine bottle in her hand."|"The Man Who Loved Children"|"Christina Stead"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"She shook him off and said nothing. Sam went on talking to her gently, chidingly, lovingly. When they reached home, she made him another cup of coffee and went upstairs. Out of the old redwood box she took an old-fashioned bag made of grass and raffia, and embroidered in beads by her mother, at one time. Into this she put a few clothes and a dollar bill that one of the visitors had given her after Henny’s death. She hardly slept at all, but when she heard Sam begin his whistling early the next morning, she got up and dressed quickly and quietly. She heard the warm, old, jolly, pulsating home life beginning its round: “Little-Womey, Philohela minor! Git up, git up!” It was only six o’clock, and the boys were still drowsily groaning and rubbing their heads on their pillows. She heard Evie grumbling in her bed and dragging herself out of it and Sam thumping on the wall: “You, Gemini, hey, you Navel Academy, what’s about your early-morning swim?” She expertly got downstairs and to the kitchen with her satchel. Once there, she banged the kettle about to sound as if she were making the tea, and heard Evie’s grumble, “Looloo’s making it,” and, taking some food out of the icebox (she was always hungry), she ran out of the house and in no time was screened by the trees and bushes of the avenue. She smiled, felt light as a dolphin undulating through the waves, one of those beautiful, large, sleek marine mammals that plunged and wallowed, with their clever eyes. As she crossed the bridge (looking back and seeing none of the Navel Academy as yet on their little beach, or scrambling down the sodden bluff), she heaved a great breath. How different everything looked, like the morning of the world, that hour before all other hours which Thoreau speaks of, that most matinal hour. “Why didn’t I run away before?” she wondered. She wondered why everyone didn’t run away. Things certainly looked different: they were no longer part of herself but objects that she could freely consider without prejudice."|"The Man Who Loved Children"|"Christina Stead"
"~ 03:00"|"about three o’clock in the morning"|"On Sunday morning the sun bolted up brash and chipper from the salad beds of the Atlantic and with a red complexion came loping towards them over the big fishing hole of the Chesapeake. Before it was light the dooryard thrush began to drop his song, quirt-quirt, hesitant, fretful, inquiring, angelically solitary, from the old elm across the street. Sam whistled to him and then nestlings fluttered, a beast fell to the ground, the early birds got to work, and presently, by hearty creaking and concerted peeping, they and Sam made the sky pale and flagged the daystar. Sam was always anxious for morning. He was greedy for the daylight world, because the fevers of the dark, and the creatures real to man’s sixth, inward, dark sense, which palpitates in such an agony about three o’clock in the morning, all disappeared at the dark’s first fading. When the first ray came, he stood on feet of clay in a world of clay; the dread other worlds of dreams were gone beyond comparison. In these fresh summer mornings (it was fresh on the hill) when the earth perspired profusely, Sam would often get up before daybreak, patter downstairs in bare feet, just wearing bathing pants, and would go out on to the lawn, getting ready for some job, getting the animals up, or standing under the trees, whistling to the birds. But not today, because he had stayed awake most of the night."|"The Man Who Loved Children"|"Christina Stead"

He must have had his mother-in-law staying with him. This one would frighten a screech owl at midnight on Bear Mountain. The question is, how bare? Mwsk! Oh, raccoons and rattlesnakes! This one knocks my eyes out! I only got one eye. I can’t stand it. I must marry her at once and get back my eye.”"|"The Man Who Loved Children"|"Christina Stead"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"Bonnie came running in, her eyes shining. She sat down and bubbled over before she had even sat down, “Oh, I had the funniest dream: I dreamed I was a lumberjack, and we were hauling in the savannas: I had seven elephants—or was it nine?” She paused anxiously and looked round the table. “No, nine, because the ninth fell in the mud—a sort of morass—and we were hauling and pulling away for dear life to get it out. Can you imagine anything more ridiculous, me seated on an elephant’s neck? Isn’t it silly, what you dream?”"|"The Man Who Loved Children"|"Christina Stead"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"Little-Sam yelled out above the blowing, “Is that Loolook? Soon time for alevena, Loolook!” Alevena was the eleven o’clock meal, with tea, sandwiches, and fruit, which all the children shared. They had either bananas cut up on bread or sirup-and-butter on bread. Louie hurried down to get it ready. Meantime a wonderful smell of roasting meat and cooking pastry streamed out of the kitchen, and there was in it the smell of slightly roasted linen. Bonnie was ironing blouses for her sister-in-law and herself for the afternoon. Just as Louie had got to the last three steps and had stopped to stare out at the wan, withered, and flourishing world, seen through the blue, yellow, and green panes of the pointed hall window, and at the fire-bellied newts in the aquarium, Henny’s raucous shout came from the kitchen,"|"The Man Who Loved Children"|"Christina Stead"
"ap 07:30"|seven-thirty|"In between the Walkers’ small lot and Middenways’, the corner grocers, on a lot of the same size, was a similar wooden house, neglected and vine-grown, in which lived an old couple, John and Angela Kydd. John Kydd made toys and, to show it, had two rocking-horse heads on his gate. He left promptly at seven-thirty every morning and returned rotating on his fat legs at six every evening. In between these hours the lonely and scared old woman would often call in Louisa, who was such a big, brave girl, to keep her company. Louisa did not care for either place; they offered her nothing to eat and they reeked of eccentricity; but Junius Walker took pains to explain to her things that no one else had mentioned, ceramics, glazes, firing, and offered to teach her china painting, and as for the Kydds, no one in the neighborhood but herself had ever been invited into the frowsy, furniture-choked dwelling. Sam, always lampooning, found the Kydds and the Walkers inexhaustible sources of inspiration: every day he found new jokes about the two eccentrics. Though Louie knew them much better than he did, she saw them with his eyes, as ridiculous if not positively touched, filthy and mean-spirited to be so poor, vain to have airs and graces when so poor, superstitious to hold any religious beliefs, thickheaded to hold any political beliefs, hoity-toity to hold any esthetic beliefs, fustian to pretend to any education, when so poor. But Louie never said what was in her head and she had a kind heart; so she came down, with bare legs, and in her faded, dirty, outgrown dress, in torn underwear from her fine house on the hill, and listened for hours to the notions that these strange poor folk had about themselves. She felt at home with them. She was eccentric, ugly, and awkward, and they were quite evidently, in their lives, eccentric, ugly, and awkward. Sam had a voice, she had an ear, and these struggling, poor people, gasping just at the surface of the river, about to sink, had lives. They told her something about their lives, which were not cataclysmic, such as Pollitry lived, but lives lived in neat corpuscles, lives which only looked out, squinted-eyed, askance, dubious, through two fishy eyes. The Walkers and Kydds repelled Louie, but she was flattered that they chose her. Ernie knew all the men and women; Evie visited all the “ladies with babies,” as she said, and Tommy was dangerously favored: only the two oddities wanted Louie."|"The Man Who Loved Children"|"Christina Stead"
"ap 01:15"|one-fifteen|"Henny went upstairs when she came to the bar and restaurant near Twelfth Street and was glad to see that it was after one already. Bert would be there promptly at one-fifteen. She fiddled with the table silver and the menu, wished she had dawdled longer, muttered, “But I feel too conspicuous parading up and down the streets smirking nicely at mothers with children: and I might run into one of the Commissioner’s fine friends, too. Bert is never late.”"|"The Man Who Loved Children"|"Christina Stead"
15:00|"THREE IN THE afternoon"|"AT THREE IN THE afternoon Aunt Josephine Pollit, tall, blue-eyed, with hail-fellow-well-met dental set came through the gate at a lively pace, though she was putting on a hearty middle age. She carried herself as if she were a yellow solid valise cheerfully borne by a successful commercial traveler. She carried other things with her, a light coat, an umbrella, a purse, a book, and a package. When the twins came flying down the path, she shifted the parcel to the other hand and patted them while kissing them heartily."|"The Man Who Loved Children"|"Christina Stead"

I’m going to get a loan to put in improvements—but what’s the use really? I ought to lease it to a boardinghouse keeper who would give me my rents regularly and I shouldn’t have to worry. It all keeps me awake and I can’t afford to lose sleep over a lot of irresponsible people. That old woman with the rosary on her bed only comes once a fortnight to get her relief, or when she had a fight with her son-in-law. That nice German, such a decent fellow and a good tenant, is going to his homeland to see his parents. Such a studious man, nice and quiet; and those two awful Italians didn’t work for four days. They went out on a beer party and got stinking drunk and didn’t work. My house is simply going down, and I haven’t time to do it up, put them out, and get decent tenants.

It makes me sick, such shiftless horrible people in the world, and they are the ones the government supports! Can you understand it, Sam? I can’t. And in the house next to mine is a woman with a piece of land in the country, who gets relief. Isn’t it wicked, Sam? Oh, you don’t know what’s going on, Sam, because you’re in a government department and you don’t meet people as I do. I have to meet them face to face, I have to actually speak to these awful creatures, because they are my tenants, and I have to worry about the plumbing for them. Do you think they’re pleased with anything? No, you don’t know a lot yourself, Sam. That’s what I say. Don’t throw it up at me that I’m not married; for I could easily have been married, but I just said, ‘No, no, I’m waiting for Mr. Right.’ What do you think of that, Sam?
