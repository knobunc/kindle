The first example shows how difficult it is to demonstrate a cause in the real physical world, because tiny events can have tremendous outcomes. The second shows how, in our cultural world, small events – or the absence of such events – can take over a social universe and bias it away from the desirable outcome. Finally, we’ll show how meddling by humans can completely change biological systems – and we’re not thinking of dodos."|"Judgement Day"|"Terry Pratchett"
