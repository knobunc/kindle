00:00|midnight|"Cynric thought about this for a moment, twisting the ring on his little finger. Then a curious light of comprehension dawned in his face. He said, gazing intently at Gaius, ""Do ravens fly at midnight?"""|"The Forest House"|"Marion Zimmer Bradley"
00:00|midnight|"""Still, there is an element of rebellion,"" he said. ""You don't see it, placed as you are; I don't see it much, living among Romans as I've done for so long. But it's my business to watch the winds. To see signs and omens. For instance - where ravens fly at midnight; I speak of the secret society that worships the Lady of Battles."""|"The Forest House"|"Marion Zimmer Bradley"
12:00|noon|"At noon Rheis gathered her family together beneath a spreading oak tree at the base of the hill for some cold meat and bread. The old hillfort was the focus for many pathways. From here they could see a broad and well-tended way that ran westward, lined with stately oak trees. At its very end the thatched roofs of the Forest House and its outbuildings showed pale against the deep green of the Sacred Grove."|"The Forest House"|"Marion Zimmer Bradley"
"< 00:00"|"near midnight"|"Ishould take her now, thought Gaius, then they would have to let us marry! He was about to pull her closer when a shape passed between them and the light. The space around the bonfires was filling with people. A glance at the stars told him that it was near midnight, and the moon was high. Where had the hours gone? Eilan exclaimed softly and started to get to her feet."|"The Forest House"|"Marion Zimmer Bradley"
00:00|midnight|"Silver bells shivered sweetly and the tension in the circle grew. Gaius blinked, but he could see nothing, and yet there was something moving, a mass of shadow that swept towards them. Abruptly he realized that he was seeing women's shapes swathed in draperies of a blue like midnight. They flowed into the circle and around it, silver ornaments jingling faintly, faces a pale blur beneath the veils."|"The Forest House"|"Marion Zimmer Bradley"
00:00|midnight|"""On the run . . ."" Cynric said thoughtfully. ""Why are you asking me?""
""Because they say he was one of those who fly at midnight —""
""Many birds fly at midnight."" Cynric gazed into his wine. ""What was the man's name?"""|"The Forest House"|"Marion Zimmer Bradley"

"> 13:00"|"an hour after noon"|"""Why not?"" Cynric grinned. ""I've never seen any reason to keep the priestesses all penned up. That's like something you Romans would do. Dieda won't see or speak to me since she went in there, but my foster sister is not a prisoner. I will see what I can arrange for you."" He drained his wine cup. ""Be at the edge of the path leading to the Forest House three days from now, an hour after noon."""|"The Forest House"|"Marion Zimmer Bradley"
00:00|midnight|"The last image was of a hill of knobbed granite where the purple heather grew. Chill winds swept eastward from the sea, scouring the rolling fields. In this windswept place real trees grew only along the strait where the island fronted the grim bulk of the mainland. Even as she realized that she was seeing Mona, the scene changed, and Eilan saw men of her own race clad in white, and women in robes of midnight blue, their faces grim as they piled wood into great pyres."|"The Forest House"|"Marion Zimmer Bradley"
12:00|noon|"""There is fresh oat bread that I baked this morning,"" she said. ""Sit here and join me in my noon meal —"" She hesitated. ""— unless you feel that I contaminate you by my forsworn presence?"""|"The Forest House"|"Marion Zimmer Bradley"
12:00|noon|"The sight of the haruspex who had been called in to take the auspices for the marriage did nothing to improve his mood. In the noon sunlight the man's bald red head and long skinny legs made him look like one of his own chickens and Gaius was cynically certain that whatever spots he found on the entrails of the unfortunate fowl would indicate it was an auspicious day. With most of the dignitaries of Londinium standing about it would be exce1edingly inconvenient to cancel the festivities. In any case, the augurs had already been consulted weeks ago to select the proper day."|"The Forest House"|"Marion Zimmer Bradley"
00:00|midnight|"""Ravens fly at midnight as well,"" she answered. ""What have you to say to me?"""|"The Forest House"|"Marion Zimmer Bradley"
12:00|noon|"It was almost time for the noon recess before Gaius was beckoned forward to read Licinius's report on the finances of Britannia. There were a few questions, mostly on the subject of resources, and one from Clodius Malleus that allowed Gaius to mention the part he had played in controlling the latest rebellion. Despite some recent tutoring in oratory, he felt he must have bored them, but at the end of his speech, they voted him a perfunctory round of applause and - as Licinius had foreseen - confirmed that for the next year a reasonable percentage of the tax money they had collected might be retained in Britain. Since this was why Licinius had sent him in the first place, Gaius was hardly surprised."|"The Forest House"|"Marion Zimmer Bradley"
12:00|noon|"""That they are not!"" Old Lydia, who ran the nursery, replied. ""The twins are eating their noon meal, and Cella is helping the cook make pies. But Secunda is just at that age when if they are unwatched they will go exploring —"""|"The Forest House"|"Marion Zimmer Bradley"
"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"""Your father said you would probably arrive before noon,"" said the soldier. ""You'll find him with the Legate in the Praetorium."""|"The Forest House"|"Marion Zimmer Bradley"
12:00|noon|"It was noon before they returned, flushed and chattering and crowned with flowers.1 ""Caillean is waiting for you in the garden,"" said Eilidh as Eilan came in. ""She has been sitting there all morning. She would not even come in to eat breakfast, but she assures us that nothing is wrong."""|"The Forest House"|"Marion Zimmer Bradley"
