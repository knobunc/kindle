   week with the same names as ours, and re-naming the others in order. It must be noted, however, that the associations of the
   names were quite different in the Shire. The last day of the week, Friday (Highday), was the chief day, and one of holiday

   shrewd questions, and all the while conscious of Gandalf at his side, watching and listening, and (so Pippin felt) holding
   in check a rising wrath and impatience. When the hour was over and Denethor again rang the gong, Pippin felt worn out. ‘It
   cannot be more than nine o’clock,’ he thought. ‘I could now eat three breakfasts on end.’"|"The Return of the King"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"

   in the Citadel, and with greater honour. This is a fortress and a tower of guard and is now in posture of war. We rise ere
   the Sun, and take a morsel in the grey light, and go to our duties at the opening hour. But do not despair!’ He laughed again,
   seeing the dismay in Pippin’s face. ‘Those who have had heavy duty take somewhat to refresh their strength in the mid-morning. Then there is the nuncheon, at noon or after as duties allow;

   ‘There go the last of the wains that bear away to refuge the aged, the children, and the women that must go with them. They
   must all be gone from the Gate and the road clear for a league before noon: that was the order. It is a sad necessity.’ He
   sighed. ‘Few, maybe, of those now sundered will meet again. And there were always too few children 
   in this city; but now there are none – save some young lads that will not depart, and may find some task to do: my own son
   is one of them.’"|"The Return of the King"|"J. R. R. Tolkien"

   March in the Shire-reckoning, and even now Aragorn was leading the black fleet from Pelargir, and Merry was riding with the
   Rohirrim down the Stonewain Valley, while in Minas Tirith flames were rising and Pippin watched the madness growing in the
   eyes of Denethor. Yet amid all their cares and fear the thoughts of their friends turned constantly to Frodo and Sam. They

   that had not been scrubbed for weeks. The food deserved no better setting. The travellers were glad to leave the place. It
   was about eighteen miles to Bywater, and they set off at ten o’clock in the morning. They would have started earlier, only
   the delay so plainly annoyed the Shirriff-leader. The west wind had shifted northward and it was turning colder, but the rain

   at their losses, from slaying those of their enemies who threw down their weapons. When the fighting was over, and the later
   labours were ordered, Merry, Pippin, and Sam joined him, and they rode back with the Cottons. They ate a late midday meal,

   broken gate, and passed the mounds of the fallen on the greensward beside the road, until they stood on Helm’s Dike and looked
   into the Coomb. The Death Down already stood there, black and tall and stony, and the great trampling and scoring of the grass
   by the Huorns could be plainly seen. The Dunlendings and many men of the garrison of the Burg were at work on the Dike or
   in the fields and about the battered walls behind; yet all seemed strangely quiet: a weary valley resting after a great storm.
