"~ 03:00"|"Around three in the morning"|"Around three in the morning, when she could tell from her husband’s deep breathing that he was asleep, Psyche slipped out on her side of the bed. She retrieved the razor and lamp from her nightstand drawer. She lit the wick so a dim red glow spilled across the sheets."|"Percy Jackson and the Greek Heroes"|"Rick Riordan"
"~ 03:00"|"about three in the morning"|"Phaethon arrived at about three in the morning. Even in the pre-dawn darkness, he had to put on his sunglasses to deal with the blazing light of the palace. The parapets glowed like molten gold. Flames encircled the Celestial bronze columns that lined the facade. Etched on the silver gates – designed by Hephaestus himself – were scenes of mortal life that moved like video images."|"Percy Jackson and the Greek Heroes"|"Rick Riordan"
"ap 00:00"|"12:00 P.M."|"In another corner stood a whole crowd of guys in matching blue overalls with different times painted on their backs – 12:00 P.M., 1:00 A.M., 4:00 P.M. – and the words SCRUB TUB. Phaethon guessed they were the gods of the hours."|"Percy Jackson and the Greek Heroes"|"Rick Riordan"

14:00|"two p.m."|"Yeah, every hour of the day had a minor god. Can you imagine being the god of two p.m.? All the schoolkids would hate you. They’d be like, Can it please be three thirty? I wanna go home!"|"Percy Jackson and the Greek Heroes"|"Rick Riordan"

"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"Helios felt trapped – worse than the time he blew a wheel at four o’clock and was stuck waiting for roadside assistance in the middle of the afternoon sky. ‘Phaethon, okay, I promised. I can’t back out. But I can try to talk some sense into you. This is a bad idea. If there was a god of bad ideas, he’d paint “letting a mortal drive the sun chariot” on his shield, because it’s the ultimate bad idea.’"|"Percy Jackson and the Greek Heroes"|"Rick Riordan"
06:00|"six a.m."|"The folks down on the earth must have noticed, though. They woke up at, like, six a.m. Twenty minutes later it was lunchtime."|"Percy Jackson and the Greek Heroes"|"Rick Riordan"

"ap 02:20"|"third after two"|"Meanwhile, back in Mycenae, Cousin Sthenelus was still trying to become the high king. He thought he’d be a shoo-in with Amphitryon in exile, but nobody liked Sthenelus. He was cruel and cowardly. Besides, his name was super hard to pronounce. The nobles refused to endorse him. The commoners jeered at him. Sthenelus tried to settle the matter with a public vote, but he came in third after two write-in candidates: Mickey Mouse and Fluffy the town cat."|"Percy Jackson and the Greek Heroes"|"Rick Riordan"
12:00|noon|"Hercules was strong and tireless. By noon, he had dug a deep trench from the north end of the sheds to the upper bank of the river, leaving only a thin retaining wall to keep the water from flowing in. He spent the rest of the day digging another trench from the south end of the sheds to the bottom of Alpheus’s C-shaped curve, where the river flowed out of town. Again Hercules left just enough earth in place to keep the water from seeping into the trench."|"Percy Jackson and the Greek Heroes"|"Rick Riordan"
"ap 00:10"|fifty-to-one|"It was fifty-to-one. The guards never stood a chance. Hercules tossed them one by one into the stables, giving the horses a fifty-course meal of Thracian warriors."|"Percy Jackson and the Greek Heroes"|"Rick Riordan"
"~ 02:00"|"around two in the morning"|"At around two in the morning, Jason and his advisers were still awake having a strategy meeting. They’d seen those fiery bulls, and the Argonauts were trying to figure out a way to beat Aeetes’s challenge without Jason being burned alive. So far, their best plan involved three thousand bags of ice and a large pair of cooking mitts. It wasn’t a very good plan."|"Percy Jackson and the Greek Heroes"|"Rick Riordan"
12:00|noon|"The bulls blew flames at the sky. They pulled the huge plough blade across the earth, making a furrow. Smoke billowed around Jason. Sparks flew in his eyes. He felt like he was driving a steam train while standing inside the boiler, but somehow he managed to seed the dragon’s teeth into the furrows. By noon, the entire field was ploughed. Jason still wasn’t dead. He parked the bulls, tied them to the post and decided to take a water break. The Argonauts cheered wildly."|"Percy Jackson and the Greek Heroes"|"Rick Riordan"
00:00|midnight|"By midnight, most of the Argonauts had returned to the ship in secret, leaving their campfires burning to fool the city watch. Jason stood in his command tent, packing his stuff, when Medea arrived with Aeetes’s four grandchildren."|"Percy Jackson and the Greek Heroes"|"Rick Riordan"
