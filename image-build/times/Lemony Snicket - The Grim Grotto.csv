"ap 01:00"|One|"A Series of Unfortunate Events 11 - The Grim Grotto     “A noble organization?” the hook-handed man said. “Is that so? Tell that to your baby sister, you four-eyed fool! If it weren't for Volatile Fungus Deportation, you never would have encountered those deadly mushrooms!”     The children looked at one another, remembering what they had read in the Gorgonian Grotto. They had to admit that Olaf's henchman was right. But Violet reached into her pocket and drew out the newspaper clipping Sunny had found in the cave. She held it out so everyone could see the Daily Punctilio article that the eldest Baudelaire had kept hidden for so long.     “ 'VERIFYING FERNALD'S DEFECTION,' ” she said, reading the headline out loud, and then continued by reading the byline, a word which here means “name of the person who wrote the article.”     “By Jacques Snicket. It has now been confirmed that the fire that destroyed Anwhistle Aquatics, and took the life of famed ichnologist Gregor Anwhistle, was set by Fernald Widdershins, the son of the captain of the Queequeg submarine. The Widdershins family's participation in a recent schism has raised several questions regarding...” Violet looked up and met the glare of Olaf's henchman. “The rest of the article is blurry,” she said, “but the truth is clear. You defected – you abandoned V.F.D. and joined up with Olaf!”     “The difference between the two sides of the schism,” Klaus said, “is that one side puts out fires, and the other starts them.” The hook-handed man reached forward and speared the article on one of his hooks, and then turned the clipping around so he could read it again. “You should have seen the fire,” he said quietly. “From a distance, it looked like an enormous black plume of smoke, rising straight out of the water. It was like the entire sea was burning down.”     “You must have been proud of your handiwork,” Fiona said bitterly.     “Proud?” the hook-handed man said. “It was the worst day of my life. That plume of smoke was the saddest thing I ever saw.” He speared the newspaper with his other hook and ripped the article into shreds. “The Punctilio got everything wrong,” he said. “Captain Widdershins isn't my father. Widdershins isn't my last name. And there's much more to the fire than that. You should know that the Daily Punctilio doesn't tell the whole story, Baudelaires. Just as the poison of a deadly fungus can be the source of some wonderful medicines, someone like Jacques Snicket can do something villainous, and someone like Count Olaf can do something noble. Even your parents –”     “Our stepfather knew Jacques Snicket,” Fiona said. “He was a good man, but Count Olaf murdered him. Are you a murderer, too? Did you kill Gregor Anwhistle?”     In grim silence, the hook-handed man held his hooks in front of the children.      “The last time you saw me,” he said to Fiona, “I had two hands, instead of hooks. Our stepfather probably didn't tell you what happened to me – he always said there were secrets in this world too terrible for young people to know. What a fool!”     “Our stepfather isn't a fool,” Fiona said. “He's a noble man. Aye!”     “People aren't either wicked or noble,” the hook-handed man said. “They're like chef's salads, with good things and bad things chopped and mixed together in a vinaigrette of confusion and conflict.” He turned to the two elder Baudelaires and pointed at them with his hooks. “Look at yourselves, Baudelaires. Do you really think we're so different? When those eagles carried me away from the mountains in that net, I saw the ruins of that fire in the hinterlands – a fire we started together. You've burned things down, and so have I. You joined the crew of the Queequeg , and I joined the crew of the Carmelita . Our captains are both volatile people, and we're both trying to get to the Hotel Denouement before Thursday. The only difference between us is the portraits on our uniforms.”     “We're wearing Herman Melville,” Klaus said. “He was a writer of enormous talent who dramatized the plight of overlooked people, such as poor sailors or exploited youngsters, through his strange, often experimental philosophical prose. I'm proud to display his portrait. But you're wearing Edgar Guest. He was a writer of limited skill, who wrote awkward, tedious poetry on hopelessly sentimental topics. You ought to be ashamed of yourself.”     “Edgar Guest isn't my favorite poet,” the hook-handed man admitted. “Before I joined up with Count Olaf, I was studying poetry with my stepfather. We used to read to one another in the Main Hall of the Queequeg . But it's too late now. I can't return to my old life.”     “Maybe not,” Klaus said. “But you can return us to the Queequeg , so we can save Sunny.”     “Please,” the children heard Sunny say, from inside the helmet, although her voice was quite hoarse, as if she would not be able to speak for much longer, and for a moment the only sound in the brig was Sunny's desperate coughing as the minutes in her crucial hour ticked away, and the muttering of the hook-handed man as he paced back and forth, twiddling his hooks in thought.     Violet and Klaus watched his hooks, and thought of all the times he had used them to threaten the siblings. It is one thing to believe that people have both good and bad inside them, mixed together like ingredients in a salad bowl. But it is quite another to look at a cohort of a despicable villain, who has tried again and again to cause so much harm, and try to see where the good parts are buried, when all you can remember is the pain and suffering he has caused. As the hook-handed man circled the brig, it was as if the Baudelaires were picking through a chef's salad consisting mostly of dreadful – and perhaps even poisonous – ingredients, trying desperately to find the one noble crouton that might save their sister, just as I, between paragraphs, am picking through this salad in front of me, hoping that my waiter is more noble than wicked, and that my sister, Kit, might be saved by the small, herbed piece of toast I hope to retrieve from my bowl. After much hemming and hawing, however – a phrase which here means “muttering, and clearing of one's throat, used to avoid making a quick decision ” – Count Olaf's henchman stopped in front of the children, put his hooks on his hips, and offered them a Hobson's choice.     “I'll return you to the Queequeg ,” he said, “if you take me with you.”













C H A P T E REleven     “I'm so glad,” the hook-handed man said, giving the two siblings a smile they found inscrutable, a word which here means “either pleasant or nasty, but it was hard to tell.”     “I have lots of ideas about where we could go after we get off the Carmelita.”     “Well, I'd certainly like to hear them,” Fiona said. “Aye!”     “Perhaps we could discuss such things later,” Violet said. “I don't think now is a good time to hesitate.”     “Aye!” Fiona said. “She who hesitates is lost!”     “Or he,” Klaus reminded her. “We've got to get to the Queequeg right away.”     The hook-handed man opened the door of the brig and looked up and down the corridor. “This will be tricky,” he said, beckoning to the children with one of his hooks. “The only way back to the Queequeg is through the rowing room, but that room is filled with children we've kidnapped. Esmé took my tagliatelle grande and is whipping them so they'll row faster.”     The elder Baudelaires did not bother to point out that the hook-handed man had threatened the Baudelaires with the very same noodle, when the children had worked at Caligari Carnival, along with a few other individuals who had ended up joining Olaf's troupe.     “Is there any way to sneak past them?” Violet asked.     “We'll see,” Olaf's henchman said. “Follow me.” The hook-handed man strode quickly down the empty corridor, with Fiona behind him and the two Baudelaires behind her, carrying the diving helmet in which Sunny still coughed. Violet and Klaus purposefully lagged behind so they might have a word with the mycologist.     “Fiona, are you sure you want to take him with us?” Klaus asked, leaning in close to murmur in her ear. “He's a very dangerous and volatile man.”     “He's my brother,” Fiona replied in a fierce whisper, ""and I'm your captain. Aye! I'm in charge of the Queequeg . So I get to choose its crew.     “We know that,” Violet said, “but we just thought you might want to reconsider.”     “Never,” Fiona said firmly. “With my stepfather gone, Fernald may be the only person I have left in my family. Would you ask me to abandon my own sibling?”     As if replying, Sunny coughed desperately from inside her helmet, and the elder Baudelaires knew that Fiona was right. “Of course we wouldn't,” Klaus said.     “Stop muttering back there,” the hook-handed man ordered, as he led the children around another twist in the corridor. “We're approaching the rowing room, and we don't want anyone to hear us.”     The children stopped talking, but as the henchman stopped at the door to the rowing room, and held his hook over an eye on the wall which would open the door, Violet and Klaus could hear that there was no reason to be quiet. Even through the thick metal of the rowing room entrance, they could hear the loud, piercing voice of Carmelita Spats.     “For my third dance,” she was saying, “I will twirl around and around while all of you clap as hard as you can. It is a dance of celebration, in honor of the most adorable tap-dancing ballerina fairy princess veterinarian in the world!”     “Please, Carmelita,” begged the voice of a child. “We've been rowing for hours. Our hands are too sore to clap.” There was a faint, damp sound, like someone dropping a washcloth, and the elder Baudelaires realized that Esmé was whipping the children with her enormous noodle.     “You will participate in Carmelita's recital,” the treacherous girlfriend announced, “or you will suffer the sting of my tagliatelle grande! Ha ha hoity-toity!”     “It's not really a sting,” said one brave child. “It's more of a mild, wet slap.”     “Shut up, cakesniffer!” Carmelita ordered, and the children heard the rustle of her pink tutu as she began to twirl. “Start clapping!” she shrieked, and then the children heard a sound they had never heard before.     There is nothing wicked about having a dreadful singing voice, any more than there is something wicked about having dreadful posture, dreadful cousins, or a dreadful pair of pants. Many noble and pleasant people have any number of these things, and there are even one or two kind individuals who have them all. But if you have something dreadful, and you force it upon someone else, then you have done something quite wicked indeed. If you force your wicked posture on someone, for instance, by leaning so far back that they are forced to carry you down the street, then you have wickedly ruined their afternoon walk, and if you force your dreadful cousins on someone, by dropping them off to play at their house so you can escape from their dreadful presences and spend some time alone, then you have wickedly ruined their entire day, and only a very wicked person indeed would force a dreadful pair of pants on the legs and lower torso of somebody else. But to force your dreadful singing voice on somebody, or even a crowd of people, is one of the world's most wicked crimes, and at that moment Carmelita Spats opened her mouth and afflicted the crew of the Carmelita with her wickedness. Carmelita's singing voice was loud, like a siren, and high-pitched, like a squeaky door, and extremely off-pitch, as if all of the notes in the musical scale were pushing up against one another, all trying to sound at the same time. Her singing voice was mushy, as if someone had filled her mouth with mashed potatoes before she sang, and filled with vibrato, which is the Italian term for a voice that wavers as it sings, as if someone were shaking Carmelita very vigorously as she began her song. Even the most dreadful of voices can be tolerated if it is performing a good song, but I'm sad to say that Carmelita Spats had written the song herself and that it was just as dreadful as her singing voice.     Violet and Klaus were reminded of Prufrock Preparatory School , where they had first met Carmelita. The vice principal of the school, a tedious man named Nero, forced his students to listen to him play the violin for hours, and they realized this administrator must have had a powerful influence on Carmelita's creativity.     “C is for 'cute,' ” Carmelita sang, “A is for 'adorable'! R is for 'ravishing'! M is for 'gorgeous'! E is for 'excellent'! L is for 'lovable'! I is for 'I'm the best'! T is for 'talented'! and A is for 'a tap-dancing ballerina fairy princess veterinarian'! Now let's begin my whole wonderful song all over again!” The song was so irritating, and sting so poorly, that Violet and Klaus almost felt as if they were being tortured after all, particularly as Carmelita kept on singing it, over and over and over.     “I can't stand her voice,” Violet said. “It reminds me of the cawing of the V.F.D. crows.”     “I can't stand the lyrics,” Klaus said. “Someone needs to tell her that 'gorgeous' does not begin with the letter M.”     “I can't stand the brat,” the hook-handed man said bitterly. “She's one of the reasons I'd like to leave. But this sounds like as good a time as any to try to sneak through this room. There are plenty of pillars to hide behind, and if we walk around the very edge, where each oar sticks through the wall into the tentacles of the octopus, we should be able to get to the other door – assuming everybody is watching Carmelita 's tap-dancing ballerina fairy princess veterinarian dance recital.”     “That seems like a very risky plan,” Violet said.     “This is no time to be a coward,” the hook-handed man growled. “My sister is not a coward,” Klaus said. “She's just being cautious.”     “There's no time to be cautious!” Fiona said. “Aye! She who hesitates is lost! Aye! Or he! Let's go!”     Without another word, the hook-handed man poked the eye on the wall, and the door slid open to reveal the enormous room. As Olaf's comrade had predicted, the rowing children were all facing Carmelita, who was prancing and singing on one side of the room while Esmé watched with a proud smile on her face and a large noodle in one of her tentacles. With the hook-handed man and Fiona in the lead, the three Baudelaires – Sunny still in the diving helmet, of course – made their careful way around the outside of the room as Carmelita twirled around singing her absurd song.     When Carmelita announced what C was for, the children ducked behind one of the pillars. When she told her listeners the meaning of A and R, the children crept past the moving oars, taking care not to trip. When she insisted that “gorgeous ” began with M, Count Olaf's henchman pointed one of his hooks at a far door, and when Carmelita reached E and L, the children ducked behind another pillar, hoping the dim light of the lanterns would not give them away. When Carmelita announced that she was the best, and bragged about being talented, Esmé Squalor frowned and turned around, blinking underneath the fake eyes of her octopus outfit, and the children had to flatten themselves on the floor so the villainous girlfriend would not spot them, and when the tap-dancing ballerina fairy princess veterinarian found it necessary to remind her audience that she was, in fact, a tap-dancing ballerina fairy princess veterinarian, the two elder Baudelaires found themselves ahead of Fiona and the hook-handed man, hiding behind a pillar that was just a few feet from their destination.     They were just about to inch their way toward the door when Carmelita began belting out the last line of her song – “belting out” is a phrase which here means “singing in a particularly loud and particularly irritating voice” – only to stop herself just as she was about to begin her whole wonderful song all over again.     “C is for – cakesniffers!” she shouted. “What are you doing here?” Violet and Klaus froze, and then saw with relief that the terrible little girl was pointing scornfully at Fiona and the hook-handed man, who were standing awkwardly between two oars.     “How dare you, Hooky?” Esmé said, fingering her large noodle as if she wanted to strike him with it. “You're interrupting a very in recital by an unspeakably darling little girl!”     “I'm very sorry, your Esméness,” the hook-handed man said, stepping forward to elaborately bow in front of the wicked girlfriend. “I would sooner lose both hands all over again than interrupt Carmelita when she's dancing.”     “But you did interrupt me, you handicapped cakesniffer!” Carmelita pouted. “Now I have to start the entire recital all over again!”     “No!” cried one of the rowing children. “Anything but that! It's torture!”     “Speaking of torture,” the hook-handed man said quickly, “I stopped by to see if I could borrow your tagliatelle grande. It'll help me get the Baudelaires to reveal the location of the sugar bowl.”     Esmé frowned, and fingered the noodle with one tentacle. “I don't really like to lend things,” she said. “It usually leads to people messing up my stuff.”     “Please, ma'am,” Fiona said. “We're so close to learning the location of the sugar bowl. Aye! We just need to borrow your noodle, so we can return to the brig.”     “Why are you helping Hooky?” Esmé said. “I thought you were another goody-goody orphan.”     “Certainly not,” the hook-handed man said. “This is my sister, Fiona, and she's joining the crew of the Carmelita.”     “Fiona isn't a very in name,” Esmé said. “I think I'll call her Triangle Eyes. Are you really willing to join us, Triangle Eyes?”     “Aye!” Fiona said. “Those Baudelaires are nothing but trouble.”     “Why are you still talking?” demanded Carmelita. “This is supposed to be my special tap-dancing ballerina fairy princess veterinarian dance recital time!”     “Sorry, darling,” Esmé said. “Hooky and Triangle Eyes, take this noodle and scram!”     The hook-handed man and his sister walked to the center of the room and stood directly in front of Esmé and Carmelita, offering a perfect opportunity for the elder Baudelaires to scram, a rude word which here means “slip out of the room unnoticed and walk down the shadowy hallway Olaf had led them down just a little while earlier.”     “Do you think Fiona will join us?” Violet asked.     “I don't think so,” Klaus said. “They told Esmé they'd return to the brig, so they'll have to go back the way we came.”     “You don't think she's really joining Olaf's troupe, do you?” Violet said.    “Of course not,” Klaus said. “That was just to give us an opportunity to get out of the room. Fiona may be volatile, but she's not that volatile.”     “Of course not,” Violet said, though she didn't sound very sure.     “Of course not,” Klaus repeated, as another ragged cough came from inside the diving helmet. “Hang on, Sunny,” he called to his sister. “You'll be cured in no time!” Although he tried to sound as confident as he could, the middle Baudelaire had no way of knowing if his words were true – although, I'm happy to say, they were.     “How are you going to cure Sunny,” Violet said, “without Fiona?”     “We'll have to research it ourselves,” Klaus said firmly.     “We'll never read her entire mycological library in time to make an antidote,” Violet said.     “We don't have to read the entire library,” Klaus said, as they reached the door to the Queequeg's brig. “I know just where to look.”     Sunny coughed again, and then began to wheeze, a word which here means “make a hoarse, whistling sound indicating that her throat was almost completely closed up.” The elder Baudelaires could hardly stop themselves from opening the helmet: to comfort their sister, but they didn't want to risk getting poisoned themselves.     “I hope you're right,” Violet said, pressing a metal eye on the wall. The door slid open and the children hurried toward the broken porthole of the submarine.     “Sunny's hour must almost be up.” Klaus nodded grimly, and jumped through the porthole onto the large wooden table.     Although it had only been a short while since the children had left the Queequeg , the Main Hall felt as if it had been abandoned for years. The three balloons tied to the table legs were beginning to sag, the tidal charts Klaus had studied had fallen to the floor, and the glass circle Count Olaf had cut in the porthole still lay on the floor. But the middle Baudelaire ignored all of these objects, and picked up Mushroom Minutiae from the floor.     “This book should have information on the antidote,” he said, and turned immediately to the table of contents as Violet carried Sunny through the porthole into the submarine. “Chapter Thirty-Six, The Yeast of Beasts. Chapter Thirty-Seven, Morel Behavior in a Free Society. Chapter Thirty-Eight, Fungible Mold, Moldable Fungi. Chapter Thirty-Nine, Visitable Fungal Ditches. Chapter Forty, The Gorgonian Grotto.”     “That's it!” Violet said. “Chapter Forty.”     Klaus flipped pages as Sunny gave another desperate wheeze, although I wish the middle Baudelaire could have had the time to return to some of those pages he flipped past. “ 'The Gorgonian Grotto,' ” he read, “ 'located in propinquity to Anwhistle Aquatics, has appropriately wraithlike nomenclature –' ”     “We know all that,”' Violet said hurriedly. “Skip to the part about the mycelium.”     Klaus's eyes scanned the page easily, having had much practice in skipping the parts of books he found less than helpful. “ 'The Medusoid Mycelium has a unique conducive strategy of, waxing –' ”     “And waning,” interrupted Violet, as Sunny's wheezing continued to wax. “Skip to the part about the poison.”     “ 'As the poet says, ' ” Klaus read, “ 'A single spore has such grim power / That you may die within the hour. Is dilution simple? But of course! / Just one small dose of root of horse.' ”     “ 'Root of horse'?” Violet repeated. “How can a horse have a root?”     “I don't know,” Klaus said. “Usually antidotes are certain botanical extractions, like pollen from a flower, or the stem of a plant.”     “Does 'dilution' mean the same thing as 'antidote?” Violet asked, but before her brother could answer, Sunny wheezed again, and the diving helmet rocked back and forth as she struggled against the fungus.     Klaus looked at the book he was holding, and then at his sister, and then reached into the waterproof pocket of his uniform.     “What are you doing?” Violet asked.     “Getting my commonplace book,” Klaus replied. “I wrote down all the information on the history of Anwhistle Aquatics that we found in the grotto.”     “We don't have time to look at your research!” Violet said. “We need to find an antidote this very minute! Fiona's right – He or she who hesitates is lost.”     Klaus shook his head. “Not necessarily,” he said, and flipped a page of his dark blue notebook. “If we take one moment to think, we might save our sister. Now, what did Kit Snicket write in that letter? Here it is: 'The poisonous fungus you insist on cultivating in the grotto will bring grim consequences for all of us. Our factory at Lousy bane can provide some dilution of the mycelium's destructive respiratory capabilities...' That's it! V.F.D. was making something in a factory near Lousy Lane that could dilute the effects of the mycelium.”     “Lousy Lane?” Violet said. “That was the road to Uncle Monty's house. It had a terrible smell, remember? It smelled like black pepper. No, not black pepper...”     Klaus looked at his commonplace book, and then at Mushroom Minutiae. “Horseradish,” he said quietly. “The road smelled like horseradish! 'Root of horse'! Horseradish is the antidote!”     Violet was already striding to the kitchen. “Let's hope Phil likes to cook with horseradish,” she said, and pushed open the door.     Klaus picked up the wheezing helmet and followed her into the tiny kitchen. There was scarcely enough room for the children to stand in the small space between the stove, the refrigerator, and two wooden cabinets. “The cabinets must serve as a pantry,” Klaus said, using a word which here means “place where antidotes are hopefully stored.” “Horseradish should be there – if he has it.”     The elder Baudelaires shuddered, not wanting to think about what would happen to Sunny if horseradish were not found on the shelves. Within moments, however, Violet and Klaus had to consider that very thing. Violet opened one cupboard, and Klaus opened another, but the children saw immediately that there was no horseradish.     “Gum,” Violet said faintly. “Boxes and boxes of gum Phil brought from the lumbermill, and nothing else. Did you find anything, Klaus?”     Klaus pointed to a pair of small cans on one shelf of his cupboard, and held up a small paper bag. “Two cans of water chestnuts,” he said, “and a small bag of sesame seeds.” His fist closed tightly around the bag, and he blinked back tears behind his glasses. “What are we going to do?”     Sunny wheezed once more, a frantic whistle that reminded her siblings of a train's lonely noise as it disappears into a tunnel.     “Let's check the refrigerator,” Violet said. “Maybe there's horseradish in there.”     Klaus nodded, and opened the kitchen's refrigerator, which was almost as bare as the pantry. On the top shelf were six small bottles of lemon-lime soda, which Phil had offered the children on their first night aboard the Queequeg . On the middle shelf was a small piece of white, soft cheese, wrapped up in a bit of wax paper. And on the bottom shelf was a large plate, on which was something that made the two siblings begin to cry.     “I forgot,” Violet said, tears running down her face.     “Me too,” Klaus said, taking the plate out of the refrigerator.     Phil had used the last of the kitchen's provisions – a word which here means “cooking supplies” – to prepare a cake. It looked like a coconut cream cake, like Dr. Montgomery used to make, and the two siblings wondered if Sunny, even as a baby, had noticed enough about cooking to help Phil concoct such a dessert. The cake was heavily frosted, with bits of coconut mixed into the thick, creamy frosting, and spelled out in blue frosting on the top, in Phil's perky, optimistic handwriting, were three words. “Violet's Fifteenth Date,” Klaus said numbly. “That's what the balloons were for.”     “It was my fifteenth birthday,” Violet said. “I turned fifteen sometime when we were in the grotto, and I forgot all about it.”     “Sunny didn't forget,” Klaus said. “She said she was planning a surprise, remember? We were going to return from our mission in the cave, and celebrate your birthday.”     Violet slunk to the floor, and lay her head against Sunny's diving helmet. “What are we going to do?” she sobbed. “We can't lose Sunny. We can't lose her!”     “There must be something we can use,” Klaus said, “as a substitute for horseradish. What could it be?”     “I don't know!” Violet cried. “I don't know anything about cooking!”     “Neither do I!” Klaus said, crying as hard as his sister. “Sunny's the one who knows!”     The two weeping Baudelaires looked at one another, and then steeled themselves, a phrase which here means “summoned up as much strength as they could.” Then, without another word, they opened the tiny door of Sunny's helmet and quickly dragged their sister out, quickly shutting the door behind her so the fungus would not spread. At first, their sister looked completely unchanged, but when the wheezing young girl opened her mouth, they could see several gray stalks and caps of this horrible mushroom, splotched with black as if someone had poured ink into Sunny's mouth. Wheezing horribly, Sunny reached out her tiny arms to each of her siblings and grabbed their hands. She did not have to utter a word. Violet and Klaus knew she was begging for help, but there was nothing they could do except ask her one desperate question.     “Sunny,” Violet said, “we've researched an antidote. Only horseradish can save you. But there's no horseradish in the kitchen.”     “Sunny,” Klaus said, “is there a culinary equivalent of horseradish?”     Sunny opened her mouth as if trying to say something, but the elder Baudelaires only heard the hoarse, whistling sound of air trying to make its way past the mushrooms. Her tiny hands curled into fists, and her body twisted back and forth in pain and fear. Finally, she managed to utter one word – a word that many might not have understood. Some might have thought it was part of Sunny's personal vocabulary – perhaps her way of saying “I love you,” or even “Farewell, siblings.” Some might have thought it was pure nonsense, just the noises one might make when a deadly fungus has defeated you. But there are many others who would have understood it immediately. A person from Japan would have known she was talking about a condiment often served with raw fish and pickled ginger. A chef would have known that Sunny was referring to a strong, green root, widely considered the culinary equivalent of horseradish. And Violet and Klaus knew that their sister was naming her salvation, a phrase which here means “something that would save her life,” or “something that would rescue her from the Medusoid Mycelium,” or, most importantly, “an item the eldest Baudelaire still had in the waterproof pocket of her uniform, scaled in a tin Sunny had found in an underwater cavern.”     “Wasabi,” Sunny said, in a hoarse, mushroom-choked whisper, and she did not have to say anything more.
     The expression “the tables have turned” is not one the Baudelaire orphans had much occasion to use, as it refers to a situation that has suddenly been reversed, so that those who were previously in a powerless position could suddenly find themselves in a powerful one, and vice versa. For the Baudelaires, the tables had turned at Briny Beach, when they received news of the terrible fire, and Count Olaf suddenly became a powerful and terrifying figure in their lives. As time went on, the siblings waited and waited for the tables to turn back, so that Olaf might be defeated once and for all and they could find themselves free of the sinister and mysterious forces that threatened to engulf them, but the tables of the Baudelaires' lives seemed stuck, with the children always in a position of misery and sorrow while wickedness seemed to triumph all around them. But as Violet hurriedly opened the tin of wasabi she had been keeping in her pocket, and spooned the green, spicy mixture into Sunny's wheezing mouth, it seemed like the tables might turn after all. Sunny gasped when the wasabi hit her tongue, and the stalks and caps of the Medusoid Mycelium shivered, and seemed to shrink back from the powerful Japanese condiment. In moments, the fungus began to wither and fade away, and Sunny's wheezing faded into coughing, and her coughing faded into deep breaths as the youngest Baudelaire rallied, a word which here means “regained her strength, and ability to breathe.” The youngest Baudelaire hung on tight to her siblings' hands, and her eyes filled with tears, but Violet and Klaus could see that the Medusoid Mycelium would not triumph over their sister.     “It's working,” Violet said. ""Sunny's breathing is getting stronger.     “Yes,” Klaus said. “We've turned the tables on that ghastly fungus.”     “Water,” Sunny said, and her brother stood up from the kitchen floor and quickly got his sister a glass of water. Weakly, the youngest Baudelaire sat up and drank deeply from the glass, and then hugged both her siblings as tightly as she could. “Thank you,” she said. “Saved me.”     “You saved yourself,” Violet pointed out. “We had the wasabi this whole time, but we didn't think of giving it to you until you told us.”     Sunny coughed again, and lay back down on the floor. “Tuckered,” she murmured.     “I'm not surprised you're exhausted,” Violet said. “You've been through quite an ordeal. Shall we carry you to the barracks so you can rest?”     “Rest here,” Sunny said, curling up at the foot of the stove.     “Will you really be comfortable on the kitchen floor?” Klaus asked.     Sunny opened one exhausted eye and smiled at her siblings. “Near you,” she said.     “All right, Sunny,” Violet said, grabbing a dish towel from the kitchen counter, and folding it into a pillow for her sister. “We'll be in the Main Hall if you need us.”     “What next?” she murmured.     “Shh,” Klaus said, putting another dish towel on top of her. “Don't worry, Sunny. We'll figure out what to do next.”     The Baudelaires tiptoed out of the kitchen, carrying the tin of wasabi. “Do you think she'll be all right?” Violet asked.     “I'm sure she will,” Klaus said. “After a nap she'll be as good as new. But we should eat some of that wasabi ourselves. When we opened the diving helmet, we were exposed to the Medusoid Mycelium , and we'll need all of our strength to get away from Olaf.”     Violet nodded, and put a spoonful of wasabi into her mouth, shuddering violently as the condiment hit her tongue. “There's one last spoonful,” Violet said, handing the tin to her brother. “We'd better make sure that diving helmet stays closed until we get our hands on some horseradish and destroy that fungus for good.”     Klaus nodded in agreement, closed his eyes, and ate the last of the Japanese condiment. “If we ever invent that food code we talked about with Fiona,” he said, “the word 'wasabi' should mean 'powerful.' No wonder this cured our sister.”     “But now that we've cured her,” Violet said, remembering Sunny's question as she fell asleep, “what next?”     “Olaf is next,” Klaus said firmly. “He said he has everything he needs to defeat V.F.D. forever – except the sugar bowl.”     “You're right,” Violet said. “We have to turn the tables on him, and find it before he does.”     “But we don't know where it is,” Klaus said. “Someone must have taken it from the Gorgonian Grotto.”     “I wonder –” Violet said, but she never said what she wondered, because a strange noise interrupted her. The noise was a sort of whir, followed by a sort of beep, followed by all sorts of noises, and they seemed to be coming from deep within the machinery of the Queequeg . Finally, a green light lit up on a panel in the wall, and a flat, white object began to slither out of a tiny slit in the panel.     “It's paper,” Klaus said.     “It's more than paper,” Violet said, and walked over to the panel. The sheet of paper curled into her hand as it emerged from the slit, as if the machine were impatient for the eldest Baudelaire to read it. “This is the telegram device. We must be receiving –”     “A Volunteer Factual Dispatch,” Klaus finished. Violet nodded, and scanned the paper quickly. Sure enough, the words “Volunteer Factual Dispatch ” were printed on the top, and as more and more of the paper appeared, the eldest Baudelaire saw that it was addressed “To the Queequeg ,” with the date printed below, as well as the name of the person who was sending the telegram, miles and miles away on dry land. It was a name Violet almost dared not say out loud, even though she had felt as if she had been whispering it to herself for days, ever since the icy waters of the Stricken Stream had carried away a young man who meant very much to her.     “It's from Quigley Quagmire,” she said quietly.     Klaus's eyes widened in astonishment. “What does he say?” he asked.     Violet smiled as the telegram finished printing, her finger touching the Q in her friend's name. It was almost as if knowing that Quigley was alive was enough of a message.     “ 'It is my understanding that you have three additional volunteers on board STOP,' ” she read, remembering that “STOP” indicates the end of a sentence in a telegram. “ 'We are in desperate need of their services for a most urgent matter STOP. Please deliver them Tuesday to the location indicated in the rhymes below STOP.' ”     She scanned the paper and frowned thoughtfully. “Then there are two poems,” she said. “One by Lewis Carroll and the other by T. S. Eliot.”     Klaus took his commonplace book out of his pocket, and flipped pages until he found what he was looking for. “Verse Fluctuation Declaration,” he said. “That's the code we learned in the grotto. Quigley must have changed sonic of the words in the poems, so no one else would know where we're supposed to meet him. Let's see if we can recognize the changes.”     Violet nodded, and read the first poem out loud:“‘O Oysters, come and walk with us!'The Walrus did beseech.'A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,Along the movie theater.'     “That last part sounds wrong,” Violet said.     “There were no movie theaters when Lewis Carroll was alive,” Klaus said. “But what are the real words to the poem?”     “I don't know,” Violet said. “I've always found Lewis Carroll too whimsical for my taste.”     “I like him,” Klaus said, “but I haven't memorized his poems. Read the other one. Maybe that will help.”     Violet nodded, and read aloud:""At the pink hour when the eyes and backTurn upward from the desk, when the human engine waitsLike a pony throbbing party.""     The voice of the eldest Baudelaire trailed off, and she looked at her brother in confusion. “That's all,” she said. “The poem stops there.”     Klaus frowned. “There's nothing else in the telegram?”     “Only a few letters at the very bottom,” she said. “ 'CC: J.S.' What does that mean?”     “ 'CC' means that Quigley sent a copy of this message to someone else,” Klaus said, “and 'J.S.' are the initials of the person.”     “Those mysterious initials again,” Violet said. “It can't be Jacques Snicket, because he's dead. But who else could it be?”     “We can't worry about that now,” Klaus said. “We have to figure out what words have been substituted in these poems.”     “How can we do that?” Violet asked.     “I don't know,” Klaus said. “Why would Quigley think we would have memorized these poems?”     “He wouldn't think that,” Violet said. “He knows us. But the telegram was addressed to the Queequeg . He knew that someone on board could decode the poetry.”     “But who?” Klaus asked. “Not Fiona – she's a mycologist. An optimist like Phil isn't likely to be familiar with T. S. Eliot. And it's hard to imagine Captain Widdershins having a serious interest in poetry.”     “Not anymore,” Violet said thoughtfully. “But Fiona's brother said he and the captain used to study poetry together.”     “That's true,” Klaus said. “He said they used to read to one another in the Main Hall.” He walked over to the sideboard and opened the cabinet, peering at the books Fiona kept inside. “But there's no poetry here – just Fiona's mycological library.”     “Captain Widdershins wouldn't keep poetry books out front like that,” Violet said. “He would have kept them secret.”     “Just like he kept the secret of what happened to Fiona's brother,” Klaus said.     “He thought there were secrets too terrible for young people to know,” Violet said, “but now we need to know them.”     Klaus was silent for a moment, and then turned to his sister. “There's something I never told you,” he said. “Remember when our parents were so angry over the spoiled atlas?”     “We talked about that in the grotto,” Violet said. “The rain spoiled it when we left the library window open.”     “I don't think that's the only reason they were mad,” Klaus said. “I took that atlas down from the top shelf – one I could only reach by putting the stepladder on top of the chair. They didn't think I could reach that shelf.”     “Why would that make them angry?” Violet asked.     Klaus looked down. “That's where they kept books they didn't want us to find,” he said. “I was interested in the atlas, but when I removed it from the shelf there was a whole row of other books.”     “What kind of books?” Violet asked.     “I didn't get a good look at them,” Klaus said. “There were a few books about war, and I think a few romances. I was too interested in the atlas to investigate any further, but I remember thinking it was strange that our parents had hidden those books. That's why they were so angry, I think – when they saw the atlas on the window seat, they knew I'd discovered their secret.”     “Did you ever look at them again?” Violet said.     “I didn't have a chance,” Klaus said. “They moved them to another hiding place, and I never saw them again.”     “Maybe our parents were going to tell us what was in those books when we were older,” Violet said.     “Maybe,” Klaus agreed. “But we'll never know. We lost them in the fire.” The elder Baudelaires sat quietly for a moment, looking at the cabinet in the sideboard, and then, without a word, the two siblings stepped onto the wooden table so they could open the highest cabinet. Inside was a small stack of books on such dull topics as child rearing, proper and improper diets, and the water cycle, but when the children pushed these books aside they saw what they had been looking for.     “Elizabeth Bishop,” Violet said, “Charles Simic, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Franz Wright, Daphne Gottlieb – there's all sorts of poetry here.”     “Why don't you read T.S. Eliot,” Klaus suggested, handing her a thick, dusty volume, “and I'll tackle Lewis Carroll. If we read quickly we should be able to find the real poems and decode the message.”     “I found something else,” Violet said, handing her brother a crumpled square of paper. “Look.” Klaus looked at what his sister had given him. It was a photograph, blurred and faded with four people, grouped together like a family. In the center of the photograph was a large man with a long mustache that was curved at the end like a pair of parentheses – Captain Widdershins, of course, although he looked much younger and a great deal happier than the children had ever seen him. He was laughing, and his arm was around someone the two Baudelaires recognized as the hook-handed man, although he was not hook-handed in the photograph – both of his hands were perfectly intact, one resting on the captain's shoulder, and the other pointing at whoever was taking the picture – and he was young enough to still be called a teenager, instead of a man. On the other side of the captain was a woman who was laughing as hard as the captain, and in her arms was a young infant with a tiny set of triangular glasses.     “That must be Fiona's mother,” Klaus said, pointing at the laughing woman.     “Look,” Violet said, pointing to the wall behind the family. “This was taken on board the Queequeg . That's the edge of the plaque with the captain's personal philosophy – 'He who hesitates is lost.' ”     “The whole family is lost, almost,” Klaus said quietly. “Fiona's mother is dead. Her brother joined Count Olaf's troupe. And who knows where her stepfather is?” He put down the photograph, opened his commonplace book, and flipped to the beginning, where he had pasted another photograph taken long ago. This photograph also had four people in it, although one of the people was facing away from the camera, so it was impossible to tell who it was. The second person was Jacques Snicket, who of course was long dead. And the other two people were the Baudelaire parents. Klaus had kept this photograph ever since the children found it at Heimlich Hospital , and had looked at it every day, gazing into his parents' faces and reading the one sentence, over and over, that had been typed below it. “Because of the evidence discussed on page nine,” the sentence read, “experts now suspect that there may in fact be one survivor of the fire, but the survivor's whereabouts are unknown.”     For quite some time, the Baudelaires had thought this meant one of their parents was alive after all, but now they were almost certain it meant no such thing. Violet and Klaus looked from one photograph to the other, imagining a time when no one in the pictures was lost, and everyone was happy.     Klaus sighed, and looked at his sister. “Maybe we shouldn't be hesitating here,” Klaus said. “Maybe we should be rescuing our captain, instead of reading books of poetry and looking at old photographs. I don't want to lose Fiona.”     “Fiona's safe with her brother,” Violet said, “and I'm sure she'll join us when she can. We need to decode this message, or we might lose everything. In this case, he or she who doesn't hesitate is lost.”     “What if we decode the message before Fiona arrives?” Klaus asked. “Do we wait for her to join us?”     “We wouldn't have to,” Violet said. “The three of us could properly operate this submarine by ourselves. All we'd need to do is repair the porthole, and we could probably steer the Queequeg out of the Carmelita .”     “We can't abandon her here,” Klaus said. “She wouldn't abandon us.”     “Are you sure?” violet asked.     Klaus sighed, and looked at the photograph again. “No,” he said. “Let's get to work.”     Violet nodded in agreement, and the two Baudelaires shelved the discussion – a phrase which here means “temporarily stopped their conversation” and unshelved the poetry books in order to get to work on decoding Quigley's Verse Fluctuation Declarations. It had been some time since the Baudelaires had been able to read in a comfortable place, and the children were pleased to find themselves silently flipping pages, searching for certain words, and even taking a few notes. Reading poetry, even if you are only reading to find a secret message hidden within its words, can often give one a feeling of power, the way you can feel powerful if you are the only one who brought an umbrella on a rainy day, or the only one who knows how to untie knots when you're taken hostage. With each poem the children felt more and more powerful – or, as they might have said in their food code, more and more wasabi – and by the time the two volunteers were interrupted they felt as if the tables just might be continuing to turn.     “Snack!” announced a cheerful voice below them, and Violet and Klaus were pleased to see their sister emerging from the kitchen carrying a small plate.     “Sunny!” Violet cried. “We thought you were asleep.”     “Rekoop,” the youngest Baudelaire said, which meant something along the lines of, “I had a brief nap, and when I woke up I felt well enough to cook something.”     “I am a bit hungry,” Klaus admitted. “What did you make us?”     “Amuse bouche,” Sunny said, which meant something like, “Tiny water chestnut sandwiches, with a spread of cheese and sesame seeds.”     “They're quite tasty,” Violet said, and the three children shared the plate of amuse bouche as the elder Baudelaires brought Sunny up to speed, a phrase which here means “told their sister what had happened while she was suffering inside the diving helmet.” They told her about the terrible villain they encountered inside. They described the hideous circumstances in which the Snow Scouts found themselves, and the hideous clothing worn by Esmé Squalor and Carmelita Spats. They told her about the Volunteer Factual Dispatch, and the Verse Fluctuation Declarations they were trying to decode. And, finally, they told her about the hook-handed man being Fiona's long-lost brother, and the possibility that he might join them aboard the Queequeg . “Perifido,” Sunny said, which meant “It would be foolish to trust one of Olaf's henchmen.”     “We don't trust him,” Klaus said. “Not really. But Fiona trusts him, and we trust Fiona.”     “Volatile,” Sunny said.     “Yes,” Violet admitted, “but we don't have much choice. We're in the middle of the ocean –”     “And we need to get to the beach,” Klaus said, and held up the book of Lewis Carroll's poetry. “I think I've solved part of the Verse Fluctuation Declaration. Lewis Carroll has a poem called 'The Walrus and the Carpenter.' ”"|"The Grim Grotto"|"Lemony Snicket"
