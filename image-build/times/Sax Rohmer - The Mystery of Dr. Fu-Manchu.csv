"ap 02:00"|two|"The horrible events that followed are punctuated in my mind, by the striking of a distant clock. It is singular how trivialities thus assert themselves in moments of high tension. I will proceed, then, by these punctuations, to the coming of the horror that it was written we should encounter.
The clock across the common struck two.
Having removed all traces of the scent of the orchid from our hands with a solution of ammonia, Smith and I had followed the programme laid down. It was an easy matter to reach the rear of the house, by simply climbing a fence, and we did not doubt that, seeing the light go out in the front, our unseen watcher would proceed to the back."|"The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu"|"Sax Rohmer"
"ap 02:15"|"quarter-past two"|"No unusual sound, so far, had disturbed the stillness of the night. Save for the muffled throb of the rare all-night cars passing the front of the house, our vigil had been a silent one. The full moon had painted about the floor weird shadows of the clustering ivy, spreading the design gradually from the door, across the room, past the little table where the envelope lay, and finally to the foot of the bed.
The distant clock struck a quarter-past two.
A slight breeze stirred the ivy, and a new shadow added itself to the extreme edge of the moon’s design."|"The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu"|"Sax Rohmer"
06:00|"six a.m."|"“The body of a lascar dressed in the manner usual on the P & O boats, was recovered from the Thames off Tilbury by the river police at six a.m. this morning. It is supposed that the man met with an accident in leaving his ship.”"|"The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu"|"Sax Rohmer"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"“It was almost the same with Mason.” The river police inspector was speaking. “A week ago, on a Wednesday, he went off in his own time on some funny business down St. George’s way—and Thursday night the ten o’clock boat got the grapnel on him off Hanover Hole. His first two fingers on the right hand were clean gone, and his left hand was mutilated frightfully.”"|"The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu"|"Sax Rohmer"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"“Limehouse Reach—under Commercial Dock Pier—exactly an hour ago.”
“And you last saw him at eight o’clock last night?”—to Weymouth.
“Eight to a quarter-past.”"|"The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu"|"Sax Rohmer"
"ap 10:23"|"ten twenty-three"|"“Exactly ten twenty-three,” he said. “I will trouble you, Inspector, for the freedom of your fancy wardrobe. There is time to spend an hour in the company of Shen-Yan’s opium fiends.”"|"The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu"|"Sax Rohmer"
"ap 01:00"|one|"“I don’t,” said Smith, “but it is the first clue we have had pointing to one of his haunts, and time means precious lives where Dr. Fu-Manchu is concerned”"|"The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu"|"Sax Rohmer"
00:12|"twelve minutes past midnight"|"I glanced at my watch in the moonlight. It was twelve minutes past midnight."|"The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu"|"Sax Rohmer"
00:00|midnight|"Although we avoided all unnecessary delay, it was close upon midnight when our cab swung around into a darkly shadowed avenue at the further end of which, as seen through a tunnel, the moonlight glittered upon the windows of Rowan House, Sir Lionel Barton’s home."|"The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu"|"Sax Rohmer"
"ap 10:30"|"half-past ten"|"“Well,” continued the inspector, “the man you arranged to send down from the Yard got here all right and took up a post in the road outside, where he could command a good view of the gates. He saw and heard nothing, until going on for half-past ten, when a young lady turned up and went in.”"|"The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu"|"Sax Rohmer"
"ap 00:30"|"half-past twelve"|"“You would have warned Mr. Graham Guthrie?” he said, in a soft voice. “Tonight, at half-past twelve, Mr. Graham Guthrie dies!”"|"The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu"|"Sax Rohmer"
"ap 00:30"|"half-past twelve"|"“It calls for you!” said Fu-Manchu. “At half-past twelve it calls for Graham Guthrie!”"|"The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu"|"Sax Rohmer"
"ap 10:30"|"Half-past ten"|"It was Windsor Castle.
“Half-past ten,” cried Smith. “Two hours to save Graham Guthrie!”
We had exactly fourteen minutes in which to catch the last train to Waterloo; and we caught it. But I sank into a corner of the compartment in a state bordering upon collapse. Neither of us, I think, could have managed another twenty yards. With a lesser stake than a human life at issue, I doubt if we should have attempted that dash to Windsor Station."|"The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu"|"Sax Rohmer"
"ap 11:51"|"eleven fifty-one"|"“Due at Waterloo at eleven fifty-one,” panted Smith. “That gives us thirty-nine minutes to get to the other side of the river and reach his hotel.”"|"The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu"|"Sax Rohmer"
00:00|midnight|"The train was late, and as our cab turned out of Waterloo Station and began to ascend to the bridge, from a hundred steeples rang out the gongs of midnight, the bell of St. Paul’s raised above them all to vie with the deep voice of Big Ben."|"The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu"|"Sax Rohmer"
"ap ~ 11:00"|"about eleven o’clock"|"“I have!” was the startling reply. That accounts for you finding me where you did. My usual post is in the lobby. But about eleven o’clock, when the theatre people began to come in, I had a hazy sort of impression that some one or something slipped past in the crowd—something that had no business in the hotel.”"|"The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu"|"Sax Rohmer"
"ap 00:25"|"twenty-five minutes past twelve"|"“There is no time for ceremony,” he explained. “It is now twenty-five minutes past twelve. At half-past an attempt will be made upon your life!”"|"The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu"|"Sax Rohmer"
12:00|noonday|"Never lifting my eyes from the water, I waved my hand reassuringly. But still the dacoit did not rise. I searched the surface in all directions as far as my eyes could reach; but no swimmer showed above it. Then it was that I concluded he had dived too deeply, become entangled in the weeds and was drowned. With a final glance to right and left, and some feeling of awe at this sudden tragedy—this grim going out of a life at glorious noonday—I turned away. Smith had the woman securely; but I had not taken five steps toward him when a faint splash behind warned me. Instinctively I ducked. From whence that saving instinct arose I cannot surmise, but to it I owed my life. For as I rapidly lowered my head, something hummed past me, something that flew out over the grass bank, and fell with a jangle upon the dusty roadside: a knife!"|"The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu"|"Sax Rohmer"
00:00|midnight|"Whom could she be, this elegant lady who visited such a haunt— who, it would seem, was so anxious to disguise her identity, but who was dressed for a society function rather than for a midnight expedition of so unusual a character?"|"The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu"|"Sax Rohmer"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"“Yes,” groaned West, pressing his hand to his forehead. “I bolted it myself at eleven o’clock, when I came in.”"|"The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu"|"Sax Rohmer"
"ap ~ 11:00"|"about eleven o’clock"|"“I came in, as I said,” explained West, “about eleven o’clock, and, having made some notes relating to an interview arranged for this morning, I locked the plans in the safe and turned in.”"|"The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu"|"Sax Rohmer"
"~ 02:00"|"about two o’clock this morning"|"“He had latterly developed symptoms of angina pectoris,” explained the family physician, “but I had not anticipated a fatal termination so soon. I was called about two o’clock this morning, and found Lord Southery in a dangerously exhausted condition. I did all that was possible, and Sir Frank Narcombe was sent for. But shortly before his arrival the patient expired.”"|"The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu"|"Sax Rohmer"

"ap 02:30"|"half-past two"|"“My wife has been staying with her,” he explained, “since—it happened; and for the last three nights poor John’s widow has cried out at the same time—half-past two—that someone was knocking on the door.”"|"The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu"|"Sax Rohmer"
"ap 02:30"|"half-past two"|"“John often came home at half-past two from the Yard,” continued Weymouth; “so we naturally thought poor Mary was wandering in her mind. But last night—and it’s not to be wondered at—my wife couldn’t sleep, and she was wide awake at half-past two.”"|"The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu"|"Sax Rohmer"
"ap 00:00"|"twelve o’clock"|"“Good!” cried Smith. He was intensely excited now. “I rely upon you to arrange something, Petrie. Mr. Weymouth”—he turned to our visitor—“I shall be with you this evening not later than twelve o’clock.”"|"The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu"|"Sax Rohmer"
"ap 02:15"|"quarter-past two"|"At a quarter-past two the breeze dropped entirely, and such a stillness reigned all about us as I could not have supposed possible so near to the ever-throbbing heart of the metropolis. Plainly I could hear Weymouth’s heavy breathing. He sat at the window and looked out into the black shadows under the cedars. Smith ceased his pacing and stood again on the rug very still. He was listening! I doubt not we were all listening."|"The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu"|"Sax Rohmer"
"ap 02:30"|"half-past two"|"He had hidden himself cunningly; but witnesses appeared who had seen him, in the dusk, and fled from him. They never learnt that the object of their fear was Inspector John Weymouth. How, having escaped death in the Thames, he had crossed London unobserved, we never knew; but his trick of knocking upon his own door at half-past two each morning (a sort of dawning of sanity mysteriously linked with old custom) will be a familiar class of symptom to all students of alienation."|"The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu"|"Sax Rohmer"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"“Hullo!” cried Eltham—“hard luck, Doctor!”—but I could see that he welcomed the interruption. “Why!” he added, “it is one o’clock!”"|"The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu"|"Sax Rohmer"
01:00|"one o’clock in the morning"|"Some three hundred yards I had gone, I suppose, and my brain had been very active the while, when something occurred to me which placed a new complexion upon this second summons. I thought of the falsity of the first, of the improbability of even the most hardened practical joker practising his wiles at one o’clock in the morning. I thought of our recent conversation; above all I thought of the girl who had delivered the message to Eltham, the girl whom he had described as a French maid—whose personal charm had so completely enlisted his sympathies. Now, to this train of thought came a new one, and, adding it, my suspicion became almost a certainty."|"The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu"|"Sax Rohmer"
"ap 10:30"|Ten-thirty|"From across the common a clock sounded the half-hour.
“Ten-thirty!” I said. “A late visitor. Show him up, if you please.”
I pushed my writing aside and tilted the lampshade, as footsteps sounded on the landing. The next moment I had jumped to my feet, for a tall, lean man, with his square-cut, clean-shaven face sun-baked to the hue of coffee, entered and extended both hands with a cry:"|"The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu"|"Sax Rohmer"

"ap ~ 10:25"|"about ten twenty-five"|"“Yes, always. It was open for minute or less at about ten twenty-five, when a message came for Sir Crichton. I took it in to him, and he then seemed in his usual health.”"|"The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu"|"Sax Rohmer"
"ap 10:30"|"half-past ten"|"“I could not say. It was brought by a district messenger, and he placed it beside him on the table. It is there now, no doubt.”
“And at half-past ten?”
“Sir Crichton suddenly burst open the door and threw himself, with a scream, into the library. I ran to him, but he waved me back. His eyes were glaring horribly. I had just reached his side when he fell, writhing, upon the floor. He seemed past speech, but as I raised him and laid him upon the couch, he gasped something that sounded like ‘The red hand!’ Before I could get to bell or telephone he was dead!”"|"The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu"|"Sax Rohmer"
