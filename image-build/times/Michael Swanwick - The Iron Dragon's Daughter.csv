01:00|"one in the emptiness of the night"|"Rooster groaned. In a high, lucid voice he said, ""Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese…"" Jane found herself unable to breathe. ""… and a sesame seed bun."" It was too awful, his lonely voice speaking to no one in the emptiness of the night. ""Teflon."" She grasped the broken board with her hand and swung it to. With it closed, she could no longer hear him."|"The Iron Dragon's Daughter"|"Michael Swanwick"
12:00|noon|"Blugg exploded. ""Get out of here! You fucking stupid brat. Go straight to the tub room and get scrubbing! I want that shit off your face by noon if you have to take the skin with it."""|"The Iron Dragon's Daughter"|"Michael Swanwick"
"ap 04:00"|"four o'clock"|"""Boogie at four o'clock,"" Hebog growled quietly. ""And closing fast."" Jane twisted in her seat and saw Grunt, smiling broadly, bearing down on them. ""Shit!"" she hissed between her teeth."|"The Iron Dragon's Daughter"|"Michael Swanwick"
00:00|midnight|"""I was standing on the edge of the pool when she burst out. It was the most fantastic thing anybody has ever seen. One second, nothing, and then this beautiful, naked—"" He groped for words. ""It was as if the sun had risen at midnight."""|"The Iron Dragon's Daughter"|"Michael Swanwick"
00:00|midnight|"""We had taken over an unused handball court and fitted it with our equipment. There we spent most of a year, flirting with glory and never winning her. The final month of our funding—the Foundation had harsh penalties for failure—we literally moved into the lab. For three weeks straight we built, unbuilt, and rebuilt that monstrosity. Up all night, every night, and far into the dawn. We slept on cots and lived on take-out, eating cold pizza for breakfast, egg rolls and chocolate doughnuts at midnight. I lost count of the times we booted the creature up, got it to open its eyes, and coaxed it into moving its mouth, but to no purpose. It would not speak."|"The Iron Dragon's Daughter"|"Michael Swanwick"
00:00|midnight|"Jane's anger was long gone. She read the flimsy only to drain it of power, to purge herself of the last traces of emotionality, to ensure that she did what she had to calmly and alertly. Then it was time. The University library opened its doors at midnight and closed at dawn. The rationale given for such extraordinary hours was that they discouraged dilettantes and idlers from wasting the library's facilities. Jane suspected darker motives were at work, but this once she was just as glad for the privacy of its empty halls and echoing rooms. By side passages and wrought iron spiral stairways, she traced a labyrinthine path to the more obscure reaches of the collected lore."|"The Iron Dragon's Daughter"|"Michael Swanwick"
00:00|midnight|"The consequences of Dr. Nemesis's fit of pique struck her then with the force of outrage. Everything she had done since that instant—most of a day's classes, all her studying, encounters with friends—had been stolen away from her. ""That bitch,"" she muttered. Then, angrier, ""Well, fuck her! Fuck her three ways from midnight."""|"The Iron Dragon's Daughter"|"Michael Swanwick"
00:00|midnight|"Ratsnickle plunged a fork into the greasy sausage on his plate and waved it in her face. ""You're going to get sick eating all that green shit. You need to put some meat in your mouth."" He bit off the end and, chewing open-mouthed, continued, ""Tell you what. Why don't you join Monkey and me for a little midnight snack tonight? We'll put some meat on your bones. Get a little protein into you."" Jane put her fork down. ""If you can't—"""|"The Iron Dragon's Daughter"|"Michael Swanwick"
00:00|midnight|"She had to get back to Bellegarde! They'd be closing the riot gates at midnight. But if she could slip in before then, she might yet find refuge in Sirin's room or maybe Linnet's, high above ground level where the worst was sure to go down."|"The Iron Dragon's Daughter"|"Michael Swanwick"
"ap 02:00"|2:00|"""One time, passing through the Carolinas somewhere between 2:00 and 3:00 A.M., Jerry-D and I picked up a white Lotus with two blonds in it. We honked and waved. They gave us the finger and put the pedal to the metal. I did the same, of course, but even with dual carbs it was no contest. We had a muscle car but they had a sex machine. They made us eat their dust."" The land rose to either side of the trail. Jane looked up at the distant, slanting trees and saw no horizon. She raised her sight higher and higher, until finally she saw the woods looping far overhead and down on the other side again. They were walking through an immense tube or tunnel. It twisted dizzyingly, an artery fleeing the dark heart of some unimaginably huge body. The chimeric, half-human trees closed about them."|"The Iron Dragon's Daughter"|"Michael Swanwick"

12:00|noon|"""Okay, now, I've been studying Blugg. On black foundry days, he goes to his office at noon, where he can watch us through the window in his door, and cuts his big, ugly nails. He uses this humongous great knife, and cuts them down into an ashtray. When he's done, he balls them up in a paper napkin and tosses it into the foundry fires, so they can't be used against him."|"The Iron Dragon's Daughter"|"Michael Swanwick"
00:00|midnight|"For a long, breathless moment they waited to hear if Blugg had been roused. They listened for his heavy tread coming up the stairs, the angry creaking of old wood, felt for the stale aura of violence and barely suppressed anger that he pushed before him. Even Rooster look frightened. But there came no sound other than the snort of cyborg hounds on patrol, the clang and rustle of dragons in the yards stirring restlessly in their chains, and the distant subaudible chime of midnight bells celebrating some faraway sylvan revelry. Blugg still slept."|"The Iron Dragon's Daughter"|"Michael Swanwick"
12:00|noon|"The black foundry was the second largest work space in all the plant. Here the iron was poured to make the invulnerable bodies and lesser magick-proofed parts of the great dragons. Concrete pits held the green sand, silt mixes, and loam molds. Cranes moved slowly on overhead beams, and the October sunlight slanted down through airborne dust laboriously churned by gigantic ventilating fans. At noon an old lake hag came by with the lunch cart, and Jane received a plastic-wrapped sandwich and a cup of lukewarm grapefruit juice for her portion. She left her chamois gloves at the workbench, and carried her food to a warm, dusty niche beside a wood frame bin filled with iron scrap, a jumble of claws, scales, and cogwheels."|"The Iron Dragon's Daughter"|"Michael Swanwick"
12:00|"high noon"|"Jane turned. The shadow-boy was standing in the niche she had just vacated, a ragged figure dim and difficult to see even at high noon. ""Rooster sent me,"" he said. ""I'm supposed to keep lookout for you."" She could not make out the expression on his face, but his voice trembled. She felt awful now, and afraid. ""I can't,"" she said. She didn't have the nerve to go ahead with it. ""I just—"""|"The Iron Dragon's Daughter"|"Michael Swanwick"
12:00|midday|"A roar shattered the midday calm. Suddenly everyone was running, throwing down tools, scuttling out onto the work floor and climbing up on the molds to see what was going on. They were all rushing toward the cupolas. Something was happening there. Jane stared into the swirl of figures, unable to make sense of all the noise and motion. Then suddenly everything snapped into place. Rooster, laughing insanely, was pissing on a hammer giant's foot."|"The Iron Dragon's Daughter"|"Michael Swanwick"
00:00|midnight|"His eyes were palest blue and beautiful beyond description. Jane felt herself drowning in them. Peter took her in his arms again, this time for simple affection, and it was the nicest sensation imaginable. A great joy filled her, like the sun rising at midnight. She asked, ""Are you sorry?"" He shook his head. He was drunk—they both were—and his eyes had a tendency to cross, but his sincerity was unmistakable. ""Jane. I think maybe this was supposed to happen. You know? I feel a connection with you. Something deep. Like… you know how if you take a coin and break it in a vise and throw half in the ocean and keep the other in a dresser drawer, they'll yearn after each other? One day you're taking out a pair of socks and you knock the drawer-half onto the floor without noticing. Somebody kicks it toward the door. A week later, it's half a block away. And the other half meanwhile, a fish swallows it and is caught and gutted and the entrails thrown into the trash, half-coin and all. So that maybe a couple of months later, it might take a century, you'll find the two lying in the sand at the verge of some nothing-special stretch of country road, nestled together."|"The Iron Dragon's Daughter"|"Michael Swanwick"
"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"The next day around noon they were wakened by a loud banging on the door. Before Jane could pull herself entirely awake it burst open and the room filled with elves. There seemed to be dozens of them, all in stern suits and unforgiving shoes. They stared down at the bed with expressions of disgust."|"The Iron Dragon's Daughter"|"Michael Swanwick"
"~ 00:00"|"Around midnight"|"Around midnight the moon rose and shortly thereafter there was a slight stirring at the center of Peter's forehead. Slowly, a slim black crack appeared and widened there. His face broke open like brittle paper."|"The Iron Dragon's Daughter"|"Michael Swanwick"
