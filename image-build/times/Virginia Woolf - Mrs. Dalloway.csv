"ap ~ 01:00"|"round one"|"For having lived in Westminster — how many years now? over twenty — one feels even in the midst of the traffic, or
waking at night, Clarissa was positive, a particular hush, or solemnity; an indescribable pause; a suspense (but that
might be her heart, affected, they said, by influenza) before Big Ben strikes. There! Out it boomed. First a warning,
musical; then the hour, irrevocable. The leaden circles dissolved in the air. Such fools we are, she thought, crossing
Victoria Street. For Heaven only knows why one loves it so, how one sees it so, making it up, building it round one,
tumbling it, creating it every moment afresh; but the veriest frumps, the most dejected of miseries sitting on
doorsteps (drink their downfall) do the same; can’t be dealt with, she felt positive, by Acts of Parliament for that
very reason: they love life. In people’s eyes, in the swing, tramp, and trudge; in the bellow and the uproar; the
carriages, motor cars, omnibuses, vans, sandwich men shuffling and swinging; brass bands; barrel organs; in the triumph
and the jingle and the strange high singing of some aeroplane overhead was what she loved; life; London; this moment of
June."|"Mrs. Dalloway"|"Virginia Woolf"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"“Kreemo,” murmured Mrs. Bletchley, like a sleep-walker. With his hat held out perfectly still in his hand, Mr.
Bowley gazed straight up. All down the Mall people were standing and looking up into the sky. As they looked the whole
world became perfectly silent, and a flight of gulls crossed the sky, first one gull leading, then another, and in this
extraordinary silence and peace, in this pallor, in this purity, bells struck eleven times, the sound fading up there
among the gulls."|"Mrs. Dalloway"|"Virginia Woolf"
00:00|midnight|"There was nobody. Her words faded. So a rocket fades. Its sparks, having grazed their way into the night, surrender
to it, dark descends, pours over the outlines of houses and towers; bleak hillsides soften and fall in. But though they
are gone, the night is full of them; robbed of colour, blank of windows, they exist more ponderously, give out what the
frank daylight fails to transmit — the trouble and suspense of things conglomerated there in the darkness; huddled
together in the darkness; reft of the relief which dawn brings when, washing the walls white and grey, spotting each
window-pane, lifting the mist from the fields, showing the red-brown cows peacefully grazing, all is once more decked
out to the eye; exists again. I am alone; I am alone! she cried, by the fountain in Regent’s Park (staring at the
Indian and his cross), as perhaps at midnight, when all boundaries are lost, the country reverts to its ancient shape,
as the Romans saw it, lying cloudy, when they landed, and the hills had no names and rivers wound they knew not where —
such was her darkness; when suddenly, as if a shelf were shot forth and she stood on it, she said how she was his wife,
married years ago in Milan, his wife, and would never, never tell that he was mad! Turning, the shelf fell; down, down
she dropped. For he was gone, she thought — gone, as he threatened, to kill himself — to throw himself under a cart!
But no; there he was; still sitting alone on the seat, in his shabby overcoat, his legs crossed, staring, talking
aloud."|"Mrs. Dalloway"|"Virginia Woolf"
12:00|midday|"Like a nun withdrawing, or a child exploring a tower, she went upstairs, paused at the window, came to the bathroom.
There was the green linoleum and a tap dripping. There was an emptiness about the heart of life; an attic room. Women
must put off their rich apparel. At midday they must disrobe. She pierced the pincushion and laid her feathered yellow
hat on the bed. The sheets were clean, tight stretched in a broad white band from side to side. Narrower and narrower
would her bed be. The candle was half burnt down and she had read deep in Baron Marbot’s Memoirs. She had read late at
night of the retreat from Moscow. For the House sat so long that Richard insisted, after her illness, that she must
sleep undisturbed. And really she preferred to read of the retreat from Moscow. He knew it. So the room was an attic;
the bed narrow; and lying there reading, for she slept badly, she could not dispel a virginity preserved through
childbirth which clung to her like a sheet. Lovely in girlhood, suddenly there came a moment — for example on the river
beneath the woods at Clieveden — when, through some contraction of this cold spirit, she had failed him. And then at
Constantinople, and again and again. She could see what she lacked. It was not beauty; it was not mind. It was
something central which permeated; something warm which broke up surfaces and rippled the cold contact of man and
woman, or of women together. For THAT she could dimly perceive. She resented it, had a scruple picked up Heaven knows
where, or, as she felt, sent by Nature (who is invariably wise); yet she could not resist sometimes yielding to the
charm of a woman, not a girl, of a woman confessing, as to her they often did, some scrape, some folly. And whether it
was pity, or their beauty, or that she was older, or some accident — like a faint scent, or a violin next door (so
strange is the power of sounds at certain moments), she did undoubtedly then feel what men felt. Only for a moment; but
it was enough. It was a sudden revelation, a tinge like a blush which one tried to check and then, as it spread, one
yielded to its expansion, and rushed to the farthest verge and there quivered and felt the world come closer, swollen
with some astonishing significance, some pressure of rapture, which split its thin skin and gushed and poured with an
extraordinary alleviation over the cracks and sores! Then, for that moment, she had seen an illumination; a match
burning in a crocus; an inner meaning almost expressed. But the close withdrew; the hard softened. It was over — the
moment. Against such moments (with women too) there contrasted (as she laid her hat down) the bed and Baron Marbot and
the candle half-burnt. Lying awake, the floor creaked; the lit house was suddenly darkened, and if she raised her head
she could just hear the click of the handle released as gently as possible by Richard, who slipped upstairs in his
socks and then, as often as not, dropped his hot-water bottle and swore! How she laughed!"|"Mrs. Dalloway"|"Virginia Woolf"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"“And how,” she said, turning the crystal dolphin to stand straight, “how did you enjoy the play last night?” “Oh,
they had to go before the end!” she said. “They had to be back at ten!” she said. “So they don’t know what happened,”
she said. “That does seem hard luck,” she said (for her servants stayed later, if they asked her). “That does seem
rather a shame,” she said, taking the old bald-looking cushion in the middle of the sofa and putting it in Lucy’s arms,
and giving her a little push, and crying:"|"Mrs. Dalloway"|"Virginia Woolf"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"“Who can — what can,” asked Mrs. Dalloway (thinking it was outrageous to be interrupted at eleven o’clock on the
morning of the day she was giving a party), hearing a step on the stairs. She heard a hand upon the door. She made to
hide her dress, like a virgin protecting chastity, respecting privacy. Now the brass knob slipped. Now the door opened,
and in came — for a single second she could not remember what he was called! so surprised she was to see him, so glad,
so shy, so utterly taken aback to have Peter Walsh come to her unexpectedly in the morning! (She had not read his
letter.)"|"Mrs. Dalloway"|"Virginia Woolf"
"ap 11:30"|"half-past eleven"|"The way she said “Here is my Elizabeth!”— that annoyed him. Why not “Here’s Elizabeth” simply? It was insincere. And
Elizabeth didn’t like it either. (Still the last tremors of the great booming voice shook the air round him; the
half-hour; still early; only half-past eleven still.) For he understood young people; he liked them. There was always
something cold in Clarissa, he thought. She had always, even as a girl, a sort of timidity, which in middle age becomes
conventionality, and then it’s all up, it’s all up, he thought, looking rather drearily into the glassy depths, and
wondering whether by calling at that hour he had annoyed her; overcome with shame suddenly at having been a fool; wept;
been emotional; told her everything, as usual, as usual."|"Mrs. Dalloway"|"Virginia Woolf"
"ap 11:30"|"half-past eleven"|"Ah, said St. Margaret’s, like a hostess who comes into her drawing-room on the very stroke of the hour and finds her
guests there already. I am not late. No, it is precisely half-past eleven, she says. Yet, though she is perfectly
right, her voice, being the voice of the hostess, is reluctant to inflict its individuality. Some grief for the past
holds it back; some concern for the present. It is half-past eleven, she says, and the sound of St. Margaret’s glides
into the recesses of the heart and buries itself in ring after ring of sound, like something alive which wants to
confide itself, to disperse itself, to be, with a tremor of delight, at rest — like Clarissa herself, thought Peter
Walsh, coming down the stairs on the stroke of the hour in white. It is Clarissa herself, he thought, with a deep
emotion, and an extraordinarily clear, yet puzzling, recollection of her, as if this bell had come into the room years
ago, where they sat at some moment of great intimacy, and had gone from one to the other and had left, like a bee with
honey, laden with the moment. But what room? What moment? And why had he been so profoundly happy when the clock was
striking? Then, as the sound of St. Margaret’s languished, he thought, She has been ill, and the sound expressed
languor and suffering. It was her heart, he remembered; and the sudden loudness of the final stroke tolled for death
that surprised in the midst of life, Clarissa falling where she stood, in her drawing-room. No! No! he cried. She is
not dead! I am not old, he cried, and marched up Whitehall, as if there rolled down to him, vigorous, unending, his
future."|"Mrs. Dalloway"|"Virginia Woolf"
"ap 11:30"|"half-past eleven"|"And just because nobody yet knew he was in London, except Clarissa, and the earth, after the voyage, still seemed an
island to him, the strangeness of standing alone, alive, unknown, at half-past eleven in Trafalgar Square overcame him.
What is it? Where am I? And why, after all, does one do it? he thought, the divorce seeming all moonshine. And down his
mind went flat as a marsh, and three great emotions bowled over him; understanding; a vast philanthropy; and finally,
as if the result of the others, an irrepressible, exquisite delight; as if inside his brain by another hand strings
were pulled, shutters moved, and he, having nothing to do with it, yet stood at the opening of endless avenues, down
which if he chose he might wander. He had not felt so young for years."|"Mrs. Dalloway"|"Virginia Woolf"
15:00|"three o’clock in the afternoon"|"The final scene, the terrible scene which he believed had mattered more than anything in the whole of his life (it
might be an exaggeration — but still so it did seem now) happened at three o’clock in the afternoon of a very hot day.
It was a trifle that led up to it — Sally at lunch saying something about Dalloway, and calling him “My name is
Dalloway”; whereupon Clarissa suddenly stiffened, coloured, in a way she had, and rapped out sharply, “We’ve had enough
of that feeble joke.” That was all; but for him it was precisely as if she had said, “I’m only amusing myself with you;
I’ve an understanding with Richard Dalloway.” So he took it. He had not slept for nights. “It’s got to be finished one
way or the other,” he said to himself. He sent a note to her by Sally asking her to meet him by the fountain at three.
“Something very important has happened,” he scribbled at the end of it."|"Mrs. Dalloway"|"Virginia Woolf"
"ap 03:00"|three|"The final scene, the terrible scene which he believed had mattered more than anything in the whole of his life (it

"ap 23:45"|"quarter to twelve"|"“I will tell you the time,” said Septimus, very slowly, very drowsily, smiling mysteriously. As he sat smiling at
the dead man in the grey suit the quarter struck — the quarter to twelve."|"Mrs. Dalloway"|"Virginia Woolf"
03:00|"three
o’clock in the morning"|"Was he not like Keats? she asked; and reflected how she might give him a taste of Antony and Cleopatra and the rest;
lent him books; wrote him scraps of letters; and lit in him such a fire as burns only once in a lifetime, without heat,
flickering a red gold flame infinitely ethereal and insubstantial over Miss Pole; Antony and Cleopatra; and the
Waterloo Road. He thought her beautiful, believed her impeccably wise; dreamed of her, wrote poems to her, which,
ignoring the subject, she corrected in red ink; he saw her, one summer evening, walking in a green dress in a square.
“It has flowered,” the gardener might have said, had he opened the door; had he come in, that is to say, any night
about this time, and found him writing; found him tearing up his writing; found him finishing a masterpiece at three
o’clock in the morning and running out to pace the streets, and visiting churches, and fasting one day, drinking
another, devouring Shakespeare, Darwin, The History of Civilisation, and Bernard Shaw."|"Mrs. Dalloway"|"Virginia Woolf"
"ap 05:00"|five|"He watched her snip, shape, as one watches a bird hop, flit in the grass, without daring to move a finger. For the
truth is (let her ignore it) that human beings have neither kindness, nor faith, nor charity beyond what serves to
increase the pleasure of the moment. They hunt in packs. Their packs scour the desert and vanish screaming into the
wilderness. They desert the fallen. They are plastered over with grimaces. There was Brewer at the office, with his
waxed moustache, coral tie-pin, white slip, and pleasurable emotions — all coldness and clamminess within — his
geraniums ruined in the War — his cook’s nerves destroyed; or Amelia What’shername, handing round cups of tea
punctually at five — a leering, sneering obscene little harpy; and the Toms and Berties in their starched shirt fronts
oozing thick drops of vice. They never saw him drawing pictures of them naked at their antics in his notebook. In the
street, vans roared past him; brutality blared out on placards; men were trapped in mines; women burnt alive; and once
a maimed file of lunatics being exercised or displayed for the diversion of the populace (who laughed aloud), ambled
and nodded and grinned past him, in the Tottenham Court Road, each half apologetically, yet triumphantly, inflicting
his hopeless woe. And would HE go mad?"|"Mrs. Dalloway"|"Virginia Woolf"
"ap 00:00"|"twelve o’clock"|"It was precisely twelve o’clock; twelve by Big Ben; whose stroke was wafted over the northern part of London; blent
with that of other clocks, mixed in a thin ethereal way with the clouds and wisps of smoke, and died up there among the
seagulls — twelve o’clock struck as Clarissa Dalloway laid her green dress on her bed, and the Warren Smiths walked
down Harley Street. Twelve was the hour of their appointment. Probably, Rezia thought, that was Sir William Bradshaw’s
house with the grey motor car in front of it. The leaden circles dissolved in the air."|"Mrs. Dalloway"|"Virginia Woolf"

"ap 10:00"|ten|"But Proportion has a sister, less smiling, more formidable, a Goddess even now engaged — in the heat and sands of
India, the mud and swamp of Africa, the purlieus of London, wherever in short the climate or the devil tempts men to
fall from the true belief which is her own — is even now engaged in dashing down shrines, smashing idols, and setting
up in their place her own stern countenance. Conversion is her name and she feasts on the wills of the weakly, loving
to impress, to impose, adoring her own features stamped on the face of the populace. At Hyde Park Corner on a tub she
stands preaching; shrouds herself in white and walks penitentially disguised as brotherly love through factories and
parliaments; offers help, but desires power; smites out of her way roughly the dissentient, or dissatisfied; bestows
her blessing on those who, looking upward, catch submissively from her eyes the light of their own. This lady too
(Rezia Warren Smith divined it) had her dwelling in Sir William’s heart, though concealed, as she mostly is, under some
plausible disguise; some venerable name; love, duty, self sacrifice. How he would work — how toil to raise funds,
propagate reforms, initiate institutions! But conversion, fastidious Goddess, loves blood better than brick, and feasts
most subtly on the human will. For example, Lady Bradshaw. Fifteen years ago she had gone under. It was nothing you
could put your finger on; there had been no scene, no snap; only the slow sinking, water-logged, of her will into his.
Sweet was her smile, swift her submission; dinner in Harley Street, numbering eight or nine courses, feeding ten or
fifteen guests of the professional classes, was smooth and urbane. Only as the evening wore on a very slight dulness,
or uneasiness perhaps, a nervous twitch, fumble, stumble and confusion indicated, what it was really painful to believe
— that the poor lady lied. Once, long ago, she had caught salmon freely: now, quick to minister to the craving which
lit her husband’s eye so oilily for dominion, for power, she cramped, squeezed, pared, pruned, drew back, peeped
through; so that without knowing precisely what made the evening disagreeable, and caused this pressure on the top of
the head (which might well be imputed to the professional conversation, or the fatigue of a great doctor whose life,
Lady Bradshaw said, “is not his own but his patients’”) disagreeable it was: so that guests, when the clock struck ten,
breathed in the air of Harley Street even with rapture; which relief, however, was denied to his patients."|"Mrs. Dalloway"|"Virginia Woolf"
"ap 01:30"|"half-past one"|"Shredding and slicing, dividing and subdividing, the clocks of Harley Street nibbled at the June day, counselled
submission, upheld authority, and pointed out in chorus the supreme advantages of a sense of proportion, until the
mound of time was so far diminished that a commercial clock, suspended above a shop in Oxford Street, announced,
genially and fraternally, as if it were a pleasure to Messrs. Rigby and Lowndes to give the information gratis, that it
was half-past one."|"Mrs. Dalloway"|"Virginia Woolf"
"ap 01:30"|one-thirty|"And so there began a soundless and exquisite passing to and fro through swing doors of aproned white-capped maids,
handmaidens not of necessity, but adepts in a mystery or grand deception practised by hostesses in Mayfair from
one-thirty to two, when, with a wave of the hand, the traffic ceases, and there rises instead this profound illusion in
the first place about the food — how it is not paid for; and then that the table spreads itself voluntarily with glass
and silver, little mats, saucers of red fruit; films of brown cream mask turbot; in casseroles severed chickens swim;
coloured, undomestic, the fire burns; and with the wine and the coffee (not paid for) rise jocund visions before musing
eyes; gently speculative eyes; eyes to whom life appears musical, mysterious; eyes now kindled to observe genially the
beauty of the red carnations which Lady Bruton (whose movements were always angular) had laid beside her plate, so that
Hugh Whitbread, feeling at peace with the entire universe and at the same time completely sure of his standing, said,
resting his fork,"|"Mrs. Dalloway"|"Virginia Woolf"
"ap 03:00"|Three|"But why should she invite all the dull women in London to her parties? Why should Mrs. Marsham interfere? And there
was Elizabeth closeted all this time with Doris Kilman. Anything more nauseating she could not conceive. Prayer at this
hour with that woman. And the sound of the bell flooded the room with its melancholy wave; which receded, and gathered
itself together to fall once more, when she heard, distractingly, something fumbling, something scratching at the door.
Who at this hour? Three, good Heavens! Three already! For with overpowering directness and dignity the clock struck
three; and she heard nothing else; but the door handle slipped round and in came Richard! What a surprise! In came
Richard, holding out flowers. She had failed him, once at Constantinople; and Lady Bruton, whose lunch parties were
said to be extraordinarily amusing, had not asked her. He was holding out flowers — roses, red and white roses. (But he
could not bring himself to say he loved her; not in so many words.)"|"Mrs. Dalloway"|"Virginia Woolf"
"ap 02:00"|two|"Love — but here the other clock, the clock which always struck two minutes after Big Ben, came shuffling in with its
lap full of odds and ends, which it dumped down as if Big Ben were all very well with his majesty laying down the law,
so solemn, so just, but she must remember all sorts of little things besides — Mrs. Marsham, Ellie Henderson, glasses
for ices — all sorts of little things came flooding and lapping and dancing in on the wake of that solemn stroke which
lay flat like a bar of gold on the sea. Mrs. Marsham, Ellie Henderson, glasses for ices. She must telephone now at
once."|"Mrs. Dalloway"|"Virginia Woolf"
"~ 03:00"|"about three o’clock in the
morning"|"Buses swooped, settled, were off — garish caravans, glistening with red and yellow varnish. But which should she get
on to? She had no preferences. Of course, she would not push her way. She inclined to be passive. It was expression she
needed, but her eyes were fine, Chinese, oriental, and, as her mother said, with such nice shoulders and holding
herself so straight, she was always charming to look at; and lately, in the evening especially, when she was
interested, for she never seemed excited, she looked almost beautiful, very stately, very serene. What could she be
thinking? Every man fell in love with her, and she was really awfully bored. For it was beginning. Her mother could see
that — the compliments were beginning. That she did not care more about it — for instance for her clothes — sometimes
worried Clarissa, but perhaps it was as well with all those puppies and guinea pigs about having distemper, and it gave
her a charm. And now there was this odd friendship with Miss Kilman. Well, thought Clarissa about three o’clock in the
morning, reading Baron Marbot for she could not sleep, it proves she has a heart."|"Mrs. Dalloway"|"Virginia Woolf"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"To get that letter to him by six o’clock she must have sat down and written it directly he left her; stamped it;
sent somebody to the post. It was, as people say, very like her. She was upset by his visit. She had felt a great deal;
had for a moment, when she kissed his hand, regretted, envied him even, remembered possibly (for he saw her look it)
something he had said — how they would change the world if she married him perhaps; whereas, it was this; it was middle
age; it was mediocrity; then forced herself with her indomitable vitality to put all that aside, there being in her a
thread of life which for toughness, endurance, power to overcome obstacles, and carry her triumphantly through he had
never known the like of. Yes; but there would come a reaction directly he left the room. She would be frightfully sorry
for him; she would think what in the world she could do to give him pleasure (short always of the one thing) and he
could see her with the tears running down her cheeks going to her writing-table and dashing off that one line which he
was to find greeting him. . . . “Heavenly to see you!” And she meant it."|"Mrs. Dalloway"|"Virginia Woolf"
00:00|midnight|"Lord, Lord, what a change had come over her! the softness of motherhood; its egotism too. Last time they met, Peter
remembered, had been among the cauliflowers in the moonlight, the leaves “like rough bronze” she had said, with her
literary turn; and she had picked a rose. She had marched him up and down that awful night, after the scene by the
fountain; he was to catch the midnight train. Heavens, he had wept!"|"Mrs. Dalloway"|"Virginia Woolf"
