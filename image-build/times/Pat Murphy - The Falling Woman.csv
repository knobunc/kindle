"~ 00:00"|"about
  midnight"|"My memories of the past two weeks were hazy, but some moments stood out clearly. I remember the night before my father’s funeral. I could not sleep, and at some point, around about
  midnight I think, I got the bottle of Scotch from my father’s liquor cabinet, and I started drinking. The liquor did not stop the noise in my head, but the buzz of the alcohol helped drown
  out the nagging voices that told me about how badly I was behaving, about how ashamed my father would be to see me. I turned on the television and idly flipped from station to station, never
  lingering beyond the first commercial, until only one station remained on the air, playing old movies until dawn."|"The Falling Woman"|"Pat Murphy"
06:00|"six AM"|"Tony grinned at me over his drink. ‘She didn’t tell you that you’ll have to get up at six AM.’"|"The Falling Woman"|"Pat Murphy"
12:00|noon|"At noon, when the disc of the sun fills the well with light, only one messenger floats on the water. The others are gone, taken down by the Chaacob to the submarine rooms beneath the
  water’s smooth surface. The priests draw out this survivor, who has returned to tell the message of the gods, bringing the prophecy for the coming year."|"The Falling Woman"|"Pat Murphy"
05:00|"five in the morning"|"In the dim lantern light, I could see only the outlines of the huts. The trilling of the insects in the monte seemed to match some internal rhythm, and I knew with a certainty born of experience
  that if I went to my hut now, I would not sleep. I would watch the shadows on the ceiling swaying as my hammock swayed, and wait until the morning came. I had learned, at times like this, to wait
  it out. Alcohol would put me out for a time, but when I drank myself to sleep I woke at five in the morning, feeling stony-eyed and wide awake. Sleeping pills would put me out – the
  university physician had prescribed some for my bouts with insomnia – but I did not like to resort to drugs. A pill would shut the lights out, as surely as a pillow forced down over my face,
  and there would be nothing I could do to chase the darkness away."|"The Falling Woman"|"Pat Murphy"
"ap 06:00"|six|"I clearly remembered the day that I did not go walking. Diane was five and sick with the flu. I stayed home to nurse her, pacing within the apartment. It was August and the temperature was
  holding steady at over 100 degrees, a heat wave that the TV weatherman kept promising would end. After hours of fussing and complaining, Diane was asleep. Robert was working a late shift at the
  hospital. I sat at the kitchen table on a wooden chair that wobbled. It was hot, too hot, and I had been drinking beer all afternoon with a neighbor, a slatternly woman who had nothing good to say
  about anyone. I had been drinking with her only because I could not stand being alone. I was twenty-six years old, and it seemed wrong to sit alone drinking beer after beer. But at six, when the
  neighbor left, I kept drinking cold beer and staring at the walls."|"The Falling Woman"|"Pat Murphy"
"ap 08:00"|8:00|"On my first morning in camp I woke to the sound of a blaring car horn. The clock on the footlocker said it was 8:00. Already the air was hot. Barbara’s and Robin’s
  hammocks were empty. Maggie was still asleep, curled up with the sheet pulled over her head. I felt more relaxed than I had in months, and I resolved, lying in my hammock, to adopt Tony’s
  easygoing attitude and take things as they came."|"The Falling Woman"|"Pat Murphy"
06:00|"six in the morning"|"Even at six in the morning the air was warm. Lizards basked on the rocks, running a few feet as we approached, then stopping to watch us."|"The Falling Woman"|"Pat Murphy"
12:00|noon|"‘The h’menob did not expect me to survive. They would have been glad to pull out one of the others – the slave, the noblewoman, the beautiful boy. But the others had not
  enjoyed floating in the sky. They were done with their crying and only I remained. At noon, when the sun rose over the lip of the well, I lifted my hands and welcomed it. The h’menob pulled
  me from the water, reluctantly, I thought, and roughly, considering how holy I had become."|"The Falling Woman"|"Pat Murphy"
00:00|midnight|"I glanced at the clock on the shelf. The luminous dial showed midnight. ‘I’ll walk you to your hut,’ I said. ‘Survey comes early tomorrow.’"|"The Falling Woman"|"Pat Murphy"
"ap 07:30"|Seven-thirty|"‘Seven-thirty,’ she whispered back. She leaned back in the hammock, one hand tucked under her head."|"The Falling Woman"|"Pat Murphy"
"ap > 03:00"|"just past three"|"‘I like that one,’ I said to Barbara, pointing out a very pretty burgundy-colored shawl with a painted floral border. The woman who sat in the stall called to us, smiling and
  beckoning. She had gold earrings that matched her gold tooth and she seemed fascinated by my hair and determined to sell me the shawl. I bargained in bad Spanish and, I think, ended up paying too
  much for the shawl. Barbara bought a white dress that was embroidered with a pattern of dark blue squares. It was just past three when we headed back to the hotel."|"The Falling Woman"|"Pat Murphy"
"ap 01:15"|"quarter past one"|"I stood in the doorway of my hut, looking out across the plaza. Though my watch said quarter past one, a burning lantern still hung from the corrugated tin roof that sheltered a small area just
  in front of Tony’s hut. I pulled on my clothes, knowing it would be hours before I could sleep again, and crossed the plaza."|"The Falling Woman"|"Pat Murphy"
"> 00:00"|"A little after midnight"|"A little after midnight, I returned to my home. Sitting at my desk in the cramped ill-furnished one-bedroom apartment, looking at the flowered wallpaper and the ugly green rug, I worked on my
  thesis project, reading and taking meticulous notes. At dawn I went to the campus library so that I would be there when it opened, and I passed an Indian hunting party on my way. When Tony returned
  from his honeymoon, I welcomed him back and we picked up our friendship without a hitch."|"The Falling Woman"|"Pat Murphy"
"< 12:00"|"Just before noon"|"Just before noon, as Salvador’s crew was digging a depression in which the stela could rest once it was upright, the survey crew came tromping through the monte. The end point of their
  latest transect was about a mile away, so they had decided to join us for the raising of the stela. Diane looked cheerful enough, smiling even though her legs were covered with insect bites and
  scratches."|"The Falling Woman"|"Pat Murphy"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"The workmen stayed late on Thursday, but at five o’clock it was clear that we would not remove another stone that day. We stopped then, covered the opening with a tarp, and reluctantly
  left the site."|"The Falling Woman"|"Pat Murphy"
12:00|noon|"On Friday, Tony went with me to the site. By noon, the workmen had loosened and removed another stone, making an opening large enough for me to slide through on my belly, pushing my flashlight
  before me."|"The Falling Woman"|"Pat Murphy"
"ap 01:30"|one-thirty|"I walked. I didn’t go to the market; I wasn’t up for the crowds. I wandered around the zocalo, bought a lemon ice from a sidewalk vendor, and sat down on a bench near the cathedral
  to eat it. The clock on the Municipal Palace said it was one-thirty, but it seemed much later. The air was heavy with the promise of rain."|"The Falling Woman"|"Pat Murphy"
