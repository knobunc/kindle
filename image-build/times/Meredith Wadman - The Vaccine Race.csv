After the operation she remained in the hospital. The chronic respiratory infections continued. The baby was sixteen months old and weighed eleven pounds when she died of pneumonia at 3:30 a.m. on February 18, 1966.

Silverman was a charming, ambitious young entrepreneur and a relative newcomer to denture design. Nathan Hayflick was by now a master craftsman, but not a businessman. The partnership turned into a disaster as the two men’s personalities clashed. Nathan Hayflick fell into a depression that concerned his son so much that Leonard Hayflick began cutting classes, leaving Penn at midday to cross the river and take his father to lunch in order to get him out of the lab for a couple of hours."|"The Vaccine Race"|"Meredith Wadman"

Once, when a young Wistar scientist named Michael Katz failed to win NIH funding for a grant, Koprowski, who wanted Katz doing other work, celebrated the failure to the young man’s face: “Congratulations! Now you can devote yourself to real science.” Stung, Katz told Koprowski to go do something that was anatomically impossible. He was summoned to Koprowski’s office at 5:00 p.m. that same day. The young man walked in fully expecting to be fired. Koprowski was sitting behind his desk with a twinkle in his eye and a pitcher of ice-cold martinis in front of him. “Olive or lemon peel?” he inquired."|"The Vaccine Race"|"Meredith Wadman"

(By this point Hayflick was working only with lungs because they were readily dissected and their fibroblasts seemed particularly hardy in culture.) It’s also possible that those lungs didn’t work out. Perhaps delays caused them to die in transit, or perhaps they were inadvertently infected. Because scarcely one week later Herrström recorded in her diary that she had shipped more tissue, from a new fetus, to Philadelphia: “Tissue to the USA at 12 (noon). Took all morning to prepare.”"|"The Vaccine Race"|"Meredith Wadman"
"ap 23:49"|"eleven of twelve"|"A few months later researchers from the Medical Research Council Laboratories in London reported in the British Medical Journal that they had found antibodies against the SV40 virus in eleven of twelve schoolboys who had received the full slate of three Salk injections. The presence of antibodies did not mean that the virus was alive and replicating in the boys—the whole principle of injecting a killed vaccine is that the body forms antibodies even to a dead virus. The boys might well have received dead SV40 with their Salk injections. But the presence of SV40 antibodies in eleven of the twelve boys was an alarming indication of just how widely SV40 might have infiltrated the supply of Salk vaccine. And the more widespread it was, the more likely that some vaccinees had received injections in which the virus had survived alive."|"The Vaccine Race"|"Meredith Wadman"

Baby Stephen weighed five pounds, thirteen ounces and was nineteen inches long. (This was less than the 10th percentile for weight and about the 17th percentile for length.)

"ap 03:00"|three|"Anna underwent corrective heart surgery at eleven weeks of age. Several years later she would require another heart surgery to replace one of her heart valves. Postoperative complications after the first surgery led to a tracheostomy—a hole cut into her windpipe, on the front of her neck, through which she breathed for the first three years of her life. She had cataract surgeries at three and five months of age and later multiple eye surgeries to extract scar tissue and to reattach a detached retina. She was also put under anesthesia several times so that doctors could take pressure measurements for glaucoma, raised pressure inside the eye. Glaucoma affected both of Anna’s eyes, as it had those of Stephen Wenzler, the boy born with congenital rubella in Toms River, New Jersey, in 1964."|"The Vaccine Race"|"Meredith Wadman"

The cells incubate at 86 degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature that Stanley Plotkin discovered long ago would weaken the RA 27/3 vaccine virus just enough, but not too much. After several days the virus-laden medium that will become the vaccine is harvested, pooled, and filtered several times to remove the larger cellular debris of the WI-38 cells. Each batch of vaccine fills most of a sixty-six-gallon, stainless-steel tank; each will be safety-tested on a long list of parameters on which the FDA must sign off.

Lynn had a shaved head and bulging biceps and declared of his long hours working behind goggles, hood, and mask: “You’re helping children. To me, there’s nothing really better than that.” They also included an engineer and molecular biologist, Vic Johnston, who looked to be in his forties and who is an expert on the rubella vaccine. It was Johnston who explained to me that it was 2008 when Merck last retrieved a single sterile ampule of WI-38 cells from the scores of vaccine-ready ampules held at the American Type Culture Collection.

By contrast, the study that found ten of ten embryos affected, published in the Lancet in 1988, was prospective: scientists followed the pregnancies from the time of the diagnosis of rubella in the mother in early pregnancy and tracked the babies’ outcomes."|"The Vaccine Race"|"Meredith Wadman"
