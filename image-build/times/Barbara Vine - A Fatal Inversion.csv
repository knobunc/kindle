Adam looked up and saw Zosie appear in the doorway, look around her until she saw him, then pull the door to behind her. This was her second day at Ecalpemos. She wore her jeans, which she had cut off a good six inches above the knees and frayed the hems, a white cotton vest he thought might have been Hilbert’s, and a pair of pink espadrilles through which her toes had made holes. Her exposed skin, of which there was a good deal, was a uniform pale biscuit color and her hair was this color, too, and her eyebrows and her lips. Her eyes themselves were a little darker, the color, he thought, as she approached the cage, of milkless tea. A good tea, Earl Grey perhaps. She looked at him gravely and then she smiled, showing small, very white teeth. Adam thought he had never seen such a small girl with such long legs. There was a slight but attractive disproportion here, so that for a moment Zosie seemed less like a real girl than some artist’s impression of an ideal, the legs longer, the neck more fragile and attenuated, the waist extravagantly narrower than could have been in nature."|"A Fatal Inversion"|"Barbara Vine"

She looked like a minor character in a Rosetti painting, one of the maidens holding up the canopy in Dante’s Dream perhaps, not at all the prospective nanny. This picture was one of the few Rufus could actually recognize. A reproduction of it hung in his parents’ house and, curiously enough, now in his. Marigold, the first time he took her home, expressed enthusiasm, fervor, for this painting. Afterward she told him she was just being polite. But the result was that his mother gave it to Marigold as part of her wedding present and it now hung in a corner of the hall.

The road where he parked was a sort of continuation of the road where Vivien was going to work, but I think that was just coincidence. I went there once, months afterward, it had a sort of fascination for me; dreadful though it all was, I wanted to see for myself.

It had given them an illusion of nighttime but it wasn’t night, it wasn’t even evening but three in the afternoon. He had gone to the window and looked out on a gray and purple sky, where the clouds were mountain ranges capped with snow. Like the Himalayas, warm and close in the foothills, clear and icy on those distant peaks. A tree of lightning grew out of the blue horizon, branches forking through the cumulus, and the thunder cracked this time, a sound like gunfire."|"A Fatal Inversion"|"Barbara Vine"

It was rather as if these sounds were visited upon him as a kind of retribution because he had agreed to Shiva’s suggestion. All sorts of fanciful ideas came to one in the night. At this hour it was quite possible to believe the dead child’s spirit made those soft delicate clicks through the medium of Anne’s slightly parted lips. Or, more readily if one understood about guilt and fear, that Anne never made them at all, that there were no sounds, they did not exist, but that his fevered imagination recreated them from that night ten years ago when at last the rain came and the air grew cold. When he lay listening to the rain fall and abate and fall again and then to the baby’s breathing, the occasional just audible click, the whimper which seemed a threat of crying that never came."|"A Fatal Inversion"|"Barbara Vine"

The baby didn’t cry, or if it did we didn’t hear it. Zosie came down to the kitchen for some milk just as I was thinking of going to bed. She was just like a young mother, she was changed, happy and practical and looking tired. I lay awake for a long time and so did Vivien. We talked and she kept saying how relieved she was they’d taken the kiddy back. She wanted to know where they had taken her, what plans they had made. They would be sure to have taken her somewhere safe, wouldn’t they? Did I think they would have thought of phoning the parents to let them know? All that sort of thing.

He would have been surprised and even angry if the baby had disturbed him in the night or wakened him early, but he wasn’t at all troubled by these things not taking place. Nine years afterward, when he was married and Abigail was newly born, he scarcely slept, he was too afraid, and when he grew hopelessly exhausted and fell into a doze he would wake and jump up in horror, certain Abigail had died while he slept. For nearly three months, until Abigail had passed the age of Catherine Ryemark, he had made Anne take turns with him in staying awake to watch over her. Or, rather, he had tried to make Anne take turns, and it was her unwilling halfhearted compliance and her ridiculing of his fears that had caused so much damage to their marriage. It made an abyss between them, only Adam knew that it was his own past experience and personal knowledge that had really caused this rift."|"A Fatal Inversion"|"Barbara Vine"

The idea dismayed him, and if he had not clenched his hands and set his teeth, panic would have taken hold of him. He turned the television on again and made himself watch a quiz show. At about a quarter to nine he went out into the hall and picked up the letter to Sabine Schnitzler. There was no stamp on it. Shiva had a stamp in his wallet, he had several, eighteens and thirteens. Neither would be sufficient for a letter to Switzerland, but two thirteens would be enough. He stuck two thirteen-pence stamps on the envelope and thought, suppose she is writing to her mother to ask if she can come to her when she has left me, I should be carrying, so to speak, my own death warrant to the executioner.

The body could not be seen, for it was sealed up in a tiny coffin of walnut veneered in a flame pattern. Lilian and Hilbert looked less like themselves, or after a time began to look less like themselves than like the parents in the picture.

Any white spirit would do for him, he wasn’t fussy, and he poured himself a stiff vodka, some of that Polish stuff they had brought back from their Black Sea summer holiday.

Lewis pressed Adam to accompany him on those solicitous weekend visits but Adam nearly always said he was too busy or would be bored. There had in fact been only one occasion during those last years that Lewis could remember, and he was sure Adam had only gone because there had been a promise of some shooting. The visit had been far from successful, for Adam had sulked when offered the four-ten, the so-called “lady’s gun.” Sometimes, since then, Lewis had wondered what would have happened if Adam had obeyed him and been kind and polite to the perverse old man.

Adam looked back at the house, at the honeysuckle that curtained the back of it in yellow and pink, at the martins, sharp-pinioned, that wheeled in and out from the eaves. He was in a state of tremulous excitement. He seemed only to be able to breathe shallowly. It was curiously sexual, this feeling, exactly the way he had once or twice felt with a girl he was mad to make love to and who he thought would let him but was not quite sure, not absolutely sure. The slightest thing would turn his fortune, snatch it, send him home frustrated, bitter, in a sick rage. He felt like that now. If only he could breathe properly!

What they had eventually decided to sell before they went to bed that night (or the following morning really) were Great-Uncle Hilbert’s dozen Waterford sherry glasses. As Adam said, none of them drank sherry and he didn’t know anyone under fifty who did. Having wandered all over the house, they had ended up in the dining room, where the cabinet full of glass was. In another cupboard they found half a bottle of whiskey and a dribble of brandy in the bottom of a Courvoisier bottle. There had been something extraordinarily delightful and exhilarating about sitting at that big oval mahogany table drinking whiskey at two o’clock in the morning. The moon had come up and laid a greenish iridescence on the surface of the lake. It was so bright it made the stars disappear. They had to close the window because of the insects. Then they turned out the lights, the great brass chandelier with its false candles, and the moon’s lemony radiance lay as still as cloths draped over the shining wood. Adam set the twelve sherry glasses that were cut in a Greek key pattern around their rims in the middle of the moonlight and said he would put them in a box tomorrow and try to sell them in Sudbury to the man who had the antique shop in Gainsborough Street that they had passed."|"A Fatal Inversion"|"Barbara Vine"

So many times he had padded across this bedroom to go to Abigail that he knew it perfectly in the dark, only requiring to hold his hands out before him, and like a blind man feel the beveled corner of the wardrobe, the lacquered wicker of a chair back, the top of the radiator, cold at this hour, the glass sphere of the doorknob."|"A Fatal Inversion"|"Barbara Vine"

It had been more roundabout than that but that was basically it. She and Rufus and Adam himself had all been putting forward the names of people they knew who might want to be part of a commune, likely people of the right sort of age and the right sort of temperament. Mary herself was quite keen, stipulating though that she would stay only if Rufus did not. Since his sly suggestions of Thursday midnight, she had been unremittingly at war with him, though they still ostensibly shared a bed. In fact, Rufus had taken mostly to sleeping outdoors. He had no intention, he said, of being part of a permanent commune, he had his medical degree to get, but he might think of coming there for his holidays. He upset Mary further by saying he thought Adam’s sister Bridget very attractive and it would be an inducement to him if she became one of the members."|"A Fatal Inversion"|"Barbara Vine"

Shiva walked through, stepping over people asleep on mattresses on the floor. No one in that squat except Vivien ever got up before midday.
