"< 00:00"|"nearly midnight"|"‘Oh dear, oh me,’ muttered Tomsk and returned to his work. It really was back-breaking work too, because, although he and Omsk laboured from before dawn until well into the rush hour (with all its smelly petrol fumes) and again from dusk until nearly midnight, the birds and quite a number of the fish in the waters of Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens were still choking and gasping and poisoning themselves, not only with all the Pollu that was regularly being dumped in their feeding grounds, but also with the extra rubbish from the Pop Festival."|"The Wombles at Work"|"Elisabeth Beresford"
06:00|"six o’clock in the morning"|"Bungo’s journey back to the burrow followed a somewhat zigzag path and, had he but known it, a startled motorist driving across the bridge over the Serpentine thought for a moment that he must have gone quite mad. After all, Human Beings do not expect to see at six o’clock in the morning a sheet of hardboard with small furry legs. The motorist drew into the side of the road and mopped his forehead and then his eyes grew even rounder because, in spite of the early morning mist, he was quite certain that he could see a swan walking up and down like a sentry with rows and rows of fish watching its progress, their heads turning from right to left as they did so."|"The Wombles at Work"|"Elisabeth Beresford"
