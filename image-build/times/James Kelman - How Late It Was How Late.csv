"> 02:00"|"after two in the morning"|"Fair enough but he just wanted her to know he was okay. So he went home to show the face. Except when he got there she was gone. And the kitchen was a fucking pigsty like she had fuckt off as soon as she was up and dressed. Which is fair enough cause she didnay finish work till late and sometimes wasnay home till after two in the morning. So if she just got off her mark then she was fucking entitled. Fuck the housework. With him no working anyway I mean, what does it matter, Sammy was happy doing that sort of stuff. Plus the fact it was her house, it’s no as if he had any claim for being there, except her, so he needed to be pulling his weight and all that. At least that was the way he looked at it. So when he got home on Friday dinnertime he just stuck on the music. Loud, the way he liked it. Then he set about the tidying. But once he had finished the money burnt a hole in his pocket, he couldnay settle; he tried to read a book, he shoved on the telly; he just couldnay concentrate. Plus he was starving. But cause he had done all that tidying he didnay want to fucking mess it back up again so he wasnay gony cook fuck all. So he just went back out, thinking in terms of a pie and a pint. Across the river and along the road, up the main drag and round to the Cross, and along and up by Argyle Street where he found the Leg and they went on a spree,"|"How Late It Was How Late"|"James Kelman"
"ap ~ 03:00"|"about three"|"But where the hell was he where the hell was he! he was down the road, that was where he was, and he couldnay get lost cause it wasnay possible, okay; it was a corner, the space, he was at a space and it was a corner, it was the next corner, it was the one down from The Blazer, so that was fine, it was okay, it wasnay a real corner – street, it wasnay a real street, a real junction – so that was fine if ye just slowed down, if there was a magic carpet which there wasnay so ye just stood there, okay, Sammy, he just stood there. He got his breath back. It was a straight road. He had come in a straight line and from here on it was that same line, cause that same line, it would take him to the block of flats, to the wee turnoff ower the bridge, eventually, that was where it would lead him. Even if he had the dough for a taxi the driver wouldnay want to take him, it was too close, he would just say, Get to fuck! That was what he would say, cause it was so close. Ye’re too close for a taxi, it’s just a five-minute walk; that was what the guy would say, so it was fine, he just had crossings to go, about three to the main junction, the big five-wayer; once across there it was plain sailing man plain sailing, so okay, batter on, just batter on. He stepped forwards from the corner, his two arms raised and moving from side to side, his right foot doing the feeling, tapping out the way, and he touched a thing, a pole, good, the edge of the pavement. It wasnay a real street this it was more like a lane and hardly any traffic went down it at all. He heard people passing. He could get help if he wanted, but he didnay need it; he would need it later, but no the now, it was best no trying for it the now; because"|"How Late It Was How Late"|"James Kelman"

Sammy went early to give himself a better chance of getting an appointment for Monday. Any bus from the main drag took him. At the corner of the street he tapped his way along. It was the second close. When he got near he kept his hand patacaking the tenement wall till he arrived inside. People queuing outside the door. He had the shades on, tapping forward slowly so if he did hit somebody it wouldnay be hard. His foot kicked an empty can. A woman spoke to him. She sounded auld.

He took off the shades and rubbed behind his ears, especially the right one which was sore, although it was the left yin giving him the noise problems; but there ye go.
Ten forty-five, she said.

"~ 07:00"|"about seven in the morning"|"So the guy’s been invisible for at least two months; the only thing he’s allowed to do is put a line on in the betting shop now and again. But even that’s a fucking rigmarole cause ye’ve got to be wary there as well. So anyway, he’s fucking sick of it. What he does he bolts the course for a day at the races; the full wad in the tail; two or three grand he was holding. So he’s only in the gaff ten minutes and he’s latched onto this bird. He was a sharp dresser Jackie; quite a good-looking guy. Probably too the patter, him being a Scouse and all that. But what happens but he backs the first four winners. No kidding ye man in the space of an hour and a half he’s went ten or twelve grand in front. Ye’re talking twenty year ago, know what I mean. So the lassie, she’s totally straight. She’s only at the track on some kind of works’ outing. She’s never met a cunt like him afore, never. What happens then, after the racing, yer man, he’s looking about, itchy fingers and all that. A game of cards man that’s what he’s looking for. So he jumps a taxi and tells the guy to take them to Aberdeen. Now the lassie’s married. She isnay wanting to go to Aberdeen, she cannay; she’s got to get home and all that. But Jackie’s persuaded her, he’s telt her he’s got a message to go but it isnay a problem cause there’s a last plane home and they’ll catch that; nay danger. I mean there’s nay fucking plane, no that he knew about. The way it was, the way Jackie saw it, about Aberdeen and all that it was his only chance. It’s now or never, know what I’m saying; he’s out this once, there’s no gony be a second time. And he doesnay want the bold fellow, the name-guy in Glasgow, he doesnay want him finding out. So he’s got to be back first thing in the morning, the crack of dawn. Ye see Edinburgh was nay good; too close, too risky; and he couldnay hit Newcastle either cause that’s even riskier, the way he saw it anyway man it being England and all that. He telt Sammy he thought about going to Deauville in France but it was too tricky, too many hassles. Whatever, it had to be the now, right fucking now; he’s got the dough and he’s got the bird. So Aberdeen, on the taxi, whatever the fuck that costs. They book into a hotel; five-star room service and all that man the salmon sandwiches and the bottle of champagne; a quick shag and a shower then out. He finds this casino; he’s got to drop the doorman cause of the 48 hour membership thing. But he gets it settled. Then he can relax. Whatever man it’s done, know what I’m saying, that’s that; from here on man fuck sake anything, okay, so he takes the lassie back out to this high-class restaurant, no for nay reason, they’re no really that hungry I dont think it’s just fucking part of it, giving the lassie a bit of a go; so they have a drink and a meal and all that, etcetera. Then the casino. Jackie wasnay interested in roulette nor fuck all, blackjack; nayn of that crap; poker was his game and he’s heard stories about wild money off the rigs. He’s hoping to score an introduction. That’s the main reason how he’s there, at the casino. So he’s sniffing about. Now ye’ve got to mind as well, never mind it’s Aberdeen man he’s got to be wary, there’s some heavy people looking for him, and we’re no talking about the sodjers. Anyway, one thing and another, he scores a contact; some big Canadian cowboy; there is a game but it’s outside the city, up the coast a few miles. Nay bother, the cowboy gives them a lift. Cut a long story short they get to the house and Jackie gets wiped out. The way he telt Sammy he’s unlucky but who knows; they were playing stud and all that and there was the big last hand and he gets fuckt on the last card out the pack. Whatever. It’s all fucking legit but so he’s got nay grumbles. He comes out the house about seven in the morning and starts hoofing it. He’s got about three quid in the tail and he’s keeping it for emergencies. So he’s well down the road and he remembers the bird; she’s back in the house man she’s still waiting, sound asleep on a chair in one of the rooms. But fuck it what can he do he’s skint, he’s fucking stony, right out the game; she’s better off making it herself, the way his luck was running. The worst of it was the couple of grand he started the day with, it wasnay his – well it was, but mostly it was earmarked; one thing and another; going invisible isnay cheap man know what I’m saying. So he’s desperate; half of fucking Britain’s after him, he doesnay need the other half. So at the wind-up he’s made contact with Sammy and ye’ve got to say Sammy’s a wee bit chuffed, him being only 19 at the time, just turned. It so happens him and his mates used to hang about in one of the betting shops Jackie went to. Ach well, fuck it, so a couple of days later they’re captured, the Lake District, roundabout there, nay point prolonging the agony. Sammy got four and done four. Auld Jackie, copped for the lot, the London stuff and the rest."|"How Late It Was How Late"|"James Kelman"
23:50|"10 till midnight"|"He was using the radio to time himself. A good programme started from 10 till midnight and he was just gony lie there steeping and enjoy it. Then the auld fucking beard man the stubble, it was gony be at the hairy stage if he didnay watch it, and that would be tricky. He had a bit of a sensitive neck at the best of times. When he was a boy he couldnay shave without leaving scars and rashes all ower the place. Which wasnay helped by the auld man insisting Sammy used these ancient efforts where the blades came separate and sometimes if ye hadnay fastened them down right it was fucking murder polis man telling you blood flying everywhere. Sammy’s brother didnay have to cope with it, cause Sammy had fought the battles and he just took the victories, by the time he started shaving the auld man had gave up the struggle and he was dished up a packet of fucking disposables."|"How Late It Was How Late"|"James Kelman"
"ap 10:00"|"10 o’clock"|"He turned on the cold again then got the clothes off. He climbed in using both hands on the rim of the bath, visions of misjudging it and his foot getting stuck and tripping. The 10 o’clock news roundup was on the radio. The usual shit. Plus the water was still too fucking hot and he had to run in even more cold afore able to kneel down.

"ap 01:00"|one|"Aaahhh – the only problem being how ye’re so vulnerable, just so relaxed, the ideal time for some cunt to reach ye – how easy it was, the ideal time, the ideal place, and he didnay have one weapon to hand; not one. He hadnay even shut the bathroom door. He hadnay snibbed the front door either more to the point. Hell with it man it wasnay a worry. But ye made wrong moves in life. It couldnay be denied. It was naybody’s fault either, sometimes ye felt strong and ye battered on and done something. And it turned out wrong. Ye werenay as strong as ye thought. That happened a lot. So ye had to be on yer guard. Cause ye wound up getting soft; lackadaisical, know what I’m saying, ye took things for granted. Fucking stupit. One thing about this no-seeing carry on, it was a lesson, a hard fucking lesson. Once it came back things would change. And it was him gony do it. She had been wrong ower the argument. The one on Friday morning: it wasnay her place to tell him he couldnay go out earning. She had a job so she made a few quid. He didnay. Fucking simple as that man know what I mean, basic economics. She had been out of order. She didnay have an argument. A pittance once a fortnight. How could ye live on it ye couldnay. She said it was alright cause she had her dough coming in but fuck it man ye’re no gony kip up with a bird and then fucking let her pay for everything; he was never a ponce, yer man, that was one thing, he wasnay a poncing bastard."|"How Late It Was How Late"|"James Kelman"

So just for the record: here ye have a guy with the kind of form he has, and he’s no a mug when it comes to punting; now he walks into a betting shop and wins a few quid on a bunch of horses he says he doesnay know the names of; and then he calls it a day roundabout three o’clock on a Friday afternoon, when there’s still all sorts of racing left. Plus he’s done it in one of two betting shops in Queen Street and they’re gony have a record of the day’s transactions unless they’re working flankers for tax-purposes, and yer man here, well, a bright guy like him, he’s bound to know that, he’s bound to know these betting receipts are gony be lying there if anybody wants to go and check… Then he walked half a mile for a drink when there was pubs on every corner along the route.
