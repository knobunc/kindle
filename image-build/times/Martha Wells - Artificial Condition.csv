"ap > 03:00"|"After three"|"So we watched Worldhoppers. It didnâ€™t complain about the lack of realism. After three episodes, it got agitated whenever a minor character was killed. When a major character died in the twentieth episode I had to pause seven minutes while it sat there in the feed doing the bot equivalent of staring at a wall, pretending that it had to run diagnostics. Then four episodes later the character came back to life and it was so relieved we had to watch that episode three times before it would go on."|"Artificial Condition"|"Martha Wells"
