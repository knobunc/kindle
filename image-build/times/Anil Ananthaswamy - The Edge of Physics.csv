He picked me up at my hotel in Pasadena, and we drove along the Angeles Crest Highway, whose construction began in 1929, well after the 100-inch was completed. We broke through the lower bank of clouds, and Don pointed to a turnoff ahead—where the highway went over a notch in the hills—that would take us to the observatory. The sun-drenched scenery did not last long; we entered another layer of clouds, and this time there was no breaking through. We reached the observatory's campus still enveloped in mist, and Don parked his car next to the galley, a small building where astronomers eat their midnight meals. Ahead of us was a footbridge spanning a shallow ravine, and across the bridge, in the rainy haze, loomed the dome of the venerable 100-inch telescope."|"The Edge of Physics"|"Anil Ananthaswamy"

All around us was evidence of a cold winter: snow piled up on the sides of roads, sometimes a few feet high. We walked across the footbridge to the galley to eat the sandwiches we had brought with us. The galley was also called the ""midnight lunch shack"" and that's what it was—a shack, situated midway between the 100-inch and the 60-inch telescope domes. During the observatory's early, heady decades, the midnight lunch depended on how the 100-inch was being used. When the astronomer was doing the relatively easy stellar spectroscopy, his assistant would walk down to the shack and prepare lunch, eat his share, and then go back to the telescope to relieve the astronomer, who would then go down and have his."|"The Edge of Physics"|"Anil Ananthaswamy"

So both took an hour-long break and wandered over to the shack—as it happened, for not much succor. ""As late as 1955, no food was stored in the midnight lunchroom,"" wrote Sandage. ""Instead the food had to be packed in a small basket and toted up the steep path from the Monastery each night. This responsibility fell to the 60-inch observer, whose hike culminated in hanging the basket on a hook above the floor of the 60-inch dome, safe from scavenging animals. At midnight, the basket would be taken to the lunch room. This was a lot of buildup for very little payoff, for rarely was there much food in the basket.""

I knew of the Russians' love for drink, and I was carrying a bottle of fine Scotch whisky to share with my hosts. But I was hardly prepared for the charming ritual I witnessed on the ice—at 10:00 A.M., no less. The white, frozen lake spread for miles around us in every direction except to the northwest, where we were relatively close to shore. Men milled around the vehicles. The subzero temperature seemed to affect everyone differently—some stood bareheaded, others had woolen caps rolled down to the tips of their ears, and then there was Ralf Wischnewski, in his enormous Russian fur cap that looked like a fluffed-up rabbit. A German neutrino physicist who had been working with the Russians at Lake Baikal for twenty years, Wischnewski was the reason I was here. I had met this ruddy-faced man, who was graying at the temples, six months earlier in London, outside the Tate Modern museum, on the south bank of the Thames. We walked over to a Greek pub and discussed the Baikal expedition over chilled lager. It was he who had alerted me to the tradition of bringing spirits to share with the Russians during the winter evenings."|"The Edge of Physics"|"Anil Ananthaswamy"

They worked long hours, from early in the morning to sometimes well past midnight. There was no running water, which meant no showers for two months. Drinking water was collected each morning from a hole in the ice near the shore—Lake Baikal was pure enough to drink from, the very quality that made it so good for neutrino physics. Toilets were mere pits in the ground, with a wooden cabin around them for privacy.

And then there was my first visit to the outhouse, at 2:00 A.M. Even as I went to sleep the first night, I was worried about this, with temperatures going down to 5°F outside. But nature called, and it meant getting out of my Russian military-issue sleeping bag and into layers of thermals, T-shirts and jackets, thick socks and shoes. A blast of vicious cold hit me as I stepped out of the relatively warm, heated cabin into the naked winter outside. The tire tracks of jeeps that had turned the ground slushy during the day were frozen solid. I was treading on treads. The two-minute walk was its own mini-expedition.

I opted to sleep in a snow trench, and in a moment of misguided adventurism I decided to dig the trench myself. Shovel in hand, I gouged out a coffinlike cavity about three feet deep, narrow at the top and wider at the bottom. It was just roomy enough to accommodate an insulating mat and sleeping bag.

Normally, cosmic rays are composed of charged particles, which are deflected by intervening magnetic fields, so it's difficult to work out their source. But if astronomers can find cosmic rays coming directly from some source, it will most likely be made of neutral particles, mainly neutrons. (There is speculation of just such a source in the Cygnus region of the Milky Way, but it remains controversial.) When neutrons decay, they produce electron neutrinos. These neutrinos will oscillate as they travel through space, and some of them will have turned into tau and muon neutrinos by the time they reach Earth. Hooper's calculations for a potential source in the Cygnus region show that the neutrinos are expected in ratios of 56:24:20—for electron, muon, and tau neutrinos, respectively. But if spacetime is foamy, then these neutrino types should interact with the fabric of spacetime and ""decohere,"" leading to an equal mix of all three types. So, if IceCube were to see an equal split of neutrino types from the Cygnus region instead of the 56:24:20 ratio expected of smooth spacetime, it would be hard to explain without invoking quantum gravity. But Hooper is aware that such a measurement is a long way off, given that we have yet to see even a single neutrino from such distant sources. Also, the source has to be distant enough for quantum decoherence to become a factor—and theories are of no help at this time in predicting just how far away a source of electron neutrinos needs to be to allow us to observe this effect. It will take some luck for IceCube to stumble on the right source at the right distance.
