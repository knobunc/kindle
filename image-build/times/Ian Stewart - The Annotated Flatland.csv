Under his direction, the school became one of the best in the country. Although his own background was classics (Latin and Greek), he made sure that the curriculum included sustantial amounts of English literature, especially Shakespeare. When H.C. Beeching credited Mortimer with introducing English literature to the school, Abbott set him straight:"|"The Annotated Flatland"|"Ian Stewart"

I should not mention this, but that I have been unable to distinguish your tenor in the course of our conversation.” I replied that I had but one voice, and that I had not been aware that his Royal Highness had two. “That confirms my impression,” said the King, “that you are not a Man, but a feminine Monstrosity with a bass voice, and an utterly uneducated ear.

"ap 03:00"|three|"1 Again Abbott is setting his reader up for the dimensional analogy. A. Square observes Lineland from the outside, so what might observe Flatland from the outside? Spaceland, of course. But, more subtly, what might observe Spaceland from the outside? Why should the dimensions of space stop at three, when the analogy continues to work perfectly well?"|"The Annotated Flatland"|"Ian Stewart"
"ap 03:00"|3|"The two-dimensional case is also exceptional: Here there are infinitely many regular “solids”— namely, the regular polygons. And in one dimension the only regular “solid” is a line segment. Hence in dimensions 1, 2, 3, 4 the number of regular “solids” is 1,  ∞ (infinity), 5, 6; and in all higher dimensions it is 3. These numbers show that not all properties of n-dimensional space can be found by simple analogies with space of two and three dimensions. More strongly, they hint at a fact that mathematicians have come to expect: Each dimension of space has its own special features, unlike any other dimension. As well as having many other features that are common to most or all dimensions, of course."|"The Annotated Flatland"|"Ian Stewart"
"~ 19:00"|"around 1900"|"Also around 1900, Sylvester’s predictions were coming true. There was an explosion of mathematical and physical areas in which concepts of multidimensional space were making a serious impact. One was relativity, which is best considered a special kind of four-dimensional space-time geometry. As formulated by Minkowski in 1908, the three spatial coordinates (x, y, z), together with time t , form a four-dimensional space-time with coordinates (x, y, z, t ). Any such “point” is called an event: It is like a point particle that winks into existence at just one moment in time and then winks out again. Relativity is really about the physics of events. In traditional mechanics, a particle moving through space occupies coordinates (x (t ), y (t ), z (t )) at time t, and this position changes as time passes. From Minkowski’s space-time viewpoint, the collection of all such points is a curve in space-time, the world line of the particle. The most important new ingredient in relativity is that the appropriate measure of “distance” is not"|"The Annotated Flatland"|"Ian Stewart"
