Under his direction, the school became one of the best in the country. Although his own background was classics (Latin and Greek), he made sure that the curriculum included sustantial amounts of English literature, especially Shakespeare. When H.C. Beeching credited Mortimer with introducing English literature to the school, Abbott set him straight:"|"The Annotated Flatland"|"Ian Stewart"
15:45|1545|"Why do we get ourselves into this kind of muddle? All calendric systems are compromises because the rotational period of the Earth (“day”) is not some simple fraction of its period of revolution around the sun (“year”). Moreover, the period of revolution of the moon around the Earth (“month”) is commensurate with neither. The calendar that is now used worldwide for civil purposes—though many nations retain different calendars for religious purposes—evolved from the Roman calendar. The Roman calendar was based on the phases of the moon, and it quickly got out of step with the seasons, which depend on the Earth’s position relative to the sun. The Roman calendar in effect adopted a year that on average was 3661/4 days long—one day too many—and by 50 B.C., spring had slipped 8 weeks and was starting in May. Julius Caesar (100? B.C.–44 B.C.) asked the Alexandrian astronomer Sosigenes (flourished 50 B.C.) for advice, and he suggested switching to the Egyptian year of 3651/4 days. To return the seasons to their rightful places, the year 46 B.C. was accorded 445 days. To deal with that awkward 1/4 day, Sosigenes proposed to have a normal year that lasted 365 days but to add an extra “leap” day every fourth year (that extra day is now February 29, but originally it fell between February 23 and 24). In 44 B.C. further minor changes to the lengths of the months were made by Augustus Caesar (63 B.C.–A.D. 14), but this “Julian calendar” served humanity well for 1,500 years. However, the tropical year is actually 365.242199 days, not 365.25—an error of 11 minutes 14 seconds per year. By 1545 the vernal equinox (the beginning of spring, used to work out the date of Easter) was wrong by 10 days, and the Council of Trent authorized Pope Paul III (1468–1549) to put matters right. Various remedies were proposed, but no action was taken until Pope Gregory XIII (1502–1585) was elected in 1572. Then the astronomer and Euclidean commentator Christopher Clavius (1537– 1612) drafted a papal bull based on ideas of the astronomer Luigi Lilio. The bull, which appeared in 1582, assumed a year of 365.2422 days and adjusted the calendar by omitting leap years in all years that are multiples of 100, except that multiples of 400 remain leap years (as, for example, was the case in A.D. 2000). Ten days were omitted to return the vernal equinox to its correct position. The resulting “Gregorian calendar” is the one we use today. By the time it was introduced into England, 11 days had to be omitted, giving rise to the famous cries of “give us back our eleven days!” This complaint made more sense than it seems because payment of taxes depended on the boundaries between months."|"The Annotated Flatland"|"Ian Stewart"
"ap 03:00"|3|"The two-dimensional case is also exceptional: Here there are infinitely many regular “solids”— namely, the regular polygons. And in one dimension the only regular “solid” is a line segment. Hence in dimensions 1, 2, 3, 4 the number of regular “solids” is 1,  ∞ (infinity), 5, 6; and in all higher dimensions it is 3. These numbers show that not all properties of n-dimensional space can be found by simple analogies with space of two and three dimensions. More strongly, they hint at a fact that mathematicians have come to expect: Each dimension of space has its own special features, unlike any other dimension. As well as having many other features that are common to most or all dimensions, of course."|"The Annotated Flatland"|"Ian Stewart"
"~ 19:00"|"around 1900"|"Also around 1900, Sylvester’s predictions were coming true. There was an explosion of mathematical and physical areas in which concepts of multidimensional space were making a serious impact. One was relativity, which is best considered a special kind of four-dimensional space-time geometry. As formulated by Minkowski in 1908, the three spatial coordinates (x, y, z), together with time t , form a four-dimensional space-time with coordinates (x, y, z, t ). Any such “point” is called an event: It is like a point particle that winks into existence at just one moment in time and then winks out again. Relativity is really about the physics of events. In traditional mechanics, a particle moving through space occupies coordinates (x (t ), y (t ), z (t )) at time t, and this position changes as time passes. From Minkowski’s space-time viewpoint, the collection of all such points is a curve in space-time, the world line of the particle. The most important new ingredient in relativity is that the appropriate measure of “distance” is not"|"The Annotated Flatland"|"Ian Stewart"
