There’s nothing in the kitchen, there’s not even a bit of lettuce. It’s like the workhouse here. [Pause.]  He can eat like a bullock, that bloke. [Pause.]  I’ve seen him finish off a loaf of bread before I’d got my jacket off. [Pause.]  He’d never leave a breadcrumb on a plate in the old days. [Pause.] Of course, he may have changed. Things do change. But I’m the same. Do you know, I had five solid square meals one day last week? At eleven o’clock, two o’clock, six o’clock, ten o’clock and one o’clock. Not bad going. Work makes me hungry. I was working that day. [Pause.] I’m always starving when I get up. Daylight has a funny effect on me. As for the night, that goes without saying. As far as I’m concerned the only thing you can do in the night is eat. It keeps me fit, especially if I’m at home.

In the lift you never took your eyes from her, you found you were both on the same floor, you helped her out, by her arm. You stood with her in the corridor, looking at her. You touched her shoulder, said good night, went to your room, she went to hers, you changed into your yellow pyjamas and black dressing-gown, you went down the passage and knocked on her door, you’d left your toothpaste in town. She opened the door, you went in, she was still dressed. You admired the room, it was so feminine, you felt awake, didn’t feel like sleeping, you sat down, on the bed. She wanted you to go, you wouldn’t. She became upset, you sympathized, away from home, on a business trip, horrible life, especially for a woman, you comforted her, you gave her solace, you stayed."|"Harold Pinter Plays 2"|"Harold Pinter"
