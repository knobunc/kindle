12:00|noon|"The best thing about Sundays is we eat our big meal at noon. Once you get your belly full, you can walk all over West Virginia before you’re hungry again. Any other day, you start out after dinner, you’ve got to come back when it’s dark."|Shiloh|"Phyllis Reynolds Naylor"
12:00|noon|"Sunday-night supper is whatever’s left from noon. If nothing’s left over, Ma takes cold cornmeal mush, fries up big slabs, and we eat it with Karo syrup. But this night there’s still rabbit. I don’t want any, but I know Shiloh does."|Shiloh|"Phyllis Reynolds Naylor"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"By five o’clock, when it’s growing light, I know pretty much what I have to do: I have to buy that dog from Judd Travers."|Shiloh|"Phyllis Reynolds Naylor"
"ap 08:45"|"quarter of nine"|"By quarter of nine, we’re on the route; Dad pulls the Jeep up close to the mailboxes and I stuff the mail in, turn up the little red flag on the side, if there is one. Some folks even wait down at the box, and then you feel real bad if you don’t have anything for them."|Shiloh|"Phyllis Reynolds Naylor"
12:00|noon|"I eat my peanut-butter-and-soda-cracker sandwiches with Dad at noon, plus the zucchini bread Mrs. Ellison had left in her mailbox for him, and after all the Sears catalogs and mail is delivered, we head back to the Sistersville post office. I get my Coca-Cola at the gas station while Dad finishes up, and we start home. I forget all about looking for cans and bottles. The can I’m holding is the only one I got. “Judd Travers goes hunting near every weekend, don’t he?” I ask Dad."|Shiloh|"Phyllis Reynolds Naylor"
"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"But I figure my luck’s going to run out if I don’t get him back to his pen soon, so about noon I take him back, and he goes right to the gunnysacks in the lean-to, he’s so tuckered out."|Shiloh|"Phyllis Reynolds Naylor"
"ap 03:30"|three-thirty|"What I didn’t expect was that at three-thirty, before Dad come home, here’s Doc Murphy’s car chugging up the lane, and he’s got Shiloh in the backseat. I’m standing out by the oak tree with David, taking turns on the bag swing, when I see the car and Shiloh’s head raised up in the backseat. I’m over to that car in three seconds flat."|Shiloh|"Phyllis Reynolds Naylor"
05:30|"five-thirty in the morning"|"Judd Travers is staring at me like he’s about to crack me across the mouth. Way we’re raised around here, children don’t talk back to grown folks. Don’t hardly talk much at all, in fact. Learn to listen, keep your mouth shut, let the grown folks do the talking. And here I am, shooting off my mouth at five-thirty in the morning to a man holding a rifle. Am I crazy or what?"|Shiloh|"Phyllis Reynolds Naylor"
"ap 03:00"|three|"“I git home from work every day at three,” Judd says, “and I want you here when I pull up. You work for me two hours a day, five days a week. I want that wood back there stacked. I want the weeds cut and the grass mowed. I want my beans picked, the corn hoed. . . . Whatever I think of to be done, that’s what you do. And I want you here startin’ tomorrow.”"|Shiloh|"Phyllis Reynolds Naylor"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"Dad’s having his coffee and Ma’s in the living room listening to the Sunday morning service by Brother Jonas. She watches him every Sunday at seven, which tells me what time it is already."|Shiloh|"Phyllis Reynolds Naylor"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"Monday afternoon at three o’clock, I’m waiting on Judd’s porch when he pulls up. All his dogs is chained out to the side of the house, and they get to barkin’ like crazy. I don’t try to get near ’em, ’cause a chained dog can be mean. I’ve already restacked Judd’s woodpile, but he wants me to do it again, put the big pieces here, the little ones there. He is looking mean and grumpy, like maybe he’s disgusted with himself for lettin’ me have that dog so easy."|Shiloh|"Phyllis Reynolds Naylor"
"ap 04:00"|"Four o’clock"|"Four o’clock comes, and I finally finished all that wood, but Judd pretends he’s asleep. Got his head laid back, mouth half open, but I know it’s just another way he’s got to trick me. Wants me to sneak on home; then he’ll say I never kept to my part of the bargain. So I go in his shed, put the sledgehammer back, take out the sickle, and go tackle the weeds down by his mailbox. Work on them weeds a whole hour, and when five o’clock comes, I start back toward the shed. See him watching me. I walk over."|Shiloh|"Phyllis Reynolds Naylor"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"Four o’clock comes, and I finally finished all that wood, but Judd pretends he’s asleep.

"ap > 05:00"|"Past five o’clock"|"I go get it, sit out on a stump, running the whetstone over the blade.
“Past five o’clock,” says Judd.
“I know,” I say."|Shiloh|"Phyllis Reynolds Naylor"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"Thursday, when I get there, Judd’s meanness has got the best of him again, because I can see he’s running out of work for me to do, just giving me work to make me sweat. Dig a ditch to dump his garbage in, he says. Hoe that cornfield again, scrub that porch, weed that bean patch. But close on to five o’clock, he seems to realize that I’m only going to be there one more time. I’d worked real hard that day. Did anything he asked and done it better than he asked me to."|Shiloh|"Phyllis Reynolds Naylor"
