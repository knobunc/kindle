"> 22:00"|"after ten at night"|"Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet in his ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be up after ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out before I rose in the morning.53 Sometimes he spent his day at the chemical laboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and occasionally in long walks, which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the City.54 Nothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him; but now and again a reaction would seize him, and for days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night. On these occasions I have noticed such a dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes, that I might have suspected him of being addicted to the use of some narcotic, had not the temperance and cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion.55"|"The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes, Volume III"|"Arthur Conan Doyle"

The only consistent pattern suggested is that Watson must have regularly arisen very late, as confirmed by his late breakfast in “The Boscombe Valley Mystery.”"|"The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes, Volume III"|"Arthur Conan Doyle"
"~ 18:44"|"around 1844"|"Monsieur Lecoq (Gaboriau never revealed his first name) was born around 1844 to “respectable” parents but turned to crime after his father’s financial ruin. Just when his life seemed headed down the wrong path, he consulted an astronomer, who told him, “When one has your disposition, and is poor, one may either become a famous thief or a great detective. Choose.” He chose the latter and became an expert at the use of disguise, developing useful tests to determine when a bed had been last used and when the hands of a clock had been set back. His adventures are recounted in L’Affair Lerouge (1866) (U.S. title The Widow Lerouge, 1873), Le Dossier No. 113 (1867) (U.S. title File No. 113, 1875), Monsieur Lecoq (1869), Le Crime de Orcival (1867) (U.S. title The Mystery of Orcival, 1871), Les Enclaves de Paris (1868) (U.S. title The Slaves of Paris, 1882), and the posthumously published long story Le Petit Vieux des Batignolles (1876) (U.S. title The Little Old Man of Batignolles, 1880). In his first case, L’Affaire Lerouge, Lecoq plays only a small part; the principal detection is by Père Tabaret, known as Tir-au-clair, an amateur detective who tutors Lecoq."|"The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes, Volume III"|"Arthur Conan Doyle"

At Euston Station they got out, and I left a boy to hold my horse, and followed them on to the platform. I heard them ask for the Liverpool train, and the guard answer that one had just gone and there would not be another for some hours. Stangerson seemed to be put out at that, but Drebber was rather pleased than otherwise. I got so close to them in the bustle that I could hear every word that passed between them. Drebber said that he had a little business of his own to do, and that if the other would wait for him he would soon rejoin him. His companion remonstrated with him, and reminded him that they had resolved to stick together. Drebber answered that the matter was a delicate one, and that he must go alone. I could not catch what Stangerson said to that, but the other burst out swearing, and reminded him that he was nothing more than his paid servant, and that he must not presume to dictate to him. On that the Secretary gave it up as a bad job, and simply bargained with him that if he missed the last train he should rejoin him at Halliday’s Private Hotel; to which Drebber answered that he would be back on the platform before eleven, and made his way out of the station."|"The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes, Volume III"|"Arthur Conan Doyle"

The yellow glare from the shop-windows streamed out into the steamy, vaporous air and threw a murky, shifting radiance across the crowded thoroughfare. There was, to my mind, something eerie and ghost-like in the endless procession of faces which flitted across these narrow bars of light—sad faces and glad, haggard and merry. Like all humankind, they flitted from the gloom into the light, and so back into the gloom once more. I am not subject to impressions, but the dull, heavy evening, with the strange business upon which we were engaged, combined to make me nervous and depressed.

According to Christopher Morley, “They were probably playing Shakespeare at the time of this rendezvous, which would account for the crowd of devotees, though seven o’clock is surely too early for the carriage trade to be arriving.” Morley also notes the “happy coincidence” that William Gillette’s play Sherlock Holmes was performed at the Lyceum in 1901."|"The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes, Volume III"|"Arthur Conan Doyle"

I explained, however, the importance of my errand and promised faithfully to call and report any progress which we might make with the case.

"ap ~ 00:00"|"About twelve o’clock"|"About twelve o’clock last night [said the Standard],166 Mr. Bartholomew Sholto, of Pondicherry Lodge, Upper Norwood, was found dead in his room under circumstances which point to foul play. As far as we can learn, no actual traces of violence were found upon Mr. Sholto’s person, but a valuable collection of Indian gems which the deceased gentleman had inherited from his father has been carried off. The discovery was first made by Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, who had called at the house with Mr. Thaddeus Sholto, brother of the deceased. By a singular piece of good fortune, Mr. Athelney Jones, the well-known member of the detective police force, happened to be at the Norwood police station and was on the ground within half an hour of the first alarm. His trained and experienced faculties were at once directed towards the detection of the criminals, with the gratifying result that the brother, Thaddeus Sholto, has already been arrested, together with the housekeeper, Mrs. Bernstone, an Indian butler named Lal Rao, and a porter, or gatekeeper, named McMurdo. It is quite certain that the thief or thieves were well acquainted with the house, for Mr. Jones’s well-known technical knowledge and his powers of minute observation have enabled him to prove conclusively that the miscreants could not have entered by the door or by the window but must have made their way across the roof of the building, and so through a trap-door into a room which communicated with that in which the body was found. This fact, which has been very clearly made out, proves conclusively that it was no mere haphazard burglary. The prompt and energetic action of the officers of the law shows the great advantage of the presence on such occasions of a single vigorous and masterful mind. We cannot but think that it supplies an argument to those who would wish to see our detectives more de-centralized,167 and so brought into closer and more effective touch with the cases which it is their duty to investigate."|"The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes, Volume III"|"Arthur Conan Doyle"

(The police did not acquire motorboats until 1910.) Under the command of Superintendent George Steed, the force consisted in 1887 of 44 inspectors, 4 sergeants, and 124 constables, according to Charles Dickens, Jr. (Dictionary of the Thames, 1887). These numbers had increased 10 percent by the following year. Descriptions of the uniforms of “Wet Bobs” vary, with all sources agreeing that the men wore a blue reefer coat, or double-breasted jacket—removed for rowing—and loose-fitting trousers. There was a variety of headgear: a hard glazed hat, a peaked yachtsman’s cap, or a straw hat. The officers decorated their collars with a nickel anchor. Dickens, Jr., writes: “Both night and day several boats patrol the river in different parts; a fresh boat starting from the station hard every two hours to relieve the one whose watch is up. Each boat contains an inspector and two men, the latter of whom do the rowing, and a careful system of supervision is maintained by which the passing of each boat is checked at varying points. Two steam launches are also employed”; by 1898, eight more steam launches had been added. The work was dangerous, and between 1857 and 1901 at least two officers drowned in the line of duty."|"The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes, Volume III"|"Arthur Conan Doyle"

But a second consideration struck me. Jonathan Small must have felt that the peculiar appearance of his companion, however much he may have top-coated him, would give rise to gossip, and possibly be associated with this Norwood tragedy. He was quite sharp enough to see that. They had started from their head-quarters under cover of darkness, and he would wish to get back before it was broad light. Now, it was past three o’clock, according to Mrs. Smith, when they got the boat. It would be quite bright, and people would be about in an hour or so. Therefore, I argued, they did not go very far. They paid Smith well to hold his tongue, reserved his launch for the final escape, and hurried to their lodgings with the treasure-box. In a couple of nights, when they had time to see what view the papers took, and whether there was any suspicion, they would make their way under cover of darkness to some ship at Gravesend or in the Downs,201 where no doubt they had already arranged for passages to America or the Colonies.”"|"The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes, Volume III"|"Arthur Conan Doyle"

I drew blank at fifteen, but at the sixteenth—Jacobson’s—I learned that the Aurora had been handed over to them two days ago by a wooden-legged man, with some trivial directions as to her rudder. ‘There ain’t naught amiss with her rudder,’ said the foreman. ‘There she lies, with the red streaks.’ At that moment who should come down but Mordecai Smith, the missing owner! He was rather the worse for liquor. I should not, of course, have known him, but he bellowed out his name and the name of his launch. ‘I want her to-night at eight o’clock,’ said he—‘eight o’clock sharp, mind, for I have two gentlemen who won’t be kept waiting.’ They had evidently paid him well, for he was very flush of money, chucking shillings about to the men. I followed him some distance, but he subsided into an alehouse; so I went back to the yard, and, happening to pick up one of my boys on the way, I stationed him as a sentry over the launch. He is to stand at the water’s edge and wave his handkerchief to us when they start.

Here, the implication is that Watson has for once bested his friend, is relaxing after his meal, “and in the warm glow of comfortable satiety he dares to venture some pregnant observations of his own,” as Vincent Starrett points out. In A Study in Scarlet (see note 53), Watson describes Holmes as having “invariably breakfasted and gone out” before he can even rouse himself from his bed; he refers to his own “late habits” and confesses that “I get up at all sorts of ungodly hours.” This was presumably before Watson commenced his practise in Paddington. In “The Engineer’s Thumb,” after being roused before seven o’clock, Watson expects to discover Holmes taking his breakfast. In “The Speckled Band,” however, Watson describes himself as “regular in my habits” and Holmes as a “late riser as a rule.”"|"The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes, Volume III"|"Arthur Conan Doyle"
"ap 00:00"|"twelve o’clock"|"The facts of the case are simple. Sir Charles Baskerville was in the habit every night before going to bed of walking down the famous Yew Alley of Baskerville Hall. The evidence of the Barrymores shows that this had been his custom. On the 4th of June Sir Charles had declared his intention of starting next day for London, and had ordered Barrymore to prepare his luggage. That night he went out as usual for his nocturnal walk, in the course of which he was in the habit of smoking a cigar. He never returned. At twelve o’clock Barrymore, finding the hall door still open, became alarmed and, lighting a lantern, went in search of his master. The day had been wet, and Sir Charles’s footmarks were easily traced down the Alley, and it was at the far end of it that his body was discovered. One fact which has not been explained is the statement of Barrymore that his master’s footprints altered their character from the time that he passed the moor-gate, and that he appeared from thence onwards to have been walking on his toes. One Murphy, a gipsy horse-dealer, was on the moor at no great distance at the time, but he appears by his own confession to have been the worse for drink. He declares that he heard cries, but is unable to state from what direction they came. No signs of violence were to be discovered upon Sir Charles’s person and though the doctor’s evidence pointed to an almost incredible facial distortion—so great that Dr. Mortimer refused at first to believe that it was indeed his friend and patient who lay before him—it was explained that this is a symptom which is not unusual in cases of dyspnœa39 and death from cardiac exhaustion. This explanation was borne out by the post-mortem examination, which showed long standing organic disease, and the coroner’s jury returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence.40 It is well that this is so, for it is obviously of the utmost importance that Sir Charles’s heir should settle at the Hall, and continue the good work which has been so sadly interrupted. Had the prosaic finding of the coroner not finally put an end to the romantic stories which have been whispered in connection with the affair, it might have been difficult to find a tennant for Baskerville Hall. It is understood that the next-of-kin is Mr. Henry Baskerville, if he be still alive, the son of Sir Charles Baskerville’s younger brother.

"ap 01:10"|1:10|"The terminology can be confusing: “Large-scale” means smaller numbers if the “representative fraction,” or “RF,” scale is used. This method gives as the ratio of map distances to actual distance on the surface of the Earth, without indication of units (for example, 1:63,360, 1:10,060). (Note that there are 12 x 5,280, or 63,360, inches to the mile.) According to the Encyclopædia Britannica (9th Ed.), the typical Ordnance Survey parish map had a large scale of 1:2500, the typical town map a very large scale of 1:500 (and, of course, consisted of numerous sheets). Thus a map at the normal 1-inch (1:63,360 RF) scale showing a radius of five miles (10 miles wide) would be 10 inches wide, while a 6-inch scale map (1:10,060) would be 5 feet square. At the parish scale of 1:2500, a five-mile radius requires a map over 20 feet square and at the town scale of 1:500 would be over 100 feet square! (Sabine Baring-Gould’s fine handbook entitled Devon [1907] reproduces the entire area on a map about two feet square, which uses a scale of 4 miles to the inch (that is, 1:253,440), but of course this does not show anything so small as a “clump of buildings.”) If Holmes had only a single map showing the relevant area, it was likely a 6-inch scale map, which would be convenient to use if folded.

It was thrown by a man who walked softly down the passage with a candle held in his hand. He was in shirt and trousers, with no covering to his feet.

It was a most melancholy vigil, and ended by each of us falling asleep in our chairs. Fortunately we were not discouraged, and we determined to try again. The next night we lowered the lamp and sat smoking cigarettes, without making the least sound. It was incredible how slowly the hours crawled by, and yet we were helped through it by the same sort of patient interest which the hunter must feel as he watches the trap into which he hopes the game may wander.

Now see here, Councillor, I’ll show you my plan and I’ll ask you to fit the others into it. You will all come in good time. Very well. He comes at ten. He is to tap three times, and me to open the door for him. Then I’ll get behind him and shut it. He’s our man then.”"|"The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes, Volume III"|"Arthur Conan Doyle"
