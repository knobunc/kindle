"~ 16:00"|"about four in the afternoon"|"These questions raced through his mind as he walked into town. He had to see Romeo, but it was well known that Romeo spent all night in the clubs along the Malecón and did not get up until about four in the afternoon. Baldito wandered through town, testing his craziness. Every minute until he did something about it the spider venom was making its way to his mind. Would he get crazier with time? So now was he only a little crazy? He stopped at the stand near Porvenir where a friend sold cane. He bought a stick and peeled off the end and started chewing and sucking in the sweetness. This was normal, right? He talked to his friend for a while about baseball. The friend wanted to know how his training was going and how much money he thought he could get for signing. And that seemed to go well. He didn’t have an impulse to say anything strange. He didn’t say, “I think they will offer fifty million dollars.”"|"City Beasts"|"Mark Kurlansky"
"ap 04:00"|four|"Baldito wandered on past the little shopping mall Sammy Sosa had built with the statue of Sammy that looked nothing like him. When he got to Romeo’s apartment building it was exactly four, though Baldito was not certain because he had no watch. Several Major Leaguers lived in the building and their black Monteros were lined up inside the gate. Romeo answered his door in a plush velvety wine-colored bathrobe and dark sunglasses that hid his eyes. Baldito could feel the cold air rushing out of the apartment like he was standing in the doorway of the walk-in on the dock where they froze the fish."|"City Beasts"|"Mark Kurlansky"
00:00|midnight|"The Basque taught him to make dishes from food he brought in himself—salt cod with various sauces and little green chilies that had no sting, which he learned to grill and sprinkle with coarse salt from Guantánamo. The Basque ate every night at midnight in his apartment on Fifth Avenue near the Spanish embassy that was a six-story baroque palace. The apartment was new and clean-looking, unlike any place Segundo had ever been, and the kitchen was better than the one at the hotel school, though slightly smaller. The Basque knew everything about food and Segundo learned from him, but this was not the great chance the Revolution would offer him. That was still to come."|"City Beasts"|"Mark Kurlansky"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"Yumas, Segundo had been informed, are always on time, and it was true. At exactly eight o’clock the ten of them arrived in flowered shirts and those five-peso straw hats they sell in Habana Vieja and the bright rose faces white people get when they come to the tropics. They were exactly what Segundo thought they would be, and they followed like ducks as Silvio ushered them onto the terrace. He thought that they might enjoy seeing the appliances in his kitchen. He might show them after dinner."|"City Beasts"|"Mark Kurlansky"
"ap ~ 08:15"|"about eight-fifteen"|"Night after night, usually at about eight-fifteen, the crows would squawk and the customers would become uneasy. They even tried not opening until eight-thirty, but still about fifteen minutes into the service the oily black birds squawked."|"City Beasts"|"Mark Kurlansky"

"ap 01:50"|one-fifty|"“A vodou ceremony?” Kola’s face had a wide, toothy smile. He rubbed his belly. He was proud of his belly because he was the only one in Joli who had one. “San dolar. Tell him there is a nice ceremony for a hundred dollars. For one-fifty I can show him something special.”"|"City Beasts"|"Mark Kurlansky"
"ap 10:30"|ten-thirty|"At Casa Pampi, the large elegant restaurant with two Michelin stars—some years he had three—owner Pampi Urabayen had just received word that the crabber had arrived. The tall, silver-haired man with a reassuring smile and a calm demeanor seemed uncharacteristically nervous. This was the night for txangurro. There was still afternoon light, blinding white sunlight exploding from behind dark afternoon clouds, but by ten-thirty tonight revelers would burst into his restaurant demanding txangurro, stuffed spider crab. It took some time and skill to locate and extract the meager white flesh of a spider crab without damaging the shells so they could be refilled and served."|"City Beasts"|"Mark Kurlansky"
"ap 02:45"|"two hours and forty-five minutes"|"There were even a few helpful suggestions at what appeared to be a website from Basque terrorists. The bombs were built in boxes used to transport the large rounds of sheep-milk cheese that Basque farms produced, ardi gasna. He was even able to get cheese labels from local farms to put on the boxes. Ander set the bombs in advance to blow up in exactly two hours and forty-five minutes. Then Marmitako’s only task was to leave his large bomb somewhere in the train station while Ander left his small one by the bank. Ander didn’t need a bomb. He had a key. But a bomb would look more authentic. The train station would be bombed and draw all the police and no one would notice the bank."|"City Beasts"|"Mark Kurlansky"
