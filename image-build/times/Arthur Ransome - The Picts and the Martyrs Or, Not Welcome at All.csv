They were talking of the boat which Professor Callum had asked their uncle to order for Dick and Dorothea, and were hoping it was ready so that its crew could get the hang of it before the Swallows turned up, who were coming in a fortnight’s time to stay at Holly Howe on the other side of the lake."|"The Picts and the Martyrs Or, Not Welcome at All"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 06:30"|"six thirty"|"I have just learnt with surprise that your mother has chosen this time to go abroad with your Uncle James. Neither of them has thought fit to let me know of their intentions. I am horrified at the idea that you and Margaret are alone in the house. I cannot consider Cook sufficient guardian in your mother’s absence. It may have been from a wish to spare me anxiety that your mother did not tell me she was to be away from home when you returned from school for your vacation. A little more thought would have shown her that I should have preferred to hear from her than to receive such disturbing news at second hand. However that may be, my duty is plain. Inconvenient as it is for me to disarrange my plans, I cannot permit you two children to be thus abandoned to your own devices. You tell me your mother returns on the thirteenth. On that day I am expecting a friend whose visit I cannot defer. I have, however, cancelled all my engagements until that date, and am coming to Beckfoot tomorrow to take charge of the house till the eve of your mother’s return, when I shall have to leave you to prepare for my visitor at Harrogate. I shall be glad if you will ask Cook to air the spare-room bed for me. I have made, by telephone, my own arrangements for a conveyance to meet me at the station, and expect to be at Beckfoot between six thirty and seven o’clock."|"The Picts and the Martyrs Or, Not Welcome at All"|"Arthur Ransome"

"ap < 00:30"|"nearly half of one"|"It was an enormous fireplace, taking up nearly half of one wall, a huge cavern of a fireplace, of the old kind, built for burning wood, with no grate, but an iron bar, very rusty, stretching from one side to the other with a great hook hanging on it."|"The Picts and the Martyrs Or, Not Welcome at All"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 00:30"|"Half-past twelve"|"“Half-past twelve,” said Dick. “Twenty-seven and a half minutes to one.”"|"The Picts and the Martyrs Or, Not Welcome at All"|"Arthur Ransome"

Dick pulled out his watch. “Twenty-two minutes to six.”
“Goodbye, Picts,” said Nancy. “She’ll be here before we’re ready if we don’t go.”"|"The Picts and the Martyrs Or, Not Welcome at All"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 01:29"|"Twenty-nine minutes past one"|"“What’s the time?” she asked.
“Twenty-nine minutes past one.”
“Dinner,” said Dorothea."|"The Picts and the Martyrs Or, Not Welcome at All"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 04:03"|"Three minutes past four"|"“Soft bottom for her and roots to land on,” said Nancy. “I had a look first. And jolly well hidden. She won’t be seen here even if anybody was looking for her. And the harbour’s going to be useful even when the G.A. goes back to her horrid Harrogate. We can use it as a lurking place when the Swallows come and we start a new war. Roger’ll remember the octopuses and they’ll never think of our being able to hide a brig here. What’s the time, Dick?”
“Three minutes past four.”
“Giminy. Hop out, you two. We’ve got to get home. I’ve got to get cool somehow. How’s your hair, Peg?”"|"The Picts and the Martyrs Or, Not Welcome at All"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 04:30"|"half-past four"|"Dick looked at his watch. “Half a minute to half-past four,” he whispered. “They’ve done it.”"|"The Picts and the Martyrs Or, Not Welcome at All"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"There was nothing written on the envelope. Inside it was a small bit of writing paper with a hurriedly scrawled skull and crossbones in one corner, not one of Nancy’s best. Underneath it was written, “Bit of a row last night. She told Cook she was being extravagant with milk. Cook held her peace though nearly busting. Yours is to come separately. Give him yesterday’s bottle. Now listen. Orders for the day. Be where I said at two o’clock sharp.”"|"The Picts and the Martyrs Or, Not Welcome at All"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 06:00"|"Six o’clock"|"“Six o’clock,” said Jacky scornfully. “We’ve had cows in and milked since then. What are you doing for your food? Catch trout in t’beck?”"|"The Picts and the Martyrs Or, Not Welcome at All"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 02:00"|"TWO o’clock"|"
TWO o’clock sharp.
Dick and Dorothea, after a Pictish morning exploring the wood, had had an early dinner, had skirted round above Beckfoot while they knew the Great Aunt must be safely lunching, and, complete with telescope and the book on how to sail, were lurking in the rock and heather at the top of the ridge of the Beckfoot promontory."|"The Picts and the Martyrs Or, Not Welcome at All"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"“It’s only just two o’clock,” said Dorothea. “We were here before she said. Look here, Dick, I’d better have another look at the sailing book. You must know it by heart.”"|"The Picts and the Martyrs Or, Not Welcome at All"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 02:00"|"Two o’clock"|"Dick took off and cleaned his spectacles. It was no good getting in a dither, but he could not help it. Two o’clock sharp, Nancy had said in her note. If they were starting now they would only just have time to get across to Rio, take Scarab from her builders, hoist sail and have the shortest of short trials before Nancy and Peggy would have to leave them and be bolting home to drawing-room tea. And they were not starting now. Minute after minute was passing. Minute after minute was being simply wasted. Dorothea had the sailing book which would perhaps have helped him not to worry, but it was a good thing that she was trying to read it. Nancy and Peggy would be watching while they tried the new boat and he knew very well that Dot was not as clear about the theory of sailing as she might be. Dick took a last desperate glance at the deserted lawn, and then, wriggling backwards down the ridge, so that he could stand up and still be out of sight from the house, plunged into natural history. One of the things he had set himself to find these holidays was a Fox Moth caterpillar. Heather, he knew, was where to find it. Heather was all about him, and he worked slowly to and fro searching clump after clump, trying hard to think of caterpillars and to forget how the minutes were slipping by. He could not forget and he had no luck in his search. He decided that Fox Moth caterpillars were probably only to be found on higher ground. He was sitting, looking out over the lake, watching yachts that were hardly moving, and a steamer that left a trail of smoke hanging above the water like a whitish slug, when he heard a very slight noise somewhere above him. He looked round and saw Dorothea beckoning to him."|"The Picts and the Martyrs Or, Not Welcome at All"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"“It’s going to be all right today, I know it is,” said Dorothea at last.
“Two and a half more minutes to two o’clock,” said Dick.
Suddenly their hearts fell, as two prim figures came out of the house."|"The Picts and the Martyrs Or, Not Welcome at All"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 03:00"|three|"“Of course, I’m not going to try anything really difficult,” said Dorothea. “Even Susan wouldn’t, not in camp. But there’s a lot about rabbits in it. And about ways of cooking eggs. It says three and a half minutes or only three if you want them lightly boiled.”"|"The Picts and the Martyrs Or, Not Welcome at All"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 09:11"|"Eleven minutes past nine"|"“Eleven minutes past nine … I say, I couldn’t help splashing with that oar when I looked at my watch.”"|"The Picts and the Martyrs Or, Not Welcome at All"|"Arthur Ransome"
"~ 00:00"|"about midnight"|"It must have been about midnight when the rain began. Dorothea was the first to hear a steady drip, drip somewhere close to her. Then she heard the pattering on the roof and then rain-drops that had come down the chimney hissing on the hot embers of the fire."|"The Picts and the Martyrs Or, Not Welcome at All"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 02:00"|"Two o’clock"|"“Two o’clock,” he said, as they bit into their apples after the meal. He went and stood in the doorway to listen."|"The Picts and the Martyrs Or, Not Welcome at All"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 04:00"|"Four o’clock"|"But all this time there was no sign of a prisoner escaping from Beckfoot. Four o’clock came. At half past Dorothea said, “Whatever they’ve been doing, they’ll be having tea with her now. They won’t come till after tea. Perhaps they aren’t going to be able to escape at all. We’ll have tea anyhow, and then, whatever happens, we must skin Jacky’s rabbit.”"|"The Picts and the Martyrs Or, Not Welcome at All"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 05:00"|"Five o’clock"|"Five o’clock passed, six and seven. Dick, more and more gloomy, was back in his clothes which were singed only in one or two small places. The hut, now that the leaks had been stopped, was no longer steamy. The rugs hanging on the beams felt warm and dry. Dorothea made up her mind. “No one will come now,” she said. “There’ll be their supper and then she’ll make them play the piano. We shan’t know what the message is till tomorrow. I can’t put it off any longer. I’m going to cook that rabbit.”"|"The Picts and the Martyrs Or, Not Welcome at All"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"It was nine o’clock by the time they had the rabbit jointed and in the saucepan with water covering it, and the chopped onion, and some salt, and a little milk, and a couple of potatoes, and a tin of peas. Lack of this and lack of that made it impossible to follow exactly any single one of the recipes in the cookery book, so Dorothea took hints from all, put the lid on the saucepan and pushed it in at the side of the fire."|"The Picts and the Martyrs Or, Not Welcome at All"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 10:30"|"half past ten"|"It was half past ten when Dorothea after a last careful prod decided that the rabbit was ready and pulled the saucepan from the fire. Squelching footsteps sounded outside. The next moment there was someone in the doorway, wet and piebald, in bathing things that glistened in the flickering light of the lantern and the fire."|"The Picts and the Martyrs Or, Not Welcome at All"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"They went to bed soon after Nancy had gone, but lay in their hammocks thinking of what they had to do. They heard the thunder die slowly away. They heard the rain stop. They woke to find bright sunshine and Jacky grinning from the doorway with the milk. They told him they had cooked the rabbit, and he tasted a bit and told them they ought to have given it more salt. “You’ve tried trout and you’ve tried rabbit,” said Jacky. “What you want to be doing is putting a nightline down for eels. You come to t’bridge today and I’ll show you.” They told him they couldn’t, but were almost afraid to say anything at all lest they should somehow let out that something serious was planned. Dick baled Scarab in the morning and dried her sail in the sun. At two o’clock, after eating what was left of the rabbit, they were both down at the harbour. Nancy and Peggy joined them there, but only for a few moments, just to make sure that everything was understood. They were to wait for moonrise, so as not to have to use a torch out of doors or to risk stumbling without one. The window would be open. “We could come down the trellis and help, but it would be silly, really. The more people are moving about the more chance there is of being heard. Nobody but Dick must come in.” “But if he’s caught?” “We’ll be lying awake ready for a rescue. But he won’t be caught. You’ve only got to do it quietly and nothing can possibly go wrong,” said Nancy, and then she and Peggy, who were in their white frocks, not in comfortables, had gone straight back to read aloud to the Great Aunt. Dick and Dorothea had got through the afternoon somehow. Dick had tried to look at birds. Dorothea had tried to read her cookery book. Both had failed. Dorothea had thought of going to sleep in their hammocks to make up for last night and to be sure of not being sleepy later on. But it was no good. They had their supper and Dorothea made it a good one, hotting up a steak-and-kidney pie. And then, when the sun had gone down and night had come, Dick took the three-legged stool to the door of the hut, and sat there, listening to owls, and watching for the rising of the moon."|"The Picts and the Martyrs Or, Not Welcome at All"|"Arthur Ransome"
"> 01:00"|"after one in the morning"|"THE burglars, who had not gone to bed till after one in the morning, woke late, but were up and dressed and had the kettle boiling for breakfast when Jacky, bursting with news, brought them their milk."|"The Picts and the Martyrs Or, Not Welcome at All"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"It was a full hour before Timothy thought of them again. Suddenly they heard the book slam, and a moment later he was stooping at the door into the fore cabin. “I say,” he said. “It’s two o’clock. You people must be starving.” Then he saw that Dick was rubbing the last of a pile of clean plates, and that Dorothea was anxiously breaking eggs into a basin, and at the same time watching a big lump of butter dissolving in a frying pan on the stove. “That’s mighty good of you,” he said. “Cleaning up like that. I’m afraid I’ve been rather letting things slide.”"|"The Picts and the Martyrs Or, Not Welcome at All"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 07:30"|"half-past seven"|"“Well, why not? You can’t come with us. Supper’s at half-past seven. Don’t try slipping up the river till then. Safe enough while she’s ladling out soup or telling us not to talk with our mouths full. But if she saw anybody near the house today she might want to stop them and ask questions. Aspirin and all, I bet she’s still in a bate when she wakes up. That doesn’t matter, so long as she doesn’t change her mind about letting us have a day off.”"|"The Picts and the Martyrs Or, Not Welcome at All"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 07:30"|"half-past seven"|"FOR the rest of that day and all the next the Picts had no news from Beckfoot except a short note from the Martyrs that they found in the letter-box in the wall by the road. Dick and Timothy had worked all afternoon, while Dorothea looked at books, tried to clean up a bit in the kitchen, made tea for them, and hurried Dick away in time to get back to the mouth of the river by half-past seven. They brought Scarab up the river without seeing anybody, left her in her secret harbour and went home, finding the note from the Martyrs in the letter-box. “The day after tomorrow. We can come. Tell Timothy. With any luck we’ll be able to start first thing.” They half expected a visit from Cook that night, but were rather glad she did not come, because she would have talked about the burglary and the actual burglars would have found it difficult to listen to her without giving something away. Next day, after pinning a note to the door of the hut to tell Jacky to leave the milk and to take the empty bottle, they sailed down to the houseboat after an early breakfast. All that day was spent aboard. Dick and Timothy worked in the cabin in such a powerful smell of chemicals that Dorothea left them to it and read a book on deck. Soon after tea the work was done, or at least the part in which Dick could help, and Timothy cleared them out."|"The Picts and the Martyrs Or, Not Welcome at All"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"“There isn’t a traitor in the place,” said Nancy. “And it’s all right anyway. Her train goes at two o’clock tomorrow. She’s packing this morning. And after all yesterday’s sleuthing, she’s sure to lie down in the afternoon. She isn’t going to have time to ask anybody anything.”"|"The Picts and the Martyrs Or, Not Welcome at All"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 02:00"|"Two o’clock"|"“Nay, if I knew that I wouldn’t be in such a scrow. Two o’clock she was away and it’s seven now, and Billy here was the last to see her in this world. …”"|"The Picts and the Martyrs Or, Not Welcome at All"|"Arthur Ransome"

">> 00:00"|"long after midnight"|"It was long after midnight when they heard footsteps outside. Nancy and Peggy had come up again from Beckfoot."|"The Picts and the Martyrs Or, Not Welcome at All"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"“It can’t be that,” said Peggy. “She’d done all her packing ready for going away, and Cook heard her telephoning to arrange with somebody to come at one o’clock to take her to the train, and she told Cook she’d be wanting sandwiches to take with her.”"|"The Picts and the Martyrs Or, Not Welcome at All"|"Arthur Ransome"

"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"It was never asked. They had left the islands and were sailing along towards the Beckfoot promontory. The Great Aunt had asked again about the time. Dick, narrowly avoiding a gybe while he looked at his watch, had told her. The Great Aunt had said, “That is very well. It would be unfortunate if I were not ready at one o’clock. I am really very much obliged to you both.” Dorothea was just thinking that things might go right after all, when she heard a sudden shout from the shore where the road ran close to the lake."|"The Picts and the Martyrs Or, Not Welcome at All"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap < 01:00"|"nearly one o’clock"|"“Ah, Cook,” said the Great Aunt. “It’s nearly one o’clock, when, as I think you know, I shall be going to the station. I hope you have remembered to prepare my sandwiches.”"|"The Picts and the Martyrs Or, Not Welcome at All"|"Arthur Ransome"
