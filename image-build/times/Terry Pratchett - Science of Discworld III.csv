00:00|midnight|"The moon rose. At midnight, Ponder Stibbons read what Hex had written, wandered across the dewy lawn to the Library, woke the Librarian, and asked for a copy of a book called The Origin of Species."|"Science of Discworld III"|"Terry Pratchett"

00:00|midnight|"We have heard the chimes of midnight, the saying goes. The wizards had not only heard them but also the ones at one, two and three a.m. They certainly weren’t interested in hearing anything at half past eight, however. The only occupant of the tables in the Great Hall was Archchancellor Ridcully, who liked an unhealthy breakfast after his early morning run. He was alone at the trestle tables in the big hall."|"Science of Discworld III"|"Terry Pratchett"

"~ 11:00"|Elevenses|"THE GLASS GLOBE OF ROUNDWORLD had been installed on a pedestal in front of Hex by the time most of the senior faculty were up and milling around. They were always at a bit of a loose end when Second Breakfast had finished and it wasn’t yet time for Elevenses, and this looked like entertainment."|"Science of Discworld III"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 01:00"|one|"‘Funny you should say that,’ said the man opposite. ‘One of ’em came up when I was working and asked if he could look at the copper nails I was usin’. Well, he takes out a knife, scrapes away at one, it’s a bit of rubbish iron under a skin ’o copper! Had to do half a day’s work again! Beats me how he knew. Tom said the chandler swore they were all copper when he supplied ’em.’"|"Science of Discworld III"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|Midnight|"‘Gentlemen!’ he bellowed. ‘Some of you already know what this is about, eh? We’re going to force a history on Roundworld! It’s one that should be there already! Something is trying to kill it, gentlemen. So if someone wants to stop it happening, we want to make it happen all the more! You will be sent into Roundworld with a series of tasks to do! Most of them have been made very simple so that wizards can understand them! Shortly our missions for tomorrow, should you chose to accept them, will be given to you by Mr Stibbons. If you do not choose to accept them, you are free to choose dismissal! We’re starting at dawn! Dinner, Second Dinner, Midnight Snack, Somnambulistic Nibbles and Early Breakfast will be served in the Old Refectory! There will be no Second Breakfast!’"|"Science of Discworld III"|"Terry Pratchett"
05:00|"five in the morning"|"IT WAS JUST GONE HALF five in the morning, too late for Nibbles and yet not time for Early Breakfast. Jogging through the grey mist, Archchancellor Ridcully saw the lights on in the Great Hall. Steeling himself in case Ponder had students in there, he pushed open the door."|"Science of Discworld III"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 01:00"|one|"‘That’s true. It’s not really a number at all. You can’t get to it starting from one. And that’s the problem, sir. Hex is right, the oddest number in the multiverse isn’t infinity, it’s one. Just one Charles Darwin writing The Origin of Species … it’s impossible.’"|"Science of Discworld III"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 01:00"|1|"There are two important things to understand about infinity. Although the infinite is often compared with numbers like 1, 2, 3, infinity is not itself a number in any conventional sense. As Ponder Stibbons says, you can’t get there from 1. The other is that, even within mathematics, there are many distinct notions that all bear the same label ‘infinity’. If you mix up their meanings, all you’ll get is nonsense."|"Science of Discworld III"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 01:00"|1|"Just add 1. A more spectacular way to find a bigger number than a googol is to form a googolplex (name also courtesy of the nephew), which is 1 followed by a googol of zeros. Do not attempt to write this number down: the universe is too small unless you use subatomic-sized digits, and its lifetime is too short, let alone yours."|"Science of Discworld III"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 01:00"|1|"If ‘umpty’ is any number, of whatever size, then ‘umptyplex’ will mean 10umpty, which is 1 followed by umpty zeros. So 2plex is 100, a hundred; 6plex is 1000000, a million; 9plex is a billion. When umpty = 100 we get a googol, so googol = 100plex. A googolplex is therefore also describable as 100plexplex."|"Science of Discworld III"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 03:14"|3.14|"Remarkably, it has an entirely sensible meaning. It is the cardinal of the set of all real numbers – all numbers that can be represented as an infinitely long decimal. Recall the Ephebian philosopher Pthagonal, who is recorded as saying, ‘The diameter divides into the circumference … It ought to be three times. But does it? No. Three point one four and lots of other figures. There’s no end to the buggers.’ This, of course, is a reference to the most famous real number, one that really does need infinitely many decimal places to capture it exactly: π (‘pi’). To one decimal place, π is 3.1. To two places, it is 3.14. To three places, it is 3.141. And so on, ad infinitum."|"Science of Discworld III"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 01:00"|1|"Fortunately, we’ve already solved that problem with our earlier convention: if ‘umpty’ is any number, then ‘umptyplex’ will mean 10umpty, which is 1 followed by umpty zeros."|"Science of Discworld III"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 02:00"|2|"1 To see why, double it: the result now is 2 + 1 + ½ + ¼ + ⅛ +  + … which is 2 more than the original sum. What number increases by 2 when you double it? There’s only one such number, and it’s 2."|"Science of Discworld III"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|MIDNIGHT|"IT WAS MIDNIGHT IN THE museum’s Central Hall when the wizards appeared. There were a few lights on; just enough to see the skeletons."|"Science of Discworld III"|"Terry Pratchett"
