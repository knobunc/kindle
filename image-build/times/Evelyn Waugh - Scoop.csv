It was very pleasant when all those noisy white men were shut away in their rooms; quite like old times; they brought in good money these journalists — heavens what she was charging them! — but they were a great deal of trouble; brought in a nasty kind of customer too — Hindoos, Ishmaelites from up country, poor whites and near-whites from the town, police officers, the off-scourings of the commercial cafes and domino saloons, interpreters and informers and guides, not the kind of person Mrs. Earl Russell Jackson liked to see about her hotel.
