"ap 11:00"|eleven|"“Content. He’s doing well. His mind is keen, his play is excellent. Young as he is, we’ve never had a boy better prepared for command. Usually they go at eleven, but at nine and a half he’s top flight.”"|"Ender's Game"|"Orson Scott Card"
"ap 06:00"|0600|"Ender Wiggin lay on his bed staring at the ceiling. Since becoming commander, he never slept more than five hours a night. But the lights went off at 2200 and didn’t come on again until 0600. Sometimes he worked at his desk, anyway, straining his eyes to use the dim display. Usually, though, he stared at the invisible ceiling and thought."|"Ender's Game"|"Orson Scott Card"
"ap 06:40"|0640|"At 0640 he had them dress out. He talked to the toon leaders and their seconds while they dressed. “Rabbit Army is mostly veterans, but Carn Carby was made their commander only five months ago, and I never fought them under him. He was a pretty good soldier, and Rabbit has done fairly well in the standings over the years. But I expect to see formations, and so I’m not worried.”"|"Ender's Game"|"Orson Scott Card"
"ap 06:50"|0650|"At 0650 he made them all lie down on the mats and relax. Then, at 0656, he ordered them up and they jogged along the corridor to the battleroom. Ender occasionally leaped up to touch the ceiling. The boys all jumped to touch the same spot on the ceiling. Their ribbon of color led to the left; Rabbit Army had already passed through to the right. And at 0658 they reached their gate to the battleroom."|"Ender's Game"|"Orson Scott Card"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"Carn Carby came to Ender as soon as he was unfrozen. He was a twelve-year-old, who had apparently made commander only in his last year at the school. So he wasn’t cocky, like the ones who made it at eleven. I will remember this, thought Ender, when I am defeated. To keep dignity, and give honor where it’s due, so that defeat is not disgrace. And I hope I don’t have to do it often."|"Ender's Game"|"Orson Scott Card"
"ap 07:15"|0715|"Anderson dismissed Dragon Army last, after Rabbit Army had straggled through the door that Ender’s boys had come through. Then Ender led his army through the enemy’s door. The light along the bottom of the door reminded them of which way was down once they got back to gravity. They all landed lightly on their feet, running. They assembled in the corridor. “It’s 0715,” Ender said, “and that means you have fifteen minutes for breakfast before I see you all in the battleroom for the morning practice.” He could hear them silently saying, Come on, we won, let us celebrate. All right, Ender answered, you may. “And you have your commander’s permission to throw food at each other during breakfast.”"|"Ender's Game"|"Orson Scott Card"
"ap 07:45"|0745|"They laughed, they cheered, and then he dismissed them and sent them jogging on to the barracks. He caught his toon leaders on the way out and told them that he wouldn’t expect anyone to come to practice till 0745, and that practice would be over early so the boys could shower. Half an hour for breakfast, and no shower right after a battle—it was still stingy, but it would look lenient compared to fifteen minutes. And Ender liked having the announcement of the extra fifteen minutes come from the toon leaders. Let the boys learn that leniency comes from their toon leaders, and harshness from their commander—it will bind them better in the small, tight knots of this fabric."|"Ender's Game"|"Orson Scott Card"
"ap 07:00"|0700|"0700, said the paper, and it was already 0630. Some of his boys might already be heading for breakfast. Ender tossed his uniform aside, grabbed his flash suit, and in a moment stood in the doorway of his army’s barracks."|"Ender's Game"|"Orson Scott Card"
"ap 09:56"|"four of ten"|"“We orient downward toward the enemy gate and use our lower legs as a shield. We avoid formations and keep our mobility. It helps that I’ve got five toons of eight instead of four of ten. Also, our enemies haven’t the time to respond effectively to our new techniques, so we keep beating them with the same tricks. That won’t hold up for long.”"|"Ender's Game"|"Orson Scott Card"
21:40|2140|"It was 2140 when Ender dismissed the evening practice. Weary but delighted at having seen something new, his army walked through the corridors back to the barracks. Ender walked among them, not talking, but listening to their talk. They were tired, yes—a battle every day for more than four weeks, often in situations that tested their abilities to the utmost. But they were proud, happy, close—they had never lost, and they had learned to trust each other. They trusted their fellow soldiers to fight hard and well; trusted their leaders to use them rather than waste their efforts; above all trusted Ender to prepare them for anything and everything that might happen."|"Ender's Game"|"Orson Scott Card"
"ap < 06:00"|"before 0600"|"He heard his door open softly, then close. He knew at once that it was his battle instructions. He opened his eyes, expecting to find the darkness of early morning, before 0600. Instead, the lights were on. He was naked, and when he moved the bed was soaking wet. His eyes were puffy and painful from crying. He looked at the clock on his desk. 1820, it said. It’s the same day. I already had a battle today, I had two battles today—the bastards know what I’ve been through, and they’re doing this to me."|"Ender's Game"|"Orson Scott Card"
12:00|noon|"Holding the paper, he walked out of his room. Dinner was nearly over, and there were a few people in the corridor, but no one spoke to him, just watched him, perhaps in awe of what had happened at noon in the bathroom, perhaps because of the forbidding, terrible look on his face. Most of his boys were in the barracks."|"Ender's Game"|"Orson Scott Card"
"ap 03:40"|0340|"Mazer wakened him before morning; the clock said 0340, and Ender felt groggy as he padded along the corridor behind Mazer. “Early to bed and early to rise,” Mazer intoned, “makes a man stupid and blind in the eyes.”"|"Ender's Game"|"Orson Scott Card"
