12:00|midday|"And while he gripped it, not in weakness or sentiment but for the sake of its density, and proof of its presence, and while the midday sunlight sifted itself to and fro across the room, a dreadful sound erupted in the courtyard and the open door of his room was all at once darkened, not by the chip-eared man but, more effectively, by the hindquarters of an enormous mule."|"Titus Alone"|"Mervyn Peake"
00:00|midnight|"That we, meandering these granular shores Should watch the ponderous billows at their play like midnight beasts with garlands in their jaws..."|"Titus Alone"|"Mervyn Peake"
"ap 01:00"|one|"It was obvious that the poem was still in its early stages. The novelty of seeing so distinguished-looking a man behave in a manner so blatant, so self-centred, so withdrawn at one and the same time had intrigued Titus so keenly that he had outlasted at least thirty guests since the poem started. The lady with the sapphires and Mr Thirst had long since edged away, but a floating population surrounded the poet who had become sightless as he declaimed, and it would have been all the same to him if he had been alone in the room."|"Titus Alone"|"Mervyn Peake"
"< 00:00"|"nearly midnight"|"By the time some balance was restored it was nearly midnight, and there was a general pulling down of cuffs, straightening of garments, fingering of coifs and toupees, a straightening of ties, a scrutiny of mouths and eyebrows and a general state of salvage."|"Titus Alone"|"Mervyn Peake"
00:00|midnight|"Then came the stroke of midnight, and for a few moments gooseflesh ran up every leg in Lady Cusp-Canine's party, swarmed up the thighs and mustered its hideous forces at the base of every backbone, sending forth grisly outriders throughout the lumbar landscape. Then up the spine itself, coiling like lethal ivy, fanning out, eventually, from the cervicals, draping like icy muslin across the breasts and belly. Midnight. As the last cold crash resounds, Titus, alone on the rooftop, easing the cramp in his arm, shifting the weight of his elbow, smashes suddenly the skylight and with no time to recover, falls through the glass roof in a shower of splinters."|"Titus Alone"|"Mervyn Peake"
00:00|midnight|"'I'll tell you,' continued Muzzlehatch. 'He takes it upon himself to fall through a skylight and bears to the ground one of the few women who ever interested me. O yes. I saw it all. His head lay sidelong on your splendid bosom and for a little while he was Lord of that tropical ravine between your midnight breasts: that home of moss and verdure: that sumptuous cleft. But enough of this. I am too old for gulches. How did you find us? What with our twistings and turnings and doubling back - we should by rights have shaken off the devil himself - but then you wander in as though you'd been a-riding on my tail. How did you find me?'"|"Titus Alone"|"Mervyn Peake"
12:00|noonday|"Theirs was a small talk - that evoked the measureless avenues of the night, and the green glades of noonday. When they said 'Hullo!' new stars appeared in the sky; when they laughed, this wild world split its sides, though what was so funny neither of them knew. It was a game of the fantastic senses; febrile; tender, tip-tilted. They would lean on the window-sill of Juno's beautiful room and gaze for hours on end at the far hills where the trees and buildings were so close together, so interwoven, that it was impossible to say whether it was a city in a forest or a forest in a city. There they leaned in the golden light, sometimes happy to talk - sometimes basking in a miraculous silence."|"Titus Alone"|"Mervyn Peake"
12:00|midday|"She put her mirror away and stretched her strong arms. The yellow stripes of her costume gleamed in a midday dusk."|"Titus Alone"|"Mervyn Peake"
00:00|midnight|"With difficulty he had raised Titus in his arms and together the three of them made their midnight journey to the green room at the end of the east wing. There, in this remote corner of the house, they laid him on a bed."|"Titus Alone"|"Mervyn Peake"
00:00|midnight|"Juno turns to him but she says nothing. The only movement comes from the black silk at her bosom where a great ruby rises and sinks like a buoy on a midnight bay."|"Titus Alone"|"Mervyn Peake"
00:00|midnight|"And now it was, for her voice, like a voice in a dungeon, awoke a string of echoes. Everything happened in the same split second. The scarves were whipped from Titus's wrists and eyes. The band crashed into dreadful martial music. Titus sat down upon a throne. He could see nothing except the vague blur of the juniper fire. The crowds surged forward as lamps blazed out of the surrounding tree-tops. Everything took on another colour... another radiance. A clock struck midnight. The moon came out and so did the first of the apparitions."|"Titus Alone"|"Mervyn Peake"
