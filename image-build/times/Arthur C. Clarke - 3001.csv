12:00|noonday|"The river ended in a translucent wall; he stepped through it on to the face of a desert, beneath a blazing sun. Its heat burned him uncomfortably - yet he was able to look directly into its noonday fury. He could even see, with unnatural clarity, an archipelago of sunspots near one limb. And - this was surely impossible - there was the tenuous glory of the corona, quite invisible except during total eclipse, reaching out like a swan’s wings on either side of the Sun."|3001|"Arthur C. Clarke"
00:00|midnight|"‘Apparently the arrival of Leonov triggered something inside Big Brother. If we did not have these recordings, no one would have believed what happened. Let me show you… here’s Dr. Heywood Floyd keeping the midnight watch aboard Discovery, after power had been restored. Of course you’ll recognize everything.’"|3001|"Arthur C. Clarke"
"ap 00:30"|"twelve thirty"|"COMSET! Channel one oh three - record from twelve thirty - correction - thirteen thirty. Sorry…"|3001|"Arthur C. Clarke"
18:00|"18.00 hours"|"The arrival of such a distinguished passenger had caused a certain disruption in the tight little world of Goliath, but the crew had adapted to it with good humour. Every day, at 18.00 hours, all personnel gathered for dinner in the wardroom, which in zero-gee could hold at least thirty people in comfort, if spread uniformly around the walls. However, most of the time the ship’s working areas were held at lunar gravity, so there was an undeniable floor - and more than eight bodies made a crowd."|3001|"Arthur C. Clarke"
12:00|noon|"Seated comfortably in his hoverchair, he was scarcely conscious of his increasing weight as he descended into the heart of Africa; though he did notice some difficulty in breathing, he had experienced far worse during his astronaut training. What he was not prepared for was the blast of furnace-heat that smote him as he rolled out of the gigantic, sky-piercing cylinder that formed the base of the Tower. Yet it was still morning: what would it be like at noon?"|3001|"Arthur C. Clarke"
"ap 00:50"|ten-to-one|"‘Accepted. Now please switch on your Braincap receiver. It will take three minutes to download this message. Do not attempt to monitor: I am using ten-to-one compression. I will wait two minutes before starting.’"|3001|"Arthur C. Clarke"
"ap 01:10"|"one hour, ten minutes"|"‘Well, Frank - it’s on its way. Will be landing in one hour, ten minutes. I assume that Halman can take it from there, but I don’t understand how he can actually handle - is that the right word? - these tablets.’"|3001|"Arthur C. Clarke"
00:00|midnight|"Like all the inhabitants of Anubis City (population now 56,521), Dr. Theodore Khan woke soon after local midnight to the sound of the General Alarm. His first reaction was ‘Not another Icequake, for Deus’s sake!’"|3001|"Arthur C. Clarke"

Midnight: Pico
It would be hard, Poole thought, to imagine a more peaceful scene - especially after the trauma of the last weeks. The slanting rays of a nearly full Earth revealed all the subtle details of the waterless Sea of Rains - not obliterating them, as the incandescent fury of the Sun would do."|3001|"Arthur C. Clarke"
