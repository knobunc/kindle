Sandy Woodrow took it like a bullet, jaw rigid, chest out, smack through his divided English heart. He was standing. That much he afterwards remembered. He was standing and the internal phone was piping. He was reaching for something, he heard the piping so he checked himself in order to stretch down and fish the receiver off the desk and say, “Woodrow.” Or maybe, “Woodrow here.” And he certainly barked his name a bit, he had that memory for sure: of his voice sounding like someone else’s, and sounding stroppy: “Woodrow here,” his own perfectly decent name, but without the softening of his nickname Sandy, and snapped out as if he hated it, because the High Commissioner’s usual prayer meeting was slated to start in thirty minutes prompt, with Woodrow, as Head of Chancery, playing in-house moderator to a bunch of special-interest prima donnas, each of whom wanted sole possession of the High Commissioner’s heart and mind."|"The Constant Gardener"|"John le Carre"

A couple of African vendors in Uncle Sam pants and top hats had opened a tea stand. Others were cooking maize on charcoal. Lacklustre policemen hung around a beaten-up patrol car, yawning and smoking cigarettes. Their leader, an enormously fat man in a polished brown belt and gold Rolex, was sprawled in the front passenger seat with his eyes shut. It was half past seven in the morning.

The organ was playing the Nunc Dimittis and Gloria, word-perfect, was singing lustily along. House evensong at her boarding school, Woodrow was thinking. Or mine. He hated both establishments equally. Sandy and Gloria, born unfree. The difference is, I know it and she doesn’t. Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace. Sometimes I really wish I could. Depart and never come back. But where would the peace be? His eye again rested on the coffin. I loved you. So much easier to say, now it’s in the past tense. I loved you.

They are the first words she ever addressed to him, and they trigger a burst of laughter from the languid audience of fifty fellow lawyers who, like Tessa, had enrolled themselves for a two-week summer seminar on Law and the Administered Society. Justin repeats them now. How he came to be standing alone on the daïs, in a three-piece grey flannel suit by Hayward, clutching a lectern in both hands, is the story of his life so far, he explains, speaking away from both of them, into the fake Tudor recesses of the Woodrow dining room. “Quayle will do it!” some acolyte in the permanent under-secretary’s private office had cried, late last night, not eleven hours before the lecture was due to be given. “Get me Quayle!” Quayle the professional bachelor, he meant, postable Quayle, the ageing debs’ delight, last of a dying breed, thank God, just back from bloody Bosnia and marked for Africa but not yet. Quayle the spare male, worth knowing if you’re giving a dinner party and stuck, perfect manners, probably gay—except he wasn’t, as a few of the better-looking wives had reason to know, even if they weren’t telling."|"The Constant Gardener"|"John le Carre"

She’d told the same to Arnold and Ghita. We were taking alternate watches at her bedside. Arnold had supplied a safari bed. At four in the morning, Tessa telephoned me. There was no telephone in her ward so she used the Sister’s. She was distressed. Hysterical is the more accurate description, but Tessa, when she is hysterical, does not raise her voice. Wanza had disappeared. The baby also. She had woken to find Wanza’s bed empty and the baby’s cot vanished. I drove to Uhuru Hospital. Arnold and Ghita arrived at the same moment. Tessa was inconsolable. It was as if she’d lost a second child in the space of a few days. Between the three of us, we persuaded her that it was time for her to convalesce at home. With Wanza dead and the baby removed, she felt no obligation to remain.”"|"The Constant Gardener"|"John le Carre"

But at seven in the morning, Ely Place was deserted except for a dozen cars parked along the kerbside and a yellow light burning in the crypt of St Etheldreda’s Chapel. Labouring under the weight of Justin’s luggage, the two men clambered up four rickety flights to Ham’s office, then up a fifth to his monkish attic flat.

Ham reclined in a corner, in a wing chair worn old by generations of unsatisfied clients. Outside, an icy mist had come up from the river, frosting the railings outside St Etheldreda’s tiny chapel, scene of Tessa’s many unresolved arguments with her Maker. A lighted green noticeboard advised passers-by that the chapel had been restored to the Ancient Faith by the Rosminian Fathers. Confessions, Benedictions and Weddings by Appointment. A trickle of late worshippers passed up and down the crypt steps. None was Tessa. On the floor of the office, heaped onto Ham’s plastic tray, lay the former contents of the Gladstone. On the desk lay Tessa’s music case and beside it, in files marked with his firm’s name, Ham’s diligent assembly of the printouts, faxes, photocopies, notes of phone conversations, postcards and letters that he had accumulated in the course of his correspondence with Tessa over the last year."|"The Constant Gardener"|"John le Carre"

She wished she could break the habits of learned humility, of drawing her heels together whenever she shook hands with her betters, a practice instilled in her by nuns.
