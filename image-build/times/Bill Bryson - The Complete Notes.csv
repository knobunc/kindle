We were about to have a lovely summer and even now at ten thirty in the morning you could see that this day was going to be, by English standards, a scorcher. My original plan was to stroll west along the front to Craigweil, to see where the king had stayed, but that hope was dashed when I learned that Craigweil was torn down in 1939 and that today the site is lost somewhere beneath a housing estate. So instead I walked east along the promenade towards Felpham because that was the direction that nearly all the other strollers were going in and I assumed they knew what they were doing."|"The Complete Notes"|"Bill Bryson"

I had never experienced this stretch of coastline and had great hopes for it. I had printed out a timetable and carefully selected the 12.19 as the best bus for my purposes, but as I ambled to the bus stop now, thinking I had minutes to spare, I watched in mild dismay as my bus departed just ahead of a cloud of black smoke. It took me a minute to work out that my watch was not right, that the battery was evidently dying. With a half-hour to kill till the next bus, I went into a jeweller’s shop, where a cheerless man looked at the watch and told me that a replacement battery would be £30."|"The Complete Notes"|"Bill Bryson"

British train interiors used to be heavy and gloomy in a way that perfectly suited the dull, cheerless, stolid business of commuting. Now trains are full of bright oranges and reds. This one was rather annoyingly festive, like a children’s fairground ride. I felt as if I should have a toy steering wheel and little bell by my seat."|"The Complete Notes"|"Bill Bryson"

By the time we managed to rendezvous it was nearly one o’clock and we were to a man famished, so our first piece of business was to find a place to eat. On the edge of Lyndhurst is a famous beauty spot called Swan Green, where a clutch of thatched cottages overlook the aforesaid green. It is a view that has featured on many a box of fudge. Opposite is the Swan Inn, to which we now repaired, happy to be in each other’s company and looking forward to something to eat after our drives. We studied the bill of fare keenly, then presented ourselves at the bar to place our order."|"The Complete Notes"|"Bill Bryson"

"> 14:00"|"after 2 pm"|"Wishing for a cup of tea, I drove on to the historic town of Dartmouth, famed for its gorgeous setting on the River Dart and home of the Royal Naval College. On the outskirts, an illuminated sign beside the road told me on no account to drive into town but to use the park-and-ride system on the perimeter, but I went anyway to see if they were lying. They weren’t. Dartmouth was heaving and it was impossible to park, so I went all around the one-way system and back up the steep hill to an extraordinarily distant park-and-ride car park, where I should have gone in the first place. Parking cost £5, which seemed outrageous to me, bearing in mind that all I wanted was a cup of tea and that I was severely inconveniencing myself already for the sake of their economy, but I felt slightly mollified when I discovered that it was £3 after 2 pm. So I rode a bus back into town and had a shuffle around, which is what tens of thousands of other people, most of them of about my age and socio-economic background, were doing. This, I realized, is my future: a dotage spent shuffling around in places like Dartmouth, visiting shops and tearooms, bitching about crowds and costly, inconvenient park-and-ride schemes."|"The Complete Notes"|"Bill Bryson"
"ap ~ 08:40"|"about 8.40"|"Across the street from the Ganges was a good pub called the Turk’s Head. I looked through the window now and it was heaving with a Saturday night crowd, so I walked down the street to another good pub, the Admiral Benbow, and it was even fuller. I went back to the Turk’s Head and waded into the throng at the bar. It took an age to get a pint, but to my joy when I turned from the bar I spied a tiny table by the door being vacated and I grabbed it. When I asked a passing waitress about food, she was happy to take an order, but was candid in telling me that service was going to be very slow. The upshot was that for the rest of the evening about every forty minutes the waitress would bring something to my table, and assure me that I hadn’t been forgotten. Generally what she brought was something that would help me with my food when eventually it came – salt and pepper shakers, cutlery wrapped in a paper napkin – but once she brought a slice of bread and butter, which I devoured more or less in a single gulp, like a frog with a fly. At about 8.40, I got a bowl of soup, steaming and delicious, and after a further long interval I received my main course of fish and chips. In between, I had a little bowl of tartar sauce, a pat of butter and many pints of beer. I also learned that if you drink a sufficient amount, dinner ceases to matter very much."|"The Complete Notes"|"Bill Bryson"

He had left school at twelve, but he continued to educate himself through private study, and acquired certificates of attainment in geography, geology, astronomy and drawing. My own interest in him began when I lived in Norfolk and discovered that he had married a girl from our village and lived with her for some years on a neighbouring property called Church Farm. Brown had a rustic Norfolk accent his whole life and was often likened in appearance and manner to a ferret, but he had a genius for archaeology. He spent nearly all his free time cycling around Norfolk looking for likely archaeological sites and, to an almost uncanny degree, finding them."|"The Complete Notes"|"Bill Bryson"

10:00|"10 am"|"Not long before this, my wife and I ordered a sofa from a shop on the Fulham Road in London, and on a Saturday in May, just before the May Day bank holiday, we travelled all the way into London from Hampshire to complete the paperwork. When we got to the shop, we found three other couples standing outside. The door was locked and the interior in darkness. This was at 10 am on a Saturday morning, thirty minutes after the posted opening time. We all took turns peering through the glass door, as if one of us might spot something that the others had missed. There was no sign in the window to indicate why the shop was shut. People with smartphones activated their thumbs and reported that there was no notice on the shop’s website. One man rang the shop, and we could hear the ringing inside, but obviously there was no one there to answer it. After about twenty or twenty-five minutes, we all gave up and wandered off. Three days later, curious as to what had happened, I called the shop for an explanation."|"The Complete Notes"|"Bill Bryson"

For reasons considerably beyond my knowledge, the castle is called Bolton Castle while the village beside it is Castle Bolton. Bolton Castle dates from the late fourteenth century and is impressive in an austere sort of way. Admission to view the castle was £8.50, which was more than I was willing to pay by a multiple of about four. Besides, I was running very late. It was much further from Leyburn than I had remembered. It had taken me nearly two hours to get there, which meant that I wouldn’t get back to my car till after 5 pm, and I still had about an hour’s drive after that. This little side trip, glorious as it was, was costing me my happy hour.

The landscape was pure grandeur – mile upon mile of hills, lochs, open sea, tumbling rills and massive glens, all continually reshuffled into new combinations of unsurpassable majesty. It wasn’t nearly as remote in feeling as I had expected. All along the way there were crofters’ cottages and rambling lochside hotels, even occasional small communities. At the village of Scourie, I passed a sign that said ‘Scourie Beach and Burial Ground’, which seemed an enchanting combination. (‘We’re burying Grannie tomorrow.
