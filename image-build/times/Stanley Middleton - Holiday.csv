"ap 00:03"|"three minutes past twelve"|"The lounge, at three minutes past twelve, was empty, momentarily dark, and warm. Backed by shelves of bottles, each reflected in the mirror behind, the barman pulled a white coat over his shirtsleeves. He served Fisher without hurry, remarked on the sunshine and temperature before moving across to the other counter. Here it was as quiet as the chapel, but gayer, bittier; no place of worship boasted a plush carpet. Sipping his ale, Edwin Fisher considered the afternoon."|Holiday|"Stanley Middleton"
18:30|"six-thirty in the evening"|"He could hear footsteps, the occasional shout of reprimand that denoted children. Who came to these places, now that the package deals to Ibiza or Tangiers were so cheap? The conservative? The family man and dependants? The almost poor? He stopped the questions, began to lecture himself. He’d no right to this superiority. Let them crook fingers at coffee cups and boast of their cars, or be uncertain whether to laugh at or slap their boisterous kids they’d be better than he. Better? Humans? Even if they’d robbed the gas-meter to give themselves inclement indigestion at six-thirty in the evening."|Holiday|"Stanley Middleton"
"ap 06:00"|six|"He’d woken uncomfortably before six and having shaved to the seven o’clock news on his transistor set, had shined his shoes and set out. Again there was an appearance of ceremonial to be kept up. His father had always taken him out for a trot on the promenade, a newspaper and a few improving words to the swing of a walking stick. The old man had been energetic; one granted that. As the pair gathered speed, and Fisher seemded to recall running quite desperately to keep abreast, his father would draw his attention to the clean air, the ozone, the smell of bacon frying, the morning sun’s sheen on the great windows of the sea-front hotels. He’d gesture with his walking-stick at the sand and reach some conclusion about last evening’s weather; they’d consult the tide-clocks and try to make head or tail of them, or the two-day old graphs of sunshine. ‘Finest hour of the day,’ Arthur Fisher would intone, handing his Journal with its inch-high headlines to his son. Edwin had not liked that; he was no dog. Besides if the paper were creased or rucked by a small sweaty hand, there’d be trouble when father, brushing his moustache bushy, sat down to page one and a few comments before the breakfast-gong."|Holiday|"Stanley Middleton"

‘Here,’ he said. ‘Eight o’clock. Or somewhere else, if you like.’
Now she stood composed, statuesque, but he would not have been surprised if she had wheeled and stalked off. She nodded."|Holiday|"Stanley Middleton"

London he disliked, especially the travelling and here again Meg acted oddly. She had a job, as distant as his own, but claimed, with all her father’s perversity, that the time wasted on trains was well spent, kept her out of mischief, in form. Sometimes she visited two colleagues who lived in a flat near the school and what with his societies they never took their evening meal before nine. He looked back to this as a period of continual tiredness when they lay in bed till midday both Saturday and Sunday. In the holidays they travelled, to Athens, Tunis, often to France, once to the United States, returning burnt brown, weary with talk of local wines or prices to shoot at Meg’s parents on the one-day visit allotted to them. That became a game. ‘Impress your father.’"|Holiday|"Stanley Middleton"

‘At a quarter past nine.’
‘Yes. My grapefruit doesn’t occupy me long.’ He slapped his midriff, blowing. ‘I wanted to catch you before you went out.’"|Holiday|"Stanley Middleton"
"ap < 10:00"|"nearly ten"|"Vernon stroked his chin, because this was the kind of situation in which he excelled. For the next ten minutes he and Fisher would argue, he suavely, the younger as he liked, and at the end agreement would be reached when his son-in-law capitulated. This morning, perhaps because of the early hour, the process took a little longer, so that it was nearly ten and the other guests had been heard to leave before they’d finished."|Holiday|"Stanley Middleton"
00:00|midnight|"Striding out, shoulders back, he hummed the Victorian slop. A yucca stood in full ridiculous bloom. A child smiled at him from a garden gate. Dark, dark has been the midnight. A window-cleaner in boiler suit continued the process of cleansing, his mop thumping the glass. An electric bread-van hummed past and from over the houses he heard the clash and rattle of milk-bottles, a whistle. And glory, glory dwelleth."|Holiday|"Stanley Middleton"
"ap < 11:00"|"almost eleven"|"As it was almost eleven, he turned in near the front for self-service coffee. The restaurant, a new flat-roofed place in one storey, was neat with plate glass and pebble-dash, and inside, though not yet crowded, already scarred with litter, screwed crisp-bags, balls of silver paper, spillings of salt and sugar."|Holiday|"Stanley Middleton"
12:00|noon|"The boat lifted, dipped, lifted, but gently and the prevailing effects were brightness and cold. Fisher wedged between a middle-aged matron and a young married woman began to feel exhilaration; this summarised his adventurous spirit, half an hour on a calm North Sea on a summer noon. Children trailed their hands in the water while the boat made a heavy, quick progress, the iron roar of the engine strong all the time. Once, they without warning, crossed a wave so that a shiver of spray showered the passengers who squealed, burst into chatter."|Holiday|"Stanley Middleton"
"ap 02:00"|two|"And she’d shrug him off, rationally, in what seemed to him a desperate appeal. He ought to settle her nerves, soothe or dominate her into sleep. Such fantasy nagged him. On holiday, at St. Tropez or Tunis, when they were drugged with sun, satiated with sex so that every muscle of his body relaxed into a perfection of comfort, she’d be awake at two, creaking the wicker chair in the bedroom, staring out into the light darkness, towards the small trees, the pool of night-sounds."|Holiday|"Stanley Middleton"
"ap 00:00"|twelve|"There’d been a little patch of awkward silence, then, but they were soon at ease with Carol pouring and bullying Tricia about her appetite for biscuits. At twelve Fisher made his excuses, spoke his pleasure."|Holiday|"Stanley Middleton"

"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"They now studied the menu, talked about food, though Irene clearly was on edge.
‘It’s one o’clock, David. Go and see.’
‘I’ve spoken to Lilian there, and she’ll ring through if Meg arrives.’"|Holiday|"Stanley Middleton"
"ap 01:18"|"one eighteen"|"They sat in silence, Fisher, embarrassed by the discomfiture of his parents-in-law, stumbled through conversational openings in his head, but made none. The clock showed one eighteen; John appeared again but treated them only to a raising of brows, a nod of understanding; the phone lay idle."|Holiday|"Stanley Middleton"
"ap 09:30"|"nine thirty"|"Fisher provided further drinks so that Hollies spoke louder, his wife smiled more foxily and Terry Smith staggered to the lavatory. Sandra, lips parted, had recovered her poise. Now the conversation became a duet between Hollies and Terry on the subject of football, the vandalism of fans, the temperaments of skills of players. They blamed managers, financial temptation, the press, ignorant children; as far as Fisher could make out neither attended matches, merely followed games on television Saturday night and Sunday afternoon. Both were bold with their sentences of condemnation, fervent in support of the other, often contradicting what had been said minutes before. A man from the next table joined in, as did the potman wiping tops and clearing empties. In the middle of this noisy enjoyment, Mrs Hollies said, out of character, squeaking,
‘It’s nine thirty, Jack. I shan’t get my walk down to the sea.’
‘You’re right enough here.’ Voice slurred."|Holiday|"Stanley Middleton"

23:00|"eleven at night"|"Now the house was thumped by heavy blows, as if someone beat a carpet violently but with lengthy rests between the thuds. He could not understand what she did, but imagined her standing with a broom thwacking the leather back of the new settee. The whole bloody neighbourhood would hear the performance; at eleven at night; through these thin walls their semi-detached privacy was small. Out of bed, dragging on his dressing-gown, he hesitated, agitating himself round the floor, not daring to go down."|Holiday|"Stanley Middleton"
"ap 04:00"|four|"‘She made a start. Got as far as Grantham. Felt afraid. Turned back. Was at home sitting about, all of a shake, when I rang at four. Had had no lunch.’"|Holiday|"Stanley Middleton"
12:00|midday|"He remembered Meg shouting at him, ‘Don’t you believe anything?’ Round them the Yorkshire valleys and a criss-cros of fields, small mills on the rivers, the ruins of railway tracks and beyond the bald mountains, hunched and ugly, scowling in the summer sun, the moors. The two of them sat, he remembered, under a fantastic pile of rocks, like pillars of grey toffee, curiously smooth amongst the grass, the tall willow-herb, the sycamore bushes that would soon be trees, tired, angry with each other because they’d clambered up a steep road, and kicked about a disused quarry and now at midday were miles from a drink. They’d sat, eating dry sandwiches, swatting at flies, searching for a subject to quarrel over. Money. They were not paying enough for their keep, she claimed."|Holiday|"Stanley Middleton"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"It was four o’clock now and he’d little joy as he ran out of the town into the flat countryside along a road that seemed composed of sandy dust. Why he bothered he did not know. He stopped by a house, built out on its own, surrounded by sheds, hen-coops, while in the untended square of ground in front a broken boat lay, massive, but holed, paintwork grubbily overlaid with pale dirt. Nobody moved in the place; no dog barked, cat slunk. He wound the window down to brood on this dump."|Holiday|"Stanley Middleton"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"He’d jumped, leapt from the room, slamming the door shut. He slept in the guest room, drove at nine o’clock across to the university where he’d found Bill Price-Jones already in his lab, and demanded room in his flat. Price-Jones, pulling faces stroking his beard, asked Fisher if he was doing right."|Holiday|"Stanley Middleton"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"‘I’ve too much round there.’ She smoothed her frock tight round her buttocks. ‘Too much beer and bacon.’ She laughed, unattractively. ‘Is it ten o’clock yet?’"|Holiday|"Stanley Middleton"

Two more had disagreed so that by the end of the hour the three had been near violence. He seemed cut off, ignoring the wide-open eyes of the girls, incapable of protracted thought, waiting for 3.50 when he’d close his doors and drive headlong for the hospital where Meg had been all day. The flurry of words, the spilling of text-book jargon, the spattering of non-supporting circumstance, even the clenched fists and the raised voices made no impact. It is true he spoke; perhaps his usual sceptical approach to their dubious or misread evidence could be seen, but in reality he concentrated, was concentrated, on a sentence his wife had ’phoned him at one-thirty. ‘There’s no hope. He’ll die in a few hours.’"|Holiday|"Stanley Middleton"

Call on Mr Vernon, 10 a.m., Frankland T. Phone call. Important.
That summed the matter, for while they had been in cloud-cuckoo land at the ‘Feathers’ messages had been relayed, received; somebody had assumed responsibility. Life had progressed. He removed his shoes. The phrase, ‘life had progressed’ reiterated itself in his head, in the buzzing subdued activity, near words, that always spun, whirred there. He saw again the distant mountains, the snow peaks, the sage plains, the rising dust, föhn, tundra, the places he had never seen."|Holiday|"Stanley Middleton"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"Fisher shook hands all round. The proprietor and his wife spoke effusively, obviously puzzled why he should have patronised them, but determined to make something of it. The girls simpered over their tips, thanking him with blushes as they realised they lacked the correct form of wording for this man. Other guests pushed up, declared themselves pleased to meet him, hoped it would not be the last time, but signed the book in the hall, ‘Made very welcome. Lovely food. Thanks. Mr and Mrs A Marriott and Susan, 23 Rice Avenue, etc.’ with less panache, perhaps he suspected, fearing his schoolmaster’s eye. ‘There’s a ‘c’ in excellent, as I’ve told you often enough.’ Terry Smith spoke offhandedly, looked pale, but Sandra putting a cool, damp palm into Fisher’s, handed him a slip of paper on which she had written their address. ‘It would be a shame if we never . . .’ she said, not looking him in the face. He was touched, dictated his own in return but warned that it would be only temporary; that was grudging, fobbing her off already. Outside one of the men lined the children for a group photograph. By eight tonight with the boys in bed, and a linen basket piled high with sandy clothes, Mrs Smith would have forgotten the holidays, be annoyed that her neighbours had neglected to order a loaf and the milkman had left bottles in the sun, would have started life again. Fisher indulged his imagination, saw Terry pulling out the three inches of sherry left over from Christmas, insisting that he and his wife had a celebratory drink on a ‘first-class holiday, but I’m glad to be back.’"|Holiday|"Stanley Middleton"
"ap 03:30"|three-thirty|"By three-thirty he parked on the arm of a chair, and toed the carpet. His colleague’s note informed him that the flat was his alone until Wednesday. Fisher enjoyed the shabby symmetry of the place. Price-Jones hated mess, was a bit of an old woman, but decent, had brought food in for his friend, even a small joint for Sunday. Reader in physics, a dusty man, a widower without children, who’d let his house to the professor of surgery, and who moved in here, entirely happy, as far as he could judge, filling note-books with rows of mathematical symbols, and preparing, now, in these last three weeks, gastromomic treats for his refugee. He talked little, played the viola in the college orchestra, and was said to be up again for election by the Royal Society. Oddly, he’d no friend."|Holiday|"Stanley Middleton"
"ap 09:30"|nine-thirty|"In her second year at the university she had been taken ill. He had seen her not a fortnight before his parents announced her nervous breakdown, and she had seemed no different from any other time. They had met less frequently since both were preparing for exams, but he’d been invited to tea, and they’d listened to the Beethoven Trio, Op. 70, No. 2 in Eb. They’d played it through twice, commenting favourably, and wondering why the composer had written so popular a work at this period. They’d squatted on the carpet in front of the gas fire and she had sat with her chin on her knees so that he could see her unstockinged thighs, a triangle of white knickers. This was unusual, and had excited him, but nothing came of it; they talked about William Cobbett and Spenser before she’d made him a cup of coffee at nine-thirty and sent him packing."|Holiday|"Stanley Middleton"
