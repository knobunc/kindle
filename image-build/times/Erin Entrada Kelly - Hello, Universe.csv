"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"That’s not to say Gulliver was quiet. Even though he still held on to his instinctual ways, he was comfortable enough that he ventured around the cage and made quite a bit of noise. He liked to rattle his water bottle, for one thing. That’s what woke Virgil up at seven o’clock on Saturday morning."|"Hello, Universe"|"Erin Entrada Kelly"
"ap 07:30"|"seven thirty"|"There is a special light in the hallway that blinks when someone rings the doorbell. This morning I wake up and see it flashing through my half-open bedroom door. I’m not sure what kind of sadist rings doorbells at seven thirty on a Saturday morning, but I’m going to find out because I’m the only one awake. I can tell by the way the house feels. Like even the walls are asleep."|"Hello, Universe"|"Erin Entrada Kelly"
"ap 07:30"|"seven thirty"|"I close the door and look at that pamphlet. It looks like something for church. On the outside it says, in great big letters, ONLY THOSE WHO LISTEN TO THE WORD CAN HEAR IT. That’s kinda funny, all things considered. But it’s really a shame that Greg/Craig didn’t stay to talk to me, because I bet there aren’t many people who would be willing to listen, especially since they’re going around ringing doorbells at seven thirty on a Saturday morning. I would have listened, though."|"Hello, Universe"|"Erin Entrada Kelly"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"Turns out, my need to find a cure for nightmares outweighs my fear of maniacs. I’ve decided to take my chances. My appointment is at one o’clock. One sharp, actually. Apparently Kaori Tanaka is very serious about being on time, which makes me think maybe she’s not a killer. I don’t think punctuality would be number one on her list of worries if she was."|"Hello, Universe"|"Erin Entrada Kelly"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"Petty items like furniture crowded the spirit chamber, so Kaori kept it sparse. Her parents forced her to have a bed, but she convinced them to banish the dresser to the garage. Her closet was overstuffed, but it was worth it. The extra space allowed her to examine the star chart from various angles, which was exactly what she was doing at eight o’clock Saturday morning after nudging her sister out of bed. There was important business to consider: how does one unite a Pisces and Scorpio without interfering with the destiny of the stars? This was a delicate matter. It was one thing to use the existing magnetic forces of fate. It was another to manipulate the universe to do your bidding."|"Hello, Universe"|"Erin Entrada Kelly"
"ap 10:15"|"ten fifteen"|"Virgil looked at his phone. It was ten fifteen. Maybe he’d just snatch up the next stones he saw and rush to Kaori’s house. She might not mind if he got there early."|"Hello, Universe"|"Erin Entrada Kelly"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"I only pray at night, because it’s my least favorite time of day. Everything is still and dark, and I have too much time to think. One thought leads to another until it’s two in the morning and I haven’t slept a wink. Or I’ve slept, but not well."|"Hello, Universe"|"Erin Entrada Kelly"
"ap 03:30"|"three thirty"|"“What time is it?” Kaori had asked one afternoon a few years before, when Gen was just starting to learn. Kaori had drawn a clock on a sheet of paper. Anyone could see it was three thirty—the peak of the witching hour—but Gen stared at the clock blankly. Instead of giving the right time, Gen sat down with her legs stretched in front of her and grabbed her toes. She’d always been a wiggly girl."|"Hello, Universe"|"Erin Entrada Kelly"
"ap 08:13"|"eight thirteen"|"One of the things Kaori appreciated most about Virgil was his punctuality. If he said he would be somewhere at eight thirteen and forty seconds, that’s what time he would arrive. Sometimes a little earlier, but never later. Not even by a minute."|"Hello, Universe"|"Erin Entrada Kelly"
"ap 11:30"|"eleven thirty"|"Virgil didn’t answer the text, so Kaori called. It went straight to his generic voicemail. Kaori hung up, leaned against the wall in the hallway, and chewed her bottom lip.
At eleven thirty she developed a pit of concern in her belly.
At eleven thirty-five, she considered that something could be gravely wrong."|"Hello, Universe"|"Erin Entrada Kelly"
"ap 11:35"|"eleven thirty-five"|"Virgil didn’t answer the text, so Kaori called. It went straight to his generic voicemail. Kaori hung up, leaned against the wall in the hallway, and chewed her bottom lip.

"ap 11:40"|"eleven forty"|"By eleven forty, she was convinced that Virgil Salinas had met a terrible fate and it was time to consult the crystals."|"Hello, Universe"|"Erin Entrada Kelly"
07:45|"seven forty-five in the morning"|"Virgil fed Gulliver and texted Kaori as he walked down the hall for breakfast. Under normal circumstances, he wouldn’t text someone at seven forty-five in the morning, especially not on the first day of summer—but nothing about Kaori was normal. Besides, she always seemed to be awake."|"Hello, Universe"|"Erin Entrada Kelly"
12:00|noon|"“What’re you reading about, Lola?” Virgil asked. He arranged the clementines in a perfect line in front of him, then checked his phone.
I am available. Be here at noon SHARP!
"|"Hello, Universe"|"Erin Entrada Kelly"
"ap 02:19"|"two nineteen"|"The clock on the wall—a hideously ugly and practical thing, in Kaori’s opinion—said it was two nineteen. She wondered how long people had to be lost to be considered a missing person. It hadn’t been that long, but a lot of bad things could happen in three hours and nineteen minutes."|"Hello, Universe"|"Erin Entrada Kelly"

07:45|"seven forty-five in the morning"|"Kaori was mildly surprised to get a text from one of her clients (her only client, truth be told) on the first day of summer, particularly at seven forty-five in the morning. But the night before, just as she was gliding to sleep, she’d had the vision of a hawk perched on a giant fence post. Only now she realized it must have been a vulture, not a hawk. And vulture started with V, just like Virgil’s name. The connection couldn’t have been clearer."|"Hello, Universe"|"Erin Entrada Kelly"
00:00|midnight|"It’s nearing midnight now. The room has been dark for hours except for the light of my phone. I’m yawning, and Kaori and I have finally decided to save the rest of our conversation for tomorrow. But we have a solid base plan. Our next move will be finding clients."|"Hello, Universe"|"Erin Entrada Kelly"
00:33|"thirty-three minutes after midnight"|"I pick it up. My eyes burn because the screen is so bright.
It’s thirty-three minutes after midnight.
It’s Lola’s number, but I know right away it isn’t Lola."|"Hello, Universe"|"Erin Entrada Kelly"
11:00|"eleven a.m."|"“Find five stones, each of a different size. Then bring them to me next Saturday at eleven a.m. sharp. Got it?”"|"Hello, Universe"|"Erin Entrada Kelly"
