By the time I do manage to get in there I’m feeling a bit sour at having all these people barging about the place, and thinking about a couple of thousand more that live in the town and have to be transported to the church. Being in a bit of a flap I forget to shoot the bolt behind me and it doesn’t improve my temper when the door flies open and young Dorothy and Angela catch me without pants. This amuses them no end and I wonder if I can’t arrange to fall downstairs and break a leg and give them a real laugh. A couple of proper horrors, Dorothy and Angela, twins, belonging to Auntie Agnes, one of my mother’s sisters. I know the Old Lady can’t abide them and she only had Chris ask them to be bridesmaids because she didn’t want to get across with Auntie Agnes who’s one of them sensitive types who go through life looking for any offence left lying about for the taking. I’ve only had one glimpse of Chris as she nipped across the landing and from the tight little smile she gives me when I make a crack that’s supposed to be cheerful I guess she won’t be sorry when it’s all over and she’s with David on the 3.45 to the Great Metropolis. It’s even affected the Old Man. I’m just about to go downstairs to get started when he calls me into the bedroom and I find him standing in his undervest and trousers in front of the wardrobe mirror."|"A Kind of Loving"|"Stan Barstow"

Jim opens his book and retires again; but I can’t afford to; I’ve got a lot to do before eleven and I hope Geoff Lister, my cousin, who’s looking after the other taxi, keeps his end going as well. I check the list for the umpteenth time, wondering if we can get them all there on time. It’s a tight list and I’m proud of that because I’m saving David’s money by having one less car than they thought. But it makes no allowance for lost time, so I’m hoping everybody’s ready and waiting."|"A Kind of Loving"|"Stan Barstow"

I hop round to the boot and rummage about for a jack. I slam it into position and begin to crank, praying we shan’t be bothered by some copper with time on his hands and a lot of silly questions to ask. I can’t imagine this driver ever changed a wheel before; somebody must always have done it for him while he was stripping for action. As it is, he’s hardly reached the working minimum when I’ve got the spare wheel in position and I’m tightening nuts like mad.

By the time I reach the door the top deck’s full and people are coming back down to stand inside. The usual second bus pulls in behind and most of the queue stand back to get on this. This is what I’d do usually but today I get on the first bus and stand. This way I’m all the nearer to Ingrid. She’s sitting up at the front next to the aisle with a woman I don’t know. I edge forward till I’m standing one seat behind her. The floor gives a shudder as the bus starts and I reach up and hold the bar and stand looking at her till the conductor’s voice brings me to again. Now this bloke’s well known on this run as a bit of a card. They say he’s an ex-army sergeant and everybody knows he doesn’t give a damn for anybody. You get the feeling that if the Archbishop of Canterbury got on in full rig-out he’d get the same treatment as anybody else, with maybe a bit of extra leg-pulling on the side. He’s got more neck than many a comedian at Cressley Alhambra, and that’s saying something. He gets up off the platform. ‘Nah, then, you workers, getcha fares ready, perlease! An’ look cheerful, for cryin’ out loud. Think about them ’at started at half past seven while you lot were still in bed… Yes, miss? Three-pennorth of the best? Ta!… What’s your pleasure, madam?

I hang down over the side of the bed and grobble for my socks. I put them on and then my slippers. I get out of bed and then I have to take the slippers off again so’s I can get my pyjama pants off. My britches feel as if they could stand up on their own; no losing the creases this weather.

I don’t know what colour she’d be at half past seven in the morning with no heat in the bedroom and the curtains stiff with frost but I like it well enough now. The colour spreads from her neck on to her chest, which is nicely covered and promises well for lower down. I sit there with half a pint of bitter in front of me and watch her. I’ve always had a fancy for bints like this; real tough bints, hard as nails, know all the answers, ready to put blokes like me in their place in two ticks, but as sexy and willing as you could wish for with the right kind of chap. She comes and reaches down for something under the bar right in front of where I’m sitting and I see further into the top of her frock than’s good for me in my frame of mind. Now, I think, if I’d had plenty of cash I could have picked up with a bint like this and I’d have been landed. Sex without complications, and love could wait till the right girl came along. Instead of that it all gets mixed up and complicated and before you know where you are you’re miles and miles up the creek with not a paddle in sight. And then I get the old dragging feeling inside me, because I’m married, hooked, and even if I turn my head this very minute and see the right girl standing behind me with Welcome, Vic, written all over her face there’s not a damn thing I can do about it.
