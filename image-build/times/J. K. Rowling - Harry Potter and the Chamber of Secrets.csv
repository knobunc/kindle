"ap 10:00"|ten|"“Too right, you will,” said Uncle Vernon forcefully. “The Masons don’t know anything about you and it’s going to stay that way. When dinner’s over, you take Mrs. Mason back to the lounge for coffee, Petunia, and I’ll bring the subject around to drills. With any luck, I’ll have the deal signed and sealed before the news at ten. We’ll be shopping for a vacation home in Majorca this time tomorrow.”"|"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"|"J. K.

"ap 10:45"|"quarter to eleven"|"They reached King’s Cross at a quarter to eleven. Mr. Weasley dashed across the road to get trolleys for their trunks and they all hurried into the station."|"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"|"J. K. Rowling"
12:00|noon|"“You were seen,” he hissed, showing them the headline: FLYING FORD ANGLIA MYSTIFIES MUGGLES. He began to read aloud: “Two Muggles in London, convinced they saw an old car flying over the Post Office tower … at noon in Norfolk, Mrs. Hetty Bayliss, while hanging out her washing … Mr. Angus Fleet, of Peebles, reported to police … Six or seven Muggles in all. I believe your father works in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office?” he said, looking up at Ron and smiling still more nastily. “Dear, dear … his own son …”"|"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 08:00"|"Eight o’clock"|"“Certainly not,” said Professor McGonagall, raising her eyebrows. “Professor Lockhart requested you particularly. Eight o’clock sharp, both of you.”"|"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 07:55"|"five minutes to eight"|"Saturday afternoon seemed to melt away, and in what seemed like no time, it was five minutes to eight, and Harry was dragging his feet along the second-floor corridor to Lockhart’s office. He gritted his teeth and knocked."|"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"So at seven o’clock, Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked straight past the doorway to the packed Great Hall, which was glittering invitingly with gold plates and candles, and directed their steps instead toward the dungeons."|"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"|"J. K. Rowling"
00:00|midnight|"It was an incredible sight. The dungeon was full of hundreds of pearly-white, translucent people, mostly drifting around a crowded dance floor, waltzing to the dreadful, quavering sound of thirty musical saws, played by an orchestra on a raised, black-draped platform. A chandelier overhead blazed midnight-blue with a thousand more black candles. Their breath rose in a mist before them; it was like stepping into a freezer."|"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"|"J. K. Rowling"
00:00|Midnight|"“Midnight,” said Harry. “We’d better get to bed before Snape comes along and tries to frame us for something else.”"|"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"As eleven o’clock approached, the whole school started to make its way down to the Quidditch stadium. It was a muggy sort of day with a hint of thunder in the air. Ron and Hermione came hurrying over to wish Harry good luck as he entered the locker rooms. The team pulled on their scarlet Gryffindor robes, then sat down to listen to Wood’s usual pre-match pep talk."|"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"|"J. K. Rowling"
20:00|"eight o’clock that evening"|"Harry and Hermione were all for it, so at eight o’clock that evening they hurried back to the Great Hall. The long dining tables had vanished and a golden stage had appeared along one wall, lit by thousands of candles floating overhead. The ceiling was velvety black once more and most of the school seemed to be packed beneath it, all carrying their wands and looking excited."|"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 03:30"|"half-past three"|"Harry peeled the wet pages apart. They were completely blank. There wasn’t the faintest trace of writing on any of them, not even Auntie Mabel’s birthday, or dentist, half-past three."|"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap < 11:00"|"nearly eleven"|"“You’d better get moving,” said Ron. “It’s nearly eleven — the match —”"|"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"|"J. K. Rowling"

You will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No student is to use the bathroom unaccompanied by a teacher. All further Quidditch training and matches are to be postponed. There will be no more evening activities.”"|"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"The Gryffindor common room was always very crowded these days, because from six o’clock onward the Gryffindors had nowhere else to go.

"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"Harry went to get the Invisibility Cloak out of his trunk right after dinner, and spent the evening sitting on it, waiting for the room to clear. Fred and George challenged Harry and Ron to a few games of Exploding Snap, and Ginny sat watching them, very subdued in Hermione’s usual chair. Harry and Ron kept losing on purpose, trying to finish the games quickly, but even so, it was well past midnight when Fred, George, and Ginny finally went to bed."|"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap > 10:00"|"After ten"|"They smashed their way through the undergrowth, Fang howling loudly in the back seat, and Harry saw the side mirror snap off as they squeezed past a large oak. After ten noisy, rocky minutes, the trees thinned, and Harry could again see patches of sky."|"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"|"J. K. Rowling"
00:00|midnight|"His office had been almost completely stripped. Two large trunks stood open on the floor. Robes, jade-green, lilac, midnight-blue, had been hastily folded into one of them; books were jumbled untidily into the other. The photographs that had covered the walls were now crammed into boxes on the desk."|"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 03:30"|"half past three"|"Harry had been to several Hogwarts feasts, but never one quite like this. Everybody was in their pajamas, and the celebration lasted all night. Harry didn’t know whether the best bit was Hermione running toward him, screaming “You solved it! You solved it!” or Justin hurrying over from the Hufflepuff table to wring his hand and apologize endlessly for suspecting him, or Hagrid turning up at half past three, cuffing Harry and Ron so hard on the shoulders that they were knocked into their plates of trifle, or his and Ron’s four hundred points for Gryffindor securing the House Cup for the second year running, or Professor McGonagall standing up to tell them all that the exams had been canceled as a school treat (“Oh, no!” said Hermione), or Dumbledore announcing that, unfortunately, Professor Lockhart would be unable to return next year, owing to the fact that he needed to go away and get his memory back. Quite a few of the teachers joined in the cheering that greeted this news."|"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"|"J. K. Rowling"
