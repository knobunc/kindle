The Wind People were always kindly in the summer time. They played with tumbleweeds, rolling them over and over and making them hide in the little hollows at the base of the cliffs.

He thought the whole earth might be a red stone for the sun to look through just before it set in the west. Probably it was. He couldn’t see any reason why it shouldn’t be. The sky at noon was a big turquoise bowl. He knew that, and at night it was the darkness stone of jet, set all over with shining stars."|"Waterless Mountain"|"Laura Adams Armer"

The curator ordered sycamore limbs to be brought, and Mother soon had the two posts firmly set in the ground. To these she tied a cross piece at top and bottom, and proceeded to make the frame for the woolen strings she wound up and down for the warp. As her rug was to be a small one she had the strings all stretched by noontime. She had brought her wool yarn with her from the desert."|"Waterless Mountain"|"Laura Adams Armer"
">> 00:00"|"long after midnight"|"It must have been long after midnight when Uncle was awakened by the distant cry of a prowling beast. He was not familiar with the sound. It was not like the yelping of coyotes nor of foxes. It was a terrifying yell of some big animal, which drew nearer and nearer to the camp."|"Waterless Mountain"|"Laura Adams Armer"
"ap ~ 09:00"|"about nine o’clock"|"On the fourth night about nine o’clock, Uncle’s assistant laid blankets on the ground, northwest of the fire. On top of the blankets they spread a buffalo robe. On top of that, many yards of new calico were laid, and on top of all, a fine white buckskin."|"Waterless Mountain"|"Laura Adams Armer"
"< 12:00"|"Before noon"|"Before noon the two were back home. Elder Brother had a prairie dog to take to his wife. Mother took care of the rabbit and said:"|"Waterless Mountain"|"Laura Adams Armer"
