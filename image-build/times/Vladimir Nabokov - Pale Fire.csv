      And speaking of this wonderful machine:
    

    
        I’m puzzled by the difference between

      Two methods of composing: A, the kind

      Which goes on solely in the poet’s mind,

      A testing of performing words, while he

      Is soaping a third time one leg, and B,

      The other kind, much more decorous, when

      He’s in his study writing with a pen.
    

    
      In method B the hand supports the thought,

      The abstract battle is concretely fought.

      The pen stops in mid-air, then swoops to bar
    

    
        A canceled sunset or restore a star,

      And thus it physically guides the phrase

      Toward faint daylight through the inky maze.
    

    
      But method A is agony! The brain

      Is soon enclosed in a steel cap of pain.

      A muse in overalls directs the drill

      Which grinds and which no effort of the will

      Can interrupt, while the automaton

      Is taking off what he has just put on

      Or walking briskly to the corner store
    

    
        To buy the paper he has read before.
    

    
      Why is it so? Is it, perhaps, because

      In penless work there is no pen-poised pause

      And one must use three hands at the same time,

      Having to choose the necessary rhyme,

      Hold the completed line before one’s eyes,

      And keep in mind all the preceding tries?

      Or is the process deeper with no desk

      To prop the false and hoist the poetesque?

      For there are those mysterious moments when
    

    
        Too weary to delete, I drop my pen;

      I ambulate—and by some mute command

      The right word flutes and perches on my hand.
    

    
      My best time is the morning; my preferred

      Season, midsummer. I once overheard

      Myself awakening while half of me

      Still slept in bed. I tore my spirit free,

      And caught up with myself—upon the lawn

      Where clover leaves cupped the topaz of dawn,

      And where Shade stood in nightshirt and one shoe.
    

    
        And then I realized that this half too

      Was fast asleep; both laughed and I awoke

      Safe in my bed as day its eggshell broke,

      And robins walked and stopped, and on the damp

      Gemmed turf a brown shoe lay! My secret stamp,

      The Shade impress, the mystery inborn.

      Mirages, miracles, midsummer morn.

      Since my biographer may be too staid

      Or know too little to affirm that Shade

      Shaved in his bath, here goes:
    

    
      “He’d fixed a sort
    

    
        Of hinge-and-screw affair, a steel support

      Running across the tub to hold in place

      The shaving mirror right before his face

      And with his toe renewing tap-warmth, he’d

      Sit like a king there, and like Marat bleed.”
    

    
      The more I weigh, the less secure my skin;

      In places it’s ridiculously thin;

      Thus near the mouth: the space between its wick

      And my grimace, invites the wicked nick.

      Or this dewlap: some day I must set free
    

    
        The Newport Frill inveterate in me.

      My Adam’s apple is a prickly pear:

      Now I shall speak of evil and despair

      As none has spoken. Five, six, seven, eight,

      Nine strokes are not enough. Ten. I palpate

      Through strawberry-and-cream the gory mess

      And find unchanged that patch of prickliness.
    

    
      I have my doubts about the one-armed bloke

      Who in commercials with one gliding stroke

      Clears a smooth path of flesh from ear to chin,
    

    
        Then wipes his face and fondly tries his skin.

      I’m in the class of fussy bimanists.

      As a discreet ephebe in tights assists

      A female in an acrobatic dance,

      My left hand helps, and holds, and shifts its stance.

      Now I shall speak … Better than any soap

      Is the sensation for which poets hope

      When inspiration and its icy blaze,

      The sudden image, the immediate phrase

      Over the skin a triple ripple send
    

    
        Making the little hairs all stand on end

      As in the enlarged animated scheme

      Of whiskers mowed when held up by Our Cream.
    

    
      Now I shall speak of evil as none has

      Spoken before. I loathe such things as jazz;

      The white-hosed moron torturing a black

      Bull, rayed with red; abstractist bric-a-brac;

      Primitivist folk-masks; progressive schools;

      Music in supermarkets; swimming pools;

      Brutes, bores, class-conscious Philistines, Freud, Marx,
    

    
        Fake thinkers, puffed-up poets, frauds and sharks.
    

    
      And while the safety blade with scrape and screak

      Travels across the country of my cheek,

      Cars on the highway pass, and up the steep

      Incline big trucks around my jawbone creep,

      And now a silent liner docks, and now

      Sunglassers tour Beirut, and now I plough

      Old Zembla’s fields where my gray stubble grows,

      And slaves make hay between my mouth and nose.

      Dressing in all the rooms, I rhyme and roam

      Throughout the house with, in my fist, a comb

      Or a shoehorn, which turns into the spoon

      I eat my egg with. In the afternoon

      You drive me to the library. We dine

      At half past six. And that odd muse of mine,

      My versipel, is with me everywhere,

      In carrel and in car, and in my chair.
    

    
      And all the time, and all the time, my love,
    

    
        You too are there, beneath the word, above

      The syllable, to underscore and stress

      The vital rhythm. One heard a woman’s dress

      Rustle in days of yore. I’ve often caught

      The sound and sense of your approaching thought.

      By quoting them, old things I made for you.

      To use but did not, dry on the cement.

      Maybe my sensual love for the consonne

      Yawn, and put back Shade’s “Poems” on their shelf.

19:59|"nineteen fifty-nine"|"Now I shall spy on beauty as none has

      Spied on it yet. Now I shall cry out as

      None has cried out. Now I shall try what none

      Has tried. Now I shall do what none has done.

      And speaking of this wonderful machine:
    

    
        I’m puzzled by the difference between

      Two methods of composing: A, the kind

      Which goes on solely in the poet’s mind,

      A testing of performing words, while he

      Is soaping a third time one leg, and B,

      The other kind, much more decorous, when

      He’s in his study writing with a pen.
    

    
      In method B the hand supports the thought,

      The abstract battle is concretely fought.

      The pen stops in mid-air, then swoops to bar
    

    
        A canceled sunset or restore a star,

      And thus it physically guides the phrase

      Toward faint daylight through the inky maze.
    

    
      But method A is agony! The brain

      Is soon enclosed in a steel cap of pain.

      A muse in overalls directs the drill

      Which grinds and which no effort of the will

      Can interrupt, while the automaton

      Is taking off what he has just put on

      Or walking briskly to the corner store
    

    
        To buy the paper he has read before.
    

    
      Why is it so? Is it, perhaps, because

      In penless work there is no pen-poised pause

      And one must use three hands at the same time,

      Having to choose the necessary rhyme,

      Hold the completed line before one’s eyes,

      And keep in mind all the preceding tries?

      Or is the process deeper with no desk

      To prop the false and hoist the poetesque?

      For there are those mysterious moments when
    

    
        Too weary to delete, I drop my pen;

      I ambulate—and by some mute command

      The right word flutes and perches on my hand.
    

    
      My best time is the morning; my preferred

      Season, midsummer. I once overheard

      Myself awakening while half of me

      Still slept in bed. I tore my spirit free,

      And caught up with myself—upon the lawn

      Where clover leaves cupped the topaz of dawn,

      And where Shade stood in nightshirt and one shoe.
    

    
        And then I realized that this half too

      Was fast asleep; both laughed and I awoke

      Safe in my bed as day its eggshell broke,

      And robins walked and stopped, and on the damp

      Gemmed turf a brown shoe lay! My secret stamp,

      The Shade impress, the mystery inborn.

      Mirages, miracles, midsummer morn.

      Since my biographer may be too staid

      Or know too little to affirm that Shade

      Shaved in his bath, here goes:
    

    
      “He’d fixed a sort
    

    
        Of hinge-and-screw affair, a steel support

      Running across the tub to hold in place

      The shaving mirror right before his face

      And with his toe renewing tap-warmth, he’d

      Sit like a king there, and like Marat bleed.”
    

    
      The more I weigh, the less secure my skin;

      In places it’s ridiculously thin;

      Thus near the mouth: the space between its wick

      And my grimace, invites the wicked nick.

      Or this dewlap: some day I must set free
    

    
        The Newport Frill inveterate in me.

      My Adam’s apple is a prickly pear:

      Now I shall speak of evil and despair

      As none has spoken. Five, six, seven, eight,

      Nine strokes are not enough. Ten. I palpate

      Through strawberry-and-cream the gory mess

      And find unchanged that patch of prickliness.
    

    
      I have my doubts about the one-armed bloke

      Who in commercials with one gliding stroke

      Clears a smooth path of flesh from ear to chin,
    

    
        Then wipes his face and fondly tries his skin.

      I’m in the class of fussy bimanists.

      As a discreet ephebe in tights assists

      A female in an acrobatic dance,

      My left hand helps, and holds, and shifts its stance.

      Now I shall speak … Better than any soap

      Is the sensation for which poets hope

      When inspiration and its icy blaze,

      The sudden image, the immediate phrase

      Over the skin a triple ripple send
    

    
        Making the little hairs all stand on end

      As in the enlarged animated scheme

      Of whiskers mowed when held up by Our Cream.
    

    
      Now I shall speak of evil as none has

      Spoken before. I loathe such things as jazz;

      The white-hosed moron torturing a black

      Bull, rayed with red; abstractist bric-a-brac;

      Primitivist folk-masks; progressive schools;

      Music in supermarkets; swimming pools;

      Brutes, bores, class-conscious Philistines, Freud, Marx,
    

    
        Fake thinkers, puffed-up poets, frauds and sharks.
    

    
      And while the safety blade with scrape and screak

      Travels across the country of my cheek,

      Cars on the highway pass, and up the steep

      Incline big trucks around my jawbone creep,

      And now a silent liner docks, and now

      Sunglassers tour Beirut, and now I plough

      Old Zembla’s fields where my gray stubble grows,

      And slaves make hay between my mouth and nose.

        Unfinished poem. Note for further use.
    

    
      Dressing in all the rooms, I rhyme and roam

      Throughout the house with, in my fist, a comb

      Or a shoehorn, which turns into the spoon

      I eat my egg with. In the afternoon

      You drive me to the library. We dine

      At half past six. And that odd muse of mine,

      My versipel, is with me everywhere,

      In carrel and in car, and in my chair.
    

    
      And all the time, and all the time, my love,
    

    
        You too are there, beneath the word, above

      The syllable, to underscore and stress

      The vital rhythm. One heard a woman’s dress

      Rustle in days of yore. I’ve often caught

      The sound and sense of your approaching thought.

      And all in you is youth, and you make new,

      By quoting them, old things I made for you.
    

    
      Dim Gulf was my first book (free verse); Night Rote

      Came next; then Hebe’s Cup, my final float

      In that damp carnival, for now I term
    

    
        Everything “Poems,” and no longer squirm.

      (But this transparent thingum does require

      Some moondrop title. Help me, Will! Pale Fire.)
    

    
      Gently the day has passed in a sustained

      Low hum of harmony. The brain is drained

      And a brown ament, and the noun I meant

      To use but did not, dry on the cement.

      Maybe my sensual love for the consonne

      D’appui, Echo’s fey child, is based upon

      A feeling of fantastically planned,
    

    
        Richly rhymed life.
    

    
                                I feel I understand

      Existence, or at least a minute part

      Of my existence, only through my art,

      In terms of combinational delight;

      And if my private universe scans right,

      So does the verse of galaxies divine

      Which I suspect is an iambic line.

      I’m reasonably sure that we survive

      And that my darling somewhere is alive,

      As I am reasonably sure that I
    

    
        Shall wake at six tomorrow, on July

      The twenty-second, nineteen fifty-nine,

      And that the day will probably be fine;

      So this alarm clock let me set myself,

      Yawn, and put back Shade’s “Poems” on their shelf.
    

    
      But it’s not bedtime yet. The sun attains

      Old Dr. Sutton’s last two windowpanes.

      The man must be—what? Eighty? Eighty-two?

      Was twice my age the year I married you.

      Where are you? In the garden. I can see
    

    
        Part of your shadow near the shagbark tree.

      Somewhere horseshoes are being tossed. Click. Clunk.

      (Leaning against its lamppost like a drunk.)

      A dark Vanessa with a crimson band

      Wheels in the low sun, settles on the sand

      And shows its ink-blue wingtips flecked with white.

      And through the flowing shade and ebbing light

      A man, unheedful of the butterfly—

      Some neighbor’s gardener, I guess—goes by

      Trundling an empty barrow up the lane."|"Pale Fire"|"Vladimir Nabokov"
"> 00:00"|"a few minutes after midnight"|"The poem was begun at the dead center of the year, a few minutes after midnight July 1, while I played chess with a young Iranian enrolled in our summer school; and I do not doubt that our poet would have understood his annotator’s temptation to synchronize a certain fateful fact, the departure from Zembla of the would-be regicide Gradus, with that date. Actually, Gradus left Onhava on the Copenhagen plane on July 5."|"Pale Fire"|"Vladimir Nabokov"
02:30|vigils|"Once, three decades ago, in my tender and terrible boyhood, I had the occasion of seeing a man in the act of making contact with God. I had wandered into the so-called Rose Court at the back of the Ducal Chapel in my native Onhava, during an interval in hymnal practice. As I mooned there, lifting and cooling my bare calves by turns against a smooth column, I could hear the distant sweet voices interblending in subdued boyish merriment which some chance grudge, some jealous annoyance with one particular lad, prevented me from joining. The sound of rapid steps made me raise my morose gaze from the sectile mosaic of the court—realistic rose petals cut out of rodstein and large, almost palpable thorns cut out of green marble. Into these roses and thorns there walked a black shadow: a tall, pale, long-nosed, dark-haired young minister whom I had seen around once or twice strode out of the vestry and without seeing me stopped in the middle of the court. Guilty disgust contorted his thin lips. He wore spectacles. His clenched hands seemed to be gripping invisible prison bars. But there is no bound to the measure of grace which man may be able to receive. All at once his look changed to one of rapture and reverence. I had never seen such a blaze of bliss before but was to perceive something of that splendor, of that spiritual energy and divine vision, now, in another land, reflected upon the rugged and homely face of old John Shade. How glad I was that the vigils I had kept all through the spring had prepared me to observe him at his miraculous midsummer task! I had learned exactly when and where to find the best points from which to follow the contours of his inspiration. My binoculars would seek him out and focus upon him from afar in his various places of labor: at night, in the violet glow of his upstairs study where a kindly mirror reflected for me his hunched-up shoulders and the pencil with which he kept picking his ear (inspecting now and then the lead, and even tasting it); in the forenoon, lurking in the ruptured shadows of his first-floor study where a bright goblet of liquor quietly traveled from filing cabinet to lectern, and from lectern to bookshelf, there to hide if need be behind Dante’s bust; on a hot day, among the vines of a small arborlike portico, through the garlands of which I could glimpse a stretch of oilcloth, his elbow upon it, and the plump cherubic fist propping and crimpling his temple. Incidents of perspective and lighting, interference by framework or leaves, usually deprived me of a clear view of his face; and perhaps nature arranged it that way so as to conceal from a possible predator the mysteries of generation; but sometimes when the poet paced back and forth across his lawn, or sat down for a moment on the bench at the end of it, or paused under his favorite hickory tree, I could distinguish the expression of passionate interest, rapture and reverence, with which he followed the images wording themselves in his mind, and I knew that whatever my agnostic friend might say in denial, at that moment Our Lord was with him."|"Pale Fire"|"Vladimir Nabokov"
">> 00:00"|"long after midnight"|"Often, almost nightly, throughout the spring of 1959, I had feared for my life. Solitude is the playfield of Satan. I cannot describe the depths of my loneliness and distress. There was naturally my famous neighbor just across the lane, and at one time I took in a dissipated young roomer (who generally came home long after midnight). Yet I wish to stress that cold hard core of loneliness which is not good for a displaced soul. Everybody knows how given to regicide Zemblans are: two Queens, three Kings, and fourteen Pretenders died violent deaths, strangled, stabbed, poisoned, and drowned, in the course of only one century (1700-1800). The Goldsworth castle became particularly solitary after that turning point at dusk which resembles so much the nightfall of the mind. Stealthy rustles, the footsteps of yesteryear leaves, an idle breeze, a dog touring the garbage cans—everything sounded to me like a bloodthirsty prowler. I kept moving from window to window, my silk nightcap drenched with sweat, my bared breast a thawing pond, and sometimes, armed with the judge’s shotgun, I dared beard the terrors of the terrace. I suppose it was then, on those masquerading spring nights with the sounds of new life in the trees cruelly mimicking the cracklings of old death in my brain, I suppose it was then, on those dreadful nights, that I got used to consulting the windows of my neighbor’s house in the hope for a gleam of comfort (see notes to lines 47-48). What would I not have given for the poet’s suffering another heart attack (see line 691 and note) leading to my being called over to their house, all windows ablaze, in the middle of the night, in a great warm burst of sympathy, coffee, telephone calls, Zemblan herbal receipts (they work wonders!), and a resurrected Shade weeping in my arms (“There, there, John”). But on those March nights their house was as black as a coffin. And when physical exhaustion and the sepulchral cold drove me at last upstairs to my solitary double bed, I would lie awake and breathless—as if only now living consciously through those perilous nights in my country, where at any moment, a company of jittery revolutionists might enter and hustle me off to a moonlit wall. The sound of a rapid car or a groaning truck would come as a strange mixture of friendly life’s relief and death’s fearful shadow: would that shadow pull up at my door? Were those phantom thugs coming for me? Would they shoot me at once—or would they smuggle the chloroformed scholar back to Zembla, Rodnaya Zembla, to face there a dazzling decanter and a row of judges exulting in their inquisitorial chairs?"|"Pale Fire"|"Vladimir Nabokov"

Into Alphina’s or Betty’s room another lodger moved, Balthasar, Prince of Loam, as I dubbed him, who with elemental regularity fell asleep at nine and by six in the morning was planting heliotropes (Heliotropium turgenevi).

"~ 04:00"|"about four in the morning"|"Her he remembered—more or less: a horsewoman, tall, broad, stout, ruddy-faced. She had been assured by a royal cousin that her son would be safe and happy under the tutelage of admirable Mr. Campbell who had taught several dutiful little princesses to spread butterflies and enjoy Lord Ronald’s Coronach. He had immolated his life, so to speak, at the portable altars of a vast number of hobbies, from the study of book mites to bear hunting, and could reel off Macbeth from beginning to end during hikes; but he did not give a damn for his charges’ morals, preferred ladies to laddies, and did not meddle in the complexities of Zemblan ingledom. He left, for some exotic court, after a ten-year stay, in 1932 when our Prince, aged seventeen, had begun dividing his time between the University and his regiment. It was the nicest period in his life. He never could decide what he enjoyed more: the study of poetry—especially English poetry—or attending parades, or dancing in masquerades with boy-girls and girl-boys. His mother died suddenly on July 21, 1936, from an obscure blood ailment that had also afflicted her mother and grandmother. She had been much better on the day before—and Charles Xavier had gone to an all-night ball in the so-called Ducal Dome in Grindelwod: for the nonce, a formal heterosexual affair, rather refreshing after some previous sport. At about four in the morning, with the sun enflaming the tree crests and Mt. Falk, a pink cone, the King stopped his powerful car at one of the gates of the palace. The air was so delicate, the light so lyrical, that he and the three friends he had with him decided to walk through the linden bosquet the rest of the distance to the Pavonian Pavilion where guests were lodged. He and Otar, a platonic pal, wore tails but they had lost their top hats to the highway winds. A strange something struck all four of them as they stood under the young limes in the prim landscape of scarp and counterscarp fortified by shadow and countershadow. Otar, a pleasant and cultured adeling with a tremendous nose and sparse hair, had his two mistresses with him, eighteen-year-old Fifalda (whom he later married) and seventeen-year-old Fleur (whom we shall meet in two other notes), daughters of Countess de Fyler, the Queen’s favorite lady in waiting. One involuntarily lingers over that picture, as one does when standing at a vantage point of time and knowing in retrospect that in a moment one’s life would undergo a complete change. So here was Otar, looking with a puzzled expression at the distant windows of the Queen’s quarters, and there were the two girls, side by side, thin-legged, in shimmering wraps, their kitten noses pink, their eyes green and sleepy, their earrings catching and loosing the fire of the sun. There were a few people around, as there always were, no matter the hour, at this gate, along which a road, connecting with the Eastern highway, ran. A peasant woman with a small cake she had baked, doubtlessly the mother of the sentinel who had not yet come to relieve the unshaven dark young nattdett (child of night) in his dreary sentry box, sat on a spur stone watching in feminine fascination the luciola-like tapers that moved from window to window; two workmen, holding their bicycles, stood staring too at those strange lights; and a drunk with a walrus mustache kept staggering around and patting the trunks of the lindens. One picks up minor items at such slowdowns of life. The King noticed that some reddish mud flecked the frames of the two bicycles and that their front wheels were both turned in the same direction, parallel to one another. Suddenly, down a steep path among the lilac bushes—a short cut from the Queen’s quarters—the Countess came running and tripping over the hem of her quilted robe, and at the same moment, from another side of the palace, all seven councilors, dressed in their formal splendor and carrying like plum cakes replicas of various regalia, came striding down the stairs of stone, in dignified haste, but she beat them by one alin and spat out the news. The drunk started to sing a ribald ballad about “Karlie-Garlie” and fell into the demilune ditch. It is not easy to describe lucidly in short notes to a poem the various approaches to a fortified castle, and so, in my awareness of this problem, I prepared for John Shade, some time in June, when narrating to him the events briefly noticed in some of my comments (see note to line 130, for example), a rather handsomely drawn plan of the chambers, terraces, bastions and pleasure grounds of the Onhava Palace. Unless it has been destroyed or stolen, this careful picture in colored inks on a large (thirty by twenty inches) piece of cardboard might still be where I last saw it in mid-July, on the top of the big black trunk, opposite the old mangle, in a niche of the little corridor leading to the so-called fruit room. If it is not there, it might be looked for in his upper-floor study. I have written about this to Mrs. Shade but she does not reply to my letters. In case it still exists, I wish to beg her, without raising my voice, and very humbly, as humbly as the lowliest of the King’s subjects might plead for an immediate restitution of his rights (the plan is mine and is clearly signed with a black chess-king crown after “Kinbote”), to send it, well packed, marked not to be bent on the wrapper, and by registered mail, to my publisher for reproduction in later editions of this work. Whatever energy I possessed has quite ebbed away lately, and these excruciating headaches now make impossible the mnemonic effort and eye strain that the drawing of another such plan would demand. The black trunk stands on another brown or brownish even larger one, and there is I think a stuffed fox or coyote next to them in their dark corner."|"Pale Fire"|"Vladimir Nabokov"

"ap 00:00"|twelve|"We shall now go back from mid-August 1958 to a certain afternoon in May three decades earlier when he was a dark strong lad of thirteen with a silver ring on the forefinger of his suntanned hand. Queen Blenda, his mother, had recently left for Vienna and Rome. He had several dear playmates but none could compete with Oleg, Duke of Rahl. In those days growing boys of high-born families wore on festive occasions—of which we had so many during our long northern spring—sleeveless jerseys, white anklesocks with black buckle shoes, and very tight, very short shorts called hotinguens. I wish I could provide the reader with cut-out figures and parts of attire as given in paper-doll charts for children armed with scissors. It would brighten a little these dark evenings that are destroying my brain. Both lads were handsome, long-legged specimens of Varangian boyhood. At twelve, Oleg was the best center forward at the Ducal School. When stripped and shiny in the mist of the bath house, his bold virilia contrasted harshly with his girlish grace. He was a regular faunlet. On that particular afternoon a copious shower lacquered the spring foliage of the palace garden, and oh, how the Persian lilacs in riotous bloom tumbled and tossed behind the green-streaming, amethyst-blotched windowpanes! One would have to play indoors. Oleg was late. Would he come at all?"|"Pale Fire"|"Vladimir Nabokov"
"ap 09:30"|"half past nine"|"The fat guard led the King back to his room and turned him over to handsome Hal. It was half past nine. The King went to bed. The valet, a moody rascal, brought him his usual milk and cognac nightcap and took away his slippers and dressing gown. The man was practically out of the room when the King commanded him to put out the light, upon which an arm re-entered and a gloved hand found and turned the switch. Distant lightning still throbbed now and then in the window. The King finished his drink in the dark and replaced the empty tumbler on the night table where it knocked with a subdued ring against a steel flashlight prepared by the thoughtful authorities in case electricity failed as it lately did now and then."|"Pale Fire"|"Vladimir Nabokov"
00:05|0:05|"It was now correctly conjectured that if Odon had fled, the King had fled too. At an extraordinary session of the Extremist government there was passed from hand to hand, in grim silence, a copy of a French newspaper with the headline: L’EX-ROI DE ZEMBLA EST-IL À PARIS? Vindictive exasperation rather than state strategy moved the secret organization of which Gradus was an obscure member to plot the destruction of the royal fugitive. Spiteful thugs! They may be compared to hoodlums who itch to torture the invulnerable gentleman whose testimony clapped them in prison for life. Such convicts have been known to go berserk at the thought that their elusive victim whose very testicles they crave to twist and tear with their talons, is sitting at a pergola feast on a sunny island or fondling some pretty young creature between his knees in serene security—and laughing at them! One supposes that no hell can be worse than the helpless rage they experience as the awareness of that implacable sweet mirth reaches them and suffuses them, slowly destroying their brutish brains. A group of especially devout Extremists calling themselves the Shadows had got together and swore to hunt down the King and kill him wherever he might be. They were, in a sense, the shadow twins of the Karlists and indeed several had cousins or even brothers among the followers of the King. No doubt, the origin of either group could be traced to various reckless rituals in student fraternities and military clubs, and their development examined in terms of fads and anti-fads; but whereas an objective historian associates a romantic and noble glamor with Karlism, its shadow group must strike one as something definitely Gothic and nasty. The grotesque figure of Gradus, a cross between bat and crab, was not much odder than many other Shadows, such as, for example, Nodo, Odon’s epileptic half brother who cheated at cards, or a mad Mandevil who had lost a leg in trying to make anti-matter. Gradus had long been a member of all sorts of jejune leftist organizations. He had never killed, though coming rather close to it several times in his gray life. He insisted later that when he found himself designated to track down and murder the King, the choice was decided by a show of cards—but let us not forget that it was Nodo who shuffled and dealt them out. Perhaps our man’s foreign origin secretly prompted a nomination that would not cause any son of Zembla to incur the dishonor of actual regicide. We can well imagine the scene: the ghastly neon lights of the laboratory, in an annex of the Glass Works, where the Shadows happened to hold their meeting that night; the ace of spades lying on the tiled floor; the vodka gulped down out of test tubes; the many hands clapping Gradus on his round back, and the dark exultation of the man as he received those rather treacherous congratulations. We place this fatidic moment at 0:05, July 2, 1959—which happens to be also the date upon which an innocent poet penned the first lines of his last poem."|"Pale Fire"|"Vladimir Nabokov"
"~ 03:00"|"about 3 A.M."|"Namely, July 5, 1959, 6th Sunday after Trinity. Shade began writing Canto Two “early in the morning” (thus noted at the top of Card 14). He continued (down to line 208) on and off throughout the day. Most of the evening and a part of the night were devoted to what his favorite eighteenth-century writers have termed “the Bustle and Vanity of the World.” After the last guest had gone (on a bicycle), and the ashtrays had been emptied, all the windows were dark for a couple of hours; but then, at about 3 A.M., I saw from my upstairs bathroom that the poet had gone back to his desk in the lilac light of his den, and this nocturnal session brought the canto to line 230 (card 18). On another trip to the bathroom an hour and a half later, at sunrise, I found the light transferred to the bedroom, and smiled indulgently, for, according to my deductions, only two nights had passed since the three-thousand-nine-hundred-ninety-ninth time—but no matter. A few minutes later all was solid darkness again, and I went back to bed."|"Pale Fire"|"Vladimir Nabokov"
12:00|noontime|"On July 5th, at noontime, in the other hemisphere, on the rain-swept tarmac of the Onhava airfield, Gradus, holding a French passport, walked towards a Russian commercial plane bound for Copenhagen, and this event synchronized with Shade’s starting in the early morning (Atlantic seaboard time) to compose, or to set down after composing in bed, the opening lines of Canto Two. When almost twenty-four hours later he got to line 230, Gradus, after a refreshing night at the summer house of our consul in Copenhagen, an important Shadow, had entered, with the Shadow, a clothes store in order to conform to his description in later notes (to lines 286 and 408). Migraine again worse today."|"Pale Fire"|"Vladimir Nabokov"
"ap 06:00"|"Six o’clock"|"As to my own activities, they were I am afraid most unsatisfactory from all points of view—emotional, creative, and social. That jinxy streak had started on the eve when I had been kind enough to offer a young friend—a candidate for my third ping-pong table who after a sensational series of traffic violations had been deprived of his driving license—to take him, in my powerful Kramler, all the way to his parents’ estate, a little matter of two hundred miles. In the course of an all-night party, among crowds of strangers—young people, old people, cloyingly perfumed girls—in an atmosphere of fireworks, barbecue smoke, horseplay, jazz music, and auroral swimming, I lost all contact with the silly boy, was made to dance, was made to sing, got involved in the most boring bibble-babble imaginable with various relatives of the child, and finally, in some inconceivable manner, found myself transported to a different party on a different estate, where, after some indescribable parlor games, in which my beard was nearly snipped off, I had a fruit-and-rice breakfast and was taken by my anonymous host, a drunken old fool in tuxedo and riding breeches, on a stumbling round of his stables. Upon locating my car (off the road, in a pine grove), I tossed out of the driver’s seat a pair of soggy swimming trunks and a girl’s silver slipper. The brakes had aged overnight, and I soon ran out of gas on a desolate stretch of road. Six o’clock was being chimed by the clocks of Wordsmith College, when I reached Arcady, swearing to myself never to be caught like that again and innocently looking forward to the solace of a quiet evening with my poet. Only when I saw the beribboned flat carton I had placed on a chair in my hallway did I realize that I had almost missed his birthday."|"Pale Fire"|"Vladimir Nabokov"
"ap 07:15"|"quarter past seven"|"From behind a drapery, from behind a box tree, through the golden veil of evening and through the black lacery of night, I kept watching that lawn, that drive, that fanlight, those jewel-bright windows. The sun had not yet set when, at a quarter past seven, I heard the first guest’s car. Oh, I saw them all. I saw ancient Dr. Sutton, a snowy-headed, perfectly oval little gentleman arrive in a tottering Ford with his tall daughter, Mrs. Starr, a war widow. I saw a couple, later identified for me as Mr. Colt, a local lawyer, and his wife, whose blundering Cadillac half entered my driveway before retreating in a flurry of luminous nictitation. I saw a world-famous old writer, bent under the incubus of literary honors and his own prolific mediocrity, arrive in a taxi out of the dim times of yore when Shade and he had been joint editors of a little review. I saw Frank, the Shades’ handyman, depart in the station wagon. I saw a retired professor of ornithology walk up from the highway where he had illegally parked his car. I saw, ensconced in their tiny Pulex, manned by her boy-handsome tousle-haired girl friend, the patroness of the arts who had sponsored Aunt Maud’s last exhibition. I saw Frank return with the New Wye antiquarian, purblind Mr. Kaplun, and his wife, a dilapidated eagle. I saw a Korean graduate student in dinner jacket come on a bicycle, and the college president in baggy suit come on foot. I saw, in the performance of their ceremonial duties, in light and shadow, and from window to window, where like Martians the martinis and highballs cruised, the two white-coated youths from the hotel school, and realized that I knew well, quite well, the slighter of the two. And finally, at half past eight (when, I imagine, the lady of the house had begun to crack her finger joints as was her impatient wont) a long black limousine, officially glossy and rather funereal, glided into the aura of the drive, and while the fat Negro chauffeur hastened to open the car door, I saw, with pity, my poet emerge from his house, a white flower in his buttonhole and a grin of welcome on his liquor-flushed face."|"Pale Fire"|"Vladimir Nabokov"

Feeling a bit nervous, as most people do at the prospect of seeing a doctor, I thought I would buy on my way to him something soothing to prevent an accelerated pulse from misleading credulous science. I found the drops I wanted, took the aromatic draught in the pharmacy, and was coming out when I noticed the Shades leaving a shop next door. She was carrying a new traveling grip. The dreadful thought that they might be going away on a summer vacation neutralized the medicine I had just swallowed. One gets so accustomed to another life’s running alongside one’s own that a sudden turn-off on the part of the parallel satellite causes in one a feeling of stupefaction, emptiness, and injustice.

"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"From his Geneva hotel Gradus had tried to get Lavender on the telephone but was told he could not be reached before noon. By noon Gradus was already under way and telephoned again, this time from Montreux. Lavender had been given the message and would Mr. Degré drop in around tea time. He luncheoned in a lakeside café, went for a stroll, asked the price of a small crystal giraffe in a souvenir shop, bought a newspaper, read it on a bench, and presently drove on. In the vicinity of Lex he lost his way among steep tortuous lanes. Upon stopping above a vineyard, at the rough entrance of an unfinished house, he was shown by the three index fingers of three masons the red roof of Lavender’s villa high up in the ascending greenery on the opposite side of the road. He decided to leave the car and climb the stone steps of what looked like an easy short cut. While he was trudging up the walled walk with his eye on the rabbit foot of a poplar which now hid the red roof at the top of the climb, now disclosed it, the sun found a weak spot among the rain clouds and next moment a ragged blue hole in them grew a radiant rim. He felt the burden and the odor of his new brown suit bought in a Copenhagen store and already wrinkled. Puffing, consulting his wrist watch, and fanning himself with his trilby, also new, he reached at last the transverse continuation of the looping road he had left below. He crossed it, walked through a wicket and up a curving gravel path, and found himself in front of Lavender’s villa. Its name, Libitina, was displayed in cursive script above one of the barred north windows, with its letters made of black wire and the dot over each of the three i’s cleverly mimicked by the tarred head of a chalk-coated nail driven into the white façade. This device, and the north-facing window grates, Gradus had observed in Swiss villas before, but immunity to classical allusion deprived him of the pleasure he might have derived from the tribute that Lavender’s macabre joviality had paid the Roman goddess of corpses and tombs. Another matter engaged his attention: from a corner casement came the sounds of a piano, a tumult of vigorous music which for some odd reason, as he was to tell me later, suggested to him a possibility he had not considered and caused his hand to fly to his hip pocket as he prepared to meet not Lavender and not Odon but that gifted hymnist, Charles the Beloved. The music stopped as Gradus, confused by the whimsical shape of the house, hesitated before a glassed-in porch. An elderly footman in green appeared from a green side door and led him to another entrance. With a show of carelessness not improved by laborious repetition, Gradus asked him, first in mediocre French, then in worse English, and finally in fair German, if there were many guests staying in the house; but the man only smiled and bowed him into the music room. The musician had vanished. A harplike din still came from the grand piano upon which a pair of beach sandals stood as on the brink of a lily pond. From a window seat a gaunt jet-glittering lady stiffly arose and introduced herself as the governess of Mr. Lavender’s nephew. Gradus mentioned his eagerness to see Lavender’s sensational collection: this aptly defined its pictures of love-making in orchards, but the governess (whom the King had always called to her pleased face Mademoiselle Belle instead of Mademoiselle Baud) hastened to confess her total ignorance of her employer’s hobbies and treasures and suggested the visitor’s taking a look at the garden: “Gordon will show you his favorite flowers” she said, and called into the next room “Gordon!” Rather reluctantly there came out a slender but strong-looking lad of fourteen or fifteen dyed a nectarine hue by the sun. He had nothing on save a leopard-spotted loincloth. His closely cropped hair was a tint lighter than his skin. His lovely bestial face wore an expression both sullen and sly. Our preoccupied plotter did not register any of these details and merely experienced a general impression of indecency. “Gordon is a musical prodigy,” said Miss Baud, and the boy winced. “Gordon, will you show the garden to this gentleman?” The boy acquiesced, adding he would take a dip if nobody minded. He put on his sandals and led the way out. Through light and shade walked the strange pair: the graceful boy wreathed about the loins with ivy and the seedy killer in his cheap brown suit with a folded newspaper sticking out of his left-hand coat pocket."|"Pale Fire"|"Vladimir Nabokov"

Initiation took place on Saturday, March the 14th, when I dined at their house with the following people: Nattochdag (whom I saw every day in his office); Professor Gordon of the Music Department (who completely dominated the conversation); the Head of the Russian Department (a farcical pedant of whom the less said the better); and three or four interchangeable women (of whom one—Mrs. Gordon, I think) was enceinte, and another, a perfect stranger, steadily talked to me, or rather into me, from eight to eleven owing to an unfortunate afterdinner distribution of available seats. My next treat, a smaller but by no means cozier souper on Saturday, May 23, was attended by Milton Stone (a new librarian, with whom Shade discussed till midnight the classification of certain Wordsmithiana); good old Nattochdag (whom I continued to see every day); and an undeodorized Frenchwoman (who gave me a complete picture of language-teaching conditions at the University of California). The date of my third and last meal at the Shades is not entered in my little book but I know it was one morning in June when I brought over a beautiful plan I had drawn of the King’s Palace in Onhava with all sorts of heraldic niceties, and a touch of gold paint that I had some trouble in obtaining, and was graciously urged to stay for an impromptu lunch. I should add that, despite my protests, at all three meals my vegetarian limitations of fare were not taken into account, and I was exposed to animal matter in, or around, some of the contaminated greens I might have deigned to taste. I revanched myself rather neatly. Of a dozen or so invitations that I extended, the Shades accepted just three. Every one of these meals was built around some vegetable that I subjected to as many exquisite metamorphoses as Parmentier had his pet tuber undergo. Every time I had but one additional guest to entertain Mrs. Shade (who, if you please—thinning my voice to a feminine pitch—was allergic to artichokes, avocado pears, African acorns—in fact to everything beginning with an “a”). I find nothing more conducive to the blunting of one’s appetite than to have none but elderly persons sitting around one at table, fouling their napkins with the disintegration of their make-up, and surreptitiously trying, behind noncommittal smiles, to dislodge the red-hot torture point of a raspberry seed from between false gum and dead gum. So I had young people, students: the first time, the son of a padishah; the second time, my gardener; and the third time, that girl in the black leotard, with that long white face and eyelids painted a ghoulish green; but she came very late, and the Shades left very early—in fact, I doubt if the confrontation lasted more than ten minutes, whereupon I had the task of entertaining the young lady with phonograph records far into the night when at last she rang up somebody to accompany her to a “diner” in Dulwich."|"Pale Fire"|"Vladimir Nabokov"

"ap 02:00"|two|"After scrupulously washing his hands, he went out again, a tremor of excitement running like fever down his crooked spine. At one of the tables of a sidewalk café on the corner of his street and the Promenade, a man in a bottle-green jacket, sitting in the company of an obvious whore, clapped both palms to his face, emitted the sound of a muffled sneeze, and kept masking himself with his hands as he pretended to wait for the second installment. Gradus walked along the north side of the embankment. After stopping for a minute before the display of a souvenir shop, he went inside, asked the price of a little hippopotamus made of violet glass, and purchased a map of Nice and its environs. As he walked on to the taxi stand in rue Gambetta, he happened to notice two young tourists in loud shirts stained with sweat, their faces and necks a bright pink from the heat and imprudent solarization; they carried carefully folded over their arms the silk-lined doublebreasted coats of their wide-trousered dark suits and did not look at our sleuth who despite his being exceptionally unobservant felt the undulation of something faintly familiar as they brushed past. They knew nothing of his presence abroad or of his interesting job; in point of fact, only a few minutes ago had their, and his, superior discovered that Gradus was in Nice and not in Geneva. Neither had Gradus been informed that he would be assisted in his quest by the Soviet sportsmen, Andronnikov and Niagarin, whom he had casually met once or twice on the Onhava Palace grounds when re-paning a broken window and checking for the new government the rare Rippleson panes in one of the ex-royal hothouses; and next moment he had lost the thread end of recognition as he settled down with the prudent wriggle of a short-legged person in the back seat of an old Cadillac and asked to be taken to a restaurant between Pellos and Cap Turc. It is hard to say what our man’s hopes and intentions were. Did he want just to peep through the myrtles and oleanders at an imagined swimming pool? Did he expect to hear the continuation of Gordon’s bravura piece played now in another rendition, by two larger and stronger hands? Would he have crept, pistol in hand, to where a sun-bathing giant lay spread-eagled, a spread eagle of hair on his chest? We do not know, nor did Gradus perhaps know himself; anyway, he was spared an unnecessary journey. Modern taximen are as talkative as were the barbers of old, and even before the old Cadillac had rolled out of town, our unfortunate killer knew that his driver’s brother had worked in the gardens of Villa Disa but that at present nobody lived there, the Queen having gone to Italy for the rest of July."|"Pale Fire"|"Vladimir Nabokov"
"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"The passage 797 (second part of line)-809, on the poet’s sixty-fifth card, was composed between the sunset of July 18 and the dawn of July 19. That morning I had prayed in two different churches (on either side, as it were, of my Zemblan denomination, not represented in New Wye) and had strolled home in an elevated state of mind. There was no cloud in the wistful sky, and the very earth seemed to be sighing after our Lord Jesus Christ. On such sunny, sad mornings I always feel in my bones that there is a chance yet of my not being excluded from Heaven, and that salvation may be granted to me despite the frozen mud and horror in my heart. As I was ascending with bowed head the gravel path to my poor rented house, I heard with absolute distinction, as if he were standing at my shoulder and speaking loudly, as to a slightly deaf man, Shade’s voice say: “Come tonight, Charlie.” I looked around me in awe and wonder: I was quite alone. I at once telephoned. The Shades were out, said the cheeky ancillula, an obnoxious little fan who came to cook for them on Sundays and no doubt dreamt of getting the old poet to cuddle her some wifeless day. I retelephoned two hours later; got, as usual, Sybil; insisted on talking to my friend (my “messages” were never transmitted), obtained him, and asked him as calmly as possible what he had been doing around noon when I had heard him like a big bird in my garden. He could not quite remember, said wait a minute, he had been playing golf with Paul (whoever that was), or at least watching Paul play with another colleague. I cried that I must see him in the evening and all at once, with no reason at all, burst into tears, flooding the telephone and gasping for breath, a paroxysm which had not happened to me since Bob left me on March 30. There was a flurry of confabulation between the Shades, and then John said: “Charles, listen. Let’s go for a good ramble tonight, I’ll meet you at eight.” It was my second good ramble since July 6 (that unsatisfactory nature talk); the third one, on July 21, was to be exceedingly brief."|"Pale Fire"|"Vladimir Nabokov"

08:00|"eight in the morning"|"It was now July 21. At eight in the morning New York roused Gradus with a bang and a roar. As usual he started his blurry daily existence by blowing his nose. Then he took out of its nightbox of cardboard and inserted into his Comusmask mouth an exceptionally large and fierce-looking set of teeth: the only bad flaw really in his otherwise harmless appearance. This done, he fished out of his briefcase two petit-beurres he had saved and an even older but still quite palatable small, softish, near-ham sandwich, vaguely associated with the train journey from Nice to Paris last Saturday night: not so much thriftiness on his part (the Shadows had advanced him a handsome sum, anyway), but an animal attachment to the habits of his frugal youth. After breakfasting in bed on these delicacies, he began preparations for the most important day in his life. He had shaved yesterday—that was out of the way. His trusty pajamas he stuffed not into his traveling bag but into the briefcase, dressed, unclipped from the inside of his coat a cameo-pink, interdentally clogged pocket comb, drew it through his bristly hair, carefully donned his trilby, washed both hands with the nice, modern liquid soap in the nice, modern, almost odorless lavatory across the corridor, micturated, rinsed one hand, and feeling clean and neat, went out for a stroll."|"Pale Fire"|"Vladimir Nabokov"
14:00|"2 P.M."|"He had to check in at the airport at 2 P.M. The night before, when making his reservation, he had not been able to get a seat on the earlier flight to New Wye because of some convention there. He had fiddled with railway schedules, but these had evidently been arranged by a practical joker since the only available direct train (dubbed the Square Wheel by our jolted and jerked students) left at 5:13 AM., dawdled at flag stations, and took eleven hours to cover the four hundred miles to Exton; you could try to cheat it by going via Washington but then you had to wait there at least three hours for a sleepy local. Buses were out so far as Gradus was concerned since he always got roadsick in them unless he drugged himself with Fahrmamine pills, and that might affect his aim. Come to think of it, he was not feeling too steady anyway."|"Pale Fire"|"Vladimir Nabokov"
