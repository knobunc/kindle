In precisely sixtyfive minutes Graham will play a best-of-five-games match against Joel Sherman to determine the world Scrabble champion.

He talks rapidly, his mind racing ahead of his thoughts. He refuses to see an orthopedist about a damaged knee that sometimes leaves him hobbling in pain. He doesn’t sleep much, doesn’t eat much, and doesn’t relax much, certainly not on this morning.

After his recent world championship, Joel is on a roll. These last three months have been the most esteem-building of his life, and for all of his frumpy sadness, Joel is reveling in his success. Here’s Joel with the tournament director in Thailand. Here he is with a woman who played a zitherlike instrument at a reception. Here he is at the royal palace.

In relation to chess, Cockburn said, women “are happily without the psychological formations or drives that promote an expertise in the game in the first place. One could even add that women have never been allowed the cultural space to foster that lethargic yet zealous commitment to a useless pursuit that has fostered the bizarre careers of the great champions.” In Scrabble, the answer might be simple. “Probably because they have lives outside of this shit,” one male expert says."|"Word Freak"|"Stefan Fatsis"

Jim Piazza, a New York writer who, on his day job, vets movie scripts for a Hollywood studio, recites a funny advice column, Dear Dr. Jim. Finally, with the clock approaching 1:00 A.M., Sal Piro, the Rocky Horror Picture Show fan club president, asks me to check his makeup, which I do, before he races into the room shouting, “The bitch is back!” Dressed in drag, with an orange wig, Sal introduces the Piro-ettes, three New York players who back him up on fifties songs set to Scrabble lyrics.
