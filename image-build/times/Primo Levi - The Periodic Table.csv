Report in writing, like a police report, only yes and no, because doubts and hesitations were not admissible: it was each time a choice, a deliberation, a mature and responsible undertaking, for which Fascism had not prepared us, and from which emanated a good smell, dry and clean."|"The Periodic Table"|"Primo Levi"

We slept in an inn and left the next day, not too early, at some undetermined hour (Sandro did not like watches: he felt their quiet continuous admonishment to be an arbitrary intrusion).

We got down in two hours, helped badly by the rope, which was frozen; it had become a malignant, rigid tangle that snagged on each projection and rang against the rock face like the cable of a funicular. At seven we were on the bank of a frozen pond and it was dark. We ate the little that was left, built a useless dry stone wall facing the wind, and lay down on the ground to sleep, pressed to each other. It was as though time itself had frozen; every so often we got to our feet to reactivate our circulation, and it was always the same time: the wind never stopped blowing, there was always the same ghost of a moon, always at the same point in the sky, and in front of the moon passed a fantastic cavalcade of tattered clouds, always the same. We had taken off our shoes, as described in Lammer’s books, so dear to Sandro, and we kept our feet in our packs; at the first funereal light, which seemed to seep from the snow and not the sky, we rose with our limbs benumbed and our eyes glittering from lack of sleep, hunger, and the hardness of our bed. And we found our shoes so frozen that they rang like bells, and to get them on we had to hatch them out like brood hens."|"The Periodic Table"|"Primo Levi"

Each time I took the magnet out of the water, it brought with it a tuft of brown powder: I removed it delicately with filter paper and put it aside, perhaps a milligram each time; for the analysis to be well-founded at least a half gram of material was needed, that is, several hours of work. I decided to stop about midnight: to interrupt the separation, I mean to say, because at no cost would I have put off the beginning of the analysis. For this, since it involved a magnetic fraction (and therefore presumably poor in silicates), and yielding to my haste, I there and then tried a simplified variant. At three in the morning I had the result: no longer the usual pink little cloud of nickel-dimethylglyoxime but rather a visibly abundant precipitate. Filtered, washed, dried, and weighed. The final datum appeared to me written in letters of fire on the slide rule: 6 percent of nickel, the rest iron. A victory: even without a further separation, an alloy to be sent to the electric oven as is.

Just a bit lower down were flocks, shepherds, and paths: you could see the bottom of the valley, so deep that it still seemed immersed in the night. I descended, found villages, one rather large village on a stream, where the mountain folk came down to barter livestock, horses, cheese, pelts, and a red liquid they called wine. I almost burst out laughing whenever I heard them speak: their language was a crude and indistinct gurgle, an animal-like gur-gur, so much so that it was surprising to see that they nevertheless actually had weapons and tools like ours, some of them even more ingenious and elaborate. The women spun, as they did back home. They build houses of rock, not so pretty but solid; some houses, though, were made of wood, suspended a few feet above the ground since they rested on four or six wooden blocks topped by disks of smooth stone; I believe these stones served to prevent the invasion of mice, and this seemed to me an intelligent invention.

"ap 11:00"|eleven|"They beat us up a bit, warned us “not to do anything ill-advised,” promised to question us later in a certain very convincing manner of theirs and shoot us immediately afterward, ranged themselves with great pomp around us, and began walking us down toward the mountain pass. During the march, which lasted for several hours, I did two things that were very important to me: I ate bit by bit the much too false identity card I had in my wallet (the photograph was particularly disgusting), and, pretending to stumble, I slipped into the snow the notebook full of addresses I carried in my pocket. The militiamen were singing intrepid war songs, shooting at hares with their tommy guns, and flinging grenades into the streams to kill the trout. Down in the valley several buses were waiting for us. They made us get on and sit separately, and I had militiamen all around, seated and standing, who were not concerned about us and kept on singing. One of them, right in front of me, had his back to me and from his belt hung a hand grenade, one of those German hand grenades with a wooden handle. I could easily have lifted the safety pin, pulled the cord, and done away with myself and several of them, but I didn’t have the courage. They took us to the barracks, which were on the outskirts of Aosta. Their centurion was called Fossa, and it is strange, absurd, and sinisterly comic, given the situation at that time, that he lies now for decades in some out-of-the-way war cemetery and I am here, alive and substantially unharmed, writing this story. Fossa was a stickler for legality and set about rapidly organizing in our favor a prison regime which was in conformity with regulations. So he put us in the barracks’ basement, one man per cell, with a cot and a pail, rations at eleven, an hour of open-air exercise, and the prohibition of talking to each other. This prohibition was painful because among us, in each of our minds, weighed an ugly secret: the same secret that had exposed us to capture, extinguishing in us, a few days before, all will to resist, indeed to live. We had been forced by our consciences to carry out a sentence and had carried it out, but we had come out of it destroyed, destitute, waiting for everything to finish and to be finished ourselves; but also wanting to see each other, to talk, to help each other exorcize that so recent memory. Now we were finished, and we knew it: we were in the trap, each one in his own trap, and there was no way out except down. It did not take me long to be convinced of it, examining my cell inch by inch, since the novels on which for years I had fed were full of miraculous escapes; but here the walls were half a yard thick, the door was massive and guarded on the outside, the small window was furnished with iron bars. I had a nail file, I could have sawn through one bar, perhaps even all of them; I was so thin that perhaps I could have squeezed through: but up against the window I discovered a large cement block to protect against bomb fragments during the air raids."|"The Periodic Table"|"Primo Levi"

It was nothing new by now, but each time this happened we felt—we and everyone—struck by anguish to the marrow of our bones. It did not seem an earthly sound, it was not a siren like those in the factories, it was a sound of enormous volume which, simultaneously and in cadence throughout the entire zone, rose to a spasmodic, acute note and redescended to a thunderous grumble. It could not have been a chance invention, since nothing in Germany took place by chance, and in any case it was too much in conformity with the goal and background: I have often thought that it had been elaborated by some malevolent musician, who locked in it fury and weeping, the wolf’s howling at the moon and the breath of a typhoon: Astolfo’s horn must have sounded like that. It provoked panic, not only because it announced the bombs to come but also because of its intrinsic horror, almost the lament of a wounded beast as all-encompassing as the horizon."|"The Periodic Table"|"Primo Levi"

He took a sample from the boiler, let it cool, and tested it with the reagent: the test tube remained clear for a few seconds and then became white as milk. Lanza turned off the fire, stopped the mixer and the fan, and opened the vacuum breaker: he heard a long, angry hiss, which gradually calmed down into a rustle, a murmur, and then fell silent.

At times we had studied together: he was serious and had no indulgence for himself, he studied without inspiration and without joy (he did not seem to know joy), successively boring through the chapters of the texts like a miner in a tunnel. He had not been compromised by Fascism, and he had reacted well to the reagent of the racial laws. He had been an opaque but reliable boy in whom one could trust: and experience teaches us that just this, trust-worthiness, is the most constant virtue, which is not acquired or lost with the years. One is born worthy of trust, with an open face and steady eyes, and remains such for life. He who is born contorted and lax remains that way: he who lies to you at six, lies to you at sixteen and sixty. The phenomenon is striking and explains how certain friendships and marriages survive for several decades, despite habit, boredom, and the wearing out of subjects of discussion: I was interested in verifying this through Cerrato.

They refused to tell me what it contained, but you know very well, organic tans are polyphenols and there is no ion exchange resin that can trap them, and what a polyphenol can do to silver bromide even you who are not in the field can imagine. I got a sample of the tanning solution, went to the experimental lab, and atomized a 1:10,000 solution in the darkroom in which was exposed a specimen of X-ray paper. The effect could be seen a few days later: the paper’s sensitivity had disappeared, literally. The head of the lab did not believe his eyes. He told me that he had never seen so powerful an inhibitor. We tested it with increasingly diluted solutions, as homeopathic doctors do: with solutions of about one part to a million; we obtained bean-shaped spots, which, however, appeared only after two months of rest. The bean effect—Bohneffekt—had been reproduced in full: when all was said and done, it became obvious that a few thousand molecules of polyphenol absorbed by the fibers of the overalls during the wash and carried by an invisible piece of lint from the overall to the paper were enough to produce the spots.”"|"The Periodic Table"|"Primo Levi"
