"< 00:00"|"nearly midnight"|"It was nearly midnight, and he was lying on his stomach in bed, the blankets drawn right over his head like a tent, a flashlight in one hand and a large leather-bound book (A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot) propped open against the pillow. Harry moved the tip of his eagle-feather quill down the page, frowning as he looked for something that would help him write his essay, “Witch Burning in the Fourteenth Century Was Completely Pointless — discuss.”"|"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"|"J. K. Rowling"
01:00|"one o’clock in the morning"|"It was one o’clock in the morning. Harry’s stomach gave a funny jolt. He had been thirteen years old, without realizing it, for a whole hour."|"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"Please note that the new school year will begin on September the first. The Hogwarts Express will leave from King’s Cross station, platform nine and three-quarters, at eleven o’clock."|"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"|"J. K. Rowling"

"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"At Dudley’s fifth birthday party, Aunt Marge had whacked Harry around the shins with her walking stick to stop him from beating Dudley at musical statues. A few years later, she had turned up at Christmas with a computerized robot for Dudley and a box of dog biscuits for Harry. On her last visit, the year before Harry started at Hogwarts, Harry had accidentally trodden on the tail of her favorite dog. Ripper had chased Harry out into the garden and up a tree, and Aunt Marge had refused to call him off until past midnight. The memory of this incident still brought tears of laughter to Dudley’s eyes."|"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"|"J. K. Rowling"

And” — Ron leaned closer to the schedule, disbelieving — “look — underneath that, Arithmancy, nine o’clock. I mean, I know you’re good, Hermione, but no one’s that good. How’re you supposed to be in three classes at once?”"|"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"|"J. K. Rowling"
"~ 03:00"|"Around three in the morning"|"Once every hour, a teacher would reappear in the hall to check that everything was quiet. Around three in the morning, when many students had finally fallen asleep, Professor Dumbledore came in. Harry watched him looking around for Percy, who had been prowling between the sleeping bags, telling people off for talking. Percy was only a short way away from Harry, Ron, and Hermione, who quickly pretended to be asleep as Dumbledore’s footsteps drew nearer."|"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"|"J. K. Rowling"

"ap 04:30"|"half past four"|"Harry fumbled for his alarm clock and looked at it. It was half past four. Cursing Peeves, he rolled over and tried to get back to sleep, but it was very difficult, now that he was awake, to ignore the sounds of the thunder rumbling overhead, the pounding of the wind against the castle walls, and the distant creaking of the trees in the Forbidden Forest. In a few hours he would be out on the Quidditch field, battling through that gale. Finally, he gave up any thought of more sleep, got up, dressed, picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand, and walked quietly out of the dormitory."|"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap ~ 08:00"|"about eight o’clock"|"“Ah yes,” said Lupin, when Harry reminded him of his promise at the end of class. “Let me see … how about eight o’clock on Thursday evening? The History of Magic classroom should be large enough. … I’ll have to think carefully about how we’re going to do this. … We can’t bring a real dementor into the castle to practice on. …”"|"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"At eight o’clock on Thursday evening, Harry left Gryffindor Tower for the History of Magic classroom. It was dark and empty when he arrived, but he lit the lamps with his wand and had waited only five minutes when Professor Lupin turned up, carrying a large packing case, which he heaved onto Professor Binns’ desk."|"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 10:45"|"quarter to eleven"|"At a quarter to eleven, the Gryffindor team set off for the locker rooms. The weather couldn’t have been more different from their match against Hufflepuff. It was a clear, cool day with a very light breeze; there would be no visibility problems this time, and Harry, though nervous, was starting to feel the excitement only a Quidditch match could bring. They could hear the rest of the school moving into the stadium beyond. Harry took off his black school robes, removed his wand from his pocket, and stuck it inside the T-shirt he was going to wear under his Quidditch robes. He only hoped he wouldn’t need it. He wondered suddenly whether Professor Lupin was in the crowd, watching."|"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"|"J. K. Rowling"
01:00|"one in the morning"|"The Gryffindor party ended only when Professor McGonagall turned up in her tartan dressing gown and hair net at one in the morning, to insist that they all go to bed. Harry and Ron climbed the stairs to their dormitory, still discussing the match. At last, exhausted, Harry climbed into bed, twitched the hangings of his four-poster shut to block out a ray of moonlight, lay back, and felt himself almost instantly drifting off to sleep. …"|"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"|"J. K. Rowling"

Wednesday afternoon meant Herbology, in the greenhouses under a baking-hot sun; then back to the common room once more, with sunburnt necks, thinking longingly of this time next day, when it would all be over."|"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"|"J.

"ap 02:00"|"Two o’clock"|"Before Fudge could answer, two wizards came through the castle doors behind him. One was so ancient he appeared to be withering before their very eyes; the other was tall and strapping, with a thin black mustache. Harry gathered that they were representatives of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures, because the very old wizard squinted toward Hagrid’s cabin and said in a feeble voice, “Dear, dear, I’m getting too old for this. … Two o’clock, isn’t it, Fudge?”"|"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"|"J.

12:00|noon|"When Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the hospital wing at noon the next day, it was to find an almost deserted castle. The sweltering heat and the end of the exams meant that everyone was taking full advantage of another Hogsmeade visit. Neither Ron nor Hermione felt like going, however, so they and Harry wandered onto the grounds, still talking about the extraordinary events of the previous night and wondering where Sirius and Buckbeak were now. Sitting near the lake, watching the giant squid waving its tentacles lazily above the water, Harry lost the thread of the conversation as he looked across to the opposite bank. The stag had galloped toward him from there just last night. …"|"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"|"J. K. Rowling"

Was it — was she making a real prediction?"|"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"|"J. K. Rowling"
