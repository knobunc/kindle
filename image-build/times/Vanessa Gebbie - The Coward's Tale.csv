"ap 02:10"|"ten past two"|"The boy does not see any of this. He sits on the kerb, peers at his knees and dabs at them with the thing that might be a handkerchief, then he takes off his glasses to wipe his face, leaving behind streaks of blood and pavement. Ianto Jenkins, still looking at the boy, shakes his head as if to clear it. He coughs and points to his own nose; the boy half-smiles and rubs at his nose with his sleeve. Mrs Harris and Mrs Price tut, and the boy winces as he pushes the old man’s handkerchief into his pocket. ‘Sorry. Thank you. I’ll get my gran to wash it,’ then he stands up and cleans his glasses on the hem of his raincoat. He pulls up his socks, and when he straightens they fall back to his ankles as if they are more comfortable down there. He sighs and shrugs and looks at the clock that says ten past two on the pediment of the Town Hall, next to the library."|"The Coward's Tale"|"Vanessa Gebbie"
"ap 02:10"|"ten past two"|"Mrs Eunice Harris pulls back the sleeve of her good coat and checks her good watch. ‘Indeed yes. Half twelve,’ and waves a hand at the Town Hall clock as if it was hers. ‘Always ten past two. Someone put a nail in the time years back.’"|"The Coward's Tale"|"Vanessa Gebbie"
"ap 08:45"|"quarter to nine"|"With the exception of that special September day, every Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday morning, at a quarter to nine, Baker Bowen will come through his house to the front shop, wiping his mouth of crumbs as he slides the sign to
Open
and unbolts the door to let in the air that rises from the stream. Maybe he will turn and call back into the house, his breath making a brief cloud as he speaks, ‘It is a fine day, my love, but cold.’"|"The Coward's Tale"|"Vanessa Gebbie"
"ap 08:55"|"five minutes to nine"|"Baker Bowen may not reply to this last, but he will go back to his front door to watch for his first customer. He will not have to wait long. They come without fail at five minutes to nine, dropped by the bus as it passes at the top of the street, although there is no regular stop up there. The passengers just ask for Baker Bowen’s and they sigh as they alight, holding on to the rail as they make their way down the steepest street in the town, complaining as they come, ‘Morning, Mr Bowen. There’s painful they are today, terrible. I must have done something dreadful to deserve these feet.’ The ladies will always say something like that, and the men will do nothing but scowl."|"The Coward's Tale"|"Vanessa Gebbie"
"< 12:00"|"near midday"|"But then there was one September day when Will Bowen came freewheeling down the hill towards Plymouth Street, near midday, whistling as loud as he could, for Benjie would still be at work – and he did not hear a new sound carried on the wind from down the valley. From the direction of Kindly Light pit."|"The Coward's Tale"|"Vanessa Gebbie"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"And later in the day, when Matty Harris finishes at the Savings Bank he will leave his Clerk Tommo Price to lock up for the night. He will not go the back way up the hill for a pint at The Cat at the corner of Maerdy Street, not yet, but instead he will cross the square to the cinema, where he may find the beggar Ianto Passchendaele Jenkins leaning against the wall as the queue builds up for the six o’clock showing. Matty joins the back of the queue with no intention of seeing the film, and when he can, he puts a coin in the beggar’s cap. ‘Why does Tutt Bevan make his old noises? And why is he following that stick everywhere of a sudden? And what is wrong with Factual Philips? Why doesn’t he like kids playing? Enjoys fishing, and isn’t that playing, of sorts? . . .’"|"The Coward's Tale"|"Vanessa Gebbie"
"> 12:00"|"past noon"|"And then a ride in a Welsh Hills lorry from the Rhondda to a place on the border of two countries. A side road where the Welsh Hills driver stopped for his sandwiches near a field where on the maps, the border runs through, dividing grass from the same seed, in the same small patch of mud, into two nations. Seen here, he was, later, by the side of the road, just standing by a gate. Looking at his watch, someone said, and thought he was waiting for a lift. But he must have waited until it was past noon, someone said, for the sun to drop in front. Kept watching the sky, looking at the light, and keeping his shadow behind him. That was the first day."|"The Coward's Tale"|"Vanessa Gebbie"
12:00|midday|"On the fifth day, he must have gone right through a great estate, where there is a house bigger than this chapel, this cinema, this Savings Bank, all built together, the land greater than half this town itself. Must have walked right through the woodland where they breed birds to be shot. And maybe there was no need for him to wait for his shadow to fall behind him at midday, for there are no shadows like that beneath the trees."|"The Coward's Tale"|"Vanessa Gebbie"
12:00|"twelve noon"|"So now the double doors of the Public Library have been locked, and the staff sent home. It is only twelve noon, and if Mrs Bennie Parrish comes to change her books she will go home sucking her teeth and muttering about impropriety."|"The Coward's Tale"|"Vanessa Gebbie"
05:00|"five in the morning"|"‘It was before five in the morning that first day, and I was up and dressed, those boots on my feet, standing there in the bedroom with the Maggot lying in the bed, half-awake, “Bring me something back, Ianto?” and I said something like, “Bring you something back? What do you expect there is down there? Diamonds?” and he shifted over to my place in the bed nearest the wall, and he curled up in the warm spot, and pulled the covers round his ears."|"The Coward's Tale"|"Vanessa Gebbie"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"But the storyteller is off now, back begging he is, as the two o’clock is coming out all smiles and toffees. But he is not finished, and will not be until he tells the other half of the story, about Tommo Price, who never believed what his friend told him."|"The Coward's Tale"|"Vanessa Gebbie"
12:00|midday|"Tommo Price can see Ianto Jenkins from his window at the Savings Bank like God above who can do nothing once he’s let his creation loose. He watches when people come out of the midday showing and stand with the beggar for aeons with him wheeling his arms and tapping his watch, and Tommo turns away and goes back to his ledgers. He drinks his tea from a thick cup and he fixes his eyes on his ledgers where the numbers stay still and solid and if he concentrates hard he only half-hears his name,"|"The Coward's Tale"|"Vanessa Gebbie"
"ap > 07:00"|"past seven"|"Tonight the wind is blowing from the east and Tommo thinks to go straight to the tunnel where Annie will be as sure as eggs with her net. And she is not. It is past seven and the light is fading, and the tunnel is hoooooing soft and in waves."|"The Coward's Tale"|"Vanessa Gebbie"
01:30|"Half past one in the morning"|"James Little will finish checking his winter cabbages are well, his carrots are fine in their earth and his parsnips can breathe. He stands, stretching his aching shoulders, lifts the lamp and looks at his watch. Half past one in the morning. ‘Almost time.’"|"The Coward's Tale"|"Vanessa Gebbie"
05:00|"five in the morning"|"And the milkman, who has his own allotment against the old wall, may join in here, ‘Oh yes, I see him now and again, going home in his wellingtons, five in the morning . . . strange, that . . .’"|"The Coward's Tale"|"Vanessa Gebbie"
00:00|midnight|"Factual Philips, Deputy Librarian Detective, writes notes about seeing James Little night after night leaving his house at midnight in his wellingtons, buttoning his gardening coat. They will all be clues, no doubt about that. Seeing him walk under the streetlights along Christopher Terrace to Adam’s Acre and cross the road, disappearing into the darkness of the allotments. Seeing a small light then, the oil lamp moving about, and around the light the small mysterious shadow of James Little."|"The Coward's Tale"|"Vanessa Gebbie"
01:30|"half past one in the morning"|"And, then, at half past one in the morning, sharp, the lamp wavers along the rows and disappears."|"The Coward's Tale"|"Vanessa Gebbie"
"ap 02:30"|two-thirty|"In his chapel porch, the beggar Ianto Passchendaele Jenkins is waiting for someone to bring him a nice warm coffee, with two sugars. Or for Mrs Prinny Ellis to find him a sandwich with beetroot from her greaseproof packet. Mrs Ellis came down with her basket a while since, opened the ticket office of the cinema, and is knitting a red jersey while she waits to sell tickets for the two-thirty showing."|"The Coward's Tale"|"Vanessa Gebbie"
