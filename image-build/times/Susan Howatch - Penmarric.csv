Since strangers of quality were almost unknown in Zillan he quickly became a subject of interest among the villagers as soon as he began to attend matins at Zillan church every Sunday. He was, I was told, the owner of the large farm at Morvah where old Ned Sparnon had lived until his death recently; Mr. Castallack had inherited the farm from his mother, who had been a Waymark of Zennor. More than twenty years before he had married into the notorious Penmar family, but he and his wife, so gossip whispered, were divorced."|Penmarric|"Susan Howatch"

Instead I sat in my sitting room and stared in despair once again at my accounts. I had barely enough money to last me to the new year. And after the new year … Tears pricked my eyes again as I looked at the list I had made of Laurence’s loans to me. Some of the sums he had insisted I should regard as gifts, but the others I had been determined to repay one day somehow. Now they would never be repaid. I would have to sell the farmhouse to Jared and everything would be lost."|Penmarric|"Susan Howatch"

Their daughter Miriam, who had disgraced herself the previous year by running off with young Harry Penmar, was like myself in “a delicate condition”—or so that tiresome woman Mrs. Barnwell confided to me cozily over tea one afternoon. Harry Penmar had married Miriam, so she was at least an honest woman, but he was up to his ears in debt as usual and I had a suspicion that Miriam might have begun to regret her impulsive elopement."|Penmarric|"Susan Howatch"

I would not allow her to be called Janna, so we called her instead by my true name, Jeanne, and she was christened directly after Christmas. Three days later the old year was gone, and although the Astronomer Royal said that the end of the nineteenth century should officially be recognized as the thirty-first of December 1900, we took little notice of this in distant Cornwall and welcomed the new century at the end of 1899. The twentieth century! I remember we were all very gay, a little overawed by the prospect of entering a new era, but excited too as if the best was yet to come and the promised land lay ahead for every one of us. We celebrated New Year’s Eve that year in the most splendid manner imaginable and never once guessed as we heard the church bells chime across the moors at midnight that they were ringing the death bell for big houses like Penmarric and for a way of life that supported us all."|Penmarric|"Susan Howatch"

But I was not presented. Mark was away at Oxford at the time and although he wrote and urged me to accept the invitation to the Mount and go there in the company of the Carnforths, my courage failed me and I was unable to face the ordeal of a social occasion of such magnitude without my husband at my side. Besides, the Carnforths did not ask me to accompany them, and I was not so ill-mannered to press for such an invitation when they had obviously decided I would be better off at home. Nanny and I took the children to the station to wave at the royal party as they arrived in Penzance, but after that we returned to Penmarric and I did not see the King again."|Penmarric|"Susan Howatch"

But I was more worried about Philip’s presence than his mother’s, for I felt sure he would at once think I was trying to cause trouble if he saw me in Zillan church, and I did not want any violent scene with Philip. Finally I decided to attend evensong instead of matins, and this worked out very well. Before the end of the Christmas holidays I went twice to the evensong service at Zillan, and each time the rector invited me to have supper afterward at the rectory.

When I glanced around again I saw his mother beside him. She wore black and looked almost young from a distance. I did not dare stare at her too long for fear our glances would meet, so I spent the rest of the service looking steadfastly ahead of me toward the altar."|Penmarric|"Susan Howatch"

"ap 02:40"|two-forty|"Above the ground it was raining and a clammy mist was blowing in from the sea, but down at the two-forty level it was as hot as hell and we were all naked to the waist. The dust from the previous explosions had settled and we were back drilling holes for the next fuses again. Our mechanical drill had developed a fault, and so we were relying once more on the traditional method of beating an upper with a seven-pound hammer. Trevose, like any other miner worth his salt, was ambidextrous in this skill, but I found it hard enough with my right hand to wield a heavy hammer for minute after minute in a hot underground hole far below the sea. In most of the mines around St. Just a miner wields a hammer and turns the drill rods single-handed, but this takes practice and I was inexperienced, so I turned Trevose’s borer while Trevose himself focused his attention on wielding the hammer. Even though I was comparatively inactive sweat was pouring off my body and dust was pricking my nose and making me uncomfortable. But at last when the holes were deep enough Trevose called for dynamite. The charges were packed, the fuses left dangling; having made sure that all was in order, we packed our belongings together and retreated from the stopes while Trevose was left behind to fire the charges. That day there were six of us in our “pare,” or working party. Trevose and I and four “hard-rock” men, two of whom had come from Botallack, which had closed at last a few months ago; the other two were Zillan men who had been subsisting on part-time employment at South Crofty after the unsuccessful attempt to reopen Ding Dong mine in 1912."|Penmarric|"Susan Howatch"
19:15|1915|"It was 1915. By this time everyone was realizing that this was an entirely new kind of war in which there was no limit to the catastrophes that could happen, no precedent for the total involvement of civilians as well as soldiers, and no end seemingly in sight. The casualties already staggered the imagination. In May of that year Asquith had reconstructed his Government in an attempt to reorganize matters at home to cope with the hideous crises abroad, and now there was a new ministry, a ministry of munitions headed by Lloyd George, and the talk was all of manufacturing munitions quickly enough to keep pace with the need of the army in France. But soon concern for supplies at home began to rival concern for supplies abroad. The Zeppelin raids had been too sporadic to have widespread effect, but the German blockade of the British Isles meant that food became scarcer and poorer in quality. Even in Cornwall we noticed the difference and I felt glad we lived on a farm and were not entirely dependent on the shops for our supplies."|Penmarric|"Susan Howatch"

But 1919 turned out to be quite a year.

Once you’d got your filthy hands on her money you never had a moment’s time for her! I know! She told me! You only married her so that you could set yourself up in a big house with a lot of land and try and make yourself out to be a landowning gentleman. You—a gentleman! My God!

"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"The wedding was set for two o’clock at Zillan. When Jan-Yves and I were ready the chauffeur Tredinney drove us there in the Penmarric car, and since we were early I prepared to idle away a few minutes in the front pew. But I wasn’t allowed to idle for long. The rector appeared for a word with me; Peter Waymark, who was an usher, arrived with his wife. Other guests began to appear, and, glancing over my shoulder, I saw Mariana and Lizzie with the Carnforths; they were both staying at Carnforth Hall with Sir Justin and Alice, who were just home from their honeymoon, Mariana’s husband, now a chronic invalid, had once again been left behind in Scotland. Rebecca came with my nephew Jonas, a tough two-year-old with Hugh’s eyes and Rebecca’s wide sullen mouth; Jonas’s sister Deborah, who was the youngest bridesmaid, was by that time at Polzillan House with Esmond, the page, and the two adult bridesmaids, Jeanne and a friend of Helena’s from Warwickshire called Charlotte. After Rebecca’s arrival I saw Helena’s other friends from Warwickshire enter the church; I had met them the week before while they had been staying at Polzillan House and now recognized each one in turn. The St. Enedocs came from St. Ives, the Trehearnes from Helston, the Kehellands from Lelant, the Tregothas from St. Erth; I lost count of the county faces I knew so well. The Penmarric and Polzillan servants, stiffly dressed in their Sunday best, tiptoed into the back pews, and at the far end of the church beneath the bell tower sat a few of the miners from Sennen Garth, the ones who had been successful in the lottery held to decide who should have the limited number of temporary seats available. Trevose by his own choice was not among them."|Penmarric|"Susan Howatch"

We had a hard time escaping from Polzillan, however. Everyone had to crowd out into the drive to see us off; everyone had to wish us goodbye.

What would everyone say? What would they think? I clasped my hands together closed my eyes and tried to arrange my thoughts in a logical formation. The most important thing, as I saw it, was that no one should know. Nothing was more important than that. The thought of anyone knowing the truth was enough to make me sweat. No one must know. Helena knew but she wouldn’t say anything. She was too proud to tell anyone what had happened, or failed to happen, between us. Everyone else would assume that we’d spent a normal honeymoon. For a moment I wondered if matters would be different at Torquay, but I didn’t allow myself to hope that they would be. I was incapable then of foreseeing far into the future, but I knew that as matters stood at that hour I was incapable of making love to any woman, let alone my wife.

Poor Deborah was even shyer than her mother and painfully self-conscious as well; she could answer questions only in blushing monosyllables.

Penmarric means nothing to Jonas and everything to you. You’ve made a great many foolish mistakes and nearly ruined your chances, but all isn’t yet lost. If you’re clever and sensible Penmarric can still be yours one day if you outlive Philip.” She stood up and moved slowly over to the door. “Philip brought me here this morning to persuade you to join us for lunch at the Metropole,” she said over her shoulder. “He’s at Michael’s office now, but I’ve arranged to meet him at the Metropole at one o’clock, so I suggest you drive us there in your car.” She glanced at my disheveled appearance and added, “I’ll wait in the drawing room while you change—and don’t forget to shave!

During the day I worked with Walter Hubert on estate matters; everything I did had to be approved by him and I had no control over any money. Philip paid me an overgenerous wage through his bankers, and occasionally I bumped into him by chance, but since he could not be bothered to talk to me for more than five minutes at a time our relationship was hardly a close one. In the evenings I went to the pub or spent my time trying to find a new mistress, but my bank balance, burdened by the task of repaying the moneylenders, was too poor and my position at Penmarric too servile to allow me to approach a woman of my own class and I was finding the effort of having casual nights with any other type of woman too depressing to sustain for long. I saw Felicity occasionally and had a drink with William once a week, but otherwise I met few people. I was too ashamed of my loss of face to keep in touch with the friends who had flocked around me when I had lived as master of Penmarric, and the only person I saw often was my mother; every Wednesday I would dine at the farm, every Saturday I would escort her to Penzance for lunch and every Sunday I went with her to Zillan church for matins."|Penmarric|"Susan Howatch"

19:42|1942|"I was at Tobruk at the time. It was 1942, and Wavell had been replaced by Auchinleck before Rommel had driven us out of Cyrenaica at the end of January. Our retreat, coming so soon after the catastrophic news of Singapore, had depressed me and the chance of a visit home, no matter how brief, at first seemed too miraculous ever to come to pass. But my request for compassionate leave was granted. Auchinleck was busy telling Churchill that his Army was in no fit state to go on the offensive when Malta was out of action and supplies were pouring into Rommel, and matters for the moment were at a standstill."|Penmarric|"Susan Howatch"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"“And then,” said my mother, “he told you to go to the devil and walked out of the house. We stayed here a long time discussing the incident but at last you left to return to Penmarric. You left here at eleven o’clock. At nine o’clock—that’s now—you telephoned your wife and told her that Jonas had just left but that I was upset and it might be a little while before you arrived home since you felt obligated to stay with me until I was better.”"|Penmarric|"Susan Howatch"

Darling, I’m sorry but we’ve had rather a scene with Jonas—he’s gone now but my mother’s upset, so I doubt if I’ll be home for at least another hour… Don’t wait up for me, will you… Sorry, darling …”"|Penmarric|"Susan Howatch"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"We met by chance. I had no good reason for being in Zillan churchyard at two o’clock on that hot July afternoon in 1890; I had no good reason even for being in Zillan. I was a stranger in that part of Cornwall, for I had been born and bred near the Helford River, and the gentle mildness of South Cornwall with its trees and estuaries and rolling hills is a world away from the stark mining coast of the North with its windswept moors, precipitous cliffs and treacherous surf."|Penmarric|"Susan Howatch"
12:00|midday|"I went on looking at her. She was wearing a voluminous purple gown that was fastened at the throat with a diamond clasp, and presently that clasp was all I could see. I can remember it still. I can close my eyes and see all those diamonds, shoulder to shoulder, a row of jagged predatory teeth that glittered brilliantly in the hard midday light."|Penmarric|"Susan Howatch"
"> 03:00"|"after matins"|"When I told him who I was he seemed startled and then explained that he knew my father well; they had been at school together long ago, and my father had been attending church at Zillan since he had taken up residence at Deveral Farm. I learned too that my father lunched regularly at the rectory with Mr. Barnwell and his family after matins every Sunday before returning over the moors in the ponytrap to his solitary existence at Morvah."|Penmarric|"Susan Howatch"
02:30|matins|"“Well, by sight, I suppose,” he said doubtfully. “Having attended matins there every week, their faces have become familiar. But there’s no one of my own class there save Barnwell himself. The only substantial landowner in Zillan parish, an old bachelor named Meredith, is too crippled with arthritis to leave his home to attend matins, so I’ve yet to meet him.”"|Penmarric|"Susan Howatch"
