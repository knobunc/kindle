00:00|midnight|"Barbee looked for April Bell and glimpsed her entering the terminal building. She had slipped away, he supposed, to telephone her story to a rewrite man on the Call. But Barbee's own deadline was midnight, for the early edition of the Star. He still had time to try to solve the riddle he felt in Mondrick's death."|"Darker Than You Think"|"Jack Williamson"
00:00|midnight|"""'For the whole truth, read the Star.'"" Barbee quoted his paper's slogan, grinning. ""I still have till midnight to find out what they brought back in that green box, and why old Mondrick died when he did."" His grin sobered, and something made him gulp. ""Shall I—may I see you again?"""|"Darker Than You Think"|"Jack Williamson"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"Dark again, her long greenish eyes stared at the three weary men, carefully loading the heavy wooden chest into Dr. Bennett's car. The little group of relatives stood back to watch, puzzled and distressed. Barbee touched April Bell's white fur, and shivered in the icy wind.
""At nine?"" he said huskily. ""Where shall I meet you?""
April Bell smiled abruptly, with a quizzical lift of her penciled brows."|"Darker Than You Think"|"Jack Williamson"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"He opened the door and she stepped in quickly, as graceful in her white fur as the tiny jade carving in his pocket. She took his hand for an instant, and the touch of her strong cool fingers was exciting as her voice. He put down the impulse to kiss her, afraid that would spoil everything. His breath hastened. Murderess or not, April Bell was going to be a fascinating girl to know.
""Bye, Barbee,"" she whispered. ""Till nine.""
Barbee drove back to town in his prewar coupe, and stopped at his desk in the long city room to hammer out his stories for the Star. Writing, he was glad of the terse, stereotyped objectivity of modern journalese."|"Darker Than You Think"|"Jack Williamson"
"ap 08:40"|"eight forty"|"He bathed and shaved, and discovered himself whistling happily as he looked for a clean shirt and a suit that wouldn't be too shabby for the Knob Hill. April Bell might be what he needed. He had closed the door behind him at eight forty when he heard the telephone ring inside. He hurried back to answer it, shaken with a sudden apprehension that she had decided not to see him."|"Darker Than You Think"|"Jack Williamson"
"ap 02:00"|two|"Barbee covered Mondrick's funeral for the Star. The simple services were held at two, next day. Although the wind had shifted toward the south, the day was blustering and raw, and only the blind widow and a few close friends from the university and the Foundation braved it to watch the graveside ceremony."|"Darker Than You Think"|"Jack Williamson"
"ap 04:00"|four|"Barbee caught his breath, staring uncertainly at the stern purpose which had almost erased even the grief from her thin white face, turning its sad, patient sweetness into something almost terrible. He recalled her telephoned warning against April Bell, and wondered again what Mondrick's death had done to her mind.
""At four,"" he promised. ""I'll come, Rowena.""
At five minutes of four, he parked in front of the rambling old red-brick house on University Avenue. It looked rundown and shabby—the Foundation had taken most of Mondrick's own fortune, besides the sums he raised from others. The shutters needed repair and naked spots showed through the unraked lawns. He rang the doorbell and Rowena herself came to let him in."|"Darker Than You Think"|"Jack Williamson"

12:00|noon|"""Sorry, Mr. Barbee,"" he murmured politely, ""but we really can't disturb her. Sorry, old man—but Miss Bell always sleeps till noon, and she has left strict orders not to be bothered for anything less than fire or bloody murder."""|"Darker Than You Think"|"Jack Williamson"
14:00|"two in the afternoon"|"""See."" The old man showed him a copy of yesterday's Star. Not a word of his story had been printed. On an inside page, he found the bare announcement of Mondrick's funeral at two in the afternoon."|"Darker Than You Think"|"Jack Williamson"
08:00|"eight this morning"|"""One moment, sir."" Her slender ivory fingers riffled gracefully through the black book. ""Mrs. Rowena Mondrick was admitted at eight this morning, and she's under—"" The girl's limpid voice quivered melodiously, intoning the name of a minor deity. ""She's under Dr. Glenn."""|"Darker Than You Think"|"Jack Williamson"
"< 12:00"|"almost noon"|"It was fortunate, he thought, that Miss Ulford couldn't know what he was thinking. He left her at the shabby old house on University Avenue and drove back to town. It was almost noon, and he waited at his desk, fumbling impatiently with the Walraven clippings, for the time to call the Trojan Arms again."|"Darker Than You Think"|"Jack Williamson"
"ap < 02:00"|"almost two o'clock"|"For it was almost two o'clock. She should have been gone from her apartment hours ago, he knew—if she were actually a reporter on the Call. He hurried down to his car, went back to his own apartment to get the white jade pin, and drove too fast out North Main Street to the Trojan Arms."|"Darker Than You Think"|"Jack Williamson"
"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"Somehow, he was afraid to go to sleep. It was long past midnight, and he was reeling with whisky and fatigue, when he tiptoed down the creaking hall and let himself into his little apartment in the gloomy old house on Bread Street."|"Darker Than You Think"|"Jack Williamson"
"ap 02:15"|two-fifteen|"Dazedly he snapped on the light and looked at his watch. It was two-fifteen. He reached for the clothing he had left on a chair, but the night nurse must have removed it; he found only the red robe and soft slippers. Trembling, clammy with sweat, he pulled them on. He pressed the call button, and shuffled out impatiently to meet the nurse in the hall—Miss Hellar had a gorgeous fluff of pale bleached hair and the physique of a lady wrestler."|"Darker Than You Think"|"Jack Williamson"
"ap 04:40"|"four forty"|"He waited for her answer, and it didn't come. He was alone in the dark room, awake and unchanged. He could hear the racing tick of his watch, and see the luminous dial—the time was four forty. The dawn was still two hours away, but he wasn't going to sleep until he saw the sun. He didn't dare— ""No, Barbee."" That tiny whisper turned him almost ill with shock. ""The Child of Night isn't Mr. Troy, but you must prove your right to know his name. You can do that tonight—by killing Rowena Mondrick!"""|"Darker Than You Think"|"Jack Williamson"
"~ 00:00"|"about midnight"|"""The dogs started howling—that must have been about midnight—and poor Mrs. Mondrick started screaming. She wouldn't stop. Dr. Glenn had ordered a hypo if she needed it, and I decided she did. I went to get it ready. When I came back with it, just a minute later, she was gone."""|"Darker Than You Think"|"Jack Williamson"
12:00|noon|"""We've got to find him first."" Barbee lifted his quivering cup, trying to think. ""But—I think I can,"" he whispered slowly. ""I think I can find him—because he knows every officer in four states will be looking for that station wagon by noon. I think I know where Sam would go."""|"Darker Than You Think"|"Jack Williamson"
12:00|Noon|"Noon had passed before he reached Bear Canyon. The morning had turned warm, but heavy clouds had hidden the sun again and a rising south wind promised rain. He drove harder, fearful of a downpour that would turn these neglected ruts into a river."|"Darker Than You Think"|"Jack Williamson"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o'clock"|"He had to turn on the lights before he came back to the highway, but nothing whispered from the dark. No sleek she-wolf sprang into the road ahead, and no police siren wailed behind him. It was eight o'clock when he parked the car on the drive beside Troy's long mansion at Trojan Hills."|"Darker Than You Think"|"Jack Williamson"
