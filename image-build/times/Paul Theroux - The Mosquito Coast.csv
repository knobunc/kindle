They kissed, they held hands, and less than two weeks later, struggling to breathe, Ellis hugging the old man’s limp body, his father died. It was three in the morning; his mother had gone home to sleep."|"The Mosquito Coast"|"Paul Theroux"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"He went home, and when she woke at seven he told his mother, who wailed. He could not stop weeping. An old friend, Roy Junkins, hearing that he was home from Africa, called the next day. Ellis sobbed as he spoke to him, unable to control himself, but finding no more shame in his tears than if he had been bleeding. And something about that moment—the phone call, the tears—made a greater bond between the two men."|"The Mosquito Coast"|"Paul Theroux"

Every day except Sunday he drove to the store at eight, parked behind it, facing the Mystic River, checked the inventory and deliveries with Les Armstrong and Mike Corbett, and opened at nine. At noon, a sandwich at Savage’s, the deli across Riverside Avenue; after lunch, the store. Sometimes Les or Mike reminisced about their years in the army, in dreamy voices, but they were always talking about war. Ellis knew how they felt, but didn’t mention Africa except to his friend Roy, who sometimes dropped in. At five-thirty, when Les and the others left, he locked the front door and went home to dinner."|"The Mosquito Coast"|"Paul Theroux"

"ap 05:30"|five-thirty|"But the building—the real estate—was his equity. Ellis saw a time, not far off, when he would sell the premises and live in retirement on the proceeds. In the meantime, he kept to his hours, eight to five-thirty. He waited on customers himself, as he had always done, to set an example, simply to talk, to listen, to hear about other people’s lives, their experiences in the world beyond the front door of Hock’s. With only one other salesman these days he did this more often, and liked it, in fact looked forward to talking with customers, whose experiences became his."|"The Mosquito Coast"|"Paul Theroux"

00:00|midnight|"Men with torches marching at midnight across the valley fields—I had never seen anything like it. It was a snake of flame, and I thought I heard a rattling sound, the jacking of beans shaken in a can. But I was more curious than frightened, and I had hidden myself so well and was still so distant that the thing didn’t threaten me."|"The Mosquito Coast"|"Paul Theroux"
00:00|midnight|"Until I saw that marching procession at midnight, and the dead body on the cross, I could not imagine how anyone would be able to kill him. But that night was enough.

"< 12:00"|"Toward noon"|"Toward noon, we went up to the big windowless cold-storage building. Inside the thick walls it was cool. There was a stutter from the overloaded circuit, a stillness in the air, and the sharp aroma of asparagus ripening in the dark. The spears were taped into three-pound bundles. Because the tips are breakable and delicate, they are hard to store. These were packed as carefully on the shelves as if they were bunches of live ammunition. It was clear that Polski did not have much spare room, but Father said that it was amazing that Polski stored the asparagus at all, since the demand for it was so huge."|"The Mosquito Coast"|"Paul Theroux"
"ap 02:00"|two|"“I do a complete range of compasses,” the man said. He smoothed the knapsack with the flat of his hand and folded it like laundry, giving a little moan as he put it away. He placed a box on the counter. “This is one of my better ones,” he said, taking out a compass. “It’s got all the features of my more expensive models, but it’s only two and a quarter.”"|"The Mosquito Coast"|"Paul Theroux"
"ap ~ 04:00"|"Around four o’clock"|"Around four o’clock, he went into the house. He came out a little while later with an envelope in his hand. He was still whistling. He told me to take it over to Polski."|"The Mosquito Coast"|"Paul Theroux"

00:00|midnight|"I knew this man Semper. His was the face I had seen crossing the fields at midnight. He had been carrying the scarecrow’s corpse in his arms.

00:00|midnight|"He told us what he had done. He had worked until midnight repairing a pump. “The bushings were shot,” he said. Then the bulkhead had been emptied of seawater. But this had only corrected the list slightly. Supervising the crew (“It was fun—like being back at Polski’s and chewing the fat with those savages”), he had had them redirect the pump and empty a ballast tank and then winch back the shifted cargo containers. “One had a new Toyota in it—a huge great stupid Landcruiser, one of these Nipponese nightmares.” They had not finished the job until dawn, but the ship had gained speed and had stopped yawing."|"The Mosquito Coast"|"Paul Theroux"

12:00|noon|"The people laughed and sort of cowered in the shadow of the boxcar. The noon sun beat on the iron pier, and at the end of it, where Jerry and the twins were playing, the pier was watery from the heat shimmer and as wavy as the sea. Pelicans drooped on posts, the shoreline blazed. Here, sunlight came down hard and jangled against the sand."|"The Mosquito Coast"|"Paul Theroux"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"Jerry was yawning miserably on Mother’s lap—he was too big to be comfortable there—and the twins were already asleep under the awning. It was ten o’clock. It had rained twice since mid-afternoon, and still the lightning flashed on the sea in sudden bursts. It seemed cruel to have to leave the town at this late hour. We were an early-to-bed family, and it was way past bedtime. I envied the people in the houses I could see—the ones at the windows and even those I imagined swinging in hammocks in the shacks next to the beach. It did not excite me to be on this narrow boat and listening to the sea flopping against its wooden hull, I sat on a box and shivered. Mother lay down with Jerry and the twins—they were all in sleeping bags. I looked ashore. I did not want to leave here."|"The Mosquito Coast"|"Paul Theroux"
12:00|noon|"We managed fifteen miles or more, traveling upriver until noon, before Mr. Haddy began shouting about rock-stones all around. He didn’t give signals, he just howled. The water was not so muddy here—I could see eels and schools of tiny fish on the gravel bottom. In places there was barely enough room between the banks for the launch’s width to squeeze through, and the rapid water slowed us and splashed onto the deck."|"The Mosquito Coast"|"Paul Theroux"
12:00|noon|"We had started before dawn—so early, the nighttime mosquitoes were still out and biting us. But by noon, though we had gone miles, we were some distance from the mountains of Olancho that marked the end of the river, where Seville was. We tied up at a riverbank for lunch. It was so thickly overgrown we could not get off the boat. The bank was hidden under bush fans and yards of lianas. Mother had packed us a basket of fruit and cassava bread and fresh tomatoes and a Jeronimo drink that Father called Jungle Juice, made from guavas and mangoes. Clover said the juice wasn’t cold enough."|"The Mosquito Coast"|"Paul Theroux"
12:00|mid-day|"Every half-hour we froze a new batch of bricks, and by mid-day we were finished—a large blue-white iceberg lay steaming and sweating in the mud, with a tow rope frozen in its center. It was roughly the shape of a Volkswagen Beetle, but larger, on a platform of bamboo logs that served first as a sled and then as a raft. We had no difficulty launching it. The tow rope was hitched to Little Haddy, and its gunning engine got the ice down the bank and into the river. The Creoles—Harkins, Peaselee, and Maywit—were in the bow, and Mr. Haddy in the wheel house, the ice creaking, the bamboo groaning, and the muddy water splashing all around it."|"The Mosquito Coast"|"Paul Theroux"
00:00|midnight|"These were the stinks and perfumes of early morning, dew-soaked grass, and wet petals, and they overwhelmed the civilized smells of Jeronimo. Everything was black under the black sky. The stars, which at midnight looked like a spillway of broken pearls, did not shine at this hour—they were holes of light, like eye squints in black masks."|"The Mosquito Coast"|"Paul Theroux"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"It was after midnight, still so hot the grass and trees howled with insects. Frogs bellyrumbled in the shrunken river, and I could hear the current sucking at the reeds. These were the noises I heard the seconds after I woke. Father had put his hands on my face. In that darkness, I thought it was one of the men who had come to strangle me."|"The Mosquito Coast"|"Paul Theroux"
12:00|noon|"It was early afternoon. He had slept almost thirteen hours, but no one mentioned the time. “Liars, swindlers, degenerates who sleep till noon”—those were some of the people he hated. He had always told us that deep sleep was a form of illness, and he blamed us when we overslept."|"The Mosquito Coast"|"Paul Theroux"
"ap 03:30"|three-thirty|"“It three—three-thirty,” Mr. Haddy said, turning his pleading eyes at the halo of hazy sun, to prove that he knew the time without the watch."|"The Mosquito Coast"|"Paul Theroux"
00:00|midnight|"“It’s raining, Mr. Haddy,” was all I could say. It was midnight, and stormy, and he had broken a shutter and clamped his hand over my mouth—to bring these things. What were they for?"|"The Mosquito Coast"|"Paul Theroux"
12:00|noon|"We concentrated on what was left of the garden. But down here at the shore I could see that it was not the rain that had done the worst damage. The level of the lagoon had risen, as Mr. Haddy had predicted, and submerged the plants that had been near the water’s edge. Jerry wanted to tell Father, to show him he had been mistaken, but before he could, it began to rain again. We stripped our clothes off and began bailing. It rained five times that day. At noon it was so dark we had to use candles in the hut to see our crabs."|"The Mosquito Coast"|"Paul Theroux"
12:00|noon|"Jerry said, “We have a white house in a green field, with trees around it. There are birds in the trees. Catbirds and jays. The sun is shining.

"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"Five days after leaving the Thurtles’ village, at about noon, we heard an airplane. Its rumble-buzz came near. Though we could not see it, it brought me a familiar feeling: a plane going overhead was like getting a haircut. I ducked when I heard it, and I felt its shimmying teeth on the back of my neck. Father denied it was a plane. Crosswinds, he said. But he went silent—his face looked as if he had just sat on something like wet grass or cowflap. I was more hopeful then about Guampu."|"The Mosquito Coast"|"Paul Theroux"
