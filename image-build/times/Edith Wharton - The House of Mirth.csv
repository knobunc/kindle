slope of her slender sides, which gave a kind of wild-wood grace to
her outline—as though she were a captured dryad subdued to the
conventions of the drawing-room; and Selden reflected that it was
the same streak of sylvan freedom in her nature that lent such

wanted to write at once, while she could trust to the strength of
her resolve. She was still languid from her brief sleep and the
exhilaration of the evening, and the sight of Selden's writing
brought back the culminating moment of her triumph: the moment when
she had read in his eyes that no philosophy was proof against her
power. It would be pleasant to have that sensation
again . . . no one else could give it to her in its
fulness; and she could not bear to mar her mood of luxurious
retrospection by an act of definite refusal. She took up her pen

feast a few of the performers of the previous evening. There was to
be plantation music in the studio after dinner—for Mrs. Fisher,
despairing of the republic, had taken up modelling, and annexed to
her small crowded house a spacious apartment, which, whatever its
uses in her hours of plastic inspiration, served at other times for
the exercise of an indefatigable hospitality. Lily was reluctant to
leave, for the dinner was amusing, and she would have liked to
lounge over a cigarette and hear a few songs; but she could not
break her engagement with Judy, and shortly after ten she asked her
hostess to ring for a hansom, and drove up Fifth Avenue to the

"ap 11:30"|"half-past eleven"|"But with the turn of the wheels reaction came, and shuddering
darkness closed on her. ""I can't think—I can't
think,"" she moaned, and leaned her head against the rattling
side of the cab. She seemed a stranger to herself, or rather there
were two selves in her, the one she had always known, and a new
abhorrent being to which it found itself chained. She had once
picked up, in a house where she was staying, a translation of the
EUMENIDES, and her imagination had been seized by the high terror
of the scene where Orestes, in the cave of the oracle, finds his
implacable huntresses asleep, and snatches an hour's repose.
Yes, the Furies might sometimes sleep, but they were there, always
there in the dark corners, and now they were awake and the iron
clang of their wings was in her brain . . . She
opened her eyes and saw the streets passing—the familiar alien
streets. All she looked on was the same and yet changed. There was
a great gulf fixed between today and yesterday. Everything in the
past seemed simple, natural, full of daylight—and she was alone in
a place of darkness and pollution.—Alone! It was the loneliness
that frightened her. Her eyes fell on an illuminated clock at a
street corner, and she saw that the hands marked the half hour
after eleven. Only half-past eleven—there were hours and hours left
of the night! And she must spend them alone, shuddering sleepless
on her bed. Her soft nature recoiled from this ordeal, which had
none of the stimulus of conflict to goad her through it. Oh, the
slow cold drip of the minutes on her head! She had a vision of
herself lying on the black walnut bed—and the darkness would
frighten her, and if she left the light burning the dreary details
of the room would brand themselves forever on her brain. She had
always hated her room at Mrs. Peniston's—its ugliness, its
impersonality, the fact that nothing in it was really hers. To a
torn heart uncomforted by human nearness a room may open almost
human arms, and the being to whom no four walls mean more than any
others, is, at such hours, expatriate everywhere."|"The House of Mirth"|"Edith Wharton"
12:00|midday|"But now—that little BUT passed like a sponge over all his vows.
His reasoned-out resistances seemed for the moment so much less
important than the question as to when Lily would receive his note!
He yielded himself to the charm of trivial preoccupations,
wondering at what hour her reply would be sent, with what words it
would begin. As to its import he had no doubt—he was as sure of her
surrender as of his own. And so he had leisure to muse on all its
exquisite details, as a hard worker, on a holiday morning, might
lie still and watch the beam of light travel gradually across his
room. But if the new light dazzled, it did not blind him. He could
still discern the outline of facts, though his own relation to them
had changed. He was no less conscious than before of what was said
of Lily Bart, but he could separate the woman he knew from the
vulgar estimate of her. His mind turned to Gerty Farish's
words, and the wisdom of the world seemed a groping thing beside
the insight of innocence. BLESSED ARE THE PURE IN HEART, FOR THEY
SHALL SEE GOD—even the hidden god in their neighbour's breast!
Selden was in the state of impassioned self-absorption that the
first surrender to love produces. His craving was for the
companionship of one whose point of view should justify his own,
who should confirm, by deliberate observation, the truth to which
his intuitions had leaped. He could not wait for the midday recess,
but seized a moment's leisure in court to scribble his telegram
to Gerty Farish."|"The House of Mirth"|"Edith Wharton"
"ap 10:15"|"quarter past ten"|"""Mrs. Fisher's? You say she was dining there?
There's music afterward; I believe I had a card from her.""
He glanced at the foolish pink-faced clock that was drumming out
this hideous hour. ""A quarter past ten? I might look in there
now; the Fisher evenings are amusing. I haven't kept you up too
late, Gerty? You look tired—I've rambled on and bored
you."" And in the unwonted overflow of his feelings, he left a
cousinly kiss upon her cheek."|"The House of Mirth"|"Edith Wharton"
"ap 04:00"|four|"At Mrs. Fisher's, through the cigar-smoke of the studio, a
dozen voices greeted Selden. A song was pending as he entered, and
he dropped into a seat near his hostess, his eyes roaming in search
of Miss Bart. But she was not there, and the discovery gave him a
pang out of all proportion to its seriousness; since the note in
his breast-pocket assured him that at four the next day they would
meet. To his impatience it seemed immeasurably long to wait, and
half-ashamed of the impulse, he leaned to Mrs. Fisher to ask, as
the music ceased, if Miss Bart had not dined with her."|"The House of Mirth"|"Edith Wharton"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o'clock"|"The pink-faced clock drummed out another hour, and Gerty rose
with a start. She had an appointment early the next morning with a
district visitor on the East side. She put out her lamp, covered
the fire, and went into her bedroom to undress. In the little glass
above her dressing-table she saw her face reflected against the
shadows of the room, and tears blotted the reflection. What right
had she to dream the dreams of loveliness? A dull face invited a
dull fate. She cried quietly as she undressed, laying aside her
clothes with her habitual precision, setting everything in order
for the next day, when the old life must be taken up as though
there had been no break in its routine. Her servant did not come
till eight o'clock, and she prepared her own tea-tray and
placed it beside the bed. Then she locked the door of the flat,
extinguished her light and lay down. But on her bed sleep would not
come, and she lay face to face with the fact that she hated Lily
Bart. It closed with her in the darkness like some formless evil to
be blindly grappled with. Reason, judgment, renunciation, all the
sane daylight forces, were beaten back in the sharp struggle for
self-preservation. She wanted happiness—wanted it as fiercely and
unscrupulously as Lily did, but without Lily's power of
obtaining it. And in her conscious impotence she lay shivering, and
hated her friend—"|"The House of Mirth"|"Edith Wharton"

at any rate, I am not going to waste any of mine in paying them.

seeing him. Was there not a promise of rescue in his love? As she
had lain at Gerty's side the night before, she had thought of
his coming, and of the sweetness of weeping out her pain upon his
breast. Of course she had meant to clear herself of its
consequences before she met him—she had never really doubted that
Mrs. Peniston would come to her aid. And she had felt, even in the

anew between the impulse to confide in Selden and the dread of
destroying his illusions. But as the minutes passed the need of
throwing herself on his comprehension became more urgent: she could
not bear the weight of her misery alone. There would be a perilous
moment, perhaps: but could she not trust to her beauty to bridge it
over, to land her safe in the shelter of his devotion?"|"The House of Mirth"|"Edith Wharton"

been detained, or had misread her hurriedly scrawled note, taking
the four for a five. The ringing of the door-bell a few minutes
after five confirmed this supposition, and made Lily hastily
resolve to write more legibly in future. The sound of steps in the
hall, and of the butler's voice preceding them, poured fresh
energy into her veins. She felt herself once more the alert and
competent moulder of emergencies, and the remembrance of her power
over Selden flushed her with sudden confidence. But when the
drawing-room door opened it was Rosedale who came in."|"The House of Mirth"|"Edith Wharton"

that she would hear from Selden before noon; but the day passed
without his writing or coming. Lily remained at home, lunching and
dining alone with her aunt, who complained of flutterings of the
heart, and talked icily on general topics. Mrs. Peniston went to
bed early, and when she had gone Lily sat down and wrote a note to
Selden. She was about to ring for a messenger to despatch it when
her eye fell on a paragraph in the evening paper which lay at her
elbow: ""Mr. Lawrence Selden was among the passengers sailing
this afternoon for Havana and the West Indies on the Windward Liner
Antilles."""|"The House of Mirth"|"Edith Wharton"

from Selden, or a message—or he might be there himself, on the

been a mistake—it might be another Lawrence Selden who had gone to
Havana—all these possibilities had time to flash through her mind,

the blaze of crowded baccarat tables, he caught sight of Lord
Hubert Dacey, seated with his habitual worn smile behind a rapidly
dwindling heap of gold. The heap being in due course wiped out,
Lord Hubert rose with a shrug, and joining Selden, adjourned with
him to the deserted terrace of the club. It was now past midnight,

tentatively, after pausing to grope for a cigarette: ""Miss

and trying to sleep. Lily thought she understood the reason of the
rebuff. Her hostess had not been included in the Duchess's
invitation, though she herself had made the most loyal efforts in
that direction. But her grace was impervious to hints, and invited
or omitted as she chose. It was not Lily's fault if Mrs.
Dorset's complicated attitudes did not fall in with the
Duchess's easy gait. The Duchess, who seldom explained herself,
had not formulated her objection beyond saying: ""She's
