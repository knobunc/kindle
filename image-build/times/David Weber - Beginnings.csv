"ap 02:08"|"Two hours and eight minutes"|"“Two hours and eight minutes,” Lee answered. “Meaning I've got no time to catch you up on what we found aboard the Blossom. Hell, we don't even have time to get instructions from, or clear a farther ops plan with, the brass back on Mars.”"|Beginnings|"David Weber"
"ap > 02:16"|"past 216"|"“I'm sure you're right—but it's going to have to wait.” Lee glanced at the clock. “We'll be drifting past 216 Kleopatra in only two hours, and we've got a lot of work to do.”"|Beginnings|"David Weber"
"ap 01:00"|1|"Lee nodded. “I think I understand, Sergeant. But hopefully we've gotten beyond our initial friction—at least somewhat. I'm still going to expect an hour of 1-gee PT from you each day. However, you are now to fulfill that requirement by spending three separate twenty-minute periods in the gym, with at least an hour of nonphysical duties preceding each of those PT periods.”"|Beginnings|"David Weber"
"ap 01:00"|one|"“Maybe two,” Fornier repeated. “So let's call it one and a half. One and a half out of eight—make it nine, since you're not political and I assume you consider yourself nonuseless.

Make that four missiles, same impact projection . . . make it six. Missile trace, six, impact one hundred forty-eight seconds.”"|Beginnings|"David Weber"
"ap 02:00"|two|"The bullet just missed the peak bear's lower jaw. It struck two centimeters to the right of the exact center of its chest, and the creature's roar turned into a high, shocked squeal. It staggered, continuing to drive forward but no longer under control. Momentum carried it, not purpose, and Honor Harrington stepped smoothly to one side, pivoting to keep her target in her field of fire as five hundred kilos of mortally wounded peak bear staggered past her. It went down, twitching, struggling to get its legs back under it so it could rise and kill her with its own dying strength. It snarled, spraying blood as it started to come back upright . . . and she put a second shot through its right ear from a range of five meters to be sure it didn't."|Beginnings|"David Weber"
