"ap ~ 03:00"|"About three o’clock"|"People live in the Fakahatchee and around it, but it is an unmistakably inhospitable place. In 1872 a surveyor made this entry in his field notes: “A pond, surrounded by bay and cypress swamp, impracticable. Pond full of monstrous alligators. Counted fifty and stopped.” In fact, the hours I spent in the Fakahatchee retracing Laroche’s footsteps were probably the most miserable I have spent in my entire life. The swampy part of the Fakahatchee is hot and wet and buggy and full of cottonmouth snakes and diamondback rattlers and alligators and snapping turtles and poisonous plants and wild hogs and things that stick into you and on you and fly into your nose and eyes. Crossing the swamp is a battle. You can walk through about as easily as you could walk through a car wash. The sinkholes are filled with as much as seven feet of standing water, and around them the air has the slack, drapey weight of wet velvet. Sides of trees look sweaty. Leaves are slick from the humidity. The mud sucks your feet and tries to keep ahold of them; if it fails it will settle for your shoes. The water in the swamp is stained black with tannin from the bark of cypress trees that is so corrosive it can cure leather. Whatever isn’t wet in the Fakahatchee is blasted. The sun pounds the treeless prairies. The grass gets so dry that the friction from a car can set it on fire, and the burning grass can engulf the car in flames. The Fakahatchee used to be littered with burned-up cars that had been abandoned by panfried adventurers—a botanist who traveled through in the 1940s recalled in an interview that he was most impressed by the area’s variety of squirrels and the number of charred Model T’s. The swamp’s stillness and darkness and thickness can rattle your nerves. In 1885 a sailor on a plume-collecting expedition wrote in his diary: “The place looked wild and lonely. About three o’clock it seemed to get on Henry’s nerves and we saw him crying, he could not tell us why he was just plain scared.”"|"The Orchid Thief"|"Susan Orlean"
"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"I called Laroche the next day to tell him about the gala and the flowers I’d seen and the people I’d met there. I had gotten to know him well enough by then to know exactly how he’d sound and what he’d say. No matter the time of day—that day I happened to be calling around noon—Laroche always answered the phone sounding as if he’d been woken up after falling asleep on a couch watching a game show. I don’t think I ever actually woke him up. It was just his low, slushy voice and his manner—drowsy, cross, suspicious as a tax examiner’s. Then, once he would establish that it was me on the phone, his voice would amplify in one blast and he would immediately start complaining that I had broken some promise to call him or see him or meet him somewhere. The complaints were never true. I had nothing else to do while I was in Florida except to follow him around, and besides the obvious fact that he was the whole point of my being in Florida I was very homesick a lot of the time and was always excited and conscientious when I had plans. In fact, Laroche was the one who was always leaving me in the lurch. When I first met him his accusations rattled me, but I had finally persuaded myself to ignore them. That day when I called he managed a muffled hello and then began chiding me for not calling earlier, and when he was done, I told him about the Orchid Society party, and when I was done, he cleared his throat and said, “I’m going to a little orchid show in Fort Lauderdale this afternoon, if you want to come. It’s just a little show, but there will probably be some cute things there,” and then he gave me directions to War Memorial Auditorium, where it was being held."|"The Orchid Thief"|"Susan Orlean"
"ap 09:30"|930|"I always felt lucky when there was an orchid event being held while I was on one of my trips to Florida, but in truth there really isn’t ever a time when there isn’t some kind of plant show or garden meeting or plant lecture going on. The Miami paper always publishes a list of the week’s upcoming plant events in the area. That week, for instance, there was going to be a Tropical Flowering Tree Society meeting; a South Florida Fern Society lecture (“How to Groom Ferns for Shows”); the Fort Lauderdale Orchid Society meeting; a Rare Fruit Council lecture (“Transplanting Mature Tropical Fruit Trees”); the Bromeliad Society of South Florida show and sale; meetings of the Gold Coast Orchid Society and the Florida Native Plant Society and the South Florida Orchid Society (“Orchid Trends in California”) and the South Dade Garden Club and the Evening Garden Club of Fort Lauderdale. In Florida, plants are everywhere, like money. Plants are money. Wherever I drove, I passed greenhouses as long as train stations, and potted palms being sold out of the backs of rust-mottled pickup trucks, and Christmas tree farms, and orchid farms, and houseplant farms, and sod farms, and tree-moving companies (CALL US AT 930-TREE!), and signs on light posts saying PALMS CHEAP FOR SALE AHEAD or THIS WAY: MANGO AND BANANA TREES, and flatbed trucks loaded with palm trees stacked lengthwise, their trunks wrapped in wide white muslin strips so that they looked like racehorses’ legs. If you didn’t like plants you would be lonely here."|"The Orchid Thief"|"Susan Orlean"
07:30|"7:30 A.M."|"It was illuminating to be with Laroche in a place like this. People noticed him. In appearance he was arresting. He had possibly the most untanned complexion in the state of Florida, and his thinness made his body look as if it stuck in more than out. At the Fort Lauderdale show he was wearing overalls faded almost white that hung off him like laundry on a line. His nearly colorless eyes and toothlessness made him look spectral. People seemed to take to him anyway. He chatted his way around the auditorium. Some people recognized him from the photograph that ran with the story I wrote about him in The New Yorker, so they approached him and said something friendly about it, which pleased him—he’d answer, “Yep, that was me, I’m the one who stole all those orchids,” and talk proudly about the case. Or he’d volunteer comments to the dealers or the spectators, or declare something loudly and profanely, which always got him a look and usually started a conversation. He talked constantly, he knew something about everything or he was very good at faking that he did, he reeled off Latin names and botanical facts and took professorial interest in my learning as we went along. He was an endless puzzlement. I was always surprised by how much people liked him. They liked him in spite of the fact that he is a confirmed misanthrope, and that he has none of the usual traits of popularity—conventional good looks, smooth manners, an agreeable temperament—and that he has a challenging, slightly obscene sense of humor and the habit of lateness and that he constantly over-promises. They liked him, I think, because he could be as earnest about their concerns as he was about his own, and because his self-confidence was contagious—he made people feel that they were innately able to do the right thing. He could even persuade you that the wrong thing was the right thing if it was the only option you had. A few weeks before the Fort Lauderdale show I was staying in West Palm Beach at my parents’ condominium and wanted to talk to Laroche, so we arranged to meet halfway between West Palm and his house in North Miami. I told him I had to meet early because my mother was in Florida with me and I needed to borrow her car and didn’t want to leave her stranded for the day. Laroche insisted that he was always up at dawn and could meet me at 7:30 A.M. or so. He also promised that he would figure out an easy place for our rendezvous and call me in the morning with directions. He even offered to give me a wake-up call. I woke up on my own at 6:30 A.M. and went for a short run around the golf course. I came back and showered and got dressed. At 10:00 A.M. I still hadn’t heard from him, so I finally called his house. His dad answered and said John was sleeping and would probably be mad if he woke him up. By the time Laroche called me back it was almost 11:00. Before I had a chance to bawl him out, he announced that he had decided that getting together wasn’t a good idea since I was visiting with my mom. “I mean, she’s your mom and all that,” he said. “I mean, that’s important. You don’t see your mom every day, you know? Look, look, here’s what we’ll do. I think you should go hang out with your mom, take her out for a nice lunch or brunch, enjoy the day, you call me tomorrow, I’ll let you know what’s going on, we’ll talk, everything will be fine.” He was so sure it was the right plan that he convinced me that it was the right plan and probably what I’d wanted to do all along."|"The Orchid Thief"|"Susan Orlean"

"< 00:00"|"nearly midnight"|"Instead I went to watch the end of the rodeo. The first night’s rodeo had been restricted to Indians, but Saturday night was open to any kind of cowboy or cowgirl, and a lot of the roping teams were made up of one Seminole and one non-Seminole. I watched the team of Wildcat Jumper and Sean John storm around after a thick-necked bull named Jimmy Lee while the sun fell behind the palm trees. I had a long drive ahead of me and it was late, so I watched one more team try to rope a bull named Risky Business and then I walked back to my car. I passed the Seminole Casino on the way, the acres of parking lots with guard towers raised like hackles here and there, the plain gray facade of the casino building. There was not one empty parking spot in the place. It was nearly midnight, but people were still streaming in—couples in dinner clothes, a broad-backed older woman with an aluminum walker, a pair of white-blond big-breasted girls in cowboy shirts and boots, a man with thick plastic glasses and the heedful face of a night watchman. The casino wasn’t much to look at inside, except for the painting of Chief Billie on the wall with the Seminole greeting “Sho-naa-bish” in giant script beside him. Otherwise it was a big, quiet cavern with tables and tables of men playing Texas Hold-Em and 7-Card Stud beside a sign that said POKER IS FUN AND RELAXING. The only sound was the clicking of poker chips. It was a room filled with a million precise, intense, noiseless movements, like an operating theater during brain surgery. In another room, hundreds of people seated at long tables were playing bingo. Many of them had collections of lucky totems next to their bingo cards—rabbits’ feet, plastic elephants, statuettes of the Virgin Mary, snapshots, small plush toys, rosaries—and they were silent, too, until the man at the head of the room called out “B-twenty-three” or “O-seven,” and then there would be a murmur and a shifting, like the sound of water running out of a tub, and when someone yelled out “Bingo!” there was the sound of hands slapping down on cardboard game cards as the exasperated losers swept their chips away so they could start again. The waiters and the waitresses and the poker dealers and the bingo callers and the valet parkers and the casino cashiers were all white people, all with fluorescent-tinted skin and stiff hairdos, and all the customers were white and some had tourist tans and bloodshot eyes, and even though the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Seminole tribe’s annual powwow was being celebrated only a few yards away and the chief of the Seminole tribe was peering down on every single table of Texas Hold-Em and 7-Card Stud, you felt nothing of that world at all in here—you felt only the fever and focus of the games and the hard heat of people wanting to win."|"The Orchid Thief"|"Susan Orlean"

The way he recited this made it sound like a fairy tale or Bible story—the bleak journey with the radiant finale, the hopeful journey through darkness into light. A more conventional, more comfortable story wouldn’t have this rhythm of struggle and victory, and instead it would have had the unswinging tempo of usualness and habit, a kind of deadly incessancy.

"ap ~ 03:00"|"About three o’clock"|"A wave of wind pushed by. It felt like the exhaust from a pizza shop, oily and thick and hot. My cheeks were pulsing. I felt extremely uncomposed, like many other Fakahatchee wanderers: The place looked wild and lonely. About three o’clock it seemed to get on Henry’s nerves and we saw him crying, he could not tell us why, he was just plain scared. I did want desperately to see a ghost orchid in bloom, to complete the cycle, to make sense of everything I’d been doing in Florida, but at that moment I wanted even more not to spend the night in the swamp. I also very much wanted to kill Laroche, to actually murder him and leave his body here, not because murder is part of my nature or upbringing and not because I thought it would help me find the way out of the swamp but just because I was furious with him and I was wrought up and had a lot of nervous energy. The sundial was definitely not working. Something whirred in the underbrush, and a crow dipped down from above and cawed. A hundred years ago plume hunters would come here and gather enough feathers to decorate ten thousand fashionable ladies’ hats. If a ranger interfered with them, they would kill him. “The thing about computers,” Laroche said, “the thing that I like is that I’m immersed in it but it’s not a living thing that’s going to leave or die or something. I like having the minimum number of living things to worry about in my life.”"|"The Orchid Thief"|"Susan Orlean"

00:00|Midnight|"“Susan Orlean plunges into the world of orchid collectors to create a book that is meticulously researched and written in the pleasing, flowing prose of books like The Perfect Storm and Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.… Anyone interested in orchids, Florida, the collecting mentality, fixation, or just good nonfiction will enjoy The Orchid Thief. Read it out on the patio, next to your orchid plant, but take care … obsession can be contagious.”"|"The Orchid Thief"|"Susan Orlean"
