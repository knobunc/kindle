Villeperce was a tiny town, several kilometers from Fontainebleau. Why should the Odd Pair have come here?"|"Ripley Under Water"|"Patricia Highsmith"

Tom saw them first, through the thickening flow of pedestrians (it was midday, lunchtime), but within seconds the Odd Pair had focused on him. Tom looked somewhere else, straight ahead, and was sorry that his airline ticket envelope was still in his left hand, visible on their side. Would the Pritchards notice it? Would they cruise the road past Belle Ombre, explore the lane to one side of it, once they ascertained that he was absent for a while? Or was he worrying too much, absurdly? Tom trotted the last meters toward the gold-tinted windows of Mon Luxe. Before going through the open door, he stopped and looked back to see if the pair was still staring at him, even drifting into the travel agency. Nothing would surprise him, Tom told himself. He saw Pritchard’s broad shoulders in his blue blazer just above the crowd, saw the back of his head. The Odd Pair were, apparently, passing the travel agency by."|"Ripley Under Water"|"Patricia Highsmith"

The beginning of his troubles, Tom thought. The first man he had killed, and the only one he regretted killing, really, the only crime he was sorry about. Dickie Greenleaf, a well-to-do (for those times) American, living in Mongibello on the Italian west coast, had befriended him, shown him hospitality, and Tom had respected and admired him, in fact, perhaps too much. Dickie had turned against him, and Tom had resented that, and without planning too much Tom had picked up an oar and killed Dickie one afternoon when they had been alone in a small boat. Dead? Of course Dickie had been dead these many years! Tom had weighted Dickie’s body with a rock and pushed it out of that boat, and it had sunk, and—well, in all these years Dickie hadn’t surfaced, and why should he now?"|"Ripley Under Water"|"Patricia Highsmith"

He was an architect, and he and his wife had two children in their early teens. The house that David Pritchard said he had rented was beyond the Grais’ house, which was why Tom turned right at a certain road in Villeperce: he could tell himself he was going by the Grais to say hello or some such. Tom had driven through the comforting main street of the town, with its post office, one butcher’s shop, one bakery, and bar-tabac, which was about all Villeperce consisted of."|"Ripley Under Water"|"Patricia Highsmith"

"ap 04:30"|"half past four"|"At half past four, when the sun was still far above the horizon, Tom took the brown Renault and drove off in the direction of Voisy. Such a difference, he thought, between the sunlit farm landscape today and that night with Bernard, a moonless night as he remembered, when he had been uncertain where he was going. Until now, he told himself, that watery grave of Murchison had been a most successful hiding place, and perhaps it still was."|"Ripley Under Water"|"Patricia Highsmith"
03:00|"3 a.m."|"Tom got into the red Mercedes again, drove off in the direction of Fontainebleau, then took the next left-hand turn for no reason. His direction now was southwest, more or less. What was Heloise doing now? Strolling back to the Hotel Miramare, Casablanca, with Noelle, both carrying plastic bags and newly acquired baskets full of afternoon purchases? Both talking about a shower and a nap before the dinner hour? Should he try Heloise at 3 a.m. tonight?"|"Ripley Under Water"|"Patricia Highsmith"
"ap 09:12"|Nine-twelve|"Nine-twelve now. Mme Annette had finished in the kitchen, and was probably deep in television. Tom thought he might make a sketch or two for his view-from-the-window oil."|"Ripley Under Water"|"Patricia Highsmith"

"ap 10:00"|ten|"Having heard nothing from Mme Annette, Tom took off before ten, and thought to try Nemours first for the clippers. Tom found himself taking unknown lanes again, because he had ample time: he had only to glance at the next cluster of signs on a post for directions.

"ap ~ 09:30"|"around nine-thirty"|"One evening he went around nine-thirty to the bar-tabac, for a change of atmosphere. At this time, it was a slightly different crowd from the five-thirty after-work crowd. Now there were a few card-playing men, who Tom had once supposed were mostly bachelors, but he knew now that this wasn’t so. Many married men simply liked to spend their evenings in the local tavern, instead of watching TV, for instance—which in fact they could also do at Marie and Georges’."|"Ripley Under Water"|"Patricia Highsmith"
12:00|noon|"Marie had said the same words several days ago, as Tom recollected, but Marie was a busy woman, having to be hospitable to a hundred or so customers morning, noon and night.

Cruising once up a canal, in the middle logically, at two kilometers an hour, three hours morning, same in afternoon, would cover twelve kilometers a day, but not with difficulties, such as another boat every half-hour, plus perhaps loading the boat on to the pickup to take it to another canal. On a river, a back-and-forth trip might be necessary to cover the width."|"Ripley Under Water"|"Patricia Highsmith"
"ap 03:10"|"ten past three"|"Cheered, in the main, by Heloise’s call, Tom picked up the telephone again, checked his watch—ten past three—and dialed the Pritchard number. It rang five, six, seven times. Then Janice’s high-pitched, American voice said, “Hel-loo-o?”"|"Ripley Under Water"|"Patricia Highsmith"
"ap 03:30"|"half-past three"|"Just where were Pritchard and Teddy now? The energy necessary, Tom thought, to lift that boat even twice a day off the pickup and back onto it again! Could the pair of them be scraping the Loing bottom near Voisy this minute? Tom had a desire to go there—maybe in the white station wagon for a change—to satisfy his curiosity now, at half-past three. Then he realized that he was too afraid to do that, to cruise for a second time around the scene of the disposal. Suppose someone had noticed and remembered his face, the day he had driven to Voisy and crossed the bridge? Suppose he ran smack into David and Teddy dragging their hooks just there?"|"Ripley Under Water"|"Patricia Highsmith"
"ap ~ 03:00"|"about three"|"Another Tuesday came, and Tom thought of M. Lepetit, the music teacher, who usually came on Tuesdays. But Tom and Heloise had temporarily stopped their lessons: they had not known how long they would be in North Africa, and Tom had not rung up M. Lepetit since his return, though he had practiced. The Grais invited Tom for a meal one weekend, but Tom declined, with thanks. Tom did ring Agnes Grais on a weekday, and invited himself at about three one afternoon."|"Ripley Under Water"|"Patricia Highsmith"

Tom realized that he was torturing himself, because he couldn’t, with Mme Annette in the kitchen, which had a window, go outside now and take a good look at what was in his station wagon.

He hated being away from the house for nearly two hours. His watch said five to ten. Tom strolled to the bar cart, chose the tiniest glass (stemmed) and poured a minuscule Remy Martin, savored it on his tongue and sniffed the glass. Then he washed and dried the glass in the kitchen and brought it back to the bar cart. Wallet, keys, all set."|"Ripley Under Water"|"Patricia Highsmith"

Madame Annette didn’t mention hearing anything. I found it around seven this morning. He came by the side here—maybe with his helper Teddy, but even alone he could’ve dragged it without too much trouble. From the lane. Hard to see the lane now, but you can drive a car into it, stop, and walk onto my land.” As Tom glanced in that direction, he fancied he could see a faint depression in the grass, a path such as a person walking would have made, since the bones weren’t heavy enough to have had to be dragged."|"Ripley Under Water"|"Patricia Highsmith"

He would see the house door open, unless the wind blew it shut, might notice the lights on—the light on the porch roof.” Or the postman might walk up from the driveway direction toward the main steps to the porch.

It was there. Tom slid the brass-cornered drawer shut again. He had hidden the ring there last night; otherwise he would not have been able to sleep, knowing that the ring was simply in a trouser pocket.
