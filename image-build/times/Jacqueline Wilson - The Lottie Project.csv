"ap 09:03"|"three minutes past nine"|"‘It’s three minutes past nine,’ Miss Beckworth announced. ‘You’re late.’"|"The Lottie Project"|"Jacqueline Wilson"
19:30|"half past seven in the evening"|"‘Don’t be silly, Charlotte. It’s half past seven in the evening,’ Grandma said briskly."|"The Lottie Project"|"Jacqueline Wilson"
07:00|"seven in the morning"|"She charged out at seven in the morning on Friday to buy the local paper and she skimmed through all the small print looking for jobs."|"The Lottie Project"|"Jacqueline Wilson"
"ap 11:30"|"half past eleven"|"‘It would not be fun,’ she said. ‘I wouldn’t be making any cocktails there. Just serving pints of bitter to a lot of boring old men trying to look down my front. I could put up with that, but I wouldn’t be free till half past eleven every night and then I’d have to walk miles home unless I forked out for a taxi – and they were only paying fifty pounds for five full evening shifts. We can’t pay the mortgage with that.’"|"The Lottie Project"|"Jacqueline Wilson"
"ap 23:51"|"nine to twelve"|"‘I know. But look, there are heaps of other adverts for cleaners. I could go after them too. Listen. “Private house, cleaning, some ironing, nine to twelve, Mondays and Thursdays, thirty pounds”. And then there’s this one here, they want two hours’ cleaning daily plus someone to look after a little boy after school.’"|"The Lottie Project"|"Jacqueline Wilson"
"ap 06:00"|six|"‘Tomorrow.’ I heard Jo gulp. ‘At six. In the morning. Oh, Charlie, I must be mad. I could claim income support and lie in bed till noon.’"|"The Lottie Project"|"Jacqueline Wilson"
12:00|noon|"‘Tomorrow.’ I heard Jo gulp. ‘At six. In the morning. Oh, Charlie, I must be mad. I could claim income support and lie in bed till noon.’"|"The Lottie Project"|"Jacqueline Wilson"
"ap 05:00"|five|"She’d started her job at the supermarket and was finding it an awful struggle to get out of bed at five."|"The Lottie Project"|"Jacqueline Wilson"
"ap 05:00"|five|"‘You’ll exhaust yourself,’ I said. ‘What with getting up at five and doing the supermarket and then looking after the silly little sprog in the afternoons.’"|"The Lottie Project"|"Jacqueline Wilson"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"I peered at the alarm clock. ‘It’s only three o’clock. So who on earth’s phoning . . .?’ I said, as I jumped out of bed and ran into the living room. ‘Hello?’ I said, as I snatched up the phone. ‘Hello, who is it?’"|"The Lottie Project"|"Jacqueline Wilson"
"ap 06:00"|six|"‘That’s right, Mark. We’ve got to be positive,’ said Jo, putting her arm round him. She held her other arm out to me. ‘Come here, Charlie.’ But I couldn’t go. I felt too ashamed. Police came, police went. The phone rang but it was Mark’s ex-wife, ringing from an all-night motorway café. She was on her way here with her new man, desperate to know if there was any further news. The policewoman made more tea, endless cups, although no-one took more than a few sips of each fresh brew. Someone switched on the radio at six and tuned it into the local station."|"The Lottie Project"|"Jacqueline Wilson"
05:30|"half past five in the morning"|"Jo came rushing in to tell me she liked it at half past five in the morning."|"The Lottie Project"|"Jacqueline Wilson"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"Jo still had to do her supermarket shift early Saturday morning, but I met her at eight o’clock and we went straight to the station and set off for Bournemouth. Robin and Mark met us off the train. Robin looked a bit bigger and bouncier out of bed, though he was so well wrapped up against the sea breeze that he could barely move. Birdie’s appearance had deteriorated even more because he’d dived into the sea by mistake when Robin was paddling in wellie boots – but at least he’d had a good wash."|"The Lottie Project"|"Jacqueline Wilson"
"ap 03:00"|three|"He was a little optimistic. But we had fun all the same. The party ended at three and we were allowed to go home then."|"The Lottie Project"|"Jacqueline Wilson"
"ap 05:30"|"half past five"|"‘The thing is, the shop manageress is going to have a baby. She wants to start her maternity leave in January – and even though I’m only temporary they’re asking if I’m interested. It won’t be for ever, of course, though she might decide she wants to stay at home with the baby – but it would still be great to get back to the work I like. But of course it would be full time, through till half past five.’"|"The Lottie Project"|"Jacqueline Wilson"
