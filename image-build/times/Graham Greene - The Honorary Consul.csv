The Governor’s party would have surely dispersed by that time, and Charley Fortnum would be well on his way home.

"~ 11:00"|"about eleven in the morning"|"His first attempt to see the Consul was not successful. He arrived at the Consulate about eleven in the morning. The Union Jack fluttered from the dubious pole in the hot dry wind from the Chaco. He wondered why it was flying at all, until he remembered that the day was the anniversary of the armistice of one world war before the last. He rang the bell and soon he felt sure that an eye was watching him through a spyhole in the door. He stood well back in the sunlight to be inspected, and immediately a small dark woman with a big nose snatched the door open. She stared at him with the intense preoccupied gaze of a bird of prey which was accustomed to watch a point from far off for indications of carrion; perhaps she was surprised to find the carrion so close and still alive. No, she said, the Consul was not in. No, she was not expecting him. Tomorrow? . . . Perhaps. She couldn’t be sure about that. It hardly seemed to Doctor Plarr the proper way to run a Consulate."|"The Honorary Consul"|"Graham Greene"

They left their table at midnight and set out on foot. Though Señora Sanchez was protected by the authorities it was better not to leave a car outside in case an inquisitive policeman noted the number. Such an addition to one’s police file might one day prove undesirable.

He had been informed of the kidnapping and he was reported to have said, ‘That is no concern of mine. I am here for the fishing.’ The kidnappers had given the Paraguayan government until Sunday midnight to agree to their terms by an announcement on the radio. When that time expired they would be forced to execute their prisoner."|"The Honorary Consul"|"Graham Greene"

Perhaps if he discovered the nature of the difference, the obsession would be killed like a trauma at the end of analysis. He would have strangled the obsession as her sister had strangled her child.

The man León turned on a pocket radio at noon, but the battery failed in the middle of some Guaraní music and he had no spares. The young man with a beard whom León called Aquino went into town to buy more batteries. He was a long time gone. A woman came in from the market with food and cooked their lunch, a vegetable soup with a few scraps of meat. She made a great show too of cleaning the hut, raising the dust in one part so that it settled in another. She had a lot of untidy black hair and a wart on her face and she treated León with a mixture of possessiveness and servility. He called her Marta."|"The Honorary Consul"|"Graham Greene"

A smuggler was shot yesterday on the river, so we have been able to close his file. Somebody has stolen a hundred thousand pesos from a bedroom in the Nacional – but we have our eyes on the man. And early this morning there was a small bomb – for we are a very quiet province – and it was set to go off at midnight when the church was empty. If it had exploded, though, it might have destroyed the miraculous cross – and that would have been real news in El Litoral, even if not in the Nación. Perhaps it may become news in any case. There are rumours already that Our Lady herself got down off her altar and defused the bomb with her own hands and the Archbishop has visited the scene. You know the cross was first saved – years before Buenos Aires even existed – when lightning killed the Indians who were going to burn it.’ The door of the lavatory opened. ‘You know my colleague Captain Velardo, doctor? I was telling the doctor about our new miracle, Rubén.’"|"The Honorary Consul"|"Graham Greene"
"ap > 09:00"|"a few minutes past nine"|"HAVING sent out invitations by telephone from the airport Doctor Plarr waited for his two guests on the terrace of the Nacional. On a sheet of hotel notepaper he drafted a careful letter which he believed the Ambassador would have found sober and convincing. The city was beginning to wake up for the evening hours after the long siesta of the afternoon. A chain of cars drove by along the riverside. The white naked statue in the belvedere shone under the lamplight, and the Coca-Cola sign glowed in scarlet letters like the shrine of a saint. Through the darkness the ferry boat was screaming a warning from the Chaco shore. It was a few minutes past nine – far too early for most people to dine – and Doctor Plarr was alone on the terrace except for Doctor Benevento and his wife. Doctor Benevento sat taking little sips at an apéritif, as though he were suspiciously testing the tonic of a rival, while his wife, a severe and middle-aged woman who wore a large gold cross like some order of distinction, ostentatiously took nothing and watched the disappearance of her husband’s apéritif with a false air of patience. It was a Thursday, Doctor Plarr remembered, and perhaps Doctor Benevento had come straight to the hotel from his weekly inspection of Mother Sanchez’s girls. The two doctors ignored each other: after all the years which had passed since he arrived from Buenos Aires Doctor Plarr was still in the eyes of Doctor Benevento a foreign interloper."|"The Honorary Consul"|"Graham Greene"
"ap > 10:00"|"past ten o’clock"|"It was past ten o’clock and guests were beginning to drift across the terrace for dinner. They moved along separate routes, passing on either side of Doctor Plarr’s table, like migrating tribes passing a rock in the desert, and they carried their children with them. A baby, which might have been an idol of wax, sat upright in a pram; a pale-faced child of three staggered from fatigue across the marble desert dressed in a blue party dress, her little ears pierced for gold rings; a boy of six drummed his way, yawning at every step, along the terrace wall. One had the impression that they had crossed a whole continent to arrive here. No doubt at dawn, the grazing exhausted, they would pack up and move to another camping ground. Doctor Plarr said impatiently, ‘Give me back my letter. I want to send it as it is.’"|"The Honorary Consul"|"Graham Greene"
00:00|midnight|"The small patch of marble floor on which he stood seemed like the edge of an abyss; he could not move one step in either direction without falling deeper into the darkness of involvement or guilt. He stood and listened to the silence – in the flat where Clara lay, in the midnight street outside where a police car would now be moving home, in the barrio popular where something must have happened among the huts of mud and tin. Silence, like a thin republic where his father was lying dead in the deepest silence of all – ‘He was too old and slow. He couldn’t make it and they abandoned him.’ He felt giddy on his ledge of marble parquet. He couldn’t stand motionless for ever. Again the telephone rang and he moved back into his office."|"The Honorary Consul"|"Graham Greene"

The kidnapping had already ceased to interest the Argentinian public. There were other more exciting events which clamoured for attention. A man had killed the lover of his wife (in a fight with knives of course) – that was a story which never lost appeal to a Latin-American; the usual flying saucers had been reported from the south, there had been an army coup in Bolivia, and there was a detailed account of the activities of the Argentina football team in Europe (someone had cut up the referee).

"ap > 09:00"|"JUST after nine o’clock"|"JUST after nine o’clock on Friday morning a helicopter came flying low down over the barrio. It went back and forth in regular lines, like a pencil along a ruler, up and down every muddy track, just above the trees, tireless and probing. Doctor Plarr was reminded of the way his own fingers had to make tracks sometimes along a patient’s body, seeking the exact spot of pain."|"The Honorary Consul"|"Graham Greene"

12:00|midday|"ON Saturday at midday the news came for which they had been waiting so long, but they had to listen patiently until the end of the bulletin. It was the policy of all the governments concerned to play down the importance of the Fortnum affair. Buenos Aires quoted moderate expressions of British opinion. The Times of London for instance had stated that an Argentinian novelist (whose name was not given) had offered himself in exchange for the Consul, and a BBC broadcast put the affair, as the Argentinian commentator remarked, in proper perspective. A Junior Minister had referred to the matter briefly when questioned in a television discussion on political violence occasioned by the tragic death of more than a hundred and sixty BOAC passengers. ‘I know no more about this affair in Argentina than any of our listeners. I do not have time to read many novels, but before I came out this evening I did ask my wife’s bookseller about Mr Savindra, and I’m afraid he was no better informed than me.’ The Minister added, ‘Much as I sympathize with Mr Fortnum, I want to emphasize that we cannot treat a kidnapping like this as an attack on the British diplomatic service with all that would imply. Mr Fortnum has never at any time been a member of the diplomatic service. He was born in Argentina, and so far as I know he has not even visited this country. When the unfortunate affair occurred we were about to terminate his engagement as Honorary Consul since he had passed the normal age for retirement and there was really no occasion to replace him as the number of British residents in that particular province has been very much reduced in the last ten years. I am sure you are aware that this Government is making every effort to economize in the Foreign Service.’"|"The Honorary Consul"|"Graham Greene"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"Doctor Plarr visited his patient twice and found him sleeping on both occasions. He regarded with resentment the peaceful expression on the condemned man’s face. He was even smiling a little – perhaps he was dreaming of Clara or the child, or perhaps only of the ‘proper measure’. Doctor Plarr wondered what the years ahead might be like – in the unlikely event of there being any years ahead. He was not worried about Clara: that affair – if you could call it an affair – would have been finished soon in any case. It was the child’s image, as he grew up under Charley Fortnum’s care, which worried him. For no rational reason he pictured the child as a boy, a boy who resembled two early photographs of himself, one taken at four years and one at eight. His mother preserved them still in the overcrowded apartment, the silver frames tarnished from lack of care, among the china cockatoos and the junk of antique shops."|"The Honorary Consul"|"Graham Greene"
00:00|midnight|"There was nothing to do but talk, talk about anything under the sun except about Sunday midnight."|"The Honorary Consul"|"Graham Greene"
"ap < 08:00"|"Before eight"|"‘You have no longer any hope of escape,’ the voice continued slowly and ponderously, in an interval of static, speaking with extreme clarity like a teacher explaining a problem of mathematics to a class of children; Doctor Plarr recognized the voice of Colonel Perez. ‘We know exactly where you are. You are surrounded by men from the 9th Brigade. Before eight tomorrow morning you must send the British Consul out of the hut. He must come alone and walk unmolested into the cover of the trees. Five minutes afterwards you must come out yourselves, one by one with arms raised over the head. The Governor guarantees that your lives will be spared and you will not be returned to Paraguay. Do not attempt to escape. If any man leaves the hut before the Consul has been delivered unharmed he will be shot down. No white flag will be respected. You are completely surrounded. I warn you that if any harm . . .’ After that the static whined and shrieked through his words, making them unintelligible."|"The Honorary Consul"|"Graham Greene"

‘And you, Marta?’"|"The Honorary Consul"|"Graham Greene"
08:00|"08.00 hours"|"A loudspeaker – so close that it must have been set up among the trees outside – spoke to them, again in the voice of Perez. ‘The United States Government and the British Government have refused to intervene. If you have been listening to your radio you will know I am telling you the truth. Your blackmail has failed. You have nothing to gain by holding the Consul any longer. Send him out of the hut before 08.00 hours if you wish to save your own lives.’"|"The Honorary Consul"|"Graham Greene"
