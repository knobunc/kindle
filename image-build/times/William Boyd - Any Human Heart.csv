My mother beckoned me over (actually, Mother was looking her best, I now think, the red dress suited her new, lustrous hair). As I reached her, she took my hand, drawing me to her and whispering in my ear, ‘Querido, have you been making love to your cousin?’ How does she know these things?

Peter, who has not seen the toothsome Tess for weeks, has finally managed to construct a means of communication. They leave notes for each other behind a loose brick of an old gatepost. He is trying to arrange a rendezvous as far away from Abbey as possible and together we have come up with the idea that it might be best achieved during the night exercise which, according to Tozer, is due to take place in the woodland around Ringford. Ben quizzed a school gardener who lived in Heringham and he said there was a nice pub in Ringford called the Lamb and Flag. Peter left a note in the gatepost urging Tess to meet him in the Lamb and Flag at 9.30 p.m. on the 4th of June.

As soon as we were lost to sight we circled round and rejoined the branch line – a quarter of a mile or so down from the signal box – and tramped on down it until we could see the church spire of Ringford in the distance. Our plan – to explain our non-appearance in the night exercise, or if we were discovered – was to say we had got lost in the woods and had decided to rejoin the main unit, only to become further lost as night closed in. We hid our rifles in a bramble bush and unwound our puttees. We had our own shirts on under our tunics and our own ties in our kitbags. We looked a little odd, I had to admit: not quite soldiers but not quite bona fide civilians either. But Ben said no publican was going to query our outfits: we certainly didn’t look like schoolboys, and we were hardly deserters. We made Peter discard his tunic just to differentiate ourselves somewhat, then pushed on through a hedge and on to a lane that led into Ringford.

To Byrne & Milner14 for the final fitting of my dress suit. Seamus Byrne’s flattery just fails to convince, as always: ‘Now that is what I call a perfect fit, Mr Mountstuart.’ Still, I’ve used the visits to be measured for four more suits – a dark charcoal pinstripe, single breasted; a midnight blue, double breasted; a pea-green tweed, three-piece, and a lightweight Prince of Wales check. £300 all in. Lunch with Peter at the Ivy. Tess and the baby15 live in a cottage outside Henley and Peter commutes to town, staying up whenever he’s on the night shift. I offered him my sofa at Glebe but he has an arrangement with a bed & breakfast near Paddington Station. He was full of the joys of married life but for me the pleasure was to note that our old friendship had picked up again quite naturally with no residual reserve or bad feeling. It’s true: lives do drift apart for no obvious reason. We’re all busy people, we can’t spend our time simply trying to stay in touch. The test of a friendship is if it can weather these inevitable gaps. He’s full of curiosity about Lottie – ‘An earl’s daughter! My God, moving up in the world, Logan.’ – and Tess, he says, is looking forward to the wedding enormously. Peter has to write a third leader on Mosley and the BUF.16 I told him I’d met Mosley and had been impressed with the man – mind you, he’d been a Labour politician then. Why do politicians love uniforms? – all these funny little men in Europe in their pantomime costumes. Still, a fair amount of what Mosley says, in the current climate, can’t be dismissed as fanaticism or bombast – he’s no Mussolini. Peter is not convinced."|"Any Human Heart"|"William Boyd"

Whether a palace or a mud hut, it is palpable and unmistakable – a presence, a kind of order quite different from something that even the tidiest man living alone produces. They had been expecting something basic and functional – which is how I described Draycott Avenue to anyone who was curious – one level above a monk’s cell. Our dark, warm, cherished, lived-in few rooms were eloquent testimony to the kind of secret life I lived in London – my books, my paintings, the odd, interesting bits of furniture. Lottie became very quiet while Sally’s camouflaging prattle intensified, with her finally blurting out, ‘Do you know, darling, if we run we’ll make the 5 o’clock.’ It was the perfect exit line and allowed us all to bustle downstairs.

The guards seemed to change constantly and always attempted to speak to me in bad Spanish – ‘Hola’, ‘Vamos’, ‘Está bien?’ – no matter in what language I addressed them – and they always called me Peredes."|"Any Human Heart"|"William Boyd"
"~ 02:00"|"about two in the morning"|"August. At about two in the morning I was wakened by the rise and fall of a siren and I thought at once it was an air raid. Two guards came in and ordered me to get dressed. I was hurried downstairs and pushed through the front door and on to the gravel. Three other prisoners were there: we blinked and stared at each other like Victorian explorers meeting in the jungles of Africa, shy and tongue-tied. Others joined us, fetched out from the various floors of the big house: eleven in all, identically dressed in grey tunic, black trousers and heavy clogs. The alarm was genuine – there was a fire in the kitchen. Some sort of fire appliance was driven round the back of the villa and we could hear shouts and breaking glass. It was the most excitement we’d had in months and the guards were restive and curious. While they were distracted by the fuss, I turned to the man next to me and said, in English, ‘What’s your name?’ ‘Nicht verstehen,’ he whispered, ‘Deutsche.’ So this was the enemy. ‘Englander,’ I said. He looked at me, baffled, then pointed at another man: ‘Italiano,’ he said. A guard shouted to silence us. Who are we, I thought? What are we doing here in this villa by Lake Lucerne so strictly and solicitously guarded? What have we done?"|"Any Human Heart"|"William Boyd"
00:00|midnight|"We parted at midnight and walked homeward, Ben, Sandrine, Marius and I – relieved to be out of the Picassian pressure-cooker. Ben cock-a-hoop: Picasso has agreed to sell him directly (not through Kahnweiler [his usual dealer]) two pictures for his New York show. He put his arm round my shoulder: just keep talking about Spain, he said. Marius was unable to understand how someone as young and pretty as Françoise wanted to be with a man forty years older than her. We all laughed. As we gently teased Marius for his naivety, I felt simultaneously the ineffable sadness of my loss and also a growing comfort, a warmth – a realization that these old friends of mine, the Leepings, were in a way my true family, that my life was and would always be bound up with theirs, whatever happened."|"Any Human Heart"|"William Boyd"
00:00|midnight|"Gloria was drinking gin and had her drink topped up twice as we chatted. At one stage she leant into me, her pushed-up breasts flattening against my arm. ‘Peter envies you,’ she said. I asked what on earth for? Peter was the paradigm of the successful novelist – why should he envy me? ‘He envies you your glamorous war,’ she said. ‘He can’t buy that. He can buy everything else, but he can’t buy that, and he envies you.’ There was pure glee in her chuckle. Jesus Christ, I thought. Then she leant into me once more, before wandering off to look for Peter, leaving me with an unequivocal erection. At midnight, I told myself that, even if I wasn’t happy, my load of unhappiness was maybe beginning to diminish, ever so slightly."|"Any Human Heart"|"William Boyd"
15:00|"3.00 this afternoon"|"Marius turned up at 3.00 this afternoon, having bought four worthless canvases (smears and slashes in primary colours) from some charlatan called Hughes Delahay at $500 a piece. For that amount of money I could have bought a Pollock – if I’d wanted. I remonstrated, gently – our float is dropping rapidly and I haven’t bought a thing – pointing out that in a month or two we wouldn’t be able to give away a Delahay. Logan, he said, patronizingly, you’re too old-world, like Papa, you’ve got to move fast or you won’t ever fit in here in this city. I managed to keep my temper. Ironic comment, given my rhapsody above. I’d better let Ben know what’s going on."|"Any Human Heart"|"William Boyd"

I gave a small party at the gallery for the launch of my book. BD & W invited a few writers and critics along. I asked Greenberg and Frank O’Hara2 and some other literary acquaintances to leaven the art world. I felt oddly proud to see my book stacked up on a central table. Villa has a very simple jacket here: lower case sans serif letters in midnight blue on a coarse oatmeal ground – very Bauhaus, somehow. Frank was taken with the title. ‘The Villa by the Lake. Like it,’ he said. ‘Very simple but with a kind of ring, a resonance to it. Could be a painting by Klee.’ Actually I’m not sure it could, but it was nice of him to make the association. He had another writer friend with him, Herman Keller, who looks like a weightlifter (broad shoulders, thick neck, cropped hair) but in fact teaches literature at Princeton. I thought he might be one of Frank’s ‘fag’ friends, but someone told me he wasn’t. Frank likes to make plays for heterosexual men, apparently."|"Any Human Heart"|"William Boyd"

I smiled politely, nodded hello and tried to pass by but he grabbed my arm. He called me a ‘petit connard’ and a ‘goddam creep’ who was trying to come between him and his father. I said that if anything was going to come between a son and his father, then the son stealing $30,000 from his father might explain it. He took a swing at me and missed. I pushed him away. I’m fifty years old and can’t be brawling with young men in the streets of New York any more. ‘I’m gonna get you, you fucking prick!’ he yelled at me. ‘Yeah, yeah, yeah,’ I said and wandered off.

We went into the studio and I watched him work for an hour or so. He was painting a triptych and the final panel was primed and ready on the big easel.

We came through Warri and skirted Port Harcourt. A lot of military traffic on the road and also the bizarre sight of an ocean-going yacht on board a tank transporter – some brigadier’s loot, I suspect, going back to the marina at Lagos. Following Simeon’s directions we left the main road at Elele and headed vaguely eastwards. At Benin we had been told that Ikot-Ekpene had been recaptured by the Biafrans and that the front was now on the Aba-Owerri road. Simeon said that if we could reach Aba he would make his own way to the village by bush path. We had one tricky experience at a lonely roadblock where young soldiers, beer heavy on their breath, ordered us out of the car, waving their guns theatrically. I gave them some money and cigarettes, which calmed them down, and they told us that the other journalists were at the Roundabout Hotel near a town called Manjo, just south of Aba. We arrived at the Roundabout Hotel at four in the afternoon. When I stepped out of the car I could hear the distant thud and mumble of artillery somewhere to the north. Simeon slipped off his clothes, down to a pair of shorts, and said he would leave straight away. I gave him some cash and he set off up a bush path jauntily enough, I thought. I think he was pleased to be doing something – and this was home to him, after all. I told him I’d wait for three days, if possible, then I’d have to head back."|"Any Human Heart"|"William Boyd"

He was obviously put out to see me there and immediately asked if I was working for The Times. When I said Polity, he seemed to relax – ‘Good mag,’ he said. His name is Charles Scully. We drank some beer and talked. Scully has been inside Biafra and seems to have a disciple’s reverence for Ojukwu,8 Zygmunt was more circumspect. He made the point that it’s all very well to secede but if you’re going to take 95 per cent of the nation’s oil with you there’s bound to be a fight. Scully became quite heated at this point – Nigeria was a false nation created by Victorian surveyors drawing arbitrary lines on a map; Biafra had tribal and ethnic integrity that justified its claim for independence. Here I threw in Simeon’s point about the other tribes not wanting to be the wives to the Ibo husband. This made Scully considerably more riled and he asked me, quite insultingly, just how long I’d been in Nigeria. When I said four years his belligerent tone modified somewhat – he’d been in the country for six weeks."|"Any Human Heart"|"William Boyd"

I said of course she could but warned her I was very poor, and that what comfort I could offer her would be determined by that fact. She said she had £800 in the bank and I should think of it as mine. ‘Let’s have a high old time of it, Logan,’ she said with a grin, as if we were schoolchildren planning a midnight feast. I thought that even £800 wouldn’t go very far and she must have noticed the look in my eye.

No comment was passed by the hotel staff on the sleeping arrangements: clearly quite demure by the Horizont’s standards. The girls immediately went to sleep, curled under the duvet, removing only their shoes and coats – like escapees on the run, the thought came to me.

I laid down a plastic groundsheet and hid half a bottle of brandy under a fallen tree. It’s dark by 9.30 or 10.00 at this time of the year3 and the minimal temperature is forecast to be about 8 or 9 degrees. I’ll wrap up well."|"Any Human Heart"|"William Boyd"

"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"The first night – nothing to report. In fact it was rather magical being out in the woods after midnight. It was a cool night but I stayed warm with the help of little burning sips of Cognac from time to time. I felt no tiredness: the adrenalin keeping me awake and alert. As a rudimentary weapon I had an old poker with me from the fire at home – not that I intended to use it, but it was reassuring, none the less. The woods were full of movement – crunchings, rustlings – and at one stage I was convinced there was someone walking around somewhere behind me. I was aware of a large presence parting the branches, pushing through the undergrowth, but I realized after a while it must have been a deer. Between midnight and 2 o’clock I counted seven cars and two motorbikes and the last half-hour was dead quiet. I could feel my old heart leap with excitement every time I saw the wash of lights from a car illuminate the trees. I remembered when I had felt like this before: my night drop into Switzerland in ‘44 – a few months before Benoit Verdel liberated Sainte-Sabine."|"Any Human Heart"|"William Boyd"

"> 01:00"|"just after 1 a.m."|"It happened just after 1 a.m. I was beginning to feel tired – three late nights in a row was too much for me and I felt my body stiffening up in protest. Suddenly I saw a flare of headlights from a car moving unusually slowly. Then it stopped and I heard the sound of a diesel engine idling for a few seconds and then it cut out and the lights were switched off. Soon I heard a mutter of voices and the sound of footsteps coming along the road towards the gate. It was not a dark night – there was enough moonglow to cast a faint shadow. I saw two men walking along the road, one of them carrying a bulky object in his hand. The first man took up a position of guard in the middle of the road, watching for oncoming lights, while the second approached the plaque. Too late, I realized what he was going to do, but I rose to my feet, poker in hand, and blundered out of the bushes, switching on my torch and shouting, ‘Right! I’ve got you! Stop what you’re doing! I’m calling the police!’ The one on the road began to advance on me threateningly but the man by the plaque said, ‘Stop. Leave him.’ I shone my torch in his face – I thought I recognized the voice. It was Lucien Gorce, my friend and neighbour. He had just painted a black swastika on Benoit Verdel’s memorial."|"Any Human Heart"|"William Boyd"
12:00|noon|"The pleasures of my life here are simple – simple, inexpensive and democratic. A warm hill of Marmande tomatoes on a roadside vendor’s stall. A cold beer on a pavement table of the Café de France – Marie Thérèse inside making me a sandwich au camembert. Munching the knob off a fresh baguette as I wander back from Sainte-Sabine. The farinaceous smell of the white dust raised by a breeze from the driveway. A cuckoo sounding in the perfectly silent woods beyond the meadow. The huge grey, cerise, pink, orange and washed-out blue of a sunset seen from my rear terrace. The drilling of the cicadas at noon – the soft dialling-tone of the crickets as dusk slowly gathers. A good book, a hammock and a cold, beaded bottle of blanc sec. A rough red wine and steak frites. The cool, dark, shuttered silence of my bedroom – and, as I go to sleep, the prospect that all this will be available to me again, unchanged, tomorrow."|"Any Human Heart"|"William Boyd"
