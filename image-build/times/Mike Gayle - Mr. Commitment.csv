"ap 09:00"|"Nine o’Clock"|"Whilst carefully maintaining my nonjudgmental facial expression, I studied her face again, hoping for some sign that she was winding me up—that at some point she was practically going to wet herself laughing and say, “Had you going there, didn’t I?” I waited for this moment, but of course it didn’t arrive because Mel was as serious as the Nine o’Clock News."|"Mr. Commitment"|"Mike Gayle"
"ap 11:10"|"ten past eleven"|"It was ten past eleven by the time I reached home. The flat was empty. I headed straight for the kitchen where there was a note from Dan on the fridge door saying he’d gone for a drink with someone called Natalie. I made a pint glass of Ribena and grabbed a loaf of bread from the bread bin. It was time to make toast."|"Mr. Commitment"|"Mike Gayle"
"ap 09:00"|"Nine o’Clock"|"It was late evening by the time I got back to the flat. The first thing I did was check the answerphone—no messages. The heartbreakingly pitiful message I’d left on Mel’s answerphone had obviously failed to melt her heart. My flatmate Dan was lying across the sofa silently watching the Nine o’Clock News. “All right, mate?” I asked, sitting down in an armchair in the corner of the room."|"Mr. Commitment"|"Mike Gayle"
20:23|"8:23 P.M."|"Sitting in the Haversham on Friday night, Dan and Charlie decided unanimously that the whole evening’s entertainment would be at my expense, despite my having been an engaged man for only six days. For the next few hours I was the butt of their jokes, jibes and mockery, which was actually quite reassuring in its own way—laughter was the perfect antidote to any apprehension I was feeling about marriage. The evening’s conversation went a little something like this . . .
8:23 P.M.
“What is it about weddings that women like so much?” asked Dan."|"Mr. Commitment"|"Mike Gayle"
21:28|"9:28 P.M."|"“Ahhh,” exclaimed Dan astutely, “but the wedding means she’s always got somewhere nice to wear it.”
9:28 P.M.
Charlie played question master. “Why do you think blokes are so scared of commitment?”"|"Mr. Commitment"|"Mike Gayle"
22:05|"10:05 P.M."|"“Mel’s my twenty-one,” I said, more to my pint than to my assembled friends. “She is the perfect hand.”
10:05 P.M.
It was Dan’s turn to pontificate. “Your conventional modern action hero doesn’t need a full-time woman, because they get in the way and reduce his ability to catch the bad guys and save the world from certain disaster. That’s why none of fiction’s greatest heroes are happily hitched. Discuss.”"|"Mr. Commitment"|"Mike Gayle"
23:15|"11:15 P.M."|"“You’re kidding,” said Dan, laughing. “How long’s a marriage going to last when your husband keeps getting himself into the kind of scrapes where he loses his shoes and has to run around upstate New York wearing nothing but a vest?”
11:15 P.M. (Time, ladies and gentlemen, please!)
“I’m a pretty amazing bloke,” said Dan, adopting a pompous tone of voice. “I’m a big hit with the ladies, I look the business—in short I am the bee’s knees. But”—he paused thoughtfully—“if you were to look through a selection of photographs of me when I was seventeen you’d say to yourself, ‘Why upon my life, cool Dan is in fact nothing but a geek! Look at that haircut, his dodgy Iron Maiden T-shirt, his pitiful attempt to grow a moustache!’ ”"|"Mr. Commitment"|"Mike Gayle"
23:31|"11:31 P.M."|"11:31 P.M. Inside the Archway Fish and Chip Bar across the road from the Haversham"|"Mr. Commitment"|"Mike Gayle"
02:57|"2:57 A.M."|"The phone was ringing. I looked at the glow-in-the-dark alarm clock Mel had given me for my twenty-sixth birthday, only to discover it was 2:57 A.M. I attempted to go back to sleep, but the beer, chips and curry sauce churning in my stomach, combined with the mad person at the end of the telephone who clearly refused to believe we were asleep, made resting impossible. Eyes half closed I got up and walked along the hallway, throwing a menacing squint in the direction of Dan’s bedroom as I passed. I bet he’s unplugged the answerphone so he could use the toaster in the living room again, I thought, scowling. I was right. There next to the phone was the toaster with a piece of cold toast in it. I picked up the toast, took a bite and answered the phone, still chewing."|"Mr. Commitment"|"Mike Gayle"
03:00|"three o’clock in the morning"|"“But it’s three o’clock in the morning,” I protested. “I’m knackered. I’ve only been asleep a few hours.”"|"Mr. Commitment"|"Mike Gayle"
03:45|"quarter to four in the morning"|"It was a quarter to four in the morning by the time the taxi pulled up outside Mel’s. I got out, handed the driver twenty pounds and told him to keep the change. I didn’t usually tip but I was grateful that he hadn’t made any comment on my Manchester United football shirt and paisley dressing gown. Too ill to open the door when I rang the buzzer, Mel hurled the front-door key out of the upstairs’ bedroom window and I let myself in."|"Mr. Commitment"|"Mike Gayle"
14:00|"two o’clock in the afternoon"|"Mel looked at her bedside clock. “Just coming up to two o’clock in the afternoon.” She pulled herself up close to me. “Duff,” she said quietly, “you do know I’m sorry about last night, don’t you?”"|"Mr. Commitment"|"Mike Gayle"
03:00|"three o’clock in the morning"|"“But I got you out of bed at three o’clock in the morning and dragged you halfway across London to look after me.” She sat up, pulling me up with her. “I love you, you know. Not many men would have done what you did.”"|"Mr. Commitment"|"Mike Gayle"
12:00|noon|"“Don’t you ‘oh, Mel’ me! Since Vernie’s been going on about babies morning, noon and night these past months, they’ve been on my mind. It’s not about hormones. It’s not about feeling maternal. It’s about me and what I want from life. It’s not a crime to think about the future, Duffy. I know to you it’s the biggest crime in the world, but I’ve got a news flash for you—real people think about the future every day. I’m thinking about my future and your future—our future, to be exact. I’m not talking about having them right now. I’m just talking about them, okay?”"|"Mr. Commitment"|"Mike Gayle"
06:00|"six A.M."|"“Right then.” She smiled. “I’ll be in touch.” She looked at her watch—a huge, chunky plastic affair with about eight million buttons. “It’s bedtime for me. I’m shooting a piece about urban rock climbing at six A.M. tomorrow morning.”"|"Mr. Commitment"|"Mike Gayle"
"~ 00:00"|"around midnight"|"One evening, we met up for a drink after work. She tried to kiss me and failed; then later I tried to kiss her and failed too; then some time around midnight we both tried to kiss each other and succeeded and I ended up staying the night at hers. I don’t know why I did it. I didn’t even like her. I especially don’t know why I called her the next day and left a message on her answerphone asking if she wanted to go to the cinema. Guilt, I suppose. I thought I owed her something. But whatever it was I owed her, she obviously didn’t want it because she never called back."|"Mr. Commitment"|"Mike Gayle"
07:30|"7:30 A.M."|"The alarm clock in Mel’s bedroom went off at 7:30 A.M. I took a long hard squint at it before entombing it beneath a large pile of clothes. It’s Saturday morning, I thought groggily, no one should be up this early on a Saturday. Out of the only eye I was willing to open this early in the morning, I observed an already up-and-out-of-bed Mel keenly."|"Mr. Commitment"|"Mike Gayle"
00:00|Midnight|"My rude awakening was based on the fact that it was now March and six weeks had passed since we’d become engaged. It was time for us to plan the wedding. We’d already settled on a date in October the following year and her parents’ local parish church. My only suggestion for the big day—that we have a disco for the evening do—was shot down by Mel for being “tacky above and beyond the call of duty.” I couldn’t believe it. As far as I was concerned, a wedding reception without a mobile DJ playing the Commodores’ “Three Times a Lady” and Dexy’s Midnight Runners’ “Come on Eileen” just wasn’t a wedding reception. Mel, however, wanted something more tasteful, like a string quartet or a band, and wasn’t going to budge. Thus began a minor argument which concluded in a win for her corner, when I gave up after ten minutes of going backward and forward having realized The Simpsons was on TV and I’d already missed five minutes."|"Mr. Commitment"|"Mike Gayle"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"I disappeared to the gent’s at the back of the pub and as I took a leak, checked my watch. It was eight o’clock. Thanks to our concentrated drinking efforts and the eight million packets of crisps I’d consumed as a replacement for Sunday lunch I was inebriated enough not to try and work out how long it had been since I’d last seen Mel but sober enough not to fall into the urinal."|"Mr. Commitment"|"Mike Gayle"
"ap 08:45"|"quarter to nine"|"We arranged to meet in a bar called Freud that same evening. Mel arrived at a quarter to nine—fifteen minutes late—an ideal length of time for me to reach the wet-palm stage of nervousness and for her to appear more enigmatic than I thought humanly possible. She was wearing dark blue jeans, trainers, a white T-shirt and a jacket. She’d dressed down, which was good. Dressing down called for the kind of self-confidence I admired in a woman."|"Mr. Commitment"|"Mike Gayle"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"She checked her watch. “It’s seven o’clock, Duff. I’m going to have to go.”"|"Mr. Commitment"|"Mike Gayle"
"ap 02:00"|"Two o’clock"|"Two o’clock Saturday afternoon—approximately eight days since I’d gone into mourning—I did just that. It wasn’t like I’d stopped hurting—I still felt the pain as keenly as ever—I think it was more a case that through my grieving I’d learned to live with it."|"Mr. Commitment"|"Mike Gayle"
21:00|"9 P.M."|"Dan and I met up with Charlie in the Haversham at 9 P.M., half an hour later than arranged. I could tell by the look on Charlie’s face that despite his earlier reluctance he was just as excited as me. Even Dan, whose Saturday nights had never been all that mundane, had something about him that bit sharper tonight. It was as if we’d all agreed to pretend that the last ten years hadn’t happened to us. For the next few hours we were seventeen again and up for it. It felt great. Such were our good moods that we even invited Greg, who’d dropped into the Haversham by chance, to join us. He was so enthusiastic about the idea that he took a taxi home, showered, and was back in the pub in under half an hour. All present and correct. We were ready to go."|"Mr. Commitment"|"Mike Gayle"
00:00|midnight|"By midnight we’d all run out of steam. Charlie had spent the last hour looking at his watch, moaning that he’d served his time in nightclubs and wanted to be in bed with his wife like any normal thirty-four-year-old married man. Next to him, a very disgruntled Dan sat on the arm of a sofa, occasionally sipping his beer. He’d spent most of the night scowling in the general direction of Greg, who was on the dance floor in hot pursuit of some helpless girl. The irony wasn’t lost on Dan and me that Greg—the only one of us who was engaged—was also the only one to have spoken to a member of the opposite sex all evening. Even Charlie—a married man—had had his bum pinched. So much for the superstuds of seduction."|"Mr. Commitment"|"Mike Gayle"
04:00|"4 A.M."|"Distraught beyond belief at my encounter with Mel and Rob 1, I’d made my way to the comedy club and there continued drinking beyond the point of daft smile and wobbly legs right up to “Which way is up?” At 4 A.M. I was kicked out of the club and escorted to a taxi. The driver had asked me where I wanted to go and I’d told him Muswell Hill—which was fine for the moment, but things got a bit more complicated when we reached there and I couldn’t narrow it down any further. After making him drive around the area for twenty minutes, I finally remembered where I lived. Once home, I’d headed straight to the kitchen to make toast, and somewhere in the three minutes it took for the bread to go brown I’d said to myself, “I’ll just rest my eyes for a moment,” and promptly fell asleep. Why I smelled of doner kebab chili sauce, however, I have no idea."|"Mr. Commitment"|"Mike Gayle"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"Hours later, when I’d fully recovered from my sister’s onslaught, I finally emerged from my nest and bumped into Dan in the hallway. Judging by the state of him, hair flying off at right angles to his head, nine o’clock shadow on his chin, and blood still caked around his nose, he, too, it seemed, was rising for the first time that day."|"Mr. Commitment"|"Mike Gayle"

My alarm clock went off, wrenching me from the deepest of deep slumbers into a Nurofen nightmare. When I was seventeen the effects of a big Saturday night used to be over by Sunday lunchtime at the latest. When I was twenty-five I’d be feeling nearly human by Songs of Praise. But here and now at twenty-eight, with my brain throbbing like it was going to explode, and coat the inside of my head with gray matter and memories, I began strongly to doubt whether I’d actually ever fully recover again."|"Mr. Commitment"|"Mike Gayle"
07:33|"7:33 A.M."|"The collection of motley souls who frequented the bus stop at my regular go-to-work time had disappeared, whisked away five minutes earlier by my regular bus, the 7:33 A.M. 136. In their place was a similar bunch of odd-looking strangers who appeared to be as disturbed by my appearance as I was by theirs. I could see them silently taking me in, thinking to themselves anxiously, “Who’s he? He’s not a regular! He’s not one of us!”"|"Mr. Commitment"|"Mike Gayle"

"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"I looked up and said hello. I’d actually spotted her in the corridor as soon as I’d come through the double doors of Studio 3, where the auditions had taken place, but I was trying my very best to play it cool. Even though it was five o’clock on a humid Thursday afternoon, when by rights even the most gorgeous of supermodels could be forgiven for looking a bit crumpled, Alexa looked amazing."|"Mr. Commitment"|"Mike Gayle"
"ap 03:27"|"Three hours and twenty-seven minutes"|"She looked at her watch. “Three hours and twenty-seven minutes ago. Not that I’m counting or anything. I was over a week late. I’ve been late before, but like they always say, this time I knew. I bought three tests, three different brands. Any less than three opinions isn’t enough for a woman like me.” She laughed softly, stood up and walked over to the mantelpiece and picked something up. “I thought I’d keep them as a memento.” She unwrapped a tissue and laid the three test sticks on the table one by one. “Blue. Blue. And Blue. It’s a baby all right.”"|"Mr. Commitment"|"Mike Gayle"
23:30|"11:30 P.M."|"Friday. 11:30 P.M. The flight from Paris arrived three hours late into Heathrow’s Terminal Four, which was just about typical of the entire torturous fourteen days I’d spent there. On my very first night in Paris I came up with the great idea of sleeping rough in the Gard du Nord, thus saving me the many francs I would’ve squandered on a room with such frivolities as a bed, toilet and running water. It was only when I saw the state of the premier Paris train station that I realized what a mistake I’d made. The air was thick with fumes from the trains, and even the pigeons cooing quietly in the rafters were a dirty, sootish gray. At three o’clock in the morning, which is when I arrived, the only place with a higher concentration of criminals would’ve been a prison. Within half an hour I’d been solicited by four prostitutes, offered hard drugs by a man wearing a dressing gown, and received threatening glances from a group of young men who had nothing better to do than hang around a train station at 3 A.M.

To understand what it was she was feeling. Here she was, twenty-nine, single and pregnant, with a ex-boyfriend whose track record for reliability wasn’t exactly perfect. Of course she’d be scared to rely on me; to let me back into her life when she wasn’t sure whether I had what it took to go the distance. Given my past performance, I’d failed her.

By the time we made our way back to the registry office a large group of people from the last wedding party had just exited and were milling around with the guests for Meena’s wedding. At five minutes past two everyone’s attention turned toward the driveway as a white Rolls-Royce carrying Meena and her maid of honor came to a halt. Watching her get out of the car was a totally surreal experience. I was no expert on wedding dresses, but even I could appreciate that she looked absolutely stunning. Meena’s father helped her out of the car and she held on to his arm proudly."|"Mr. Commitment"|"Mike Gayle"

03:00|"three o’clock in the morning"|"The second event to occur was the arrival of my mum at Euston station on Tuesday afternoon. One of the first things she’d said to me when Charlie and I picked her up from the station was that she was coming round to see where I lived first thing Wednesday morning. As the flat was in the worst state I’d ever seen it, I made Dan stay up with me until three o’clock in the morning so we could have it tidy for her inspection. In the process we discovered £7.86 in change down the back of the sofa, fungus the size of a small yucca plant at the side of the washing machine, and Dan’s car-boot-sale copy of ET lodged behind the sideboard."|"Mr. Commitment"|"Mike Gayle"

In my pockets were parts two and three but on the way to Clapham I had a flash of inspiration and a potential fourth part of the plan occurred to me. A quick detour via the freezer section of a nearby Safeway and my job was nearly complete. By eight o’clock we’d arrived at Mel’s flat where Julie’s role in the plan came to the fore—she handed me the spare keys she kept to the flat. I’d told her I’d be in and out in under an hour.

Dan, Charlie and I said our goodbyes to Albert and Reg and all our mates and and then grabbed a taxi home. Despite our protests, the driver insisted on keeping his car radio tuned to an easy-listening station which happened to be playing back-to-back Phil Collins. Though he clearly did not know the words, the driver insisted on singing along to “Easy Lover,” twice forcing me to correct his completely inaccurate rendition of the chorus."|"Mr. Commitment"|"Mike Gayle"

Taxi arrived at the Star of Punjab and we bid fond farewells to Harpreet, Hassan and Steve, the Star of Punjab waiters. As they waved their goodbyes, they promised faithfully that they’d come to the wedding as I’d requested. We got the taxi to drop Charlie off in Crouch End first. Vernie came out the minute we pulled up, gave Charlie her best Death Ray look and peered into my eyes. “I don’t want my brother looking haggard on his wedding photos!” she berated loudly and then handed me a Clarins bottle. “It’ll reduce puffiness around the eyes,” she added sagely."|"Mr. Commitment"|"Mike Gayle"

Dan and I arrived back at the flat. Our good moods in full swing, we decided to invite Will and Alice, the couple who lived in the flat beneath us, to the wedding in a gesture of niceness. At first they looked at us strangely, but when I eventually managed to persuade them that although I was drunk I was telling the truth, they said they’d love to come. We also considered inviting the couple who lived in the flat above us, Matt and Monica, but Dan still held a grudge against them because he was convinced it was they who had called the police round to pull the plug on our New Year’s Eve party last year.

Mammoth toast-making session. Dan and I toasted a whole loaf of Hovis just for the hell of it. Whilst opening a can of Red Stripe I had a brief tender moment with Dan. “You know, you’re all right for a northern toast-muncher,” he said, buttering a slice of toast. “And you’re not too bad yourself for a soft southern git,” I replied.

Asked Dan who the mystery guest was he was bringing to the wedding, and he refused to tell me yet again. He’d asked me a month ago if he could bring someone. I’d said yes of course, but when I asked who it was he went all furtive, so I didn’t bother asking again. Mel reckoned it was Fiona, the new girl who had just started working behind the bar in the Haversham. Charlie and Vernie were of the opinion he was bringing one of my ex-girlfriends as a surprise guest, but my money was on it being someone nobody knew—that was much more Dan’s style."|"Mr. Commitment"|"Mike Gayle"
