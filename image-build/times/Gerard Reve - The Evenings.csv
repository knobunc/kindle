"ap 05:45"|"quarter to six"|"IT WAS STILL DARK, in the early morning hours of the twenty-second of December 1946, on the second floor of the house at Schilderskade 66 in our town, when the hero of this story, Frits van Egters, awoke. He looked at the luminous dial of his watch, hanging on its nail. “A quarter to six,” he mumbled, “it’s still night.” He rubbed his face. “What a horrible dream,” he thought. “What was it again?” Gradually it came back to him. He had dreamt that the living room was full of visitors. “It’s going to be a glorious weekend,” someone said. At that same moment a man in a bowler hat walked in. No one paid him any heed and no one greeted him, but Frits eyed him closely. Suddenly the visitor fell to the floor with a thud."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 02:00"|two|"“Was that it?” he thought. “What happened after that? Nothing, I believe.” He fell asleep again. The dream went on where it had stopped. His bowler pressed down over his face, the man was now lying in a black coffin that had been placed on a low table in one corner of the room. “I don’t recognize that table,” Frits thought. “Did we borrow it from someone?” Then, peering into the coffin, he said loudly: “We’ll be stuck with this till Monday, in any event.” “I wouldn’t be so sure about that,” said a bald, red-faced man with spectacles. “Would you care to wager that I can arrange the funeral for this afternoon at two?”"|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 06:20"|"twenty minutes past six"|"Frits awoke once more. It was twenty minutes past six. “I’ve had enough sleep,” he said to himself, “that’s why I woke up so early. I still have more than an hour to go.”"|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 06:50"|"Ten to seven"|"Later he awoke, feeling anxious. “Ten to seven,” he mumbled, peering at the watch. “I always have such horrible dreams.” He rolled over and fell asleep again."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 07:35"|"seven thirty-five"|"He awakened for the fourth time, and sat up in bed. It was seven thirty-five. The bedroom was cold. He sat there for five minutes, then stood up and, turning on the light, saw the windowpanes covered in flowers of frost. He shivered as he made his way to the toilet."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"“But today’s Sunday,” he realized suddenly, “what a piece of luck.” Then he added to himself: “I’m up far too early, how stupid of me. But no, for once my day won’t be ruined by lying around till eleven.” While drying his face he started to hum, then went into his room, dressed, and combed his hair in the little mirror that hung beside the door, above one corner of the bed. “It’s ridiculously early,” he thought. “I can’t go in yet. The sliding doors are still open.”"|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 10:20"|"twenty minutes past ten"|"As they came into the living room his father leaned over to the radio, which was playing a fugue for violin and harpsichord, and turned it off. “All that nagging,” he said, “can’t we have a little peace and quiet for once?” He dropped into his chair with a faint sigh, opened the book and read on. Frits looked at the clock on the mantel. It was twenty minutes past ten. “The morning rushes by,” he thought. “But on any other Sunday I’d still be in bed, so little time’s been wasted.” He went to his bedroom, pulled one book after another from the shelf, flipped through them and put them back where they belonged. “It’s too cold in here,” he mumbled. Returning to the living room he took a newspaper from the rack and sat down by the window. Outside he saw passers-by walking quickly, their faces stern and tense. The sky was a solid grey, with a dirty, yellow tint to it. From the divan he could see the street. In the two hours that he sat there, paper in hand, without reading a word, there passed in various directions: four soldiers; two women, each with a pram; a young couple, the husband carrying a child; a boy with a girl on the back of his bicycle; and a group of children herded along by two gentlemen. He watched as the neighbour tried to lure his dog, which was refusing to enter the house, with coaxing and with threats. “I just sit here and sit here and don’t do a thing,” he thought. “The day’s half over.” It was a quarter past twelve."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 00:15"|"quarter past twelve"|"As they came into the living room his father leaned over to the radio, which was playing a fugue for violin and harpsichord, and turned it off. “All that nagging,” he said, “can’t we have a little peace and quiet for once?” He dropped into his chair with a faint sigh, opened the book and read on.

"ap 00:24"|"twelve twenty-four"|"“Lock the door behind you if you go out,” Frits echoed to himself a few times. As soon as his parents had picked their way down the stairs and he heard the street door close behind them, he turned on the radio. The announcer was reading the time: twelve twenty-four. Taking an oval, nickel-plated tobacco box from his pocket, Frits rolled a cigarette and ran through the luminescent scale of frequencies without finding anything to his liking. He turned off the set, walked down the hall to the side room, where papers and open books were strewn across the writing table, opened a wooden tobacco box and transferred a pinch to his own, which he slid into his pocket."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap < 01:00"|"almost one o’clock"|"He sighed, hung the shaving mirror back on its peg beside the kitchen window and went to the living room. It was almost one o’clock. He sat down on the divan. “We’re more than halfway,” he thought, “the afternoon started an hour ago. Valuable time, time irretrievable, have I squandered.” He turned on the radio, but even before it had warmed up he turned it off again, stood up, opened the sliding doors and entered the back room. Pushing aside the floor-length curtains, he pressed his face against the window. His forehead left a greasy spot on the pane. He pressed it to the glass once more and looked down."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 01:30"|"one thirty"|"As he entered the hallway he heard his parents on the stairs. “Have you been eating sweets again?” his mother asked as she came in. “Goodness gracious, here’s what I’ve been waiting for,” she continued, quickly draping her coat over the stand and rushing to the toilet. Breathing heavily, his father moved slowly to the living room door and opened it with a hard shove. It was one thirty."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 03:10"|"ten minutes past three"|"Frits looked at the clock. “All is lost,” he thought, “everything is ruined. It’s ten minutes past three. But the evening can still make up for a great deal.” His father was feeling around with his right hand between the divan and the wall. “What are you looking for?” Frits asked. “Mmm,” his father replied, “I’m looking for something.” “Did you drop it?” Frits asked. “My lighter,” his father replied. His mother came in. “Have you lost something?” she asked. “Yes,” his father said, “yes, I have.” “What has your father lost?” she asked Frits. “The lighter,” he replied, “it rolled back behind there.”"|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 03:48"|"twelve minutes to four"|"Seating himself before the window, Frits watched the ducks waddling across the ice on the canal. He leafed through a railway timetable he’d found on the mantel. His mother sat beside the fire, knitting something in white wool. “Needles ticking like a fast clock,” he thought. Forty-five minutes passed in this way. He moved to another chair, beside the divan, in front of the radio, and looked at his father. “He’s asleep,” he said to himself, and turned on the set. Suddenly the kettle began singing in the kitchen. “Make that noise stop,” he thought, “for God’s sake, make it stop.” His mother hurried into the kitchen; a moment later the whistling stopped. She came back with tea. “And now, dear listeners, ‘La Favorite’ by Couperin,” the announcer said. When the music had begun, his mother said: “That’s not a violin, is it? But it’s not a piano either. It must be a harpsichord. Is that a harpsichord?” “A glorious instrument, isn’t it?” Frits said. “I forgot to turn off the gas,” she said quite suddenly. “Would you do it for me?” He went to the kitchen and turned off the burner. When he came back, the radio was silent. His father was sitting half-upright, leaning on one elbow. The clock said twelve minutes to four."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 09:15"|"Nine fifteen"|"Once they were back in his room, Louis lowered the bed. “I’m going to grab some sleep,” he said. He undressed and climbed into bed in his underwear. Frits picked up a green vase from the windowsill, held the opening to his ear, ticked his nails against the glazing and sat down. He looked at his watch. Nine fifteen. “The evening is half-finished,” he thought."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 01:30"|"one thirty"|"Then he was standing in front of the third. “He’s the size of a child of eight or nine,” he thought, “but why does his head look so horrible?” The head was almost as big as the torso, and perfectly flat on top. It was white as well, made of the same chalk-like substance. “That neck, terrible,” Frits thought. The head began rocking back and forth on a neck thin as the hose of a vacuum cleaner. The eyes, thick and bulging, moved independently of each other in separate directions. When Frits held out his hand, the creature raised its right arm. It did not end in a hand, but in a black pincer. “Help,” Frits thought, “where can I find help? What must I do?” He awoke in a sweat. “Did I hear something go bump?” he thought. “No, it’s nothing,” he said to himself. He arose and went to the kitchen for water. It was one thirty. He remained standing for a moment, listening to the silence, then crawled quickly under the covers. A few moments later he was asleep once more."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
16:30|"FOUR THIRTY in the afternoon"|"AT FOUR THIRTY in the afternoon of the next day, he cycled home from the office where he worked. The weather had taken a turn for the worse: banks of cloud crossed the sky at a steady pace; a few drops of rain were falling; a moderate, mild wind blew from the south. Head tilted slightly to one side, he cycled slowly through the heavy traffic."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 06:15"|"quarter past six"|"When the table was set, his mother came in with a platter of cod. “There might still be a bone in it here and there,” she said, “but I got most of them out.” There were potatoes, grated raw celery root, boiled endives and pink custard. After dinner Frits washed his hands and face and ate a bit of toothpaste. “The proven remedy for dried cod,” he mumbled. It was a quarter past six."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 10:30"|"ten thirty"|"“Then I’ll be sure to wrap a scarf around my head,” she said, “and if it’s too cold for me, if it makes my head hurt, we’ll come back. We may be back by ten thirty, eleven o’clock.” His father fetched the coats."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"“Then I’ll be sure to wrap a scarf around my head,” she said, “and if it’s too cold for me, if it makes my head hurt, we’ll come back. We may be back by ten thirty, eleven o’clock.” His father fetched the coats."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 08:30"|"eight thirty"|"“At your service,” Frits replied, “that was me, indeed. But that was a different jam jar. It was around the same time. I was keeping freshwater mussels in a jar, on a bed of cotton wool and dried burdock. On a water lily stem. That jar I threw at the head of Eli Hogeweg. When you had visitors in the evening, you would torment me in my bed. Because I was already in bed by eight thirty. You would make the bed rock back and forth. You and Eli did that and I took the jar of mussels and threw it past Eli’s head, against the wall. It was thrown past his head on purpose, it was meant to go past, but still, he was startled beyond measure. He thought I had been aiming for him. But that was absolutely not the case.”"|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 09:30"|"nine thirty"|"He saw Joop and Ina coming down the stairs with their coats on, and stopped them. “Are you two leaving already?” he asked. “It’s only nine thirty.” “Yes,” Joop answered with a smile, “otherwise we won’t get to bed on time.” “Before you know it, you’ll be going to bed at eight,” Frits said. “It only gets worse when you give in to it.” “I need my ten hours of sleep,” Joop said, “here’s the programme.” They walked on and left the building."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"

"ap 09:50"|"ten minutes to ten"|"Intermission was over. He took the same seat and looked around as the auditorium filled. The programme resumed with a short concert in three parts. When that was over, it was ten minutes to ten. The next number was Schubert’s Impromptu. The fragile, plangent music got off to a slow start."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
12:00|NOON|"TUESDAY AT NOON, during the three quarters of an hour between morning and afternoon shifts, he left the office building, hurried down a few alleyways and, arriving at a large square, found the entrance to the warehouse known as “The Hornet’s Nest”. He had the lift take him to the second floor, sauntered through the book section, descended one floor and then climbed back up again. In the objets d’art department, he picked up a metal beaker. “This is not silver,” he thought, “but some cheap, stainless metal. Perhaps even copper with a coating of chrome.” He turned it over, the price was on the bottom: eighteen guilders and seventy-five cents. He viewed the handle. “This is clumsily tin-plated iron, simply soldered on,” he thought. When a salesgirl approached he returned the beaker to its spot and walked on."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 01:40"|"one forty"|"He had ten minutes left. He ambled his way along a canal, entered a grubby street, turned into a sandwich shop and said to the assistant, who was standing before the display: “I’ll have three chocolate bars.” “The sixty-cent ones or the forty-cent ones?” the man asked. “Two sixties and one forty,” said Frits. The man looked around cautiously, opened a tin, took out what he had asked for and dropped them into Frits’s case."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 05:30"|"five thirty"|"Shortly afterwards, at five thirty, his mother came home and put their dinner on the stove. “God only knows where that man has got to,” she said to Frits. “He went into town at nine thirty this morning without saying a word.” “He will show up,” said Frits, “let’s not bother about him and just eat at the usual time.”"|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
09:30|"nine thirty this morning"|"Shortly afterwards, at five thirty, his mother came home and put their dinner on the stove. “God only knows where that man has got to,” she said to Frits. “He went into town at nine thirty this morning without saying a word.” “He will show up,” said Frits, “let’s not bother about him and just eat at the usual time.”"|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"At six o’clock his mother put dinner on the table. His father arrived in the nick of time. They ate pea soup, meat, potatoes and kohlrabi. Just as they had all filled their plates, the lights went out. “Where are the matches?” his mother asked. “I have matches,” said his father, and lit one. He remained seated, staring at the flame, and when it was burned out he placed the matchstick on the edge of his plate. It was dark again. “If you keep sitting there like that, the light will come on quickly enough,” Frits’s mother said. “The pixies will see to that.” “What do I have to do?” his father asked, rising from his chair. “Give me a token.” “Not a gas token, it’s not a gas lamp,” she said. “You need an electricity token, a guilder.” Turning her chair around she took, by the light of his father’s second match, a large, shiny token from a box atop the sideboard and handed it to him. When the second match went out, his father, picking his way in utter darkness, stumbled into the hallway. They heard him entering the side room, but no further sound reached them. Frits kept his eyes closed and clasped his hands between his legs."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 07:45"|"quarter to eight"|"He fell silent and glanced at his watch. It was a quarter to eight. He rubbed his hands together and shuffled his feet. “Still, I believe you’re feeling a bit cold,” the lady said. “Is it cold in here?” asked Joosje. “No, I don’t think so,” he said, “it is only my feet. My shoes have rubber soles.” “Are rubber soles that cold then?” the old woman asked. “They are when you have sweaty feet,” Frits said, “then you have to place your shoes behind the stove each night and hang your socks over the pipe. In fact, you need to wash your feet every night too, but that is so much work. In the summer, it’s even worse. Then you absolutely have to wash them, otherwise the smell is unbearable. For months, I sprinkled steatite powder on my feet in the morning; it helps a bit, yes, it does help.” “Hush,” Joosje said, “I hear little Hans. No, it’s nothing, I think.”"|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 08:15"|"quarter past eight"|"“Yes,” Frits said, “we would be better off if we lived according to a natural diet. But it is also quite a chore to gather that kind of food and prepare it. It makes more sense to eat the way everyone else does. But that a vegetarian diet is healthier, I am firmly convinced of that.” He looked at his watch, which showed a quarter past eight. “Jesus, how am I going to get out of here?” he thought, breathing deeply without making a sound. “It is a fact that eating too much, eating late at night and eating a great deal of meat is harmful,” he said. “Oh, is that really so?” Joosje asked."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 08:50"|"ten minutes to nine"|"The doorbell rang. “Perhaps you’d better answer that yourself,” Frits said. “You’ll know who it is, whether they should be given the brush-off or not.” Joosje handed the little one to Auntie Stien and went to the door. A few moments later she came back with a woman who looked very much like her. The woman shook Frits’s hand hurriedly, and clamped Hans’s little hand in her plump fist. “It’s your birthday! Yes, it is! Did you know that!” she said. Then, after taking a seat, she began searching through her bag. It was, Frits noted, ten minutes to nine. He looked at the ceiling, which was covered in old, shabby ornamental leafwork."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 09:40"|"twenty minutes to ten"|"She left, and a silence descended for a time. “It is now twenty minutes to ten,” Frits thought, “if one subtracts the minutes by which my watch is running fast.”"|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 03:30"|"three thirty"|"“They do,” Jaap said, “but it’s a normal doctor with a practice of his own. All you have to do is count the hours: first he has his charity patients in the morning. Then he makes his neighbourhood rounds. When he’s done with that he eats lunch at home and then goes in to see his private patients. Which means he can get here no earlier than three thirty. At three o’clock I climb into bed and read something pleasant. At three thirty, when I hear a car door slam, I know what that means. By the time he comes in I’m asleep, and Joosje wakes me.” “And what has he said so far?” “He’s only been here once,” Jaap said, “so what could he say? You can be as healthy as anything, but if you say ‘I feel terrible’ and you’re lying in bed, what can a doctor like that say but: see how you feel in three days’ time. Am I right?” He leaned back and ran both hands simultaneously over his hair."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"

"ap < 10:00"|"nearly ten o’clock"|"“To be frank,” Jaap replied, “when I climb the stairs, it goes ‘hee hee hee!’ down here.” He pointed to his left breast and made a hoarse, squeaking sound. “When that happens you do not hear it, but I do.” “Isn’t that something like high blood pressure?” Frits asked. “No,” Jaap said, “that is what you have. My blood pressure is too low.” “What exactly are the symptoms of excessively high blood pressure?” Frits asked. Looking at his watch he saw that it was nearly ten o’clock; he stood up and began pacing back and forth."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"

Pulling up both shirt and singlet, he looked at his belly, a crease in which was formed by his seated position, and poked the little finger of his right hand into the navel. He sniffed at the finger and wiped it on his handkerchief."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"

When these were over, the announcer said: “Until a quarter to twelve you will hear The Luna Ensemble.” Quiet, slow waltz music began. He turned off the set, closed part way the vent at the bottom of the stove and stretched. “I’ll go out for a little walk,” he said."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"Close to Frits’s house they bade each other farewell with a wave of the hand. Frits closed the door to the hallway and bolted it, added coal to the stove and sat down by the window. He kept getting up and walking to the kitchen for a drink of water, then sitting down, looking out of the window and getting up for a drink again. “The sun has lost a good deal of its strength already,” he thought. It was two o’clock."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 03:45"|"quarter to four"|"He rolled a cigarette and, unable to locate his lighter, lit it with a match, then started a fire in the heavy glass ashtray. He added matches, wads of paper and fallen tulip petals to the blaze, until the smoke rolled through the room and the flame was as high as his hand. With a rapid movement he placed the hot ashtray on the stove, waited until all the combustibles had been consumed, then put an end to the smoke by laying a book atop the ashtray. “That is that,” he said, opening a window. The smoke rose quickly up the wall; he watched the trails of vapour and ash as they went. After closing the window, he went into his room and remained standing before the bookcase. “Today would be an excellent opportunity to arrange things in here,” he thought. Until a quarter to four he remained seated on the bed, shivering and leafing through book after book."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 06:45"|"quarter to seven"|"When he returned to the living room, a woman was speaking on the radio. He ran through the frequencies, then switched back and forth only between the short and long waves, slapped the side of the set and turned it off.

"ap 08:45"|"quarter to nine"|"“God,” Viktor said, breathless with laughter, “you’re on a roll tonight.” “Shall I stop?” Frits asked. The little clock on the desk said a quarter to nine. “You’re slow, did you know that?” Frits asked. “It’s actually nine o’clock.” “Yes, I know,” Viktor said. “Why isn’t there a Christmas tree in the house?” asked Frits. “I thought about having one at first,” Viktor answered, “but then you need candles and all that other rubbish. There’s one at my parents’ house in Haarlem, I was there yesterday and the day before. Herman and Lidia thought about it too, but the baby is still too little to appreciate it and everything is still so hard to get. So finally they didn’t do it.”"|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"

He picked it up and petted it and said: You’re a lovely little devil. And then, doctor, he said, then I knew that I had found it. Yes, the doctor said, but I have spoken to any number of people who have found it, and they had to take a rest for a long, long time. You need to take a rest as well. Come back on Thursday—that’s right, I think it was a Thursday—at one thirty.” “Wonderful,” Frits said. “Just listen to that pounding up there.”"|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"

One o’clock is the golden mean. I will return at the golden mean. He talked to the doctor till he turned blue, but the doctor couldn’t make head or tail of it. A few days later, Hagelman’s wife calls the doctor: Doctor, my husband is in such a bad way, I’m afraid something terrible will happen. The doctor goes there and sees the man—this was in the middle of the night—with a bucket, tossing water on the children in their bedroom. They needed to be baptized, he said.

It’s ten past ten.” “No,” Viktor said when they had arrived in the hall, “we’ll have a bite to eat.” Going to his room, he made a few cheese sandwiches. Frits ate two of them, pacing back and forth with his coat on. “What are you reading these days?” he asked, stopping by the writing table and picking up a little book with a grey cloth cover. “That’s one you should really read,” Viktor replied, “you would definitely enjoy it.”"|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"

He found himself once more in Lidia and Herman’s big room. Lidia had laid her left leg over an armrest, so that her thigh was exposed. As he looked at it the skin grew drab and chapped, and blue veins arose all over it."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"

"ap 04:20"|"twenty past four"|"At twenty past four he packed his briefcase, hung his coat over the back of his chair and waited for five minutes. Then he arranged everything on his desk in careful order, put on his coat and shuffled quietly out of the door. In the corridor he picked up the pace, but without stepping loudly, and so arrived in the foyer, where with a push of a button he summoned the lift and made his descent. As he left the building he began to hum. There was barely a breath of wind. He cycled past the cinema to pick up the tickets, took an easterly detour on the way home and, at the bridge, rang the bell of the house with two towers."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 09:15"|"quarter past nine"|"“I have seats for a quarter past nine at The Lantern,” Frits said, “and pricey, it cost me a bundle. You’re coming along, right?” Viktor turned up the collar of his jacket. “Well,” he said, “I—” “You stand there like an old woman with an ingrown toenail,” said Frits, “who won’t answer the door because she’s too afraid of catching a cold.”"|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 05:10"|"ten past five"|"He sat down by the radio, put his hand out to it, but withdrew it again. He went to hang his coat in the hallway. “Has mother gone out?” he asked once he had returned. “She’s doing a little shopping,” his father replied. The clock said ten past five. “Can you believe this weather?” Frits asked, peering up at the sky. “I’d say snow is on its way,” said his father."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 07:05"|"Five past seven"|"When he was seated by the fire again, he smelled his hands. “We are imperfect creatures,” he said to himself, “I should have rinsed them afterwards.” “The smell of my fingers, of the dishcloth, is nothing,” he thought. “A person’s breath is worse. The odour of spent ether expelled regularly by the lungs. That was well put. You have different varieties.” He used his little finger to root behind his molars. “You have,” he thought, “breath like the odour of mouldy old overcoats that have been cooked in vinegar. Assuredly so. Then the breath of someone who has eaten too many hard-boiled eggs. But the worst is the smell of someone who has been fasting for a day. That is like spoiled milk or like the bark of a tree that has lain rotting in the water. Indeed. Five past seven.”"|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap < 08:00"|"almost eight o’clock"|"“It’s already almost eight o’clock,” Frits thought. “Viktor will be popping by.” “Did you see the announcement, Frits,” his mother asked, “about the death of the Everts’ baby?” “No,” Frits said, “it had been taken to the hospital, if I’m not mistaken. How old was it?” “Four months,” his mother said. “Terrible, isn’t it?” “Oh,” Frits said, “I’m not so sure. Perhaps it would have gone soft in the head, or developed a propensity to scabies. No use to anyone. Good riddance to bad rubbish.” “You’re mad,” she said. “All appearances to the contrary,” Frits said, “you are wrong about that.” “What is it now?” his father asked. “Oh, he says that it’s all just as well that the Everts’ child is dead,” said his mother. “No,” Frits said, “that’s not what I’m saying at all.” “Don’t pay him any mind,” his father said, “he’s only blathering.”"|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"

"ap 01:55"|"One fifty-five"|"“My,” Joosje said, “does it annoy you that much? I never really mind.” “But I do,” said Frits. Jaap and Joosje turned right. “See you tomorrow,” said Frits. He headed down a long, narrow street and reached the cinema post-haste. The doorman was just setting a large sign, reading “Sold Out”, on the pavement outside. Frits entered the foyer, and saw that it was full of people waiting. He pulled out his tickets and was looking around when someone tapped him on the shoulder. “He moves in mysterious ways,” he thought, “it is Maurits.” “I run into you at the least opportune moments,” he said. “I’m trying to get a ticket,” Maurits said, “do you know where I can get one?” “I have one left,” said Frits, “I would rather have sat next to something else, but it could be worse. One fifty-five.” “May God protect me,” Maurits said, “you have money to burn, I believe.” He paid and accepted the ticket with the reservation stub. “You’re getting your money back, and first-rate company to boot,” he said, “what more could one hope for?”"|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"< 00:00"|"almost midnight"|"He took the chair from the writing table and slid it quietly into the middle of the room, across from Frits. They spoke in subdued voices. “Let’s not make this session too long,” Frits said. “It is almost midnight.”"|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"He awoke; it was four o’clock. “I need to empty my mind entirely,” he thought and, with a few deep breaths, his body relaxed and he fell asleep again."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"

"~ 12:00"|"Around noontime"|"“Yes, exactly,” Jaap said. “They used to go camping too, every year; they called it ‘trekking’. They had office jobs and they lived in Haarlem. They still do, actually. They would leave on Saturday afternoon, and arrive at our place around dinnertime. Then it was always: come now, stay and eat with us. Fine, they would stay and eat. By then it was dark out: well, I think we’d be better off leaving in the morning. Fine, so they spent the night. On Sunday morning they packed all the things they had unpacked the night before: bananas, eggs, the primus stove, whatever else it may have been. Then everything was ready, but it always turned out that one of them had a flat tyre. So they would carry the bike back upstairs and fix the flat on the balcony. My mother, she just let them muddle about. Around noontime they were finished: well then, stay and have a sandwich. The bananas, bread, eggs and primus stove—they always packed that on top, of course—were all unpacked again. And around one thirty they finally cycled off. First they would go to Blaricum. They had a grandmother living there, a sweet woman. They would arrive late in the afternoon—because they’d stopped for a rest somewhere—and stay for dinner. You know what, they would say then, it’s too late to go on now. Grandma, they said then, we’re going to put up the tent back there. Behind the house was a little stand of trees, I should have said that before. The grandmother—she died a few years back—couldn’t stand the thought, of course: sleeping in a tent! She would say: no, don’t sleep in one of those things, you’ll catch your death of cold. She made beds for them on the floor and they slept there in the house. The next morning, they got up none too early. Then they would go into conclave. With big maps. They could go here, they could go there. A whole itinerary. To the Ardennes.” “To the Ardennes!” he repeated, barking with laughter. “But they had unpacked everything the night before, of course; the tent too. And Grandmother would say: I believe the weather is taking a turn for the worse. So they spent the rest of the day there, looking at the maps a bit, peering at the sky: we’ll wait and see. The next morning it was raining. A fine drizzle, but enough to keep them from leaving. They stayed inside. Their grandmother was pleased as punch, of course, simply to have the grandchildren, and they sat around all day, just talking.

"ap 10:15"|"quarter past ten"|"“What does your watch say, Frits, my boy?” asked Jaap. “It is a quarter past ten,” Frits answered. “Yet still we must keep in mind that God is the beginning and the end of all things. Eating meat is sinful.”"|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 03:00"|three|"Jaap, leaning against Joosje, sat watching the dancers with eyes half-open. “So then it was three,” Frits said. “Just like in the nursery rhyme.

"ap 03:00"|three|"“Then it was three, as mentioned,” Frits went on. “Then I failed French and mathematics, both subjects. And I did not move up.” He looked at Viktor.

Do you believe in God?” “No,” Viktor said, “I’ve told you that before.” “All right, then,” said Frits with a dismissive wave of his hand, “that need not prove an obstacle to mutual understanding.” A dancer stepped on his toes. “Clumsiness, but perhaps without malice after all,” he said. “The exam didn’t happen?” Viktor asked."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 08:30"|"eight thirty"|"SUNDAY MORNING at eight thirty he awoke with a mouth dry as cork. The first thing he remembered was lying on his bed the day before, to rest, then realized that this was Sunday. It was not until then that the course of the previous evening came back to him. He raised himself onto one elbow. Only after making chewing motions did moisture return to his mouth. The inside of his head felt as though a fluid were under pressure there: the tension extended all the way to the back of his neck. He was thirsty."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap > 09:00"|"A few minutes past nine"|"“The best thing,” he thought, “is to get up immediately, wash my face, brush my teeth and rinse my mouth thoroughly. Then go out for a breath of fresh air. Don’t eat a thing, and drink water a little at a time.” Then he fell asleep again. A few minutes past nine thirty he awoke once more. “How very attentive, to hang the watch up like that,” he thought. He raised only his head, but had to let it fall back from the pain, which arose in the throat and behind his eyes. “Those clothes have been tossed down sloppily,” he thought. From the intensity of the light and the colour of the sky he tried to determine what the weather was like, but reached no conclusion. Lying on his back, he raised his knees and, in the dim light he admitted by holding the bedclothes aloft, examined his chest and belly, which he had bared."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 01:00"|"One o’clock"|"Gradually he sank into a regularly broken slumber that brought him no relief. One o’clock came. “What frequency are the news reports on?” his mother asked. “There are none,” he answered. She searched, but found no Dutch-language station, and turned off the set. Silence fell. His mother was at the table adding up little piles of change, and his father, who had spread himself out on the divan, had stopped moving."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap < 02:00"|"almost two"|"Frits relaxed his muscles to the full, let his head fall to one side and held his eyes half-closed to the bright light. Finally, he fell asleep. He did not dream, but heard monotone voices going up and down. After awakening he remained sitting motionless for five minutes. Then, turning his head, he saw by the clock that it was almost two. He got up and began walking slowly back and forth."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"“Fearful? Yes, fearful,” the girl said, giggling. “Just plain scared. Someone rang the bell last night at one o’clock.” “Aha,” said Frits. “Have a seat,” she said.

"ap 02:50"|"Two fifty"|"“Voilà,” said Frits, “and then came the bill. How much did he charge?” “Two fifty.

"ap 08:45"|"quarter to nine"|"“I wouldn’t dare claim that I understand a bit of it,” he thought, stuck the packages in his pocket, tucked the rabbit inside his coat, close to the armpit, and left.

"ap 06:30"|"six thirty"|"“The factory?” his father asked. His forehead wrinkled in a frown. “I was twelve. In the weaving mill.” “Did you go to work with the weavers right away?” his mother asked. She folded up the tablecloth. “I thought you worked in another part of the factory first.” “No, of course not,” his father said, pursing his lips as though against a cold wind. Slowly his features relaxed again. “Father,” Frits asked, “what time did you start work then, and what time were you finished?” “From six thirty,” the man replied, placing his hands on the table and lacing his fingers, “until seven in the evening.” “This isn’t quite the tenth time I’ve heard this,” Frits thought. “Were you allowed a break?” he asked. “Yes,” his father answered, “from noon to one thirty.”"|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"

"ap 06:30"|"six thirty"|"“When you come in,” his father said, “the whole factory hall is still dark. Only a few paraffin lamps are lit. At six thirty the big drive shafts, up at the top”—he lifted his arms—“start to turn. Slowly at first. Then the lights go on, gradually.” “Just like at the theatre,” Frits said, “when the curtains are raised. Then it gets lighter and lighter, but you can’t see that they’re increasing the current the whole time.” “What you see,” his father went on, “what you see is that long shaft with all those gears, as long as the whole factory, starting to turn”—he made a tumbling motion in the air with his hands—“and then the lights come on, and then it begins.”"|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
00:00|midnight|"A few minutes later his mother came in with the dishes. “I’m going to Bep Spanjaard’s,” he said, “and from there we’re going to a midnight showing at The Lantern, at eleven thirty.” “What time will you come home then, for God’s sake?” she asked. “It will probably be around two o’clock,” he replied, “be sure not to bolt the door.” “One of these days you’ll go completely mad,” she said. “True,” Frits said, “I am already moving in that direction, by leaps and bounds. But don’t tell anyone.” “Where lies salvation?” he thought. His father came in and asked: “What is it now? What is all this fuss about?” “No, Father,” he said, “it is a matter of speaking loudly in order to explain something.” “What kind of a film is that, that people have to go to it so late at night?” his mother asked. “It’s The Green Pastures,” Frits answered slowly. “What is it about?” she asked. She was standing in front of the sideboard. His father had deposited himself on the divan. “That is what I shall find out this evening,” Frits replied. “Well, enjoy yourself,” she said. “Forward march,” Frits mumbled to himself. “Double time. Away, away.” He pulled on his coat without first grasping the sleeves of his jacket, so they ended up around his elbows. “We’ll take care of that in a minute,” he said quietly, “but first, out of the door.” “Goodbye, Mother. Goodbye, Father,” he called out at the living room door, “I wish you a pleasant evening. Should anyone come to visit me, please tell them that Mr van Egters will be home very late; warn them that it could be a very long wait indeed.” He closed the door quietly and hopped, holding onto the handrail, down the stairs, three steps at a time."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"

"ap 10:51"|"nine to eleven"|"“Well, well, Mr van Egters,” Jaap said, “what is the weather like outside?” “Foggy, my liege, my lord,” Frits replied. “Aha,” Jaap said, looking around with an expression of triumph, “how lovely is the onset of spring, when everything starts growing again. I have already seen the coltsfoot in flower, now we must only wait for the Michaelmas daisy, then we’re finished with the whole thing. Yes, yes, allez, allez, oy oy oy, wise words and true, neighbour.” “Holy Christ,” Frits thought, “I’ve barely come in the door.” “Why don’t we actually talk about something?” he said. “If anyone knows of anything, let them speak.” “What’s wrong, don’t you like flowers?” Jaap asked, tilting his head and grinning. “You disappoint me; you disappoint me terribly.” “Oh, stop it, stop it,” Bep said, giggling. Hoogkamp cleared his throat. “And now I’m stuck here from nine to eleven,” Frits thought."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap < 09:30"|"almost nine thirty"|"“So now we’ve dealt with cancer and diabetes,” Frits said. “Elephantiasis, that’s a fine one too,” Jaap said. “Then you sit on your own balls, like a hassock. Truly something to behold.” Frits burst out in a high, screeching laugh, choked on the smoke in his lungs and hacked. “You know what we haven’t talked about yet, or at least only superficially?” he asked, looking at Bep and Joosje, who had not laughed along with them, “the galloping consumption.” “Maybe I’m going too far now,” he thought. “Too far. It’s almost nine thirty.”"|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap ~ 11:00"|"Around eleven"|"“But if something had gone wrong, not one of them would have come to your rescue,” Bep said. “Then you would have drowned,” Frits said, “how gruesome. That must be a terrible way to die.” “Oh no,” Jaap said, “you hear bells, the ringing of bells. And you wash up on the beach of your own accord, all you have to do is be patient.” “When have I heard him say that before?” Frits thought, “he’s said that before.” “What time are we leaving, exactly, Bep?” he asked. “Around eleven, whenever we feel like it,” Bep said."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
00:00|Midnight|"“Where are you people going?” Louis asked. “To the pictures,” Frits said. “Midnight showing at The Lantern.” “What’s on?” Louis asked. “The Green Pastures,” Frits replied, “at eleven thirty. We have tickets.” “Do you think it’s sold out?” Louis asked. “Yes, I think so,” Frits said. “I think so too,” said Bep. “Well,” Jaap said, “you can try, but you don’t stand much of a chance.”"|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"

"ap 11:00"|eleven|"“I need to leave,” Frits thought. “Go outside for a bit, muster my strength.” “Bep,” he asked, “Violenstraat, is it that way?” He pointed west. “I need to drop off a letter there. We won’t be going that way later, will we?” “I’m acting like a moron,” he told himself, “I know that it’s in a completely different direction.” “No,” Bep answered, “it’s the other direction.” “Fine,” Frits said, “I’ll just go and drop it off, otherwise it will only stay in my pocket.” He pulled on his overcoat, which was lying on the sideboard, and said: “You won’t leave until eleven, will you? Fine. I’ll be back by then.”"|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 02:00"|two|"Waiting in the foyer, they examined the photos and posters on the walls. Frits went to the lavatory and, when he returned, began pacing back and forth. “I know already that it will all be a failure,” he thought, “but there is no going back. Home at two, consumed with disappointment, broken with misery, dull with fatigue. Sleep tight.” He went to stand beside Hoogkamp and said: “I have as yet received no accurate impression of you.” “Come on,” he thought, “no foolish qualms.” “You seem to me to be a bit of a dolt,” he said. Hoogkamp did not reply. The five of them were standing before a large display of photos behind glass. “I am not saying this to be hateful, don’t misunderstand me,” Frits went on. “It is a matter of sincerity. You just happen to have, as I have noticed, limited intellectual faculties. Must one keep silent about that?” He suddenly felt himself tiring. “What venom, what misery,” he thought. “I wish you a great deal of success,” he went on. “There are people without personality who go through life with surprising ease.” No one spoke a word. He turned to Jaap and asked quietly: “Now that we’re on the subject; is one allowed to perform a funeral on one’s own? I mean: if you don’t have much money to spend, or if you consider it a waste of resources, are you allowed to transport a corpse yourself, on a handcart for example, to the cemetery? And dig the grave yourself?” “I believe so,” Jaap replied. “I believe that if the interment itself is in accordance with the law, you may transport the dead person yourself. Acquaintances of ours took their child to the cemetery on the back of the bicycle. The coffin on the carrier. And they dug the hole themselves.” “Excellent,” Frits said. “Look, the doors are open.”"|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 02:10"|"ten past two"|"At home he entered the hall cautiously, keeping his coat on, and went into his bedroom without visiting the kitchen first. “No need to brush my teeth,” he murmured, “it is an evening of conciliation.” He took the rabbit from the bookcase, placed it on the desk, then opened the left drawer and removed the little white marble rabbit that lay in the left front corner. “The Sunday before yesterday I held it in my hand as well,” he thought. “Why am I cursed with a memory full of torments? But it doesn’t matter. This evening is delightful. The Green Pastures.” He repeated the American name of the film, smiled, placed the marble rabbit atop the head of the bigger one and said quietly: “Despise not thy brother. Know that God seeth you and looks upon you with favour.” He moved both animals so that their snouts touched and then moved apart. “A kiss,” he said quietly, “and now make up.” “It is ten past two,” he thought."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 04:30"|"four thirty"|"He took off his overcoat, tossed it on the floor, removed his shoes and walked across the coat. “No matter,” he said to himself, “atonement has come.” Picking up the coat, he hung it over the arm of the chair, along with the rest of his clothes, and climbed into bed. “Tonight I shall not dream,” he said aloud, “it will be a peaceful night.” He fell asleep quickly. At four thirty he awoke, went to the toilet, climbed back into bed and remained awake for thirty seconds. “I am not having any dreams at all,” he thought."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap > 06:00"|"a few minutes past six"|"He awoke with a congested feeling in nose and throat. His watch showed it to be a few minutes past six thirty. “It will come back,” he murmured. Each time he seemed about to doze off, he kept himself awake by shaking his shoulders jerkily and knocking together his knees."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 02:00"|"TWO O’CLOCK"|"AT TWO O’CLOCK on Tuesday afternoon, he left the office. A fine drizzle had just ceased. “Until I am very much mistaken, some real fog is on its way,” he said to himself as he stepped out of the door. “The wind will keep up for a bit first, but as soon as it dies down, we are in for it.” He walked towards the bicycle shed, but stopped suddenly when he came close to the entrance. “The bicycle is still at the house,” he thought. “Man’s frailty.” He turned and began walking home. Head bowed, hands in his pockets, he moved at a modest pace. “We’re early today,” he thought, “the hours are like those on a Saturday. In reality, though, it is Tuesday. Tomorrow is a Sunday, but it is Wednesday. When we go back to work again it will therefore be a Monday, but at the same time it will be Thursday. So therefore we can rightly say: the day after tomorrow is Saturday. This illustrates how, with only limited means, one can render simple things complicated. It is not a bad week.” He took a deep breath and sighed. “Is it raining, or isn’t it?” he said to himself. “There is a situation in which it is raining and one in which it is dry. Between the two there is nothing. Still, minutes go by when you don’t know, when you hold out your hand and are not sure. In the face of uncertainty let us say: it is still raining, but imperceptibly so. Yes, that is a good way to put it.”"|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 02:45"|"quarter to three"|"He opened the door and stepped inside. Beside the fire, his father sat reading. His mother was lying on the divan. He closed the door quietly behind him. “I should say something simple, something normal,” he thought. “It is up to me.” “Frits,” his mother asked in a sleepy voice, “if your coat is wet, will you put it on a hanger beside the fire? Is it raining out?” “Yes,” he answered, “but not in.” “It’s by the sideboard,” she said. “Aha,” he said, picking up the hanger. He slid his coat over it and hung the hook on the ornamental ledge above the sliding doors. “Look,” he thought, “behold, how the light falls in this room. Light is not what it is, more like less-than-total darkness.” “What are we going to do this evening, Mother?” he asked. “Who is coming over?” “It will be just the three of us, nice and cosy,” she replied. “What is it?” his father asked. “Is someone at the door?” “No,” Frits said. “Aren’t Joop and Ina coming, Mother?” he asked. “They’re going to the Adelaars’ this evening,” she answered. “It is,” he thought, “only a quarter to three, but still this day will fill itself like any other.” He pulled a chair over to the radio and turned it on."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
00:00|midnight|"An hour and fifteen minutes later, he awoke. “Why am I lying here, as though I were exhausted?” he thought. “I need to come up with some plans. I need to establish a programme for tomorrow. It is slowly growing dark, and I am just lying here.” He got up, went to the window and looked outside. “This is the final day of the year,” he thought, “until midnight it is still December of this year. Immediately after that it is the 1st of January. Between the two there is nothing. It’s cold in here.”"|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 05:30"|"five thirty"|"His heart beating wildly, he awoke, shivered and sat up. “I didn’t pull a blanket over me,” he thought, “maybe I have already caught a cold.” He stood up and turned on the light. For one whole minute, black spots went on dancing before his eyes. He looked at his watch: it was five thirty. “The chill here is unbearable,” he thought, “I’ll go to the front room.” He went to the kitchen and drank some water. His mother was cooking dinner."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"His mother stacked the dishes and cleared the table. “Even if it’s only for half an hour,” Frits thought, “I need to get out of here.” “Mother,” he said, “there’s somewhere I need to go. I’ll be back at eight o’clock.” “Will you come back right away?” she asked. “I have something nice, and there’s something else as well.” “Well, well,” Frits said, smiling, “and what might that be?” “You’ll see,” she said. “A surprise?” he asked. She nodded."|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 06:45"|"quarter to seven"|"Stepping outside, he turned up his collar. It was dry and the air was clear; a mild easterly wind was blowing. “I should have worn a scarf,” he thought. “I’m sure the weather is taking a turn. The mist has blown away already and the air is drier. That means a light frost, and thaw during the day.” He walked along the river and stopped before Louis Spanjaard’s door. “Not even a quarter to seven yet,” he murmured, looking at his watch. He stepped back and looked up. “The light is on,” he said quietly, “he must be home. Fortune smiles on us.”"|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
00:00|midnight|"“So you won’t be home this evening?” Frits asked. “Are you going to your parents’?” “Yes,” Louis replied. “I don’t see any cats in here,” Frits said. “They have stopped coming into the room lately,” Louis said. “Frightened, of course,” Frits said. “I suppose it could be that,” said Louis, his eyes on the floor. “Do you know why an elephant is afraid of mice?” Frits asked. “No,” Louis said. “Because he’s afraid of getting one up his trunk,” Frits said. “Ah, might that be it?” said Louis. They were silent. “What am I going to talk about now?” Frits thought. “Will there be a lot of guests at your place tonight, Louis?” he asked. “Will there be drinks?” “Could be,” Louis replied. “If it’s too boring, I’ll leave right away. I won’t stick it out till midnight, I don’t believe.”"|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
00:00|midnight|"“I will shore up my courage until midnight,” he mumbled. “I must persevere till then. There is nothing else for it.” “Still, I really should say something,” he thought, “but I don’t know what. Let me go home. The chill is working its way into everything.” “Do you enjoy wintertime, Louis?” he asked. “Definitely,” Louis answered without turning to look at him, “but I always find it so much colder than the summer. Besides that, though, I have nothing against it.”"|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 08:30"|"eight thirty"|"“Or flowers,” he thought. “Buying expensive flowers that are already overblown. When the person you give them to waves the bunch slightly, all the petals fall off. You would be better off dead. It is eight thirty.”"|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"The music stopped. “This is Hilversum One, brought to you by the VARA,” the announcer said. “That was the conclusion of today’s programme.

Until tomorrow, dear listeners; we wish you a pleasant evening and—at twelve o’clock you will not be hearing my voice, so let me say it now—a very happy New Year.” A crisp click sounded from the speaker, then a quiet zoom. “This is Hilversum, the NCRV,” another voice said. “Good evening, esteemed listeners.

After that, in fact, it is finished.” He placed his right fist atop his left on the table and lowered his forehead onto it. After five minutes, he sat up straight again. “A conversation that stagnates is a dangerous thing,” he thought. “Even if a question is entirely pointless, it is better than no question at all.” “Father,” he said loudly, “Father.” The man looked up. “It is no disaster, to be unhappy,” Frits thought, “but how discouraging must it be to know that there is nothing to pin the blame on, outside oneself? The grave yawns, time zooms, and salvation is nowhere to be found. Poor man. The shiver of pathos. Scrumptious pity.”"|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"

That’s not quite it, not exactly, but it’s close.” “Ten o’clock is the first milestone,” he thought, “then it’s on to eleven. Once we’re past that, the worst is over.”"|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 10:30"|"ten thirty"|"He slid the mirror over in front of him, leaned forward, twisted the shade on the desk lamp back and forth until the light fell directly on his face, and looked at what he saw. “A complexion full of coarse, unclean pores,” he mumbled, “a tired, stale face. A mouth chafed at the corners, where the skin is flaking. Dark bags beneath the eyes. Over forehead and cheeks, a layer of greasy, glistening sweat.” “Yes, you just hold your horses,” he said, swatting the rabbit on the head a few times. “You can’t get out of there anyway. Don’t even bother trying. For you I have a very special punishment in store. You will be given twenty-three lashes. If you scream, ten more. Then I’ll stick a pin in your rear end and another one in the back of your neck.” With his right hand he seized the rabbit’s ears and went on: “Then I’ll twist your ears. I’ll wring them like wet laundry, until a bit of blood drips from them.” He let go. “Then I’ll make you dance on a glowing iron plate. That is a very harsh punishment indeed, but what you did is so disgraceful, there is no other punishment for it.” He clamped his teeth in one of its ears. “There is no escape,” he whispered, “because around your neck is a chain, which is riveted to the ceiling. I will heat that plate hotter and hotter, till it glows.” He released the ear, petted the rabbit’s head and said a little louder: “Now don’t cry. Nothing has happened yet. And it won’t, not until ten thirty. You still have half an hour.”"|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
"ap 11:15"|"quarter past eleven"|"“Nowhere,” Frits said. “I was in the next room, checking something.” “It’s already well over a quarter past eleven,” she said. “A quarter past eleven?” he asked, “quarter past eleven?” He looked at his watch.

Glorious.” “This is the same feeling,” he said to himself. “Mr Vogel is ill. The last period has been cancelled.” He turned on the radio. “How simple things are,” he thought. A piano was playing a slow tune. The tones grew weaker and faded. “Don’t start twisting the knob back and forth right away,” his mother said. “No,” he said, “it fades. That’s part of the programme.”"|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"

They heard the sound of shuffling feet in a cavernous space. “Probably another church,” his mother said. An organ began playing softly. After a few bars the congregation joined in. “Hark, hark,” Frits said to himself, “hours, days, months, years.” “Listen to that,” he said aloud, “hours, days, months, years.” “Hours, days, months, years,” he repeated to himself, “hours, days, months, years.” He turned up the volume. “Can’t you turn that down a little?” his father asked. “No,” Frits replied, “this needs to be loud. Leave it like this, just the way it is.” His heart was pounding. “Hours, days, months, years,” he said to himself. “This is the evening. This is the night. It is New Year’s Eve. In a little over twenty-eight minutes it will be midnight. I still have twenty-eight minutes. I must collect my thoughts. I must be finished thinking when twelve o’clock strikes.” He looked at his father. “Help those who are oppressed and imagine themselves abandoned in this world,” he thought. “Old fart.”"|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"

That was a real occasion.” He scratched his chin, broke wind and went on: “They would go out on Saturday evening and wouldn’t come back till Sunday morning, around nine o’clock. With a whole heap of finches. They sold them.”"|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"

A little over three minutes.” He pulled his chair over to the radio and began running through the channels. “—we bring you ‘The Policeman’s Holiday’,” a voice said. “After that there will be a pause of about thirty seconds. You will hear the seconds ticking away; at ten seconds before midnight you will hear the sound we announcers know so well, signalling the full hour: a brief, clear tick.”"|"The Evenings"|"Gerard Reve"
