It was Monday, and Ob should have called me out of bed at five-thirty, but he didn’t, and when I finally woke at seven o’clock, it was too late to set the day straight. But maybe God intended for me to sleep in that morning, needed me to stay home, as He counted on all of the day’s events spreading out just like He’d planned them."|"Missing May"|"Cynthia Rylant"

"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"We stayed among the senators and legislators until five o’clock, and when they started heading out to their cars to go home, we called the Glen Meadows Motel to cancel; then we headed on out to ours. I gave Cletus the front seat."|"Missing May"|"Cynthia Rylant"
