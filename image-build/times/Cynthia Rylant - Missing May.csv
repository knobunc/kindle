It was Monday, and Ob should have called me out of bed at five-thirty, but he didn’t, and when I finally woke at seven o’clock, it was too late to set the day straight. But maybe God intended for me to sleep in that morning, needed me to stay home, as He counted on all of the day’s events spreading out just like He’d planned them."|"Missing May"|"Cynthia Rylant"

I had pretty much come to the conclusion that Ob had overslept not because he had made a mistake but because deep down he was finished. Finished waiting for May and finished waiting for all his grief to dry up and leave him. And maybe, in a way, finished with me."|"Missing May"|"Cynthia Rylant"

"ap 06:00"|six|"A gifted writer returns to one of her favorite themes — love — in this case, as it can inform and transform grief. After her mother’s death, Summer was handed from one unwilling relative to another, “treated like a homework assignment somebody was always having to do.” At six, she was taken in by an elderly uncle and aunt. Ob had a game leg (WW II) and enjoyed creating unusual whirligigs; May liked gardening behind their West Virginia trailer. They loved each other with a deep and abiding love, wholeheartedly including Summer. Now, six years later, May has died. In a poetic, ruminative narrative, Summer recounts Ob’s mounting depression, his growing conviction that May is still present, and their expedition to find “Miriam B. Young: Small Medium at Large.” Meanwhile, they’ve been befriended by Cletus, an odd, bright boy in Summer’s class; she doesn’t especially value his company, but is intrigued by his vocabulary (“surreal”; “Renaissance Man”) and his offhand characterization of her as a writer. Rylant reveals a great deal about her four characters, deftly dropping telling details from the past into her quiet story — including a glimpse of Summer, as seen by a girl in her class, “Like some sad welfare case,” a description the reader who has read her thoughts will know to be gloriously untrue. A beautifully written, life-affirming book."|"Missing May"|"Cynthia Rylant"
"ap 06:00"|six|"— School Library Journal, starred review Orphaned at six, raised by an elderly West Virginia aunt and uncle with more devotion than money, Summer is twelve years old when Aunt May dies. Summer’s grief is profound, but Uncle Ob seems unable to go on living without his beloved companion. The final scene is a triumphant catharsis as they find consolation in their memories and in each other. A haunting first-person narrative."|"Missing May"|"Cynthia Rylant"
