They made their slow way up the Avenue to Scholes Street. Some carried their junk in their arms. Others had wagons made of a wooden soap box with solid wooden wheels. A few pushed loaded baby buggies."|"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"|"Betty Smith"

"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"After a while, Francie got tired of watching them. She knew that they would play and fight and show off until it was time to drift home for supper. It was two o’clock. The librarian should be back from lunch by now. With pleasant anticipation, Francie walked back towards the library."|"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"|"Betty Smith"
"ap ~ 04:00"|"About four o’clock"|"As she read, at peace with the world and happy as only a little girl could be with a fine book and a little bowl of candy, and all alone in the house, the leaf shadows shifted and the afternoon passed. About four o’clock, the flats in the tenements across from Francie’s yard came to life. Through the leaves, she looked into the open uncurtained windows and saw growlers being rushed out and returned overflowing with cool foaming beer. Kids ran in and out, going to and returning from the butcher’s, the grocer’s and the baker’s. Women came in with bulky hock-shop bundles. The man’s Sunday suit was home again. On Monday, it would go back to the pawnbroker’s for another week. The hock-shop prospered on the weekly interest money and the suit benefited by being brushed and hung away in camphor where the moths couldn’t get at it. In on Monday, out on Saturday. Ten cents’ interest paid to Uncle Timmy. That was the cycle."|"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"|"Betty Smith"
"ap 05:00"|"FIVE O’CLOCK"|"PAPA CAME HOME AT FIVE O’CLOCK. BY THAT TIME, THE HORSE AND wagon had been locked up in Fraber’s stable, Francie had finished her book and her candy and had noted how pale and thin the late afternoon sun was on the worn fence boards. She held the sun-warmed, wind-freshened pillow to her cheek a moment before she replaced it on her cot. Papa came in singing his favorite ballad, “Molly Malone.” He always sang it coming up the stairs so that everyone would know he was home."|"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"|"Betty Smith"

She bought an ice cream sandwich and treated Francie to a bite. Soon Maudie had to go in. She wasn’t allowed out on the street after eight at night. The girls parted after mutual promises were asked and given to go to confession together the following Saturday."|"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"|"Betty Smith"

Now she could not receive communion. Here was a real sin to confess to the priest next week."|"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"|"Betty Smith"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"So Johnny and Katie talked away the night and the rise and fall of their voices was a safe and soothing sound in the dark. Now it was three in the morning and the street was very quiet. Francie saw a girl who lived in a flat across the street come home from a dance with her feller. They stood pressed close together in her vestibule. They stood embracing without talking until the girl leaned back and unknowingly pressed the bells. Then her father came down in his long underdrawers and, with quiet but intense profanity, told the fellow what he could go and do to himself. The girl ran upstairs giggling hysterically while the boy friend walked away down the street whistling, “When I Get You Alone, Tonight.”"|"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"|"Betty Smith"

Katie sat in the front row and asked him to sing. He sang to her; sentimental songs of the time: “She May Have Seen Better Days,” or “I’m Wearin’ My Heart Away For You.” People living nearby would be coaxed out of their midnight sleep by the singing.

They passed the baker’s where the smell of freshly baked rolls came up to them from the baking room in the basement. Johnny ran down and bought a nickel’s worth of buns hot from the oven. Arriving home, they had a breakfast of hot coffee and warm sweet buns. Then Johnny ran out and got the morning American and read the news to her, with running comments, while she cleaned up their rooms. At noon, they had a hot dinner of pot roast and noodles or something good like that. After dinner they slept until it was time to get up for work."|"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"|"Betty Smith"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"In a few months, to their innocent amazement and consternation, Katie found out that she was pregnant. She told Johnny that she was “that way.” Johnny was bewildered and confused at first. He didn’t want her to work at the school. She told him she had been that way for quite a while without being sure and had been working and had not suffered. When she convinced him that it was good for her to work, he gave in. She continued working until she got too unwieldy to dust under the desks. Soon she could do little more than go along with him for company and lie on the gay couch no longer used for love-making. He did all the work now. At two in the morning, he made clumsy sandwiches and overboiled coffee for her. They were still very happy although Johnny was getting more and more worried as the time wore on."|"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"|"Betty Smith"
07:00|"seven in the morning"|"They welcomed the midwife and shooed Johnny out of the place. He sat on the stoop and trembled each time Katie cried out. He was confused, it had happened so suddenly. It was now seven in the morning. Her screams kept coming to him even though the windows were closed. Men passed on their way to work, looked at the window from behind which the screams were coming and then looked at Johnny huddled on the stoop and a somber look came over their faces."|"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"|"Betty Smith"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"Towards dawn, the boys went to their mother’s house where Johnny fell into a troubled sleep. At nine, he woke up with a feeling of coming trouble. He remembered Katie and, too late, he remembered the school. He washed and dressed and started for home. He passed a fruit stand which displayed avocados. He bought two for Katie."|"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"|"Betty Smith"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"She left and Katie turned her face to the wall and tried not to cry. During the night, she assured herself that Johnny was working at the school. She had hoped that he would run home for a moment during the two o’clock eating period. Now it was late morning and he should be home. Maybe he had gone to his mother’s to snatch some sleep after the night’s work. She made herself believe that no matter what Johnny was doing, it was all right and that his explanation would set her mind at ease."|"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"|"Betty Smith"
03:00|"three o’clock in the morning"|"Katie told Sissy of the talk she had had with their mother that day. The idea of the bank so fascinated Sissy, that she got up—even though it was the middle of the night—emptied out a can of milk into a bowl and made the bank then and there. She tried to crawl into the narrow crowded closet to nail it down but her voluminous nightgown got her tangled up. She pulled it off and crawled naked into the closet. All of her couldn’t fit into the closet. The large luminous naked back end of her stuck out as she crouched on her knees hammering the bank to the floor. Katie had such a fit of giggling that she was afraid she’d bring on a hemorrhage. The loud banging at three o’clock in the morning woke the other tenants. They pounded on the ceiling from below and on the floor from above. Sissy threw Katie into another spasm of giggles by mumbling from the closet that the tenants had a nerve raising such a racket when there was a sick woman in the house. “How can anybody sleep?” she asked, giving the last nail a terrific bang."|"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"|"Betty Smith"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"After supper, Katie read the babies to sleep. She read a page of the introduction to Shakespeare and a page of begats from the Bible. That was as far as she had gotten to date. Neither the babies nor Katie understood what it was all about. The reading made Katie very drowsy but doggedly she finished the two pages. She covered the babies carefully, then she and Johnny went to bed too. It was only eight o’clock but they were tired out from moving."|"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"|"Betty Smith"

The iron must have had a tiny gasoline arrangement inside it to keep it hot. Francie did not know this. She thought it part of the mystery of his race that he could iron with an iron never heated on a stove.

She set it for six and stood it on the piano. She took the privilege of using up part of the precious hour. She removed her pearl-gray, skin-tight kid gloves, blew into each finger, smoothed and folded them and placed them on the piano. She undid her veil and threw it back over her hat.

He sauntered down the street with his light dancer’s step whistling “My Sweetheart’s the Man in the Moon.” The figure in its tuxedo and derby hat, with a rolled-up waiter’s apron in a neat packet under its arm, seemed like life itself to Francie.

The week before, each child had been given a strip of ten tickets labeled “hot dog,” “soda water,” “merry-go-round” and so on. Francie and Neeley had each been given a strip but Francie had been tempted by some shrewd boys into gambling her tickets in a marble game. They had told her how she might possibly win fifty strips and have a grand day on the excursion. Francie was a poor marble player and quickly lost her tickets. Neeley, on the other hand, had three strips. He had been lucky. Francie asked Mama could she have one of Neeley’s tickets.

A boy had taken her tin horn and broken it in two across his knee. She met Neeley coming along with a bloody nose. He had been in a fight with another boy who wanted to take his basket. Neeley wouldn’t say who won but he had the other boy’s basket besides his own. They went home to a good Thanksgiving dinner of pot roast and home-made noodles and spent the afternoon listening to Papa reminisce how he had gone around Thanksgiving Day as a boy."|"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"|"Betty Smith"

Kids volunteered to stand up against the throwing. If a boy didn’t fall down under the impact, the tree was his. If he fell, he forfeited his chance at winning a tree. Only the roughest boys and some of the young men elected to be hit by the big trees. The others waited shrewdly until a tree came up that they could stand against. The little kids waited for the tiny, foot-high trees and shrieked in delight when they won one."|"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"|"Betty Smith"

It was the biggest tree in the neighborhood and its price was so high that no one could afford to buy it. It was ten feet high. Its branches were bound with new white rope and it came to a sure pure point at the top."|"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"|"Betty Smith"

The horse had a mean trick. Often when Flittman was washing under his belly, he’d wet on him. The other fellows would stand around waiting for this to happen so that they could have a good laugh. Flittman couldn’t stand it so he got in the habit of washing the horse in front of his house. That was all right in the summer but it was a little hard on the horse in the winter. Often, on a bitterly cold day, Evy would go down and tell Willie that it was a mean thing to wash Drummer in the cold and with cold water, too. The horse seemed to know that Evy was taking his part. As she argued with her husband, Drummer would whinny pitifully and lay his head on her shoulder."|"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"|"Betty Smith"

She argued that the milk was delivered in the dark and no one would ever know. The boss laughed at her. She told him how much they needed that twenty-two-fifty a week. She pleaded so hard, and looked so little and pretty and spunky, that he gave in at last. He gave her the list of customers and told her the boys would load the wagon for her. The horse knew the route, he said, and it wouldn’t be too hard. One of the drivers suggested that she take the stable dog along for company and protection against milk thieves. The boss agreed to that. He told her to report to the stables at 2 A.M. Evy was the first milkwoman on the route."|"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"|"Betty Smith"

"> 20:00"|"just past twenty"|"“Come on, Neeley,” said Francie. Hand in hand, the children went in to their father. Neeley looked quickly, then, afraid he would start crying, he ran out of the room. Francie stood there with her eyes on the ground, afraid to look. Finally she lifted her eyes. She couldn’t believe that Papa wasn’t living! He wore his tuxedo suit which had been cleaned and pressed. He had on a fresh dicky and collar and a carefully tied bow tie. There was a carnation in his lapel and, above it, his Union button. His hair was shining and golden and as curling as ever. One of the locks was out of place and had fallen down on the side of his forehead a little. His eyes were closed as though he were sleeping lightly. He looked young and handsome and well-cared for. She noticed for the first time how finely arched his eyebrows were. His small mustache was trimmed and looked as debonair as ever. All the pain and grief and worry had left his face. It was smooth and boyish-looking. Johnny was thirty-four years old when he died. But he looked younger now; like a boy just past twenty. Francie looked at his hands, crossed so casually over a silver crucifix. There was a circlet of whiter skin on his third finger where he used to wear the signet ring that Katie had given him when they married. (Katie had taken it off to give to Neeley when he grew up.) It was queer to see Papa’s hands so quiet when she remembered them as always trembling. Francie noticed how narrow and sensitive-looking they were with the long and tapering fingers. She stared steadily at his hands and thought she saw them move. Panic churned up in her and she wanted to run away. But the room was full of people watching her. They would say she was running away because…He had been a good father. He had! He had! She put her hand on his hair and put the lock back in place. Aunt Sissy came and put her arm around her and whispered, “It’s time.” Francie stepped back to stand with Mama while they closed the lid."|"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"|"Betty Smith"
06:00|"six in the morning"|"Francie was glad to be so busy. It kept her from missing Papa too much. She and Neeley got up at six in the morning and helped Mama with the cleaning for two hours before they got ready for school. Mama couldn’t work hard now. Francie polished the brass bell plates in the three vestibules and cleaned each banister spoke with an oiled cloth. Neeley swept out the cellars and swept down the carpeted stairs. Both of them got the filled ash cans up on the curb each day. It had been a problem because the two of them together couldn’t so much as budge the heavy cans. Francie got the idea of tipping over the cans, dumping the ashes on the cellar floor, carrying the empty cans up to the curb and then refilling them with coal buckets. It worked fine, even if it meant a lot of trips up and down the cellar. That left only the linoleum-laid halls for Mama to scrub. Three of the tenants offered to scrub their own hallways until after Katie had had her baby and that helped a whole lot."|"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"|"Betty Smith"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"Neeley had the same schedule as Francie, except that his paper route was added on. Sometimes he didn’t get home for supper until eight o’clock.

Neeley went off to work with instructions to ask McGarrity if he could do Francie’s work as well as his own since Francie had to stay home with their mother. McGarrity not only agreed, but helped the boy with the free lunch so that Neeley was all finished at four-thirty. They had supper early. The sooner Neeley started with his papers, the quicker he’d be finished. Mama said she didn’t want anything except a cup of hot tea."|"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"|"Betty Smith"

But when they have a baby, they want him to see them in the ugliest way a woman can be seen. I don’t know why. I don’t know why.

So keep your man out of the house when your time comes.”
“Yes, Mama. It’s five after seven.”
“See if Neeley’s coming.”"|"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"|"Betty Smith"
"ap 07:15"|"quarter past seven"|"“Yes, it will.” After that, Katie didn’t say anything for a while. When next she asked the time, Francie told her it was a quarter past seven and that Neeley would be home soon. Katie instructed her to wrap Neeley’s nightshirt, toothbrush, a clean towel and a bit of soap in a newspaper, as Neeley was to remain at Evy’s house for the night."|"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"|"Betty Smith"
"ap < 07:30"|"Nearly seven-thirty"|"“I couldn’t do any different than I did,” said Katie. “But it will always be on my conscience just the same. What time is it?”
“Nearly seven-thirty.”

After a look at Katie, Evy pulled the sheet from Francie’s cot, knotted one end to Katie’s bedpost and put the other end in Katie’s hand. “Try pulling on that for a change,” she suggested."|"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"|"Betty Smith"
"ap 09:30"|Nine-thirty|"Francie opened her eyes with a start. She couldn’t have been drowsing, she thought. She just couldn’t have. She felt the plates in the basket. They were cold. Quickly she substituted hot plates. The basket had to be kept warm for the baby. She listened to the sounds from the bedroom. They had changed since she nodded. There was no more leisurely moving to and fro; no more quiet talking. Her aunts seemed to be running back and forth with quick short steps and their voices came in short sentences. She looked at the clock. Nine-thirty. Evy came out of the bedroom, shutting the door behind her."|"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"|"Betty Smith"
"ap < 10:30"|"nearly half past ten"|"Francie had to walk a long way up Manhattan Avenue before she found a Jewish dairy open. She had to go to another store for the crackers and then find a fruit stand that had navel oranges. As she came back, she glanced at the large clock in Knipe’s Drug Store, and noted that it was nearly half past ten. She didn’t care what time it was except that it seemed so important to her mother."|"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"|"Betty Smith"

Since the baby couldn’t be left alone, Katie started her work at five in the morning, doing the other two houses first. She worked until nearly nine when Francie and Neeley left for school. Then she cleaned her own house leaving the door of her flat ajar in case Laurie cried. Katie went to bed immediately after supper each night and Francie saw so little of her mother that it seemed as if Mama had gone away."|"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"|"Betty Smith"

She held an envelope containing five dollars—her first week’s pay. Neeley was bringing home five dollars too. They had agreed to arrive home together and make a little ceremony out of giving the money to Mama."|"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"|"Betty Smith"
"ap 05:30"|five-thirty|"The interview was short. She was hired on trial. Hours, nine to five-thirty, half an hour for lunch, salary, seven dollars a week to start. First, the boss took her on a tour of inspection of the Press Clipping Bureau."|"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"|"Betty Smith"
07:00|"seven in the morning"|"She had often studied the map of the United States and crossed its plains, mountains, deserts, and rivers in her imagination. And it had seemed a wonderful thing. Now she wondered whether she wouldn’t be disappointed in that, too. Supposing, she thought, she was to walk across this great country. She’d start out at seven in the morning, say, and walk westward. She’d put one foot down in front of the other to cover distance, and, as she walked to the west, she’d be so busy with her feet and with the realization that her footsteps were part of a chain that had started in Brooklyn, that she might think nothing at all of the mountains, rivers, plains, and deserts she came upon. All she’d notice was that some things were strange because they reminded her of Brooklyn and that other things were strange because they were so different from Brooklyn. “I guess there is nothing new, then, in the world,” decided Francie unhappily. “If there is anything new or different, some part of it must be in Brooklyn and I must be used to it and wouldn’t be able to notice it if I came across it.” Like Alexander the Great, Francie grieved, being convinced that there were no new worlds to conquer."|"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"|"Betty Smith"
"ap 08:59"|"one minute before nine"|"She adapted herself to the split-second rhythm of the New Yorker going to and from work. Getting to the office was a nervous ordeal. If she arrived one minute before nine, she was a free person. If she arrived a minute after, she worried because that made her the logical scapegoat of the boss if he happened to be in a bad mood that day. So she learned ways of conserving bits of seconds. Long before the train ground to a stop at her station, she pushed her way to the door to be one of the first expelled when it slid open. Out of the train, she ran like a deer, circling the crowd to be the first up the stairs leading to the street. Walking to the office, she kept close to the buildings so she could turn corners sharply. She crossed streets kittycorner to save stepping off and on an extra pair of curbs. At the building, she shoved her way into the elevator even though the operator yelled “Car’s full!” And all this maneuvering to arrive one minute before, instead of after nine!"|"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"|"Betty Smith"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"Once she left home ten minutes earlier to have more time. In spite of no need of hurry, she still pushed her way out of the train, flew up the steps, rushed through the streets economically and crowded into a full elevator. She was fifteen minutes early. The big room was echoingly empty and she felt desolate and lost. When the other workers rushed in seconds before nine, Francie felt like a traitor. The next morning, she slept ten minutes longer and returned to her original timing."|"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"|"Betty Smith"

After supper Neeley went out, either to be with his gang or to play at some ice-cream saloon. Mama read the paper and then she and Laurie went to bed at eight o’clock.

12:00|noon|"A few days later, two slow-moving men with heavy feet came in to see the boss. One of them pushed his palm under the boss’s nose and what he saw in that palm made the boss turn pale. He got a thick stack of clippings from the file box of the most important client. The heavy-footed ones looked them over and returned them to the boss who put them in an envelope and put the envelope in his desk. The two men went into the boss’s lavatory leaving the door ajar. They waited in there all day. At noon, they sent an errand boy out for a bag of sandwiches and a carton of coffee and they ate their lunch in the lavatory."|"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"|"Betty Smith"

Just as the client put it in his inner coat pocket, the heavy ones strolled out of the lavatory. One of them touched the client on the shoulder. He sighed, took the envelope out of his pocket and surrendered it. The second heavy one touched him on the shoulder. The client clicked his heels together, bowed stiffly and walked out between the two men. The boss went home with an acute attack of dyspepsia."|"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"|"Betty Smith"
