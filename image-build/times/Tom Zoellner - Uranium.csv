The entry for 10:33 a.m., typed by Groves’s secretary, summarized the contents of a telephone call from a top navy officer: “Admiral Edwards just called to ascertain if the material we got from the German submarines was of any use to the program. General advised it wasn’t of any help as yet, but that it would be utilized.” As a compulsive micromanager, Groves certainly would have had knowledge of such a detail, and he would have had no known motivation to hide the truth from a U.S. Navy admiral during a secure phone call."|Uranium|"Tom Zoellner"

The atomic flash in New Mexico came as a great affirmation to the prodigious labors of scientists during the past four years. It came as the affirmative answer to the, until then, unanswered question “Will it work?” With the flash came a delayed roll of mighty thunder, heard, just as the flash was seen, for hundreds of miles. The roar echoed and reverberated from the distant hills and the Sierra Oscura range nearby, sounding as though it came from some supramundane source as well as from the bowels of the earth. The hills said yes and the mountains chimed in yes. It was as if the earth had spoken and the suddenly iridescent clouds and sky had joined in one affirmative answer. Atomic energy—yes. It was like the grand finale of a mighty symphony of the elements, fascinating and terrifying, uplifting and crushing, ominous, devastating, full of great promise and great forebodings."|Uranium|"Tom Zoellner"
00:00|midnight|"The Plumbat Affair leaked out in 1977 when a former U.S. Senate attorney named Paul Leventhal spoke about it at a disarmament conference in Austria. The stolen uranium shipment, he said later, was enough to run a reactor such as Dimona for up to a decade and could yield plutonium for up to thirty atomic weapons. He added that any country that wanted uranium could probably obtain it because “safeguards are so weak, incomplete, secretive, and slow.” The Los Angeles Times quoted an expert who characterized the midnight sea transfer not as a hijacking, but as a “laundering” of illicit yellowcake."|Uranium|"Tom Zoellner"

It was first formulated, but not used, by Nazi scientists during World War II. A single drop is powerful enough to kill a healthy adult. On March 20, 1995, five teams of two men each descended into the subway stations at the heart of Tokyo and boarded separate trains. They carried bags full of newspapers soaked with about a liter of homemade sarin. At approximately 8 a.m., they punctured the bags with the sharpened tips of their umbrellas and ran away. Twelve people died and more than a thousand were hospitalized."|Uranium|"Tom Zoellner"
19:55|1955|"In America, the hype mounted. By 1955, Life magazine was reporting—inaccurately—that “more man-hours have been spent in the quest for  uranium than were spent seeking all the other metals in history.” The following year, True West magazine announced, “The most fabulous buried treasure of all time lies scattered and unclaimed, free for the taking.”"|Uranium|"Tom Zoellner"

Each name was followed by a single chime of the elevator bell mounted on the wall. On other nights, the liquor and the boasting would flow until midnight. Alcohol had always been one of the perks of Wismut—the standard ration of brandy was ten bottles a month, and it was said to be an effective tonic for the mysterious coughing spells that many were experiencing. The booze received the nickname “Miner’s Death.”"|Uranium|"Tom Zoellner"

His criticisms were later echoed by a host of ex-administration and intelligence officials who felt the uranium fears were being hyped. To their chagrin, the Italian letter had even found its way into the National Intelligence Estimate, an annual report that supposedly represented the very best information and analysis that the United States had to offer. It was now made to hint at midnight reagents simmering in the Mesopotamian desert—an apocalypse plot of The Other."|Uranium|"Tom Zoellner"

He spent eight days at the Ganwye Hotel, the nicest in town, drinking mint tea at poolside with some of the people he had known in the government and at Areva from his days as a diplomat there in the 1970s. Wilson has an open face and a bearish charm, and the hotel staff took to calling him “Bill Clinton.” He went back to Washington with the report that a midnight sale to Iraq, or anyone, was extremely unlikely."|Uranium|"Tom Zoellner"

Khat is considered a hazardous drug in most other nations, including the United States, where its import is banned. An estimated 75 percent of the men in Yemen (and an unknown, lesser number of women) make chewing khat a daily affair. The leaf is actually sucked rather than chewed, but the “khat chew” has an exalted place in the Yemeni heart as a social ritual among friends and would-be enemies. By 3 p.m. on most days, the right cheeks of most men are bulging as though they have placed a racquetball in their mouths. The government has made it illegal for public employees to use khat on the job, but the rule is widely ignored."|Uranium|"Tom Zoellner"

Uranium waste was burned out of the smokestacks at night—a substance called “midnight negatives”—and radioactivity has been found in the soil nearly a mile away. The Energy Department concluded that nearly sixteen hundred tons of atomic weapons parts, some of them contaminated with enriched uranium, had been scattered around the plant in various locations. The workers here were never told about the dangerous conditions until a 2000 investigation by Joby Warrick of the Washington Post."|Uranium|"Tom Zoellner"

In 1964, a company with the unfortunate name of Pyramid was selling at  35 cents a share, advertising some lead and zinc claims in the Northwest Territories in a joint venture with the mining giant Teck Cominco. The crew had a drill rig out at a frozen spot called Pine Point, and the foreman was supposed to relay encouraging news over the radio with the code words 3 a.m. in hopes of confusing potential eavesdroppers. He got on the radio with a cheerful tone of voice one day, obviously drunk, and his supervisors kept interrupting him to ask him what time it was. “I don’t give a fuck what time it is,” he slurred into the microphone, “we’re all fucking millionaires!”"|Uranium|"Tom Zoellner"
19:22|19-22|"The buying policies of the Atomic Energy Commission and the widespread social effects of uranium mining on the Colorado Plateau are examined in Yellowcake Towns: Uranium Mining Communities in the American West, by Michael Amundson (Boulder: University of Colorado Press, 2002), and Quest for the Golden Circle: The Four Corners and the Metropolitan West, 1945- 1970, by Arthur R. Gomez (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1994). Also of great help was the dissertation “A History of the Uranium Industry on the Colorado Plateau,” by Gary Shumway, University of Southern California, Jan. 1970. Shumway’s master’s thesis, “The Development of the Uranium Industry in San Juan County, Utah,” Brigham Young University, July 1964, also provided source material. Some background on the geology of the Colorado Plateau and the initial mining bonanza was taken from “The Uranium Rush,” by Tom Zoellner, the American Heritage of Invention & Technology, Summer 2000; The Redrock Chronicles, by Tom H. Watkins (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2000); and “The Time of the Great Fever,” by Larry Meyer,  American Heritage, June/July 1981. The “Good for nothing” quote originally appeared in Grand Memories, by Phyllis Cortes (Grand County, Utah: Daughters of the Utah Pioneers, 1978), and was quoted in “Hot Rocks Made Big Waves,” by Amberly Knight, in Utah Historical Quarterly, Winter 2001, as well as the Fall 2006 edition of Canyon Legacy, the journal of the Dan O’Laurie Museum in Moab. The hyperbolic True West article was reprinted in Canyon Legacy,  Summer 2006. The bogus uranium foundations were first reported in “Quackery in the Atomic Age,” in BusinessWeek, Aug. 29, 1953. Some of the quotes from Utah miners in the 1950s—including Jerry Anderson and Oren Zufelt—were drawn from an archive of oral history at California State University, Fullerton, established by Professor Gary Shumway. The naming controversy in Moab comes from The Far Country: A Regional History of Moab and La Sal, Utah, by Faun McConkie Tanner (Salt Lake City: Olympic Publishing, 1976). The anecdotes about the circling airplanes and the staked highway are from One Man’s West, by David Lavender (New York: Doubleday, 1964). Quotes from Paddy Martinez were taken from “The Coming Thing,” by Daniel Lang, in the  New Yorker, Mar. 21, 1953. The Popeye cartoon was described in “Uranium on  the Cranium,” an essay by Michael Admundson in the anthology Atomic Culture: How We Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, ed. Admundson and Scott C. Zeman (Boulder: University Press of Colorado, 2005). Some details on the colorful life of Charlie Steen were drawn from “Uranium Millionaire,” by Jack Goodman, the New York Times, Oct. 17, 1954; “Uranium Mining Stocks Feed Gambling Fever,” by Jack R. Ryan, the New York Times, June 20, 1954; “Uranium: Jackpot in Utah,” in BusinessWeek, Aug. 1, 1953; “Ordinary Was Radioactive to Charlie Steen, the Uranium King,” by Gary Massaro, Rocky Mountain News, Mar. 16, 2006; and “Fallout in the Family,” by Ward Havarky, in Denver’s Westword, Feb. 19, 1998. But this section depended most heavily upon Uranium Frenzy, by Raye Ringholz (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1989), the definitive history of the uranium story in the American Southwest, which also provides the most comprehensive account available of Steen’s Mi Vida strike and the efforts of the AEC to cover up the radioactive disaster. The angry speech at Texas Western College, as well as several other episodes in the life of Steen, and of Utah’s stock bubble, were drawn from Ringholz’s impressive work. John Black’s remembrances were in Blue Mountain Shadows,  Winter 2001, published by the San Juan County Historic Society. Tom McCourt’s recollections of Moab, as well as his reflections on patriotism, were taken from White Canyon: Remembering the Little Town at the Bottom of Lake Powell (Price, Utah: Southpaw Publications, 2003). Joe Blosser’s quote is in “Uranium Is People,” by Paul Schubert, in Empire magazine, reprinted in Reader’s Digest, Mar. 1953. The Dr. Seuss incident is related in “Man on Probation in Attempt to Extort Dr. Seuss Estate,” by Onell R. Soto, in the San Diego Union Tribune, Aug. 21, 2004. Background on the AEC cover-up was drawn from The Myths of August, by Stewart Udall (New York: Pantheon, 1994). The Navajo section drew from the excellent If You Poison Us: Uranium and Native Americans, by Peter Eichstaedt (Santa Fe, N.M.: Red Crane Books, 1994), which contains details on the economics of reservation mining, as well as interviews with miners, including Ben Jones, and information on hazards that still remain. “Blighted Homeland,” a four-part series by Judy Pasternak in the Los Angeles Times, Nov. 19-22, 2007, examined the lasting health and environmental impacts and was the source of the “Saudi Arabia” remark. The story “Udall: Navajo ‘Cancer Free’ Until Uranium,” by Kathy Helms, in the Gallup Independent,  Nov. 15, 2007, had further historical background. The comments of the Navajo miner Willie Johnson came from “Toxic Targets,” by Jim Motavalli, in E magazine, July 1998. An evocative fictional account of the afterlife of a uranium town can be found in the novel Yellowcake, by Ann Cummins (Boston: Houghton  Mifflin, 2007). Health data comes from “Lung Cancer in a Nonsmoking Uranium Miner,” by Karen B. Mulloy et al., in Environmental Health Perspectives  109 (2001); “The History of Uranium Mining and the Navajo People,” by Doug Brugge and Rob Goble, in American Journal of Public Health, Sept. 2002; “Lung Cancer Risk Among German Male Uranium Miners,” by B. Grosche et al., in the British Journal of Cancer, Oct. 2006; and “Diseases of Uranium Miners and Other Underground Miners Exposed to Radon,” by J. M. Samet and D. W. Mapel, in Environmental and Occupational Medicine, 1998. The foremost historians of the postwar uranium era in Europe are Rainer Karlsch of the Free University of Berlin and Zbynek Zeman of Oxford University. Their recently translated book Uranium Matters: Central European Uranium in International Politics, 1900-1960 (Budapest: Central European University Press, 2008), was a source for a few details in this chapter, including the supposed “acts of sabotage” at Wismut and the bedsheets at St. Joachimsthal. Details on the diplomatic background to the Czechoslovakian-Soviet accords, as well as a wealth of information about the Jachymov gulag, come from two illuminating articles by Zbynek Zeman: “The Beginnings of National Enterprise Jachymov (Joachimsthal),” in Der Anschnitt, Mar. 1998, and “Czech Uranium and Stalin’s Bomb,” in Historian, Autumn 2000. Frantisek Sedivy was kind enough to give me a copy of his autobiography, The Legion of the Living (Prague: Eva-Milan Nevole, 2003), which supplied some of the details of his incarceration. He also wrote a novel based on his experience called Under the Tower of Death (Prague: Eva-Milan Nevole, 2003). Translations of key portions of these important books were supplied to me by Marketa Naylor. The anecdote about the dog and the description of the town in St. Joachimsthal comes from “Soft Norms in a Spa,” by Joseph Wechsberg, in the New Yorker, May 3, 1952. Quotes from Joseph Stalin were in Stalin and the Bomb, by David Holloway (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1994), and also cited in Bomb Scare, by Joseph Cirincione (New York: Columbia University Press, 2007). Using previously sealed documents from the Eastern bloc, Norman Naimark pieced together an account of the labor situation at Wismut for a section of his book The Russians in Germany: A History of the Soviet Zone of Occupation, 1945-49 (Cambridge, Mass.: Belknap Press, 1995), from which I garnered a few details. Information about the culture and operations of Wismut were drawn from materials on exhibit at the excellent Museum Uranbergau in Schlema, Germany; I received translation assistance from the curator, Herman Meinel, and from Martha Brantley, who helped me speak with former Wismut miners. Some health statistics were taken from “Wismut: Uranium Exposure Revisited,” by Heinz  Otten and Horst Schulz, a research paper published by the International Labor Organization (New York: United Nations, 1998). The former Wismut manager Nikolai Grishin disclosed some state secrets in “The Saxony Mining Operation,” reprinted in Soviet Economic Policy in Postwar Germany (New York: Research Program on the USSR, 1953). The extent of Western intelligence knowledge about Wismut, though colored by some period bias, can be found in the background paper “Zhukov and the Atomic Bomb,” author unknown (Munich: Radio Free Europe, 1957), as well as Forced Labor in the “People’s Democracies,” by Richard K. Carlton (Munich: Free Europe Committee, 1955). The policies and practices at Wismut were examined in the unpublished doctoral dissertation “The Quest for Uranium: The Soviet Uranium Mining Industry in Eastern Germany, 1945-1967,” by Traci Heitschmidt, on file in the library at the University of California-Santa Barbara. The anecdote about the hidden Soviet enrichment plants comes from Shadow Flights: America’s Secret Air War Against the Soviet Union, by Curtis Peebles (New York: Presidio Press, 2000), and the declassified background paper titled “On the Soviet Nuclear Scent,” by Henry S. Lowenhaupt of the Central Intelligence Agency (undated). Some information about the gulag period is drawn from Jachymov: The City of Silver, Radium, and Therapeutic Water, by Hana Hornatova (Prague: Medeia Bohemia, 2000). The discovery stories were recounted in “Miner’s Luck,” by Henry Winfred Splitter, in Western Folklore, Oct. 1956, as well as History of California, by Theodore Henry Hittell (San Francisco: N. J. Stone, 1898)."|Uranium|"Tom Zoellner"
