12:00|noon|"A murmur approved that tart comment. “Until the shadow of the shield is not.” They had until noon. Van Rycke arose and Dane gathered up his chief’s possessions. With the same superiority to his surroundings he had shown upon entering, the Cargo-master left the enclosure, the Eysies following. But they were away from the clearing, out upon the road back to the Queen before the two from the Company caught up with them."|"Plague Ship"|"Andre Norton"
12:00|noon|"Jellico stood waiting and after a long moment of silence Grange was forced to state his business.
“We have until noon—”
Jellico, his fingers hooked in his belt, simply waited. And under his level gaze the Eysie Captain began to find the going hard."|"Plague Ship"|"Andre Norton"
12:00|noon|"“They have given us until noon,” he started once more, “to get together—”"|"Plague Ship"|"Andre Norton"
12:00|noon|"“You have until noon to lift,” was Jellico’s parting shot as the three in Company livery started toward the road."|"Plague Ship"|"Andre Norton"
12:00|noonday|"Dane did move, up the ladder to the next level and out onto the port ramp. What he saw below brought him up short. Evening had come to Sargol but the scene immediately below was not in darkness. Blazing torches advanced in lines from the grass forest and the portable flood light of the spacer added to the general glare, turning night into noonday."|"Plague Ship"|"Andre Norton"
"ap 06:00"|six|"“Yes, sir. Any orders, sir?”
“No. Blast-off’s at six.”
“Yes, sir.” Dane left the cabin, closing the panel carefully behind him. Would he—or could he—he thought drearily, get back in Van Rycke’s profit column again? Sargol had been unlucky as far as he was concerned. First he had made that stupid mistake and then he got sick and now—And now—what was the matter? Was it just the general attack of nerves over their voyage and the commitments which forced their haste, or was it something else? He could not rid himself of a vague sense that the Queen was about to take off into real trouble. And he did not like the sensation at all!"|"Plague Ship"|"Andre Norton"
"ap ~ 03:00"|"about three"|"“I wonder,” Rip’s eyes were narrowed slits as he leaned back against the wall. “Look at the facts. The Survey ship which charted Sargol—they were dirt-side there about three—four months. Yet they gave it a clean bill of health and put it up for trading rights auction. Then Cam bought those rights—he made at least two trips, in and out before he was blasted on Limbo. No infection bothered him or Survey—”"|"Plague Ship"|"Andre Norton"
00:00|midnight|"The hour was close on midnight before Dane sighted the other light, the pink-red of which winked through the ghastly blue-white with a natural and comforting promise, even though it had been meant for an entirely different purpose. The Queen had earthed with her distress lights on and no one had remembered to snap them off. Now they acted as a beacon to draw the flitter to its berth."|"Plague Ship"|"Andre Norton"
