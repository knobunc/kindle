12:00|noon|"'Yes, at noon. We're over two hours late.' Rimmer looked away, confused. 'Or two hours early. Whichever. And there's half a dozen souvenir shops scattered all over the place. I vote we all start looking. It's our best shot.'"|Backwards|"Rob Grant"
"ap 09:15"|"quarter past nine"|"Again, Rimmer was stopped in his tracks while he mulled over the topsy-turvy logic of this exasperating universe. 'All right. Fine.' He looked at the cafeteria clock. 'It's quarter past nine. We'll give him till eight-thirty.'"|Backwards|"Rob Grant"

00:00|midnight|"'Agreed.' Kryten stood. At that time, the falls' souvenir shops would no longer be open in any case, and they would have to devise a new stratagem. It had taken them just over five hours to hike down from the spot where they had concealed the rebuilt
Starbug.
It would take even longer to get back, travelling uphill. They had until midnight to effect their take-off. After that, the conjunction of the planets would render their journey out of this solar system impossible for some considerable time. If they missed their flight window, they would all be marooned here, which didn't bear thinking about."|Backwards|"Rob Grant"
"ap < 09:00"|"just before nine o'clock"|"Gingerly, he prodded the hatch open a crack and looked out.
It was now just before nine o'clock, and the walkway was deserted.
As Kryten watched, a policeman came running backwards towards him. As he swept past the hatch, Kryten recognized him as the groin-kicker from the mall. Then Lister came into view, chasing the policeman backwards. The cop stopped at the far end of the walkway, yelled into his lapel microphone and stood for a moment looking at Lister."|Backwards|"Rob Grant"
02:00|"two a. m."|"Lister looked at his watch. 'That gives us till two a. m. One-thirty at a pinch. We're going to have to split into two groups. I'm no good in the dark. Neither's Rimmer. I'd best go with the Cat. Come what may, we meet back here at half-past one.'"|Backwards|"Rob Grant"

"ap < 02:15"|"Almost two fifteen"|"'Now?' Kryten had lost track of time. He checked his internal chronometer. Almost two fifteen. 'We'd better get back to
Starbug, see if the others are there.' If Lister and the Cat had managed to unearth the other two engines intact, it might be enough to get them airborne."|Backwards|"Rob Grant"
"ap 01:24"|"One twenty-four"|"Lister checked his watch, agitated. One twenty-four. They were already behind schedule. Two minutes drooled by, and there was still no sign of any danger.

"ap 00:15"|Twelve-fifteen|"
Twelve-fifteen.
Kryten should have been concentrating on meeting the flight window deadline, which wasn't exactly midnight, but close enough not to matter a spit. If they weren't airborne before ten to... well, the alternative didn't bear thinking about."|Backwards|"Rob Grant"

"ap 11:42"|"Eleven forty-two"|"'Not OK.' Rimmer strode over to him. 'Far from OK.' He leaned his face deep into Lister's personal space. 'OK!? Have you seen the time?'
Lister nodded. 'Eleven forty-two.'
'Which means, unless my backwards arithmetic is seriously askew, that we have missed our flight window. Yes?'"|Backwards|"Rob Grant"

05:00|"5 a.m."|"Tranter found himself wondering if this might be an appropriate juncture to avail himself of the secret supply he kept hidden in the water tank of his office bathroom.

horizon. 'But why? Where would these realities come from? What would they be doing there?'"|Backwards|"Rob Grant"
12:00|Noon|"'Oh, much better. A blurry shot of some stars that are probably identical to the ones we've already got, and a soundbite for the

That's a fabulous return for an outlay of thirty billion. That'll probably snag me the cover of

"ap 06:36"|"Six thirty-six"|"He swung his good leg over the side of the bench, dragging its unresponsive partner along with it.

"|Backwards|"Rob Grant"
00:00|midnight|"War twirled his smoking weapons and holstered them. 'Now we got your attention, there's a little message for ya. It's from Pa. Says he wants you out of here by midnight, or he's coming for you, personal, like.'"|Backwards|"Rob Grant"
00:00|midnight|"Carton thought about it. 'Seems to me I did know a Lister once. But it was a long time ago. Like in another life I only dreamt about.' He scoured the wasteland of his memory, but there was nothing meaningful he could find. Just a hazy, blurred recollection of a name. He slapped his thigh and stood. 'Well, it's been mighty dandy meeting you boys, but I have to be hauling my sorry hide out of here 'bout now. I got to be gone by high midnight, or else the buzzards'll be fightin' the lizards for my gizzards.' He stuffed the cork back in the bottle, gathered up his belongings and strode to the doors. He turned and nodded. 'Adios.'"|Backwards|"Rob Grant"
00:00|midnight|"Then the Lister feller used Carton's moniker, only he got it wrong and kind of fouled-up like. 'Kryten,' he said, 'You've really got to start listening.

'High midnight,' Kryten said. His shoulders sagged. 'Too late.'
Rimmer peered out through the knot hole. He could make out the outlines of four horses, lined up at the end of the street. From one side of them, the orange glimmer of the blacksmith's forge illuminated the steam rising from their flanks, cloaking them in an unworldly glow. There was no mistaking the identity of their riders."|Backwards|"Rob Grant"
