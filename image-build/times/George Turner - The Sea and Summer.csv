09:00|"nine in the morning"|"So much had happened, yet it was not quite nine in the morning. Mum shut herself in her still unsettled bedroom; it must have been a horrible time for her, with every fear come true and every inadequacy exposed."|"The Sea and Summer"|"George Turner"
12:00|midday|"At school the heating was off but came on at midday when it no longer mattered. At Mrs Parkes’ house it would have been on all the time . . ."|"The Sea and Summer"|"George Turner"
"ap > 07:00"|"after seven"|"He yelled at the screen, ‘Do you always get up in the small hours?’
‘It is after seven. I thought that—’
So it was, and full daylight, the room bright with early sun; time had raced by while he built a man out of shadows."|"The Sea and Summer"|"George Turner"
"ap 01:00"|"One o’clock"|"‘Straight after lunch? One o’clock, say? At the boat? It will be worth it. There are sections in the book where it helps to have the reality in mind.’"|"The Sea and Summer"|"George Turner"
00:00|midnight|"I was left alone with my mistakes. This conversation would be all through the squads by midnight and in a day or two I would surely be carpeted for jumping the curricular gun. So much for the cool intellect of the instructor, always on top of the exchange."|"The Sea and Summer"|"George Turner"
12:00|midday|"While I preened myself on self-discovery Carol spread my gossip around the tents where it was received with degrees of credence, disbelief, tolerant guffaws and outright fright, according to type. In the morning, when the squads assembled, it caused nervous questions to be asked of tutors. The questions caused a flurry of embarrassed, conflicting, time-serving replies which culminated in an unscheduled conference of tutors at midday. Then Nick was silently gone and a new senior in place. It was accepted that my wagging tongue had precipitated Nick’s downfall (the tutors spoke only of routine replacement) and I achieved among the squads a shortlived notoriety as a man to be wary of, a throneshaker not lightly to be crossed."|"The Sea and Summer"|"George Turner"
00:00|midnight|"In some sentimental long ago he had somehow acquired several hundred of them and each year distributed a few as tokens of favour. They were traditionally stupid, with red-coated Santa Clauses ho-hoing over the arses of grinning reindeer as they whiffled through midnight blue skies over landscapes of snow, with some verses on the inside flap by a dewy-eyed illiterate. These, for an Australian Christmas with the air like steamed pudding at 42 degrees or better!"|"The Sea and Summer"|"George Turner"
03:00|"three a.m."|"‘We will move into the area as soon as briefing is completed and the operation will commence at three a.m.’"|"The Sea and Summer"|"George Turner"
"~ 05:00"|"about five a.m."|"Nick called up cheerfully, ‘It is now about five a.m. You can have eight hours special leave. Get him back to barracks on time, Kovacs. We’ll give you a lift as far as the water’s edge.’"|"The Sea and Summer"|"George Turner"
12:00|midday|"The two boys came for midday dinner, allowing me to play housewife-hostess-mother to the limit with food that cried Parkes provisioning in every bite. At least the cooking was mine."|"The Sea and Summer"|"George Turner"
"ap 04:00"|four|"‘Depravity doesn’t stop at the towers,’ I said. ‘It hits its real high in Sweet territory. There are Sweet who make their own chewey at four and five times strength with a deodorant incorporated so that their intimates don’t catch the sniff. At that strength it’s addictive and can turn nasty.’"|"The Sea and Summer"|"George Turner"
"ap 07:17"|Seven-seventeen|"We shot up to the seventh floor by express lift. Seven-seventeen was a waiting room with deep chairs, a table and a girl in nursing overall. She greeted Arry with a secretive half-smile that suggested her as the one who had trapped him in his sexual game, and said with detectable patronage, ‘A result so soon?’ and looked me over with a satisfied air. ‘He’s young for a copper, isn’t he?’"|"The Sea and Summer"|"George Turner"
"ap ~ 08:00"|"About eight"|"I nodded. ‘So the game is to kill them where the elimination systems can get at them. Now, you know that this virus can change its structure to deal with drugs – but it can’t stand a long, hot summer. So we will create an environment some 5 degrees above normal for several minutes. About eight. That is very hot for a body to be and it is the viral equivalent of a long, hot summer. Humans can die of it if their hearts are not strong enough and your minutes will be spent on the edge of risk. I don’t think it will harm a healthy youngster like you, but it could. It could even kill you. Acceptable risk?’"|"The Sea and Summer"|"George Turner"
"ap > 08:00"|"just after eight"|"I headed for the point where the old West Richmond line splits off from the main yard and runs for a mile or so through a cutting. There are big, spreading, ancient trees where the line runs beneath the road to enter the cutting; I was able to stand motionless in their shadow for ten minutes, watching for sign of a tail. It was just after eight, which is not a shift-change hour, and few people were on the footpaths on this edge of City Center. What few there were seemed intent on their business and none were loitering. I decided that the moment was safe and went over the picket fence and into the railway cutting."|"The Sea and Summer"|"George Turner"
"> 00:00"|"After midnight"|"He sent the lightning sketcher away with an escort Top Nick called up for him. After midnight he said to me, ‘Come on,’ and we slipped out of the tower with a scavenging gang. With them he made arrangements for me to be passed across the city, from group to group, to Newport, knowing that neither of us would be safe so long as I was visible in barracks."|"The Sea and Summer"|"George Turner"
"ap 01:00"|one|"The poor light with upward slanting shadows gave Kovacs’ narrow skull and prominent bones the face of Satan. I think he knew it as he knew everything he could make use of. He produced a couple of chewey tablets, held them close to a lamp before he stripped the wrapping from one and popped it into his mouth."|"The Sea and Summer"|"George Turner"
"ap 07:30"|"seven thirty"|"‘In the last analysis, the whole damned government.’ He swept up the bag with our Swill rags in it. ‘Out!’
By seven thirty we were on our way. ‘Where to, Nick?’
‘To get Francis, we can hide him in the towers—’"|"The Sea and Summer"|"George Turner"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"At seven, dressing-gowned, waiting for my morning tea to cool, I called, ‘Come in,’ expecting Gwen with my outfit for the day, but it was Tallis, still wearing his pantry apron. ‘I thought it better to come myself, ma’am, than to risk staff gossip.’"|"The Sea and Summer"|"George Turner"
