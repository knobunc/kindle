02:00|"2 am"|"I’m absorbed in the wonder of it all. “Maravilloso,” Jairo agrees, looking at my face. He’s been up since 2 am and seen this many times, and yet he, too, is visibly moved. Marine turtles are usually hidden from us in their underwater world, while we are bound to dry land. I’ve seen them close up, rarely, while diving, where they move effortlessly and with surprising grace. It is unusual to see large wild animals up close, and to see so many—to be surrounded by so many—is incredible. Olive ridley turtles, like all marine turtles, are threatened with extinction because of us."|"What the Future Looks Like"|"Jim Al-Khalili"
"< 06:00"|"almost 6 am"|"It is fully light now, almost 6 am . Jairo is tired but smiling. The beach we’ve had all to ourselves is about to be invaded. “Our” turtle has finished laying her eggs—she carefully covers them with sand and lumbers down to the shore, returning with the other mothers to the ocean, having each played their part in the continuation of their species. I feel ridiculously proprietorial about this beautiful place, having watched its sands fill with turtles and witnessed the private efforts of a mother birthing the next generation, as night turned to day. From the village end of the beach, I see a band of about forty people approaching, carrying large rice sacks and baskets."|"What the Future Looks Like"|"Jim Al-Khalili"
20:06|2006|"Not so long ago, even analyzing DNA—let alone sequencing whole genomes—meant using large, expensive machines, housed in dedicated laboratories. The draft sequence of the human genome famously took fifteen months and cost around $300 million in the year 2000. By 2006, a draft of an individual’s genome cost $14 million. Ten years after that, it cost about $1,500 and could be completed within two days. Now, sequencing is beginning to break out of laboratories, and even out of the hands of geneticists. Rather than requiring massive machinery, the new sequencers can fit inside your pocket. These devices cannot yet map your entire genome, but watch this space. Right now, they are being developed  to study those genes known to be important for particular reasons, and doing so in real time. Recent innovations can detect genomic data, for example, of a bacterium, or strain of virus infecting a person. This is already showing promise for public health challenges in the places they are needed the most. In West Africa, one such portable sequencing machine was used to successfully identify 148 Ebola virus genomes from patients. In the field, in future, this type of miniature, user-friendly genomic technology aims to diagnose within hours, and guide the treatment of viral infections such as corona, dengue, Ebola, chikungunya, and Zika. Technology like this may one day be in everyone’s pocket much like a mobile phone."|"What the Future Looks Like"|"Jim Al-Khalili"
"ap 06:53"|"6 hours 53 minutes"|"One hot day in the Mojave Desert in Nevada in 2005, a Volkswagen Touareg car without a driver shimmered into the history books, scooping up a $2 million prize. It was the first vehicle to cross the finish line in the DARPA grand challenge, a 132-mile desert road race that took the car, named Stanley, 6 hours 53 minutes 08 seconds to complete. Another five autonomous vehicles rolled over the finish line within minutes of each other."|"What the Future Looks Like"|"Jim Al-Khalili"
