00:00|midnight|"That made a sort of sense, Agnes admitted, as she followed Magrat and the maids to the hall. In Lancre, you named children at midnight, so that they started a day with a new name. She didn’t know why it made sense. It just felt as though, once, someone had found that it worked. Lancrastrians never threw away anything that worked. The trouble was, they seldom changed anything that worked, either."|"Carpe Jugulum"|"Terry Pratchett"

">> 00:00"|"well after midnight"|"They hurried into the hall. Even though it was now well after midnight, the noise level was approaching the pain threshold. When the midnight hour lies on the glass like a big cocktail onion, there’s always an extra edge to the laughter."|"Carpe Jugulum"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 03:00"|"Three o’clock"|"Nanny returned.
“Three o’clock?” said Agnes, before she opened her mouth.
“Just after.”"|"Carpe Jugulum"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 03:03"|"Three minutes after three"|"“Three minutes after three,” said Agnes, and felt the tension ease and the words form. “Threes, Nanny. She was thinking in threes.

The local coachmen used to warn visitors, you see. ‘Don’t go near the castle,’ they’d say. ‘Even if it means spending a night up a tree, never go up there to the castle,’ they’d tell people. ‘Whatever you do, don’t set foot in that castle.’ He said it was marvelous publicity. Sometimes he had every bedroom full by nine P.M. and people would be hammering on the door to get in. Travelers would go miles out of their way to see what all the fuss was about. We won’t see his like again, with any luck. He did rather play to the crowd, I’m afraid. Rose from the grave so often that he had a coffin with a revolving lid. Ah…Aunt Carmilla…”"|"Carpe Jugulum"|"Terry Pratchett"

That was when the Re-United Free Chelonianists (Hubward Convocation) split from the Re-United Free Chelonianists (Rimward Convocation). It was rather serious.”"|"Carpe Jugulum"|"Terry Pratchett"
