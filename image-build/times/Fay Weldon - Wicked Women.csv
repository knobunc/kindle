And each stroke sounding its annual dirge to lost hope and failing passion: its welcome to the triumph of boredom and the death of the soul."|"Wicked Women"|"Fay Weldon"

Poor Bessie was forgotten: she could hardly get to the piano: Lucy and Pierre were always there, as she worked to catch the notes between notes he found so significant he could make them include the whole universe. Edwin was on the last chapter of a novel: a time he found particularly tense. There was to be piano-playing only between two and four o’clock of an afternoon. He said so with some force. The house trembled. People wept."|"Wicked Women"|"Fay Weldon"

In the mornings, thus freed from practice, Lucy and Pierre had walked in the woods, and talked about music, and presently love, and then more than talked, and Pierre had explained to Lucy how unhappy she was, and how her way of life stifled her, and how he could not be a great artist without her, and Bessie had seen them in the woods and Lucy had forged one of Edwin’s cheques and paid both their passages over; and left Edwin a note and was gone; taking her jewellery because Pierre said she must, and the way not to think about any of it was to be in bed with Pierre. They had scarcely left the cabin on the way over: they had been the talk of the ship and she hadn’t cared. To fly in the face of all things respectable intensified the pleasure she had with Pierre: what was forbidden was sweet: she hoped they would never reach Paris, where everyone felt as she and Pierre did, but of course that was silly of her: what was forbidden could not be kept up for long and in any case had to be sandwiched between the permitted in order to count—why had there been no one to stop her? If you were a child wasn’t that what happened? That someone stopped you? She’d relied on Edwin for that all her grown life, but since she couldn’t tell him about Pierre how could he have helped her? But she blamed him because he hadn’t, because he’d been so busy with his book he hadn’t even noticed the time she was spending with Pierre: it was Edwin’s fault she had left."|"Wicked Women"|"Fay Weldon"

She took half a second off her best time, came in first, and only then did she fly out, and her brother was dead when she arrived. “But you’re glad he’s dead,” observed Gosling when she cried. “Don’t be so hypocritical,” and he was right, she was, because the epileptic fits had frightened her when she was a child. The writhing, the jerking, the foaming; somewhere in her mind between sex and swimming; something to be ashamed of: something to be admitted to boyfriends, and be ashamed of being ashamed."|"Wicked Women"|"Fay Weldon"

Four of them lived in a suite with three bathrooms and only just enough space in which to stretch their embryo personalities and their squalor: their blackish shirts, their jewellery, hairsprays, overstretched tights, cigarette papers, bondage gear, the knickers of their groupies which they kept as souvenirs, the instruments which they claimed they never let out of their sight but frequently did. Philippa would somehow have to get them to their photo call by two o’clock. They were pleasant enough lads, not very bright, who felt it commercially prudent to act drunk, high and rude.

There was turkey for the carnivores, and nut-roast for the others, with a rich plum and chestnut sauce to go with it, to prove vegetarians can be indulgent too, not to mention sensuous, should ritual so demand. There were crackers on the table, and paper hats, and the scent of incense to remind everyone that the Hindu, the Buddhist and the Christian gods (did not the Trinity make three?) come from the same source, are of the same oneness. The Andrews were the kind who normally went to church once a year, to midnight service on Christmas Eve. But not this year."|"Wicked Women"|"Fay Weldon"
