We lose a few there in about sixteen spectacular highway deaths between Friday, 4:30 P.M., and seven minutes after midnight on Saturday. A portion of them never make it back to that dreamland they loved so much but had to leave—the one they can’t wait to get back to when the plant or mill or factory closes on Friday—because they get caught up in the turn-offs every time,” the dude said. He shrugged. “I don’t know where they end up. But maybe they roam the interstates forever, growing their gardens on the shoulders of the road.”"|"M.C. Higgins, the Great"|"Virginia Hamilton"

12:00|midday|"Jones Higgins was about to die from exhaustion and from the searing midday heat. He threw down the bike with a loud clatter, as if he couldn’t stand to touch it a second longer, as though its rusted, twisted metal was poker hot. The bicycle chain jumped off its track on impact. But Jones didn’t stop. He peeled off his shirt and overalls once he was moving on the path through the sweetbrier. He glanced back at the stricken bike and cursed with all of the meanness he had in him after a morning at the mill."|"M.C. Higgins, the Great"|"Virginia Hamilton"
"ap > 04:30"|"a little after 4:30"|"Jones had come home from work a little after 4:30. He had worked a full day. But the foreman at the mill had told him, no use for him to come back before next week since everybody in the yard felt strong and there probably would be no sickness before then. Jones would have no work for the rest of this week."|"M.C. Higgins, the Great"|"Virginia Hamilton"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"He gave the children a bunch of pennies he had in his pockets. Shyly they took the money; then they raced down the side of Sarah’s to reach the big five and dime in town before its six o’clock Monday closing."|"M.C. Higgins, the Great"|"Virginia Hamilton"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"“Well, from September to the end of May,” she said slowly, “I get out of school at two o’clock. I go to this center where they gave me a job in the offices.

"> 12:00"|"after noon"|"“He’ll be back after noon,” M.C. said quietly. Jones’s yodel had come from around Hall Mountain. “He’s going into town.”"|"M.C. Higgins, the Great"|"Virginia Hamilton"
12:00|noon|"M.C. couldn’t understand her. Right outside was a lake full of food. Bullheads and sunfish for whoever came early enough after first light and before swimming started. Even at noon anyone with a pole and a line and time to spare could catch something. He and his family never did any fishing. For them to resort to it for food was unheard of. Water was the opposite of land, which they possessed and loved. The lake was amusement, relaxation. But for her, he thought of fishing and looked around the tent for a pole and hooks. He found none."|"M.C. Higgins, the Great"|"Virginia Hamilton"
12:00|noon|"The noon mill whistle rose on the air, screaming soft and far and then loud and near. The sound of it wavered on air currents, echoing, bouncing off hills, until it died."|"M.C. Higgins, the Great"|"Virginia Hamilton"
12:00|noon|"“Ought to have better sense than to be caught out there at the top of noon,” Jones told him. He picked up the towel and came back to watch at the open door."|"M.C. Higgins, the Great"|"Virginia Hamilton"
12:00|Noon|"“Oh, well. Now this one,” Killburn said, “I call him March Noon because that was the time I first caught him—he gave me several nightmares. You see, the green-grass is pure pleasure to people. Put him on your pillow when you’re feeling sick, and he will lick away the fever. He will bring you the prettiest dreams.”"|"M.C.

"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"M.C. had awakened to find it was hours past midnight. Shocked, with his hands trembling, he had straightened the clothes he had slept in and rushed out to the privie on that side of Sarah’s away from the path. Later he had run back through the parlor and into the kitchen, where he found Banina. Wet weeds had soaked his pant legs and now they felt uncomfortably cold around his bare ankles."|"M.C. Higgins, the Great"|"Virginia Hamilton"
"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"The children had another fender, a motor and part of a crankshaft dragged over to the growing mound by the time Jones came up the side of Sarah’s about noon. He spied them working at something as the mill whistle blew for lunch. The whistle was a dull scream on the heavy air. The children and M.C. hardly noticed it; they didn’t hear Jones coming at all."|"M.C. Higgins, the Great"|"Virginia Hamilton"
