"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"I began writing Sister after my youngest child started at school full time. I drop my two boys at school then race back to the house and write as much as I can by three o’clock. I’m lucky that my children ask ‘how many words today, Mum?’ rather than ‘what’s for supper?’, as writing has led to domestic chaos. During the holidays family and friends rally round and I write in the evenings, sometimes into the night."|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
15:30|"3.30 p.m."|"Of course I don’t tell Mr Wright any of this. I just tell him Mum phoned me on the 26th of January at 3.30 p.m. New York time and told me you’d gone missing. Like you, he’s interested in the big picture, not tiny details. Even as a child  your paintings were large, spilling off the edge of the page, while I did my careful drawings using pencil and ruler and eraser. Later, you painted abstract canvasses, expressing large truths in bold splashes of vivid colour, while I was perfectly suited to my job in corporate design, matching every colour in the world to a pantone number. Lacking your ability with broad brushstrokes, I will tell you this story in accurate dots of detail. I’m hoping that like a pointillist painting the dots will form a picture and when it is completed we will understand what happened and why."|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
06:00|"six in the morning"|"I rented a car. It was only six in the morning but the traffic was already heavy on the M4 into London; the frustrated, angry crawl of the absurdly named rush hour, made even slower because of the snow. We were going straight to the police station. I couldn’t make the heater work and our words were spoken puffs hanging briefly in the cold air between us. ‘Have you already talked to the police?’ I asked."|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
"ap 07:30"|"seven thirty"|"It was seven thirty but still winter-dark when we arrived at the Notting Hill police station. The roads were jammed but the newly gritted pavements were almost empty. The only time I’d been in a police station before was to report the loss of my mobile phone; it hadn’t even been stolen. I never went past the reception area. This time I was escorted behind reception into an alien world of interview rooms and cells and police wearing belts loaded with truncheons and handcuffs. It had no connection to you."|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
14:00|"two p.m."|"‘A lady working at the post office on Exhibition Road remembers Tess buying a card and also air-mail stamps, some time before two p.m. She didn’t say Tess was pregnant, but  I suppose there was a counter between them so she wouldn’t have seen.’"|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
"ap 02:15"|"two fifteen"|"‘Tess posted the card from the same post office some time before two fifteen.’"|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
"ap 06:30"|"Six thirty"|"‘What time did you leave the police station?’
‘Six thirty. Mum had left an hour earlier.’
"|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
22:20|"10.20 p.m."|"At 10.20 p.m. I watched the TV reconstruction on your sofa, pulling your Indian throw over me in a futile effort to keep warm. From a distance, I really was quite a convincing you. At the end there was an appeal for information and a number to ring."|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
23:30|"11.30 p.m."|"At 11.30 p.m. I picked up the phone to check it was working. Then I panicked that in that moment of checking someone had been trying to ring: you, or the police to tell me you’d been found."|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
00:30|"12.30 a.m."|"
12.30 a.m. Nothing.
"|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
01:00|"1.00 a.m."|"
1.00 a.m. I felt the surrounding quietness suffocating me.
"|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
01:30|"1.30 a.m."|"1.30 a.m. I heard myself shout your name. Or was your name buried in the silence?"|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
02:00|"2.00 a.m."|"2.00 a.m. I heard something by the door. I hurried to open it but it was just a cat, the stray you’d adopted months before. The milk in the fridge was over a week old and sour. I had nothing to stop its cries."|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
04:30|"4.30 a.m."|"At 4.30 a.m. I went into your bedroom, squeezing past your easel and stacks of canvasses. I cut my foot and bent down to find shards of glass. I drew back the bedroom curtains and  saw a sheet of polythene taped over the broken windowpane. No wonder it was freezing in the flat."|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
04:30|"four thirty in the morning"|"You phoned me in the middle of the night, forgetting or not caring about the time difference. Todd woke up and took the call. Annoyed, he passed the phone to me, mouthing, ‘It’s four thirty in the morning for chrissakes.’"|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
"ap ~ 04:00"|"around four"|"‘Where?’
‘Hyde Park. We were together till around four.’
That was two hours after you were seen in the post office. He must have been the last person to see you."|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
03:40|"3.40 a.m."|"The car clock showed 3.40 a.m. when I arrived. I remember because it was no longer the day you were found, it was the day after. Already you were going into the past. People think it’s reassuring to say ‘life carries on’, don’t they understand that it’s the fact your life carries on, while the person you love’s does not, that is one of the acute anguishes of grief? There would be day after day that wasn’t the day you were found; that hope, and my life with my sister in it, had ended."|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
"ap < 07:00"|"nearly seven"|"‘Shall we end it there?’ asks Mr Wright. I glance at the clock; it’s nearly seven. I am grateful to him for letting me finish the day you were found."|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
00:00|Midnight|"I waited in their front garden. It grew dark and icily cold. In this stranger’s snowy garden, with nothing familiar around me, I had Christmas carols playing silently in my head. You always liked the jolly ones, ‘Ding Dong Merrily on High’; ‘We Three Kings from Orient Far’; ‘God Rest ye Merry Gentlemen’; singing about parties and presents and having a good time. I’ve always gone for the quiet reflective ones, ‘Silent Night’; ‘It Came Upon a Midnight Clear’. This time it was ‘In the deep midwinter/Frosty wind made moan/ Earth stood hard as iron/ Water like a stone.’ I’d never realised that it was a song of the bereaved."|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
"ap 05:15"|"five fifteen"|"‘Yes, a junior of DS Finborough’s. He was polite but I knew it would do no good. The man following her was her murderer but he could also have been a product of her supposed paranoia. The facts which pointed to murder also backed up the diagnosis of psychosis.’
Mr Wright looks at his watch, five fifteen. ‘Shall we call it a day?’
I nod. Somewhere at the back of my nose and throat linger the remembered particles of dope and aftershave and I am grateful that I can go outside and breathe the fresh air first hand."|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
"< 00:00"|"almost midnight"|"I get home from the Coyote at almost midnight and don’t expect many, if any, press. It’s too late and in any case after the frenzy of the last few days they must have got all the pictures and footage they need. But I was wrong; as I get near I see there’s a gang of them, their huge lights shining, and illuminated in the middle is Kasia. She’s been at a friend’s house for the last two days, until I thought the press attack would have died down enough for her to return. She’s living with me now, which I think you’re pleased about but curious about how we fit. Well, she has your bed and I have a futon in the sitting room, which I unroll out each night, and we somehow squash in."|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
"ap 02:30"|"Two thirty"|"The receptionist glanced at me. ‘What time did you say your appointment was?’
‘Two thirty.’
‘You were fortunate Dr Nichols made a space to see you.’"|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"I wasn’t avoiding you, I was just in a meeting that ran on. Don’t read anything into this shrink business. It’s just a case of when in New York, do as New Yorkers . . . It must be past midnight in London so go home and get some sleep."|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"As I walked to his room I remembered our phone call that evening (my time; two in the morning your time). I still didn’t tell you why I wanted to see a psychiatrist but you explained why you didn’t think it was useful."|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
09:00|"nine a.m."|"‘There isn’t any history. When was her appointment with you?’
‘The twenty-third of January. At nine a.m.’
He hadn’t consulted his diary or looked at his computer.  He had come prepared for this meeting, of course he had. He’d probably been on the phone all morning to his medical defence union. I saw in his face a beat of some genuine emotion. I wondered if it was fearfulness for himself, or genuine upset about you."|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
08:00|"eight a.m."|"‘This bill was larger than previous months. It was itemised  so I decided to check it.’ My words are slower, dawdling. ‘I saw that she’d phoned my mobile on the twenty-first of January. The call was at one p.m. her time, eight a.m. New York time, so I would have been in the subway getting to work. I don’t know why there was even a few seconds connection.’ I must do this all in one go, no pausing, or I won’t be able to start again. ‘It was the day she had Xavier. She must have phoned me when she went into labour.’"|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
21:00|"nine p.m."|"I break off for just a moment, not looking at Mr Wright’s face, then continue, ‘Her next call to me was at nine p.m. her time four p.m. New York time.’"|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
16:00|"four p.m."|"I break off for just a moment, not looking at Mr Wright’s face, then continue, ‘Her next call to me was at nine p.m. her time four p.m. New York time.’"|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
09:00|"9.00 a.m."|"As soon as it was 9.00 a.m. I picked up the phone and dialled the police station."|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"‘No, he told me it was after she’d got one of those calls. The day she was murdered, she phoned me at ten o’clock, which must be when she got home from her psychiatrist. And then every half an hour until one thirty when she must have left to go to the post office and to meet Simon in Hyde Park.’"|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"

06:30|"6.30 a.m."|"I’d phoned the hospital at 6.30 a.m. that morning and a sympathetic woman doctor had taken my call, unperturbed by how early it was. She suggested that I came in when they ‘opened for business’ later that morning."|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
"~ 16:00"|"about four in the afternoon"|"‘I’ll start by recapping what you’ve told me so far about Kasia Lewski,’ he says, looking down at typed notes, which must be a transcript of an earlier part of my statement. He reads out, ‘“Kasia Lewski came to Tess’s flat on the twenty-seventh of January at about four in the afternoon asking to see her.”’"|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"‘Oh yes of course. It’s in Little Hadston, near Cambridge on Thursday the fifteenth February at eleven o’clock.’"|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
23:30|"eleven thirty p.m."|"‘And you phoned DS Finborough at eleven thirty p.m.?’ he asks, looking down at the police call log."|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
"ap 09:30"|"nine thirty"|"‘Yes. I left a message for him asking him to phone me back. By nine thirty the next morning he still hadn’t, so I went to St Anne’s.’"|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
"ap 05:30"|"five thirty"|"This morning I have woken up ludicrously early. Pudding is a furry, purring cushion on my legs (I never used to understand why you took in a stray). Mr Wright told me that that today we are going to ‘cover’ your funeral and at five thirty I give up on the idea of sleep and go out into your garden. I ought to go through it in my mind first, make sure I can remember what’s important, but my thoughts flinch when I try to look backwards with any focus. Instead I look at the leaves and buds now flourishing along the lengths of the once-presumed-dead twigs. But there has been one fatality I’m afraid. The Constance Spry rose was killed by a fox urinating, so in her place I’ve planted a Cardinal Richelieu. No fox would dare to wee on him."|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
10:55|"10.55 a.m."|"At 10.55 a.m. we walked to the church, the wind blowing the driving cold rain against our faces and our legs, making Mum’s black skirt stick coldly to her damp tights, my black boots were splattered in mud. But I was glad it was raining and windy, ‘blow winds and crack your cheeks’; yes I know, this was hardly a blasted heath but Little Hadston on a Thursday morning with cars parked two deep along the road to the church."|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"

12:00|"twelve that day"|"It was the morning rush hour and the tube was packed. As I stood squashed up against other commuters I remembered, appalled, the note I’d put up on the college notice board asking your friends to meet me. In the turmoil after your funeral I’d somehow forgotten. It was at twelve that day. I felt far more apprehensive about that than my meeting with Professor Rosen."|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
"ap < 09:00"|"just before 9"|"At just before 9.30 a.m. I arrived at the Gene-Med building - ten storeys high in glass with transparent lifts going up the outside like bubbles in sparkling mineral water. Light tubes encircled the building with purple and blue bolts of light shooting around its circumference; ‘science fiction becomes science fact’ seemed to be the message."|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
"ap > 01:30"|"past one thirty"|"I saw compassion on some faces as they looked at me, and its poorer cousin pity on others. And then it was ‘already past one thirty’ and ‘classes start in ten minutes’ and they were leaving."|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
20:20|"8.20 p.m."|"The last message on the B side was on Tuesday, 21 January at 8.20 p.m. Just a few hours after you’d had Xavier."|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
"> 00:00"|"just after midnight"|"At just after midnight, the doorbell rang and I hurried to answer it, hoping that it would be Kasia. When I saw her standing on the doorstep I didn’t see her tarty clothes and cheap hair colour only the bruises on her face and the welts on her arms."|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
"ap 00:00"|twelve|"‘Yes, but I have to pick up his brother at twelve. Do you mind if I . . .’ She gestured to the ironing board and laundry basket in the kitchen."|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"By the time I got to St Anne’s Hospital from Hattie’s house in Chiswick, it was late, past midnight. But I had to find out  straight away. When I arrived the wards were in darkness and I realised this wasn’t the most sensible time to start asking questions. But I’d already pressed the buzzer on the maternity ward door, and a nurse I didn’t recognise was opening it. She looked at me suspiciously and I remembered the security was to stop babies being stolen."|Sister|"Rosamund Lupton"
"ap ~ 10:15"|"around ten fifteen"|"‘And the next day you got an email from Professor Rosen?’ Mr Wright asks.
‘Yes. On Saturday morning at around ten fifteen.’

But there are other strands that link us, that wouldn’t be seen by even the strongest of electron microscopes.
