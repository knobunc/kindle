"ap 04:30"|"half past four"|"Han took a deep breath. After all that fuss, he’d gone and left his caf in the front room. He sat on the bed, adjusting Ben in his arms. No way was he going back out there. Not even for caf. And anyway, the bed was so comfortable. Leia had been up late the night before going over some boring statistical analysis of crop production on Yavin 4 and Han had volunteered to keep Ben out of her hair, partially just to preempt any kind of, Force forbid, conversation about agriculture.

Something gleamed in the midday sun. It looked, Lando thought, like—
A dull thud brought the Chevalier into a skidding spiral across an invisible surface crescenting through the sky. Alarms blurted out as the forest spun beneath them, then the fortress itself."|"Last Shot"|"Daniel Jose Older"
"ap 00:30"|"Half of one"|"“Dammit.”
Was that a gun turret? Half of one anyway? Sure looked like it.
An idea nudged its way through the clutter of Han’s mind."|"Last Shot"|"Daniel Jose Older"

"ap 09:13"|"nine thirteen"|"In fact, now that DRX thought about it, they should’ve already zipped past. He’d been standing at the rail of his favorite platform for exactly fourteen minutes and twenty-nine seconds. It was nine thirteen."|"Last Shot"|"Daniel Jose Older"
