"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"Her mother Jewel was on a late mission, planting orange sapphires in a stratum near the surface. It was a long way away, so she rode the Diggle-worm, who could tunnel through rock without leaving a hole. They would be back after midnight. That meant several more hours, and Tandy was afraid."|"Ogre, Ogre"|"Piers Anthony"
00:00|midnight|"Tandy saw the creature clearly in her dream: a midnight-colored equine with faintly glowing eyes--there was the demon stigma!--set amidst a flaring forelock. The mane was glossy black, and the tail dark ebony; even the hooves were dusky. Yet she was a handsome animal, with fine features and good musculature. The black ears perked forward, the black nostrils flared, and the dark neck arched splendidly. Tandy knew this was an excellent representative of the species."|"Ogre, Ogre"|"Piers Anthony"
12:00|noontime|"The little girl's eyes brightened like noontime patches of clear sky. She squiggled with excitement. ""Oh, thank you, Gorgon. I'm almost sorry to leave, but I really should return home. My mother is getting tired of only seeing me in the magic mirror. What is my Answer?"""|"Ogre, Ogre"|"Piers Anthony"
12:00|noon|"By noon they were in rougher territory. Sweaters swarmed about them, causing them to perspire, until Smash got fed up and issued a bellowing roar that blew them all away. Unfortunately, it also blew the leaves off the nearest trees, and several more tatters from Tandy's dress."|"Ogre, Ogre"|"Piers Anthony"
12:00|noon|"Smash used his gauntleted fists to break out sections of rock, making crude steps for the others. Fortunately, the really steep part was not extensive, and by noon they stood at the top."|"Ogre, Ogre"|"Piers Anthony"
"~ 12:00"|"Around midday"|"Around midday they discovered a lovely vegetable tree, on whose branches grew cabbages, beans, carrots, tomatoes, and turnips, all in fine states of ripeness. Here were all the ingredients for an excellent salad! But as Smash approached it, Tandy grew nervous. ""I smell a rat,"" she said, sniffing the air. ""There are big rats down in the caves where I live; I know their odor well. They always mean trouble."""|"Ogre, Ogre"|"Piers Anthony"
00:00|midnight|"It was a huge, standing, wingless horse, midnight black of hide, with eyes that glinted black, too. This was surely the Night Stallion--the creature he had come to settle with, the ruler of the nightmare world."|"Ogre, Ogre"|"Piers Anthony"
00:00|midnight|"The midnight orbs seemed to glitter ominously. Trojan did not like being threatened!"|"Ogre, Ogre"|"Piers Anthony"
