03:00|"3 a.m."|"‘Mrs Nugent says all that sort of thing is tampering with the occult,’ said Wobbler. Mrs Nugent was the Johnsons’ next door neighbour, and known to be unreasonable on subjects like Madonna played at full volume at 3 a.m."|"Johnny and the Dead"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 06:00"|"Six o’clock"|"‘Tell you what,’ said Johnny. ‘Let’s meet up later, then. Six o’clock. We can meet at Bigmac’s place. That’s right near the cemetery, anyway.’"|"Johnny and the Dead"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 02:45"|2.45|"He looked at his clock radio. It said 2.45. There was no chance of going back to sleep. He tried Radio Blackbury."|"Johnny and the Dead"|"Terry Pratchett"
02:00|"2 a.m."|"He’d never really been happy about the radio, even when he was younger. It was the bane of his life. He suffered from education, and he’d never been able to remember all that ‘Foxtrot Tango Piper’ business – at least when he was, e.g., pelting down the street at 2 a.m. in pursuit of miscreants. He’d end up sending messages about ‘Photograph Teapot Psychological’. It had definitely blighted his promotion chances."|"Johnny and the Dead"|"Terry Pratchett"
"< 00:00"|"almost midnight"|"It was almost midnight. The dead met in the abandoned arcades of the shopping mall. The grilles were up and locked, but that doesn’t matter when you’re dead."|"Johnny and the Dead"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|Midnight|"The clock of the world turns under its own shadow. Midnight is a moving place, hurtling around the planet at a thousand miles an hour like a dark knife, cutting slices of daily bread off the endless loaf of Time."|"Johnny and the Dead"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"‘Very well. Where shall we go? Iceland? It’s not even midnight yet in Iceland.’"|"Johnny and the Dead"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap < 11:00"|"nearly eleven"|"It had been quite busy after the meeting. Someone from the Blackbury Guardian had talked to him, and then Mid-Midlands TV had filmed him, and people had shaken his hand, and he hadn’t got home until nearly eleven."|"Johnny and the Dead"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|Midnight|"‘What time is it?’
‘Midnight!’
Johnny was a sort of hero in school. The Blackbury Guardian had a front page story headed: COUNCIL SLAMMED IN CEMETERY SALE RUMPUS. The Guardian often used words like ‘slammed’ and ‘rumpus’; you wondered how the editor talked at home."|"Johnny and the Dead"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|Midnight|"By the time they raced one another across the heart of Australia, they didn’t even need the radio. The dawn dragged its slow way across the Pacific after them, but they were running free. ‘Do we ever need to stop?’ ‘No!’ ‘I always wanted to see the world before I died!’ ‘Well, then, it was just a matter of timing.’ ‘What time is it?’ ‘Midnight!’"|"Johnny and the Dead"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"There were other people there, too, although in the semi-darkness it was hard to make out who they thought they were. There was someone with a lot of stitches and a bolt through his neck, but that was only Nodj, who looked like that anyway. There were a bunch from Wobbler’s computer group, who could get drunk on non-alcoholic alcohol and would then stagger around saying things like, ‘I’m totally mad!’ There were a couple of girls Wobbler vaguely knew. It was that sort of party. You just knew someone would put something daft in the punch, and everyone would talk about school, and one of the girls’ dads’d turn up at eleven o’clock and hang around looking determined and put a damper on things, as if they weren’t soaking wet already."|"Johnny and the Dead"|"Terry Pratchett"
"< 00:00"|"nearly midnight"|"‘Come on, the railings have been knocked down.’
‘But it’s nearly midnight! And there’s dead people in there!’
‘Well? We’re all dead, sooner or later.’"|"Johnny and the Dead"|"Terry Pratchett"

21:00|"nine o’clock in the evening"|"
It was nine o’clock in the evening, in Blackbury High Street.
It was dark, with occasional light from the full moon behind streamers of worn-out cloud. The wind was from the south-west and there had been another thunderstorm, which freshened the air and made the cobbles slippery."|"Johnny and the Dead"|"Terry Pratchett"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"‘It’s two in the morning and it’s been pissing down,’ said the soldier. ‘Who’s going to steal an unexploded bomb?’"|"Johnny and the Dead"|"Terry Pratchett"
21:00|"nine o’clock in the evening"|"The policeman ran after him and was halfway up the ruins of Paradise Street before the world behind him suddenly became full of excitement.
It was nine o’clock in the evening, in Blackbury High Street.
In the window of the electrical shop, nine TVs showed the same picture. Nine televisions projected their flickering screens at the empty air."|"Johnny and the Dead"|"Terry Pratchett"
