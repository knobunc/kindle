"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"I had never been in a train that moved so slowly. It made the trip especially strange, this ponderous movement. After three hours the train seemed not clumsy and old anymore but venerable and important, and the image of the bush as an ocean that had come to me earlier was part of it, the train like an old vessel plowing this ocean. It stopped often and everywhere, not always at a station or a platform but in the middle of nowhere, in the yellowy bush, the spindly tree limbs stuck against the window, and the wall of foliage so close that the locomotive's racket echoed against it. There seemed no point in these stops, fifteen or twenty of them before noon, and several times the train hesitated, rolled backwards for half a minute, lurched, and then started up again. I was not dismayed. Like the slow speed, the sudden stops and reverses made the whole business odd and agreeable."|"My Other Life"|"Paul Theroux"
13:00|"one that afternoon"|"At one that afternoon we came to the town of Balaka, where dogs slept in the middle of the street. Balaka, a railway junction (another line went to Fort Johnston and Monkey Bay), was hotter and flatter than any place I had ever seen. Walking along the platform to ask the conductor what time we were leaving (""Not before tree,"" he said), I saw that one of the forward coaches had a good paint job and shuttered windows. A shutter rose as I watched and a small blue-eyed child looked out—it could only have been a missionary's child—and I realized that I was looking at a first-class passenger. I had not known about first, the one good coach on the train, shutters down, doors locked."|"My Other Life"|"Paul Theroux"
"ap ~ 02:30"|"about two-thirty"|"The whistle blew at about two-thirty and after some hesitation—shunting in the Balaka tracks—the train set off again, north, through the dusty landscape of yellow bush and low skinny trees and the elephant grass that was taller than the Africans. On this blazing October afternoon there was no movement. Nothing stirred, no birds, no people, nor any animals. The bush was dead still and looked stifled of air. The train was the only moving thing in that whole hot world. We raised dust and smoke and noise, but after we passed—I could see out the back window of the rear coach—our commotion subsided and all was still again."|"My Other Life"|"Paul Theroux"
12:00|noon|"The sun had made an arc over the train, rising above the windowsill on the right when we left Blantyre, drumming on the metal roof of the coach at noon, and now it had slipped sideways again and was shining through the windows on the left-hand side. I nodded and dozed to the clanking of the wheels on the long, straight rails, hammering more insistently where the rails butted, and at each stop there was the clutch and clawing sound of the brakes, the screech of metal against metal."|"My Other Life"|"Paul Theroux"

Their house—and most of the buildings—were bare: no books on shelves, no pictures on the walls, nothing but the simplest chairs and tables. Except for the hymns in the church and the drumming in the leper village, which began after dark and continued until eleven or so, there was no music. In this atmosphere, Father DeVoss's deck of playing cards, especially the picture cards, seemed highly colored and evocative, and I found myself lingering and discerning expressions on the faces of the jack, queen and king—mockery, haughtiness, defiance."|"My Other Life"|"Paul Theroux"

My note, lettered in Chinyanja, said there would be an English class on Wednesday afternoon at five. It seemed to me an appropriate time. The lepers spent the morning lining up for medicine. It was too hot after lunch for a class. Life in the leprosarium resumed when the sun dipped below the treetops and the shadows lengthened. In the hottest, brightest part of the day, when the sun was overhead, life came to a stop and there was no one to be seen. People withdrew into their huts, where the dirt was damp and cool."|"My Other Life"|"Paul Theroux"
"ap 05:00"|five|"Several men were waiting for me at five. I knew they were lepers from their walking sticks and their bandages. Seeing me approach, some other men got up from under a tree and came over. That made eight. Then an old woman shuffled in, guided by a young girl. It was clear that the old woman was blind. One eye looked as though it had been badly sewn shut—an illusion of the lashes—and the other distorted and as glazed and marbled as an agate. This old blind woman and the young girl were the only females in the class. The girl was in her teens, barefoot, wearing a wraparound and a purple scarf on her head that made her seem exotic. She led the blind woman to a bench, then sat beside her and whispered while the blind woman made passes in the air with her damaged hand like a clumsy blessing."|"My Other Life"|"Paul Theroux"

At noon on Saturdays the silence was more pronounced. It was a large hole in the day and nothing followed it. The shop closed, the dispensary was locked, gardening ceased, the market emptied, and the women who sold bananas and peanuts and boiled potatoes and the black bony smoked fish that looked like shingles in stacks—these market women drifted away. Then the leprosarium, the village of pale mud huts, lay silently baking in the sun, and the only sounds were barks or cockcrows, no voices. Behind it all, like vibrant wires, the howl of locusts.
