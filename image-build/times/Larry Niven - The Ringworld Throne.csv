12:00|midday|"The traders pulled their cruisers into a triangle. Their midday dinner was fruit and roots from stores on the running boards. They cooked some local grass with the roots. They’d caught no fresh meat."|"The Ringworld Throne"|"Larry Niven"
12:00|midday|"At midday she woke ravenous, with the smell of roasting meat in her nostrils. She followed the smells down to the tent."|"The Ringworld Throne"|"Larry Niven"
12:00|midday|"She slept through the hunt. At midday she woke to share in the meal. Kaywerbrimmis bore a single slash along his forearm, the fool. Vala bound it with a fuel-soaked towel. Hakarrch meat had a flavor of cat."|"The Ringworld Throne"|"Larry Niven"
"ap 02:20"|"two hours, twenty minutes"|"“The warcraft are moving quite slowly. Let me show you fast-forward,” the Hindmost said. The warcraft moved briskly downslope. Beyond and below, cloudscape jumped into streamlined motion. “In two hours, twenty minutes at just under sonic speed, they had covered fourteen hundred miles. For kzinti, amazing restraint. Then they diverged, thus—”"|"The Ringworld Throne"|"Larry Niven"
"ap 02:00"|Two|"And it was across the Ringworld’s diameter. The Ringworld was sixteen light-minutes across. Sixteen minutes at lightspeed before a second Repair Center could see invading ships coming through Fist-of-God. Eight minutes more to begin to affect the sun. More time—an hour? Two?—to stretch a plume of plasma some millions of miles out from the sun, then cause it to lase. The terrible sword of light would be another eight minutes on its way."|"The Ringworld Throne"|"Larry Niven"
"ap 02:20"|"Two hours and twenty minutes"|"Two hours and twenty minutes was a plausible guess. Louis said, “Stet. You’d best assume there’s another Repair Center on the far side of the Ringworld Arch, and a protector inside.”"|"The Ringworld Throne"|"Larry Niven"
12:00|midday|"The third day carried them through Snowrunner’s Pass. The length of a daywalk varied by difficulty of the terrain, by altitude and slope and species; but Vala thought they’d covered two honest daywalks. They could reach the vampires’ refuge by midday tomorrow, if they were crazy enough to travel so directly."|"The Ringworld Throne"|"Larry Niven"
12:00|midday|"It had been raining since midday. Valavirgillin tried to find paths over bare rock, but there was mud everywhere. Tilting, skidding, never quite toppling over, the wagons moved downstream toward the Shadow Nest."|"The Ringworld Throne"|"Larry Niven"
12:00|midday|"It was midday. Valavirgillin kept a wary eye on the weather. If it got too dark, the vampires would be out and hunting."|"The Ringworld Throne"|"Larry Niven"
12:00|Noonday|"Noonday sun—of course—but it felt like noon, like he’d wasted half the day. He boarded his cargo stack and went up for a look around. There they were, instantly obvious: Comet Sawur leading a tail of children through the upstream arch."|"The Ringworld Throne"|"Larry Niven"

12:00|midday|"Gleaners had to sleep at night. All four looked alert enough now, at midday, the only members of the foray team who did. Vala set Manack and Coriack on guard. Then she crawled under an awning."|"The Ringworld Throne"|"Larry Niven"
12:00|midday|"They were done by midday. Barok and Forn began to gear up for their own journey."|"The Ringworld Throne"|"Larry Niven"
12:00|midday|"In the instant before he replied, Bram’s glance touched all their faces, judging, deciding. He said, “You may have each other until midday tomorrow. Louis, we should return to Needle soon. We can learn no more until we take the probe over the rim. Hindmost, is that why you let Louis wake?”"|"The Ringworld Throne"|"Larry Niven"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"The probe tilted over and rose at ten gravities straight up, closing on the rim wall. The blue highlight converged, then went out. The probe coasted, rising."|"The Ringworld Throne"|"Larry Niven"
