Marguerite"|"The Elusive Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"
"ap > 10:00"|"after ten o'clock"|"Robespierre did not swear. He never wasted either words or oaths, but he slipped the bit of paper inside the double lid of his silver snuff box and then he sent a special messenger to Citizen Chauvelin in the Rue Corneille, bidding him come that same evening after ten o'clock to room No. 16 in the ci-devant Palace of the Tuileries."|"The Elusive Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"
"ap 10:30"|"half-past ten"|"It was now half-past ten, and Chauvelin and Robespierre sat opposite one another in the ex-boudoir of Queen Marie Antoinette, and between them on the table, just below the tallow-candle, was a much creased, exceedingly grimy bit of paper."|"The Elusive Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"
"< 00:00"|"just before midnight"|"It all occurred just before midnight, in one of the smaller rooms, which lead in enfilade from the principal ballroom."|"The Elusive Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"
00:00|midnight|"And to-night after her guests had gone she threw open the great windows that gave on the beautiful terrace, with its marble steps leading down to the cool river beyond. Everything now seemed so peaceful and still; the scent of the heliotrope made the midnight air swoon with its intoxicating fragrance: the rhythmic murmur of the waters came gently echoing from below, and from far away there came the melancholy cry of a night-bird on the prowl."|"The Elusive Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"
00:00|midnight|"
""It is I... Desiree Candeille,"" replied the midnight prowler.
"|"The Elusive Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"
00:00|midnight|"""How do you know that?"" asked Marguerite, with her suspicions once more on the qui-vive. She could not understand Candeille's attitude. This midnight visit, the vehemence of her language, the strange mixture of knowledge and ignorance which she displayed. What did this woman know of Chauvelin's secret plans? Was she his open ally, or his helpless tool? And was she even now playing a part taught her or commanded her by that prince of intriguers?"|"The Elusive Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"
00:00|midnight|"Then all was still again. The gentle midnight breeze caressed the tops of the ancient oaks and elms behind her, drawing murmurs from their dying leaves like unto the whisperings of ghosts."|"The Elusive Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"
00:00|midnight|"Like a gigantic wave carried inwards by the tide, his turbulent emotion seemed suddenly to shatter itself against a rock of self-control. Was it a call from the boatmen below? a distant scrunching of feet upon the gravel?—who knows, perhaps only a sigh in the midnight air, a ghostly summons from the land of dreams that recalled him to himself."|"The Elusive Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"
"< 12:00"|"towards noon"|"From time to time the same kind and trembling hands would with gentle pressure force a little liquid food through her unwilling lips: some warm soup, or anon a glass of milk. Beyond the pain in her head, she was conscious of no physical ill; she felt at perfect peace, and an extraordinary sense of quiet and repose seemed to pervade this small room, with its narrow window through which the rays of the sun came gradually in more golden splendour as the day drew towards noon, and then they vanished altogether."|"The Elusive Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"
"ap > 10:00"|"After ten"|"She was quite unconscious what hour of the night it might be, but it must have been late, for the little town, encircled by the stony arms of its forts, seemed asleep. The moon, now slowly sinking in the west, edged the towers and spires with filmy lines of silver. To the right Marguerite caught sight of the frowning Beffroi, which even as she gazed out began tolling its heavy bell. It sounded like the tocsin, dull and muffled. After ten strokes it was still."|"The Elusive Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"
"ap 10:00"|"Ten o'clock"|"Ten o'clock! At this hour in far-off England, in fashionable London, the play was just over, crowds of gaily dressed men and women poured out of the open gates of the theatres calling loudly for attendant or chaise. Thence to balls or routs, gaily fluttering like so many butterflies, brilliant and irresponsible...."|"The Elusive Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o'clock"|"And in England also, in the beautiful gardens of her Richmond home, ofttimes at ten o'clock she had wandered alone with Percy, when he was at home, and the spirit of adventure in him momentarily laid to rest. Then, when the night was very dark and the air heavy with the scent of roses and lilies, she lay quiescent in his arms in that little arbour beside the river. The rhythmic lapping of the waves was the only sound that stirred the balmy air. He seldom spoke then, for his voice would shake whenever he uttered a word: but his impenetrable armour of flippancy was pierced through and he did not speak because his lips were pressed to hers, and his love had soared beyond the domain of speech."|"The Elusive Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o'clock"|"""The 'Day-Dream' could weigh anchor at eight o'clock... would an hour before that be convenient to yourself?"""|"The Elusive Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o'clock"|"""Certainly, Sir Percy... if you will honour me by accepting my hospitality in these uncomfortable quarters until seven o'clock to-morrow eve?..."""|"The Elusive Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o'clock"|"""That I accept your bargain, man!... Zounds! I tell you I accept... I'll write the letter, I'll sign it... an you have our free passes ready for us in exchange.... At seven o'clock to-morrow eve, did you say?... Man! do not look so astonished.... The letter, the signature, the money... all your witnesses... have everything ready.... I accept, I say.... And now, in the name of all the evil spirits in hell, let me have some supper and a bed, for I vow that I am demmed fatigued."""|"The Elusive Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"
12:00|midday|"As for the burghers and merchants of the town, they were at first content with reading an occasional article in the ""Gazette de Paris"" or the ""Gazette des Tribunaux,"" brought hither by one or other of the many travellers who crossed the city on their way to the harbour. They were interested in these articles, at times even comfortably horrified at the doings in Paris, the executions and the tumbrils, but on the whole they liked the idea that the country was in future to be governed by duly chosen representatives of the people, rather than be a prey to the despotism of kings, and they were really quite pleased to see the tricolour flag hoisted on the old Beffroi, there where the snow-white standard of the Bourbons had erstwhile flaunted its golden fleur-de-lis in the glare of the midday sun."|"The Elusive Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"
00:00|midnight|"Twice before the hour of midnight they heard that same quaint and merry laugh proceeding from the lighted room, through the open window. Once it sounded very low and very prolonged, as if in response to a delightful joke."|"The Elusive Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"
"ap 06:00"|six|"The towers and pinnacles of old Boulogne detached themselves one by one from the misty gloom of night. The old bell of the Beffroi tolled the hour of six. Soon the massive cupola of Notre Dame was clothed in purple hues, and the gilt cross on St. Joseph threw back across the square a blinding ray of gold."|"The Elusive Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o'clock"|"In the evening at a given hour—seven o'clock had Auguste Moleux, the town-crier, understood—the boom of the cannon would be heard, the gates of the town would be opened, the harbour would become a free port."|"The Elusive Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"
02:30|vigils|"By the time Auguste Moleux had cried out the news throughout the town, and pinned the new proclamation of mercy up on every public building, all traces of fatigue and anxiety had vanished. In spite of the fact that wearisome vigils had been kept in every home that night, and that hundreds of men and women had stood about for hours in the vicinity of the Gayole Fort, no sooner was the joyful news known, than all lassitude was forgotten and everyone set to with a right merry will to make the great fete-day a complete success."|"The Elusive Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"
"ap 06:00"|six|"Of a truth 'twas a motley throng which began to assemble on the Place de la Senechaussee, just as the old bell of the Beffroi tolled the hour of six. Men, women and children in ragged finery, Pierrots with neck frills and floured faces, hideous masks of impossible beasts roughly besmeared in crude colours. There were gaily-coloured dominoes, blue, green, pink and purple, harlequins combining all the colours of the rainbow in one tight-fitting garment, and Columbines with short, tarlatan skirts, beneath which peeped bare feet and ankles. There were judges' perruqes, and soldiers' helmets of past generations, tall Normandy caps adorned with hundreds of streaming ribbons, and powdered headgear which recalled the glories of Versailles."|"The Elusive Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o'clock"|"At seven o'clock, so 'twas said, the cannon would boom from the old Beffroi. The guard would throw open the prison gates, and those who had something or somebody to hide, and those who had a great deal to fear, would be free to go whithersoever they chose."|"The Elusive Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"
19:00|"seven o'clock this evening"|"""Well thought of, Citizen,"" said Chauvelin approvingly. ""I pray you give the necessary orders, that the horses be ready saddled, and the men booted and spurred, and waiting at the Gayole gate, at seven o'clock this evening."""|"The Elusive Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"
"ap 07:30"|"half-past seven"|"""Nay! the Englishman will have it ready by this evening, never fear. The tide is high at half-past seven, and he will be in haste for his wife to be aboard his yacht, ere the turn, even if he..."""|"The Elusive Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o'clock"|"Chauvelin had thought out this idea of having the Angelus rung to-night, and was thoroughly pleased with the notion. This was the day when the duel was to have been fought; seven o'clock would have been the very hour, and the sound of the Angelus to have been the signal for combat, and there was something very satisfying in the thought, that that same Angelus should be rung, as a signal that the Scarlet Pimpernel was withered and broken at last."|"The Elusive Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"
"ap 06:45"|"quarter before seven"|"
""A quarter before seven.""
"|"The Elusive Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"
"ap 06:45"|"three-quarters after six"|"This had occurred just as the bell of the old Beffroi chimed three-quarters after six. Now it was close on seven, and in the centre of the room and with his face and figure well lighted up by the candles, at the table pen in hand sat Sir Percy writing."|"The Elusive Pimpernel"|"Emmuska Orczy"
