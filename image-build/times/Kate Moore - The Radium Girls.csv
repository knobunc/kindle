17:00|"5 p.m."|"In September 1922, the peculiar infection that had plagued Mollie Maggia for less than a year spread to the tissues of her throat. The disease ‘slowly ate its way through her jugular
  vein’. On 12 September, at 5 p.m., her mouth was flooded with blood as she haemorrhaged so fast that Edith could not staunch it. Her mouth, empty of teeth, empty of jawbone, empty of words,
  filled with blood, instead, until it spilled over her lips and down her stricken, shaken face. It was too much. She died, her sister Quinta said, a ‘painful and terrible death’."|"The Radium Girls"|"Kate Moore"
12:00|noon|"At first, however, Marie wasn’t sure about staying there. ‘My first day at work,’ she recalled, ‘I said I didn’t like it . . . they learn you to put the thing in
  your mouth, that’s the first thing they taught you. I said when I went home at noon that I’d never come back [but] I went back the next morning. I didn’t like the work but I
  thought, “There’s money involved, see.” I just stayed.’ Those high wages were so hard to say no to."|"The Radium Girls"|"Kate Moore"
12:00|"twelve noon"|"Six weeks later, Irene Rudolph followed her to the grave. She died on 15 July 1923 at twelve noon, in Newark General Hospital, where she’d been admitted the day before. She was twenty-one. At the time of her death, the necrosis in her jaw was said to be ‘complete’. Her death was attributed to her work, but the cause was given as phosphorus
  poisoning; a diagnosis admitted by the attending physician to be ‘not decisive’."|"The Radium Girls"|"Kate Moore"

  a.m., at home, with her husband and mother by her side. She was twenty-five. By the time she died, her body was in such a distressing condition that the family would not allow her friends to see it
  at the funeral."|"The Radium Girls"|"Kate Moore"

  her coffin being lowered into the ground at Laurel Grove Cemetery, shortly after 2 p.m. on Saturday 20 June."|"The Radium Girls"|"Kate Moore"
03:00|"3 a.m."|"In the early hours of Boxing Day 1925, at the age of twenty-four, Marguerite followed her sister to that undiscovered country. She died at home on Main Street at 3 a.m.
  Her bones, Martland later said, showed ‘beautiful concentrations’ on the X-ray films that he wrapped around her in death."|"The Radium Girls"|"Kate Moore"
12:00|noon|"She tried to concentrate on her work all morning, but found it harder and harder. No parties for her this weekend, that was for sure. In fact, she thought suddenly, no work either. She was done
  in – and she was done for today. She took her tray of dials up to Mr Reed and said she had to go home sick. It was less than ten minutes before she was back on Clinton Street as the St
  Columba bells tolled the hour of noon. She told her mom she wasn’t feeling well and probably went to bed."|"The Radium Girls"|"Kate Moore"
00:00|Midnight|"Midnight, 3 September. Saturday night slipped into Sunday morning, and Ella’s condition declined. As she lay in bed, her system septic, her head swollen and black, her face unrecognisable,
  the poison in her body did its worst. At 4.30 a.m. on Sunday 4 September, her death came suddenly. She had been at work painting dials just the week before; all she’d had was a little spot on

  grave. They erected a tent over it and removed the headstone. Then they worked to uncover the coffin, heaving sodden earth out of the hole until they unveiled a nondescript wooden box, which held
  Amelia ‘Mollie’ Maggia – the girl, so they said, who had died of syphilis. The men ran ropes under it, then attached stronger silver chains. It was raised just slightly, ‘to
  free it from water that had seeped in around it as a result of the recent rains’."|"The Radium Girls"|"Kate Moore"

  now watched the company men closely as they milled outside the tent. At 3.30 p.m., as specified, Berry walked up to the grave with Mrs Hughes, Dr Martland and a cohort of New York doctors, who
  would lead on conducting the autopsy. There were thirteen officials in all, gathered together to witness Mollie’s exhumation."|"The Radium Girls"|"Kate Moore"
16:50|"4.50 p.m."|"They removed her carefully from her coffin, placed her gently in a wooden box, and then took her by automobile to a local undertaking parlour. At 4.50 p.m., her autopsy

11:30|"11.30 a.m."|"There were only a handful of other witnesses, including Katherine Wiley and Dr Flinn, who was there as a paid witness for USRC. And then, at 11.30 a.m. on 27 April 1928,
  Berry rested his case. Now, for the rest of the day and in subsequent days to follow, the United States Radium Corporation would have an opportunity to put their side of the story and then –
  then, the girls thought hopefully, wondering how they would feel when the time came – the verdict would be given."|"The Radium Girls"|"Kate Moore"
16:00|"4 p.m."|"With USRC now happy for the cogs to turn quickly, a meeting between Berry and the firm’s lawyers was held the next day, Friday 1 June, at 4 p.m. in Judge Clark’s chambers. Two hours
  later, Clark made a quick statement to the excitable press waiting outside as he ran to catch his evening train: ‘There is no definite news but I am confident that the matter will be
  definitely settled at a conference [on] Monday.’"|"The Radium Girls"|"Kate Moore"
10:00|"10 a.m."|"Monday 4 June would prove a hectic day. At 10 a.m., negotiations continued with the world’s press camped outside. When, after forty-five minutes, the lawyers exited Clark’s chambers,
  they had to use a rear stairway to escape the massed media."|"The Radium Girls"|"Kate Moore"
19:00|"7 p.m."|"The formal announcement of the settlement came from Judge Clark himself at 7 p.m. By now, a crowd of perhaps three hundred had gathered; ‘all aisles and passageways to the elevators were
  jammed’. Clark fought his way through the crowds to a good vantage point, from which he could break the news. He cleared his throat and asked for silence, which fell in a soft hush,
  broken only by the pop of flashbulbs and the papery whisper of pen on pad. Once he had the full attention of the press, the judge announced the exact terms of the deal.
  ‘You can say, if you want to,’ he added unctuously, ‘that the judge did a good job.’"|"The Radium Girls"|"Kate Moore"
02:10|"2.10 a.m."|"At 2.10 a.m. on 14 August 1929, Margaret Looney died. This girl, who was to marry Chuck next year, who loved to read the dictionary, who had once had dreams to be a teacher and was well known
  for her giggling fits, was no more."|"The Radium Girls"|"Kate Moore"
00:00|midnight|"The Looney family were already suspicious, given the Chicago doctor’s comments, that it was her work that had killed Peg. They readily agreed, on condition that their own family doctor

  breaking the speed limit, but the police let him go after they learned his mission."|"The Radium Girls"|"Kate Moore"
16:00|"4 p.m."|"Despite the consolation of her faith, however, she found her prognosis profoundly depressing. That old cine-reel from years gone by started up again in her mind, now with an ever-growing cast of
  ghost girls. Where Katherine had once gained relief from being in the sunshine, now, she said, she was ‘having difficulty with the light and sun up here on the roof’. ‘My
  head,’ she stammered, ‘had me full of fears – couldn’t tell if it was mental or real . . . I couldn’t stand the light in my eyes; was a wreck by 4 p.m.’ Perhaps
  all this was why she began to develop what she called ‘this craving of alcohol of mine’."|"The Radium Girls"|"Kate Moore"
21:00|"9 p.m."|"But Humphries had bad news for her. ‘There is no question of an amputation,’ he now said. Katherine and her leg had worsened of late and both were now in far too serious a state for
  such a major operation to be performed. Subsequently, Katherine took another slide downhill. On 18 February 1933, at 9 p.m., she died at the age of thirty."|"The Radium Girls"|"Kate Moore"
08:00|"8 a.m."|"The last came on 27 October 1933. She died at 8 a.m., a somewhat typically helpful time, ready for the doctors who were starting their day. It meant Dr Martland was able to attend her autopsy,
  to conduct his final careful consideration of this most special of patients. Grace’s death certificate stated she was killed by ‘radium sarcoma, industrial
  poisoning’. It was a fact, black and white: it was the radium industry that killed her. It was the company."|"The Radium Girls"|"Kate Moore"
09:00|"9 a.m."|"As she took in her surroundings, waiting for the trial to begin at 9 a.m., the press took in the sight of her. ‘Mrs Donohue,’ the Chicago
  Herald-Examiner later wrote, ‘could hardly stand alone. Her arms were no larger than a child’s and her face was drawn and pinched. Her dark eyes burned feverishly behind rimless
  glasses.’ The Times, somewhat unkindly, called her a ‘toothpick woman’."|"The Radium Girls"|"Kate Moore"
13:30|"1.30 p.m."|"The hearing resumed at 1.30 p.m. in Catherine’s absence. Having settled his wife at home, Tom had made his way back to the courthouse, wanting to represent Catherine at

  There was no time to tell the Donohues. Grossman managed to summon those few former dial-painters now living in Chicago – Charlotte Purcell
  and Helen Munch – and they alone were able to reach the hearing in time; it was held just before noon. Helen was nervously smoking a cigarette as they all crowded into the wood-panelled IIC
  room to hear the verdict. George Marvel’s judgment was read aloud by the chairman of the commission. Both Magid and Grossman stood to hear him speak; the two attorneys sized each other up as
  the chairman called for silence."|"The Radium Girls"|"Kate Moore"
