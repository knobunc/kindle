For two solid weeks the whole world was literally plastered with the announcement that at midnight on the thirty-fourth of Dreel—you’re familiar with our calendar, I think?—President Renwood would disappear. Two weeks warning—daring us to do our damndest.” Wainwright got that far and stopped."|"Children of the Lens"|"Edward E. Smith"
23:55|"five minutes before midnight"|"Upon that black day business had been suspended. No visitors of any sort had been permitted to enter the Reservation. No one had been allowed to approach Renwood except old and trusted officers about whose loyalty there could be no question. Air-ships and space-ships had filled the sky. Troops, armed with semi-portables or manning fixed-mount heavy stuff, had covered the grounds. At five minutes before midnight Renwood, accompanied by four secret-service men, had entered the vault, which was thereupon locked by the treasurer. All the cabinet members saw them go in, as did the attendant corps of specially-selected guards. Nevertheless, when the treasurer opened the vault at five minutes after midnight, the five men were gone. No trace of any one of them had been found from that time on."|"Children of the Lens"|"Edward E. Smith"

23:58|"two minutes before midnight"|"At two minutes before midnight the armored president and his escorts left Gerrond’s office. One minute later they were passing the door of the specified room. A bomb exploded shatteringly behind them, armored men rushed yelling out of a branch corridor in their rear. Everybody stopped and turned to look. So, the hidden Kinnison assured himself, did an unseen observer in an invisible hovering, three-dimensional hyper-circle."|"Children of the Lens"|"Edward E. Smith"
"ap 03:59"|"One of four"|"“My daughter,” Clarrissa mused, as much to herself as to Ladora. “One of four. The four dearest, finest, sweetest girls that ever lived.
