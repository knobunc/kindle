12:00|noon|"It was not yet noon on the second day of the New Yam Festival. Ekwefi and her only daughter, Ezinma, sat near the fireplace waiting for the water in the pot to boil. The fowl Ekwefi had just killed was in the wooden mortar. The water began to boil, and in one deft movement she lifted the pot from the fire and poured the boiling water over the fowl. She put back the empty pot on the circular pad in the corner, and looked at her palms, which were black with soot. Ezinma was always surprised that her mother could lift a pot from the fire with her bare hands."|"Things Fall Apart"|"Chinua Achebe"

12:00|noon-day|"And then quite suddenly a shadow fell on the world, and the sun seemed hidden behind a thick cloud. Okonkwo looked up from his work and wondered if it was going to rain at such an unlikely time of the year. But almost immediately a shout of joy broke out in all directions, and Umuofia, which had dozed in the noon-day haze, broke into life and activity."|"Things Fall Apart"|"Chinua Achebe"
12:00|midday|"Large crowds began to gather on the village ilo as soon as the edge had worn off the sun’s heat and it was no longer painful on the body. Most communal ceremonies took place at that time of the day, so that even when it was said that a ceremony would begin “after the midday meal” everyone understood that it would begin a long time later, when the sun’s heat had softened."|"Things Fall Apart"|"Chinua Achebe"
