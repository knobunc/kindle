"ap ~ 10:00"|"around 10"|"So many hopes are riding on the LHC because what it finds will also tell us a lot about one of the five key problems mentioned in chapter 1: how to explain the values of the free constants of the standard model. To see why, we need to understand one very striking feature of these values, which is that they are either very large or very small. One example is the wildly differing strengths of the forces. The electrical repulsion between two protons is stronger than their gravitational attraction by a huge factor, around 10. There are also huge differences in the masses of the particles. For example, the electron has /1,800 the mass of a proton. And the Higgs boson, if it exists, has a mass of at least 120 times that of the proton."|"The Trouble With Physics"|"Lee Smolin"
12:00|noon|"Another aspect of background independence is that there is no preferred time. General relativity describes the history of the world most fundamentally in terms of events and relationships between them. The principal relationships have to do with causality; one event may be in the chain of causes leading to another event. From this point of view, space is a secondary concept. The concept of space is in fact entirely dependent on the notion of time. Given a clock, we can think of all the events that are simultaneous with the clock striking noon. These make up space."|"The Trouble With Physics"|"Lee Smolin"
