Often, he would sit in front of the TV with the remote control in his hand, staring at the black screen. He could not even summon enough enthusiasm to turn on the TV. Sometimes he would eventually fall asleep at around three or four o’clock, but often he would just count the hours until dawn, which would come as a relief, because daylight brought with it activity, and he would not have to sit alone with only his thoughts for company."|"Five Star Billionaire"|"Tash Aw"

She let Phoebe in and went to sit on her bed. Phoebe thought maybe she was very tired from working very hard at her important job.

She was not the only one drawn to his blend of nonchalance and intellect, his elegant skinniness, his don’t-give-a-shit attitude summed up by the permanent dark circles under his eyes and his charmingly disheveled hair. Standing at the counter, pretending to tally up the figures on the cash machine that she never fully mastered, she would watch him slouch on the battered fake Alvar Aalto sofa, his feet stretched out on the floor, surrounded by a coterie of eager disciples, predominantly young women. He would often be content to let others do the speaking; sometimes he would even stare into space or close his eyes as if he was thinking of something else entirely, but then, in the midst of the fiercest debates, he would begin to speak, and everyone would automatically fall silent and turn to him. His one-liners were pithy and original and always provocative; often there would be a ripple of embarrassed laughter at what he said. Each night, just after nine-thirty, she would pull the shutters half shut and lock the doors before opening a bottle of cabernet sauvignon. She would settle down with C.S. and a few of his close friends—their close friends—and chat until the early hours of the morning, sometimes until they heard the call for Fajr from the nearby mosque.

There was a young man in the audience, a guy who owned an underground jazz and folk club who just happened to be passing by (he was taking his grandmother on an outing); he heard Gary’s voice and thought, There is a very moving quality to this voice, a certain sadness. So he spoke to Gary afterward and, after a few phone conversations, offered Gary a chance to perform at his club, a tiny place in Hongkou that seats only thirty people—a completely low-key, acoustic performance for an audience of students, artists, and writers.

They would be at the café that Yinghui had just opened, spread out on comfortable sofas, listening to Lou Reed or Cuban music, chatting about films and travel and love. She would be sitting with her legs on his lap, her bare feet moving in the air to the rhythm of the music as she talked; she would not even realize that her feet were moving, or that Justin was watching her, noticing how her second toe was far longer than her big toe, how she had a habit of curling her feet into tight arcs every now and then, particularly when she laughed. Now and then she would get up and make some herbal tea from plants that Justin had never heard of and didn’t think were even drinkable, like nettle, or Indian chai, which they served in the café, inspired by their journeys to the subcontinent."|"Five Star Billionaire"|"Tash Aw"

He thought of Yinghui and C.S. again, reclining on the sofa at Angie’s, facing each other with their ankles lazily interlaced as they leafed through magazines. It was Saturday night—they might be listening to the Velvet Underground at that very moment; once it got past midnight, Yinghui would get up and put on “Sunday Morning” and start to sing along. Yeah, yeah, I’m so predictable, she would say, laughing as she returned to the sofa. She knew all the words; just the previous Saturday, Justin had watched her mouthing the words to “Pale Blue Eyes,” her lips moving gently even though her eyelids were half closed with slumber. When she sang, “Sometimes I feel so happy,” she really did look completely contented. She and C.S. would never know what it was like to be in Justin’s place, here in a karaoke bar in a small town up north—and Justin was glad, because he didn’t want her to experience all that men were capable of inflicting on others in this world he inhabited."|"Five Star Billionaire"|"Tash Aw"

He has never performed to such a mature audience before—at every one of his concerts in the past, he looked out at a sea of teenage girls, unwavering in their screeching devotion to him. By contrast, everyone before him now is seated and patient. There is a low buzz of conversation and—maybe he is imagining it—a faint tremor of anticipation.

01:52|"1:52 A.M."|"And yet he did not reply to the message. He had found it on his phone upon waking one morning; it had been left at 1:52 A.M., long after he had gone to bed and turned the phone off. Her voice had been calm and matter-of-fact, without any trace of hesitation—in fact, it began so smoothly that he had the impression she had rehearsed the entire message before ringing him. She said simply that she had been involved in a large deal to purchase a landmark site that he might have heard of—a building called simply 969—and that she had taken out considerable loans secured on her existing businesses. It turned out—ha-ha—that her business partner had siphoned all the money from their business account. She’d woken up one day and he had just vanished, along with the money. Well, it was her fault; she hadn’t taken the requisite precautions. She had let her guard down, and you know what happens in Shanghai if you let your guard down. Maybe she was never destined to be a good businesswoman after all. She was sure that Justin wouldn’t recall, but years ago she and Justin had once said that business, when deconstructed, was philosophically unchallenging—remember that? What a joke. (Here, she half-laughed.) The mess she’d made of the deal had reminded her of what Justin and everyone else said many years ago, that she’d never understand business. He’d known her better than she thought; she realized that now. She’d spent days thinking about what kind of person she’d been back then and what she’d become. She wondered what Justin might make of her today—compared to before, she meant. (A noise—maybe a sniff, a runny nose? Her voice had begun to waver and soften.) Losing the money was painful, but what was worse was that she had been stupid, so stupid. (Here, a short pause, a muffled noise, as if she had cupped her hand over the phone.) Anyway, she didn’t mean to bore him with details of her misery. No, in fact she was going to go back to the drawing board, salvage what she could from her businesses and see what happened. She knew she really wasn’t that bad at business. Maybe not great, but definitely not terrible. She was going to stick it out in China and rise from the ashes—again. (Then came a pause in the message—so long that the first time Justin listened to it he wondered if she had hung up.) It would be hard, but that’s life. She’d experienced worse in the past, as he no doubt remembered. So, if he wanted to meet for a drink sometime, just to catch up on old times, he should give her a call. Or maybe (laugh) it would be better if they didn’t catch up on old times and simply chatted about the weather, restaurants, that kind of thing. All the best."|"Five Star Billionaire"|"Tash Aw"
