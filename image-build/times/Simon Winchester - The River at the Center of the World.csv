19:05|1905|"It was not until the eve of the Revolution that was to end the rule of the emperors and princes that this impasse was ended. It was 1905: the Manchus were on their last legs and knew it, and in part because of weakness, in part as a placatory gesture that might work for their survival, they gave permission to the foreigners to begin their work. A Dutchman named de Rijke, an expert on the polders back home, was the first to bring in the dredging engines. By 1910 he had completed the first channel through the Bar. When the first Chinese president, the foreign-educated Sun Yat-sen, came home to China in 1912 he entered via the Yangtze – and he sailed symbolically to Shanghai through the foreign-engineered channel. In 1937 – just in time for the Japanese war, as it happened – the entire length of the Whangpoo was finally dredged, so that ships drawing twenty-eight feet could pass all the way from the Pacific Ocean, along the estuary of the Yangtze, up into the Whangpoo and right up to the wharves on the Bund."|"The River at the Center of the World"|"Simon Winchester"
05:00|"five o'clock in the morning"|"Shanghai was, if you believed its reputation, a dreadful place. Yes, most people – or at least the foreigners, and the rich Chinese who had evolved from the class of men called compradors, the businessmen's go-betweens – enjoyed themselves, or believed they did. This was a city where one could dance all night, go riding (on especially small Mongolian ponies, which raced vigorously at the track) at dawn, work all day and begin a new round of parties that evening without ever feeling weary. ‘I used to gamble, gamble, gamble oh, till five o'clock in the morning,’ noted one Shanghailander, a middle-aged gentlewoman transplanted from the innocence of Sussex. ‘Then I would go home, have a bath, get into jodhpurs, go down to the race-course, ride my ponies…’"|"The River at the Center of the World"|"Simon Winchester"
"ap 01:00"|"one o'clock"|"But Dr Yu was courteous to a fault. He quickly arranged tea, postponed a meeting with his wife, summoned in a secretary who was on the point of leaving for his weekend, found a number of scholarly books for me, trundled a blackboard in from another room and – all this at one o'clock on a wet Saturday – proceeded to give me a brief but seminal lecture on the Role of Vinegar in Chinese Society."|"The River at the Center of the World"|"Simon Winchester"
"< 12:00"|"shortly before noon"|"General Zhu's men showed no mercy. Shell after shell tore into the ship, and within minutes the deck was an inferno, littered with dead and wounded men. The ship's power was cut, the radio was out, the sick bay suffered a direct hit, the aft gun-turret was ruined, the depth-charge store was penetrated by an armour-piercing shell and Amethyst's TNT went up in a roar. Injured men lay untended among the flames, and if not burned by the fires they were hit by splinters from new shell bursts. For more than an hour the ship shuddered and shook under the barrage: Weston gave the order to evacuate – though not totally abandon – the vessel. A steaming party was to be left on board, as were volunteers to help tend the wounded. The rest swam or took life rafts to shore – under withering hail of machine-gun fire, which killed further numbers of the terrified men. Those who made it set themselves up in the underbrush, watched and waited. The plan was to reboard the ship at nightfall, repair her, refloat her and get away. The Communists stopped shelling shortly before noon, and the river fell quiet."|"The River at the Center of the World"|"Simon Winchester"
22:00|"10 p.m."|"At 10 p.m. on the hot and moonless night of Saturday 30 July the bosun knocked out the pin on the anchor chain, the ship gunned her engines and steamed out into the night. Twenty miles downriver she was spotted, gunfire rang out, and she was hit – though not badly. Someone sent a signal to the C-in-C in Hong Kong. The admiral was hosting a dinner party, and a toast was drunk – ‘To HMS Amethyst and all who sail in her.’"|"The River at the Center of the World"|"Simon Winchester"
21:00|"9 p.m."|"We waited in the gathering gloom for our 9 p.m. boat to Jiujiang, and other points upstream. Kathleen, an American woman I knew vaguely who taught at one of the universities in Nanjing, had come to see us off. She was from Connecticut and was in love with China, didn't much want to go home. She taught English to a class of about forty students. That day they had been reading Tess of the D'Urbervilles."|"The River at the Center of the World"|"Simon Winchester"
00:00|midnight|"At the Jiujiang Hotel that night, it not only appeared impossible to get any tea: there also wasn't any food. The boat was late – because of the floods, Captain Wu kept insisting – and we finally disembarked at midnight and found a broken-down taxi. As it limped along with us to what all agreed was the best hotel, we still had high hopes for a substantial dinner. The Jiujiang was after all a spanking new hotel, tricked out impressively in chrome and polished marble. It had fake columns six feet wide, coloured fountains playing outside and in, a doorman who wore the uniform of some steamy Latin republic – a mauve shako, a long heliotrope jacket in velvet with gold epaulettes and the yellow stripes of a master sergeant – and a small battalion of scarlet-coated little girls who stood behind a reception desk so long that the girls at one end had to telephone to speak to colleagues at the other."|"The River at the Center of the World"|"Simon Winchester"
"ap ~ 01:00"|"about one o'clock"|"I made notes of this rather unexpected exchange and then climbed into the lumpy bed. No matter how grand hotel reception halls may be in China, the carpets upstairs are always stained and the beds are always lumpy. I was too tired to care: it must have been about one o'clock by the time I fell asleep."|"The River at the Center of the World"|"Simon Winchester"
"ap < 02:00"|"just before two"|"Some time later, however, I was awakened by a noise. There was someone knocking at my door, softly but insistently. I looked at my watch: it was just before two. Well accustomed to the sensual thrills in Eastern hotels that begin with a soft tap from outside, I tiptoed over to the door and with an expectant flourish threw it open."|"The River at the Center of the World"|"Simon Winchester"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"On my table were a bowl of wheat noodles, a plate of stir-fried beef and garlic, a small orange, a much ablated bar of gritty Chinese chocolate and a tall bottle of the local beer with its label glued upside-down. There was also, in deference to the plea I thought had gone unheard (and also, I liked to think, in deference to where we were), a pale little bamboo box with a line of four characters that I recognized in an instant: Yun Wu Lu Cha – Lushan Misty Clouds Green Tea. The city's most famous product of old, the seven-times-processed tea, once reserved as a gift for emperors, and still to be found here, even at two in the morning."|"The River at the Center of the World"|"Simon Winchester"
15:00|"three in the afternoon"|"And so it was with a sense of mounting excitement that I eventually tracked down the gate to the Lushan Tea Research Institute. It had taken us two hours of patient searching along the butterfly-filled lanes of the hilltop – past caves and waterfalls and beside cliffs that loomed high over the whorls of the distant Yangtze – before I found what I wanted. It was three in the afternoon, pleasantly warm, the air filled with scents of late spring – an appropriate time I thought to see the Lushan Institute, the cosmic centre of whatever was left of the world of Chinese tea."|"The River at the Center of the World"|"Simon Winchester"
12:00|"High Noon"|"Within this ugly little building with its three entrance arches, which looked like the kind of cinema-turned-bingo-hall that is found in blighted industrial suburbs in the English Midlands, China's oldest and most powerful men met, fell out and argued and fought, and performed acts, signed papers and changed policies that affected – and usually for the worse – the lives of tens of millions of Chinese people. The most notable decisions were those taken in early July 1959, during what has been called High Noon at Lushan. Nearly all of the pictures that were on display for the benefit of the tourists – most of whom were brought here in buses by their work units: there were groups of several hundred from a steel factory in Wuhan on this day – were taken during that unseemly week of brawling. It was a week when the rulers of China took decisions that can rightly be said to have provided, for millions, hell's foundations."|"The River at the Center of the World"|"Simon Winchester"
"ap 01:00"|one|"The Manchu government had been clever and cynical when it had signed the Convention of Chefoo in 1876. Its mandarins had seemed to be in a generous mood. They had appeared to give in to the foreigners' demand that they be allowed to appoint trade representatives in Chongqing, in the heart of the grain-rich, mineral-rich, coal-rich Red Basin. But closer scrutiny showed that their official stipulation was subtly phrased: trade could get fully under way only when steam navigation was in full swing. Since the Court believed this to be impossible, and since the mandarinate had put forward all kinds of objections,* it turned out that they had managed to offer the foreigners an apparent concession – and yet withhold it at one and the same time. It was a classic piece of Chinese trickery, whereby the Orientals seemed to outfox the barbarians, and not for the last time either."|"The River at the Center of the World"|"Simon Winchester"
12:00|midday|"The first few miles of the River of Golden Sand looked manageable, though it was rarely more than a hundred feet across, and the banks were steep and all the rapids merged into one, so the whole river frothed and boiled as it sped by. From time to time we stopped, nosing in to the black mud on the bank and here allowing a woman passenger to jump off, there letting a couple clamber on with their goats or their bindles, or with small children strapped to the mother's back. Soon, though, the muddy banks became tiny rocky coves, and then there were no stopping places at all and the cliffs began to close in beside us and, more ominously, ahead. The mountains reared ten and twelve thousand feet into the sky, according to my American charts, and their peaks were sharp, and glinted wetly in the midday sun."|"The River at the Center of the World"|"Simon Winchester"
01:00|"one in the morning"|"It was in Leibo, the seat of a semi-autonomous Yi county, that matters began becoming a little strange. Lily and I had managed to get rooms in a small inn, and after noodles at a restaurant run by a memorably handsome Yi woman, we retired to our respective beds, exhausted. At one in the morning there was a thunderous hammering on our doors, and a squad of Chinese goons demanded that we present ourselves for questioning before the local office of the Public Security Bureau."|"The River at the Center of the World"|"Simon Winchester"
21:00|"9 p.m."|"The circumstances were simple enough. Earlier in the day I had discovered that there was a young Scotswoman living on the campus of a small college in the Xichang suburbs; she wasn't in when I called, but I arranged to stop by on my way to the railway station. Lily and I were due to catch a 9 p.m. express to a Yangtze-side steel town called Panzhihua; I supposed that if we left the hotel at eight we could pass by the college, I could deliver my message and the miniature of Johnnie Walker I had as a gift, and then drive on to catch the train. We duly left the hotel in a taxi, and I sat back to enjoy the drive."|"The River at the Center of the World"|"Simon Winchester"
"ap 05:00"|"five o'clock"|"Wu had two cars – a sporty-looking Toyota LandCruiser and a ratty-looking red Beijing Jeep, which showed that the spoils of the insurance business were every bit as handsome as in America or Europe. To our slight chagrin he elected to take the Jeep, and at five o'clock one sunny summer morning we set off westward, away from the blighted industrial landscape of Panzhihua. The last we saw of the steel city – a town that had been deliberately created by Mao's planners, and to which, during the fifties and sixties, the Great Helmsman had exhorted workers to move – was a long line of steam trains dumping torrents of molten slag down a slope that led directly into the Yangtze. It seemed a suitable memorial to the insanity of the Great Leap Forward – the making of a cliff of iron, the creation of industrial pollution on a titanic scale and with a callous disregard for the greatest of China's waterways. Wang Hui, Li Bai, Da Fu and Meng Jiao and all those other painters and poets who once loved the river – thou shouldst most decidedly not be living at this hour!"|"The River at the Center of the World"|"Simon Winchester"
"ap 01:00"|one|"This, according to Wong's claim – which was backed up by an official Chinese report in 1986 – was almost certainly the true, technical source of the Yangtze. It was nearly a full mile lower than the Tuotuo's source in the glacial lake, but it was one and a half river miles further away from the sea, and it provided much more water. It lies at 32° 7' North, 94°6' East, is at a height of 18,750 feet above sea level, and is 3965 miles from the ocean."|"The River at the Center of the World"|"Simon Winchester"
14:00|"two in the afternoon"|"The roads were narrow and dangerous and clung to the side of huge black cliffs. Long diversions – one of them at least a hundred miles long – kept us away from the more serious landslips. One road across a high pass was only open westbound – the direction we needed – before two in the afternoon, and we arrived to find barrier poles up and police telling us to try the following day or take another long detour, which we did."|"The River at the Center of the World"|"Simon Winchester"
