06:30|"six-thirty in the morning"|"In the fall of 1957, after nine years of classes in the Coalwood School, I went across the mountains to Big Creek, the district high school, for the tenth through the twelfth grade. Except for having to get up to catch the school bus at six-thirty in the morning, I liked high school right off. There were kids there from all the little towns in the district, and I started making lots of new friends, although my core group remained my buddies from Coalwood: Roy Lee, Sherman, and O’Dell."|"Rocket Boys"|"Homer Hickam"
"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"It was past midnight when Dad returned. I had just dozed off after a round of thinking about all that Mom had said. I heard him creep up the stairs and then I started thinking all over again. I carefully lifted Daisy Mae, my little calico cat, out of the crook of my arm and placed her at the foot of the bed and got up and opened my window. The tipple loomed before me like a giant black spider. According to Mom, Dad thought all I was good for was working there as a clerk. A gasp of steam erupted from an air vent beside the tipple, and I followed the cloud skyward, watched the water droplets disperse. A big golden moon hovered overhead, and the vapor formed a misty circle around it. Sparkling stars flowed down the narrow river of sky the mountains allowed. I looked at the tiny pricks of light so far away. I didn’t know one star from the other, didn’t know much of anything about the reality of space. I knew less than nothing about rockets too. I suddenly felt as stupid as Dad apparently thought I was. Mom had said for me to build a rocket, show him what I could do. I had already been thinking about learning enough to go to work for Wernher von Braun. Her Elsie Hickam Scholarship, if approved by Dad, would fit right in with that."|"Rocket Boys"|"Homer Hickam"
"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"After an evident moment of confusion, Dad replied, “Thank you for your vote of confidence, Reverend Lavender.” Then the black phone rang, ever the convenient way to end discussion in our house. Dad yelled at whoever was on the other end and then headed out the door, throwing on his coat and hat as he went. I had no doubt he was grateful for the interruption. He didn’t come home until past midnight. Sometimes when he did that, I wondered if he wasn’t just sitting around his office, checking his watch, until Mom went to bed."|"Rocket Boys"|"Homer Hickam"
"~ 23:00"|"Around 11:00 P.M."|"ON JANUARY 31, 1958, the Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA), led by Dr. von Braun, was ready to launch the Explorer-1 satellite aboard a Jupiter-C rocket. It was to be a night launch, so I stayed up to watch television, hoping for good news. Around 11:00 P.M., a bulletin interrupted the Tonight Show with an announcement that the launch had been a success. Film of the launch was promised momentarily. I started a vigil, lying on the rug in front of the television set, staring at the set, which displayed nothing but a sign stating STAND BY. Mom, Dad, and Jim had long since gone to bed. Daisy Mae joined me on the rug, curling up behind me in the bend of my knees. The bitter cold outside had also chased our old tom Lucifer in, and he was curled up in Dad’s easy chair. It was good to have them as company. I reached back and patted Daisy Mae’s head. “Good old girl,” I told her. “Good old cat.” She rewarded me with a purr and a lick on my hand."|"Rocket Boys"|"Homer Hickam"
"~ 00:00"|"Around midnight"|"Around midnight (it was a Friday and not a school night), I was surprised by a knock on the front door, and in came Roy Lee, Sherman, and O’Dell to join me. They bedded down on the couch and the floor. We talked some, mostly about girls, but then O’Dell and Sherman kind of drifted off. I’d been meaning to ask Roy Lee about the spot on Dad’s lung, so I took the opportunity. He tucked himself in the corner of the couch and gave me a worried look. “I’ll ask Billy,” he said. Billy was his brother."|"Rocket Boys"|"Homer Hickam"
"ap ~ 06:10"|"About ten after six"|"Jake rolled over and sat up and then wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. He pushed the newspaper away and went for the jar, then threw it aside when he saw it was empty. “Dammitto-Christhell.” He blinked at me and ran a hand through his sandy hair. “What time is it?”
“About ten after six, sir.”
“A.M. or P.M.?”"|"Rocket Boys"|"Homer Hickam"

"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"Long past midnight, Jake kept showing Sherman and me different planets and stars, until finally he sat down and leaned up against a brick chimney and went to sleep. While Sherman kept looking through the telescope, I wandered to the edge of the roof and looked out over my little town. The church, bathed in starlight, glowed against the black silhouette of the mountain behind it, and on the hill above the post office I could make out the spires of Mr. Van Dyke’s mansion. The trees rustled in the cooling air coming off the mountains, and in the distance I could hear the hoot of a lone owl and by the creek that ran alongside the machine shops the rhythmic eepingof frogs. I went back to the telescope and tried to use it to look at Coalwood, but discovered I couldn’t focus it close enough. I thought how ironic it was that Jake’s telescope could see stars a million light-years away, but not the town it was in. Maybe I was that way myself. I had a clear vision of my future in space, but the life I led in Coalwood sometimes seemed to blur."|"Rocket Boys"|"Homer Hickam"
"< 00:00"|"near midnight"|"O’Dell and Roy Lee arrived at the mule barn on a Friday, near midnight. The next morning, while I was watching cartoons on television, the home phone rang. It was Tag Farmer, the town constable. “I think you better hightail it on down to Mr. Van Dyke’s office, Sonny,” he said. “You got problems.”"|"Rocket Boys"|"Homer Hickam"
"~ 00:00"|"Around midnight"|"Roy Lee sat silently, glaring at O’Dell while the boy whispered furiously in my ear about what had happened. Around midnight they had arrived at the mule barn, finding a rusty padlock on the back door, knocked loose with a whack from a hammer out of Roy Lee’s car. They pushed ahead cautiously, O’Dell holding the flashlight and flashing it around the empty stalls. He said it smelled like the air was a hundred years old in there. Then the rotten old floor collapsed, and the boys plummeted into the basement. Bats chattered and spun around the rafters, sailing through a cracked window into the cold night outside, and then it was quiet again. Trapped, they spent the night in old mule dung until Tag found them."|"Rocket Boys"|"Homer Hickam"
02:00|"two o’clock in the morning"|"The way she looked at me so pitifully, I couldn’t help but feel sorry for her. The night of the big dance, I suffered at home, barely paying attention to the book—Steinbeck’s Sweet Thursday—I had borrowed from Dad’s bookcase in the upstairs hall. I stayed awake until two o’clock in the morning, relaxing only when I was certain Dorothy must be home and safe. I saw Roy Lee the next day. He’d been to the formal, and I couldn’t resist asking him if he’d seen Dorothy. “I saw her,” he said noncommittally."|"Rocket Boys"|"Homer Hickam"
"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"AT the Dugout, Ed had already played “Goodnight, My Love,” and the place was empty. Sherman was gone, most likely catching a ride to English to the drive-in before hitching the rest of the way home. I looked at the clock inside the Owl’s Nest and was surprised to see that it was well past midnight. There was a storm in the air, and as I hurried down the sidewalk, the first patter of rain came, and in the distance, I saw lightning. A car eased up the road and I stuck my thumb out and it stopped. It was 2:00 A.M. before another ride got me all the way to Coalwood. The rain was lashing the valley, and thunder and lighting crashed across the mountains."|"Rocket Boys"|"Homer Hickam"

"< 00:00"|"near midnight"|"Mom roasted a turkey for the holiday, but Dad ate little of it, still obviously upset from having to cut off his men. It was just the three of us around the kitchen table. Jim was home from college, but he had a new girlfriend over in Berwind and had taken the Buick and sped off almost as soon as he deposited his laundry in the basement. He had made first-string on the freshman team, but even that didn’t seem to cheer Dad up much. He pretended to watch football on television for a little while after dinner and then put on his coat and walked up to the mine. Mom went out on the porch, staying there sewing and reading magazines with Daisy Mae on her lap, Dandy at her feet, and Chipper on her shoulder until Dad returned, near midnight. I was in my room, designing more nozzles, when I heard her hurry off to bed. I think she didn’t want him to know she had waited up for him."|"Rocket Boys"|"Homer Hickam"
"~ 03:00"|"about three in the morning"|"On the night before I was to leave for Indianapolis, Quentin spent the night at my house, not letting me sleep, drilling me incessantly on the details of the trigonometry, calculus, physics, chemistry, and differential equations we used for our rocket designs. Finally, at about three in the morning, I collapsed on my bed and pulled the pillow over my ears. “No more, Q,” I begged. “For the love of God, no more.”"|"Rocket Boys"|"Homer Hickam"
"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"I sank back into my seat and the bus rolled through the night. I slept through most of it and awoke at first light and was startled when I couldn’t see any mountains, just a flat plain as far as I could see. I almost felt naked. We arrived in the city around noon, and I unloaded my displays at the cavernous Indiana Exposition Hall. I was directed to an area on the outer edge of the displays with other exhibitors of propulsion projects. I made a quick inspection of their displays and was relieved to find that none of them approached the sophistication of the BCMA’s designs. A lantern-jawed boy from Lubbock, Texas, set up beside me. He was wearing a cowboy hat. He had two designs, one of them using plumbing hardware for rocket nozzles, the other a demonstration of an electromagnetic launcher, with little colored lights that ran the length of a track, that sent a little ball bearing flying off at a pretty good clip. We became instant friends. His name was Orville, but he asked me to call him “Tex.”"|"Rocket Boys"|"Homer Hickam"
08:00|"eight o’clock in the morning"|"That night, Tex answered the hotel phone and called me. It was Mom. “Can you get to the Trailways bus station in Indianapolis by eight o’clock in the morning?”"|"Rocket Boys"|"Homer Hickam"
12:00|noon|"It was noon by the time we were ready to get our first rocket off. We ran up our flag. It was the same one O’Dell’s mom had made for us nearly three years before, a little tattered but still serviceable. Wind was negligible. Quentin disappeared downrange trailing telephone wires and carrying his theodolite. We signaled Tag when we were ready, and a hush fell over Cape Coalwood. I looked through the blockhouse portal before beginning the first countdown and saw Miss Riley sitting at the Women’s Club table. Two of the Great Six teachers were fanning her. Jake stood nearby, with Mr. Turner."|"Rocket Boys"|"Homer Hickam"
