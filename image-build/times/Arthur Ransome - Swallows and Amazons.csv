"~ 11:00"|"about eleven o’clock in the morning"|"IT MUST HAVE been about eleven o’clock in the morning of that third day when all four of the ship’s company were at the look-out place at the northern end of the island. The mate was sewing a button on the boy’s shirt, and as the boy was inside it, she was finding it difficult. The captain was busy with some string, trying some of the knots in The Seaman’s Handybook. Able-seaman Titty was lying on her stomach in the heather, now and then looking through the telescope at the woody point that hid Houseboat Bay and the houseboat of the retired pirate."|"Swallows and Amazons"|"Arthur Ransome"

“Peggy said they had supper at half-past seven,” said Susan.
“Well it’s ages after that now,” said John. “I should think we are all right.”"|"Swallows and Amazons"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"THAT DAY IT was one o’clock before John and Roger rowed across and went up to Dixon’s Farm for the milk and a new supply of eggs and butter. It had been nearly seven in the morning before Susan had hurried them to bed in broad daylight. No alarm clock could have stirred them, and they had no alarm clock on Wild Cat Island. The camp was roused at last by Roger, who was waked, some time after noon, by a strong desire for breakfast."|"Swallows and Amazons"|"Arthur Ransome"

There’s no time to lose.” Really, in spite of bathing and fetching the milk and having breakfast and dinner, it seemed a very long time before the small hand of the chronometer crawled round past the II, and nearly as far as the III, on the chronometer face. A watched pot never boils, and a watched watch seems to lag on purpose. But at last Captain John looked at it for the last time, and gave the order. The Grand Fleet set sail."|"Swallows and Amazons"|"Arthur Ransome"
