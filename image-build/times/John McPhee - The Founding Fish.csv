As noted in Chapter 12, if shad fillets are put in a broiler very soon after swimming, they will rise like bread as they brown. As shad muscle broils, it will soften before it sets. After eleven or twelve minutes, it will almost be soup. At fifteen and a half minutes, it is firm and just done. Past sixteen, it is overdone. The window is that narrow. Moreover, the window moves around from stove to stove, because stoves are idiosyncratic. So if fifteen and a half minutes is not your windowsill, better luck next time.

"ap 07:30"|seven-thirty|"Three of us were in the boat, close and tandem. I was in the middle, fishing over the shoulder of the skipper, Ed Cervone. Fishing over my shoulder was Ed’s son, Edmund Cervone. Each of them had caught several shad, varying in sex, notable in size. I had caught two roe shad. The sun was setting. It was seven-thirty. Quitting time was upon us, but the rod in my hand was suddenly pulled by a great deal more than the current. The Cervones reeled in their darts and stowed their rods. They would wait and watch, as people do when someone else in a boat has a fish on the line."|"The Founding Fish"|"John McPhee"

something about their wives. There were people on the bridge who had been watching earlier, and had gone off to dinner, and now had come back from dinner and were watching again. One of them shouted, “Are you still catching that same fish?” I nodded without looking up. In the darkness, I was staring instead at the black vertical rod against the disco lights of Club Zadar, which had grown ever brighter with the fall of night and were flashing colors on the river. While the fish moved and sounded, and came up a little, and then sounded again, it almost hypnotized me as I concentrated on the swaying rod against the whirling colors. Gingerly, I worked it to the left and the right, trying to move its head to one side and then to the other side, to confuse it, and try to get in charge of it psychologically. But I’ll tell you, I never got in charge of that fish psychologically.

It was not true that Marian Cervone was concerned about her husband. By her own account, the man is too unpredictable to worry about. She wasn’t worried about Edmund, either. It was my wife, Yolanda Whitman, whose mind had been crossed by the ultimate possibility. This was a few years before the sudden bloom of cellular phones.

We heard them go “Ooh!” We heard them shout, “Wow, what a huge fish!” When we, in the boat, finally got a glimpse of it, we thought it enormous, too. Toward the end, I kept pressing it, tightened the drag even more, a risky, foolish thing to do. I just hoped it would not make a sudden run. If it did so, at least I had turned off the anti-reverse button, and the reel could spin free. Buddy Grucela, page 22."|"The Founding Fish"|"John McPhee"

On a bookshelf, I propped it up beside a dart of the same weight and colors, with which, on an upriver day the spring before, I had caught seventeen shad without changing or losing the lure. The chemically sharpened hook was a novelty I had succumbed to in a catalogue. That shipment of hooks was uneven, to say the least. Some of them were so weak they were bent out straight by the force of tugging shad. But not this one. Despite two hours and thirty-five minutes in the shad’s mouth, the curve of the black steel looked as it had when I made the dart and festooned it with bucktail in a vise. At home, I studied the fish with a magnifying glass. It had not been hooked on the top of the head or in any other place on the outside. It was not foul-hooked. It was hooked in the roof of the mouth, very near the front, slightly off the midline, to the right. I saw a narrow hole there, and I put a toothpick in it, which did not come through to the outside. The connection of hook and shad had been something like a trailer hitch."|"The Founding Fish"|"John McPhee"

They’re not feeding, so they have an unrenewable energy reserve that will take them only so far up the river, depending also on delays, water velocity (how hard they have to swim to get there), and water temperature. It is fairly well established that
when water temperature gets to twenty-one they slow down, and by twenty-two they stop. They look for a suitable place to spawn. It’s a race against time. If you’re a shad, you take every opportunity to get as far upstream as you can, past every obstacle, before the water temperature reaches twenty-one degrees. The joker is that you never know what the environment is going to throw at you. You can have the fifty-year flood. You can have low water. Through it all, you have to keep going, and go as fast and as far upstream as you can, because that’s the only way your offspring have any chance to have an advantage.”"|"The Founding Fish"|"John McPhee"

When he works in other rivers, he takes his six-pound test and ultra-light. Below Troy and Albany, the mile-wide Hudson can look hopeless for fishing from the bank, but it failed to intimidate St. Pierre. “They don’t know what they’ve got,” he said. Across the river from Catskill, he fished one evening from a ferry dock, where, despite the great breadth of water, sufficient current ran close to the eastern shore. Using a big dart for a long cast, he caught a nine-pound, nineounce roe shad. It was twenty-eight inches long and twenty-eight inches in maximum circumference. It was somewhat heavier than

The view was immediate, across three hundred yards of barrage—called Edwards Dam since the eighteen-eighties, when the Edwards Manufacturing Company bought it and was soon operating a hundred thousand spindles and employing a thousand people in one of the largest cotton mills in the world. The dam was veiled now in falling water, an exception being a gap at the west end, where sixty feet had been dismantled and removed.

16:00|"four in the afternoon"|"There were three ponds—in effect, some of the shipping docks of the business. Beside the ponds were two metal buildings, like the hangar and machine shop of a very small airport. The larger building was three stories tall and cavernous inside—a single space, with a stairway in one corner that led to a high platform where observers could lean on a railing and look down from close proximity into an uncovered tank fifteen feet in diameter. Large dark shapes flashing silver were swimming there, schooled up and steady in concentric skeins, when Chapman took me to the platform at four in the afternoon. They were swimming against the current, clockwise—swimming high to low in the water column, randomly changing depths. Now and again, the high ones broke the surface slightly with their dorsals or tails. Rarely, they snapped at bubbles, as if the bubbles were shad darts. The scene was calm, cool, and migrational—expert swimmers moving into current, instinctively moving upstream, not evidently rattled by Chapman’s closed circuit. Every so often, as the afternoon lengthened, a single shad would break the spell, looping around to swim against the crowd. Chapman said, “Normally, during the daylight hours, the fish are going to be swimming around the tank pretty well in a parallel fashion. They’re all uniformly swimming, and there’s not much deviation from the given path. It’s like running track. Later, you see individuals break out of that pattern, break the line, and go from one track to the other.”"|"The Founding Fish"|"John McPhee"

In the Northeast, I’ve never seen anybody trolling for shad with any kind of rig behind a moving boat, let alone a fly line. In Floridian shad fishing, trolling evidently is what the majority do. In January, I went to Coweta County, Georgia, to help Sam Candler lift his canoe to the top of his car. It was
already there. In his mind, he was halfway to the St. Johns. I had been in that canoe with him on other rivers. On the Cemocheckobee, he teased a cottonmouth up onto the blade of his paddle. When we went to Florida to fish for shad, we had actually known each other more than thirty years. While Jimmy Carter was Governor of Georgia, he created a Natural Areas Council to identify landscapes that ought to be protected while they were still there to protect. He appointed Sam to the council. In that era, I made an eleven-hundred-mile trip with Sam and his colleague Carol Ruckdeschel, episodically moving around Georgia from one swamp to the next, and from an isolated valley in the mountains of North Georgia to a sea of pitcher plants in the south, before going down the Cemocheckobee. On this shad trip, as it happened, we drove farther than that."|"The Founding Fish"|"John McPhee"

This time we were guiding each other—a zero-sum situation if ever there was one, since neither of us had ever been where we were going. I had with me a roll of maps in the United States Geological Survey’s 1:24,000 series—the largest scale of any standard series, one inch equals four-tenths of a mile.

The average female is two and a half to three.” The Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission has an annual meeting in Titusville in February, he told us. Always, the conferees take an afternoon off to go shad fishing. “I’ll eat a meal or two of roe a year and that’s enough for me,” he went on. “Very few of us kill fish anymore. The shad’s popularity as
catch-and-release, as a fly-rod fish particularly, has jumped tremendously. I wish y’all good luck.”"|"The Founding Fish"|"John McPhee"
09:00|"nine in the morning"|"One Memorial Day weekend at nine in the morning, I was fishing in a pool far upriver when a canoe overturned in rapids above me. A boy about seven years old, his father, two paddles, a cooler, a thermos, and other buoyant cargo spilled into the river. The boy was wearing a life jacket with a wide collar that reached above his head like a coif. He bobbed upright in the swirling currents, screaming, “Daddy! Daddy! Save me! Save me! Daddy, save me!” His father struggled to move toward him. Slowly, though, like an opening flower, the boy, the father, the paddles, the thermos, and the cooler were being spread farther apart as they were swept downstream. The father, helpless, could not swim across the current. The little boy’s jacket was doing its job, but he kept on screaming. “Daddy! Daddy! I’m going to die!” Standing about fifty
yards from him in my neoprene space suit and my cleated heavy boots, I was helpless, too, as were other wading fishermen. Walking down to the river that day, I happened to glimpse a canoe stashed behind someone’s cabin. To leave the river, climb a bluff to the cabin, locate a paddle, and return with the canoe would take so long that the effort seemed pointless, but I started wading toward the bank anyway. Then I noticed that the boy was being swept toward an anchored boat. Two shad fishermen were in it with four rods. The boy was fast approaching them, still screaming, “Daddy! I’m going to die!” They would end his panic. They would pull up their anchor and go into mid-stream to intercept him. As he went by them, they watched, and did not stir."|"The Founding Fish"|"John McPhee"
"ap > 04:00"|"A little after four"|"A late afternoon in our second year, I stood in the river until dusk while a northwest wind blew my darts off course in the air.
Others around me were catching fish, and I was not. They caught fish after fish. I did not feel so much as a bump. The embarrassment was becoming an inflammation. I was standing on an underwater boulder, but evidently not a well-chosen boulder, and also not a very large boulder. A little after four, I slipped. I slid down the rock into the river. The water was cold coming into my waders, and when I stood up the wind felt colder. After sloshing ashore, I drained the waders, turned them inside out, and hung them on a bush to dry. In my undershorts, I went back to the fishing, and went on catching nothing while surrounded by success. I did not feel a strike that day. Slowly, my two-digit I.Q. wrapped itself around a conclusion: I was in the wrong place at the right time. The ring was full of marbles but I was not close to the ring. Position is everything. I could use a canoe. A canoe would be a portable rock."|"The Founding Fish"|"John McPhee"
05:45|"5:45 A.M."|"I returned to the river soon after dawn and already three men were fishing. There was mist over the river and developing rain. What on earth did those fishermen think, at 5:45 A.M., when suddenly there slid out past them the lowfreeboard dark-brown canoe? On the opposite side of the river, I went high up the eddy, and dropped the anchor. Roe. Buck. Roe. Roe. Buck. Roe. They leaped. They ran in wide circles and would not be turned. The line passed through curtains of mist. They stayed on for ten and fifteen minutes. One rose straight up like a rocket off a pad—the tail well clear of the water, the head three feet in the air. It leaped five times. It ran into the shallows and back into the channel. It swung the rod through ninety degrees. When it came into the net, the dart fell from its outer lip. My hands were cold and I warmed them in the river. Last night and this morning, I had thirteen shad on the line. Soaked in steady rain, I carried the canoe back to the car."|"The Founding Fish"|"John McPhee"

I haven’t run into him in several years and have wondered what happened to him. The answer is “Nothing,” as the shad could tell you. Erwin invites me to join him on his rock. I hesitate and move toward other water. Erwin insists, says he often fishes with his son, side by side on a rock. We cast, Erwin hooks into a shad. I watch him bring it in. We soon cast again. Erwin hooks into a shad. He says he can feel them bump the dart in the center of the current, bump it again, and then go for it. With a third fish on his line, Erwin tells me to move around behind him and keep casting, in case there’s another where his was. I fire my dart. Shad! “Doubleheader,” says Erwin. Fish netted, we are soon casting again. Another doubleheader. I am so high on adrenaline and vertically high on the rock that when the shad comes in and I scoop low with the net I poke it in the head and free the dart. “Quick release,” Erwin says. For thirty minutes beside Erwin, I am matching him one for one, for two, for three, four shad. Five for five shad.

12:00|noon|"Thoreau was a sometime fisherman. He “caught white chivin of great size in the Aboljacknagasic, where it empties into the Penobscot, at the base of Mount Ktaadn.” But his hands-on relationships with fish went far beyond the imagination of an ordinary angler. He actually said, “I have not yet met with the philosopher who could in a quite conclusive undoubtful way show me the … difference, between man and a fish.” He could all but converse with river partridge, more commonly known as perch. In the evening at pond’s edge, he would ripple the water with his fingers, and perch would come to his side. He understood the chain pickerel—“the swiftest, wariest, and most ravenous of fishes … stately, ruminant … lurking under the shadow of a pad at noon … still, circumspect … motionless as a jewel set in water,” and then exploding forward like a barracuda to eat whatever might swim into range. Thoreau continues: “I have caught one which had swallowed a brother pickerel half as large as itself, with the tail still visible in its mouth. Sometimes a striped snake, bound to greener
meadows across the stream, ends its undulatory progress in the same receptacle.”"|"The Founding Fish"|"John McPhee"
12:00|midday|"George Edward Pickett, who was a cadet at the United States Military Academy when Thoreau was writing “A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers,” may never have read or heard of the Concord militia unit known as The Shad but he would live to cause an army to deserve the name. This was, of course, the Pickett of the charge—the Confederate general, fifty-ninth in his West Point
class of fifty-nine, who helped end the Confederate invasion of Pennsylvania when he ordered his troops to scramble up Cemetery Ridge under heavy Union fire on July 3, 1863, at Gettysburg. Pickett followed the charge, while two thousand seven hundred of his soldiers fell. That was not, however, the scene reminiscent of the Concord militia. On April 1, 1865, in Virginia, Pickett was defending an intersection known as Five Forks, six miles south of the Appomattox River and a good bit closer to the Southside Railroad, the last remaining supply line to Richmond. While thirty thousand Union troops led by Little Phil Sheridan approached from the southeast, Pickett’s twelve thousand, spread two miles wide behind fences and in ditches, braced to meet them. Pickett’s supreme commander, Robert E. Lee, was headquartered ten miles away, near Petersburg. Should Pickett fall to Sheridan, Lee would be forced from Petersburg, the Federals would capture Richmond, and the Confederate cause would be lost. Someone mentioned shad. The spring spawning run was in full penetration of the continent. The fish were in the rivers. Tom Rosser, another Confederate general, had caught some, and on the morning of April 1st ordered them baked for his midday dinner, near Hatcher’s Run, several miles from Five Forks. He invited Pickett and Major General Fitzhugh Lee, nephew of Robert E. Lee, to join him. Pickett readily accepted, and rode off from his battle station with Lee. The historian Shelby Foote continues the narrative (“The Civil War,” vol. 3, p. 870): “Neither told any subordinate where he was going or why, perhaps to keep from dividing the succulent fish too many ways; with the result that when the attack exploded—damped from their hearing, as it was, by a heavy stand of pines along Hatcher’s Run—no one knew where to find them. Pickett only made it back to his division after half its members had been shot or captured, a sad last act for a man who gave his name to the most famous charge in a war whose end was hastened by his threehour absence at a shad bake.”"|"The Founding Fish"|"John McPhee"

00:00|midnight|"Annually in the eighteen-nineties, commercial fishermen took four million shad from the Delaware River. A “forty-cent shad” was the fattest and finest. In the Hudson River, shad were taken commercially from Troy to the sea—with drift nets down to Catskill, anchored nets to the Tappan Zee, and, on the New Jersey side opposite 125th Street, nets fastened to poles set in the bottom of the river. A similar sequence filled the Connecticut to Saybrook, where nets were fastened to poles set in the bottom of the river. A hundred years later, as the twentieth century ended, most shad marketed in the Northeast were being shipped from Georgia and the Carolinas. The number of commercial shad fishermen on the
Hudson and the Connecticut was down to a remnant few. On the Delaware, of the tens of dozens of commercial fisheries in the hundred and twenty miles between tidewater and Port Jervis, only the one in Lambertville survived. Richard Holcombe began it in 1771, on the small New Jersey island just north of the New Hope bridge. William Lewis took it over in 1888, and was on the island more than seventy years. His son, Fred Lewis, long in years, runs the fishery now. He remembers fishing fifty-two hours nonstop in one of the fishery’s banner years. He calls it “the longest day I ever put in.” The day started at midnight Sunday and finished on Wednesday at four A.M. When his crew today starts a typical haul, they walk up the riverbank some two thousand feet, lining a U.S. Army assault boat of the type that crossed the Rhine. They carry the net. A crewman stays ashore, holding one end, while the others row much of the way to Pennsylvania, and then drift downstream before rowing back to New Jersey, making inches per sweep. Two are at oars, a third is poling. They wear hip boots, sweatshirts, watch caps. Only the assault boat would look different to Thomas Eakins. And maybe Sue Meserve, pulling in the haul. She is Lewis’s granddaughter-in-law. His grandson Steve Meserve is in the boat, too. Others in the crew are John Baker, who is Lewis’s grandson-in-law; Anna May Windle, Lewis’s niece, and John Isler, who is related to Lewis only in the sense that he has worked for him about forty years. Lewis lives where his father did—on the island, in a frame house whose relationship with the river is a good deal more intimate than it would be even on a floodplain. The front porch is eight feet above the water. The parlor windows are eight feet higher than the porch.

04:00|"four A.M."|"And now a man in sandals with sharks on his shirt appears before McConnell mentioning marine science, mentioning the possibility that McConnell’s great fish could find a home in Massachusetts. So far, McConnell’s day has included getting out of bed at four A.M. and fighting a shark for two hours. He was thirty miles off Dauphin Island, using fifty-pound-test line, a fifteen-hundred-pound-test leader, and two hooks baited with a ten-pound bonita. The hammerhead hammered it. And when all was over, and the fish, exhausted, neared the boat, McConnell saw that a ling, or cobia, about twenty-five pounds, had come up with it, and a second shark was chasing the ling. McConnell’s wife and two friends were with him. They went to the rail to see the second
shark. Immediately, they all stepped back and clustered in the middle of the boat. The second hammer, as McConnell would describe it, was the largest shark he had seen in fifteen years of shark fishing—“a monster.” Now, contemplatively, McConnell looks at Willy Bemis. “Massachusetts?” he says, and donates his fish. An Ohioan who was trained at Cornell, Michigan, Berkeley, and Chicago, Willy is a world-class ichthyologist—co-author, with Lance Grande, of a six-hundred-and-ninety-page book called “A Comprehensive Phylogenetic Study of Amiid Fishes (Amiidae) Based on Comparative Skeletal Anatomy”—but he is only in his second year at Dauphin Island, and this is his first hammer ever. The crane lowers the fish into Willy’s pickup. The nose is near the cab and the tail is out the back. Willy says, “If I live to be a hundred, there’s nothing like the first hammerhead you have as a specimen.”"|"The Founding Fish"|"John McPhee"

Due south of Biloxi Bay, the Chandeleurs are seventy-five miles east of New Orleans. The skipper on this run was John Colle (kolly), and the fisherwoman Natalie Colle. With two drift lines and a third line on a downrigger, she was fishing for king mackerel. On each line she used a single hook and a treble hook and a hundred-pound-test metal leader. (“Mackerel have such sharp teeth.”) The bait on each line was a ribbonfish, “which we call a silver eel, a skinny eel—the single hook goes through its mouth and nose and the treble hook goes on its back to make it seem to be swimming right, even though it’s dead.” The line itself was thirty-pound-test, appropriate for a king. Each rod was seven feet long—“a king/ling rod, a standard king-mackerel rod.” The rods were held vertically in hardware rod holders."|"The Founding Fish"|"John McPhee"

In Cabela’s catalogue I found a wire basket that hangs in the water like a birdcage, and I called 1-800. I also called the shad biologist Richard St. Pierre, of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
who told me that I was reporting something he had neither seen nor heard of. A few years later, when I asked Boyd Kynard about shads’ interactions with other species in the rivers, he said, “The only relationship I’ve seen is when shad die eels are right in the body cavity. They feed on the carcasses a lot. We pull up gill nets and a dead shad is there, and—it’s awesome—an eel is in the shad and comes crawling out.”"|"The Founding Fish"|"John McPhee"
