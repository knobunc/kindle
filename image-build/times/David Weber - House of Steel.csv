"ap 05:38"|"Five hours and thirty-eight minutes"|"Citizen Admiral Dimitri accepted another cup of coffee from a signals yeoman. It was good coffee, brewed just the way he liked it, and it tasted like corrosion-strength industrial cleaner. Not surprisingly, he supposed. Five hours and thirty-eight minutes had passed since the Manties’ translation, and the bastards had come the next best thing to four hundred and sixty million kilometers in that time. They were down to just a hair over fifteen million klicks from Enki, decelerating now, and their velocity was back down to a little over ninety-three hundred KPS."|"House of Steel"|"David Weber"
"ap 01:12"|1.12|"The Manticore System consists of a G0 star of 1.12 solar masses with a G2 binary companion of 0.92 solar masses. Both stars orbit a common center of gravity 333 light-minutes from the A component and 406 light-minutes from the B component. The apparent eccentricity of the pair approaches twelve percent, and results in distances between the stars that range from 650 light-minutes at periastron to 827 light-minutes at apastron."|"House of Steel"|"David Weber"

"ap ~ 04:00"|"about four"|"Treecats have definite muzzles, cat-like ears, and round heads that appear somewhat too large for their bodies in comparison to terrestrial cats. Their heads resemble that of a terrestrial bobcat or wildcat but with sharper muzzles, higher foreheads, and no tufts to the ears. 

Male treecats are universally gray in color, although there are gradations from ’cat to ’cat within that color range. This coloring allows them to blend well with the various colors of picketwood bark. Males also tend to be about fifteen to twenty percent larger than females and, unlike females, grow darker bands around their tails as they age. These “tail rings” make it possible to estimate a male’s age with a fair degree of accuracy. The first ring appears at about four Sphinxian years of age and a new band appears every Sphinxian year thereafter."|"House of Steel"|"David Weber"
