And then she tells again the old family tale of lactose-free milk reconnoitered on midnight runs and how I nearly “starved to death” and how she loved me despite the ugly crimson angioma—which miraculously shrank to nothing in the first two months, leaving a pink, towheaded baby girl."|"Fear of Fifty"|"Erica Jong"
00:00|midnight|"I always used to scoff at that story when I was younger, but now I believe it. The rage to keep a child alive is seismic. It overwhelms all other considerations. My mother’s passion and my father’s midnight milk runs kept me breathing. That—and the luck of my parents having found an iconoclastic pediatrician."|"Fear of Fifty"|"Erica Jong"
19:59|1959|"By the time I was two, we lived in the apartment I re-create in all my dreams—a rambling neo-Gothic affair occupying the top three floors of a building at 44 West Seventy-seventh Street, opposite the Museum of Natural History. We moved there from Castle Village in Washington Heights in 1944, and stayed until 1959, when we moved to another prewar palazzo, the Beresford, on the north side of the museum."|"Fear of Fifty"|"Erica Jong"
00:00|midnight|"The apartment I remember is probably not the apartment that exists today—now far more elegant than in my forties childhood. Lions’ heads framed the living room fireplace; the dining room had dark wood paneling and Gothic moldings and faced a court; the kitchen had an ancient hooded gas stove and a zinc sink; the bedrooms were spaced along down a crooked hall; and a stony foyer, with Gothic wood trim, opened out into a stony hall where you summoned a mirrored, paneled elevator whose whorled wood looked like midnight owls half-hidden in midnight trees."|"Fear of Fifty"|"Erica Jong"

"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"“What’s a beautiful girl like you doing in a dump like this?” I asked, using the corniest line I knew. It worked. I thought she was easy because she was sleeping in the same room as the owner of the place. But it turned out later, he never laid a finger on her—couldn‘t, in fact. She was his beard. Anyway, she was painting murals, so I got her to paint my drum. We fell madly in love. After the summer, I visited her once a week, taking the subway from Brooklyn to Upper Riverside Drive. Papa and Mama always left us alone. We took chances that were unbelievable. I think I first said I loved her on the top of an open Fifth Avenue bus. Do you know that they had open Fifth Avenue buses? I was working at Paul’s Rendezvous with a five-piece band and also trying somehow to go to NYU at night. At seven dollars a point, I couldn’t afford it. (As I said, I never knew I got into City College.) Maxwell Bodenheim used to come into Paul’s Rendezvous to recite poetry in exchange for a drink: “Death comes like jewels dropped in a velvet bag ...” I seem to remember. We got married in 1933 because the Volstead Act was being repealed and we thought there’d be work in the clubs. Roosevelt was inaugurated in March. People were starving: apple sellers on the streets, Hooverville on the river. Our first apartment was on Twenty-second Street between Eighth and Ninth. It was a rooming house with the bathtub in the middle of the kitchen. We’d get  two months concession on the rent and move out when the concession was up. We lived in a lot of places that way. At one time we were at 118th and Riverside Drive—thrilled to be on the same avenue as George Gershwin. Musicians worked from eight o’clock until unconscious. Eda would meet me and we’d walk home at night up Broadway and have breakfast at Nedick’s. Romantic. She worked all day demonstrating art supplies at Bloomingdale’s. She got to take home the paints, so it seemed like a good deal. We never slept. Then, when I was twenty-four, in 1935, I got my first big break. Mickey Green the agent—don’t use his name, he’s still alive—got me an audition with Cole Porter for Jubilee—and I got the job. From then on I was working."|"Fear of Fifty"|"Erica Jong"

Every morning at eight, I had to go down into the roaring subway and travel to 135th Street and Convent Avenue. The train was mostly deserted—all the traffic went the other way. Often I would see exhibitionists in the subway—old men with open flies and exposed cocks fondling themselves and whispering to me to come, come, come. Sometimes I looked. Sometimes I was afraid to look. Sometimes I bolted down to the next car, my heart thudding in my chest."|"Fear of Fifty"|"Erica Jong"
