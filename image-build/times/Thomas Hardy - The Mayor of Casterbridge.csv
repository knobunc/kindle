00:00|midnight|"Having sufficiently rested they proceeded on their way at
evenfall. The dense trees of the avenue rendered the road dark as a
tunnel, though the open land on each side was still under a faint
daylight, in other words, they passed down a midnight between two
gloamings. The features of the town had a keen interest for
Elizabeth's mother, now that the human side came to the fore. As
soon as they had wandered about they could see that the stockade of
gnarled trees which framed in Casterbridge was itself an avenue,
standing on a low green bank or escarpment, with a ditch yet
visible without. Within the avenue and bank was a wall more or less
discontinuous, and within the wall were packed the abodes of the
burghers."|"The Mayor of Casterbridge"|"Thomas Hardy"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"They came to a grizzled church, whose massive square tower rose
unbroken into the darkening sky, the lower parts being illuminated
by the nearest lamps sufficiently to show how completely the mortar
from the joints of the stonework had been nibbled out by time and
weather, which had planted in the crevices thus made little tufts
of stone-crop and grass almost as far up as the very battlements.
From this tower the clock struck eight, and thereupon a bell began
to toll with a peremptory clang. The curfew was still rung in
Casterbridge, and it was utilized by the inhabitants as a signal
for shutting their shops. No sooner did the deep notes of the bell
throb between the house-fronts than a clatter of shutters arose
through the whole length of the High Street. In a few minutes
business at Casterbridge was ended for the day."|"The Mayor of Casterbridge"|"Thomas Hardy"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"Other clocks struck eight from time to time—one gloomily from
the gaol, another from the gable of an almshouse, with a
preparative creak of machinery, more audible than the note of the
bell; a row of tall, varnished case-clocks from the interior of a
clock-maker's shop joined in one after another just as the shutters
were enclosing them, like a row of actors delivering their final
speeches before the fall of the curtain; then chimes were heard
stammering out the Sicilian Mariners' Hymn; so that chronologists
of the advanced school were appreciably on their way to the next
hour before the whole business of the old one was satisfactorily
wound up."|"The Mayor of Casterbridge"|"Thomas Hardy"

"ap ~ 10:00"|"about ten o'clock"|"It was about ten o'clock, and market-day, when Elizabeth paced
up the High Street, in no great hurry; for to herself her position
was only that of a poor relation deputed to hunt up a rich one. The
front doors of the private houses were mostly left open at this
warm autumn time, no thought of umbrella stealers disturbing the
minds of the placid burgesses. Hence, through the long, straight,
entrance passages thus unclosed could be seen, as through tunnels,
the mossy gardens at the back, glowing with nasturtiums, fuchsias,
scarlet geraniums, ""bloody warriors,"" snapdragons, and dahlias,
this floral blaze being backed by crusted grey stone-work remaining
from a yet remoter Casterbridge than the venerable one visible in
the street. The old-fashioned fronts of these houses, which had
older than old-fashioned backs, rose sheer from the pavement, into
which the bow windows protruded like bastions, necessitating a
pleasing chassez-dechassez movement to the time-pressed pedestrian
at every few yards. He was bound also to evolve other Terpsichorean
figures in respect of door-steps, scrapers, cellar-hatches, church
buttresses, and the overhanging angles of walls which, originally
unobtrusive, had become bow-legged and knock-kneed."|"The Mayor of Casterbridge"|"Thomas Hardy"

12:00|noon-day|"The Amphitheatre was a huge circular enclosure, with a notch at
opposite extremities of its diameter north and south. From its
sloping internal form it might have been called the spittoon of the
Jotuns. It was to Casterbridge what the ruined Coliseum is to
modern Rome, and was nearly of the same magnitude. The dusk of
evening was the proper hour at which a true impression of this
suggestive place could be received. Standing in the middle of the
arena at that time there by degrees became apparent its real
vastness, which a cursory view from the summit at noon-day was apt
to obscure. Melancholy, impressive, lonely, yet accessible from
every part of the town, the historic circle was the frequent spot
for appointments of a furtive kind. Intrigues were arranged there;
tentative meetings were there experimented after divisions and
feuds. But one kind of appointment—in itself the most common of
any—seldom had place in the Amphitheatre: that of happy lovers."|"The Mayor of Casterbridge"|"Thomas Hardy"
12:00|mid-day|"Why, seeing that it was pre-eminently an airy, accessible, and
sequestered spot for interviews, the cheerfullest form of those
occurrences never took kindly to the soil of the ruin, would be a
curious inquiry. Perhaps it was because its associations had about
them something sinister. Its history proved that. Apart from the
sanguinary nature of the games originally played therein, such
incidents attached to its past as these: that for scores of years
the town-gallows had stood at one corner; that in 1705 a woman who
had murdered her husband was half-strangled and then burnt there in
the presence of ten thousand spectators. Tradition reports that at
a certain stage of the burning her heart burst and leapt out of her
body, to the terror of them all, and that not one of those ten
thousand people ever cared particularly for hot roast after that.
In addition to these old tragedies, pugilistic encounters almost to
the death had come off down to recent dates in that secluded arena,
entirely invisible to the outside world save by climbing to the top
of the enclosure, which few towns-people in the daily round of
their lives ever took the trouble to do. So that, though close to
the turnpike-road, crimes might be perpetrated there unseen at
mid-day."|"The Mayor of Casterbridge"|"Thomas Hardy"

necessity for speech—and the poor woman leant against Henchard, who

to within a day or two, was overcast, and the weather threatening,
the wind having an unmistakable hint of water in it. Henchard
wished he had not been quite so sure about the continuance of a
fair season. But it was too late to modify or postpone, and the
proceedings went on. At twelve o'clock the rain began to fall,
small and steady, commencing and increasing so insensibly that it
was difficult to state exactly when dry weather ended or wet
established itself. In an hour the slight moisture resolved itself
into a monotonous smiting of earth by heaven, in torrents to which
no end could be prognosticated."|"The Mayor of Casterbridge"|"Thomas Hardy"

in the form of a brown liquor, the pig shivered in the wind, the
grain of the deal tables showed through the sticking tablecloths,
for the awning allowed the rain to drift under at its will, and to
enclose the sides at this hour seemed a useless undertaking. The
landscape over the river disappeared; the wind played on the
tent-cords in aeolian improvisations, and at length rose to such a

taken shelter within it having to crawl out on their hands and
