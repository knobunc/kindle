"ap > 05:00"|"after five"|"THE COUNTESS OLENSKA HAD said “after five”; and at half after the hour Newland Archer rang the bell of the peeling stucco house with a giant wistaria throttling its feeble cast-iron balcony, which she had hired, far down West Twenty-third Street, from the vagabond Medora."|"The Age of Innocence"|"Edith Wharton"
"ap 00:30"|"half of one"|"“Nor about what Cousin Louisa van der Luyden will think?”
“Not the half of one—if she thinks such old maid’s rubbish.”
“Mother is not an old maid,” said his virgin sister with pinched lips."|"The Age of Innocence"|"Edith Wharton"
"~ 00:00"|"about midnight"|"In the morning he had a spin in the ice-boat with his hostess and a few of the hardier guests; in the afternoon he “went over the farm” with Reggie, and listened, in the elaborately appointed stables, to long and impressive disquisitions on the horse; after tea he talked in a corner of the firelit hall with a young lady who had professed herself broken-hearted when his engagement was announced, but was now eager to tell him of her own matrimonial hopes; and finally, about midnight, he assisted in putting a goldfish in one visitor’s bed, dressed up a burglar in the bathroom of a nervous aunt, and saw in the small hours by joining in a pillow-fight that ranged from the nurseries to the basement. But on Sunday after luncheon he borrowed a cutter, and drove over to Skuytercliff."|"The Age of Innocence"|"Edith Wharton"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o‘clock"|"Mrs. van der Luyden had not yet returned; and Archer took his leave and walked off to fetch the cutter, while Beaufort followed the Countess Olenska indoors. It was probable that, little as the van der Luydens encouraged unannounced visits, he could count on being asked to dine, and sent back to the station to catch the nine o‘clock train; but more than that he would certainly not get, for it would be inconceivable to his hosts that a gentleman traveling without luggage should wish to spend the night, and distasteful to them to propose it to a person with whom they were on terms of such limited cordiality as Beaufort."|"The Age of Innocence"|"Edith Wharton"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"The young man, who was dining out, thrust the note into his pocket, smiling a little at the Frenchness of the “to you.” After dinner he went to a play; and it was not until his return home, after midnight, that he drew Madame Olenska’s missive out again and re-read it slowly a number of times. There were several ways of answering it, and he gave considerable thought to each one during the watches of an agitated night. That on which, when morning came, he finally decided was to pitch some clothes into a portman teau and jump on board a boat that was leaving that very afternoon for St. Augustine."|"The Age of Innocence"|"Edith Wharton"
"ap 02:00"|"two o‘clock"|"Mrs. Welland smiled compassionately. “That is just like the extraordinary things that foreigners invent about us. They think we dine at two o‘clock and countenance divorce! That is why it seems to me so foolish to entertain them when they come to New York. They accept our hospitality, and then they go home and repeat the same stupid stories.”"|"The Age of Innocence"|"Edith Wharton"
"ap 08:30"|"half past eight"|"It was only half past eight, after all, when he rang the bell under the wistaria; not as late as he had intended by half an hour—but a singular restlessness had driven him to her door. He reflected, however, that Mrs. Struthers’s Sunday evenings were not like a ball, and that her guests, as if to minimize their delinquency, usually went early."|"The Age of Innocence"|"Edith Wharton"
"ap < 09:00"|"nearly nine o’clock"|"“Ah—ah—you never think of wit! How merciless he is to us weak mortals, Mr. Archer! But he lives only in the life of the spirit; and tonight he is mentally preparing the lecture he is to deliver presently at Mrs. Blenker’s. Dr. Carver, would there be time, before you start for the Blenkers’ to explain to Mr. Archer your illuminating discovery of the Direct Contract? But no; I see it is nearly nine o’clock, and we have no right to detain you while so many are waiting for your message.”"|"The Age of Innocence"|"Edith Wharton"
"ap 03:00"|"3 o‘clock"|"Professor and Mrs. Emerson Sillerton request the pleasure of Mr. and Mrs. Welland’s company at the meeting of the Wednesday Afternoon Club on 25 August at 3 o‘clock punctually. To meet Mrs. and the Misses Blenker."|"The Age of Innocence"|"Edith Wharton"
"ap 03:00"|"Three o‘clock"|"Mr. Welland sighed nervously. “‘Some of us,’ my dear—more than one? Three o‘clock is such a very awkward hour. I have to be here at half-past three to take my drops: it’s really no use trying to follow Bencomb’s new treatment if I don’t do it systematically; and if I join you later, of course I shall miss my drive.” At the thought he laid down his knife and fork again, and a flush of anxiety rose to his finely-wrinkled cheek."|"The Age of Innocence"|"Edith Wharton"

"ap ~ 03:30"|"about half past three"|"“There’s no reason why you should go at all, my dear,” his wife answered with a cheerfulness that had become automatic. “I have some cards to leave at the other end of Bellevue Avenue, and I’ll drop in at about half past three and stay long enough to make poor Amy feel that she hasn’t been slighted.” She glanced hesitatingly at her daughter. “And if Newland’s afternoon is provided for perhaps May can drive you out with the ponies, and try their new russet harness.”"|"The Age of Innocence"|"Edith Wharton"
"ap 02:00"|"two o‘clock"|"The idea of the stud-farm and the brougham horse had germinated in Archer’s mind on the very day when the Emerson Sillerton invitation had first been mentioned; but he had kept it to himself as if there were something clandestine in the plan, and discovery might prevent its execution. He had, however, taken the precaution to engage in advance a run-about with a pair of old livery-stable trotters that could still do their eighteen miles on level  roads; and at two o‘clock, hastily deserting the luncheon-table, he sprang into the light carriage and drove off."|"The Age of Innocence"|"Edith Wharton"
"ap 03:00"|"three o‘clock"|"He had the feeling of unexplained excitement with which, on halfholidays at school, he used to start off into the unknown. Taking his pair at an easy gait, he counted on reaching the stud-farm, which was not far beyond Paradise Rocks, before three o‘clock; so that, after looking over the horse (and trying him if he seemed promising) he would still have four golden hours to dispose of."|"The Age of Innocence"|"Edith Wharton"
"ap 03:00"|"three o‘clock"|"When he reached the stud-farm a glance showed him that the horse was not what he wanted; nevertheless he took a turn behind it in order to prove to himself that he was not in a hurry. But at three o‘clock he shook out the reins over the trotters and turned into the by-roads leading to Portsmouth. The wind had dropped and a faint haze on the horizon showed that a fog was waiting to  steal up the Saconnet on the turn of the tide; but all about him fields and woods were steeped in golden light."|"The Age of Innocence"|"Edith Wharton"
"ap 09:30"|"half-past nine"|"He looked at his watch, and finding that it was half-past nine got up and went into the writing-room. There he wrote a few lines, and ordered a messenger to take a cab to the Parker House and wait for the answer. He then sat down behind another newspaper and tried to calculate how long it would take a cab to get to the Parker House."|"The Age of Innocence"|"Edith Wharton"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"She drew out a little gold-faced watch on an enameled chain. “Oh, don’t calculate,” he broke out; “give me the day! I want to get you away from that man. At what time was he coming?”
Her color rose again. “At eleven.”
“Then you must come at once.”"|"The Age of Innocence"|"Edith Wharton"
"ap 10:30"|"half-past ten"|"Archer held out his hand for the letter. “Shall I take it in?” he asked; but Madame Olenska, shaking her head, sprang out and disappeared through the glazed doors. It was barely half-past ten; but what if the emissary, impatient for her reply, and not knowing how  else to employ his time, were already seated among the travelers with cooling drinks at their elbows of whom Archer had caught a glimpse as she went in?"|"The Age of Innocence"|"Edith Wharton"
"ap > 00:00"|"after twelve o‘clock"|"Archer handed the note to his senior partner and a few minutes later was crawling northward in a crowded horse-car which he exchanged at Fourteenth Street for one of the high staggering omnibuses of the Fifth Avenue line. It was after twelve o‘clock when his laborious vehicle dropped him at old Catherine’s. The sitting room window on the ground floor, where she usually throned, was tenanted by the inadequate figure of her daughter, Mrs. Welland, who signed a haggard welcome as she caught sight of Archer; and at the door he was met by May. The hall wore the unnatural appearance peculiar to well-kept houses suddenly invaded by illness: wraps and furs  lay in heaps on the chairs, a doctor’s bag and overcoat were on the table, and beside them letters and cards had already piled up unheeded."|"The Age of Innocence"|"Edith Wharton"
"ap ~ 08:00"|"about eight o‘clock"|"May looked pale but smiling: Dr. Bencomb, who had just come for the second time, took a more hopeful view, and Mrs. Mingott’s dauntless determination to live and get well was already having an effect on her family. May led Archer into the old lady’s sitting room, where the sliding doors opening into the bedroom had been drawn shut, and the heavy yellow damask portières dropped over them; and here Mrs. Welland communicated to him in horrified undertones the details of the catastrophe. It appeared that the evening before something dreadful and mysterious had happened. At about eight o‘clock, just after Mrs. Mingott had finished the game of solitaire that she always played after dinner, the door-bell had rung, and a lady so thickly veiled that the servants did not immediately recognize her had asked to be received."|"The Age of Innocence"|"Edith Wharton"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"The butler, hearing a familiar voice, had thrown open the sitting room door, announcing: “Mrs. Julius Beaufort”—and had then closed it again on the two ladies. They must have been together, he thought, about an hour. When Mrs. Mingott’s bell rang Mrs. Beaufort had already slipped away unseen, and the old lady, white and vast and terrible, sat alone in her great chair, and signed to the butler to help her into her room. She seemed, at that time, though obviously distressed, in complete control of her body and brain. The mulatto maid put her to bed, brought her a cup of tea as usual, laid everything straight in the room, and went away; but at three in the morning the bell rang again, and the two servants, hastening in at this unwonted summons (for old Catherine usually slept like a baby), had found their mistress sitting up against her pillows with a crooked smile on her face and one little hand hanging limp from its huge arm."|"The Age of Innocence"|"Edith Wharton"
"ap 02:30"|"half-past two"|"“There’s the Art Museum—in the Park,” he explained, as she looked puzzled. “At half-past two. I shall be at the door ...”"|"The Age of Innocence"|"Edith Wharton"
00:00|midnight|"The sound of his laugh startled him. It recalled Janey’s midnight fright when she had caught him rocking with incomprehensible mirth over May’s telegram announcing that the date of their marriage had been advanced."|"The Age of Innocence"|"Edith Wharton"
"ap 05:30"|"half-past five"|"Dallas’s hand came down cheerily on his shoulder. “Hullo, Father: this is something like, isn’t it?” They stood for a while looking out in silence, and then the young man continued: “By the way, I’ve got a message for you: the Countess Olenska expects us both at half-past five.”"|"The Age of Innocence"|"Edith Wharton"
"ap < 06:00"|"nearly six"|"Archer remained motionless, gazing at the upper windows as if the end of their pilgrimage had been attained.
“I say, you know, it’s nearly six,” his son at length reminded him.
The father glanced away at an empty bench under the trees."|"The Age of Innocence"|"Edith Wharton"
