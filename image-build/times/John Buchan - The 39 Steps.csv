            with two minutes to spare. The feel of the hard third-class cushions and the smell
            of stale tobacco cheered me up wonderfully. At any rate, I felt now that I was getting
            to grips with my job."|"The 39 Steps"|"John Buchan"
"~ 20:00"|"About eight o’clock in the evening"|"I was decanted at Crewe in the small hours and had to wait till six to get a train
            for Birmingham. In the afternoon I got to Reading, and changed into a local train
            which journeyed into the deeps of Berkshire. Presently I was in a land of lush water-meadows
            and slow reedy streams. About eight o’clock in the evening, a weary and travel-stained
            being—a cross between a farm-labourer and a vet—with a checked black-and-white plaid
            over his arm (for I did not dare to wear it south of the Border), descended at the
            little station of Artinswell. There were several people on the platform, and I thought
            I had better wait to ask my way till I was clear of the place."|"The 39 Steps"|"John Buchan"

            to speak to the First Lord and the Secretary for War, and they are bringing Royer
            over a day sooner. This wire clinches it. He will be in London at five. Odd that the

            eleven"|"When I first came to London I had bought a car and amused myself with running about
            the south of England, so I knew something of the geography. I took Sir Walter to town
            by the Bath Road and made good going. It was a soft breathless June morning, with
            a promise of sultriness later, but it was delicious enough swinging through the little
            towns with their freshly watered streets, and past the summer gardens of the Thames
            valley. I landed Sir Walter at his house in Queen Anne’s Gate punctually by half-past
            eleven. The butler was coming up by train with the luggage."|"The 39 Steps"|"John Buchan"
"ap ~ 09:30"|"about half-past nine"|"The upshot was that about half-past nine I made up my mind to go to Queen Anne’s Gate.

"ap 10:30"|"half-past ten"|"For twenty minutes I sat there, wondering what I was to do next. I was still perfectly
            convinced that I was wanted, but when or how I had no notion. I kept looking at my
            watch, and as the time crept on to half-past ten I began to think that the conference
            must soon end. In a quarter of an hour Royer should be speeding along the road to
            Portsmouth …"|"The 39 Steps"|"John Buchan"

22:17|"10.17 P.M."|"Then I had a sudden thought, and hunted up all the steamer sailings. There was no

22:17|"10.17 P.M."|"(1) Place where there are several sets of stairs; one that matters distinguished by
               having thirty-nine steps.
(2) Full tide at 10.17 P.M. Leaving shore only possible at full tide.
(3) Steps not dock steps, and so place probably not harbour."|"The 39 Steps"|"John Buchan"
"ap 10:17"|10.17|"‘Here’s the most I can make of it,’ I said. ‘We have got to find a place where there
            are several staircases down to the beach, one of which has thirty-nine steps. I think
            it’s a piece of open coast with biggish cliffs, somewhere between the Wash and the
            Channel. Also it’s a place where full tide is at 10.17 tomorrow night.’"|"The 39 Steps"|"John Buchan"
"~ 01:00"|"About one in the morning"|"About one in the morning the coastguard man arrived. He was a fine old fellow, with
            the look of a naval officer, and was desperately respectful to the company. I left
            the War Minister to cross-examine him, for I felt he would think it cheek in me to
            talk."|"The 39 Steps"|"John Buchan"

"ap ~ 04:00"|"About four o’clock"|"I spent a warm and peaceful afternoon. We caught between us about twenty pounds of
            cod and lythe, and out in that dancing blue sea I took a cheerier view of things.
            Above the white cliffs of the Ruff I saw the green and red of the villas, and especially
            the great flagstaff of Trafalgar Lodge. About four o’clock, when we had fished enough,
            I made the boatman row us round the yacht, which lay like a delicate white bird, ready
            at a moment to flee. Scaife said she must be a fast boat for her build, and that she
            was pretty heavily engined."|"The 39 Steps"|"John Buchan"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"It was now getting on for eight o’clock, and I went back and saw Scaife to give him
            his instructions. I arranged with him how to place his men, and then I went for a
            walk, for I didn’t feel up to any dinner. I went round the deserted golf-course, and
            then to a point on the cliffs farther north beyond the line of the villas."|"The 39 Steps"|"John Buchan"
"ap ~ 09:30"|"about half-past nine"|"On the little trim newly-made roads I met people in flannels coming back from tennis
            and the beach, and a coastguard from the wireless station, and donkeys and pierrots
            padding homewards. Out at sea in the blue dusk I saw lights appear on the Ariadne and on the destroyer away to the south, and beyond the Cock sands the bigger lights
            of steamers making for the Thames. The whole scene was so peaceful and ordinary that
            I got more dashed in spirits every second. It took all my resolution to stroll towards
            Trafalgar Lodge about half-past nine."|"The 39 Steps"|"John Buchan"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"A little thing, lasting only a second, and the odds were a thousand to one that I
            might have had my eyes on my cards at the time and missed it. But I didn’t, and, in
            a flash, the air seemed to clear. Some shadow lifted from my brain, and I was looking
            at the three men with full and absolute recognition.
The clock on the mantelpiece struck ten o’clock.
The three faces seemed to change before my eyes and reveal their secrets. The young
            one was the murderer. Now I saw cruelty and ruthlessness, where before I had only
            seen good-humour. His knife, I made certain, had skewered Scudder to the floor. His
            kind had put the bullet in Karolides."|"The 39 Steps"|"John Buchan"

            your train. Bob’s got to go to town tonight,’ he added, turning to me. The voice rang
            now as false as hell. I looked at the clock, and it was nearly half-past ten."|"The 39 Steps"|"John Buchan"
