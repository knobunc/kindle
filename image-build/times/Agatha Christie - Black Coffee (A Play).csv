To begin with, as you now realize, those two doors’ – he gestured towards the two doors on the hall side of the library – ‘are locked on the outside. From my study next door, there is no way out except through this room. The french windows in this room are locked.’ Swivelling around in his seat to Carelli, he explained, as though in parenthesis, ‘Locked, in fact, by a patent device of my own, which my family knows of, but which they do not know how to immobilize.’ Again addressing everyone, Sir Claud continued, ‘This place is a rat-trap.’ He looked at his watch. ‘It is now ten minutes to nine. At a few minutes past nine, the rat-catcher will arrive.’"|"Black Coffee (A Play)"|"Agatha Christie"

While Hastings listened and observed from a comfortable position on the settee, the detective asked Richard Amory to recount in detail the events of the evening, prior to his, Poirot’s, arrival. When he had concluded his recital of events, Richard, sitting in the chair which his father had occupied the previous evening, added, ‘Well, that’s about everything, I think.
