The blinding stench of tear gas brought back memories, but only on the surface. Around midnight on Wednesday I found myself reeling around completely blind on Washington Avenue in front of the convention hall, bumping against cops wearing black rubber gas masks and running demonstrators clutching wet towels over their faces. Many of the cops were wearing khaki flak jackets and waving three-foot hickory pick-handles… but nobody hit me, and despite the gas and the chaos, I never felt in danger. Finally, when the gas got so bad that I no longer knew what direction I was moving in, I staggered across somebody’s lawn and began feeling my way along the outside of the house until I came to a water faucet. I sat down on the grass and soaked my handkerchief under the tap, then pressed it on my face, without rubbing, until I was able to see again.

I think what we… what we all thought would happen would be that… They had a giant press room set up with a free bar, about fifty typewriters, and six TV consoles at one end of the room and I think the general impression was that we’d sort of filter in there about 6 o’clock… which would be seven, Eastern Time… when the polls closed in New York and Massachusetts… and we would sort of watch the deal go down slowly. I think we all assumed that by midnight it would be over. The only question was how bad it would be… But what happened as it turned out was that… well, I decided rather than go to the press room, I’d go up and watch the first TV returns with some of McGovern’s closest staff people. It seemed more fitting somehow to go up to the ninth floor where most of the staffers were staying and watch the first returns with some of McGovern’s key people, the ones who were closest to him. I knew that John Holum and Sandy Berger, two speech writers, were staying in a room up there, so I picked up the house phone in the lobby about 6:15… I’d heard that some of the results had come in but I didn’t know what they were at that point… and it didn’t seem to make much difference… Too early, I thought… when Holum answered I asked if he was busy and if he wasn’t I’d like to come up and have a drink and sit around and wait for the results… He said, “Don’t bother… It’s all over… We’ve been wiped… Shit, we’re losing everything!”"|"Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72"|"Hunter S.

I could see that he’d been crying… and… he’s not the kind of person you’d expect to see walking around in public with tears all over his face. I said why don’t you sit down and have a beer, or some pea soup or whatever… And he said, “No, I think it’s about time to go upstairs and write the statement.” He was going up to write McGovern’s concession statement and… you could see he was about to crack again… and that’s what he did, he turned and walked out of the coffee shop and into the elevator."|"Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72"|"Hunter S.

"~ 05:00"|"about 5 in the morning"|"HST: McGovern places a large part of the blame for his defeat on the press. He did before the election, and even now he’s still doing it. The Eagleton affair turned him brutally against the press. He thought they were crucifying him and leaving Nixon alone… and he was right, on one level. But what he ignored was the fact that, first, he was out in the open and committing these blunders that the press couldn’t ignore… while Nixon was not out in the open and committing no blunders… or at least none that the press could pin on him. The Watergate thing came about as close as anything and the Washington Post worked that one about as heavily as any newspaper could. But McGovern throughout the campaign blamed the press for taking advantage of his… of what he called his “open campaign”… as if… he opened up his house to guests and they came in and pissed all over the floor and ripped off his silver and… you know… raped the children… that sort of thing… But I think one of the best examples of the way the press people felt that night showed up in these few pieces of paper I found in the typewriter about 5 in the morning in the press room. I was just sort of wandering around… There was an odd sense of not wanting to go to sleep… because that would have been giving up… In a scene like that you get a weird feeling that maybe if you stay up a little longer, maybe something good might happen… but Colorado was the only bright spot in the country that night…"|"Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72"|"Hunter S.

Nervous ushers roamed up and down the aisles, confiscating alcoholic beverages and occasionally grappling with drunkards.

"ap < 00:58"|"almost 2 to 1"|"1. Both the New Hampshire and Florida primaries were scheduled for early March so sometime in late February I left McGovern up in New Hampshire and went down to Florida to check on Muskie and Lindsay. Lindsay had just made a strong showing in the Arizona delegate-selection caucuses, running even with Muskie and beating McGovern almost 2 to 1. All he needed in Florida was 20 percent of the Democratic vote—which seemed entirely possible at the time. A Lindsay “win” in Florida would have changed the race entirely. There were twelve candidates in the primary and in February the wizards were saying that no one of them could hope to poll more than 25 or 30 percent of the vote. Muskie was still a front-runner and George Wallace had only recently decided to enter the race as a Democrat, rather than as an American Independent. McGovern was running out of money and had already decided to cut his losses in Florida and go for broke in Wisconsin several weeks later. So if Lindsay had made a strong showing in Florida—even running second or close third to Muskie—he would probably have crippled McGovern’s image as a candidate of the Democratic Left. When I arrived in Miami, the consensus of the local pols was that the Democratic primary would probably come down to a relatively close race between Muskie and Lindsay, with Humphrey and Wallace splitting the right-wing vote and McGovern grappling for the booby prize with Shirley Chisholm."|"Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72"|"Hunter S.

"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"1. I had a talk with Mankiewicz about this shortly after the Wisconsin primary. I don’t recall what town we were in, but it might have been Columbus—or maybe Cleveland. It was sometime after midnight in a ratty hotel room and my memory of the conversation is hazy, due to massive ingestion of booze, fatback, and forty cc’s of adrenochrome. In any case the Bobby Kennedy voice tapes were never used again. By mid-May, however, when it was obvious that Hubert Humphrey was the only remaining obstacle between George and the nomination, there were other Kennedy voices supporting McGovern. The whole clan was actively campaigning for him and even Teddy was saying that he would do everything he could for George except run on the same ticket with him."|"Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72"|"Hunter S.
