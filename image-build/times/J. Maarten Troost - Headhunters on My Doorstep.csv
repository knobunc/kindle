I know: Pot meet kettle. I have considerable expertise in asshole-dom, it’s true. I know of what I speak. Leave the kids at home alone late at night as I go out and search for one more bottle. Passing out midday and forgetting to pick up these very same children from school. The endless lies. The going off on weekends so I could quote work unquote and drink myself into oblivion. And these are the people I love more dearly than life itself, and yet, in the throes of addiction, that was what I was reduced to—an asshole. It’s why in meetings, I think we need to change our standard greeting. It should be: Hi, I’m Maarten. And I’m an assoholic. The recent advances in the neuroscience of addiction are all well and good, but for the afflicted, in order to move on, it’s best to acknowledge what, exactly, we truly are when we imbibe—incorrigible assholes."|"Headhunters on My Doorstep"|"J.

18:00|"6:00 P.M."|"On the boat, as everywhere in Polynesia, were a few more European pensioners, Italians and French. They’re all, like, fifty-five and spend their time traveling the world. I spoke to a Frenchman who had been a ship’s pilot on Réunion Island, retired, and now was traveling with his wife for two months throughout French Polynesia and ruminating on whether or not to take a house on Moorea for another three. Meanwhile, one of the Italians on board was forever standing and falling on the rest of us as he tried to take pictures from a speedboat that was rocking along as fast as its twin engines could take it. Rarely have I seen anyone so clumsy or oblivious of other people or common sense. He was of the type who dawdle on the sidewalk, five abreast, at 6:00 P.M. as everyone else rushes to catch a subway, or who drive thirty-five mph in the fast lane, making phone calls and texting, as others swerve around him, giving him the bird, which he never ever sees. I’m not sure why these thoughts occurred to me. Was I becoming a type-A kind of person?"|"Headhunters on My Doorstep"|"J. Maarten Troost"

The mahu are physically male but, since time immemorial, have been raised as females. Often it was the eldest boy, who was groomed to help with the household chores, including cooking and tending to the younger siblings. Some eventually grew out of being the designated mahu and eventually married and had children of their own. Many, however, whether due to nature or nuture, embraced the designation. Polynesians, notoriously, have a very elastic sense of sexuality and if a man hooked up with the village mahu, it wasn’t a gay thing or a straight thing, but just kind of an island thing. In other cultures, of course, effeminate boys are bullied and jeered, but not so in Tahiti, which, like elsewhere in Polynesia, long ago acknowledged that some are men or women and some are neither and both. Today, the mahu are mahu by choice and many have breast implants and wear dresses and sashay and are so over the top in their femininity that they could only be really campy men.

We sat outdoors, in the kitchen fare, as he introduced me to everyone, a dozen or so family members, Tahitians all. It was a birthday party for a three-year-old boy, who sat happily singing as the ocean shimmered behind him. There was a long rigmarole about wine, and the superiority of light California wines for the noontime meal. French wines are too heavy for the afternoon, don’t you think? Well, I’m not real particular anymore. We could just dispense with the wine altogether and go straight to the vodka and then I could join my friend, the Angel of Mercy, but I thought that would be impolite to say, so I said that I was bon with just water."|"Headhunters on My Doorstep"|"J.

Fortunately, this didn’t seem to be a problem on Tarawa since as far as I could tell everything remained exactly like it had been, as if it were frozen in a teardrop of amber. It was, even at 9:00 A.M., staggeringly hot, a kind of heat that seeps into your bones, crumbling them into ash. I walked across the tarmac, breathing in the heady humidity of the equatorial Pacific. The terminal was exactly as I remembered it, made of cinder blocks, wood, and tin, with hand-painted signs. One sign informed us that it was for TRANSIT, and I looked around and wondered to where. I was a trifle worried about getting through Immigration. I dimly expected to be greeted with a raspy voice saying, We’ve been waiting for you to come back, and then I’d be hustled on board a Royal Thai Navy plane and flown to Kwajalein, but the immigration officer was too busy cracking jokes with the other passengers to give me anything other than an arrival stamp."|"Headhunters on My Doorstep"|"J.

12:00|noon|"On Sunday, I went to church. It’s something I’d never done before on Tarawa, possibly because when I lived here, I was still at that age when sleeping until noon on the weekend seemed like a sensible and natural thing to do. One of the surest signs of advancing years, of course, occurs when you begin to regard 8:00 A.M. as a provocatively late hour to rise from your slumbers, a wanton disregard for the preciousness of time. But I wanted to go to church because it’s a good place to mull things over, and I was confronted with a dilemma. Robert Louis Stevenson spent several months in Kiribati, traveling from island to island on board the Equator, though he only wrote about two, Butaritari and Abemama. These chapters, coming toward the end of In the South Seas, are the book’s liveliest, and it is no wonder. Butaritari was then the commercial hub of the Gilbert Islands, so visited by copra traders that the island supported not one but two bars, The Land We Live In “being tacitly reserved to the forecastle,” as Stevenson described the clientele, “and the Sans Souci tacitly reserved for the afterguard.” Typically, the I-Kiribati were forbidden to drink, but the king of Butaritari, Tebureimoa, attired in “pajamas which sorrowfully misbecame his bulk,” had lifted the taboo on alcohol to commemorate July Fourth, the American Independence Day, and for the previous ten days “the town had been passing the bottle or lying . . . in hoggish sleep.”"|"Headhunters on My Doorstep"|"J.

I was very pleased to have made it this far without succumbing to the voice that says just one or just today, and I was wary of pressing my luck. I was conscientious about avoiding bars. At 5:00 P.M., I typically went for a run and let my endorphins carry me through the hours when I was most likely to have a wandering mind, and I hesitated to alter a routine that had served me well.

There is a riot of color, hues of blue so radiant that you’d swear someone slipped you a tab of acid, and below, just beneath the surface, were clumps of coral in ardent bloom surrounded by schools of darting fish. I was in the wheelhouse, sharing a bench with a woman nursing an infant. The captain lay sprawled beneath me on the floor, snoozing through the torpor of midday. At the helm was a one-eyed sailor wearing hot-pink Capri shorts. A gold hoop dangled from his ear. Another crew member offered me a plastic mug of sweetened tea, and I sat contentedly watching this wonderland go by."|"Headhunters on My Doorstep"|"J. Maarten Troost"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"This snapped me awake. There was much to lose. My eyes regained their focus as I saw my friend the albatross swoop low for another pass. I took a deep breath and tried not to think of the bar three decks above. What exactly was transpiring here? A craving, sure. A bad one, no doubt. But why now? Was it the impending approach of five o’clock, a rooster’s crow for lushes everywhere? Not likely, I thought. Happy hour had long ago lost its frisson. Christopher Hitchens once said that he drinks “because it makes other people less boring.” I’d read a lot of Hitchens when I was trying to justify my drinking. If he could write like that, I reckoned, while getting blotto every day, well then, everything must be just peachy with me. Of course, when I finally did stop drinking I discovered the other side of that equation: When you’re sober, drinkers are curiously boring. For a long while I could only walk by a bar at dusk with finger-gnawing longing. I’d hear the laughter and the clink of glasses—or even catch a waft of stale beer and Lysol—and I’d have to quicken my pace. I’ll never have fun again, I’d think, as I hurried home to my steaming cup of herbal tea. But after a few months, when I finally felt confident that I was unlikely to start pounding shots of Jägermeister, I’d occasionally meet friends at a pub. As I sipped a club soda, I’d immediately scope out those who belonged to my tribe—the solitary drinkers hunched over their phones, the anxious woman with the shaky hands waiting for her pinot grigio, the two college students on their third pitcher, the bartender sneaking shots—and I’d feel a special camaraderie. It’s like gaydar for alcoholics. And then, as the alcohol started to take its toll and people began repeating the same stories and their eyes got glassy and their coordination started to wither, and there in the corner, the woman who just slipped off her barstool, I’d think, no, I don’t really miss this and I’d think of myself as cured. Done. Finished. No worries."|"Headhunters on My Doorstep"|"J. Maarten Troost"
07:30|"seven thirty that morning"|"Finally it dawned on me why I was feeling so squirrely. I had boarded the ship at seven thirty that morning, having huffed my backpack the two miles it took to get from my guesthouse to the wharf, and when I climbed the gangplank I was handed a plastic cup of juice. Great, I thought. I’m thirsty. I brought the cup to my lips and then smelled something odd, like it was mixed with turpentine."|"Headhunters on My Doorstep"|"J. Maarten Troost"
07:30|"seven thirty in the morning"|"Who the fuck drinks rum at seven thirty in the morning? What was this? A booze cruise? A convention of active alcoholics? Maybe I should have read the brochure. You’ve heard of Leaving Las Vegas. Come experience Leaving Papeete. The only people I know who’ve turned to Captain Morgan for a pick-me-up in the early A.M. are late-stage alcoholics who pour it into their coffee mugs to stave off the shakes, the palpitating anxiety, the early onset of delirium tremens, seeking to forestall impending death and/or hospitalization. And now here I was, with a cup of rum punch in my hands, handed to me with a nod and a wink. Good times, bro. Time to get your buzz on. And it got worse . . . well, depending on your perspective. There was free wine at lunch. Entire bottles. Red and white. Now, I’m sure many, right at this very moment, have left the page to book their vacations, but for those still reading, let me say that setting down a couple of opened bottles of wine right in front of a newly recovered alcoholic, the kind of alcoholic who once thought of himself as a bit of a connoisseur, is like handing a pipe to a crackhead. I read the labels, a white Bourgogne and a Rhône red, and then read them again. That alcoholic voice inside my brain, usually a devilish whisper, was now pounding the drums, doing the rumba, putting on a party hat and shimmying on the dance floor. Come on, it said.

And it never came. The alcohol had stopped working. And this irritated me to no end. “I never saw you drunk during this time,” my wife would later note. Well, it certainly wasn’t for lack of trying. My tolerance, always high, now increased exponentially, and yet I’d never hit the sweet spot, the moment when I was suffused with a cheery warmth.

That intense craving I’d had just a few days prior left me tremulous with worry. It would be so easy, I knew, to relapse here, on a small ship in the middle of nowhere, filled with people drinking from noon to night, like vacationers without a worry in the world, passing the time over long wine-soaked lunches and dinners because there wasn’t much else to do. This, I knew, was not an ideal milieu for me. From time to time, my brain would zap me a message: Hey, it said, how about we change our no-drinking rule to no-drinking-on-terra-firma? That could work, right? That would free up boats, airplanes, and inner tubes. What do you say?
