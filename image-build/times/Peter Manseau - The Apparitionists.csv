"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"Daguerre discovered this himself during his earliest photographic efforts to document human activity. At eight o’clock one bright morning in 1838, he pointed his camera to the busy Boulevard du Temple in Paris. From his studio window he saw the crowded street, full as always with people and wagons going about the business of a new day. Yet despite what the artist’s eye could behold, when he examined the image he had made after an exposure of about twelve minutes, he noticed that only two figures were apparent: the dark outline of a bootblack stooped before a customer standing tall over him on a walkway that appeared otherwise empty. As Parisians rushed around them, these two were as still as the buildings and trees, and so they alone remained fixed for the future to see."|"The Apparitionists"|"Peter Manseau"
"ap ~ 05:00"|"about five o’clock"|"She was up about five o’clock yesterday p.m. to have her bed made as usual; was unusually cheerful and social; spoke of the pleasure of being with her dear husband in New York ere long; stepped into bed herself, fell back with a momentary struggle on her pillow, her eyes were immediately fixed, the paleness of death over-spread her countenance, and in five minutes more, without the slightest motion, her mortal life terminated."|"The Apparitionists"|"Peter Manseau"
"ap 02:07"|207|"Neither his studies nor his employment lasted very long, and soon Brady struck out on his own. Good with his hands and mechanically inclined, he advertised two kinds of business at two different addresses by the time he reached his twenty-fifth year. He was at once a “jewelry, miniature, and surgical case manufacturer” at 187 Broadway and the sole proprietor of a Daguerrean gallery at 207 Broadway."|"The Apparitionists"|"Peter Manseau"
00:00|midnight|"Other unfortunates who submitted to Serrell’s calipers and pen were no better off in Farnham’s eyes. The owner of a perfectly unremarkable head with a smoothly arching crown was guilty of “some of the most daring burglaries ever committed in New York” due to overdevelopment of the “organ of destructiveness.” Of a woman with a similarly ordinary-looking skull, it was decided, “She will doubtless spend her life in prison, for she is constitutionally a criminal.” On the good-news end of the spectrum, the shape of one convict’s cranium suggested to Farnham that there might be some small capacity within to know right from wrong, but “it is like the faintest gleam of starlight shining through the blackness of midnight.”"|"The Apparitionists"|"Peter Manseau"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"Soon the room became so full it was difficult for eager Spiritualists to pass through without bumping into each other. If a stray hand should jostle Fannie’s arm while she was summoning a spirit, “the nicely adjusted magnetic surroundings were so thoroughly disturbed that no further manifestations could be obtained.” Sensing Fannie’s displeasure, Berry made sure the doors closed at three o’clock sharp to avoid undue disturbances. On more than one occasion, he was forced to find a bigger room."|"The Apparitionists"|"Peter Manseau"
12:00|midday|"Some mornings in the first week of July began near ninety degrees. By afternoon, outdoor workers dropped from sunstroke in the street. Newspapermen, well versed in the art of transforming injury into column inches, carried on with daily casualty reports as if the war were still raging, though now with a new enemy. New York City, the Herald said, had become “too torrid for human endurance.” Evidence of this mapped the boroughs: at Third Avenue and Eighty-Fourth Street, an Irish laborer was “prostrated” by the heat and transported to Bellevue Hospital. In Brooklyn, a teamster fainted under the midday glare and was crushed by the wheels of his cart as it crossed Myrtle Avenue. In Greenwich Village, a private of the 1st New York Cavalry Regiment died of heat exhaustion barely a week after mustering out."|"The Apparitionists"|"Peter Manseau"
"ap 06:30"|630|"With Gerry’s questions walking him through his visit, Hickey reported that after leaving the studio that day, he discovered that Mumler “had practiced similar deceptions in Boston until he could no longer remain there.” With a believer’s ardor and an immigrant’s zeal to protect his new home, he had resolved to take his concern about the spiritual crimes being committed at 630 Broadway directly to the highest office in the city."|"The Apparitionists"|"Peter Manseau"
"ap 07:07"|707|"With Gurney’s own studio at 707 Broadway, it was but a short walk downtown to visit Mumler, to watch the spirit photographer at work, which he did at the request of a wealthy Spiritualist shortly before the trial began. “I have been a photographer for twenty-eight years,” Gurney testified. “I have witnessed Mumler’s process, and although I went prepared to scrutinize everything, I could find nothing which savoured of fraud or trickery.”"|"The Apparitionists"|"Peter Manseau"

When he called court to order at ten that Monday morning, he instructed the attorneys for both sides to deliver their concluding remarks. As soon as they had finished, he would offer judgment."|"The Apparitionists"|"Peter Manseau"
