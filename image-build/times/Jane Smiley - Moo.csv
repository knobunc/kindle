Certainly, she could not have. Living in Dubuque House lowered her expenses below even what they would have been at the University of Illinois, where she would have had in-state tuition, and so she was here, sitting on her bunk with her suitcases, watching her roommates arrive and smiling every time one of them or one of their parents looked her way. Her bus from Chicago had gotten in at seven a.m. but she tried hard not to show the effects of her long night—four hours in the bus station because her sister had to drop her off before going to work, then ten hours on the bus next to a very small white man in dark blue Keds who stared at the ceiling with his eyes open and kept his hands folded in his lap the whole time, even when they stopped for a snack and a rest-room break. His likeness to a corpse had been contradicted only by his occasional giggles, unaccompanied by movement or change of any kind, and toward the middle of the night, Mary had begun to wonder if he were some sort of a robot or mechanical man being sent secretly from one lab to another, more cheaply on the bus than by UPS Next Day Air."|Moo|"Jane Smiley"

Because of course those heady days of the sixties had proved hollow and illusory.

She had actually transferred funds out of the athletic budget into the library budget from time to time, possibly her most dangerous covert action. The result was, though, that she could now, bit by bit, during breaks and minutes of free time, track Arlen Martin and the TransNationalAmerica Corporation through the Wall Street Journal index, Facts on File, Commercial and Industrial blah-blah, Acquisitions and Mergers International, etc. There were plenty of articles about Martin. He had allowed himself to be interviewed by everyone from USAir’s in-flight magazine to Life magazine to Business Week to a weekly newspaper from the suburbs of Amarillo, Texas, to Der Spiegel and British Vogue. At the same time, his holdings were a secretive and complex web of interlocking companies, some apparently just names and boards of directors, others actual businesses. Tracing his ownership and influence amounted, at first, to recognizing recurrent names, then intuiting relationships and duties from the positions and companies attached to them. After a while, she could track his restless interests. One of them, and an odd one compared to the others, she thought, was mining. Around Christmas, the TransNationalAmerica Corporation, through two intermediaries, had acquired the Seven Stones Mining Corporation, home office, Denver, Colorado. And Martin had paid a lot for it. She turned back to the Wall Street Journal index, and found an article headlined “Once Powerful Enough to Topple Governments: Mineral Industry Now in Doldrums.” She transferred herself to university E-mail, and left a note for Library Media: “Please send a copy of the following article to provost’s office.” She cited the article. Her instincts, which were not only naturally good, but muscular from use, told her that, speaking of mining, she had found a very productive seam. She logged off and stood up.

He watched “NBC Nightly News.” He did not eat pork and any sort of beans made him gassy. He would not sleep on the second floor. There would be no television watching or radio listening on Sunday, and only a cold dinner on Sunday and Wednesday. These were all, said Father to Nils, rules that he lived by and was too old to change. Furthermore, to be perfectly candid, he thought Marly and Nils were both too old to get married, and so he disapproved of their plans and, since he disapproved, he didn’t feel obliged to change his style of life to accommodate them. When Nils’ hopes had begun to rise just a degree at this last remark, Father had dashed them again at once: The one good thing about the whole deal was, in Father’s opinion, that he could sell his little house that he’d paid twelve thousand dollars for twenty-five years ago, and the realtor fellow said he might be able to get forty or even forty-five for it."|Moo|"Jane Smiley"

She always slept without any clothes on, so as she turned and stretched, her left hand slid over her flat stomach and her lean hip, and came to rest on her thigh [Gary ran his hand down over his T-shirt and pants to see if this was possible]. The Lydia she was dreaming about did the same thing, and someone, somewhere, some Lydia that was viewing both the dreamer and the dreamed, felt a sense of surprise, because in the dream Lydia had a hugely fat stomach that fell in rolls onto the sheet [This was really good. Just that evening, Gary had been watching something on PBS about people who could make themselves conscious that they were dreaming but not wake up]. Now the Lydia in the dream woke up and saw that it was noon, but the dreaming Lydia did not wake up, though she was aware that it must be noon or even later. The dreaming Lydia said, “You two kids are in here, aren’t you?” and two little voices replied, “Yes, Mommy,” but Lydia couldn’t see them because the room was so dark."|Moo|"Jane Smiley"

C. Boyle. That meant he didn’t get back to the apartment he was borrowing (no tree, no decorations, no Christmas carols, no women, no children) until nearly dawn. At six on Christmas Day, he called his mother on the Cape and asked if she got the basket he’d sent from Williams-Sonoma. She had—she was just going out the door, she would call him tomorrow.

That was, in general, fine, but just today it seemed like she might have chosen, say, red, to give the room a more festive air.

Across from it, there was a companion work that included the rest of the Sex Pistols. These were the only decorations in the bedroom.

I could lie there with my eyes closed and contemplate the universal darkness or, if I was in a different mood, I could contemplate the random scatterings of light. Darkness or light. Darkness THEN light. It worked. Every night I eased off into perfect rest, and slept eight productive hours. That was the point. I wasn’t like some of the others, who really got excited devising experiments or arguing about strong force and weak force. Apart from getting to sleep, my only real interest was how Oppenheimer got all those warring personalities to live together in the desert.

She dodged right, then dodged left, avoiding the seething streams of students rushing to classes on the side of the campus that she was just leaving. Then, of course, there were other clots of students, talking, kissing, teasing each other, and flirting. There were professors with briefcases striding right down the center of the walks and people on bicycles shouting, “On your left!” as if, were you to step into their path, your injuries would be your fault. Even though the walks were partly covered with ice, there were also Rollerbladers—one swept around Keri from behind and zoomed ahead—he was in her class, in fact, and always wore his skates right onto the elevator and into the room. Ahead, in the distance, she could hear the rumbling collapse of bricks and mortar, but she didn’t register the noise, much less wonder what it was."|Moo|"Jane Smiley"

She made a mental note to call the demolition company and find out if the university was being charged for time and costs or by the bid. Across the site, standing in the middle of Ames Road, she noticed that little man from the horticulture department with his head down and his hands in his pockets."|Moo|"Jane Smiley"
"ap 11:30"|11:30|"KERI WAS walking slowly, all alone, back toward Dubuque House. She had not made her class, and the statistics professor had locked the door, the way he always did, just at the tick of 11:30. She was looking at her feet, but as she went behind Berkeley Hall, just on the side where they were tearing something down, she noticed the dust in the air and glanced up."|Moo|"Jane Smiley"
19:53|1953|"What is a university? Ivar couldn’t help but pause and wonder. When he’d first come to this particular university, at eighteen, he had easily found what he was looking for. It was 1953, and angular men in glasses, crewcuts, and bow ties were everywhere, a benign army of uncles, who liked to point things out with the stems of their pipes. He and Nils had themselves worn crewcuts and bow ties and answered to “Mr. Harstad” whenever they were called upon in class. Across the campus, in their own compound, protected by parietal rules and housemothers, the girls in their circle skirts and sweater sets were clearly a species apart, and were clearly being groomed for a mating ritual that Ivar and Nils eventually elected not to participate in, choosing instead to join the uncles. The place was merely a college then, a group of colleagues. It made no claims to universality."|Moo|"Jane Smiley"
"ap 04:30"|4:30|"We will have our first meeting at the new garden site beside the bus barns on Tuesday at 4:30. I urge you to accept the extremely unpromising nature of this site as a challenge. Our preliminary surveys of the spot show that the soil is mostly clay, and remarkably compacted. Part of the site was originally a wetland, which was filled in in the 1950s with some waste matter from the university. We have not yet determined the composition of the fill, but given the university’s checkered past, we may be in for an ugly surprise. The good news is that the state Department of Natural Resources has agreed to help fund cleanup of the site and restoration of the original wetland area. I have also just received word that an adjoining tract of some three hundred acres has been sold to the Nature Conservancy. Our “garden” may look considerably different when we are finished from our former garden outside Old Meats, but the possibilities are exciting ones. Please bring any preliminary ideas and sketches to the Tuesday meeting."|Moo|"Jane Smiley"

Instead of striding off, Dr. Lionel Gift looked around at the—the—yes, the indifferent Georgetown row houses, the indifferent shops and the shining indifferent cars, the indifferent sidewalks and the indifferent intersections, all seething under the indifferent sky with homines economici, who were all themselves indifferent, at least toward Dr. Lionel Gift."|Moo|"Jane Smiley"
15:37|"3:37 p.m."|"ALTHOUGH IT WAS 3:37 p.m. by the hall clock when Nils Harstad came downstairs for the first time that day, he was still wearing his robe, his pajamas, and his slippers. He made an immediate right and went into the kitchen, avoiding as if by instinct all the windows in the hall, dining room, living room, and sunporch that spilled the glorious day outside into the huge, old, empty, and neglected brick house."|Moo|"Jane Smiley"
"ap < 02:00"|"almost two"|"PROFESSOR GARCIA, best man, handed Chairman X the ring. It was a real ring, one that Garcia had persuaded the Chairman, known tightwad, to spring for. The Chairman took the ring, and Garcia saw all of the children’s gazes lock onto it and watch it slip from his grasp onto her finger. Garcia’s own gaze fell on them, the four youthful protagonists, thirteen, ten, six, and almost two, for whom this climactic ceremony would henceforward be the merest backdrop to the infinitely larger dramas of their own lives. That’s what he loved about weddings, the way each one was the beginning of it all."|Moo|"Jane Smiley"
