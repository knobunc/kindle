Three o'clock in the morning.
The occasional crack of heavy-caliber gunfire, punctuated by the boom of a black-powder cannon, split the nighttime quiet outside the castle walls. Nobody was getting much sleep, least of all the guards who hunkered down in the courtyard around the central keep, night-vision goggles active, waiting for a sign."|"The Revolution Business"|"Charles Stross"
12:00|noonday|"The world flashed white, twice, in a tenth of the beat of a heart. Everything was white as the face of the noonday sun, except for the knife-edge shadow of Sir Geraunt, freakishly cast across Otto's upper body and head."|"The Revolution Business"|"Charles Stross"
04:00|"four o'clock in the morning"|"Which was why, at four o'clock in the morning, instead of being sound asleep in bed, Erasmus was sitting in the passenger cab of a steamer, facing backwards, knee to knee with two strapping militiamen and nose to nose with Supervisor Philips, as it screamed up the broad boulevard fronting the East River at the head of a column of loudly buzzing motorcycle combinations. They were heading for the Propaganda Ministry offices in Bronckborough, to catch them at the tail end of a quiet graveyard shift. For lack of any other distraction, he scrutinized Philips closely; in his long black coat and forage cap he resembled a hungry crow."|"The Revolution Business"|"Charles Stross"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o'clock"|"""Enjoy it while you can, Steve."" Burgeson grinned like a skull. ""Seize the front page!"" They came to the door leading to the third floor landing, and the stairs up to the soundproofed broadcasting pulpits. ""You'll have to excuse me: I've got a speech to record for the nine o'clock news, and then I'll be in the Minister's office, working up our schedule for the next week."""|"The Revolution Business"|"Charles Stross"

"ap 01:52"|"One fifty-two"|"The machine buzzed as the cuff inflated. Thirty seconds passed, then it began to tick and hiss, venting compressed air. Finally it deflated with a sigh. ""Shit. One fifty-two over ninety-five. Right, that's it for this run. I got a definite ouch."""|"The Revolution Business"|"Charles Stross"
"ap 04:00"|"four o'clock"|"""A tenth of a point of gross,"" said Olga. ""But you don't have to say yes now. Miriam is holding a meeting in a few days of her accomplices and confidantes. If you are interested, you may attend."" She slid a business card across the table. ""Phone this number no later than four o'clock tomorrow afternoon and say yes or no, then follow the post officer's instructions; they will see you across. The nature of the business, and your role in it, is such that if you choose to decline the offer, you have nothing to fear-you could spill everything you know, and the US government would learn nothing of use. Oh, and she sends you this. You can treat it as a nonreturnable advance against wages."" She slid a checkbook across the table to rest atop the card. ""Half a million bucks in the account, Paulie. Try not to spend it all at once."""|"The Revolution Business"|"Charles Stross"

"ap ~ 10:00"|"Around ten o'clock"|"The next morning he rose, late and groggy, and went back to work. Around ten o'clock he finally found what he'd been looking for: a pinhole in the living room wall that had been all but concealed by the frame of a cheap print that had come with the apartment. Mike passed it by, continuing his search. It would be perfectly obvious what he was doing, and there was no point in showing any sign of having discovered the camera. Either it was being monitored, in which case they'd simply replace it with another the next time he went out, or the survey had been terminated, in which case there was nothing to worry about. He leaned towards the latter case (keeping a watch on an apartment was an expensive business, requiring at least six full-time agents on rotation) but he had to assume the former, especially if Dr. James considered him unsound. He could have farmed it out to Internal Affairs, told them I'm suspected of espionage, he thought bleakly. In which case, he was providing them with lots of circumstantial evidence that he was overdue for a vacation in Club Fed; but that couldn't be avoided. Federal prison might actually be an improvement over the alternatives, if WARBUCKS decided Mike needed to be silenced."|"The Revolution Business"|"Charles Stross"
