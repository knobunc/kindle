Joe Dillon who introduced the Wild West to us. He had a little library made up
of old numbers of The Union Jack, Pluck and The Halfpenny Marvel. Every evening
after school we met in his back garden and arranged Indian battles. He and his
fat young brother Leo, the idler, held the loft of the stable while we tried to
carry it by storm; or we fought a pitched battle on the grass. But, however
well we fought, we never won siege or battle and all our bouts ended with Joe
Dillon's war dance of victory. His parents went to eight-o'clock mass every
morning in Gardiner Street and the peaceful odour of Mrs. Dillon was prevalent
in the hall of the house. But he played too fiercely for us who were younger
and more timid. He looked like some kind of an Indian when he capered round the
garden, an old tea-cosy on his head, beating a tin with his fist and yelling:"|Dubliners|"James Joyce"
10:00|"ten in the morning"|"The
summer holidays were near at hand when I made up my mind to break out of the
weariness of school-life for one day at least. With Leo Dillon and a boy named
Mahony I planned a day's miching. Each of us saved up sixpence. We were to meet
at ten in the morning on the Canal Bridge. Mahony's big sister was to write an
excuse for him and Leo Dillon was to tell his brother to say he was sick. We
arranged to go along the Wharf Road until we came to the ships, then to cross
in the ferryboat and walk out to see the Pigeon House. Leo Dillon was afraid we
might meet Father Butler or someone out of the college; but Mahony asked, very
sensibly, what would Father Butler be doing out at the Pigeon House. We were
reassured: and I brought the first stage of the plot to an end by collecting
sixpence from the other two, at the same time showing them my own sixpence.
When we were making the last arrangements on the eve we were all vaguely
excited. We shook hands, laughing, and Mahony said:"|Dubliners|"James Joyce"
"ap 03:00"|"three o'clock"|"We
walked along the North Strand Road till we came to the Vitriol Works and then
turned to the right along the Wharf Road. Mahony began to play the Indian as
soon as we were out of public sight. He chased a crowd of ragged girls,
brandishing his unloaded catapult and, when two ragged boys began, out of
chivalry, to fling stones at us, he proposed that we should charge them. I
objected that the boys were too small and so we walked on, the ragged troop
screaming after us: ""Swaddlers! Swaddlers!"" thinking that we were
Protestants because Mahony, who was dark-complexioned, wore the silver badge of
a cricket club in his cap. When we came to the Smoothing Iron we arranged a
siege; but it was a failure because you must have at least three. We revenged
ourselves on Leo Dillon by saying what a funk he was and guessing how many he
would get at three o'clock from Mr. Ryan."|Dubliners|"James Joyce"
12:00|noon|"We
came then near the river. We spent a long time walking about the noisy streets
flanked by high stone walls, watching the working of cranes and engines and
often being shouted at for our immobility by the drivers of groaning carts. It
was noon when we reached the quays and as all the labourers seemed to be eating
their lunches, we bought two big currant buns and sat down to eat them on some
metal piping beside the river. We pleased ourselves with the spectacle of
Dublin's commerceâ€”the barges signalled from far away by their curls of
woolly smoke, the brown fishing fleet beyond Ringsend, the big white
sailing-vessel which was being discharged on the opposite quay. Mahony said it
would be right skit to run away to sea on one of those big ships and even I,
looking at the high masts, saw, or imagined, the geography which had been
scantily dosed to me at school gradually taking substance under my eyes. School
and home seemed to recede from us and their influences upon us seemed to wane."|Dubliners|"James Joyce"
"ap 04:00"|"four o'clock"|"It was
too late and we were too tired to carry out our project of visiting the Pigeon
House. We had to be home before four o'clock lest our adventure should be
discovered. Mahony looked regretfully at his catapult and I had to suggest
going home by train before he regained any cheerfulness. The sun went in behind
some clouds and left us to our jaded thoughts and the crumbs of our provisions."|Dubliners|"James Joyce"
"ap > 08:00"|"after eight o'clock"|"When I
came downstairs again I found Mrs. Mercer sitting at the fire. She was an old garrulous
woman, a pawnbroker's widow, who collected used stamps for some pious purpose.
I had to endure the gossip of the tea-table. The meal was prolonged beyond an
hour and still my uncle did not come. Mrs. Mercer stood up to go: she was sorry
she couldn't wait any longer, but it was after eight o'clock and she did not
like to be out late as the night air was bad for her. When she had gone I began
to walk up and down the room, clenching my fists. My aunt said:"|Dubliners|"James Joyce"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o'clock"|"At
nine o'clock I heard my uncle's latchkey in the halldoor. I heard him talking
to himself and heard the hallstand rocking when it had received the weight of
his overcoat. I could interpret these signs. When he was midway through his
dinner I asked him to give me the money to go to the bazaar. He had forgotten."|Dubliners|"James Joyce"
"ap 09:50"|"ten minutes to ten"|"I held
a florin tightly in my hand as I strode down Buckingham Street towards the
station. The sight of the streets thronged with buyers and glaring with gas
recalled to me the purpose of my journey. I took my seat in a third-class
carriage of a deserted train. After an intolerable delay the train moved out of
the station slowly. It crept onward among ruinous house and over the twinkling
river. At Westland Row Station a crowd of people pressed to the carriage doors;
but the porters moved them back, saying that it was a special train for the
bazaar. I remained alone in the bare carriage. In a few minutes the train drew
up beside an improvised wooden platform. I passed out on to the road and saw by
the lighted dial of a clock that it was ten minutes to ten. In front of me was
a large building which displayed the magical name."|Dubliners|"James Joyce"

left his friends at a quarter to ten and went up George's Street. He turned to

girls and young men had thinned and on his way up the street he heard many
groups and couples bidding one another good-night. He went as far as the clock
of the College of Surgeons: it was on the stroke of ten. He set off briskly
along the northern side of the Green hurrying for fear Corley should return too
soon. When he reached the corner of Merrion Street he took his stand in the
shadow of a lamp and brought out one of the cigarettes which he had reserved

little gilt clock on the mantelpiece as soon as she had become aware through
her revery that the bells of George's Church had stopped ringing. It was
seventeen minutes past eleven: she would have lots of time to have the matter
out with Mr. Doran and then catch short twelve at Marlborough Street. She was
sure she would win. To begin with she had all the weight of social opinion on
her side: she was an outraged mother. She had allowed him to live beneath her
roof, assuming that he was a man of honour and he had simply abused her
hospitality. He was thirty-four or thirty-five years of age, so that youth
could not be pleaded as his excuse; nor could ignorance be his excuse since he
was a man who had seen something of the world. He had simply taken advantage of
Polly's youth and inexperience: that was evident. The question was: What
reparation would he make?"|Dubliners|"James Joyce"
"ap 08:45"|"quarter to nine"|"Little Chandler sat in the room off the
hall, holding a child in his arms. To save money they kept no servant but
Annie's young sister Monica came for an hour or so in the morning and an hour
or so in the evening to help. But Monica had gone home long ago. It was a
quarter to nine. Little Chandler had come home late for tea and, moreover, he
had forgotten to bring Annie home the parcel of coffee from Bewley's. Of course
she was in a bad humour and gave him short answers. She said she would do
without any tea but when it came near the time at which the shop at the corner
closed she decided to go out herself for a quarter of a pound of tea and two
pounds of sugar. She put the sleeping child deftly in his arms and said:"|Dubliners|"James Joyce"

public, his run upstairs and the porter he had gulped down so hastily confused
the man and, as he sat down at his desk to get what was required, he realised
how hopeless was the task of finishing his copy of the contract before half
past five. The dark damp night was coming and he longed to spend it in the
bars, drinking with his friends amid the glare of gas and the clatter of glasses.
He got out the Delacour correspondence and passed out of the office. He hoped
Mr. Alleyne would not discover that the last two letters were missing."|Dubliners|"James Joyce"
"ap 05:00"|five|"The man returned to the lower office and
sat down again at his desk. He stared intently at the incomplete phrase: In no
case shall the said Bernard Bodley be... and thought how strange it was that
the last three words began with the same letter. The chief clerk began to hurry
Miss Parker, saying she would never have the letters typed in time for post. The
man listened to the clicking of the machine for a few minutes and then set to
work to finish his copy. But his head was not clear and his mind wandered away
to the glare and rattle of the public-house. It was a night for hot punches. He
struggled on with his copy, but when the clock struck five he had still
fourteen pages to write. Blast it! He couldn't finish it in time. He longed to
execrate aloud, to bring his fist down on something violently. He was so
enraged that he wrote Bernard Bernard instead of Bernard Bodley and had to
begin again on a clean sheet."|Dubliners|"James Joyce"

Today at the City of Dublin Hospital the
Deputy Coroner (in the absence of Mr. Leverett) held an inquest on the body of
Mrs. Emily Sinico, aged forty-three years, who was killed at Sydney Parade
Station yesterday evening. The evidence showed that the deceased lady, while

they had walked four years before. She seemed to be near him in the darkness.

stood still to listen. Why had he withheld life from her? Why had he sentenced
her to death? He felt his moral nature falling to pieces."|Dubliners|"James Joyce"

things. A few young men, wearing bright blue badges in their coats, stood idle
in the vestibule; none of them wore evening dress. She passed by with her
daughter and a quick glance through the open door of the hall showed her the
cause of the stewards' idleness. At first she wondered had she mistaken the
hour. No, it was twenty minutes to eight."|Dubliners|"James Joyce"

was introduced to the secretary of the Society, Mr. Fitzpatrick. She smiled and
shook his hand. He was a little man, with a white, vacant face. She noticed
that he wore his soft brown hat carelessly on the side of his head and that his
accent was flat. He held a programme in his hand, and, while he was talking to
her, he chewed one end of it into a moist pulp. He seemed to bear
disappointments lightly. Mr. Holohan came into the dressingroom every few
minutes with reports from the box-office. The artistes talked among themselves
nervously, glanced from time to time at the mirror and rolled and unrolled their
music. When it was nearly half-past eight, the few people in the hall began to
express their desire to be entertained. Mr. Fitzpatrick came in, smiled
vacantly at the room, and said:"|Dubliners|"James Joyce"

were no good but the committee, he said, had decided to let the first three
concerts go as they pleased and reserve all the talent for Saturday night. Mrs.
Kearney said nothing, but, as the mediocre items followed one another on the
platform and the few people in the hall grew fewer and fewer, she began to
regret that she had put herself to any expense for such a concert. There was
something she didn't like in the look of things and Mr. Fitzpatrick's vacant
smile irritated her very much. However, she said nothing and waited to see how
it would end. The concert expired shortly before ten, and everyone went home

sometimes formed one of a little detachment which left the city shortly after
noon on Sunday with the purpose of arriving as soon as possible at some
public-house on the outskirts of the city where its members duly qualified
themselves as bona fide travellers. But his fellow-travellers had never
consented to overlook his origin. He had begun life as an obscure financier by
lending small sums of money to workmen at usurious interest. Later on he had
become the partner of a very fat, short gentleman, Mr. Goldberg, in the Liffey
Loan Bank. Though he had never embraced more than the Jewish ethical code, his
fellow-Catholics, whenever they had smarted in person or by proxy under his
exactions, spoke of him bitterly as an Irish Jew and an illiterate, and saw
divine disapproval of usury made manifest through the person of his idiot son.
At other times they remembered his good points."|Dubliners|"James Joyce"
