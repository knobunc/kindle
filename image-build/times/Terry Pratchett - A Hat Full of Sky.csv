"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"This morning, at two o’clock, I captured a hiver with my device! And now it is locked inside my head. I can sense its memories, the memories of every creature it has inhabited. Yet because of my superior intellect, I control the hiver. It does not control me. I do not feel that it has changed me in any way. My mind is as extraordinarily powerful as it always has been!"|"A Hat Full of Sky"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|Midnight|"“Ah, the Sky Scraper. Very much your look,” said Zakzak, bustling around and opening drawers. “It’s for the witch on the way up, who knows what she wants and doesn’t care how many frogs it takes, aha. Incidentally, many ladies like a cloak with that. Now, we have the Midnight, pure wool, fine knit, very warm, but”—he gave Tiffany a knowing look—“we currently have very limited supplies of the Zephyr Billow, just in, very rare, black as coal and thin as a shadow. Completely useless for keeping you warm or dry, but it looks fabulous in even the slightest breeze. Observe.”"|"A Hat Full of Sky"|"Terry Pratchett"

"> 12:00"|"just past noon"|"The sky was black, even though the sun was high. It hung at just past noon, lighting the landscape as brilliantly as a hot summer day, but the sky was midnight black, shorn of stars."|"A Hat Full of Sky"|"Terry Pratchett"

00:00|midnight|"There was, indeed, no life. Stillness and silence ruled here. In fact Tiffany, who cared a lot about getting words right, would have said it was a hush, which is not the same as silence. A hush is what you get in cathedrals at midnight."|"A Hat Full of Sky"|"Terry Pratchett"
12:00|noon|"“Then you’ll face me,” said Granny. “You’ll face me, on my ground. But that won’t happen, will it? You were fed up with grubby babies and silly women? Then this is…the other stuff. It’s noon now. They should’ve started the Trials proper, but, hah, it looks as though people have forgotten. Now, then…do you have it in you to be a witch by noonlight, far away from your hills?”"|"A Hat Full of Sky"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"She had a new dress. It was green, like the last one. The complex world of favors and obligations and gifts that Miss Level lived and moved in had thrown up four yards of nice material (for the trouble-free birth of Miss Quickly’s baby boy) and a few hours’ dressmaking (Mrs. Hunter’s bad leg feeling a lot better, thank you). She’d given the black one away. When I’m old, I shall wear midnight, she’d decided. But for now she’d had enough of darkness."|"A Hat Full of Sky"|"Terry Pratchett"
