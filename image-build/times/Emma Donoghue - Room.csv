"ap 07:14"|07:14|"I jump onto Rocker to look at Watch, he says 07:14. I can skateboard on Rocker without holding on to her, then I whee back onto Duvet and I’m snowboarding instead. “When are
  presents meant to open?”"|Room|"Emma Donoghue"
"ap > 09:00"|"after nine"|"I flat the chairs and put them beside Door against Clothes Horse. He always grumbles and says there’s no room but there’s plenty if he stands up really straight. I can fold up flat
  too but not quite as flat because of my muscles, from being alive. Door’s made of shiny magic metal, he goes beep beep after nine when I’m meant to be switched off in
  Wardrobe."|Room|"Emma Donoghue"
"ap 08:30"|08:30|"At 08:30 I press the button on TV and try between the three. I find Dora the Explorer, yippee. Ma moves Bunny around real slow to better the picture with his ears and head. One day when I
  was four TV died and I cried, but in the night Old Nick brung a magic converter box to make TV back to life. The other channels after the three are totally fuzzy so we don’t watch them
  because of hurting our eyes, only if there’s music we put Blanket over and just listen through the gray of her and shake our booties."|Room|"Emma Donoghue"
"ap 00:13"|12:13|"It’s 12:13, so it can be lunch. My favorite bit of the prayer is the daily bread. I’m the boss of play but Ma’s the boss of meals, like she doesn’t let us have cereal for
  breakfast and lunch and dinner in case we’d get sick and anyway that would use it up too fast. When I was zero and one, Ma used to chop and chew up my food for me, but then I got all my
  twenty teeth and I can gnash up anything. This lunch is tuna on crackers, my job is to roll back the lid of the can because Ma’s wrist can’t manage it."|Room|"Emma Donoghue"
"ap 08:33"|08:33|"It’s too late for any TV because of the cake, Watch says 08:33. My yellow hoody nearly rips my head off when Ma’s pulling it. I get into my sleep T-shirt and brush my teeth while Ma
  ties up the trash bag and puts it beside Door with our list that I wrote, tonight it says Please, Pasta, Lentils, Tuna, Cheese (if not too $), O.J., Thanks."|Room|"Emma Donoghue"
"ap 08:57"|08:57|"She points up at Watch that says 08:57, that’s only three minutes before nine. So I run into Wardrobe and lie down on my pillow and wrap up in Blanket that’s all gray and fleecy with
  the red piping. I’m just under the drawing of me I forgot was there. Ma puts her head in. “Three kisses?”"|Room|"Emma Donoghue"

02:00|"two at night"|"There’s still light coming in the slats so I can see some of me in the drawing, the bits like Ma and the nose that’s only like me. I stroke the paper, it’s all silky. I go
  straight so my head is pressing on Wardrobe and so are my feet. I listen to Ma getting into her sleep T-shirt and taking the killers, always two at night because she says pain is like water, it
  spreads out as soon as she lies down. She spits toothpaste. “Our friend Zack has an itch on his back,” she says."|Room|"Emma Donoghue"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"In Wardrobe I always try to squeeze my eyes tight and switch off fast so I don’t hear Old Nick come, then I’ll wake up and it’ll be the morning and I’ll be in Bed with Ma
  having some and everything OK. But tonight I’m still on, the cake is fizzing in my tummy. I count my top teeth with my tongue from right to left till ten, then my bottom teeth from left to
  right, then back the other way, I have to get to ten each time and twice ten equals twenty, that’s how many I have."|Room|"Emma Donoghue"
"ap 05:39"|05:39|"It’s 05:39 so we can have dinner, it’s quick noodles. While they’re in the hot water, Ma finds hard words to test me from the milk carton like nutritional that means
  food, and pasteurized that means laser guns zapped away the germs. I want more cake but Ma says beets chopped all juicy first. Then I have cake that’s pretty crispy now and Ma does
  too, a little bit."|Room|"Emma Donoghue"
"ap 05:57"|05:57|"At 05:57 I say, “Ma, it’s nearly six,” so she gets up to make dinner but she doesn’t eat any. Jeep and Remote wait in Bath because it’s dry now, it’s their
  secret cave. “Actually Jeep died and went to Heaven,” I say, eating my chicken slices really fast."|Room|"Emma Donoghue"

"ap 05:01"|05:01|"I beggar her twice and she beggars me once, I hate losing. Then Gin Rummy and Go Fish, I win mostly. Then we just play with the cards, dancing and fighting and stuff. Jack of Diamonds is my
  favorite and his friends the other Jacks.
“Look.” I point to Watch. “05:01, we can have dinner.”
It’s a hot dog each, yum."|Room|"Emma Donoghue"
"ap 08:49"|"eight forty-nine"|"“It’s eight forty-nine, Jack, would you just go to bed?” She ties the trash bag and puts it beside Door."|Room|"Emma Donoghue"
"ap 09:47"|09:47|"When I’m hungry again I check Watch but he only says 09:47. Cartoons are over so I watch football and the planet where people win prizes. The puffy-hair woman is on her red couch talking
  to a man who used to be a golf star. There’s another planet where women hold up necklaces and say how exquisite they are. “Suckers,” Ma always says when she sees that planet. She
  doesn’t say anything today, she doesn’t notice I’m watching and watching and my brain is starting to be stinky."|Room|"Emma Donoghue"
"ap 00:04"|12:04|"When it’s 12:04 it can be lunch so I cut a can of baked beans open, I’m careful. I wonder would Ma wake up if I cutted my hand and screamed help? I never had beans cold before. I eat
  nine, then I’m not hungry. I put the rest in a tub for not waste. Some are stuck to the can at the bottom, I pour water in. Maybe Ma will get up and scrub it later. Maybe she’ll be
  hungry, she’ll say, “Oh Jack, how thoughtful of you to save me beans in a tub.”"|Room|"Emma Donoghue"
"ap 08:27"|08:27|"“Oh, don’t worry,” says Ma, “he’s half merman, remember? He can breathe air or water, whichever.” She goes to look at Watch, it’s 08:27."|Room|"Emma Donoghue"
"ap 07:09"|07:09|"We wake up and the air’s shiverier. Watch says 07:09, he has a battery, that’s his own little power hidden inside."|Room|"Emma Donoghue"

"ap 08:41"|08:41|"It’s 08:41 and I’m in Bed practicing. Ma’s filled a plastic bag with really hot water and tied it tight so none spills out, she puts it in another bag and ties that too.
  “Ouch.” I try to get away."|Room|"Emma Donoghue"
"ap 08:21"|08:21|"It’s 08:21 already, I slept for long and now I’m having some, the left is so creamy. Old Nick didn’t come back I don’t think."|Room|"Emma Donoghue"
"ap 06:13"|06:13|"It’s 06:13, that’s getting nearly to be the evening. Ma says I really should be wrapped up in Rug already, Old Nick might possibly come in early because of me being sick."|Room|"Emma Donoghue"
"ap > 01:00"|"after one o’clock"|"I go look at the tray Noreen brought. I’m not hungry but when I ask Ma she says it’s after one o’clock, that’s too late for lunch even, lunch should be twelve something
  but there’s no room in my tummy yet."|Room|"Emma Donoghue"
"ap 06:12"|06:12|"At 06:12 Noreen brings another whole different tray that’s dinner, we can have dinner at five something or six something or even seven something, Ma says. There’s green crunchy stuff
  called arugula that tastes too sharp, I like the potatoes with crispy edges and meats with stripes all on them. The bread has bits that scratch my throat, I try to pick them out but then
  there’s holes, Ma says to just leave it. There’s strawberries she says taste like Heaven, how does she know what Heaven tastes like? We can’t eat it all. Ma says most people stuff
  themselves too much anyway, we should just eat what we like and leave the rest."|Room|"Emma Donoghue"
"ap 09:57"|"nine fifty-seven"|"Noreen knocks with somethings very exciting, the first are softy stretchy shoes like socks but made of leather, the second is a watch with just numbers so I can read it like Watch. I say,

      The haunting, long-haired Little Prince is the product of his beautiful young mother’s serial abuse at the hands of the Garden-shed Ogre (captured by state troopers in a dramatic standoff
      Sunday at two a.m.). Jack says everything is “nice” and adores Easter eggs but still goes up and down stairs on all fours like a monkey. He was sealed up for all his five years in a

“That’s just how it is.”"|Room|"Emma Donoghue"
"ap 03:30"|03:30|"They’re her book club but I don’t know why because they’re not reading books. She forgot to cancel them so they all came at 03:30 with plates of cakes and stuff. I have three
  cakes on a little plate but I have to stay out of the way. Also Grandma gave me five keys on a key ring that says POZZO’S HOUSE OF PIZZA, I wonder how a house is made of pizza,
  wouldn’t it flop? They’re not actually keys to anywhere but they jingle, I got them for promising not to take the key out of the liquor cabinet anymore. The first cake is called
  coconut, it’s yucky. The second is lemon and the third is I don’t know but I like it the best."|Room|"Emma Donoghue"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"Grandma brought me a watercolor set, it’s ten colors of ovals in a box with an invisible lid. I rinse the little brush clean after each so they don’t mix and when the water goes
