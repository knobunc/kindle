"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"We threaded the cat’s cradle of roads and obscure tracks and reached the Haystacks around noon. We set up camp, then explored, looking for minerals and fossils before cooking dinner and building the campfire. A wild stallion showed up in an aggressive mood. He snorted a few times, then galloped away. Overnight the wind began to rise and by the next morning we could look south toward Colorado and see great plumes of dust bowling along the ground like desert djinns. There was an uneasy, ghost-ridden feel to the place. These dust devils were not uncommon in the desert, but had increased in number as gas energy drill rigs and work trucks broke up the cryptobiotic crust that holds the fine soil in place. We escaped from the wind by going down into a huge wash framed by sandstone towers topped with pink hats and continued to explore. The wash was packed with eroded caves, strange formations, pebbles and domes, gullies and pale walls. I saw a parent hawk carry a rabbit to its nest behind one of the towers."|"Bird Cloud"|"Annie Proulx"

Ye gods, chink on, ever on. If the guys were sick of chinking I was desperate for them to get done even though there was no noise in the work. It seemed eternities had passed since Catfish had poured the slab. The chinking seemed the longest and most tedious part of the entire construction menu, but in late July it was truly finished. Almost."|"Bird Cloud"|"Annie Proulx"
00:30|"half after midnight"|"In late May 1914, the sixty-one-year-old Seton-Karr, still fit from a lifetime of athletic adventures, enjoyed a successful climbing holiday in British Columbia and was on his way back to London. In Québec City he boarded the S.S. Empress of Ireland, a Canadian Pacific Railway luxury ocean liner on which he had his usual first-class accommodations. The ship, with fifteen hundred passengers, and fitted with sufficient lifeboats after the tragedy of the Titanic two years before, sailed in late afternoon, heading east down the St. Lawrence Seaway. An hour and a half after midnight the pilot left the ship at Rimouski and the Empress steamed toward the open Atlantic. Very soon after the pilot left, Captain Henry George Kendall, on his first trip with the Empress, saw a low-lying collier coming up the river. The coal carrier, S.S. Storstad, from Sydney, Nova Scotia, was heavily laden. Exactly what happened next is still not clear, as heavy spring fog blanked out everything and the accounts given at the later investigation varied. The Storstad somehow rammed the Empress amidships. The beautiful liner sank in fourteen minutes. So swiftly did she go down there was not enough time to launch more than a few lifeboats. Among the 1,012 people who lost their lives was Henry Seton-Karr, but a New York Times report on the tragedy depicted him as a hero who gave his life jacket to a man who had none, saying confidently that he would get another. He didn’t."|"Bird Cloud"|"Annie Proulx"
"ap 04:30"|4:30|"Walking induces a trancelike state that allows the mind freedom and ease and encourages exploration of odd possibilities and improbable connections. I walked every day, for the mind as well as the body. On that first solitary day at Bird Cloud, I walked east to the Jack Creek bridge and looked up at a big empty nest high on the cliff across the river. It was clearly an eagle nest. Had the bald eagles used it before moving half a mile west to the cottonwoods? Had it belonged to another pair of eagles? The huge structure was heaped with snow. Somehow it had a fierce look, black and bristling with stick ends. At 4:30 sunlight still plated the cliff with gold light. Ten minutes later it had faded to cardboard grey. I looked again at the distant nest, then noticed that on the debris pile of colluvium below and a little to the west of the nest there were two elk. They were likely refugees from a big herd that had moved through the property several weeks earlier. Twenty or thirty geese flew upriver high enough to be out of gun range. Dusk thickened, and then, in the gloaming, I saw a large bird fly into a cranny directly above the elk. Roosting time for someone, but who?"|"Bird Cloud"|"Annie Proulx"
"ap 07:45"|7:45|"The next day—the last day of a miserable year—the sun cleared the Medicine Bows at 7:45. It was a beautiful, clear winter morning, the sun sparkling on the snow, no wind, two degrees below zero and a setting moon that was almost full. As Richard Lassels, a seventeenth-century guide for the Grand Tour said of fireflies, “Huge pretty, methought.” By noon both bald eagles were in the trees above the river about five hundred feet apart, watching for fish below. After half an hour they flew upriver to try their luck in another stretch of water."|"Bird Cloud"|"Annie Proulx"

"ap 04:42"|4:42|"The days were too short for complete happiness and the dregs of sunlight dripped off the cliff at 4:42. A few moments later I just missed seeing the mysterious big bird, caught only a fractional look as it sailed into the same cranny as yesterday."|"Bird Cloud"|"Annie Proulx"
"ap 04:40"|4:40|"At the end of the daylight the bald eagles sat in trees three hundred yards apart, merging into the dusk but still staring into the river. Their low-light vision must be good. At 4:40 a dozen Canada geese flew upstream. An orange ribbon lay on the western horizon. I waited, binoculars in hand. Two minutes later the last sunlight licked the top of the cliff, then was gone. The sky turned purple to display a moon high and full. I did not see the large mystery bird. Perhaps it was an owl and had no problem flying after dark. But I doubted it. I had a strong suspicion that it was an eagle, the owner of the big sinister nest."|"Bird Cloud"|"Annie Proulx"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"The next morning the wind had calmed to thirty miles an hour with gusts hitting fifty. It was a cold and sunny day and the bald eagle team was out flying at eight. As I made coffee I saw the big mystery bird just flapping out of sight toward the TA Ranch. Why was it so elusive? I wanted badly to get a good look at it, but it seemed to fly past only when my head was turned. The two isolated elk stood on a knoll at the west end of the cliff; antlerless, dark brown necks, yellow rumps and red-brown body color. At first sight I could imagine they were the mountain sheep that used to live on the cliff in Indian times. Their faces seemed rather dished, like sheep faces. Magpies were busy across the river, and one raven sat in a tree slightly to the west of their nest site in the cliff. Could the raven, like the eagle, be interested in fixing up its nest so early in the year?"|"Bird Cloud"|"Annie Proulx"
"ap 05:10"|"ten minutes past five"|"The beautiful days had grown longer. In the morning I watched one of the bald eagles dive toward an open stretch of water off the island and I ran madly upstairs with the binoculars just in time to see it heave a fish onto the ice. It ate part of the fish then flew to the nest. At ten minutes past five the sun still gilded the top fifty feet of the cliff. One bald eagle was in the nest tree, the other flying downriver. The cliff turned the color of a russet apple and I enjoyed the rare deep orange sunset smoldering under the edge of a dark dirty-sock cloud."|"Bird Cloud"|"Annie Proulx"
"ap 05:30"|5:30|"The highways were miraculously clear and dry in early February 2007 and I went to Santa Fe for a week to let the James Gang finish up some work in the house. Global warming got to Bird Cloud before I came back and for the first time in months the ground was visible. The road in and our lane were quagmires of heavy mud. The county actually ran a snowplow up to our gate for the first and last time. The cliff was still sunlit at 5:30 and the two elk were still hanging around the cliff. The rosy-finches smothered the feeder as soon as I refilled it with fresh groceries. Several magpies watched from the island. On my first morning back only one eagle sat in the fishing tree. The other was on the nest and I supposed he/she was sitting on eggs. A real sign of spring. I stayed far away from the goldens’ nest as they were skittish and shy and I did not want them to abandon it. I thought bald eagles must lay and hatch their eggs earlier than the goldens. I knew I should look this up, but did not."|"Bird Cloud"|"Annie Proulx"
12:00|noon|"The next morning one of the bald eagles and the prairie falcon had a sky-filling quarrel, the falcon darting, the eagle wheeling and swooping. The falcon suddenly disappeared. At noon the wind began to rise and in an hour it was lashing the cottonwoods. One of the bald eagles sat on a branch above the river watching for fish. The branch moved to and fro vigorously. With each lurch the eagle braced its tail against the branch like a woodpecker, and for some reason I found this endearing. Sometimes I thought of these birds as Evan Connell’s Mr. and Mrs. Bridge. The falcon flew around near the goldens’ part of the cliff. The big birds were not in sight. Something about the falcon’s busybody day bothered me. Was it looking for a nest site? In previous years they had nested at the far east end of the cliff near another pair of prairie falcons. Every bird a falcon came near seemed agitated."|"Bird Cloud"|"Annie Proulx"
"ap 05:33"|5:33|"Sunny, warm, a little wind and the smell of spring. One of the balds waded in the river and caught something small. The goldens were on their high promontory. One hopped down eight or ten feet and seemed to be taking a dust bath, then it zoomed to the nest and sat on it for a few minutes. I noticed there were some new sticks protruding. In a few more minutes she (I am guessing) was back on the promontory. As the day ended the swollen buds of the cottonwoods seemed to have been sprayed with bronze. One of the balds drifted near the golden nest and was chased home for its trespass. A pair of Canada geese, the first this year, flew upstream. The sunlight went off the cliff at 5:33 and in its last flash I saw the elk in silhouette at the west end. The huge yellow colossus of crumbling stone held the light as the sky darkened. How many thousands of years had this scene repeated? The goldens made a last flight and the falcon appeared out of nowhere and flew at one threateningly, then slipped out of sight. The goldens headed for their chimney roost. Good night."|"Bird Cloud"|"Annie Proulx"
12:00|noon|"The next day was very cold, only 10°F at noon. It snowed all morning and Gerald came again, keeping the lane open by bashing through. The eagles sat calm and in their tree watching for fish below in a narrow strip of open water. The day ended with a sense of urgency. How long could Gerald keep the lane open? How long could I stay?"|"Bird Cloud"|"Annie Proulx"
