"ap 05:00"|five|"The club was half-empty at five, which was a little early for dinner. I really wanted to be alone to mope, but that was a sure way to attract even more attention than usual. I looked around for someone I knew. Just anybody harmless and familiar."|"The Healer's War"|"Elizabeth Ann Scarborough"
"< 12:00"|"just before High Noon"|"Even as messy as I looked then, I no sooner stepped inside than the clatter of stainless and restaurant pottery died to an occasional clink and the muted conversations stopped altogether. I felt like the Fastest Gun in the West entering a saloon just before High Noon, but I pretended not to notice. Since coming to Nam, I had gotten used to stopping traffic. Literally. I had always considered myself attractive in a sort of wholesome, moon-faced way. I had nice hazel eyes and brown hair carefully kept reddish, and a figure that ten pounds less made “stacked” and ten pounds more made “fat.” But none of it mattered, because the attention was nothing personal. It was not my sheer breathtaking gorgeousness or incredible charisma that was causing apnea among the male diners. The standard female reproductory equipment and round eyes were all that was required to be the Liz Taylor of China Beach."|"The Healer's War"|"Elizabeth Ann Scarborough"
"ap ~ 05:30"|"about five-thirty"|"Sarah’s morning report was rushed and perfunctory. “All five of the casualties from yesterday are going out today. I haven’t had time to get their tags done yet. I was supervisor last night and there was a push of Vietnamese from some village that got shelled. I think we may get two or three of them. Joe was triage officer last night and didn’t get scrubbed for our first case till about five-thirty, so you probably have an hour or two before recovery room calls. Right now you’ve got three I.V.s on the GI side, one on the Vietnamese. I’ll do those tags now.”"|"The Healer's War"|"Elizabeth Ann Scarborough"
19:00|"1900 hours"|"“We’ll send birds to pick the ladies up at 1900 hours. Skip evening mess and we’ll barbecue you some numbah one steaks.”"|"The Healer's War"|"Elizabeth Ann Scarborough"
12:00|noontime|"Things were definitely looking up. Nobody looked over my shoulder or breathed down my neck and somehow I managed very well without the supervision. Even the noontime sessions with Blaylock weren’t all that painful, though she looked mildly insulted when I did know the answers to the math questions she drilled me on. Voorhees just happened to mistakenly order an extra lunch tray every day I missed my turn at the mess hall."|"The Healer's War"|"Elizabeth Ann Scarborough"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"I didn’t really know what to expect of that weekend. At Fitzsimons, I had gotten into deep trouble with an unreasonable colonel for having a man in my apartment after midnight. We weren’t doing anything, but my roommate, a professional virgin who was irked to come home and find Willie there, and the colonel refused to believe me. I was called a slut in front of several other senior officers, and the colonel promised me she would personally drum me out of the corps if I ever again disgraced the sacred name of the Army nurses with such depraved behavior. Shortly after that, I got orders for Nam. I hoped her spies were watching, writing back, “Oh sure, she says she’s just going to learn about flying cranes, making ‘friends’ with the men, while staying chastely in the guest quarters.” I’ll admit it seemed a little unlikely, but that’s exactly what happened. Well, mostly, anyway."|"The Healer's War"|"Elizabeth Ann Scarborough"
01:00|"0100 hours"|"Friday night, after Jake had met us and escorted me to my room so I could change into a dress for the sake of troop—and my—morale, we barbecued steaks on a quadrangle the men had constructed. The C.O. liked funky country and western songs, such as “Cigareetes, Whusky and Wild, Wild Women,” and I knew quite a few myself, so we took turns playing C-F-G on his beat-up guitar while the troops sang along with varying degrees of tunefulness and ethanol-enhanced enthusiasm. It reminded me of the Texas bars I had loved while I was in basic at Fort Sam, and we sang and played until 0100 hours, when Jake told me I was going to have to get up early if I wanted to fly a mission in a crane."|"The Healer's War"|"Elizabeth Ann Scarborough"
"ap ~ 03:00"|"about 0300"|"Finally, about 0300, choppers began thudding onto the pad, and their steady drone lulled me to sleep."|"The Healer's War"|"Elizabeth Ann Scarborough"
"~ 02:00"|"around 0200 hours"|"Rounds on the GI side were no quieter. A second push had come in around 0200 hours, so most of the men had been quiet earlier that morning, still sleeping or sedated. I knew them only by which antibiotics they were getting, and the name on their plastic wrist tags and at the foot of their beds, all of which I double-checked before handing them the pill cup under the little card carrying the same name."|"The Healer's War"|"Elizabeth Ann Scarborough"
"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"Sergeant Baker kept Meyers and Voorhees scurrying all morning cleaning up the ward. Blaylock informed Marge that VIPs would be touring the hospital later on. And sure enough, sometime around noon a handful of colonels and a general or two arrived with little jewelry boxes full of medals, Bronze Stars and Purple Hearts, and so on."|"The Healer's War"|"Elizabeth Ann Scarborough"
"ap ~ 07:00"|"about seven"|"“She say no can do, co. Papasan work in field and she have these babysans.” He indicated the two shorts-clad toddlers clinging to her pajama bottoms and the little girl, about seven, carrying a nude baby of about two on her hip."|"The Healer's War"|"Elizabeth Ann Scarborough"
"ap 01:03"|103|"My next patient was a sickly little girl whose round brown face, black bangs, and huge dark eyes made her look more like a doll than a real child. She was hot, her mother said, and cried all the time. I took her temperature, which was 103, and listened to her chest. For an FUO, fever of unknown origin, you also always checked lymph nodes routinely, so I raised the little girl’s arms. Lumps the size and color of plums swelled in the child’s armpits."|"The Healer's War"|"Elizabeth Ann Scarborough"
19:00|"1900 hours"|"The shift started at 1900 hours. The night started out to be even more hectic than the one on ICU. I was glad, in a way, because I was so sleepy that I wouldn’t have kept awake otherwise. Sarah was on days alone and had received four fresh GI casualties at six, and had no time to settle them in before the shift change. I had their orders to carry out, two I.V.s to start, and a slew of paperwork. Besides that, Dang Thi Thai had had her skin graft surgery earlier in the day. The graft had to be “rolled,” or smoothed down with a sterile Q-tip, every fifteen minutes to help it adhere. So I was constantly running back and forth between the wards and my sore foot got sorer every time."|"The Healer's War"|"Elizabeth Ann Scarborough"

"ap 01:00"|one|"Still, when I got up from charting my meds at one, I couldn’t bear weight on my left foot and I hopped from bed to bed, and stood with my knee on a chair while I did Thai’s treatment."|"The Healer's War"|"Elizabeth Ann Scarborough"
"ap 05:00"|five|"I felt funny hopping along, because with each little hop my head seemed to float right up to the ceiling and take a long time coming down. I felt as if I were looking out from a long way inside my brain, as if most of me were somewhere deep inside my body, smaller, shrunken inside myself, with the rest of me, this big ungainly shell, hopping around and sweating. Sometimes I didn’t quite keep track of where I was and I’d think I was at bed three and I was already at five. I was well lubricated by continual runnels of sweat, but they almost felt cool by now. And I was oddly, dopily happy and unconcerned. Ryan appeared at one end of the ward with a mop and I stood staring at him for a moment and, hey presto, he disappeared without moving, just as I caught myself on someone’s bed rail, falling backward."|"The Healer's War"|"Elizabeth Ann Scarborough"
00:00|midnight|"I’d walk home from the ward for midnight supper break and sit on the porch outside my hooch. At night everything was so much nicer. You couldn’t see the barbed wire and the concrete and the raw plywood and sandbags and olive drab so clearly. The sky was black and velvety and star-studded, as glamorous as if there were no war on at all. Palms swayed on the horizon, and the South China Sea lapped gently at the beach. You could even forget the smell if there was a little breeze. I couldn’t help thinking that if I were Vietnamese, I could hate the Americans on aesthetic grounds alone. Poor as the native houses and cities were, they blended with the countryside. Our compound reminded me of a strip mine I’d seen high in the Rockies. Everything else around it was breathtakingly beautiful and then there was this gutted mountain and a lake that looked like liquid cement."|"The Healer's War"|"Elizabeth Ann Scarborough"
00:00|midnight|"The last night I was on the ward was quiet and Xinhdy la daied me down to her bedside. She took my hand and looked at my ragged nails. “Numbah ten,” she said and got out her file and polish and started giving me dragon-lady points. I let her. My work was caught up until midnight and I’d missed her cheerful, normal company. She more than anyone else let me imagine that at one time there must have been a happier kind of life in Vietnam, where people could be frivolous and worry about what was pretty."|"The Healer's War"|"Elizabeth Ann Scarborough"
"~ 15:00"|"around three that afternoon"|"The monsoon drizzle started at around three that afternoon, in keeping with my mood. I didn’t bother with a poncho but let the rain soak my red alligator-bedecked polo shirt. My flip-flops smacked against the wet cement walkway leading to the hospital and mail call. I didn’t get mail, of course, but Marge Canon clutched another letter to her bosom, this one unstamped, which meant it came from in country."|"The Healer's War"|"Elizabeth Ann Scarborough"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"“Not till it was too late,” she said. “He was over at that generals’ mess at I Corps and didn’t get back till later. Captain Schlakowski came over at eight and checked her but thought she was okay. Then we got three new patients on the GI side, and when I came back to do midnight meds Xinh was having trouble breathing. I was taking her pulse when she arrested. I started CPR while Ryan called a code and tossed me the ambu bag. The team got here right away but it was just too late.”"|"The Healer's War"|"Elizabeth Ann Scarborough"

12:00|noon|"I tried to think what to do, where to go. In the States I would wait calmly by the wreck to be rescued. Here I might not want to meet the fire department, if it did come. Quang Ngai had to be around here somewhere—maybe a few miles, maybe more—but I didn’t even know my directions here. And I couldn’t remember what the hell it was the sun did, except that at noon it was in the middle of the sky and at night it disappeared, if it bothered to appear during the day at all, during monsoon season. VC would be all over the jungle, probably, but they’d see us even quicker in the high grass, if they hadn’t already. I was glad Ahn had kept me from screaming. No need to announce that all of the occupants of our chopper hadn’t perished."|"The Healer's War"|"Elizabeth Ann Scarborough"
12:00|"High Noon"|"Just before dark we headed down the ridge, toward another village. Everyone grew marginally more tense, the colonel’s aura sparking with anxiety. A few yards from the perimeter, we saw a man with a rifle. He yelled, “Dung lai,” but as we got closer, he saw that this was no time to play High Noon and scuttled off into the village, his aura leaving a light trail of gray-violet fear."|"The Healer's War"|"Elizabeth Ann Scarborough"
