It struck one of the arms of the figure neatly at the elbow-joint, smashing a jagged hole in the silver. He wrenched at the arm and brought it away. It was hollow, and, as I am alive, I tell you there was a long, dry arm-bone inside it!’"|"Lord Peter Views the Body"|"Dorothy L. Sayers"

The man had stuck a hot-water bottle into the bed, because it hadn’t been used just lately, and the beastly thing had gone and unstoppered itself. I lay awake for ten minutes in the deeps of damp misery before I had sufficient strength of mind to investigate. Then I found it was hopeless – sheets, blankets, mattress, all soaked. I looked at the arm-chair, and then I had a brilliant idea. I remembered there was a lovely great divan in the studio, with a big skin rug and a pile of cushions. Why not finish the night there? I took the little electric torch which always goes about with me, and started off."|"Lord Peter Views the Body"|"Dorothy L. Sayers"

At ten o’clock tonight exactly, you walk across Lambeth Bridge.’ (Rogers winced at this intimation that his abode was known), ‘and you’ll see a yellow taxi standing there, with the driver doing something to his engine. You’ll say to him, “Is your bus fit to go?” and he’ll say, “Depends where you want to go to.” And you’ll say, “Take me to Number One, London.” There’s a shop called that, by the way, but he won’t take you there. You won’t know where he is taking you, because the taxi-windows will be covered up, but you mustn’t mind that. It’s the rule for the first visit. Afterwards, when you’re regularly one of us, you’ll be told the name of the place. And when you get there, do as you’re told and speak the truth, because, if you don’t, Number One will deal with you.

Which of you is the Lord Peter Wimsey to whom I should entrust the formula I do not know. Both of you are supplied with papers of identity; both appear completely instructed in this matter; both of your handwritings correspond with the letters I have previously received from Lord Peter, and both of you have offered me the sum agreed upon in Bank of England notes. In addition, this third gentleman arrives endowed with an equal facility in handwritings, an introductory letter surrounded by most suspicious circumstances, and a degree of acquaintance with this whole matter which alarms me. I can see but one solution. All of you must remain here at the château while I send to England for some elucidation of this mystery. To the genuine Lord Peter I offer my apologies, and assure him that I will endeavour to make his stay as agreeable as possible. Will this satisfy you? It will? I am delighted to hear it.

12:00|noon|"On the morning of the wedding-day, Lord Peter emerged from Bunter’s hands a marvel of sleek brilliance. His primrose-coloured hair was so exquisite a work of art that to eclipse it with his glossy hat was like shutting up the sun in a shrine of polished jet; his spats, light trousers, and exquisitely polished shoes formed a tone-symphony in monochrome. It was only by the most impassioned pleading that he persuaded his tyrant to allow him to place two small photographs and a thin, foreign letter in his breast-pocket. Mr Bunter, likewise immaculately attired, stepped into the taxi after him. At noon precisely they were deposited beneath the striped awning which adorned the door of the Duchess of Medway’s house in Park Lane. Bunter promptly disappeared in the direction of the back entrance, while his lordship mounted the steps and asked to see the dowager."|"Lord Peter Views the Body"|"Dorothy L. Sayers"

He had got out of bed and crept very softly into Lord Peter’s room and woken him up. He had said: ‘Uncle Peter, I’m sure there’s burglars on the fire-escape.’ And Uncle Peter, instead of saying, ‘Nonsense, Gherkins, hurry up and get back to bed,’ had sat up and listened and said: ‘By Jove, Gherkins, I believe you’re right.’ And had sent Gherkins to call Bunter. And on his return, Gherkins, who had always regarded his uncle as a very top-hatted sort of person, actually saw him take from his handkerchief-drawer an undeniable automatic pistol."|"Lord Peter Views the Body"|"Dorothy L.

"ap 02:00"|"2 o’clock"|"‘Yes, indeed. They had a most extraordinary story to tell. They’d taken over at 2 o’clock from the other pair of watchers, and had knelt down by the coffin in the Lady-chapel, according to plan, to say the proper sort of prayers, whatever they are. They’d been there, to the best of their calculation, about ten minutes, when they heard a noise up by the High Altar, as though somebody was creeping stealthily about. Miss Hancock is a very plucky girl, and she got up and walked up the aisle in the dark, with Mrs Hancock following on behind because, as she said, she didn’t want to be left alone. When they’d got as far as the rood-screen, Miss Hancock called out aloud, ‘Who’s there?’ At which they heard a sort of rustling sound, and a noise like something being knocked over. Miss Hancock most courageously snatched up one of the churchwarden’s staffs, which was clipped on to the choir-stalls, and ran forward, thinking, she says, that somebody was trying to steal the ornaments off the altar. There’s a very fine fifteenth-century cross—’"|"Lord Peter Views the Body"|"Dorothy L. Sayers"

But the vestry windows are very narrow and barred, and they couldn’t do anything except wait. They tried to listen, but they couldn’t hear much. Their only hope was that the four-o’clock watchers might come early and catch the thieves at work. But they waited and waited, and they heard four strike, and five, and nobody came.’"|"Lord Peter Views the Body"|"Dorothy L. Sayers"
"ap < 04:00"|"just before four"|"‘So his next idea was to hunt for Rawlinson and Hubbard. However, he didn’t have to look far. He’d got round the church as far as the furnace-house on the north side, when he heard a terrific hullabaloo going on, and people shouting and thumping on the door. So he called Grinch, and they looked through the little window, and there, if you please, were Hubbard and young Rawlinson, bawling and going on and using the most shocking language. It seems they were set upon in exactly the same way, only before they got inside the church. Rawlinson had been passing the evening with Hubbard, I understand, and they had a bit of a sleep downstairs in the back bar, to avoid disturbing the house early – or so they say, though I dare say if the truth was known they were having drinks; and if that’s Hancock’s idea of a suitable preparation for going to church and saying prayers, all I can say is, it isn’t mine. Anyway, they started off just before four, Hubbard going down on the carrier of Rawlinson’s bicycle. They had to get off at the south gate, which was pushed to, and while Rawlinson was wheeling the machine up the path two or three men – they couldn’t see exactly – jumped out from the trees. There was a bit of a scuffle, but what with the bicycle, and it’s being so unexpected, they couldn’t put up a very good fight, and the men dropped blankets over their heads, or something. I don’t know all the details. At any rate, they were bundled into the furnace-house and left there. They may be there still, for all I know, if they haven’t found the key. There should be a spare key, but I don’t know what’s become of it. They sent up for it this morning, but I haven’t seen it about for a long time.’"|"Lord Peter Views the Body"|"Dorothy L. Sayers"
02:30|"half-past two in the morning"|"‘Supposing I wanted, for some reason, to scare the neighbourhood with the apparition of a coach and headless horses, I should choose a dark, rainy night. Good! It was that kind of night. Now, if I took black horses and painted their bodies white – poor devils! what a state they’d be in. No. How do they do these Maskelyne-and-Devant stunts where they cut off people’s heads? White horses, of course – and black felt clothing over their heads. Right! And luminous paint on the harness, with a touch here and there on their bodies, to make good contrast and ensure that the whole show wasn’t invisible. No difficulty about that. But they must go silently. Well, why not? Four stout black cloth bags filled with bran, drawn well up and tied round the fetlocks would make any horse go quietly enough, especially if there was a bit of a wind going. Rags round the bridle-rings to prevent clinking, and round the ends of the traces to keep ’em from squeaking. Give ’em a coachman in a white coat and black mask, hitch ’em to a rubber-tyred fly, picked out with phosphorus and well-oiled at the joints – and I swear I’d make something quite ghostly enough to startle a rather well-irrigated gentleman on a lonely road at half-past two in the morning.’"|"Lord Peter Views the Body"|"Dorothy L.

Then Mortimer and the other two took the embalmed body out of the coffin and filled its place up with bags of sawdust. I know it was sawdust, because I found the remains of it on the Lady-chapel floor in the morning. They put the body in the fly, and Mortimer drove off with it. They passed me on the Herriotting road at half-past two, so they can’t have wasted much time over the job. Mortimer may have been alone, or possibly he had someone with him to see to the body while he himself did the headless coachman business in a black mask. I’m not certain about that. They drove through the last gate before you come to the fork at Frimpton, and went across the fields to Mortimer’s barn. They left the fly there – I know that, because I saw it, and I saw the bran they used to muffle the horses’ hoofs, too. I expect they took it on from there in a car, and fetched the horses up next day – but that’s a detail. I don’t know, either, where they took the body to, but I expect, if you went and asked Mortimer about it, he would be able to assure you that it was still above ground.’"|"Lord Peter Views the Body"|"Dorothy L.
