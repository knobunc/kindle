12:00|midday|"The railway workers were traveling from Seattle to Tenino on foot and had stopped, midday, to rest. They hadn’t really made a camp, just a circle of baskets and blankets around a circle of damp dirt that Chin Ah Kin had cleared with his hands prior to building a fire. Chin was briefly alone, although in the distance to his left he could hear the companionable sounds of two men urinating."|"Sarah Canary"|"Karen Joy Fowler"
"< 12:00"|"just before noon"|"It was midwinter, the tail end of the Year of the Monkey and just before noon. There was no snow, but the ground was wet with the morning’s frost and the trees dripped. Underfoot, the fir needles were soggy and refused to snap when stepped upon, which might explain why Chin Ah Kin did not hear the woman approach. It was a mystery. She was just there suddenly, talking to someone, maybe to him, maybe to herself. Her speech had no meaning he could discern. Chin, whose mother had worked as a servant for German missionaries and later for a British family in the ceded area of Canton and briefly for a family of Mohammedans, had been surrounded by foreign languages all his life. People speaking a foreign tongue often appear more logical and intelligent than those who can be actually understood. It is inconceivable that extraordinary sounds should signify something trivial or mundane. But this woman’s speech felt lunatic, and it was cold enough to give Chin the momentary illusion that her words had form instead of meaning, were corporeal. He could see them, hovering about her open mouth."|"Sarah Canary"|"Karen Joy Fowler"
"ap 00:00"|twelve|"‘I see where your thinking is leading you,’ Purdy said. ‘But you mustn’t blame Blair. He’s half white, you know. And he’s got his little girl, Jenny, to think of. He would never risk going to jail and leaving her unprotected. It would be different if she was married, of course. She should be married. Most Indian girls are married at twelve, and Jenny’s fifteen. Treating her like a white woman won’t make her one, will it, B.J.? More likely to make her dissatisfied and sulky. I’ve said as much to Blair myself. She’s got considerably less white blood than he does.’"|"Sarah Canary"|"Karen Joy Fowler"
"ap 07:00"|"Seven o’clock"|"Someone knocked on the door. ‘Mrs Byrd?’ Captain Wescott stood outside. Adelaide looked at her watch. Seven o’clock. Time for dinner and then the dock at Tacoma. Soon she and Lydia would be sailing to San Francisco, or they would not be. ‘Mrs Byrd,’ said Captain Wescott, ‘I’m afraid I must trouble you again.’"|"Sarah Canary"|"Karen Joy Fowler"
00:00|midnight|"Adelaide locked the door behind her and went back to the boiler room. Past the sheep with their black, heart-shaped faces, past the wardrobes, past the grandfather clock whose pendulum was wrapped in an Irish blue quilt and whose hands were frozen, one on top of the other, at midnight."|"Sarah Canary"|"Karen Joy Fowler"
12:00|noon|"Chin was a man waking up from a great deal of drink. The next day was wrapped in fog. There was an odd, unfamiliar pulse drumming behind his eyelids. His mouth had been wiped dry. It was noon before he was able to see a copy of the El Camino Real. ‘San Francisco’s Own Tiger Lady,’ the headline read. Chin needn’t have worried. He was not mentioned at all."|"Sarah Canary"|"Karen Joy Fowler"
