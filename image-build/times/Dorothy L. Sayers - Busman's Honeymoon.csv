Fortunately, the law now provided for such a course, and if only Mr. Perkins would not be sticky, everything might pass off very well. The wretched Joe Sellon would have, of course, to speak of seeing Mr. Noakes alive at nine o’clock; but with luck he would not have to go into details about the conversation. Mrs. Ruddle was the stumbling-block: she liked to use her tongue—and then, there was that unfortunate business of Aggie Twitterton’s hens, which had left her with a grudge against the police. Also, of course, there was the awkward fact that one or two people in the village had wagged their heads when Mr. Noakes lost his pocketbook, and had hinted that Martha Ruddle might know something about it; she would not readily forgive Joe Sellon for that misunderstanding. Could one, without actually uttering threats or using improper methods, suggest that over-informativeness in the witness-box might involve an inquiry into the matter of paraffin?

He asked where Sellon was and learned that, having waited a little in the hope of seeing the Superintendent, he had gone off back to Paggleham about an hour ago. They must have missed him on the road, then, somehow. Why hadn’t he come to Talboys?—oh, drat Joe Sellon!"|"Busman's Honeymoon"|"Dorothy L. Sayers"

"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"Yes, by God, thought Kirk, that was queer; queerer than he cared to think about. He must take that away and chew it over. He couldn’t think properly, with Mrs. Sellon’s lamenting voice in his ear. … And the time didn’t fit, because Crutchley had been over an hour in the house before the body was discovered. If Joe Sellon had been hanging around there at, say, eleven o’clock instead of past twelve. … Coincidence. He breathed again."|"Busman's Honeymoon"|"Dorothy L. Sayers"
"ap ~ 06:30"|"about half-past six"|"SUPERINTENDENT KIRK WAS SPARED the greater part of his ordeal; Sellon was in no fit state for undergoing a long interrogation. Sergeant Hart had picked up his trail in Pillington, where he had ridden through on his bicycle about half-past six. Then a girl was found who had seen a policeman following the field path on foot in the direction of Blackraven Wood—a favorite resort of ramblers and children during the summer months. She had particularly noticed him, because it was an unusual place in which to see a uniformed policeman. Following, as he said, this indication, Hart had found Sellon’s bicycle propped against a hedge near the entrance to the path. He had hastened in pursuit—rather uneasy when he remembered that the little wood ran down to the bank of the Pagg. It was darkish by that time, and quite dark among the trees. With the aid of his torch, he had searched about for some time, calling as loudly as he could. After about three-quarters of an hour (he admitted that it had seemed a lot longer) he came upon Sellon, sitting on a fallen tree. He wasn’t doing anything—just sitting. Seemed dazed-like. Hart asked him what on earth he thought he was about, but could get no sense out of him. He told him, pretty sharply, that he must come along at once—the Super was asking for him. Sellon offered no objection, but came without protest. Asked again what brought him there, he said he was “trying to think things out.” Hart—who knew no details of the Paggleham affair—could make neither head nor tail of him; he didn’t think he was fit to be trusted to ride back alone, and therefore took him up on the carrier and brought him straight home. Kirk said he couldn’t have done better."|"Busman's Honeymoon"|"Dorothy L. Sayers"
"ap 10:00"|"10 o’clock"|"This didn’t seem quite the moment for going into his lordship’s reasons for disbelief. Kirk told Sellon he was a young fool to go rambling away like that, and that everybody was ready to believe him so long as he was telling the truth. And he’d better go to bed and try and wake up more sensible; he’d frightened his wife quite enough as it was, and here it was close on 10 o’clock (Crumbs! and the Chief Constable’s report not written yet!); he would be over in the morning and would see him before the inquest."|"Busman's Honeymoon"|"Dorothy L. Sayers"
"ap 06:00"|"Six o’clock"|"The snag was that, to make the theory work, one had to assume that the cactus had been removed from its place. Kirk had already dismissed this idea as silly; but he hadn’t seen then what a lot it would explain. He had gone so far as to have a word with Crutchley, among the chrysanthemums, just as he left Talboys. He had managed the inquiry pretty well, he thought. He had been careful not to ask straight out: “Did you put the cactus back before you left?” That would have drawn attention to a point which was at present a secret between himself and his lordship. He didn’t want any talk about that to get around to Sellon before he himself confronted him with it in his own way. So he had merely pretended to have misremembered what Crutchley had said about his final interview with Noakes. It took place in the kitchen? Yes. Had either of them gone back into the sitting-room after that? No. But he thought Crutchley said he was watering them plants at the time. No, he’d finished watering the plants and was putting back the steps? Oh! then Kirk had got that wrong. Sorry. He just really wanted to get at how long the altercation with Noakes had lasted. Had Noakes been there while Crutchley was seeing to the plants? No, he was in the kitchen. But didn’t Crutchley take the plants out to the kitchen to water them? No, he watered them just where they were, and wound the clock and came out with the steps, and it wasn’t till he’d done that that Noakes gave him his day’s money and the argument started. It hadn’t lasted more’n maybe ten minutes or so—not the argument. Well, possibly fifteen. Six o’clock was rightly Crutchley’s time to stop work—he charged five bob for an eight-hour day, barrin’ time off for lunch. Kirk apologized for his mistake: the step-ladder had confused him; he had thought Crutchley meant he needed the step-ladder to get the hanging plants out of their pots. No; the step-ladder was to get up to water them, same as he’d done this morning—they was above his head—and to wind the clock, like he said. That was all. It was quite ordinary, him using the step-ladder, he always did, and put it back in the kitchen afterwards. “You ain’t tryin’ to make out,” added Crutchley, a little belligerently, “as I stood on them steps with a ’ammer to cosh the old bird over the ’ead?” That was an ingenious idea nobody had yet thought of. Kirk replied that he wasn’t thinking anything particular; only trying to get the times clear in his head. He was glad to have given the impression that his suspicions were directed to the step-ladder."|"Busman's Honeymoon"|"Dorothy L. Sayers"
"ap 06:20"|6:20|"Unfortunately, then, he couldn’t begin by substantiating that the cactus had been out of its pot at 6:20. But now—suppose Noakes had taken it out himself for some purpose or the other. What purpose? Well, it was difficult to say. But suppose Noakes had seen something wrong with it—a spot of mildew, maybe, or whatever these ugly things suffered from. He might have taken it down to wipe it or—But he could have done that easy enough, standing on the steps or, as he was so tall, on a chair. Not good enough. What other things could happen to plants? Well, they might become pot-bound. Kirk didn’t know whether that happened to cactuses (or was it cacti?), but suppose you wanted to look and see if its roots were growing out through the bottom of the pot. You’d have to take it out for that. Or to tap the pot to see if—no; it had been given water. But wait! Noakes hadn’t seen Crutchley do that. He might have suspected Crutchley was neglecting it. Perhaps he felt at the top and it didn’t seem wet enough, and then—Or, more likely, he thought it was being over-watered. These spiky cactus-affairs didn’t like too much damp. Or did they? It was annoying not to know their habits; Kirk’s own gardening was of the straightforward flowerbed-and-kitchen-stuff variety."|"Busman's Honeymoon"|"Dorothy L. Sayers"
"ap 09:00"|"9 o’clock"|"Anyhow, it wasn’t outside the bounds of possibility that Noakes had removed the cactus for some purpose of his own. You couldn’t prove he hadn’t. Say he did. All right. Then, at 9 o’clock, up comes Sellon, and sees Noakes coming into the parlor. … Here Kirk paused to consider again. If Noakes was coming for the 9:30 News as usual, he was before his time. He came in (said Sellon) and looked at the clock. The dead man had worn no watch, and Kirk had taken it for granted that he had come in merely to see how near it was to news-bulletin time. But he might also have been meaning to put the cactus back and come in a bit early on that account. That was all right. He comes in. He thinks, Now, have I got time to fetch that there plant in from the scullery, or wherever it is, before the News comes on? He looks at the clock. Then Joe Sellon taps at the window and he comes over. They have their talk and Joe goes away. The old boy fetches in his plant and gets up on a chair or something to put it back. Or maybe he gets the steps. Then, while he’s doing that, he sees it’s getting on for half-past nine, and that flumes him a bit. He leans over too far, or the steps slip, or he ain’t careful getting down, and over he goes backwards and gives his head a crack on the floor—or, better still, on the corner of the settle.

He deposited the vicar at the parsonage at 10:30 and was back in Pagford before eleven. There’d be no time for long parleyings at windows and clever business with keys. I’m assuming, of course, that Crutchley’s times at the garage have been confirmed; if he’s guilty, of course, they will be, because they’re part of the plan. If it was Crutchley, it must have been premeditated—which means that he might somehow have stolen a key or had one cut. Very early in the morning is Crutchley’s time, I fancy—taking out a taxi for a non-existent customer or something of that kind. He leaves the car somewhere, walks up to the house and lets himself in—um! yes, it’s awkward after that. Noakes would be upstairs, undressed and in bed. I can’t see the point of it.

But the vicar, underneath his professional austerity, conceals one of those dreadful repressions so common among clergymen as depicted by our realistic novelists. So, of course, does Noakes.

H. looked genuinely lovely, like a ship coming into harbor with everything shining and flags flying at wherever modern ships do fly flags—Peter terribly white, poor darling, like the day he had his first watch, and could hardly bear himself for fear it would come to pieces in his hands or turn out not to be real, or something—but he pulled himself together to be specially nice to all the guests (believe if he were in Inquisition he would exert social talents to entertain executioners). … Got back to Town at 5:30 (Peter’s face a study when he realized he had to go 60 miles over crowded roads in a closed car with somebody else driving!—but one really couldn’t let him drive H. back in the open Daimler, all in wedding-garments and a top-hat!) … Got them smuggled out of the house at a quarter to 7—Bunter was waiting for them with the car on the far side of the Park. …"|"Busman's Honeymoon"|"Dorothy L.

"ap > 08:00"|"after eight o’clock"|"“Then we shall firmly hand ourselves back to him,” said Peter, cheerfully. “People like you and me are not so easily got rid of. I told him, any time after eight o’clock. This looks like the gate.”"|"Busman's Honeymoon"|"Dorothy L. Sayers"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"“Ho!” said Mrs. Ruddle. “Well, ’e never told me nothing about it. Off to Broxford ’e was, by the ten o’clock bus Wednesday night, and never said nothing to nobody, not to mention leave me my week’s money.”"|"Busman's Honeymoon"|"Dorothy L. Sayers"
"ap 09:45"|"quarter to ten"|"“It’s only a quarter to ten,” replied Miss Twitterton, with a deprecating glance at a little china clock in the shape of a pansy, “nothing, of course, to you—but you know we keep early hours in the country. I have to be up at five to feed my birds, so I’m rather an early bird myself—except on choir-practice nights, you know—Wednesday, such an awkward day for me with Thursday market-day, but then it’s more convenient for the dear Vicar. But, of course, if I’d had the smallest idea that Uncle William would do such an extraordinary thing, I’d have come over and been there to let you in. If you could wait five—or perhaps ten—minutes while I made a more suitable toilet, I could come now—as I see you have your beautiful car, perhaps—”"|"Busman's Honeymoon"|"Dorothy L. Sayers"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"“There!” exclaimed Mrs. Ruddle. “If Mr. Noakes ’ad a-let me know, I’d a-cleaned all them things away. That’ll be ’is supper wot ’e ’ad afore ’e caught the ten o’clock. But me not knowing and ’avin’ no key, you see, I couldn’t. But it won’t take me a minnit, m’lady, now we are here. Mr. Noakes took all ’is meals in ’ere, but you’ll find it comfortabler in the settin’-room m’lady, if you’ll come this way—it’s a much brighter room, like, and furnished beautiful, as you’ll see, m’lord.” Here Mrs. Ruddle dropped something like a curtsy."|"Busman's Honeymoon"|"Dorothy L.

"ap 10:15"|"three-quarters before eleven"|"The church clock down in the village was chiming the three-quarters before eleven when he finally coaxed Mrs. Merdle into her new quarters and re-entered the house, brushing the cobwebs from his hands. As he passed the threshold a thick cloud of smoke caught him by the throat and choked him. Pressing on, nevertheless, he arrived at the door of the kitchen, where a first hasty glance convinced him that the house was on fire. Recoiling into the sitting-room, he found himself enveloped in a kind of London fog, through which he dimly decried dark forms struggling about the hearth like genies of the mist. He said “Hallo!” and was instantly seized by a fit of coughing. Out of the thick rolls of smoke came a figure that he vaguely remembered promising to love and cherish at some earlier period in the day. Her eyes were streaming and her progress blind. He extended an arm, and they coughed convulsively together."|"Busman's Honeymoon"|"Dorothy L. Sayers"
