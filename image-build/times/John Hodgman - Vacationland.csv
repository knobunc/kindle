12:00|midday|"And from that home base I would go out and explore the semi-metropolises of Boston and Cambridge and suck the thin marrow from their bones. I would go to cafés and read Julio Cortázar alone. I would peruse the early work of Nik Kershaw at Planet Records in Kenmore Square. I would go to the first Newbury Comics and be scared by photographs of Wendy O. Williams and purchase Art Spiegelman’s Raw. At a midday animation festival at the Off the Wall cinema in Central Square, I saw “Vincent,” the first short by a then-unknown Tim Burton. “That young man is going places,” I said to nobody, because I was alone."|Vacationland|"John Hodgman"
12:00|midday|"Instead I read historic comic strips as literature and worked at a video store and lived in a basement. I went to London for one semester on a drink-abroad program of my own devising and got a job at a cheesemonger’s. I loved mongering. I would turn the cheeses over once in the morning and once in the afternoon (to keep their moisture evenly distributed) and between those times I would stand outside waiting for midday, when the beautiful French teenagers would descend from the École Français at the top of the street to pillage the neighborhood for warm hunks of bread and massive chocolate bars.

Now at the end of the long list of squandered advantages was this house in Massachusetts, my mother’s house, which on many panicky 3 a.m. awakenings I would darkly fantasize about liquidating for cash."|Vacationland|"John Hodgman"
"ap 01:01"|"one after one"|"But with the iPhone, Steve Jobs stole the internet from the desktops of the relatively few white nerds who had previously dominated its user base and put it in the hands of millions more. And many of those hands—soon the majority in the US—are brown. There is no privacy anymore. With a civilian surveillance device in everyone’s hands, the pattern could not be hidden, not even in Maine. We had video. We could see the similarity of the killings as they tumbled one after one into our feeds, the specific details, mitigating circumstances, and tragic split-second decisions blurring into what couldn’t be denied: a pattern, self-similar and replicating, seemingly infinite and seemingly unstoppable . . . an ugly fractal of injustice with cruel edges, twisting in on itself, choking out life."|Vacationland|"John Hodgman"
