"ap 01:00"|one|"So many promises I kept…
 It clicked together for me then. I wanted to be stupid and reckless, and I wanted to break promises. Why stop at one?"|"New Moon"|"Stephenie Meyer"
"ap 06:05"|"Six five"|"""Hey, Jacob!"" I felt an unfamiliar surge of enthusiasm at his smile. I realized that I was pleased to see him. This knowledge surprised me.
 I smiled back, and something clicked silently into place, like two corresponding puzzle pieces. I'd forgotten how much I really liked Jacob Black.
 He stopped a few feet away from me, and I stared up at him in surprise, leaning my head back though the rain pelted my face.
 ""You grew again!"" I accused in amazement.
 He laughed, his smile widening impossibly. ""Six five,"" he announced with self-satisfaction. His voice was deeper, but it had the husky tone I remembered."|"New Moon"|"Stephenie Meyer"
"ap 04:30"|"four thirty"|"Well, at least he'd made it home. Oddly, I didn't feel less worried. I trudged up the stairs, fretting. Maybe I would go down before work tomorrow to check on him. I could take soup–we had to have a can of Campbell's around here somewhere.
 I realized all such plans were canceled when I woke up early–my clock said four thirty–and sprinted to the bathroom. Charlie found me there a half hour later, lying on the floor, my cheek pressed against the cold edge of the bathtub."|"New Moon"|"Stephenie Meyer"
"> 23:00"|"after eleven at night"|"I called him Tuesday, but no one answered. Were the phone lines still having problems? Or had Billy invested in caller I.D.?
 On Wednesday I called every half hour until after eleven at night, desperate to hear the warmth of Jacob's voice."|"New Moon"|"Stephenie Meyer"
"ap ~ 01:08"|"About one-oh-eight"|"""Yeah. We run a little warmer than the normal people. About one-oh-eight, one-oh-nine. I never get cold anymore. I could stand like this""–he gestured to his bare torso–""in a snowstorm and it wouldn't bother me. The flakes would turn to rain where I stood."""|"New Moon"|"Stephenie Meyer"

12:00|noon|"It was a black car–a car I knew. I might be the furthest thing from an autophile, but I could tell you everything about that particular car. It was a Mercedes S55 AMG. I knew the horsepower and the color of the interior. I knew the feel of the powerful engine purring through the frame. I knew the rich smell of the leather seats and the way the extra-dark tint made noon look like dusk through those windows."|"New Moon"|"Stephenie Meyer"
12:00|noon|"""So we have till noon?"" ""If we're lucky. If he sticks with this decision."""|"New Moon"|"Stephenie Meyer"
12:00|noon|"The sun was terrifyingly high in the pale blue sky.
 ""He's still planning on noon?"" I checked.
 ""Yes. He's decided to wait. And they're waiting for him.""
 ""Tell me what I have to do."""|"New Moon"|"Stephenie Meyer"
"> 01:00"|"just after one in the morning"|"""It's just after one in the morning. So, about fourteen hours."" I stretched as he spoke. I was so stiff. ""Charlie?"" I asked."|"New Moon"|"Stephenie Meyer"
00:00|midnight|"""You don't have to be afraid,"" he said, anxious as he watched the tears dew up again on the rims of my eyes. ""I won't let them hurt you.""
 ""While you're here."" Not that I cared what happened to me when he left. He took my face between his two stone hands, holding it tightly while his midnight eyes glared into mine with the gravitational force of a black hole. ""I will never leave you again."" ""But you said  thirty,"" I whispered. The tears leaked over the edge. ""What? You're going to stay, but let me get all old anyway? Right.""
 His eyes softened, while his mouth went hard. ""That's exactly what I'm going to do. What choice have I? I cannot be without you, but I will not destroy your soul."""|"New Moon"|"Stephenie Meyer"
