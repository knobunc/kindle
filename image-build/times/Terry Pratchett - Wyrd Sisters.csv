00:00|midnight|"And Granny Weatherwax, striding home alone through the midnight forest, wrapped her shawl around her and considered. It had been a long day, and a trying one. The theater had been the worst part. All people pretending to be other people, things happening that weren’t real, bits of countryside you could put your foot through…Granny liked to know where she stood, and she wasn’t certain she stood for that sort of thing. The world seemed to be changing all the time."|"Wyrd Sisters"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 05:00"|five|"It began at five the next morning. Four men rode through the woods near Granny’s cottage, tethered the horses out of earshot, and crept very cautiously through the mists."|"Wyrd Sisters"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"However, in Bad Ass a cockerel laid an egg and had to put up with some very embarrassing personal questions. In Lancre town a man swore he’d met a man who had actually seen with his own eyes a tree get up and walk. There was a short sharp shower of shrimps. There were odd lights in the sky. Geese walked backward. Above all of this flared the great curtains of cold fire that were the Aurora Coriolis, the Hublights, whose frosty tints illuminated and colored the midnight snows."|"Wyrd Sisters"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"Champot was all right, if a bit tiresome. But Verence had backed away at the first sight of the Twins, toddling hand in hand along the midnight corridors, their tiny ghosts a memorial to a deed darker even than the usual run of regicidal unpleasantness."|"Wyrd Sisters"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"The midnight rain drummed on Magrat’s curtained windows as she thumbed her way purposefully through Goodie Whemper’s books of what, for want of any better word, could be called natural magic."|"Wyrd Sisters"|"Terry Pratchett"
11:57|"three minutes before noon"|"She shut the book with a snap and looked at her notes. First, she had to find out his name. The old peel-the-apple trick should do that. You just peeled an apple, getting one length of peel, and threw the peel behind you; it’d land in the shape of his name. Millions of girls had tried it and had inevitably been disappointed, unless the loved one was called Scscs. That was because they hadn’t used an unripe Sunset Wonder picked three minutes before noon on the first frosty day in the autumn and peeled left-handedly using a silver knife with a blade less than half an inch wide; Goodie had done a lot of experimenting and was quite explicit on the subject. Magrat always kept a few by for emergencies, and this probably was one."|"Wyrd Sisters"|"Terry Pratchett"
"~ 14:00"|"about 2 p.m"|"She’d dug out a startlingly green dress that was designed to be both revealing and clinging, and would have been if Magrat had anything to display or cling to, so she’d shoved a couple of rolled-up stockings down the front in an effort to make good the more obvious deficiencies. She had also tried a spell on her hair, but it was naturally magic-resistant and already the natural shape was beginning to assert itself (a dandelion clock at about 2 p.m.)."|"Wyrd Sisters"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap ~ 02:00"|"About two o’clock"|"Magrat hesitated. Perhaps instinct had got it wrong. “Well—” she said.
“About two o’clock. In the meadow by the pond, all right?”
“Well—”"|"Wyrd Sisters"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"A midnight breeze turned her gently around in the air, like an unsupported weathercock. She shivered and squinted at the moonlit mountains, the high Ramtops, whose freezing crags and ice-green chasms acknowledged no king or cartographer. Only on the Rimward side was Lancre open to the world; the rest of its borders looked as jagged as a wolf’s mouth and far more impassable. From up here it was possible to see the whole kingdom…"|"Wyrd Sisters"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"She dug her heels in and forced the broomstick to yield the last dregs of its power in a brief burst, sending it skimming erratically a few feet from the trees. As it sagged again and started to plow a furrow among the midnight leaves she tensed herself, prayed to whatever gods of the forest might be listening that she would land on something soft, and let go."|"Wyrd Sisters"|"Terry Pratchett"
"< 00:00"|"nearly midnight"|"He laid down the pen and rubbed his eyes. It must be nearly midnight, and the habit of a lifetime told him to spare the candles although, for a fact, they could afford all the candles they could eat now, whatever Vitoller might say."|"Wyrd Sisters"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"Hour gongs were being struck all across the city and night-watchmen were proclaiming that it was indeed midnight and also that, in the face of all the evidence, all was well. Many of them got as far as the end of the sentence before being mugged."|"Wyrd Sisters"|"Terry Pratchett"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"“It’s after midnight,” said Hwel. “And you know what your father said about going to bed late.”"|"Wyrd Sisters"|"Terry Pratchett"
05:00|"5 a.m."|"“Yes. He said he used to do it all the time when he was a lad. He said he’d think nothing of quaffing ale all night and coming home at 5 a.m., smashing windows. He said he was a bit of a roister-doister, not like these white-livered people today who can’t hold their drink.” Tomjon adjusted his doublet in front of the mirror, and added, “You know, Hwel, I reckon responsible behavior is something to get when you grow older. Like varicose veins.”"|"Wyrd Sisters"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"“We grow old, Master Hwel. At least,” he corrected himself, “I grow old and you grow older. We have heard the gongs at midnight.”"|"Wyrd Sisters"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"“I shouldn’t, then,” agreed Magrat.
“At eight o’clock.”
“I see.”"|"Wyrd Sisters"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 07:30"|seven-thirty|"“I see.”
“But meet for sherry beforehand at seven-thirty, i’faith.”
“I expect you shouldn’t tell me who is invited, either,” said Magrat."|"Wyrd Sisters"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap ~ 08:00"|"around eight o’clock"|"“Do you think there might be someone guarding it at around eight o’clock tomorrow?”"|"Wyrd Sisters"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"“We’re black and midnight hags!” they yelled, getting into the spirit."|"Wyrd Sisters"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"“We’re black and midnight hags!” they yelled, getting into the spirit.
“What kind of black and midnight hags?”
“Evil black and midnight hags!”"|"Wyrd Sisters"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"“What kind of black and midnight hags?”
“Evil black and midnight hags!”
“Are you scheming?”"|"Wyrd Sisters"|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"“What-are-you?” he screamed.
“We’re scheming evil secret black and midnight hags!”
“Right!” He pointed a vibrating finger toward the stage and lowered his voice and, at that moment, a dramatic inspiration dived through the atmosphere and slammed into his creative node, causing him to say, “Now I want you to get out there and give ’em hell. Not for me. Not for the goddam captain.” He shifted the butt of an imaginary cigar from one side of his mouth to the other, and pushed back a nonexistent tin helmet, and rasped, “But for Corporal Walkowski and his little dawg.”"|"Wyrd Sisters"|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"Tomjon half rose in his seat. He had played a great many kings, and most of them weren’t the kind of kings who shook hands graciously and asked people whether they enjoyed their work. They were far more the type of kings who got people to charge into battle at five o’clock on a freezing morning and still managed to persuade them that this was better than being in bed. He summoned them all, and treated Granny Weatherwax to a blast of royal hauteur, pride and arrogance."|"Wyrd Sisters"|"Terry Pratchett"
