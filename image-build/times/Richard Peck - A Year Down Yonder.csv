12:00|"high noon"|"As the train pulled out behind me, there came Grandma up the platform steps. My goodness, she was a big woman. I’d forgotten. And taller still with her spidery old umbrella held up to keep off the sun of high noon. A fan of white hair escaped the big bun on the back of her head. She drew nearer till she blotted out the day."|"A Year Down Yonder"|"Richard Peck"
"< 00:00"|"nearly midnight"|"Presently she said to Mildred, “We’ll talk about that dollar another time. You better get on your way. You’ve got five miles of bad road ahead of you. You won’t be home till pretty nearly midnight.”"|"A Year Down Yonder"|"Richard Peck"
12:00|noon|"She turned to give me one of her repertoire of surprised looks. It was daylight, and that was like noon to her. “Of course there’s no school. It’s Armistice Day.”"|"A Year Down Yonder"|"Richard Peck"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"People took Armistice Day seriously back then, nineteen years after the end of the Great War. In Chicago everything stopped at eleven o’clock, even the street-cars. People stood for a minute of silence, remembering."|"A Year Down Yonder"|"Richard Peck"
"ap < 11:00"|"nearly eleven o’clock"|"They shot some more. Then the head Legionnaire threw up his arm. “Troopers, hold your fire! It’s pretty nearly eleven o’clock.”"|"A Year Down Yonder"|"Richard Peck"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"I moved on to biology, falling into the rhythm of Grandma’s snore. A Seth Thomas steeple clock stood on a high shelf. When it struck ten, Grandma jerked awake. She looked around the room astonished. It was her belief that she never slept, not even in bed."|"A Year Down Yonder"|"Richard Peck"
"ap 05:09"|"five nine"|"Milton Grider flipped his pencil and slumped in his desk. At five nine, he’d been the tallest boy in school, till now. The new boy seemed to be six feet tall, easy. The back of Carleen Lovejoy’s head vibrated."|"A Year Down Yonder"|"Richard Peck"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"So Carleen had to. Royce looked up as she slumped past him. The back of her neck was valentine-red and hot-looking. The door closed behind her. It was eight o’clock on the nose, so we all got up to give the Pledge of Allegiance."|"A Year Down Yonder"|"Richard Peck"
12:00|noon|"Ina-Rae lifted her desktop to sneak peeks at her valentines all morning long, cooing loudly. Down in the basement at noon when we were eating out of our dinner buckets, all the girls wanted to sit near her, even Irene Stemple."|"A Year Down Yonder"|"Richard Peck"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"Then on Washington’s Birthday, the tea was set for four o’clock, so I hightailed it home from school. In the kitchen the tarts were laid out on cookie sheets, little works of art, each and every one. Grandma was nowhere to be seen."|"A Year Down Yonder"|"Richard Peck"
