""It is  easy  for those  who need  not judge,  or judging need not toil  for justice,  to complain  of inequity  and talk  of impartiality.  When one must  actually  judge,  as  Tzadkiel  does,  he  finds  he  cannot  be  just  to  one  without  being unjust to another.  In fairness  to those  on Urth who will die,  and especially  to the poor  and ignorant  people  who  will  never  understand  what  it  is  they  die  for,  he  summoned  their representatives—"""|"The Urth of the New Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
"> 15:00"|"after nones"|"I told  her I was,  and asked  whether we could  not sit  down somewhere.  A big  man  with  a loud voice—I  suppose  he was  one of the sick  man's  relations—elbowed  his  way through the crowd  demanding  to know whether ""Declan""  would recover.  I said  I  did  not  know,  all the while trying to force my way through the press  in the direction  Burgundofara  indicated. It was after nones, and the autumn day had grown  warm,  as  such days  sometimes  do.  If I had felt better,  I would have found the milling,  sweating  peons  comic;  they were  just such an assembly  as  we had terrified  when we had performed  Dr.  Tabs's  play  at  Ctesiphon's Cross. Now I was suffocated by them."|"The Urth of the New Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"

We'll  tie  up there  two days  to load  and  unload, then go on down. Nessus to the delta generally takes a fortnight or a bit less."""|"The Urth of the New Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
"< 12:00"|"BEFORE NOON"|"BEFORE NOON we were racing along like a yacht. The wind  sang  in the rigging,  and the first  big  drops  of rain  spattered  the ship  like  paint  flung at her canvas.  From  my  position by  the  quarterdeck  rail,  I  watched  the  mizzentop  and  main  topgallant  struck  and  the remainder of our hamper reefed again and again. When Hadelin came to me, excessively polite, to suggest I go below, I asked him if it would not be wise to tie up."|"The Urth of the New Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
00:00|midnight|"""Very  well, then. You know what's  happened  to the Old Sun: it  is  dying.  I  don't  mean  that it's about to go out like a lamp at midnight.  That would take  a very long time.  The wick—if you  can  think  of  it  so—has  been  trimmed  by  only  the  width  of  a  hair,  and  the  corn  has rotted  in  the  fields.  You  don't  know  it,  but  the  ice  in  the  south  is  already  gathering  new strength. To the ice of ten chiliads will be added the ice  of the winter  now almost  upon us, and the two will embrace  like  brothers  and begin  their  march  upon  these  northern  lands. Great  Erebus,  who has established  his  kingdom  there,  will  soon  be  driven  before  them, with all his fierce, pale warriors.  He will unite his  strength  with Abaia's,  whose  kingdom  is in  the  warm  waters.  With  others,  less  in  might  but  equal  in  cunning,  they  will  offer allegiance  to the rulers  of the lands  beyond  Urth's waist,  which  you  call  Ascia;  and  once united with them will devour them utterly."""|"The Urth of the New Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
00:00|midnight|"Later it revolved  before  my closed  eyes,  luminant in the darkness  and distinct  from  hilt of bone to needle point. When I slept at last, I found it among my dreams as well. Perhaps for that reason, I slept badly. Again and again  I woke  and blinked  at the cell  light glowing  above  my  head,  rose  and  stretched,  and  crossed  to  the  port  to  search  for  the white  star  that  was  another  self.  At  those  times  I  would  gladly  have  surrendered  my imprisoned  body  to death,  if  I could  have done  it  with honor, and  fled,  streaming  through the midnight  sky to unite my being.  In those  moments  I  knew  my  power,  that  could  draw whole worlds  to me and incremate  them as  an artist  burns his  earths  for pigments.  In the brown  book,  now  lost,  that  I  carried  and  read  so  long  that  at  last  I  had  committed  to memory  its  whole  contents  (though  they  had  once  seemed  inexhaustible)  there  is  this passage:  ""  Behold,  I have  dreamed  a dream  more;  the  sun  and  the  moon  and  eleven stars  made  obeisance  to  me.""  Its  words  show  plainly  how  much  wiser  the  peoples  of ages long past  were  than we are  now; not for nothing  is  that book  titled   The  Book  of the Wonders of Urth and Sky."|"The Urth of the New Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
"ap > 02:00"|"after  two"|"There was firewood enough for an army, but though I sifted it for the kegs  and boxes  Eata had hoped  to find,  they  were  not  there;  after  two  watches,  a  stoppered  bottle  half-full  of rough red  wine  was  the sole  discovery  I  could  boast,  the  wrack  of  some  low  tavern  like that in  which  Maxellindis's  uncle  had  died.  By  striking  stone  upon  stone  and  discarding those that seemed least promising, I eventually produced  an occasional  feeble  spark;  but nothing  that  would  ignite  the  still-damp  tinder  I  had  collected.  When  the  New  Sun  was hidden and my futile efforts were mocked by the silent  fires  of stars,  I gave  up and settled down to sleep, somewhat warmed by the wine."|"The Urth of the New Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
00:00|midnight|"I drew breath, and it was of air and not water. I stamped, and I stood upon solid ground. What had been  the flood  was  a pampa  of waist-high  grass,  a sea  of grass  whose  shore was  lost  in  swirling  white,  as  though  a  rout  of  ghosts  danced  there  swiftly,  silently,  and somberly.  The caress  of the mist  failed  to horrify  me, but  it  was  as  mucid  as  that  of  any specter in a midnight tale. Hoping to find food and to warm myself, I began to walk. It is said that they who wander in darkness, and still more they who do so in a mist,  merely scribe  circles  across  the plain.  Perhaps  it  was  so  for  me,  but  I  do  not  believe  it.  A  faint wind stirred the mist, and I kept that wind ever at my back."|"The Urth of the New Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
14:00|"about nones"|"Dawn  came  at  last.  The  sun  of  the  preceding  day  had  left  me  reddened  and  tender;  I stayed  in the ravine,  where  there  was  at times  a  little  shade,  and  made  my  way  through the stream  or beside  it,  finding  the body  of a peccary  killed  when it  had  come  to  drink.  I tore a bit of meat away, chewed it, and washed it down with muddy water. It was about nones when I came in sight of the first pump. The ravine was nearly seven ells deep, but the autochthons had built a series of little dams like the steps of a stair, piling up the river  stones.  A wheel hung with leathern  buckets  reached  thirstily  down for  the  water, turned  by  two  squat,  mummy-colored  men  who  grunted  with  satisfaction  each  time  a bucketful splashed into their clay trough."|"The Urth of the New Sun"|"Gene Wolfe"
