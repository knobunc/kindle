rolled over and punched him in the shoulder and hissed, “Why didn’t
you turn that fucking thing off before bed?”"|"When Sysadmins Ruled the Earth"|"Cory Doctorow"
"> 01:00"|"after 1AM"|"Kelly was sitting up in bed now, an indistinct shape against the
headboard. “In five years of marriage, you have never once been
able to fix anything from here.” This time she was wrong—he fixed
stuff from home all the time, but he did it discreetly and didn’t
make a fuss, so she didn’t remember it. And she was right, too—he
had logs that showed that after 1AM, nothing could ever be fixed
without driving out to the cage. Law of Infinite Universal
Perversity—AKA Felix’s Law."|"When Sysadmins Ruled the Earth"|"Cory Doctorow"
02:00|2AM|"“I’m sorry I woke you,” he said. He was almost at the data
center. No traffic at 2AM. He slowed down and pulled over before
the entrance to the garage. He didn’t want to lose Kelly’s call
underground."|"When Sysadmins Ruled the Earth"|"Cory Doctorow"

1:30"|"“What? Oh. My personal box is over there. It went down around
1:30 and I got woken up by my process-monitor. I should have called
you and told you I was coming down—spared you the trip.”"|"When Sysadmins Ruled the Earth"|"Cory Doctorow"
02:00|2AM|"“No, it’s Microsoft’s fault,” Felix said. “Any time I’m at work
at 2AM, it’s either PEBKAC or Microsloth.”"|"When Sysadmins Ruled the Earth"|"Cory Doctorow"
10:00|10AM|"Felix and Van got the Ardent boxes back online one at a time.
They were being pounded by worm-probes—putting the routers back
online just exposed the downstream cages to the attack. Every box
on the Internet was drowning in worms, or creating worm-attacks, or
both. Felix managed to get through to NIST and Bugtraq after about
a hundred timeouts, and download some kernel patches that should
reduce the load the worms put on the machines in his care. It was
10AM, and he was hungry enough to eat the ass out of a dead bear,
but he recompiled his kernels and brought the machines back online.
Van’s long fingers flew over the administrative keyboard, his
tongue protruding as he ran load-stats on each one."|"When Sysadmins Ruled the Earth"|"Cory Doctorow"
05:00|"five this morning"|"“I’m Uri Popovich, this is Diego Rosenbaum. Thank you all for
coming up here. Here’s what we know for sure: the building’s been
on generators for three hours now. Visual observation indicates
that we’re the only building in central Toronto with working
power—which should hold out for three more days. There is a
bioagent of unknown origin loose beyond our doors. It kills
quickly, within hours, and it is aerosolized. You get it from
breathing bad air. No one has opened any of the exterior doors to
this building since five this morning. No one will open the doors
until I give the go-ahead."|"When Sysadmins Ruled the Earth"|"Cory Doctorow"
"~ 02:00"|"about 2AM"|"“Attacks on major cities all over the world have left emergency
responders in chaos. The attacks are electronic, biological,
nuclear and conventional explosives, and they are very widespread.
I’m a security engineer, and where I come from, attacks in this
kind of cluster are usually viewed as opportunistic: group B blows
up a bridge because everyone is off taking care of group A’s dirty
nuke event. It’s smart. An Aum Shin Rikyo cell in Seoul gassed the
subways there about 2AM Eastern—that’s the earliest event we can
locate, so it may have been the Archduke that broke the camel’s
back. We’re pretty sure that Aum Shin Rikyo couldn’t be behind this
kind of mayhem: they have no history of infowar and have never
shown the kind of organizational acumen necessary to take out so
many targets at once. Basically, they’re not smart enough."|"When Sysadmins Ruled the Earth"|"Cory Doctorow"
