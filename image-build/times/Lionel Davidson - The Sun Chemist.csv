I mean, with that spiffy case and everything I might have looked a bit important. They probably hung around waiting for me to come down. There were people around when I went in, you see.

His bed against the wall, a most elegant bed, single; it was in some smooth light wood like pale ebony, head and foot ceremonially curved with a suggestion of Egypt and also Empire; Napoleon in Egypt. Beside the bed, a small commode with a silver candlesnuffer and a clock (stopped at 6 a.m., when he died), and also his prayer book, placed slightly askew as he had laid it down, yellowish pages open at the place."|"The Sun Chemist"|"Lionel Davidson"

He’d had a sudden desire for chutney, and then wouldn’t take it; his every remark by now was being noted, the end near. The following evening. November 8th, he went into a coma, and he died at six on the morning of the ninth. I could imagine the nurse, listening to his breathing, running in at the door.

"ap 09:00"|0900|"I was looking at the envelope. It was postmarked ‘Frognal, 0900, Dec. 18.’ That was the day I’d left. Hopcroft had been hit on the head the previous day. This was surely very peculiar. She hadn’t had the papers when Hopcroft saw her. By express post the following morning, they were in the mail. I laboriously worked this out. She had been going to stay with a friend at Frognal after Hopcroft had left. She had been going to Wimbledon two days later. Well, evidently she’d changed her mind. Perhaps she had prevailed on the friend to go down to Wimbledon with her that very day, perhaps in the evening. Perhaps she had discovered her husband would be out. Perhaps the friend had gone alone. Whatever it was, she must have got the letters the same day that Hopcroft had been bashed, and before he’d had time to yarn his story to half the world. This certainly was a stroke of luck."|"The Sun Chemist"|"Lionel Davidson"
"ap 11:30"|"half past eleven"|"‘I have to go.’ I suddenly saw with astonishment and alarm that it was half past eleven. ‘I have to go in half an hour,’ I said. I’d totally forgotten the weekend of illicit bliss. At least, it wasn’t so very illicit for me: It was illicit for Marta. The well-adjusted person had a good six months of appetites that needed satisfying. Illicit or not, there was no doubt that she was now buzzing through her morning in high expectation of some very active bliss."|"The Sun Chemist"|"Lionel Davidson"
"ap ~ 03:00"|"about three o’clock"|"We plodded away in the otherwise silent House till about three o’clock, when Marta turned up, and we took a break. She’d walked through the Institute grounds. The House itself, in its ten acres of woodland, was outside the Institute property but the whole area was part of the Weizmann Memorial Foundation. By car, you could only approach the House by the side road and the gatekeeper’s lodge. There was no resident gatekeeper any more, and the big solid-paneled steel gate was locked after office hours. Connie had a key to this gate, so she’d been able to leave her car in the drive."|"The Sun Chemist"|"Lionel Davidson"
"ap ~ 03:45"|"about a quarter to four"|"We all sat and had a friendly cup of tea around the kerosene stove in her room. Both ladies were in a state of concealed ill temper with me.

"ap < 08:00"|"nearly eight o’clock"|"It was nearly eight o’clock. A good three hours’ work lay ahead translating the nattering that had gone to and fro between London and the Sanatorio Stefania in 1933. I would have to get some dinner. I certainly didn’t fancy negotiating the woodlands again for it. It was a question of seeing what was in the fridge below."|"The Sun Chemist"|"Lionel Davidson"
"< 00:00"|"a little before midnight"|"Well, that was it, and I could see right away the answer to one of the problems and experienced a certain lightening of heart. But there was really no time to go into it now. The translation had to be ready by the morning, so I buckled to, and managed to finish a little before midnight. I took the things I’d used down to the kitchen and washed them up. There were a few carrots in the vegetable rack. I munched a couple to help with the night vision, as I went round switching everything off and relocking doors, and then took to the woods again."|"The Sun Chemist"|"Lionel Davidson"
"ap 09:30"|"half past nine"|"The bike was where I’d left it. I pedaled back to the San Martin, let myself in, and took my room key. There was a note in the slot: Professor Tuomisalo had phoned me at half past nine. She hadn’t left a message."|"The Sun Chemist"|"Lionel Davidson"

Olga was on the third floor, and a detective was just leaving as we arrived. He gave us rather a keen look, and Hopcroft said, ‘Quite all right. Friends of the family.’ He tried to start a conversation with the detective, but the man was not communicative and went; I was shaking hands with Olga.

His death certificate fell out and I popped it back in again. In the last hour of work I’d drifted a bit – Hopcroft’s old complaint – to pore reminiscently over the old lion’s last winters of discontent.

To keep him quiet, Ben-Gurion sent the Cabinet secretary once a week to read him the list of decisions already reached.

Still not nine o’clock: barely a couple of hours since the nightmare had begun. It showed no signs of abating. It had become that bit worse, in fact; was insidiously transforming itself into that more hideous type in which the awful things happened in a jolly carnival atmosphere with nobody apparently noticing, or caring if they did.

They were doing it on an almost empty restaurant balcony, snapping at each other in Hebrew as they scraped leavings off the plates. The floodlighting went off suddenly at the mosque, and I looked round and saw it dying on the walls of the Crusader city, too. Midnight, evidently. The lion-colored walls had turned ashen gray, all of a sudden terribly old and insubstantial in the moonlight. The harbor below came suddenly into its own, good nights ringing out, cars maneuvering. One backed and turned, its two fingers of light swinging across the water. As they did so, I saw another piece of flotsam bobbing in the sparkle by the jetty."|"The Sun Chemist"|"Lionel Davidson"
