00:00|midnight|"He sighed then shook his head. ‘But there are worse places in this castle, and the worst place of all is the one that I have to visit every night. And I have to visit it alone. It’s a place we call the “Witch Well”. There’s a prisoner down there that it’s best to keep away from. He’s tethered to a ring in the dungeon floor by a long chain. He sleeps all day but is wide-awake after dark and has to be fed at midnight, or things could get really awkward for everybody who works here. Someone has to do that dangerous job and as the most experienced guard on the night shift it falls to me. As well as the special prisoner, the well has something else to make it a fearsome place. It’s haunted by foul things – the ghosts of those confined there long ago. I only wish I didn’t have to go there, but duty is duty. I’ll show you where the well is later, but first I’ll make us both that hot drink to ward off the chills of the night.’"|Haunted|"Susan Cooper"
00:00|midnight|"‘You’ll have to do it, boy!’ he told me. ‘The prisoner in the Witch Well has to be fed at midnight and there’s only you available to do it tonight. I can’t afford to leave the gate.’"|Haunted|"Susan Cooper"
00:00|midnight|"‘There are two buckets waiting for you in Execution Square – directly underneath the gallows. Give the prisoner the first at midnight then the second course about ten minutes later. Just tip each bucket down the steps. Don’t linger. Get out of there just as quickly as you can. So off you go on your rounds but when you hear the church bell sound at quarter to the hour make your way to the Witch Well.’"|Haunted|"Susan Cooper"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"Captain Miller said that at six o’clock there would be dinner for us, this being our first night, and that they’d leave us to settle in. We weren’t supposed to get any meal except breakfast, so this was nice of them. They both went away, their shoes clopping against the gleaming wooden floor."|Haunted|"Susan Cooper"
"ap ~ 06:00"|"about six o’clock"|"James did come back, but not for hours. By about six o’clock Mum was getting really worried and Dad was demanding that the Millers find them another boat. Mrs Miller was unhappy and silent, and Captain Miller kept saying to Dad, ‘The lad can look after himself, I’m sure.’"|Haunted|"Susan Cooper"
"ap > 11:00"|"past eleven o’clock"|"The time dragged by. He went to bed and then spent several impatient hours waiting for the rest of the household to settle down. When it had been completely quiet for twenty minutes, he shone a torch on his watch and saw that it was past eleven o’clock."|Haunted|"Susan Cooper"
"ap 05:30"|"half-past five"|"Sitting on the bunk he heaped cushions at one end for pillows, and took a small brass travel clock from his rucksack. Its steady tick was reassuring and he set the alarm for half-past five. That would give him plenty of time to tidy up and get back to the house before anyone was awake."|Haunted|"Susan Cooper"
00:00|midnight|"Bram hesitated for an instant then nodded. It would be wonderful to go exploring the midnight seashore with a spirit child."|Haunted|"Susan Cooper"
00:00|midnight|"Bram scratched his head. She didn’t seem able to hold any one thought in her head for more than two minutes. He liked the idea of a midnight swim, though, so nodded readily."|Haunted|"Susan Cooper"
"ap 05:55"|"five to six"|"Bram spent a few minutes putting the hut in order, folding the blanket and hanging the plate back on the wall. He toyed with the idea of using the little gas stove to cook himself some breakfast but he had forgotten to bring any eggs. He was also too tired for a wake-up swim so he locked the hut behind him and ran back through the town. At five to six he slipped into his aunt’s house and tiptoed to his bedroom."|Haunted|"Susan Cooper"
"ap < 09:00"|"almost nine o’clock"|"‘Mum’s called you three times already!’ she said. ‘It’s almost nine o’clock! Wake up, you lazy pig.’"|Haunted|"Susan Cooper"
"ap 11:30"|"half-past eleven"|"At half-past eleven he was running through the streets, heading for the beach. Once inside the hut he lit the lanterns, took out the brass clock, sat on the bunk and willed the hands to go round faster. When they pointed to midnight, the briny smell of the deep sea filled the hut and Drusilla was there."|Haunted|"Susan Cooper"

00:00|midnight|"‘No I didn’t. You’re my friend! I would never hurt you. Is that what he said? He’s a wicked monster. He’s a devil! He lies and tries to trap me. Don’t believe him, Bram! He doesn’t want me to have a friend. He wants me to be all alone out here in the midnight dark.’"|Haunted|"Susan Cooper"
00:00|midnight|"The chaplain sat in the bishop’s chair. He did not offer Harry a seat. He said, in the bored voice of a teacher, ‘Summonings take place at Cwm because it is a lonely place, and if the devil blasts it, only the Summoners will be hurt. It is done as follows: twelve candles are lit in the church. Twelve priests, nuns or monks stand near them. The Chief Summoner calls the Thing from hell on the stroke of midnight. The Summoners pray the Thing into a bottle and seal it therein with molten lead, and the whole is buried under running water so that the Thing can walk no more. And when the Thing is under the water, the priests and the nuns will be richly rewarded, and your uncle can have that farm he keeps pestering the bishop about.’ The chaplain frowned. ‘Though, of course, many perish during a praying down. And sometimes if the Thing has eaten enough souls it is content and goes back to hell, and troubles us no more. Well, that’s all. Away with you.’"|Haunted|"Susan Cooper"
12:00|noon|"The sun came up and printed the long shadows of the trees over the ground. Harry thought they looked like fingers out to grab him and rode round them whenever possible. At noon the bishop’s groom took out some bread and cheese. He did not offer any to Harry. ‘You must fast,’ he said. ‘Orders from the chaplain.’ He chewed a bit. ‘Not that it will do you any good. The bishop’s sending every priest and nun he wants to be rid of to Cwm.’ He laughed, mouth open. ‘He’s promised them money. But we reckon he won’t have to spend it, because at midnight you’ll be a nice snack for Vaughan Darkness, and that’ll be the end of you.’"|Haunted|"Susan Cooper"

00:00|midnight|"Silence fell, broken only by the moan of the wind and the heavy tick of the clock. There was a clunk and a whirring, the first stroke of midnight boomed in the freezing air. Father Marcus held his book to the light of the candles and began to read."|Haunted|"Susan Cooper"
00:00|midnight|"The last stroke of midnight died away. The candle flames stood still as golden spearheads and the clock ticked on. A nun said something to another nun. Nothing is going to happen, Harry told himself, warm with relief. Nothing at all—"|Haunted|"Susan Cooper"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"Not much happened today. We had porridge for breakfast and pasta salad for school lunch, which was disgusting. We were supposed to finish these ‘Days in the Life Diaries’ in the afternoon but me and Craig didn’t get ours done because we had to go for our guitar lessons. So Mrs Preece said we could finish them tonight as long as we got them to her house by six o’clock because she wants to read them before Monday. That’s OK because she lives near me and Craig."|Haunted|"Susan Cooper"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"This is the ‘Days in the Life Diary’ handed in by Craig Evans to Mrs Preece, with his own work, at five o’clock on April 13th. At five-past five on the same evening, the Davies house was destroyed by a freak whirlwind. The entire Davies family vanished, and no trace of them has been seen since."|Haunted|"Susan Cooper"

"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"‘Come on, it’ll be fun. It says everyone meets up at eight o’clock by the river, just outside the King’s Head pub.’ Then he read an extract from the guidebook. ‘Expect to be frightened out of your skin as legendary ghost-tour guide Dorian Deadwater takes you to horribly haunted graveyards, spooky inns, medical manor houses and other sites roamed by York’s most famous ghosts.’"|Haunted|"Susan Cooper"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"‘Yes,’ said Oscar’s dad. ‘I know the feeling. But if we don’t find out the truth there’s going to be a big doubt buzzing around our heads. The kind of doubt that keeps you awake at three in the morning. Let’s get to the bottom of this.’"|Haunted|"Susan Cooper"
"ap ~ 03:00"|"about three"|"It was a calm day, just as it had been the day before. Jez knew exactly what he wanted to do. He wanted to find the ghost boy again. He wanted to help him. He stood by the window with his hands cupped like a telescope, and looked out to the horizon. It was a bit bumpy, he thought, but not too bad. He calculated that the tide would be an hour later than it had been yesterday, so it would be at its height at about three. He was going to row out to the Brisons. It would take him at least twice as long to row out as it had taken Uncle Jack, who was right about his muscles. He might not manage to get that far, but he could always turn back again. He would take it slowly, and if he did make it as far as the Brisons, he would come back in on the tide, like Uncle Jack had done, and so the return trip would be much faster. He felt his stomach clenching with fear. He had to do it."|Haunted|"Susan Cooper"
"~ 03:30"|"about half-past three in the morning"|"Jez enjoyed helping Uncle Jack and Sammy that afternoon. There were lots of farm jobs to be done that didn’t involve digging, which he was pleased about as his arms were aching from the morning’s rowing. The dog lollopped beside him for most of the time, but then ran off to the slipway to keep its watch there. After his evening meal Jez ran over with some scraps and the dog wolfed them down eagerly and then sat on its haunches, gazing out to sea again. Jez stood beside it, watching the white fling of spray against the Brisons. Was the boy there again? he wondered. Was the ghost ship there, invisible, searching the seas? He tried to calculate when the next high tide would be. He thought it would be about half-past three in the morning."|Haunted|"Susan Cooper"
"> 02:00"|"after two o’clock in the morning"|"Soon after two o’clock in the morning Jez crept downstairs and ran to the cove. The dog was there and loped up to him, and Jez threw him the handful of biscuits he’d brought in his pocket. When Jez pulled the Mayfly into the water the dog jumped inside it. Jez was quite pleased. At least he had company. This time he found the rowing much easier than before, and with the full moon he could see clearly where he was heading. He reached the Brisons without having too many pauses, and edged the boat towards the rock where the drowned boy had been. Now the silence was eerie. The dog cowered in the bottom of the boat, his ears pricked, moaning softly. Jez felt a chill creeping over him. A strange kind of phosphorescent light was drifting towards the Brisons. He shipped his oars as silently as he could, and waited."|Haunted|"Susan Cooper"
