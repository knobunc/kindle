12:00|noon|"It was a good hard climb to the top of the ridge and it was close to noon by the time he 
        got there. Far off to the north he could see the shape of a tractor-trailer moving across 
        the shimmering landscape. Ten miles. Maybe fifteen. Highway 90. He sat and swept the new 
        country with the glasses. Then he stopped."|"No Country for Old Men"|"Cormac McCarthy"
13:00|"One oclock in the afternoon"|"He raised his head and looked out across the bajada. A light wind from the north. Cool. 
        Sunny. One oclock in the afternoon. He looked at the man lying dead in the grass. His good 
        crocodile boots that were filled with blood and turning black. The end of his life. Here 
        in this place. The distant mountains to the south. The wind in the grass. The quiet. He 
        latched the case and fastened the straps and buckled them and rose and shouldered the 
        rifle and then picked up the case and the machinepistol and took his bearings by his 
        shadow and set out."|"No Country for Old Men"|"Cormac McCarthy"

        at the ceiling, the raw glare of the vaporlamp outside bathing the bedroom in a cold and 
        bluish light. Like a winter moon. Or some other kind of moon. Something stellar and alien 
        in its light that he'd come to feel comfortable with. Anything but sleep in the dark."|"No Country for Old Men"|"Cormac McCarthy"
02:15|"two-fifteen in the morning"|"He pulled in at the filling station under the lights and shut off the motor and got the 
        survey map from the glovebox and unfolded it across the seat and sat there studying it. He 
        finally marked where he thought the trucks should be and then he traced a route cross 
        country back to Harkle's cattle-gate. He had a good set of all-terrain tires on the truck 
        and two spares in the bed but this was some hard country. He sat looking at the line he'd 
        drawn. Then he bent and studied the terrain and drew another one. Then he just sat there 
        looking at the map. When he started the engine and pulled out onto the highway it was 
        two-fifteen in the morning, the road deserted, the truck radio in this outland country 
        dead even of static from one end of the band to the other."|"No Country for Old Men"|"Cormac McCarthy"

        getting his name and address. This was some twenty-four hours away. By then they would

        Not a dog. He turned and put his wrist to the doorlock and shot out the lock cylinder with

        light at the bedside table and stood there trying to think. He realized that the phone 
        might ring and he took the receiver from the cradle and laid it on the table. He pulled 
        back the covers and rumpled the pillows on the bed. He looked at the clock. Four 
        forty-three. He looked at the phone lying there on the table. He picked it up and pulled 
        the cord out of it and put it back in the cradle. Then he went over and stood at the door, 
        his thumb on the hammer of the shotgun. He dropped to his stomach and put his ear to the

        Wells came in at eleven-thirteen and Chigurh rose and followed him up the stairs, the 
        shotgun wrapped loosely in the newspaper he'd been reading. Halfway up the stairs Wells 
        turned and looked back and Chigurh let the paper fall and raised the shotgun to his waist.

        fend away what could not be fended away. Chigurh shot him in the face. Everything that 
        Wells had ever known or thought or loved drained slowly down the wall behind him. His 
        mother's face, his First Communion, women he had known. The faces of men as they died on 
        their knees before him. The body of a child dead in a roadside ravine in another country. 
        He lay half headless on the bed with his arms outflung, most of his right hand missing. 
        Chigurh rose and picked up the empty casing off the rug and blew into it and put it in his

        bed. He switched on the flashlight and went into the bathroom. He stood reading the labels 
        of the pharmacy bottles on the vanity. He looked out the window at the street below, the 
        dull winter light from the streetlamps. Two in the morning. Dry. Cold. Silent. He went out
