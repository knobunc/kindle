19:00|"seven in the evening"|"Simon Fronwieser saw it directly over Lake Ammer, where for a fraction of a second, it lit up the foaming waves in a sickly green. It was followed by a peal of thunder and a steady downpour—a black, soaking wall of rain that within moments drenched the two dozen or so pilgrims from Schongau. Though it was only seven in the evening, night had fallen suddenly. The medicus gripped the hand of his wife, Magdalena, tighter and, along with the others, prepared to climb the steep hill to the Andechs Monastery."|"The Poisoned Pilgrim"|"Oliver Potzsch"
12:00|noon|"“The apothecary?” The man grinned. “If I know the ugly bugger, he’s lying in bed snoring loudly. He didn’t show up for morning prayers. Well, he’ll hear from the abbot about that. But you can try your luck.” He pointed to a tiny, nondescript house down by the storage buildings. “But you better knock loudly, or he’ll sleep till noon prayers.”"|"The Poisoned Pilgrim"|"Oliver Potzsch"
12:00|noon|"The bodies twitching up in the branches of the oak… The young regimental hangman walks down the rows of the outlaws; one after the other, he lays nooses around their necks and pulls the whimpering young men up into the treetop with his strong arms… Only Jakob sees the tears streaming down the hangman’s cheeks, the tremble coursing through his powerful, hulking body, the silently mumbled curses… Jakob knows the man’s fears all too well, for they are his own… At night, his friend lies next to him, staring into the starless heavens, and swears an oath that Jakob himself made many years before… In the morning, his friend is gone, and only his weapons are left behind, still lying by the fire. The captain curses like the devil and sends a search party out after the deserter, Jakob among them. At noon, when the men return shaking their heads, Jakob silently thanks God. He sharpens his sword and tries to forget…
“By God, yes,” Kuisl murmured after an eternity. “I knew someone like that, someone who tried. Heaven knows what he’s doing now, but at least he tried. It’s just me, stupid bastard that I am, who returned from the war to keep hanging people.”"|"The Poisoned Pilgrim"|"Oliver Potzsch"
12:00|noon|"“The parents believed that a hundred rosaries and the donation of a candle would assure their child’s survival,” the alderman sputtered. “Fortunately I was able to convince them to leave the boy in your care, at least during noon mass. It’s a disgrace.” Carefully he placed the child down on a bale of straw in the corner of the low-ceilinged vault, then looked at Simon with a tired smile. “When I see sick children, I can’t help thinking of my little Clara and how you cured her back then, Fronwieser. I hope you can help this boy as well. Every child is a gift of God.” The young alderman reached for his belt and took out a purse of clinking coins. “Here, take this. I actually wanted to buy an arm’s-length bee’s-wax candle with the money and donate a new confessional booth, but I have the feeling the coins are better off invested here.”"|"The Poisoned Pilgrim"|"Oliver Potzsch"
12:00|noon|"Together the family climbed the steep lane up to the monastery church to find a quiet place to talk, but they soon found that wouldn’t be easy: The noon mass had just concluded, and crowds of attendees came streaming toward them. Magdalena noticed the number of pilgrims was significantly larger than the day before. There were still five days left before the Festival of the Three Hosts, but already the streets around the monastery were as crowded as at a church fair."|"The Poisoned Pilgrim"|"Oliver Potzsch"
12:00|noon|"Simon looked at Magdalena and sighed softly. He knew it wouldn’t be easy to get his father-in-law to go along with the plan. The idea had just come to him when he noticed the hefty Brother Martin in his robe in the procession of Benedictine monks. The robe was a perfect disguise to learn more about the inner circle of the Andechs monks. The Brothers knew Simon already, but his father-in-law seemed a better choice anyway. Grumpy and uncommunicative as he was, he could just as easily pass himself off as a Carthusian monk vowed to silence. At noon Simon told Magdalena about his plan, and since then, she’d been waiting for her cousin, the knacker, and his silent redheaded assistant to leave the house so she could speak with her father in peace and quiet."|"The Poisoned Pilgrim"|"Oliver Potzsch"
12:00|noon|"Kuisl summarized in brief what his daughter and Simon had told him that noon. Then he looked expectantly at his friend, waiting for his reply. “Tell me, Nepomuk,” he growled. “Do you have anything to do with these murders? You know it is no disgrace to kill someone: the two of us have done that often enough. But the law was always on our side.” His face darkened. “The law, or the war.”"|"The Poisoned Pilgrim"|"Oliver Potzsch"
12:00|noon|"Steering clear of the fires and the warm and inviting lights of the tavern, Magdalena climbed up the steep pathway toward the monastery, and was soon enveloped in silence. The stone wall around the monastery where she and Simon had sat in the warm sun yesterday noon had now become a black strip silhouetted against an even darker background. There was a cracking of branches in the bushes on either side of the path, and once Magdalena even thought she heard footsteps. She hurried along the path, finally passing through a gate and entering the monastery grounds. Here too, in contrast with the loud activity during the day, quiet prevailed. Somewhere she heard a single bell sound. Two drunks coming from the monastery tavern approached her, but they, too, stumbled silently past."|"The Poisoned Pilgrim"|"Oliver Potzsch"
"ap > 10:00"|"Shortly after ten o’clock"|"Shortly after ten o’clock mass a procession of three coaches came up the valley through Erling. A half dozen soldiers with muskets sat atop the first one, looking down pompously at the villagers. Behind them, drawn by two black stallions, came an imposing, well-sprung enclosed coach escorted by four musketeers on horseback on the left and right. The third coach, however, was a simple oxcart with a solid wooden cage nailed to the top, large enough for a man."|"The Poisoned Pilgrim"|"Oliver Potzsch"
12:00|noontime|"Holding his head high, the self-appointed inquisitor stomped off with an energetic stride, just as the noisy entourage of coaches, oxcarts, and soldiers came to a halt in front of the dairy. The guards descended slowly and headed toward the tavern for their well-deserved noontime beer. Clearly the transfer of the prisoner could wait until they’d quenched their thirst. None of the men paid any attention to the huge monk who quietly moved past them."|"The Poisoned Pilgrim"|"Oliver Potzsch"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"“We’re a bit early,” Kuisl said. “I’ve summoned our friend to come when the bells toll eleven o’clock, but I thought there would be no harm in arriving a bit early.” He grinned. “Not that we should expect any surprises.”"|"The Poisoned Pilgrim"|"Oliver Potzsch"
"< 00:00"|"SHORTLY BEFORE MIDNIGHT"|"SHORTLY BEFORE MIDNIGHT IN ANDECHS, THURSDAY, JUNE 17, 1666 AD,
GREETINGS, YOUR EXCELLENCY,” Kuisl exclaimed, bringing the lantern close so Simon and Magdalena could see the pale face of the abbot bathed in sweat."|"The Poisoned Pilgrim"|"Oliver Potzsch"
12:00|noon|"“Perhaps the abbot himself can explain what he’s doing here,” Kuisl interrupted. “In my letter this noon I merely introduced myself as his brother Virgilius and wrote that the monstrance and the hosts were hidden here.” He spat out loudly. “The fact that His Excellency comes to the lion’s den completely unaccompanied reveals that he probably knows much more about this than all the rest of us together. And about the robbery of the hosts. After all, he stole them himself, didn’t he?”"|"The Poisoned Pilgrim"|"Oliver Potzsch"
00:00|midnight|"Maurus Rambeck sat as still as stone for a long while as rain trickled down the bull’s-eye window in thin rivulets. The church bell tolled midnight, and not until the last sounds had died away did he turn to Jakob again. “Do you think you can find my brother?” he asked skeptically. “You, a dishonorable hangman from Schongau?”"|"The Poisoned Pilgrim"|"Oliver Potzsch"
00:00|Midnight|"Nepomuk tried to shake off the nightmare. Sitting in the dark, he’d lost all sense of time. What time was it? Midnight? Dawn? The trip in the oxcart from Andechs to Weilheim had taken perhaps three or four hours at a walking pace through the villages where people stood at the side of the road gawking at the box with the sorcerer. Peeking through cracks in the box, Nepomuk studied the faces of farmers watching the strange procession with a mixture of disgust, fear, and excitement. Many had crossed themselves and made signs to ward off evil."|"The Poisoned Pilgrim"|"Oliver Potzsch"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"The eleven o’clock bell tolled from the church belfry, and Rambeck slapped his forehead. “What a fool I’ve been, wasting time here while my colleagues have been waiting. I must return to the sacristy to prepare the liturgy.”"|"The Poisoned Pilgrim"|"Oliver Potzsch"
12:00|NOON|"ANDECHS, NOON ON FRIDAY, JUNE 18, 1666 AD
THE ROBE SCRATCHED and itched, and Jakob Kuisl thought he could smell in it the sweat of at least a dozen fat monks. Nonetheless, he pulled down his cowl as he made his way to the monastery. He had changed clothes down at the knacker’s house but then immediately returned to the Holy Mountain. The many pilgrims who had camped out in Erling and surrounding villages stepped aside respectfully, only a few stopping to wonder why the Franciscan was mumbling such unchristian curses."|"The Poisoned Pilgrim"|"Oliver Potzsch"
12:00|noon|"At noon the bailiffs opened the hatch to Nepomuk’s dungeon and let down a ladder. The monk briefly considered just refusing to go, but then they no doubt would beat him and drive him up the ladder rung by rung. He therefore decided to willingly climb up the blood-and dirt-soiled ladder toward the light."|"The Poisoned Pilgrim"|"Oliver Potzsch"
"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"The image of the charred corpse still on his mind, Simon headed back to the clinic. The pilgrims leaving the church were laughing and talking loudly, but he hardly noticed them as he continued mulling over the events of the last few hours. He wished he could speak with his father-in-law about them, but Kuisl had disappeared the previous day around noon. Simon wasn’t particularly worried. The old man often disappeared overnight in the forest when he went to collect herbs—though not in a forest possibly haunted by a madman."|"The Poisoned Pilgrim"|"Oliver Potzsch"
12:00|noon|"“This fellow here, by the way, is why I disappeared yesterday noon. I thought it best to disappear in the forest for a while.” He took a deep draw on his pipe and told Simon about the conversation he had overheard between Brother Benedikt and Laurentius and about his hasty flight from the building. He also mentioned the love letters he’d found in the novitiate master’s chest and the old plan the librarian had lost a few days ago."|"The Poisoned Pilgrim"|"Oliver Potzsch"
12:00|noon|"“They’ll get over it. Anyway…” The hangman stopped in the doorway and looked into the sunlight. “During the daylight, the sorcerer won’t dare show up; too many patients are awake. If he strikes, it will be at night. You can calmly go about caring for your patients during the day and keep watch over the novitiate master at night. It would be best to rub his wounds with an ointment of bear fat, marigold, and chamomile.” Raising his hand in a wave, he added, “Now farewell, bathhouse surgeon. I’ve not had anything to eat since noon yesterday—except for the berries and mushrooms I found in the forest.”"|"The Poisoned Pilgrim"|"Oliver Potzsch"
22:00|"ten o’clock at night"|"Sometimes pilgrims visited the chapel because water from the little fountain in the apsis was said to cure eye problems, but now, at ten o’clock at night, it was as quiet as the forest behind it. Small candles burned alongside the altar, casting a flickering light on the few pews where the three sat."|"The Poisoned Pilgrim"|"Oliver Potzsch"
12:00|NOON|"ANDECHS, NOON ON SUNDAY, JUNE 20, 1666 AD
SHORTLY BEFORE THE noon bells, pilgrims gathered on the square in front of the church, though many had been there since dawn. Amid the tightly packed crowd were brightly colored flags showing the coats of arms of many cities and villages. Simon stood wedged among a few pale, exhausted city people from Munich and a crowd of pilgrims from Augsburg who kept reciting the Lord’s Prayer and Ave Maria endlessly in their Swabian dialect. By now, over a thousand pilgrims must have crowded into the little square, and below the monastery even more were pressing up the narrow road. The pilgrims kept looking up toward the bay window of the church where the Three Holy Hosts were to be displayed at noon."|"The Poisoned Pilgrim"|"Oliver Potzsch"

12:00|noon|"Karl Semer nodded emphatically. “I swear by the bones of Saint Nicolas, it’s the truth, Your Excellency. When I heard you were looking for a large man, more than six feet tall with a hooked nose, I thought of him at once. This slick little bathhouse surgeon and his wife denied it, but at noon my son and I”—he said, pointing to young Sebastian Semer sitting beside him with an arrogant look on his face—“saw the hangman in the church square with our own eyes. He ran away, along with the medicus, and after that, it was almost as if the earth swallowed them up.”"|"The Poisoned Pilgrim"|"Oliver Potzsch"
18:00|"six in the evening"|"Huge black thunderclouds were gathering above Lake Ammer, advancing from the west across the water and extending their long, dark fingers toward the monastery. Even though it was just six in the evening, darkness lay over the mountain, silencing all life. The birds took shelter under branches, the foxes and badgers huddled in their holes, and even the wolves drew in their tails and crowded into packs, as if in this way they might better withstand the imminent danger."|"The Poisoned Pilgrim"|"Oliver Potzsch"
19:00|"seven in the evening"|"Climbing the final yards up the steep slope, they arrived in the muddy church square and stared up at the tower. Rain fell in their eyes, and though it was only seven in the evening, it was almost dark."|"The Poisoned Pilgrim"|"Oliver Potzsch"

IT WAS LATE morning when Simon struggled to open his eyes, feeling almost as if he was still paralyzed. Then he realized dirt and soot were still sticking to his eyelids. He had worked until late in the night, along with some Benedictine monks, to save the books in the library. Simon had been one of the last to venture into the burning building. As he emerged from the library at around two in the morning, an especially large pile of books in his arms, the flaming roof had crashed down behind him. He’d at least been able to save Athanasius Kircher’s Ars magna sciendi, but the Andechs chronicle that Matthias had stolen from him in the clinic was still missing."|"The Poisoned Pilgrim"|"Oliver Potzsch"
