12:00|noon|"Over the noon rice the next day Young Fu spoke to Li. “You are a good friend! Had you not seen Wei and mentioned it to Tang, I might not now be here eating rice and green vegetable. But I am sorry you missed the feast.”"|"Young Fu of the Upper Yangtze"|"Elizabeth Foreman Lewis"
12:00|noon|"Two more days passed. One noon a load-coolie sought him at Tang’s with a message from Fu Be Be. In the hills, farm work was heavy and she was still needed to help care for her sister-in-law, the grandmother. She would be there, perhaps, two weeks longer. She counseled him to seek the company of Wang Scholar in the evenings and to be careful of the money she had left in his keeping."|"Young Fu of the Upper Yangtze"|"Elizabeth Foreman Lewis"
12:00|noon|"“Take this with you,” she told him. “We cannot afford a feast for your associates, but you can use this to buy dessert for the noon meal.”"|"Young Fu of the Upper Yangtze"|"Elizabeth Foreman Lewis"
12:00|midday|"Her son tied the money in his belt and raced off to the shop. To his surprise no one but himself seemed aware of the importance of this date. As the morning wore on and neither Tang nor the workmen made any reference to the occasion, the youth was seized with apprehension. Soon it would be too late to run on the street and purchase delicacies for midday rice. It might be—fear chilled him—that Tang considered his record as apprentice too poor for the advance to journeyman. Anxiously his eyes followed every move the coppersmith made. At last the master, struggling to control amusement, approached."|"Young Fu of the Upper Yangtze"|"Elizabeth Foreman Lewis"
12:00|midday|"Before closing time Tang called to him. “You know, of course, that you are to remain here. Your wages will be three dollars for each moon of work. You will eat midday rice here; the other food your house will provide.”"|"Young Fu of the Upper Yangtze"|"Elizabeth Foreman Lewis"
12:00|midday|"One day followed another with no lightening of the tension. Every person in the place was aware of the undercurrent of trouble. At midday rice, talk was desultory. Tsu’s smart quips were few in number. Tang was forever lost in his own thoughts. Young Fu, suspicious of every word or look, fancied that Lu singled him out for harshness; the accountant made sly insinuations that caused the youth to burn with indignation. Once he overheard Tsu ask Lu, “Have you considered Li?”"|"Young Fu of the Upper Yangtze"|"Elizabeth Foreman Lewis"
12:00|noon|"The next morning there was no sign of the accountant. At noon another man filled his place."|"Young Fu of the Upper Yangtze"|"Elizabeth Foreman Lewis"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"The following morning he left the house in his usual workman’s suit. There was plenty of time before seven o’clock, and he would take advantage of the new public bathhouse before changing to the silk which he had managed to carry from his home without Fu Be Be’s knowledge. He entered the building, paid his fee, and, his toilet completed, gave the man in charge an extra cash to hold his soiled clothing until later in the day."|"Young Fu of the Upper Yangtze"|"Elizabeth Foreman Lewis"
00:00|midnight|"Young Fu sat up. “But it is still black as midnight.” He pulled the pu-gai about his shoulders. “Ai! it is cold.”"|"Young Fu of the Upper Yangtze"|"Elizabeth Foreman Lewis"
12:00|midday|"At midday rice he experienced the first taste of that torment with which a new apprentice is always greeted. Without acknowledging his presence, the men began to discuss the differences between city and country people, and the first seemed to have everything in their favor."|"Young Fu of the Upper Yangtze"|"Elizabeth Foreman Lewis"
12:00|noon|"Unexpected relief came with Tang’s entrance. The master sat down and told Den to bring him food. Old Tsu squinted in mock horror, “Let me bring it, please, instead of this honorable apprentice. His talk this noon has been weighted with wisdom. I had not guessed he knew so much about this business. Is it possible that you have offered him a partnership?”"|"Young Fu of the Upper Yangtze"|"Elizabeth Foreman Lewis"
12:00|midday|"At Tang’s, the workmen, discussing political conditions, as usual, over the midday rice, said that these troops were behaving better than most; at least, general looting was not taking place and, so far, a very moderate tax had been levied."|"Young Fu of the Upper Yangtze"|"Elizabeth Foreman Lewis"
12:00|midday|"But most clerks were like that. Reckoning accounts on the abacus and writing the results in books made them feel vastly superior to the journeymen and apprentices with whom they associated. Also, they were accustomed to having others do all unpleasant tasks for them. He, who had accompanied this one on the errands to wealthy homes, knew that only too well. And he would not now give the fellow the pleasure of laughing over the idea of an apprentice turned student. He wished, though, that he might tell Li—they were friends; but if he did, the whole shop would know it by midday. Li was not very successful about hiding things in his brain."|"Young Fu of the Upper Yangtze"|"Elizabeth Foreman Lewis"
"ap 09:00"|"Nine o’clock"|"Nine o’clock had come, and Chungking had risen early in honor of the New Year. Within the homes there had been the ceremony of the kitchen god’s return, followed by an elaborate breakfast. Now, robed in new finery, her people were about to start the day’s round of excitement. Gaiety was in the air. Bunting, multicolored, floated in the narrow streets above the people’s heads; from dingy house fronts fluttered handsome banners, bright with gold characters, expressing the season’s best wishes. Lacepaper ornaments, and pictures of Kwan Yin, Goddess of Mercy, Kwan Tih, God of Protection, and other important members of the heavenly circle shared places of honor. Fantastic lanterns and toys of every description were being offered for sale. New Year was here and all China was preparing to enjoy it."|"Young Fu of the Upper Yangtze"|"Elizabeth Foreman Lewis"
12:00|midday|"When he reached the coppersmith’s, they were eating midday food. Young Fu reached for his bowl, but ate little. The tea he had drunk spoiled his taste for this. Later he and Small Li stretched in a sunny corner, cracked a half-dozen watermelon seeds acquired at the tea house, and extracted the appetizing kernels. Tang and the older men smoked. From a distance came the sound of shots. It caused no excitement; shots were as familiar to Chungking ears as the cawing of magpies. The youth recalled the official chair. He mentioned it."|"Young Fu of the Upper Yangtze"|"Elizabeth Foreman Lewis"
12:00|noon|"They returned to work. During the afternoon Small Li, back from an errand, called out that fire burned without the city wall, just below the foreign hospital. Young Fu did not move his gaze from his soldering. That might have been what he smelled on the street at noon. Well, if it were in that quarter, he did not have to fear for his mother’s room on Chair-Makers’ Way."|"Young Fu of the Upper Yangtze"|"Elizabeth Foreman Lewis"
12:00|noon|"And then one morning Dsen, the journeyman, failed to appear. At noon, Tang with a grave face announced the workman’s death. He had, it was claimed, eaten heartily at a feast given by a neighbor. The neighbor raised pigs and when they became unexpectedly ill he had killed them and preserved the meat. Most of it had been sold, but choice bits he had held for himself and intimate friends, among whom had been Dsen."|"Young Fu of the Upper Yangtze"|"Elizabeth Foreman Lewis"
00:00|midnight|"Fu Be Be rose as he turned the corner of the street; she held out a hand for the package. When the brew had cooled a little, Young Fu carried it upstairs, and, assuming the role of authority, forced every drop between Wang Scholar’s unwilling lips. Then catching up a fan, he sat down on the floor beside the old teacher and prepared to spend the night.
At midnight Wang Scholar roused. “Why art thou here?” he asked.
“Because you needed me. How are you now?”"|"Young Fu of the Upper Yangtze"|"Elizabeth Foreman Lewis"
12:00|noon|"At the noon meal, Small Den brought the affair to the attention of the others. “How is our learned student at this hour?” he asked, bowing before Young Fu."|"Young Fu of the Upper Yangtze"|"Elizabeth Foreman Lewis"
12:00|midday|"Tang listened to this report and drew his brows together in a frown. At midday rice he discussed the matter with the workmen. That he himself was in a quandary, he confessed. Lu interrupted with an instance of a friend who, supposed to be dying, had under the ministrations of priests recovered."|"Young Fu of the Upper Yangtze"|"Elizabeth Foreman Lewis"
12:00|noon|"One of the boatmen prepared the noon meal on a tiny charcoal stove. The soldiers ate heartily, demanding more than their share. They made it clear that they did not underestimate their value to the coppersmith on this journey. Tang accepted their attitude without comment."|"Young Fu of the Upper Yangtze"|"Elizabeth Foreman Lewis"
00:00|midnight|"At sunset they reached Tu-To. The coppersmith had friends in the town, and he sent a member of the crew ashore to invite them on board. In an hour or so they appeared and remained until midnight."|"Young Fu of the Upper Yangtze"|"Elizabeth Foreman Lewis"
"> 12:00"|"after midday"|"“Do not hurry. There is no need for it. Save your strength for better work in the shop,” the master suggested with a smile. “We are getting a good start,” he continued, “and ought to reach Hochow soon after midday rice.”"|"Young Fu of the Upper Yangtze"|"Elizabeth Foreman Lewis"
12:00|noon|"At noon a shot whistled over their heads, then two more, then silence. The soldiers dropped to the floor of the boat; the crew missed a stroke, but rowed steadily on. Young Fu listened anxiously for a command to halt; none came. He looked at the others. Eyelids narrowed, Tang scanned the soft verdure of the closer bank. It betrayed nothing. The captain held the craft to her course and muttered to himself. The soldiers kept to their huddled position."|"Young Fu of the Upper Yangtze"|"Elizabeth Foreman Lewis"
03:00|"3 A.M."|"GENERAL
Hour of the Tiger: 3 A.M. to 5 A.M.
Ascend the Dragon: an expression that means “to die.”"|"Young Fu of the Upper Yangtze"|"Elizabeth Foreman Lewis"
