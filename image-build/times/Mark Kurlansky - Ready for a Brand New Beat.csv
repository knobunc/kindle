Most of the votes against it were from the South, but a notable exception was Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona, a leading contender for the Republican presidential nomination who also voted against the Civil Rights Bill."|"Ready for a Brand New Beat"|"Mark Kurlansky"
19:00|"seven at night"|"The day before, Bowie had called video director David Mallet, who made most of Bowie’s videos. “In those days,” said Mallet, “there was no such thing as a record without a video.” Bowie told Mallet that he was recording “Dancing in the Street” that next day and wanted to shoot a video that night. Mallet said, “I rang all the really good crews and they were there at seven at night.” He and his team of sixty donated services free to the charity, shooting at the London Docklands. “It was a wasteland of smelly old warehouses,” said Mallet. The site was later rebuilt for the 2012 Olympics."|"Ready for a Brand New Beat"|"Mark Kurlansky"

19:54|1954|"By 1954 black R&B recordings were garnering enough sales to occasionally slip onto the white pop charts, and by 1955 R&B music had gone from a backwater subculture of popular music aimed at ghettos and southern villages to a $25-million-a-year industry. The established record industry noticed this but generally dismissed it as a passing trend. Blacks making inroads on white music charts were no more welcome than blacks moving in on any other established white turf. It was when whites started taking prominent positions on the charts with what seemed to be black music, even sung and performed in a somewhat black way, that the record industry started to react. This happened in 1955, when Decca released a white group, Bill Haley and the Comets, singing “Rock Around the Clock,” and again in 1956 when RCA scored a phenomenal commercial success with Elvis Presley. This was music that appeared to have equal appeal to blacks and whites, a new phenomenon in the music industry that suggested both money (good) and social change (bad)."|"Ready for a Brand New Beat"|"Mark Kurlansky"

"ap 03:15"|"3/4 to 4"|"They picked up the tempo and turned the waltz, a song that ironically constantly repeats the word blue, into the blues, but with a hard beat. It was rhythm & blues. To listen to the slow and sentimental waltz in 3/4 time and then hear it souped up to an upbeat 4/4 with an insistent beat is the quickest way to understand what rock ’n’ roll was all about. In fact, for years, rock hits were created by switching an existing piece to four-beat measures with an upbeat tempo. In 1965, the Toys got to number 2 on the charts covering Bach with “A Lover’s Concerto,” in which songwriters Sandy Linzer and Denny Randell set words to Bach’s G major minuet and switched it from 3/4 to 4/4 time."|"Ready for a Brand New Beat"|"Mark Kurlansky"

A few musicians, chiefly Jamerson and drummer Bennie Benjamin, had serious alcohol problems. But a two a.m. session was also a way of getting string players from the Detroit Symphony, who were recorded in a small trapezoidal room."|"Ready for a Brand New Beat"|"Mark Kurlansky"
