  experience, only this time the movement was from right to left, the reverse
  of the first. In the next half hour it was repeated six times, always in the
  opposite direction—I mean, from left to right, then right to left and
  so on. He laid emphasis upon this, as though he thought it in some way
  significant. He said: ‘It was, as though it were weaving.’ I asked what ‘It’
  was like. He said: ‘It had no shape. It was just movement—No, it had no
  shape then.’ The feeling of not being alone in the room increased to such an
  uncomfortable pitch that shortly after midnight he left the library, leaving
  the lights burning, and turned in. There was no recurrence of the symptoms,
  in his bedroom. He slept soundly. Nor was he troubled the next night. By the
  day following he had almost forgotten the matter."|"Creep, Shadow!"|"A. Merritt"

  the library to go over his mail. He told me: ‘Suddenly I had the strongest
  feeling that someone was watching me from the curtains. I turned my head,
  slowly. I distinctly saw a shadow upon the curtains. Or, rather, as though it
  were intermingled with them—like a shadow cast by something behind. It
  was about the size and shape of a man.’ He jumped to the curtains and tore
  them away. Nothing was behind them nor was there anything beyond the window
  to cast a shadow. He sat down again at the table, but still he felt eyes upon
  him. ‘Unwending eyes,’ he said. ‘Eyes that never left me. Eyes of someone or
  something that kept always just past the edge of my field of vision. If I
  turned quickly, it slipped behind me, was watching me from my other side. If
  I moved slowly, just as slowly did it move.’"|"Creep, Shadow!"|"A. Merritt"

  afternoon at golf, dined out, went with a party to the theater and then to a
  night club. For hours he had given no thought to the experience of the night
  before. He said: ‘If I thought of it at all, it was to laugh at it as
  childish foolishness.’ He reached home about three o’clock. He let himself
  in. As he closed the door he heard a whisper—’You are late!’ It was
  quite plain, and as though the whisperer stood close beside him—”"|"Creep, Shadow!"|"A. Merritt"

  a thirsty seeker of knowledge.’ I asked, suspiciously: ‘Did you drink much
  last night?’ He said: ‘Not too much.’ I asked: ‘How about the shadow?’ He
  said: ‘Even more interesting.’ I said: ‘Dick, I want you to come right down
  and let me see you.’ He promised, but he didn’t come. I had a case you see
  that kept me late at the hospital. I got in about midnight and called him up.
  Simpson answered, saying he had gone to bed early and had given orders not to
  be disturbed. I asked Simpson how he seemed. He answered that Mr. Dick had
  seemed quite all right, unusually cheerful, in fact. Nevertheless, I could
  not rid myself of the inexplicable uneasiness. I told Simpson to tell Mr.
  Ralston that if he didn’t come in to see me by five o’clock next day I would

  them, and a subtle terror. I did not betray the shock his appearance gave me.
  I told him that I had gotten the last of the reports, and that they were
  negative. He said: ‘So I have a clean bill of health? Nothing wrong with me
  anywhere?’ I answered: ‘So far as these tests show. But I want you to go to

  edge to them. That flight from her tower for example. Why hadn’t I stayed and
  fought it out? I hadn’t even the excuse of Joseph fleeing from Potiphar’s
  wife. I knew I had been no Joseph. Not that this troubled my conscience
  particularly, but the facts remained that I had made a most undignified exit

  Ys—she had worsted me. Both facts outraged my pride."|"Creep, Shadow!"|"A. Merritt"

  landing stage. I went down to the boat. There were three men on it—
  Bretons or Basques, I couldn’t tell which, oddly enough. Rather queer looking
  —stolid faces, the pupils of their eyes unusually dilated, skins
  sallow. One turned his eyes up to me and asked, tonelessly, in French:"|"Creep, Shadow!"|"A. Merritt"
"ap > 04:00"|"after four"|"I followed her, uneasily. Something had gone amiss, something I had said
  or had not said about Helen. But what the devil it could have been, I did not
  know. I looked at my watch. It was after four. There was a fog, but the yacht
  seemed not to mind it; instead of diminishing, it seemed to me that the speed
  had increased. As we sat on the deck chairs, I mentioned this to the
  Demoiselle. She said, absently: “It is nothing. There can be no danger.”"|"Creep, Shadow!"|"A. Merritt"
"ap > 01:00"|"a few minutes after one"|"I sat up in my bed, wide-awake. The strange drowsiness was gone; the
  irresistible torpor lifted. What had awakened me? I looked at my watch, and

  few minutes after six. I opened the door, cautiously. The hall was
  shadowless; tranquil. There was not a sound in the house. It seemed to sleep,
  but I didn’t trust it. I closed the door quietly. There were great bolts at
  top and bottom which I dropped into place."|"Creep, Shadow!"|"A. Merritt"

  did go to sleep, honestly and dreamlessly."|"Creep, Shadow!"|"A. Merritt"

  had its peculiar charm. Before it was done I found myself dangerously close
  several times to thinking of the Demoiselle exactly as she wanted me to think
  of her. We dawdled, and it was eleven when we ended. She suggested a ride
  around the place, and with relief I went up to change my clothes. I had to
  snap my gun a few times and look at the leaves in McCann’s holster to clear
  my mind of disarming doubts. Dahut had a way with her."|"Creep, Shadow!"|"A. Merritt"
