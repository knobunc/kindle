You have until noon on 22th November to repay the outstanding amount in full, along with the interest incurred, otherwise steps will be taken to recover the amount."|"Brother's Ruin"|"Emma Newman"
12:00|noon|"The houses were crammed in tight together, the street between them dark even at noon, and a mangy-looking dog was sniffing a pile of rubbish at the far end of the street. Old newspapers rendered down to little more than drifts of dark grey pulp smudged the places where the houses met the pavement. She could hear a man and a woman shouting obscenities at each other in one of the houses to the left, whilst another dog barked almost constantly in a house to the right."|"Brother's Ruin"|"Emma Newman"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"The local clock tower chimed eleven o’clock and she listened to the different tones of the bells ringing out across the city, forming its own beautiful harmony. She wondered which magus was responsible for that tower and whether the baker’s son would specialise in clocks and fine machinery once he was tested. Perhaps one day he would be responsible for timepieces across the city, as the most powerful magi were, able to work the magic necessary to keep perfect time across disparate devices. She sighed, wondering where the poor boy was now and whether his mother would be able to cope without him."|"Brother's Ruin"|"Emma Newman"
12:00|noon|"“But the letter said you need to pay by noon on Friday. Master Judicant said the family would be compensated within seven days but we don’t even know how much it will be!”"|"Brother's Ruin"|"Emma Newman"
00:00|midnight|"Tiptoeing across the backyard, she jumped when the clock towers across the city chimed midnight. They wouldn’t chime again until six o’clock the next day, and she hoped desperately that when they did, she’d be asleep in her own bed, safe once more."|"Brother's Ruin"|"Emma Newman"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"Tiptoeing across the backyard, she jumped when the clock towers across the city chimed midnight. They wouldn’t chime again until six o’clock the next day, and she hoped desperately that when they did, she’d be asleep in her own bed, safe once more."|"Brother's Ruin"|"Emma Newman"
"ap < 09:00"|"just before nine o’clock"|"Each of the magi who had visited the day before had a scheduled time to come to test Ben, with Magus Ainsworth first on the list. She arrived just before nine o’clock, carrying a small black leather case, and after a polite round of good mornings, Master Judicant ushered her and Ben into the dining room."|"Brother's Ruin"|"Emma Newman"
"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"CHARLOTTE HELD UP THE candle to the mechanism, still panting from the exertion of lifting it out of the space below the cell and clicking it into place so it didn’t retract once more. It was long past midnight and she was shaking with fear, but she had to do this. She couldn’t let her father die."|"Brother's Ruin"|"Emma Newman"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"The clock towers chimed six o’clock and Ben stretched. “We will all sleep better tonight, I wager.”"|"Brother's Ruin"|"Emma Newman"
