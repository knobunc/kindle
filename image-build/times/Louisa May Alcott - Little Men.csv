"ap 03:00"|"three o'clock"|"When the church–goers came back and dinner was over, every one read, wrote letters home, said their Sunday lessons, or talked quietly to one another, sitting here and there about the house. At three o'clock the entire family turned out to walk, for all the active young bodies must have exercise; and in these walks the active young minds were taught to see and love the providence of God in the beautiful miracles which Nature was working before their eyes. Mr. Bhaer always went with them, and in his simple, fatherly way, found for his flock, ""Sermons in stones, books in the running brooks, and good in everything."""|"Little Men"|"Louisa May Alcott"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o'clock"|"Thanks to these attentions, she got through the afternoon, went early to bed, and next morning did her lessons with an energy which made Uncle Fritz wish that a new game could be invented every day. Quite a thrill pervaded the school–room when Daisy was dismissed at eleven o'clock, for everyone knew that now she was going to have the new and mysterious play."|"Little Men"|"Louisa May Alcott"
"ap 05:00"|"five o'clock"|"Daisy wanted to begin again the minute dinner was done, but she was only allowed to clear up, fill the kettle ready for tea, and wash out her apron, which looked as if she had a Christmas feast. She was then sent out to play till five o'clock, for Uncle Fritz said that too much study, even at cooking stoves, was bad for little minds and bodies, and Aunt Jo knew by long experience how soon new toys lose their charm if they are not prudently used."|"Little Men"|"Louisa May Alcott"
"ap 05:00"|five|"Everyone was very kind to Daisy that afternoon. Tommy promised her the first fruits of his garden, though the only visible crop just then was pigweed; Nat offered to supply her with wood, free of charge; Stuffy quite worshipped her; Ned immediately fell to work on a little refrigerator for her kitchen; and Demi, with a punctuality beautiful to see in one so young, escorted her to the nursery just as the clock struck five. It was not time for the party to begin, but he begged so hard to come in and help that he was allowed privileges few visitors enjoy, for he kindled the fire, ran errands, and watched the progress of his supper with intense interest. Mrs.Â Jo directed the affair as she came and went, being very busy putting up clean curtains all over the house."|"Little Men"|"Louisa May Alcott"
"ap 05:00"|"five o'clock"|"Her first remark in the morning was ""Has my box come?"" and when told that it would arrive sometime during the day, she fretted and fumed, and whipped her doll, till Daisy was shocked. She managed to exist, however, till five o'clock, when she disappeared, and was not missed till supper–time, because those at home thought she had gone to the hill with Tommy and Demi."|"Little Men"|"Louisa May Alcott"
"ap 02:00"|"two o'clock"|"""A sackerryfice,"" answered Demi, solemnly. ""There must be a fire behind the big rock at two o'clock, and we must all bring the things we like best, and burn them!"" he added, with an awful emphasis on the last words."|"Little Men"|"Louisa May Alcott"
"ap 03:00"|"three o'clock"|"""Mrs.Â Shakespeare Smith would like to have Mr.Â John Brooke, Mr.Â Thomas Bangs, and Mr.Â Nathaniel Blake to come to her ball at three o'clock today."""|"Little Men"|"Louisa May Alcott"
12:00|noon|"The others gave in very soon, and longed to be friends, for now there was no Daisy to pet and cook for them; no Nan to amuse and doctor them; and, worst of all, no Mrs. Jo to make home life pleasant and life easy for them. To their great affliction, Mrs. Jo seemed to consider herself one of the offended girls, for she hardly spoke to the outcasts, looked as if she did not see them when she passed, and was always too busy now to attend to their requests. This sudden and entire exile from favor cast a gloom over their souls, for when Mother Bhaer deserted them, their sun had set at noon–day, as it were, and they had no refuge left."|"Little Men"|"Louisa May Alcott"
"ap > 10:00"|"past ten"|"By and by he fell asleep, the lads trooped up to bed, the house grew still, and nothing but the chirp of the crickets broke the soft silence of the summer night. Mrs. Bhaer sat sewing, for the big basket was always piled with socks, full of portentous holes, and thinking of the lost boy. She had decided that baby had been mistaken, and did not even disturb Mr. Bhaer by telling him of the child's fancy, for the poor man got little time to himself till the boys were abed, and he was busy writing letters. It was past ten when she rose to shut up the house. As she paused a minute to enjoy the lovely scene from the steps, something white caught her eye on one of the hay–cocks scattered over the lawn. The children had been playing there all the afternoon, and, fancying that Nan had left her hat as usual, Mrs. Bhaer went out to get it. But as she approached, she saw that it was neither hat nor handkerchief, but a shirt sleeve with a brown hand sticking out of it. She hurried round the hay–cock, and there lay Dan, fast asleep."|"Little Men"|"Louisa May Alcott"
"< 12:00"|"near noon"|"The day was Sunday, and the house so still that he never waked till near noon, and, looking round him, saw an eager little face peering in at the door. He held out his arms, and Teddy tore across the room to cast himself bodily upon the bed, shouting, ""My Danny's tum!"" as he hugged and wriggled with delight. Mrs.Â Bhaer appeared next, bringing breakfast, and never seeming to see how shamefaced Dan looked at the memory of the little scene last night. Teddy insisted on giving him his ""betfus,"" and fed him like a baby, which, as he was not very hungry, Dan enjoyed very much."|"Little Men"|"Louisa May Alcott"
"ap 05:00"|"five o'clock"|"Silas was just driving away in the hay–cart, but turned back, and agreed at once, when Mrs. Jo proposed that he should take the whole party to the pasture, and go for them at five o'clock."|"Little Men"|"Louisa May Alcott"
"ap 05:00"|"five o'clock"|"""Yes, and Daisy and Nan must take good care of you. Be at the bars at five o'clock, and Silas will come for you all."""|"Little Men"|"Louisa May Alcott"
"ap 05:00"|five|"While the children were sleeping, peacefully lulled by the drowsy hum of many neighborly mosquitoes, the family at home were in a great state of agitation. The hay–cart came at five, and all but Jack, Emil, Nan, and Rob were at the bars ready for it. Franz drove instead of Silas, and when the boys told him that the others were going home through the wood, he said, looking ill–pleased, ""They ought to have left Rob to ride, he will be tired out by the long walk."""|"Little Men"|"Louisa May Alcott"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o'clock"|"""It is ten o'clock; into bed, every man of you,"" said Mr.Â Bhaer, looking at his watch."|"Little Men"|"Louisa May Alcott"
12:00|noon|"""That's my kind little son! Yes, pull out the table, and get a chair;"" and Mrs.Â Jo hurried away to quell the ardor of the others, who were always in a raging state of hunger at noon."|"Little Men"|"Louisa May Alcott"
"ap 03:00"|"three o'clock"|"""Hurry up, boys, it's three o'clock, and Uncle Fritz likes us to be punctual, you know,"" said Franz one Wednesday afternoon as a bell rang, and a stream of literary–looking young gentlemen with books and paper in their hands were seen going toward the museum."|"Little Men"|"Louisa May Alcott"
"ap 02:00"|"two o'clock"|"Rob fell to work and the ground was cleared before two o'clock, the nuts safely in the corn–barn loft, and the weary workers exulted in their success. But Frisky and his wife were not to be vanquished so easily; and when Rob went up to look at his nuts a few days later he was amazed to see how many had vanished. None of the boys could have stolen them, because the door had been locked; the doves could not have eaten them, and there were no rats about. There was great lamentation among the young Bhaers till Dick said,"|"Little Men"|"Louisa May Alcott"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"""It's only ten, but your father is ill, and we must go to him. O my little John! my poor little John!"" and Aunt Jo laid her head down on the pillow with a sob that scared sleep from Demi's eyes and filled his heart with fear and wonder; for he dimly felt why Aunt Jo called him ""John,"" and wept over him as if some loss had come that left him poor. He clung to her without a word, and in a minute she was quite steady again, and said, with a tender kiss as she saw his troubled face,"|"Little Men"|"Louisa May Alcott"
"ap 10:00"|"Ten o'clock"|"None of the boys but Franz and Emil knew what had happened, and when they came down next morning, great was their wonderment and discomfort, for the house seemed forlorn without its master and mistress. Breakfast was a dismal meal with no cheery Mrs. Jo behind the teapots; and when school–time came, Father Bhaer's place was empty. They wandered about in a disconsolate kind of way for an hour, waiting for news and hoping it would be all right with Demi's father, for good John Brooke was much beloved by the boys. Ten o'clock came, and no one arrived to relieve their anxiety. They did not feel like playing, yet the time dragged heavily, and they sat about listless and sober. All at once, Franz got up, and said, in his persuasive way,"|"Little Men"|"Louisa May Alcott"
