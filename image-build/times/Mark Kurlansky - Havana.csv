You could stay out all night in Havana. Many did. But once the cannon fired, no one could enter or leave the city until morning. Today there is no more wall, no more gates, but the cannon at the harbor entrance is still fired at nine o’clock every night by a contingent of soldiers in eighteenth-century uniforms, accompanied by a drum roll, to remind people of how insular life in the capital still is."|Havana|"Mark Kurlansky"

"ap 05:00"|five|"The Malecón completely changed Havana’s perspective. Until its construction, Havana was a city on the bay. Once the Malecón was built, Habaneros turned their heads from the bay to the ocean. Havana became a city on the sea, on the Atlantic, the Straits, facing the Gulf Stream—the city to which Hemingway was drawn. The Malecón is still a favorite spot—the place to go fishing, the place for lovers to walk along while listening to a rumbling sea or to embrace in the shadows, the place to pick out a tune on a guitar at night, the only place in Havana with Atlantic breezes on a relentlessly broiling day, the place to cool off at nighttime, the place to take refuge behind the endless columns of the buildings along the boulevard, the place to face the sea where the ocean runs a bit wild and whitecaps lap and splash over the edge of the road. It was thrilling to drive past the waves. As Cabrera Infante wrote in his novel Three Trapped Tigers, “I’m only saying for the benefit of those who have never traveled in a convertible along the Malecón between five and seven in the afternoon or rather evening on August 11, 1958, at sixty or eighty miles an hour: such privilege, such exaltation, such euphoria . . .”"|Havana|"Mark Kurlansky"

"ap 10:00"|ten|"My first reaction was one of awe. How did they know I had fallen asleep on Fidel? The piece of paper ordered me, in extremely rude language—Cuban authorities are generally very polite to American journalists—to report to the ministry at ten the following morning. I quickly realized that this was not about falling asleep on Fidel, but I never found out what it was about. When I arrived at the ministry the next morning, a polite man in uniform asked to see my return ticket. As it happened, I was leaving the next day. He shook my hand warmly and wished me a good flight."|Havana|"Mark Kurlansky"
"ap 03:10"|3:10|"Jews have a long history in Cuba, and particularly in Havana—especially long if it is true, as is believed, that Columbus’s crew included Jews escaping Spanish persecution and passing themselves off as Christians. In Havana, Jews are called polacos. Nobody knows why, since the name appears to predate immigration from Poland and the community has always had a large Sephardic component from Brazil and Turkey, among other places. Nobody knows why Americans are called yumas, either. Some Americans suggest it is from the 1957 Van Heflin/Glenn Ford film 3:10 to Yuma, based on an Elmore Leonard story, but I have never met anyone in Havana who has even heard of this movie. Then, too, why are all Spaniards in Cuba called gallegos, meaning the people who come from Spain’s northwest province of Galicia, when gallegos are only one of several Iberian populations on the island? And why are Italians amicis? And why is a blonde woman a negrita, though she is the opposite? All of these have come about for the same reason: Habaneros love nicknames, and they use them without rancor, prejudice, or logic."|Havana|"Mark Kurlansky"
