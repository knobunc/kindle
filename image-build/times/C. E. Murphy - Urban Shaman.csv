17:50|"5:50 p.m."|"The plane had been descending for a while now, and I squinted at my heavy black wristwatch. The bright orange button for changing the time had become permanently depressed in Moscow, or maybe Venice. Probably Moscow; I’d found Moscow depressing, and saw no reason why the watch shouldn’t. It claimed it was 5:50 p.m., which meant it was almost seven in the morning. I frowned out the window, trying to find the horizon. The sky wasn’t turning gray yet, not flying into Seattle three days after New Year’s. I blinked at the darkness, trying to unglue my contacts again."|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"

"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"“Don’t ma’am me…” I stared at his chest until my eyes focused enough to read his name badge. “Steve. Is that your name? Steve. Don’t ma’am me, Captain Steve. I just need to know our rate of descent. Humor me, Captain Steve. I work for the police department. You don’t want me to go to the six o’clock news after a murder’s been discovered and tell them all about how the airline wouldn’t lift a finger to help the woman who died.”"|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"
"ap ~ 04:11"|"’Bout four eleven"|"“’Bout four eleven, blond hair, brown eyes, petite. You gotta be at least a foot taller than she was.”"|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"
"~ 07:00"|"about seven this morning"|"People kept saying that. I took a breath to respond and realized I didn’t feel like I needed to throw up anymore. The twist of sickness in my belly had disipated. My shoulders dropped and I let the breath go in a sigh. I wasn’t a fan of my innards guiding my actions. Now all I had to do was explain myself so I could go get fired and go home to sleep. “At about seven this morning. I was flying in from Dublin.” As if that had anything to do with anything. “I saw you running, and something was after you. Dogs, or something. And a guy with a knife.” I looked at the knife I was still holding. “This knife? How’d you get past him? How’d you get away from the dogs?”"|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"
"ap ~ 08:00"|"about eight"|"“I’m sorry,” she said. “I was about eight when I figured out being taken at face value meant people were going to let me get by on my looks. If I’d had a different family I’d never have learned to think at all. Why would I need to?” The way she said it made me think she’d used her looks just as much as she’d used her brain to get where she was in life. There are beautiful people who know they’re beautiful, and use it like a weapon. I got the impression Marie used it as a tool. I couldn’t blame her."|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"
"ap 07:30"|Seven-thirty|"“Seven-thirty.” He crouched; I could tell by the location of his voice."|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"
"ap 07:30"|Seven-thirty|"“Yep. Seven-thirty. We’re supposed to meet Marie in half an hour at her place.” Gary straightened up again. I got my other eye open, and blinked tearfully at him."|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"
"ap 01:21"|"one twenty-one"|"Marie lived barely ten minutes from me. My all-day nap had evidently made a dent, or at least I’d caught another wind, because I took the stairs up to her condo two at a time, leaving Gary behind. “She said it’d be open,” he called as I looked both ways down the hall. “Number one twenty-one.” I took an arbitrary left as Gary caught up, found Marie’s door and did a staccato rap before pushing it open."|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"
"ap 02:00"|two|"Gary had an all-day alibi; he’d been at work until two, then at a senior’s poker game until he came to wake me up. I had no alibi at all. A cop I didn’t know questioned me for over an hour. He kept getting hung up on the fact that I’d seen Marie from a plane in the first place. Everybody was having trouble with that idea. I made a mental note not to play Rescue Chick from the air again."|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"
"ap 02:00"|two|"“No fair having all the fun without me. My shift ends at two. I’ll see you then, maybe.”"|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"

Wednesday, January 5th, 12:30 a.m.
"|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"
"ap 07:30"|seven-thirty|"It was seven-thirty and I’d woken up to a still-dark sky before I remembered that it was January and there were no leaves on anything but the evergreens."|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"
08:30|"8:30 a.m."|"
Wednesday, January 5th, 8:30 a.m.
"|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"“Not much. Shift change is at eleven, right? It’s ten-thirty. I can be all perky and on time. Listen to me, Billy. These five murders in the past couple weeks, they were all shamans.” I pushed my fingertip against the files. My knuckle turned white."|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"
"ap 10:30"|ten-thirty|"“Not much. Shift change is at eleven, right? It’s ten-thirty. I can be all perky and on time. Listen to me, Billy.

"ap 10:55"|"five minutes to eleven"|"I turned up at Morrison’s door, still carrying my hot chocolate, at five minutes to eleven. He stared at me like he’d never seen me before. “You didn’t tell me when my shift started,” I said with all the aplomb I could manage."|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"“I don’t care if it does. I have to listen to them having kinky sex at two in the morning. They can listen to my drum at two in the afternoon.”"|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"
14:00|"two in the afternoon"|"“I don’t care if it does. I have to listen to them having kinky sex at two in the morning. They can listen to my drum at two in the afternoon.”"|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"
"ap ~ 00:00"|"about twelve"|"I was in a good enough mood that the question didn’t even piss me off. I turned around and leaned on the counter while the coffeepot started up and looked for a place to start. Some of the good humor fell away, but not enough to make me clam up. “I was about twelve when I told my dad we were going to choose one place to live and stay there until I was out of high school. My whole life we’d been picking up every three or four months and going somewhere new and I was sick of it. He looked at me like he’d never seen me before and the next time we got in the car we drove to North Carolina, where he’d grown up. Eastern Cherokee Nation.”"|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"

Wednesday, January 5th, 3:35 p.m.
"|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"
"ap ~ 06:01"|"About six-one"|"“About six-one, mid-thirties, Caucasian, long light brown hair, green eyes, big shoulders but overall a slender build, carries a very sharp knife.”"|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"“Can’t. The ten o’clock news just came on. You might want to get out of here before Morrison gets back.”"|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"
23:00|"eleven at night"|"I grunted and sent the message, then fidgeted impatiently for several minutes, hoping for a reply. “It’s eleven at night,” Gary finally said. “He’s probably in bed.”"|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"
"ap ~ 05:15"|"around a quarter after five"|"“Don’t count on it. I’ll be by around a quarter after five,” he reminded me. “Lock the door.” I nodded and followed him to the door to lock it behind him, then stood there for a full minute, waiting for another shoe to drop."|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"
00:00|midnight|"I got an overpriced but surprisingly good hamburger, and a cup of too-hot coffee. I took my bounty and found a table by a window, where I could watch the midnight international flights take off in the distance while I gnoshed on my burger."|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"
"ap 01:15"|one-fifteen|"A knot of certainty tied itself in my stomach. If Cernunnos were uninjured, all the Hunt would be gaining on me now. I pressed on the gas pedal and Petite responded with an urgent hum of power as she accelerated. I wasn’t surprised that the riderless horse still gained on me. I topped out at one-fifteen, more out of respect for my poor abused car than being unable to push her faster, and watched the pale horse put on a surge of speed that brought it to my side."|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"

"|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"
06:00|"six in the morning"|"I went through two more cups of coffee waiting for an answer, before slowly cluing in to the fact that it was going on six in the morning and no one in his right mind would be up, much less checking e-mail. Unless he was on the East Coast, in which case it was a perfectly reasonable time to be up. The more that I thought about it, the more logical it seemed that the artist was not only farther east than I was, but was in fact probably in Ireland itself, which meant it was nearly two in the afternoon and why the hell hadn’t he answered my e-mail yet? Did he want me to die?"|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"

12:00|noon|"Oh, God. I’d forgotten. “Yeah, but call me before you leave work, or I’ll probably sleep through it. It’s gonna be a late night.” I just couldn’t fathom being lucky enough to wrap this whole mess up by noon. It was a nice thought, though."|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"
"ap 10:30"|ten-thirty|"I managed a weak smile. “Thus getting me out of here before Morrison sees me? Yeah. Around the corner?”
Jen nodded. “Yeah. Make it ten-thirty. Do you have a cell phone?”
I shook my head. “I’ll call around ten-fifteen to make sure we’re still on.”"|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"
05:00|"five o’clock this morning"|"He glared at me, which seemed to restore his equilibrium. “Do you have an alibi for five o’clock this morning?”"|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"
05:00|"five in the morning"|"I sat down.
“What was Mr. Muldoon doing at your house at five in the morning?”
“Do you want to know professionally or personally, Morrison?” Sarcasm seemed like a good way out of bewilderment."|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"I dropped my voice half an octave. “This is Special Investigator Joanne Walker, reporting for Tabloid TV. I’ve learned that at the heart of a series of bloody murders is an ancient Celtic god and his estranged son. Tune in at eleven tonight for more.”"|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"
"ap 10:05"|"five after ten"|"I glanced at a clock; it was five after ten. “Yeah, well, the world just came to an end.”"|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"
00:00|midnight|"I studied the wall on the opposite side of the parking lot, not really seeing it. I’d been running on adrenaline and impulse for days now. There were fourteen hours until midnight, so no matter what, this thing was almost over. The idea of uninterrupted sleep was nice, but I’d already spent way too much time reacting instead of proacting. I needed to think. The concrete wall across from me, however, seemed to be inspiring very little other than a pleasant pale haze in my mind."|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"
00:00|midnight|"I didn’t know why I was assuming whatever was going to happen would happen at midnight rather than, oh, noon, or an even more civilized four in the afternoon. Midnight was just very dramatic."|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"
12:00|noon|"I didn’t know why I was assuming whatever was going to happen would happen at midnight rather than, oh, noon, or an even more civilized four in the afternoon. Midnight was just very dramatic."|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"

"ap 05:10"|"ten after five"|"“Yeah, until three or four. Then I got up at ten after five, or something. It’s been a rough few days.” I cringed a little. I had nothing to complain about, comparatively."|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"
00:00|midnight|"“You are not dead yet.” Cernunnos hit the surface of space with the palm of his hand. Another shock of waves splattered the dais with a few drops of midnight. “Nor do I think that you are at the moment dying, though certainly your mortal body is injured.”"|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"
"ap 02:00"|two|"“A drum is an emergency?” Keith mumbled, but I could hear the tap of a keyboard as he took the message down. “Joanne, get drum, police station. He gets off work at two.”"|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"
"ap 01:57"|"three minutes to two"|"I looked for a clock. It was three minutes to two. “I hope you can catch him, then. Thank you. I really appreciate it.”"|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"
"ap ~ 02:40"|"’Bout two-forty"|"“’Bout two-forty. I got here fifteen minutes ago but they sent me for coffee. Said you needed the sleep and the caffeine. Some little Spanish lady has some papers for you.”"|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"
18:00|"six at night"|"“I ain’t never seen this place empty,” Gary announced.
“Me either,” I said nervously. “Especially not at six at night.”
“Is there some kinda construction going on?” Gary shifted his shoulders. I shook my head, climbing out of the cab. Hairs on my arms stood up, even under my jacket, and I rubbed them briskly."|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"
"ap 06:07"|six-oh-seven|"“Cernunnos is going to kill Suzanne at six-oh-seven. I may be busy. Stop him.”"|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"
"ap 06:07"|six-oh-seven|"“Cernunnos is going to kill Suzanne at six-oh-seven. I may be busy. Stop him.”
Gary lifted a bushy eyebrow at me. “At six-oh-seven?”
“It’s when she was born,” I said softly. “Her soul and the Rider’s will be irrevocably bound at that moment. If he destroys her, he destroys the thing that keeps him from riding free.”"|"Urban Shaman"|"C. E. Murphy"
