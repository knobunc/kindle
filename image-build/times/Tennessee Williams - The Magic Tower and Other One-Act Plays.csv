It may be seen why when a spotlight reveals a section of stage to represent the corner of an antiquated living room. A middle-aged woman in a dingy wrapper is seated stoically on a red-plush sofa. Beside her is a table supporting a red-globed oil lamp with a fringe of glass pendants. The outside door and a window are in the right wall; inner door to the left. There is an oval mirror, gilt-framed, and a large “glamour photo” of Gloria La Greene. (This is her stage name. Her real name is Bessie.)"|"The Magic Tower and Other One-Act Plays"|"Tennessee Williams"

She is amazingly slight, like a tiny mandarin, enveloped in the ruins of a once gorgeously-flowered Japanese silk kimono. As she prepares the hot milk for Moony, she pads about the kitchen in a pair of men’s felt bedroom slippers, which she has a hard time keeping on her small feet. She squeezes the kimono tight about her chest, and shivers. Coughs once or twice, glances irritably at the alarm clock on window-sill, which says nearly four o’clock in the morning. Jane is still young, but her pretty, small-featured face has a yellowish, unhealthy look.

"ap 05:55"|"five of six"|"AMANDA: I was carrying jonquils the very first afternoon that I met your father. However it wouldn’t be fair to blame that on the flowers. The Cutrere boy had driven me over to Clarksdale to see old Agnes Hoskins who’d just had another stroke and couldn’t talk. It depressed me so to see her in that condition, but on the way back we passed this field of jonquils, literally thousands of them. I made Dave stop the car, and I got out and gathered my two arms full. Dave was annoyed because I wouldn’t put them down in the back seat of the car. I used them for a shield when he tried to kiss me. I didn’t care to be kissed by Dave Cutrere! [She laughs archly.] But when I got home and entered the downstairs hall, still carrying all those jonquils in my arms—Well, there was your father, discovered for the first time, installing a telephone at the foot of the stairs. How much better it would have been if—! [She crosses downstage to Laura.] Still—I wouldn’t have had a daughter as pretty as you! If I hadn’t married that telephone man, who fell in love with long-distance. That hem’s a little uneven—hardly noticeable though, I’ll leave it alone. I’ve got to mix the dressing for the salmon and change myself and it’s already five of six. Laura, you’re almost as pretty as I used to be. It’s early for white, but white’s so lovely on you. You’re so slender, Laura. It’s better to start out slender, for life does put flesh on you. I’m very lucky that I can still wear misses. Turn around. Yes—it dips a little but men don’t notice such things. You’ve never looked so pretty and maybe you’ll never look so pretty again. So be on your best behavior; for once come out of the shell— Vivacity counts for so much!"|"The Magic Tower and Other One-Act Plays"|"Tennessee Williams"

"ap 05:00"|five|"MYRTLE: I can’t stay inside all day. I guess I live a strange life, I don’t know how to describe it. Each new city I got to, I find a girl-friend to bum around town with. When I wake up I call her or she calls me, and if we’re not working, or get off work at five, we make a date to meet somewhere and just, just—kill time together. No special plan, you know. We eat together and go to a movie and wind up in some bar we’re used to, and always meet a man or a couple of men there. What’s strange about my life is each day is like the day before or the next day. Just killing time, no change except time going. It begun to scare me, the way the days and nights all seemed like one day and night gone over and over and over. So, then I met Lot in a drugstore in downtown Memphis. He was looking through movie magazines on the magazine rack in that Walgreen’s. We struck up a conversation. He looked like a kid, my girlfriend Georgia said I was robbing the cradle. Well, I have this maternal chord in me and he touched it. It was my birthday. I don’t suppose it would have happened except on my birthday. My birthday reminded me how long I’d been just wand’ring around on the loose, each day like the other and no change in the future except time passing me by. I was scared. And Lot touched this maternal chord in me. So I took Lot home to my place and he spent the night with me, slept in my arms like a baby.—When he woke up he said to me, “Let’s get married.” At first I laughed, it seemed ridiculous to me. But then I thought, oh, well, as the fellow says, there’s a hell of a lot more to this business of sex than two people jumping up and down on each other’s eggs."|"The Magic Tower and Other One-Act Plays"|"Tennessee Williams"

"~ 19:40"|"about 1940"|"This is one of many early plays that show the overt influence that movies of the 1930s had on Williams. Other examples include Fugitive Kind, Not About Nightingales, Honor the Living, The Palooka, In Our Profession, Every Twenty Minutes, The Pink Bedroom, The Magic Tower, and The Big Game. According to the Internet Movie Database (IMDb), Hollywood released nearly fifty gangster films in 1935 alone, and over a dozen of those with plots involving a “squealer.” Williams dropped mob crime as subject matter from about 1940 until the 1970s when it appeared again in I Never Get Dressed Till After Dark on Sundays, Vieux Carré, and Something Cloudy, Something Clear."|"The Magic Tower and Other One-Act Plays"|"Tennessee Williams"
03:00|"Three in the Morning"|"According to biographer Lyle Leverich, the earliest known play by Tennessee Williams is Beauty is the Word, written in 1930 for an annual one-act play contest at the University of Missouri. Williams’s second attempt, Hot Milk at Three in the Morning, written in 1932 for the same annual contest, bears a strong connection to Eugene O’Neill’s one-act Before Breakfast. In 1934, Williams began rewriting Hot Milk as Moony’s Kid Don’t Cry."|"The Magic Tower and Other One-Act Plays"|"Tennessee Williams"
