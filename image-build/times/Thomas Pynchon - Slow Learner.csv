Picnic got up from where he was sitting and headed for the Coke machine. “Someplace out by Lake Charles,” he said. “They had a storm or something. Lines are down.” He put a nickel in and as usual nothing happened. “Bravo company to the rescue.” His voice became soothing, caressing. “Come on, bebi,” he said to the Coke machine and kicked it viciously. Nothing happened. “Be careful you don’t tilt it,” Baxter said. Picnic hammered on the machine in certain carefully selected spots. Something clicked and two streams, one of carbonated water and one of Coke syrup, began to flow out. Just before they shut off, an empty cup dropped down and got covered on the outside with syrup. “Oh god, you’re cute,” Picnic said. “It’s neurotic,” Rizzo said. “The heat has driven it crazy.” They talked for a while, speculating and cursing the Cajuns and the army, smoking and drinking Cokes, till finally Levine stood up and put his hands in his pockets letting his gut bulge out. “Well,” he said, “I reckon I’ll go pack.”"|"Slow Learner"|"Thomas Pynchon"

"ap 04:30"|4:30|"The lieutenant looked up. “Having trouble about the trucks?” he said. Levine scratched his stomach and tilted the helmet liner back on his head. “Not exactly,” he said, “but my leave starts at 4:30 and I was figuring.” Pierce dropped the fork he was holding. It hit the tray with a loud clank. “No,” he said, “you’ll have to wait awhile on that leave, Levine.” Levine smiled a big loose idiot’s smile that he knew got on the lieutenant’s nerves. “Hell,” he said, “since when am I so indispensable to the company?” Pierce sighed in annoyance. “Look, you know the situation in this company as well as anybody. And the order says specialists, ace specialists. Unfortunately we don’t have any. But you have to do, slobs like you are all we have.” Pierce was ROTC, a graduate of MIT. He had just made first lieutenant and was trying hard not to feel his power. When he spoke it was with a precise, dry Beacon Hill accent. “Lieutenant,” Levine said, “you were young once. I got this broad in N’Orleans, she’s waiting for me. Give youth its day. There’s hundreds of specialists better than me.” The lieutenant smiled grimly. There was an implicit and mutual recognition of worth between them whenever things like this cropped up. Outwardly neither had any use for the other; but each had the vague sense that they were more alike than either would care to admit, brothers, possibly, under the skin. When Pierce had first arrived at Roach and found out the story on Levine he had tried to talk to him. “You’re wasting yourself, Levine,” he would say. “Here you are, college graduate, highest IQ in the damn battalion, and what are you doing. Sitting here in the most wretched pesthole in the armed forces, on an ass that gets broader every month. Why don’t you go for OCS? You could probably even get into the Point if you wanted. Why did you enlist in the army in the first place?” And Levine would say with a hesitant grin that was neither auite apologetic nor auite scornful, “Well I sort of figured I’d like to stay an enlisted man and make a career out of it.” At first the lieutenant would blow up whenever he said this, get incoherent. Later he would turn and walk away and finally he gave up altogether and gave up talking to Levine. Now he said, “You’re in the army, Levine. Leave isn’t a right, it’s a privilege.” Levine stuck his hands in his back pockets. “Ah,” he said. “Well, okay.”"|"Slow Learner"|"Thomas Pynchon"

They got to the motor pool at a quarter to one and found most of the others already there with six ¾—ton trucks with radio equipment in the back. Levine and Picnic got into a truck, Picnic driving, and followed the other trucks up to the company. At the barracks they got their bags and threw them in back."|"Slow Learner"|"Thomas Pynchon"

I got 382 goddam days. Christ, I’ll never make it.” Levine smiled. “Shucks,” he said, “you’re just bitter, is all.” When they got outside it was raining and cooler.

It was after dark when the two trucks pulled off one of the quiet campus streets onto a huge, grassy quadrangle. “Hey,” Picnic yelled at Baxter, “race you to see who gets ‘em up first.” They set up the 40-foot antennas and Baxter and Rizzo won. “What the hell,” Levine said, “buy you a beer when we get all this junk set up.” Picnic got to work on the TCC-3 and Levine started setting up AN/GRC-10. About midnight they had communications."|"Slow Learner"|"Thomas Pynchon"

Levine stuck his head out and took a look. A hundred yards away, one by one, like giant insects, army helicopters were taking off to see what was left of Creole. “I’ll be damned,” Picnic said. “Last night, they were there all the time.” Levine closed his eyes and settled back. “Nights get pretty dark here,” he said and went back to sleep. He woke up at noon, hungry, his head throbbing. “Picnic,” he groaned, “where the hell do you eat around here.” Picnic snored. “Hey,” Levine grabbed him by the head and shook him. “What,” Picnic said. “I said I wonder if they got field kitchens or something someplace,” Levine said. Rizzo climbed out of his truck and came over. “Christ you guys are lazy,” he said. “We been up since ten.” Out on the quad helicopters were taking off and landing with survivors. Ambulances and a swarm of medics and corpsmen were out there ready for them. Deuce-and-a-halfs and jeeps and ¾’s were parked all over the place and all sorts of army personnel, most of them in fatigues, with here and there a gleam of khaki and a flash of brass, were roaming around. “God,” Levine said, “what hit this place.”"|"Slow Learner"|"Thomas Pynchon"
"ap 05:30"|"half past five"|"The pier was as crowded as the quadrangle had been, but the pace slower, more obviously ordered. The oil company tugs would bring in a bunch of corpses, the work detail would offload them, the corpsmen would spray them with embalming fluid to keep them from falling apart, another detail would load them into deuce-and-a-halfs and the deuce-and-a-halfs would cart them off. “They’re keeping them in some junior high gymnasium,” Douglas informed Levine, “ice all over the place. Having a hell of a time identifying them. Water screws up their faces or something.” The smell of decay hung in the air, like vermouth, it seemed to Levine, after you’d been drinking it all night. The death detail worked precisely, efficiently, like an assembly line. Every once in a while one of the offloaders would turn aside to vomit, but the work flowed on smoothly. Levine and Douglas sat watching them while the sky got darker, losing more of the sun which nobody could see. An old master sergeant came over to them and leaned against the side of the jeep and they talked for a while. “I was in Korea,” he said after one of the bodies had disintegrated from clumsy handling, “I can understand guys shooting at each other, killing each other, but this—“ He shook his head. “Jesus Christ.” There were brass wandering around, but none of them bothered Levine or Douglas. Despite its machine-like efficiency the operation had a certain air of informality: hardly anyone wore hats, a colonel or a major would stop to chat with the corpsmen. “Like combat,” the sergeant said. “All the rules are out. Hell, who needs ‘em anyway.” They stayed till half past five and then drove back. “Where do you find a shower,” Levine said, “or don’t you.” The PFC grinned. “I got a buddy took one in a sorority house last night,” he said. “Damn near anyplace you can find one, I reckon.”"|"Slow Learner"|"Thomas Pynchon"

Outside a small wind had risen, which rattled the flaps of tar paper and blundered baffled and turbulent into and around the jutting corners and irregular angles of the shack. Somehow they started telling sea stories. Pig told about how he and a sonarman named Feeny had stolen a horse-drawn taxi in Barcelona. It turned out neither of them knew anything about horses and they wound up driving full tilt off the end of Fleet Landing, pursued by at least a platoon of Shore Patrolmen. While they were floundering around in the water it occurred to them that this would be a good time to swim out to the carrier Intrepid and stomp hell out of a few airedales. They would have made it had it not been for the Intrepid ‘s motor launch, which caught up with them a few hundred yards out. Feeny managed to throw the coxswain and the bow hook over the side before some wise-assed ensign with a .45 stopped all the fun by shooting Feeny through the shoulder. Flange told about how one spring weekend back in college he and two comrades had swiped a female cadaver from the local morgue. They took it up to Flange’s fraternity about three in the morning and deposited it next to the president of the house, who was lying passed out on his bed. Next morning bright and early all the brothers able to ambulate marched en masse to the president’s room and began banging on the door. “Yes, just a minute,” a voice groaned from inside, “I’ll be right with. Oh. Oh, my god.” “What’s the matter, Vincent?” somebody called. “You got a broad in there?” And they all laughed good-naturedly. About fifteen minutes later Vincent, ashen and trembling, opened up and they all trooped in noisily. They looked under the bed and moved the furniture around and opened the closet, but no corpse. Puzzled, they began pulling out dresser drawers, when suddenly there was a piercing scream from outside. They rushed to the window and looked down. A coed had fainted in the street. It turned out Vincent had knotted together his three best neckties and hung the body outside the window. Pig shook his head. “Wait a minute,” he said. “I thought you were gonna tell a sea story.” By this time they had killed the gallon. Bolingbroke produced a jug of home-made Chianti from under his bed. “I would have,” Flange said, “only I couldn’t think of any offhand.” But the real reason he knew and could not say was that if you are Dennis Flange and if the sea’s tides are the same that not only wash along your veins but also billow through your fantasies then it is all right to listen to but not to tell stories about that sea, because you and the truth of a true lie were thrown sometime way back into a curious contiguity and as long as you are passive you can remain aware of the truth’s extent but the minute you became active you are somehow, if not violating a convention outright, at least screwing up the perspective of things, much as anyone observing subatomic particles changes the works, data and odds, by the act of observing. So he had told the other instead, at random. Or apparently so. He wondered what Geronimo would say."|"Slow Learner"|"Thomas Pynchon"

"ap 01:00"|one|"A low growl sounded behind Porpentine. Goodfellow cringed, smiled weakly, introduced Sir Alastair Wren, Victoria’s father. It became clear almost immediately that he was not fond of Goodfellow. With him was a robust, myopic girl of eleven; the sister. Mildred was in Egypt, she soon informed Porpentine, to gather rock specimens, being daft for rocks in the same way Sir Alastair was for large and ancient pipe-organs. He had toured Germany the previous year, alienating the populations of various cathedral towns by recruiting small boys to toil away half-days at a clip keeping the bellows going: and then underpaying. Frightfully, added Victoria. There was, he continued, no decent pipe-organ anywhere on the African continent (which Porpentine could hardly doubt). Goodfellow mentioned an enthusiasm for the barrel-organ, and had Sir Alastair ever tried his hand at one. The peer growled ominously. Out of the corner of his eye Porpentine saw Count Khevenhüller-Metsch come out of an adjoining room, steering the Russian Vice-Consul by the arm and talking wistfully; M. de Villiers punctuated the conversation with mirthful little barks. Aha, Porpentine thought. Mildred had produced from her reticule a large rock, which she now held up to Porpentine for inspection. She had found it out near the site of the ancient Pharos, it contained trilobite fossils. Porpentine could not respond; it was his old weakness. A bar was set up on the mezzanine; he loped up the marble stairs after promising to bring punch (lemonade, of course, for Mildred)."|"Slow Learner"|"Thomas Pynchon"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"“Indeed,” said Goodfellow. To Porpentine: “At the Gare du Caire. The train leaves at eight.” Porpentine gave them all good night and returned to his pied-à-terre in the Turkish quarter. Such choice of lodgings violated nothing; for he considered the Porte part of the Western World. He fell asleep reading an old and mutilated edition of Antony and Cleopatra and wondering if it were still possible to fall under the spell of Egypt: its tropic unreality, its curious gods."|"Slow Learner"|"Thomas Pynchon"

Across the double line of tracks was a small park, green with palms and acacias. Porpentine kept to the shadow of the station-house. Soon the others arrived. He noticed the tiniest flicker of communication pass between Bongo-Shaftsbury and Lepsius. The morning express pulled in, amid sudden commotion on the platform. Porpentine turned to see Lepsius in pursuit of an Arab, who had apparently stolen his valise. Goodfellow had already gone into action. Sprinting across the platform, blond mane flapping wild, he cornered the Arab in a doorway, took back the valise and surrendered his quarry to a fat policeman in a pith helmet. Lepsius watched him snake-eyed and silent as he handed back the valise."|"Slow Learner"|"Thomas Pynchon"
"ap 08:05"|"five past eight"|"Aboard the train they split up into two adjoining compartments, Victoria, her father, and Goodfellow sharing the one next the rear platform. Porpentine felt that Sir Alastair would have been less miserable in his company, but wanted to be sure of Bongo-Shaftsbury. The train pulled out at five past eight, heading into the sun. Porpentine leaned back and let Mildred ramble on about mineralogy. Bongo-Shaftsbury kept silent until the train had passed Sidi Gaber and swung toward the southeast."|"Slow Learner"|"Thomas Pynchon"
"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"“He felt you might want to get some sleep,” Good-fellow said. “I should have thought. I was preoccupied with Mildred’s sister.” Porpentine snorted, shut his eyes and fell asleep before the train started to move. He awoke half an hour out of Cairo. “All secure,” Goodfellow said. The outlines of the pyramids were visible off to the west. Closer to the city gardens and villas began to appear. The train reached Cairo’s Principal Station about noon."|"Slow Learner"|"Thomas Pynchon"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"That night Porpentine commissioned a cab and roved about the city until early morning. The coded instructions had told them nothing more than to bide time: Good-fellow was taking care of that, having escorted Victoria to an Italian summer-theater performance at the Ezbekiyeh Garden. In the course of the night Porpentine visited a girl who lived in the Quartier Rosetti and was the mistress of a junior clerk in the British Consulate; a jewel merchant in the Muski who had lent financial support to the Mahdists and did not wish now that the movement was crushed to have his sympathies known; a minor Esthetic who had fled England on a narcotics charge to the land of no extradition and who was a distant cousin of the valet to Mr. Raphael Borg, the British Consul; and a pimp named Varkumian who claimed to know every assassin in Cairo. From this fine crew Porpentine returned to his room at three in the morning. But hesitated at the door, having heard movement behind it. Only one thing for it: at the end of the corridor was this window with a ledge outside. He grimaced. But then everyone knew that spies were continually crawling about window-ledges, high above the streets of exotic cities. Feeling an utter fool, Porpentine climbed out and got on the ledge. He looked down: there was a drop of about fifteen feet into some bushes. Yawning he made his way quickly but clumsily toward the corner of the building. The ledge became narrower at the corner. As he stood with each foot on a different side and the edge of the building bisecting him from eyebrows to abdomen he lost his balance and fell. On the way down it occurred to him to use an obscene word; he hit the shrubbery with a crash, rolled, and lay there tapping his fingers. After he had smoked half a cigarette he got to his feet and noticed a tree next his own window, easily climbable. He ascended puffing and cursing; crawled out on a limb, straddled it, and peered inside."|"Slow Learner"|"Thomas Pynchon"
14:00|"two that afternoon"|"At two that afternoon the Consul-General emerged from the front door of the Consulate and entered a carriage. Porpentine watched from a deserted room on the third floor of the Hotel Victoria. Lord Cromer was a perfect target but this vantage at least was unavailable to any hired assassin-in-opposition as long as Porpentine’s friends kept on the alert. The archaeologist had taken Victoria and Mildred to tour the bazaars and the Tombs of the Khalifs. Goodfellow was sitting in a closed landau directly under the window. Unobtrusive (as Porpentine watched) he started off behind the carriage, keeping at a safe distance. Porpentine left the hotel, strolled up Sharia el-Maghrabi. At the next corner he noticed a church off to his right; heard loud organ music. On a sudden whim he entered the church. Sure enough, it was Sir Alastair, booming away. It took the unmusical Porpentine some five minutes to come aware of the devastation Sir Alastair was wreaking on the keys and pedals. Music laced the interior of the tiny, Gothic house with certain intricate veinings, weird petal-shapes. But it was violent and somehow Southern foliage. Head and fingers uncontrollable for a neglect of his daughter’s or any purity, for the music’s own shape, for Bach—was it Bach?—himself? Foreign and a touch shabby, uncomprehending, how could Porpentine say. But was yet unable to pull away until the music stopped abruptly, leaving the church’s cavity to reverberate. Only then did he withdraw unseen out into the sun, adjusting his neck-cloth as if it were all the difference between wholeness and disintegration."|"Slow Learner"|"Thomas Pynchon"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"Lord Cromer was doing nothing to protect himself, Goodfellow reported that night. Porpentine, having rechecked with the valet’s cousin, knew the word had gone through. He shrugged, calling the Consul-General a nitwit; tomorrow was 25 September. He left the hotel at eleven and went by carriage to a Brauhaus a few blocks north of the Ezbekiyeh Garden. He sat alone at a small table against the wall, listening to maudlin accordion music which must surely have been old as Bach; closed his eyes, letting a cigarette droop from his lips. A waitress brought Munich beer."|"Slow Learner"|"Thomas Pynchon"
12:00|noon|"At noon Porpentine visited the kitchen of the Hotel Victoria to find the place in a turmoil. The meeting at Fashoda had taken place. The Situation had turned to a Crisis. Upset, he dashed out into the street, commandeered a carriage, and tore off in search of Goodfellow. He found him two hours later sleeping in his hotel room where Porpentine had left him. In a rage he emptied a pitcher of ice-water over Goodfellow’s head. Bongo-Shaftsbury appeared in the doorway grinning. Porpentine hurled the empty pitcher at him as he vanished down the corridor. “Where’s the Consul-General?” Goodfellow inquired, amiable and sleepy. “Get dressed,” bellowed Porpentine."|"Slow Learner"|"Thomas Pynchon"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"They found the clerk’s mistress lying lazy in a patch of sunlight, peeling a mandarin orange. She told them Cromer was planning to attend the opera at eight. Up to then, she could not say. They went to the shop of the chemist, who had nothing for them. Barreling through the Garden Porpentine asked about the Wrens. They were at Heliopolis, as far as Goodfellow knew. “What the bloody hell is wrong with everyone?” Porpentine wanted to know. “Nobody knows anything.” They could do nothing till eight; so sat in front of a café in the Garden and drank wine. Egypt’s sun beat down, somehow threatening. There was no shade. The fear that had found him night before last now crawled along the flanks of Porpentine’s jaw and up his temples. Even Goodfellow seemed nervous."|"Slow Learner"|"Thomas Pynchon"
"ap 07:45"|"quarter to eight"|"At a quarter to eight they strolled along the path to the theater, purchased tickets in the orchestra, and settled down to wait. Soon the Consul-General’s party arrived and sat near them. Lepsius and Bongo-Shaftsbury drifted in from either side and stationed themselves in boxes; forming, with Lord Cromer as vertex, an angle of 120 degrees. “Bother,” said Goodfellow. “We should have got some elevation.” Four policemen came marching down the center aisle, glanced up at Bongo-Shaftsbury. He pointed to Porpentine. “My Gawd,” Goodfellow moaned. Porpentine closed his eyes. He’d blown it, all right. This was what happened when one blundered right in. The policemen surrounded them, stood at attention. “All right,” Porpentine said. He and Goodfellow arose and were escorted out of the theater. “We shall desire your passports,” one of them said. Behind them on the breeze came the first sprightly chords of the opening scene. They marched down a narrow path, two police behind, two in front. Signals had, of course, been arranged years before. “I shall want to see the British Consul,” Porpentine said and spun, drawing an old single-shot pistol. Goodfellow had the other two covered. The policeman who had asked for their passports glowered. “No one said they would be armed,” another protested. Methodically, with four raps to the skull, the policemen were neutralized and rolled into the underbrush. “A fool trick,” Goodfellow muttered: “we were lucky.” Porpentine was already running back toward the theater. They took the stairs two at a time and searched for an empty box. “Here,” Goodfellow said. They edged into the box. It was almost directly across from Bongo-Shaftsbury’s. That would put them next to Lepsius. “Keep down,” Porpentine said. They crouched, peering between small golden balusters. On stage Edmondo and the students chaffed the Romantic, horny Des Grieux. Bongo-Shaftsbury was checking the action of a small pistol. “Stand by,” Goodfellow whispered. The postilion horn of the diligence was heard. The coach came rattling and creaking into the inn courtyard. Bongo-Shaftsbury raised his pistol. Por-pentine said: “Lepsius. Next door.” Goodfellow withdrew. The diligence bounced to a halt. Porpentine centered his sights on Bongo-Shaftsbury, then let the muzzle drift down and to the right until it pointed at Lord Cromer. It occurred to him that he could end everything for himself right now, never have to worry about Europe again. He had a sick moment of uncertainty. Now how serious had anyone ever been? Was aping Bongo-Shaftsbury’s tactics any less real than opposing them? Like a bloody grouse, Goodfellow had said. Manon was helped down from the coach. Des Grieux gaped, was transfixed, read his destiny on her eyes. Someone was standing behind Porpentine. He glanced back, quickly in that moment of hopeless love, and saw Moldweorp there looking decayed, incredibly old, face set in a hideous though compassionate smile. Panicking, Porpentine turned and fired blindly, perhaps at Bongo-Shaftsbury, perhaps at Lord Cromer. He could not see and would never be sure which one he had intended as target. Bongo-Shaftsbury shoved the pistol inside his coat and disappeared. A fight was on out in the corridor. Porpentine pushed the old man aside and ran out in time to see Lepsius tear away from Goodfellow and flee toward the stairs. “Please, dear fellow,” Moldweorp gasped. “Don’t go after them. You are outnumbered.” Porpentine had reached the top step. “Three to two,” he muttered."|"Slow Learner"|"Thomas Pynchon"

Grover was never on time himself, but he always wanted other people to be. “Punctuality,” he would declaim, rolling the word at you like an invincible purey, “is not one of your salient virtues.” All you had to say to him then was “Huh?” and he’d forget it and get down to business. One of the reasons Tim liked him."|"Slow Learner"|"Thomas Pynchon"
10:00|"ten in the morning"|"“No, I was in during Korea. Only I stayed Stateside all through it. I was in this band—army band, you know—at Fort Ord, California. All around there, up in the hills around Monterey, you have these little bars; anybody can just walk in, if they want to, and start playing. You have a lot of union guys, used to play around L.A.—you know—they get drafted and sent to Ord. Guys been in studio bands, most of them, so you’re sitting in with some fine talent, a lot of times. One night we’re in this kind of a roadhouse, four of us, and we’re playing, and it’s sounding pretty good. We’re all juiced a little, drinking wine, there’s a lot of wine—you know—from over in that valley there, whatever you call it. We just drinking wine and doing some—oh, some blues or something—and this lady comes in. White lady. Kind that sits out by the swimming pool and drinks cocktails at cocktail parties—right?—yeah. You got it. She’s a very stout lady, not big fat, just stout, and she says she wants us to come play at a party she’s having. So it’s like a Tuesday or a Wednesday and we all kind of curious as to how come she’s having a party such a funny time of the week, well she says it’s been going on since the weekend—nonstop, you know—and we come to find out when we get there she’s not putting nobody on, man. There it is—whooping, hollering, you can hear it for a mile. This baritone sax, some Italian kid, Sheldon somebody, he not halfway in the door there’s two or three little chicks all over him, telling him—well, never mind about that—but we set up and get going, and the juice keeps coming on like a bucket brigade, people keep handing it up to you. You know what it is? Champagne. Solid champagne. All night long we drink this stuff, and about the time the sun comes up everybody’s passed out, and we quit playing. I lay down next to the drums and go to sleep. Next thing I know I hear this girl, and she’s laughing. I get up, the sun’s in my eyes, it’s only about nine or ten in the morning. I ought to feel horrible, man, but I feel great. I go walking out on this kind of little terrace, it’s cold and outside there’s fog, not all the way down to the ground, just hiding the tops of the trees, pine trees I guess, the trunks are these—you know—very straight. There’s this white fog and downhill there’s the ocean. Pacific Ocean, and from up the coast you can even hear that artillery practice back at Ord, wrapped up in the fog, whoomp, whoomp. That’s how quiet it is. I go on out by the swimming pool, still wondering about this chick I heard laughing, all of a sudden here comes old Sheldon, running out around a corner, with this girl chasing him, and he slams into me, and the girl can’t stop in time neither, and we all three of us fall in the pool with all our clothes on. And all I had to do was swallow a little bit of that water and you know what? I’m high all over again, just as high as I was during the night, on all that champagne. How about that?”"|"Slow Learner"|"Thomas Pynchon"
"ap 06:50"|six-fifty|"“There he is,” said Mr. McAfee. In the door, which had been ajar, now appeared Beto Cufifo, the bellboy and town rum-dum, who would have been retired and living on Social Security except that he was Mexican and wanted back there for something like smuggling or auto theft—the charge varied depending on who he was telling it to. How he had first found his way into Berkshire County nobody would ever know. People were always mistaking him for the only kinds of probable outlander—French Canadian or Italian—and you felt he enjoyed that easy ambiguity and that’s why he stuck around Mingeborough.
“One bottle of booze,” Beto announced. “That’s six-fifty.”
“What is it, six-fifty, imported from someplace?” Mr. McAfee said. He had out his wallet and snuck a quick look inside. Tim could only see one bill, a single."|"Slow Learner"|"Thomas Pynchon"
