00:00|midnight|"Fadi, a tall, broad-shouldered man, possessed a decidedly charismatic demeanor. When he spoke, everyone in his presence fell silent. He had a handsome, powerful face, the color of his skin deepened further by desert sun and mountain wind. His beard and hair were long and curling, the inky color of a starless midnight. His lips were full and wide. When he smiled the sun seemed to have come down from its place in the heavens to shine directly on his disciples. For Fadi’s avowed mission was messianic in nature: to bring hope where there was no hope, to slaughter the thousands that made up the Saudi royal family, to wipe their abomination off the face of the earth, to free his people, to distribute the obscene wealth of the despots, to restore the rightful order to his beloved Arabia. To begin, he knew, he must delink the symbiotic relationship between the Saudi royal family and the government of the United States of America. And to do that he must strike at America, to make a clear statement that was as lasting as it was indelible."|"The Bourne Betrayal"|"Eric van Lustbader"

Three minutes over, still well within the time-frame tolerance allotted to him by his employer. It was Tuesday, February 3, as Bourne had said. On Tuesday, Dr. Sunderland had no office hours."|"The Bourne Betrayal"|"Eric van Lustbader"

17:33|"5:33 PM"|"At precisely 5:33 PM, the DCI was up in the Library, which was where Lerner found him. The Library was a large, roughly square room with double-height ceilings. It did not, however, contain any books. Not one volume. Every bit of data, history, commentary, strategy, tactic-in sum, the collected wisdom of CI directors and officers past and present-was digitized, housed on the enormous linked hard drives of a special computer server. Sixteen terminals were arrayed around the periphery of the room."|"The Bourne Betrayal"|"Eric van Lustbader"

"ap 09:00"|nine|"This was hardly difficult; he was a born actor. His mother, recognizing his talent with a mother’s unerring instinct, had enrolled him in the Royal Theatrical Academy when he was seven. By nine, he was an accomplished performer, which stood him in good stead when he became radicalized. Gathering followers-winning the hearts and minds of the poor, the downtrodden, the marginalized, the desperate-was, at bedrock, a matter of charisma. Fadi understood the essential nature of being a successful leader: It didn’t matter what your philosophy was; all you needed to concern yourself with was how well you sold it. That was not to say Fadi was a cynic-no radical worth his salt could be. It simply meant he had learned the crucial lesson of market manipulation."|"The Bourne Betrayal"|"Eric van Lustbader"

This concerned him less than the mysterious disappearance of Matthew Lerner. He’d asked the Old Man, but the bastard had only said that Lerner was “on assignment.” That could mean anything. Like all the best schemers, Karim al-Jamil hated loose ends, which was precisely what Matthew Lerner had become. Even Anne didn’t know where the man was, an oddity in itself. Normally, she would have booked Lerner’s itinerary personally. The DCI was up to something. Karim al-Jamil could not discount the possibility that Lerner’s sudden disappearance had something to do with Anne. He’d have to find out, as quickly as possible. That meant dealing directly with the DCI."|"The Bourne Betrayal"|"Eric van Lustbader"

It was in an old building, large and rambling, on a side street not five blocks from the Hagia Sophia, the great church created by Justinian in AD 532. As such, the hammam was always well attended, its prices higher than those in less touristed sections of the city.

He prayed that she hadn’t fallen into enemy hands. But if the worst had happened, he had to protect himself from Karim, who would no doubt check her cell for incoming and outgoing calls.

Bourne wasn’t surprised. Miran Shah, mountainous as it was, was a disaster for cell service. Still, it had been worth a try.
3:01.
Veintrop had started with the blue wire, then the green. Bourne’s fingertips gripped the blue wire, about to unwind it from its terminal. Still, he hesitated. Why, he asked himself, would the secondary timer deactivate in the same way? Veintrop had designed this ingenious trap. The secondary timer would come into play only if the primary had been disabled. Therefore, it would make no sense to design it to be disabled in the same way."|"The Bourne Betrayal"|"Eric van Lustbader"

The question here was not how to deactivate the timer; it was how Veintrop’s fiendish mind worked. If the primary had been disabled, it would mean that someone had known the right order in which to detach the wires. In the secondary, the order in which the wires needed to be detached could be reversed, or even scrambled in so many possible combinations it would be virtually impossible to stumble upon the right one before inadvertently detonating the nuclear device."|"The Bourne Betrayal"|"Eric van Lustbader"

The time for speculation had passed. He had to make a decision, and it had to be the right one. He decided to reverse the order; he grasped the red wire, about to unwind it when his keen eye spotted something. He leaned in closer, studying the secondary timer in a different way. Pushing aside the nest of colored wires, he discovered that the timer was attached to the main part of the device in a wholly different way than was the primary."|"The Bourne Betrayal"|"Eric van Lustbader"
