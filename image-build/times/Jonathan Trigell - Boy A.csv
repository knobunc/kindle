07:30|"7:30 am"|"Each day for fifteen, Terry is going to pick Jack up at 7:30 am, the time he will soon be picked up for work, and show him another alien angle on life. And every night Jack is going to close his eyes and not believe this is happening to him."|"Boy A"|"Jonathan Trigell"
"ap 06:00"|six|"There’s a quality, a sort of paleness, in these mornings, that Jack has quickly come to adore. Like today, he often gets up at six to have the short walk to the paper shop to himself. The thin damp air seems to welcome him to the day. He fondles the chunky pound coins in his pocket, as comforting as his testicles. This is the last he need spend of his ‘pies’, his prison wages. Tomorrow he will get his first fortnight’s pay: a wage in pounds, instead of pence."|"Boy A"|"Jonathan Trigell"
"ap 00:01"|12:01|"It was the twelfth of December, the twelfth month. A was twelve. The electric clock/radio by his bedside table said 12:01. A was waiting for it to read 12:12, he hoped there would be some sense of cosmic rightness when it did."|"Boy A"|"Jonathan Trigell"

"ap 00:11"|12:11|"At 12:11 there was a knock on the door. It was Terry, A could tell. He hadn’t known Terry long, but there was something calmer, more patient, that separated Terry’s knocks from the rest of the staff. He knocked from genuine politeness, not formality."|"Boy A"|"Jonathan Trigell"
"ap 02:30"|2:30|"They time their breaks flawlessly, heading back to the unit at precisely 2:30, to pick up more stock. It’s crisps today. Their firm does local distribution for a company that makes snacks, seemingly just for garages. At least Chris says he’s never seen them sold anywhere else. Big bags of salt and vinegar sticks, bacon balls and cheese puffs. The piles of identical goods make Jack think of Hacendado. It’s a long time since he last saw Hacendado. It’s getting to be quite a while since he saw Michelle too."|"Boy A"|"Jonathan Trigell"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"There should have been a revival of phrenology in fact, around the courtroom: so many people could tell, simply by looking, that the boys were born evil. Some said just one was; acknowledging the unlikelihood of finding two such freaks of nature in a school so small. Concluding that the other must have followed, though they divided on the choice: child B being from a gene-pool clearly predisposed to crime; but the other, an academic year older, was brighter and had the mark of the beast, in his face and teeth. Folie à deux was the theory of the better-educated onlookers, frequently expressed in the eleven o’clock breaks. Where they tended to stick together, huddled in the fog of other people’s Berkeley 100s and Lambert & Butler’s. They would sip bad coffee and agree that each boy had egged the other on, gradually, like wading into a pool; until both found they were up to their necks in it."|"Boy A"|"Jonathan Trigell"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"Although there were usually only two minors present, the court stuck to school hours. Starting at nine, breaking at eleven, and then again at one and two-thirty, closing for the day at three-thirty-five; or sooner if the judge felt an apt natural pause had been reached. Sometimes there were other children. Three boys testified separately, via video link, about a time when they had all been set upon by the two defendants. They were clearly still upset by the experience, because their faces were anxious, and they stumbled during the gentle cross-examination, getting confused and contradicting each other about exactly who had said and done what. But the jury got the gist of this unprovoked assault."|"Boy A"|"Jonathan Trigell"

"ap 00:30"|"half of one"|"B coughed. The cough made him feel sick, reminded him he needed a cigarette. As if he didn’t know. They gave him ten with his ‘welcome pack’ when he got his clothes. He had four left. He didn’t know when he could get some more. He figured with four he was fucked anyway. Decided he’d smoke a half of one. It tasted acrid and exquisite. They reckoned smoking was bad for you, but he never coughed when he smoked, only when he didn’t. He doubled the value, by breathing out through his mouth and sucking all the smoke back in again through his nose. It looked beautiful, he knew, like a reverse waterfall, but there was no mirror to watch it."|"Boy A"|"Jonathan Trigell"

"ap > 10:00"|"after ten o’clock"|"The roads are full and fumy, even though it’s after ten o’clock. The tuk-tuk, painted a New York taxi-yellow, weaves through gaps that don’t look big enough for a bicycle. Its driver blots out the sound of the horns that blare at him by blowing his own almost continuously. Unnecessarily. It isn’t like they’re going far, and this passenger’s not in any sort of a hurry. He’s got all night."|"Boy A"|"Jonathan Trigell"

06:04|"6:04 am"|"The grubby shadows are still around at 6:04 am, when Jack wakes up so wired there is no point in trying to sleep for such a little while longer. He goes downstairs in his boxer shorts and T-shirt, flipping on lights as he moves. Opening blinds and curtains to begin with, until he sees that the darkness outside sucks away the comfort of the electric bulbs. He is shaky when he goes into the kitchen, where even in this whitest, brightest room the harsh glare of the strip-light is not enough. He opens the fridge to get its diminutive beam on as well. The cold blast on his bare legs makes them crumple into goosebumps and stands their hairs on end. He can’t figure out his sudden sensitivity to the dark. Something weird is going on. The hairs on his neck prickle too. And he’s not sure if this is caused by the eerie fear, or by the worry that he’s losing it entirely."|"Boy A"|"Jonathan Trigell"
"ap 06:37"|6:37|"At 6:37 the phone rings. The unexpected noise sends a shock through him. Jack looks at it, bewildered. He can’t understand who could be calling at this time in the morning. It rings off just as he finally decides he’d better answer it. While he’s dialling 1471 he hears his mobile going upstairs. The ring tone is a spooky tick-tick tune, which is suddenly not funny in the silence of a day that is doing his head in. Everything is conspiring to unnerve him, and his belief in such omens makes every one register deeper than the last. He races upstairs, stubbing his bare toe on his bedroom doorframe. The phone’s green glowing screen says it’s Dave Vernon. Relieved, but still confused, Jack presses the ‘yes’ button to take the call."|"Boy A"|"Jonathan Trigell"
"ap 06:57"|6:57|"Chris is engaged constantly. It’s 6:57 when Jack finally makes the connection. He pours out about being told not to come in, before Chris has a chance to open his mouth."|"Boy A"|"Jonathan Trigell"
