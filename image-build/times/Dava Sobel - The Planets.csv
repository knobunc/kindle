That year, a small, dark body, independent of Pluto, was detected on the Solar System’s periphery. Similar discoveries soon followed, until the total number of diminutive outliers grew to seven hundred over the ensuing decade. The abundance of mini-worlds made some astronomers wonder whether Pluto should continue to be regarded as a planet, or reclassified as the largest of the “trans-Neptunian objects.” (The Rose Center has already excluded Pluto from the planetary roll call.)"|"The Planets"|"Dava Sobel"
12:00|midday|"Approximately once every two years, some narrow swath of Earth—as often as not a godforsaken, all but inaccessible place—is blessed with a total solar eclipse. There, dusk falls and dawn breaks twice on the same day, and the stars come out with the Sun still overhead. Temperatures may drop ten or fifteen degrees at a stroke, allowing even the most jaded observer to sense the bizarre disorientation that birds and animals share as they hasten to their nests or burrows through the sudden midday darkness."|"The Planets"|"Dava Sobel"
12:00|"high noon"|"The pull of the nearby Sun rushes Mercury around its orbit at an average velocity of thirty miles per second. At that rate, almost double the Earth’s pace, Mercury takes only eighty-eight Earth-days to complete its orbital journey. The same Procrustean gravity that accelerates Mercury’s revolution, however, brakes the planet’s rotation about its own axis. Because the planet forges ahead so much faster than it spins, any given locale waits half a Mercurian year (about six Earth-weeks) after sunup for the full light of high noon. Dusk finally descends at year’s end. And once the long night commences, another Mercurian year must pass before the Sun rises again. Thus the years hurry by, while the days drag on forever."|"The Planets"|"Dava Sobel"

Gassendi’s comment about the small size of Mercury, however, generated big surprise. His formal report stressed his astonishment at the planet’s smallness, explaining how he at first dismissed the black dot as a sunspot, but presently realized it was moving far too quickly to be anything but the winged messenger himself. Gassendi had expected Mercury’s diameter to be one-fifteenth that of the Sun, as estimated by Ptolemy fifteen hundred years before. Instead, the transit revealed Mercury to be only a fraction of that dimension—less than one-hundredth the Sun’s apparent width. The aid of the telescope, coupled with Gassendi’s sighting Mercury silhouetted against the Sun, had stripped the planet of the blurred, aggrandizing glow it typically wore on the horizon."|"The Planets"|"Dava Sobel"

12:00|midday|"Still Mercury frustrated observers who wanted to know what it looked like. One German astronomer postulated a dense cloud layer completely shrouding Mercury’s surface. In Italy, Giovanni Schiaparelli of Milan decided to track the planet overhead in daylight, despite the Sun’s glare, in the hope of getting clearer views of its surface. By pointing his telescope upward into the midday sky, instead of horizontally during dawn or dusk, Schiaparelli avoided the turbulent air on Earth’s horizon, and also succeeded in keeping Mercury in his sights for hours at a time. Beginning in 1881, avoiding coffee and whiskey lest they dull his vision, and forswearing tobacco to the same end, he observed the planet on high at its every elongation. But the pallor of Mercury against the daytime sky confounded his efforts to perceive surface features. After eight years at this Herculean task, Schiaparelli could report nothing but “extremely faint streaks, which,” he said, “can be made out only with greatest effort and attention.” He sketched these streaks, including one that took the shape of the number five, on a rough map of Mercury he issued in 1889."|"The Planets"|"Dava Sobel"

Alas, he cannot venture so far. Although the celestial spheres routinely rotate the Sun, Moon, planets, and a thousand stars into his view, the ends of the earth elude him."|"The Planets"|"Dava Sobel"

We continued to steer to the South and SE till noon at which time we were in the Latitude of 58° 15′ S Longitude 21′ 34′ West and seeing neither land nor signs of any, I concluded that what we had seen which I named Sandwich Land was either a group of Isles &ca or else a point of the Continent, for I firmly believe that there is a tract of land near the Pole, which is the source of most of the ice which is spread over this vast Southern Ocean….I mean a land of some considerable extent….It is however true that the greatest part of this Southern Continent (supposing there is one) must lay within the Polar Circle where the Sea is so pestered with ice that the land is thereby inaccessible.”"|"The Planets"|"Dava Sobel"
"ap ~ 02:00"|"About two"|"“August 11th [1833]—Mr Harris, an Englishman residing at Patagones, a guide, and five Gauchos, who were proceeding to the army on business, were my companions on the journey…. Shortly after passing the first spring we came in sight of a famous tree, which the Indians reverence as the altar of Walleechu…. About two leagues beyond this curious tree we halted for the night: at this instant an unfortunate cow was spied by the lynx-eyed Gauchos. Off they set in chase, and in a few minutes she was dragged in by the lazo, and slaughtered. We here had the four necessaries of life ‘en el campo,’—pasture for the horses, water (only a muddy puddle), meat, and firewood. The Gauchos were in high spirits at finding all these luxuries; and we soon set to work at the poor cow. This was the first night which I had ever passed under the open sky, with the gear of the recado [saddle] for my bed. There is high enjoyment in the independence of the Gaucho life—to be able at any moment to pull up your horse, and say, ‘Here we will pass the night.’ The deathlike stillness of the plain, the dogs keeping watch, the gypsy-group of Gauchos making their beds round the fire, have left in my mind a strongly marked picture of this first night, which will not soon be forgotten.”"|"The Planets"|"Dava Sobel"
