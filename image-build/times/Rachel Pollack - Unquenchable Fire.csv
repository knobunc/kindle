"ap > 11:00"|"after eleven o’clock"|"In Jennifer Mazdan’s time you could still hear children crying every night after eleven o’clock, a wailing that made it impossible to build housing along the riverside. Sailboats, barges, and tourist boats would sometimes get bits of souls tangled up in their rudders, causing the boats to spin in circles until the children came loose again."|"Unquenchable Fire"|"Rachel Pollack"
"~ 13:00"|"around one in the afternoon"|"Some time around one in the afternoon Lightstorm emerged from the residence. He travelled up the hill in the grand manner, sweeping the path with the folds of his recital skin. Bills and coins lay all over the tiles, offerings of the people who’d managed to make their way through the crowd. The gesture of ‘cleaning the road’ with his sleeve demonstrated the Teller’s non-interest in personal gain. (After the Recital the faceless Workers from the residence would come and pick up the money in baskets the shape of squatting pigs.) As he climbed the hill Lightstorm thought of the satellite hook-up that should have been carrying his voice across the continent. He wondered whom his chairperson had found to replace him. He glanced over at the privileged hicks (presumably the mayor and the City Council if that’s what they had here) sitting under parasols on velvet-covered benches right along the pathside. Right alongside. He’d be lucky if they didn’t try to touch him. Their mouths hung open as if they expected him to feed them their dinner. The hicks might decide they’d got a little richer food than they wanted when they discovered just what picture their imported star was planning for this feast of theirs."|"Unquenchable Fire"|"Rachel Pollack"
"ap 06:10"|"Ten past six"|"Jennie sighed. She was thinking about Mike again. Almost three years and she was still…One of these days she’d have to go down to that place by Ellenville and get scourged for all the guilt she was piling up violating the annulment. As the noise in the street came closer Jennie looked at the clock. She winced. Ten past six. She still couldn’t understand what had made her volunteer to work on the morning of the Day of Truth. It wasn’t the money, at least she didn’t think it was. Not that she couldn’t use the bonus."|"Unquenchable Fire"|"Rachel Pollack"
"ap 00:45"|12:45|"12:45, the article said. There’d be a mob, Jennie knew. Even if the hooker could tell her anything she probably wouldn’t get close enough to ask. She went back in the house and told herself she should forget it, make some lunch. Instead, she went to the dinette for her pocketbook and sunglasses."|"Unquenchable Fire"|"Rachel Pollack"
12:00|midday|"Teller Avenue ran across the city, from the Mid-Hudson Bridge to the triangle of highways leading into the hills and toward Connecticut. Without thinking, Jennie expected to find the clinic near the river end, among the slightly shabby homes, the ageing apartment houses and small office buildings. Instead, she found herself driving through the midday traffic into the realm of one and two storey houses with small but neat lawns and bright porches. The clinic itself occupied a modernist rectangle of wood and frosted glass. A long narrow lawn, free of weeds, set the clinic somewhat behind the woodframe houses on either side of it. Above the dark red door Jennie could see a small painting, but she couldn’t make out the details. Probably the Great Abortion, or some other marvel of the clinic’s patron."|"Unquenchable Fire"|"Rachel Pollack"
12:00|"Twelve noon"|"The laugh turned into a whimper and she slumped down in her seat. What was she going to do? She knew very well no incubus had done this to her. That stunt with the trees could only have come right from the top. ‘A fish is swimming in your womb. The world is boiling with colour.’ Why couldn’t the world get back its colour without her? She got up and checked the calendar. The Recital was the 21st. She flipped the pages, then dropped them, realising what day the baby was due. March 21st, right smack on the equinox. How appropriate. Lamb’s Birth Day. The Day of the Rising Fire. Anniversary of the Creation of the Universe. Shit. You could bet this toddler would toddle out right on the date. What time, dawn? Twelve noon?"|"Unquenchable Fire"|"Rachel Pollack"
"ap 08:00"|"8 o’clock"|"‘Fine, Jennifer, fine. And here’s something else to think about. You report for work, next Monday, 8 o’clock sharp, or I’ll kick your tits halfway to Wappingers Falls. Got that?’"|"Unquenchable Fire"|"Rachel Pollack"
"ap 08:30"|8:30|"For several weeks Jennie walked around the city or stayed in her room watching television. One day, during one of her walks, it began to snow. She took refuge in a temp, office, where she filled out a form. Two weeks later a phone call woke her up at 8:30 to send her off to the Sacred Rainbow Costume Distributors to help put together orders for the coming equinox parades. After several weeks Jennie moved on to consumer surveys in department stores, and after that a long stint processing personal ads for an intellectual newspaper."|"Unquenchable Fire"|"Rachel Pollack"
"~ 23:00"|"around eleven at night"|"Mike came home around eleven at night, with a peck on the lips and an announcement that he’d eaten, and was so tired he just wanted to have a shower and go to bed. Jennie listened to him shower, and when he lay in bed she stood in the doorway, her own arms full of his dirty laundry from his suitcase. She told herself how much she loved him, how they would work it out, how she would do anything to keep him."|"Unquenchable Fire"|"Rachel Pollack"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"That evening, at seven o’clock, Uncle Jake called. Mike had gone to New York, he said. He said that Mike wanted him to tell her he just needed time to think things out. He’d get in touch with her in a few days. ‘I’m sure he still loves you,’ Uncle Jake said. ‘He just needs a little time.’"|"Unquenchable Fire"|"Rachel Pollack"
00:00|midnight|"The substitutes cannot last. In the furnace of our mother the assembled foreskins curl and break away from each other. Over and over again our ancient father must restore himself. For without him to calm her, Mothersnake will devour us. And so, all weddings, this wedding, all weddings must end with the black knife, the fall of the blade, the foreskin carried to the roof of the hall at midnight and thrown into the wind. The wind carries it to our ancestors, they will join it to the others surrendered over the years. In love all men become their father, in love they enter the warmth of their mother."|"Unquenchable Fire"|"Rachel Pollack"
"ap 02:00"|two|"Jennie breathed deeply. She decided to count to three and then decide. At two she stopped, took another breath, then said, ‘Shit,’ loudly, and began to dial. On the third five her finger slipped and she had to start again. But a moment later the distant ringing began, followed by a woman’s dull voice saying, ‘Rainbow Telecommunications, directory assistance. May I help you?’ Jennie couldn’t speak. ‘May I help you?’ the woman said again."|"Unquenchable Fire"|"Rachel Pollack"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"At seven o’clock Jennie sat down at the dinette table with the list in front of her, carefully positioned in the centre of the place mat. Maybe she could just write. She could xerox the letter and send it to all three at the same time. She growled and stood up by the phone."|"Unquenchable Fire"|"Rachel Pollack"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"It was slightly before nine on Sunday morning. Jennie had spent the night at Hudson Street, showing up without phoning and for once embarrassing her mother. Apparently Beverley had planned some sort of ceremonial sex project with one man and four women from her latest ensemble. They’d moved all the furniture out of the living room and drawn a chalk outline on the floor of a spreadeagled androgyne with double genitals. Various objects lay at the hands and feet and head. Jennie avoided looking at the men and women sitting on the floor. She announced to her mother that she would spend the night in her third floor bedroom, and then marched out. Beverley called to her from the bottom of the stairs. ‘I’m sorry, Jen,’ she said. ‘I didn’t know you were coming. You should have called.’ Jennie kept going."|"Unquenchable Fire"|"Rachel Pollack"
"ap 00:58"|"two minutes to one"|"Mike came in at two minutes to one. Jennie smiled, remembering his hatred of coming late, or even early. He winced when she held her hand up by her chin and waved her fingers at him. When he’d sat down across from her and the waiter came he said, ‘Coffee. Black.’"|"Unquenchable Fire"|"Rachel Pollack"
"ap 01:00"|one|"And there the men were, talking, laughing, drinking beer through straws stuck through holes in the masks. Jennie couldn’t think of what they were doing there until one of them noticed her and pointed her out to the others. Immediately they all began to whistle and clap their hands. ‘A volunteer,’ someone said loudly. ‘You coming to volunteer?’ They laughed, and someone else called, ‘You want to help us with our enactment? You’ll love it.’ One of the pseudo-men threw something at her. A tomato, she saw, as it hit a tree behind her. Apparently that was going too far, for one of the pseudo-women shoved him, and another said, ‘Arse-hole. What are you going to throw when the real thing starts?’"|"Unquenchable Fire"|"Rachel Pollack"
00:00|midnight|"At first everyone gave her offerings and came to sit beside her, telling her all the news. But after a while people forgot. At night they would play loud music so she couldn’t sleep. In winter, children threw snowballs at her to see them melt. If it rained, people would wipe their hands on her as they passed. In the old days, which people came to think of as a dream, they would paint their cars with the Mother’s favourite colours, then dress themselves in the skins of her favourite animals to drive past in a slow procession from dark until midnight on the Rising of the Light. As the bells rang for midnight they would switch on the lights and honk their horns. But now that dreamtime had ended, and people dressed in black leather raced their cars throughout the year along the ‘old straight track’ as people called the highway that ran in front of the Mother’s house. The air filled with smoke, while every morning the road stank of rubber."|"Unquenchable Fire"|"Rachel Pollack"
"ap > 09:00"|"shortly after nine o’clock"|"On the night that Jennie’s house was sold, in homes up and down the hive, people found themselves fighting with each other or bursting into tears or tripping and banging their shins against the bathtub. On Cannon Street, meanwhile, the residents all broke into laughter at the exact moment that the Sun set, while shortly after nine o’clock many people claimed they saw a large bird circling above the street. The next day people who had been driving on Cannon Street the night before claimed that a formation of either flying saucers or winged women had hovered above the buildings and then returned to their secret bases far from human knowledge."|"Unquenchable Fire"|"Rachel Pollack"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"When Jennie had lived there for a week it came time for the ‘Rising of the Light’, the most important of the Winter Enactments. All over town, people were crowding the department stores for last minute presents, queueing at the supermarket for turkeys, baking cakes in the shape of sunbursts, and ironing white dresses or polishing white boots. Jennie made sure to stay in all that day. As evening approached she thought of everyone squeezing into their neighbourhood Picture Halls, all of them wearing long black coats or even opera capes to conceal their white clothes. At nine o’clock the heat died in the radiators; Jennie banged on the pipes and when that failed she went down to the second floor where the superintendent lived. No one was home. He’s gone to the Enactment, Jennie realized. He’s turned off the goddamn heat because he’s figured everyone’s gone to the Enactment. She climbed the stairs back to her apartment. When she got there she lay down on the bed she’d bought the week before (the apartment had come furnished but Jennie had thrown out the bed after one night) and covered herself with the quilt Betsy Rodriguez’s mother had given her in college. There she lay, imagining the Tellers intoning the Pictures, seeing everyone lighting their gold candles, hearing the shouts as the spotlights came on in the Hall and everyone threw off their black coverings to hug and kiss each other in their whites."|"Unquenchable Fire"|"Rachel Pollack"
00:15|"quarter past midnight"|"At Cannon Street Jennifer Mazdan, wearing only a bathrobe, fell asleep a little after ten. For more than two days she’d felt occasional twinges of pain, not enough to commandeer her attention. At a quarter past midnight on March 21, she woke up to discover a contraction shaking her body. When she looked between her legs she saw that a small amount of mucous had leaked out to stain her robe and the chair. Her labour had begun. She had no idea what to do."|"Unquenchable Fire"|"Rachel Pollack"
09:00|"nine a.m."|"There was no Sun that day. Though the wind stopped by nine a.m. a squadron of clouds stood guard against the light. In the midst of her pain Jennie remembered the storyteller on Hudson Street, with her prophecy of a three day darkness. She thought I can’t last three days, it’s too much."|"Unquenchable Fire"|"Rachel Pollack"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"When the storm ended, at six o’clock, the owner of a riverside restaurant drove down to check for damage. Before he could even take a look at the building, he heard a loud whistling noise coming off the river. When he went to investigate he saw something, some kind of swarm, rising out of the water just before the mid-Hudson bridge. They looked like insects made of coloured aluminium foil. They hovered in the air in front of the suspension cables, fluttering about like tiny excited birds, all the time whistling. Then they blew away in a gust of wind to vanish over the cliffs on the other side of the river."|"Unquenchable Fire"|"Rachel Pollack"
"ap 11:15"|"quarter past eleven"|"Of course. The children. The souls of the children who had served the Army of the Saints in the Battle of the Waters. For decades they’d clogged the river, scaring the fish, jamming boat rudders, forcing him to close his restaurant every night at ten to avoid the weeping that always began at a quarter past eleven. No one could live there because of the weeping. Most of the land along the riverfront was near worthless because of it. He’d opened his restaurant there because he could get the property so cheap, but he’d always had to fight against people’s reluctance to come there during the day."|"Unquenchable Fire"|"Rachel Pollack"
