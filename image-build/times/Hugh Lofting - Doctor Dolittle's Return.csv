"ap > 11:00"|"A few minutes after eleven o'clock"|"""A few minutes after eleven o'clock, Tommy,"" said he. ""I'm going to go up and watch it from the roof, I am."""|"Doctor Dolittle's Return"|"Hugh Lofting"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o'clock"|"Gub-Gub was dreadfully afraid that he would miss the eclipse by falling asleep. This was something he did very easily at any hour at all. He made us promise to wake him if he should doze off before eleven o'clock. Cheapside's coming had cheered us all up. We certainly needed it. I thought something should be done to celebrate."|"Doctor Dolittle's Return"|"Hugh Lofting"
"ap 10:30"|"half-past ten"|"All the animals wanted to make sure of a good place to watch from, where they could see the show properly. This was not easy. There were several high trees near the house; and at half-past ten the moon looked as though it might very soon be hidden by their top branches--that is, if one tried to watch the eclipse from the garden. So Gub-Gub said he wanted to see it from the roof, the same as Cheapside. I explained to him that it was easy for the birds, like Too-Too, Dab-Dab and the sparrow--and even for the white mouse, because they could cling to the ridge and keep their balance, but that it would be much more difficult for him and Jip and myself."|"Doctor Dolittle's Return"|"Hugh Lofting"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"When I had got him dry I heard the hall clock strike eleven and we hurried back to the trapdoor."|"Doctor Dolittle's Return"|"Hugh Lofting"
"< 00:00"|"nearly midnight"|"""But everything will be all shut up now, Tommy,"" said he. ""It's nearly midnight."""|"Doctor Dolittle's Return"|"Hugh Lofting"
"~ 12:00"|"About noon"|"About noon Dab-Dab woke us and said breakfast was ready. We were hungry and ate a hearty meal."|"Doctor Dolittle's Return"|"Hugh Lofting"
"~ 16:30"|"about half-past four in the afternoon"|"It was about half-past four in the afternoon when Matthew got back. Besides the stores I had sent him for, he brought Theodosia Mugg, his wife. I was glad to see her big motherly figure coming up the garden path. She was a very clever and capable woman, was Theodosia. This she had shown when she travelled with the Doctor in the circus, years ago, and had acted as wardrobe-woman in the famous Canary Opera which John Dolittle had put on in London."|"Doctor Dolittle's Return"|"Hugh Lofting"
"ap ~ 07:15"|"about a quarter-past seven"|"It began to get dark about a quarter-past seven. By that time the animals had all had sleep of some sort, even if it was only a few minutes. They now began to fuss around again, chatting in the garden in twos and threes, determined not to be caught napping at the last moment. I noticed some blackbirds and robins watching this moonlight garden party from the trees. So I sent out Dab-Dab to call the animals in."|"Doctor Dolittle's Return"|"Hugh Lofting"
"ap 08:15"|"quarter-past eight"|"When the moon rose at a quarter-past eight, Matthew and I stationed ourselves at one of the bedroom windows. We left this window open."|"Doctor Dolittle's Return"|"Hugh Lofting"
"< 00:00"|"nearly midnight"|"Of course as time went on the Doctor became more and more anxious to get at his notes and the writing of his book about the moon. One evening, after all our work for the day had been attended to, we were sitting in the kitchen. Matthew Mugg, the Cats'-meat-Man, was with us. It was nearly midnight and I had packed all the animals off to bed because both John Dolittle and myself were pretty tired."|"Doctor Dolittle's Return"|"Hugh Lofting"
">> 00:00"|"long after midnight"|"Well, it was towards the end of that week that the Doctor came to a decision. We had a very long line of patients calling on him--worse than usual. The cases were not serious ones, but they kept him on the go from the time he got out of bed till the time he went back to it--long after midnight. To make matters worse still, four new dogs arrived who wished to become members of the ""Home."" And the same afternoon Whitey discovered two new families of wild mice who said they'd like to join the Rat and Mouse Club. When I went with the Doctor up to his bedroom that night he was all worn out."|"Doctor Dolittle's Return"|"Hugh Lofting"
"ap 00:45"|"quarter to one"|"""Very good,"" said I. ""We can manage that all right. Now get some sleep, Doctor. It's a quarter to one."""|"Doctor Dolittle's Return"|"Hugh Lofting"
00:00|midnight|"""Stubbins, if I'm not back here by midnight you'll know I've succeeded. Don't bother about visiting me for a good while. And on no account let Matthew come at all. I'll be all right. Look after the old lame horse. And keep an eye on those moon plants for me. So long!"""|"Doctor Dolittle's Return"|"Hugh Lofting"
00:00|midnight|"Well, that time he did succeed--as we heard later. All the animals insisted on sitting up with me that night to see if John Dolittle would return. When the old clock in the hall struck midnight we knew that he was in jail at last. Then I sent them off to bed."|"Doctor Dolittle's Return"|"Hugh Lofting"
"ap ~ 11:00"|"about eleven o'clock"|"Starting out early on Sunday morning I reached Goresby jail about eleven o'clock. I noticed as I entered the building that many labourers were digging at the side of one wall, as if they were at work on the foundations."|"Doctor Dolittle's Return"|"Hugh Lofting"
"~ 15:00"|"about three in the afternoon"|"14. THE LITTLE VILLAIN
We got back home about three in the afternoon.
Once again the whole household wanted to know what had happened--all of them, that is, except Whitey. I noticed that he was not among the welcoming committee who met us in the garden."|"Doctor Dolittle's Return"|"Hugh Lofting"
"~ 02:00"|"about two o'clock in the morning"|"I was beginning to think it never would break up, when at last, somewhere about two o'clock in the morning, Matthew said he ought to be getting back home. This gave Dab-Dab, who wanted to get the kitchen cleaned up before breakfast-time, a chance to shoo the family off to bed. The Doctor, Matthew and I went into the study."|"Doctor Dolittle's Return"|"Hugh Lofting"
