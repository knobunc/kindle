12:00|"HIGH NOON"|"Dan is going to a wedding. His nephew and niece are helping him to get ready. His niece puts his top hat on the chair. Crunch! goes the hat as Dan sits on it. He goes to buy a new hat, but they are all FAR TOO SMALL. This is the biggest in the shop, the assistant tells him. Dan tries it on. It’s almost big enough he says, but when he tries to pull it down a bit, he rips the brim off and it comes down over his face. OH, NO! he says, looking over the brim. Outside the shop he has an idea, and points to something not shown in the picture. Ah! That’s the very thing! he says, but first he has to clear the City Square so that no one will see what he is going to do. Round the corner, he bends over a water hydrant and blows. Water explodes out of the fountain in the square, drenching everybody, and they all have to go home, leaving the square deserted. Good, now I can get what I want, Dan says. In the next picture, Dan is trying on a big grey topper. He looks pleased and says, That’s it! And it fits a treat. He attends the wedding, and at the Reception Hall he hands his hat to the cloakroom attendant. The attendant can’t hold it and the hat goes Crunch! on his foot. Ooyah! goes the attendant. He tries to pick it up, saying, Help! What a hat! It’s made of solid stone! The last picture shows where the hat came from: from the head of the statue in the City Square: WILLIAM SMITH, MAYOR OF CACTUSVILLE 1865–86. SHOT AT HIGH NOON BY BLACK JAKE."|"A Kestrel for a Knave"|"Barry Hines"

"ap 08:30"|8.30|"‘Right, forget it. If I said to Casper, “Why were you late this morning?” and he replied, “Well when I got up this morning our house had been washed out to sea, so I caught the 8.30 whale to shore, and hitched a lift on an eagle’s back. But we were held up for twenty minutes in a bird-jam, and that’s why I was late.” Well if Casper came to me with that tale, I’d probably look at him and say, “That’s a bit of a tall story, isn’t it, lad?” ’"|"A Kestrel for a Knave"|"Barry Hines"

12:15|"12.15 p.m."|"12.15 p.m. The winning goal suddenly became important, no more laughter, no more joking, everybody working. For most of the game most of the boys had been as fixed as buttons on a pinball machine, sparking into life only when the nucleus of footballers amongs them had occasionally shuttled the ball into their defined areas: mere props to the play. Now they were all playing. Both teams playing as units, and positions were taken seriously. In possession they moved and called for the ball from spaces. Out of possession they marked and tackled hard to win it back. A move provoked a counter move, which in turn determined moves made by players in other segments of the pitch. The ball was a magnet, exerting the strongest pull on the players nearest to it, and still strong enough to activate the players farthest away."|"A Kestrel for a Knave"|"Barry Hines"
12:20|"12.20 p.m."|"12.20 p.m. Billy jump, jump, jumped on the line. ‘Score, for Christ’s sake somebody score.’ Tick tick tick tick. Sugden missed again. He’s blind, he’s bleedin’ blind. Sugden was crimson and sweating like a drayhorse, and boys began to accelerate smoothly past him, well wide of him, well clear of his scything legs and shirt-grabbing fists."|"A Kestrel for a Knave"|"Barry Hines"
12:25|"12.25 p.m."|"12.25 p.m. 26. 27. Every time Billy saved a shot he looked heartbroken. Every time he cleared the ball, he cleared it blind, giving the other side a fifty-fifty chance of possession, and every time they gained possession, Sugden threatened him with violence, while at the same time keeping his eyes on the ball and moving out to check the next advance. So that a sudden spectator would have been surprised to see Sugden rushing forward and apparently intimidating the boy on the ball."|"A Kestrel for a Knave"|"Barry Hines"
13:00|"one this afternoon"|"‘Well get undressed then.’
‘I can bring one this afternoon though.’
‘That’s no good, lad, I want one now. You know the school rule, don’t you? Any boy wishing to be excused Physical Education or showers must, AT THE TIME of the lesson, produce a sealed letter of explanation signed by one of his parents or legal guardian.’"|"A Kestrel for a Knave"|"Barry Hines"
