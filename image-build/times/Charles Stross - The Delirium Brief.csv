I’m surrounded by a knot of soberly dressed civil servants who are marching shoulder to shoulder in lockstep to keep me from being recognized, or maybe to prevent me making a run for it if I lose my nerve. We are waved past nodding receptionists and security guards who hold the turnstiles open for me as if I am expected—because I am indeed expected. Unfortunately."|"The Delirium Brief"|"Charles Stross"

(I still think closing the shop, kicking everyone else out, and stationing guards inside the door was a bit excessive, though: who ever heard of a top secret haircut?) I’m wearing my funeral suit and tie, and my shoes are dazzlingly polished. (Just pretend you’re acting a role, she said, straightening my collar; concentrate and remember your talking points.) I look twenty years older than I feel, and I feel ten years older than usual—mostly due to jet lag. They emailed me a set of notes just before I caught my flight home, and I did my best to memorize them on the plane from Kansai. But right now I feel like it’s seven in the morning, and I’m yawning because I’m waking up, not going to sleep."|"The Delirium Brief"|"Charles Stross"

I might be living in Beer Standard Time, but Mo has just spent last week off-grid in a cottage down at the Village, getting away from it all. She’s back at work this week, and I’m certain she’ll be burning the candle at both ends catching up with the backlog.

He seems eager to please, and killing him would result in altogether too much paperwork of an excruciatingly dull variety, so I just shake my head. “I’ve got a meeting in five minutes, but I can fit you in afterwards—knock on my office door around eleven thirty?”"|"The Delirium Brief"|"Charles Stross"

"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"The SA’s note directs me to one of the former. The bar is pointedly stool-less and the tables all boast clipboards with multipage menus changing by the hour, and the kind of incredibly hard seating that causes your legs to go to sleep within half an hour if you’re there for a leisurely drink rather than to gobble and go. The tables are, predictably, crammed, but the bar isn’t too bad, and there’s a guy standing there who fits the description. He’s wearing an airline-rumpled nondescript suit that shouts Fed in an American accent, with buzz-cut hair, six o’clock stubble, and a despondent expression. A fiftyish face that’s been lived in for too long, like a once-handsome shopping mall on the downslope to demolition. He’s swaying gently over his pint of London Pride but it’s not drunk swaying, it’s I-can’t-stay-awake wobbling. Every minute he gives a little myoclonic jolt and stretches his back, as if forcing himself not to fall asleep. Poor bastard probably shipped over in cattle class and has been awake for going on forty-eight hours. Oh, and the cheap briefcase at his feet is wearing a level six ward, which seals the deal."|"The Delirium Brief"|"Charles Stross"

And after my Newsnight slot I’m very much not secret at all. I’m not sure how they traced me to the office in the first place, but to have a snatch squad on the pavement waiting outside for me to leave is bad: very, very bad indeed."|"The Delirium Brief"|"Charles Stross"

And let’s not mention the State Department hitchhiker they had along for the trip, whisked off to Grosvenor Square before you could snap your fingers. But of course we don’t get notified routinely because we’re not the police or Security Service.

My nasty paranoid imagination supplies a plausible scenario all too easily: The armed cops on the door of a clearly compromised work site put up a neon sign saying BOB WORKS HERE, but they clock off at 6:00 p.m. because bad guys only kick the door down during office hours.

We gossip uneasily and try to avoid speculating about the evening’s events. But eventually Johnny’s phone rings and after a brief call he tells us that ’Seph isn’t coming round to brief us after all: we’re to finish the reports and he’ll see they get to the SA by midnight.

Mo’s boundary issues with the Eater of Souls raise their ugly head: she’s terrified of me sleepwalking and mistaking her for a midnight snack. I wish I could say this was unreasonable of her.

The cops are back on door duty with their mirror-visored helmets and matte body armor, but they pay no particular attention as I enter. I head for my office, sit down, sigh loudly, and poke at my inbox and schedule. It’s nearly twelve o’clock, I have a mild headache, and after a minute or three I diagnose an excess of blood in my caffeine stream, so I head to the break room.

Call an Uber, have it take me to this shopping center, go to level one and look for that hair salon, reservation in the name of Boris Johnson. Make sure you’re seen by Dave, he’s a trusted resource. So I spend a couple of hours having my eyebrows reshaped and being taught how to wear and maintain a wig and use some very special makeup that makes me look completely different to infrared cameras, then I go back out and, next checklist item: call an Uber, go there, pick up keys to the Airbnb flat Bob 2.0 is renting for the next three nights (but moving on from a day early), being sure to arrive before five p.m. because a Tesco delivery van is heading your way with food and drink to sign for."|"The Delirium Brief"|"Charles Stross"

This first session is a black tie event with a very exclusive guest list (no journalists or press photographers will be permitted to approach within telephoto range). While many of the attendees are arriving in a fleet of chauffeur-driven limos provided by GP Services, others—the reclusive property tycoon Burroughs twins, the eldest son and heir of an infamous press baron, a former French president and his supermodel/rock-star wife—are dropping in on the helipad tucked discreetly behind the orchard at the rear of the building."|"The Delirium Brief"|"Charles Stross"
