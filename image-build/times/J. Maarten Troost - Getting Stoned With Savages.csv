The conference room itself was transparent, because the World Bank values transparency, and as I approached I wondered, Is that a Bank vice president sitting there? Why, yes, it was.

After a rather exhilarating slide down a hill with my foot pressing the brake as far as it would go, we probably ought to have listened to our more sensible instincts and turned around. We drove on, however, partly because I am constitutionally incapable of backtracking, but mostly because the scenery was so alluring and each curve and every crest promised another vista of paradise. There were coconut palms with their fronds moving like languorous fans, and I was feeling tremendously pleased to be among them again. The hillsides were impressively dense and green, exuding an air of primordial wilderness. Those woods, I had read, contained a multitude of lizards, including the banded iguana, a fearsome-looking dragon that grows upwards of three feet in length. There was also the Pacific boa, an eight-foot-long snake that I hoped never to encounter. It is said that the Pacific boa is harmless, but I didn’t believe that for a moment. Raised as a Catholic, I still find it difficult to have warm and mushy feelings toward snakes. We stopped here and there, never encountering another vehicle, and listened to the quiet buzz of insects and the lazy calls of birds slumbering in the midday sun. There was a torporous serenity to the island, and the lingering small pressures that remained of our lives in Washington, the urge to hurry on, to check e-mail, to do errands, evaporated with the rising heat."|"Getting Stoned With Savages"|"J.

Indeed, until the 1940s, the Ni-Vanuatu were not even allowed to live in Vila, as the locals call their town. Any Ni-Vanuatu men found wandering about after 9 P.M. were arrested. This, remarkably, was an improvement over the state of affairs that prevailed in the 1880s, when Port Vila was little more than a debauched port for planters, beachcombers, ex-convicts, and blackbirders—rapacious labor recruiters who plied the South Pacific, filling their holds with bodies to send to plantations and mines throughout the Southern Hemisphere.

In Washington, whenever there was a hurricane pummeling Florida, I’d eagerly watch the news, envying the brave, brave TV correspondents, reporting that the wind was picking up and any moment now their umbrellas were sure to fail. There was always a shot of people merrily goofing around on the beach in Key West, people who had ignored the evacuation orders and were carelessly enjoying the scene as the winds increased from gale to hurricane strength.

I was shivering. It is rare to feel cold in the South Pacific, but that is the state in which I found myself. We gingerly made our way toward the volcano, following a muddy trail illuminated by the truck’s headlights. We crossed the barren Ash Plain. Above, I could see the red blaze of Mount Yasur reflecting off wet clouds that swirled low above its rim. The air had begun to smell strongly of sulfur, like a million extinguished matches.

Suva, however, bustled. It was the Midtown of the South Pacific. There were Fijians and Indo-Fijians, of course, but also Polynesians, Micronesians, and other Melanesians from the Solomons, Papua New Guinea, and Vanuatu. There were so many Westerners from Australia, New Zealand, North America, and Europe living there that it remained possible, hypothetically, for them to have affairs without the entire expatriate population knowing about it the following morning. There were Chinese farmers ferrying in produce to the covered market, and a large swath of Victoria Parade, the main road in Suva, had been transformed into a strip of Chinese restaurants and nightclubs catering to the hundreds of Asian fishermen who found themselves in town each day as their catch was weighed in port. The United Nations was represented by approximately 130 separate agencies, doing whatever it is that U.N. agencies do. The Indo-Fijian businessmen had their headquarters in Suva, and many firms from Australia and New Zealand maintained offices in town. The government, of course, had its offices in Suva, and its officials could be seen conducting business wearing sulus, the gabardine skirts that only Fijian men can wear with aplomb. The main campus of the University of the South Pacific too was located in Suva—a disappointment, no doubt, to the three or four American students who enrolled there each year, thinking they’d signed on for four years of surfing bliss, and discovered too late that the nearest beach was nearly an hour’s drive away."|"Getting Stoned With Savages"|"J.

As we stepped ashore it became clear that many of the figures lying prone on the beach were sleeping off the excesses of the previous night. Beachcomber Island was, as the kids like to say, a place to party. At least a third of the slumbering bodies had horrific sunburns.

In any event, the captain gave a few curt orders, and the ship turned around and brought its rump toward the pier in an admirable display of seamanship. They might not look like seamen, I thought.
