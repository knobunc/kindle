"> 00:00"|"just past midnight"|"That was, in one form anyway, exactly Rosie’s wish. In August Sam had first experienced something that her doctor thought might be an epileptic seizure, though for a month she’d had no more. Then, just past midnight on the autumn equinox—a night of wild wind—Sam had her second seizure, a worse one than the first, taking hold of her small body and all its contents for nearly a minute, and no doubt about it then. And next day in the splendor of the blue morning, amid a pageant of fast-moving white clouds and the trees still softly gesturing with their turning leaves, Rosie drove Sam again to the doctor’s, and talked long with him; and then went to the drugstore in Blackbury Jambs. So now Sam took a small dose of phenobarbital elixir, three times a day. Too young at barely five to swallow pills. Rosie had the bitter liquid with her, and a little plastic syringe without a needle to draw it up with and squirt it into Sam’s mouth, after a battle, always a battle."|Daemonomania|"John Crowley"
00:00|midnight|"“You might.” It was midnight in August, and still as hot as day; they were naked and neck-deep in the motionless dark waters that fill an abandoned quarry up Mount Merrow."|Daemonomania|"John Crowley"
00:00|midnight|"Pierce had expected that his imaginary son and lover (he had not told Rose about that part) would vanish, fast or slowly, from his life as Rose came farther into it. But Robbie hadn’t gone when Rose came. He had only grown denser, glowed more honey-warm as throughout that summer Pierce and Rose coupled. Indeed he was with them (though seen, or perceived, only by his father) on that same hot midnight at the Mount Merrow quarry. A laughing Caravaggio boy, naked on a stela of granite at the water’s edge, one knee drawn up to rest his cheek on."|Daemonomania|"John Crowley"
00:00|midnight|"In his broad bed in the midnight—not here, but on Maple Street in the Jambs—he had placed the rule on her: Don’t say no to me, Rose. You don’t want to say no. Only yes. Do you understand?"|Daemonomania|"John Crowley"
12:00|noon|"Rose Ryder, awake but undressed, sat unmoving on the edge of her narrow bed in her cabin by the Shadow. At her feet, on the bedroom floor, were many long sheets of paper with waves or cycles drawn on them, crossed by a median line; she had drawn them herself, with compass and rule. They had slipped in the night from the bed where she had left them, and she looked down at them without exactly seeing them. It was to be another perfect cloudless day, tenth in a row, heating the Faraways to summer levels by noon."|Daemonomania|"John Crowley"
12:00|noon|"With the next carriage return, Pierce’s sheet extruded from the machine, toast from a toaster, nicely done, and he inserted another. A fast and tidy penman, Pierce had never learned to type, it was like chopping wood the way he did it, banging down each key in turn with a strong forefinger, tongue between his teeth, he would fall back exhausted by noon having covered no more than four or five sheets."|Daemonomania|"John Crowley"
12:00|noon|"It was noon, and Pierce pulled from the wickerwork étagère beside him (it shared the patio with his desk and chair and a glider upholstered in striped canvas) a bottle of Scotch, and poured an inch into a glass."|Daemonomania|"John Crowley"
"ap 10:02"|"ten two"|"“I just wish you had a damn phone,” Rosie said to Spofford. He was calling her from a pay phone near the job site, his lunch hour; checking in with her, as he did faithfully but irregularly, so that she expected and waited for his calls more than she would have if he had called every day at ten two and four. What Mike called intermittent reinforcement when in psych lab he’d used it on white rats with twitching baffled noses. She knew Spofford wasn’t calculating the effect."|Daemonomania|"John Crowley"

"ap ~ 01:30"|"About half past one"|"About half past one on the twenty-ninth, a man pruning some blooming cherry trees in the garden of their little house called up to Edward Kelley to send the Doctor down; and he went on pruning the cherries, until he reached the end of the garden, and began to walk up into the air and away, with his pruning hook over his shoulder; and when Kelley and Dee went down into the garden they could not find the man."|Daemonomania|"John Crowley"
"ap 01:00"|one|"Like a man with a maid. So that it was always his, John Dee’s, doing, not Kelley’s: his fault, if it was one."|Daemonomania|"John Crowley"
00:00|midnight|"In their curtained bed, awake in the midnight, John and Jane spoke for the first time since they had put their hands to it."|Daemonomania|"John Crowley"
00:00|"midnight that night"|"Though the summer seemed unwilling to pass away, lingering at the threshold like a guest who has had too much fun to leave, Val decided to close the Faraway Lodge on Columbus Day as she always did, last day of the tourist season as it is counted in the Faraways, tourists being however rarely seen at any time in that secluded and not very inviting saloon by the Shadow River. It did have a big electric sign before it (to be shut off at midnight that night till the following year) that told those who happened to come upon it the name: Mama’s Faraway Lodge."|Daemonomania|"John Crowley"
00:00|midnight|"Not ten days after that midnight when she spoke to him from the glass for the first time—only to say Farewell—John Dee wrote in his diary: EK did open the great secret to me, God be thanked!"|Daemonomania|"John Crowley"
"ap 01:00"|one|"By morning he was speaking, alert, cheerful even, his melancholy seemingly lifted already—if indeed it was one. John Dee, hearing his tale, wondered if it had not been a melancholy at all that had taken him but a plain madness."|Daemonomania|"John Crowley"
00:00|midnight|"On Friday midnight the moon would be full. Should they put chains on their wolf?"|Daemonomania|"John Crowley"
00:00|midnight|"The Emperor, in his suit of black decorated richly in black, a midnight sky whereon his jewels burned, stars and planets, put his hand upon the brow of a tall and melancholy dog that sat beside him; the beast lifted his liquid eye to his master."|Daemonomania|"John Crowley"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"Pierce stood before the library on Bridges Street a few minutes before opening time at nine, waiting for the doors to be unlocked by the somewhat flinty-featured but smiling librarian, a silver chain aswing on her glasses, visible to him inside as he no doubt was to her here outside."|Daemonomania|"John Crowley"
12:00|noon|"“Hi Mike,” Beau said, and glanced at the black-cat clock in the kitchen. “You weren’t due till noon.”"|Daemonomania|"John Crowley"
"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"“Hello, Axel.” Only his father. Pierce sat, and breathed again. Axel Moffett at least was changeless: in trouble as usual, it sounded like; at sixes and sevens; buffeted by life, and at sea. As usual. As usual he seemed to be calling from a bar. It was past midnight."|Daemonomania|"John Crowley"
09:00|"nine in the morning"|"Then it was day again, she was going again, her little car already roused and muttering; a cold day, dark at nine in the morning and a searching wind blowing."|Daemonomania|"John Crowley"
02:00|"two at night"|"“Pitt Thurston. You know, he sleeps like an hour or two at night. No more. So I’ve heard. Can you imagine me? You’d be amazed though how good I’m getting. Up and attem.” They swooped off the freeway again, having used it for only a couple of miles, but only to take another big road along which cold bright enterprises were lined up, rain-wet cars in their lots like glossy beetles and the icons of chain restaurants. Pierce thought that if he were king he would make it illegal for restaurants to be advertised by euphoric humanoid versions of the animals to be eaten there, it was just too crassly brutal. A chorus line of pigs, there, each grinning, each wearing a chef’s toque and holding a smoking plate of his own cooked parts. That was where she turned in."|Daemonomania|"John Crowley"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"As soon as he had finished dialing and heard her phone begin to ring, Pierce realized in horror that it was after midnight; he knew he should hang up, but he knew also that he had already awakened her or her house, the damage done, and before he could muster the cowardice to put down the phone a low voice answered. Male, he thought."|Daemonomania|"John Crowley"
06:00|"six in the morning"|"He would ask her, he would. The strong wine of resolution flooded him. He thought of arising now, right now going to the phone while the world slept, and calling her. But no it was absurd, not yet six in the morning, she would be still wrapped in sleep, the sweet sleep they promised her. Anyway, he obviously couldn’t just baldly put his question to her, and especially not over the phone. There was going to have to be some preparation, considering his bizarre, not to say cruel, behavior over the last weeks. He remembered in shame that he had not kissed her, not once during the whole of that time with her in Conurbana. As though she had been in fact the eidolon or demon manufacture that he, standing on her corner in the dawn, had imagined her to be. Instead of merely confused and needy. It was so simple."|Daemonomania|"John Crowley"
00:00|midnight|"“So,” Pierce said. He would not tell her about calling Rhea in the midnight; nor about how the Devil broke the windshield of Rose’s car. Nor how he had wept."|Daemonomania|"John Crowley"
00:00|midnight|"Or they really did put him by, like the cordial a housewife puts by, a whole summer’s fruits distilled and bottled with a cork, to sit on a shelf dusty and neglected, but still potent within. On that very night, or possibly another, John Dee awoke alone in his bed in the midnight, and sought a light, and his paper and his pen."|Daemonomania|"John Crowley"
12:00|noon|"Beau wanted to speak, to ask, but could not; and was answered anyway. As evening came on, he withdrew from Plato’s side with the others, though one or two were allowed to watch through the night. In the morning in their cabins along the track the people stirred up their fires and made beaten biscuits and red gravy, and at noon they heated cans of tomato soup with Pet milk or chunks of Well Far cheese and ate it with crumbled saltines and boiled coffee. No meat though, no ham fried in lard or Swanson’s chicken slid whole and greasy from the can to cook with dumplings, they wouldn’t want to be eating flesh through which the souls of their parents and ancestors and dead children had cycled. They ate their food as silently and ravenously as if they had stolen it, their heads bent together and their spoons and jaws going, and were hungry again soon after, ever hungrier as Plato waned. Beau among them knew that their suffering was perhaps greater even than Plato’s, and as exemplary, and as necessary. From then on, Beau watching people eat would sometimes see not the familiar humans nourishing themselves and their loved ones but instead, in revulsion and pity, would perceive strange unconscious machines laboring at some automatic work, steam robots grinding and processing, the caught spirit sometimes looking out the hungry eyes. That would be his to bear."|Daemonomania|"John Crowley"
12:00|noontime|"“Everything’s strange,” Pierce said. “Or nothing is.” But he thought of it, how on a noontime he had got off the bus on his way to the city of Conurbana; how he had sat in the shade of a great tree, a huge living thing, whose leaves had lifted in a breeze that passed through the valley then; a Little Breeze that stirred his hair and his heart. He thought he had been escaping, escaping at last."|Daemonomania|"John Crowley"
"ap 06:06"|"six six"|"She stood then, and quick before he could speak again she pointed. “You go west on 6,” she said. “That’s all. West on 6, then take 66.”
“Six,” he said, “six six.”
“Bobby,” said the child. “Bobby.”"|Daemonomania|"John Crowley"
00:00|midnight|"The phone’s ring in the midnight lifted Pierce bodily from his bed, like a cartoon animal."|Daemonomania|"John Crowley"
06:00|"six in the morning"|"At The Woods Center for Psychotherapy Sam Mucho was now awake. It was six in the morning, which happened to be the hour at which the big clock in the main lounge had stopped after it had ceased to be wound. She didn’t wonder why she was wide awake so far before everyone else. It had now been sixteen hours since her last dose of medicine."|Daemonomania|"John Crowley"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"Pierce Moffett was not cured, no: for he was awake and thinking in the gulf of darkness after midnight, his eyes open and his heart alert. Thinking about Jesus. It was Solstice Night; the snow falling steadily outside could be sensed more than seen or heard, perhaps lightening the darkness a little, perhaps making a sound in all its soundless alightings."|Daemonomania|"John Crowley"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"Then Time shook himself alert. At two in the morning on the eighteenth, brothers of the Headless John Society assembled at St. Ursula in the depths of night, as was their habit, and made procession to the Tor to awaken the prisoner, to “offer up the winter-prayers” and give comfort and correction, maybe even snatch the man back from the abyss at the last instant. But no, he stayed up through the night with them talking and disputing, “setting his brain and mind to a thousand errors and vaingloryings” (but what were these really? What did he say at the last?) until the Servants of Justice came to take him."|Daemonomania|"John Crowley"
