The rain eased by noon, but it wasn’t until 1:30, well into the partial phase, that the astronomers got their first sight of the sun. For the next several minutes clouds thickened and cleared as totality approached, and Eddington recalled that “We had to carry out our program of photographs in faith.” The team took sixteen exposures, but only the final six held out much promise. Four of those six had to be developed back in England, and of the remaining two, just one had seen clear enough skies to permit preliminary analysis in the field.

Together, the trio continue to watch the new object until it sets at around 2:30 in the morning. True stars remain mere points in even the most powerful telescopes. This does not, showing instead an unmistakable disk, a full 3.2 arcseconds across—just as Le Verrier had told them to expect. That visible circle can mean just one thing: Galle has just become the first man to see what he knows to be a previously undiscovered planet, one that would come to be called Neptune, just about exactly where Urbain-Jean-Joseph Le Verrier told him to look."|"The Hunt for Vulcan"|"Thomas Levenson"

As is his habit, Dr. Lescarbault takes the opportunity to retreat to his observatory. He turns his telescope toward the sun. An object leaps into view: a small, regular dot, just inside the edge, or limb of our star. He makes an estimate of its size: about one quarter the apparent diameter of Mercury. He has just missed its first appearance at the edge of the sun. Working backward from its apparent rate of motion, he estimates the time it crossed the solar limb at almost exactly four o’clock or, to be precise, at 3h 59m 46s P.M., plus or minus five seconds. He writes that down, using a piece of charcoal to scratch on a board. Another patient arrives and, likely with unrecorded frustration, he pulls his eye from his telescope. A few minutes later, he returns. The spot is still there, moving across the face of the sun. He tracks it continuously now, noting its nearest approach to the center of the solar circle, and then the instant and place it disappears over the solar limb. He records the time again: 5h 16m 55s.

"< 00:00"|"before midnight"|"Lescarbault entrusted it to a M. Vallée, “Honorary Inspector General of Roads and Bridges,” for delivery to the obvious recipient, Le Verrier himself. Dated December 22, 1859, it reached Paris a few days later. Le Verrier’s first reaction—as he told it—was one of doubt. But he was prepared to hope. There was only one way to be sure if Lescarbault could possibly have made the observations he claimed to have achieved: meet the man; inspect his instruments; test him. No matter how unlikely it might be that some rural hobbyist could have plucked such a prize, even the possibility that he might made any delay intolerable. Le Verrier was promised to his father-in-law’s for a New Year’s Day celebration—but the train schedules showed that it was just possible that he could get to Orgères and back to Paris before midnight on the 31st. He commandeered Vallée to return with him as a witness, and the two men set out to see if Lescarbault’s “planet” might actually exist."|"The Hunt for Vulcan"|"Thomas Levenson"

By the time he returned to his telescope, the object was gone, “but he has not the slightest doubt of the matter.” Radau and a colleague repeated the by-now familiar exercise, constructing the elements of an orbit from incomplete observations, and they found that Lummis’s potential Vulcan was at least compatible with Lescarbault’s, even if there wasn’t enough data to settle the matter once and for all."|"The Hunt for Vulcan"|"Thomas Levenson"

There is usually only one chance to perform each action; the more complicated or delicate the operation planned, the more opportunities for a fatal error. Newcomb’s own telescope was the first to fall: ten minutes before the start of the eclipse, its clock drive failed “in such a way that it could not be used without taking the clock work all to pieces”—that is to say, with the finality that always seems to attend eclipse astronomy. First contact (the instant the face of the moon touches the edge of the sun) arrived remorselessly at 2:03:16.4 P.M. Newcomb gave up on his mechanical aid and tracked his telescope by hand—a task he made yet more difficult by his choice of a too-powerful eyepiece, one with such a tiny field of view that it made it very hard for Newcomb to be sure just when the eclipse truly began."|"The Hunt for Vulcan"|"Thomas Levenson"

Eclipses dance to a jagged rhythm. First contact shoots a jolt of adrenaline through any witness. What comes next soon becomes kind of dull. It takes about an hour for the moon to reach second contact—the onset of totality. For much of that interval, changes are subtle. Half a sun illuminates the world pretty much as well as the whole disk. Slowly some surreality takes hold. For example, during the partial phase a tree’s crown becomes a camera obscura: the gaps between leaves transmit an image of the crescent sun, bright curves dappling the shadows."|"The Hunt for Vulcan"|"Thomas Levenson"

As soon as the shout came, James Watson fixed the sun in the center of his field of view. From there, he slowly swept due east. At the limit of his predefined search pattern, he moved his telescope one degree down and reversed direction, covering about eight degrees of sky each way. On his first pass, he recognized a familiar star, Delta Cancri. Back on the sun, he repeated the move heading west. Theta Cancri, another star in the constellation Cancer, slid into his eyepiece. There, so early in his run, Watson saw something new. He wrote that between the known star and the sun, “and a little south, I saw a ruddy star whose magnitude I estimated to be 4 1/2.” It was definitely brighter than Theta Cancri, Watson added, “and it did not exhibit any elongation, such as might be expected if it were a comet in that position.”"|"The Hunt for Vulcan"|"Thomas Levenson"

With that he’d completed work that would have been the pride of at least two careers—and when he finally won his Nobel, the prize committee cited his account of the photoelectric effect instead of the more popularly celebrated work to come. But he had one more shot to fire. The last of Einstein’s “big four” papers arrived at the offices of Annalen der Physik on June 30, 1905. It came under a seemingly bland title, “On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies”—which masked the radical, almost subversive idea it contained, what we know as the special theory of relativity. It took him about six weeks to produce it, but once he was done, he was able to express his ideas in astonishingly simple, clear language, almost a story, in which he asks his readers to question what almost no one had ever paused to consider. What does it mean, he asked, to say that an event happens at a certain time? “If,” he wrote, “I say that ‘the train arrives here at 7’o’clock’ that means, more or less, ‘the pointing of the small hand of my clock to 7 and the arrival of the train are simultaneous.’ ” In other words—to describe any event in nature you need a rigorous concept of time: how it is to be measured and how any two people can come to agree on when anything may be said to have happened."|"The Hunt for Vulcan"|"Thomas Levenson"
