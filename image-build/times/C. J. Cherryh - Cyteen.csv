Within those occupational electorates, votes are weighted according to registered level of expertise: i.e., most voters in, say, the Science electorate are factored at one, but a lab tech with a certain number of years’ experience may merit a two; while a scientist of high professional rating may merit as high as ten, depending on professional credentials achieved far this purpose—a considerable difference, since the factors are applied in a formula and each increment is considerable. An individual can always appeal his ranking to peer review, but most advances are virtually set with the job and experience."|Cyteen|"C. J. Cherryh"

The program just pulled that number out of the House computer clock. Your guardian is Denys Nye. The program just accessed your records in the House data bank and found that out, and it can tell you that Denys ordered pasta for lunch today, because it just accessed Denys’ records and found out the answer to that specific question. It knows you’re 9 years old and therefore it’s set a limit on your keycard accesses, so you can’t order Security to arrest anybody or sell 9000 Alpha genesets to Cyteen Station. Remembering what I was like at 9, that seems like a reasonable precaution."|Cyteen|"C. J. Cherryh"

"ap 10:00"|10|"So when you get that feeling, you think real clearly whether you can afford to give in to it and whether you’re able to handle it without getting your whole life slanted in some direction that isn’t smart. The time to give in to that feeling is when you can afford to, just the same as you don’t spend money you haven’t got, promise things you don’t have time to do, or get involved in projects you can’t finish. If it’s a minor thing and nobody can get hurt, fine, do it. If it’s got complications, don’t do it until you know damn well you can handle it, and know how far the complications can possibly extend. At 10, you can’t see everything. I was there. Believe me, I know. I got involved with somebody once, and I really liked him; unfortunately, he wasn’t as smart as I am, and he wanted to tell me what to do and how to run my life, because he sensed I really was hooked on him, and he really liked ordering people around. So do I, of course. So when I got that figured out, which took longer than usual, because neurons work logic problems a hell of a lot faster than glands—I’m being facetious—anyway, I told him off, I reversed what was going on, and he hated it like hell. Hated me after that, too. So not only did the feeling go away, I lost a friend who would have stayed a friend if I hadn’t let him do a power-move on me. I’m telling you about it now because you can learn about fire two ways: put your hand in it and understand it with the neurons below your neck or listen to me tell you about it and understand it with the ones up in your head. Your brain is the operations center that has to keep your hand out of the fire in the first place, so if you can believe me, and use the sense you were born with, you can save yourself all the pain and embarrassment of a real lesson."|Cyteen|"C.
