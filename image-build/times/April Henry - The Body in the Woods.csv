Gene Paulson, spokesman for the Portland Police Bureau, authorities were called to the scene about 2 p.m. by a park ranger who had found the body in a wooded area, just south of the reservoir.

While she waited for the doors to be unlocked, she covertly surveyed the people waiting on the stone steps. A mom with two little kids. A gray-haired old lady with a stack of books. But it was the others Alexis focused on. The girl in front of her wore her hair in two high pigtails, and one of her sneakers flapped at the toe. The guy next to her had black pants hacked off at mid-shin. His red socks didn’t match in length or hue. Both he and Pigtail Girl smelled. It wasn’t just BO but the smell of clothes that had layers of dirt and spilled food ground into them."|"The Body in the Woods"|"April Henry"

Led by Jon, Team One was going to take the most likely route, the one that matched up with the cell phone pings, the one George had started up before he got lost. When the van stopped to let them out, it was eight forty-five, and a light snow was falling."|"The Body in the Woods"|"April Henry"

But why would he want it? It was at least three generations behind, awkward and heavy compared with the phones rich people had. And he was rich. He threw away food without thinking about it, had big piles of new hardcover books, and kept the house as warm as if was spring outside, not closing in on winter."|"The Body in the Woods"|"April Henry"

From the back seat where she was between Alexis and Nick, Ruby was keeping an eye on Chris’s driving. He seemed to still have appropriate reflexes. But at sixty-five miles an hour, things could go south very fast. To soothe herself, she ran her finger up and down the seam of her Gore-Tex hiking pants."|"The Body in the Woods"|"April Henry"

While she didn’t expect that they would see him at three thirty on a Sunday afternoon, right now they were laying the groundwork so that, with a little luck, they could spot him Tuesday, exactly one week after Miranda had been murdered."|"The Body in the Woods"|"April Henry"

Her mouth watering, she showed her mom’s photo to everyone in line, with no success. The food was heaped in clear plastic tubs like the ones where her mom kept her scrapbooking supplies. There was no place to sit, so Alexis stood hunched over a plate of stew ladled onto mashed potatoes, enjoying every warm, steamy bite."|"The Body in the Woods"|"April Henry"
