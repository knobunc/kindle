10:45|"10:45 a.m."|"The colorful chaos of the old-time pier is nowhere in evidence at a major container terminal, the brawny longshoremen carrying bags of coffee on their shoulders nowhere to be seen. Terry Malloy, the muscular hero played by Marlon Brando in On the Waterfront, would not be at home. Almost every one of the intricate movements required to service a vessel is choreographed by a computer long before the ship arrives. Computers, and the vessel planners who use them, determine the order in which the containers are to be discharged, to speed the process without destabilizing the ship. The actions of the container cranes and the equipment in the yard all are programmed in advance. The longshoreman who drives each machine faces a screen telling him which container is to be handled next and where it is to be moved—unless the terminal dispenses with longshoremen by using driverless transporters to pick up the containers at shipside and centrally controlled stacker cranes to handle container storage. The computers have determined that the truck picking up incoming container ABLQ 998435 should be summoned to the terminal at 10:45 a.m., and that outgoing container JKFC 119395, a 40-foot box bound for Newark, carrying 56,800 pounds of machinery and currently stacked at yard location A-52- G-6, will be loaded third from the bottom in the fourth slot in the second row of the forward hold. They have ensured that the refrigerated containers are placed in bays with electrical hookups, and that containers with hazardous contents are apart from containers that could increase the risk of explosion. The entire operation runs like clockwork, with no tolerance for error or human foibles. Within twenty-four hours, the ship discharges its thousands of containers, takes on thousands more, and steams on its way."|"The Box"|"Marc Levinson"

The Australians called it the pick-up. The British had a more descriptive name: the scramble. In most places, the process involved begging, flattery, and kickbacks to get a day’s work. In 1930s Edinburgh, “[t]he foremen got up on the platform about five tae eight in the mornin’ and it wis jus a mad scramble for a damned job,” remembered Scottish longshoreman George Baxter. The same had been true in Portland, Oregon: “They would hire their gangs and maybe you would be on that dock at seven o’clock Tuesday morning. And maybe that ship would get in at nine o’clock Tuesday night. But you didn’t dare leave. You were hired, but you weren’t getting paid.” In Marseilles, the workday in 1947 began at 6:30 in Place de la Juliette, where workers milled on the sidewalks in the winter darkness until a foreman made a sign to the workers he wanted; the chosen could proceed to a nearby cafe to await the start of work, while the others went looking for another foreman. In San Francisco, men shaped on the sidewalk near the Ferry Building. In Liverpool, they congregated beneath the concrete structure of the “dockers’ umbrella,” more formally known as the Liverpool Overhead Railway, and waited for a foreman to come and tap them on the shoulder."|"The Box"|"Marc Levinson"

19:52|1952|"Pressure from labor unions and governments gradually eliminated some of the worst excesses of the shape-up. On the U.S. Pacific coast, employers lost control of the hiring process after a bitter strike in 1934; thereafter, the order of hiring was determined by the public drawing of longshoremen’s badge numbers each morning in the shelter of a union-controlled hiring hall. The Australian Stevedoring Board took over longshore work assignments after World War II, and the creation of Britain’s National Dock Labour Board in 1947 did away with the scramble. In Rotterdam, violent strikes over working conditions in 1945 and 1946 persuaded employers that they were better off with full-time staff than with occasional labor; by 1952, more than half the port’s longshoremen worked regularly for a single company. New Zealand and France started government agencies to regulate longshore hiring. The Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor, created by the states of New York and New Jersey to fight corruption on the docks, took charge of hiring in the Port of New York in 1953."|"The Box"|"Marc Levinson"

"> 17:00"|"after 5 p.m."|"Delivering by truck meant engaging a “public loader,” a type of enterprise unique to New York. A public loader was a gang that claimed the sole right to load and unload trucks on a particular pier, backed by the muscle of the International Longshoremen’s Association, the dockworkers’ union. Shipping interests, mayors, governors, and the Teamsters union, which wanted its members to handle the work, had tried for decades to get rid of public loaders. The men who did the loading were members of a thoroughly corrupt ILA branch, Local 1757, and were ostensibly owners of the “cooperative” for which they worked. In reality, however, the public loaders were secretly controlled by leaders of the ILA, which had joined forces with a trucking organization to create a “Truck Loading Authority” that published “official” rates for loading—5½ cents per 100-pound bag of almonds or marble chips; 6½ cents per 100 pounds of auto parts, tires, or fish guts; 8 cents per 100 pounds of canned beer—with all hours after 5 p.m. paid at time-and-a-half. Other firms that sought to handle unloading encountered vandalism and outright violence. Shippers that tried to circumvent the public loaders’ illicit monopoly by using their own workers to unload were liable to find that the ship would sail with their cargo sitting on the pier. Even after the newly established Waterfront Commission banned public loaders in December 1953, thugs continued to control access to the docks."|"The Box"|"Marc Levinson"
"ap < 00:58"|"nearly two to one"|"The caucus demanded numerous changes before sending the draft for a membership vote. More than one-third of the ILWU’s members voted no. Some opponents, such as San Francisco’s famed longshoreman-philosopher Eric Hoffer, were outraged on ideological grounds. “This generation has no right to give away, or sell for money, conditions that were handed on to us by a previous generation,” Hoffer stormed. Dockers in Los Angeles, still angry that Bridges had interfered in their local labor dispute and upset about the loss of work unstuffing and restuffing containers, rejected it by nearly two to one. The local in Seattle backed Bridges; so did his home local in San Francisco, where the unusually old workforce—nearly two-thirds of San Francisco longshoremen were 45 or older—liked the retirement provisions. Members in those two cities provided most of the votes to approve the contract."|"The Box"|"Marc Levinson"
19:57|1957|"In July 1954, the mighty Pennsylvania Railroad began service between New York and Chicago with 50-foot flatcars carrying a single trailer apiece. Within months, its daily TrucTrains to Chicago and St. Louis, equipped with new 75-foot flatcars, were carrying hundreds of trailers each way. The Pennsy signed up 150 motor carriers to pick up and deliver the trailers, and soon had a $100-million-a-year business. It created a research-and-development department—a highly unusual step for a railroad—and charged it with improving TrucTrain. The biggest hurdle, TrucTrain’s managers decided, was that the Pennsy could not transfer loaded cars to many connecting railroads. In November 1955, TrucTrain was incorporated as Trailer Train Company, and other railroads were invited to buy in. The idea was simple: instead of each railroad’s operating its own small trailer business, Trailer Train would handle truck trailers nationwide. It would own the flatcars, collect revenue from truck lines, and pay the railroads to haul its cars over their tracks. At the end of the year, any profit would be divided among the railroads that had become shareholders. Trailer Train started small, operating barely 500 flat-cars in 1956. Other railroads quickly joined the enterprise, allowing Trailer Train to gain economies of scale beyond the reach of individual railroads. By 1957, the company was buying a fleet of 85-foot flatcars, enabling it to boost efficiency by carrying two of the new 40-foot truck trailers on a single car."|"The Box"|"Marc Levinson"
