12:00|noon|"Devlin nodded, reminding him that he was expected back aboard the Defiance in a week’s time to set sail at noon, with all three hundred of his men. His rate of desertion was almost zero, an astonishing fact that no one in the British navy could understand. But then, with so many spoils taken and shared, his crew were all well off."|"The Prize"|"Brenda Joyce"
00:00|midnight|"Tyrell de Warenne, heir to the earldom of Adare and Devlin’s stepbrother, strode down the path to meet him. Like his father, Ty was tall and swarthy with midnight-black hair and extremely dark blue eyes. The two men, as different as night and day, embraced."|"The Prize"|"Brenda Joyce"
12:00|midday|"Oh God, she thought, blinking into bright midday sunlight. And trembling, a new tension filling her, she looked at the hand on her waist."|"The Prize"|"Brenda Joyce"
"~ 20:05"|"about twenty-five"|"Fiona had stopped fussing with the bed. Virginia turned away from the window and found the other woman staring at her with open hostility. She was, Virginia thought, about twenty-five. “I should like some sandwiches and tea,” Virginia said as if she were Sarah Lewis and back at the Marmott School for Genteel Young Ladies."|"The Prize"|"Brenda Joyce"
00:00|midnight|"She had to admire him as well. With his midnight hair and pale gray eyes, he was every bit as handsome as his older brother. Like Devlin, he was tall, broad of shoulder, long of leg and lean of hip. His body looked every bit as muscled and toned. “I would love a glass of champagne,” she said."|"The Prize"|"Brenda Joyce"
12:00|noon|"It was noon. She had not been able to sleep until dawn and had overslept as a result. Carefully dressed in a high-necked gray gown, Virginia went downstairs, filled with tension, so nervous she felt sick. Were they lovers now? Was she Devlin O’Neill’s lover?"|"The Prize"|"Brenda Joyce"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"“Now?” She knew it was seven and they always dined precisely on the hour."|"The Prize"|"Brenda Joyce"
00:00|midnight|"She sat up. It was midnight. She had tried to go to sleep two hours ago, but her mind had refused to cooperate. No longer confused, she remained scared, the feeling distinct, as if she were standing on a cliff high above a lake, preparing to dive into icy, unknown depths far below. All she could think of was what she was doing. Did she really think to beat him at his game? Did she really think to win his friendship? Did she have a chance of making him fall in love with her? And how in God’s name were they going to share a room? She could think of little else than a far better way of spending the night in the same bedroom together—even though her resolve not to leap into his bed remained."|"The Prize"|"Brenda Joyce"
12:00|noon|"Virginia had awoken that morning quite late, as it had taken her hours to still her mind and fall asleep, and the bedroom had been empty. It was now noon and she had been strolling the back lawns, finally pausing on the small terrace behind the house. She smiled at Tompkins. “Callers?”"|"The Prize"|"Brenda Joyce"
"~ 17:00"|"about five o’clock in the afternoon"|"It was about five o’clock in the afternoon. Virginia’s smile was plastered with sheer willpower upon her face. There had been four other callers since the Pauleys, three couples and the village parson. There had been five teas, five conversations, five long and interminable acts. Five smiles, five kisses and perhaps fifty “darlings” exchanged between them both. Sometime between noon and now, her heart had frozen over, all emotion simply replaced with one, dread. Virginia stood frozen on the threshold of the parlor, all three men staring at her."|"The Prize"|"Brenda Joyce"

“We’ll leave at seven tomorrow evening,” he said.

"< 12:00"|"almost noon"|"VIRGINIA HESITATED OUTSIDE of the closed library door where she had been told that Devlin was. It was almost noon and she had recently awoken. She could think of nothing other than her lover. Last night he had made love to her. She knew it the way she knew that the air she breathed was filled with oxygen. Everything had changed between them. She hardly knew why—she only knew she had to race back into his welcoming arms, to make sure the night had not been a dream."|"The Prize"|"Brenda Joyce"
12:00|noon|"He finally pushed the page away. Where the hell was Virginia, anyway? He understood that last night she had pleaded a headache and had taken a supper tray in her room. Her avoidance of him had been to his advantage, then, too—he had hardly wished to speak with her so shortly after agreeing to their marriage. But it was noon, another day, and he felt quite certain that she had not come downstairs for breakfast, either. Virginia did not loll about her bed. What was more likely was that she had gone out at dawn for a long walk. In any case, she continued to avoid him, and now he felt pressured to meet with her and discuss the fact of their future. Surely they could structure an arrangement that suited them both. He felt it urgent to do so, and he intended to put her on notice that little would change in their relationship except for her official title. And as important, surely she was pleased with the impending nuptials—surely she no longer hated him."|"The Prize"|"Brenda Joyce"
"ap < 01:00"|"almost one"|"When Hughes was gone, he glanced at the bronze clock on his desk. Now it was almost one. He went to the door. “Benson?” he called."|"The Prize"|"Brenda Joyce"
12:00|noon|"It was noon. Virginia knew what day it was—she kept track of the days with the morbid fascination of a prisoner on his way to the guillotine. It was December 9—in three more days she would be walking down the aisle. Her stomach tightened at the thought, and it was a painful stabbing in her gut."|"The Prize"|"Brenda Joyce"
05:30|"five-thirty in the morning"|"“What is it you wish to speak about at five-thirty in the morning?” There was some dry amusement in his tone."|"The Prize"|"Brenda Joyce"
05:02|"5:02 a.m."|"It was 5:02 a.m., December 14. In another fifty-eight minutes he would set sail for America. He did not want to leave his bride; he did not want to go."|"The Prize"|"Brenda Joyce"
05:30|"half-past five that morning"|"But as she threw off the blanket, she saw that she was alone. “Devlin?” She began to feel hollow inside and sick with apprehension. She slid to the floor, beginning to shiver. The bronze clock on one bureau said it was half-past five that morning."|"The Prize"|"Brenda Joyce"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"It was the evening of her birthday, perhaps five o’clock. A fire blazed in the hearth beneath the handsome carved mantel there, where Edward stood with Tyrell, Cliff, Devlin and Sean. The men sipped champagne and chatted quietly, occasionally laughing at one or another remark. Devlin had never been more splendid or handsome, clad in his civilian clothes. He sensed her gaze and half turned, smiling at her. Virginia smiled back, suddenly filled with desire."|"The Prize"|"Brenda Joyce"
00:00|midnight|"“Why not?” Virginia smiled a little. Maybe a stroll through the quiet town would help her to get her mind off of Devlin. His strange midnight visit had given her so much to think about and so much hope."|"The Prize"|"Brenda Joyce"
12:00|"HIGH NOON"|"IT WAS HIGH NOON WHEN THEY arrived atop a ridge that overlooked the British fort at Kilmallock. Devlin’s spirits faltered as he looked past the wood stockades and over a sea of white tents and redcoats. Flags marked the commanding officer’s quarters, well in the midst of the fort. Immediately, Devlin thought about how he and Sean, two young boys, could enter the fort. Had he been taller, he would have killed a soldier for his uniform. However, now he considered the possibility that they could simply walk through those open front gates with a wagon, a convoy or a group of soldiers, as they were both so small and unthreatening."|"The Prize"|"Brenda Joyce"
