12:00|midday|"The train was slowing up. It crossed another river, and for a moment they caught a glimpse of moored houseboats with smoke from their chimneys where people were cooking midday meals, an old mill, and a bridge, and a lot of masts beyond it. And then the train had come to a stop at Wroxham station."|"Coot Club"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 05:10"|"Ten past five"|"“Ten past five,” said the woman eagerly. “I know it was, because I was boiling eggs, and looked at the clock just when Ronald shouted that we were floating down the river.…”"|"Coot Club"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 05:10"|"Ten past five"|"“Ten past five,” said Mr. Tedder slowly. “Why from five o’clock all these boys was doin’ a bit o’ weedin’ in my patch, an’ gettin’ worrams for to make a bab … for liftin’ eels.… Couldn’t ’a been this boy cast you adrift. Why, ’twas all but dark when they go home with their worrams.…”"|"Coot Club"|"Arthur Ransome"

"ap 05:10"|"ten past five"|"“But I tell you we’d had them round earlier with some tale about a blasted bird.”
“They was in my patch at ten past five,” said Mr. Tedder doggedly.
“It must have been some other boy,” said the thin man the other had called “James”."|"Coot Club"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"Dorothea looked gratefully up, and there was Mrs. Dudgeon at one of the upper windows. That was all right. No need to explain to a stranger. Mrs. Dudgeon was probably tucking up the baby, after taking him in from the garden. It was only four o’clock, but already not so warm as it had been. And now Mrs. Dudgeon was coming down. The moment had come when the bad news had to be broken to her."|"Coot Club"|"Arthur Ransome"
12:00|mid-day|"Everything went extremely well, and when they tied up in the mouth of Meadow Dyke for their mid-day meal, the Admiral left Dorothea in charge of the cooking, and settled down in the cabin to write a rather boastful letter to her brother."|"Coot Club"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"TOM woke, remembered that the Titmouse was in the dyke at home, looked at his watch, saw that it was close on six o’clock, and, a moment later, had wriggled out of his sleeping-bag and was scrambling ashore bare-footed and in his pyjamas to have a look at the weather. The grass, wet with dew, promised well. Already there was a stirring in the leaves of the willows. Tom looked up at the gable of the house. The golden bream above the thatched roof sent him hurrying back into the Titmouse. It was heading north-west. There could not be a better wind for the voyage. North-west would be a fair wind all the way to Yarmouth, not bad for Breydon Water, and a fair wind again for most of the Waveney. With that wind, if only it held, and if they got down to Yarmouth by low water, there was no knowing how far they might not get before night. In two minutes he was dressed, stowing his dew-soaked awning, and unstepping his mast. Then he tiptoed round the house and looked up. Everybody was asleep. Good-byes had been said the night before, but he listened almost hopefully. If our baby happened to be kicking up a row his mother would be awake, and he could softly call her to the window. But our baby was asleep. There was not a sound except from the starlings who had, as usual, picked their way in and made a nest in the thatch. Tom poled the Titmouse quietly out of the dyke, and paddled silently upstream through the rising mist. The last of the flood tide was holding up the stream. The sooner the Teasel was off the better, to make use of the whole of the ebb. What about the others? Would young Dick have had the sense to look out at the weather and wake them up?"|"Coot Club"|"Arthur Ransome"
06:45|"6.45 a.m."|"“Sailed 6.45 a.m.,” said the Admiral. “Within a minute or two. Anyhow, I’ve put it down.”"|"Coot Club"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 09:01"|nine-one|"“Never mind about keeping things hot, Mrs. McGinty. I’ll have to be gone in a minute.… Hallo! Hallo! Hallo! Is that Norwich Ten-sixty-six? Norwich.… One-owe-double-six.… Hallo! Yes. I said so. Engaged? Can’t be engaged. Private exchange. Please ring them again. Give them another ring. A long one. Hallo! Hallo! Is that Norwich One-owe-double-six? Oh. Wrong number. Ring off please.… Hallo! Exchange? Oh, please ring off. Exchange? … Hallo! Hallo! … Bring me a cup of coffee out here, somebody.… Hallo! Exchange! Gave me a wrong number. No. No. Not one-double-six. One-owe-double-six. Thank you, Bessie. Take care, Nell. Don’t make me take too big a mouthful. I’ve got to be able to talk to these dunderheaded nincompoops. Hallo! Oh, is that you, Walters? Thank goodness for that. Nip round to the office and get me all the papers in that Bollington business. Consultations on it this week. Yes.… All in the folder. And the deeds.… Yes, yes. Bring the whole lot down to the station. Coming in by car. You’ll get it garaged after I’ve gone. I’ve got to catch the nine-one. Right. Good man. Everything on the case.…” He hung up the receiver, took another mouthful of buttered egg from Starboard, washed it down with a drink of coffee offered him by Port, and hurried back to the dining-room."|"Coot Club"|"Arthur Ransome"
12:00|noon|"For the first moment after stepping off the steep companion ladder, Port and Starboard could hardly see. Then, gradually, their eyes grew accustomed to the twilight below decks. There was Mrs. Whittle, bending over an oil-stove and turning up the wick so that flames flickered out from under the kettle. “The cooking stove’s forrard,” she was saying, “but we ’ave this ’ere for convenience. That? That’s Jack’s darling in there. That’s the engine-room. Spoilt our state-room it ’as, putting that in. And taken most of the light. Jack’s darling, I call it. The time ’e spends on that engine polishing and oiling, you wouldn’t believe. Use it? Not ’im. ’E’s bin in sail all ’is life, Jack ’as, and ’e makes it ’is pride to use no petrol what ’e can’t ’elp. But polishing and oiling, ’e’s at it morning, noon an’ night.”"|"Coot Club"|"Arthur Ransome"
08:45|"8.45 a.m."|"They found the post office, with the mail van waiting outside it, so, to Tom’s delight, they were able to get their post cards off by the early post. They sent pictures of Beccles to the twins, to Mrs. Dudgeon, and to the three small Coots of the Death and Glory. “Burgh St. Peter last night. Beccles this morning, 8.45 a.m.,” wrote Tom triumphantly, on his post cards to the twins. “Wish you were here,” he added, finding there was a little room left on each card."|"Coot Club"|"Arthur Ransome"
01:00|"one that morning"|"Here they bought a large fruit cake and some buns. Then they found the butcher’s, and bought some chops that the butcher said would be very good ones. He had had one that morning for his own breakfast. They bought onions, a cauliflower and some oranges from the greengrocer. Dorothea wanted to see the house where the Admiral had been born, but it had long ago been pulled down, and where the old garden had been was a big new shop with enormous plate glass windows. Mrs. Barrable went in, quite heartlessly, Dorothea thought, and bought a new BB pencil. Then they went to have a look at the church, which is built, so to speak, in two bits, the tower in one bit and the rest of the church in another. They had a fine view out over the country from the wall of the churchyard. Then, tired with wandering round, they went back to “Ye Olde Cake Shoppe” and had coffee and biscuits, after which, with most of the morning gone, they set off back to the Teasel."|"Coot Club"|"Arthur Ransome"

You’ll have to come through Yarmouth tomorrow if the twins are to be in time. Do you think you can manage it?… If not they’d better come by train or bus. Brundall, you said, didn’t you?”"|"Coot Club"|"Arthur Ransome"
