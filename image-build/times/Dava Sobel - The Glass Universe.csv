It measured about the same dimensions as a picture frame, eight inches by ten, and no thicker than a windowpane. It was coated on one side with a fine layer of photographic emulsion, which now held several thousand stars fixed in place, like tiny insects trapped in amber. One of the men had stood outside all night, guiding the telescope to capture this image, along with another dozen in the pile of glass plates that awaited her when she reached the observatory at 9 a.m. Warm and dry indoors in her long woolen dress, she threaded her way among the stars. She ascertained their positions on the dome of the sky, gauged their relative brightness, studied their light for changes over time, extracted clues to their chemical content, and occasionally made a discovery that got touted in the press. Seated all around her, another twenty women did the same."|"The Glass Universe"|"Dava Sobel"

Barker of the University of Pennsylvania. Barker, who was preparing a biographical memoir of Henry, had been the Drapers’ houseguest at the time of the Academy dinner. Late that night, when Henry was seized with a violent chill while bathing, it was Barker who helped lift him from the tub and carry him to the bedroom. Then he bid the Drapers’ neighbor and physician Dr. Metcalfe, another dinner guest, to return to the house immediately. Dr. Metcalfe diagnosed double pleurisy. Although Henry of course received the most tender nursing—and showed some brief promise of improvement—the infection spread to his heart. On Sunday the doctor noted the signs of pericarditis, which precipitated Henry’s death at about four o’clock Monday morning, the twentieth of November."|"The Glass Universe"|"Dava Sobel"

It received no support from the college to pay salaries, purchase supplies, or publish the results of its labors. Aside from interest on its endowment and income from its exact-time service, the observatory depended entirely on private bequests and contributions. A decade had passed since the last solicitation for funds. Pickering soon convinced some seventy astronomy enthusiasts to pledge $50 to $200 per year for five years, and while those subscriptions trickled in, he sold the grass cuttings from the six-acre observatory grounds at a small profit. (They brought in about $30 a year, or enough to cover some 120 hours’ worth of computing time.)"|"The Glass Universe"|"Dava Sobel"

On one of those humid July nights, undone by overcast skies, the two of them had quit the observatory around midnight to retire.

Pickering re-created the drama later in his journal, in the present tense: “They don’t want to come, as the thermometer is nearly 100, and point to Turner, who is asleep. I wake him up, and make them all attend the meeting in my drawing room. It is so hot they cannot contribute their portions of the report. As a result of our labors (and heavy labors, too) we all agree on a system of photographic magnitudes which will probably be the system of the world. I am repaid for my journey of two thousand miles, had I done nothing else. Astronomers very kind and complimentary, and Schwarzschild gives up his (Potsdam) system and accepts that of Harvard. My part in this will be regarded as one of the most important things I have ever done.” Thus the acceptance of the Harvard Photometry standard, one of Pickering’s top goals for the trip, became a fait accompli before the train crossed the Great Divide."|"The Glass Universe"|"Dava Sobel"
