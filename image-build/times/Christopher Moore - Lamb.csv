00:00|Midnight|"Midnight. The angel stood on a barren hillside on the outskirts of the holy city of Jerusalem. He raised his arms aloft and a dry wind whipped his white robe around him."|Lamb|"Christopher Moore"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"I was mortified. At ten a boy was expected to start learning his father’s trade, but that was a year away—forever when you’re nine. “I—I am still thinking about what I will do when I grow up,” I said. My own father had made a similar offer to Joshua the day before."|Lamb|"Christopher Moore"
12:00|noon|"The next day we met the angel for the first time. Mary and Joseph said that Joshua had left the house at dawn and they hadn’t seen him since. I wandered around the village most of the morning, looking for Joshua and hoping to run into Maggie. The square was alive with talk of the walking dead woman, but neither of my friends was to be found. At noon my mother recruited me to watch my little brothers while she went to work with the other women in the vineyard. She returned at dusk, smelling of sweat and sweet wine, her feet purple from walking in the winepress. Cut loose, I ran all over the hilltop, checking in our favorite places to play, and 36  z  C h r i s t o p h e r   M o o r  e finally found Joshua on his knees in an olive grove, rocking back and forth as he prayed. He was soaked in sweat and I was afraid he might have a fever. Strange, I never felt that sort of concern for my own brothers, but from the beginning, Joshua filled me with divinely inspired worry."|Lamb|"Christopher Moore"
01:00|"one, am"|"“I for one, am excited,” I said. “I’m ready to cut some stone. Stand back, Josh, my chisel is on fire. Life is stretched out before us like a great bazaar, and I can’t wait to taste the sweets to be found there.”"|Lamb|"Christopher Moore"
"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"“A Roman soldier was murdered last night. There will be no work today, now you both go home and stay there. Tell your mothers to keep 66  z  C h r i s t o p h e r   M o o r  e the children in today. If the Romans don’t find the killer there’ll be soldiers in Nazareth before noon.”"|Lamb|"Christopher Moore"
12:00|noon|"“Just so,” said Ahmad. “We will stay at an inn tonight. Tomorrow I will take you to Balthasar. If we leave early we can be there by noon, then you’ll be the magician’s problem, not mine. Meet me in front at dawn.”"|Lamb|"Christopher Moore"
12:00|noon|"We rode out of Kabul and into the hills until we entered a labyrinth of canyons, which meandered through rugged mountains that looked as if 142  z  C h r i s t o p h e r   M o o r  e they might have been shaped by God out of clay, then left to bake in the sun until the clay had turned to a deep golden color that reflected light in a spray that ate up shadows and destroyed shade. By noon I had no sense whatsoever of what direction we were traveling, nor could I have sworn that we weren’t retracing our path through the same canyons over and over, but Ahmad’s black guards seemed to know their way. Eventually they led us around a bend to a sheer canyon wall, two hundred feet tall, that stood out from the other canyon walls in that there were windows and balconies carved into it. It was a palace hewn out of solid rock. At the base stood an ironclad door that looked as if it would take twenty men to move."|Lamb|"Christopher Moore"
12:00|midday|"156  z  C h r i s t o p h e r   M o o r  e At midday, Joy would take a break while two or more of the other girls squoze me over the latrine, poured more broth into me, and then teased me mercilessly until Joy returned, clapped her hands, and sent them away well scolded. ( Joy was the bull-ox concubine of them all, despite her tiny feet.)"|Lamb|"Christopher Moore"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"“cutthroat discount” after midnight to promote business). The old wizard had fallen asleep to the rhythm of his camel’s loping gait, an act that nearly baffled Joshua as much as the whole demon business, as he spent most of his time on camelback trying not to upchuck—seasickness of the desert, they call it."|Lamb|"Christopher Moore"
"> 12:00"|"past noon"|"Gaspar made us wait two months before taking us on the special meditation pilgrimage, so it was well into winter before we made that monumental trek. Snow fell so deep on the mountainside that we literally had to tunnel our way out to the courtyard every morning for exercise. Before we were allowed to begin, Joshua and I had to shovel all of the snow out of the courtyard, which meant that some days it was well past noon before we were able to start drilling. Other days the wind whipped down out of the mountains so viciously that we couldn’t see more than a few inches past our faces, and Gaspar would devise exercises that we could practice inside."|Lamb|"Christopher Moore"
00:00|midnight|"“They will hold her until midnight on the night of the feast, then slaughter her with the other children on the wooden elephants of Kali.”"|Lamb|"Christopher Moore"
00:00|midnight|"“And eat her,” said Rumi, hanging his head. “At midnight on the night of the feast they will take her and the other children and tie them to the wooden elephants. They will cut off the children’s fingers and give one to the head of each Brahman household. Then they will catch her blood in a cup and everyone in the household will taste it. They may eat the finger or bury it for good luck. After that the children are hacked to death on the wooden elephants.”"|Lamb|"Christopher Moore"
00:00|midnight|"“Then we have to find them ourselves,” Joshua said.
“We know where they’re going to be at midnight, we’ll get them then.”
“I say we find these Brahmans and force them to stop the whole festival.”"|Lamb|"Christopher Moore"
00:00|midnight|"It was still hours from the height of the ceremony at midnight, when the children would be hacked to death, but we wanted to be there in time to stop the revelers from cutting off the children’s fingers if we could."|Lamb|"Christopher Moore"
12:00|noon|"to find a job, but by noon I found myself sitting on the street next to one of the blind, no-legged beggar kids. The street was packed with traders, haggling, making deals, exchanging cash for goods and services, and the kid was making a killing on the spare change. I was astounded at the amount in the kid’s bowl; there must have been enough for three Kama Sutra pages right there. Not that I would steal from a blind kid."|Lamb|"Christopher Moore"
"ap 05:00"|five|"My brothers Shem and Lucius brought their families and joined us for dinner and we all lay around the table as Mother served us something nice, I’m not sure what it was. (I know I’ve said that I was the oldest of three brothers, and obviously, with the squirts, it was five, but dammit, by the time I met Japeth and Moses I was too old to have the time to torment them, so they never really paid their dues as brothers."|Lamb|"Christopher Moore"
"ap 01:15"|"Three quarters of two"|"“What?” I replied.
“I just did the math. Three quarters of two is—”
“One and a half,” said the new guy, who had moved into the pit on the other side of Josh. “So John’s either all crazy and you’re half crazy, or you’re three-quarters crazy and John’s three-quarters crazy, or—well—"|Lamb|"Christopher Moore"
00:00|midnight|"It was midnight. The party had wound down and the disciples and I were sitting in the street outside of the house. Joshua had passed out and Bartholomew had put a small dog under his head for a pillow. Before he had left, James had made it abundantly clear that we weren’t welcome in Nazareth."|Lamb|"Christopher Moore"
12:00|noon|"“Good thing you’re an apostle,” I said. “You’ll have that healed up by noon.”"|Lamb|"Christopher Moore"
12:00|noon|"“We’d better go,” said Joseph, looking out the window at the sky.
“They’ll bring him out at noon.”
A crowd had gathered outside of the praetorium, but most were merely curious; only a few of the Pharisees, among them Jakan, had actually come out to see Joshua executed. I stayed back, almost a half-block away, watching. The other disciples were spread out, wearing shawls or turbans that covered their faces. Peter had sent Bartholomew to sit with Maggie and Mary at the tomb. No shawl could disguise his bulk or his stench."|Lamb|"Christopher Moore"
12:00|noon|"Three heavy crossbeams leaned against the wall outside the palace gates, waiting for their victims. At noon Joshua was brought out along with two thieves who had also been sentenced to death, and the beams were placed upon their shoulders. Joshua was bleeding from a dozen places on his head and face, and although he still wore the purple robe that Herod had placed on him, I could see that blood from the flogging had run down and left streaks on his legs. He still looked like he was in some sort of trance, but there was no question that he was feeling the pain of his wounds. The crowd closed in on him, shouting insults and spitting on him, but I noticed that when he stumbled, someone always lifted him to his feet. His followers were still scattered among the crowd, they were just afraid to show themselves."|Lamb|"Christopher Moore"
