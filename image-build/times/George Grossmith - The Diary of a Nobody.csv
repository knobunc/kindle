and putting a few things straight; but two of our principals at the
office were absent through illness, and I did not get home till
seven.  Found Borset waiting.  He had been three times
during the day to apologise for his conduct last night.  He
said he was unable to take his Bank Holiday last Monday, and took
it last night instead.  He begged me to accept his apology,
and a pound of fresh butter.  He seems, after all, a decent
sort of fellow; so I gave him an order for some fresh eggs, with a
request that on this occasion they should be fresh.  I
am afraid we shall have to get some new stair-carpets after all;
our old ones are not quite wide enough to meet the paint on either
side.  Carrie suggests that we might ourselves broaden the
paint.  I will see if we can match the colour (dark chocolate)
on Monday."|"The Diary of a Nobody"|"George Grossmith"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"Arrived home tired and worried.  Mr. Putley, a painter and
decorator, who had sent in a card, said he could not match the
colour on the stairs, as it contained Indian carmine.  He said
he spent half-a-day calling at warehouses to see if he could get
it.  He suggested he should entirely repaint the stairs. 
It would cost very little more; if he tried to match it, he could
only make a bad job of it.  It would be more satisfactory to
him and to us to have the work done properly.  I consented,
but felt I had been talked over.  Planted some
mustard-and-cress and radishes, and went to bed at nine."|"The Diary of a Nobody"|"George Grossmith"

To-day was a day of annoyances.  I missed the quarter-to-nine
’bus to the City, through having words with the grocer’s boy, who
for the second time had the impertinence to bring his basket to the
hall-door, and had left the marks of his dirty boots on the
fresh-cleaned door-steps.  He said he had knocked at the side
door with his knuckles for a quarter of an hour.  I knew
Sarah, our servant, could not hear this, as she was upstairs doing
the bedrooms, so asked the boy why he did not ring the bell?

James had come up from Sutton to help Carrie; so I could not help
thinking it unreasonable that she should require the entire
attention of Sarah, the servant, as well.  Sarah kept running
out of the house to fetch “something for missis,” and several times
I had, in my full evening-dress, to answer the back-door."|"The Diary of a Nobody"|"George Grossmith"

knee.  At nine o’clock Carrie swept into the room, looking
like a queen.  Never have I seen her look so lovely, or so
distinguished.  She was wearing a satin dress of sky-blue—my
favourite colour—and a piece of lace, which Mrs. James lent her,
round the shoulders, to give a finish.  I thought perhaps the
dress was a little too long behind, and decidedly too short in
front, but Mrs. James said it was à la mode.  Mrs.
James was most kind, and lent Carrie a fan of ivory with red
feathers, the value of which, she said, was priceless, as the
feathers belonged to the Kachu eagle—a bird now extinct.  I

look into the room where we were, but went straight up to bed,

Mutlar began a series of comic imitations.  He went on for an

much by filling a large tumbler of champagne, and drinking it

hearty meal.  I had a bit of bread-and-butter at that hour,
feeling famished, and I expect that partly spoiled my appetite."|"The Diary of a Nobody"|"George Grossmith"
"ap 11:15"|"quarter-past eleven"|"On arriving home at a quarter-past eleven, we found a hansom
cab, which had been waiting for me for two hours with a
letter.  Sarah said she did not know what to do, as we had not
left the address where we had gone.  I trembled as I opened
the letter, fearing it was some bad news about Mr. Perkupp. 
The note was: “Dear Mr. Pooter,—Come down to the Victoria Hotel
without delay.  Important.  Yours truly, Hardfur
Huttle.”"|"The Diary of a Nobody"|"George Grossmith"
23:45|"quarter before midnight"|"I asked the cabman if it was too late.  The cabman replied
that it was not; for his instructions were, if I happened to
be out, he was to wait till I came home.  I felt very tired,
and really wanted to go to bed.  I reached the hotel at a
quarter before midnight.  I apologised for being so late, but
Mr. Huttle said: “Not at all; come and have a few oysters.”  I
feel my heart beating as I write these words.  To be brief,
Mr. Huttle said he had a rich American friend who wanted to do
something large in our line of business, and that Mr. Franching had
mentioned my name to him.  We talked over the matter. 
If, by any happy chance, the result be successful, I can more than
compensate my dear master for the loss of Mr. Crowbillon’s
custom.  Mr. Huttle had previously said: “The glorious
‘Fourth’ is a lucky day for America, and, as it has not yet struck
twelve, we will celebrate it with a glass of the best wine to be
had in the place, and drink good luck to our bit of business.”"|"The Diary of a Nobody"|"George Grossmith"

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext05 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext05

Or /etext04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92,
91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):

disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a ""public domain"" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the ""Project"").

below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the ""PROJECT GUTENBERG"" trademark.

Please do not use the ""PROJECT GUTENBERG"" trademark to market

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain ""Defects"". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it

copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
