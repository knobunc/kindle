His wife, Wendy, had insisted he wrap up well against the night, and he’d dutifully left the house in a thick woollen coat and sturdy hiking trousers. But as always when the sun fell below Gralmond’s horizon, any warmth contained in the planet’s thinner-than-average atmosphere evaporated away almost immediately.

Some of them assumed the role of business types looking for some bad action after a long day in the office. Three of them hung around the stage, identical to the other losers frantically waving their grubby dollars at the glorious bodies of the Sunset Angels. One had even managed to get a job, trying out as a waiter for the night, and was making reasonable tips.

He doubted there were many, if any, others like it on Merredin. It was his one foible; changing the car once every twelve months (or less) for whatever the hottest new sports model was that year. This one had been imported specially from the Democratic Republic of New Germany, the Big15 planet where Mercedes had relocated its factories when it left Earth. He’d never decided, given his first-life background, if that consumerist extravagance was ironic, or if he was subconsciously distancing himself from that very same past. The only reason he hadn’t wiped the memories entirely when he rejuvenated was so he could be on his guard against any kind of relapse into the stupid idealism which his younger self had embraced.

He took lunch at his desk rather than waste time going to the excellent canteen on the ground floor. His influence began to percolate through the whole starship project and, with it, his enthusiasm.

Opulent furnishings and expensive artwork gleamed in glorious twilight hues as they soaked up the illumination.

They’re made for a reason, to push your attention onto something. Ninety per cent of the market has a sexual content, but there are the pure dramas, and action adventures, and tourist trips as well. It actually takes a very skilled performer, backed up by an equally skilful nerve impulse editor, to receive and filter out the impressions that the director wants and the script calls for. You access a TSI and the story is laid out for you, easy and simple, you sit back and zip through it. True memory is different, it’s whatever has caught your attention at the moment. There can be a dozen important – critical – things going on around you, and because of your prejudices, the way your personality is put together, you’re only looking at one, most likely the least important. It doesn’t even have to be visual; a sound, a smell, that could be the only recollection you have of a room, not who was in it or what they said. And try finding that room amid all the years you can recall . . . We can date the sections of memories which were recorded by an insert memorycell. But indexing, that’s completely different. Unless you know the exact time, you’re forced to review the whole day, or if you’re unlucky, week. And that’s where Qatux comes in. Humans have to review memory in real time. We can’t accept it running faster than it happened. So if I wanted to look through the century which is Shaheef’s life, I would have to spend a century doing it.

The three guards in the gatehouse were responsible for monitoring the perimeter with its six-metre fence and patrolling guardbots. Hundreds of sensors were strung out along the fence, along with dozens more scattered across the surrounding land. Nothing could get close without security knowing.

Before midnight, they had all reached the southern side of the mountain, and mounted up to start their descent into the lowlands. Small tufts of wiry dry grass the colour of straw were appearing in the gritty sand. As the gentle folds in the land began to deepen into distinct valleys so the grass turned greener, and began to spread out into patches which soon joined together into a single carpet.

A quick cold meal at the start of the afternoon, and they were on their way again. As the light began to drain out of the sapphire sky they had reached the edge of the forest, where the land fell away in a steep shingle and grass ridge. The captains of every squad sent out scouts, who crept up to the edge of the ridge to check the ambush point. Several of them were McSobels, who pinpointed and neutralized the remote sensors which the Institute had installed along the road below."|"Pandora's Star"|"Peter F. Hamilton"

Along with the rest of the Charlemagnes he hung back from the top of the ridge so the enemy had no hint of their presence. Then the McSobels fired the plasma cannon. His lenses simply refused to let that much light through into his eyes, he saw them as pink lines blinking on and off, like an after-image of the noon sun traced across his retina. That was the signal to advance. With the sound of the exploding trucks reverberating around him, he urged Kraken forward to the crest of the ridge. A quick sideways glance showed Bruce at his side, laughing like a demon as the massive warhorses picked up speed. Then they were over the ridge, and the entire panorama glared brilliant jade below them as the diminishing tanker truck fireball ascended into the sky. He watched the trucks skidding about on the road, their force fields haloed by pieces of flaming wreckage that bounced and skittered across the invisible screens. The Cruisers had all turned off the road, and were driving straight towards the clan raiders as they charged down the slope."|"Pandora's Star"|"Peter F. Hamilton"

He breathed down air which had that distinct crisp chill that was only ever found at the foot of snow-capped mountains. The taller peaks and plateaus of the Dau’sings were still heavily snow-covered, including both ski fields. Mark looked up at them, his sunglasses darkening against the light from Elan’s brilliant G-9 star flooding down out of the cloudless sky. They dominated the land behind the town, forming an impressive barrier of rumpled cones and peaks. Now that Elan’s southern hemisphere was coming into springtime, meltwater was starting to run down out of the snowline, filling every crevice with gushing white rivulets. Pine-variants from across the Commonwealth had colonized the lower slopes, bringing a much needed cascade of verdure foliage. Above them, the native boltgrass still flourished, a characterless yellow-green plant with ratty strands. Away from the little oasis of foreign vegetation which humans had brought to the area, it was boltgrass which carpeted every mountain in the range, covering almost a quarter of the continent."|"Pandora's Star"|"Peter F.

He got to it well before quarter to nine. Randtown, for all it was the only real town for eight hundred kilometres, wasn’t particularly large. Without the tourists and youthful transients, the population was only just over five thousand people.

The promenade was unusually quiet for midday. He pulled his jacket hood up against the bitter wind blowing off the lake. Those who did stroll past had the glazed otherwhere expression symptomatic of someone absorbed by their virtual vision. Everybody was hooked on the starship’s return. It was as momentous as the Cup Final, when all through the first half Brazil had actually looked like they were going to lose. Instinctively he glanced up at the Black House where Simon Rand lived, wondering if he too was having life put into perspective on this day. The building was a huge Georgian mansion perched on the slope above the eastern wing of the lake’s inlet, set in ten acres of its own immaculately maintained grounds. There were dozens of big houses arrayed on the slopes around it, the most expensive and exclusive in the town, though they didn’t match its grandeur. A lot of them belonged to the first arrivals, the men and women who’d joined Simon’s quixotic crusade and helped lay the highway through the mountains."|"Pandora's Star"|"Peter F. Hamilton"

Looking down on Fifth Avenue from the two hundred and twenty-fifth floor of the Commonwealth Exploration and Development Office, Nigel Sheldon could see the city’s perpetual traffic battle in action. All along that massive historical thoroughfare, yellow cabs and matt-black limousines were jammed together, two entirely separate and antagonistic species contesting dominance of the available lanes. Urban myth told it that the city’s cabs had illicit aggressor software installed in their drive arrays. That wouldn’t surprise Nigel given the number of times his limo had had to brake to make way for a cab veering out in front of him.

Both of them bowed respectfully as they passed Justine, who just managed not to scowl back at them. In some respects, her father could be terribly predictable. The girls would be slotted into his schedule the same way as a finance conference or a meal. Every minute of his day was worked into his personal agenda weeks in advance. She knew a lot of people speculated that he’d received illegal psychoneural profiling to turn him into an obsessive compulsive about work and the family. But she still possessed the memories of her early childhood, when he was rarely home from Wall Street before ten or eleven in the evening, spending every weekend in his study with computer screens as his only companions. He’d always been singleminded, keeping human requirements to the minimum. As technology advanced, so he acquired more and more interface and processing functions to keep him attuned to the great pan-Commonwealth financial markets."|"Pandora's Star"|"Peter F. Hamilton"

Midnight-black OCtattoos ran across his cheeks, flickering in and out of visibility."|"Pandora's Star"|"Peter F. Hamilton"

By midday they were skirting along the shoreline ridge of the first crater, with a string of savage rock peaks on the other side. After that there were gullies crowned by curving waves of compacted snow, looking as if the slightest tremble would send them avalanching into the gulf below. Then ravines with frozen sheet ice along the floor, where the ybnan had trouble getting a grip with their hoofs; spinneys and forests of crystal trees and bulbous bushes. Often, when he looked out, Ozzie would see great swathes of them smashed and shattered, leaving jagged stumps surrounded by a pile of ice-encrusted branches. There were narrow steep saddle valleys to surmount, where their speed was reduced to a painful crawl on the ascent, only to degenerate into a mad slither downwards, more abrupt and frightening than the trip down from the massif. And there were long curves around craters, where the vapour drifted out sideways like a mist, swiftly covering ybnan and sledges alike in a crusty hoarfrost."|"Pandora's Star"|"Peter F. Hamilton"

Gardenbots were patrolling the plants, snipping off dead flowers and trimming any errant shoots that threatened symmetry; water droplets glistened on the tough grass from the pre-dawn irrigation sprinkling. On the other side of the broad street the bold geometrical skyline of condos presented their tiers of perfectly parallel balconies to the beach far below. Right in the middle of the gleaming new architecture their skyline took a sudden dip down, allowing the sunlight to shine on a small nineteen thirties hotel, the Georgian, with its art deco facade painted eggshell blue. Various brass plaques outside proclaimed the companies and civic authorities who had provided funds down the centuries to preserve the building, easily the oldest in the city. It had a raised concrete veranda along the front, with several tables underneath a yellow and pink striped awning.

It was Ozzie who got the midnight to morning shift. He sat on a flattish rock beside the tent, dressed in his cords and check shirt, with his sleeping bag wrapped round his shoulders like a blanket. The river murmured away quietly, and occasionally he heard a low rattling wheeze from Tochee which he classed as alien snoring; other than that there was only the deep silence he would always associate with this world."|"Pandora's Star"|"Peter F.

Achaia was one of those narrow streets in the city grid which looked like it ran on for ever, with the cracked concrete’s heat shimmer obscuring the far end as it slipped into the commercial district. The housing on both sides was mainly three-storey apartment blocks, fronted by small yards that were filled with overgrown ornamental bushes and trees that had nearly reached roof level.

Force fields over cities, constantly flaring with shimmering opalescence as they warded off either debris or a howling radioactive hurricane. Reporters foolhardy enough to be standing close to the force field revealed the new wastelands outside; the eerily smooth craters with glowing basins surrounded by flat ground that had become a desert of midnight-black carbon. Then there were the human interest stories, interviews with terrified, barely coherent city residents as they wept. Those from outlying towns who’d made it inside the force fields in time.

Undiluted sunlight poured through the huge crescent windows high overhead, making the angular support pillars gleam. He walked off the platform and down the curving ramp at the end, feeling the familiar tremble through the soles of his boots as trains rolled through the giant building. Traffic at the station was almost back up to its pre-invasion levels, though there were noticeably fewer passengers crowding the central concourse."|"Pandora's Star"|"Peter F. Hamilton"
