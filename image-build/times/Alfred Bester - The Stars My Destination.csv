12:00|noon|"Laborers in heavy work clothes, still spattered with snow, were on their way south to their homes after a shift in the north woods. Fifty white clad dairy clerks were headed west toward St. Louis. They followed the morning from the Eastern Time Zone to the Pacific Zone. And from eastern Greenland, where it was already noon, a horde of white-collar office workers was pouring into New York for their lunch hour."|"The Stars My Destination"|"Alfred Bester"

09:00|"nine o’clock in the morning"|"So, in jauntes of one and two hundred miles each, Presteign crossed the continent, and arrived outside the Vancouver shipping yards at exactly nine o’clock in the morning, Pacific time. He had left New York at 11 A.M. He had gained two hours of daylight. This, too, was a commonplace in a jaunting world."|"The Stars My Destination"|"Alfred Bester"

03:00|"Three this morning"|"“Three this morning? Presteign must have been busy.” Y’ang-Yeovil sighed. Sheffield was proving himself a resolute opponent. The Intelligence man tried another diversion. “I do wish our Mr. Presto had been more specific.”"|"The Stars My Destination"|"Alfred Bester"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"For Foyle there was only the silence, the rushing, and the hospital routine. At eight o’clock (or it may have been any hour in this timeless abyss) he was awakened by a bell. He arose and received his morning meal, slotted into the cell by pneumatic tube. It had to be eaten at once, for the china surrogate of cups and plates was timed to dissolve in fifteen minutes. At eight-thirty the cell door opened and Foyle and hundreds of others shuffled blindly through the twisting corridors to Sanitation."|"The Stars My Destination"|"Alfred Bester"

12:00|noon|"At noon, Fourmyle of Ceres arrived with a display of conspicuous transportation so outlandish that it had been known to make seven-year melancholies laugh. A giant amphibian thrummed up from the south and landed on the lake. An LST barge emerged from the plane and droned across the water to the shore. Its forward wall banged down into a drawbridge and out came a twentieth century staff car. Wonder piled on wonder for the delighted spectators, for the staff car drove a matter of twenty yards to the center of camp and then stopped."|"The Stars My Destination"|"Alfred Bester"

23:30|"half an hour before midnight"|"On New Year’s Eve, Geoffrey Fourmyle of Ceres made his onslaught on society. He appeared first in Canberra at the Government House ball, half an hour before midnight. This was a highly formal affair, bursting with color and pageantry, for it was the custom at formals for society to wear the evening dress that had been fashionable the year its clan was founded or its trademark patented."|"The Stars My Destination"|"Alfred Bester"
00:00|midnight|"They laughed and the crowd clustering around Fourmyle grew. They were delighted and amused. He was a new toy. Then it was midnight, and as the great clock tolled in the New Year, the gathering prepared to jaunte with midnight around the world."|"The Stars My Destination"|"Alfred Bester"
"ap 00:30"|twelve-thirty|"It was twelve-thirty when Foyle and Robin arrived at the front office of the Aussie Cannery company town. They applied for identification tags and were greeted by the mayor himself."|"The Stars My Destination"|"Alfred Bester"
"< 00:00"|"Almost midnight"|"“One lead shot to hell. Just when he was opening up. What a damned break.” He took a deep breath and drew calm about him like an iron cloak. The tattooing disappeared from his face. He adjusted his watch for 120 degrees east longitude. “Almost midnight in Shanghai. Let’s go. Maybe we’ll have better luck with Sergei Orel, pharmacist’s mate off the Vorga. Don’t look so scared. This is only the beginning. Go, girl. Jaunte!”"|"The Stars My Destination"|"Alfred Bester"

00:00|midnight|"The Galleria of the Stairs was illuminated at night, and this New Year’s Eve was chaotic. For a thousand years Rome has welcomed the New Year with a bombardment…firecrackers, rockets, torpedoes, gunshots, bottles, shoes, old pots and pans. For months Romans save junk to be hurled out of top-floor windows when midnight strikes. The roar of fireworks inside the Stairs, and the clatter of debris clashing on the Galleria roof, were deafening as Foyle and Robin Wednesbury climbed down from the carnival in the Borghese Palace."|"The Stars My Destination"|"Alfred Bester"
00:00|midnight|"They came in like meteor swarms; not so many, but far more deadly. They came in on the morning quadrant, that quarter of the globe in darkness from midnight to dawn. They collided head on with the forward side of the earth in its revolution around the sun. They had been traveling a distance of four hundred million miles."|"The Stars My Destination"|"Alfred Bester"
00:00|midnight|"“The living dead,” Foyle muttered. He decelerated, put Sigurd Magsman down, and switched on the retinal light in his eyes, trying to pierce the womb gloom. It was midnight above ground. It was permanent midnight down in the catacombs. Sigurd Magsman was broadcasting terror and anguish with such a telepathic bray that Foyle was forced to shake the child again."|"The Stars My Destination"|"Alfred Bester"
00:00|midnight|"Again the missiles came down on the midnight to dawn quadrant. Again the heavens twinkled with interceptions and detonations, and the horizon exploded great puffs of light while the ground shook. But this time there was a ghastly variation, for a brilliant nova burst overhead, flooding the nightside of the planet with garish light. A swarm of fission heads had struck Mars’ tiny satellite, Phobos, instantly vaporizing it into a sunlet."|"The Stars My Destination"|"Alfred Bester"
"ap 04:49"|"eleven to five"|"“Knocked Djargo-Dantchenko for a loop,” Sheffield reported triumphantly. “Judgment and full damages. Old DD’s sore as a boil. This makes the score eleven to five, my favor.” He took the beads, juggled them, and then began tossing them into unlikely receptacles all over the office, including the open mouth of a gaping clerk."|"The Stars My Destination"|"Alfred Bester"

"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"It was nine o’clock of a crisp, winey morning in Tokyo, and the morning rush hour crowd milling around the Imperial stage alongside the carp ponds was paralyzed by a tiger-faced Samurai who appeared and hurled a slug of curious metal and unforgettable warnings and admonitions at them."|"The Stars My Destination"|"Alfred Bester"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"Foyle continued to Bangkok where it was pouring rain, and Delhi where a monsoon raged…always pursued in his mad-dog course. In Baghdad it was three in the morning and the night-club crowd and pub crawlers who stayed a perpetual half hour ahead of closing time around the world, cheered him alcoholically. In Paris and again in London it was midnight and the mobs on the Champs Élysées and in Piccadilly Circus were galvanized by Foyle’s appearance and passionate exhortation."|"The Stars My Destination"|"Alfred Bester"
