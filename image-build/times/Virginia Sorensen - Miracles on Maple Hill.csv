"ap ~ 05:00"|"about five o'clock"|"When the Chrises and Fritz went away, Fritz called back to Joe that he'd be calling by real early, maybe about five o'clock. Joe went right up to bed, then, without a word, and Marly felt herself go cold all over. She reached for Daddy's arm as he started for the stairs. ""Daddy—about the foxes—"""|"Miracles on Maple Hill"|"Virginia Sorensen"
12:00|noon|"Marly was so eager to tell Joe about the school and the band that she ran all the way home. But Joe wasn't there. He didn't even come back for lunch at noon."|"Miracles on Maple Hill"|"Virginia Sorensen"
"ap > 09:00"|"after nine"|"Marly felt her heart beating hard when she looked out, pressing her face against the cold pane. Joe knows his way on all those roads, she thought, but they looked different all covered with snow. Sometimes the snow got so deep here, Mr. Chris said, that the fences disappeared entirely, and there weren't any roads at all. The pane misted over, and she couldn't see anything but herself reflected as if she sat outside in a little snowy room.
""Dale, it's after nine already,"" Mother said.
""I thought Joe knew better. Why, I never dreamed—I thought he'd just be going out for a minute, maybe to see about the goats or something."" Daddy acted as if Mother blamed him for something he'd done and hadn't meant to do. ""I'll fix Joe good for doing a thing like this,"" he said."|"Miracles on Maple Hill"|"Virginia Sorensen"
"ap 09:30"|Nine-thirty|"The clock moved, but never in Marly's remembrance had it moved so slowly. Nine-thirty, nine thirty-five, nine-forty, a quarter to ten, and at last it struck ten. By then Mother was sitting on the very edge of her chair. And before the clock had finished striking, the telephone rang."|"Miracles on Maple Hill"|"Virginia Sorensen"

"ap ~ 02:00"|"About two o'clock"|"""Chrissie came and woke me. About two o'clock it was, I guess. He overdid yesterday—getting that first run out just right. I'll try to get back by afternoon if he's okay. If you can get help with the gathering—but of course it's Sunday..."""|"Miracles on Maple Hill"|"Virginia Sorensen"
"ap 02:00"|"two o'clock"|"They all went back to work. By two o'clock the gathering was finished. Fritz insisted they go home for a while, and he would watch the fire at the sugar camp. But Daddy said, ""No, I'd rather stay."" He could sleep here this time, he said. Fritz had to have some rest before he'd be worth a grain of salt tomorrow. The sap was still coming. Slowly, steadily, the buckets were filling up again."|"Miracles on Maple Hill"|"Virginia Sorensen"
12:00|noon|"The sap was still coming and coming and coming, as if the earth could never give enough. How could they go on and on and on? Daddy looked quite gray. Fritz was red-faced and didn't say anything most of the morning. By noon both Marly and Joe were almost too tired to talk."|"Miracles on Maple Hill"|"Virginia Sorensen"
"<< 12:00"|"Long before noon"|"The next day the school bus went by as usual. But pretty soon it came back again. Boys and girls simply swarmed up the hill! Fritz got them organized, so many to go out with him each time. It seemed like magic how quickly the buckets were emptied and into the storage tanks. Long before noon everybody was back in school again—even Joe and Marly."|"Miracles on Maple Hill"|"Virginia Sorensen"
