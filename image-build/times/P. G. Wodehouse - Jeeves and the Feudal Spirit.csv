carouse. I am told that you were at that party of Catsmeat
Potter-Pirbright's last night. You probably reeled home at
three in the morning, rousing the neighbourhood with drunken
shouts.'"|"Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit"|"P. G. Wodehouse"

absent myself from the farewell supper of a boyhood friend who
is leaving for Hollywood in a day or two and may be away from
civilization for years. Catsmeat would have been pained to his
foundations if I had oiled out. And it wasn't three in the
morning, it was two-thirty.'"|"Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit"|"P. G. Wodehouse"

"ap ~ 11:30"|"about half-past eleven"|"This might, I thought, have been more tactfully put, but I let
it go.
'Right ho,' I said. 'I'll call for you at about half-past eleven.'
You are surprised? You are saying to yourself 'Come, come,
Wooster, what's all this?' – wondering why I was letting myself
in for a beano from which I might well have shrunk? The matter
is susceptible of a ready explanation."|"Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
"ap 11:30"|eleven-thirty|"I picked her up at her flat at eleven-thirty, and found her in
sombre mood, the lips compressed, the eyes inclined to gaze into
space with a sort of hard glow in them. No doubt something
along these lines is always the aftermath of a brisk dust-up with
the heart-throb. During the taxi drive she remained about as
silent as the tomb, and from the way her foot kept tapping on the
floor of the vehicle I knew that she was thinking of Stilton,
whether or not in agony of spirit I was, of course, unable to say, but
I thought it probable. Following her into the joint, I was on the
whole optimistic. It seemed to me that with any luck I ought to be
successful in the task that lay before me – viz. softening her with
well-chosen words and jerking her better self back to the surface."|"Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
15:00|"three
o'clock in the afternoon"|"For a moment I was under the impression that my visitor's
emotion was due to his having found me at this advanced hour in
pyjamas and a dressing-gown, a costume which, if worn at three
o'clock in the afternoon, is always liable to start a train of
thought. But it seemed that this was not so. More serious
matters were on the agenda."|"Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
01:00|"one in the morning"|"I leaped perhaps six inches in the direction of the ceiling. I was
appalled, and I think not unjustifiably so. I mean, dash it, a
fellow who has always prided himself on the scrupulous delicacy
of his relations with the other sex doesn't like to have it supposed
that he deliberately shins up ladders at one in the morning in
order to kiss girls while they sleep."|"Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
01:00|"one in the morning"|"Florence, I noticed, seemed a bit startled, too. One gathered
that she hadn't expected, when setting out for Brinkley
Court, that her bedroom was going to be such a social centre.
There's a song I used to sing a good deal at one time, the refrain
or burthen of which began with the words 'Let's all go round to
Maud's'. Much the same sentiment appeared to be animating
the guests beneath Aunt Dahlia's roof, and it was, of course,
upsetting for the poor child. At one in the morning girls like a
bit of privacy, and she couldn't have had much less privacy if she
had been running a snack bar on a racecourse."|"Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
01:20|"twenty minutes past one o'clock in the morning"|"'Well!' she said, looking like a female minor prophet about to
curse the sins of the people. 'May I trespass on your valuable
time long enough to ask you what in the name of everything
bloodsome you think you're playing at, young piefaced Bertie? It
is now some twenty minutes past one o'clock in the morning,
and not a spot of action on your part. Do you expect me to sit up
all night waiting for you to get around to a simple, easy task
which a crippled child of six could have had all done and washed
up in a quarter of an hour? I suppose this is just the shank of
the evening to you dissipated Londoners, but we rustics like to
get our sleep. What's the idea? Why the delay? What on earth
have you been doing all this while, you revolting young piece
of cheese?'"|"Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit"|"P. G. Wodehouse"

morning"|"'But he's a long way from being in that frame of mind at the
moment, according to Florence. She says he is convinced that
you two were on an unbridled toot together. And, of course, his
finding you in the cupboard in her bedroom at one in the
morning was unfortunate.'"|"Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
"~ 16:30"|evensong|"Such was the v. that rose before my e. as I gaped at that c.d.,
and I wilted like a salted snail. Outside in the garden birds were
singing their evensong, and it seemed to me that each individual
bird was saying 'Well, boys, Wooster is for it. We shan't see much
of Wooster for the next few years. Too bad, too bad. A nice chap
till he took to crime.'"|"Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit"|"P. G. Wodehouse"

Brinkley Court. It was Bertram Wooster coming down to
breakfast."|"Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
"ap ~ 09:20"|"about nine-twenty"|"I'm pretty shrewd, and it flashed upon me at this point that it
might quite possibly be his stepson Percy to whom he was
guardedly alluding. But before I could verify this suspicion the
room had begun to fill up. Round about nine-twenty, which it
was now, you generally find the personnel of a country house
lining up for the eats. Aunt Dahlia came in and took a fried egg.
Mrs Trotter came in and took a sausage. Percy and Florence
came in and took respectively a slice of ham and a portion of
haddock. As there were no signs of Uncle Tom, I presumed that
he was breakfasting in bed. He generally does when he has
guests, rarely feeling equal to facing them till he has fortified
himself a bit for the stern ordeal."|"Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit"|"P. G. Wodehouse"

of thistles thrust three thorns through the thick of his
thumb"".'"|"Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
