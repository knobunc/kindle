"> 02:00"|"two hours after midnight"|"It was pale and clear this morning, the sun up—the sun had been up since two hours after midnight, Miles reminded himself. They were just past the shortest nights of the year for this latitude. From this rare high vantage point, Miles gazed out with interest at Lazkowski Base and the flat landscape beyond."|"The Vor Game"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
"ap ~ 02:00"|"about two"|"Relax, he told himself frantically. The tundra surface, the free air, might be a mere ten centimeters overhead. Or ten meters ... relax ! He felt about the shelter for something to use as a probe. There'd been a long, telescoping, knife-bitted tube for sampling glacier ice. Packed in the scat-cat. Along with the comm link. Now located, Miles gauged by the angle of the floor, about two-and-a-half meters down and to the west of his present location. It was the scat-cat that was dragging him down. The bubble-shelter alone might well have floated in the tundra-camouflaged mud-pond. If he could detach the chain, might it rise? Not fast enough. His chest felt stuffed with cotton. He had to break through to air soon, or asphyxiate. Womb, tomb. Would his parents be there to watch, when he was found at last, when this grave was opened, scat-cat and shelter winched out of the bog by heavy hovercab ... his body frozen rictus-mouthed in this hideous parody of an amniotic sac ... relax."|"The Vor Game"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
"ap 05:00"|0500|"“For the damage you did to the weather station,” Metzov began slowly, then sat up more decisively—his eyes, Miles could almost swear, lighting with a faint red glow, the corner of that seamed mouth twitching upward, “you will supervise basic-labor detail for one week. Four hours a day. That's in addition to your other duties. Report to Sergeant Neuve, in Maintenance, at 0500 daily."""|"The Vor Game"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
"ap 05:00"|0500|"Next morning Miles reported to the maintenance shed for the second half of the scat-cat retrieval job, cleaning all the mud-caked equipment. The sun was bright today, and had been up for hours, but Miles's body knew it was only 0500. An hour into his task he'd begun to warm up, feel better, and get into the rhythm of the thing."|"The Vor Game"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
"~ 00:00"|"about midnight"|"He looked around, trying to imagine his present surroundings in the dark and heavy rain. If he had been the private, slogging along this road about midnight, what would he have seen? What could possibly have attracted the man's attention to the ditch? Why the hell had he come out here in the middle of the night in the first place? This road wasn't on the way to anything but an obstacle course and a firing range."|"The Vor Game"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
"ap ~ 07:00"|"about 0700"|"“We're expecting a light east wind with dropping temperatures till about 0700 tomorrow morning,” Miles answered his look. “Then it'll shift around to the north and blow harder. Potential wah-wah conditions starting around 1800 tomorrow night."""|"The Vor Game"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
"~ 18:00"|"around 1800"|"“We're expecting a light east wind with dropping temperatures till about 0700 tomorrow morning,” Miles answered his look. “Then it'll shift around to the north and blow harder.

"< 00:00"|"toward midnight"|"Bonn posted the fire marshal's sergeant as guard to keep everyone well away from the bunker. An unenviable duty, but not unbearable in present conditions, and the guard could retreat inside his scat-cat when the temperature dropped, toward midnight. Miles rode back with Bonn to the base Administration building to double-check his promises about wind direction at the weather office."|"The Vor Game"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
00:00|midnight|"General Metzov stood, heavily gloved and parka-bundled, beside the empty metal bannerpole in front of Admin, and stared down the half-lit road. Looking for what? Miles wondered. It was pushing midnight now. Yaski and Bonn were lining up their tech crews in parade for array, some fifteen thermal-coveralled and parka-clad men."|"The Vor Game"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
"> 02:00"|"two hours after midnight"|"“That is what this interview will determine,” Illyan sighed, leaning back in his chair. “I have been up since two hours after midnight over this escapade. Rumors are flying all over the Service, as fast as the vid net can carry them. The facts appear to be mutating every forty minutes, like bacteria. I don't suppose you could have picked some more public way to self-destruct? Attempted to assassinate the Emperor with your pocket-knife during the Birthday Review, say, or raped a sheep in the Great Square during rush hour?” The sarcasm melted to genuine pain. “He had so much hope of you. How could betray him so?"""|"The Vor Game"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
00:00|midnight|"“Hm. Enjoy your independence while it lasts. It ends with your first mistake.” Illyan's tone was sardonic, but his eyes were confident, until he turned them toward Miles. “Miles, you'll be traveling as ‘Admiral Naismith,’ himself traveling incognito, returning, possibly, to the Dendarii fleet. Should Captain Ungari decide for you to activate the Naismith role, he'll pose as your bodyguard, so as to be always in position to control the situation. It's a little too much to ask Ungari to be responsible for his mission and also your safety, so you'll also have a real bodyguard. This setup will give Captain Ungari unusual freedom of movement, because it will account for your possession of a personal ship—we have a jump pilot and a fast courier we obtained from—never mind where, but it has no connection with Barrayar. It's under Jacksonian registration at present, which fits in nicely with Admiral Naismith's mysterious background. It's so obviously bogus, no one will look for a second layer of, er, bogusity. Illyan paused. “You will, of course, obey Captain Ungari's orders. That goes without saying.” Illyan's direct stare was chilly as a Kyril Island midnight."|"The Vor Game"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"Gregor shrugged, gazing at his shoes. “Anyway, I noticed ... there were no guards in sight. For a change. I don't know why the hole, there'd been a man there earlier. They thought I was asleep, I guess. It was after midnight. I couldn't sleep. I was leaning over the balcony, and thinking, if I toppled off...” Gregor hesitated."|"The Vor Game"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
00:00|midnight|"“Try it alone in bed at midnight, wondering when your genes are going to start generating monsters in your mind. Like Great Uncle Mad Yuri. Or Prince Serg.” His glance at Miles was secretly sharp."|"The Vor Game"|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
