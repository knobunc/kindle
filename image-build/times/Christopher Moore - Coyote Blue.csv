"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"All Sam could think was Not today. He said, “All right, call them and tell them I’m on my way. And call the garage down the street and have them come up and fix the flat tire on that orange Datsun out front. Have them bill it to my card.”
“You have a three o’clock appointment with Mrs. Wittingham.”
“Cancel it.” Sam started out of the office."|"Coyote Blue"|"Christopher Moore"

I ignored that one. Nine oh-five: Mrs. Feldstein reports that the wolf is forcibly having sex with her Persian cat. I went on that call myself, just to see it. Nine ten: Mrs. Feldstein reports that the wolf ate the Persian after having his way with it.

Then one of them calls in that a big dog has just bitten holes in the tires on his golf cart and run off. Eleven thirty: Dr. Epstein makes his first lost-nap call—dog howling. Eleven thirty-five: Mrs. Norcross is putting the kids out on the deck for some burgers when a big dog jumps over the rail, eats the burgers, growls at the kids, runs off.

"ap 11:41"|"Eleven forty-one"|"“Her grandkids are visiting from Michigan. She filed the proper papers.” Spagnola took a deep breath and started into the log again. “Eleven forty-one: large dog craps in Dr. Yamata’s Aston Martin. Twelve oh-three: dog eats two, count ’em, two of Mrs. Wittingham’s Siamese cats. She just lost her husband last week; this sort of put her over the edge. We had to call Dr. Yamata in off the putting green to give her a sedative. The personal-injury lawyer in the unit next to hers was home for lunch and he came over to help. He was talking class action then, and we didn’t even know who owned the dog yet.”"|"Coyote Blue"|"Christopher Moore"

"ap 00:30"|"thirty to one"|"Spagnola ignored Sam. “From twelve thirty to one we had mass sightings and frequent urinations—I won’t bore you with details—then one of my guys spotted the dog and followed it to your building, where it disappeared for a minute and reappeared on your deck.”"|"Coyote Blue"|"Christopher Moore"
00:00|midnight|"“Oregon. I didn’t build the car myself. I used to live with this sculptor in Sedona, Arizona, who built it for midnight drives in the desert. One day I was telling him that I thought that cars had replaced guns as phallic symbols for American men, and I thought it was interesting that he had one that was so small and fast. The next day he gave me the Datsun and went out and bought a Lincoln. It was very sweet.”"|"Coyote Blue"|"Christopher Moore"
"ap 06:00"|"Six o’clock"|"“Terrific. I live at seventeen and a half Anapamu Street—that’s upstairs. Whatever you do, don’t go to the downstairs door. Six o’clock, okay?” Without waiting for his answer, she was out of the car and away."|"Coyote Blue"|"Christopher Moore"
">> 00:00"|"well after midnight"|"Sam spent most of the night cleaning up the debris from Josh Spagnola’s shooting exhibition. Exhausted from the overall strangeness of his day, he went to bed early, but lay awake until well after midnight, first worrying, then trying to understand what was happening to him, and finally fantasizing about the girl. Amid the misery he retained hope, although he could not logically figure out why. She was, after all, just a girl—the goofiest girl he had ever met. Still, the thought of seeing her again made him smile, and he was able to escape into dreamless sleep."|"Coyote Blue"|"Christopher Moore"

00:00|midnight|"In the bedroom, hearing a Harley do burnouts on his Berber carpet, Spagnola finally realized that something was seriously wrong. He leapt from bed and began searching through a trail of clothes he had left last night on the way to bed with the Tuesday-Thursday-Saturday masseuse from the Cliffs. He remembered kicking his gun belt away from the bedroom door when he sent her home at midnight and scrambled to the door. He was bending to unholster the gun when Tinker kicked the door open, catching Spagnola square in the forehead, knocking him cold."|"Coyote Blue"|"Christopher Moore"
06:00|"Six in the morning"|"Sam looked around the room. Calliope and Grubb were gone. He got up and reached for his watch on the dresser while shouts and whispers continued from the living room. Six in the morning. It must have gone on all night: the shouting, the pounding, the babies crying. He was lucky to have slept at all. He dressed and walked into the living room."|"Coyote Blue"|"Christopher Moore"
"ap 00:50"|"Twelve fifty"|"“Twelve!” another shouted.
“Twelve fifty.”
Sam gestured for them to be quiet. “No, I need this,” he said solemnly. He hugged the donut to his chest."|"Coyote Blue"|"Christopher Moore"

Let your bitches carry your stash.” Newton dropped his cigarette and ground it out on the carpet. “That’s all,” he said."|"Coyote Blue"|"Christopher Moore"

Something with four-wheel drive. A Blazer or a Bronco or something. White if they have it. I’ll pick it up at five. Yes, the corporate card. Fuck Aaron. Tell him I’m on a hunting trip.

"ap 05:30"|"five thirty"|"He continued, “A Crow medicine bundle. Yes. This one’s a cyl-inder, a hollowed-out cedar log. That’s right. Well, sir, we’ll need to take a look at it in person. We happen to have a tribal expert visiting the campus right now. We could be in Billings by five thirty tonight. No, I’m afraid he has to fly to a dig in Arizona tomorrow. It will have to be tonight. Yes, I have your address. Thank you, sir.”"|"Coyote Blue"|"Christopher Moore"
