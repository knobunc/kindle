Reform began in 1837, with British educator Rowland Hill’s study of the postal system, and in 1840, prepaid postage by stamps was introduced. The advent of the railway and the steamship permitted a far speedier, more regular, and more reliable mail service as the nineteenth century passed. By 1900, according to Whitaker’s Almanack (1900), in the City district of London, there were twelve deliveries daily, while in other London districts there were from six to eleven collections and deliveries. Letters were normally delivered within two to four hours of posting. More urgent messages could be designated for “express delivery” at a small additional cost, or the “district messenger service,” a private carrier, could be used for 3 pennies per half-mile. Overnight delivery was the standard for mail outside London."|"The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes, Volume I"|"Arthur Conan Doyle"

It is also the headquarters of the manufacture of bicycles and tricycles.” However, Coventry is perhaps most famous for a legendary horseback ride. In the eleventh century, Lady Godiva bargained with her husband, a powerful noble, to reduce taxes in the district. He promised to do so if she rode naked on horseback through the Coventry marketplace at midday. Lady Godiva made her now-famous ride, and the taxes were eliminated. The story was recorded several times before 1400. In later accounts, probably at the urging of churchmen, the account was embellished with the tale of “Peeping Tom,” who was struck blind (or dead) when he alone gazed upon Lady Godiva. Another later invention was the detail of the story, often added, that Godiva was covered totally, except for her legs, by an enormous and improbable quantity of hair.

She begged him to remain at home, as she could hear the rain pattering against the windows, but in spite of her entreaties he pulled on his large macintosh and left the house."|"The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes, Volume I"|"Arthur Conan Doyle"

"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"Miss Susan Cushing, living at Cross Street, Croydon, has been made the victim of what must be regarded as a peculiarly revolting practical joke, unless some more sinister meaning should prove to be attached to the incident. At two o’clock yesterday afternoon a small packet, wrapped in brown paper, was handed in by the postman. A cardboard box was inside, which was filled with coarse salt. On emptying this, Miss Cushing was horrified to find two human ears, apparently quite freshly severed. The box had been sent by parcel post from Belfast upon the morning before. There is no indication as to the sender, and the matter is the more mysterious as Miss Cushing, who is a maiden lady of fifty, has led a most retired life, and has so few acquaintances or correspondents that it is a rare event for her to receive anything through the post. Some years ago, however, when she resided at Penge, she let apartments in her house to three young medical students, whom she was obliged to get rid of on account of their noisy and irregular habits. The police are of opinion that this outrage may have been perpetrated upon Miss Cushing by these youths, who owed her a grudge, and who hoped to frighten her by sending her these relics of the dissecting-rooms. Some probability is lent to the theory by the fact that one of these students came from the north of Ireland, and, to the best of Miss Cushing’s belief, from Belfast. In the meantime, the matter is being actively investigated, Mr. Lestrade, one of the very smartest of our detective officers, being in charge of the case."|"The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes, Volume I"|"Arthur Conan Doyle"

May Day, belonging to the Liverpool, Dublin, and London Steam Packet Company. On inquiry, I found that there was a steward on board of the name of James Browner and that he had acted during the voyage in such an extraordinary manner that the captain had been compelled to relieve him of his duties. On descending to his berth, I found him seated upon a chest with his head sunk upon his hands, rocking himself to and fro. He is a big, powerful chap, clean-shaven, and very swarthy—something like Aldridge, who helped us in the bogus laundry affair. He jumped up when he heard my business, and I had my whistle to my lips to call a couple of river police, who were round the corner, but he seemed to have no heart in him, and he held out his hands quietly enough for the darbies. We brought him along to the cells, and his box as well, for we thought there might be something incriminating; but, bar a big sharp knife such as most sailors have, we got nothing for our trouble. However, we find that we shall want no more evidence, for on being brought before the inspector at the station, he asked leave to make a statement, which was, of course, taken down, just as he made it, by our shorthand man. We had three copies type-written, one of which I enclose. The affair proves, as I always thought it would, to be an extremely simple one, but I am obliged to you for assisting me in my investigation.

It has been a standing jest in the family that nothing could ever wake me during the night; and yet somehow on that particular night, whether it may have been the slight excitement produced by my little adventure or not, I know not, but I slept much more lightly than usual. Half in my dreams I was dimly conscious that something was going on in the room, and gradually became aware that my wife had dressed herself and was slipping on her mantle and her bonnet. My lips were parted to murmur out some sleepy words of surprise or remonstrance at this untimely preparation, when suddenly my half-opened eyes fell upon her face, illuminated by the candle light, and astonishment held me dumb. She wore an expression such as I had never seen before—such as I should have thought her incapable of assuming. She was deadly pale, and breathing fast, glancing furtively towards the bed, as she fastened her mantle, to see if she had disturbed me. Then, thinking that I was still asleep, she slipped noiselessly from the room, and an instant later I heard a sharp creaking, which could only come from the hinges of the front door. I sat up in bed and rapped my knuckles against the rail to make certain that I was truly awake. Then I took my watch from under the pillow. It was three in the morning.

"ap 03:20"|"twenty past three"|"It was twenty past three when we reached our terminus, and after a hasty luncheon at the buffet we pushed on at once to Scotland Yard. Holmes had already wired to Forbes, and we found him waiting to receive us—a small, foxy man with a sharp but by no means amiable expression. He was decidedly frigid in his manner to us, especially when he heard the errand upon which we had come."|"The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes, Volume I"|"Arthur Conan Doyle"
"~ 02:00"|"about two in the morning"|"“You must know that last night was the very first night that I have ever slept without a nurse in the room. I was so much better that I thought I could dispense with one. I had a night-light burning, however. Well, about two in the morning I had sunk into a light sleep when I was suddenly aroused by a slight noise. It was like the sound which a mouse makes when it is gnawing a plank, and I lay listening to it for some time under the impression that it must come from that cause. Then it grew louder, and suddenly there came from the window a sharp metallic snick. I sat up in amazement. There could be no doubt what the sounds were now. The first ones had been caused by someone forcing an instrument through the slit between the sashes, and the second by the catch being pressed back."|"The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes, Volume I"|"Arthur Conan Doyle"

Watson, when you reach London you would oblige me by driving at once to Baker Street with our friend here, and remaining with him until I see you again. It is fortunate that you are old school-fellows, as you must have much to talk over. Mr. Phelps can have the spare bedroom to-night, and I will be with you in time for breakfast, for there is a train which will take me into Waterloo at eight.”"|"The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes, Volume I"|"Arthur Conan Doyle"

"~ 02:00"|"about two in the morning"|"“The night was fine, but still it was a very weary vigil. Of course it has the sort of excitement about it that the sportsman feels when he lies beside the watercourse and waits for the big game. It was very long, though—almost as long, Watson, as when you and I waited in that deadly room when we looked into the little problem of the Speckled Band. There was a church-clock down at Woking which struck the quarters, and I thought more than once that it had stopped. At last, however, about two in the morning, I suddenly heard the gentle sound of a bolt being pushed back and the creaking of a key. A moment later the servants’ door was opened, and Mr. Joseph Harrison stepped out into the moonlight.”"|"The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes, Volume I"|"Arthur Conan Doyle"
"> 18:30"|"after 1830"|"The Tories transformed into the Conservative party after 1830, when John Wilson Croker described the faction with that term in the Quarterly Review. (Conservatives may still be referred to as Tories, but the Whigs were subsumed by the emerging Liberal party—which eventually disintegrated and gave way to the Labour party in the early twentieth century.) Out of favor in a time of anti-imperialism, Conservatives weathered a fallow period of three decades before being brought triumphantly back to prominence by Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli (1868, 1874–1880), who saw the need for the party to reach out to a broader populace and encourage social reform. He did this in large part by leading passage of the surprising (for the elitist Tories) Reform Act of 1867, which more than doubled the electorate when previously only one out of every six adult males was able to vote. Disraeli’s courting of the middle and working classes was a master stroke, and it paid off handsomely; as A. N. Wilson reports, “Conservatism, of a sort, was the dominant political creed of the second half of Victoria’s reign.”"|"The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes, Volume I"|"Arthur Conan Doyle"

The theft occurred shortly before quarter to ten (Phelps notes the chimes), after which Phelps and the commissionaire searched the premises—a process that may have occupied fifteen minutes to a half-hour: “The alarm had reached Scotland Yard by this time.” After Detective Forbes’s appearance, Phelps and Forbes took a hansom to the Tangey residence, reaching it “in half an hour.” “About ten minutes later,” the charwoman appeared. The examination of her residence and the return to Scotland Yard might have taken forty-five minutes, all told, and the search of Mrs. Tangey herself, another ten minutes. Phelps was then escorted to Waterloo.

"~ 12:00"|"about midday"|"“My dear Watson, Professor Moriarty is not a man who lets the grass grow under his feet. I went out about midday to transact some business in Oxford Street. As I passed the corner which leads from Bentinck Street on to the Welbeck Street crossing a two-horse van furiously driven whizzed round and was on me like a flash. I sprang for the foot-path and saved myself by the fraction of a second. The van dashed round by Marylebone Lane and was gone in an instant. I kept to the pavement after that, Watson, but as I walked down Vere Street a brick came down from the roof of one of the houses and was shattered to fragments at my feet. I called the police and had the place examined. There were slates and bricks piled up on the roof preparatory to some repairs, and they would have me believe that the wind had toppled over one of these. Of course I knew better, but I could prove nothing. I took a cab after that and reached my brother’s rooms in Pall Mall, where I spent the day. Now I have come round to you, and on my way I was attacked by a rough with a bludgeon. I knocked him down, and the police have him in custody; but I can tell you with the most absolute confidence that no possible connection will ever be traced between the gentleman upon whose front teeth I have barked my knuckles and the retiring mathematical coach, who is, I daresay, working out problems upon a black-board ten miles away. You will not wonder, Watson, that my first act on entering your rooms was to close your shutters, and that I have been compelled to ask your permission to leave the house by some less conspicuous exit than the front door.”"|"The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes, Volume I"|"Arthur Conan Doyle"
"ap 09:15"|"quarter-past nine"|"“Oh, yes, it is most necessary. Then these are your instructions, and I beg, my dear Watson, that you will obey them to the letter, for you are now playing a double-handed game with me against the cleverest rogue and the most powerful syndicate of criminals in Europe. Now listen! You will dispatch whatever luggage you intend to take by a trusty messenger unaddressed to Victoria to-night. In the morning you will send for a hansom, desiring your man to take neither the first nor the second which may present itself. Into this hansom you will jump, and you will drive to the Strand end of the Lowther Arcade, handing the address to the cabman upon a slip of paper, with a request that he will not throw it away. Have your fare ready, and the instant that your cab stops, dash through the Arcade, timing yourself to reach the other side at a quarter-past nine. You will find a small brougham waiting close to the curb, driven by a fellow with a heavy black cloak tipped at the collar with red. Into this you will step, and you will reach Victoria in time for the Continental express.”"|"The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes, Volume I"|"Arthur Conan Doyle"
11:00|"11.00 A.M."|"29Bernard Prunet wonders why Moriarty went to the trouble of chartering a “special” if he believed Holmes and Watson were proceeding to Dover, for the regular Continental Express at 11.00 A.M. would have delivered Moriarty to Dover in time to catch the same ship bound to Calais. Prunet also argues that Holmes could have already decided to leave the train at Canterbury before he even boarded it. Holmes never said explicitly that he intended that he and Watson go on to Paris—he told the porter only that his luggage was to be booked all the way through."|"The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes, Volume I"|"Arthur Conan Doyle"
