"~ 14:00"|"about 2 p.m."|"For the first three hours, the Allied armada pounded away at the coastal forts with much the same ease as in February. The trouble started when the first line of ships was commanded to fall back to make room for the second. During the February bombardment, the Turks had taken note of an odd habit of the Allied fleet, that when reversing course they almost invariably turned their ships to starboard; on the chance that this tradition would continue, they had recently laid a single string of mines in an inlet the Allies would traverse on a starboard turn. Sure enough, at about 2 p.m. the retiring Allied first line steered directly into the minefield. In quick succession, three warships were sunk, and three more heavily damaged."|"Lawrence in Arabia"|"Scott Anderson"
"ap 03:40"|"third of four"|"Faisal was the third of four sons of Emir Hussein, a tribal leader in the immense Hejaz region of western Arabia. Of much greater import, Faisal’s father was the sherif, or religious leader, of the Muslim holy cities of Mecca and Medina, the most recent scion of the Hashemite clan that had served as the guardians of the Islamic holy land since the tenth century."|"Lawrence in Arabia"|"Scott Anderson"
"ap ~ 06:15"|"ABOUT 6:15"|"AT ABOUT 6:15 on the morning of April 25, SS River Clyde, a converted collier out of Liverpool, closed on a small, gently arcing beach—code-named V Beach—at Cape Helles, the southern tip of the Gallipoli peninsula. Crammed belowdecks were some two thousand British soldiers. Coming in on the gentle seas alongside the Clyde were five or six launches, each towing several open cutters, likewise crammed to their gunwales with more soldiers. At about one hundred yards out, the cutter skippers cast off their towlines and distributed oars so that their crews might row the rest of the way to shore. From that shore came no sign of life at all. It appeared, just as hoped, that the landing at Cape Helles had caught the Turks completely off guard."|"Lawrence in Arabia"|"Scott Anderson"
"ap ~ 06:30"|"ABOUT 6:30"|"AT ABOUT 6:30 on that morning, Lieutenant General Fenton Aylmer, the future 13th Baronet of Donadea, received some startling news. In his army’s nighttime march on the town of Dujaila in central Iraq, the 36th Indian Infantry Brigade had become disoriented in the dark. Rather than stop at their preassigned forward position to wait out the dawn artillery bombardment of the enemy, segments of the brigade had continued on across the barren Dujaila plain and directly into the Turks’ forward line. More specifically, they had stumbled squarely up the approaches to “the Citadel,” a forty-foot-high earthen fortress that commanded the surrounding flatlands and formed the strongpoint of the Turkish defenseworks."|"Lawrence in Arabia"|"Scott Anderson"
08:00|"8 a.m."|"When finally the British bombardment commenced—not at dawn as planned, but at 8 a.m.—all element of surprise had been lost, the Dujaila Citadel hurriedly manned by Turkish troops ferried over from across the river. It was another hour before the British frontal assault began. Very quickly, another four thousand imperial troops had fallen in no-man’s-land, without a single one reaching the Citadel."|"Lawrence in Arabia"|"Scott Anderson"
00:00|midnight|"When Madame Frey explained that that was quite impossible given the Régie man’s prominence, the American oilman withdrew from the Frey salon in a huff. Yale’s manservant, a grizzled old Kurd named Mustapha Kharpoutli, came up with an alternative solution. “Oh Master,” he counseled Yale, “I know where ‘the pig’ goes every evening, so give the order and I will finish with him.” As Kharpoutli explained, the Régie man left a particular woman’s house every night at midnight. “It’s on a lonely street. I will kill him tonight if you tell me to.”"|"Lawrence in Arabia"|"Scott Anderson"
"< 17:00"|"Shortly before 5:00 p.m."|"By an odd twist of fate, the westerner who had done more than any other to bring that revolt to fruition would never learn of it. Shortly before 5:00 p.m. on that same day, a Royal Navy battleship cruiser, HMS Hampshire, left its port in northern Scotland to transport War Secretary Horatio Kitchener to Russia. Less than three hours later, the Hampshire struck a German mine and quickly sank in high seas. Nearly every man on board perished, including Kitchener."|"Lawrence in Arabia"|"Scott Anderson"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"IT WAS AN awkward meeting papered over with British politeness. Coming off the Lama in midmorning, Storrs and Lawrence made the short walk through Jeddah’s narrow streets to the handsome three-story building that housed the British consulate, there to be greeted by the resident British agent, Lieutenant Colonel Cyril Wilson. Wilson led his visitors into a cool and pleasingly shuttered reception room—it was not yet ten o’clock, but the whitewashed buildings of Jeddah already radiated a blinding glare—and ordered up refreshments."|"Lawrence in Arabia"|"Scott Anderson"
"ap > 05:00"|"shortly after five o’clock"|"Accompanied by his elaborately costumed court retainers and slaves, Abdullah arrived shortly after five o’clock. Lawrence’s first impression was of a particularly jolly man—perhaps heightened just then by Abdullah’s recent success in the city of Taif, where the long-resistant Turkish garrison had at last surrendered—with a touch of the voluptuary; though he was not yet thirty-five, the sheikh’s face was already taking on the rounded form of one who enjoyed his pleasures and indulged his appetites. His jollity didn’t last long. Dispensing with the elaborate pleasantries that normally accompanied such meetings, no sooner had Abdullah and his chief lieutenants settled in the consulate reception room than Wilson began reading aloud from the Cairo cable as Storrs translated into Arabic. Abdullah listened with a hard-to-read stoicism."|"Lawrence in Arabia"|"Scott Anderson"
"ap ~ 10:00"|"about ten o’clock"|"PRECEDED BY A phalanx of slaves, Abdullah rode on a white mare into the courtyard of the British consulate at about ten o’clock the following morning. He was more somber than the day before, and once settled into the consulate reception room, he explained why. He had just received a cable from his brother Faisal at his mountain encampment north of Rabegh reporting that two Turkish warplanes had bombed his camp the previous afternoon; while inflicting little damage, they had sown terror among the tribesmen, most of whom had never seen such machines before. The news was especially pointed, considering the attack came on the same day the British had canceled plans to send their own fleet of airplanes to Arabia."|"Lawrence in Arabia"|"Scott Anderson"
"ap 06:30"|6:30|"Their somewhat prickly conversation extended through dinner, then started up again at 6:30 the next morning when Faisal showed up at Lawrence’s tent. In these talks, Lawrence found Hussein’s third son to be “most unreasonable,” and yet there was something about the passion with which he spoke, the hard determination behind it, that Lawrence found profoundly compelling. It was a passion he’d found lacking in both Abdullah or Ali, and it fueled his conviction that in Faisal he had found his leader."|"Lawrence in Arabia"|"Scott Anderson"
09:30|"9:30 a.m."|"When he wrote those words, Aaronsohn didn’t know the half of it. On the previous day, as he was again being debriefed by Walter Gribbon, a friendly, slightly chubby man in his midthirties had come into the office to briefly sit in on the proceedings. During a break in Gribbon’s questioning, the visitor inquired after Aaronsohn’s views on Zionism, of where exactly he placed himself amid the galaxy of Jewish political thought. The visitor had listened intently and, before leaving, handed Aaronsohn a calling card, asking if he might be so good as to drop by the indicated address at 9:30 a.m. in three days’ time. Aaronsohn readily agreed. The address on the calling card was 30 Broadway Gate, the London residence of the MP from Hull Central, Sir Mark Sykes."|"Lawrence in Arabia"|"Scott Anderson"
"ap 09:30"|9:30|"Answering that invitation to call on Mark Sykes, Aaronsohn had appeared at the London townhouse promptly at 9:30. Repairing to the exquisitely furnished study, the two men had soon been joined by a third. This was Gerald FitzMaurice, the former dragoman to the British embassy in Constantinople and now one of Sykes’s key allies in the British power structure. While Aaronsohn provided few details of what the three discussed during their ninety-minute conversation—“we talk of Zionism,” he noted in his diary—he’d initially thought it had gone very well. Weeks later, though, with his London stay reaching the one-month mark, he fell to second-guessing. “I was probably too open with them,” he wrote on November 24, “and they took it as a ruse. Or they are distracted or turning a blind eye. Or maybe they saw it as naivete on my part.”"|"Lawrence in Arabia"|"Scott Anderson"
"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"The typical day started with a dawn wake‑up call by an imam, then a leisurely breakfast where Faisal conferred with his senior aides and various tribal leaders. This was followed by a long morning stretch during which any man in the encampment could come to petition Faisal over some concern or grievance; as Lawrence quickly noted, few of these audiences had any direct connection to the war effort. This open-house session only ended with the serving of lunch, often a two-hour affair attended by more aides and tribal leaders, after which Faisal might spend a couple of hours dictating messages to his scribes. That work done, it was more chitchat until an evening meal consumed at an even more languorous pace than the previous one. After that, more dictations by Faisal, more conversations with elders, the reading of reports from various scouting parties, an unhurried, undirected process that might stretch well past midnight—even right up to the imam’s dawn call that signaled it was all about to start over again."|"Lawrence in Arabia"|"Scott Anderson"
"< 02:00"|"nearly 2 a.m."|"As at most every other stage of this star-crossed venture, now entering its seventeenth month, there was to be a snag. With Aaronsohn on board, the spy ship, a small converted trawler named the Goeland, slipped out of Port Said on Christmas Eve, and reached the coast off Athlit by the following afternoon. Aaronsohn made out someone waving a black cloth from the second-floor balcony of the research station, an identification that might have been more definitive had anyone on the ship’s crew thought to bring along a decent pair of binoculars. Waiting for the cover of nightfall to make contact, the Goeland then headed out to the open sea, only to sail directly into a strong squall, a typical occurrence in the eastern Mediterranean at that time of year. Consequently, it was nearly 2 a.m. before the seas had calmed enough to allow it to return to Athlit and release the launch with the two couriers on board, one carrying Aaronsohn’s instructions to his conspirators, the other his monogrammed penknife and special magnifying glass. No sooner had the launch disappeared into the darkness than the storm kicked back up."|"Lawrence in Arabia"|"Scott Anderson"
"ap < 00:57"|"nearly three to one"|"The ensuing battle was a chaotic and fitful affair, one that lasted most of that day and left some twenty of the Arab fighters dead. No doubt contributing to its slow pace—the Turkish garrison of two hundred was outnumbered nearly three to one and demoralized—was the Arab habit of breaking off their attacks to loot and ransack whatever new buildings they occupied. One of the British officers in charge of the ground operation, Captain Norman Bray, was shocked by the rebels’ behavior, noting in his battle report that the result of their freebooting ways was a town “ransacked from roof to floor.” This was the scene that Faisal and Lawrence rode into the following day."|"Lawrence in Arabia"|"Scott Anderson"
"~ 22:00"|"about 10 PM"|"For his part, Lawrence struggled mightily to put the very best gloss on matters, offering in his own report a number of unconvincing explanations to account for their delay in reaching Wejh. Lawrence’s reflexively contrarian response to criticisms of the Arabs by his British comrades was nothing new. Back on the night of December 11, when Turkish forces had approached the outskirts of Yenbo, a British pilot had unsparingly described the panic that gripped Faisal’s forces within the town. His account stood in marked contrast to Lawrence’s own version of events. “The garrison was called out about 10 PM by means of criers sent round the streets,” he reported. “The men all turned out without visible excitement, and proceeded to their posts round the town wall without making a noise, or firing a shot.”"|"Lawrence in Arabia"|"Scott Anderson"
"ap 09:15"|9:15|"Reconvening with Mark Sykes at 9:15 the next morning, Aaronsohn handed over his memorandum on Jaffa. In quick order, Sykes fired off a top-secret cable to the Foreign Office asking them to get hold of Chaim Weizmann at the English Zionist Federation and deliver the following message: “Aaron Aaronsohn asks me to inform you that Televiv [the Jewish enclave of Jaffa] has been sacked. 10,000 Palestinian Jews are now without home or food. Whole yeshuv [settlement] is threatened with destruction. Jemal [Pasha] has publicly stated that Armenian policy will now be applied to Jews. Pray inform [Jewish] centers without naming Aaron Aaronsohn or source of information.”"|"Lawrence in Arabia"|"Scott Anderson"
12:00|midday|"Nor did that battlefield bear much resemblance to the scenery of popular imagination. Instead of the picturesque expanses of sand dunes often associated with the region, much of the Arabian and Syrian deserts consist of dreary gravel plains and barren stone mountains, similar in many respects to the less picturesque corners of Utah or Arizona. In traversing this terrain, Lawrence and his Arab allies survived on a diet of mutton, camel meat, and bread in good times, raw flour in the less good. These meals were chased down with water often drawn from brackish springs or algae-covered ponds, or from wells contaminated by the Turks with rotting animal corpses. Seeking out shade to escape the withering heat of midday often meant encountering that strange and cruel phenomenon common to deserts the world over, great swarms of biting black flies."|"Lawrence in Arabia"|"Scott Anderson"
"> 15:00"|"Shortly after 3 p.m."|"With the Turks pinned down in the center, Lawrence drew on his knowledge of military history to conduct a classic pincer attack, dispatching small units of fighters out in a wide arc to work their way behind the unsuspecting enemy. Shortly after 3 p.m., the trap was sprung, the Arab machine gunners on the flank pouring fire into the now completely exposed Turks on the bluff. With their machine- and mountain-gun crews quickly wiped out, the Turkish troops wavered and then began a disorganized scramble for the safety of the Wadi Hesa gorge. Except there was no safety to be found there either. With all semblance of cohesion gone, throughout the evening and into the night, the fleeing Turks were set upon by Arab cavalrymen and marauding Bedouin, even mountain villagers bent on vengeance or loot. Of the thousand Turkish soldiers who marched into Tafileh, Lawrence estimated their losses at some five hundred dead and wounded, with another two hundred captured, but even this may have been on the low side; he later heard reports that no more than fifty made it back to Kerak, the rest picked off one by one in the gorge. It had come at a cost of some twenty-five Arabs killed, and perhaps three times as many wounded."|"Lawrence in Arabia"|"Scott Anderson"
04:45|"4:45 a.m."|"His sleep was to be interrupted. At 4:45 a.m. on the morning of September 19, Yale was wrenched awake by “a terrific roar that seemed to shake the whole world.” As one, nearly five hundred British artillery guns had commenced shelling the Turkish line all along the Palestinian front."|"Lawrence in Arabia"|"Scott Anderson"
"> 00:00"|"Shortly after midnight"|"SOMEWHERE ALONG THAT ridge outside Damascus, William Yale and the Italian military attaché were also camped that night, wrapped in blankets on the ground beside their Model T as they tried to catch a few hours’ sleep. Shortly after midnight, they were ripped from their slumber by a tremendous explosion; to the north, an enormous cloud of smoke and flame rose above Damascus, the countryside for miles around illuminated in its intense glow. “God Almighty,” Yale said, “the Turks have blown up Damascus.” That first great explosion was followed by many smaller ones throughout the night, geysers of flame and bursting shells arcing across the sky."|"Lawrence in Arabia"|"Scott Anderson"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"General Allenby had arrived in the Syrian capital just hours earlier. Never the most patient of men, he was in a particularly cantankerous mood that day. With his offensive still ongoing—his vanguard was continuing a relentless pursuit of the Turks as they fled north—he’d been forced to take time away from his martial duties to sort out the increasingly nettlesome political situation in Damascus. As a result, when informed that Faisal, arriving on a three o’clock train from Deraa, would be slow in reaching the Victoria on account of his planned triumphal entry into the city on horseback, Allenby had thundered, “Triumphal entry be damned,” and ordered Faisal to be brought to the hotel at once."|"Lawrence in Arabia"|"Scott Anderson"
11:00|"11 a.m."|"But it wasn’t just the Turkish dam that had burst. In one of the more peculiar chain reactions in history, given that their military efforts had been largely autonomous, all the Central Powers had come to their breaking points at precisely the same moment, and all now fell together—Bulgaria at the end of September, and then Turkey and Austro-Hungary in the span of a mere six days. As might be expected, Germany held out the longest, but only by the matter of a week. With their vaunted Hindenburg Line overrun in a half dozen places and their soldiers surrendering en masse, in the early morning hours of November 11, German negotiators met with their Allied counterparts in a railroad car in a French forest to sign papers of armistice, scheduled to take effect at 11 a.m. that same day. In a fittingly obscene finale to this most senseless of wars, a number of Western Front units continued to fight right up until that eleventh hour was struck, with the result that some four thousand more soldiers died on the last morning of the war."|"Lawrence in Arabia"|"Scott Anderson"

At Kenley airfield south of London, however, he discovered his flight had been delayed due to thick ground fog. By 11:30, he was just about to give up and return to London when, amid a partial clearing of the skies, the pilot of a much smaller plane, a two-seater de Havilland making a mail run to Paris, offered to give him a lift. At about 1 p.m., a French fishing boat captain working the waters off the Calais coast heard a plane flying low overhead, invisible in the thick fog, then the sound of a crash. Searching through the mist, the fisherman found scattered mail floating on the calm sea, but nothing else. Neither the body of the de Havilland pilot nor of Aaron Aaronsohn was ever recovered.
