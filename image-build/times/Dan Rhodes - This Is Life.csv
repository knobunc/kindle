  in her bag, she heard a gurgle. Herbert had been woken by the noise, and was rubbing his eyes and looking around in the darkness. Aurélie found the phone, but it had already stopped ringing

  everybody else, and once they were in the auditorium there was no special enclosure reserved for them. They had no choice but to stand or sit alongside the people who had been fast enough to buy
  tickets for the opening night. They all complained about this, of course, and two of them stormed out. Though they had been sent by bitterly rivalrous publications, the pair of them presented a

  With everything that had been going on, Aurélie still hadn’t made it to a children’s boutique, so Herbert was back in his Mona
  Lisa and Eiffel Tower pyjamas for the third night in a row. It was eight o’clock, and since getting back home she had managed to get on top of her chores. On opening the door she had been
  struck by the rancid atmosphere. The smell of the soiled nappies had begun to seep out of the plastic sacks they had been tied into, so she had taken them out with the rest of her rubbish and
  opened the window until the smell had gone. She handwashed some of Herbert’s clothes and hung them up to dry, and the dirty sheets were soaking in a bucket in the shower room. She wiped down
  the tiny stretch of work surface in her kitchen, and when this was done she saw that Herbert had fallen asleep in his nest of pillows on the bed. He had only had one nap all day, and she
  wasn’t surprised that he had fizzled out."|"This Is Life"|"Dan Rhodes"
