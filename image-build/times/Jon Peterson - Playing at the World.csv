charge, recuperating the Hall’s $50 overhead required strong outside
attendance. Happily, a total of ninety-six attendees—only thirty-three of them
IFW members—converged on Saturday, August 24, 1968, for the Lake Geneva Wargames Convention. Suffice it to say that no banquet dinners followed, the closest approximation being coffee and rolls at the Hall a half an hour before the convention officially started at 10:00 AM, though during the day the IFW further profited from the sale of soda, popcorn and hot dogs. [17] The General
later described Gary Gygax, the convention chairman, as “the stereotype mold of a typical 30-ish mid-west family man who might sell insurance.” [AHG:v5n4]
An apt description, though in fairness he worked as an insurance underwriter,
not an insurance salesman. The action spilled over that single day and the bounds
of the Horticultural Hall—gamers occupied the Gygax home on Center Street from
Friday evening until the wee hours of the next morning, and in the Hall itself
played anywhere that games could be staged, including the courtyard lawn,
despite the oppressive August heat. Beyond ceaseless informal gaming, the
organizers had arranged wargaming tournaments for prizes, a modicum of
speeches, displays of military miniature figurines and of course publicity for
clubs, magazines and major game companies like Avalon Hill. The detailed

board wargaming market. Its closest competitor, the fledgling Simulation

SPI by around ten to one in 1970, and closer to fifty to one in 1969—that
follows SPI’s own figures, which might charitably be deemed optimistic. [S&T:#33]
All of the other minor publishers of board wargames combined constituted no
more than one or two percent of the market. Even the top-shelf works of SPI’s star designer, James F. Dunnigan, only became darlings of the market under Avalon Hill’s imprint:

16:14|16:14|"In the medieval literature that Tolkien studied,
this theme has a great deal of resonance. Eddaic literature constantly
references the threat of Ragnarök, a battle that will bring about the
end of the world. While forces massing for a world-shattering confrontation
recur in many ancient religions—notably in the Christian battle of Armageddon
foretold in Revelation (16:14–16)—the Norse account of Ragnarök supplies
a list of various fantastic participants in the final showdown. The Gylfaginning (51), which quotes liberally from the Völuspá, describes the assault
on Asgard led by the fiery sons of Múspell, the Midgard Serpent, the
Fenris Wolf, Loki and the frost giants. On the opposing side are the Æsir, the
Norse gods, including Odin, Thor and Frey. We know that Odin dispatches valkyries
to recruit the spirits of valiant warriors killed in battle for his Välholl,
where men daily practice their martial skills, so that these men can assist the
Æsir when Ragnarök comes—even though the outcome of the battle
has been foreordained. As the battle-lines are drawn by the Eddas, we can see
the prototype for a delineation of fantastic creatures and people into two
camps. Although the Völuspá mentions both the elves and the dwarves in connection with Ragnarök, it assigns them no particular role in the upcoming battle. Giants
are fated to oppose the Æsir at Ragnarök, but in some Eddaic stories
giants and gods cooperate and even intermarry. The vague allegiances of these
beings are not clarified in later folktales either. The elves of Sir Orfeo, for example, are ominous kidnappers, and the various beliefs in elf-shot imply antagonism
towards humans; the fairy tradition, however, furnishes lighter-hearted elves,
like “every elf and fairy sprite” in the Midsummer Night’s Dream. In the fairy tales collected by Grimm, we see dwarves who are benevolent (Grimm #53) and malign
(Grimm #161)."|"Playing at the World"|"Jon Peterson"
"ap ~ 02:00"|"around 1:60"|"Modern maps have a specific scale: one inch on the map corresponds to some larger number of inches in the real world, depending
on the resolution level of the map. The Cassini family’s map, for example, had
a scale of 1:86,400. Although Venturini replaced the wargame board with a map,
he still imposed a one-inch square grid over that map, and he imagined each
square of the grid to be two thousand paces (Schritte) across, which if
we assume a German military pace of rough thirty inches, means his game employs
a scale around 1:60,000, or a bit shy of one mile per square. The size of map
was of less importance to Venturini than its scale; he felt any map sized
between five feet by three feet (2,160 squares, or 60 ranks by 36 files) and
eight feet by six feet (6,912 squares, or 96 ranks by 72 files) would be
equally suitable for his game. [356] Venturini includes a full-color map of that
smaller size in the back of his book, as well as a tinier tactical map (36 by
24, or 865 squares) that shows rivers, fortresses, bridges and similar terrain features. The ability to map his game
onto real and detailed terrain allowed Venturini to claim a more realistic kriegsspiel, one suitable for military schools which trained officers. [357]"|"Playing at the World"|"Jon Peterson"
"~ 18:00"|"around 1760"|"The release of Venturini in 1797, along with the
revision of Hellwig in 1803, inspired a wave of kriegsspiel publications
in Germany, Austria, Italy, France and England over the next twenty years. One
author of the era, Georg Emmanuel Opiz, claimed that his father Johann Ferdinand
Opiz (1741–1812), a former Jesuit and a well-known writer of his time, had
actually invented kriegsspiel sometime around 1760, though the Opiz game did not see print until 1806, when kriegsspiel deriving from
Hellwig already enjoyed widespread acclaim. [358]
By 1804, Hellwig appeared in French, no doubt prompting le Comte de Firmas-Périés
to produce his very Hellwig-inspired Le jeu de Stratégie, ou les éches
militaires in 1808. In Italy, Francesco Giacometti circulated his Nuovo Giuoco di Scacchi, ossia il Giuoco della Guerra first in an Italian
edition in 1793, and then, given certain changes in the political situation of
Italy, in a French-language edition of 1801, Nouveau jeu des éches ou jeu de
la Guerre. Major J. J. von Glöden in 1817 issued a German-language kriegsspiel,
as did Johann Gottlieb Perkuhn that same year. Some openly
acknowledged their debt to Hellwig, like the Zusätze zu den Regeln des
Hellwigschen Kriegsspiel und Veränderung dieser Regeln (1818). No
less than fifteen European authors had weighed in on wargaming before the first
quarter of the nineteenth century had passed. While the great interest in wars
and gaming owes a real debt to Hellwig’s landmark inspiration, it perhaps owes
still more to the extremely volatile military situation in Europe at the time. Kriegsspiel
was birthed by Germans, and significantly, came into its celebrity in an
hour in which the Germanic people’s militaries had suffered crushing defeats
before the armies of the French Empire of Napoleon Bonaparte."|"Playing at the World"|"Jon Peterson"

"ap 01:12"|1:12|"Two years later in 1875, Meckel published his proposed reinterpretation of wargaming (Anleitung zum Kriegsspiel), which notably
considered martial activities on three distinct scales: a “detachment” game at
a map scale of 1:6,250 which emphasized the study of minute tactical details, a
“grand war game” at a scale of 1:12,500 governing the larger movements of
forces, and finally a “strategic” game at the massive scale of 1:100,000. It is
the 1:6,250 detailed tactical maps that borrow his name, the “Meckel maps,” for which he is largely remembered: he emphasizes that the maps should depict in
sufficient detail such terrain features as rivers and villages that the
tactical benefits of stationing troops in these locations will be clear from
the map. His greatest contribution to the future development of wargaming,
however, is the idea that a single action might be considered at several scales,
and thus effectively in several modes. For example, there might be a
strategic-level map showing the breadth of an entire campaign on which opposing
commanders maneuver their armies into place; when those forces meet, they would
be resituated on a more detailed, tactical-level map where subordinate
commanders would direct a battle with only general guidance from above. This
two-mode approach to wargaming is a feature of many later games, including the
campaign games of Scruby, Bath, Gygax and Arneson. The simplification Meckel hoped to inspire, however, failed to manifest—for all his protestations about the
needless difficulty of managing quantified fire effects, Meckel’s wargame still endorses the use of dice and the computation of losses for tactical games played out at this scale."|"Playing at the World"|"Jon Peterson"
"ap 01:12"|1:12|"Totten’s claim that Strategos was “the
result of several years of private study, unassisted by reference to any
foreign code until it had become a finished system” is, however, a somewhat
less credible claim. [413]
The debt that his Advanced Game owes to the Reiswitzian tradition would be obvious to any cursory reader. The referee—yes, Totten calls the administrator of the game a “referee”
rather than an “umpire”—provides a general idea for a scenario, including “special instructions” for each of the two sides (colored red and blue, of
course), the player-commanders and their subordinates submit their orders in writing, and turns represent a five-minute interval of game time (a slight expansion of
Reiswitz’s two minutes). Topographic maps (at a scale somewhere between 1:6,000
and 1:12,000) are recommended for play, ideally with three map instances used
simultaneously: one maintained as the secret master copy of the referee marking
the authoritative position of all units, and one for each of the two contending
sides showing only their perspective on the battlefield. The game pieces in
play are wooden blocks scaled to the size that formations would assume on the
map. When combat or other circumstances requiring judgment arise, the referee
first calculates the “ratios of possibility” from the magnitude of the involved
forces and the tactical situation, and dice resolve the conflict. Victory is incidental to the game and largely undefined; the general idea dictates the circumstances
of battle, and the players themselves are left to understand when it is
appropriate to withdraw from contention. Totten would not have needed “reference”
to any foreign system to assimilate these ideas, which were more than fifty
years old and circulated through many channels among students of military
science long before the kriegsspiel vogue brought actual translations to
America, but they are unmistakably the principles of Reiswitzian wargames."|"Playing at the World"|"Jon Peterson"
12:48|"12 of 13"|"If his ignorance of German work is corroborated
by any particular, it is that Totten shows a tendency toward exactly the faults
that Meckel and Verdy du Vernois hoped to eradicate: the proliferation of rules
and tables. Most of the rules of the Advanced Game are committed to a set of
tables lettered A through W. His Table I, for example, lists some thirty-six exceptional
situations which might arise in a wargame, with the corresponding probabilities
and the canned result of a successful roll—surely derived in form and content
from the “Special Circumstances” tables in Baring’s translation of Tschischwitz. Some seem almost laughably overspecified: for example, No. 15, “Artillery fire
unanswered, if heavy, may a bridge be constructed under it?” (2:1 odds in favor
of no). Or after a battery sets fire to a wooden building, consider No. 27, “The
fire, having taken and 5 minutes having elapsed, has it spread?” (again, a 2:1
chance that it has). Table R shows the many “multipliers” applied to the
calculation of losses (points of damage) due to any number of tactical circumstances: natural or manmade cover, slopes in the ground, morale of troops, quality of weapons, beneficial formations,
ad nauseam—Table R lists no less than 147 numbered “Cases” that might
prevail. In an example Totten gives where the dice indicate thirteen men in an
artillery brigade would have been affected by gunfire skirmishes, he then shows how to apply modifiers: “The several multipliers that affect the result are
given in Cases 9, 16, 54 and 62. These modifiers are respectively 1/15, 7/8,
2/1, and 5/1; hence, by the above rule, we have 1/15 x 7/8 x 2/1 x 5/1 = 7/12,
and 7/12 of 13 = 7 7/12, say, 8 men, or about 1 ‘killed’ and 7 ‘wounded.” [414] The prospect for
a referee of sifting through these Cases for applicable instances and
multiplying the resulting cluster of fractions whenever combat occurs is
nothing less than nightmarish. These are precisely the sort of rules that
Meckel and Verdy du Vernois abhorred, stipulations that are seemingly ignorant
of the enormous gulf between their narrowness and the great breadth of
circumstances likely to arise in a practical game, to say nothing of their
sheer impracticability."|"Playing at the World"|"Jon Peterson"

"ap 01:15"|1:15|"Tactics can thus be seen as something of
a fusion of Hellwig’s board mechanics and Reiswitzian combat, varying more
through simplification than elaboration. In its original 1954 incarnation,
however, Tactics lacked some of the mature features that formed the core
of the Avalon Hill system, and as subsequent games acquired them, they only
came more to resemble the work of Hellwig and Venturini. The unusual Tactics movement mechanism, with a budget of thirty squares of movement divided
across all units, was replaced in the 1958 Tactics II with a much
simpler “movement factor” (MF), a maximum number of squares that each unit
could move in a turn. [482]
In the manner of later Hellwig, players could move all, some or none of their
pieces, and each could move any number of squares up to its MF. By 1960, every
printed unit bore its CF and MF on its face for easy reference; with the
benefit of hindsight, one might say that each unit had an early precursor of a “character
sheet” printed on it. Avalon Hill’s other famous 1958 release, Gettysburg,
restored Hellwig’s idea of unit orientation: each unit counter bore an arrow depicting the direction it was facing, and with that came a system for flanking vulnerabilities. No Battle of Gettysburg could be complete without cannons, and Roberts
faithfully delivers artillery that destroys units at range. Gettysburg also
resurrects Venturini’s fidelity to terrain: it has a definite scale (1 inch equaling a quarter mile, or 1:15,840) and a topographic map of the actual area where the historical battle was fought, including elevation markings which confer
benefits to firing units. Up until 1961, the map of Gettysburg sported
the same square grid overlay as Tactics II, though thereafter it upgraded to the hexagonal “honeycomb” overlay that Avalon Hill popularized in the commercial board wargame industry. [483]
Both Tactics II and Gettysburg also have random weather systems, another feature familiar from Venturini."|"Playing at the World"|"Jon Peterson"
"ap < 02:15"|"near 215"|"The teetotum alone did not liberate Totten from the shackles of six-outcome implements of chance. Totten also recognized
that multiple six-sided dice rolled together produced more nuanced results. The
combinatorial sums of rolling three six-sided dice had long been understood by gamblers, as Section 3.1.3 already illustrated [514]
Totten relies on these general principles in Table K of Strategos to allow a referee to decide several irregular probabilities. When rolling multiple six-sided dice, the odds greatly favor sums in the middle of the possible range; for 3d6,
it is vastly more likely that the resulting sum will amount to 10 or 11 or 12
than, say, 3 or 18. Applying these odds to wargaming, if a referee needs to
resolve an event whose chances are only 1 in 14, one could establish a model
where the event occurs only if a roll of three six-sided dice results in the
sum of 7. For a much more rare event, with prospects of only 1 in 71, a sum of 4
is needed from three dice. Since there is only a 1 in 215 chance of rolling a
three with three six-sided dice, Totten dutifully reports this as a further
probability resolvable in Table K, albeit in a real battle troops are unlikely
to attempt a venture with odds near 215 to 1. The casting of multiple dice, or
at least multiple die rolls, is a feature of several other tables in Strategos, notably Tables M through Q, which model the efficacy of firearms (from infantry rifles to fancier Gatling guns) by consulting three successive die rolls: the
first determines whether the effect is “good” or “poor,” the second
distinguishes those categories into good effects of “deadly” or “heavy” fire
and bad effects of “ordinary” or “ineffective” fire, and the third roll
resolves the resulting numerical loss, modified by the range of targets."|"Playing at the World"|"Jon Peterson"
00:41|0.41|"It may seem wasteful to roll a twenty-sided die
in order to derive a number between one and ten, but recall that ten-sided
polyhedra are not among the Platonic solids, and in fact the construction of a
fair ten-sided polyhedron required no small ingenuity (as will be discussed
below); note as well that ten-sided dice are not among the recommended
equipment in the first edition of Dungeons & Dragons, as
twenty-sided dice served double duty to resolve chances ranging over half the number of their
faces. The Japanese dice described by McHugh are, as he continues: “useful for
simulating an event with a probability of success of say, 0.41. A red die might
be selected for the first digit of the number; a yellow for the second. Since
with two dice there are 100 equally likely ways of turning up a two digit
number, 00, 01, 02... to 99, then 41 of the numbers, usually 01 to 41, or 00 to
40, are selected to indicate success.” When paired, icosahedral dice thus serve as “percentile” dice, which can decide any statistical events expressed in percentile terms. Three
dice can equally well produce a random number up to 1,000. In a footnote,
McHugh helpfully relates that “sets of 3—one each of red, yellow and blue—are
manufactured and sold by the Japanese Standards Association... the price is
$2.50 per set, plus $0.70 postage.” Buried at the end of a book little known
outside of military circles, however, this endorsement could not have brought

of Tractics could not include a twenty-sided die in the first run of their game in the summer of 1971, no doubt owing to the cost and uncertainty of importing
dice from overseas. The rules do however require “a device to generate random
numbers from 1-20,” and they helpfully suggest that “if you do not have access
to a die with 20 sides, it is easy to construct a random number generator known
as a ‘TOAD.’” By this juncture, as already noted in Section 1.7, Tucker had adopted 
a simpler design for his randomizer: a set of twenty poker chips, labeled 1 through
20, that could simply be pulled out of a hat. [523] In the end
analysis, responsibility for finagling a way of generating these numbers
devolved to the purchaser of Tractics; no helpful table in an appendix

twelve noon (official starting time) there were about four people standing

afternoon. Paxson gushes in an unmistakably immersed tone: “What swords were

and what good knights struck to the earth, and what resplendent ladies looked

"ap 01:11"|1.11|"After the decline and fall of the International
Federation of Wargaming in the summer of 1972, the impetus behind national
wargaming clubs shifted to smaller, regional organizations. [736] Several groups
aspired to resume the ambitious activities of the IFW, including some
well-intentioned executives of that defunct organization, as detailed in Section
1.11. The most credible venture, however, came from the American Wargaming
Association (AWA), publishers of the new journal the American Wargamer. Spearheaded by George Phillies, a longstanding IFW member but a vocal critic of the
group’s weak leadership, the AWA assumed a similar democratic structure and
focused on facilitating communication among gamers rather than hosting national
tournaments or conventions. However, the AWA faced an uphill battle convincing local clubs to integrate into any national structure. For example, Phillies corresponded with Gygax late in 1973, inquiring if the LGTSA—at that time a group of roughly twelve members—would consider affiliating with the AWA. “You will have to build slowly and hope for the best,” Gygax counseled him by way of reply. When the
LGTSA put the matter to a vote, it elected not to align itself with the AWA because, as Gygax reported in his capacity as Secretary of the LGTSA, “the organization does not wish to become involved in any matters which are beyond their control.” [737]"|"Playing at the World"|"Jon Peterson"

"ap 10:00"|10|"Grasstek also helpfully explains that “there is
no object to the game, per se, other than to see who can move up the highest,
collect the most treasure, etc.” Nothing in his rules suggests the possibility
of “wilderness adventures,” but most of the core concepts of dungeon adventures
recur in Grasstek. His karma equates to experience, his rank to level (though
rank goes backward, starting at 10 and counting down to 1 as characters
advance), and his three classes correspond to the three basic classes in Dungeons
& Dragons. Eschewing polyhedrons, the entire system uses 2d6 for
virtually all rolls, where doubles usually confer some bonus such as rolling
twice. His endurance system more or less follows the Chainmail cumulative hit mechanic: a troll takes four hits, a giant takes thirty hits. Armor provides
mitigation of damage, such that leather armor will absorb seven hits before it
is destroyed, plate mail fifteen hits. Moreover, as players advance in rank,
depending on their class they gain the ability to take more hits: upon
advancing to the sixth rank, after acquiring 400,000 karma, warriors can take
five more hits, at fourth rank, ten more hits, and at first rank, fifteen more
hits. Wizards act largely through the hurling of “balls” which are purchased in the General Store; other than the basic employment of illuminating “light balls” granted to all starting wizards, a wizard must learn a spell in the dungeon
before purchasing the associated balls in the shop. [771] Other types of
balls include axe, mace, sword and pike balls, all of which deal damage
comparable to the weapon type for a handful of rounds. “Slave balls” allow the
wizard to charm any non-player creature indefinitely, though the wizard may
only keep five slaves at any given time. Priests may cast a heal once after
each battle, which removes 1d6 worth of hits on a target character, and even
wizards can find—you guessed it—healing balls, which heal everyone in the party
of 1d6 hits."|"Playing at the World"|"Jon Peterson"
"ap 01:00"|one|"It begins with: “To judge from published
accounts in wargaming magazines (and I see a lot of local magazines), Dungeons
& Dragons (by Gary Gygax) seems to be the most popular gaming title in
some time.” When Phillies gently reminds the reader of his voracious fanzine consumption, he means for us to recall that as editor of the Guide to
Wargaming Periodical Literature, he published essentially the only comprehensive catalog of articles by subject across all wargaming zines, and thus
he could probably claim an unrivaled perspective on the overall picture of the
wargaming fan community. [788]
To Phillies’s eyes, Dungeons & Dragons represented something
fundamentally new: “Dungeons & Dragons is entirely unlike any
previous sort of wargame (if it is one, a thing of which I am not convinced.)”"|"Playing at the World"|"Jon Peterson"
"~ 06:00"|"approximately 6:00 AM"|"From a system perspective, Petal Throne does
not venture far from the precedents of pre-Greyhawk Dungeons &
Dragons. It retains six canonical abilities (which it terms “Basic Talents”) of characters, though for Wisdom it substitutes “Psychic Ability” and for Charisma it prefers “Comeliness,” and all are rolled with percentile dice rather than the traditional 3d6. One selects a class or “Profession” on the basis of these natural
aptitudes, and while adventuring, one accrues experience points from slaying adversaries or recovering treasure. Petal Throne does include a notably
detailed skill system, ranging from Plebian vocations like that of a barber, mason or tailor, through Skilled jobs like that of a fletcher, jeweler or
scribe-accountant, up to Noble forays as an alchemist, dancer or poet.
Virtually all such skills have some applicability to game situations. The magic
system, in contrast to Dungeons & Dragons, allows casters to select
from a flat list of spells—spells do not have tiers like in Dungeons &
Dragons, and thus a first-level priest can just as easily select “Cure
Light Wounds” as they could “Revivify,” the Petal Throne version of the “Raise
Dead” spell of Dungeons & Dragons. Level does factor into the chance
of successfully casting a spell, however—first-level characters have a base 60%
chance of failing to cast a spell, dropping to 20% at level five and 0% at
level nine, though a high Psychic Ability improves odds at all levels. The
overuse of more powerful spells is curtailed by an intrinsic limit on the
number of times they may be cast per day—a sort of “cooldown” period between
casting. [818]
A priest may cast “Remove Curse,” for example, only once per day. Barker
specifies very narrowly the circumstances in which depleted spells replenish: “All
such spells are automatically regenerated each day at approximately 6:00 AM.
Thus, if one has used one’s Control Person spell and spent the night outdoors,
it would be usable again at dawn of the following day.” The combat system
mostly rehashes Dungeons & Dragons, though it does have an
interesting addition: a system for “Double Damage and ‘Instant Death’” which
stipulates, “If a player throws a 20 on the 20-sided die to hit, he does DOUBLE damage. This must be a ‘natural 20’: i.e., not including any hit bonuses.”
If the player opts to reroll the d20 upon scoring a natural 20, and gets a 19
or 20 on this second pass, “the opponent is instantly dead, whatever its hit dice may be.”"|"Playing at the World"|"Jon Peterson"
"ap 04:00"|"4 o’clock"|"The wargaming industry did not stand still in
the year and half since the release of Dungeons & Dragons; Avalon
Hill and SPI continued to sell board wargames that connected with a substantial
audience. Most Origins attendees had not come there expressly for Dungeons
& Dragons. Greene himself, though clearly not opposed to fantasy games,
signed up instead for tournament play of the new Avalon Hill naval wargaming
hit Wooden Ships & Iron Men—he took second place, incidentally. Traditional wargamers found much to delight them those in three hot days in
Baltimore. Greene gushes, “Let me say that Origins was fantastic, incredible,
constant and total.” This is not to say that the event was free of logistical
problems, as the General reported that “a postcard feedback system had
prepared us for a gradual registration spread fairly evenly over the three
days. When the majority showed up Friday at precisely 4 o’clock (don’t any of
you people work for a living?) pandemonium broke loose.” [AHG:v12n3] Midsummer
in Maryland can boast oppressive temperatures; Greene remembers in particular “the
7th circle of Hell in the dorms where the temperature at night was approximately
95 degrees.” Overall, Johns Hopkins proved a very successful venue for a
wargaming convention. Lou Zocchi, who is not the most uncritical of
commentators, proclaimed, “I’ve never attended a better run convention that
Origins I,” praising the meals at the university cafeteria, the proximity of
the dorms to the gaming halls, and easy access to a Rathskeller adequately
stocked with beer and wine. Kevin Slimak called it “a blast for yours truly,
being one of the better cons I have ever attended.” [AW:v3n1] Charles Starks, who reviewed Origins for Panzerfaust #70, similarly deemed it “a great
success,” even though he stood among the unfortunates trapped in the registration
line for more than an hour on Friday."|"Playing at the World"|"Jon Peterson"

largest convention of hobby wargamers to date, only 120 could participate in
the Dungeons & Dragons tournament. The official schedule printed with the pre-registration forms lists four “trips” of Dungeons & Dragons:

14:56|"four of fifteen"|"Revenue targets as victory
conditions could apply equally well to a Dungeons & Dragons session,
and that is how Gygax adjudicated the tournament at Origins. From the party of fifteen that extracted the largest sum of gold from the hole, Gygax would
select the most instrumental player to declare the overall victor. Fortunately,
one of the attendees who successfully pre-registered for a trip at Origins
wrote a detailed account of his experience: none other than Mark Swanson, whose impressions of Gygax’s dungeon appear in Alarums & Excursions #4. He played
in the first trip, newly arrived from Boston on Friday night, and Ernie Gygax refereed his group of fifteen. All fifteen of the characters were nameless,
pre-generated, and assigned to players in alphabetical order: to ensure that
the trips to begin on equal footing, Gygax needed to mandate an identical party composition across them all. [831]
The luck of the draw landed Swanson a feeble Magic-user. In Swanson’s group,
only four of fifteen had any prior experience with the game, which means that
those other eleven Origins attendees had pre-registered for a baptism by fire—and
furthermore suggests the Gygax family’s personal tutelage introduced many
wargamers to Dungeons & Dragons that weekend."|"Playing at the World"|"Jon Peterson"

paid attendance of “about 900” gamers spread across the three days of the
convention, though anyone familiar with the dimensions of the Horticultural
Hall might, after coughing politely, wonder how exactly they arrived at that
figure. [836]
Eyewitnesses did report exceptional crowding at the eighth incarnation of
GenCon, however, so perhaps it exaggerates only slightly. Dave Glewwe, a newcomer to wargaming conventions, wrote to the Great Plains Game Players Newsletter #19
that “in the main hall, it was too cramped for miniatures. Part of the problem
was the large number of wargamers present. There simply wasn’t enough room for
everyone.” He also complained that the miniatures games filled up too quickly,
in part owing to “those who came at 8:00AM on Friday and signed up for all the
tournaments.” Unsurprisingly, Glewwe found most of the attention focused on a
single type of game: “The latest craze is Dungeons, and it seemed like
everyone played it at least once. I made it to the finals of the Dungeons tournament
but lost out.” Presumably Glewwe here means the DUNGEON! board game, which Lenard Lakofka, dropping in for his first GenCon since 1971, called “the
single biggest hit of the convention.” [LD:#61]"|"Playing at the World"|"Jon Peterson"

process, Kask and Gygax put on a brave face for the release of Blackmoor.
After divulging his troubles as its editor in the Strategic Review, Kask
promises, “Trust us, it will have been worth the wait.” [SR:v1n5] Gygax, in his
foreword, dispenses his usual unrestrained praise of the whole enterprise. He
lauds Arneson as “the innovator of the ‘dungeon adventure’ concept, creator of
ghastly monsters, and inscrutable dungeonmaster par excellence”—a
noteworthy construction, if only to illustrate Gygax’s newfound adoption of the
term “dungeon master.” He continues, “I cannot recommend him more highly than
simply saying that I would rather play in his campaign than any other.” With a
hint of disappointment, Gygax asserts that he is “eagerly anticipating yet more
material from the dread ‘Blackmoor Castle,’” which reminds the reader that Blackmoor

Job 39:9. While the meaning of the Hebrew term employed there (רֵּ֣ים)
and elsewhere is disputed, in antiquity and medieval times in Europe the Greek
and Latin were far better known: the Septuagint gives μονόκερως
for Job 39:9, and for Isaiah 34:7, or Psalm 22:21, the Vulgate
gives Latin unicornes (though in Job, the Vulgate gives rinoceros). The KJV translates as “unicorn” throughout."|"Playing at the World"|"Jon Peterson"

Anticipating that the average British child of the time lacked dice, the Great War Game provides an alternate implement of chance to decide the fate of the injured. “TO DRAW LOTS: Cut twelve pieces of cardboard, each 1” square,
colour six of them red and the other six black. Place them in a
box or bag and shake well up. Then without looking in the box or bag put your
in and take on piece of card out. If it is a red one the soldier lives,
and if a black one he dies.” To decide on the number of available
reinforcements, a similar method is used to arrive at a random number between 1
and 10: “small pieces of card, 1” square, numbered 1 to 10, should be placed in
a box, and each day (of two hours) each side will be allowed to draw out two
numbers.”"|"Playing at the World"|"Jon Peterson"

[IWS:Sep70] Robin Laws, 40 Years of Gen Con, 15, even has a picture of
the Inter-Nation Simulation in progress in the courtyard. Intriguingly, that
picture was taken by Mike Carr, a participant in both the Napoleonic Simulation
Campaign and Blackmoor—thus at least one member of the Twin Cities gaming
circle saw this game first-hand in 1970, an important time in the evolution of
role-playing in the Twin Cities, and perhaps others from that group took in the
game as well. Note that the Inter-Nation Simulation returned to GenCon from
time to time; years later we see that Paul Cote “presides over the sprawling
Inter Nation Simulation” at GenCon XI (1978) at 9AM on Saturday. [DR:#17]"|"Playing at the World"|"Jon Peterson"

From Games & Puzzles, January
1974. In that same article on the history of Diplomacy, Calhamer asserts that “the game was completed in 1954 and [has] undergone
relatively little change since then,” and stresses the insignificance of the
improvements introduced around 1958. Calhamer has made similar pronouncements
in other venues; in a 1966 piece in Diplomania #12, he states: “I
began devising the game in 1953 and completed the first set in 1954.” Calhamer
also provided to Graustark #315 (Aug 1974) an article on “The
First Four Games of Diplomacy, 1953–1954,” records of which had “just
come to light,” detailing the players in each game, the number of moves played
and the final tallies of supply centers held. It is difficult to ascertain how
much these early efforts resembled Calhamer’s finished product, though the
significance of the differences between the 1958 and 1959 rules demonstrates
that the variance could be quite large. In the Diplomania article,
Calhamer reports of early versions around 1953–1954 that “in the first two
games, negotiation was entirely by written notes passed from player to player
at the board” and then avows that this was quickly abandoned in favor of verbal
communications; the 1958 manuscript, however, still requires written
communication between players, which argues that “the first two games” may have
been quite a bit later than Calhamer recalled in 1966. Calhamer’s oldest
reflection on the history of Diplomacy (from late 1963) says that at an
earlier stage in the evolution of the game “there had been several more
provinces in each power; at another England opened the game with a fleet in
Gibraltar, and Switzerland had a defensive army with which it could resist
encroachments on Swiss territory by other powers. An English supply center in
Ireland, a Turkish center in Egypt, and a neutral center in Iceland were once
part of the game” as well. [GRS:#11] Calhamer insists, in the Games &
Puzzles article, that chess and the card game “Hearts” are the only
antecedents of Diplomacy; it seems almost certain, however, that Diplomacy
owes some debt to both the rigid and free wargaming mechanics popularized
at RAND."|"Playing at the World"|"Jon Peterson"

A review from Steve Marsh (Jul 1978) lauds Authentic Thaumaturgy as “the
best reference work on magic that is available on the market,” with the caveats
that its author “is a believer in what he is preaching” and “has a hatred for
monotheists.” [AW:v5n12]"|"Playing at the World"|"Jon Peterson"
