00:00|midnight|"""Dawn, for those with more endurance than myself. I shall retire at midnight, after which the serious drinkers will take over."""|Barrayar|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
"> 01:00"|"an hour after midnight"|"""Yes, sir. Well, sir, they were coming back, I was told, about an hour after midnight, when they were set on by a gang of area toughs. Evidently Lieutenant Koudelka was too well dressed, and besides there's that walk of his, and the stick . . . anyway, he attracted attention. I don't know the details, sir, but there were four deaths and three in the hospital this morning, in addition to the ones that got away."""|Barrayar|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
03:00|"three in the hospital this morning"|"""Yes, sir. Well, sir, they were coming back, I was told, about an hour after midnight, when they were set on by a gang of area toughs.

"> 01:00"|"an hour after midnight"|"""Well, they left the place about an hour after midnight, on foot, and took a wrong turn somewhere. Bothari's pretty upset about that. Thinks it's his fault, for getting so drunk. Bothari and Koudelka both say they saw movements in the shadows for about ten minutes before the attack. So they were stalked, apparently, until they were manuevered into a high walled alley, and found themselves with six in front and six behind."|Barrayar|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
"< 21:00"|"three hours before midnight"|"""I have to jump back a bit now. My man who was assigned to Kou followed them down into that warren by himself. He wasn't one of the men who are familiar with the place, supposedly, and he wasn't dressed for itâ€”Kou had two reservations for some live musical performance last night, and until three hours before midnight that's where we thought he was going. My man went in there and vanished, between the first and second hourly checks. That's what has me going this morning. Was he murdered? Or kidnapped? Rolled and raped? Or was he a plant, a setup, a double agent? We won't know till we find the body, or whatever."|Barrayar|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"Illyan yawned behind his hand, and apologized. ""It's been a long night. My night shift man got me out of bed after midnight. Good man, good judgment. No, that about wraps it up, except for Kou's motivation for going down there in the first place. He went all vague, and started asking for pain medication, when we came to that subject. I was hoping you might have a suggestion, to ease my paranoias. Being suspicious of Kou gives me a crick in the neck."" He yawned again."|Barrayar|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
"~ 11:00"|"about elevenses"|"The bodyguard shook her blonde head. ""I'm fine, Milady. It's about elevenses."""|Barrayar|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
"~ 00:00"|"Around midnight"|"Around midnight they came to a clearing, hardly less black than the shadows, and Piotr at last called a halt. Cordelia sat against a tree, stunned with exhaustion, nerve-strung, holding Gregor. Bothari split a ration bar he'd been carrying in his pocket, their only food, between Cordelia and Gregor. With Bothari's uniform jacket wrapped around him, Gregor finally overcame the chill enough to sleep. Cordelia's legs went pins and needles, beneath him, but at least he was a lump of warmth."|Barrayar|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
12:00|noon|"""Fast. There was no hint of any trouble when I was up to the capital at noon. It must have broken out right after I left."""|Barrayar|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"""Yo. I left the lake day-before-yesterday morning. Missed all the excitement. I expect the news will catch up with me before noon."""|Barrayar|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
01:00|"one, am"|"""Oh, but he's my monster. My good dog."" She always had trouble explaining Bothari, sometimes even to herself. Cordelia wondered if Droushnakovi knew the Earth-historical origin of the term, scapegoat. The sacrificial animal that was released yearly into the wilderness, to carry the sins of its community away . . . Bothari was surely her beast of burden; she saw clearly what he did for her. She was less certain what she did for him, except that he seemed to find it desperately important. ""I, for one, am glad you are heartsick. Two pathological killers in my service would be an excess. Treasure that nausea, Drou."""|Barrayar|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
00:00|midnight|"They zigzagged over bad side roads all afternoon to reach Vorinnis's neutral District, where the aged groundcar died of a fractured power-train. They abandoned it and took to the monorail system then, Cordelia driving her exhausted little party on, racing the clock in her head. At midnight, they reported in at the first military installation over the next loyalist border, a supply depot. It took Drou several minutes of argument with the night duty officer to persuade him to 1) identify them, 2) let them in, and 3) let them use the military comm net to call Tanery Base to demand transport. At that point the D.O. abruptly became a lot more efficient. A high-speed air shuttle with a hot pilot was scrambled to pick them up."|Barrayar|"Lois McMaster Bujold"
