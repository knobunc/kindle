12:00|noon|"“Aw god,” Joe Adams said savagely, and slapped off the sleek, steel and plastic machine with all its many microcomponents; it became silent. He then noticed Colleen. “Sorry. But I’m tired. Why can’t they, Brose or General Holt or Marshal Harenzany, somebody in a position of responsibility, put Sunday night somewhere between Friday noon and—”"|"The Penultimate Truth"|"Philip K. Dick"
04:00|"four this morning"|"Soundlessly—they knew enough to be that—the committee entered his cubby, filled it up. As soon as the hall door was shut, Jorgenson said, “Here’s how we’re going to work it, President. We stayed up to four this morning thrashing it out.” His voice was low, hard, determined."|"The Penultimate Truth"|"Philip K. Dick"
18:00|"six P.M."|"“Here at the Agency,” Dave Lantano said somberly, “in New York, we may compete against each other, but underneath we’re a group. A corporate body. What the Christians used to call a congregation…a very meaningful special term. But then each of us, at six P.M., goes off in his flapple. Crosses an empty countryside to a castle inhabited by mental constructs that move and talk but are—” He gestured. “Cold, Adams; the leadies, even the advanced types who dominate the Council; they are cold. Get a couple of your retinue, all the leadies of your household staff that you can cram into your flapple with you, and go visit. Every night.”"|"The Penultimate Truth"|"Philip K. Dick"
12:00|midday|"There was no answer. Either the battery had at last run down—but his helmet light still shone, although minutely, now, in the presence of the overhead midday sky. He shook the intercom savagely; all at once it seemed more important to find his way back to contact with the tank below than to go on—my god, he thought, my wife and my brother, my people; I’m cut off."|"The Penultimate Truth"|"Philip K. Dick"
09:00|"nine A.M."|"He began the wait as of now. By his round, archaic pocket watch, nine A.M., London time. And, in just a minuscule way, he initiated the celebration: he took one small pinch, one for each nostril, of Mrs. Cluny’s Superfine Preferred Mixture high-grade snuff."|"The Penultimate Truth"|"Philip K. Dick"
"~ 21:00"|"about nine P.M."|"“Fine,” Lantano agreed. “What about nine P.M. at my villa? Nine as computed by my time-zone here. For you that would be—”"|"The Penultimate Truth"|"Philip K. Dick"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"“Sir, I can count time,” Foote said. “I’ll be there. And I’m sure, with your extraordinary abilities, you’ll be able to make use of these maps. You can dispatch your own leadies if you wish, or my corporation can—”
“At nine tonight, my time, then,” Lantano said, and rang off.
“Why?” Cencio asked Foote, after a pause."|"The Penultimate Truth"|"Philip K. Dick"
"ap < 09:00"|"almost nine"|"To Nicholas, Lantano said, “That would be a Yance-man from Northern California named Joseph Adams. An admirer of certain aspects of my work.” To the leady he said, after reflecting a moment, “Tell him to come in and sit down. But at nine I have a business meeting scheduled.” He examined his watch. “It’s almost nine now; make sure he understands he can’t stay for long.” As the leady departed Lantano said to Nicholas, “This one is not entirely without reputability. You may find him interesting; what he does at least produces conflicts within him. But—” Lantano gestured, with finality; for him it had been decided. “He goes along. After and during the doubts. He has them but—he goes along.” Lantano’s voice sank, and again shockingly, the ancient, wizened visage appeared, even older than before; this was not middle-age: this was the glimpse which Nicholas had witnessed as Lantano stepped into the Cheyenne basement, only now he saw it—briefly—close up. And then it was gone. As if it had been only a play of the fire’s light; not a change in the man at all. And yet he knew, understood, that it really was within the man, and, as he glanced around at Lantano’s wife and two children, he caught a fleeting impression, based on the three of them; he saw, as if from the corner of his eye, a waning within them, too—except that for the two children it was more a growth, an augmentation into maturity and vigor; they seemed, abruptly, temporarily, older. And then that passed, also."|"The Penultimate Truth"|"Philip K. Dick"
04:00|"four A.M."|"“We’ve been listening to you for an hour,” Jorgenson said. “Banging and rattling around up there, reopening the tunnel. Naturally we have a full-time alarm system rigged; it woke us at exactly four A.M. How did you make out?” He saw then, in Nicholas’s hands, the aluminum cylinder."|"The Penultimate Truth"|"Philip K. Dick"
"~ 12:00"|"around midday"|"Jorgenson said, “We’ve already notified Carol by intercom that it is you; she ought to be here any second. Be patient. Souza’s deep in the freeze; he can wait another hour. She’ll graft in the pancreas sometime around midday. Meanwhile we’re all supposed to take off all our clothes, pile them up, then outside the door there’s this chamber we built down in the shops; we’ll pass through it, naked, one by one, and jets of ’cide of different types will—”"|"The Penultimate Truth"|"Philip K. Dick"
13:00|"ONE O’CLOCK that afternoon"|"AT ONE O’CLOCK that afternoon Carol Tigh performed—successfully—the pancreas insertion operation on the still-frozen dead Maury Souza, and then, using the tank’s most precious medical equipment, the old man’s circulation, heartbeat, respiration were artificially, externally restored; the heart began to pump blood, then, on its own, and following that one the artificial function stimulators were cautiously and expertly detached from him."|"The Penultimate Truth"|"Philip K. Dick"
09:00|"nine o’clock A.M."|"“Couldn’t tell. Too fragmentary; it lasted—they were able to keep it on—just a split second. I think—” Adams’s voice was low but quite clearly audible as, around them, tankers leisurely, with no particular concern, took their seats, yawned, murmured, chatted. They did not know; they just did not know what this meant, to them, to their future collective and intimate, personally lived, individual lives. “—to tell you the truth, the showdown evidently did not come at nine o’clock A.M. New York Time. Apparently it’s just coming now.” He examined his watch. “It’s six P.M. at the Agency. So something, god knows what, has been going on all day long.” He turned his attention back to the big TV screen, then. And became silent. Waiting."|"The Penultimate Truth"|"Philip K. Dick"
