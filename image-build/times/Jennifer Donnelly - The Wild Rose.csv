But if we could get to Paddington by eleven, and then get a train out by noon, we could be at the cottage by two at the latest. It’s only a short walk from the station. I could settle you there, then come right back.” She went quiet, then started thinking out loud again, almost unaware that she was talking. “My father will be home before I get home, and he’ll wonder where I’ve gone.

She turned her head and, smiling at this one and waving at that one, she looked at the people seated behind her in neat rows of white rattan chairs. The chairs had been divided into two groups and arranged with a little aisle between them. In ten minutes or so, at precisely one o’clock, her brother Seamus would walk down that aisle, to the bower the florists had made, turn around, and wait for his bride. It almost felt unreal to her. She couldn’t quite believe that this day had come, that wild and reckless Seamie had given up roaming, found himself a job in London and a wife, and was ready to settle down. For so long he had mourned the loss of Willa Alden. No woman had ever been able to replace her."|"The Wild Rose"|"Jennifer Donnelly"

When the last echoing tone finally faded away, he spoke. “Oh, we’ll get him, the wily bird,” he said, his voice hard. “We shall stalk him, carefully and patiently. We shall flush him out, and when he tries to fly back to Berlin . . . bang! We shall send a bullet straight through his black and treacherous heart.”"|"The Wild Rose"|"Jennifer Donnelly"
