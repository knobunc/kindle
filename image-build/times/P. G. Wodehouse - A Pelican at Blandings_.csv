the judge and harshly spoken to by both Onapouloses, who
held the view that it was only the incompetence of their

all lavender"". It might have been written expressly with the
Empress in mind. Her best friends won't tell her, but she
suffers from B.O. How is your sense of smell? Keen? Then you
can't miss. And we must make it tonight, for time is of the
essence. Dunstable bought that picture with the intention of
selling it to an American chap called Trout. Trout got here
yesterday. As soon as they've concluded their deal he will
presumably leave and bang will go our chance of making the
