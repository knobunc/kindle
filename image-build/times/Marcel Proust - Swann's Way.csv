00:00|midnight|"When a man is asleep, he has in a circle round him the chain of
the hours, the sequence of the years, the order of the heavenly
host. Instinctively, when he awakes, he looks to these, and in an
instant reads off his own position on the earth's surface and the
amount of time that has elapsed during his slumbers; but this
ordered procession is apt to grow confused, and to break its ranks.
Suppose that, towards morning, after a night of insomnia, sleep
descends upon him while he is reading, in quite a different
position from that in which he normally goes to sleep, he has only
to lift his arm to arrest the sun and turn it back in its course,
and, at the moment of waking, he will have no idea of the time, but
will conclude that he has just gone to bed. Or suppose that he gets
drowsy in some even more abnormal position; sitting in an armchair,
say, after dinner: then the world will fall topsy-turvy from its
orbit, the magic chair will carry him at full speed through time
and space, and when he opens his eyes again he will imagine that he
went to sleep months earlier and in some far distant country. But
for me it was enough if, in my own bed, my sleep was so heavy as
completely to relax my consciousness; for then I lost all sense of
the place in which I had gone to sleep, and when I awoke at
midnight, not knowing where I was, I could not be sure at first who
I was; I had only the most rudimentary sense of existence, such as
may lurk and flicker in the depths of an animal's consciousness; I
was more destitute of human qualities than the cave-dweller; but
then the memory, not yet of the place in which I was, but of
various other places where I had lived, and might now very possibly
be, would come like a rope let down from heaven to draw me up out
of the abyss of not-being, from which I could never have escaped by
myself: in a flash I would traverse and surmount centuries of
civilisation, and out of a half-visualised succession of oil-lamps,
followed by shirts with turned-down collars, would put together by
degrees the component parts of my ego."|"Swann's Way"|"Marcel Proust"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o'clock"|"Then would come up the memory of a fresh position; the wall slid
away in another direction; I was in my room in Mme. de Saint-Loup's
house in the country; good heavens, it must be ten o'clock, they
will have finished dinner! I must have overslept myself, in the
little nap which I always take when I come in from my walk with
Mme. de Saint-Loup, before dressing for the evening. For many years
have now elapsed since the Combray days, when, coming in from the
longest and latest walks, I would still be in time to see the
reflection of the sunset glowing in the panes of my bedroom window.
It is a very different kind of existence at Tansonville now with
Mme. de Saint-Loup, and a different kind of pleasure that I now
derive from taking walks only in the evenings, from visiting by
moonlight the roads on which I used to play, as a child, in the
sunshine; while the bedroom, in which I shall presently fall asleep
instead of dressing for dinner, from afar off I can see it, as we
return from our walk, with its lamp shining through the window, a
solitary beacon in the night."|"Swann's Way"|"Marcel Proust"

12:00|noon|"""I say!"" exclaimed Swann to my grandfather, ""what I was going to
tell you has more to do than you might think with what you were
asking me just now, for in some respects there has been very little
change. I came across a passage in Saint-Simon this morning which
would have amused you. It is in the volume which covers his mission
to Spain; not one of the best, little more in fact than a journal,
but at least it is a journal wonderfully well written, which fairly
distinguishes it from the devastating journalism that we feel bound
to read in these days, morning, noon and night."""|"Swann's Way"|"Marcel Proust"
19:00|"seven o'clock at night"|"And so it was that, for a long time afterwards, when I lay awake
at night and revived old memories of Combray, I saw no more of it
than this sort of luminous panel, sharply defined against a vague
and shadowy background, like the panels which a Bengal fire or some
electric sign will illuminate and dissect from the front of a
building the other parts of which remain plunged in darkness: broad
enough at its base, the little parlour, the dining-room, the
alluring shadows of the path along which would come M. Swann, the
unconscious author of my sufferings, the hall through which I would
journey to the first step of that staircase, so hard to climb,
which constituted, all by itself, the tapering 'elevation' of an
irregular pyramid; and, at the summit, my bedroom, with the little
passage through whose glazed door Mamma would enter; in a word,
seen always at the same evening hour, isolated from all its
possible surroundings, detached and solitary against its shadowy
background, the bare minimum of scenery necessary (like the setting
one sees printed at the head of an old play, for its performance in
the provinces) to the drama of my undressing, as though all Combray
had consisted of but two floors joined by a slender staircase, and
as though there had been no time there but seven o'clock at night.
I must own that I could have assured any questioner that Combray
did include other scenes and did exist at other hours than these.
But since the facts which I should then have recalled would have
been prompted only by an exercise of the will, by my intellectual
memory, and since the pictures which that kind of memory shews us
of the past preserve nothing of the past itself, I should never
have had any wish to ponder over this residue of Combray. To me it
was in reality all dead."|"Swann's Way"|"Marcel Proust"
"~ 16:30"|vespers|"At one side of her bed stood a big yellow chest-of-drawers of
lemon-wood, and a table which served at once as pharmacy and as
high altar, on which, beneath a statue of Our Lady and a bottle of
Vichy-Célestins, might be found her service-books and her medical
prescriptions, everything that she needed for the performance, in
bed, of her duties to soul and body, to keep the proper times for
pepsin and for vespers. On the other side her bed was bounded by
the window: she had the street beneath her eyes, and would read in
it from morning to night to divert the tedium of her life, like a
Persian prince, the daily but immemorial chronicles of Combray,
which she would discuss in detail afterwards with Françoise."|"Swann's Way"|"Marcel Proust"
05:00|"five o'clock in the morning"|"My aunt resigned herself to doing without Françoise to some
extent during our visits, knowing how much my mother appreciated
the services of so active and intelligent a maid, one who looked as
smart at five o'clock in the morning in her kitchen, under a cap
whose stiff and dazzling frills seemed to be made of porcelain, as
when dressed for churchgoing; who did everything in the right way,
who toiled like a horse, whether she was well or ill, but without
noise, without the appearance of doing anything; the only one of my
aunt's maids who when Mamma asked for hot water or black coffee
would bring them actually boiling; she was one of those servants
who in a household seem least satisfactory, at first, to a
stranger, doubtless because they take no pains to make a conquest
of him and shew him no special attention, knowing very well that
they have no real need of him, that he will cease to be invited to
the house sooner than they will be dismissed from it; who, on the
other hand, cling with most fidelity to those masters and
mistresses who have tested and proved their real capacity, and do
not look for that superficial responsiveness, that slavish
affability, which may impress a stranger favourably, but often
conceals an utter barrenness of spirit in which no amount of
training can produce the least trace of individuality."|"Swann's Way"|"Marcel Proust"
"< 12:00"|"before midday"|"""Oh! not before midday!"" my aunt would reply in a tone of
resignation, darting an uneasy glance at the clock, but stealthily,
so as not to let it be seen that she, who had renounced all earthly
joys, yet found a keen satisfaction in learning that Mme. Goupil
was expecting company to luncheon, though, alas, she must wait a
little more than an hour still before enjoying the spectacle. ""And
it will come in the middle of my luncheon!"" she would murmur to
herself. Her luncheon was such a distraction in itself that she did
not like any other to come at the same time. ""At least, you will
not forget to give me my creamed eggs on one of the flat plates?""
These were the only plates which had pictures on them and my aunt
used to amuse herself at every meal by reading the description on
whichever might have been sent up to her. She would put on her
spectacles and spell out: ""Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves,""
""Aladdin, or the Wonderful Lamp,"" and smile, and say ""Very good

Mme. Octave, it's high time I left you; I can't afford to stay here

12:00|noon|"While my aunt gossiped on in this way with Françoise I would
have accompanied my parents to mass. How I loved it: how clearly I
can see it still, our church at Combray! The old porch by which we
went in, black, and full of holes as a cullender, was worn out of
shape and deeply furrowed at the sides (as also was the holy water
stoup to which it led us) just as if the gentle grazing touch of
the cloaks of peasant-women going into the church, and of their
fingers dipping into the water, had managed by agelong repetition
to acquire a destructive force, to impress itself on the stone, to
carve ruts in it like those made by cart-wheels upon stone
gate-posts against which they are driven every day. Its memorial
stones, beneath which the noble dust of the Abbots of Combray, who
were buried there, furnished the choir with a sort of spiritual
pavement, were themselves no longer hard and lifeless matter, for
time had softened and sweetened them, and had made them melt like
honey and flow beyond their proper margins, either surging out in a
milky, frothing wave, washing from its place a florid gothic
capital, drowning the white violets of the marble floor; or else
reabsorbed into their limits, contracting still further a crabbed
Latin inscription, bringing a fresh touch of fantasy into the
arrangement of its curtailed characters, closing together two
letters of some word of which the rest were disproportionately
scattered. Its windows were never so brilliant as on days when the
sun scarcely shone, so that if it was dull outside you might be
certain of fine weather in church. One of them was filled from top
to bottom by a solitary figure, like the king on a playing-card,
who lived up there beneath his canopy of stone, between earth and
heaven; and in the blue light of its slanting shadow, on weekdays
sometimes, at noon, when there was no service (at one of those rare
moments when the airy, empty church, more human somehow and more
luxurious with the sun shewing off all its rich furnishings, seemed
to have almost a habitable air, like the hall—all sculptured stone
and painted glass—of some mediaeval mansion), you might see Mme.
Sazerat kneel for an instant, laying down on the chair beside her
own a neatly corded parcel of little cakes which she had just
bought at the baker's and was taking home for her luncheon. In
another, a mountain of rosy snow, at whose foot a battle was being
fought, seemed to have frozen the window also, which it swelled and
distorted with its cloudy sleet, like a pane to which snowflakes
have drifted and clung, but flakes illumined by a sunrise—the same,
doubtless, which purpled the reredos of the altar with tints so
fresh that they seemed rather to be thrown on it for a moment by a
light shining from outside and shortly to be extinguished than
painted and permanently fastened on the stone. And all of them were
so old that you could see, here and there, their silvery antiquity
sparkling with the dust of centuries and shewing in its threadbare
brilliance the very cords of their lovely tapestry of glass. There
was one among them which was a tall panel composed of a hundred
little rectangular windows, of blue principally, like a great game
of patience of the kind planned to beguile King Charles VI; but,
either because a ray of sunlight had gleamed through it or because
my own shifting vision had drawn across the window, whose colours
died away and were rekindled by turns, a rare and transient
fire—the next instant it had taken on all the iridescence of a
peacock's tail, then shook and wavered in a flaming and fantastic
shower, distilled and dropping from the groin of the dark and rocky
vault down the moist walls, as though it were along the bed of some
rainbow grotto of sinuous stalactites that I was following my
parents, who marched before me, their prayer-books clasped in their
hands; a moment later the little lozenge windows had put on the
deep transparence, the unbreakable hardness of sapphires clustered
on some enormous breastplate; but beyond which could be
distinguished, dearer than all such treasures, a fleeting smile
from the sun, which could be seen and felt as well here, in the
blue and gentle flood in which it washed the masonry, as on the
pavement of the Square or the straw of the market-place; and even
on our first Sundays, when we came down before Easter, it would
console me for the blackness and bareness of the earth outside by
making burst into blossom, as in some springtime in old history
among the heirs of Saint Louis, this dazzling and gilded carpet of
forget-me-nots in glass."|"Swann's Way"|"Marcel Proust"

o'clock"|"It was the steeple of Saint-Hilaire which shaped and crowned and
consecrated every occupation, every hour of the day, every point of
view in the town. From my bedroom window I could discern no more
than its base, which had been freshly covered with slates; but when
on Sundays I saw these, in the hot light of a summer morning, blaze
like a black sun I would say to myself: ""Good heavens! nine
o'clock! I must get ready for mass at once if I am to have time to
go in and kiss aunt Léonie first,"" and I would know exactly what
was the colour of the sunlight upon the Square, I could feel the
heat and dust of the market, the shade behind the blinds of the
shop into which Mamma would perhaps go on her way to mass,
penetrating its odour of unbleached calico, to purchase a
handkerchief or something, of which the draper himself would let
her see what he had, bowing from the waist: who, having made
everything ready for shutting up, had just gone into the back shop
to put on his Sunday coat and to wash his hands, which it was his
habit, every few minutes and even on the saddest occasions, to rub
one against the other with an air of enterprise, cunning, and
success."|"Swann's Way"|"Marcel Proust"
"ap 05:00"|"five o'clock"|"Even when our errands lay in places behind the church, from
which it could not be seen, the view seemed always to have been
composed with reference to the steeple, which would stand up, now
here, now there, among the houses, and was perhaps even more
affecting when it appeared thus without the church. And, indeed,
there are many others which look best when seen in this way, and I
can call to mind vignettes of housetops with surmounting steeples
in quite another category of art than those formed by the dreary
streets of Combray. I shall never forget, in a quaint Norman town
not far from Balbec, two charming eighteenth-century houses, dear
to me and venerable for many reasons, between which, when one looks
up at them from a fine garden which descends in terraces to the
river, the gothic spire of a church (itself hidden by the houses)
soars into the sky with the effect of crowning and completing their
fronts, but in a material so different, so precious, so beringed,
so rosy, so polished, that it is at once seen to be no more a part
of them than would be a part of two pretty pebbles lying side by
side, between which it had been washed on the beach, the purple,
crinkled spire of some sea-shell spun out into a turret and gay
with glossy colour. Even in Paris, in one of the ugliest parts of
the town, I know a window from which one can see across a first, a
second, and even a third layer of jumbled roofs, street beyond
street, a violet bell, sometimes ruddy, sometimes too, in the
finest 'prints' which the atmosphere makes of it, of an ashy
solution of black; which is, in fact, nothing else than the dome of
Saint-Augustin, and which imparts to this view of Paris the
character of some of the Piranesi views of Rome. But since into
none of these little etchings, whatever the taste my memory may
have been able to bring to their execution, was it able to
contribute an element I have long lost, the feeling which makes us
not merely regard a thing as a spectacle, but believe in it as in a
creature without parallel, so none of them keeps in dependence on
it a whole section of my inmost life as does the memory of those
aspects of the steeple of Combray from the streets behind the
church. Whether one saw it at five o'clock when going to call for
letters at the post-office, some doors away from one, on the left,
raising abruptly with its isolated peak the ridge of housetops; or
again, when one had to go in and ask for news of Mme. Sazerat,
one's eyes followed the line where it ran low again beyond the
farther, descending slope, and one knew that it would be the second
turning after the steeple; or yet again, if pressing further afield
one went to the station, one saw it obliquely, shewing in profile
fresh angles and surfaces, like a solid body surprised at some
unknown point in its revolution; or, from the banks of the Vivonne,
the apse, drawn muscularly together and heightened in perspective,
seemed to spring upwards with the effort which the steeple made to
hurl its spire-point into the heart of heaven: it was always to the
steeple that one must return, always it which dominated everything
else, summing up the houses with an unexpected pinnacle, raised
before me like the Finger of God, Whose Body might have been
concealed below among the crowd of human bodies without fear of my
confounding It, for that reason, with them. And so even to-day in
any large provincial town, or in a quarter of Paris which I do not
know well, if a passer-by who is 'putting me on the right road'
shews me from afar, as a point to aim at, some belfry of a
hospital, or a convent steeple lifting the peak of its
ecclesiastical cap at the corner of the street which I am to take,
my memory need only find in it some dim resemblance to that dear
and vanished outline, and the passer-by, should he turn round to
make sure that I have not gone astray, would see me, to his
astonishment, oblivious of the walk that I had planned to take or

"~ 16:30"|vespers|"Eulalie was a limping, energetic, deaf spinster who had
'retired' after the death of Mme. de la Bretonnerie, with whom she
had been in service from her childhood, and had then taken a room
beside the church, from which she would incessantly emerge, either
to attend some service, or, when there was no service, to say a
prayer by herself or to give Théodore a hand; the rest of her time
she spent in visiting sick persons like my aunt Léonie, to whom she
would relate everything that had occurred at mass or vespers. She
was not above adding occasional pocket-money to the little income
which was found for her by the family of her old employers by going
from time to time to look after the Curé's linen, or that of some
other person of note in the clerical world of Combray. Above a
mantle of black cloth she wore a little white coif that seemed
almost to attach her to some Order, and an infirmity of the skin
had stained part of her cheeks and her crooked nose the bright red
colour of balsam. Her visits were the one great distraction in the
life of my aunt Léonie, who now saw hardly anyone else, except the
reverend Curé. My aunt had by degrees erased every other visitor's
name from her list, because they all committed the fatal error, in
her eyes, of falling into one or other of the two categories of
people she most detested. One group, the worse of the two, and the
one of which she rid herself first, consisted of those who advised
her not to take so much care of herself, and preached (even if only
negatively and with no outward signs beyond an occasional
disapproving silence or doubting smile) the subversive doctrine
that a sharp walk in the sun and a good red beefsteak would do her
more good (her, who had had two dreadful sips of Vichy water on her
stomach for fourteen hours!) than all her medicine bottles and her
bed. The other category was composed of people who appeared to
believe that she was more seriously ill than she thought, in fact
that she was as seriously ill as she said. And so none of those
whom she had allowed upstairs to her room, after considerable
hesitation and at Franchise's urgent request, and who in the course
of their visit had shewn how unworthy they were of the honour which
had been done them by venturing a timid: ""Don't you think that if
you were just to stir out a little on really fine days...?"" or who,
on the other hand, when she said to them: ""I am very low, very low;
nearing the end, dear friends!"" had replied: ""Ah, yes, when one has
no strength left! Still, you may last a while yet""; each party
alike might be certain that her doors would never open to them
again. And if Françoise was amused by the look of consternation on
my aunt's face whenever she saw, from her bed, any of these people
in the Rue du Saint-Esprit, who looked as if they were coming to

heartily, as at a clever trick, at my aunt's devices (which never
failed) for having them sent away, and at their look of
discomfiture when they had to turn back without having seen her;
and would be filled with secret admiration for her mistress, whom
she felt to be superior to all these other people, inasmuch as she
could and did contrive not to see them. In short, my aunt
stipulated, at one and the same time, that whoever came to see her
must approve of her way of life, commiserate with her in her
sufferings, and assure her of an ultimate recovery."|"Swann's Way"|"Marcel Proust"

to distract my aunt without tiring her, her visits, which took
place regularly every Sunday, unless something unforeseen occurred
to prevent them, were for my aunt a pleasure the prospect of which
kept her on those days in a state of expectation, appetising enough
to begin with, but at once changing to the agony of a hunger too
long unsatisfied if Eulalie were a minute late in coming. For, if
unduly prolonged, the rapture of waiting for Eulalie became a
torture, and my aunt would never cease from looking at the time,
and yawning, and complaining of each of her symptoms in turn.
Eulalie's ring, if it sounded from the front door at the very end
of the day, when she was no longer expecting it, would almost make
her ill. For the fact was that on Sundays she thought of nothing
else than this visit, and the moment that our luncheon was ended
Françoise would become impatient for us to leave the dining-room so
that she might go upstairs to 'occupy' my aunt. But—and this more
than ever from the day on which fine weather definitely set in at
Combray—the proud hour °f noon, descending from the steeple of
Saint-Hilaire which it blazoned for a moment with the twelve points
of its sonorous crown, would long have echoed about our table,
beside the 'holy bread,' which too had come in, after church, in
its familiar way; and we would still be found seated in front of
our Arabian Nights plates, weighed down by the heat of the day, and
even more by our heavy meal. For upon the permanent foundation of
eggs, cutlets, potatoes, preserves, and biscuits, whose appearance
on the table she no longer announced to us, Françoise would add—as
the labour of fields and orchards, the harvest of the tides, the
luck of the markets, the kindness of neighbours, and her own genius
might provide; and so effectively that our bill of fare, like the
quatrefoils that were carved on the porches of cathedrals in the
thirteenth century, reflected to some extent the march of the
seasons and the incidents of human life—a brill, because the
fish-woman had guaranteed its freshness; a turkey, because she had
seen a beauty in the market at Roussainville-le-Pin; cardoons with
marrow, because she had never done them for us in that way before;
a roast leg of mutton, because the fresh air made one hungry and
there would be plenty of time for it to 'settle down' in the seven
hours before dinner; spinach, by way of a change; apricots, because
they were still hard to get; gooseberries, because in another
fortnight there would be none left; raspberries, which M. Swann had
brought specially; cherries, the first to come from the
cherry-tree, which had yielded none for the last two years; a cream
cheese, of which in those days I was extremely fond; an almond
cake, because she had ordered one the evening before; a fancy loaf,
because it was our turn to 'offer' the holy bread. And when all
these had been eaten, a work composed expressly for ourselves, but
dedicated more particularly to my father, who had a fondness for
such things, a cream of chocolate, inspired in the mind, created by
the hand of Françoise, would be laid before us, light and fleeting
as an 'occasional piece' of music, into which she had poured the
whole of her talent. Anyone who refused to partake of it, saying:
""No, thank you, I have finished; I am not hungry,"" would at once
have been lowered to the level of the Philistines who, when an
artist makes them a present of one of his works, examine its weight
and material, whereas what is of value is the creator's intention
and his signature. To have left even the tiniest morsel in the dish

"ap 02:15"|"quarter past two"|"In earlier days I would not have lingered in the sacred grove
which surrounded this temple, for, before going upstairs to read, I
would steal into the little sitting-room which my uncle Adolphe, a
brother of my grandfather and an old soldier who had retired from
the service as a major, used to occupy on the ground floor, a room
which, even when its opened windows let in the heat, if not
actually the rays of the sun which seldom penetrated so far, would
never fail to emit that vague and yet fresh odour, suggesting at
once an open-air and an old-fashioned kind of existence, which sets
and keeps the nostrils dreaming when one goes into a disused
gun-room. But for some years now I had not gone into my uncle
Adolphe's room, since he no longer came to Combray on account of a
quarrel which had arisen between him and my family, by my fault,
and in the following circumstances: Once or twice every month, in
Paris, I used to be sent to pay him a. visit, as he was finishing
his luncheon, wearing a plain alpaca coat, and waited upon by his
servant in a working-jacket of striped linen, purple and white. He
would complain that I had not been to see him for a long time; that
he was being neglected; he would offer me a marchpane or a
tangerine, and we would cross a room in which no one ever sat,
whose fire was never lighted, whose walls were picked out with
gilded mouldings, its ceiling painted blue in imitation of the sky,
and its furniture upholstered in satin, as at my grandparents',
only yellow; then we would enter what he called his 'study,' a room
whose walls were hung with prints which shewed, against a dark
background, a plump and rosy goddess driving a car, or standing
upon a globe, or wearing a star on her brow; pictures which were
popular under the Second Empire because there was thought to be
something about them that suggested Pompeii, which were then
generally despised, and which now people are beginning to collect
again for one single and consistent reason (despite any others
which they may advance), namely, that they suggest the Second
Empire. And there I would stay with my uncle until his man came,
with a message from the coachman, to ask him at what time he would
like the carriage. My uncle would then be lost in meditation, while
his astonished servant stood there, not daring to disturb him by
the least movement, wondering and waiting for his answer, which
never varied. For in the end, after a supreme crisis of hesitation,
my uncle would utter, infallibly, the words: ""A quarter past two,""
which the servant would echo with amazement, but without disputing
them: ""A quarter past two! Very good, sir... I will go and tell
him...."""|"Swann's Way"|"Marcel Proust"

never have understood my doing save on a Sunday, that being the day
on which it was unlawful to indulge in any serious occupation, and
on which she herself would lay aside her sewing (on a week-day she
would have said, ""How you can go on amusing yourself with a book;
it isn't Sunday, you know!"" putting into the word 'amusing' an
implication of childishness and waste of time), my aunt Léonie
would be gossiping with Françoise until it was time for Eulalie to
arrive. She would tell her that she had just seen Mme. Goupil go by

not acquainted with Saturday's special customs) who had called at
eleven o'clock to speak to my father, and had found us at table,
was an event which used to cause Françoise as much merriment as,
perhaps, anything that had ever happened in her life. And if she
found it amusing that the nonplussed visitor should not have known,
beforehand, that we had our luncheon an hour earlier on Saturday,
it was still more irresistibly funny that my father himself (fully
as she sympathised, from the bottom of her heart, with the rigid
chauvinism which prompted him) should never have dreamed that the
barbarian could fail to be aware of so simple a matter, and so had
replied, with no further enlightenment of the other's surprise at
seeing us already in the dining-room: ""You see, it's Saturday."" On
reaching this point in the story, Françoise would pause to wipe the
tears of merriment from her eyes, and then, to add to her own
enjoyment, would prolong the dialogue, inventing a further reply
for the visitor to whom the word 'Saturday' had conveyed nothing.
And so far from our objecting to these interpolations, we would
feel that the story was not yet long enough, and would rally her
with: ""Oh, but surely he said something else as well. There was
more than that, the first time you told it."""|"Swann's Way"|"Marcel Proust"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o'clock"|"Passing by (on his left-hand side, and on what, although raised
some way above the street, was the ground floor of the house)
Odette's bedroom, which looked out to the back over another little
street running parallel with her own, he had climbed a staircase
that went straight up between dark painted walls, from which hung
Oriental draperies, strings of Turkish beads, and a huge Japanese
lantern, suspended by a silken cord from the ceiling (which last,
however, so that her visitors should not have to complain of the
want of any of the latest comforts of Western civilisation, was
lighted by a gas-jet inside), to the two drawing-rooms, large and
small. These were entered through a narrow lobby, the wall of
which, chequered with the lozenges of a wooden trellis such as you
see on garden walls, only gilded, was lined from end to end by a
long rectangular box in which bloomed, as though in a hothouse, a
row of large chrysanthemums, at that time still uncommon, though by
no means so large as the mammoth blossoms which horticulturists
have since succeeded in making grow. Swann was irritated, as a
rule, by the sight of these flowers, which had then been 'the rage'
in Paris for about a year, but it had pleased him, on this
occasion, to see the gloom of the little lobby shot with rays of
pink and gold and white by the fragrant petals of these ephemeral
stars, which kindle their cold fires in the murky atmosphere of
winter afternoons. Odette had received him in a tea-gown of pink
silk, which left her neck and arms bare. She had made him sit down
beside her in one of the many mysterious little retreats which had
been contrived in the various recesses of the room, sheltered by
enormous palmtrees growing out of pots of Chinese porcelain, or by
screens upon which were fastened photographs and fans and bows of
ribbon. She had said at once, ""You're not comfortable there; wait a
minute, I'll arrange things for you,"" and with a titter of
laughter, the complacency of which implied that some little
invention of her own was being brought into play, she had installed
behind his head and beneath his feet great cushions of Japanese
silk, which she pummelled and buffeted as though determined to
lavish on him all her riches, and regardless of their value. But
when her footman began to come into the room, bringing, one after
another, the innumerable lamps which (contained, mostly, in
porcelain vases) burned singly or in pairs upon the different
pieces of furniture as upon so many altars, rekindling in the
twilight, already almost nocturnal, of this winter afternoon, the
glow of a sunset more lasting, more roseate, more human—filling,
perhaps, with romantic wonder the thoughts of some solitary lover,
wandering in the street below and brought to a standstill before
the mystery of the human presence which those lighted windows at
once revealed and screened from sight—she had kept an eye sharply
fixed on the servant, to see whether he set each of the lamps down
in the place appointed it. She felt that, if he were to put even
one of them where it ought not to be, the general effect of her
drawing-room would be destroyed, and that her portrait, which
rested upon a sloping easel draped with plush, would not catch the
light. And so, with feverish impatience, she followed the man's
clumsy movements, scolding him severely when he passed too close to
a pair of beaupots, which she made a point of always tidying
herself, in case the plants should be knocked over—and went across
to them now to make sure that he had not broken off any of the
flowers. She found something 'quaint' in the shape of each of her
Chinese ornaments, and also in her orchids, the cattleyas
especially (these being, with chrysanthemums, her favourite
flowers), because they had the supreme merit of not looking in the
least like other flowers, but of being made, apparently, out of
scraps of silk or satin. ""It looks just as though it had been cut
out of the lining of my cloak,"" she said to Swann, pointing to an
orchid, with a shade of respect in her voice for so 'smart' a
flower, for this distinguished, unexpected sister whom nature had
suddenly bestowed upon her, so far removed from her in the scale of
existence, and yet so delicate, so refined, so much more worthy
than many real women of admission to her drawing-room. As she drew
his attention, now to the fiery-tongued dragons painted upon a bowl
or stitched upon a fire-screen, now to a fleshy cluster of orchids,
now to a dromedary of inlaid silver-work with ruby eyes, which kept
company, upon her mantelpiece, with a toad carved in jade, she
would pretend now to be shrinking from the ferocity of the monsters
or laughing at their absurdity, now blushing at the indecency of
the flowers, now carried away by an irresistible desire to run
across and kiss the toad and dromedary, calling them 'darlings.'
And these affectations were in sharp contrast to the sincerity of
some of her attitudes, notably her devotion to Our Lady of the
Laghetto who had once, when Odette was living at Nice, cured her of
a mortal illness, and whose medal, in gold, she always carried on
her person, attributing to it unlimited powers. She poured out
Swann's tea, inquired ""Lemon or cream?"" and, on his answering
""Cream, please,"" went on, smiling, ""A cloud!"" And as he pronounced
it excellent, ""You see, I know just how you like it."" This tea had
indeed seemed to Swann, just as it seemed to her, something
precious, and love is so far obliged to find some justification for
itself, some guarantee of its duration in pleasures which, on the
contrary, would have no existence apart from love and must cease
with its passing, that when he left her, at seven o'clock, to go
and dress for the evening, all the way home, sitting bolt upright
in his brougham, unable to repress the happiness with which the
afternoon's adventure had filled him, he kept on repeating to
himself: ""What fun it would be to have a little woman like that in
a place where one could always be certain of finding, what one
never can be certain of finding, a really good cup of tea."" An hour
or so later he received a note from Odette, and at once recognised
that florid handwriting, in which an affectation of British
stiffness imposed an apparent discipline upon its shapeless
characters, significant, perhaps, to less intimate eyes than his,
of an untidiness of mind, a fragmentary education, a want of
sincerity and decision. Swann had left his cigarette-case at her
house. ""Why,"" she wrote, ""did you not forget your heart also? I
should never have let you have that back."""|"Swann's Way"|"Marcel Proust"
12:00|midday|"It was not only Odette's indifference, however, that he must
take pains to circumvent; it was also, not infrequently, his own;
feeling that, since Odette had had every facility for seeing him,
she seemed no longer to have very much to say to him when they did
meet, he was afraid lest the manner—at once trivial, monotonous,
and seemingly unalterable—which she now adopted when they were
together should ultimately destroy in him that romantic hope, that
a day might come when she would make avowal of her passion, by
which hope alone he had become and would remain her lover. And so
to alter, to give a fresh moral aspect to that Odette, of whose
unchanging mood he was afraid of growing weary, he wrote, suddenly,
a letter full of hinted discoveries and feigned indignation, which
he sent off so that it should reach her before dinner-time. He knew
that she would be frightened, and that she would reply, and he
hoped that, when the fear of losing him clutched at her heart, it
would force from her words such as he had never yet heard her
utter: and he was right—by repeating this device he had won from
her the most affectionate letters that she had, so far, written
him, one of them (which she had sent to him at midday by a special
messenger from the Maison Dorée—it was the day of the Paris-Murcie
Fête given for the victims of the recent floods in Murcia)
beginning ""My dear, my hand trembles so that I can scarcely
write——""; and these letters he had kept in the same drawer as the
withered chrysanthemum. Or else, if she had not had time to write,
when he arrived at the Verdurins' she would come running up to him
with an ""I've something to say to you!"" and he would gaze curiously
at the revelation in her face and speech of what she had hitherto
kept concealed from him of her heart."|"Swann's Way"|"Marcel Proust"
"ap 05:00"|"five o'clock"|"And if Swann were to ask her what she meant by that, she would
answer, with a touch of contempt, ""Smart places! Why, good heavens,
just fancy, at your age, having to be told what the smart places
are in Paris! What do you expect me to say? Well, on Sunday
mornings there's the Avenue de l'Impératrice, and round the lake at
five o'clock, and on Thursdays the Eden-Théâtre, and the Hippodrome
on Fridays; then there are the balls..."""|"Swann's Way"|"Marcel Proust"

to meet Odette at the Verdurins', or rather at one of the open-air
restaurants which they liked to frequent in the Bois and especially
at Saint-Cloud, he would go to dine in one of those fashionable
houses in which, at one time, he had been a constant guest. He did
not wish to lose touch with people who, for all that he knew, might
be of use, some day, to Odette, and thanks to whom he was often, in
the meantime, able to procure for her some privilege or pleasure.
Besides, he had been used for so long to the refinement and comfort
of good society that, side by side with his contempt, there had
grown up also a desperate need for it, with the result that, when
he had reached the point after which the humblest lodgings appeared
to him as precisely on a par with the most princely mansions, his
senses were so thoroughly accustomed to the latter that he could
not enter the former without a feeling of acute discomfort. He had
the same regard—to a degree of identity which they would never have
suspected—for the little families with small incomes who asked him
to dances in their flats (""straight upstairs to the fifth floor,
and the door on the left"") as for the Princesse de Parme, who gave
the most splendid parties in Paris; but he had not the feeling of
being actually 'at the ball' when he found himself herded with the
fathers of families in the bedroom of the lady of the house, while
the spectacle of wash-hand-stands covered over with towels, and of
beds converted into cloak-rooms, with a mass of hats and
great-coats sprawling over their counterpanes, gave him the same
stifling sensation that, nowadays, people who have been used for
half a lifetime to electric light derive from a smoking lamp or a
candle that needs to be snuffed. If he were dining out, he would
order his carriage for half-past seven; while he changed his
clothes, he would be wondering, all the time, about Odette, and in
this way was never alone, for the constant thought of Odette gave
to the moments in which he was separated from her the same peculiar
charm as to those in which she was at his side. He would get into
his carriage and drive off, but he knew that this thought had
jumped in after him and had settled down upon his knee, like a pet
animal which he might take everywhere, and would keep with him at
the dinner-table, unobserved by his fellow-guests. He would stroke
and fondle it, warm himself with it, and, as a feeling of languor
swept over him, would give way to a slight shuddering movement
which contracted his throat and nostrils—a new experience, this,—as
he fastened the bunch of columbines in his buttonhole. He had for
some time been feeling neither well nor happy, especially since
Odette had brought Forcheville to the Verdurins', and he would have
liked to go away for a while to rest in the country. But he could
never summon up courage to leave Paris, even for a day, while
Odette was there. The weather was warm; it was the finest part of
the spring. And for all that he was driving through a city of stone
to immure himself in a house without grass or garden, what was
incessantly before his eyes was a park which he owned, near
Combray, where, at four in the afternoon, before coming to the
asparagus-bed, thanks to the breeze that was wafted across the
fields from Méséglise, he could enjoy the fragrant coolness of the
air as well beneath an arbour of hornbeams in the garden as by the
bank of the pond, fringed with forget-me-not and iris; and where,
when he sat down to dinner, trained and twined by the gardener's
skilful hand, there ran all about his table currant-bush and
rose."|"Swann's Way"|"Marcel Proust"

"ap 03:00"|"three o'clock"|"He did not, however, draw her attention to this inconsistency,
for he thought that, if left to herself, Odette might perhaps
produce some falsehood which would give him a faint indication of
the truth; she spoke; he did not interrupt her, he gathered up,
with an eager and sorrowful piety, the words that fell from her
lips, feeling (and rightly feeling, since she was hiding the truth
behind them as she spoke) that, like the veil of a sanctuary, they
kept a vague imprint, traced a faint outline of that infinitely
precious and, alas, undiscoverable truth;—what she had been doing,
that afternoon, at three o'clock, when he had called,—a truth of
which he would never possess any more than these falsifications,
illegible and divine traces, a truth which would exist henceforward
only in the secretive memory of this creature, who would
contemplate it in utter ignorance of its value, but would never
yield it up to him. It was true that he had, now and then, a strong
suspicion that Odette's daily activities were not hi themselves
passionately interesting, and that such relations as she might have
with other men did not exhale, naturally, in a universal sense, or
for every rational being, a spirit of morbid gloom capable of
infecting with fever or of inciting to suicide. He realised, at
such moments, that that interest, that gloom, existed in him only
as a malady might exist, and that, once he was cured of the malady,
the actions of Odette, the kisses that she might have bestowed,
would become once again as innocuous as those of countless other
women. But the consciousness that the painful curiosity with which
Swann now studied them had its origin only in himself was not
enough to make him decide that it was unreasonable to regard that
curiosity as important, and to take every possible step to satisfy
it. Swann had, in fact, reached an age the philosophy of
which—supported, in his case, by the current philosophy of the day,
as well as by that of the circle in which he had spent most of his
life, the group that surrounded the Princesse des Laumes, in which
one's intelligence was understood to increase with the strength of
one's disbelief in everything, and nothing real and incontestable
was to be discovered, except the individual tastes of each of its
members—is no longer that of youth, but a positive, almost a
medical philosophy, the philosophy of men who, instead of fixing
their aspirations upon external objects, endeavour to separate from
the accumulation of the years already spent a definite residue of
habits and passions which they can regard as characteristic and
permanent, and with which they will deliberately arrange, before
anything else, that the kind of existence which they choose to
adopt shall not prove inharmonious. Swann deemed it wise to make
allowance in his life for the suffering which he derived from not
knowing what Odette had done, just as he made allowance for the
impetus which a damp climate always gave to his eczema; to
anticipate in his budget the expenditure of a considerable sum on
procuring, with regard to the daily occupations of Odette,
information the lack of which would make him unhappy, just as he
reserved a margin for the gratification of other tastes from which
he knew that pleasure was to be expected (at least, before he had
fallen in love) such as his taste for collecting things, or for
good cooking."|"Swann's Way"|"Marcel Proust"

for having treated Forcheville with so little ceremony, and
reminded him that he had left his cigarette-case at her house,
precisely what she had written to Swann after one of his first
visits. But to Swann she had added: ""Why did you not forget your
heart also? I should never have let you have that back."" To
Forcheville nothing of that sort; no allusion that could suggest
any intrigue between them. And, really, he was obliged to admit
that in all this business Forcheville had been worse treated than
himself, since Odette was writing to him to make him believe that
her visitor had been an uncle. From which it followed that he,
Swann, was the man to whom she attached importance, and for whose
sake she had sent the other away. And yet, if there had been
nothing between Odette and Forcheville, why not have opened the
door at once, why have said, ""I was right to open the door; it was
my uncle."" Right? if she was doing nothing wrong at that moment how
could Forcheville possibly have accounted for her not opening the
door? For a time Swann stood still there, heartbroken, bewildered,
and yet happy; gazing at this envelope which Odette had handed to
him without a scruple, so absolute was her trust in his honour;
through its transparent window there had been disclosed to him,
with the secret history of an incident which he had despaired of
ever being able to learn, a fragment of the life of Odette, seen as
through a narrow, luminous incision, cut into its surface without
her knowledge. Then his jealousy rejoiced at the discovery, as
though that jealousy had had an independent existence, fiercely
egotistical, gluttonous of every thing that would feed its
vitality, even at the expense of Swann himself. Now it had food in
store, and Swann could begin to grow uneasy afresh every evening,
over the visits that Odette had received about five o'clock, and
could seek to discover where Forcheville had been at that hour. For
Swann's affection for Odette still preserved the form which had
been imposed on it, from the beginning, by his ignorance of the
occupations in which she passed her days, as well as by the mental
lethargy which prevented him from supplementing that ignorance by
imagination. He was not jealous, at first, of the whole of Odette's
life, but of those moments only in which an incident, which he had
perhaps misinterpreted, had led him to suppose that Odette might
have played him false. His jealousy, like an octopus which throws
out a first, then a second, and finally a third tentacle, fastened
itself irremovably first to that moment, five o'clock in the
afternoon, then to another, then to another again. But Swann was
incapable of inventing his sufferings. They were only the memory,
the perpetuation of a suffering that had come to him from

and Pierrefonds without letting it be supposed that his object was

the Marquis de Forestelle, who had a country house in that
neighbourhood. This friend, to whom Swann suggested the plan
without disclosing its ulterior purpose, was beside himself with
joy; he did not conceal his astonishment at Swann's consenting at
last, after fifteen years, to come down and visit his property, and
since he did not (he told him) wish to stay there, promised to
spend some days, at least, in taking him for walks and excursions
in the district. Swann imagined himself down there already with M.
de Forestelle. Even before he saw Odette, even if he did not
succeed in seeing her there, what a joy it would be to set foot on
that soil where, not knowing the exact spot in which, at any
moment, she was to be found, he would feel all around him the
thrilling possibility of her suddenly appearing: in the courtyard
of the Château, now beautiful in his eyes since it was on her
account that he had gone to visit it; in all the streets of the
town, which struck him as romantic; down every ride of the forest,
roseate with the deep and tender glow of sunset;—innumerable and
alternative hiding-places, to which would fly simultaneously for
refuge, in the uncertain ubiquity of his hopes, his happy, vagabond
and divided heart. ""We mustn't, on any account,"" he would warn M.
de Forestelle, ""run across Odette and the Verdurins. I have just
heard that they are at Pierrefonds, of all places, to-day. One has
plenty of time to see them in Paris; it would hardly be worth while
coming down here if one couldn't go a yard without meeting them.""
And his host would fail to understand why, once they had reached
the place, Swann would change his plans twenty times in an hour,
inspect the dining-rooms of all the hotels in Compiègne without
being able to make up his mind to settle down in any of them,
although he had found no trace anywhere of the Verdurins, seeming
to be in search of what he had claimed to be most anxious to avoid,
and would in fact avoid, the moment he found it, for if he had come
upon the little 'group,' he would have hastened away at once with
studied indifference, satisfied that he had seen Odette and she
him, especially that she had seen him when he was not, apparently,
thinking about her. But no; she would guess at once that it was for
her sake that he had come there. And when M. de Forestelle came to
fetch him, and it was time to start, he excused himself: ""No, I'm
afraid not; I can't go to Pierrefonds to-day. You see, Odette is
there."" And Swann was happy in spite of everything in feeling that
if he, alone among mortals, had not the right to go to Pierrefonds
that day, it was because he was in fact, for Odette, some one who
differed from all other mortals, her lover; and because that
restriction which for him alone was set upon the universal right to
travel freely where one would, was but one of the many forms of
that slavery, that love which was so dear to him. Decidedly, it was
better not to risk a quarrel with her, to be patient, to wait for
her return. He spent his days in poring over a map of the forest of
Compiègne, as though it had been that of the 'Pays du Tendre'; he
surrounded himself with photographs of the Château of Pierrefonds.
When the day dawned on which it was possible that she might return,
he opened the time-table again, calculated what train she must have
taken, and, should she have postponed her departure, what trains
were still left for her to take. He did not leave the house, for
fear of missing a telegram, he did not go to bed, in case, having
come by the last train, she decided to surprise him with a midnight
visit. Yes! The front-door bell rang. There seemed some delay in
opening the door, he wanted to awaken the porter, he leaned out of
the window to shout to Odette, if it was Odette, for in spite of
the orders which he had gone downstairs a dozen times to deliver in
person, they were quite capable of telling her that he was not at
home. It was only a servant coming in. He noticed the incessant
rumble of passing carriages, to which he had never before paid any
attention. He could hear them, one after another, a long way off,
coming nearer, passing his door without stopping, and bearing away
into the distance a message which was not for him. He waited all
night, to no purpose, for the Verdurins had returned unexpectedly,
and Odette had been in Paris since midday; it had not occurred to
her to tell him; not knowing what to do with herself she had spent
the evening alone at a theatre, had long since gone home to bed,
and was peacefully asleep."|"Swann's Way"|"Marcel Proust"

restriction which for him alone was set upon the universal right to
travel freely where one would, was but one of the many forms of
that slavery, that love which was so dear to him. Decidedly, it was
better not to risk a quarrel with her, to be patient, to wait for
her return. He spent his days in poring over a map of the forest of
Compiègne, as though it had been that of the 'Pays du Tendre'; he
surrounded himself with photographs of the Château of Pierrefonds.
When the day dawned on which it was possible that she might return,
he opened the time-table again, calculated what train she must have
taken, and, should she have postponed her departure, what trains
were still left for her to take. He did not leave the house, for
fear of missing a telegram, he did not go to bed, in case, having
come by the last train, she decided to surprise him with a midnight
visit. Yes! The front-door bell rang. There seemed some delay in
opening the door, he wanted to awaken the porter, he leaned out of
the window to shout to Odette, if it was Odette, for in spite of
the orders which he had gone downstairs a dozen times to deliver in
person, they were quite capable of telling her that he was not at
home. It was only a servant coming in. He noticed the incessant
rumble of passing carriages, to which he had never before paid any
attention. He could hear them, one after another, a long way off,
coming nearer, passing his door without stopping, and bearing away
into the distance a message which was not for him. He waited all
night, to no purpose, for the Verdurins had returned unexpectedly,
and Odette had been in Paris since midday; it had not occurred to
her to tell him; not knowing what to do with herself she had spent
the evening alone at a theatre, had long since gone home to bed,
and was peacefully asleep."|"Swann's Way"|"Marcel Proust"
00:00|midnight|"""You can't conceive how glad I should be of your company. But
the greatest pleasure that you can give me will be if you will go
instead to see Odette. You know what a splendid influence you have
over her. I don't suppose she'll be going anywhere this evening,
unless she goes to see her old dressmaker, and I'm sure she would
be delighted if you went with her there. In any case, you'll find
her at home before then. Try to keep her amused, and also to give
her a little sound advice. If you could arrange something for
to-morrow which would please her, something that we could all three
do together. Try to put out a feeler, too, for the summer; see if
there's anything she wants to do, a cruise that we might all three
take; anything you can think of. I don't count upon seeing her
to-night, myself; still if she would like me to come, or if you
find a loophole, you've only to send me a line at Mme. de
Saint-Euverte's up till midnight; after that I shall be here. Ever
so many thanks for all you are doing for me—you know what I feel
about you!"""|"Swann's Way"|"Marcel Proust"

"ap 01:22"|"one twenty-two"|"I should have liked to take, the very next day, the good, the
generous train at one twenty-two, of which never without a
palpitating heart could I read, in the railway company's bills or
in advertisements of circular tours, the hour of departure: it
seemed to me to cut, at a precise point in every afternoon, a most
fascinating groove, a mysterious mark, from which the diverted
hours still led one on, of course, towards evening, towards
to-morrow morning, but to an evening and morning which one would
behold, not in Paris but in one of those towns through which the
train passed and among which it allowed one to choose; for it
stopped at Bayeux, at Coutances, at Vitré, at Questambert, at
Pontorson, at Balbec, at Lannion, at Lamballe, at Benodet, at
Pont-Aven, at Quimperle, and progressed magnificently surcharged
with names which it offered me, so that, among them all, I did not
know which to choose, so impossible was it to sacrifice any. But
even without waiting for the train next day, I could, by rising and
dressing myself with all speed, leave Paris that very evening,
should my parents permit, and arrive at Balbec as dawn spread
westward over the raging sea, from whose driven foam I would seek
shelter in that church in the Persian manner. But at the approach
of the Easter holidays, when my parents bad promised to let me
spend them, for once, in the North of Italy, lo! in place of those
dreams of tempests, by which I had been entirely possessed, not
wishing to see anything but waves dashing in from all sides,
mounting always higher, upon the wildest of coasts, beside churches
as rugged and precipitous as cliffs, in whose towers the sea-birds
would be wailing; suddenly, effacing them, taking away all their
charm, excluding them because they were its opposite and could only
have weakened its effect, was substituted in me the converse dream
of the most variegated of springs, not the spring of Combray, still
pricking with all the needle-points of the winter's frost, but that
which already covered with lilies and anemones the meadows of
Fiesole, and gave Florence a dazzling golden background, like those
in Fra Angelico's pictures. From that moment, only sunlight,
perfumes, colours, seemed to me to have any value; for this
alternation of images had effected a change of front in my desire,
and—as abrupt as those that occur sometimes in music,—a complete
change of tone in my sensibility. Thus it came about that a mere
atmospheric variation would be sufficient to provoke in me that
modulation, without there being any need for me to await the return
of a season. For often we find a day, in one, that has strayed from
another season, and makes us live in that other, summons at once
into our presence and makes us long for its peculiar pleasures, and
interrupts the dreams that we were in process of weaving, by
inserting, out of its turn, too early or too late, this leaf, torn
from another chapter, in the interpolated calendar of Happiness.
But soon it happened that, like those natural phenomena from which
our comfort or our health can derive but an accidental and all too
modest benefit, until the day when science takes control of them,
and, producing them at will, places in our hands the power to order
their appearance, withdrawn from the tutelage and independent of
the consent of chance; similarly the production of these dreams of
the Atlantic and of Italy ceased to depend entirely upon the
changes of the seasons and of the weather. I need only, to make
them reappear, pronounce the names: Balbec, Venice, Florence,
within whose syllables had gradually accumulated all the longing
inspired in me by the places for which they stood. Even in spring,
to come in a book upon the name of Balbec sufficed to awaken in me
the desire for storms at sea and for the Norman gothic; even on a
stormy day the name of Florence or of Venice would awaken the
desire for sunshine, for lilies, for the Palace of the Doges and
for Santa Maria del Fiore."|"Swann's Way"|"Marcel Proust"
"ap 01:22"|"one twenty-two"|"Had my health definitely improved, had my parents allowed me, if
not actually to go down to stay at Balbec, at least to take, just
once, so as to become acquainted with the architecture and
landscapes of Normandy or of Brittany, that one twenty-two train
into which I had so often clambered in imagination, I should have
preferred to stop, and to alight from it, at the most beautiful of
its towns; but in vain might I compare and contrast them; how was
one to choose, any more than between individual people, who are not
interchangeable, between Bayeux, so lofty in its noble coronet of
rusty lace, whose highest point caught the light of the old gold of
its second syllable; Vitré, whose acute accent barred its ancient
glass with wooden lozenges; gentle Lamballe, whose whiteness ranged
from egg-shell yellow to a pearly grey; Coutances, a Norman
Cathedral, which its final consonants, rich and yellowing, crowned
with a tower of butter; Lannion with the rumble and buzz, in the
silence of its village street, of the fly on the wheel of the
coach; Questambert, Pontorson, ridiculously silly and simple, white
feathers and yellow beaks strewn along the road to those
well-watered and poetic spots; Benodet, a name scarcely moored that
seemed to be striving to draw the river down into the tangle of its
seaweeds; Pont-Aven, the snowy, rosy flight of the wing of a
lightly poised coif, tremulously reflected in the greenish waters
of a canal; Quimperlé, more firmly attached, this, and since the
Middle Ages, among the rivulets with which it babbled, threading
their pearls upon a grey background, like the pattern made, through
the cobwebs upon a window, by rays of sunlight changed into blunt
points of tarnished silver?"|"Swann's Way"|"Marcel Proust"

troubled me also by seeming not to be pleased to see me, and this
happened often on the very days on which I had most counted for the
realisation of my hopes. I was sure that Gilberte was coming to the
Champs-Elysées, and I felt an elation which seemed merely the
anticipation of a great happiness when—going into the drawing-room
in the morning to kiss Mamma, who was already dressed to go out,
the coils of her black hair elaborately built up, and her beautiful
hands, plump and white, fragrant still with soap—I had been
apprised, by seeing a column of dust standing by itself in the air
above the piano, and by hearing a barrel-organ playing, beneath the

received, until nightfall, an unexpected, radiant visit from a day
of spring. While we sat at luncheon, by opening her window, the
lady opposite had sent packing, in the twinkling of an eye, from
beside my chair—to sweep in a single stride over the whole width of
our dining-room—a sunbeam which had lain down there for its midday
rest and returned to continue it there a moment later. At school,
during the one o'clock lesson, the sun made me sick with impatience
and boredom as it let fall a golden stream that crept to the edge
of my desk, like an invitation to the feast at which I could not
myself arrive before three o'clock, until the moment when Françoise
came to fetch me at the school-gate, and we made our way towards
the Champs-Elysées through streets decorated with sunlight, dense
with people, over which the balconies, detached by the sun and made
vaporous, seemed to float in front of the houses like clouds of

yet arrived. Motionless, on the lawn nurtured by the invisible sun
which, here and there, kindled to a flame the point of a blade of
grass, while the pigeons that had alighted upon it had the
appearance of ancient sculptures which the gardener's pick had
heaved to the surface of a hallowed soil, I stood with my eyes
fixed on the horizon, expecting at every moment to see appear the

that seemed to be holding out the child, which it had in its arms,
and which glistened in the stream of light, to receive benediction
from the sun. The old lady who read the Débats was sitting on her

exclaimed ""What a lovely day!"" And when the chair-woman came up to

it, she performed a circular movement with her neck, straightened
her boa, and fastened upon the collector, as she shewed her the end

having taken advantage of the fine weather to go on some errand of
her own; and M. Swann was coming to fetch his daughter. And so it
was my fault; I ought not to have strayed from the lawn; for one
never knew for certain from what direction Gilberte would appear,
whether she would be early or late, and this perpetual tension
succeeded in making more impressive not only the Champs-Elysées in
their entirety, and the whole span of the afternoon, like a vast
expanse of space and time, on every point and at every moment of
which it was possible that the form of Gilberte might appear, but
also that form itself, since behind its appearance I felt that
there lay concealed the reason for which it had shot its arrow into
my heart at four o'clock instead of at half-past two; crowned with
a smart hat, for paying calls, instead of the plain cap, for games;
in front of the Ambassadeurs and not between the two puppet-shows;
I divined one of those occupations in which I might not follow
Gilberte, occupations that forced her to go out or to stay at home,
I was in contact with the mystery of her unknown life. It was this
mystery, too, which troubled me when, running at the sharp-voiced
girl's bidding, so as to begin our game without more delay, I saw
Gilberte, so quick and informal with us, make a ceremonious bow to
the old lady with the Débats (who acknowledged it with ""What

her with a shy smile, with an air of constraint which called to my

no one gave me so strong an impression as did M. Swann, who came a

her games, her friendships depended upon them—contained for me,

subjects that had an all-powerful control over her in whom it must
have had its source, an undefined, an inaccessible quality of
melancholy charm. Everything that concerned them was on my part the
object of so constant a preoccupation that the days on which, as on

having aroused my curiosity, when he was still on good terms with
my parents) came for Gilberte to the Champs-Elysées, once the
pulsations to which my heart had been excited by the appearance of
his grey hat and hooded cape had subsided, the sight of him still
impressed me as might that of an historic personage, upon whom one
had just been studying a series of books, and the smallest details
of whose life one learned with enthusiasm. His relations with the
Comte de Paris, which, when I heard them discussed at Combray,
seemed to me unimportant, became now in my eyes something
marvellous, as if no one else had ever known the House of Orleans;
they set him in vivid detachment against the vulgar background of
pedestrians of different classes, who encumbered that particular
path in the Champs-Elysées, in the midst of whom I admired his

coming to the Champs-Elysées, I would try to arrange my walks so
that I should be brought into some kind of contact with her.
Sometimes I would lead Françoise on a pilgrimage to the house in
which the Swanns lived, making her repeat to me unendingly all that
she had learned from the governess with regard to Mme. Swann. ""It
seems, she puts great faith in medals. She would never think of
starting on a journey if she had heard an owl hoot, or the
death-watch in the wall, or if she had seen a cat at midnight, or
if the furniture had creaked. Oh yes! she's a most religious lady,
she is!"" I was so madly in love with Gilberte that if, on our way,
I caught sight of their old butler taking the dog out, my emotion
would bring me to a standstill, I would fasten on his white
whiskers eyes that melted with passion. And Françoise would rouse
me with: ""What's wrong with you now, child?"" and we would continue
on our way until we reached their gate, where a porter, different
from every other porter in the world, and saturated, even to the
braid on his livery, with the same melancholy charm that I had felt
to be latent in the name of Gilberte, looked at me as though he
knew that I was one of those whose natural unworthiness would for
ever prevent them from penetrating into the mysteries of the life
inside, which it was his duty to guard, and over which the
ground-floor windows appeared conscious of being protectingly
closed, with far less resemblance, between the nobly sweeping
arches of their muslin curtains, to any other windows in the world
than to Gilberte's glancing eyes. On other days we would go along
the boulevards, and I would post myself at the corner of the Rue
Duphot; I had heard that Swann was often to be seen passing there,
on his way to the dentist's; and my imagination so far
differentiated Gilberte's father from the rest of humanity, his
presence in the midst of a crowd of real people introduced among
them so miraculous an element, that even before we reached the
Madeleine I would be trembling with emotion at the thought that I
was approaching a street from which that supernatural apparition
might at any moment burst upon me unawares."|"Swann's Way"|"Marcel Proust"
"ap 01:00"|one|"Farther off, at a place where the trees were still all green,
one alone, small, stunted, lopped, but stubborn in its resistance,
was tossing in the breeze an ugly mane of red. Elsewhere, again,
might be seen the first awakening of this Maytime of the leaves,
and those of an ampelopsis, a smiling miracle, like a red hawthorn
flowering in winter, had that very morning all 'come out,' so to
speak, in blossom. And the Bois had the temporary, unfinished,
artificial look of a nursery garden or a park in which, either for
some botanic purpose or in preparation for a festival, there have
been embedded among the trees of commoner growth, which have not
yet been uprooted and transplanted elsewhere, a few rare specimens,
with fantastic foliage, which seem to be clearing all round
themselves an empty space, making room, giving air, diffusing
light. Thus it was the time of year at which the Bois de Boulogne
displays more separate characteristics, assembles more distinct
elements in a composite whole than at any other. It was also the
time of day. In places where the trees still kept their leaves,
they seemed to have undergone an alteration of their substance from
the point at which they were touched by the sun's light, still, at
this hour in the morning, almost horizontal, as it would be again,
a few hours later, at the moment when, just as dusk began, it would
flame up like a lamp, project afar over the leaves a warm and
artificial glow, and set ablaze the few topmost boughs of a tree
that would itself remain unchanged, a sombre incombustible
candelabrum beneath its flaming crest. At one spot the light grew
solid as a brick wall, and like a piece of yellow Persian masonry,
patterned in blue, daubed coarsely upon the sky the leaves of the
chestnuts; at another, it cut them off from the sky towards which
they stretched out their curling, golden fingers. Half-way up the
trunk of a tree draped with wild vine, the light had grafted and
brought to blossom, too dazzling to be clearly distinguished, an
enormous posy, of red flowers apparently, perhaps of a new variety
of carnation. The different parts of the Bois, so easily confounded
in summer in the density and monotony of their universal green,
were now clearly divided. A patch of brightness indicated the
approach to almost every one of them, or else a splendid mass of
foliage stood out before it like an oriflamme. I could make out, as
on a coloured map, Armenonville, the Pré Catalan, Madrid, the Race
Course and the shore of the lake. Here and there would appear some
meaningless erection, a sham grotto, a mill, for which the trees
made room by drawing away from it, or which was borne upon the soft
green platform of a grassy lawn. I could feel that the Bois was not
really a wood, that it existed for a purpose alien to the life of
its trees; my sense of exaltation was due not only to admiration of
the autumn tints but to a bodily desire. Ample source of a joy
which the heart feels at first without being conscious of its
cause, without understanding that it results from no external
impulse! Thus I gazed at the trees with an unsatisfied longing
which went beyond them and, without my knowledge, directed itself
towards that masterpiece of beautiful strolling women which the
trees enframed for a few hours every day. I walked towards the
Allée des Acacias. I passed through forest groves in which the
morning light, breaking them into new sections, lopped and trimmed
the trees, united different trunks in marriage, made nosegays of
their branches. It would skilfully draw towards it a pair of trees;
making deft use of the sharp chisel of light and shade, it would
cut away from each of them half of its trunk and branches, and,
weaving together the two halves that remained, would make of them
either a single pillar of shade, defined by the surrounding light,
or a single luminous phantom whose artificial, quivering contour
was encompassed in a network of inky shadows. When a ray of
sunshine gilded the highest branches, they seemed, soaked and still
dripping with a sparkling moisture, to have emerged alone from the
liquid, emerald-green atmosphere in which the whole grove was
plunged as though beneath the sea. For the trees continued to live
by their own vitality, and when they had no longer any leaves, that
vitality gleamed more brightly still from the nap of green velvet
that carpeted their trunks, or in the white enamel of the globes of
mistletoe that were scattered all the way up to the topmost
branches of the poplars, rounded as are the sun and moon in
Michelangelo's 'Creation.' But, forced for so many years now, by a
sort of grafting process, to share the life of feminine humanity,
they called to my mind the figure of the dryad, the fair worldling,
swiftly walking, brightly coloured, whom they sheltered with their
branches as she passed beneath them, and obliged to acknowledge, as
they themselves acknowledged, the power of the season; they
recalled to me the happy days when I was young and had faith, when
I would hasten eagerly to the spots where masterpieces of female
elegance would be incarnate for a few moments beneath the
unconscious, accommodating boughs. But the beauty for which the
firs and acacias of the Bois de Boulogne made me long, more
disquieting in that respect than the chestnuts and lilacs of
Trianon which I was going to see, was not fixed somewhere outside
myself in the relics of an historical period, in works of art, in a
little temple of love at whose door was piled an oblation of autumn
leaves ribbed with gold. I reached the shore of the lake; I walked
on as far as the pigeon-shooting ground. The idea of perfection
which I had within me I had bestowed, in that other time, upon the
height of a victoria, upon the raking thinness of those horses,
frenzied and light as wasps upon the wing, with bloodshot eyes like
the cruel steeds of Diomed, which now, smitten by a desire to sea
again what I had once loved, as ardent as the desire that had
driven me, many years before, along the same paths, I wished to see
renewed before my eyes at the moment when Mme. Swann's enormous
coachman, supervised by a groom no bigger than his fist, and as
infantile as Saint George in the picture, endeavoured to curb the
ardour of the flying, steel-tipped pinions with which they
thundered along the ground. Alas! there was nothing now but
motor-cars driven each by a moustached mechanic, with a tall
footman towering by his side. I wished to hold before my bodily
eyes, that I might know whether they were indeed as charming as
they appeared to the eyes of memory, little hats, so low-crowned as
to seem no more than garlands about the brows of women. All the
hats now were immense; covered with fruits and flowers and all
manner of birds. In place of the lovely gowns in which Mme. Swann
walked like a Queen, appeared Greco-Saxon tunics, with Tanagra
folds, or sometimes, in the Directoire style, 'Liberty chiffons'
sprinkled with flowers like sheets of wallpaper. On the heads of
the gentlemen who might have been eligible to stroll with Mme.
Swann in the Allée de la Reine Marguerite, I found not the grey
'tile' hats of old, nor any other kind. They walked the Bois
bare-headed. And seeing all these new elements of the spectacle, I
had no longer the faith which, applied to them, would have given
them consistency, unity, life; they passed in a scattered sequence
before me, at random, without reality, containing in themselves no
beauty that my eyes might have endeavoured as in the old days, to
extract from them and to compose in a picture. They were just
women, in whose elegance I had no belief, and whose clothes seemed
to me unimportant. But when a belief vanishes, there survives
it—more and more ardently, so as to cloak the absence of the power,
now lost to us, of imparting reality to new phenomena—an idolatrous
attachment to the old things which our belief in them did once
animate, as if it was in that belief and not in ourselves that the
divine spark resided, and as if our present incredulity had a
contingent cause—the death of the gods."|"Swann's Way"|"Marcel Proust"
