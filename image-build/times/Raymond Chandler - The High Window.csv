"ap 03:00"|three|"After the bell had rung three times at the other end of the line a light childish sort of girl’s voice filtered itself through a hank of gum and said: “Good morning. Mr. Morningstar’s office.”"|"The High Window"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"“Ah,” he said. “Ah.” There was a silence. Then, “At three o’clock,” he said, not sharp, but quick. “I shall be glad to see you here in my office. You probably know where it is. Will that suit you?”"|"The High Window"|"Raymond Chandler"
12:00|"high noon"|"“Runs a plushy night club and gambling joint in Idle Valley, about two miles off the highway back towards the hills. Used to be in pictures. Lousy actor. Seems to have plenty of protection. I never heard of him shooting anybody on the public square at high noon. Or at any other time for that matter. But I wouldn’t like to bet on it.”"|"The High Window"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"I went into the office, looked on the floor for mail, didn’t find any, bought myself a short drink out of the office bottle and left. I didn’t have any time to spare to get downtown before three o’clock."|"The High Window"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap ~ 04:30"|"About four-thirty"|"“About four-thirty, the way it looks now. You sure you want to give me this key?”"|"The High Window"|"Raymond Chandler"
11:00|"eleven in the morning"|"“It is not in my office,” he said. “Do you take me for a fool?” He reached an ancient silver watch out of his vest on a black fob. He screwed up his eyes to look at it. “Let us say eleven in the morning,” he said. “Come back with your money. The coin may or may not be here, but if I am satisfied with your behavior, I will arrange matters.”"|"The High Window"|"Raymond Chandler"
11:00|"eleven A.M."|"“At eleven A.M.,” he said. “And no tricks, Mr. Marlowe. Don’t think I don’t know how to protect myself.”"|"The High Window"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 03:50"|three-fifty|"I breathed hard and tight going down the hall, listening to myself. I pushed the elevator button. Then I got out the card which Mr. George Anson Phillips had given me in the lobby of the Hotel Metropole. I didn’t look at it in any real sense. I didn’t have to look at it to recall that it referred to Apartment 204, Florence Apartments, 128 Court Street. I just stood there flicking it with a fingernail while the old elevator came heaving up in the shaft, straining like a gravel truck on a hairpin turn.
The time was three-fifty.

"ap 03:00"|three|"“Goes on at three,” Hench said. “Three to say four-thirty, or sometimes later. We went out about the last half the third. We was gone about an inning and a half, maybe two. Twenty minutes to half an hour. Not more.”"|"The High Window"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 04:30"|four-thirty|"“Goes on at three,” Hench said. “Three to say four-thirty, or sometimes later. We went out about the last half the third. We was gone about an inning and a half, maybe two. Twenty minutes to half an hour. Not more.”"|"The High Window"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 06:45"|"quarter to seven"|"It was a quarter to seven when I let myself into the office and clicked the light on and picked a piece of paper off the floor. It was a notice from the Green Feather Messenger Service saying that a package was held awaiting my call and would be delivered upon request at any hour of the day or night. I put it on the desk, peeled my coat off and opened the windows. I got a half bottle of Old Taylor out of the deep drawer of the desk and drank a short drink, rolling it around on my tongue. Then I sat there holding the neck of the cool bottle and wondering how it would feel to be a homicide dick and find bodies lying around and not mind at all, not have to sneak out wiping doorknobs, not have to ponder how much I could tell without hurting a client and how little I could tell without too badly hurting myself. I decided I wouldn’t like it."|"The High Window"|"Raymond Chandler"
22:00|"ten o’clock in the evening"|"The chessmen, red and white bone, were lined up ready to go and had that sharp, competent and complicated look they always have at the beginning of a game. It was ten o’clock in the evening, I was home at the apartment, I had a pipe in my mouth, a drink at my elbow and nothing on my mind except two murders and the mystery of how Mrs. Elizabeth Bright Murdock had got her Brasher Doubloon back while I still had it in my pocket."|"The High Window"|"Raymond Chandler"
12:00|noon|"“Let me help you out. I give you till tomorrow noon, a little better than twelve hours. I won’t get my post mortem report before that anyway. I give you till then to talk things over with your party and decide to come clean.”"|"The High Window"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap < 11:30"|"near eleven-thirty"|"It was near eleven-thirty when I backed my car out of the garage and drove towards Cahuenga Pass."|"The High Window"|"Raymond Chandler"
12:00|noon|"“I told them as little as I could. This man Phillips asked me to come and see him. He implied he was too deep in a job he didn’t like and needed help. When I got there he was dead. I told the police that. They didn’t think it was quite the whole story. It probably isn’t. I have until tomorrow noon to fill it out. So I’m trying to fill it out.”"|"The High Window"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"It was two o’clock when I got back to Hollywood and put the car away and went upstairs to my apartment. The wind was ail gone but the air still had that dryness and lightness of the desert. The air in the apartment was dead and Breeze’s cigar butt had made it a little worse than dead. I opened windows and flushed the place through while I undressed and stripped the pockets of my suit."|"The High Window"|"Raymond Chandler"
12:00|noon|"I took a deep breath. “I’m connected with one murder already, by having found the body and reported it. I may presently be connected with another, by having found the body and not reported it. Which is much more serious for me. Even as far as it goes, I have until noon today to disclose the name of my client.”"|"The High Window"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 06:00"|six|"The elevator lurched into motion and pounded its way upstairs. It stopped at six, I got out, and the old man leaned out of the car to spit and said in a dull voice:"|"The High Window"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 06:00"|six|"“You rode up to eight,” he said. “Twice. Second time was late. You got back on at six. Shortly after that the boys in blue came bustlin’ in.”"|"The High Window"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap ~ 05:30"|"about five-thirty"|"“Let’s see,” I said. “Half an hour to drive here anyway. You’ve been here close to an hour. That would be about five-thirty when you left Mr. Vannier’s house. And you put the light off.”"|"The High Window"|"Raymond Chandler"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"She looked doubtful. “I think she’s gone to bed,” she said. “I don’t think you can see her.”
“It’s only nine o’clock.”
“Mrs. Murdock goes to bed early.” She started to close the door."|"The High Window"|"Raymond Chandler"
15:00|"three o’clock in the afternoon"|"It was three o’clock in the afternoon and there were five pieces of luggage inside the apartment door, side by side on the carpet. There was my yellow cowhide, well scraped on both sides from being pushed around in the boots of cars. There were two nice pieces of airplane luggage both marked L.M. There was an old black imitation walrus thing marked M.D. and there was one of these little leatherette overnight cases which you can buy in drugstores for a dollar forty-nine."|"The High Window"|"Raymond Chandler"
