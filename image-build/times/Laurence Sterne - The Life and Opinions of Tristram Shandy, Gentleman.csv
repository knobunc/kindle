But it was not until 1759 – immediately following the suppression of The Good Warm Watch-Coat, which had offended local susceptibilities – that he began The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman. His marriage was crumbling, and his wife was temporarily insane. It was against this grim background that he flung himself into a work of exuberant humour. After six weeks he had reached Chapter XVIII; after six months, the first two volumes were completed. His offer to the publisher Dodsley was at first rejected. But a small edition was put out, and Sterne found himself famous. Acclaimed by men as different as David Garrick and Bishop Warburton, Sterne had hospitality and flattery lavished on him. He was commissioned to supply fresh volumes. He was invited to Windsor. His portrait was painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds. ‘I wrote, not to be fed but to be famous,’ he said."|"The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman"|"Laurence Sterne"
00:00|Midnight|"More recently, Salman Rushdie in Midnight’s Children, Juan Goytisolo in Juan the Landless and Carlos Fuentes in Christopher Unborn have all written major fictions of national identity, the roots of which are buried in Tristram Shandy. No other eighteenth-century fiction can claim so specific, so glorious, a progeny. But even when one can agree that these authors were all influenced by Sterne, one can also dispute, as I have been doing, the notion that Sterne’s achievement was to herald our secular, existential, autonomous world, or to ‘create’ a new shape to the ‘novel’. What, alternatively, might be Sterne’s purchase on modernity?"|"The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman"|"Laurence Sterne"

NICODEMUS’D: Sterne may have been looking at a note to a passage in Rabelais’s ‘Author’s Prologue’ (Volume I) while writing this section: ‘Certain proper names have particular ideas affix’d to them for ridiculous reasons. For instance … Nicodemus is a foolish fellow or ninny-hammer, from Nigaut and Nice…’ Sterne might also be referring to the Pharisee Nicodemus, whose actions in John 3:1–13 and 7:45–53 led to connotations of faintheartedness and weakness."|"The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman"|"Laurence Sterne"
"ap 05:16"|5.16|"6. Gentle critick … space: Sterne continues to borrow from Locke’s Essay: ‘When it is considered, what a pudder is made about Essences, and how much all sorts of Knowledge, Discourse, and Conversation, are pester’d and disorder’d by the careless, and confused Use and Application of Words, it will, perhaps, be thought worth while th[o]roughly to lay [the subject] open’ (III.5.16; see also III.3.9 and III.10.2).

And cf. A Tale of a Tub, sect. IX, the discussion about vapours and the brain.

"ap 10:34"|10.34|"5. wit and judgment: Sterne’s refusal to separate the two is reminiscent of Pope’s similar refusal in his Essay on Criticism, lines 82–3: ‘For Wit and Judgment often are at strife, / Tho’ meant each other’s Aid, like Man and Wife.’ The opposite view was embraced by both Hobbes and Locke; see Leviathan, ch. 8, and Essay, II.11.2 and III.10.34. In so far as Sterne’s critics were accusing him of having too much wit, too little judgement, the ‘Author’s Preface’ is a retort to them, rather than a serious engagement with Locke."|"The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman"|"Laurence Sterne"

Locke … juxta-position: Sterne paraphrases Locke, Essay, IV.17.18: ‘the principal Act of Ratiocination is the finding the Agreement, or Disagreement of two Ideas one with another, by the intervention of a third. As a Man, by a Yard, finds two Houses to be of the same length, which could not be brought together to measure their Equality by juxta-position.’ Sterne’s alterations set up several bawdy possibilities.

It is therefore out of pure malice, that Florimond de Remond places his birth on the twenty second of October. He thought thereby to confirm the astrological predictions of Junctinus … This Astrologer was strongly confuted by a professor of Strasburg, who shewed, that, by the rules of Astrology, Luther was to be a great man."|"The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman"|"Laurence Sterne"

The meanest, and most obvious Things that come in our way, have dark sides, that the quickest Sight cannot penetrate into.

To be ‘piqued’ is to have one’s opponent win on cards and play before you begin to score; to be ‘repiqued’ is to have the opponent win on cards alone (hence, one cannot be piqued and repiqued in the same game). To be ‘capotted’ is to have one’s opponent win everything."|"The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman"|"Laurence Sterne"
