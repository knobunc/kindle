17:00|"five o’clock in the afternoon"|"It was five o’clock in the afternoon, and Peter Kushnir was in his backyard striving for numbness, taking generous swigs from what was now his third glass of whisky. But it wasn’t working. Instead, with each coating of warmth that drained down his gullet, he felt his despair mount. Within hours, he was sure of it, a nuclear holocaust would sweep the globe as bare as a slate, and he couldn’t do anything—no one could do anything—to stop it."|"Believing Cedric"|"Mark Lavorato"
19:29|1929|"On the way back to the house, he talked about having another baby, a boy, a brother who would be able to look after his sister. But a year later, following the crash of Black Tuesday in 1929, they had Marianne instead. Then, after a long debate over the prospect of another mouth to feed, they tried yet again, and in 1931, had Susan."|"Believing Cedric"|"Mark Lavorato"
"< 12:00"|"Just before noon"|"It was a sentiment Brandy didn’t feel particularly confident about at the moment. Even if, that morning, she and Hilda had woken up safe and stable in their grounded, regular lives, at their grandmother’s house on the reserve. Just before noon, their grandmother had asked them to walk to a neighbours’ place to check on things, as the neighbours had gone to the States for a few weeks. The girls reasoned that, seeing as it was only another mile farther on, they would pay another neighbour a visit as well, while they were out. Which meant they wouldn’t be expected back until later in the evening."|"Believing Cedric"|"Mark Lavorato"
"ap 03:00"|3:00|"I’ve never written a letter like this before either. (I don’t think I’ve ever written a letter.) So please. I just want to talk. Please. At Remy’s, 3:00, Sunday. Meet me there?"|"Believing Cedric"|"Mark Lavorato"
"ap 03:00"|three|"To start with, she hated parents, how mothers were, at first, only capable of talking in numbers: “I was in labour for eighteen hours,” “he was seven pounds, three ounces,” “she drinks 120 cc now,” “he wakes up at three and then again at seven,” “he knows four words so far,” “grade one,” “top two readers in the class,” “95 per cent.” And she hated how fathers were always on the sidelines, boasting in what was deemed to be a more objective manner, injecting words like “gifted,” “advanced,” and “precocious.” Emily sometimes wanted to see a bar graph comparing “presumed future prodigies” to “actual prodigies that had surfaced from said presumptions.” She was confident there was a considerable disparity between the two."|"Believing Cedric"|"Mark Lavorato"

00:00|midnight|"And it wasn’t as if it was making her rich—by any stretch of the imagination. If she were rich, she wouldn’t have to watch her money like this in the first place; in fact, if she were rich, she would lower the rent, practically give the apartments away to people. And, let’s see, what else: she’d have a garden, a nice one, something bigger than the meagre backyard plot they had now, big enough that she could invite people over for the Feast of Dormition in August, with a firepit where Yannis could set up a spit and knock down the cinders, stirring the coals until they were the perfect temperature to roast a lamb. And if not a garden, then maybe a holiday, back in Greece. They could visit her parents, spend Easter there, in the way that Easter should be spent: go to the vigil in church on Pascha Saturday, watch the lighting of the Holy Fire at midnight. That’s what she would do. And while she was there, she’d be sure to go to the beach near Kalamata where the shore slopes into the Mediterranean, and she’d swim in that sea that she remembers so well, in the water she can picture even now, water that was always calm and blue and clean. That’s exactly what she’d do if she ever made enough money. She’d spend it. Because she would be free to. Free to do whatever she wanted."|"Believing Cedric"|"Mark Lavorato"
21:00|"nine that night"|"Brice then explained his predicament. He wasn’t from around there, was just passing through in fact, had heard Kipp’s name from a few different people, and needed to buy some guns. He also needed to unload a bulk of crack he’d fortuitously come into. And fast, before he started crossing borders. When he said the weight and price—no haggling tolerated—Steven could barely believe his ears, trying to shift coolly, still standing around in his underwear. Okay. Deal. Brice wrote an address on a ripped corner of a flyer and told him to be there at nine that night, sharp. He bought three handguns from Kipp and, before closing the door, addressed Steven once more, leaning on the doorknob in his stylish clothes, his shirt a faded pink, hair feathered, a sapphire-coloured stud in one of his earlobes: “See ya t’night then.”"|"Believing Cedric"|"Mark Lavorato"
18:00|"6:00 PM"|"Nathan walked into another room, where he found mostly girls of his grade, along with a handful of the punks and “radicals” of the school, people who called themselves anarchists, eschewing the nutritious dinners their upper-middle-class parents placed in front of them at 6:00 PM, kids who left the table to spend the rest of their evening holed up inside their pastel-painted bedrooms, listening to Sonic Youth and tack-holing the walls with posters of Engels, Marx, and propaganda from the Libertarian Communist Committee of the Spanish Civil War. One of them, Chris, walked over and tried to greet Nathan with a fancy handshake: a series of grips, different fingers interlocking at different angles, fists connecting, one on top of the other, then frontal, palms sliding, slapping, perhaps some snapping added in for flare. It was a handshake that Nathan completely botched."|"Believing Cedric"|"Mark Lavorato"
16:43|"4:43 PM"|"“Right,” Hanif agreed, then leaned over Cedric to do one last test for pupil restriction. Without seeing an inkling of a reaction, he straightened up, comparing his watch with the clock on the wall. Janet, pen poised above the corresponding box on the chart, scribbled the numbers down as he said them. “4:43 PM.”"|"Believing Cedric"|"Mark Lavorato"
