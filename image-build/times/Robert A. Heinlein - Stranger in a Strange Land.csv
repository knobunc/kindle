15:47|"3:47 that afternoon"|"She had not thought seriously about it at the time, as she had not really believed that anything could happen to Ben. Now she thought about it for a long time, while trying to continue her duties. There comes a time in the life of every human when he or she must decide to risk “his life, his fortune, and his sacred honor” on an outcome dubious. Those who fail the challenge are merely overgrown children, can never be anything else. Jill Boardman encountered her personal challenge—and accepted it—at 3:47 that afternoon while convincing a ward visitor that he simply could not bring a dog onto the floor even though he had managed to slip it past the receptionist and even if the sight of this dog was just what the patient needed."|"Stranger in a Strange Land"|"Robert A.

"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"Jill slept until shortly before dinner, which in that household was a comfortable eight o’clock. She awoke refreshed and feeling alert, so much so that she sniffed the air incoming from the grille over her head and surmised correctly that the doctor had offset the hypnotic she had been given with a stimulant. While she was asleep someone had removed the dirty and torn street clothes she had been wearing and had left a simple, off-white dinner dress and sandals. The clothes fit her fairly well; Jill concluded that they must belong to the one the doctor had called Miriam. She bathed and painted her face and combed her hair and went down to the big living room feeling like a new woman."|"Stranger in a Strange Land"|"Robert A. Heinlein"

It was transmitted a couple of minutes after it was filed and was received at once, because Ben’s office has its own statprinter. All right, now you tell me why Ben sent a printed message to his own office—during working hours—instead of telephoning?”"|"Stranger in a Strange Land"|"Robert A. Heinlein"

This occurred hours before you pulled your jail break for Mike—about eight hours earlier, as Cavendish sets their arrival in the presence of the phony ‘Man from Mars’ at 9.14 Thursday morning. That is to say, the government still had Mike under their thumb at that moment. In the same building. They could have exhibited him. Yet they took the really grave risk of offering a phony for inspection by the most noted Fair Witness in Washington—in the country. Why?”"|"Stranger in a Strange Land"|"Robert A. Heinlein"

Never mind, back to Ben—Cavendish reports that Ben dropped him and the lawyer, a chap named Frisby, at nine thirty-one, and Ben kept the cab. We don’t know where Ben went then.

He went on briskly, “The Bon Voyage party for the Renwicks will start promptly at midnight and the doors will be locked at that time—so get here early and let’s make this the happiest revelry our flock has ever seen, for we’re all proud of Art and Dottie. Funeral services will be held thirty minutes after dawn, with breakfast immediately following for the benefit of those who have to get to work early.” The Shepherd suddenly looked very stern and the camera panned in until his head filled the tank. “After our last Bon Voyage, the sexton found an empty pint bottle in one of the Happiness rooms . . . of a brand distilled by sinners. That’s past and done, as the brother who slipped has confessed and paid penance sevenfold, even refusing the usual cash discount—I’m sure he won’t backslide. But stop and think, My Children— Is it worth risking eternal happiness to save a few pennies on an article of worldly merchandise? Always look for that happy, holy seal-of-approval with Bishop Digby’s smiling face on it. Don’t let a sinner palm off on you something ‘just as good.’ Our sponsors support us; they deserve your support.

They continued to come in and Jubal concluded that Douglas had never intended to convene this public meeting earlier than eleven o’clock, and that everyone else had been so informed—the earlier hour given Jubal was to permit the private pre-conference conference that Douglas had demanded and that Jubal had refused.

He had two young daughters, virgins—at least, such was his opinion—and he told this crowd of men that he would give them these two little girls and they could use them any way they liked—a gang shagging, a midnight revue, he pleaded with them to do any damn thing they pleased to his daughters . . . only please go ’way and quit beating on his door.”"|"Stranger in a Strange Land"|"Robert A.

And I didn’t realize that Mike didn’t know about swim suits. Oh, he may have seen them . . . but he didn’t know what they were for or had some mixed-up idea. He certainly didn’t know that you were supposed to wear them in the water—the idea was almost sacrilege. And you know Jubal’s rigid rules about keeping his pool clean—I’m sure it’s never seen a suit.
