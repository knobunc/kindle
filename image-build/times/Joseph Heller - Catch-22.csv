03:00|"three o’clock in the morning"|"‘English history!’ roared the silver-maned senior Senator
from his state indignantly. ‘What’s the matter with American history? American
history is as good as any history in the world!’ Major Major switched
immediately to American literature, but not before the F.B.I. had opened a file
on him. There were six people and a Scotch terrier inhabiting the remote
farmhouse Major Major called home, and five of them and the Scotch terrier
turned out to be agents for the F.B.I. Soon they had enough derogatory
information on Major Major to do whatever they wanted to with him. The only
thing they could find to do with him, however, was take him into the Army as a
private and make him a major four days later so that Congressmen with nothing
else on their minds could go trotting back and forth through the streets of
Washington, D.C., chanting, ‘Who promoted Major Major? Who promoted Major
Major?’ Actually, Major Major had been promoted by an I.B.M. machine with a
sense of humor almost as keen as his father’s. When war broke out, he was still
docile and compliant. They told him to enlist, and he enlisted. They told him
to apply for aviation cadet training, and he applied for aviation cadet
training, and the very next night found himself standing barefoot in icy mud at
three o’clock in the morning before a tough and belligerent sergeant from the
Southwest who told them he could beat hell out of any man in his outfit and was
ready to prove it. The recruits in his squadron had all been shaken roughly
awake only minutes before by the sergeant’s corporals and told to assemble in
front of the administration tent. It was still raining on Major Major. They
fell into ranks in the civilian clothes they had brought into the Army with
them three days before. Those who had lingered to put shoes and socks on were
sent back to their cold, wet, dark tents to remove them, and they were all
barefoot in the mud as the sergeant ran his stony eyes over their faces and
told them he could beat hell out of any man in his outfit. No one was inclined
to dispute him."|Catch-22|"Joseph Heller"
03:00|"three o’clock in the morning"|"Major Major’s unexpected promotion to major the next day
plunged the belligerent sergeant into a bottomless gloom, for he was no longer
able to boast that he could beat hell out of any man in his outfit. He brooded
for hours in his tent like Saul, receiving no visitors, while his elite guard
of corporals stood discouraged watch outside. At three o’clock in the morning
he found his solution, and Major Major and the other recruits were again shaken
roughly awake and ordered to assemble barefoot in the drizzly glare at the
administration tent, where the sergeant was already waiting, his fists clenched
on his hips cockily, so eager to speak that he could hardly wait for them to
arrive."|Catch-22|"Joseph Heller"
03:00|"three o’clock in
the morning"|"‘Me and Major Major,’ he boasted, in the same tough, clipped
tones of the night before, ‘can beat hell out of any man in my outfit.’ The
officers on the base took action on the Major Major problem later that same
day. How could they cope with a major like Major Major? To demean him
personally would be to demean all other officers of equal or lesser rank. To
treat him with courtesy, on the other hand, was unthinkable. Fortunately, Major
Major had applied for aviation cadet training. Orders transferring him away
were sent to the mimeograph room late in the afternoon, and at three o’clock in
the morning Major Major was again shaken roughly awake, bidden Godspeed by the
sergeant and placed aboard a plane heading west."|Catch-22|"Joseph Heller"
"ap 09:18"|nine-eighteen|"‘Now, men, we’re going to synchronize our watches,’ Colonel
Korn began promptly in a sharp, commanding manner, rolling his eyes
flirtatiously in General Dreedle’s direction. ‘We’re going to synchronize our
watches one time and one time only, and if it doesn’t come off in that one
time, General Dreedle and I are going to want to know why. Is that clear?’ He
fluttered his eyes toward General Dreedle again to make sure his plug had
registered. ‘Now set your watches for nine-eighteen.’ Colonel Korn synchronized
their watches without a single hitch and moved ahead with confidence. He gave
the men the colors of the day and reviewed the weather conditions with an
agile, flashy versatility, casting sidelong, simpering looks at General Dreedle
every few seconds to draw increased encouragement from the excellent impression
he saw he was making. Preening and pruning himself effulgendy and strutting
vaingloriously about the platform as he picked up momentum, he gave the men the
colors of the day again and shifted nimbly into a rousing pep talk on the
importance of the bridge at Avignon to the war effort and the obligation of
each man on the mission to place love of country above love of life. When his
inspiring dissertation was finished, he gave the men the colors of the day
still one more time, stressed the angle of approach and reviewed the weather
conditions again. Colonel Korn felt himself at the full height of his powers.
He belonged in the spotlight."|Catch-22|"Joseph Heller"
"ap 02:12"|"two twelve"|"‘You’ll get a good night’s sleep with the girls,’ Milo
replied with the same air of intrigue. ‘Remember your mission.’ But they got no
sleep at all, for Yossarian and Orr found themselves jammed into the same
double bed with the two twelve –year-old twenty-eight-year-old prostitutes, who
turned out to be oily and obese and who kept waking them up all night long to
ask them to switch partners. Yossarian’s perceptions were soon so fuzzy that he
paid no notice to the beige turban the fat one crowding into him kept wearing
until late the next morning when the scheming ten-year-old pimp with the Cuban
panatella snatched it off in public in a bestial caprice that exposed in the
brilliant Sicilian daylight her shocking, misshapen and denudate skull.
Vengeful neighbors had shaved her hair to the gleaming bone because she had
slept with Germans. The girl screeched in feminine outrage and waddled
comically after the scheming ten-year-old pimp, her grisly, bleak, violated
scalp slithering up and down ludicrously around the queer darkened wart of her
face like something bleached and obscene. Yossarian had never laid eyes on
anything so bare before. The pimp spun the turban high on his finger like a
trophy and kept himself skipping inches ahead of her finger tips as he led her
in a tantalizing circle around the square congested with people who were
howling with laughter and pointing to Yossarian with derision when Milo strode
up with a grim look of haste and puckered his lips reprovingly at the unseemly
spectacle of so much vice and frivolity. Milo insisted on leaving at once for
Malta."|Catch-22|"Joseph Heller"
"ap > 00:00"|"just after
twelve"|"But Yossarian was not nearly so frightened by the Egyptian
cotton Milo bought as he was by the bunches of green red bananas Milo had
spotted in the native market place as they drove into the city, and his fears
proved justified, for Milo shook him awake out of a deep sleep just after
twelve and shoved a partly peeled banana toward him. Yossarian choked back a
sob."|Catch-22|"Joseph Heller"
"ap < 11:00"|"a few minutes to eleven"|"The amazing place was a fertile, seething cornucopia of
female nipples and navels. At first, there were just their own three girls, in
the dimly-lit, drab brown sitting room that stood at the juncture of three
murky hallways leading in separate directions to the distant recesses of the
strange and marvelous bordello. The girls disrobed at once, pausing in
different stages to point proudly to their garish underthings and bantering all
the while with the gaunt and dissipated old man with the shabby long white hair
and slovenly white unbuttoned shirt who sat cackling lasciviously in a musty
blue armchair almost in the exact center of the room and bade Nately and his
companions welcome with a mirthful and sardonic formality. Then the old woman
trudged out to get a girl for Hungry Joe, dipping her captious head sadly, and
returned with two big-bosomed beauties, one already undressed and the other in
only a transparent pink half slip that she wiggled out of while sitting down.
Three more naked girls sauntered in from a different direction and remained to
chat, then two others. Four more girls passed through the room in an indolent
group, engrossed in conversation; three were barefoot and one wobbled
perilously on a pair of unbuckled silver dancing shoes that did not seem to be
her own. One more girl appeared wearing only panties and sat down, bringing the
total congregating there in just a few minutes to eleven, all but one of them
completely unclothed."|Catch-22|"Joseph Heller"
00:00|midnight|"There were no more beautiful days. There were no more easy
missions. There was stinging rain and dull, chilling fog, and the men flew at
week-long intervals, whenever the weather cleared. At night the wind moaned.
The gnarled and stunted tree trunks creaked and groaned and forced Yossarian’s
thoughts each morning, even before he was fully awake, back on Kid Sampson’s
skinny legs bloating and decaying, as systematically as a ticking clock, in the
icy rain and wet sand all through the blind, cold, gusty October nights. After
Kid Sampson’s legs, he would think of pitiful, whimpering Snowden freezing to
death in the rear section of the plane, holding his eternal, immutable secret
concealed inside his quilted, armor-plate flak suit until Yossarian had
finished sterilizing and bandaging the wrong wound on his leg, and then
spilling it out suddenly all over the floor. At night when he was trying to
sleep, Yossarian would call the roll of all the men, women and children he had
ever known who were now dead. He tried to remember all the soldiers, and he
resurrected images of all the elderly people he had known when a child—all the
aunts, uncles, neighbors, parents and grandparents, his own and everyone else’s,
and all the pathetic, deluded shopkeepers who opened their small, dusty stores
at dawn and worked in them foolishly until midnight. They were all dead, too.
The number of dead people just seemed to increase. And the Germans were still
fighting. Death was irreversible, he suspected, and he began to think he was
going to lose."|Catch-22|"Joseph Heller"

‘Both.’"|Catch-22|"Joseph Heller"
