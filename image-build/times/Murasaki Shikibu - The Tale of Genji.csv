This news put His Majesty in such a state that he shut himself away, wholly lost to all around him."|"The Tale of Genji"|"Murasaki Shikibu"

Those in close attendance upon him, ladies and gentlemen alike, murmured anxiously about how disturbing it all was. Perhaps he had been fated to love her, but for him to have ignored the reproofs and the anger of so many, to have flouted for her sake the standards of proper conduct, and even now to ignore public affairs as he was doing— this, they all whispered, was most unfortunate, and they cited in this connection events in the land beyond the sea."|"The Tale of Genji"|"Murasaki Shikibu"

Midnight must have passed, and the wind had picked up. The pines were roaring like a whole forest, and an eerie bird uttered raucous cries; he wondered whether it was an owl. The house was so dreary, so lonely, so silent. Oh, why, he bitterly asked himself in vain regret, why had he chosen to spend the night in this dreadful place? The frantic Ukon clung to him, shaking as though she would die. He held her and wondered miserably what was to become of her. He alone had remained lucid, and now he, too, was at his wits’ end."|"The Tale of Genji"|"Murasaki Shikibu"
00:00|midnight|"At last Koremitsu arrived. He had always been at Genji's service, midnight or dawn, yet tonight of all nights he had been delinquent and failed to answer his lord's call. Genji had him come in, despite his displeasure, and he had so much to tell that words failed him at first. Ukon gathered that Koremitsu was there, and she wept to remember all that had happened. Genji, too, broke down. While alone he had borne up as well as he could and held his love in his arms, but Koremitsu's arrival had brought him the respite to know his grief, and for some time he could only weep and weep."|"The Tale of Genji"|"Murasaki Shikibu"

Lamplight glowed faintly through the cracks, and he heard a woman weeping within. Outside, two or three monks chatted between spells of silently calling Amida's Name. The early night office in the nearby temples was over, and deep quiet reigned, while toward Kiyomizu there were lights and signs of dense habitation. A venerable monk, the nun's own son, was chanting scripture in such tones as to arouse holy awe. Genji felt as though he would weep until his tears ran dry."|"The Tale of Genji"|"Murasaki Shikibu"
"< 12:00"|"toward noon"|"Genji was wondering, as the sun rose toward noon and he continued the rite, how his fever would now behave, when one of his men remarked, “Instead of just worrying, my lord, you should somehow get your mind off the matter”; and so Genji went onto the mountain behind the temple and looked out toward the City."|"The Tale of Genji"|"Murasaki Shikibu"

"< 12:00"|"Toward midday"|"Toward midday he returned. “You seem to be ill. What is wrong, then? Today will be no fun if we cannot play Go.” He peeped in: she was still lying with the bedclothes over her head. The gentlewomen drew back as he went to her. “Why will you not talk to me? You do not like me after all, do you. Your gentlewomen must be wondering about all this.” He pulled the covers off her and found her drenched in perspiration. Even the hair at her forehead was soaking wet. “Oh, dear, we cannot have this! What a fuss you are making!” She was still furious with him, though, despite his attempts to console her, and she refused him a single word in reply. “Very well, then,” he said reproachfully, “I will not come anymore. I feel quite unwanted.” He opened the writing box and peered inside, but there was nothing in it. What a little girl she still is! He contemplated her fondly. He spent the whole day trying to make her feel better, and her refusal to yield only made her more precious."|"The Tale of Genji"|"Murasaki Shikibu"

Her strangely prolonged indisposition had left her continually listless and depressed, but she rose after all when he arrived and took shelter behind a standing curtain. He himself was sober and somewhat formal in manner, and he confined his conversation to banalities. Accustomed by now to commonplace, genteel company, she felt more keenly than ever both the ineffable quality of his presence and the surprise of her own embarrassing situation, and she wept. By and by the topic shifted to more personal matters, and Genji, leaning on a nearby armrest, peeped at her a little, while he continued their talk. She was very pretty indeed, and what with the new dignity and charm of her somewhat more slender features, he rued the folly of having let her go to anyone else."|"The Tale of Genji"|"Murasaki Shikibu"

Why, oh why, had her mistress not been married to a man like him? Chūnagon remembered how certain constraints had kept her mistress from rising particularly high in His Eminence's service, for the late Empress Mother had made much too much of what had happened, and the ensuing scandal had tarnished her name forever. Oh, I hope that this will not be all, she thought, when they must have so much more to tell each other! But Genji feared watching eyes too much merely to please himself, and his anxiety grew as the sun rose. His men had brought his carriage up to the gallery door, and he could hear them discreetly clearing their throats.
He called one and had him pick a cluster of those blossoms.

I know quite clearly now that the world will soon see no more of me.” And he continued, “Very well, I shall address you this way, from a distance. I beg you not to leave me!” He let go of her sleeve, and she slipped toward the inner room—and yet, he was deeply moved to find, not all the way. “Until day dawns, I shall take comfort from having you just that near,” he assured her. “I will do nothing more, I promise!” Sleep would not come, and he listened wide-eyed while the river roared ever louder.

How could she not think well of him? Surely even the bride understood that the time had come to yield a little. She looked quite lovely, and it seemed to him that, so perfectly dressed, she was truly without equal. That she should please even his eye, when he knew so many great ladies, and that in looks as in all other aspects of her person she should charm him so much more in intimacy—this brought broad, unabashed smiles to the rustic old women's faces. “What a shame it would have been to see so ravishing a young lady go to someone of no interest at all!

He wondered about the ceremony tonight, which he seemed to want to be as magnificent as possible, although he could obviously do only so much and no more. He felt somewhat constrained in the Counselor's presence, but the Counselor was after all a very close relative, and having no one else of the kind to turn to, he no doubt felt that he would do perfectly to lend a special touch to the event. The Counselor came more quickly than usual and was a great help in all sorts of ways, since in his estimation the matter did not concern him and he felt no regret.

Her height was perfect, and the length of her sidelocks and the set of her head struck him as exceptionally lovely. Her skin had an exquisite tone, her face an imposing dignity, and her glance a quickness so daunting that he was completely satisfied. She lacked nothing worthy of a beauty. At twenty-one or -two she was no longer a girl, and nothing about her conveyed immaturity; she resembled a flower in brilliant bloom. The studied care of her upbringing had rounded her perfectly. Her father must have worried endlessly on her behalf. For sweet, yielding charm, though, he thought first of the other one in the wing of his own residence. This one answered bashfully enough when spoken to, but she was not excessively reserved, and she was both handsome and intelligent. Her thirty young gentlewomen and six page girls were all flawless, and as far as their dress was concerned, His Highness's distaste for commonplace formality had prompted her father instead to encourage an almost baffling chic. The favor enjoyed by His Highness, as well as his personal quality, had apparently made His Excellency even keener on this daughter than on his eldest, by his wife at Sanjō who had gone to the Heir Apparent."|"The Tale of Genji"|"Murasaki Shikibu"

He also had pride to match, and he lived a life of ostentatious refinement, but for all his fastidious ways, he remained at heart strangely crude and countrified. No doubt because he had been buried so long, ever since his youth, in the distant wilds of the East, peculiar sounds crept into his voice, and he spoke with something of an accent; and for this reason he feared and shunned the company of the mighty. In all things he was quick to assure his own advantage. As to pretty accomplishments, he knew nothing of flutes or strings, being instead very good with a bow. His wealth attracted nice young women to his household, common though it might be, to dress in the height of fashion, to vie with one another over broken-backed poems, to amuse themselves with tales and Kōshin vigils, and generally to immerse themselves in deplorably vain tastes and amusements."|"The Tale of Genji"|"Murasaki Shikibu"

All right, there are other girls in this world who get on without their mothers!” At midday he and her nurse started dressing her, and the result was not bad at all. At fifteen or sixteen she was very small and plump, with beautiful hair the length of her dress gown and rich and thick at the ends. Her father, who thought it a treasure, stroked it smooth. “Well, now, I really shouldn't have made off this way with a gentleman your mother meant for someone else,” he said, “but in rank he is a prize, and in personal quality he is so outstanding that many people are desperate to have him as a son-in-law, and I hated the thought of losing him.” The fool!

Her trousers were crimson, as hers had been yesterday, and her abundant hair was as superbly long, but alas, the effect was not at all the same; perhaps they were really too unlike each other. He called for a block of ice that he had the women split, and he felt secretly amused with himself when he gave her a piece. Come, he thought, has no one ever painted his love so as to be able to contemplate her portrait? Surely the lady before me is worthy to afford me this consolation!
