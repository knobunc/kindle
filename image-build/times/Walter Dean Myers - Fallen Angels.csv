14:00|"1400 hours"|"“Okay, listen up!” A sergeant stood in the aisles with a clipboard. “We re scheduled to arrive at Tan Son Nhut, the ree-public of Vietnam, at 1400 hours. When you deplane, you will form four ranks in the area designated by Lieutenant Wilson. There will be no grab-ass, no excessive running off at the mouth, and no wandering around. Is that clear?”"|"Fallen Angels"|"Walter Dean Myers"
13:20|"1320 hours"|"I had to go to the john. I thought about it for a while and looked back toward the plane’s johns. Too late. The line already stretched hallway down the aisle. It was 1320 hours, twenty minutes past one o’clock civilian time. We’d be in Nam in less than an hour. I thought of writing Mom and took out my paper. All I could think of was the date: September 15, 1967-"|"Fallen Angels"|"Walter Dean Myers"

14:30|"1430 hours"|"I didn’t really know Judy, and I probably wouldn’t have had the nerve to kiss her in front of everybody, even if I did. We watched the medics go toward the buses while the rest of us stood in the sun. I checked my watch, and it was 1430 hours."|"Fallen Angels"|"Walter Dean Myers"
15:30|"1530 hours"|"The next time I checked my watch it was 1530 hours, and we were still standing in the sun. Once I had figured that of the seven months I had spent in the army, four of them had been standing around waiting for something to happen. Vietnam might have been a different place, but the army hadn’t changed."|"Fallen Angels"|"Walter Dean Myers"
16:00|"1600 hours"|"We went back to waiting in the sun. We waited until 1600 hours. Then the trucks came."|"Fallen Angels"|"Walter Dean Myers"
23:52|"eight to midnight"|"I got guard duty with Lobel. Sergeant Walcott from Bravo Company was sergeant of the guard, and he gave us a pep talk. We were on from eight to midnight."|"Fallen Angels"|"Walter Dean Myers"
12:00|"1200 hours"|"We got into the Hueys — big, mean-looking choppers — at 1200 hours and headed north. Part of the squad was in the first chopper and the rest in the second. The news guys were filming everything. We landed in a sandy area about two kilometers from the sea."|"Fallen Angels"|"Walter Dean Myers"
"~ 04:00"|"about 0400 hours"|"I woke up in the morning, about 0400 hours, with the worst pain I’ve ever had in my life. I thought I was having an attack of appendicitis. I was doubled up in bed and had to crawl out of the bed to get to where Peewee was sleeping. I shook him, and when he opened his eyes I told him I needed help. He got up right away and went to get a medic."|"Fallen Angels"|"Walter Dean Myers"
"ap 05:10"|0510|"0510. I could hardly stand up I had so much pain. I went to the latrine. I crapped out most of my insides. The cramps were worse. When I got back to the bunk, my hands were shaking."|"Fallen Angels"|"Walter Dean Myers"
"ap 05:20"|0520|"0520. I crapped out the rest of my insides. I was getting nauseous from the stink. I was sweating."|"Fallen Angels"|"Walter Dean Myers"
"ap 05:41"|0541|"0541. I tried to hold off, but I couldn’t. I didn’t have anything left to crap out so I just crapped out water."|"Fallen Angels"|"Walter Dean Myers"

0555. Again. I stopped off at Jamal’s hooch and got the Kleenex.

"ap 04:50"|Four-fifty|"“Four-fifty! Four-fifty!” The shout went down the line. Someone had spotted where the firing was coming from and estimated it to be four hundred and fifty meters in front of us. Scotty was leveling the legs of the tripod, and I jerked open the metal ammo case."|"Fallen Angels"|"Walter Dean Myers"

23:00|"2300 hours"|"At 2300 hours I had to pee. Actually, I had to do more than that but no way I was taking my pants down out in the boonies. I felt around me to see if I was on an incline, decided I wasn’t, and lay on one side and peed as quietly as I could."|"Fallen Angels"|"Walter Dean Myers"
18:00|"1800 hours"|"An intelligence report said that our village was going to be hit by the VC at 1800 hours the next day. Eighteen hundred hours was a hell of a time. It would still be daylight, and if they showed up in the daylight, they would be demonstrating that they weren’t afraid of us, that we couldn’t protect the village."|"Fallen Angels"|"Walter Dean Myers"
20:00|"2000 hours"|"We were picked up at 2000 hours. The LZ was in tall grass, which made us all feel uneasy. Somebody said that an ARVN captain had selected it. The only thing I really knew about ARVNs was what Sergeant Simpson said, and that wasn’t good. He said that some units were good, as good as anything we had to offer. Other units were crap, and would bug out on you in a moment."|"Fallen Angels"|"Walter Dean Myers"
20:35|"2035 hours"|"We hit the LZ at 2035 hours. We went in first and cleared the LZ, and then the ARVNs came in. We had four squads, but only twenty-five, maybe twenty-six, guys. All of the squads were short except ours. Simpson said that they kept our squad up to par because the battalion commander liked him."|"Fallen Angels"|"Walter Dean Myers"
10:00|"1000 hours"|"The “patrol” turned out to be a company-sized sweep. We were supposed to take off at 1000 hours. At 0930 hours three Hueys, escorted by two Spook-ies, huge C-47 gunships, came in. It was the rest of our outfit."|"Fallen Angels"|"Walter Dean Myers"

11:17|"1117 hours"|"The company hit the landing zone at 1117 hours. Some squads from Second Platoon went in first. They didn’t get any fire, but they looked confused on the ground. We soon got the word that there were punji sticks in the tall grass we were jumping down into. They were sharpened sticks stuck into the ground or in pits. Usually they were covered with shit, either human shit or animal shit, so when they stuck you, you got infected. No one in our squad hit the punji sticks as we landed, and we started moving out toward the wood line. There was no resistance."|"Fallen Angels"|"Walter Dean Myers"
20:00|"2000 hours"|"We went out on guard duty at 2000 hours. It was my first real duty since I had got back to the squad. I hit the guard position and inspected it. It looked okay. It was a foxhole with sandbags around the top, and boards at the bottom to stand on. The boards were rickety, but they were better than oozing down into the mud. I lifted the boards and dug it down another foot."|"Fallen Angels"|"Walter Dean Myers"
10:00|"1000 hours"|"We waited. I checked my watch and it was 1000 hours. The barrage on the hill stopped. The sounds of a firefight on the other side of the hill picked up. Still, our squad waited. Gearhart was signaling. I looked over at him. He was pointing toward the trees. Okay, look out for snipers."|"Fallen Angels"|"Walter Dean Myers"
11:30|"1130 hours"|"We looked around and found cover.
Wait. It was 1130 hours.
We dug in. Charlie had taught us well. We rested. We sat. Gearhart was on the radio. I tried to read him from where I was. Next to Gearhart, lying exhausted on the ground, was Jamal."|"Fallen Angels"|"Walter Dean Myers"
"< 12:00"|"almost 1200 hours"|"We waited until almost 1200 hours before Gearhart signaled for us to move out. We moved back down the hill. We backed down the best we could. We got to the bottom and then ran the distance back to the paddy. Then we started back through it. It began to rain lightly."|"Fallen Angels"|"Walter Dean Myers"
13:20|"1320 hours"|"They left a small headquarters contingent behind as they moved out. Charlie Company moved out after the tail end of the ARVNs, which were mostly mortar teams. We followed Charlie Company.
It was 1320 hours.
The first fire came from the flank. Two squads of ARVNs moved out to suppress it."|"Fallen Angels"|"Walter Dean Myers"
14:00|"1400 hours"|"Ten minutes later two gunships came in and cleared everything from around the village. Above them I could see the stack of medevac choppers.
It was 1400 hours.
