The sheep lifted her head and the coyote trotted close and cut her throat with one swift open-fanged swipe. She knelt, folding her knees under her a good deal like the Lamb in pictures of the Holy Family, and died. It was so simple and she was so quiet about it that it scarcely seemed a finish to anything. But it was one, as the coyote proceeded to demonstrate sickeningly and unquestionably. He took a good long look around, and then dropped his muzzle and lapped the fresh blood under the sheep's chin."|"Honey in the Horn"|"H. L. Davis"

There had been times that he could hardly have got through without him—the night with the drowning sheep, the night in Wade Shiveley's hide-out. But he didn't believe there were any times ahead of him that he would need help with—not that kind of help, at least—and the only sensation he felt was relief because the faint flute-twittering supplied a little extra material for conversation with the girl. Couples in that country made an important point of keeping up talk about something when they were alone together. Not that they underrated the beauty of wordless communion of spirits, but because merely sitting and lallygagging always brought to mind the case of the Scandinavian hired man in the lower valley who, after a fourteen-hour working-day, would tog up and hoof it nine miles to sit up with his girl, a quarter-breed cook for a neighboring farm. According to the story, they would sit from seven till past"|"Honey in the Horn"|"H. L. Davis"

""Huhuh, don't."" ""Why hadn't I better?"" ""'Cause."" ""'Cause what?"" ""Oh, 'cause."" Which ritual of reciprocal devotion was followed by another two hours of admiring silence and then the same rigmarole all over again. It seemed to fill all emotional requirements when the hired man and his girl did it, but it got out on them and people laughed at them. So other couples avoided such interchanges for fear of being considered like them. Clay and the horse-trader's girl talked at the gate and said everything they could think of without saying exactly what they wanted to till dark, and then they went in to one of old Simmons' company suppers. The difference between it and his company dinners and breakfasts was that there was lamplight to eat by and that instead of sliced venison-liver he had opened two cans of his preserved deer meat. He bragged on it a good deal while they ate it, but he was entitled to. A man would have had to do some reaching around to find a better way to cook deer meat than that."|"Honey in the Horn"|"H. L. Davis"

He always got up at four in the morning, though it wouldn't have mattered to anybody on earth if he had lain in bed till the next sundown. He spread down on the fir-bough pallet in his living-room. The horse-trader's wife and Luce brought their own beds in from the wagon and set them up in the kitchen, and the horse-trader and Clay went out to sleep in the haymow. Clay lay awake a long time, watching the moon through the log-chinks. The Indian boy was riding by that moon; probably he was knocking the feet off his red colt in the lava-beds below the deep snow already. Nobody would know till spring whether he had died in the pass or made it across. If he did die, the word would be sure to get around, because he could be identified by his crippled hands. But if he got through he might never be heard of again, because that eastern Oregon was so big a country. A man almost had to die in it to attract any notice."|"Honey in the Horn"|"H. L. Davis"

She was unshirking, lively, and good-humored with a kind of here-goes-nothing recklessness about her, though that might have been caused by the amount of notice their partnership let them in for. The hop-field had seemed a place where people minded their own business and let one another alone, but it wasn't any such thing. It was a good deal like an inquisitive-minded village, that had kept its identity, its social levels, and its inquisitiveness unaltered through all the moving around it did in the course of the year. Women left their work and came clear from the other end of the field to see how Clay and the woman looked since their consolidation. Men went out of their way to stroll past and look them over, and then carried the news to other men and strolled back with them to prove that they had told only the gospel truth. The rush of sightseers let up at noon because most of the pickers went back to camp for dinner. Clay and the woman ate theirs in the field under a hop-vine. It consisted of bread, butter, and corned beef out of a can, and while they were eating it Luce passed on her way in to camp. She got close before she noticed them, and she walked past without speaking. Clay had expected that, but he hadn't expected that it would make him feel"|"Honey in the Horn"|"H. L. Davis"

Old squatters from the creek canyons bucked mud and wet brush and risked rheumatism for the sake of somebody to talk to, when all the good they got out of their visits was to pick quarrels and flounce back home to their heart-eating loneliness again. Even the Indians in the river village turned short-tempered, though they had had around forty generations of continuous residence to get accustomed to the climate in. The horse-trader and his wife lost flesh and color, squabbled incessantly, and split the blankets and whacked up the cooking-utensils to separate permanently at least once a week. No play-parties or dances went on, because the people who had lived that season out before knew there was no use trying to improve or lighten it. To Clay, it was the best time of all. He liked it so deeply that he deliberately avoided the company-hungry settlers for fear they would notice it on him and feel insulted about it. The raining-in of all the roads meant only that nobody would come across the mountains after him. Darkness and the storms jarring the ground and flattening trees made life pleasanter by showing how powerless all that strength was to hurt or disturb him. It was the same with Luce, and during all those days when they had to burn candles at noon to read by, he remembered how she had looked riding back from the beach with him ahead of a storm.

He had a clear recollection that he had taken them all with him when he moved. The trouble was that he remembered with equal positiveness that he had taken his pistol along, too, and it had turned out that he hadn't moved it from the jockey-box on the wagon. It was his memory against her word, and his memory had let him down once, so he didn't dare trust it. ""Them weight-tickets of mine wasn't enough to buy that kind of rifle with,"" he pointed out.

Axe-work was hard because the ship was teetered over at an angle. The deck, which was easiest to cut through, stuck so high out of the water that cutting it would do no good. They had to coon up the tilted hull and cut down through that, and the first two days they worked themselves to a frazzle without even loosening a plank. The third day went better.

Out here it doesn't make so much difference, but we've got settled country to cross yet, and then it will.

He took a shot from his bottle, and tendered it to Clay absently.

Most of them were poor and either scared to death of the chances they had taken in settling there or too ignorant to realize that they had taken any.

That lasted all that day. When he dozed she woke him up and cried fiercely about his selfishness, callousness, cowardice, clutching him desperately so he wouldn't leave her and talking out spite and hatred of him in a shrill voice that was all the harder to stand because it sounded perfectly natural and calculated. There was nothing that she wanted him to do, nothing that he could do. What seemed to hurt her most was the injustice of her having to suffer for what they had both done. She hated him when he ate and when he tilted over and dozed, because she could not. The right word possibly would have soothed her, but he didn't know what the right word would be.
