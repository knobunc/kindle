In 1. 68 Dante informed us that it was about 6:00 P.M. (see note 12).

Pisces, the Fish, is on the horizon, while the Great Bear, or Great Dipper (the ”Wain“), is in the northwestern part of the heavens (Caurus is the northwest wind).

Medieval tradition held that Cain had been banished to the moon for his killing of Abel: The reference to “Cain and the thorns” is the equivalent of our own Man in the Moon. The moon is setting in the ocean west of Seville over a point that divides the hemisphere of the land from that of the water, and scholars have calculated that the time is therefore 6:00 A.M. on Holy Saturday, 1300. What Dante means when he writes that the moon  assisted the Pilgrim “within the forest deep”—this would have been in canto I, when he was lost and confused in the dark forest—is simply unclear."|"The Inferno"|"Dante Alighieri"
