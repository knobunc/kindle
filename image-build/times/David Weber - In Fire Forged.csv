"ap 04:50"|"four hours and fifty minutes"|"“If they’re going to Sphinx?” Michael replied. “I’ve run the numbers, and a Pryderi should do it in roughly four hours and fifty minutes. We can only shave about seven or eight minutes off of their time, and they’ll have a good twenty-minute head start. That means we aren’t going to catch them short of the planet, but we’ll be right on their heels, certainly close enough to see where they go. I can com ahead to have a shuttle waiting for us when we make orbit. I expect we’ll have just a few advantages when it comes to getting Astro Control to clear us to planet, too. We may actually be on the ground before they are—assuming they’re headed for the surface, and not one of the orbital habitats. If we don’t beat them down, it’ll be neck-and-neck, at the very worst.”"|"In Fire Forged"|"David Weber"
"ap 03:40"|"Three hours and forty minutes"|"Three hours and forty minutes had passed since they had cleared Manticore orbit, and they were just over fifty-five and a half million kilometers short of Sphinx, decelerating hard. Banshee was twenty million kilometers ahead of them, also decelerating. The other runabout would enter Sphinx orbit in another fifty-nine minutes; Ogapoge was fourteen minutes behind her."|"In Fire Forged"|"David Weber"
"ap ~ 10:00"|"around ten o’clock"|"“Yes,” Armond cut him off. “My apologies, Mr. Dozewah, but I think we’re going to have to end things for today. Can we pick it up again tomorrow morning? Say, around ten o’clock?”"|"In Fire Forged"|"David Weber"
10:20|"10:20 am"|"It was actually closer to four weeks before Weiss finally got the message he’d been expecting. It was short and unsigned and waiting in his inbox when he arrived at his desk: 1522 Rue de Leon, today, 10:20 am. Charles, it appeared, was finally ready."|"In Fire Forged"|"David Weber"
"ap 03:20"|"Three hours twenty minutes"|"The commander of the crippled cruiser was starting to sputter a reply when Tyler cut off the transmission. “Time to hyper limit?” he asked.
“Three hours twenty minutes,” the helm replied.
“Good.” Tyler took a minute to study the long-range displays, searching for anything that might be able to catch the Ellipsis before he could escape from the system. But he’d planned his attack carefully, and there wasn’t a single thing the Andermani could throw at him."|"In Fire Forged"|"David Weber"
"ap 02:45"|"two hours and forty-five minutes"|"“They only carried about twelve hundred KPS across the wall with them, and they’re only showing about two hundred gravities. Call it . . . two hours and forty-five minutes, give or take a couple of seconds.”"|"In Fire Forged"|"David Weber"
13:00|"one pm"|"The author begins with the photon wavelength. One might as well use frequency or energy because they are all mathematically equivalent but weapons designers fairly consistently use wavelength. Early space energy weapons used photons in the ultraviolet, visible, infrared, and even the radio range. These wavelengths are impractical to focus at contemporary combat ranges so modern weapons use shorter wavelength photons in the X-ray to gamma ray range. Indeed, modern space weapon lasers are so commonly X-ray lasers that the term “laser” is generally synonymous with “xraser” in naval parlance. Their rarer gamma emitting cousins are called “grasers.” Both of these words have their obvious origin with the ancient “laser” though the fact that many such weapons do not operate on the principle of “stimulated emission” is generally forgotten. Confusion sometimes results because different scientific and engineering communities have different definitions of exactly what constitutes the cutoff between X and gamma rays. An astronomer’s X-ray might be a particle beam engineer’s gamma ray and so on. There appears little hope at this writing of ever clearing this up completely. This article uses the terminology of the Interstellar Association of Astronautical Engineers that a photon with a wavelength greater than one picometer (10 meters) is an X-ray and light with a wavelength shorter than that is a gamma ray. This value was chosen because one pm is a good cutoff point when discussing armor and weapons effects. This is because light begins to exhibit deep penetrating characteristics in common spacecraft materials for wavelengths shorter than this so that a graser cannon operating at 0.1 picometers damages a target in different ways than a laser at 10 picometers."|"In Fire Forged"|"David Weber"
