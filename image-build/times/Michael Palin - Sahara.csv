But the smarter the hotel the less easy it is these days to throw open the curtains, and by the time I’ve found the right cord to pull and disentangled the net from the main drape I’m seriously irritated and irreversibly awake."|Sahara|"Michael Palin"

04:00|"4 a.m."|"To an ear disoriented by deep sleep it sounds like bagpipes warming up or a very ancient siren being cranked into life. Then, after a moment of struggling wakefulness, it coalesces into a rough approximation of a voice, albeit weirdly stretched and distorted. Just as it seems to grow clear and explicable another voice chimes in, at a different pitch and much further away, then another, close by, hard, hooting and metallic, then another and another, until waves of overlapping, over-amplified exhortation burst from the darkened city. If I knew Arabic I would know they were saying, ‘God is Great. There is No God But God. Prayer is Better than Sleep.’
I check my watch. It’s 4 a.m.
Soobh Fegr, the dawn summons, is one of five calls to prayer that mark the Muslim day. I have heard it many times, but never anything as spectacular or prolific as the prayer calls of Fez, a rolling wall of sound rising from over fifty mosques, cradled in a bowl of hills."|Sahara|"Michael Palin"
"ap 01:00"|one|"At one stop I watch a man in a djellaba and straw hat scraping up donkey droppings from the middle of the road with two boards. I can’t work out if he’s from the council or just an opportunist. When I was growing up in Sheffield the police horses used to pass our house on some sort of exercise, and if any dung was left behind I had to watch in profound embarrassment as my father and our next door neighbour, both keen rose-growers, raced out with shovels and fought over it."|Sahara|"Michael Palin"
"ap 05:00"|"Five o’clock"|"Five o’clock. Woken by the chimes of a grandfather clock.

"ap 09:00"|nine|"We reach Mejik a little before nine. Though there is a well-lit UN compound near by, we are booked once again into a barracks, set in a crumbling concrete-walled enclosure. Someone has at least made a stab at brightening up the place. The narrow, unroofed strip of passageway outside our rooms has been laid with crazy paving, and along it runs a dried-up garden bed decorated with Russian shell-cases. The accommodation, consisting of two large unfurnished dormitories, a lavatory and washroom, is much the same as at Tfariti, except that, instead of a plastic jug, this lavatory has a luxury attachment, a flush."|Sahara|"Michael Palin"

Compared with the Saharawis, the Mauritanians, marked out by their billowing pale blue robes, which they call boubous, carry with them a worldliness, a touch of confidence and panache, which comes, I suppose, from having a country of your own."|Sahara|"Michael Palin"

There must be a couple of hundred people gathered here as the monster of a train shuffles slowly towards us.

It’s nine o’clock by my watch when Cassa returns with furrowed brow and motions us into the vehicles."|Sahara|"Michael Palin"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"You have to be up at sparrow-fart to catch the Rally. The first riders on this time-trial stage, a loop starting and ending in Atar, have left the airport by eight o’clock, and it’s been a long and tricky drive to find a position along the course ahead of them. Once again, the first sign of activity is aerial. A muttering and thudding fills the valley and seconds later a silver helicopter streaks in over sand and stone tracks it has taken us an hour to negotiate. It circles gracefully, picks a spot and swoops to earth, disgorging a camera crew at the point where the piste is marked by a low but nasty run of bumps. A few locals have gathered to watch. They crouch on their haunches, arms resting on knees, looking more bemused than expectant. A donkey watches impassively from a nearby clump of tamarisk trees. A few yards further on, a group of village women are standing up against a flimsy fence, holding a sign on which is written ‘Go, Johnny Go!’, believed to be a reference to the presence of the veteran Gallic rocker Johnny Hallyday in one of the cars."|Sahara|"Michael Palin"
"ap 06:00"|"Six o’clock"|"Six o’clock. The best time of day. People are out in the streets again, shops are open, children, rolling old tyres, race after each other.

It requires a vivid imagination to evoke the glory days of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, when Ibn Battuta came down here from Tangiers, when there were seventy-six libraries in the town and when the constant coming and going of camel trains between Morocco and the fabulous kingdom of Mali made Chinguetti one of the centres of the civilised world."|Sahara|"Michael Palin"

The fields contain sugar cane, rice and grazing land, grown under a scheme which I see from a billboard is financed by the government of the Emirates, 3000 miles across the other side of the desert. An example of pan-Islamic co-operation, which could prove a much bigger influence on West Africa than anything French, American or Chinese."|Sahara|"Michael Palin"

Very un-African."|Sahara|"Michael Palin"

"ap 01:00"|"one o’clock"|"By one o’clock the crowd has grown to several thousand and I’m told this will last long into the night. Mindful of the fact that we start a thirty-six-hour train journey tomorrow, I’m going to have to go. A discreet exit is not possible. As I get up to leave one of the comperes spars up to me and draws me into the ring, dancing before me and grasping me in mock combat until he releases me with an enormous beam on his face. The crowd laughs and applauds. As we drive out of the dusty run-down suburbs and head for the sea, I’ll not easily forget my night in Pikine."|Sahara|"Michael Palin"
10:00|"ten o’clock this morning"|"Not surprisingly, the station from which we are due to leave at ten o’clock this morning is a confident example of the colonial style. It consists of three arched bays, framed by red and brown brickwork, with wrought-iron canopies, pilasters supporting decorated tile friezes, separate entrances marked ‘Depart and ‘Arrivee‘ and a big working clock in the central tower. On either side of the central facade are louvered galleries, which look to be occupied. Laundry lines swing in the breeze and I think I can see sheep up there."|Sahara|"Michael Palin"

Faced with the realisation that we shall have to spend another night on the train, the spirit seems to have gone out of everyone.

"~ 04:00"|"around 4 a.m."|"The Sahara is officially said to begin north of latitude 16. The Pays de Dogon (it sounds so much better in French) is around 14 degrees north, but the cool night, which had me scrambling into my sleeping bag around 4 a.m., and the sand that has already found its way into the most private parts of me and my luggage, take me right back to our days in Western Sahara. As if the insidious sand isn’t enough, there is the added refinement of krim-krim, thorny burrs camouflaged in sand, which attach themselves to skin and clothing like fishhooks. Those of us who have already used the bushes as our bathroom have been particularly affected, and in quite sensitive places too."|Sahara|"Michael Palin"
"ap 05:00"|five|"I learn all this from Amadou, an urbane English-speaking Dogon, who lives in Bandiagara. There is no shortage of esoteric information about the Dogon. In fact, there is a joke that runs ‘how many people are there in a Dogon family?’, the answer to which is five. Two parents, two children and one French anthropologist."|Sahara|"Michael Palin"
12:00|midday|"By midday we surrender to the ferocious heat burning off the rocks and take a break on the terrace that acts as the village’s reception area. Beneath a palm-thatch roof is a table, benches, a couple of hammocks and an array of carved artefacts. There are single figures, women with prominent eyes, long stylised faces and breasts projecting forward like rockets, and doors and panels with the ancestors kneeling in long rows, interwoven with lizards, tortoises and the most important creature in Dogon tradition, the serpent, credited with leading the Dogon people to the escarpment."|Sahara|"Michael Palin"

"ap < 06:00"|"just before six"|"Because of the great heat of the day, the comparatively cool hours around dawn are valuable and much gets done. We are up at first light, just before six, but the Wodaabe women have been at work for an hour or more. The thorn bushes are hung with washing. The children are up and dressed and their mothers are out finding wood for the fire. After this they still have to prepare the food, milk the cows and fetch water from the creek."|Sahara|"Michael Palin"

"ap 05:00"|five|"An hour later, the deep lilting cry of Tabelot’s muezzin calls the faithful to prayer. Check my clock. It’s five.

"ap 09:00"|9|"I’m told that in desert as hot as the Tenere, the human body loses 2 gallons of water a day, which is 9 litres, and 4 gallons if you’re on the move, so one should really keep drinking constantly. We have bottles of water with us but they heat up quickly and warm water is so much more difficult to gulp down. J-P has come up with an ingenious answer. He drops a couple of mint tea bags into a plastic bottle, which he wedges on top of the dashboard. The head-on sunlight heats it, the bounce of the vehicle stirs it and the near boiling infusion that results is a lot more palatable than lukewarm mineral water."|Sahara|"Michael Palin"

But it does mean that the room in which he worked is very little changed, apart from a sticker in Arabic on the door, which reads ‘In the name of God and Mohammed his messenger’. It’s small, maybe 15 by 18 feet, with grey-blue French windows opening onto the street with its neatly clipped shady trees.
