"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"I dream over the past when I have told the story to the children. I think of Alvean happily married to a Devonshire squire. As for Gilly, she never left me. She is with me now. At any moment she will appear on the lawn with the eleven o’clock coffee
which on warm days we take in that arbor in the south gardens where I first saw Lady Treslyn and Connan together."|"Mistress of Mellyn"|"Victoria Holt"
"ap > 06:00"|"just past six o’clock"|"I looked at the watch pinned to my blouse and saw that it was just past six o’clock. Two hours to dinner. I wondered whether to ring for Daisy or Kitty and ask for hot water; but I found my eyes turning to the other door in my room, the one which led to the schoolroom."|"Mistress of Mellyn"|"Victoria Holt"
"ap < 08:00"|"nearly eight o’clock"|"By the time I had unpacked my bags and hung up my things it was nearly eight o’clock, and precisely as the stable clock was striking eight Kitty appeared with my tray. On it was a leg of roast chicken with vegetables and, under a pewter cover, an egg custard."|"Mistress of Mellyn"|"Victoria Holt"

"ap 07:30"|"half past seven"|"Celestine smiled. “You are right. Indeed it is. She usually has her milk and biscuits in the schoolroom at half past seven. It is now well past eight. But tonight I will look after her. I suggest that you return to your room, Miss Leigh. You must be weary after your journey.”"|"Mistress of Mellyn"|"Victoria Holt"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"After tea I said to her: “I don’t know what rules your other

"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"At five o’clock she still had not put in an appearance, so I summoned Daisy and sent her to find the child and to remind her that from five to six we had work to do."|"Mistress of Mellyn"|"Victoria Holt"

"ap < 05:00"|"nearly five o’clock"|"I looked at my watch, and said: “I am going to ask you to excuse Alvean and me. It is nearly five o’clock and we have our studies between five and six.”"|"Mistress of Mellyn"|"Victoria Holt"
"ap > 06:00"|"a few minutes past six o’clock"|"It was about a week later that I first saw Linda Treslyn. It was a few minutes past six o’clock.

"ap 02:30"|2.30|"My dear Miss Leigh, [I read] 
I shall be here for a few weeks, I think, and I am sure you will 
agree that it would be very desirable for Alvean to join me here. 
I do not think she should miss her lessons, so I am asking you to 
bring her and be prepared to stay for a week or so. 
Perhaps you could be ready to leave tomorrow. Get Billy Trehay 
to drive you to the station for the 2.30 train."|"Mistress of Mellyn"|"Victoria Holt"
"ap 02:30"|two-thirty|"“Yes. Billy Trehay is to be given instructions to drive us to the station in time for the two-thirty train.”"|"Mistress of Mellyn"|"Victoria Holt"

"< 00:00"|"before midnight"|"“No. I don’t think he can possibly be here before midnight. He wrote that he had business to attend to this morning. I expect he’ll arrive tomorrow. Won’t you come in?”"|"Mistress of Mellyn"|"Victoria Holt"
