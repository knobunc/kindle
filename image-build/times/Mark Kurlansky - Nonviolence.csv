War is no more adapted to preserve liberty and produce a lasting peace than midnight darkness is to produce noonday light."|Nonviolence|"Mark Kurlansky"

18:40|1840|"Despite the frequent allegation that Garrison lacked organizing skills, strong and growing nonviolence and abolition movements developed around him in New England and throughout the country. By 1840, 200,000 Americans, including some Southerners, belonged to abolitionist societies. When Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel about a slave girl's escape, Uncle Tom's Cabin, was published in 1852, the 5,000-copy first edition sold out in forty-eight hours, and 300,000 copies were sold the first year alone."|Nonviolence|"Mark Kurlansky"
00:00|midnight|"When next I realized that the Philippines had dropped into our laps I confess I did not know what to do with them. I sought counsel from all sides, Democrats as well as Republicans, but got little help. I thought first that we should take only Manila; then Luzon; then other islands, perhaps also. I walked the floor until midnight; and I am not ashamed to tell you, gentlemen, that I went down on my knees and prayed Almighty God for light and guidance more than one night. And one night late it came to me this way—I don't know how, but it came … that there was nothing left for us to do but to take them all, and to educate the Filipinos, and uplift and civilize and Christianize them, and by God's grace do the very best we could for them, as our fellow men for whom Christ also died."|Nonviolence|"Mark Kurlansky"
19:44|1944|"In recent years, formerly secret documents have been released that make it clear that the Allied governments and militaries were well aware of the genocide in progress and consciously chose not to interfere with it. The claim often made by German citizens, by the populations of Britain and America including Jews, and by the British and American governments that they didn't know what was happening is simply not true. The very efficient code decipherers of British intelligence were reading reports from death camps at least as early as 1943. They may have intercepted messages earlier, but documents confirming this are still not available. But it is known that they listened in on conversations about the unsatisfactorily slow killing rate at Auschwitz. A Polish agent, Tadeusz Chciuk-Celt, parachuted into Poland in 1942 and reported back on the killing. Also in 1942 the Polish underground reported on the mass extermination of Jews. In 1943, the Polish government in exile in London urged the British to bomb Auschwitz, where Polish political prisoners were being killed. In any event, by 1944 escaped Auschwitz inmates had told the world exactly what was taking place there."|Nonviolence|"Mark Kurlansky"
19:00|"seven in the evening"|"Allied bombing of German cities during World War II killed approximately 300,000 German civilians and wounded almost 800,000. It is an emotionally moving though legally and morally irrelevant argument that these are small numbers for a people who exterminated six million in death camps. Of course, at the time, that argument was not even being made. In late 1940 the Germans bombed Coventry from seven in the evening until past six the following morning. Six hundred residents and a fourteenth-century cathedral were destroyed. Now British Bomber Command was given instructions to retaliate on German cities, and the targets would be the center of the city. In 1942 they were specifically told not to aim for military targets, such as aircraft factories and shipyards, but at densely populated areas, since the goal was to destroy the population's morale, which had also been Germany's goal in Coventry. With demoralization in mind, working-class districts in particular were to be sought out."|Nonviolence|"Mark Kurlansky"
