War is no more adapted to preserve liberty and produce a lasting peace than midnight darkness is to produce noonday light."|Nonviolence|"Mark Kurlansky"

00:00|midnight|"When next I realized that the Philippines had dropped into our laps I confess I did not know what to do with them. I sought counsel from all sides, Democrats as well as Republicans, but got little help. I thought first that we should take only Manila; then Luzon; then other islands, perhaps also. I walked the floor until midnight; and I am not ashamed to tell you, gentlemen, that I went down on my knees and prayed Almighty God for light and guidance more than one night. And one night late it came to me this way—I don't know how, but it came … that there was nothing left for us to do but to take them all, and to educate the Filipinos, and uplift and civilize and Christianize them, and by God's grace do the very best we could for them, as our fellow men for whom Christ also died."|Nonviolence|"Mark Kurlansky"
19:00|"seven in the evening"|"Allied bombing of German cities during World War II killed approximately 300,000 German civilians and wounded almost 800,000. It is an emotionally moving though legally and morally irrelevant argument that these are small numbers for a people who exterminated six million in death camps. Of course, at the time, that argument was not even being made. In late 1940 the Germans bombed Coventry from seven in the evening until past six the following morning. Six hundred residents and a fourteenth-century cathedral were destroyed. Now British Bomber Command was given instructions to retaliate on German cities, and the targets would be the center of the city. In 1942 they were specifically told not to aim for military targets, such as aircraft factories and shipyards, but at densely populated areas, since the goal was to destroy the population's morale, which had also been Germany's goal in Coventry. With demoralization in mind, working-class districts in particular were to be sought out."|Nonviolence|"Mark Kurlansky"
