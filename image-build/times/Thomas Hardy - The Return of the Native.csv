legitimate indulgence when he laid himself open to influences such
as these. Colours and beauties so far subdued were, at least, the
birthright of all. Only in summer days of highest feather did its
mood touch the level of gaiety. Intensity was more usually reached
by way of the solemn than by way of the brilliant, and such a sort
of intensity was often arrived at during winter darkness, tempests,

its lover, and the wind its friend. Then it became the home of
strange phantoms; and it was found to be the hitherto unrecognized

following these incipient paths, when there was not light enough in
the atmosphere to show a turnpike road, lay in the development of
the sense of touch in the feet, which comes with years of
night-rambling in little-trodden spots. To a walker practised in

of her hair, her general figure might have stood for that of either
of the higher female deities. The new moon behind her head, an old

pollen and black-currant juice, in the absence of water-colours. By

honestly make use of you as a friend, or must close with you as a
lover—that is what I must ask myself. If I wish to go and decide to
accept your company I will signal to you some evening at eight

"ap ~ 04:00"|"About four o'clock"|"Towards evening on the sixth her determination to go away again
revived. About four o'clock she packed up anew the few small
articles she had brought in her flight from Alderworth, and also
some belonging to her which had been left here; the whole formed a
bundle not too large to be carried in her hand for a distance of a
mile or two. The scene without grew darker; mud-coloured clouds
bellied downwards from the sky like vast hammocks slung across it,
and with the increase of night a stormy wind arose; but as yet
there was no rain."|"The Return of the Native"|"Thomas Hardy"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o'clock"|"At eight o'clock, the hour at which Eustacia had promised to
signal Wildeve if ever she signalled at all, she looked around the
premises to learn if the coast was clear, went to the furze-rick,
and pulled thence a long-stemmed bough of that fuel. This she
carried to the corner of the bank, and, glancing behind to see if
the shutters were all closed, she struck a light, and kindled the
furze. When it was thoroughly ablaze Eustacia took it by the stem
and waved it in the air above her head till it had burned itself
out."|"The Return of the Native"|"Thomas Hardy"
00:00|midnight|"She was gratified, if gratification were possible to such a
mood, by seeing a similar light in the vicinity of Wildeve's
residence a minute or two later. Having agreed to keep watch at
this hour every night, in case she should require assistance, this
promptness proved how strictly he had held to his word. Four hours
after the present time, that is, at midnight, he was to be ready to
drive her to Budmouth, as prearranged."|"The Return of the Native"|"Thomas Hardy"
"ap ~ 10:00"|"About ten o'clock"|"Eustacia returned to the house. Supper having been got over she
retired early, and sat in her bedroom waiting for the time to go
by. The night being dark and threatening, Captain Vye had not
strolled out to gossip in any cottage or to call at the inn, as was
sometimes his custom on these long autumn nights; and he sat
sipping grog alone downstairs. About ten o'clock there was a knock
at the door. When the servant opened it the rays of the candle fell
upon the form of Fairway."|"The Return of the Native"|"Thomas Hardy"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o'clock"|"At eleven o'clock he went to bed himself, smoked for some time
in his bedroom, put out his light at half-past eleven, and then, as
was his invariable custom, pulled up the blind before getting into
bed, that he might see which way the wind blew on opening his eyes
in the morning, his bedroom window commanding a view of the
flagstaff and vane. Just as he had lain down he was surprised to
observe the white pole of the staff flash into existence like a
streak of phosphorus drawn downwards across the shade of night
without. Only one explanation met this—a light had been suddenly
thrown upon the pole from the direction of the house. As everybody
had retired to rest the old man felt it necessary to get out of
bed, open the window softly, and look to the right and left.
Eustacia's bedroom was lighted up, and it was the shine from her
window which had lighted the pole. Wondering what had aroused her,
he remained undecided at the window, and was thinking of fetching
the letter to slip it under her door, when he heard a slight
brushing of garments on the partition dividing his room from the
passage."|"The Return of the Native"|"Thomas Hardy"

had lighted her candle, put on some warm outer wrappings, taken her
bag in her hand, and, extinguishing the light again, descended the
staircase. When she got into the outer air she found that it had
begun to rain, and as she stood pausing at the door it increased,
threatening to come on heavily. But having committed herself to
this line of action there was no retreating for bad weather. Even
the receipt of Clym's letter would not have stopped her now. The
gloom of the night was funereal; all nature seemed clothed in
crape. The spiky points of the fir trees behind the house rose into
the sky like the turrets and pinnacles of an abbey. Nothing below
the horizon was visible save a light which was still burning in the
cottage of Susan Nunsuch."|"The Return of the Native"|"Thomas Hardy"

anybody else came to him, he retired to rest, and despite his
anxieties soon fell asleep. His sleep, however, was not very sound,
by reason of the expectancy he had given way to, and he was easily
awakened by a knocking which began at the door about an hour after.
Clym arose and looked out of the window. Rain was still falling
heavily, the whole expanse of heath before him emitting a subdued
hiss under the downpour. It was too dark to see anything at

you called, and so make you think ill of him, as I did not think it

Wildeve immediately prepared to assist her in her flight, and, as
he hoped, accompany her. He was somewhat perturbed, and his manner
of informing Thomasin that he was going on a journey was in itself
sufficient to rouse her suspicions. When she had gone to bed he
collected the few articles he would require, and went upstairs to
the money-chest, whence he took a tolerably bountiful sum in notes,
which had been advanced to him on the property he was so soon to
have in possession, to defray expenses incidental to the
removal."|"The Return of the Native"|"Thomas Hardy"

intended to be, for he hastened up to the door, lifted the latch,
and walked in without ceremony."|"The Return of the Native"|"Thomas Hardy"
