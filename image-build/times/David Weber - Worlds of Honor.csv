Left to my own devices, I wouldn’t bother either of you until you were both ready to come up, but-” He waved the hovering right hand, and she blinked again as she followed it to the rest of her entourage."|"Worlds of Honor"|"David Weber"

However, the need to put in place both a Regent and a Regency council suggests that no one will choose to filibuster.”"|"Worlds of Honor"|"David Weber"

"ap 00:00"|twelve|"What was true for them was twice as true for their kids, however. There simply weren’t many children on Unicorn Eleven, and that was one area in which the invention of the prolong anti-aging treatments didn’t help a lot, either. Prolong was tending to erase a lot of the age-based divisions which had always been humankind’s lot, which would probably be a good thing once civilization fully adjusted to the consequences. Of course, first they’d have to have prolong long enough to figure out what all those consequences were, Ranjit supposed. It had been available in the Star Kingdom for only sixty-four years. To someone his age, that seemed like forever, but it was less than an eye-blink in terms of a culture’s adjustment to so monumental a change. One immediate effect was readily apparent, however: people were waiting considerably longer, on average, to have children. His own parents had rushed things more than many of their contemporaries in that regard, because both of them loved children and they’d wanted to get started early, but that was increasingly rare. Which meant that, despite a total population on the order of eight thousand, there were less than three hundred kids on Unicorn Eleven, and those who were present tended to be the children of the senior personnel and so, on average, older themselves. At seventeen, Ranjit himself was below the median age of the children aboard the station, whereas Susan, at twelve, was actually the youngest one of all."|"Worlds of Honor"|"David Weber"

“Hallucination. Yes, Ma’am. I kind of wish it was one, too.”

The teacher let out a shriek that must have sounded like the noon lunch whistle in factories halfway across town and darted for the exit with an alacrity that did credit to her condition if not her courage."|"Worlds of Honor"|"David Weber"
